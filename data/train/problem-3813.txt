Dean snorted. “I like you, Cas. You’re not a typical fanboy. It’s nice.”
To Dean’s surprise, there was almost no grumbling about making the cocoa. Dean thought Bobby was secretly pleased to have someone to take care of again, but he’d die before he’d say so out loud where Bobby could hear. He liked his face the way it was, thank you, with no rearrangements.
?” Cas’s blue eyes were as big as Dean had ever seen them.
He found Dean in the kitchen, making waffles and scrambled eggs.
(See the end of the chapter for
Now he couldn’t imagine why he’d ever wanted anything else. It was almost like discovering he had another penis head on his backside. The feeling of Cas’s tongue swirling around his hole was almost the same as having that same tongue laving at the underside of his cock near the head. It made his thighs quiver and his balls draw tight and he was reasonably sure, if he really wanted to, he could come just from being rimmed.
Cas ground their crotches together and Dean moaned into Cas's mouth.
“Dean, five years ago, I could have believed your story. I could have believed that a Djinn offered you your heart’s desire and the best you could come up with was a one night stand. But I’ve been human since then. I’ve gotten to know you much better. And I don’t believe you.” His eyes softened with hurt and Dean glanced away. “Dean. Why are you lying to us?”
“Look, sorry we didn’t get to talk after,” Dean said.
*schmoops all your faces*
“Um, he wasn’t supposed to turn me, but things went bad at the compound. Benny had told me about shrinking and flying and all that and when it came down to it, I knew that was going to be my only chance to get out. I let him turn me and we got away.”
be on the bottom and it is
In all his time at the castle, though human faces came and went, nothing really ever changed. By day, he mostly read books or painted or kept bees or did one of the myriad hobbies he had learned in his time on Earth—and there were many. By night, he hunted and fed on the fauna in locations not too close by.
“Dude, I chose kissing you over
“Take a right at the next street,” Cas said when the car reached the road. Then he said, “I’m working a case nearby and I decided it might be wise to get a job at the store. I know the pay isn’t as good as pool hustling and credit card scams, but I’m better at it.”
“Dean. The only issue I had was that they were
He nodded. “I think so, yes.”
As soon as he thought Cas was ready, Dean slipped in the tip of a second finger. The stretch was easy and, if the pleased “Mmmm” was anything to gauge with, Cas liked the way it felt.
“Well, this is a nice looking cake, but it seems to be a little off-book, gentlemen. Can you tell me what you’ve done differently than the others?”
Cas pulled away and came back with the blue swirly bottle.
were blue—though it was hard to tell in the dim light from the foyer—crinkling at the corners.
“Yes,” Castiel said slowly, unsure of what Dean was getting at.
Or so Dean thought, until the text came. And then Dean didn’t know what to think.
"I-" Castiel began, but he faltered and shook his head, unsure what to say.
Dean’s voice when aroused was a melodic sound, stirring Cas’s arousal to new heights. Without a word, Cas straddled Dean’s lap and returned to kissing, easily getting lost in the warm, comforting feel of it. On instinct, Cas ground down onto Dean, rubbing their straining erections together through their clothes.
Balthazar stopped in at the shops and bought a few things, letting it drop that he was visiting the castle. He flirted with everyone and generally tried to leave them with a good impression of the family who owned the castle. The days of mobs with torches were mostly over, but Bal knew they could return all too quickly without maintenance of goodwill. He knew Cassie would never think to do these things for himself.
Cas sighed. “Good morning, Dean. Is there coffee?”
if there was any chance that Dean could—oh.
Every touch felt better, even kiss more mind-blowing, every caress more intense. Dean just felt so good all over that when Cas slid inside him and wrapped a hand around his freshly hard cock, his brain whited out for a second. It was too much and he couldn’t process how good it all was.
“Don’t worry, Sam,” Mary said soothingly. “I’m sure they’ll let you live with them.” She winked at Cas. “They’ll need a babysitter.”
Before Dean could react, Sam groaned. “I take it back. You’re both lame and deserve each other. Let me know when you need help with picking out China patterns.” He grabbed a book and started reading it, ignoring the ‘lame” older people in the front seat.
As soon as he got back to the porch with his glass of juice, he saw Cas walking toward him. His head was down and he did not look up, even when he reached the porch. When Dean said hello, he responded, but his skin darkened to a dull crimson and he started to head back inside.
Dean sighed. “You really wanna argue semantics right now? ‘Cause I was under the impression that you wanted my mouth on your dick, but if you’d rather have a debate—”
“Actually, I—” the man tried to say, but John Winchester was already gone. The man sighed. “Already got my wallet back,” he muttered. Then he realized Dean was still standing there.
“You... what? I mean, I know I’m tone deaf, but other people seem to really enj—”
on 3/27/16? (or 27/3/16, if you live in certain places)
“About fucking time,” Sam muttered. “Try not to get any fluids on the books, huh?”
"Oh yeah? Like what things?"
By the end of his walk, he had made his own decision. He would get an apartment with Dean. They would live together for the remaining 3 months of his rumspringa once Dean was released by Judge Turner. Castiel, for his part, couldn’t wait.
“Dean, my husband and I have been talking and Sam has told us how well you are doing here. He says you’re going to take a job with Bobby when you get out?” she asked with a searching look.
“Sam, you’re repeating yourself. I hope you can come up with better material when you’re our butler,” Cas said, holding a serious face.
He flagged down a sales person and they took down the pertinent information about the mattress he wanted and started to walk with him to the register. On the way there, however, he spotted a comfortable-looking recliner and stopped to look.
Cas snorted. “Nice posters,” he said, indicating the ones above Dean’s bed, on the ceiling.
"What?" he asked breathlessly.
“Nah, just sore muscles, man. No big deal.”
Cas and Dean avoided eye contact for a full minute and then had a staring contest for another two. Finally, Dean sighed and grabbed Cas’s shoulder, pushing him toward a chair as he himself sat down.
Cas gave him that smile that never failed to do things to Dean’s insides. Then he nodded. “You’re right. Let’s go get married.”
IT IS FINALLY DONE!! I'm very excited.
"Hi. You're actually home?" Cas frowned. "Did you choose to be off on a day when I had to work?"
“Okay, so my family, they’ve always been hunters, as far as I know. At least, that’s what my dad said. I never really liked it. It didn’t seem right. Some of the monsters were killing people, sure, and they needed to be stopped, I got that.”
Mortie walked in and he smiled at them. He was followed by NotBalthazar and then Ava. They walked to the front of the room and Mortie took the lead.
“You mean more to me than the ocean.” His smile softened. “And anyway, your eyes are bluer than She is.”
"I just wanted to be with her—and only her—forever and ever, amen." He sighed. "She wanted me back, but she didn't believe in true mates, first of all. Secondly, she wasn't down with Alpha on Alpha action. She left me. High and dry. I never saw her again. And I've never been the same since."
Cas was surprised by how much reference the music had to religious themes. There was one about Heaven and another about holy things. Some were very sexual in nature, which made him mildly uncomfortable, but he quite enjoyed one about a levee.
Dean frowned, considering Cas’ words. “Don’t you do these visits every single day? I’m no more special than you are,” he told Cas, uncomfortable with the praise.
“Well, yeah, but he said I’d changed your life for the better and, like, you know, the thing last night…” Dean stared at his feet, face pinking with embarrassment.
Castiel smiled, wide and bright. “Neither am I, Dean.”
“Sorry, Dean.”
Cas looked at Dean’s flaccid dick with one raised eyebrow, then looked back at Dean, transforming his expression into one of uber-enthusiasm. “That’s the spirit! Think positive!” He turned back to Dean’s penis and said, “You can do it, boy! You can be big like the others!”
like you, and that’s what’s going to matter most to them, all right?”
“Aaron?”
“I just don’t see why you would want to go out with her when you know for a fact she only likes you for your car,” Castiel spat at him after finding out Dean had made a date with a girl named Bela.
The Campbells and Sam all smiled. “Of course, Dean,” Mrs. Campbell told him. “Take all the time you need. We know it’s a big decision.” She squeezed Sam. “We should go. You two have a good weekend.”
moves, but then Cas sank deeper onto his cock with his hot, wet mouth and Dean didn’t really care.
“Shit, we’re gonna have to do the speaker thing, aren’t we?”
“Dude... I have a confession to make too.” Dean took a deep breath and grinned. “I can’t fucking sing.”
Sam nodded, then smirked. “Plus at your apartment I can watch R rated movies without mom and dad finding out,” he teased, probably at least half-serious.
Dean’s mouth made him feel things he’d never felt before. He’d never kissed anyone before. He had no idea it felt like this. The warmth and the longing and the need to get closer. Then he thought about what would happen if the curtains were open enough for anyone to see.
Cas covered the hand that was touching his arm. "I'd really like that too, Dean."
,” Cas groaned as his own orgasm swept through him and he covered Dean’s fluids with his own.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not even a little bit,” Cas admitted. He shook himself. “Let’s not talk about it. Teach me to surf.”
“That would be very nice. Just a joint will be fine. Any time before New Year’s, right, Michael?”
?!” Cas repeated, more vehemently.
He glanced down at the outfit he was wearing and remembered.
Dean grimaced, remembering. “Yeah, and I forced Sam to come with me. I put him back on the streets, man,” he admitted, shaking his head. “I told myself I was protecting him, but I was forcing him to live rough when he didn’t have to.”
"Tell me something, Cassie. If all the hormones were gone, how would you feel about Dean? Is he some ugly jerk? Because, I gotta say, having seen the guy and spoken to him during a pretty bad moment, pretty sure neither of those is remotely the case."
“Yes. Otherwise I’ll get in trouble when you take me home.”
“It isn’t something I like to think about, but yes, I’m afraid I will not be able to visit often. You will probably be permitted to visit the community, but I do not know how frequently they will allow it.” Castiel’s frown deepened. Now he understood why Dean was troubled, but he wasn’t happy about it.
“Well, what is your type?” Gabriel asked, evenly.
Almost immediately, his phone rang again. The display said it was Bobby again and he spoke in a rush. “Dean? Rufus just called. Jacob and Castiel showed up over there just a few minutes ago. Castiel is on his way over there now. He’ll explain everything, all right? I just wanted to let you know.”
Dean was so ready for this day to be over, it just wasn’t funny.
“Yep, that’s me. Who’s this?” came the voice down the line, followed by the sound of crunchy chewing.
No sooner were the words out of Dean’s mouth than Cas was dragging his own cock against Dean’s erection in a filthy, mindblowing slide. Dean’s lower body contracted involuntarily, like a mini version of an orgasmic spasm.
“Was I really good, Dean?”
“Uh-uh-uh, Dean, use your words,” he admonished.
He pulled himself up short when he realized that what he was doing right now was not, in fact, putting it out of his mind. That it was, in fact, thinking about it. He grumbled to himself and forced his mind onto the task at hand, which happened to be building a table for the Millers.
It wasn’t that strange for men to take off their shirts in front of other men, Castiel knew that. He often passed farm hands who were stripped to the waist. However, he’d grown up in two very modest households where they never saw one another unclothed to any degree. Besides which, the reactions he had to Dean were not like the ones he had to anyone else. It was Dean’s naked torso specifically that was the true problem.
When his pie came, it tasted like sawdust and sat in his belly like a stone.
A sob slipped through his defenses, but he kept on talking.
Today, though, he was dressed like the Prince of Persia and he felt like a badass. It was stupid. He slew monsters on a daily basis, so he was already badass, but strapping on swords made it feel so much cooler, somehow. More like a fantasy than real life. He certainly didn’t mind that.
“Ar-are we done?” Cas asked incredulously.
“Not gonna last long, Cas. Feels too good. Fuck,” Dean cried as Cas set up a fast pace.
for updates.
He stopped and had lunch, then packed up all the food from the cabinets, followed by the dishes. When he was done with that, he took a break to call Bobby to finalize a time for him to swing by with the truck to get the first load of stuff. They were planning to move everything except what they’d need for one more night and move that the following day.
Cas didn’t think he’d imagined the way Dean’s face fell at the mention of his “real” life back home. Surely, though, he must have.
, Cas. So goddamn good. Need more, baby.” Dean knew he was babbling a little, but it scarcely bothered him.
Dean’s grin was so strong it almost hurt his face. “You just got upgraded to front seat, my friend!” He leaned close to the car. “You hear that, girl? Cas is a man of good taste.”
“Gabriel, could you at least wait until
“I’ve been in touch with Gabriel,” Cas told him quietly as they headed for the village.
“The Men of Letters were perverts and deviants,” Cas spat angrily. “Either that or they had a sick sense of humor.”
Cas’s shoulders slumped. “Fine. I want to try edging, all right? And I need your help.”
,” he whined as the angel bottomed out.
“Mm,” Cas murmured as he picked up another bottle.
“It reminded me of you. On the surface, they seem so calm and peaceful, but underneath they are working very hard, just to stay afloat.”
“I hope so,” Dean said cautiously. “I might get my own apartment, though. Don’t know if I could take living with him.”
“While we do not approve such language, you will not be punished for it, Dean. We will appreciate your continued attempts to censor your words while you are with us.” Castiel thought he saw the corners of Jacob’s mouth twitch, but he wasn’t certain. “Castiel is correct, however. Our way of life is about serving God and helping each other. We cannot make you do the former, but you will be expected to learn the latter.”
Dean nodded and they started walking, side by side this time. “So, does everybody eat in a big dining hall here?”
Dean sat on his couch, nursing a beer and watching old Star Trek reruns. He pretended he wasn’t watching the clock, to see if Cas’s friends should have arrived yet. He also pretended he wasn’t straining his ears to hear if his phone had chimed with a text message. He was halfway through his beer when the sound actually happened, and so into the serious Spirk subtext of the current episode that he wasn’t even sure he’d really heard it.
Dean’s whole body went cold. “What?”
“Cas? Hey, man, you okay? You look like you just took a
. Dean had pretty large shoulders, but Cas’ hands easily covered them. One wrapped around the back of his head and held him in place, but the other began to roam free over as much of Dean as it could reach. Since neither of them was wearing much in the way of clothing, this was escalating more quickly than Dean was used to, but he had no plans to call a halt. There was no part of him that was not 100% on board with what was happening.
Dean though his eyes might bug out of his head. “Are you serious?”
Six months later, Dean came to find Castiel in his study, looking determined but very unhappy. Castiel set aside his quill and stood up, gesturing at Dean to sit in one of the chairs by the fire. Castiel himself took the other.
. If that didn’t make someone a friend, Dean didn’t know what could.
He started reading and was so engrossed in the text that he didn’t hear Dean get out of the tub or walk down the hall. He jumped when Dean spoke to him from the doorway, though from being startled rather than from embarrassment.
“The guy you packed in the speaker with me, jackass, who do you think?”
Cas didn't know what to say. He'd never seen Gabriel as somber in their lives as he had appeared in the past ten minutes. He'd never heard of this woman before. He truly couldn't remember a time when Gabriel cared about being an Alpha.
“Nah, pelvis is all wrong.” For some reason, when he realized what he’d said, Dean looked more embarrassed.
Hello, my lovelies. ♥Kisses♥ for everyone!
a four hour round trip, so…”
The next morning over breakfast, they scoured the
I know. I'm a horrible tease. The worst. You like it, though. Because you know if you're good, I'll give you a reward.
“I’m sorry, have you met your father, John Winchester with whom you share a few traits both positive and negative? Do you think Dean would openly hit on a man in front of you or anyone else?”
“Hey!” Sam cried fromt he other room, indignant.
Slowly, Cas shook his head. "No." He took a deep breath. "But I wish I had."
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean didn’t really intend to follow through on the threat, but he left the apartment just the same, slamming the door on his way out. He still had his fake ID, so he could probably find a bar. He liked the occasional beer, but tonight he kinda thought he might have a dozen. He wanted to drink until he forgot how much he loved that stupid blue eyed fucker who’d just ripped his heart out.
He should have taken the damn job with Bobby when he’d offered, but doing things the easy way wasn’t in Dean’s nature. He was an idiot, and this time it might cost him more than a few months in detention. For the first time, Dean truly regretted the actions that had brought him in front of a judge. He never did when it was for Sam because it was for Sam. When it stopped being for Sam, he didn’t regret most of what he did afterward because it had felt like his only option.
“‘s a really good book, Sam. Cas let me read it. You’re gonna love it. I gotta do the milking and then I’m gonna make supper, I think. Unless you two wanna go down to the kitchens?” he asked.
Dean stared at Cas in the dim light of the apartment, mouth all but hanging open in his surprise. “You…are you sure? I don’t want you to do this just because you think I want it. I mean, last time, you wanted to plan ahead and –“
“I could, yes, but it would defeat the purpose of living in the world. The community and the church want us to know exactly what we are choosing not to have before we agree to commit our lives to plain living.” Castiel was not interested in learning the things he was supposed to, but he had little choice.
a relief, huh?” Dean turned away as he said it, lest Cas be able to read him as easily as he always had and know Dean was lying.
He reached down and took Cas’s rather impressive erection in hand, stroking slow and loose for the moment. Cas enjoyed the sensation for a moment before reciprocating. Dean gasped and involuntarily bucked into Cas’s grip. Those long, graceful fingers were every bit as skilled as he’d always though they might be. He might not having kissing down, but dude knew how to jack it. Dean had to concentrate not to lose it in the first ten strokes.
“I thought we’d decided he was going to be the babysitter?”
hands.
sex. Man. At least I know why you never called me now.”
“Good to know,” Dean told him, smiling back. “Um, if you ever did want to, uh, help, how would you feel about being on camera? I’d split the cash with you, obviously.”
“Balthazar, you don’t sleep.” Cas glared at his cousin.
“Our intention to consummate did factor into my decision, but it was hardly the only reason. I have a life that doesn’t allow a relationship like ours. I am sorry, Dean. You knew this when we started.”
Cas’s face instantly showed contrition and his voice went up an octave or three. “
Tears were stinging Dean’s eyes at the idea. Bobby, normally as gruff and stoic as they come glanced over just as Dean’s lip started to quiver. The older man pulled Dean in for a bear hug and they quietly cried on each other’s shoulder for a couple of minutes.
“We went back later, let them free.”
“Then I can’t let you go back, Cas,” Dean told him quietly, but with steel in his voice. Cas stilled suddenly, as if only just realizing what he’d said.
“I believe you two are done here.” Cas’s voice—deep and rumbly enough that Dean could feel it all through him—made it clear he would not accept alternative suggestions.
Dean rolled his eyes before he put all his concentration on carefully backing out of the space and into the street. “Cas is my new best friend and he gets to ride up front because he called Baby gorgeous.”
“Come along, Dean. I rarely bite,” Cas told him, walking back to the room where he’d been smoking.
Cas relaxed back and nodded a third time. Dean slowly unbuttoned Cas’s entire shirt and slid it off his shoulders. Cas’s breath hitched and he licked his puffy lips, making them shine, but otherwise, he was silent and still. Dean took a second to drink in the beauty of Cas’s dusky nipples and the lines of his torso.
Dean dropped his voice to a sultry purr, attempting to pull her toward him by her robe ties. “What’s in it for me, hot stuff?”
him? Don’t pretend you don’t like guys the same way you like girls coz I know you do, Dean.”
“So no one will be able to see what we get up to in here, huh?” Dean asked, stepping close to Cas again and coming in for a kiss.
Lisa looked surprised but not upset. She’d never been a very possessive person. “Oh, okay. Which one?”
Dean looked at him in confusion. “Cas, dude, I was clearing the room for us.”
“More, fuck, more!”
Sentences were no longer an option. Dean’s world narrowed down until it was nothing more than the warm, wet caress of a tongue against his hole and the throbbing want in his belly and groin. Cas made sounds of pleasure against him, but he barely heard. The vibrations of the sounds on the other hand, he felt those, and they excited him even further.
Then he looked at Cas again, all exposed and restrained on the bed and felt a pang of jealousy.
Dean, always a speak first and think later kind of guy, said, “I’m good. Just kinda wanted to kiss you just then.”
“No shit, Samlock. I want a beer to take my anxiety from a roar down to a whisper. You really think that’s any different than somebody else popping a Xanex for the same reason?”
“We didn’t really grow up together like Sam and I did. I don’t think of him like a brother. We’re closer than that. He’s my best friend and....” He closed his eyes again against the tears that sprang up, unable to finish his sentence. He did his best to get his breathing under control and spoke again. “And I don’t love him like a brother.”
They stuck to lighter subjects for the rest of the time it took Dean to cook and after a few minutes, Cas even came up and pressed a kiss to the back of his head and leaned on him while he put items into the sauce pot. Dean’s chest relaxed after a while and stopped feeling so tight and awful.
“Thank you. I’m glad you like it.”
“Fuck, I love the way you kiss,” Cas said in a whisper when the kiss ended.
He was disappointed when Cas’ hand pressed him away, but then Cas spoke and Dean’s brain went offline for a second. He was pretty sure his eyes had just gotten twice their normal size. Did Cas just say they could start kissing and touching when they moved in together?
Dean looked at him as though he had just confessed to killing someone. “You guys... aw, man. No cars, okay. No cussing, sure. But no Zeppelin? That is a crying shame, Cas.” He shook his head, and Castiel did not think he was joking. “Led Zeppelin is the greatest rock band that ever lived. That’s what Led Zeppelin is.”
This time, Dean seemed to realize what he’d said because he glanced up and smiled sheepishly at Cas. “Sorry,” he said, slightly less upset than he was.
“Dean, I have loved you for so long. I’ve waited years for you to say those words. Do you think we might—”
When Dean finally put a stop to the kissing and made them go to bed, Castiel’s lips felt tender and swollen in the best way. He rubbed his fingers over the soft skin as he lay in the darkened room, smiling at the thought that, for now, he could have this everyday. It was glorious.
MISSED YOU! ♥♥♥
"I wish you had too."
making money as a stripper, to be honest.”
why you've been working so much?" Cas sat heavily on the couch. "I thought...." His voice got small and high. "I thought you'd been avoiding me."
Cas’s voice was cold, but his eyes were red.
“Yeah. And, seeing him, Lisa, I don’t know if—”
When Dean turned his gaze back to Castiel once more, those lovely green eyes widened slightly.
Cas got to his apartment first and raced around looking for the source of the noise. He heard what sounded like voices in his bedroom, so he rushed in there. He could not believe what he was looking at when he walked inside.
Cas didn’t slow his thrusts or speed them up, but he kept changing the angle, as though he needed to feel Dean from every possible direction. Dean was still enjoying the sensations, though he knew he was going to be sore tomorrow. Even as he had the thought, he felt Cas applying more lube to ease the slide.
“Much more than his owner,” Cas snapped back.
Before Dean could get too comfortable, though, his phone started buzzing. “Shit, where are my pants?” he asked, half sitting up.
Cas pinched his nose to try and ward off the tension headache he could feel forming behind his eyes.
“Y-yeah.”
, ever again.” His laugh was halfway toward being a sob and it was bitter. “And you wouldn’t even tell me
The next morning after breakfast, though, Cas left them to do the milking while he got started on the wagon. He was evidently pretty excited about it. Jacob had mentioned Cas was almost as good as him when it came to woodwork and Dean kind of wanted to see for himself. Because Cas was his friend. That was the only reason.
(See the end of the chapter for
!” Cas shouted, shoving Dean out the door.
Dean debated it for a second before turning to Cas. “You wanna meet my brother and my best friend?”
my date with Dean to make him run for the hills?” Cas asked with a sigh.
He seemed unaware of what he’d said, continuing to kiss his way down Cas’s torso toward his crotch. Cas on the other hand, suddenly had a pounding heart. Sometimes it really seemed like Dean did want him to stay, as much as Cas wanted to stay himself. Cas wanted to still Dean’s head and ask him directly, admit how he himself felt and ask Dean’s feelings on the matter. But, though he’d overcome so many fears on this trip, in this he was still petrified.
. Wish you could see this pretty little hole of yours.”
Sales Associate Castiel went into a lengthy explanation of pixels, LCD versus LED versus Plasma and a bunch of other specifications. Dean was going back and forth between the chat window and the TV spec comparison lists.
“Well, thanks for making me laugh, anyway.” He stretched and yawned. “I know it’s early, but I’m pretty tired still. You mind if I finish this story some other time?”
“Hey!” said a stage whisper from behind them. “You know that’s a dude, right?”
“Yeah, yeah. Let’s go.” She winked and smiled at them behind Sam’s back, though.
“I’d like that very much,” Castiel said, eyes lighting up. “I didn’t have swings at... my old house.”
“What does that mean? Is that like having the...  hots?" Cas asked, struggling to recall Dean’s previous phrase.
He showed the boys to the room Sam and Dean used to share when they stayed here. The old bunk bed was the same as always. Dean let Cas have the top, even though it was usually his, because Cas said he’d never slept in bunk beds. Dean put their bags down on the floor and started to walk out to the bathroom, but Cas closed the door and grabbed his arm.
pushing at the surface of his skin.
Cas, a smile playing at the corner of his mouth, eases a finger inside me. His eyes are bright--glassy, even--which is how I know he's just as close to breaking point as I am.
I push on. "I need...I need a little help here, Cas. I can't be doing any kind of resting unless I resolve this...situation."
Cas closes his eyes a moment scanning the building, then reopens them. "Not yet," he says. "But they're on their way. In the meantime, you'll just need to stay quiet."
"Huh...practiced this before, have you?"
The cool weight of the bottle is lifted from my hand eventually, and Cas steps forward to stand at my shoulder.
I pull out of the kiss to catch my breath, but I do not move my face. I breath in his every exhale; we are still so close our lips almost touch. I reach unseeingly for the lube, and crack it open one-handedly, slipping my other arm between our bodies to squirt copious amounts of the stuff onto my fingers. Dean obediently rises up onto his knees as I reach back around his body. My fingers slide wetly over the inner edge of one ass cheek, and I begin with a few long, slippery strokes, downwards and inwards, until I gently locate that tight ring of muscle, and begin to draw soft, coaxing circles around it with my fingertips.
"Cas...I'm gonna need a shower."
Well, I'm asking for
There's a subtle shift in the air around us, and I feel the jagged edges of my rage soften, like I'm suddenly being cocooned. Like I'm safe.
I place my hands either side of his neck, for balance, and as I drop down into his lap, he’s forced to move his stabilising hand to accommodate me. He moves his hands down and splays them wide over my hips. Not doing anything but holding me; hard fingers and warm palms pressing into my skin.
I take the book back to my room and spend ten minutes staring at the front cover. Eventually, I open it and start to flick through, stopping when a word or phrase catches my attention. But before I even get past the contents pages, I've hit a phrase so dumb that it makes me snap the book shut and throw it across the room.
He rouses himself for just long enough to do the same, stripping off his clothes to reveal his battered but beautiful body and pad over to the bed.
But I need him to say it. If he doesn't tell me, I cannot know.
He leans forward, his lips brushing the rim of my ear. "Are you sure?" he murmurs, hand cupping the opposite side of my jaw, so I can't pull away. "I could have sworn you were trying to ask, without asking, for precisely the opposite."
ready.
"Dean, I--"
"I'm here," he says again, his voice rich with want. "I'm here. I
When I say that, the corner of his mouth twitches. I know he's laughing at me, but I'm also too horny to give a crap.
"God,
Dean, on the other hand, kisses Cas with hunger. He tends to kiss him on the mouth; to play a game of catch and release with lips and tongue. Like now--as he's drawing back from the kiss, he's tugging Cas' lower lip ever-so-gently with his teeth.
"It's
different. But not different because it didn’t exist. Oh no. Different because it was beyond mortal comprehension. An angel’s love was fierce and absolute devotion. The human emotion of love didn’t even touch the sides.
Sometimes, it is more one-sided than others. Sometimes, he will not allow me to pleasure him, and wants only to give; other times, he
at me.
"Mm."
"No. I like you there. Stay."
If he was flushed before, he is suffused with colour now. Embarrassment mottles red on his neck and shoulders.
"What?"
I have learned to watch his eyes for the emotions that he thinks he masks so cleverly, as well as the ones he lets show.
He has closed his eyes, leaning back into the pressure of my fingers as I let them travel up the small of his back.
"I, uh, just came down to ask if I could borrow the Impala. I thought I'd take Jack out for a drive...there's this...thing...a couple towns over, so I thought maybe I'd take him, but, you know, he likes the Impala best, so..."
He watches me contemplatively for a minute or two, massaging as I throb against his hand, experimenting with pace and pressure. Then, he closes his eyes--scanning again, I realise; my comprehension is just a little delayed because of the languorous way his fingers twist.
I feel my lip curl with annoyance as I turn to look up at him. "Who's we?" I ask, even though it's completely unnecessary.
about me.
He doesn't take the bait, so something is definitely up.
"You're shaking, Dean."
I get frustrated by his shorts. They're in the way. I let go of him just long enough to grab his stupid underwear by the waistband and tug it down over his dick, but I don't bother pulling it down any further. I've had my share of rushed encounters, and I know
I guess I got curious.
The kiss is unexpected, but very nice.
the fabric, his fingers curling into a fist around me, and I whimper as his thumb wanders gently around the tip of my cock.
I take his face in my hands, drawing him down so that I can press my lips to his.
There were other things that needed to be done--Lucifer's son to be dealt with. But Dean can't help. Dean is pulverised by loss. When they burn Cas' body, Dean stays. He watches every minute of the flames. Just stands there, staring, for hours after Sam retreats. But the whole time he watches, he can't cry. He wants to, but he can't do it. The tears drip down his insides instead, coating his guts with pain.
Often, during these movie nights, he would fall asleep partway through a beer or a bowl of popcorn, and my challenge would be to extricate whatever he was holding from his grip before he fell so fast asleep that he spilled it and jolted awake, ready to fight the closest living thing--which was, invariably, me.
So I guess what I'm saying is I've been thinking about my stupid best friend and his stupid eyes, and his...his stupid mouth, and his stupid, uh, angel blade, heh, for like three weeks. And it's starting to drive me a bit crazy. Just this past week, there's been a few nights when I take his tie out of the drawer, and it brings back the memories, and I--
hunger and thirst. Pure need. Impure need. Whatever. It's a need that Dean wants to be the only one to fulfil. He knows that there were one or two before him, but he doesn't
I reach for his face with both hands, and draw him into a shallow kiss. His stubble is rough against my fingers. He is warm; he is real. He is here. The hollow in my stomach is filling, slowly but steadily, with heat, and longing. I can feel him, too--the way he's got me pulled close and the way he's pushed himself forward has our cocks resting together, nudging each other in a lazy, familiar, early-morning conversation.
He pulls out of their kiss long enough to say, "Bed. Now."
So much for 'I was never in your ass'. It was true until tonight.
I briefly consider just having another beer, but beer isn't enough to settle my nerves right now. Not in this crazy lucid dream I'm having. That thing he said...well, he said it less than five minutes ago, but I already forgot how it sounded. I reach for it on my mind and find nothing. And my brain says
Dean's kind of disgusted, but his cock doesn't give a damn what he thinks of himself. He leans in; lets his weight shift; kind-of-not-at-all-accidentally lets Castiel take over. And his submission is all the sweeter because they both
Dean exhales sharply. Every word Cas says is like another stitch pulling him back together.
He was afraid of how Sam and Jack would react, as the physicality and the new intensity of our bond became more obvious. But Sam already knew about what was going on between us. And Jack...well, Jack is very observant. The morning after the fifth or sixth time Dean and I had had relations, entirely his own accord, Jack sat us down in the library to state unequivocally that he thought we were sleeping together, that he approved of our union, and that he was glad that Dean was comfortable enough not to be embarrassed about him overhearing things.
Soft. His lips are so soft. I melt against him in spite of myself.
After a quick glance at the door to be sure it's locked, Dean accepts the invitation. He clambers awkwardly and carefully into the space left on the seat between Cas' legs. The couch isn't really built for two large men, and protests under their weight, but neither of them really properly notice.
felt--for Cas, and the shock, the revelation, is too much to bear.
I guess it kind of is.
"That's it. That's good, Dean.
He doesn't say anything, so I pretend not to notice him. He waits a little while, but eventually breaks the silence.

I sneak words out in between his kisses. "Dean--I'm flattered--but aren't you--exhausted--after the last hunt?"
I can't watch. I feel his warm breath on me; his gentle fingers. I

"Well
. And it's not the first time I've thought about it, but I've never felt ready.

He trails off, flustered, and I decide to try and defuse the situation with humour.
would watch them, of course. They gave me little windows into Dean's mind. Glimpses into the cultural traditions that have shaped aspects of who he is. The stories through which he developed his values, and his beliefs about right and wrong. The models of masculinity whose shallow performances have dictated what he can say, and what he can't say, and how he should express what he feels. For me, every 'my favourite movie' Dean shows me is highly educational, no matter how crudely it was crafted.
"Did I do it right?" he asks, voice hoarse, smiling faintly.
--too much
"I was looking for this," he says, "after you left. I thought it might help me understand why you just...You took it from Sam's room, right? And took it to the job with you."
The heavy silence is punctuated by the clinking of metal on metal as he twists and pulls, testing his restraints.
Permission. He's giving me permission. He's letting his jaw slacken, and he moans around me, and the way it makes his throat pulse and vibrate is the last straw. I drop one hand to the top of the bedframe, and the other into his hair, and I start to thrust. The sound my cock makes in his throat is amazing and disgusting all at once, and the bedframe creaks and groans out a metallic protest anthem under our weight.
So no, Dean is not okay. Because Castiel,
"You smooth bastard."
"I don't know if I'm ready, Cas. I'm not...I'm not a very good option. You probably ought to shop around a bit more before you hitch yourself to this wagon."
He mumbles something incomprehensible again, and turns towards me, nuzzling close against my neck. At the same time, I feel his hand slide over my leg and onto my inner thigh, his fingers tightening restlessly.
I cease massaging the knots of muscle to give him a stern look, then use my grip on his torso to force him to sit on the bed.
From the way his fingers are twisting the bedclothes, he likes the same things I do.
option at the Gas'n'Sip, okay? Just put it on."
It's kind of amazing that he's being so patient with me. I don't think I could be like him, if our roles were reversed. But he's just calm and quiet: no rush, no push, no demands. He's just
Sounds like a loud of bull to me. I mean, ‘acts of service’ just sounds kinda dirty. And anyway, Cas doesn't really touch me.
"Oh," I reply, and then again, with different emphasis, when the meaning sinks in, "
"Whatever," says Dean, "Shut up."

He has no right to be standing there looking at Dean with such innocence and affection at the same time as
Against the glare, I realise that he's holding something.
It takes him a moment. He glances up at me searchingly, so I allow the corner of my lips to curve upwards, to confirm it was a joke.
quiet.
And that's it.
I am an angel. I am complete. I am eternal. But I am built to fight. I was not made for sexual encounters. Sometimes angels do choose to procreate, but only through their human vessels. And obviously this male form is not capable of procreating with another male human. And all of that is beside the point, anyway. The point is that I was made to be a warrior. I was made to follow orders. I was
it is. There.
"Take off your clothes and come here, Dean."
"No," I answer. "Just the lightbulb. I think."
But apparently, Cas is into that. Every time I moan, the sound is accompanied by an equally feral groan or grunt, until his mouth finds purchase on my throat, then my shoulder, and then on nothing but air, a strangled cry, as he--
He feels Cas smile. Strong arms tighten around his shoulders, and Cas' feet lock together over his ass.
balls at the slightest movement.
Cas eases out of me, his pupils wide and his lips parted.
…yep. Yeah.
I'd be stupid not to see it, which makes the two of them even stupider. It's actually kind of amazing. And at this point, I've had to fight the urge to lock them both in the dungeon until they talk about their feelings one too many times.
"Please, Cas," he moans, pushing his cock deeper into the angel's grip, "
That being said, the light-headedness

It's definitely not our usual distribution pattern. Normally, it's me and Dean, or Dean and Cas. It's never been Dean suggesting me and Cas.
I draw back very, very carefully to collapse facedown on the mattress beside Cas. Everything feels raw. I know for a fact that I have never had an orgasm like that in my life, and I have this awkward feeling that now I've, uh,
just be because all of the blood in this human body is on its way, as they say, 'south'.
And I still don't know what to make of that kiss.
I try again. "Dean...if you're tired, you should rest."
I push him back, just a little, to free my mouth. His dick leaves my lips with a wet, messy sound that is somehow profoundly pleasing to hear.
It's not exactly a big room, but Cas stands in the middle of it, away from me. Trying to give me space? I don't know. I feel nauseous.
"Dean...Sam and I have had several...important conversations...in your absence. And you and I...well, uh...I...we need to talk."
I'm glad I got away. I needed to be by myself. To think. To breathe. And it's peaceful out here. No Sam. No Cas. Just me and baby and classic rock mixes. We're okay. We’re good. Everything’s okay.
But once I've closed us into the dim, firelit warmth of the room, I've run out of excuses to keep my distance.
It's not even a real answer, but he smiles anyway, and I feel that familiar mix of hollowness and Something Else stirring deep in my gut. The ache. The yearning. The thing I always thought I was too tough for. The thing that swells up in the core of my being, and makes other parts of me contemplate following suit.
He's seen everything. He's seen my worst. But he loves me.
He pulls his head back and exhales sharply, his brow furrowing a little. He groans; a low, desperate sound. I am momentarily concerned, but as he repeats the sound I feel the tight pressure on my finger easing, and I slip another knuckle's depth into him--because of
I love this man. What I feel, though, is not...it's not pure. It is both an emotional and physical thing. It is the intermingling of my affections and the throbbing of my vessel's...you know. It is not the first time that I have felt this physical sensation, but it's different, because before, it was outside of my understanding and control. Before, I shared this vessel with Jimmy. Now, Jimmy has moved on. This body has ceased to be just a vessel. In a much deeper sense, it has become a manifestation of me.
The eye contact is unwavering. Oceans of blue fire setting my nerves alight. He moves the hand on my chest and puts his arm around my shoulders instead, steadying me. As he does that, there's a flicker of concern in the unyielding blue.
I go over to the chair across from Cas, sit down, and pick up my drink.
Cas' eyes are bright, and his hair is sticking up in all directions. He wriggles down, closer to Dean, to lie flat on the seat, and Dean leans down to kiss him.
Cas curls two fingers inside his hole one last time, then eases them out. He reaches for the lube again, squeezing a goddamn mound of it onto his palms, and then applies those to his own cock. He rids himself of the excess by tending, too briefly, to Dean's neglected erection, with the wettest friction and the gentlest twisting.
"How many times you gonna make me tell you to shut up, Cas?"
Dean finds his peace in hollering cowboys, angry bald men who have improbably accurate aim with firearms, and hiding in sleep.
I was grunting with the strain, but it's fading into gasps and whimpers. I can feel myself getting closer and closer to tipping over the edge, and I pull my hand back so that I can lean my weight entirely on the bedframe, switching from long, rough thrusts to short and slow ones, because his throat is clamping down on me again, and my head is starting to spin. I hear myself saying his name, over and over and over, and then it's happening all over again--I feel myself flood into his mouth and down his throat, and he just
south. Past Mexico-south. I get the feeling that Cas is afraid of something like that happening again, so he just straight-up won't risk doing anything that might cost them their fragile peace.
"I rarely make jokes, Dean."
I breathe in again, deeply. I do not feel ready, but, as Sam said, one never
knew before I did?"
I allow my tone, for that last sentence, to become slightly condescending: a deliberate challenge. Dean likes to be challenged. I have, in the past, observed that he finds it arousing--I never had outright lascivious intentions when pushing him against walls and suchlike, but there were often indications of arousal when I did. The dilated pupils. The changes in the pattern of his breathing. The sensation, once or twice, of his irrefutable sexual excitement--once, memorably, when I had him pinned to the ground: a position not dissimilar to this, in fact, but with the positions reversed.
“Actually, yes. It has options. It is a good source of advice not only for people like myself, who wish to remain celibate, but also for people who intend to embrace their sexuality without giving up their faith.” He tilted the book down to see how much he had read so far—just over a third—and then said, “It is quite interesting. You might even enjoy it, even though you have no faith of which I am aware.”
“Sorry. I’ve spent a lot of time taking care of my brother. I guess mother henning comes naturally to me.” He cleared his throat and straightened up. “Would you like a ride?” he asked, trying not to lace the question with sarcasm.
Dude, laying on the angst before the fluffiest of happy endings is what I
There were others like him out there? Maybe these people could give him the answers that he needed. He ate his eggs as he watched the documentary that focused on the stories of three gay men and one gay woman who had been or still were Amish.
Dean felt like he had heated liquid running from his neck up into his ears and his spine was tingling, but he heard Sam’s oft-repeated advice ringing through his head.
Dean opened and closed his mouth a few times before the frown line between his brows started to smooth out. He gestured between Cas and himself, eyes beginning to show hope at last.
Cas nodded. Dean removed his finger and proceeded to kiss Cas senseless for the next fifteen minutes. Or he assumed it was that long, based on what Sam said when he walked in on them.
They had their supper with Cas’ guardians, which was pleasant. Afterward, Dean walked back to the kitchen to get his pie from Gerda while Cas talked to his folks for a while. Apparently, ‘Mam’ had been the one to fill up their icebox. Cas had seemed very touched by the discovery before Dean had excused himself. When he got back to the table, the others were rising.
“You’ve been reading my thoughts this whole time?”
Dean’s eyes narrowed. “Why’s it all... laying down like that, though?”
, technically. Dean was too busy making fast and dirty love to his best friend to mind too much, or even notice. The guests were not so oblivious, but they didn’t mention the disheveled states of the grooms when they finally made their way downstairs.
“Well, yeah, maybe, but I meant you, specifically, Cas. I’ve liked all the people I’ve met so far, but you’re my favorite.” Dean looked at him for a moment. “You don’t like compliments much, huh?”
Finally, with only two apartments left on their list, Dean insisted they stop to eat. He wanted to find a diner, so they walked around the neighborhood to find one. The burgers and milkshakes went a long way toward improving Dean's mood, but Cas still looked like a kicked puppy.
“We can communicate telepathically, when necessary. After I opened the door to my hotel room, we had words. And I let him know I was going to lunch with you and your family.”
“No phones, I’m afraid. Deserted islands tend to be short on those.” He scratched his head. “Although, since there are two of us now, I suppose it’s no longer deserted.” He grinned again. “Hey, maybe we can repopulate the whole island. I mean, they say homosexual sex can’t result in reproduction, but I’m willing to test the theory.”
“Yeah, I can text him when we get there. Come on, we gotta go down a few floors.”
“As you can see, however, right now I don’t have that kind of time. I know I’m not showing it, but this is actually quite painful. It’s taking all my will to hold myself in check.”
“Uh, sure, yeah.”
we love.” He frowned. “I cannot tell you what to believe. Only what is in my own heart. And in my heart I believe that God continues to love me, even as I continue to love Rufus Turner.”
He could hear Cas add more lube to the condom and then he felt that pressure once again. As it slipped inside, he made himself relax. Cas stayed still for long moments, pressing inside by millimeters at a time. Dean waited for pain, but it never came again. Then suddenly, he realized Cas was starting to move in and out of him in slow, shallow thrusts.
Cas shrugged. “The technique I used earlier to calm your arousal also works in reverse. We’ve wasted enough time not doing this, haven’t we? Why waste more?”
By unspoken mutual consent, they pulled away and cleared their throats, wiping their eyes quickly. “So,” Bobby said in a rough voice. “It’s yours. It’s got water, but no electricity.” Bobby looked sly suddenly. “ I figure, if you wanted, you might be able to turn the land into some kind of farm like they have over in that Amish village.” Bobby gave Dean a pointed look. “You’ve got about five grand to buy building materials with.”
Cas smiled. "I did, Dean. He was very supportive. He made me think about things in a different way."
At least, not until the day Dean Winchester came to the castle.
Heaving a sigh, he untangled the rope from his ankle and turned around—then froze as he realized there was a man standing on the beach, watching him with wide eyes. The man had long, curly dark hair and a beard that reached down to his stomach. His skin was a weathered-looking nut brown. Clearly he was an islander, but Dean wasn’t going to let him stand between him and civilization.
Cas frowned at her. “What difference does it make which alcohol we get?”
“Uh.”
“One Maker’s Mark, coming up.” As Dean poured the drink, he watched the customer surreptitiously. He had his head bent over into his hand and was massaging his neck. Must have had one hell of a bad day. He walked the drink back over and set it down, plopping a cherry in at the last minute. “Here you go, double whiskey, neat.”
“Well, yeah. Best way to get rids of cramps. I mean, sure, there’s ibuprofen, but that takes a while. Kinda makes me nauseous too. I try to avoid it.”
Dean’s smile was slow and triumphant. “Oh, you like that idea, don’t you, Castiel?” He was practically purring. “Liked watching me get slapped into these cuffs too, huh?” He leaned forward again. “So, how about it? Wanna spank me a little? See if I talk?”
“’You adjacent over hypotenuse....’ Dean? What is this?”
The court appearance went even better than the last, and took less time. When they were finished, they took a taxi to a few neighborhoods Dean suggested and had a look around. Castiel knew right away that the second one they visited was the one where he wanted to try to get an apartment.
Castiel gave him a pleased smiled. “I think it will suffice.”
Dean's laugh was nervous. "Yeah, um, so I take your hand. And then I look up at you and---can I call you by his name, Steve? I'd really like you to be him for this next part."
Dean stood in the street, staring up at the sign for the bar.
Cas didn't need that $200 after all.
So many of you asked for another, smutty chapter of this. And today, suddenly, the mojo was there. For all those other fics that I am neglecting, I'm sorry. I am also sorry that I tagged this E from the jump because I don't know why I thought it needed that. I mean, I tagged no smut, so... habit, perhaps? Anyway, this is not the smut. This is the lead up to the smut. Because this is already over 1000 words by itself. So I am splitting it. The second chapter will come (heh) soon, promise.
And on Thursday, I will be getting on a bus for a tour of Nashville, TN with Richard Speight, Junior, whereupon I shall be as dead as poor Cas. x_x
me! You didn’t even give me a chance to explain!” Cas’s voice broke.
“She wanted to go on a date with me?” Cas asked with obvious distaste.
I'm not sure this is going exactly where you hoped, RP/PB... but I'm trying. You know these boys. They wanna just always wanna get to the good stuff. To paraphrase Chuck: Slow burn angst is hard.
I don't know if this con topped my last Dallas con in terms of cool things that happened, but it really moved me deeply.
Dean felt himself leaning forward, eyes locked with Cas’ own gaze. His hand came up to cup Cas’ face in his palm and then his eyes slid shut. He unerringly found Cas’ mouth with his own, pressing their lips together in a second that felt like a horse galloping in his chest. His heart was racing and he couldn’t hear and his face was hot, but he noticed none of it. Those thick pink lips under his own were the only thing he knew for one white hot moment of time.
Dean snorted. “Dude. I can
This was information that Cas didn’t know, but he was pleased that Dean had made these decisions. Previously, Dean had expressed doubt that he was capable of further education. It made Castiel happy to know he had changed his mind and come to accept that he was smarter than he’d been giving himself credit for.
Cas lamented having left his cell phone at the apartment. He could have used it to call a taxi. Instead he'd be stuck here for some time yet. He sighed in resignation. Then he remembered the gifts in his bag.
“Yes,” Cas said, sighing and dropping onto the couch the way he had often seen Dean do. He saw the appeal right away. It was rather satisfying. “I asked if you could come to live there in the village, like we talked about, but he spoke plainly with me and said he knew why I was asking.” Castiel looked up at Dean. “He could see I was panicking and he wished to reassure me, but also, I think he wanted to convince me not to make the same choice he did.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“More like a reform program. He thought I could be rehabilitated if I got out of the juvenile detention system,” Dean admitted, drinking his tea and not looking at anyone. “Turns out he was right.”
Right away, Dean could see something had changed. “I hope you do not mind that I used some of your bathing soaps,” he said quietly. And the breeze blew the scent to Dean, who found he did the opposite of minding.
“Tell me what to do now, Dean. What do you want me to do to you?”
“Dean…” Cas said imploringly, but it wasn’t going to work today.
“Hello.” Castiel sounded really scared and Dean didn’t like it.
He went and sat back down by the bed, and started telling Cas about the status of the car restoration business. The same restoration outfit he’d gotten the small business loan for on the day he’d accidentally confessed his feelings to his best friend. He’d only gotten it up and running a few weeks before the wedding, so there was a lot that Cas needed to be caught up on. Dean was beyond grateful that he had a manager in place who could run things in his absence. Benny had been happy to help, and kept telling Dean to take all the time he needed, even though Dean knew the guy had his own life he was missing out on.
“No, sir.”
“Double whiskey neat... with your cherry. Yes, please.” Cas said it mostly to see if he could make Dean blush again. He didn’t blush, but he did stumble slightly.
“That’s not every nice, Dean.” Cas had still snorted at the name.
They ate in relative silence, though Castiel did let Dean know the food tasted as delicious as it smelled. It was a companionable silence and Castiel felt no trace of his usual awkwardness around strangers. It was a nice change. Dean finished more quickly than Castiel, but Castiel insisted on doing the dishes, since Dean had made their food. He sent Dean to change clothes, instead. They had many things to accomplish today and they should get started soon.
Sam had left again and this time, Castiel noticed that Dean seemed less upset than usual. If anything, Cas thought he almost seemed relieved. It was not hard for Castiel to work out the reason behind his relief, either. Sam had brought up the topic of Dean moving back in with the Campbells at every available opportunity.
"forced bedsharing" + (see end notes on next chapter)
Dean never would have expected those two words to change his life so completely, but he was about to learn just how much power was in that simple phrase.
“Is something—oh, my God!” the super said, tugging Cas’s arm to pull him back outside. She slammed the door behind them. “They did
freaking pleasurable.”
“All right, well, I don’t know where we’re going, but if you change your mind, you can text me and I’ll tell you where we are.” He grabbed up his keys and wallet and headed for the door. “Don’t wait up!” he called over his shoulder.
“Much more than I used to, I suppose.” Cas sighed again. “I guess I may as well try your plan. I don’t know what else to do.”
Oopsy, another cliffhanger. But I love you, my pets. Talk to me. ♥
Dean pointed at him. “Yes! That is a very good id—mmph.”
“What’s that?” the bearded man asked, stepping closer.
“Dean?” Cas murmured against Dean’s collarbone.
Dean's eyes nearly bugged out of his head. "Dude! Have you seen you? Heard you? Had one of your blowjobs? 'Cause I have and no way am I ever gonna lose interest in you sexually!" He sighed and pulled Cas into his arms even closer. "Baby, I know I've been weird the last couple of weeks. I finally paid off the ring and as soon as I had it in my hand, I started to panic. Started to convince myself you'd never want to marry me, that I'd waited too long. You know how I get." Dean shook his head. "But dammit. I never meant to make you feel like anything less than the sexiest man alive."
“Oh, God, why is Becky even here?”
, Dean. You brought someone ho-”
Forty-five minutes later, they lay side by side, sated and still breathing a little heavily. Dean rolled over, flinging one arm over Cas’s stomach and resting his cheek on Cas’s shoulder. He pressed a kiss to the muscle in front of his mouth.
“Yes, sir.” Dean wasn’t sure what the judge was offering yet, but it sounded like something better than juvie and Dean was onboard and ready to ride off to redemption and reformation and all those other pie in the sky things he hadn’t dared dream about.
He began as he had with Balthazar, explaining that his family had always been hunters. Unlike Bal’s stoicism, however, Dean was confronted with Castiel’s growing fury. He hurriedly launched into the part about how he himself had never approved of his father’s methods. He could tell, though, how much John Winchester’s actions and words enraged the man he loved. By the time he reached the story about the werewolf family, Cas was shaking with barely controlled anger.
Dean could tell the kid really meant it. Their brother bond remained as strong as ever and Dean felt lucky. He’d screwed up enough that he wouldn’t have blamed his little brother for wanting nothing to do with him. Sam was great, though, and Dean was grateful.
“How about we go test it out?” Cas asked, without a trace of his normal shyness when it came to bedroom discussions.
When he held the bottle over his fingers, though, Dean stopped him.
"Are you going to sit?" He looked worried, like Dean might run off.

"I'd planned to add selfies to my phone sex service for the evening, but you spoiled my plans. Do you like it?"
“I don’t know.” Cas groaned in frustration. “I think I wanted to test myself. I didn’t want to just get turned on by touching you, I wanted to be taken
Cas took his place in the chair and pulled Dean down onto his lap. They sat there in silence for several minutes, until Bal politely cleared his throat.
Dean looked at him in confusion. “Uh. Yeah.”
“Um, the apartment? I gotta let Sammy and the Campbells know something this weekend and I need to know whether or not you and I are moving in together.” He rubbed his neck the way that he did when he was nervous and Castiel tried not to let it endear Dean to him further. “I, uh, it’s, you know, fine if you don’t want to, I just need to know so I know what to tell Sam.”
“Oh,” Dean said, worried for a second that Cas might be younger than he thought. “How did you get here? Someone drove you?”
“No!” Cas said forcefully. “I find your current state vile and repugnant. However, I am attracted to your body regardless of the state of your soul and I don’t want a distraction causing us to fail in your cure.”
From two different rooms, they heard the admonishment, “Use protection!”
, is what he’d meant.
“Well... I mean, I suppose it might be bad form to sleep with the chef for your brother’s wedding and have it go south. Chefs are very vindictive people.” He sounded sincere, but there was a twinkle in his eye.
That didn’t mean he had to be happy about it.
Bobby made a noise that might have been another laugh. “You call me again soon, Dean. Take care of yourself.”
“Oh, I love this song,” Cas said softly as Dean’s tape rolled over to When the Levee Breaks.
They’d barely been sitting on their respective stools for a full minute when Sam burst out with, “So, do you like Cas?”
“I’d expect nothing less from either of us, frankly.” Cas was smiling again. His wings stroked up and down Dean’s back and sides.
“Whoa, there, buddy. After the show, maybe, huh?”
Dean wasn’t sure whose face looked more shocked by the suggestion, his or Castiel’s.
Dean groaned, but didn’t move. He watched, paying special attention to Cas’s lithe, athletic body. He wasn’t ripped like a body builder. Instead his body exuded strength and movement and grace in a way Dean had rarely seen outside the ballet. His ass alone was sonnet-worthy—not that Dean intended to start writing poetry to how hot the guy was, but still. He could’ve.
“That little shit!” he said with a laugh after his mom and brother were out of the room.
Can't wait to post the next one. It's got my jammy jam in it. Hugs and loves. ♥♥♥

I had intended to write one of the others, but this one kind of jumped up and started shouting at me, so here you are. Check the new rating, if you please.
When his serving was almost gone, he told Cas, “Dude, this is, like, the best thing I’ve ever eaten. You gotta tell the cook for me.”
“Mmm,” Cas moaned around him, nearly sending him over the edge.
“Porn star amounts of jizz, Dean,” he said in between laughs.
“Yeah. You can say that again.”
Dean’s voice was quiet and timid, so unlike him. However, he couldn’t afford to show any hostility. Castiel was on the verge of snapping and he didn’t want to set him off.
Dean laughed. "One track mind, huh? I can respect that." He cleared his throat. "Um, I'm... wearing a suit."
“No!” Cas growled. “We’ve only got a few minutes to do this! Talk

"Hey, I wasn't marking my territory! I was trying to save that poor girl a broken heart by letting her know you were taken. You were the one letting her fawn all over you like she had a chance," Dean said with a huff.
Based on the prompt: "'Pose as a couple for a case' trope. Dean and Cas posing as a couple and having to keep up couple-y appearances, which leads to them both discovering some truths about themselves and each other and the unspoken nature of their bond."
Then he remembered.
“Come on, Cas, let’s get him back to the dungeon.”
“What? No, it’s fine, Cas. I’ve got this. I—”
“That’s what I like to hear,” Dean said, drawing back. His smile went a long way toward cleansing Cas’s bad feelings away. “You can do this, sweetheart. I believe in you.”
and not in order or beta read.)
Dean smiled and held out his arm for Cas to sit closer. He thought Dean might try to kiss him, but he only wrapped his arm around him and held Castiel by his side, stroking a hand lightly up and down his arm.
So, in case you missed it, I added, for the first time ever, a check mark in the f/f box. I have now written my first ever femslash. I'm pretty darned excited about it, if I'm honest.
I fish his hand out from between my legs. He is asleep, and I do not want to suffer the discomfort of an erection for the entire night.
"They're gone now," he says, his own voice getting a little rougher than before.
I notice, with some satisfaction, that he stares at them, with just a hint of longing.
"Good. Kiss me, Cas."
that the love languages book would be a nice, gentle push in the right direction. I thought maybe, just maybe, it would give Cas some context for how Dean expresses himself.
looked
hard.
"Do we?" Dean retorts, his characteristic churlishness trying to re-emerge, though somewhat muted.
When he does, it is to grab my tie and pull me into a kiss that, if I were a human, could have been problematic: by the time he pulls away, I feel a little light-headed, despite the fact that I do not require oxygen.
He's propped on his elbow, and I turn my head to look at him, met with eyes that are just...so blue they practically glow.
I don't really buy into all that touchy-feely self-help crap. That's Sam's schtick. But he gave the book to Cas, and
My turn.
what it feels like to have that tight elastic wrapped around your balls--it'll be borderline, for sure; close to painful without crossing the line; it'll bring him right to the edge, and keep him there.

you, Dean. I want you."
"Did God drop you on your head when you were a baby or something? Cas, you can't be...I...you can't be serious."
And when I do wake, in the morning, Cas is still there. I've rolled onto my side in the night. My face is pressed against his chest, and my head is tucked under his chin. In my sleep, I've flung a leg over and wrapped my arm around him, and he's just lying there, awake, patient as a stone or a mountain, cradling me gently against him.
I'm still something without him. I'm still some
It's a hunter's funeral, but Cas was not a hunter. Even when he hunted with them, he was still an angel. Not the same at all. An angel who pulled Dean out of hell; an angel who broke ranks to side with a couple of grubby humans; an angel who defied God; an angel who did anything and everything he could, for Dean's sake.
It's the book.
as he bobs his head. I let him drive; let his hands guide me; let him edge me steadily and incrementally deeper into his mouth until I can feel the head of my dick brushing the tight circle of the back of his throat. The wet noise that it makes is loud and filthy, but I feel his lips smiling around me and his fingers tightening their grip on my ass, and his ribs pushing against my legs as he breathes in impossibly deep. The inside of his mouth is slick and hot, and I can feel that his lips are wet with saliva; can feel it dripping down his chin, which is pressing against my balls. He can't breathe anymore, but he's still dragging me deeper, and I can feel my body pushing forward involuntarily with
"Dean," he says, "I do not think this book can be of any further use."
The hurricane in my gut hasn't settled enough for me to sit down yet, so I make my way around the little room closing curtains. It's too early in the season to snow this close to the lake, but there was rain forecast on the radio, maybe a storm overnight, and heavy frost by morning, so might as well try to keep the place warm.
His underwear does approximately nothing to hide his boner. If anything, it kind of draws attention to it, because for some reason Cas upheld Jimmy Novak's preference for white shorts, and...well, white stands out in the dark, and other things are, uh, standing. So.
Cas stares unseeingly at the table.
Cas just moans meaninglessly, his body quaking with pleasure, and Dean steals soft, open-mouthed kisses from his lips as they ride out the aftershocks, sharing the moment.
He sits up straighter to free his hands when he feels the mattress sink under my weight again. Shy, cautious fingers push my coat back off my shoulders, and fumble with the knot of my tie and the buttons of my shirt. He pauses at my belt, though, and his hands retreat. We are not quite there yet. Still, the alternative, from my point of view, is more than adequate: he decides to start removing his own clothing instead; pulling his t-shirt roughly over his head, and tugging at his jeans until he is free enough to kick them to the floor. His underwear goes with them, and as he settles back, naked and aroused, he is so painfully beautiful, and so beautifully vulnerable, but I don't dare breathe a word.
I lose myself in his eyes as he reopens them. They are like the ocean.
"Hold up--" He looks at my face, now, with panic in his eyes, "--
"Is that meant to be a
things in common with a human, sure, but...
I'm only human.
"It's flavoured," I observe, raising an eyebrow.
As he's turning back around from closing the door, I lose control of an impulse. I push him back against the wooden surface, my forearm braced against his chest. I don't mean to do it, and I don't mean to kiss him, but that's what's happening--his stubble prickling against my skin and his mouth warm and pepperminty and welcoming. But it's only happening for a hot minute: after that, he places both hands on my chest and pushes me gently away.
"Move up," he says, brusquely, a hand on one of Cas' feet.
Cas places the beer on the ground at his feet, and falls silent.
"And now? Do you...do you still want to?"
"Mm."
Sam left Dean alone to wrap Cas' body.
More often than not, we share Dean's room now. And more often than not, although I do not sleep, I lie with him while he does. He says he sleeps better that way.
"Did you--did you just--"

"I'm here, Dean. I'm here," he murmurs. His voice is syrupy and soothing. "It's okay. We're okay. We're here. Together."

Oh. So that was what the whole
"Cas, if...if this is a joke, it's not funny," he says, his eyebrows knotting together as he glowers.
I let gravity and my leg muscles do the work as I lower myself onto him. It's a lot easier than I expected. Pretty much exactly like sliding a blade into its sheath...or, well, the sheath onto the blade, anyway. I go slow, and it's working for us both--Cas holding my gaze as firmly and carefully as he holds my shoulders, wonder and ecstasy in his eyes. A little sigh or groan escapes his thick pink lips every now and then, but otherwise, he's quiet, like a man at worship.
"Yes, sir."
When he says he wants me, I'm impressed by the fact that I manage to say, you know, actual words. Even if they are just: "How many times you gonna make me tell you to shut up, Cas?"
I feel him sigh as I gently tighten my grip, and I duck under his chin to press my lips against his throat. He gets harder in my hand. A low rumble of pleasure starts somewhere deep in his chest, and escapes him in a hungry moan. I feel his teeth scrape lightly over the shell of my ear; the huff of an embarrassed laugh as he pulses in my grip.
I light a match. The flame catches quickly on the kindling, crackling to life, and the door groans on its ancient metal hinges as I push it shut, the flames multiplying and licking at the glass.
what he wanted. "I can only hear your prayers, Dean."
he is all over again. If he stooped his head even a little, our noses would be touching.
The very edges of his teeth brush lightly along the top of my cock. He tips his head back, using his hands on my ass to pull me forward, drawing me into him. Again, those lips go from tight to loose to
"Cas, we've talked about this. You don’t need to thank me. This is…it’s
Dean silences him with a rough kiss and a series of deep, slow thrusts that have Cas moaning into his mouth. He feels like his heart might burst with everything he feels for Cas, let alone his cock, which has been waiting patiently, swollen and ready, compressed by Cas' insides.
But things don't tend to go my way. So we can't just move on. Of course not. No, instead, tonight, there's a rap on the door, and I open it to find Cas standing there with intent. Not fun intent intent, either. More like he's got a few things he wants to say. 'We're going to talk about it whether you want to or not' intent. But I've been ignoring him, like an asshole, and I'm not quite enough of an asshole to shut the door in his face, so I step back to let him in.
He follows me into the room, his eyes never leaving mine. I only stop when the back of my legs hit the bedframe, and Cas, whose pursuit is slow and careful, reaches out to enfold me in his embrace. I try to shove him away, but he doesn't budge; the only thing that gets dislodged is the angry sob in my throat. He just holds me tighter, silent as I bury my face in his shoulder, his hand stroking the back of my head as I try to steady my breath.
"Can--can I touch you, Cas?"
"You're going to get on your knees," I repeat, firmly, "over me, and you are going to put your hands against the wall, and I'll do that thing that we both liked so much again."

I slick my fingers again, and then press two fingers against him. It is smooth and easy, this time; like he's hungry for it. My stomach flutters with desire, like a flock of birds has just taken flight inside me.
"May I reciprocate, Dean?"
I have the impression that being told what to do may calm him, so I grumble out an order -- "Hands on the wall."
I’m forced to loosen my hold on him as he pulls back a little, looking at me with those pale blue eyes. Always so blue, even when there’s barely any light.

Dean breathes in deeply, taking in Cas' scent.
"Maybe I should just keep you here like this," Cas says, but his voice is hoarse, and Dean can see that the angel's human urges are close to victory.
I expect him to pull it away, but, surprisingly, he doesn't. He actually looks down at where my hand rests on his, and then turns his own palm up, interlacing his fingers with mine.
As his convulsions become shudders, and then just tremors, I cup his face.
"Pants," he mutters, against Cas' mouth, when he comes up for air again.
"There is still a difference, Dean."
I whimper.
I roll all the way onto my back to stare at him, trying to ignore the way that Cas' hand ends up very close to my crotch as a result. "What do you mean, he

"He also said that you are blind to things you do not want to see."

There's another long, uncomfortable silence, broken only by the sound of the water lapping at the pier, before Cas speaks again.
it happened, how quickly things went balls-up, it didn't fully register in his brain that Cas was dead--not until he saw his trenchcoat floating on the surface of the water. And he kept that coat, always, from month to month and car to car, because in spite of Cas being a frigging idiot, and in spite of Dean's shock and bewilderment, on some level he could understand. He understood the reasons Cas had buddied up with Crowley. He'd done almost exactly the same thing when he'd lost Sam. He knew better than anyone how you could end up doing the wrong thing, the most amazingly stupid thing, for the right reasons. So he
"Hands over your head, Dean."
I bite my lip and rock my hips, grinding down on him, my cock bumping between us, and Cas...growls. I've never heard him do that before. It's a sound that would make more sense coming out of a Rottweiler. Instead, I'm reducing an actual angel to animal urges. Does he know that? Did he even know he
For the first time, he actively wants his anger. He wants it to envelop him with its protective heat. He wants to break everything around him, and then himself. But there is no anger in him to be weaponised. He has moved beyond the realms of anger into despair.
“Yes,” he says, “I suppose we do.”
I'm hard.

the films.
I sigh. I would like to be able to be ready for how he will respond, but he is too unpredictable. I can't even imagine what he will do. I just know that anything is better than this uncertainty. It is too much, and has gone on for too long. It is too tiring to just go on trying to veil how I feel for him, and the longer I leave it, the less likely it becomes that I will ever tell him.
He looks embarrassed, all the same. The poor man struggles with friendship and intimacy almost as much as we angels do.
I watch him grapple with the word, but he can't quite manage it.
I accepted the opportunities to spend time with him. In fact, I preferred those movie nights even to riding shotgun in the Impala, because in the car, Dean concentrates on driving.
Dean wraps his legs around Cas' waist, leaning back against the bricks to give Cas room to move, and to pull a hand free. Cas guides his throbbing cock to Dean's waiting hole, and carefully slides it in.
I find mine in the weight of his head on my shoulder, and the sound of his gentle snoring. Sometimes, when the film is over and I turn off the screen, I spend a while looking at his reflection, watching the lines of anger and care fall away from his face. He is frequently confused when he wakes, but I learned that for him there is a five-minute buffering period in that process, so I have almost always managed to take my leave in time for him to not even remember I was there.

clues?
He wipes his palms along the legs of his jeans. I am told that humans sweat through their palms when nervous. Is that what is happening here?
I close my eyes and let myself collapse into a ball on the bed, burying my face into the pillow. "Well that was humiliating," I mutter, muffled by the pillowcase.
My ability to infer meaning from context is, I think, improving. At the very least, I am getting better at what the Winchesters call 'reading the room'--in this case, literally. I suspect that, in this particular instance, for Dean, a darker room is a safer room. It may soften the hard edges of the cruel thing that nestles inside him, and tells him that this is wrong.
"No," I repeat, shaking my head, "No, no. I just...I want to last a little longer, and I--I
He feels that steady, seemingly-human heartbeat under Cas' ribcage--feels how solid he is; how real. And suddenly, with a sudden rising wave of panic, he thinks he sees black nothingness creeping in on the edges of this perfection.
' may have always been a euphemism. The soundtrack of yeehaws or gunfire in the background was protection against his inherited fear that it is wrong to spend time alone with another man. With a movie on, being alone together was forgivable, and he could pretend to both of us that his gradual slump from the back of the couch onto my shoulder was insignificant. Harmless. He was just resting. Just the pure, innocent, coincidental result of exhaustion. I was just his pillow substitute.
me, when he tips over the edge.
While they were gone, Jack and I had a conversation about aspects of Dean's personality, and why some topics (i.e. Dean and my relationship) and particular words (i.e. love) would be best avoided for the time being. Jack responded with great maturity, given that he is so young. We both recognised the probability that mistakes would be made, but agreed that we would deal with any situations if and when they arose.
"So, what, you can just magic your boner away?" he asks, without opening his eyes.
"So," he says, smiling--Dean can feel the shape of his mouth, "humans
thing--Cas, I--"
"Look, you have feelings for Sam, okay? And it's...it's fine."
"Moving inside me gently, rocking our hips together, your teeth on my throat, your hand on my--"
He admitted a while back that he's been in love with me for years now. Years. But all those years, he just let me rest on his shoulder. Never questioned it; never called me out; never woke me up; never asked me why. A couple of times I even half-faked it, just to see what he'd do--and the answer is that he'd just sit there till I stirred.
I have shifted my head a little as the realisation dawns on me, and my movements means that I no longer cast a shadow over Dean's face. He frowns into the glare, shielding his eyes against the harshness of the electric light.
"Whatever," Dean mutters. "Shut up."
like what Cas just did
Dean's hands linger: one on my shoulder, and the other still gripping my tie. Looking down at him, seeing the quiet wonderment and gratification in his eyes, I feel a surge of something that I do not have a name for. Possessiveness, perhaps, but it is more than that. It contains an element of yearning, among other things. It is strange and complex.
His suit rustles as he leans forward, looking at me intently in a way that makes my heart quake.
"I'm ready."
It's not like I
Slowly, gently, his brow furrowed, Cas holds me firm against the chair and draws his head back, his lips red and his mouth slick and messy with spit.
"You looked...unhappy," he says, his voice soft and careful.
--and soft lips, and then the slick, wet interior of his mouth, and at first, his lips are first loose--
So the loss comes out as anger. And when he can no longer contain it, it comes out as splitting his knuckles open against any available surface. When he finally gets him back, the pang in his chest tells him that maybe, just maybe, there was something beneath his anger; something infinitely more terrifying; something he doesn't have the words for. Something that doesn't just hurt, but burns, like coals glowing in the ash. And having Cas back...well, that's a cool breath; a poker stoking the coals back into a small but tenacious blaze that won't go out; it won't give up. Dean has never known a feeling quite like it before.
I feel him disappear. His absence is sudden and absolute; like a part of my soul has just up and gone.
After sex, he always suddenly seems...Maybe 'innocent' isn't the right word. Overcome?
It is interesting, too, that when presented with a question about what

"Thanks," says Sam. "I'll just...yup. Thanks. We'll, uh...we'll be back tomorrow morning. I'll text." Then he's gone, closing the door quietly behind him, and it's just me and Cas again.
He was angry that Cas hadn't

He hums, a guttural, animalistic sound, as my fingers find purchase in his hair, and I can hear myself panting; moaning; begging;

I mean, obviously there’s Mom, and Dad, and Bobby, and all the other friends we’ve found along the way--there are other people I
Cas is gone.
But no other information is forthcoming. And it's that patience again: Cas can wait forever. Dean can't.
He smiles again, and rests his forehead against mine. His hand climbs from my hip to my lower back, inviting me to press closer against him. I do, but I also slip a hand between us to wrap my fingers lightly around his thickening cock; closing my eyes, concentrating on the weight of him, and the way his soft skin catches on my palm.
I feel that the best thing I can do is wait, and try to remain unthreatening, so that is what I do. I let him place tentative hands on my shoulders. I ignore the goosebumps that course over my skin as he lets his fingers wander over my torso. His touch is careful; he traces the lines of my collarbone and the muscles of my chest, though he shies away from my nipples.

I feel like I might throw up. That twister in my stomach is sending shrapnel and debris all over the goddamn place. "Matter? Sure, maybe. But...but that

I smirk at him. "I'd rather you did it."
I'm pretty sure--like, eighty percent sure--that when I woke up, at 2 a.m. or whenever, he was still there, warm beside me. I think I said something, although I can't remember what, and he stroked my hair until I fell asleep again.
. But he's too respectful for the middle one. He gets weird about dirty talk if he's not already in the, uh, zone. And the other two just aren't enough to show him how much I care, or what he means to me. They'd feel hollow. Words are too limited to express what we have. We talk better with our bodies.
"Shit, Cas," I mutter to the empty room, "what
This made Dean profoundly uncomfortable. He proceeded to go into hiding for several hours, refusing to talk to any of us, until eventually Sam was able to coax him back out and assuage his embarrassment by taking him on an interstate hunting trip.
Fireworks. Whiteness. Darkness. Everything and nothing. A mess on his stomach, some high and some low; some of it dripping down between us, where our skin meets; adding a new wetness to the gross squelching of him moving inside me as my body convulses. I'm vaguely aware of the sound of my voice, distorted by pleasure--that I've made a lot of noise, and that even now, my ecstatic panting is loud.
...Understand him better.

Dean whimpers.
I lie back against the pillows, which makes me as well-lit as I can be in the dim light. The third time, as they say, is the charm, and I raise my hips obediently as Dean divests me of my trousers.
"Tell me what you want, Dean."
He begins to shift his weight; I feel the ripple of restrained strength as his hand moves to my chest, then my shoulder, with a pressure that is more of a gentle inquiry than a statement; a nudge rather than a push, as he tests for my reaction. I understand the question, though, and the answer is
Cas sort of has an excuse. He doesn't really know how to 'people', which isn't his fault. And on top of that, I think he's scared. There's been a few times when things have gone south between him and Dean. I don't mean minor disagreements, either. I mean
Cas hesitates, biting his lip, before he rumbles in a low voice, "Dean, about Sam...He already knows. He already
Dean will never in a million years admit to another living soul how that look of pure, unadulterated affection makes him feel. Never. Chick-flick moments are not his thing. But there’s that little niggle in the back of his throat and the corners of his eyes, because an angel’s love is…well, it’s overwhelming. All that time he spent, thinking that angels didn’t know how to love like humans do. He was half-right, as it turned out: angels
Of course, as soon as he does, he feels Cas’ eyes slide back to him, and a renewed prickling sensation rises from his tailbone to the base of his skull.

When I woke up the next morning, he was gone. Fair enough, I guess. He doesn't sleep. If I didn't sleep, I wouldn't just spend all night lying around while someone else got their eight hours. Not that I usually get eight hours. And I
In the sudden darkness, he's breathless; pulsating in my hand; shuddering, shaking, and still holding onto me like I'm the only thing keeping him together.
. Dean Winchester the libertine is not, and never has been, Dean Winchester the beloved. In his shyness I see vestiges of what he must have been like, before he began to believe so deeply that he was unloved and unloveable.
Dean's chest aches. His throat is tight. His eyes sting, and he can't breathe. He wants to scream, to throw something, to smash the chair into the wall, to smash
"You're tired, Dean. You should rest."
"Uh-huh. And...is Sam the only one who knows?"
"Cas," Dean breathes, "are you sure...is it really okay? I don't want to hurt you."

He pulls his head back to look at me as I stir, and I look up at him blearily. His mouth

I mean, the upside is Sam is taking Jack out. Which does mean we've got the bunker to ourselves.
Cas looks slightly awkward at that. "Yes."
For the first time I can remember, I sleep through the night. I guess I might have woken up at some point, but if I did, I don't remember it.
I leave the bunker first thing in the morning. Pack a couple of bags and head to Iowa. I need to
The penny drops.
Yes, this is best. Deep and hard, like everything else they have been through together.
"My turn to be flattered," I say against his throat. I squeeze his cock as I suck at the tender skin where his jaw meets his neck, and he writhes against me, a note of urgency creeping into his moan.
Cas wriggles back a little to rest the back of his head on the bedframe, tilting his chin at me, his eyes questioning.
Suddenly he's nudging at that place again, and those waves are back, lapping at my senses; a quivering all through my body; fingers, toes, scalp, stomach...The arousal magnifies everything. I can feel each individual drop of sweat on my skin now, along with the frighteningly intimate feeling of every detail of every inch of him.
"Well, I'm sorry, anyway," he'd said, sincerely. "I didn't mean to make anyone uncomfortable. I'm glad, Cas. You both seem so much
quiet."
Tonight, though...forget about butterflies. Tonight it's fireflies. Actually, just fire. Like there's flames licking up the insides of my stomach.
When I get back down to his belt, I stop and wriggle off his lap to stand in front of him.
I couldn't have answered his question even if I'd wanted to.
His fingers twitch in his sleep, fingernails scraping lightly against the fabric of my trousers.
I'm already reaching for his cock. I don't have enough blood going to my brain to even work my own hands--I'm too slow; too clumsy, but Cas takes over, pressing the pulsing head of his cock against me, both of us groaning as he slides in. I grab for him, one hand around the back of his neck, and the other arm wrapped around his shoulders. Braced against him like this,  I can draw him deeper inside me, sliding down his hot shaft, feeling every bulging vein pushing at the surface of his dick; every coarse curl of downstairs fuzz. He's reaching under me, trying to pull me closer, and I lift my weight to let his strong arms slip under my body.
into the wall.
And for every pair of these stupid questions, nine times out of ten I end up clicking on an answer which reminds me of something to do with him.
I don't resist, rising to my feet and leaning over the armchair to kiss him. My mouth feels sort of swollen. The sensations of kissing him are different as a result. This mouth is, presumably, not accustomed to performing the kinds of acts that I just made it do.
"...Oh."
read it. And if this is all Sam's stupid book's fault, then to understand what the hell is going on, I'll have to read it. I need to know what kinds of screwy ideas he's put in Cas' head.
I'm not ready to try reading it again yet, but on its cover the book's got a sticker advertising an online 'Love Languages quiz', so I decide to do that instead. And the second I get to the website I'm definitely not comfortable with the amount of purple I'm seeing. But I've started now, so I click my way into the ‘Singles Edition’ and feed in my details.
." His fingers bite roughly into my shoulders, and he pushes down into my touch. I have never felt anything like the shudder that courses through him then, and he makes no attempt to control the his volume as he cries out, gasping with a pleasure that makes me ache in unspeakable ways.
Cas--soft; glowing--back to Castiel, Angel of the Lord, Commander of the Garrison--icy; commanding--and Dean gets up, meekly, to take his jeans the rest of the way off and to do as he's told.
Cas kisses back. Still hard, still hot, still scruffy, but most importantly, still
Nope, still can't say it. Can't say any of it. I hope you're listening, Cas. I hope you can hear me. I hope you know. I hope I get my shit together enough to be able to say it to you out loud, one day, but today is not that day.
Eventually, he returns from his personal heaven to an earthly plane, and looks down at me. His eyes are shining in the firelight. Sweat glistens on his forehead. I do not expect him to reach out to me, but he does; pulling me up by my tie and my shoulder, his lips hungry for mine.
I fully intend to reply with actual words, but I don't
"Whatever you need from me, Dean, is yours. You know that."
"You don't have to explain. Actually, maybe it's better if you don't. Just...go back to him. Leave me here. Please. I need some peace."
"Dean, I need you to tell me. What can I do for you? My understanding of nonverbal communication is still somewhat deficient."
Gone, and gone for good, into a void where Dean can't follow. Purgatory is one thing. Dean has been to hell, and he's been to Purgatory. There are doors into those, and he can find them. By god, he'd find them. But the Empty? That's angel-exclusive. Dean has no ticket to that ride.
Whatever love language I'm speaking, he understands it; his teeth graze my thumb pad, and his eyes close as his tongue folds around my finger; a slight hollowing of the cheeks as he sucks me in for one long, warm, wet moment. Then it's over, but his blue eyes are fixed on mine again.
I end my sentence with a long, crazy moan as he guides the red-hot head of his cock to my asshole.
Dean and Cas are sitting on opposite sides and at opposite ends of the table. They are both studiously ignoring each other, and both wearing expressions that I've only ever seen on toddlers before. Dean's is somewhere between sad and cranky, while Cas just looks lost and confused. Dean is hiding behind a laptop that he barely knows how to use, and Cas is staring dejectedly off into the middle distance. Both of them are silently nursing cups of black coffee.
"Don't, Cas," I mumble into the pillow. "You stroke me like that and I'll fall asleep."
I sense that he needs reassurance, so I start with that. "I would like that, Dean. Very much." I let my fingers trail down his sides to rest on the subtle curve of his waist, then slide them backwards, applying gentle pressure to the hard knots of muscle either side of his spine with my fingertips. "However, we still need to talk about what happened."
slowly, he's pushing a wet fingertip between my asscheeks, and drawing tender, loving circles around my asshole, the tight ring of muscle twitching involuntarily. He's still got my balls in his other hand, massaging firmly with the pad of his thumb, the heel of his palm, and I can hear my heartbeat pounding; feel the rush of blood down south; feel my nerves singing under his touch. My breathing is getting ragged, filling up the silence of the room along with the wet sound of his sluiced-up skin on mine.
He stared at her for a second. When he realized her face only showed confidence he could make it right instead of disappointment that he’d messed up in the first place, he nodded. He could do this.
A little while later, Dean was marveling at how much Cas had just sort of blossomed in the short time he’d known him. The people they visited had always liked Cas, but now Cas was quietly joking with old man Enoch like he’d always done it. Dean couldn’t help the smile that tugged at the corners of his mouth, watching Cas. The elder man was also smiling, but if he was surprised by Cas’ newfound social ease, he made no mention of it.
“Hey, Mom.”
It was different, kissing in private. For one thing, they held eye contact as their faces moved toward each other. There was more hesitation as well, on both sides, and Cas could for the first time see a mix of fear, excitement and awe on Dean’s face. Hope sprung up in Cas’s chest at the sight. Maybe Dean did return his feelings, he thought.
Dean groaned and latched onto Cas’s neck again, this time with teeth and sharp suction. As he sucked, he laved at the skin with his tongue.
“Dean?” he called softly, even though he knew Dean was still awake.
♫Caaaaan you feeeeeel the loooooooooooooooove toniiiiiiiiiight?♪ Yep, definitely on an accomplishment high. Or my fever is back up. Either way, talk to me!! *whines* ♥
“What’s wrong, angel? You usually like it so much when I’m kneeling,” Dean teased.
“Dean!” his mother called from downstairs.
On the way back to the dorm, evidently Cas could tell that Dean’s bad mood was more than his standard “Little brother just left” sadness. As soon as they were inside, Cas asked him what else was troubling him. Dean took a moment to reflect that he liked the way Cas talked even though it was weird sometimes. Then he set the distraction aside.
The weather had turned nasty on Castiel’s walk from his office building. A perfect “cherry on the shit sundae” his day had been.
It had been less than a week since Cas had his weird dream and took off. Dean was dealing with it better than he’d expected—and better than Sam had seemed to expect too—which he put down to the good talk they’d had before Cas left. They’d established that Cas would return, which was more than he’d really ever gotten out of the angel in the past.
Dean’s hands slid out of Castiel’s shirt, leaving him cold, but Cas didn’t stop him. Only a few minutes later, Dean called a halt to everything and gently pressed Cas off of his lap. Castiel was reluctant to go, but he could tell that Dean was struggling to hold back his roaming hands and rolling hips at that point. Castiel was struggling himself.
Castiel was not experienced enough in the world to know if Dean had the same interest toward Castiel, but knowing that it was even a
“This way,” Castiel said, walking toward the hallway. “There are many rooms, but they are all essentially the same. This one,” he said, gesturing into the first one on the left, “is likely to have light the longest at the end of the day.”
“What happened to it’s not your business?”
“Um.” He swallowed hard, heart pounding for multiple reasons and eyes wide. “My brother, he—”
He felt in his heart that God was real. His faith in the Creator had not wavered at all.
“Fine! I’m sorry—”
not very upscale, either.”
“Yeah, man. Oh, here, though.”
“Mm. Now me, I’m named after the guy from
“Hey!” Dean called, standing up. “We’re in here!”
I don't need to know about it. This is my happy place and I don't need you polluting my chocolate river, tyvm.
Cas walked over to where Dean was sitting. He slid a hand over Dean’s sweaty brow and up into his hair. Then he pressed a gentle kiss to his forehead.
"Someone's been to therapy," Dean said with a smirk.
“Dean, Castiel will be your guide over the next week, to get you settled in. He will be staying in the dorm with you,” he told them as they boarded the wagon, causing Castiel’s eyes to fly to Jacob in shock. He had not informed Castiel of this earlier. Acknowledging this, Jacob told Castiel, “Your guardians are aware of the arrangement. It is where you will stay for the first half of your time away, anyway, is it not?”
Dean’s face lit up when he heard Castiel’s voice and Cas tried very hard not to make it obvious how happy that made him. He couldn’t help the answering smile, however.
“Yes, please,” Cas answered, believably breathless.
MACHINE
“Cas, hey, wait. I didn’t start liking you just because you lived here, all right? If I’d met you any other way, I’d have liked you just the same. Sam would have too. And all our other friends.” He blew out a breath. “But I know I was being a jerk about Meg. I’d never make you give up a friend, man. I’m not some psycho asshole, I swear, I just... I’m scared you’re gonna outgrow me when we get to college.”
“I had a dream that I worked in a coffee shop and you impregnated me with your tentacles,” Cas snapped. “Pray tell me what kind of assistance you could offer.” Sarcasm was the icing on the bitter cake of his words.
He felt a sense of family with them, of
Cas grabbed Dean's T-shirt and cleaned them up, then collapsed forward, half-draped over Dean and half on the bed. He lay there quiet, breath ghosting across Dean's chest for a few minutes, while Dean alternately petted and kissed his dark hair.
Dean walked over and slapped Sammy on the back. "Don't worry. After a few years servitude as our butler, today will seem like just a nice dream you once had."
Cas rolled his eyes and huffed. “I use an orange tree chew stick to brush my teeth everyday and I chew mint leaves because I like the taste.”
Dean barely had time to swallow before Cas was on him, kissing him until he saw spots around the edges of his vision because he forgot to breathe. He pushed Cas far enough away to draw a deep breath.
Dean grinned. “Dude, you talk like a grownup. Hey, you wanna go out back and play on the swing set?”
Cas stared at him for a few moments, mouth opening and closing occasionally as he started to speak and stopped, over and over again. “You would really live like the Amish for me? Sell your car and all your possessions to make that life with me?” he finally asked, searching Dean’s face intently.
“Yep. I ever hear anything out of that bedroom, though, you’re paying for my therapy, kid,” Bobby teased and made Dean groan.
“We were not dating when I met all of you previously,” Cas said when Dean couldn’t continue. “The truth is, I put out an ad offering services and Dean responded and—” He locked eyes with Dean, mouth turning up just slightly at the corners. “—then we kind of fell for each other in the process.”
“Oh. Um, you sure?”
Aaron said it as if he hadn’t just plunked Dean’s world upside down. Cas never hesitated, though. His hand started working its way up and down Dean’s side, sometimes just softly stroking, other times a barely there kneading. Dean’s heart, which had started to slow while he was concentrating on positioning himself, now stopped and restarted, thundering in his chest like a herd of something wild.
He didn’t know what the guy did while they were behind the stage, but when they walked back out to manic cheers, Blue Eyes was still in the same spot, looking like he hadn’t moved a muscle.
Cas was, however, still Amish. And the plain people did not allow homosexuality. Cas would never stop being Amish, Dean was sure. So getting involved with him was a sure fire way to get his heart broken but good. Dean couldn’t. And it made life hard.
Still, Dean coaxed him on, making suggestions on speed and roughness that Cas sometimes took and sometimes chose to ignore. Within a few minutes, Dean was an incoherent, needy mess again. Dean was surprised at himself. He loved sex, but he never begged for it like this. He was certainly begging now. And whining. And generally feeling like a needy slut who couldn’t get enough.
Cas tried to calm himself, but it didn’t work. He just waved Dean away, face red. Dean rolled his eyes, but he was grinning. It really hadn’t been all that funny, but it must be one of those hysterical things. Dean would take it as a win, regardless.
Before they could do more talking, Cas kissed him. He kissed him until they were both calm and then worked up again in a different way. Only then did he pull away, panting slightly with the pounding of his heart making it hard to breathe.
“What?” Cas blinked, clearing his mind of the fantasy.
“I can’t tell him how I feel!”
Instead of repeating his words, Cas repeated the kiss. It was slow and tender at times, fevered and fierce at others. The laps of Cas’ tongue against his own seemed to touch him other places, as if Cas was somehow licking his whole body at once, igniting a fire beneath his skin from stem to stern.
“What’s up, doc?” He didn’t even smile at his own lame attempt to lighten the mood.
*schmoops*
As smoking as he looked in his wetsuit, it was a damned shame.
“Uh, those are real?”
“Ha! You don’t know the half of it, man. Thanks for noticing, though.”
Dean was happy to have the day off. He'd been working nonstop for about two weeks, with only a day or two off in the three months before that. He was taking all the shifts he could, trying to add enough to his savings so that he and Cas could put the down payment on a place of their own.
Cas didn’t even falter when he answered, “I have a job lined up already. I will be doing carpentry work for a business there and Dean has promised to help me find my way around the city, so I am excited about visiting the rather large library they have there.”
When Dean woke up, his right arm was asleep and his left arm was trapped under something heavy and hot. There was cool hair tickling his nose and hot breath tickling his chest. Dragging his eyes open brought him back to consciousness and he took in Cas, with whom he was completely entangled. His left arm was trapped by Cas’s arm and his right by Cas’s body. The angel continued sleeping sounding, unaware of Dean’s scrutiny.
“Cas?” he finally managed after a minute. “We can keep going. I want you to come too. I can—”
“Cas, sometimes your eyes are so fucking blue, I can’t stand it. I wanna swim them for days.” Dean looked surprised by the words and stared down into his drink in puzzlement, as if it held the answers.
“Fuck!” Dean said, putting all his frustration with the day into the single word.
“Not your thing, huh?”
Dean cared very much to demonstrate further, and more than once. Cas seemed to be agreeable to the situation.
“You’re welcome,” Sam said quietly.
Dean felt his skin go slightly pink. “They were a prank gift from mom on my last birthday. She even hung them up there.”
"You're not mad about it?" Dean asked hopefully. In truth he really didn't want to be angry with Cas at all.
Dean was completely taken aback.
Dean slapped his knees. “Well, hey, I better get out of your hair so you two can talk. Cas, we need anything for the apartment?”
“We are happy to help people who are looking for a better life,” Jacob told Sam, with a half smile. “Your brother is doing very well here. We are happy to have him with us.” His smile got a little wider. “We are happy to have you with us, as well.”
Dean probably imagined the mocking in his tone. Probably.
“Were you angry with him?”
“The truck can wait,” Cas agreed, peeling of his shirt.
Who the hell did Sammy think he was, anyway? Dean was the older brother. He wasn’t scared of feelings. He just didn’t like them. They hurt and they were messy and look where love had gotten him so far in life. How many things had he fucked up because he loved Sam? How badly had Dad fucked up because he loved Mom and broke when he lost her?
“So... wait,” Michael said. “The ad said you didn’t drink. What the hell did you do with all those cocktails you took?”
“Wait, where is the land?” he asked, worried that it would be too far for him to drive to work.
“Why don’t you taste it and see what you think?”
“Lie down on your side, facing me.”
Bobby had given Dean the next day off, ostensibly so that he could work on packing up the apartment. Dean had a feeling it was more because Bobby knew Dean would be pretty much useless at work, waiting for Cas to come back. Either way, he was grateful not to have to leave to go to work.
“I hate you,” Sam grumbled.
Jacob took it gingerly. “It’s very well done, Castiel. Why a duck, if I may ask?”
“Mm. All right. Well, let him know, see if he’s interested. I can pay him $10 an hour to start. If he’s as good as you say, I’ll bump it up.” Dean heard odd bumps and clinks. “Anything else? It’s my lunch time, boy.”
“How ‘bout that hug, man?” Dean asked in a gruff voice.
“Come on, Dean,” Cas said, walking ahead to the door. “I’m hungry.” The grin he gave then was feral. “And you’ll need your strength for when we get back here later.”
“But, Cas –“
“I love you.” Dean hadn’t been aware he was going to say it out loud, but he’d felt it building in his chest. Years of friendship had finally just coalesced inside him, into a hot ball of pressure that was screaming those words and he’d been helpless against them when they pressed forward and out.
“No! Dean, come back here,” Cas said, dragging him back toward his chest. “I didn’t mean it like that. I mean, I don’t want to
Dean actually smiled at that. “Yeah? Good. That’s... that’s good. I’m glad.” He finished his breakfast quickly after that. “I better get ready. Jacob’s gonna be here any minute.”
“The appetizer is a chilled spicy mango and sweet potato soup. Enjoy.” He set the dish down in front of Dean and smiled before stepping back.
“You’re self-medicating, Dean,” Sam complained.
“Now then, using only your heads to indicate a response, do you both understand?”
Cas smiled. “I look forward to it.” He heard his coffee arrive and pressed the button to add the hot water. “My coffee is here. Thank you for that. Are you sure I can’t pay...?”
“I realized I’ve let him dictate my life for far too long.” He held out his shot glass and waited until Dean filled it. “What he did to me was awful, but—” He downed his second shot. “—I’ve let him control my life and that’s just as awful.” He held out his glass again.
Cas turned to Mary and Sam. “The raisin chick was—” He turned back to Dean. “No, Dean, not even for you. I can’t.”
His guardians shared a look, sad smiles passing between them. It was Pap who spoke first. “Of course you will be, Castiel. To be truthful, we have suspected for some time that once you were out among the English, you would choose to stay there.”
“I’m glad you’re enjoying it. Adding a third finger now. I’ll take it easy.”
“No. Nor can I, Dean. It came so quickly, didn’t it?” He took their mugs and started washing them out. “I’m very happy that the day is finally here, though.” He didn’t turn around, but Dean could see the soft smile that played around his mouth.
“Looks good in here, boys,” Bobby told them when it was all set up. “Now let’s go eat, I’m starving.”
“Gross! Stop! God, you’re a child.”
Castiel squirmed in his bed, unhappy with the change of topic. “We are allowed to date, Dean. I choose not to. I have no interest in taking a wife. When I move back, I intend to live as a bachelor.”
I see Cas cringe a little, and make a note to apologise later.
, and that has to be enough.
Dean lets his arms fall around Cas' neck, and lets their foreheads rest together again. For a few minutes there is nothing else in the world except for the two of them: nothing except warmth and satiation and the wet, hot messes between them. And, in Dean's case, inside him. Which is nice and all, but...
Dean presses his own sweating forehead against Cas', which is smooth and dry. Lets the tips of their noses touch. Pushes his hand down between their stomachs and takes hold of Cas' throbbing erection, and
That underlying aroma flicks a switch and clouds Dean’s senses. It makes his heart race and his breath quicken, like he’s been drowning without it, and desperately needs to fill his lungs with it again.
Yep--part of him was just mad that Cas chose to ask

is even worse. And even if it wasn't, I'm not having
I slide my hand upwards. His quads are hard under my touch. It's like stroking a sun-warmed stone--smooth, but no give. The texture of his skin softens as my hands rises; there's gradually less hair, until my palm is pressed to the pale skin of his uppermost thigh, my fingers resting on his hipbone. The only thing separating us now is the thin cotton of his boxers, their fabric bunched up under the pad of my hand.
But Dean is too aroused to be genuinely irritated, and his exhalations become audibly shaky as Cas pulls the belt free of his trousers and begins to loop it neatly through itself--a figure of eight, with a long tail.

He hums his agreement, his head falling more heavily into my hand. Sleep is stealing over him already.

“Me too.”
I have practised reading his body language, enough to know that there is a difference, albeit minute, between the way he hunches because he is annoyed, and the way he hunches because he feels nervous and uncomfortable.
It sounds more like an accusation than a question. And he's made a mistake. He's exposed his throat.
It's simple: he can't. But now he knows--he knows the name for what he feels--what he

I hear it splash in the distance, but I can't drag my eyes away from his. I feel like I'm pinned to the spot by two big stupid soulful blue javelins.
Cas grab him by the collar and shove him back against the wall. He's the one who spreads his own legs, deliberately shifting to push his crotch against Cas' thigh. He's the one who presses a hand to Cas' junk, his palm and fingers curling when he makes the gratifying discovery that he's already got a semi. He's the one whose skin gets covered in gooseflesh when his gentle pressure makes Cas growl in a way that is both protest and approval.
"Dean," he says, his voice thick and heavy, "many years ago, you said something to me. I've been thinking about it ever since."
"Oh yeah?"
"My feelings for you."
He swallows. I watch the way his Adam's apple moves under his skin, and I experience a moment of clarity. Whatever it is, saying it out loud is exactly what he does
"God," he whispers, pressing their foreheads together.
"You...love me."

Because he loved him, too. He'd never understood it, though, not until
I take another three careful steps forward. We're close again now. Close enough that I could reach out and touch him, though I don't dare. This moment is still too precarious. But I do not look away from him. Instead, he is the one to break eye contact; to look at the ground, his chest rising and falling as his breath quickens.
"Oh, you
"Well...that wasn't quite true. And just now, saying you're my best friend...I...that ain't quite right either.
before the Empty because of the unspoken thing between the two of them, and he certainly hasn’t been with anyone else since he got him back.
I look up at Dean's face. His neck. The dip of his collarbone. "Please," I add.
As though in the distance, I hear him grind out my name once more, with a particular note of bewilderment and ecstacy. He's coming with me; the shockwaves of pleasure rippling through me creating the epicentre of his own shuddering orgasm. Through half-shut eyes, I see the tendons in his neck straining; eyelids fluttering; lips parted, lost in awe...I feel the wet heat as he unloads inside me, and I close my eyes, too, savouring the sensations as he goes slack, collapsing against me, burying his face in the crook of my neck as his heart pounds against my ribcage.

Perhaps the best thing I can do for him is relieve him of the burden of choice.

"Alright, look, Cas. Let me stop you there. I heard you and Sam, that night."
I tilt his chin upwards, forcing him to focus on my face.
...Oh.
I have never been rendered speechless by a blowjob before.
The second time, the time after Cas betrayed them to try and become a 'new and improved' God, using the souls from Purgatory...Well, that time was messed up. When it happened, Dean was angry and confused. But because of the
"Fine," he mutters. "Talk."
He steps forward and runs a finger along Dean's collarbone. Lets the finger be joined by its friends, and trace its lazy way down to his left nipple, and then lower...dropping, dropping, to pause on his hip.
Cas hums. It's like a song in a single note. I’m annoyed by the fact that I can’t stop myself from finding it soothing.
He turns his head to look at me, and holds it aloft.
--deep. God, so deep. It's like his throat is beckoning to me. His hands are heavy as he pushes them roughly up my thighs to slide his fingers through my belt-loops, pulling my hips forward.

"I don't
He's gone.
I can feel myself reddening, and I don't like it. "Screw you, Cas."
I'm shocked by the intensity of it, but I'm on autopilot, following my instincts and rocking gently, moving my body around him while he pulses inside me.
It is flattering to see the traces of lust in his eyes, unfurling just as a plant does when it bursts through the shell of a seed to raise its green leaves above the earth. "But you--you're--"

I rest my palm on his thigh, just above the knee. The coarse hair under my hand is unfamiliar. I'm used to women's shaved legs; may a bit of prickle from regrowth or something. But Cas is just straight-up fuzzy. It's weird. Not unpleasant, but weird.

"Don't."
"I told you I was fine."
I'm too used to him now. When I reach out, and he's not there...That's a level of hopelessness I've never felt before, and I don't ever want to feel again.
Cas’ immeasurable strength is more than up to the task of supporting him. Dean’s physical exertion is starting to cause little droplets of sweat to form on his skin, but those beads of sweat starting to glisten on Cas' forehead like a crown have nothing to do with physical effort--he’s just trying to contain himself; trying to let Dean call the shots.
clothes. It's not quite the same level of 'this belongs to...' as Cas etching his name into Dean's soul, but it'll do.
Dean moans as his dick pulses. His jeans are too restrictive. He reaches down, fumbling; his free hand on autopilot. Belt buckle. Button. Zipper.
His other hand is still busy encouraging Cas' erection. It's awkward, but Dean one-handedly manages to get his jeans and underwear halfway down his thighs.
"What do you want me to do to you, Cas?"
All I say is "Cas", but I also kiss him, and I hope he understands.
The thought makes me ache with lust. And I mean

My mouth is suddenly dry; my stomach dropping through the floor. "Perhaps I, uh...perhaps I misunderstood. This-this is why I thought it was important to--to talk about it." I pause, trying to dam the flood of wretched disappointment. "I apologise. I was mistaken. Of course you don't...don't want that."
“I just did,” I retort, but it’s got no sizzle--it’s more like a confession, really.
“I’m just…appreciating you.”
I don't know if it's the way he smells, or the way that his body feels, or the warmth of his skin, or the whole damn lot of it, but something about him leaves me feeling too warm, and trembly in my core.

I wrap him in my arms, trying to steady my breathing.
"Shit," I say, "
Cas' eyes have opened wide. He has that thing going where he's kind of trying to avoid my gaze, but at the same time he can't look away, so he's just getting more and more flustered. To be fair, I guess I don't usually come on so strong. And he's got that thing about putting me first. About giving. About doing things
"Would that be alright with you?"
"Sam and I. We've been trying to contact you all week. Have you been avoiding us, Dean?"
Oh, he'll crack alright.
Cas nods in reply, so Dean extricates himself gently. The couch has suffered already, and matters do not improve when Dean pulls free of Cas' body, but that will have to be a tomorrow problem.
Cas is genuinely puzzled, but he relents quickly when Dean gives him an exasperated look and says, "Because you're about to start dripping

Dean smiles and huffs a laugh when I remind him that I don't need to breathe, but I can see that he is still mostly elsewhere. Periodically, another shudder courses through him. I marvel at the waves of pleasure radiating from him, and bask in the secondhand glow.
"I love you, Dean."
I wonder, is it hard for him to believe that somebody enjoyed giving him pleasure? Or is it hard for him to hear because it's me? Because my vessel is a man? Or is it because we were friends before I told him that I love him?
"Kill the lights, Cas. They're too bright."
"Whatever." I scoff into my whisky. "Cas, you didn't seriously come all this way to check up on me, did you?"
Dean whimpers. It's a pained, strangled sound. He kisses Cas again in a desperate attempt to muffle the sound, clutching the angel's body crushingly close.
, and he can't -- he can't -- he's cumming; spurting messily onto their chests and stomachs, and
Try anything once, right?
"Please, Dean. Tell me what I can do for you."
"Cas, it's
Dean's looking for cases. His self-imposed job has always been his favourite distraction.
Cas' lips and teeth brush lightly over his skin.
"Makes two of us," I mutter.
Dean smiled a little. “Wasn’t a dream, baby. Sat right here and said it.” He surged forward and pressed his lips to Cas’s, then pulled back just far enough to speak. “I love you.” Then he sat all the way back. “But your coma breath is atrocious, dude.”
“At least tell me your name,” Dean said, bending down to retrieve some of the fallen books.
By the time Lisa got home the mess had been cleaned up, but Dean had not ended his kale-destruction with a single squashed bunch. He’d made his way through seven of the ten bunches. When he’d surveyed the damage, and realized he had to hide all the evidence—lest Lisa ask why—he’d never been more grateful for his garbage disposal.
That was apparently just what Cas needed to find his own orgasm and his come mixed with Dean’s between their chests and on Dean’s hand. When it was over, he collapsed forward, uncaring of the mess they made as their chests pressed together wetly.
Dean patted himself down, praying he’d retained his satellite phone. He’d had it when he got on the raft, he knew, but anything at all could have happened between now and then. Finally, he found it, way down in the bottom of the middle pocket of his cargo pants. He’d been able to reach Sam from the middle of the ocean yesterday, so he knew the phone was good. Now to see if the waterproof case he’d splurged on was too.
“I’m free now,” Cas said, eyes crinkling.
"Damn, Cas. I had no idea. No wonder my coming out to my dad was such a big deal to you."
“Damn, man, you got Cas
They made quick work of their pants after that, leaving Cas naked—he hadn’t been wearing any underwear at all—and Dean in his lace-edged boy shorts.
Cas may not have known why he started telling Dean his secrets, but by the time he was done, he was pretty sure he knew why he’d continued talking once he’d started. On Dean’s face, he had seen curious interest in what Cas was saying, and maybe mild concern for Cas’s well-being—but no pity and definitely no disgust.
EDIT: Oops, I meant to say wing!
Victor leaned in close, concern on his face. “It’s not like you to daydream, man. You all right?”
When his mom came into the room, she had a couple of bottles of salad dressing in one hand, and she quickly took the pizza cutter from him with the other. She waited for Cas to set his burdens down and then she made quick work of dividing up the pizza into neat, even slices. His mom was nothing like a stereotypical housewife and never had been, not even when their dad was alive, but she could cook like she was born to it.
The black and white posters each showed a greased up, topless model in cut off denim shorts. One model was male and the other female. That was his mom’s way of clearing the air of any doubt that she supported him one hundred percent, without them having to actually talk about it.
“Who?” Crowley barked.
“Uh, you got into clown college?”
Mary laughed, winking at Dean in approval. “Yes, you may. Just come back in time for supper. Let’s let Ellen say goodbye to Castiel first, though, okay?”
a child. He shook off the thoughts and enjoyed Liza’s reactions to the stories he read. Her mother finally called a halt, saying the little girl needed to rest. He was relieved, but also a little disappointed. He’d been enjoying himself, even if his voice was tired. He ruffled her hair as he said goodbye, basking in her adoring smile.
“Don’t know much about God, aside from the fact that I don’t see him around much,” Dean said with a smirk. “But I don’t mind helping people. I used to be good at it, once upon a time.”
“Relax, baby bear, I’m not hear to out you. He obviously can’t see it, but I’m a bartender. I see everything,” she told him, wiping down a glass as she waited for his order. “And I can see you got it bad for that pretty man over there.”
“You make a good point. Race you?”
“I’ll tell you how much I want you to fuck me. Is that what you wanna know?”
“Y-your Majesty. Are you sure it’s all right if Sammy comes inside with me?”
Side note: I've closed out the chapters, not because I'm necessarily done, but so that it will show up for people who don't read WIPs. I feel like there are enough stand-alones in here to justify calling it not a WIP, right? Anyway, don't despair that it's over. It's not. ♥
“Dean, after doing a lot of thinking and praying on the matter, I have come to the conclusion that any continued relationship between us would be ill-advised. I should never have allowed things to progress this far and, as I will be leaving to go home in a short period of time, I think it would be best if we went back to being just friends.”
Dean scoffed. “This? This is nothing. You should have experienced the Great Prank War of 2011. Now
Castiel sat, frozen. He could not speak. He did not know if he should try to deny it, to pretend he did not understand or just confirm it and let himself be shunned. Yet another decision he was ill-equipped to make. Jacob saved him the trouble.
He sat in the floor model. “I will take one in tan, please.”
He continued to frown at her as she handed him the drinks, but she just smiled and took the hat back off his head.
Based on
Cas sipped his beer for a moment, then shrugged. “She was very hurt, as I’m sure you can imagine. And angry.” He shook his head. “She calmed down before I left, but I didn’t do very well by her, Dean.”

“We’re in luck, come on. You go first and then I’ll go. When you get through, go straight into the woods and don’t—”
The year Dean turned ten, his mom and dad called a family meeting on what seemed like just a random Wednesday, just after school had let out for the year.
When the door opened, Cas didn’t see him at first. As soon as he noticed Dean, he startled and stared, looking terrified.
“Just that I can’t wait to try this stuff,” Dean said, trying a smile on for size. He thought it didn’t quite fit on his face.
“Cas!” Dean hissed, mortified.
“I almost decided to come back,” Cas admitted.
friends with Charlie Bradbury? Geez, man, I know I talk a lot of shit, but you know me better than that.”
“I see,” Cas said, pulling back.
Sam arrived only an hour or so later, and they had a wonderful visit with him. Cas, Dean and Bobby all had to work the next day, but Sam was able to tag along with Cas or Dean for a lot of their work. At lunch time, the four of them went to sign the apartment paperwork and get the keys. Dean had some things stored at Bobby’s and Bobby promised to help them move everything on Saturday.
“Aw, fuck!”
“Wait, wait. I don’t—” He shook his head and pulled Cas to his feet and into a kiss when he saw the disappointment on Cas’s face. “No, I don’t want to stop, I just want you naked too. Please?” Without waiting for an answer, he kicked off his shoes and then pulled off his jeans and socks.
“Ok, Deano. Let’s get me home,” she agreed with a flirty smile. “We’ll try again later, right?”
Dean made a face, but Castiel couldn’t tell if it was the reminder of the detention facility, the reminder of his past mistakes or just the reminder that his brother had been subject to being inside the facility himself, in order to see Dean.
Anyway, this is the end of this one! Don't know which one I'll work on next, but I am going to post it here and NOT in a new one, okay? Okay.
Cas stuck his tongue out, a gesture he had learned from Sam. Dean belly laughed and his eyes sparkled in a way that Castiel wanted to paint and hang on the wall. It was a new sensation for him, but one he found he did not mind.
“Oh! That’s lovely. Husband, then,” Ava corrected with a wink. “Even better.” She waved at a naked man who was walking down the hallway. “Hi, Mortie! Got a couple newbies for your class today!”
“Hello, Dean.”
It had been a couple of months since Castiel’s first meeting with Dean and things were going well. In the end, Castiel had moved both Dean and Sammy into the castle. Dean had been an easy choice for Inias’s nanny and Castiel couldn’t bear the idea of the brothers being separated, as close as they were. However, after one meeting with John Winchester, he had resolutely refused to allow him to stay in the castle with them. Castiel sent John to a cabin in the woods to sober up and told him that he could live in the room above the stable if he learned to behave himself. He was only allowed to visit his children once a week and never unsupervised. That seemed to be working out nicely.
“Shut up, boy. You don’t gotta thank me. We’re family.” But Dean saw the small smile he tried to hide behind his beard.
“Did you now? And what became of that?” Jacob asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
tell me who my friends are.”
“Dammit, boy, don’t press that fucking button! Garth, goddammit, if you do that, it’s gonna cut off communica—”
“I can text them, see if that’s urgent?” It was clear from her voice she’d rather go.
“You little fucker,” Dean said, strictly because he knew Castiel would laugh.
—slip into his mouth, he came back to himself a bit, but he was still powerless not to indulge.
Cas nodded.
Dean sighed and stretched a foot out to the side of the table. “I can tell you. Not... not about my parents. Not right now. I can tell you the rest of it, though. It’s complicated and not a very happy story and…it probably won’t make me look very good.”
Michael laughed and shook his head. “Oh, well, in a way it is, but not the way you think.” He looked up at Dean and winked. “Seems Kate decided they needed to take a holiday retreat. I’m not supposed to say where, but it sounds like ‘hee-rab.’”
“Mom, can I borrow your phone?” Sam asked.
Dean just took the opportunity to lunge forward slightly in order to kiss Cas again. Cas relaxed and kissed back instantly. Dean had only meant for it to be a quick thing to distract his... whatever Cas was, but Cas apparently had other—better—ideas.
When Sam got out, he called back, “Let me know how tomorrow goes, Dean!” before he was off to his parents’ car.
They talked about random things while Dean washed their few dishes then rinsed, dried and put them away. When they were done, neither of them was in the mood to stay up any longer. Castiel went to the bathroom to change into night clothes while Dean stayed in the bedroom to do the same.
," Cas whispered, reverently. Even just seeing his name caused a muted version of that pull in Cas's gut.
That still didn’t tell Dean whether it was male or female, but at least he knew they had good taste. He smirked to himself as he typed.
Once Dean left, however, Cas sat on the couch for a long time staring at the number written on the paper in his hand and not picking up the phone. When he finally did dial, he could hardly breathe for how hard his heart was pounding.
“And Sam? He gets money, too?”
“Hello, Dean!” Pap said, taking Dean’s hand and shaking it heartily. “You’re the Englisher that Castiel is helping, right? It’s good to meet you.” Castiel was pleased by his guardians’ reactions to Dean, even if he was a bit bemused by Mam’s. “Just follow Castiel’s instructions and you’ll do fine.”
Surprise and relief coursed through Dean and he felt his shoulders relax. “Man, all this time I’ve been feeling so nervous because this was all uncharted territory for me and you seemed so experienced,” he said with a small laugh. “Turns out it’s new for both of us. C’m’ere, Cas.”
“And hey, uh, sorry about your sister and all that. I do remember about her. I know she was... intense.”
Dean could certainly understand that feeling.
“They overcharged you for the kale. They’ve got ten bunches on here!” she said, holding up the crumpled receipt.
"You gotta help me, Sammy," Dean said before his brother could even finish saying hello. "Sam, sorry."
“Dean Winchester, you are my boyfriend and I love you, but you can
“We know what we’re doing, Bobby. He still plans to go back to the village at the end of his time. I know that and he knows that. We – it’s just temporary. We just wanna…I don’t know…enjoy it while we can.” Dean ran a frustrated hand through his hair.
They left it at kissing for the night and with Sam there and church to go to the next night, they barely even did that. Dean didn’t mind, though he did miss Cas sleeping in his bed whenever Sam came to stay.
“Do your muscles feel better?”
“Ha! Okay, coming up.” Dean wanted to keep flirting, he really did, but the guy made him nervous. Not in a bad way, but he seemed to keep getting flustered. He hadn’t felt this level of attraction for a guy in a long time, if ever. There was something about those eyes.
“Are you going to change your mind later about wanting to live plain?” Dean asked softly. “If you decide to stay with me now, are you going to turn around and go back later? You already changed your mind once.”
“All right, what can I get you boys to eat?”
Dean felt his stomach twist and realized the opportunity to ask his question had arrived, though not in the way he’d expected. “So, does that bother you, then? Seeing dudes, uh, making out or whatever?”
say his name out loud when he could see him.
“Cas, you don’t know how many times I dreamed about this. Holding you, I mean.” He glanced down to find Cas staring up at him. “I mean, the sex too, yeah, but mostly just this. Being allowed to have this right here. Used to lay here at night and imagine you coming across the hall and just asking me to. And I’d wait till I thought you were asleep to whisper that I loved you... but you’d hear me and tell me you loved me back.”
“Sure, sweetie what for?”
“Would you like to recreate more of the dream now? I believe having your penis in my mouth would be most pleasurable.” He inclined his head. “And vice versa.”
Dean didn't even sound like himself. His voice was at least an octave higher, maybe two, and softer by far. Cas had never heard anything more beautiful, he thought, than Dean in the grip of want. He couldn't wait to hear him come, hard and fast and on Cas's cock.
Court went so quickly that Dean barely took it in. Jacob repeated the things he had said before in new phrases and the judge looked more relaxed than Dean had ever seen him. Still, Dean was nervous when it was the judge’s turn to speak to him and declare a verdict on whether Dean was released. He knew he’d earned it, but he’d been burned before.
, Cas!”
Cas wanted to beg, but he bit his lip instead. He wasn’t going to safeword. He could do this. He had asked for this. But,
Dean’s hand reached over and squeezed Castiel’s knee. “Relax, man. He’s your brother. He loves you. If you think it’ll help, I can go ahead and go now.”
“So, how’d it go at the orchard?”
“Damn, Cas, I would let you, but I don’t have any way of letting you in. My ex went a little nutty and I had to get the locks changed. Do you need me to spot you the cash for a hotel? I can transfer it on my phone.”
Cas suckled at him for another thirty seconds or so before slowly sliding off. His voice when he spoke was even deeper than before, courtesy of Dean’s dick in his throat, no doubt.
Castiel smiled. “Face the wall. Hands above your head. Good.”
He suspected the man to whom this particular ass was attached would be the same.
He didn’t get to finish because Cas pinned him against the door and proceeded to kiss him. All thoughts fled Dean’s brain save one:
? No. No way.” Gabriel’s expression began at shocked and morphed its way through confusion before finally landing on giddiness. “Who is the best big brother in the world, huh? Me, that’s who. I dragged your ass here, right?” Gabriel’s face fell. “Please tell me he knows about—”
“Right?” Dean asked, keeping his voice low. “And he’s freaking hot, man.”
“You haven’t,” Cas said.
what I’m getting at. I don’t know why you persist in making me talk about my feelings. Dean was right about you. You are pushy.”
They were big words on a young boy’s tongue, but Castiel knew they were not just mimicked from one of his adoptive parents. Sam used those words because he knew those words and Castiel thought Dean had cause for his obvious pride in his brother’s intelligence. He knew instinctively not to draw attention to Dean’s contribution to Sam’s education.
“I think... if I tell him about the apartment, and make sure that I come over to see him a lot... I think he’ll be okay with it. He’s the only reason I even considered it, instead of turning her down right away.” He wiped a hand down his face. “I think I’m gonna take a bath and go to bed. Thanks for, you know, everything.”
to kiss me?” Castiel, incredibly powerful angel of the Lord, sounded small and scared and sad and Dean felt like the world’s biggest asshole, even more than he usually did.
Before he could think better of it or stop himself, Dean said, “Yeah? Well, next time you’re wearing a pair let me know and we’ll put it to the test again.”
Pretty soon, they were recreating his dream fairly accurately, though Dean quickly realized that the reality was a thousand times better than the dream. He was loving kissing the real Cas so much he wasn’t even sure if he wanted to go any further yet. Then Cas’s wings started caressing him again and he decided maybe they would have more time for kissing after other activities were finished.
But he’d
, it was called. Dean shook his head.
The rescuers may have been surprised to find them naked and entwined the next morning, but if so, they were polite enough not to mention it.
After about eighty years of sheer torture that made Dean’s forty years in hell feel almost like a picnic, class was finally over. They had other activities, but not for a couple of hours and Dean needed to talk to Cas about how well he was selling the whole relationship thing. In a word:
. Except that they were sexualizing the stinger, which doesn’t even make any kind of sense because if a bee stings, it loses its stinger and it dies and there isn’t anything sexy about losing your penis or dying, so I don’t—”
When they finally pulled away from each other they were breathless, and they didn't say a word for a long time as they both looked at each other before turning watching out the front of the window.
When the two finally make it to the hotel room, it's nearly six am. Castiel walks in the room before Dean, yawning as he drops his bag on the floor and stripping off his pants and his shoes before plopping on the one bed in the room, Dean copies his exact actions, dropping on the bed next to him, falling asleep almost as soon as Castiel does, which is instantly.
Dean listened to every one of them and smiled, complimenting Castiel every time. He liked hearing them, learning how Castiel thought, and more importantly how he thought of Dean.
"Uh, do you mind if I sit with you.." Dean questions, looking nervous of being within three feet of Castiel, as if it should be a secret for just the two of them to know.
It was probably four in the after noon by then, and due to being winter, it was partially dark. Castiel sits up fully as Dean hands him a cup. Dean sips his coffee, opening the window and frowning to see it's just getting dark, the sky filled with dull reds and maybe even a little purple.
"Cas?" Dean questions, not breaking his eyes from Castiels.
Castiel speaks up after a few minutes of silence, looking over to Dean. "What did we stop for?" He questions. Dean looks at him, sighing softly. "Food" He answers, before moving to get out of the car, Castiel following after him.
"Yeah.." Cas trails off, also not moving his eyes from Deans green ones.
'I could lean in. I could just kiss him.'
It seemed this would work for the two, the feelings the they both obviously had were swallowed down as Dean swore he didn't want to cheat on Lisa to himself, but he could practically feel that promise melting away the closer he got to the angel-like man, Castiel knew of Lisa, so he never tried to come on to Dean, even though it was very obvious the two were more then attracted to each other, some people even thought they were going to Deans office to hook up instead of watching cat videos.
Dean showed up at exactly 8 pm, but by the way Dean was shivering despite being in a leather jacket, Castiel expected Dean was sat out there for more then a few minutes. Castiel had his bag slung over his shoulder as he smiles softly at him.
Dean leans into the touch, smiling to himself. He wanted to say he didn't want Castiel, that he didn't crave his touch, that he didn't need him.. but after nearly a year, he knew he did. He wondered if Castiel felt the same way.
Dean looks back and sees him smile and sighs, knowing he was going to regret this. Dean eventually swallows his nerves, clearing his throat and walking over to the dark haired man, and offering a small smile.
"Cas?" Dean questions after a long time of silence between the two. Castiel makes a small noise to show he's listening.
"Of course" Castiel offers a smile, watching as Dean nods, sitting down and pulling a PB&J out of his bag, as well as a small note. He reads over it, oblivious to Castiel watching the way his eyes full of green flick across the paper. Dean laughs softly before setting the note down and opening the bag. He glances up to see Castiel without a lunch.
One day, Castiel was the in Cafeteria sat at one of the tables with a coffee cup, watching his phone for his hour lunch break. He eventually looks up to see Dean walk in, looking around for a table and sighing when he sees them all full. His eyes lock with Castiel for a moment, before looking away, blushing when he gets caught, Castiel only smiles slightly.
Everyday after that, it happened pretty much the same way. They would meet in the cafeteria, Dean would offer half his sandwich and Cas would offer half of his, and they would talk, and laugh and eventually they started to meet in Deans office instead, Dean saying he didn't like the Cafeteria much, Cas agreed.
Dean thinks to himself, as he feels himself falling deeper into the kiss, Castiel only kissing him harder. It had taken years for Dean to even think to himself that he loved Lisa, yet in just under a year, especially these three days, he had fallen head over heels for the man in front of him and although Lisa was haunting his thoughts, attempting to pulling him back above water, Castiel snuck up, pulling him back under every time.
"Wanna go somewhere tonight..anywhere, away from here?" Dean question, not even knowing what he's asking, but he knew he couldn't go home to the argument Lisa was putting up, claiming Dean didn't want to marry her, because he didn't know to fight back against her points. They were all valid and they left Dean confused and over thinking everything. Dean didn't want to do that anymore. Castiel seemed to be in a daze, eventually snapping himself out of it and nodding.
No one could recall who leaned in first, maybe it was Dean because he hand his hands fisting at Castiels sweater, or maybe it was Castiel, with his hands gently cupping Deans cheeks, but all they knew is that this was happening, Dean with a angry fiancee waiting at home, and Castiel with a dead end job and no one waiting for him, they were sat in the impala, kissing each other desperately. Like the entire world was ending and they had seconds left to live.
Castiel ends up sensing the car had stopped moving for too long and sits up, opening his eyes and seeing he was too close to Dean. Castiel swallowed thickly, his eyes searching Deans face. Dean watches him.
"So uh, where are we going?" Cas questions. Dean waits until they're both in the Car and smiles towards Castiel.
"I uh, I ran late this morning, forgot my wallet and lunch" He shrugs, looking up so his sky blues meet flourish forests. Dean keeps the contact for a moment to long, feeling himself get lost before coughing, looking away. "Well, you can have half of mine" He nods, taking half of his sandwich before pushing the baggy with the other half across the table. Castiel smiles thankfully.
In his office they would watch videos Dean or Castiel had found the previous night, and laugh together, and it was just, nice. Dean hadn't felt nice in a very long time, and Castiel started to actually look forward to going to work everyday.
"Are you not eating?" He questions, Castiel only shrugs in response.
before - including one time that I haven't posted yet.
“I—yes. Thank you.” His embarrassment made his speech rapid. “I know it was an accident. I’m just out of sorts.”
TW: Brief discussion of child abuse
“Years. Fuck, so many years, Dean.”
“Heck, let’s say six years.”
“So you came here, set up this whole elaborate plan... for me? To see if we could be ‘us’?”
He wondered briefly if he could come this way, but then the tongue slid away—he only let out a small whine and not the sob he really wanted to—and then a gentle finger took its place. He was probed lightly, slender digit slipping in and out of him in soft thrusts. Cas added another finger after a moment, whispering sweet, soothing nothings at Dean about relaxing and doing well and Dean didn’t know what else. His whole body felt melted—except his rock of a dick. It was getting uncomfortable to keep it underneath him.
They parked and got out and Bobby showed Dean where the water hookup came out, to show where the house would best be built. Then he took them back to see what was indeed a creek. As they walked, Bobby talked about plans that Dean’s father had made for the land, some of which Dean liked and some he didn’t.
“Follow me,” Cas said, rising and taking Dean’s hand.
“What’s’uh matter, Cas? This hot bod too much for you to handle?” He grinned and winked to be as obnoxious as possible—which, judging by Sam’s disgusted huff, worked like a charm.
Dean had been planning to help, but he knew four extra hands would be too many, so thought he would work on Cas’ gift in the meantime. “Yeah, can the rugrat help? It’ll get him out of my hair for a while,” he joked.
His smile said he wanted Cas to remember his name and Dean decided then and there that “D” was a jealous son of a bitch who was not averse to metaphorically pissing around his territory.
“If you want to call it off, what’s your safeword?”
“If you truly don’t mind, that would be very helpful. Just until tomorrow. The super is going to move me into one of the vacant apartments then.”
Cas smiled and raised one eyebrow. “I learned it from you, Dean. However, I have never quite agreed with the notion that certain words are forbidden. We give the words their meaning, so it is silly to think that God cares about something as trivial as a sound we made up.”
Then abruptly, the fingers were gone and Cas was leaning down to kiss him again. Dean found his left leg lifted up toward his stomach and then the blunt head of that huge cock was breaching him. Time seemed to slow down. He could feel every hot, velvety inch of it as Cas slid home. Cas had erred on the side of a metric fuckton of lube, but even so, Dean could feel it all. He felt so good, so tight and hot and good.
Dean tried to ignore the weird look on Cas’s face. He looked... shy? Was that it? He was too busy with his burger and fries to spend too long worrying about it, though. Soon enough they were finished eating, but by then he’d more or less forgotten Cas’s weirdness.
“I was buying the kale when I saw him and it was super awkward and I ended up just grabbing a bunch of it so I could get out of there and by the time I realized how much I’d gotten, I was in the check out and he was there. Cas, I mean.”
He grinned and sat up a little more, taking Cas’ hand in his. He had been feeling so inexperienced, but now he had to be the brave one, since he could tell Cas still wasn’t over what had happened. He wondered if maybe they should talk about it.
