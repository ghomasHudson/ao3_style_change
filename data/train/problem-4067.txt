Dean raised his head in confusion, staring at the dark silhouette entering the room, wondering who would possibly own a key to their dorm room apart from Castiel and himself. Before he could freak out though, he recognized the mess of hair on the other's head.
He should probably sit down somewhere comfy and sober the hell up, he thought to himself. He didn't need to end up lying on the floor near the bar - just imagine how that would look.
Dean sits down by the desk and watches me attentively. I am unsure of how to proceed. Does he want me to stop? But I'm so hungry... So I just keep nibbling on my bread, staring back at Dean self-consciously. I feel like a child. But I can't seem to be able to look away either.
', just remember that whoever is behind all of this managed to build perfect robot copies of persons, so why the hell
"Cas?" he asked through the door, sounding worried. "You haven't been out of your room all day, are you alright?"
"Good luck getting that back," Michael and the other two laughed, leaving him sitting on the ground in desperation.
Castiel smiled to himself when he entered the building, a feeling of familiarity curling in his gut. He felt home in here, having spent a quarter of his life in clubs like this, willingly or not. He'd had the kind of friends who would drag him along to places like this, and after a while, Castiel really wasn't bothered by it anymore. He rather enjoyed it actually.
"Yes. But it's too late now. You're going out with Alfie because I was too much of a coward to admit it. I wasn't ready."
"Then what's the matter?" Dean asked, touching Cas's hand hesitantly, and breathed out in relief when Cas didn't pull away.
Pacing the room in agitation, Metatron waited for Inias to arrive, so he could scream his anger out at him. As if on cue, there was a knock on the door.
So instead of taking my time, I simply step around Alastair so I'm standing right behind him, his body desperately trying to wiggle away from me and mumbling a mantra of 'No, please, don't', but I'm not paying any mind to it. I am furious, possessed by revenge and not giving in to my conscience. This is what this monster deserves.
It didn't take him long. Not even five minutes later, Cas was done, every side of the cube one color only. He looked up at Dean, holding the cube out to him, and smiled proudly.
I'd made my decision. And my decision was to try and love the one person that cared about me one hundred percent.
"Man, that was one hell of a drive," he starts, obviously speaking to the other guy, and turns around to him distractedly. "Never seen so many damn car--"
"Okay," Cas replied and got to work. He picked it up, inspecting it for a second or two and then started twisting and turning the parts around. He was slow at first, but once he figured out how it worked, he got a lot faster.
"Done," Dean said and Castiel turned back to look at him. His heart skipped a beat when his eyes involuntarily wandered over Dean's biceps and chest, down his abs and strong legs, and he had to rip his eyes away from him forcefully. Dean truly was breath-taking (meaning 'flaming hot' in Gabe's vocabulary), but Castiel quickly shook off the thought. Now was certainly not the time to check Dean out.
"Did he at least have his memories inserted already?" he inquired, knowing that hoping for it would be ridiculous, but doing so either way.
He tried taking the book from Dean's hands, but Dean simply held up his arms, laughing, lifting the book above his head where Castiel couldn't reach it. Please, no! He couldn't read... "...
When he eventually checked his phone again, he realized that he had five new messages from Castiel that he hadn't even noticed; that's how deep he was in his thoughts.
To everyone's bewilderment, Castiel didn't even bat an eyelash at Dean's words and rather smiled at him, a slight blush on his face, and started a silent conversation about whether or not their English essay was due on Thursday or Friday. Dean just shrugged, smiling back.
He took a chance. "I am robot, sir," he answered and got a nod in return. The relief Cas felt was almost overwhelming.
"Okay," she said and laid her hand down on the button. Before pressing it, she said, "Dean... Be careful."
they know how to build a memory transfer-er?" Dean said, having gotten to the end of his speech, and waited for Sam to stomach it all.
"Would it have made a difference if I was only 17?" I want to know and Dean looks me up and down quickly, checking me out quite obviously.
"That's awesome," I encouraged him. "I could work for you every once in a while if you needed some support," I offered and Cas's smile widened.
"Oh?" I asked, not meeting Benny's eyes. Thankfully, he didn't comment on my weird behavior. "Well, Castiel is... special, I guess," I forced out.
"Hey, Cas, can I have your notes again?" Dean exclaims when he's within hearing range and comes to a stop in front of the two, effectively catching both of their attention.
He saw Castiel wincing on the bed in reaction, looking up from his book with a surprised expression on his face.
Nodding in realization, Cas thought about everything that had happened. It made sense. The way Sam and Dean had already found out this much about where he came from, when he himself had had no idea about it.
Castiel couldn't do anything but nod, still confused by this man's rapid mood change but willing to do anything to keep him this friendly. Still smiling -and Castiel had to admit that a smile suited him way better than a scowl-, the man reached into his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper. He grabbed the pen from Castiel's chest pocket and wrote down his name and phone number without hesitation.
"Would you, um..." Dean continued. "Would you maybe, uuh... God, I don't know how to say this," Dean stuttered on and since Castiel felt rather sorry for him, he decided to relieve him of this torture.
If I just knew what happened... But my head hurts too badly to concentrate on anything in particular.
Dean adds two more cuts then, one on my other arm and one running from my heart to my belly button. I am beginning to look the way I want.
The rest of the week passed as if nothing had happened. The fight from before hadn't been mentioned again, things returning to normal as soon as Dean had calmed down.
"The factory hall is where they store their robots until they are shipped off to wherever they're supposed to go," Dean continued. "That's about all we know for sure so far."
would take and just how impossible it was to fulfill Amara's expectations at this stage. It was a wonder he'd gotten
Dean snorted in disbelief but let it slide and turned his attention back to his TV show. Cas sat at the table and stared at his hands.
"Alright," Dean said with a smile, looking down at Castiel with kind eyes. "I'll help you look for it."
I let the pinky drop to the floor when I look back up, determined to make this guy suffer a lot more.
"Thank you," Castiel said and smiled as if he didn't have a care in the world. He didn't seem all that nervous. Fuck, even Dean was nervous, and it wasn't even a real date for him.
"Bingo," he agreed and Dean voiced his approval by letting out another guttural moan when Castiel dug his fingers into his neck. For the rest of the massage, he continued to stay mostly silent though. All in all, the atmosphere was calming for the both of them and if Castiel was being honest a little arousing as well, considering that the occasional moan which left Dean's throat was downright porn material.
Weirdly enough, Castiel ignoring him does nothing to alleviate the pressure on his chest, even though he knows it's what's best.
Fastening his pace, he knew it wouldn't be long before he'd be coming. Dean's mouth just felt too good to hold out any longer. Bucking into the heat a few more times, Castiel could feel the curling in his gut and pulled out right before it was too late. Jacking his cock the rest of the way, he groaned heavily and came all over Dean's face. He continued to jerk himself through his orgasm as he watched strings of come sputter onto Dean's cheeks, his lips, his now perfectly closed eyelids. It was a wonderfully sinful thing to see Dean like this. Dishonored. Abused. Taken advantage of.
"Yeah, of course, I just..." Dean started and gulped down his guilt. This was harder than he'd thought. "I just haven't been completely honest with you."
"Now I'm gonna fuck you and make you feel it for days," Castiel announced, not caring that there was no one to listen. Castiel simply loved the sound of his own voice.
"You didn't," Dean assured him. He watched Castiel put away his overnight bag in silence and fought the urge to ask what was going on. Dean didn't know if he was allowed to do that though, so he stayed quiet instead.
"It's a shame you can't get hard, Dean," he said, biting a mark onto Dean's collarbone. Dean's eyelids fluttered in an attempt to fight the numbness. "I would've
Wiping angry tears from his eyes he'd never noticed falling, Castiel stood up slowly and walked over to the three dumpsters standing next to each other. Which one had Michael thrown it in? He had to get it back. He took a chance and looked into the first one, seeing nothing but different kinds of waste, no book in sight. Same with the other two. He'd probably have to climb inside if he ever wanted to find it... Castiel sobbed in frustration; this wasn't fair.
Seeming a little confused by his unspectacular reply, Dean left him alone after that, walking back to where he'd been standing before and leaned against the wall. His arms were still crossed over his chest skeptically.
Dean couldn't help but stare back, not knowing what to say all of a sudden, and Castiel's eyes flew up to his. Noticing he'd been caught looking, the man blushed furiously. It was kinda cute -- not that Dean would ever admit that.
"Really?" Lisa asks, just as excited as Jess seems to be. "But he's, like, the shiest guy ever! Oh god, they'd be so cute together," she gushes.
"....Alright," Sam said slowly and walked past them warily. "I think I'm still gonna get that motel room."
I pull at the handcuffs again, making my wrist hurt even more. I know there's no use in trying but I do so anyway, and involuntarily, the clatter of metal against metal cuts through the room loudly.
Dean and Castiel were having lunch in the college's cafeteria -they had surprisingly good food-, when Dean noticed his sworn arch enemy walking right up to them from afar.
"Oh, fuck," Castiel cursed, pretending to be embarrassed about the situation. "I'm so sorry, Dean," he muttered frantically, looking up at Dean with innocent eyes. "I didn't mean to."
Well, for anyone except for Dean. Because never mind if Dean was a show-off sometimes, it never sounded childish or made up when things like that came out of his mouth, and nobody would ever deny it.
"Yes, as a matter of fact," Castiel replied, not bothering to explain that his friends were the last persons he wanted to see when he was at a party; even though he had
Already I was drowning in self-doubt and anger, questioning Bobby's intentions throughout the whole time I'd been working for him. It was like the thing with Mom but worse. Mom's lies hadn't actually surprised me, I'd barely seen her all that time anyway, but Bobby's betrayal... That'd hit hard.
"I apologize, sir," he said quietly, hoping to please his boss enough to let him go easy, but Metatron wasn't done. He pulled himself out of his leather chair and came closer, his small form failing to seem the least bit threatening but Inias pretended to be intimidated anyway. It was the smart thing to do.
I had nowhere else to go though, so naturally, I stayed at Castiel's. Mom never knew I was just next door.
Needless to mention, Dean's words caused a lot of talk amongst the students and they even started a few fights on his behalf. Dean wasn't bothered by any of it, happily going on with his life, not getting involved in any of the discussions and not giving anything away...
"Th-Thank you again, Mr. Winchester," Castiel forced out, trying to keep calm, but his heart was thumping in his chest excitedly. What was it about this man that threw him off so much? One flirty comment and he was a slobbering mess...
"What the hell are you doing?" Castiel spits at him, once he's gotten close enough to hear him. Dean stops in his tracks when he hears Castiel's tone. Something's not right, he finally realizes.
to know. "Do you love me, too?" I forced out and Mom didn't even look up when she muttered, "Of course, sweetheart, you're my son."
"Well, I was used to it. I was always the calm one, so I rarely got involved in any fights. I also have a sister, who I get along with great."
important thing you need to remember is that the cowboy boots are what makes Dr. Sexy sexy, okay?" Dean asked and Cas nodded attentively. "Good. It's important for the season finale.
They wouldn't be able to tell who closed the gap first, afterwards. Probably Dean. Fact was though that pretty much as soon as those words had left Cas's mouth, Dean's hand was cupping his cheek, lips pressed against the other's. It wasn't a very long kiss, but it was affectionate and intense and one of the nicest kisses Dean could remember having.
Slowly, Castiel started stroking again. I wasn't close to coming anymore, thanks to his previous iron grip on my dick, but it was building up again quickly. I held still, knowing Castiel wanted me to, so I just sat there, mouth wide open and eyes closed. Castiel's hand was unrelenting, moving in just the right pace, bringing me closer and closer to my orgasm again. My breathing sped up, I felt it building in my stomach, and then, and then -- stop.
Thankfully, Castiel didn't say, "I told you so." He didn't reply at all, actually, but that was fine because he pulled me even closer, silently comforting me. I instantly felt better.
Dean only smirks at me knowingly and nods, letting go off me. "Sure do," he says and turns to leave the room quickly. He doesn't lock, but I'm not even thinking about escaping.
Brushing his hand against his pocket and what was inside, Dean walked on stage as well, smiling at Castiel before turning to smile at the crowd, and came to stand beside his boyfriend.
"How's your head? Should hurt like a bitch," he says nonchalantly and I stare at him some more, not reacting in any way. I'm gonna die anyhow.
"Okay then, don't talk to me," the man mutters, raising his hands in defeat shortly, and comes closer, kneeling down in front of me.
Amara's fingers pulled away harshly, ripping apart one of the blossoms, and her gaze turned dark and intense. Jealousy visibly coursed through her, making her blood boil, and even though it was kind of amazing to see Amara lose her cool, Dean was scared shitless at the same time. He couldn't do anything but stare at her, expecting to get slapped every moment now, but it didn't happen.
Cas had been wandering around for hours. The mist had disappeared and it had started getting dark, raindrops beginning to fall. The wetness made his skin feel uncomfortable.
"Dean, whatever you're about to tell me, it won't change how I look at you," Castiel promised and laid his hands down on Dean's. "I've already made up my mind about you."
"I don't know," Castiel replied, a little mystified about Dean bringing up the topic. "I hadn't really thought about it."
My little brother eyes us up skeptically, aware of today's date and very much expecting a trick. "What is it?" he asks.
"I would've," Castiel interrupted, surprising even himself with his words, and almost fell into the dumpster in his attempt to get back in front of Dean. Not that he wasn't already filthy and smelly.
Just like every time, my breathing became shallow, anticipation building in my gut, growing bigger and bigger, and I half-expected Castiel to cut me off again, but no! I was coming for real this time, oh, I was coming, so hard it made my whole body shake, pulling out desperate sobs and moans. I collapsed in Castiel's arms involuntarily and he held me up, cum still leaking out of my cock, soaking our clothes.
Dean continued. "And then, after I used you for the first time, I'll make you get down on your knees and suck my cock, while my cum is still leaking out of your abused hole," he mumbled, sucking Castiel's ear lobe between his teeth and nibbling on it. And even though Castiel was now fully hard and more turned on than he'd been in a really long time, he still noticed the way Dean's hand let something slip inside Castiel's glass.
"I'm not one to interrupt potential last kisses, but I'm starting to feel like a third wheel, so I'm just gonna press the button now, okay?" Jimmy asked and Dean couldn't help but laugh.
"Will you go out with me tonight?" Castiel asks and Dean nods stupidly, not capable of doing much more. "Great," Castiel smiles and there's genuine happiness in his voice. And before Dean can realize what's happening, Castiel has pressed a shy kiss to his cheek, effectively frying all brain cells Dean had left.
now and right on time, Amara stalked into his laboratory like she owned the place. Her eyes traveled through the room as if she hadn't seen it a thousand times already, and she had a skeptical frown on her face. It was unnerving but nothing special.
For some reason, educating Cas on the subject of sophisticated medical dramas had made him decide to teach him about other stuff as well, his first and foremost being his Baby.
The man who spoke quickly turned the corner and froze, staring at Cas in surprise. "Oh, uh..." he started. He was tall as well, but not as tall as Sam, and he had short, spiky hair. Also, the greenest eyes Cas had ever seen. They were mesmerizing, Cas decided.
"We don't really have seatbelts," Sam mentioned when they sat down, even though Cas hadn't made an attempt to look for them. "Sorry," he added, not sounding all that sorry, and turned the key in the ignition. The car came to life with a rumble.
avoiding you yesterday, but-- but not for the reason you might think..." he continued cryptically, his hand gripping Castiel's shirt to keep him from leaving. Not that he would've had to do that since Castiel was frozen, leg still halfway over the edge of the dumpster, staring up at Dean in alarm.
, a sudden realization hit him. Had he given Castiel hope when he'd stared at him just now, caught in the moment? Had Dean lead him on without meaning to?
Ignoring the way his friends immediately scattered when they set foot inside, Castiel headed for the bar first. It was what he always did, get a drink and then find a place to hang out. He wasn't one for dancing, even though he knew how to, but rather sat around doing some harmless flirting with strangers. (Also, some
And again, Castiel didn't know what to say to that. So he just stared, the silence stretching further and further.
When the van came to life, Cas wiggled his fingers carefully. It still worked. A small smile spread on his face.
Using the now perfectly well working elevator, Castiel rode up to second floor and walked towards his 'laboratory', as he called it. The teleporter, a big machine consisting of two identical parts and a console, was already waiting for him, impatient to be used again. Castiel was convinced the teleporter itself wanted to succeed just as much as he did -- not that Castiel would ever say that out loud to anybody. It made him sound crazy.
Weirdly enough, I actually liked Dean. He was handsome, funny and didn't make me feel like the annoying 15-year-old that I apparently was, according to Mom's previous boyfriends. Yeah, Dean seemed great -if not flawless- and I enjoyed dinner with him greatly. But it was the thing after dinner that had me feeling a little unsure about his motives...
"I didn't know what we were," Castiel quickly assured him. "All this time I thought you didn't want people to know, so it didn't even occur to me that you might want more with me," he explained.
The guy only grins and holds up a paper bag. "I'm his drug dealer," he explains and my suspicion fades away slightly. I smile.
Luckily enough, the elevator ran smoothly and when Dean arrived in his office, he immediately saw what Meg had meant. On the middle of his desk was a bouquet of flowers in a vase, filling the empty space and seemingly enlightening the room with their colors. They were beautiful...
Acting on instinct, I opened my mouth and let him in. I'd almost forgotten all about the pie he didn't swallow, so I was a little surprised when something soft and sweet was pushed into my mouth. No one had ever done that to me, shared their food with me this way. I knew it should be gross, but all I could think about was how hot all of it was.
"Dean Winchester," those beautiful lips now said, catching Castiel's whole attention and he barely realized that the man was holding out his hand to him. When he eventually noticed, he took it quickly, hoping desperately his palms weren't as sweaty as usual. Dean didn't flinch, so they hopefully weren't.
"What time is it?" I asked a little uneasily. It was a Saturday, which meant I had to be at work at ten. And if it was eight already, that'd give me the perfect reason to leave.
"Leave Dean the fuck alone. I won't say it again," Castiel growled and let go off Benny a second later. All I then heard was the sound of quick footsteps and violent cursing.
"Give us two weeks before you give up on us," he said. "If we're not back by then, we're probably dead."
Getting the toy car from his desk, he held it up for the camera shortly and set it down in the teleporter. He wasn't too concerned about it not going to work; Castiel had teleported lots of toy cars in his latest tests and they'd always appeared on the other side -- flawless or not.
"Why would I leave?" I mutter and the moment I say the words I know they are true. "I don't ever want to leave you, Dean."
His eyes met mine unexpectedly and I startled, the look in Castiel's gaze dark and hungry. My mouth fell open for a second, before I forced it close again and gulped hard. There was tension between the two of us, so much, and I didn't know what to do. I'd never been in a situation quite like this.
Still, Dean was pissed because of Amara's behavior. He thought it was ridiculous and annoying, and he didn't know how she dared to even think she had the right to interfere. The only thing she did achieve was to make Dean angry.
"I - I've never done this before," Dean explained when Castiel searched his eyes questioningly. "With a guy, I mean."
We had sex a lot. The first time I'd bottomed, I'd been scared and insecure, but Castiel had assured me that it was fine. He'd told me to relax and trust him. I did.
"I really like you, too," he replied quietly, and a shy smile appeared on Dean's face before he hid it in Castiel's armpit in embarrassment. Castiel laughed loudly at Dean's antics and scratched his head affectionately, which made Dean melt into him even more.
Dean gave Mom a quick peck on the lips before looking down at me. I avoided his gaze as best as possible but when he didn't say a word, I looked up at him through my eyelashes.
His alarm rang again then, the third time this morning, and Dean didn't have it in himself to ignore it another time. He turned it off clumsily, still half-asleep, and sat up with a groan.
"Only for you, my dear," he answered, sending Castiel a predatory smirk that had Castiel's dick twitching in his pants but he simply smiled back innocently. The man moved to the left a little and Castiel sat down in between him and another guy, the space just big enough for Castiel to fit. Their sides were conveniently pressed against each other's and Castiel was close enough to smell the man's cologne. Oh, how he wished that guy was lying beneath him right now, dick buried in his ass as Castiel rode him into oblivion...
"Can you pass me the salt, please?" Castiel asked. We were eating dinner at the moment and Castiel had made steak for the both of us. As luck would have it, Castiel was an amazing cook as well. Sometimes I couldn't believe just how perfect he was.
smile at him like that? How could anyone smile like that, period? It was a smile that could light up the sky, Castiel was sure of it.
"How does it feel to be helpless, huh?" Castiel asked. "To not know what's going on. To be at my fucking mercy," Castiel hissed, digging his nails into Dean's arms, and licked into his unresponsive mouth again.
And without batting an eyelash -only betrayed by the blush on his cheeks-, Cas responded, "Almost certainly."
For some reason though, the days he doesn't visit are the worst. Yeah, he kidnapped me and rapes me on a regular basis and I know that he killed enough persons that he doesn't remember how many; but if he's here, at least I'm not alone. Being alone is what's hard; being alone is what drives me insane. There's too much time to think, too little space to move and nothing to relieve my mind.
Castiel then pulled out his dick, probably feeling uncomfortable now that he was getting soft again, and I turned in his arms, curling up in them.
anything," I grumbled and ignored him, then I held out my hand to Cas. I smiled at him, friendly, trying to calm him down slightly. He looked like a deer in headlights after all.
"Exactly," he agreed and his gaze lingered on Cas's face for a little longer than what would be considered normal, before he turned back to the TV himself. Even though he knew the episode, he didn't want to miss what he knew was gonna happen.
"M-Move, please," I stuttered, needing him, and Dean complied happily, pulling out of me until his head caught on my entrance and then pushing back in. I groaned in pleasure and Dean did it again, adjusting his angle slightly, so his dick was hitting a spot inside of me that made me see stars. Muffled cries left my throat when he hit that spot over and over and over again, successfully killing every brain cell that was still working. I was in Heaven, blissed out and drowning in sensations.
And then his hands are all over me. In seconds, I am pushed onto the bed, strong hands pulling on my shirt and shoving it off my body, and then Dean's taking off his own shirt as well. I am slightly overwhelmed by the feeling of skin on skin, taking every touch as if I'm starving. I haven't been touched in days, so it's almost too much all of a sudden. I'm thankful for it though.
"And I thought I'd fixed it," he mumbled, his mood suddenly not as elevated as before, and took another bite of his sandwich disappointedly. Every time things went well, he had to screw it up.
"Alright. Kitchen's over there," Castiel instructed and took the movie from Dean's outstretched hand.
I came home drenched in sweat and motor oil and stepped into the shower quickly. The water felt amazing on my body and I didn't leave the bathroom for about half an hour. I hoped Mom didn't mind showering cold.
"E-Excuse me," a voice suddenly said from beside him, and Dean turned his head in surprise. Standing in front of him was the man in the trench coat, staring at him with startling blue eyes, and he was fidgeting slightly under Dean's expectant gaze.
"D-Dean?" Castiel asked, feeling somewhat crushed by that new knowledge. Knowing that Jimmy'd had the chance to be with Dean while Castiel himself was desperately trying to win his own Dean's heart and failing, was almost worse than Dean's rejection had felt like.
It was Castiel who finally asked the first question, and if only to avoid talking about his own life. It wasn't particularly exciting, he had to admit. And rather lonely, honestly.
The guy looked him up and down -silently contemplating whether Castiel was worth the space beside him- when he came to a decision and a lewd smirk appeared on his face.
That elicits a reaction. My gaze flies up to the helpless man on the ropes immediately, eyes narrowing in anger when I realize what the guy has done. Raping children -- in my eyes, that's the worst crime one can commit.
Hesitantly, he reached out to Castiel and cradled his face, turning Castiel to face him. "I'm sorry for being a dumbass," he apologized.
Silence fell as Castiel poured himself a cup and sat down across from Dean, who had opted to open the bottle of water and gulp it all down in one go. It was kind of impressive if you thought about it.
And with this sentence, the last of Castiel's brain cells burned away. "You want me to meet your parents?" he nearly squeaked, even more mystified than before.
"Dean," I whined when he took off his boxers quickly and I stopped breathlessly when I saw his dick. It was bigger than mine and rock hard, leaking pre-come into his hand.
I didn't hear Dean come up to me, but suddenly, he was there, his arms wrapping around my waist from behind and his nose burying itself in my hair, inhaling deeply. My knees got a little wobbly.
A few seconds later he was ready to start, sitting in his chair again. Dean's skeptical -but also mighty curious- gaze never left Cas's face.
I don't know what I feel. It's not pain, not really, because nothing hurts when you're as high as we are. Instead, a pleasant shudder runs down my spine and my eyes widen in surprise. I can hear my heartbeat thumping in my chest and suddenly, I know what's so amazing about those pills.
"And what about Cas?" I asked, finally giving up on cooling my finger, and shoved the pizza onto my plate, sitting down at the table.
The first time I met him was a few weeks ago when Mom invited him over for dinner. I knew about their relationship at the time, they'd been dating for a few months already, but it was only now that Mom wanted me to meet him. Apparently, things were rather serious.
"So, what do you do, Cas?" Dean asked when he turned back towards Castiel. "It must be something fancy, the way you're dressed," he noted, gesturing to the other man's suit and tie.
"I know how to make it better," he says, realization suddenly dawning on him, and he pulls back to look me in the eye. His pupils are blown wide when he meets my gaze, but he doesn't stare at me for long, hand fiddling with a small box in his pocket.
Castiel smiled soothingly and shook his head while leaning over to me, and my heartbeat slowed down slightly. Castiel wouldn't harm me, would he?
I was full on crying now, sobbing in relief and exhaustion, and Castiel pulled me closer, caressing my back slowly.
"Dean and I..." Cas starts and looks at me insecurely. After a few seconds, he takes my hand in his determinedly. It's perfect and I can't suppress the smile that's spreading on my face. I never wanna let go.
"You stay here until we're back," the second one said. "We're gonna talk to Metatron first and get you right after."
want to hear it," he hissed and Inias lowered his head in submission, while at the same time trying to hide his anger. It wasn't his fault things weren't going the way they were supposed to go.
Dean had gone rigid in front of him, an unreadable expression on his face, and Castiel could practically see the unease soaking through his clothes.
It's a man with a scruff, he's tall and bulky and wearing a baseball cap. I have never seen him before in my life. When his eyes meet mine, he stops in the middle of the room, eyeing me up curiously and frowning.
"Maybe later, Sammy," he said jokingly and sighed. Castiel ignored the furious blush that spread on his face at the indication of sex. "But believe me, this feels
Conversation continued as smooth as it had been all night, and wasn't it weird that Dean had never spoken so freely on a date before? It was totally unexpected but kind of liberating. He thought about bringing up Jack a few times but decided to put it off for now, and to enjoy the nice time they were having.
He sets the plate on the floor in front of my bed, as if I'm a dog that needs to be fed, but I don't care and simply sit down on the floor to grab the dry piece of bread. It's not much but it's better than nothing.
"Um..." I start, having lost the ability to speak. "B-both?" I stutter and hurry to explain myself. "I -- I mean... If only one of us has hickeys, Sam might think they're from someone else, you know? But if we both have some... Just being thorough," I add quickly.
So he'd just deal with it and wait it out. Maybe her feelings for him would disappear if he kept on saying no.
"Do you... come here often?" Castiel eventually asked and chanced a glance at Dean to check for his reaction.
"I don't want you to see Benny again," Castiel whispered into my ear when he slammed into me another time and I came, as hard as I ever had. No sounds left my mouth when I painted my stomach, Castiel's hand still wrapped around my throat tightly and my eyes turned upwards in pleasure. It was only when Castiel came himself a few seconds later that he let go off me and I was able to suck in a huge breath, suddenly coughing violently. My throat started to hurt now,
"Open up, sweetheart," he orders. My breathing is shallow but I part my lips reluctantly, pretending to be somewhere else, anywhere else. It doesn't help.
"What do you want me to do?" Dean asks and his words sound genuine even though the gaze in his eyes is beginning to get hungry. It suits my purposes though.
I wasn't really in the mood for rational thought though. I knocked on Castiel's door before I had time to think about it.
The woman in front of him now scoffed in exasperation and, waving her finger in front of his face, spit the words, "I want to talk to the manager," into his face. Not that the manager would tell her anything different. Still, Castiel was relieved that he'd at least get rid of her that way.
How could it be that this person, this perfect, kind, undeniably gorgeous man was standing next to him in this moment, praising his work? Praising his intellect? It was almost too good to be true.
Giving Dean his best bitch face, Castiel grabbed for Dean's cup and took a sip of his coffee in reply. "Happy?" he asked.
Still confused, he shook it off with some effort and continued down the hallway. It most likely didn't mean anything anyway.
No matter what he should or shouldn't be feeling though, Dean was on edge all day long, snapping at everyone who even dared to talk to him. And despite knowing he wasn't thinking rationally, Dean couldn't help but curse all these people for addressing him like it was just any other day. Because actually, it was exactly that, just any other normal day, and still, for some reason, Dean felt like it wasn't.
"That's... that's great," Castiel replied half-heartedly. Before he could add any more, Mister Singer had entered the room, catching everyone's attention.
He motioned for him to get inside and Dean did so willingly. He'd been in there a few times already.
"I was high," I protest quickly. I am not ready to admit it just yet. "I would kill you in an instance if you gave me the chance now."
, he couldn't help but buck into it, burying his whole length in Dean's throat. Dean didn't visibly react and fuck if that didn't turn Castiel on. He pulled back after a few moments, not wanting to accidentally choke Dean while unconscious and instead set a hard rhythm, using Dean's throat for all it was worth.
"I really, really do," Castiel said and carefully framed Dean's face with his hands. "Can I kiss you?" he quietly asked, and at Dean's immediate nod, he pulled him into the most heartfelt kiss either of them had experienced before. They kissed and kissed and kissed, until it became too hard to breathe and they had to split, gasping for air.
They entered the place and sat down in the booth farthest from the entrance to have an illusion of privacy and ordered their food soon after. Only now did Castiel realize how hungry he really was.
I'd kissed girls before and it had been nice, but I'd never kissed a boy, let alone a grown man. His lips were chapped and moving underneath mine, his stubble slightly scratching my cheek, and I loved the feeling of it. I went limp under his hands, trusting him completely to make me feel good.
Yeah, if Dean reacted that relaxed about me accusing him of being gay, this Cas guy must really be best friend material.
Somewhat distractedly, I turned down the heat of the oven and opened it, taking out the store-bought pizza. I cursed loudly when the cloth slipped slightly and I burned my finger.
Dean nods and grins manically. "Hell yeah we will. Dude's been hanging from the ceiling for days already, he won't last much longer anyway," he tells me.
When Dean finally lifted his head after what felt like hours, he was feeling somewhat clearer. The room had come to a stop and his eyes could focus again, only his head was still somewhat muddy.
When Dean opens the door and enters, pulling me inside as well, I immediately know what this is. A torture chamber. A place where Dean hurts and kills, a place where he satisfies his urges.
"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen," John started and proceeded with his 'It's been a long and successful year' speech. Dean didn't bother listening. It was the same every time.
"Hey, Cas," Dean said quietly, as to not wake up his brother yet again, and Cas turned towards him with a slight smile. Dean was leaning against the doorway with his arms crossed, mirroring the fond smile Cas himself had on his face.
"That's great, Cas," Sam said genuinely and took the photo in hand. "Now we found the hospital at least. It doesn't get us the location of the factory hall you mentioned, but that's alright; we can at least keep an eye on the building."
"I'm glad you came here," Castiel confessed and pressed a quick kiss to Dean's lips. Dean only smirked knowingly and pulled him in for another, longer kiss. They didn't part until Jimmy coughed loudly.
The door opens again and this time it's Dean entering, throwing his keys into the bowl and taking off his jacket. He doesn't notice me just yet.
They ate in silence, both of them too focused on their burgers to talk more, and it didn't take long for them to finish. Dean didn't think he'd ever had food as good as this, not even at the Roadhouse – not that he'd ever mention that to Ellen.
"Friend of yours?" Castiel asked when Benny had left. I hadn't noticed that he was waiting for me in his doorway.
Before his eyes, Castiel's face shattered. "Oh no. I knew it. You didn't really want to go on a date with me, but you felt sorry for me, didn't you?"
The alarm didn't go off for another hour. Castiel was asleep again, his nose buried in my hair, while I was wide awake, thinking about last night's happenings.
He continued looking around, trying to tune out the voices from the kitchen. Ignoring the brothers' fight was nearly impossible but Cas certainly tried.
"I do not know who I belong to. They have left me behind. My name is Cas," he responded. "What is your name?" he asked in return. His first interaction with a human being was going well so far, he thought.
"No," Castiel ordered, not stopping, and I resignedly forced myself to hold still. It was torture, not being allowed to act on instinct.
Then, all of a sudden, he turned back to me determinedly and said, "Stay away from him, okay? He'll be the death of you."
"You've... You've told them about me?" Castiel didn't understand anything anymore. Who would tell their parents about having a friends-with-benefits arrangement with another guy?
"Yes. It's me," Castiel said and drew his fingers out of me. He pulled me back against him quickly, so I was pushed down onto his lap, and his dick entered me without warning. I gasped in surprise, throwing my head back against his shoulder at the burning feeling. Castiel's hand came up to my throat unexpectedly, cutting off my airways when he started fucking into me quickly. I wanted to protest, to ask what he was doing, but I was too overwhelmed by the feeling of his dick hammering into my prostate and the desperate need to scream in pleasure, but I could do nothing but take it. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't move, and weirdly enough, I
Cursing Gabriel in his head, Castiel struggled to calm down the woman in front of him yelling about how they should've
"No!" Castiel exclaimed and pushed further into Dean's space. "I haven't been with a single other person since that night at the party, I swear."
"I was avoiding you because... Those damn pants, dude," Dean said, visibly distracted by the memory and dreamily staring into nothing. "How was I supposed to deal with you in skinny jeans?"
The next thing I see is the perfect face right above mine, looking down at me hungrily. I stare at it in awe. Oh so perfect.
"I know," Cas said, an unfamiliar hint of nervous anticipation curling in his gut. He glanced towards Dean in the driver's seat.
"Yeah. That." His reply was mumbled, eyes getting heavier by the second, and soon he gave in to the temptation of sleep.
So, yeah, the flowers kept on coming and people kept on asking who they were from but Dean never told. He'd learned from his mistake concerning Amara and he'd decided it would be better better if nobody knew.
out of the room. I didn't look back the whole way upstairs, ignoring everything and everyone around me until I was in the safety of my flat.
"What's the name of the guy you despise the most?" he then asks and I tilt my head in confusion. Why does he want to know?
It was quiet once more. Neither averted their eyes and just continued staring at each other, aware of the tension in the air but too captivated by the other's stare to do something against it. It was Dean who eventually made the first move.
"I know, baby, I know," Dean said, pumping his finger in and out of me slowly. "You need me to fill that hole, need me to show you what it's like to be fucked. And I will show you, baby, I will. But you have to be patient for just a little longer."
"I expanded my search to hospitals in a 30 mile radius. I doubt you've really gotten that far but it's better to check every possibility. I'm pretty sure the hospital in question will be among them," he said. "Wait a sec, I'll get them."
"I'll leave you to it then," I say and pick up the bowl and the book I left on the living room table. "I'll be downstairs if you need me," I announce and leave, feeling Dean's stunned gaze on me the whole time.
So I do. I smile bashfully and tilt back my head, throwing the drug in the air and catching it with my mouth easily. I gulp it down. Dean smirks but says nothing and only does the same, throwing and catching the pill without much difficulty.
The next day, after another riveting episode of Dr. Sexy MD, Dean took Cas to show him his car. Or rather, to teach him all about it.
His eyes fell back on me quickly and he buried one of his hands in my hair, pulling me closer inch for inch. It didn't hurt, not at all, but I still struggled slightly. I felt my dick twitching in my pants -I'd had wet dreams about being in a situation like this since the laundry room incident- but now that it was actually happening, I panicked.
you by asking him, Dean, but it seemed like the easiest solution to the whole boyfriend problem," he protested, sitting up straight. "My mother wanted me to bring a date and Balthazar just so happened to be the perfect choice. What was I supposed to do?"
"Can I-" Dean started, not really sure what he was asking, but apparently, Castiel got the hint anyway. He pulled his fingers out of himself only a moment later and then led Dean's hand towards his entrance. Dean's fingers shook a little when he lifted them towards Castiel's hole. Now or never, he thought.
Metatron was watching him with a furious look on his face. He already knew what was going on from Inias's half of the conversation.
"I can't say I'm sad about the way things turned out but I'd still like to take you on that date," Dean admitted, almost whispering it into Castiel's ear, and he felt Castiel shuddering at the feeling.
"This is very complex," Cas therefore said. Dean looked at him in surprise. He hadn't even noticed Cas was watching with him.
"Um... Lie down on the table, please," he instructed quickly and waited for Dean to comply before walking over to the switch to turn off the lights. The candles were the only thing illuminating the room now and Castiel had to admit, if this wasn't a professional situation, the candles would create an
"Besides," Dean started, speaking with a full mouth, successfully gaining Cas's full attention again, "it's not every day you find a robot walking the streets. 'S normal to be curious."
"The memory is hazy but ... it was full with people like me. Robots, as you would say. We were not allowed to move, but we would not have been able to anyway if we tried. I assume the covers on our back were kept open."
But that was when another thought crawled into his brain, a small possibility, the faintest chance, a
In the laundry room, there were two rows of washing machines and I quickly walked over to the one I normally used. Castiel chose the one in the second row, directly across from me, and I couldn't help but look at him from time to time while putting my dirty clothes inside the machine.
When I looked at Benny next, his eyes were still fixed on Castiel and he had a suspicious glimmer in his eyes. They instantly disliked each other, that much was obvious.
I didn't reply and pulled the covers over my head instead, shielding myself from the outside world. Dean wasn't actually
"Where'd you leave your trench coat?" Dean asked Castiel later when they'd sat down and ordered already.
"Cas! You're not even listening," she complained, and Castiel glanced up at her defeatedly. She had a pout on her face and her arms were crossed.
That's when his lips met mine and I immediately stopped struggling, mind going blank. All I could think was,
Dean's eyes were locked on Castiel's cheek in disbelief, right where Balthazar had just kissed Castiel. He had kissed him. That bastard had fucking
He looks at my lips for a few seconds like he's about to kiss me, but of course that was just my imagination. Because a few moments later, the expression in his eyes changes and he simply points one of his fingers at the spot just behind his ear. He mutters a silent, "And here," and I smile, complying happily. I suck his ear lobe into my mouth, shamelessly playing with it, before I let go to suck a bruise behind it.
"Uh," Dean started, suddenly looking a little insecure. "Actually, I was thinking, we could, um... I mean... I brought a movie? And popcorn?" he asked more than said and held up the small bag he'd brought with him.
"Tell me about your son," Castiel said when they started walking, and shyly took Dean's hand in his. Dean let it happen and held on tight at his suggestion.
The only thing Cas remembered when it came to that last one was that, "Taylor Swift is evil and Zep is heaven," which Cas wasn't sure he could fully support because he'd asked Sam about it later and listened to a Taylor Swift song, finding that he'd quite liked it.
There was silence between Jimmy and Castiel while they stared at each other. Then, Jimmy threw his hands up in defeat and walked away.
"But I need them now," Dean insists, pushing himself in front of Alfie to cut him off from Castiel's line of sight.
"May I ask why?" he asked calmly, almost like he'd expected rejection all along, and it broke Dean's heart a little that a man as great as Castiel had so little luck in love.
He looked around curiously while the men dragged him through a small door on the side and down a narrow hallway. Dirty white walls were everything Cas could see.
Weirdly enough, it didn't stop at the car. Over the course of the next few days, Dean had apparently made it his mission to educate Cas on everything he deemed important. Whether it was cars, TV shows, food or music.
Castiel's heart shattering as he visibly deflated. Dean felt sick all of a sudden, the words like lead on his tongue. "I'm... I'm honored, really," he continued, trying to save what was left to save, trying to make Castiel feel less rejected than he did right now. He wasn't sure if that was even possible. "The flowers you sent me, they... they were beautiful, really. And I appreciate that you fixed the elevator for me, but... But I just don't swing that way."
"I'm far from done, bitch," Dean answered. "Because thanks to everything we know, we can't help but ask ourselves three questions.
much better than getting laid right now," he grunted and let out another loud groan when Castiel kept kneading another tense spot on his back.
He put the shirt in the machine as well and then took off his socks and pants, and threw them in, too, leaving him standing in his boxers. I couldn't help looking down at his crotch for a moment, noticing the obvious outline of a hard dick underneath the white cloth, before my gaze flew up again.
"Ready?" Amara asked, obviously not really caring, and walked over to the console. "See you on the other side," she announced with a sadistic smirk on her face.
? Seriously?" he asked, spitting out the hateful name. Castiel tilted his head, not giving anything away.
"What's the knife for?" I ask, slightly worried but overall trusting Dean. He hasn't killed me so far, why would he do it now? Still, the sight of the knife makes me queasy.
"Finally," Castiel sighed when he pushed the older man onto the bed, not a protest in sight. Standing at the edge of the bed, Castiel looked down on him with hunger in his eyes.
That one earned a laugh from Michael's friends, all three of them cackling stupidly. Castiel wanted to kick them in the nuts. "You know what this is, Cassie?" Michael then asked, holding up the notebook to show him. "It's
"Jack, this is Cas," Dean announced, earning a disinterested glance from Jack – that was until he noticed Castiel and that he was in fact male.
"Uh, alright," he said and paused for a second, wondering if he should introduce himself as well. He didn't even know what this guy wanted. "I'm Dean," he added nevertheless, deciding to be polite for the moment and see where this would go.
"Okay then," Castiel smiled. And with those words, he grabbed Dean's hand and pulled him up the stairs behind him.
I almost felt like hitting my head against the wall. Of course, Dean only shared his bed with Castiel for
"I just wanted to speak to you alone for a second," Dean continued, his eyes impassive as ever. "See, your mom and I, we've... we've decided to move in together. I'll be living with you starting next week. I hope that's okay with you," he said, worry showing in his gaze as if he genuinely sought my approval. I was a little overwhelmed.
"Alright, look. Dude -- Castiel, was it? You're obviously confused, so let's make a few things clear," he started, raising his eyebrows dramatically. "We're on Earth, the year is 2017 and I certainly don't have the time to play this game, so please just tell me what you're doing here, okay? Or, even better, just leave."
Inias frowned. "What do you mean the robot's not there?" he asked, glancing at Metatron, who, at his words, was already starting to fume again. "You have to be in the wrong place," he insisted.
Over the course of the year, Castiel makes friends with a quirky redhead named Charlie and the demon that is Meg. Dean only knows this because despite intentionally avoiding Castiel, the boy is always in his periphery, and Dean can't help but notice these things. He also doesn't have much else to do, between him not having any friends and being bored all the time. Not that he is complaining. He could have friends if he wanted to. At least that's what he tells himself.
"You know she sometimes wishes you weren't there, right?" he asked and my eyes flew up to his in alarm. He was looking at me sympathetically, like he was sorry for the fact that my family supposedly didn't want me. A sick feeling settled in my stomach. "On some days, she hates having to care for you, too. She barely has enough money for herself to get by, how is she supposed to love you if you keep making her life twice as hard?" he contemplated and I felt tears stinging in my eyes, but I held them back.
Castiel and I moved a while later. I woke up to packed bags and a flustered looking Castiel one day, telling me to hurry up and get out to the car. Apparently, Mom had called the police on him when she saw me entering his apartment and staying the night. As soon as Castiel had found out, he'd started packing. Just like always, I didn't ask where he got the information.
I realized that Castiel had been right all along. I was nothing but a burden, an unwanted roommate, eating her food and not paying rent. It didn't matter that I worked my ass off at Bobby's because the little amount that it got me wasn't nearly enough to support even one of us.
Sam and Dean let out a relieved sigh they tried not to let Cas hear but he did so nevertheless. He didn't comment on it and instead waited patiently for Sam to open him up once more.
Tricky question, Cas thought. The man was smart. As far as Cas knew, none of the robots who got their new memories were aware of not being human. Looking at that, it was only obvious Cas had to reply with, 'I am human, sir.'
Cas furrowed his brow in confusion. The name didn't sound familiar. "I do not know," he said for what felt like the hundredth time today. "I am sorry."
"Oh, right, uh, introductions. Gabe? My brother Sam. Sammy? This is Gabe, he works in customer service," Dean falsely explained and Castiel felt the need to correct him.
"You're such an angel, baby, such a sweet, innocent angel," he mutters and hits the back of my throat when his speed increases again. Tears well up in my eyes again and I fight the urge to throw up. I know Dean is close, I only have to hold on for a
Charlie scoffed in annoyance. "The general public doesn't know everything. And you don't know that I'm wrong. Fact is, I screamed really loud in my head and the girl in front of me covered her ears. I swear she was a mind reader, Cas!"
for transporting human beings at this stage; I won't get out of there alive!" he spit out the words, just barely keeping himself from yelling. He knew that shouting at Amara would do him more harm than good; she was cruel enough as it was. But he was angry so who cared? "Who authorized this?" he then asked and crossed his arms in defense.
"You-- You two... You two?" I stuttered and they looked just as confused as I felt. "What-- I mean, how--
Dean didn't spend a lot of time with me today at all, being out of the house for once, but it's okay because I know where he is. He told me that he had to pick up an old friend, some guy named Benny... It's the first time I heard Dean talk about anyone else but Sam and I am kinda jealous but then again, Dean'll return to me every time, so I am not all that worried. I'm the one Dean
"I'm home!" Sam yelled into the house after he fit the key in the lock, and entered without hesitation. He closed the door behind Cas, who opted to stand in the entryway and look around curiously.
When Dean finally noticed him, Castiel saw his eyes widening in surprise, and unexpectedly greeted Castiel with a shy, "Hey, Cas," while flushing furiously. He didn't even check whether his friends were looking or not, which caused Castiel to halt in shock and stare after them in confusion. It was more of a public acknowledgment than he had expected from someone like Dean.
Castiel stared at me contemplatingly for a few seconds, my gaze desperately fixed on his lips but not moving. I didn't dare to. After a few seconds of horrible nothing, Castiel muttered, "Good," and
Judging by the way Castiel headed straight for one of Benny's guest bedrooms, Dean figured Castiel had checked out the rooms earlier that night, already expecting to take someone upstairs with him later. Dean didn't quite know how that made him feel.
"You're right," Castiel said, taking Dean by surprise, and looked to the left in fake contemplation. "I could've asked Gabriel, I guess. But if I wanted to impress my family, he probably wouldn't be the best choice," he decided.
What am I supposed to do? What am I even gonna do outside? I don't know anymore. The door in front of my eyes is wide open, inviting me, taunting me, knowing that I'll be back without a doubt. I feel inferior.
"I just found out that Alfie is gonna ask out Castiel today," Jess says, giggling excitedly. Dean's head whips towards her. Alfie is gonna do
When Castiel was done, he came to a stop in front of Dean's bed, looking down on Dean quietly. The moon lit up Castiel's face and he saw that he wore a thoughtful and somewhat soft expression, so Dean guessed nothing especially bad must've happened after all, and relaxed.
"You know what? Fine. Don't believe me," she pouted and sat down across from him in defeat. "But don't come crying to me when you do figure out it's true."
He let his eyes roam over the crowd. Even though the party had been in full swing when he'd arrived, it seemed as if even more people had joined them since then. And as far as Dean was concerned, he didn't know a single person around him, except for maybe one or two. The guy standing near the bar directly across from him for example, he looked familiar. Dean didn't know his name at the moment but he'd definitely seen him around school. His face had stuck with him. Those plush lips, those ocean blue eyes, that sex hair he always seemed to have...
Castiel didn't react just like before and simply started stroking me again. I was close to coming in seconds, that's how desperate my dick already was. I didn't have high hopes to be coming this time though.
A sigh. "Well then, I suppose I'll take the first, you take the second one?" he suggested and Castiel nodded quietly.
"We both do," he decides, voice hoarse, and he turns away, starting to inspect the wounds on his body. There are a few more cuts than I remember, a big one across his stomach and a smaller one on his hip, a few tiny ones on his biceps.
"It's been a long while since I've let anybody do that to me," Dean says when I'm following the cut on his throat with a finger. My eyes fly up to his. "You could've killed me."
Uncomfortably, Castiel tugged at the collar of the stupid suit thingy every one of the employees was obligated to wear and once again cursed Gabriel in his head -- this time for him being as small as he was because sadly and without a doubt, this suit was
"Why-- why'd you choke me?" I asked, voice hoarse and rough. I wasn't angry, not at all, but I still wanted to know what made him do it.
She stopped all of a sudden, eyes widening and staring at something behind him. "Oh dear," she muttered in disbelief and then a smile was tugging at her lips. Castiel turned around.
"You said you were alright with the idea. So we need hickeys. Do you want some or do you want me to have them?" he asks matter-of-factly and my eyes almost bulge out of my head. This is really about to happen, isn't it?
"I wanted to apologize for the other day. That was inappropriate," he said and my eyes went wide. I'd been completely content with never thinking about the laundry room incident again, let alone talk about it. And now Castiel had just casually mentioned it?
He kissed up Castiel's throat, unashamedly starting to nibble at his jaw, and drew a small moan out of Castiel. He blushed furiously but Dean didn't even react to it.
He refused to believe it. It was irrational and stupid and oh god, how catastrophic would it be if Dean really
I smile at the warmth in Dean's voice. His brother is the only person he talks about with such open love and affection, and it makes me feel warm just hearing about it. It reminds me of my own family.
The man's head jerked up, his curly gray hair moving on his head agitatedly, and his face distorted into an ugly grimace. "250?" he asked, unhappy. "That's the population of a small city! It's not nearly enough," he decided and slammed his hand down on the desk for emphasis. It didn't do much except hurt his hand.
Then again, my panic was long overdue, seeing as I've been in Dean's basement for about two weeks already without any serious attack. I knew it was gonna happen sooner or later. That doesn't change the fact that I hate the feeling of helplessness and like I'm not getting enough oxygen.
"Then they'll for sure notice Cas missing, if they haven't already. I'll drive a state over tomorrow and hide it somewhere, so if Cas's absence gains attention, they get the wrong location. It wouldn't do us any good if a potentially dangerous guy came after us," he decided. Dean grumbled but agreed reluctantly. "And we still have to figure out what exactly is going on here..."
"Oh yeah? She's never home, Dean, how would you know? She's at work or asleep, that's all she does, so why are you so sure she really loves you?" Castiel looked at me with a hard gaze that made me bite back the words that were on the tip of my tongue. "I'm the only one who's being honest with you and I'm doing it to protect you, can't you see that?"
And damn it, but Dean honestly didn't know how to answer that one. 'Because it's a medical drama,' he wanted to say. 'It's
It was a few weeks later that I finally realized. I'd forgotten almost all about the weird incident from before and I'd stopped wondering about my brother and his friend, when I visited them again.
acting fairly un-human after all. And since it was Dean, he wouldn't have taken offense in any case.
I hummed when he said that, the anticipation of being allowed to moan and gasp and pant making me more excited than anything. I felt his slender fingers pressing against my hole lightly, massaging it but not yet breaking inside. I squirmed in anticipation.
"C-Castiel Novak," Castiel stuttered, flustered, trying to get control of himself and his visibly awestruck face again.
Castiel was used to Dean's inexplicable temper tantrums and even though he didn't know the reasons for most of them -mostly Dean's possessive tendencies-, he was a saint for putting up with them. It was a surprise Castiel hadn't figured out what was going on yet, but then again, maybe he
So Dean follows him the next few days, secretly accompanying Castiel to all of his classes and waiting for him across the hallway after they're over, and Castiel never notices a thing. Or so Dean thinks, at least, until Castiel is suddenly gone from his view one second to the next, and Dean is left looking around for him frantically.
to press the button. Now come on," he yelled and gripped her arm again, pulling her out of her booth and towards the stairs despite her protests.
"Would've never thought Dean was one of them though. I was convinced he'd have made a move on you if he was," she kept talking, hitting Castiel's feelings like a freight train at 100 miles per hour. "Oh, right, sorry," she apologized when she saw the look on his face. "That was inappro--"
And because Dean didn't seem to be able to say no to anything tonight, he agreed without a second thought.
"Well, it's a... It's a teleporter," Castiel said bashfully, knowing how ridiculous he had to sound. Nobody really believed in teleportation yet, knowing how much energy it would take and how much damage it could do to a person if it was done wrong. People were scared of the risks and skeptical, and Dean probably didn't think any differently... Nevertheless, Castiel wouldn't give up. He was determined to be the first person to ever build a functioning teleporter and he would freaking deliver!
Starting that day, I saw Castiel almost daily. It was mostly coincidence, pretty much every time I came back from school or work. He was always in front of his flat, just about to open or close the door, when I arrived. Sometimes he had grocery bags with him, another time he was about to leave for the laundry room. No matter what he did though, I somehow managed to see him every single day.
First of all, Dean had come in rather early the day after, having gotten used to receiving flowers in the mornings. Needless to say, there were no flowers that day and Dean wasn't sure why he was feeling so out of it when no delivery came. He was surprised, for the most part. And bothered. But he knew he had no reason to feel that way. He had more or less
"Okay, um... I'm gonna... open you up now," Sam said hesitantly and reached out a hand. There was the sound of a cover being opened and as soon as he did, Cas froze on the spot, all thoughts gone. It was as if he was in a trance; he was still there but he barely noticed what was going on around him.
It was heaven on earth and the moan that left Dean's mouth was other-worldly. "Holy fucking shit," he cursed, bucking up into the heat and holding on to Castiel for dear life. Nothing he had ever felt compared to this. Nothing had ever felt this amazing.
"Hey guys," I said, sitting down next to Charlie and she promptly laid her head down on my shoulder. We'd grown to be really good friends as well.
He knows he can't let it happen, can't let Castiel end up with the wrong person when he deserves better than that. He has to try and stop it, some way or another.
As if that would still bother Inias at this point. Nevertheless, he nodded and turned to leave the room, already planning what he had to do to find the robot for Jimmy Novak. First, he had to find out which hospital he'd been delivered to.
"Who was the one to take you in when nobody wanted you? To love you unconditionally? To make you scream in pleasure whenever you needed it?" Castiel growled, a third finger pressing against my pucker, just waiting for the right answer to push inside.
He pulls me closer and kisses me, slow and sensual. It's the first time he's kissed me like this and I crave more of it. It feels like pure love.
"No, it's really not. I was selfish. I climaxed in front of you and neglected to take care of you afterwards, even though you were so obviously aroused. It wasn't fair. In my defense, you didn't give me a lot of time to help before you left," Castiel said, voice plain but regretful. I flinched at his words. How could he say stuff like that without feeling ashamed?
"Hello Dean, come on in," Castiel said instead and stepped away from the door. Dean came inside, sending him a shy smile. "Nice house."
Breakfast passed uneventfully, even though that lustful gleam in Dean's eyes was back, making me shift in my seat with arousal and guilt. I ignored the latter determinedly. Nobody knew, and Mom was still happily oblivious.
Dean stared back in reluctant wonder. Then he said, "You're no fun," and turned around to walk back to the couch. Cas looked back down at the cube with a small smile and began mixing the colors up again so he could start anew.
He walks down a narrow street. It's cold and misty and he can barely see what's ahead of him, but that doesn't bother him much. He doesn't know where he's headed anyway, so he simply continues walking.
"What do you mean? Who've you been thinking about?" Benny insisted and I squirmed slightly. I decided I'd tell him the truth, or parts of it.
In an attempt to distract Dean from figuring it out, Castiel pressed his lips against Dean's, grinding his hips against the older man's. Dean let out a happy little groan and opened his mouth sloppily, eager for Castiel's tongue. The cab driver in the front cleared his throat to get their attention but neither of them cared enough to stop. The man would just have to suffer through.
This was it, he realized. This might be the beginning or the end of him. Neither Sam nor Dean were a hundred percent sure if turning off the computer would turn off
"Yes, that's the one. He can be... difficult sometimes, but out of all my brothers, he's the one I like best," Castiel explained.
The extra day didn't help, to be honest, but at least he'd had a day off. He still went to work in a dark spirit the next day.
I was sitting on the couch with Cas at the moment, each of us nursing a beer, and we were talking about our classes while waiting for Dean to come home. Cas and Dean were almost done with college, which meant they had to start planning ahead. Apparently, they had it all figured out though.
"Dean--" I gasp when his lips close around my nipples, sucking enthusiastically, and my body arches into his. My erection collides with his own hard dick and the groan we let out at that makes me crave more. I rub my dick against his through our boxers, not caring about anything else and not patient enough to take off this one last piece of clothing.
I set my empty plate down at the kitchen counter and left the apartment, feeling violated, angry and insecure.
My gaze flies up to him again in horror and I shake my head quickly. I have never nor will I ever kill a human being with my own two hands. Not if I can avoid it.
But Dean still didn't let any of it get to him. He reveled in the attention, lived on with his not-so-secret-to-anyone-who-wasn't-oblivious boyfriend and had fun bragging about him having sex in school like he'd always done.
"Doesn't feel all that great, huh? Getting roofied," Castiel asked smugly and Dean glared at him. Before he could answer with something witty though, the feeling of being sick punched him in the gut like a freight train and he groaned again, in pain. "Cas, please, untie me, I think I'm gonna be sick," he warned and Castiel did as he said. Seconds later, Dean was on his feet and sprinting for the bathroom. Luckily for him, the door was literally right next to the bed.
At the same time our relationship was progressing though -whatever kind of relationship that was-, I distanced myself from Mom. Not that it was hard. I only saw her half an hour every day, right before she left for work, so it was not a big deal not to talk to her. It was better if I stayed away, I knew that, but after everything, it still made me a little depressed.
Sam looked at him expressionlessly, arms crossed over his chest, and waited for him to elaborate. Dean didn't indulge him though and simply grinned at him instead.
?" Castiel asked and shot a quick look at the awkward man standing next to Amara. He guiltily averted his eyes when he caught Castiel looking and fixed his gaze on Amara instead.
"Why?" he demanded, slowly getting sick of the way Castiel was acting lately. "Why won't you let me defend you for once? Why won't you
"Either that or they were the first ones who got replaced," Dean said. "Also, this probably isn't the only hospital that's in on it. Cas said there were other robots with him, and they went into different vans with different destinations, so it's possible that there's hospitals all over the country that are doing the same."
"I'm making pancakes, no matter what you two would prefer," Dean shouted over to us and Cas smirked at that, saying, "You know I love pancakes."
"Can I ask... why?" Castiel asked hesitantly and his gaze flickered to Dean shortly and back to the wall.
- spoke up when he heard Dean's grunt of pain. Opening his eyes with some difficulty, Dean found intense blue ones staring right back at him. The bastard was wearing a shit-eating grin.
"Who are you?" he asks, not unfriendly, and I notice his heavy accent immediately. I narrow my eyes suspiciously.
"But..." Castiel started, not knowing where to start. There were so many things wrong with this. "But
"What is it, Dean?" he muttered and I was speechless for a second. Castiel didn't seem surprised or bothered by seeing me in his bed, apparently he didn't regret last night or think it was weird. I didn't know if I should be glad or scared.
"Sounds like it was an accident though," Sam decided, but judging by the look on Dean's face, Dean didn't trust the whole thing. He seemed apprehensive and unsure what to think.
pregnancy test as an explanation. For a second, Castiel wondered which poor girl at his school had gotten herself pregnant
"My name is not Gabriel and I do not work in customer service," he announced soberly. Dean turned his head back towards him.
Dean simply stares at me for a second or two, not quite getting what I was talking about, when it suddenly dawns on him.
By the time Friday came around, Dean was basically a mess, his head filled with a confusing mix of anticipation, anxiousness, and guilt, while he desperately tried to decide on what to wear. All Jack had to contribute to the topic was a shrug and a sweet, but totally unhelpful, "You look good in everything, Dad." God, Dean loved his son.
But it was okay. He had expected Dean not to be able to get aroused while on drugs. It was only natural. Then again, this wasn't about riding Dean, this was about
"Your new neighbor?" he asked, frowning in confusion. "Why would he say something like that? And why would you even talk to him about it?"
Friday came simultaneously way too fast and way too slowly. He kinda couldn't wait to see Cas again; he was a cool dude after all, and they'd gotten along famously at the Roadhouse. At the same time, though, Dean was somewhat anxious about going on a date with a man, not necessarily because he was worried people would be rude, but because he simply didn't know how to make it special for Castiel. He really wanted him to have a good experience, so that he'd have no problem asking out other men - actually gay men - in the future. But Dean didn't know how to behave on gay dates. With women it was easy - a few compliments here and there, a heavy dash of flirting, a hand on their forearm, and it was basically a done deal. With guys, Dean didn't know what to expect.
"I'm serious," he snickers himself and even though I'm pouting slightly, a grin steals itself on my face. I can't stay mad when everything is funny.
On the fifth day, everything was finished. Castiel sent Jimmy to get a few test objects, just to see if it was working the way it should, and Jimmy didn't hesitate to do so.
I heard Dean casually following me back to the dining room where Mom was already waiting for us, smiling up at Dean happily. My new step-dad smiled back and pressed a gentle kiss to her lips, while I sat down quietly.
, actually, but he doesn't like that name," Dean explained and I could tell he was excited. Ever since he got accepted at college, he'd been impatient to finally get there. He'd moved in a week ago. And even though he'd never admit it, I could tell he'd been somewhat anxious about making friends.
Seemingly not in the mood to entertain Cas, Dean stood up and put away both their plates with Cas watching his every move. Dean was a fascinating human being, overly wary or not, and there wasn't much more to watch anyway.
The boy joins him a second later and smiles at Dean in thanks, but Dean pointedly ignores him. Those eyes are dangerous and even though he isn't quite sure why, he feels safer not watching them.
I woke up early the next day. I always woke up early, no matter if I had school or not, and I couldn't go back to sleep either, so I decided to read through a book and settle down on the couch. Dean and Cas were still asleep, making it peacefully quiet in the flat.
And standing there, fucked out and with a sick feeling in my stomach, I realized the reason why I didn't ever fight him. Why I let him do all those things to me. Why I
Dean looked Cas up and down in interest, a small grin beginning to spread on his face, and without stopping his staring, he said, "Sammy, who's your handsome friend?" The lewd smirk never vanished and he winked at Cas suggestively.
There was a voice Castiel didn't quite recognize. It was weirdly familiar. He couldn't put a face to it though...
Walking past the tables, he noticed the librarian waving at him with a big smile on her face and he hesitantly lifted his hand in a greeting. He didn't know this woman and was therefore a little put out by her friendliness. So, a bit insecure about her motives, Cas entered an aisle full off books to get out of her sight. It was as good a hiding place as any.
He kinda felt bad for Castiel now though. The guy didn't deserve Amara's rage -- in fact, nobody did. But what was he supposed to do? Fire her? Dean couldn't even imagine her wrath if he did
"Hey, you!" an angry voice came from behind him and Castiel closed his eyes in frustration. Another mad customer.
It was understandable though. Benny had changed schools quite recently, so he'd invited everybody he knew from his old school and most people from his new school, and here they were, in Benny's huge ass house with this crazy amount of kids who were technically not allowed to drink the alcohol they were drinking.
"You're... straight?" Castiel asked and his face was scrunched up in a mix of confusion and sadness. "But I thought... And you said the dates were great and you really liked me, and... I just hoped... Are you sure?"
"It's fine, Dean, I know what you're trying to say and don't worry. I won't tell anyone about the night we
It took a few seconds before Dean realized what was happening. And then he couldn't help the laugh bursting out of him without his approval. He'd finally realized what the hell was going on. Castiel was freaking
Dean chuckled. "Alright." He stared into Castiel’s eyes for another few seconds. "You know..." Dean then started. "Now that there's nothing stopping me, will you... um... be my boyfriend, maybe?"
"Shit, I gotta take a photo of this," he mumbled, scrambling off Dean to get his cell phone out of his pocket. When he finally found it, he took a picture of Dean and him kissing with come all over their faces.
They turned back to look at me, Mom raising her eyebrows expectantly, a silent question in her eyes. I nodded, giving her a silent, 'Go ahead, he can move in,' and she smiled, relieved. I'd never stand in the way of Mom's happiness and apparently this Dean really did make her happy. I certainly wouldn't screw it up for her just because I got a strange vibe from him...
A man stood in front of me, key in hand, staring at me with wide eyes. I stared back. Holy hell, did he have nice eyes. They were as blue as the ocean and I supposed I could drown in them just as easily. His hair was dark and messy, like he'd been running his hands through it all day long, and I guessed he must've been around forty years old.
The cab driver gained their attention with some difficulty and Castiel paid him, before pulling Dean outside by his collar. Dean was stumbling significantly and instinctively held on to Castiel, slumping against him heavily. Honestly, it was a little draining to drag him into the house, Dean being heavier than he'd expected, and Castiel somewhat regretted having waited so long to take Dean home. Now it was too late though, and even though it was a bit exhausting, Castiel managed to open the door and pull Dean inside.
"Please," I whispered, suppressing a sob, and Castiel's eyes softened. I didn't usually get that whiny during sex, but normally, I wasn't denied to touch or kiss the other person. What was wrong with him?
I ignored all the signs that this was creepy and wrong, and forced myself to calm down instead. Maybe Castiel was simply attentive, and he'd heard me talking to somebody in the hallway. Or he'd talked to Mom and she'd mentioned it to him. I didn't know. But there was probably a really simple reason for it all.
to come, okay, please," I reasoned, but Castiel didn't react in any other way than in starting to jerk me off again, so I stopped arguing. There was no use, Castiel did what he wanted anyway.
"I know, sweetheart, I know," she replied exhaustedly and instead of adding anything else, she put her head in her hands like she was beginning to develop a headache.
I feel so close to him in that moment, it's almost as if I could just climb inside of him and stay there forever.
, Castiel thought. This had been supposed to be a punishment for Dean. A humiliating experience! Instead, Dean had taken it and made it his masturbatory fantasy...
And there he was, Dean Winchester, face as red as a tomato, as he searched his gaze nervously and asked, "Castiel Novak, will you go out with me?"
Before he could worry about it any further, a thought crossed his mind. Maybe he didn't need to find some kind of button or lever or whatever. Maybe destroying the thing might work just as well. This way nobody could ever turn the whole thing on again.
"Lean over," he ordered and I bowed down, revealing my hole to him completely, propping myself up on my hands. "You can make all the sounds you want today, Dean."
A hand on my back before he sat down to eat, fingers tousling my hair playfully. His foot travelling up my leg while we ate, finding its way between my thighs quickly. I almost choked on my food when he did that. He quickly withdrew then though, leaving me behind with a half-hard cock and no appetite.
Suddenly the lips are gone, leaving me aching for more, and the beautiful face is looking down at me smugly, dick still pushing in and out of me relentlessly. I feel so amazing it's almost unnatural.
"A-Alright." Castiel blinked. He didn't expect that turn of events but oh well. "Choose an object then," he said, calmed down by the fact that their conversation was work-related now.
that made Cas's heartbeat fasten that much, sent a pleasant shiver down Dean's spine, and a desperate wave of want made his own breathing stutter.
"At home," Castiel replied, a little flustered. "Gabe said it wasn't appropriate to wear for a date, and put me in these clothes instead," he gestured down his body.
"No, it is not-- You did not do anything wrong, Dean," Cas said, purposely catching Dean's gaze and holding it. "It is not your fault," he insisted.
Fifteen minutes passed without a word spoken, hands buried deep in the waste of others, and the only thing they found was that students were fucking
When he arrived at school, Castiel walked to his locker to get his books for first period when he saw Dean walking in the other direction surrounded by some friends of his. They were all laughing and joking with each other, but Dean himself seemed quiet and distracted. Castiel wondered what was going on with him - not that it was any of his business.
"I- uh-" Alfie starts, nervously sneaking a glance at Dean, who is staring him down murderously. He swallows visibly, but then seems to make a decision and looks back at Castiel confidently, lifting his head higher. "I wanted to ask if you would like to go out with me some time," he eventually says, voice steadier than Dean would have expected, and keeps his gaze on Castiel's face, awaiting a reaction.
"Hel-- Oh, thank God!" the voice exclaims, sobbing in relief, and when I see his face, I instantly know who this voice belongs to. My blood freezes.
"He's not," I protested, knowing that I was wrong but not wanting to admit it. Castiel was wonderful most of the time, just every once in a while he said stuff that hit me hard.
"You need to help me, man!" Alastair pleads, not having recognized me yet. "This sick guy kidnapped me and tortured me and he's just so fucking
"A couple. They checked on us from time to time. Our backs. I do not know what they were doing. Like I mentioned, the covers were kept open until they made us enter the vans."
He didn't know how long exactly he lay there, eyes on the ceiling and ignoring everything around him, but it must've been a while. It was getting kinda hot in here, Dean realized belatedly, probably because of all those sweating people on the dance floor at the other end of the room - not that he minded a lot at the moment.
. His head was still thumping painfully, but Dean had had hangovers as bad as this, so it was manageable.
"Sure, Charles," he replied, not even looking up from his work. There was no such thing as mind readers, everybody knew that. And just because Charlie had 'the ultimate proof,' there was no reason to believe her. It was
"It has a brown leather cover and is about this big," Castiel answered, showing its size with his hands. "And..." he hesitated, wondering whether he should tell him the truth. "It's the only thing I have left from my mother... That's why it's so important," he explained quietly.
"So you've talked to Castiel and he decided that your mom didn't love you," Benny repeated, unbelieving, and I nodded hesitantly.
Slowly, I was beginning to feel drained, my complaining becoming less and less, and I was exhausted beyond belief. After the sixth time he denied me an orgasm, my head dropped forward onto his shoulder, tears burning in my eyes and soaking his shirt. "Please, Cas," I whispered into his shoulder weakly. I was sure I'd die if he refused me one more time.
"Sure thing, Clarence," she finally said and winked at him. Castiel only fixed her with an annoyed glare.
The apartment itself was small but had everything necessary. It had a decent living room, a kitchen, a bathroom and two bedrooms; to keep it short, everything you needed but not more. It was enough for them and it didn't take long until they'd moved all their stuff.
"Do you think we should lie him down somewhere?" the first voice said tentatively. "A mattress or something?"
After getting with the program, Dean let Castiel in with little to no hesitation, letting out a filthy moan at the feeling of Castiel's tongue against his. He grabbed Castiel's shirt and pulled him even closer against him.
"Uh, yes?" Dean replied eventually, realizing he hadn't said anything for too long a time, which was probably why the guy was looking so uncomfortable. Dean forced a small smile on his face, too, so he wouldn't appear as mean as he probably seemed at the moment.
"Ah, there he is!" John Winchester's voice suddenly sounded from behind him, right on cue. Castiel rolled his eyes defeatedly for a moment, before turning around with a weak smile on his face.
"It's easier to just roll with it and not question it," Jimmy announced. "That's what I'm doing, anyway."
"Just turned 18," he lied smoothly. He was actually 21, but he looked younger, younger than 18 even, and he knew Dean would believe him the second he told him.
"Come in, Amara," he said defeatedly, preparing himself for the worst, and leaned back in his seat. Amara was alright, really, if a little blunt and insensitive at times. She was also
They were basically standing in the living room, a couch and a TV on their right, and they could see the kitchen from where they were standing. Cas noticed a movement in there seconds before a voice answered, "Did you bring food?"
Sam and Dean went to bed soon after. It had gotten late with the whole questioning and opening Cas up et cetera. Cas still didn't know how long they'd been working on him, but it had to have been a while because when they were done, they'd quickly apologized for being tired and disappeared in their respective rooms.
The fight didn't go on for much longer though. Judging by the look on their faces when they came back in, Sam had won the argument, leaving Dean pouting a step behind his brother. Cas couldn't help but stare at him.
boy," he said. "And you're gonna be even better with my cock inside of you," he promised and pulled his fingers out of my hole, making me clench around nothing uncomfortably.
"Hey, Asstiel!" Michael, the asshat, exclaimed when he walked by, having spotted him by coincidence, two of his friends in tow. God knows it was just Castiel's luck to have his favorite bullies finding his secret spot.
And then he proceeded to call his mom and asked her whether she had time to watch Jack on Friday. As luck would have it, she did.
He pressed the button without much hesitation. Dean disappeared and then waved at him from the other side of the room. Castiel smiled as the crowd applauded.
"I..." Dean supplied again, a pained expression in his eyes. "I don't--" he stuttered, not knowing what to say. Then, a defeated expression spread on his face.
And that was when he felt how Castiel's cock was steadily hardening in his pants. At that, Dean had to stop the kiss for a second, panting heavily, feeling more than a little overwhelmed.
As soon as Dean was gone, he looked down at the small pill in his hand. Beside this one, there had been no other ones in Dean's jacket, meaning he wouldn't be able to spike another drink of his, thankfully.
"I'm, uh, I'm working on two things, actually. Have been for a while... The first one is a solar powered outlet. You attach it to a window and if it's day, you have electricity," Castiel started, growing a little more relaxed. Work was safe territory for him. "I'm almost done, though, it shouldn't take me long to figure out the last kinks."
Even without my own help though, I was about to come within minutes. I was panting hard, forcing myself to stay still with everything I had. I was so close.
Castiel leaned in a little more, carefully coaxing Dean's mouth open with his tongue, making Dean moan in surprise. And suddenly, the heat from the party was there all over again, burning low in Castiel's stomach, making him impatient, and so he pushed Dean down on the sofa and crawled over him without hesitation. Dean groaned once more when Castiel rubbed their groins together, and Castiel couldn't help but join him.
By the time he knocked a third time, he started yelling through the door. "Come on, man, I know you're in there!" Benny said loudly and he sounded annoyed, upset by my sudden change in behavior, and I flinched involuntarily. "Open the fucking door!"
"I mean, I know you're not really into PDA, but it'd mean a lot to me to have you there, and we wouldn't have to, like, kiss or anything, I just--" Dean continued when he didn't get an answer immediately.
"I am looking for the control room, sir," Cas offered the truth. "Could you, by any chance, tell me where it is?" he prompted. It was worth a try after all. "I have trouble remembering."
, and what would 'Dr. Sexy MD' be without Dr. Sexy anyway?" he uttered, winking at Cas, and Cas squinted awkwardly with one eye in a pathetic attempt to copy him.
When all three meals were prepared, Dean took the plates and walked into the living room where Castiel and Jack were still playing with the trains -apparently trains were able talk with each other now- and sat the plates down on the table.
I sucked on his tongue eagerly when it entered my mouth and moaned thankfully. His kisses were like a drug to me.
"Uh... No," I replied, still a little dazed, and tried to lean in again but he kept me from doing so. I squirmed in his lap. I
Castiel must've realized that and pulled me up with him, carrying me over to the kitchen counter and setting me down on it. He smiled when he met my tired gaze and wiped our clothes clean with a wet cloth as best as he could. When he was done, he put my arms around his neck and pulled me up on his hips. He carried me towards his bed and gently laid me down on it.
"Please," I begged, clutching to his shirt and pulling him closer. "Need you," I whispered and Dean's breath quickened, lips attacking my mouth, tongue parting my lips eagerly. I'd never really been kissed before but Dean didn't seem to care that I was clumsy,
"Thank you," Cas emphasized and Dean slapped him on the butt one last time before walking into the kitchen. Cas seemed unfazed.
"Could you, um... could you tell Dean that he won't have to worry about the elevator anymore? Dean Winchester, I mean? I fixed it yesterday, so it shouldn't be a bother anymore," he explained, his face beginning to heat up under Meg's intense gaze, and he shifted uncomfortably. Meg always made him uneasy.
"Sam might," I thought out loud. "He's always been great to me. He left for college though and I barely talk to him anymore."
Turns out they have three classes together. Castiel is new, which explains how Dean had never seen him before, and Dean kinda wants to help him get settled at this school but he also kinda wants to stay as far away from him as possible, so, in all of their shared classes, Dean decides to hide in the back of the room the second he sees Castiel. Luckily, Castiel doesn't seem to be too upset about Dean's distance, even though he does throw a few glances in his direction at the beginning. He eventually gets the hint when Dean won't meet his eyes though and turns away from him once and for all. Dean's sure he imagines the disappointment in his face.
I filled a plate with noodles and gave it to her, then I took another one for myself. We sat down at the table and ate quietly. I could feel that Mom was lost in thought.
I contemplate screaming for help. But I have no idea if there are any people nearby and I might just draw my kidnappers attention. I don't exactly want that.
After that night at the party, Dean hadn't been able to get Castiel out of his head. He'd replayed the memory of that night in his head at least a hundred times since then, fuzzy as it was, and had jerked off to it more often than he'd like to admit.
His second finger pressed inside right next to his first one. I moaned again, trying to fuck myself onto Dean's finger and he increased his speed slightly when he felt how eager I was. It didn't take long until I was ready for the third one.
"It's just... I really like you, you know?" Dean admitted and looked back down at Castiel's chest. A sweet blush was covering his face and Castiel damn near melted at the sight.
Slowly, his hand wandered up my thigh, making my dick twitch in anticipation, and this time, I couldn't suppress the moan.
But then, a single moment before I came, Castiel wrapped his hand around the base of my cock tightly, successfully preventing me from coming hard. I sobbed loudly, not able to hold it in.
Dean smiled back. "You're welcome, sweetheart," he replied. "Safe me a seat?" he asked, winking at Castiel, who nodded, and turned to walk towards the bar. Castiel let go of him willingly.
"I--" Cas started and he obviously didn't know how to say what he was thinking. "I am afraid... I will not be able to have sex with you, Dean," he eventually said and Dean frowned in surprise at his bluntness. Then Cas started rambling, which in itself was very unusual for him. "It just appears that my penis is more for show than use and I do not want to get your hopes up because I physically cannot get erected. I understand that humans enjoy sex and I am sorry, Dean, I really am, but it is simply not possible with me," he explained, looking away shamefully, and Dean cupped Cas's cheeks again, turning his head back towards him.
, Metatron thought. A hard task to achieve, but not impossible, he believed. Or, well, it wouldn't be, if his employees weren't such goddamn
When they eventually stopped, Cas almost believed they were only stopping for gas. But then the back doors opened and the same small man from before shut his cover forcefully and pulled him outside. Or, well, inside. Since they were standing in the very same factory hall Cas had started out in.
On the other hand, though, it would probably the most memorable. So he leaned in anyway. When his lips finally touched Dean's, he decided that yeah, it was definitely not the best place to kiss, but none of that mattered when Dean returned the sentiment and kissed back with all he had.
Those were the last words I had to say on that topic and Castiel sensed this. "I already do love you, Dean," he said and I shuddered slightly.
"No... When I saw that the others had left me, I looked around, and left the building when I could not find them. I walked the streets, hoping to find someone I recognized. I did not find anyone," Cas continued. "I was walking for a few hours."
A few hours later, Castiel and Dean were sitting on the couch next to each other, Jack having gone to bed already. Surprisingly enough, the boy had hugged Castiel goodbye before leaving, and Dean didn't quite know what to make of that. His heart felt warm, but his stomach was tight. He knew he'd have to have the talk with Castiel now.
, so his brother wouldn't feel too guilty. Then he put his phone back into his pocket and waved at Ellen for another beer.
Dean had gotten up early again, like every day lately, and strolled into the building. His attention was on Meg right away and they talked until the delivery guy came. Once Dean took the flowers, a smirk on his face, he said goodbye to Meg and left towards the elevator.
He stayed exactly where he was, silently waiting for Sam to come back, but Dean seemed to have other plans. He walked around Cas to stand in front of him and crossed his arms. "So,
"Thanks. But, you know, my room is even nicer," Castiel promised, winking at Dean suggestively. It was better to get straight to the point in cases like this. "Want me to show you?"
"Yes, Dean, that's exactly what it means," Castiel said and smiled in a way Dean had never seen him smile before. Dean couldn't believe what he was hearing.
Castiel smiled at him in amusement. "The wedding wasn't as exciting as I had hoped," he began. "In fact, I was dying for a chance to get the hell out of there. So when Balthazar hooked up with one of the bridesmaids halfway through, I took the chance to make a scene and left early," he explained, chuckling.
"You a virgin, Cas?" Dean asked, pressing his crotch against my ass again, making me gasp quietly. I nodded breathlessly.
"Listen, man, I really don't have time for this. You'd do me a huge favor if you explained to me why you came out of my fucking teleporter and why the hell I feel like I'm looking into a mirror," the voice said, a little impatient, and Castiel forced his eyes open again slowly. This time the pain was bearable.
On his way back to the car, Dean's phone pinged with a new message, and he opened it curiously. It was from Castiel and it made Dean smile.
I sucked in a sharp breath when he started stroking, teasing me with experienced hands, and I couldn't help but thrust up into his grip.
"You can't leave me, Dean," I say and my voice breaks unexpectedly. I start to cry without warning, my hand around his foot loosening until it slides to the floor limply. "Please don't leave me," I sob.
"Everything," Dean replied teasingly, knowing he was about to drive Sam crazy. He continued before Sam could say anything. "I know how Cas's maker did it, Sam. I know what their plan is and I know how they pull it of. And believe it or not, their plan really
"We're together," I continue for him, eyes still on Cas, and we smile at each other happily. If only all of this was real.
," Dean read slowly, voicing Castiel's insecurities out loud, and it was terrifying. Dean shouldn't read this, he shouldn't know about any of it. It was private!
"I never fell off a stupid ladder," he admitted cheekily and smirked when Castiel's face contorted into a confused frown. "I also never had any back pains. I just wanted to mess wit customer service and get a nice laugh out of it," he continued contently.
In an attempt to save what was left to save, he muttered, "That doesn't mean all love hurts though. Love can be amazing if you let it be." He didn't know what even made him say it -he wasn't usually the emotional type of guy-, but it seemed like the obvious thing to do when Cas was having that forlorn expression on his face.
Deep in thought, he passes a store window and slows down, something catching his eye. He tilts his head. It's a TV and it's running, a news channel informing people about the events of the day. He can't hear what they're saying and the video quality is bad, but he watches nevertheless.
"Can we get to work now, Castiel? I know you want to go home and make out with your boyfriend, don't you? Come on," he insisted and ignored the way Castiel blushed. He stood up quickly.
Forcing them open, the action taking more energy than anticipated, he groaned at the brightness of his surroundings. Why did everything have to hurt so much?
But that would change today, he decided. He was gonna do his damnest to try and date Castiel, and if it was the last thing he did.
"You were right," I said, deciding that I just wanted to get it off my chest, no matter how he would react. "Mom doesn't love me anymore."
Leaving the woman shouting at Raphael, knowing she'd shut up the minute he opened his mouth, Castiel stepped a safe distance away. He didn't want to deal with all this anymore and even though he knew the next customer complaint would find him soon enough, he wanted to indulge in those short, sweet minutes of silence.
"Come on, I took one, too," Dean says, irises almost black from whatever it was he took. It makes me panic. "Swallow," he orders again and his eyes are vicious.
I'd say, at the bottom of his heart, Castiel was a good man. Most of the time, at least. He worked from home, and he sometimes ignored me for hours and hours when he was on his laptop, but he provided for us both without much effort.
"Cas and I already decided that we're gonna be roommates next semester, by the way. His guy sucks," Dean explained and I choked on my pizza. He's known this guy for, what, four days, and they'd already decided to be roommates? Wow, this Cas guy must be
"Part three, the teleportation of a live rodent," he muttered and pulled the rat out of its cage on its tail. He showed the camera, set it down and pressed the button quickly before it could run away. That was the hardest part with living test objects -- they always ran.
"Shut--" I start but realize that I'm about to say the same thing the third time and I will not give Cas one more reason to laugh at me. "Well, do you have an idea or not?" I ask impatiently. "April Fools is tomorrow already."
