The cafe Sam takes him to is not far from the hotel, and also decorated for Christmas. It’s a mishmash of wooden chairs and tables in a far different style than the diners Dean's used to. Sam sighs, “Trust me, man, it may be kitschy - but you’ll like it.”
“Cas -” Dean sighs before walking into his space again. “I never should have said that. I wish I could blame what I said on Chuck, but it was me and it was fucked up. We’ve both fucked a lot of things up, but I can't keep saying I want free will then be mad at you for using yours. Especially when you’re just trying to do the right thing. It's not going to work anymore.”
“Maybe he was trying to fix you." Dean shrugs, "I mean he did rebuild you, maybe he was trying to make you follow his plans or something. I don’t know Cas, it's just a theory."
"Hey ah - “Dean ducks his head looking for a name tag, "- Anna. Do you have any messages for me?"
Cas nods and finds the lube looking at Dean questioningly as he warms the gel on his fingers. "Just take it nice and easy," Dean guides him, licking his lips as Cas circles his hole. He moans loudly as Cas's pushes his finger in until the first knuckle. The old familiar ache making arch into Cas's touch. Fuck it's been a while, Dean has no clue why he stopped seeking out men. Probably because he kept comparing them to Cas in his head. "That's it Cas, just like that."
The man, Cas, smiles softly; creating small crinkles near his eyes that Dean is just not equipped to deal with right now. “I told you I would.”
Dean chokes on a strawberry, Castiel snorts. Watching as Dean stammers before he gets to his feet. He needs to text Meg and let her know he won’t be home tonight. “I’m going to go to the bathroom, then we can do whatever you want okay. With a whole night ahead you’ve got plenty of options.”
Eventually, Kaia clears her throat and they pull apart. "So, did it work?" She asks, biting her lip.
Stumbling to his feet Dean groans as he stretches. He's tired and his spine feels like a tin of sardines, but he still pulls out his phone and checks his calls,
He presses a kiss to Cas's cheek, suddenly remembering that day those shadows grew from Cas's back in the barn. It’s the closest he’s going to come to seeing this beautiful creature and hates that. He makes a note to grab Cas some colouring pencils when all this is over. This is something he has to see in colour.
Dean blinks, "Uh, well, you gotta exorcise it — which you don't know how to do..." he sighs, tapping at his mug. "I could leave you my number. Y'know, just in case."
“I'm not going on the stand under contract to say whatever you think will let you win.” Dean snaps, trying not to pace.
Castiel rolls his eyes. “There are wipes in the nightstand.”
Dean groans, “Why would I bring Cas?”
“Dean-”
: You like my dick.
: That wasn't a denial.
Castiel shakes his head. “A way to kill a ghost.”
"Dean?" Hannah says carefully, "How did you know where Lucifer was?"
"Last week, we had dinner together."
Castiel hums under his breath, tempting Dean with a fourth finger as he kisses his neck. "So just me then."
"The only person that truly belongs there." She says looking at Cas.
It's raining when Dean drives into Boston.
"Castiel told me you were a guardian," Kelly says, making it sound like an accusation.
Dean also kind of wants to smack him. Instead, he stands on shaky legs and reaches for his underwear. "Well there's always tomorrow."
Dean rolls his eyes. “So what? That doesn’t mean you have to go man.”
Castiel folds his arms across his chest, “So did you.”
Dean turns off his engine, taking a steadying breath as the motorcycle pulls up behind him. The officer that climbs off is wearing a leather jacket over his uniform. Dark aviators protecting his eyes from the morning rays. He takes off his helmet as he walks towards the car. Despite only seeing it for one night, Dean would recognize that body anywhere.
Settling his wings more comfortably against his back Dean groans. All the stress means he’ll need a groom soon, not that he can afford it. Twitchy and irritated, he drinks his coffee black and tries to find the motivation to get back to his desk. He's sure those kids Hannah has left him are great, but he can't look at them. Not yet. He's still trying to find the will to move when Charlie storms in. Her red hair sticking up with a strong electrical current as she makes her way to the coffee pot.
At least until the world went to shit.
Cas rolls his eyes, "Yes Dean that's Pumpkin. Spice here is far shyer."
It's just Sheriff Mills way of punishing him for undermining her authority. Apparently, he was not allowed to take Claire on a ride-along to get experience - even if it was during his own hours - because Claire has already been told, repeatedly, that she’s not cut out for being a cop.
"Hello Dean," Cas says, roughly.
Dean puts another finger in, stretching himself as he arches into Cas’s hand. “Fuck tighter - please,” he begs, strung out on Cas’s heady gaze. Cas listens to him, pumping Dean’s cock tight and slow.
"I can make that happen, Bela," Dean says, trying to soothe her this time. "I can be sure your fathers put away for a very long time."
Cas squints at him. The narrow-eyed one that only happens when Deans going to get yelled at. Dean swallows. "Because Dean, I felt forced out. You pushed me away and now you're trying to push your way back in!"
Dean steps closer to him, his mouth hanging open, Cas doesn't even pretend to look strained. If anything, he preens under Dean attention. Dean has never been this hard in his life. He licks his lips. "So, I guess you might be strong enough to go back on hunts, huh?"
Nodding in a sleepy agreement Cas reluctantly lets go of Deans waist and stumbles to the coffee pot. The Cats trailing behind him like ducklings. Dean shakes his head and plates up the food, making a dumb smiley face to see how Cas reacts. When he sees it Cas snorts a laugh over his mug. "It's nice seeing you so happy."
“Why you?”
Castiel laughs. “I promise I’ll radio in to tell you I made it and go home straight after.
"Dean Winchester so help me -" Castiel says before Dean leans over the couch and kisses him quiet. Castiel becomes far to distracted to continue the conversation.
as quickly as it came. The potential was there, Dean knows it was. He's not even surprised Sam could pick up on it. Dean had always
Cas sighs, taking a long sip from his coffee. "No, but I would like to learn with you."
"What the fuck Dean!" Charlie yells from the earpiece.
Dean scrunches up the note in his fist and wonders what the fuck he's meant to do now.
"I wanted to see you," Dean says, awkwardly defending himself.
"I kill God?" Sam asks, his eyebrows rising. "How?"
“C’mon, that was obviously a lie. Though I must admit you’re definitely the prettiest Deputy to arrest me.”
Dean raises his head and sees Castiel standing there, holding Jacks hand. He looks devastated. Dean's stomach turns as he looks away meeting Kelly’s gaze. “I hope this goes well for you. I hope you get to keep your kid, but I can't help you as long as you’re working with him. So that's it." He says then locks eyes with Castiel. "I'm done with all of this."
Cas frowns looking equally as confused. "No."
Cas's smile is like seeing the sun after the worst of storms. He nuzzles against Dean's palm, kissing
Dean jumps and fumbles for it, while the battery light flashes over Sam's face. "Dean!" Sam roars the minute Dean picks up. "I've been calling for days are you okay?"
He wants Cas for however long Chuck will let him live. He wants to see him get used to human skin. He wants to cook for him and see what food he actually likes. He wants to see if Cas will blush when Dean finally works up the nerve to kiss him. But if he ever wants to get anywhere near Cas, he has to make it up to him. He needs to fix the roof and keep his word. He needs to prove to Cas that he's worth it.
"Really?" Cas asks, smiling enough that his eyes crinkle. "That's brave of you."
Castiel smiles at the ceiling before writing his reply.
"C'mon, James. You’re the only one who can do this."
“Get too sweeping you.” Jody snaps.
Dean shrugs, leaning back into his chair. “Well, it's a good thing I don't want a reading.”
“Good, you can bring Cas,” Sarah says smugly.
"Hmmm, I suppose we could," Cas says with an odd look on his face. "Though it's quite a drive to New York."
"So I can't act like this; it goes against everything I've spent my life trying to become. I could get disbarred. What happened can't happen again, not when it could jeopardise everything else."
"Of course, I do," Naomi says, the beginning of a halo appearing around her head at Cas's questions.
“I know,” Sam says, smiling like a sap. Dean rolls his eyes. Their lunch together passes quickly after that, due to Sam rushing to get done in time for the bachelor party - until he eventually leaves Dean straight after they finish eating, to do some setting up at the beach. Dean wanders back to the hotel, appreciating the town more now that the rain has stopped and the clouds have started to part thanks to whatever spell Sam’s friend pulled. It's still cold though, so he doesn't drag his feet - and once inside, he appreciates the real fire more than he probably should.
Dean bites his lip, “Can an angel make deals?”
Dean may not love his job as an interrogator but he's good at it. More than once his bosses have called him a chameleon, he can play it all. The dumb American, the sadistic torturer, the good cop, the bad cop and most importantly the Alpha Male Stereotype. For some reason, every Russian guy that they bring into this place treats life like it’s a dick measuring contest. They've got the stone-cold vibe down, glares like steel and either pretend they can't speak English or don't speak at all. The second they enter Dean’s room the contest starts, and Dean is forced to prove time and time again that he's the one with the power here.
“Cherry is a cute name,” Dean mumbled.
“I’ll just leave it at this; Dad liked to drink.
“The gist of it is,” Cas shot Dean a quick glare before looking back at his son, “A young nephilim appeared, here.”
well maybe
“Wait, Cas,” Sam took a deep breath and held his palm out towards the angel, his brow furrowed deeply, “Are you saying she’s a—“
“Daddy,” she grunted, pushing gently against Dean as his strength began making it hard to breathe. “Dad, I promise I’ll tell you both what happened. But I have to do one last thing first.”
“Castiel—“
Sam once again stayed with the girl while Dean and Cas moved out to the hallway. Cas began walking towards the stairs and Dean grabbed the back of his arm, stopping him from moving forward.
“Dean, I—“
“I’m, uh,” he paused, reaching out to ruffle the top of her hair, “I’m gonna miss you. I know my memories are gonna be gone and whatnot, but still.”
“Shh, it’s okay Jojo,” Dean repeated, either not noticing or not caring how close he was to Cas. Joey was essentially sandwiched between them now, and the back of Cas’ hand was pressed against Dean’s chest.
“Okay, so I have to get
“What? Why?” Cas crossed his arms and narrowed his eyes, “They’re funny.”
“Yup, you look fine,” Dean cleared his throat and nodded again, then pushed on the space between her shoulders to guide her out of the dressing room. Cas stopped and turned around, leaning up on her tip toes and puckering her lips. Dean avoided her mouth, instead leaning to the side and placing a chaste kiss on her cheek.
“You know why I can’t say it,” Dean hissed through his teeth, “We’ve talked about it—“
“It’s okay, I’ll just put you all back to whatever you were doing,” Jack sighed, nodding for the three of them to place their hands on his arm. Once they did, it was only a brief moment before Jack’s eyes lit up and he took a deep breath. Joey saw Dean peek one eye open and shoot her one last smile before the three men disappeared in front of her. Jack remained in his spot, and she waited until his eyes returned to normal before she stepped forward.
“What was your nickname for—oh, of course, Sammy,” Jack shook his head with a smile.
“Oh yeah?” Dean raised an eyebrow, “And it goes with the middle name we picked?”
“What?” Cas whispered, his pupils blown and his breathing irregular and heavy.
“Cas,” Dean pulled his lips between his teeth, biting down on them to try and keep his composure.
“It’s okay,” Cas smiled up at him, reaching up to place a hand on his jaw, “I understand.”
“Dean!”
“There she is,” Dean smiled, poking her nose once before dropping his hands and shaking his head with a loud clearing of his throat. The hunter backed away and nodded to Cas, “You can probably put her down now.”
Castiel couldn’t stop seeing the way Dean had looked and spoke when he mentioned the tapes. It was so vulnerable, so much more than rare for Dean. It certainly piqued the angel’s interest. Gazing at the tapes, Castiel picked up the one which wasn’t labeled and examined it. Curiously, he put it into the radio and pressed play.
Cas went along anyway though. He’d just come back, and Dean wasn’t ready to have the angel out of his sight for longer than necessary. They were actually on their way back to the bunker, groceries filling the Impala’s back seat.
Dean didn’t think kale should ever call itself food; he had no clue how Sammy
Dean’s mood seemed to go down from there, but he still tried to be supportive and happy for Cas. Sam, on the other hand, was entirely amazed. He asked a lot of questions which Cas refused to answer. The angel wanted Heaven to be a surprise for them whenever it was that they got there.
"Got to love a writer when it comes to theatrics." Dean sighs, rubbing the back of his neck. "Anyway, our talk this morning got me thinking. Chuck wanted Jack dead and when I wouldn't do it, he did it himself. He wanted Jack gone for a reason, man. I think he saw Jack as a threat."
“I don’t belong with the angels anymore. They’ll always be my brothers and sisters, but I belong with you,” Cas explained. Even
Dean felt like he could hardly breathe, but in the good way. Finally there would be someone who truly knew him, someone to talk to, someone who would be there every step of the way. He was so much more than grateful; his heart was practically beating out of his chest.
Dean looked over at Castiel, his eyes were unfocused, he was lost. He huffed out a laugh, "Yeah, I'm not sure I do either."
“What’s up, Cas?” the hunter responded casually, clearly having no clue as to what this conversation would be about.
"Sorry I'm not sure I understand..."
Sam. I’ve always meant that.”
A shaggy yet adorable dog trotted into the room. It wagged its tail and jumped up on Dean’s legs. Dean chuckled, reaching down and scratching Miracle’s head. Castiel though his heart was going to melt at the sight.
"Hm, always knew that kid would do good." He and Cas chuckled.
It turned out that Sam was almost right; had Dean been anyone else, he would’ve been completely correct. The thing Dean had been so excited to show Cas was his bedroom, which was oddly clean. The angel did care; he was proud of Dean, and happy that the hunter was finally proud of himself without any hidden loathing or guilt.
“I… I didn’t think you’d come back this time, but I still hoped you would.” Dean was trying hard to keep his voice steady. The feelings he had after Cas left: anger, guilt, depression, heartbreak; they all rushed back to him.
“No. In Hell you have a sense of where you are. In The Empty you’re nowhere and somewhere at the same time. It makes you feel insane. You’re supposed to be asleep, you can’t think about it then, but I was always awake.I knew someone needed me. I..” Castiel and Dean made eye contact. “I could hear you, Dean.”
‘You’ve already been gone for months!’ The sad tone quickly turned angry. Dean was frustrated with himself; he never understood why these types of things took him so long, and he hated it. But Castiel knew why it took him extra time, he always had, and he understood.
“Mornin’ Cas,” Dean replied tiredly. His eyes were barely open; he got more than his usual four hours, but he still hadn’t slept most of the night.
“Thank you, Sam. I planned on being here as long as I can. I don’t want to lose this again.” Castiel had spent his time between Heaven and Earth for too long. He couldn’t lose his family again, so he’d stay with them until he couldn’t anymore.
Dean looked amused, finding the situation so odd it was almost funny. Then he remembered that he spoke dog once too, and cringed at the thought.
Cas nodded. “I never understood your words, like you were too far away, but I knew it was you. The tone, the- the presence in my mind. It
“Dean, I’m not sure I understand. I already know what’s in here.”
Dean chuckled, clapping Castiel’s shoulder. “Come on man! You’re not gonna get out of work that…” he trailed off as he too looked into the fridge. He gagged as his eyes fixed on the kale. “God I think I’m gonna be sick.”
A loud
A petite nurse stepped into the waiting room. She squinted, pushing her glasses up and looking down at the paper in her hands. "Mister... Ojeda?"
"You know he will be alright, don't you? It was just a few ribs, possibly. You and him have both dealt with much w-"
‘Hey Cas!’ it was Dean’s voice. The recording of him sighed, ‘God this is so stupid,’ he mumbled as though the recording wouldn’t pick him up. ‘Look, I wasn’t sure how to say this. A-and at the time it all happened so quick. You were saying words that I’ve needed… wanted to hear for years, and then you were gone.’ He laughed brokenly.
"Who brought you back?" Dean would have asked how, but he knew better than that. There was always a who.
On the second day, Dean couldn't take much more of the awkwardness. Cas couldn't take it either, but he believed it was what Dean wanted, so he kept quiet. Curiosity and a bazillion other emotions had been biting at the hunter's heels ever since he saw Cas again.
Well, in all honesty, it wasn't truly packed away then either. Maybe it was after they killed Chuck? That's when Dean, full of naïve hope, thought he could stop thinking about everything. He thought, he hoped, it would all be better. It was all the same, but at least he knew no deity was constantly pulling his strings and writing his lines.
Sam smiled. “‘Night Cas.”
Dean shook his head in disbelief. The hunter knew how important Castiel’s wings were to him, to his self image; he’d seen what could happen if Cas lost them. How could he just ‘give them up’?
“It’s just nice to reflect, Dean, to appreciate what I have,” Castiel said as though he knew what Dean was thinking. The hunter was at a loss for words; he attempted to see the forest the same way Cas did. “The Empty, it was… I would much prefer going through Purgatory again to being there.”
"Dean."
The angel smiled. "Of course, Dean."
the stuff. He attempted to send Sam on a punishment shopping trip only to remember his brother really wasn’t supposed to be moving around so much. So that left him to do the shopping. Of course, Cas could’ve gone too, but Dean hardly trusted him to buy anything good.
Dean left the emergency room, Cas trailing behind him. They stayed in a motel for those few days, and the first few hours of the first day was extremely awkward. As far as Dean knew, Cas didn't need to sleep, but he still got a room with two beds anyway. The emotional distance between them became physical as well.
Castiel's head tilted to the side in both confusion and concern. It was a look that was extremely familiar. Dean had to turn away.
Castiel was there by Sam's side. His fingers glowed with a light that brought warmth and healing to any injury. Dean felt like he couldn't breath.
"In some ways, I do." He said vaguely. He didn't want to die exactly, but he was ready for something new. He was ready to take whatever years of rebelling and fighting for love had truly earned him, even if it was death. He was ready to let go, ready to finally accept his truth, and he would do it all over for Dean.
The boys opened the door. Dean and Cas moved forward; they attempted to fit Sam into the back seat. It felt like it took forever, but eventually Sam was laying across the back seat; seat belts were pulled over him where they could be.
"The Empty is asleep now. Forever."
Castiel wasn’t surprised to find that it was Dean making coffee. In a way, caffeine was one of his many vices.
Dean was confused. Of course he could see the resemblance to Purgatory, it was a forest after all, but he didn’t exactly understand how that made Cas feel calm here. Unlike the angel, he was never one for small details.
Castiel also wasn’t sure if he dared to go into the kitchen. He understood the recording, but was still unsure of what to do with its information. Nevertheless, he pushed himself past these feelings and towards the kitchen. He had intended to start fresh, be around more often, and that certainly meant no hiding.
I’ll lose who I am. I don’t want to be who I was before I knew you. You anchor me- I need you here, not in Heaven looking down at me. I love you, Castiel. I love every moment with you. Please, don’t go back to Heaven.”
“And you thought you could never say this to my face,” Cas commented with a small chuckle that Dean echoed. “I’ve loved you since I first saw your soul. I’m not going anywhere, I promise. Besides-” There was a crack of thunder, cool rain began to pour from the sky. Dean blinked and almost missed seeing Castiel’s wings. The angel held his hand out, letting raindrops collect in his palm. He grinned. “This is temporary.”
The tape made a clicking noise; the recording was over. Castiel’s eyebrows were furrowed in thought. He listened to the tape again and again until he could smell coffee brewing in the morning. Though Cas was certain that coffee smelled different to him than to humans, he still liked the richness of it. He wasn’t sure how many times he had listened to Dean’s words.
Castiel followed Sam to his room; he was worried the tall man would fall or suddenly forget how to use his crutches. When they got to the room, Sam stopped and leaned his weight onto the door.
“But you don’t know all of it,” Dean took a deep breath, “Cas, you’ve got me whenever you need me. I don’t care if it’s important or not because if you want it then it’s important to me. You bring out the best in me, man. You wake me up, make me reconnect with my humanity. Nobody’s ever done that for me before. That’s why I need you Cas. When you’re gone I’m so
Cas stared at Dean, reading him like a book. “My apologies,” he said as he turned towards the window instead, “You’re not ready to talk about this yet.”
Both men were in tears. Castiel finally had his happiness, and Dean finally said ten years of locked-up feelings.
"Dean, I meant every word. I would never lie to you, not like that. I've seen your soul, rebuilt the good and bad parts of it, and I still love you."
The hunter swallowed the words he wanted to say. He figured the reunion would have to wait; Sam's impact had been worse than Dean thought. "Yeah, that's um, that's great Cas. Good thinking."
“But the only things I can make are-”
Dean approached the noise quickly, and his heart felt as though it had stopped just as quickly. Sam was propped up against the barn wall, a few broken crates around him. Sam's eyes were open, and he was grinning as though nothing had happened.
“Hey,” Dean turned and shot his brother a look.
“Miss us that much already, huh?” Dean chuckled.
Sam noticed the odd behavior and sighed before shaking his head quickly, “Hey, that’s not what I meant.”
Once Sam had closed the door, Dean turned and looked at Cas with a nervous smile before he realized Joey was giggling beneath them, her hands covering her mouth.
“Probably because of the murders,” Sam mused as Dean parked the impala.
“Jack?” Cas asked cautiously.
It was only a few days after the biggest fight of their lives that Sam decided to FaceTime Eileen. He originally planned to wait longer, to try and give her some time and space, but he found he couldn’t stop himself when his phone was in his hand and his thumb was resting over her contact information. They were able to have a constructive conversation, and Sam even flirted a bit which Dean gave him a solid thumbs up for from the other side of the room. Eileen said she would be coming to visit the bunker in a month or so, once the boys had a little time to recuperate.
Sam snorted and turned his head with a smile, an eyebrow cocked. “Yeah, I’m aware.”
“It probably knows that it’s gonna have hell to pay for using a kid as a vessel,” Dean crossed his arms and tightened his jaw.
“But—“
“What is he doing?” Cas asked, sighing as he and Dean stood at the top of the stairs looking down at where Sam was practically jumping down them.
“Sammy, what are you, we have to,” Dean found himself unable to complete a sentence as he still kept shaking Cas, trying to get her to wake up or take a goddamn breath.
“Let’s go find Sammy.”
“Dude, she’s already seen this place at its worst,” Dean chuckled.
He drew a deep breath, then ran a hand down his face, “No, it’s not that. I just…I know it’s you in there, but I don’t…”
why she didn’t want to go back. Jack had told them it was because of he and Cas arguing, and Dean didn’t like that their future selves were capable of making this little girl feel unwanted enough to not want to return to her home time.
“Let’s split up,” Sam held up a hand when Dean opened his mouth to undoubtedly say something sarcastic and rude.
“I’m telling you, Sam, I don’t think it’s—“
“Oh,” Jack nodded quickly, “That explains the weird sensation I’ve been getting.”
,” Dean suddenly shouted from inside the room.
in here.”
Dean and Cas both whipped their heads to look at Jack, then together glanced down at Joey. Dean drew a deep breath and took a small step towards her, his hand reaching out and rubbing along the top of her hair.
“But wait, you said she’s only eight months old,” Dean shook his head roughly, trying desperately to grasp onto the concept, “She’s a kid, not a baby.”
“I don’t know how well it would work,” Cas let out a long breath, “Since she has my grace, she may be able to block me out.”
“I don’t know,” Dean reached up and rubbed the back of his neck before gesturing towards Cas and Joey with his head, “Why am I acting like that? I don’t comfort people.”
Cas chuckled softly before her face scrunched up in pain again, and she nodded quickly, looking back at Dean.
Jack’s shoulder.
“Yes Dean?” she whispered, her other hand reaching to the back of his neck to play with the short hair there.
“Dean,” Cas groaned, turning to give the hunter a look that said ‘let it go’.
“In the dungeon,” Dean jerked his head to the closed doorway about ten feet down the hall from them.
“You hungry, kiddo?” Sam asked with a laugh. Joey nodded, her hand going to her stomach.
“Dean,” Sam whispered, interrupted when the baby in his arms began to cry loudly. He bounced his arms slightly and shushed her quietly, trying to get her to calm back down.
“So listen, Joey,” Cas wrapped an arm around her shoulders and leaned his forehead against the top of her head, “I know that you’re worried about returning home. I understand it. But you know you have to, right?”
The last thing Dean heard when he passed out was Sam yelling. He couldn’t quite make out what he was shouting, but there was one thing that he was able to pick out.
“Okay, I guess I’ll record some sort of ending. Um, jeez…I don’t know, endings are hard. It’s been a long road, that’s for damn sure. I wish I could just give some cool phrase here, to make everyone think I’m this young, hip guy, but we all know that’s a lie.
Cas sighed in understanding, his eyes falling as he tilted his head to the side, “Are you sure about this, Dean? This is not a simple decision.”
Dean took a step forward, his chest heaving. Cas knew exactly how to push his buttons, exactly what to say to get his blood boiling.
"I thought we were real," Castiel says, his voice shaking. "I thought you wanted me and what we had together. But then you were just gone."
"Because we created it," Castiel says reverently. Dean breath catches in his throat. "The garden was one of our first projects and we watch over it still, or I do at least."
“Why does he listen to you,” Dean says, distracted by the devil dog actually doing what he's told.
Nick raises his wings aggressively, grabbing her shoulder. "Hey!" Dean yells, "You don't get to touch her."
“What the hell is that supposed to mean? Do you think this God crap isn't bothering me or something?”
"Actually, that will be your job," Castiel says, smirking as Dean stands up. His tail lazily swaying back and forth as he shrugs, "Part of it anyway."
A week after he left the warmth of Castiel’s bed behind. Deans is sulking at home, doing the paperwork for Bela to get approved to live at Jody's house. Because Hannah had sent him home from the office, with a stern "Get some sleep, Dean." Dean obviously doesn't sleep; he works and argues with himself about the benefits of flying to Castiel’s place. Just to stop by, say hi and see Castiel’s face again. Hell, he even misses the dog. He's got to be pretty desperate to get to that point. There's a knock at the door, bringing Dean out of his fantasy of flying into Castiel’s open arms and back to reality.
"I've got grace," Dean says into the pillow. Castiel groans, squeezing one of Deans glands again, his fist squelching with oil. Dean sees stars when Castiel starts to push inside. His cock, impossibly huge before he relaxes around it. Castiel doesn't try to build a rhythm at first, he’s graceless and greedy when he thrusts into Dean. Dean moans are a perfect echo of Castiel’s own. "Oh, shit," Dean pants, angling his hips so Castiel is tagging his prostate, "Just like that baby, holy fuck."
"He's more than just his powers Nick! “Kelly bites back, terrifying in her rage.
“Then let me do this,” Claire begs. She almost sounds like she's about to cry, which blows the wind out Dean's wings more than anything else does. Scrubbing her face Claire looks down at her gloved fists. “I want to be normal Dean. I need you to have my back on this."
"I got a message from my boss this morning," Cas says scratching the back of his head and ruffling his hair. Cas's hair has always been a bit fucked up but it's still weird to see Cas with a genuine bedhead. Dean's fingers itch to fix it. He drinks more coffee instead. "One of the drivers is sick, and she needs me to cover. So I won't be able to help you today."
"I'll be fine Cas." Dean says jumping to his feet. "I'll get right on that as soon as I get a shower and -" Looking down, Dean realizes he's still dressed in just his shirt and boxers. Cas's eyes are locked somewhere below Dean's waist. "- get pants." He finishes lamely. Face hot.
He shakes his head, "Might as well make myself useful. Take a load of Stud." Castiel pushes Dean’s shoulders so he falls back onto the couch. Rasing an eyebrow when Dean's green eyes turn darker than jade. He forces himself to turn around and not sit in his lap.Fuck Dean is beautiful and so, so dangerous.
Leaving the comfort of the office Dean realizes Crowley has no such qualms. His place is everything Dean hates about Los Angeles. With its modern art; spiral staircases and chrome everywhere. Sometimes Crowley baffles him more than anything else. They are so different Dean has no clue how they’ve made their business work but it has. Making his way downstairs Dean tries to keep his smile in place. Nodding at some familiar faces and trying to hide from his business partner. He doesn’t need Crowley busting his balls for leaving right now.
“Yes, Dean?” Castiel asks looking down to move his hand down Dean's mud-clad leg. He really needs to stop finding Dean’s reactions so intriguing.
“Really, James? You used to be the kind of guy that went to protests to protect bees for God's sake. Now your just gonna let the world burn?”
"How can you expect me to help you after this morning. You already told me your little trick won't get me on the stand. It's my choice and I'm saying no Castiel."
Claire rolls her eyes, pointing at Dean with her fork. “You checked angelic cures. Not demonic ones.”
“Shit,” Dean says, digging steadily. “Poor kid, still no wonder she wants to get out there.”
"What happened to your whole integrity stick?" Dean asks bitterly. Shoving on his belt with shaking hands. He's using his anger to distract himself from sitting in this death-trap. Even if this conversation turns his stomach almost as much as the car itself.
Dean glares at him. He can still feel the burn of the compulsion spell on his wrist. "Those methods are illegal." Those were Castiel's exact words and on paper, he hasn't broken the law. No, Castiel didn't compel Dean to do anything. Not when he knew with all of Deans issues that a threat would be enough to make him crumble. It's a smart tactic. Manipulative. What Deans expected from demonkind.
His eyes sparkle, "Dean -" Castiel says, kissing Deans cheek. "Shut up and take your reward."
"Yeah well, Sam and I are pretty fun to be around when there isn't an apocalypse."
Cas freezes, lifting his head to stare out the window. From outside the porch, stairs creak and Sam's voice comes through the door. "Dean are you in there because we've got a problem."
At least that's what Dean believes until he hears the now foreign flap of wings.
“I’ve seen what happens when work deals go bad pal. You wouldn't be the first demon to build in mechanisms to ensure they are being obeyed. Compulsion spells are basically a dime a dozen in deals like this.”
He spends far too long glaring at the empty space, unsure why he expected any different. Dean's life hasn't changed the way Castiel's has. Castiel's first ghost had been just one in a long line of hunts for Dean. And as for Castiel's part in it, he’s simply a one night stand. Maybe even a good memory from a shitty night. And it's not like Castiel can blame him. He's had his fair share of one night stands in the past after finishing a case. He knows what flirting and adrenaline do. He's not even upset about it, because he wanted Dean just as badly as Dean had wanted him. He's just got to get it into his head now that want is all their night together had been about.
“Yeah, Dean I know and believe me I get it. I’d be terrified of deals too, but you can’t keep holding it against an entire race.” Charlie says reasonably.
"Dean, what the fuck is in that letter?" Charlie asks slowly like Dean’s lost his mind. Maybe he has. All these years he's been aching for Cas to want him and now he has proof that he does. It feels like a dam broke inside him and all his emotions are pouring out. Eventually, he manages to get it together and gets into his car. He forces himself to take a deep breath before he answers her.
Deans so terrified he's going to lose him. It sends him scrambling, pushing into Cas's hand so he can kiss him desperately. Cas clutches him tightly. His hand right over the brand he left on Deans soul, long before Amara ever tried to lay claim to him. It helps Dean gentle the kiss. To accept the reassurance that Cas is radiating, making Dean feel less like a kite with a cut string. "Yes." He says before he can think better of it. He doesn't know what Amara will make him do, but he needs Cas to know Dean is his. That he'll always be his.
“I get it,” Dean says because if there is one thing, he does understand it's awesome kids. What he can't wrap his mind around is how beautiful Castiel looks when he smiles. Dean thought his hatred would have blocked out his attraction for Castiel. But God, that smile is something else.
“You really think I’m gonna let you go out there and kill that thing on your own?”
“Are they that bad?”
Deans stomach churns, "Let's just get this over with," Dean says, walking out of the car. Castiel nods, looking sad and desperate and like everything is out of his control.
Scowling Dean starts the walk down Castiel’s admittedly nice street. It’s not that far from Gabe and Rowena's place now that thinks about it. Too bad Sam’s probably in work already, it would be nice to see him. Cerberus doesn't give Dean enough time to contemplate visiting anyway. Tugging Dean in the opposite direction and yipping through his muzzle.
"What?" Claire and Kaia both as in shocked unison.
Boots pounding on the tiles as he slams into the hallway outside. Immediately, the temperature rises. Breathing heavily, he falls against the wall.
Deans heart jumps at the easy affection between Cas and these kids. He knows from that first night and from his texts that Cas doesn't talk to his birth family. But he also knows that when Mildred adopted Cas, the current sheriff, as Mildred’s neighbour, also took a shine to him. Aggressively mother henning him through his late teens when Cas came over to babysit. These must be her kids.
“I feel like I’m getting mocked for being an American more than being a Squib at this point.”
“Okay, I’ll do that thanks, Sammy,” Dean says hanging up. He can't risk Sam talking him out of doing something stupid. When the bus pulls up, Dean ends up waving it off and starts walking to Castiel’s address. He's got work to do.
“I can give you a ride home,” Castiel says, eagerly. His tail springing up into the air.
Castiel's grip tightens on his thighs and Dean groans as their cocks bump together. Their chests are pressed tight, Castiel shirt scraping against Dean's skin. He wants this moment to last forever.
“That's not saying I’m against it,” Dean says suddenly, face pink. “I’m just new to it, is all.”
The second Claire leaves the diner, Dean walks outside and calls Sam. He didn't lie to Claire when he said he was supporting her decision. He just does trust it. Claire deserves her own free will, and God knows she’d be better off without her abilities.
It's probably the stupidest thing he's ever done. But Dean doesn't stop kissing Castiel even as they stumble into his house. Even drunk Dean knows this is a bad idea but he doesn't want to stop. Castiel tastes too good. The second the doors closed Castiel’s mouth is hot on Dean's neck. The slight points of his teeth scraping over Dean's skin.
“Mr Winchester, this may come as a surprise to you, but I have been known to be helpful on occasion.” Castiel says his tail swishing aggressively, “I am also friend's with Claire's mother. I've have been thinking about how to cure Claire's ailment since Jody approached me six years ago.”
Until the sexy bastard in him comes out and he talks Dean off over the phone, panting in Dean's ear as he fucks his fist, or that one memorable night when Cas fucked himself with his fingers just so Dean could hear. It's during nights like that, after they've cleaned themselves off and are shooting the shit again, that Dean realises he's got one hell of a crush on this fucking Deputy from South Dakota, with his give them hell-attitude and permanent bedhead.
“I sold the Prius after I decided I needed to cut out my grace," Cas says, smiling smugly while taking a bite of his lunch. "Then I stole a new truck on the way to the cabin."
“When did he get the time to do that?”
"Why would Billie not be here? What did Chuck do to her?"
Halloween has always been a bad time for Sam. Their lives were horror stories even before Jess died. But following her death, Sam was so busy blaming himself that he didn't even pretend to like Halloween anymore. Dean had ended up watching him, making sure he didn't drink himself to death instead of celebrating his favourite holiday. Now, with Sam gone again, Dean doesn’t know what to do with himself, all alone. At least this year they're talking.
The butterflies in Dean's stomach only get worse when Castiel is sitting beside Dean. One hand absently stroking his horn as he scans The Commandments again. His shirtsleeves rolled up to his elbows and a dark blue tie loosely hanging around his neck. Dean attempts not to look at him directly. Trying to pretend he doesn't ache to feel Castiel 's lips on his skin.
"Dean," Cas says softly, grabbing Dean's hand. "You're not my burden, you're my friend."
Dean swallows, Castiels eyes are so blue... And now is not the time to be thinking things like that. It's been years since he admitted this to anyone. But Dean needs Castiel to understand why today crossed the line. He needs Castiel to know that while he is sympathetic he can't go through with this deal anymore. “My dad sold his soul in a crossroads deal.”
Castiel blinks, both the redness and the pain disappearing in an instant. For a second its Castiel looks apologetic. He almost seems surprised by his own actions but then the look is gone. Replaced by Castiels stone-faced expression.
"How come she likes him?" He asks, forcing himself to think past Amara and try to lighten the mood.
Dean licks his lips, "Yeah, why not? Are you turning me down?"
Dean shoves a sausage in his mouth to avoid the conversation. He never told Sam that he only made Sam so much shit because he wanted to keep his attention. Being a Squib meant he couldn't entertain Sam with Quidditch or spells, but he had his own two hands to work with. Making things has always been something Dean took pride in - but he can’t help but feel like he's less than Sam somehow. Logically, he knows that feeling comes from John, their Auror father who wasn't even around most of the time. Who's still in the wind, and missing Sam’s big day - yet always managed to make Dean feel inferior.
“Okay,” Castiel says taking the shovel as Dean climbs out, only passing him the gun when they're both on equal footing.
“C’mon the bedrooms close,” Castiel says after making out for an unknown amount of time against the staircase. His thigh riding up against Dean's dick.
Castiel raises his eyebrow at that one, noticing the black staining his teeth. He wonders how much it pays to be a hypocrite these days? He walks away as a group of tourists breaks through the tape. Taking pictures of the body and the cops like it’s a scene from CSI. God, this city is a fucking mess.
Dean hadn't argued with Cas about help. But he is biting his nails as Cas climbs up the ladder. He's still terrified that Cas is going to die now that he's human. Not that being, an angel, saved him last time. Dean wonders if they should ever talk about how badly that fucked him up. Even though he knows he probably never will.
“Where’s Joey?” Sam asked loudly, walking towards them.
The first thing Dean saw when he awoke was Cas.
. He’s good because of us. Do you honestly think we can’t do the same thing with her?”
They knew from the experience with Kelly that nephilim grew much quicker than a completely human baby, but even so it was alarming to Dean how much Cas had changed. With help from Sam’s research, they knew that Cas would be expected to deliver the nephilim by mid May, which meant that Cas was already starting to show, just a small little bump at the bottom of her previously flat stomach.
...babe, can we go to that new burger joint on the way home?...Yes, I’m aware that we have food at home, but—please? Pretty please?...Ha
“I’m gonna stop you right there,” Dean held up his other hand, closing his eyes, “I don’t know what you think you saw in the kid’s head, but—“
“Fine,” Dean scoffed dramatically, shaking his head, “You wanna go on the vamp hunt with us, fine.”
being ridiculous, Dean,” Cas interjected, “You have no idea what would happen to the baby if we transformed me back right now.”
a week. Three months later, and the courts had already relinquished the parents’ rights. It wasn’t a good situation.
Jack’s mouth fell open, and he shook his head as Sam walked forward and placed a hand on his shoulder, chuckling softly.
“What? Cas and I are both clean, why the hell would I wear a—oh fuck.”
“Pretty sure she knows that, since she has half of your grace,” Dean interrupted from where he was standing next to Sam, his arms crossed. Cas turned to glare at the hunter before looking back at the girl.
“Where have you been?” Jack pulled away and walked over to the map table, setting her down on it and placing his hands on both sides of her hips, “Dads have been freaking out for hours!”
“Damn it,” Dean shouted, turning and slapping the wall.
Jack merely shrugged as he continued walking, “Never mind, let’s keep looking.”
“Well, maybe we would think it was a witch, or that—“ he stopped when he realized Cas was looking at him with a typical
Cas let out a long breath, her lips pressed together as she looked up at him. She reached out and ran her long fingers along his jaw line, trying to bring his gaze back to meet hers.
“Yeah, true,” Sam nodded, then turned to look at Jack, “Speaking of that, how the hell are we going to figure this out?”
“Me?” Cas turned and raised his eyebrows incredulously, “If anyone would end the relationship it would be Dean.”
Cas was sitting at one of the tables, facing away from him and leaning forward slightly. Dean could see the edges of his laptop peeking out, so he knew that Cas must be researching or looking for a case. He was wearing a gray hoodie and sweatpants identical to Dean’s. The slippers that Dean had bought him for Christmas were hanging off of his heels as he bounced the weight of his legs on the balls of his feet. Dean walked on the tips of his toes to Cas’ back, and held his hands out in front of him with his mouth open to yell.
“Shut up,” Cas interrupted, her brow furrowing and her eyes shutting roughly as her face winced. “Shit.”
“Seriously?” Dean scoffed as he moved inside and closed the door behind him, “You’re just going to ignore me now?”
I added some tags, please look at those before you continue reading. This chapter has some fluff, some angst, some gore, more fluff, a whole bunch of stuff. Just heed my warning.
“No,” Jack replied with a small smile, moving to a squat in front of her to get down to her eye level, “They’re going to quit hunting. That’s what they were arguing about.”
“I promise,” Cas nodded, and waited until Dean was under the covers before smiling brightly.
“I can,” she interrupted Cas, her eyes never leaving Dean’s. The hunter crossed his own arms to mirror her stance as he moved to stand directly in front of her, their staring contest intensified.
“I did just fine before you came along, you know,” Dean spat, instantly regretting it. Cas’ face fell in the same fashion it had when Dean had spoken those ill words almost two years ago, when Cas left the bunker and Dean didn’t stop him.
“Oh,” Jack replied, biting his bottom lip and looking down at the floor sheepishly, “It was another memory she showed me, apparently that’s my nickname for her.”
“Wait what?” Dean replied loudly, his hands falling to his sides.
“Wait, seriously?” Sam asked quietly.
“Dean,” Sam decided to soften his tone and sighed, “You could take him to Chuck E. Cheese and he would love it.”
Dean dropped his arms down to his side dramatically, and then walked over and looked down at Cas with a frustrated expression on his face.
“You ready?” he asked.
“Jack,” Sam huffed as he walked in, then looked at the bed and shook his head, “Yeah, I kind of figured this would happen. That’s why I told you to wait for me.”
The hunter’s eyes lit up. He whistled, “Miracle! C’mere boy!”
The rest of the car ride was filled with music and small conversation. It was bliss to both of them; an improvement. When Sam had come back it felt even better. The brothers bickered a bit, and Dean (badly) sang along to his cassettes. Even if Castiel was mostly quiet, everything felt right, like no time had been lost between the family at all.
Even though he had stopped himself short, Castiel smiled softly at Dean’s sudden openness. It felt amazing, like a new trust was between them. “No, Dean, I would wait the rest of eternity if I had to.”
“Thank you, Dean.”
“Dean,” the angel said as they drove toward the hospital. Sam had finally been declared well enough to finish recovery at the bunker, so they were on their way to pick him up.
“What?” He seemed more alert now, and also a bit annoyed. He groaned as he noticed the mistake he’d made. “Son of a bitch.”
There was a period of silence in the recording. Dean had likely been thinking about everything he had said, and Castiel was doing the same. He wondered if Dean really meant for him to hear this. He supposed there was nothing indicating he wasn’t meant to hear it. In fact, part of him felt that Dean had left it there on purpose.
“Cas, there’s something else too, that I want you to see.” There was no excitement in his voice. Dean was on edge, yet completely serious; Cas could tell, so he nodded without any questions.
Once again, Dean was leading the angel down the hall. They stopped in front of a room which Cas knew as his own; at least, it had been once. Castiel’s head tilted to the side in confusion.
Dean’s hands tightened around the steering wheel, his eyes intensely focused on the road. “Y-yeah I um-” he cleared his throat, “‘course, of course I remember.”
"Shit," Dean murmured. With seeing Cas again and worrying about Sammy's health, he had forgotten about the kids. Dean stopped supporting Sam so that he could approach the kids and talk to them more one-on-one. He figured that would be much more reassuring than him and a mysterious angel approaching the young boys. As Dean left his side, Castiel stopped to better support Sam's weight.
"Alright great," Dean smiled warily. He went back to help Cas carry Sam's weight. "Okay, first, all you gotta do is open the door. Gently, got it?"
It was almost possible to hear Sam roll his eyes as he sat down in front of the war room table, leaning his crutches against a chair. “Dean, he’s not going to care about your-!”
“I was asking you to come back. Asking for you to hear me and forgive me,” Dean’s voice was shaking, “telling you stupid things about my day to cope.”
"I thought you were gone," He said quietly. He didn't need to speak up, Castiel could hear him, even if he hadn't said it aloud at all.
Dean swallowed. “Cas, is The Empty,” he started cautiously, “
He didn't want to hear that. Not now. He remained silent.
“Dean, there is nothing you can do that I won’t be able to forgive you for. It was my choice to go. I never thought I could be happy; I didn’t have anyone like you and Sam did.”
Castiel had remembered the room as mostly empty. It had only contained a bed and a nightstand with a lamp on top; he didn’t have many possessions after all. Now, the room was so drastically different. It looked as though someone could actually live there.
Dean nodded. “You’re right. To be honest, I feel like a total ass making you wait up for me all the time. It’s just- I don’t know yet. How… how I feel about it all, I mean. You dying and coming back and the-” he briefly squeezed his eyes shut and sighed, “yeah.”
‘Some kind of sick joke, huh? Anyways I… I dunno if you’ll ever come back. But I want you to. God, I really do. I need you Cas. There’s so much shit I didn’t get to say. All kinds of things I was hoping we’d do now that Chuck is gone- fuck!’ He cursed himself, his voice audibly crackling with tears.
Upon opening the fridge, Cas noticed that its contents were more than just sad. The only things there were hot sauce, kale, and some beers. “Dean, there’s no bacon.”
“Shut up, Sammy!” Dean called, already dragging Cas down the hall with him.
"Why, Cas?"
Again they nodded, but this time with more confidence. They understood. Brothers were important.
“Since you think it’s funny, I’m gonna put you on bacon duty.”
‘What you said… I’ve been trying so hard to believe it. I might not hear you say anything else ever again, and I dunno if you can hear my prayers where you are. I don’t know what I’ll do if that happens… I love you, Cas.’
“Do you remember when- when The Empty came for me?” Castiel worded the question as delicately as he could.
taken to eating dog treats.
“It was a gift… I wanted to make sure you still had it,” Dean said so softly that Castiel wasn’t sure he would’ve heard it had he not been a celestial being. The angel turned and quickly embraced Dean. The hunter flinched, but returned the hug.
Dean was about to make a witty remark, but stopped to cover his eyes from a sudden blinding light. There was screaming, and then, silence. Dean blinked furiously, trying to see what had happened. All of the vampires were dead on the floor, not dead in a decapitation way, but dead in an angelic intervention way.
The young brothers nodded slowly, their anxiety calmed only somewhat.
There were no further questions after that; not questions that Dean dared to really ask. The only questions that were left were the questions the hunter had for himself. He never did really know himself. The real Dean was always tucked away, hidden, somewhere within the fake Dean.
“I would like to stop at a park. If you don’t mind.” Castiel had said this out of what was seemingly nowhere.
Dean had never reciprocated his feelings, he’d planned on doing the same thing. His place was on Earth, in a secret bunker in Kansas.
The rain continued to pour from the sky. For once, Dean didn’t care about the rain water seeping through his boots and soaking his socks. He was finally living in the moment, and the moment was liberating.
Miracle stretched his neck, taking in the angel’s scent as though it would tell him everything he needed to know about Castiel. Miracle barked.
Castiel hadn't said that before, at least, not directly. The words felt right as they left his lips. They were the easiest way of saying what he had meant all along.
"Cas-" Dean managed to say, but Castiel seemingly already knew what Dean wanted. The angel lifted Sam's legs so that he could sit in the back as well before letting them rest across his lap. A silent thank you was exchanged between the angel and the conscious hunter.
He wasn't supposed to be here, and damn, Dean was more than glad he was back, but part of him wished Cas had also stayed away. There was so much to think about now, so much that he thought he had packed neatly away after the night that Castiel was taken by The Empty.
Later that same week, Dean was sitting on his bed with his laptop resting on his thighs when he noticed Cas walking very slowly past his doorway in the hall.
“They had
“Sissy!”
“You are, apparently, my kid,” Dean sighed, closing his eyes for a brief moment before reopening them, “Which means you need to do what I say.”
Dean felt a shudder travel down his body and land right below his waist, his cock filling rapidly with every word Cas spoke. He was almost always the bottom in their relationship, with a few random surprises over the span of the last year where Cas had wanted to experiment.
“I’m not,” Cas paused, moaning as Dean slowly moved one hand to a nipple and gave a gentle squeeze, “I, um, I don’t really know what to do in this body.”
about us getting hurt.”
“No no,” Sam spoke quickly, holding his hands out as he pushed past Cas to rush towards her, giving Dean a quick glare, “It’s okay.”
“So what would you have us do,” Cas tilted his head to the side, “Keep her here and disrupt the very delicate fabric of time and possibly cause yet
Sam nodded before slowly opening his car door, “I’ll go get us a room.”
“You’re just not as sneaky as you think you are,” Cas replied, shrugging as he kept his eyes on his laptop.
“Well? What was it?”
“Oh my—Sam, get
They only finally pulled away when Dean felt Cas’ face contort in apparent confusion. He gave one last peck and leaned back, furrowing his own brow when he saw Cas looking around the room.
“Do you need help?” Sam called out, earning him a hard glare from his brother. Sam held his hands up defensively, “Hey, I don’t mean from me.”
, like four months old. Six kids under eight, and Cas thinks we can handle this?! I told him he was crazy, I told him there was no way we could do it, but damn my husband. He shows me this picture on his phone, one that my mom had taken a few weeks prior, and it’s all of us.
The second Cas laid eyes on the child, his angel blade clattered to the ground and he stumbled back a few steps, his hand moving to his head.
a favor.”
“As I said earlier, my Dad was not a great person. Growing up, we heard so many jokes at the expense of the LGBTQ community that I quickly realized I would never be able to come out to my old man.
“Oh,” he whispered and bit the inside of his cheeks nervously as he quickly glanced at the floor.
“I guess so,” Dean nodded, licking his bottom lip before opening his car door and sliding out.
“Okay, good,” Dean nodded, clapping his hands together as he looked over at Jack, “What do we need to do?”
“I learned it from Sam,” Cas straightened his spine proudly, “I’ve been working on my human mannerisms.”
“That’s not all,” Cas sighed, “She somehow has been created using my grace.”
Cas tilted his head to the side and narrowed his eyes, “Why wouldn’t it be?”
“Do it,” Dean suddenly yelled, nodding as Jack took a deep breath and spoke a few words in enochian before adding one last tiny vial of powder to the bowl. A large puff of blue smoke surrounded them, making them all cough and Sam use the blanket to cover the baby’s face. As it cleared, Dean was the first to snap his head back up and look at the bed. He let out a sharp breath when he looked at the flat planes of their chest and the short cropped hair.
“Well where is it?” Dean looked around, moving to crawl on his hands and knees as he searched the room.
Dean had his eyes closed and his fingers pinching the bridge of his nose, trying to keep his breathing pattern calm.
“Okay Dad,” she whispered, nodding quickly.
“My dick.”
“I didn’t,” Jack shook his head with a small smile, “I was actually just coming down to visit when I heard you talking about praying for me.”
Cas seemed to immediately sense his discomfort and walked over, her eyes narrowed and her head tilted to the side.
“Okay but,” Sam scoffed, shrugging his shoulders as he crossed his arms, “It’s Cas.”
“Let’s go,” Jack whispered, slowly moving to the doorway and pulling Joey along behind him. She reached up her other hand and began pressing against her lips, biting the inside of her cheeks nervously.
He looked in the mirror for what felt like the tenth time in the last half hour, biting the insides of his cheeks as his eyes glanced up and down his body. He was wearing his favorite gray button up, with a plain black t-shirt underneath. His jeans hugged his legs just tight enough, and he had just pulled on a pair of black boots. He reached up and carefully brushed his fingers through the front of his hair, making sure there weren’t any random pieces sticking out.
Sam had been searching every day for a reversal spell for Cas, calling every witch they had ever been in contact with. He even tried summoning Rowena once, but was instead met with a demon who was basically the hell version of ‘leave a message after the beep’.
“Baby daddy?” Dean’s brow furrowed, “Okay first off, where the hell did you learn that term? Secondly, is that seriously what you think of me?”
Dean immediately got out his own side and ran towards her, “Where the hell do you think you’re going?”
“Now Joey,” Jack looked at her upside down with a stern look, “I need you to be as relaxed as you can. Is there anything we can do to help you?”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “No. I’m coming with you.”
"I'm not that asshole, am I?" Dean asks Cerberus whose sitting looking just as confused as Dean by the outburst. The dog whines at him, his big red eyes staring into Deans soul. Goddammit, Dean might just be that asshole.
because the guy always showers with the window open. The songs are almost always love songs. Always filled with sweet sentiments and sung by a man that sings like sex personified. It’s the best part of Castiel’s day but it’s also the worst.
Castiel shrugs sipping the whiskey. “Were not. My brother Balthazar is a bit sleazy and Gadreel can be intimidating but they still live in Chicago.” Castiel pauses, seeming to think something over. “My mother though, she is truly terrifying.”
“So he put a swamp with a live alligator in his office?” Dean asks, trying to contain his laughter.
Cas shakes his head, smile disappearing, "Well considering the fact that you just did, I figure that answers your question." Cas says dryly. Dean's been reading people his whole life but Cas is more difficult than most. He doesn't know if he's happy Dean's here or pissed as hell. It’s sorta freaking Dean out. He hasn't felt this nervous about someone he's into since he asked Robin to Homecoming. Then suddenly Cas smiles, "That isn't to say I don't like it, though."
“Our cars aren't exactly inconspicuous.” Dean points out, which is totally fair but Castiel is already starting to hate his existence just standing soaking wet by the cars.
Dean laughs. “Fuck, if that’s what it takes to get your name I don't want to know what it would take to get your number.”
Cas laughs, dropping the quill back into the inkwell and shaking his head. “Smart,” he says.
“Hey, I’m from Kansas.”
"Dean, this isn't helping," Cas says, scrubbing his hand through his magnificent bedhead. Dean had stumbled out of bed after Cas had fallen asleep. Unable to get comfortable despite Cas's arms around him. Grunting Dean shrugs, making Cas roll his eyes. He hits Deans legs, "Push your feet up."
Gabriel shrugs, “I don't know Dean maybe Jacks different, but I was close to the edge once. If you want my advice I’d testify.”
“I lived with my aunt Mildred as a kid and she was really into cop shows so the interest was kinda there. But when I used to babysit the Sheriff's kids she would come back with all these stories.” Castiel shrugs, “I don't know it just seemed like a cool job when I was 18 and had no clue what to do with my life.”
“No,” Dean says still sitting up straight and not offering anything else.
“Okay, so you picked the billboard guy too mimic or whatever. That makes just as much sense as anything else. Okay so why are you naked? And why are you -" Dean gestures to Castiel’s crotch area.
Cas coughs up blood, “not quite,” he answers in that steely, unwavering voice like his double nose bleed is no big deal.
“That's good,” Dean says, already working out the distance between Newton and Sioux Falls, despite promising himself that he would take more time before going back there.
Claire smiles turns down right evil,
Cas looks up, his eyes burning blue. It’s the most inhuman he's looked in years. Dean takes a shot. Hitting the centre of the black mass just once as it writhes. Cas's stop glowing, the pages going out in a sudden gust of wind. With a horrible wail, the black goo recedes into the walls and Cas slumps over his spellbook.
For three days Cas goes to work, and Dean fixes the roof until it gets dark. On their first day of cohabitation, Cas returns with a handmade set off a hat and gloves. Apparently, it's one of the many gifts Cas receives for helping the little old ladies of Whitefish. He glares at Dean the next morning till he puts them on. So, Dean makes roof repairs in a red knit hat before making them dinner because he's determined to be helpful. Usually, Cas will thank him and tell Dean about his day, sometimes its stories about his clients lives. Other times he spends hours ranting about the American health system.
Cas swallows hard. "I'm looking forward to it,” he says, licking his lips, eyes locked on Dean's mouth. Cas shakes his head, finally giving Dean the grin he was searching for. “Now go and get some sleep, before I do something dumb."
It's blackberry, which was always Dean's favourite, but there's something else too. Copper and roses. The exact taste Dean gets in his mouth drinking Cas's blood. He swallows heavily, feeling warm for the first time in days. "Is there blood in this?" Dean asks, looking at his mug suspiciously.
“Jesus, there’s no need to go full Inigo Montoya just cause it tried to crush your windpipe.”
He sighs and goes over to the valets. "Hey guys, Mr Crowley said I could take one of his cars to get back to my hotel. Is there any way you can give me the keys?" He says with his most convincing smile.
"Sure you’re not, that's why you brought home those two jellybeans."
The kid turns to look at him, wide blue eyes open and accepting. If Dean didn't know any better, he would assume this was Castiel kid with eyes like that. "You’re an angel," He says, despite Deans concealment charms. "I'm an angel too."
Sam smiles, “Yeah Krissy, almost.”
Dean snorts, poking Cas's ribs with his elbow. "It's after ten dumbass," He says, plating up the food. "You just need coffee."
"Why?"
Dean shrugs. "Dad used to have to do odd jobs when we were kids. Sometimes he was a handyman or a mechanic. Think he's gotten us out of more than one overdue motel bill by fixing something that was fucked up. He eventually taught me and Sam bits and pieces. I mean it's not like we could call maintenance if the sink broke. They'd call social services the second they realised that it was just two kids living there."
“That's all I ask,” Claire says, before kicking him under the table. “Your pies going cold you know.”
"Okay," Dean pants, leaning on the mic stand. "I think we've got one more left in us, let's see what we got here." He reaches his hand into the bowl, placing it on the ground and clearing his throat. "Drumroll please, Jo." He jokes, actually getting one as he opens the paper. Castiel watches as his eyes widen in shock.
Dean sighs knowing they've fucked up again and is unable to regret a thing about it. Not when they fall asleep in each other's arms.
"Dean Winchester I never knew you were a cynic," Castiel says, genuinely wondering if his boyfriend has been replaced by a pod person.
"Ugh, yes," Cas says, looking back at Dean for help. Dean shrugs, face red. "Yes, Dean is my friend."
Dean raises his eyebrow, “I thought a cocktail bar would be more your speed.”
Dean sighs, he wants to tell her about the kind of hostility he’s going into here. About how Sam’s wedding guests are gonna judge him, or worse - pity him. All because he was born a fucking Squib. He wants to tell her everything, but just because he's not a wizard doesn't mean he doesn't have to play by their rules. So instead he says, “It's December, Charlie. Do you know how cold Ireland gets in fucking December.”
“Oh no, we’re definitely all doomed,” Dean says, wiping a tear from his eye, as Cas smiles triumphantly. “I’ll let you sleep,” he says, grin softening. “You're probably gonna need your energy to deal with him.”
Dean stays in Sam's place long enough for the sun to set. Spending hours looking over his notes with Rowena's spells. Trying to find the least painful way for Bela to do this. He's got a tentative plan now; one Hannah will have to approve of first, but it's a start.
"I didn't know what to say," Dean says, a bit too loudly considering the fact they're in public. "I woke up and the deal was done. I didn't know if you would want anything to do with me after that."
Dean smiles, "It's okay, I probably deserved it. I need to let you grow up and I can't do that while playing some white knight."
Dean raises an eyebrow, "Really? I thought today was your day off?"
"Clearly it's Sam’s sparkling personality," Eileen says, looking at Sam with a sappy look on her face. Sam smiles back, looking happier than he has in months. Dean adds getting Eileen her body back as soon as possible. To their already insane list of impossible tasks. Sam deserves to look that happy for the rest of his life.
"Cas, I know you didn't force me into anything," Dean says, stroking his thumb over Castiel’s hand. "And don't worry about Kelly’s case. I've decided to testify for her."
“No,” Dean says hastily, Castiel glares at him. “I didn't get that far down, okay? It's a family thing.”
“Alistair tried to escape holding last night, Adler’s bringing Bela in today,” Sam says a frown in his voice. “Gabe’s coming in to watch the spell, but they’ve agreed to your terms for the spell. Officers are already on their way to get Bela now. We just need you.”
"Hey Sammy," Dean squeaks, looking anywhere but at Gabriel. "I just thought I'd stop by and say hello. I even brought the dog over."
"We'll give you both a moment," Kelly says, grabbing Jacks hand. He looks between Dean and Castiel knowingly before following his mother inside.
"Thanks," Dean says letting Cerberus of the leash, groaning while he stands. It's been a long time since his thighs burned like that. Dean shivers at the memory.
Humans weren’t meant to be isolated. They’re social creatures, whether they like it or not. Dean knows this, he learnt about it in high school for Christ’s sake. But it never seemed to matter until he stepped foot on Campbell Ranch.
Scrubbing a paint-stained hand over his jaw, Castiel tries not be concerned about the amount of stubble on his jaw. That’s just to be expected at this point. What is surprising, is the number of empty glasses on his workbench. He genuinely doesn’t remember stopping to get those, or the bag of Cheetos next to them, for that matter.
Dean snaps. "You're a fucking dick!” He yells pulling off his boots and throwing them at him. Cas doesn’t react angering Dean more. “You’re such an asshole. This is Sam’s dying wish, man, why can’t you just believe that I can do this.”
“Well for one, I’m going to put a clear cut no compulsion clause.” Castiel says raising an eyebrow, “I should probably think about adding this to all my deals. I never thought my bloodline would cause such problems by accident, I don’t want it to become an issue again.”
“Dean, this is Virgil. He’s here to represent the Archangel Raphael's,” Hannah says, more formal than ever. She's obviously trying to stay on this angel's good side.
"What are you going to do with them when all this is over?" Charlie asks.
“Yes, at least not with, y’know guys.”
Because Castiel’s neighbour is unspeakably hot. He's exactly the type of man Castiel would flirt with if giving half the chance. Except for every time the guy steps into the elevator with Castiel or they pass each other getting mail, Castiel has to look away. For fear that if he makes eye contact, he'll burst out laughing at the adorable mess of contradictions.
