It was around then that his nightmares started to recede - it was working, Dean thought, the anger - especially when his blood-soaked nightmares were replaced with soaked-through dreams of another variety.
Okay, so it’s surface-of-the-sun levels of hot, but barring any real evidence that Cas is even into him, those kinds of thoughts aren’t helpful, which means Dean has to cut them off at the pass.
Every year, Dean, Benny, Charlie, Garth, and Cas meet up for a week and do something fun. Last year was Benny’s pick, and he took them on a voodoo tour of New Orleans. The year before that was Charlie’s, and she managed to score them general-admittance tickets to E3 in LA.
He shoves in, hard and fast. Drags back out and in again, until he’s fucking the moans loose from Dean’s throat, splitting Dean wide around the perfect shape of him, carving out a space inside Dean’s body that’s just for him.
“There’s a case in Kansas,” Victor says, egg-shell careful, and he’s talking directly to Dean rather than answering Benny’s question. “The MO is exactly the same as that of the Route 66 Ripper.”
because they drink too much, expect the wife to deal with the emotional labor on top of holding down a job, taking care of the kids, and doing seventy-five percent of the chores.
Castiel never would’ve blamed Dean for walking away (though he would’ve been thoroughly heartbroken). A child wasn’t supposed to be a part of the deal.
Not like Cas has ever given a shit about those, as Balthazar confirms with his next statement, "Well, it obviously matters to Cassie."
Sometimes, when Dean’s lying in bed next to a softly snoring Jimmy, he imagines that it’s Cas. If he closes his eyes and really concentrates, he can conjure the phantasm of Cas’ touch, channel the spirit of his intent, like a bunch of kids with a Ouija board pushing the glass with the tips of their fingers. It’s not real, but it’s real enough that Dean feels Cas’ hands on him, just like those kids feel the demonic force of Pazuzu.
“Yeah,” Dean agrees on a shaky exhale, mouth slack. “You did. Now all we have to do is dispose of a body in the nation’s most populous state without being discovered. Easy fuckin’ peasy.”
The guy — Bartholomew, he tells Dean on the drive over — plasters himself to Dean’s back as Dean fits the key into his and Jimmy’s front door. Once the door gives way, they tumble in and within seconds, Bartholomew is trying to manhandle Dean where he wants him. Dean skirts away from his grasp each time, backing up toward the stairs.
, and Cas provides it, so it’s really fucking unfair that Dean met Jimmy first, and why the fuck did he go ahead with the wedding—
The mafia has a board of directors. They’re mediators and overseers of all mafia activity in the US and whilst Dean has the excuse of ignorance of their existence, Cas doesn’t, so why in the absolute
Opening his mouth wide and flattening his tongue against the ridge of Cas’ cock, Dean sucks him down, hot and wet, the blood-rich length of him perfect. Cas tilts his head back on a moan, exposing the long, sweat-shiny line of his throat, eyes closed.
Dean’s not quite sure how Cas lucked out this damn well on the genetics front — a deal with the devil maybe — but he’s certainly not complaining.
It's a difficult point to argue, especially when Cas drags his mouth along Dean's jawline and down the tight tendon of his neck, sharp points of his teeth nipping as he goes. Dean clings to Cas' back with both hands, twisting his fists in Cas' jacket, jerking his hips up as Cas grinds down, lightheaded with the rush of blood south, their rapidly hardening cocks rubbing together through the rough fabric of their pants.
Ah, shit yeah. It had taken a longass time to get Balthazar packed and ready to go in his take-out box. Then they’d left without cleaning up beyond a cursory hose-down outside, because they had to drop off Balthazar’s douchemobile in the far corner of a Walmart lot (right out of reach of the cameras), find their way around the barren desert, and discover a suitably remote place before it got dark and they got lost. The kitchen mess kinda slipped their minds.
Sneaking around the edge of a building with a literal clock ticking down is nowhere near as fucking cool as James Bond makes it look. It’s heart-stoppingly terrifying in fact, and if there wasn’t so much on the line, then Dean would be at least questioning his life choices, but as it stands, he’d be pretty put out if his brother and housekeeper died, so he doesn’t have the luxury.
“Ooh, I wonder if we’ll run into the Big Bad Wolf,” she grins, waggling her eyebrows suggestively at Dean.
“Err, the horror thing,” Dean replies slowly, glancing up as a couple of giggling girls walk past him super close, all sugar-sweet perfume and bedroom eyes. He winks at the blonde, because lovelorn or not, he’s still Dean Winchester. “But what’s the computer thing?”
“Oh!” Dean dramatically cups a hand around his right ear, “I think I heard something? Not sure though, ‘cause I’m in-fucking-visible and so is my hearing.” Before he can think better of it, he powerslams the jug-vase into the hardwood floor with more force than necessary to break the damn thing, but it feels
“Ooh, vicious.” Dean tsks, “I kinda like it though.” He doesn’t ask about Mrs. C or Sammy; he wants to keep Nick’s focus on him. “So, whilst we wait, whaddya wanna do? Catch up? Reminisce about that time you tried to rape me?”
A theory that’s confirmed when the dead bulb hanging above Jimmy’s body sizzles impossibly back to life, the filament burning brighter and brighter until it’s excruciating to look at. A high-pitched noise accompanies it, ringing louder and louder, becoming a barrage of color and sound until Dean doesn’t know whether to cover his eyes or ears.
Castiel’s not stupid, nor is he willfully ignorant. He knows that Dean settled down before he was ready because of the circumstances thrust upon them. He had big plans for all the things he and Castiel were going to do together, all the adventures they were going to have, starting with a year-long road trip (in Dean’s much cooler muscle car) all over the U.S.; going to drive-in movies in the middle of fields, seeing the world’s biggest ball of twine, stargazing on the roof of the Impala, just living a little.
“Woah,” Dean says, and he knows that the bright-burst of shock is showing on his face. He was expecting Cas to suggest sounding or watersports or something. Not
(heh). It’s only now, with Jo openly staring at him like he’s just declared his undying love for butternut squash or something equally out-of-character, that Dean’s starting to suspect the mark he caught a glimpse of as he and Cas hastily pulled (non-ruined) clothes on is actually a lot worse.
Dean navigates his way through the neat groups of bodies on his way over to the tall table, where she’s perched on one of the high-backed stools with a wine glass, wearing a pretty dress that, Dean has to reluctantly admit, looks good.
Dean’s only spoken to Merlin once before; back when he was tracking a Crocotta. The prophet-cum-soothsayer is mostly helpful, if a little cryptic.
“Now? We do what we should have in the first place,” Cas swabs at the blood from his nose, wipes it on the navy of his jeans - and huh, dark clothes really do hide blood well - “We speak to the Commission.”
Benny halts his pantomime search and exhales on a sigh. He turns to look at them, expression hang-dog and pleading. “Y’all need to hear me out, okay? Before you freak the fuck out.”
Cas keeps pressing him down, forcing more and more of himself into Dean’s mouth. He starts thrusting hard, harder, the dirty talk coming thick and fast. “Dean holy shit, you feel amazing, so fucking amazing, the mouth on you, make me come, you’re going to make me come, oh my god—”
“You like it?” Jimmy asks as he walks past, carrying a color-coded and neatly labeled-on-all-sides box.
"If I was, some help you two would be," she shoots back. "I could be dead ten times over in the time it took you to get here."
“Fight with a tree,” Dean responds flippantly, even though it smarts like a motherfucker. Flippant deflection is practically their love language at this point. “What happened to your...
The papers are an in-depth dossier of a UC student named Arthur Ketch. He’s British, born in Blackheath, London, and he’s 21. He’s studying history on an international scholarship. Dean lifts the top sheet to read the one below. It’s his intermediate transcript and schedule, showing his classes and his GPA. Which is a healthy 3.7.
“Retribution,” Cas answers, and really, he’s missing his calling in life by being a lawyer instead of a badass vigilante. His eyes are wild and glassy, the way they get when he’s balls deep inside Dean, and yeah, maybe Cas is a psychopath, but Dean’s never been more in love with him, so, y’know, the psychosis is clearly a shared one.
Cas hums. “That is true. If it makes you feel better, I was actively trying to make you jealous.” He reaches past Dean to snatch up the papers. “And look, it worked.”
There’s a deep, dark-scented pause. “I went looking for you after you left. You seemed upset and I was worried.”
Cas’ mouth curls in amusement. “Where would you suggest? The kitchen covered in grime and dust? One of the bedrooms with a poorly rendered phallus and the remnants of a Lovecraftian summoning spell? The dining room where anyone could walk in at any moment?”
“Don’t move,” Cas growls, voice dipping into the seventh circle of hell. Obediently, Ketch goes heart-stoppingly still, his eyes unnaturally wide and on Dean. Cas tosses Dean the bag containing their murder kit, and Dean digs into it for a pillowcase, which he jams over Ketch’s head. Then, he loops a short length of rope around Ketch’s neck to keep the pillowcase in place, pulling it tight, relishing the squeak of pain their captive lets out.
Dean’s feeling reckless and wild and high on endorphins, so he inhales on a breath of smoke and hands Cas the glowing cherry of the cigarette, and dares the both of them to back away from this. “You should do it for me.”
“I need someone of a similar height and bone structure,” he explains to Dean, cigarette between his lips now that his nerves are dulled enough that his need for nicotine outweighs the pain of touch. He breathes in on the smoke, the filter coming away with lipstick-red smudges.
Sure, laid out like that, it’s so unhinged that the door’s about to fall off, but what about this situation ain’t pure madness?
DVD in the machine, controller in hand, Charlie sinks down onto the couch cushions a safe distance away from Castiel, snatching her carton off the floor.
a creepy guy who lives a couple of doors down from me and Cas. Could’ve been him, I guess. Or just a random asshole thinking he’s funny.”
Outside, he leans against the brickwork underneath a too-bright motion detector light, and sighs on an exhale.
Dean wants to do the same for him. Wants to say that he’s seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. Wants to prove that he’s here to stay. Wants to prove that he sees the beauty in Cas beyond the physical.
Dean’s knee-jerk reaction is to say no. There’s nobody here, and he and Cas haven’t really had time to… uh,
Jo reacts like yet another asshole has told her that girls don’t belong in STEM. “You what?! You haven’t told him that there’s a dangerous nutjob sending you stuff and grabbing you in the showers, because…? You’re embarrassed? Scared? An idiot?”
“I knew there would be others. A lot of them. I knew that going in. But…” she catches her lower lip between middle-class-white teeth. Her shoulders jump again. “I thought I could handle it. I thought it wouldn’t matter. But it does.” Her eyes meet Dean’s. They’re green and earnest, perhaps a little sad.
“Garth’s senior year play,” she explains. “He roped Benny in at the last minute to play Tarzan, ‘cause both the main guy and the understudy got food poisoning or something.”
Them being safe though, that’s news to Dean. They hauled ass out here under the impression that Nick was breathing down their necks. To find out that he’s not? It does have Dean relaxing a little.
“Jimmy,” Dean murmurs, unable to take his eyes off the thick, red gush. “What the hell have you done?”
Right before he takes a bite of his burger, Cas replies, “Where would you like me to start? With the bullets, the vase, the paperwork, or you telling one of our associates to ‘suck it’?”
Cas hums, “Yes. Though I’m not sure what you’re going to do with it. It was a tearoom up until recently, but that might be a little quaint for you.”
He practically runs back to their dorm, ricocheting past bodies in the hallway, photo clutched in a death grip.
With a low grunt of acknowledgment, Castiel gives Dean one final tonguefuck before he withdraws. Hooking an arm around Dean’s middle, Castiel manhandles Dean up the rest of the stairs, sweatpants falling below his knees and almost tripping him up on the way to the second door on the left.
(Not that Dean’s in much better shape himself, but the bow legs hide a multitude of sex-based sins, and there was a
Cas is acting like he cares, and Dean’s not entirely sure what to do with it, being as he can’t stick his dick in it to show affection.
She twists the tissue between her fingers. “Oh, yes. Who wouldn’t be? Castiel is extremely handsome. And so smart and witty too. I think almost anybody would find him irresistible. But he also has his powers.”
the demon is telling the truth about a spell that could bind the leviathan? It would mean that Castiel could continue his mission without the creatures siphoning his power. The last few months since he opened Purgatory have been… difficult and uncomfortable.
Gabriel rubs his hands together. “Why, thank you. Now, Cassie, I challenge you to down all of those shots. If you’re like this half-cut, I can’t wait to see you toasted!”
What kind of self-respecting thirty-somethings all agree to traipse off into the woods for a week without so much as making sure there’s a spa and no axe murderers?
“Are you awake?” Cas asks, halting at the foot of their bed, right outta fist-swingin’ range. He squints at Dean like he’s trying to figure it out for himself.
Ketch’s eyes roam down Dean’s body like a physical caress, and bile burns at the back of Dean’s throat. “You’re in perfect shape, Dean.”
She presses a hand to her chest, bright pink talons against tanned skin. “Ouch. You’re hurting my feelings.”
(He would be concerned about who else has been in this bed, but Jo makes a point of not bringing dates back here, partially ‘cause her roommate is apparently a psychopath, and partially because she — like Dean — just has a weird thing about people seeing her living space).
Castle or no fucking castle, Cas is gonna get a tongue lashing for this one, and not the kind he was enjoying last night either.
Dean doesn’t need to imagine exactly what being a donor would entail, not when incubi feed off of sexual energy.
“Cool,” Dean says, silently begging the bartender to materialize. He’s down twenty bucks and if he wants to get laid tonight, he’s going to have to start from scratch with someone else, who, secret nerd or not, doesn’t put their hands on strangers without permission.
That’s enough for Dean. The accusation bubbles up, thick and hot like lava, and he doesn’t even consider stopping himself from demanding, “Where’s Cas?”
He hasn’t told Cas yet because he’s still struggling with the spaces between the stilted words they’re barely saying to each other. An awkward ‘hey’ here, a self-conscious ‘will you be needing the room tonight?’ there.
Dean doesn’t know what heartbreak feels like, but he’s pretty sure it’s close to this. The steady thump of his pulse in his ears is the only thing that assures him his heart is, in fact, still beating, instead of lying in glittering shards at the bottom of his ribcage.
Again, Dean could ask, but right now, Cas is Schrödinger's crush. If Dean doesn’t look in the box, then there’s still a chance Cas could be interested in him.
But then the elevator doors open to a couple intertwined so tightly around one another that they may as well be one person. They spring apart when the doors start to close again, the pair of them flushed and giggling and obviously completely smitten.
Dean hasn’t really thought that far ahead. His family moves around a lot, so he can meet up with them anywhere, no pressure. But he hasn’t exactly been looking forward to it. His dad’s a pretty strict authoritarian who enjoys reminding Dean that he’s disappointed in Dean’s decision to pursue college.
Not Dean’s go-to state of being, especially as it’s getting harder to think straight around Benny and the urge to blindly act on his rage, but he’ll make a concerted effort, ‘cause Cas asked so nicely.
A few seconds tick by. A trickle of sweat runs down inside the collar of Dean’s shirt. The nice one he hurriedly dug outta their closet so that he didn’t look like a bum in comparison to Cas, even though they’re both overdressed for this dive.
“Hold still,” Castiel commands in a strained voice, but Dean ignores him, desperate to get more of him inside, to have him turn Dean inside out, to make him come all over the sheets, to leave him fucked out and sore.
There are lots of ironies in the world. According to Alanis Morissette, rain on your wedding day is one of them. Another, Dean would suggest, is meeting your fiance’s identical twin for the very first time on said rainy wedding day and realizing that you feel more attracted to him simply saying your name than you’ve ever managed for your husband-to-be.
Dean smirks sardonically and Nick returns it with a sharp grin of his own, “I know what you’re thinking. But are you willing to take that risk? What if you miss? What if the knife doesn’t embed in my brain like you’re no doubt envisaging right now?”
Well, not quite, ‘cause the last thing they need is a fucking RICO case, but the gang will be long gone before then anyways.
So, Cas was planning something. Something that hinged on Dean getting his ass outta bed and helping Cas search for a karambit that he wasn’t looking for? Or was just that a ruse?
“Hello, Dean,” the kid always says like the words carry weight, and he’s probably a foreign exchange student at the community college or something, ‘cause he’s got a slight intonation on certain words and the occasional heavy rolling ‘r’ when he forgets himself and nerds out about the latest band he’s in love with.
It’s tense as hell, and Dean’s only just realizing the consequences of his angsty admission on the stairs. It’s not like any of his friends are super virtuous — Charlie spent most of her spare time in college hacking the shit out of corporations — but he doubts they’ll be able to overlook capital murder. Not even if it was entirely justified.
"My family lived in Kansas," Dean says, wiping sticky fingers on the smartest pair of jeans he owns. "Before John killed my mom and dragged Sammy and me out on his mission. Maybe it’s got something to do with that?”
“I almost admire your bravery,” Meg tells Dean with a serrated smile. “Happy to die for the unrequited love of your life. It’s cute.”
The hand on his thigh squeezes tighter, bleeding heat through his pants. Castiel swallows hard against the urge to move his leg away.
Ignoring Dean’s sudden-onset bout of mutism with a lip compression that even Ray Charles would be able to see the uncertainty in, Benny attempts to be the one sane person in the room. “Hey there, Castiel,” he says, spooked-horse gentle.
is a question for his younger, dumber, more naive self. But there’s no doubt about it in Dean’s mind now: he should’ve stayed.
Thankfully, Cas doesn’t argue or ask questions, he simply leans forward to tell the driver whilst Dean uncovers his cell, “What do you want? What will it take for you to fuck off?”
“Fuck you,” Dean says and means it wholeheartedly. And then he’s stalking off to hide somewhere because there’s absolutely no way that after that performance he isn’t going to get kicked off the show.
” He plants a sloppy, chocolatey kiss on Cas’ jaw, slides an arm around his broad shoulders. He pretends to catch sight of Ms. Hayes out of the corner of his eye and starts, “Oh, hello Ms. Hayes -
Pinhead turns his attention back to Jimmy. Chatterer has him now, trapped in a bizarre embrace. Jimmy’s voice sounds raw, hollowed out, and his eyes are shining when he demands, “What do you want?”
It works. For now, at least. And Dean gets back to work. Using the needle-nose pliers to grip the nail, he slowly pries the first one out by pulling up on the nail and using the tip of the pliers as a lever.
Laughing, he turns on his haunches to face his friends, grit under the toe of his boot. “The Shining.”
See: The Drew Barrymore death in Scream, the twist at the end of the first Saw movie, the Candyman ending.
They spend the rest of their time at the carnival racking up wins on the skill-based games — the ones that are mostly winnable, unlike the rigged ones Cas warns him about. Cas is scary good at them; obliterating the red star sitting in the middle of a paper target, managing to score a hoop on the basketball game, and popping multiple balloons with the darts he’s handed by the vendor.
“I could see the sky,” Castiel says, and yeah, so can Dean right now. “Past the shadow. When the knife went in and I knew I was going to die, I could see the stars.”
Hospitals, much like Florida, are God’s waiting room. Coincidentally, they’re also both clammy and noisy with an overabundance of yammering meth heads. And a shit place to spend a long weekend.
In a last-ditch attempt to assuage the guilt and perhaps explain himself to a couple of guys who are just as done with all this shit as Dean is, he mutters, "I thought once you got married, you stopped counting the dating ones? I thought they didn't matter anymore."
Dean’s just thankful that the thing is blunt, because otherwise he’d be getting hauled away for murder right now.
The dean gurgles as Castiel’s boy strangles him up against the morgue wall, loafers scrabbling to get purchase against the tiles, with no luck.
Dean stretches as soon as his feet touch solid ground, peeling his moist shirt away from his sweaty back. It smells pretty good out here, nice and crisp and woodsy. It’s a shame that Garth has chosen to let them all be murdered at the fucking Overlook Hotel, ‘cause otherwise it would be a kinda cool area to explore.
“Whatever,” Dean mutters, mildly affronted but mostly annoyed. “Are we doing this or not?” He tucks his hands into his jeans pockets to hide the shake in them. “Better we at least try to get something out of him now than leaving it a few more hours, right?”
Yet here he is, along with four other dumbasses, standing at the foot of the porch steps, peering into the darkness of the inn’s doorway, actually
It’s said in that quiet, sinister way. The one loaded with meaning and menace that should discourage Dean from back-chatting. But he’s never been sensible when it comes to Cas. He sure as shit ain’t gonna start now.
Red-hot glare leaving the side of Dean’s face, Cas reaches into the box, coming back with a Bavarian Crème in hand.
what they’re doing, but denial ain’t just a river in Egypt and Dean Winchester is nothing if not pig-headed until the very end.
“You’re insane,” Tim-Tom-Tony tells him, mouth quivering around the words. “You have to take us back to the showroom right now or—”
Not that any of them can truly understand, but in this line of work, they’re the people in Dean’s life who come the closest to it.
Anyway, Dean suspects it’s a little less about saving souls and more about owning them. Which, well, Dean wins in that department too — the devil can’t have Cas, ‘cause he belongs to Dean.
Dean pulls away and Castiel immediately mourns the loss of all that muscle and warmth. He turns to face his husband, because apparently this is an argument they need to be having instead of sex.
“He’d most likely rant about the lingering ambiguity of federal statutes and then go off on a tangent about the conspiracy of sliced bread.”
“I don’t know for definite that it’s even him!” Dean protests uselessly, after he practically accused the guy. He doesn’t know what the solution is, but this doesn’t feel like it.
Garth has shuffled away on his knees to set up the movie. With a brief ‘I’ll handle it’ glance at the others, Dean follows him. Everybody starts talking amongst themselves, and Dean curls a hand over Garth’s shoulder. “You okay, man?”
), let alone leading one, steps forward to shake Cas’ hand. Cas obliges, but then makes a point of bringing Dean in on the introductions.
Dean’s eyes find Cas. He’s smiling in Dean’s direction, his lips still bitten-pink from their lust-fueled kiss earlier.
Breaking apart for some much-needed oxygen, Dean butts his forehead against Cas’, and before he can think better of it or chicken out, he gives into everything he’s been trying to avoid for the last decade, distills it down into a few short words that he should’ve been saying for every one of those three-thousand-six-hundred-and-seventy-two days, “Cas, I love you. Always have. Always will. You know that, right?”
“Should we try calling out?” Dean asks, brain not entirely engaged, ‘cause he knows that’s a terrible idea — right up there with lighting a fire.
There’s a perverse pleasure in knowing that Cas’ bloody ownership prints are right there, contained only by cotton and Dean’s single-minded determination not to get caught before he can make Cas whole. Which,
Immediately, movement snags Dean’s attention: something — someone, Cas — retreating into the shadows. He only gets a fleeting glance, but he can see that while Cas' body is still horribly vulnerable, it’s fuller than before; more meat on his bones (literally).
“Of course, man,” the guy responds with a tight smile. “My ma has panic attacks, so I get it, yanno? Just glad I could help.”
Dean can’t let that transpire. No matter what happens to him - whether he lives or dies (and he would very much prefer the former over the latter) - Nick cannot be allowed to walk out of here.
“Looks like you’ve been outvoted by the lovebirds,” Charlie informs Benny. “And anyway, we came all the way out here to see this place. For what it’s worth, I vote that we stay here overnight. See how it goes.”
This is their opportunity to start all over again, completely fresh, with a clean slate, with no chance of people turning them in or bodies falling out of closets.
“I don’t know,” Dean answers testily, rubbing at the nape of his neck. His skin is damp and goosefleshy; slick with sweat. “Looks deserted.”
Dean’s a good liar, perfected the art of it the first time a paying customer pulled out his stubby cock and Dean cooed over it like it was the size of a baseball bat rather than a softball. But that’s short-term lies; for long-term bullshittery in the faces of people you care about, you’ve gotta have stamina and a good memory. And also be motivated to keep the truth from coming out.
For 1,080 seconds, Jimmy was an only child on this earth. His mom, the undivided attention of the nurses, the choked air he sucked into his tiny lungs — it was all his.
She steps forward and snatches it out of his hand, then retreats. She considers him for a long moment, her eyes darting between the food in her one hand and Dean on the bench. She offers him the tray of syrupy mess.
Dean can hear the sibling annoyance in Castiel’s voice when he replies, “I did not start it! You did. Poor Balthazar is still finding salt in his clothes, Raphael won’t go near a jeweler, and Michael? Michael’s terrified of mirrors, thanks to you.”
Staring up into the gloom, he hesitates at the bottom of the ground floor stairs for just a second, wondering if maybe they should do that tactical retreat thing. But then Cas is at his side, and together, they start climbing.
Dean’s solid and warm behind him, smelling good and looking better, and Castiel sighs happily. After the uncertainty of the day, this is something familiar, something easy for them both.
“Everything was fine until we were seventeen. Jimmy found a pornographic magazine underneath my bed.” Cas stares out the window, watching a rust-colored squirrel climb a tree on the other side of the driveway. “He was flicking through it when I came home early from serving food to the homeless. He started calling me names, telling me that I was unclean, queer, a fag, whatever.” Cas rolls his shoulders, shrugging off the sting of the words. “He was scared, I could see it. He was hiding just like I was, but rather than talk about it, he distanced himself from me.” Taking a moment to breathe deeply, Cas visibly gears up for the real bad shit. “And then, one day after school, I was called into the study. My parents were both there and so was Jimmy. On my father’s desk was a stack of dirty magazines. Some of them were mine, some of them weren’t.”
Of course, if Dean thought that a break-up was going to keep Castiel away from him, he was sorely mistaken.
And if the others get in the way? It doesn’t bear thinking about, even if it’s all that’s going through Dean’s mind right now.
Dean follows Cas’ line of sight, and his stomach turns over. Through the floor-to-ceiling ground floor windows of the conference room, Dean can see his brother bound to a chair, bloody-nosed, chin to his chest. Further into the room is the recognizable figure of Nick. He’s pacing back and forth, phone held to his mouth. He actually looks nervous, which he
As a former marine, Dean’s father was hot shit with a gun in his hand, but plain shit with a blade (at least in the beginning).
There aren’t many men who can pull off pink. The list is exhaustive: Tom Hardy, The Rock, Jason Momoa. That’s it. Them’s the rules. Dean didn’t make ‘em, but he’s damn sure gonna enforce ‘em.
There's a short pause and Dean's pretty sure even Sam isn't so sexually uptight that he can't figure out what's going on at this end of the phone. He must've had sex at some point in his life, right? He has a kid for Christ's sake. Unless Madison spawned asexually like an amoeba or some shit.
Eating their food, they start walking to their sophomore class together, Dean — like the gentleman he is — propping the building’s main door open for her as they make their way to room 3110 for their lecture on isentropic processes.
In this light, Dean can’t really see much of anything. It doesn’t look particularly swollen or bruised above the line of his sock. At least there are no bones sticking out at odd angles, but Dean’s no medical expert; the damage could be internal, like a torn ligament or something. “Want me to leave your socks on?”
Castiel is inside. Stretched out on a lining that looks like red satin. Eyes shut. Hands folded on his stomach. Sadly not dressed in full Universal Studios Dracula wardrobe; instead, he’s in jeans and…
As he enters their building, Dean’s already imagining Cas hunched at his desk, squinting down at the pages of a poli-sci textbook. He’s probably got that little ineffectual desk fan of his going, ‘cause it’s hotter than satan’s asshole at the moment, and literally
Cas’ eyes flash to him briefly, guttering light from the candle reflecting in the shine of his pupil, before he tucks a hand underneath his head and looks to the rafters. “According to the stories, the Marquis De Sade had possession of it briefly, while imprisoned in the Bastille, and used it to barter with the guard for the paper on which he wrote
The next night in bed with Jimmy, Dean refuses his husband’s timid, touching-a-hot-stove advances. There’s relief warring with disappointment visible in the lines of his handsome face. Dean’s doing them both a favor; Jimmy won’t have to wear a cilice for a month or say a million Hail Marys or whatever, and Dean doesn’t have to fake-moan his way through the faltering exploration and pretend that he’s anything other than uncomfortable with anyone except Cas touching him these days.
Her eyes drop to Dean’s abdomen, where his shirt didn’t fall the whole way. His sweats are slung so low that it’s obvious to anyone with a singular brain cell that he’s not wearing anything underneath.
Single file, Charlie going first, Garth next, and Dean bringing up the rear, they begin to follow the path.
The only reasoning Dean’s come up with so far is because Cas is petty AF until the end and would rather deal with things his own way. Even if that way by his own admission was insufficient and ended up putting their families in danger.
“That makes you the promiscuous girl who gets killed off in the first twenty minutes, then,” Cas points out with no small amount of delight and malice, which just proves Dean’s killer-based theory.
A couple of beats pass and then Dean’s shivering as Cas’ warmth breath ghosts over the back of his neck. He turns his head enough to catch Cas’ eye, only inches between them and Cas is watching him through those thick, inky lashes, “Our honeymoon. I’ve decided where we’re going.”
The door to one of the trucks emblazoned with: 'The Winchester Bros: Saving People, Chasing Storms' is open and blaring obnoxious hair metal. Castiel recognizes the tune as one that Dean used to hum when he was particularly anxious.
If you enjoy dystopian, semi-autobiographical works about drug use (and judging by your previous purchases I’m assured that you do), then
Dean swallows hard around nothing, already hemorrhaging his advantage and losing the ground he’d worked so hard to gain today. “Kids, remember?”
Just as Dean’s about to ask a very important question about Meg and her alibi, the sky abruptly tears open, rain pouring down in cold sheets. They’ve got some protection from the tree canopy, but not nearly enough.
And dear death too, 'cause this is gonna be a petite mort to remember and wet dream about for the foreseeable future.
wants her to slap Cas, but if she faints then they can sneak off to the school restrooms and Dean can live up to the graffiti that a 13-year-old Sammy discovered written in a Connecticut bathroom stall about his older brother.
“Yeah?” Dean asks, trying to drag himself back to the here and now and not entirely succeeding, stuck on the way Cas had looked at him like he was something worth looking at. “Wanna share those thoughts?”
Cas mouths at a painful spot on Dean’s neck — a mark he left there last night. “Good, then we’ve got time to go again.”
When he was fourteen, he was given a key to the teacher’s lounge at his school, because — and this is a direct quote — “
It’s enough to break the spell, and Dean jerks his head toward the decking steps leading down onto the lawn. “C’mon.”
If Dean had expected Cas to be a gentle, candles-lit, soft-music, let's-make-love kinda guy, he would have been entirely wrong. (Also, pretty disappointed, especially after that hyper-masculine display of violence).
He scrabbles at Cas’ jeans, popping the button, pushing the clothing down around strong thighs. Pressing his forehead to the thick muscle of Cas’ thigh, Dean takes a second to breathe in the familiar, sharp scent of him, and Cas pets his hair, gentle and caring. Which is much too close to feelings and history and other places Dean
When the doors ding open on the fifteenth floor, Dean steps out into the carpeted hallway. The decor is all warm tones and dark wood paneling, and there’s the subtle curl of luxurious vanilla scent in the air — probably the result of an expensive diffuser rather than one of those cheap plug-ins.
“Nothing personal, hmm?” Cas asks archly as Dean clambers out of the fountain, his jeans wet and heavy.
There’s a lot to unpack and to hang out to air, but Dean can be patient. After all, he’s waited two years for this. He can wait a few more days. Find some more victims.
In his periphery, Dean can see Charlie’s shoulders shaking. Across from him, Cas pulls his bottom lip between his teeth. Benny’s not making direct eye contact with anyone.
They speed-walk the rest of the way to the main gate in silence, Dean occasionally throwing a glance over his shoulder to make sure they aren’t being followed.
It's after eight a.m. on a standard Wednesday — which as everyone knows is the worst day of the week, whether it's standard, special, or ultimate edition — and he's not even considered getting his ass outta bed yet.
But they’re not smart. Certainly not enough to be able to keep themselves hidden from the Cenobites forever.
Castiel can feel the burn of tears at the backs of his eyes. This isn’t why he came here today, but now he’s thankful he did.
Dean leans against the doorway, coffee in hand. “Broads, eh? Can’t live with ‘em, can’t live without ‘em.”
“Yeah?” Dean can hear the nervous twitch in his own voice as he hangs his jacket up in the hall. He wipes his clammy palms on his jeans and takes a deep breath, steeling himself for whatever’s about to come.
“Cool.” Dean slides off the table, tries not to wince. He’s not sure when he took a punch to the kidney, but hopefully he won’t be pissing blood this time.
He follows the path, eyes darting this way and that, but there’s no sign of either Benny or anyone with a camera at the ready.
“Guys,” Benny butts in, exasperated. “C’mon. We’re supposed to be havin’ fun. Let’s just watch the movie, huh?”
He shouldn’t be surprised that the others think Cas is fucked up or whatever, but it still kinda hurts. As always, it’s the two of them against the world. Nobody understands them. They don’t even try.
“Oh,” Benny says, eyes bouncing from Dean to Cas and back again. He seems to mentally shake himself before stepping past Charlie and leaning across the coffee table to offer Cas his hand. “Nice to meet ya, Cas.”
“Who died and made you king?” Garth snarks, all 90s teenage movie sass, and okay, that’s it, Dean’s had enough.
It’s been a crazy year, and now that things are starting to settle down, maybe they can just enjoy one another. Maybe they can be normal and act like every other couple that hasn’t murdered another person. They’ll still be clingy, and Meg may well end up getting a well-timed drink thrown in her face. But things are gonna be good. Dean’s feeling hopeful.
He stays there for some time, only coming out of his reverie when Ben puts in an appearance with his bookbag slung over his shoulder. His private-school tie is crooked and sometimes, it makes Dean’s heart ache with how much his kid is like him.
“Absolutely not.” Cas shuts Dean down instantly, no room for argument. “If you think I’m letting him near you after last time, then you’re certifiable.”
Thanks for the recommendation, I bought all three hoping that you would be able to combine for them?
Dean’s blood is a hot rush under his skin as he fights the instinct to trace the lines of Cas’ throat tattoo with his tongue. This could go either way; violence or sex, and Dean’s here for both, but this is Cas’ show, so he’s gotta be the one to decide.
Eyes never leaving Dean’s, Cas lifts his hand to his mouth and licks Dean's come from his fingers, sucking his forefinger between his kiss-swollen lips. He removes the hand covering Dean’s mouth.
He gets the arched eyebrow for that, and the band that's been squeezing Dean's heart all day loosens.
“In his eyes at least, yeah. He probably thinks the same about all of us. I know you felt the same way in the beginning too, even though we were just worried about you.”
The creature howls again, backing up, but there’s nowhere for it to go. The can in Dean’s hand gets cooler.
them, but he’s excited to see Jo. She left campus before The Party That Changed His Life, and they’ve texted over the summer, but it’s hardly the same.
Dean forces his eyes open. There’s a mirror above the white porcelain sink with crimson words scrawled in lipstick. He staggers toward it, braces himself on the edge of the sink, and stares at the words until his vision cooperates and the meaning penetrates the fog of his brain.
Dean nods, not trusting his voice. He goes to turn back to his suitcase, but Cas is quick, and he’s across the room, grabbing Dean’s arm so hard that he pinches the skin. “Why?” he asks, artless and agonized. “Why are you leaving me? I don’t understand.”
Before his upstairs brain has a chance to catch up, one of Dean’s hands goes to Cas’ hair automatically, not pushing, just holding on, fingers slipping through the strands. Cas draws back up and off, licking a stripe up the underside of Dean’s cock, and Dean loves that mouth, has never been able to take his eyes off the pink plushness of it, especially not when they do this. But... “Cas, we should stop.”
Maybe Castiel is a dude that Dean’s pissed off on another one of his cases and Daphne is his little helper.
Punctuating his point, Dean flips his friend-slash-colleague-slash-wingman the bird. Not waiting for any sort of comeback, he starts wading his way through the tightly-packed bodies, aiming for the bar, but keeping his eye on the way his new fan watches his every move.
By the time Benny and Victor show up after their visit to the latest crime scene just over the border, Dean and Kevin have (reluctantly on Dean’s part, but he did promise to let Charlie tend to her talons) obtained all three case files from the station, and they may as well be filled in with crayon and contain an essay about what the filing officer did over his summer vacation for all the insight they bestow on the investigation.
The warehouse they raided? There were enough teeth spilled from gaping, bloodied mouths that night to make the tooth fairy a millionaire. Something to do with teeth? It seems even less likely, somehow, that Cas’ riddle involves a trip to the dentist.
Jimmy narrows his eyes. “Are you sure? Since the wedding, you’ve been… I don’t know, moping? And now you’re—” He gestures in the air with the slice of steak on his fork. “—agitated.
“So far, the demons have worked through the four out of seven of the sins for the spell to open the gates - gluttony, wrath, sloth, and pride. Lust is in progress, and tonight, greed and envy will also manifest. When the gates open, it will not just be seven individual demons spreading the corruption, but any demon that walks the earth. Things will very quickly escalate.”
The message must be getting through to Nick because Dean’s yet to be kidnapped and murdered for being a double agent.
“Anything else you didn’t think to tell me - anything you didn’t think important, Cas? Maybe something related to the fact that you’re taking Nick not being dead exceptionally well.”
Winded, Benny shoves himself into a sitting position, his palms pitted with dirt, his face flushed and expression tight. He seems okay, just shocked and freaked out.
Cas crowds in closer, his hand stroking fast and rough, letting Dean fuck into the tight tunnel of his palm. “Do you love me?”
“Cas— tiel,” Dean shivers out, hands curling uselessly into fists when the rough rasp of Castiel’s stubble scrapes the tender flesh of his inner thighs, his tongue working Dean open, shoving hard and slick through the tight ring of muscle. Dean’s breath catches in his lungs, and he curves his ass back, trying to spread his legs as wide as he can get whilst trapped and pinned down. He moans into the crook of his arm, face on fire, thighs trembling, pleasure ratcheting higher and higher as he lets his brother-in-law eat him out on his wedding day. He can feel his ass clenching as Castiel’s tongue works, penetrating him over and over again. It’s oh so dirty, but Dean
Sam’s not afflicted with the same damage, but that’s mostly ‘cause Dean went hungry so his little brother didn’t.
“No,” Dean pants, terror mounting and nerves already shredded. “Charlie, what’d you do with the poker?”
“What movie is it?” Cas asks quietly, metaphorically tiptoeing around the uncomfortable boundaries of Charlie and Garth’s mutual glare.
“Yeah,” Dean says, internally debating whether to visit the RA now or in the morning. “Don’t worry about it at all, man.” He glances down at the photo again.
Dean licks his dry lips, glances up and down the trail to make sure there’s nobody in sight. Then he says loudly — too loudly to simply be a conversation between the two of them — “I thought I’d, y’know, give it a try. Get in shape and all that.”
On unsteady legs, but bolstered by the fact that the campus is teeming with people at this time of day, and that he has Cas entirely on his side, ready to bloody his knuckles on this guy’s nose again, Dean slowly approaches him.
Charlie scritches under Giblet’s chin, “You’re super cute, yes you are. You’ve got those crazy green eyes huh?” She feeds Giblet a piece of chicken, which Giblet takes with a lot more care than she did from Castiel. “I know somebody else who has pretty green eyes.” Another piece goes in, “But he’s definitely not as cute as you.”
“Message received,” Dean confirms unevenly as a trickle of blood oozes down his neck and over his collarbone.
The sound is loud in the room and a glass pane shatters somewhere, but the bullet misses him - which is kinda the important thing here - and Dean rushes blindly at Nick.
Benny laughs. For the first time since he watched Dean devour the pastry back at the station, and it’s odd. Disjointed. So Dean looks,
“Is this a rubber-glue situation, ‘cause it’s already gonna be a challenge to get out of these pants.”
“A new record. Anyway, what do you want, Winchester? I was just about to give myself a mani-pedi. While you guys were in the air, I watched a youtube video on Stormtrooper nail art. Pretty cool, huh?”
“No!” Dean and Cas snap in unison. Though Dean does give her points for finesse. She’s been needling them about getting her a car for the better part of a year now. He’s almost impressed with her ability to crowbar it into any conversation, moment, or circumstance.
He’s supposed to be working on a purchase order for the auto shop where he’s a mechanic, but he’s been staring out the window for what could be minutes or hours now. The lawn that wraps around the side of the house is filled with dandelions and their bright, happy shade of yellow; blobs of color in a washed-out skyline of gray.
At least the kind Jimmy throws, ‘cause without the booze, the music, the horny couples sneaking off to fuck in bedrooms, what you’ve got is a glorified
It’s apparent that Cas takes it as a timed challenge, because he redoubles his efforts, and Dean swallows a mouthful of spit, caught on Cas’ cock, the risk and horror of the situation drip-drip-dripping into his veins like an IV filled with dopamine.
Coy and beguiling in the way Dean’s learned Cas can be, whilst simultaneously being the dommiest dom, his boyfriend begins backing away. “I’ll see you at home?”
Dean turns from the window, eyes still adjusting to the dark stillness of the room. This is his and Cas’ space; the place where they’ve laughed, cried, fucked, tormented each other with pleasure and pain, so it should feel full of life. Full of
Instead, he swallows hard and nods. “Yeah. Yes.” Against every instinct in his body except the urge to protect Cas, Dean steps into the attic, putting himself between the Cenobites and the man he’s willing to go to hell for. “I found Castiel.” He gestures to the body.
“Cas,” Dean hisses, not entirely in his right mind, not able to think beyond this thing between them, incapable of forming a rational thought that doesn’t result in him getting fucked in the next thirty seconds. “Please, please.
Castiel’s about to tell her that she can test-drive this Maserati, and if she doesn’t steer it into a body of water, then she can have Castiel’s old Mazda CX5, but he’s interrupted by the salesman wailing, “You’ll kill us all!”
An arm snakes around Dean’s waist, hand coming to rest on the wing of his hip, casually possessive, “I’ll get coffee with you--” Cas offers, all thinly veiled threat, misplaced jealousy, and cologne that makes Dean’s dick twitch, “--Show you the sights, give you the full tour.”
Cas is the organized bit, Dean himself is the chaos. Or so Cas would have you believe, but before he came along, Dean was managing quite well, thank you very much (aside from the grocery store robbery, the failed marriage, the whole getting-his-young-girlfriend-pregnant thing… so yeah, maybe Dean’s the fucking chaos, alright).
“Let’s just get this shit over with,” Benny says, ever the pragmatist, waving a hand in a loose gesture of ‘hurry up.’
skin. Aside from a little blood at the temples, where the flesh is still knitting itself back together with some help from whatever supernatural force brought Cas this far, nobody would ever know.
Keeping the flashlight off, they cross the lot, checking for stalkers and storms, and finding none, they dart to the car. Shoes crunching over shards of glass, Dean peeks in through what used to be the driver’s side window. The holder where the GPS used to be is gone. Because of course it is.
know something is going on. He’s just about the furthest thing from stupid, so Dean often wonders if it’s willful ignorance that’s brought them this far without divorce proceedings getting invoked, rather than Cas and Dean being any kind of subtle about their regular meet-ups.
Organized religion isn’t for Dean, but he reluctantly admires anyone with the faith it requires. To believe in something so strongly that you devote your existence to it has — until very recently — been an experience that bypassed Dean entirely. He knows that there’s no god, and even if there was, he wouldn’t want anything to do with the capricious fucker, but the idea of it? Of there being something more than all this? Sure, he can relate to that.
Dean’s just about to head out when the doorbell goes. On an impatient sigh, he opens the door to a scruffy tax account type with a solemn expression and strong jaw, “Sorry, I don’t have the time for whatever you’re about to sell me.”
“—a ‘quick wipedown’?” Dean repeats, incredulous. He throws the covers back and slides out of bed, ‘cause this is an argument that requires pants. Hastily shoving one leg then the other into a pair of sweatpants, he turns to Cas, standing there — for all appearances — utterly unmoved. But Dean knows his tells now.
“You mean besides the lack of sleep, the crappy plane journey, and the person who’s copycatting my father’s murders? Yeah, I’m peachy.”
Dean clamps his jaw shut, stewing in confused anger, and not sure what to do about it; split between frantically tearing the room apart looking for signs of Cas and telling Jimmy to go fuck himself.
“And you’re here because you don’t like him doing it to other people? Even though you don’t like letting him do it to you once per week, and he needs to do it to survive?”
It has Dean’s heart beating arrhythmically, has him wondering if this is Cas making a move or whether he’s just reacting to having someone to curl up against. Or maybe it was there before Dean even got in? Totally unrelated.
Still, he's nothing if not a team player - suburban orgy or piss-poor criminals be damned - so he digs deep - a lot easier these days now that practically all of his transactions are in cash for obvious reasons - and drops a crisp (genuine, he’s not a jerk) twenty into the honesty box, musing whether to go for a slice of lemon drizzle or bundt cake.
First things first; he’s gotta get back to the others. And fast. Whatever the fuck is going on here is a two-person job, ‘cause Benny was there with them when they all heard the pipe-banging, and he was inside the hotel when someone planted the picture of Dean and Cas outside the pool building.
“Hmm,” Cas says, palm on Dean’s jaw, stroking the pad of his thumb over Dean’s bottom lip, “Why do you think we got married on the leap year? I have another four years to come up with something to beat this.”
And if there’s even a one percent chance of it, then Dean and Cas will spend the rest of their lives looking over their shoulders, never knowing which day might be their last.
Dean huffs a quiet laugh. “Sounds like something I would do.” A couple of beats pass, and he turns serious. “I thought I lost you today, Cas. It was the worst thirty seconds of my fucking life.”
That evening, Dean calls Cas’ friend in France, the one whose address he posted Cas’ wedding invite to a couple of years ago. He doesn’t have anything other than a name, doesn’t know how much this Balthazar knows about Dean and Cas’ relationship, whether he even knows of Dean’s existence beyond his calligraphed name on an ivory invite sent out with optimism.
Also, the next chapter may possibly be a week behind because I have a conference presentation to prepare for this coming week. I'll try to get chapter 7 out on time, but just be aware that I may not be able to - apologies in advance and just in case.
“Jesus Christ, no!” Benny yells, and Dean can see the tiny cracks forming in his story. Benny’s eyes bounce between the three of them and he visibly deflates. "Look, he said he had to piss, and I went with him, right?”
Dean elects to remain silent about the fact that it’s backed up somewhere in cyberspace and on Charlie’s cell too. Can’t clue technophobe Benny into how memory ain’t all floppy disks and hard drives the size of rooms these days.
The clock on his phone informs him that it’s 11:56 and Cas was supposed to have been here eleven minutes ago.
They’re on their couch, Dean stretched out so that his feet are touching Cas’ bare thigh. Cas is sitting straight-backed and working through his applications for law schools, trying to decide which one deserves him.
It’s a good question. And one Dean’s not really considered. He’s been too busy trying to come up with solutions to problems directly in front of them, rather than considering the end game.
Dean shrugs with a nonchalance he doesn’t feel. “Then I guess the three of us have first-class tickets to hell. Hope the view’s nice.”
They enter through the nearest door, though there seem to be several. Above them is a beautiful, mostly intact skylight. They walk around the edge, checking for murderous pipe-bangers as they go.
“No,” Cas answers after a beat. “I’m pretty sure he moved here alone a couple of weeks ago. He never mentioned anybody else.”
Luckily, the place is mostly charred to crisp, which means that any remaining gold is paired with black.
But. Cas isn’t the only one adept at this game by now, and Dean knows exactly how to get a rise (in oh,
Cas sits near the front during the ceremony, never taking his eyes off the tie still around Dean’s neck.
Hand falling from Cas’ head to his shoulder, Dean hooks his left leg around Cas’ waist as their bodies grind together, the rock-hard velvet of Cas’ dick rubbing slick over Dean’s. Cocks pressed together, Cas wraps his hand around the both of them as best he can, and Dean whines low in his throat, hips stuttering, fucking his cock into the meat of Cas' palm.
When Dean and Benny returned with the luggage, the others had already finished setting up and Cas had started to lay his sleeping bag next to Dean’s. Of course, Dean, like the coward he usually likes to think he isn’t, beat a hasty retreat and settled himself between Charlie and Garth. He thought he’d be safe. Or at least, saf
The urge to turn around and chase after him is almost too much to bear. Dean doesn’t wanna let him get away, but at the same time, Dean's clothes don't really scream running attire so much as they do 'washed up rockstar'. If anybody was watching from their windows and happened to see Dean running after the jogger, they’d assume the worst and Dean would get slapped into cuffs faster than Rob Zombie can churn out another failed
The demon is forced down onto one knee, then the other. Its fight trickles away into nothing and Castiel dims his own power so that it’s just enough to hold the demon in place.
Along the way, ducking in and out of musty rooms, Dean counts how many graffitied dicks they find — like a phallus-based scavenger hunt. By the time they reach number twenty-seven, everyone — Cas included — is playing along, critiquing the artwork like they’re at the fucking Louvre.
sensible, in all honesty, so Dean’s hoping that enough of that still exists in there for Dean to make a run to the store.
Castiel has to squint to see, but there are tiny pinpricks of pen half an inch above the dotted line. Hesitation marks.
“I don’t believe it for a second,” Dean tells Benny over Victor’s death rattle, pointing the neck of his beer bottle at the offending item of clothing. “Andrea has taste. She would never pair a salmon pink shirt with green and brown dinosaur boardshorts.”
in the back of his throat when Cas finally yanks the fly open and gets a hand on Dean’s hard dick through the cotton of his boxers.
No, he and Cas will figure something else out before that happens. They have to. One thing at a time.
So, Dean’s not entirely surprised, but wholly disappointed, when instead of waking him up with a tongue in his ass, Cas wakes him up with an ‘Engineering Analysis Using the Finite Element Method’ textbook to the chest.
“I’ll take it,” Benny mutters, then adds under his breath, “Long as I don’t have to do the purity thing.”
“Beg me,” Cas commands, voice throaty, sounding substantially less controlled than mere moments ago.
He’s not one for guilt, but he actually feels a small twinge of something pluck at his heartstrings. He liked Garth and Charlie. They were good people who tried to be good friends, and they deserved better than to die in an abandoned hotel in the middle of nowhere.
Neither is Dean, for that matter. ‘Cause it’s not like he can’t hold his own in a fight; it’s just that he hasn’t had to in a while.
He must’ve done good though, 'cause Castiel finally eases up and Dean can breathe through the tremors wracking his body. Castiel pumps his fingers in and out a couple of times, adding more lube and a third digit for a couple of mind-numbing thrusts that have Dean twitching uselessly, before he pulls out, leaving Dean empty and open.
Dean tilts his head toward the cameras, because even though it’ll be heavily edited, there’s no way they’ll leave out Novak’s temper tantrums, “I think you’re doing that just fine on your own, Chef.”
Cas’ smile is all for him, stacked six deep with meaning, and Dean’s having a hard time remembering that this is their past and therefore not supposed to be their present. Or future.
Dean side-eyes Benny who – along with Charlie – is staring down at them. Hmm. Yeah. Admittedly, Benny’s hate-boner is for Cas and possibly Dean, but if he’s cool with hurting one of them for whatever reason, then he can’t be trusted with any of them for any reason. Cas’s potentially broken ankle, the cuts, the bruises; someone who can do all that to another person – a
“Mmm,” Cas agrees even though Dean didn’t verbalize anything, his liquid-dark eyes dropping to Dean’s mouth. Heat flares low in Dean’s abdomen and he makes a soft noise in the back of his throat. Cas reaches up to cup Dean’s jaw, the pad of his thumb dragging through the mix of their saliva on Dean’s bottom lip. “I have a surprise for you.”
It’s a good few minutes of midnight static in his brain before he realizes that he’s at the plaza, so he finds an empty bench and hauls his backpack into his lap. Hugging it to his chest, he watches what life looks like around him. On the lawn, couples laugh together on picnic blankets, the very picture of youthful sweetheart eyes, and Dean kind of hates them for it. There’s a trio of frat guys handing out fliers, chanting at passersby, who take the fluorescent paper thrust into their open palms. Multiple students go past, holding baked goods, and Dean’s mouth waters.
Cas’ lungs rattle with the breath he hauls down deep. Again and again, rate picking up, his heart thumping strong and fast again beneath his breastbone.
Before Dean can act on impulse and suck the tip of Cas’ thumb into his mouth, Cas is drawing back, putting distance between them like he knows what’s about to happen and is keen to avoid it at all costs.
Standing over him, she slaps him on the shoulder, and Dean reflexively brings his arms up to shield himself. “You could be putting him in danger, you dumbass! What if he gets caught up in it somehow?”
The problem is this: Cas was in charge of making sure the place was cleaned up, and with him going AWOL, Dean has no idea whether he’s going to find it pristine or full of sex swings, chains, and various other toys.
He takes up his position on the trail, whilst Cas hides in the trees with a small stash of kidnap-murder supplies.
Dean needs to build a bridge and get over it, ‘cause Cas is gonna ask for another roommate or some shit, and Dean doesn’t wanna end up with an unknown quantity. Things might be awkward between them at the moment, but at least Cas ain’t a fucking psycho.
“Brought you back from where?” Dean demands again, unable to not look at the meninges layers saran-wrapped over folds of pale brain.
. Every living, breathing moment, Dean’s thinking about his brother-in-law, completely obsessed, a man possessed. He wakes up from the wisps of his dreams hard and aching, desperate to relive the experience, wanting nothing more than to slide onto his husband’s dick and pretend that it’s his twin. But Jimmy’s tentative touches do nothing except pull Dean out of the fantasy.
It’s both awkward and a relief that it’s now a reality, even if the circumstances aren’t quite the same as in his
Dean drags his lucky Zeppelin shirt on over his head. “Cas, I gotta tell you, buddy. I’m beginning to regret you opening that box.”
Dean draws his fist back, wanting to make sure that the first punch he’s throwing today is a good one. Unfortunately, Nick isn’t as bothered about power as he is speed and in the scant seconds it takes for Dean to load up, Nick pistol whips him in the face hard enough to make him dizzy, allowing Nick to take the advantage, shoving Dean off him and onto his back.
something, he was the only one who stepped up. Who knows what that fucking psychopath would’ve done if Cas hadn’t put a bullet in him when he did?”
Jimmy merely gestures to the painted-red of Dean’s mouth, says, “You’ve got a little something there… yeah, right there. A little to the left… Now it’s gone.”
“Aw, thanks,” Dean coos, laces his fingers through Cas’, brings their joined hands up to his mouth and presses a kiss to Cas’ knuckles. “We would have invited you, but we only want people we actually like there.”
Dean steps closer to Bartholomew and helps him with his shirt, untucking it from his pants. He’s tanned and toned, good-looking, and clearly takes care of himself.
“Cas,” Dean tries again, watching with wide-eyed horror as Castiel accepts the gun from Meg. Castiel pulls back the slide, checking how many bullets are left in the chamber. Two. “What are you doing, man?”
Dean’s about to get the fuck outta here, eyes darting around as he searches for the nearest exit, feet already carrying him there...
He glances up at his husband, with his stupidly blue eyes and date-night waistcoat and all this effort he went to just for Dean (petty burger warfare notwithstanding). Dean picks the aforementioned atrocity up just as the opening notes of the completely-anachronistic-and-therefore-specifically-requested-in-advance
A twig snaps sharply under Benny’s shoe. “You and Cas. I know you guys have history, but c’mon, brother, you can’t be seriously considerin’ goin’ there again. It was unhealthy. I get that you guys loved each other—”
“You here with anyone?” the guy asks. And this close, he’s attractive enough with kind of a Tom-Cruise-Top-Gun-era look, so it’s a double shame that he’s the kind of asswipe that probably thinks that ‘
As Cas hastily shoves the books into his bag, Dean watches, mesmerized by the soft cling of his own shirt on Cas’ body. Dean’s eyes slide downward, to an ass in jeans that are probably too tight to be decent, but like fuck is Dean complaining.
Understandable, then, that Dean was skittish about the gift, the one that Castiel got cold feet about acknowledging when Dean gave him a smile that was tight around the edges.
“This is Dean,” Charlie shouts from the small kitchenette. “He’s over at Spens-Black with a roommate.”
; thick and firm with life-lived muscle and sinew, where Jimmy is slender and willowy. They’re both gorgeous in their own way, of course they are, but Jimmy is the handsome, “I’ll have him home by nine sir,” to Castiel’s hot, “Your son calls me daddy too.”
He wakes up the next morning disappointingly alone. He has Dean’s number, of course, so there’s no way that they won’t be seeing each other again. Especially not after that performance. Castiel is loose-boned and sated and everything aches deliciously. Talking might be a problem for the next few hours, but it was certainly worth it.
Dean’s never loved anyone as much as he loves Cas. Not the brother whose childhood hunger was the driving force behind Dean selling his body, not the father he desperately wanted to emulate as a kid, not the mother who died when he was four and who used to cut up his PB&J sandwiches. Not the husband who showed him kindness, but nothing else.
It was so much more than chasing storms to him though. Having studied meteorology at undergrad, then atmospheric physics at postgrad and PhD level, Castiel’s lifelong ambition was a childhood fascination, turned obsession, turned addiction that had to be quit cold turkey in order to be able to breathe without feeling a crushing, all-consuming weight on his soul.
Of course, Meg is there though. And reluctantly, Dean is kinda glad Cas has at least one other person on his side.
“No? You could’ve fooled me. This is serious, Dean! You can’t just stick your head in the sand and pretend like it isn’t happening.”
As he approaches the pool again, the strip of murky windows reveals nothing but Dean’s moonlit reflection; thank fuck there’s nobody behind him, ‘cause he couldn’t cope with that type of jumpscare, honestly. His heart would probably give out.
Dean tilts his head back on a silent moan, fucking up into Cas’ touch. Which is a mistake because it only gives Cas more access to Dean's skin and he takes advantage fully, sucking a hickey into the hollow of his throat. Dean barely manages to squeak out a shaky, “Why?”
“Cas,” Dean grates, dick slip-skidding through the pool of precome it’s been steadily drooling since they started. “Cas, Cas, please.
Cas straightens back up again, bitchy, with his hands on his hips. “Fine. I won’t look for it, then.”
“Why indeed.” Jimmy smiles serenely, glancing down at the box. Before Dean can stop him, Jimmy strokes his thumb over the gold surface of one of the sides.
Voicing Dean’s thoughts aloud, Cas concedes, “It could have been a lot worse. It’s still rather eerie, though.”
Everyone heaves a relieved sigh at the toilet paper revelation. Dean wasn’t looking forward to accidentally shoving poison ivy up his butt while blindly searching around for something to wipe with.
“Hmm,” Dean says as he drags his hand across the spines of books Cas keeps in here, despite the library only being on the floor above. “I guess there are some serious benefits to being invisible. I can go search out a ladies locker room — or men’s, I guess — stand there and jerk off into a tube sock. But that’s kinda predictable, ain’t it?” Atop one of the shelves close to the door is a super expensive, super ugly porcelain jug-vase-thing that Naomi and the other crooks at City Hall gave Cas last month as a token of their ‘appreciation’ during a posh dinner. Though they may as well have called the entire night a ‘please-don’t-kill-us-for-underestimating-you’ party.
Dean’s response never makes it past his lips. Because in the next second, there’s a sound. A loud, heavy clunk, like a pipe hitting the ground. It comes from upstairs.
The only observation Dean can take solace in is that when Cas climbs out of the car - ‘cause of course, Dean’s watching
Still joined and clinging to each other, chests rising and falling together, Dean’s the first to attempt speech as they recover. “Jesus Christ.”
Dean’s not convinced that Jimmy's convinced by the time he leaves for work, but he does lean in to kiss Dean again right before he goes; something he hasn’t done for at least a year. Dean graciously allows it to happen, because he’s gotta play nice until he and Cas can get the fuck outta here without the neighbors thinking that Dawn of the Dead is happening for real in middle America.
“That it?” Dean asks, so full of false bravado that it’s overspilling. “‘Cause I’ve got a class to get to.”
Holy shit, me too!! I probably shouldn’t be telling you this because I have a Kansas City PO box for a reason, but you seem cool and even if you bludgeon me to death in my sleep now, I’ll at least have read some great books.
Dean doesn’t wanna single anyone out (other than Meg), so instead, he simply tells Cas, “It doesn’t matter. I’m just getting real tired of it. I feel like everyone’s against us all the time. Like we’re pushing back against them every day, just by being together, and it’s exhausting having to keep on defending us to people I thought cared about us.”
? Did you ever think, even for a moment, that Cas made – makes – me happy? That not a welfare concern? Or is it all just to do with what
The door slams shut behind Dean and his attacker, sealing them in, and the darkness and damp smell are stifling in the small changing room. Dean gets bodily shoved against the nearest tiled wall, his back coming into contact hard enough to wind him. In the shadowed gloom, Dean blinks hard to force his eyes to cooperate.
He doesn’t wanna give Meg any more ammunition, even though he’s already pulled the pin on this particular grenade.
Dean suffers from no such affliction, so, behind Cas as he walks in, Dean flashes her the universal gesture for dicks in holes (index finger through the circled thumb and forefinger of the other hand).
Castiel feels a familiar sense of fond exasperation expanding his lungs. Dean steps down into the mud, heedless of the stick-suck of the earth. His jeans have a hole in the knee and the t-shirt that proudly proclaims “Head in the Cumulus” across the broad expanse of his chest has dark patches in the armpits.
His propensity for wielding sporting equipment as weapons (because Dean’s definitely counting the baseball-bat-to-Simon-Weebler's-shins incident) might also be genetic, though admittedly it’s lain dormant in Dean until he met Cas. But now Dean’s eyes have been opened and there’s no denying that household items and sporting equipment are so much more interesting in a fight than a gun.
“Aw,” Dean pouts, sticking out his bottom lip. “I didn’t realize that this was the who-has-it-harder Olympics, because last night? I was busy scrubbing the interior of your ugly ass Beemer because you wanted to leave it until morning to let the blood and brain matter really soak into the upholstery—”
There's a first aid kit in the staff break room. Cas sits Dean down at one of the canteen-style benches, drops down on his haunches, and starts patching Dean up silently; gently dabbing at his wounds with hydrogen peroxide.
“I’m gonna have to get near to him to kill him, Cas,” Dean contends with a sunshine grin. “This will buy us the time we need. He’s gonna call me in -- two minutes and fifty-seven seconds. I’ll hold him off while you get the guns. Then you come back with the weapons all Arnie-like and incapacitate them so I can shoot the both of them in the dicks.”
Jack, bless him, is about as forceful as Coldplay carried on a summer breeze (and is also easily bribed by a rustling packet, like an excitable puppy), so there's not a high chance of
Dean swallows around the lump in his throat. Now that he’s said what he’s been carrying around in his chest like an extra organ, he doesn’t know what else to do. Where to begin what they should’ve started twelve years ago.
image of Cas in his head, instead of the reality of him sitting in the passenger seat with a gun on his thigh.
Realizing that the next set of classes is starting, and therefore the quad is rapidly emptying, Dean turns his rage down a notch, leaves it on a simmering boil. “So apologize. Then get the fuck outta here.” He raises his chin defiantly, hoping that the quiver in his voice is only in his imagination.
Somehow, telling Cas about this makes it seem real. Cas is literally the last person in his small circle of friends to know, but he’s the
Unearthly blue light splinters from the lines of the box, filling the room, the foul stench of sulfur permeating every square inch, until Dean’s on the cusp of retching, turning his face to breathe into the long sleeve of his shirt. A scratching sound starts up, like rats in the walls.
And well, yeah. He probably should’ve at least had a cat-lick wash after Cas went all kindergarten-Van-Gogh on his skin, but he needs something tangible, something to remind himself that this is all real. That’s why, rather than being sane and uncatchable about all this, the shirt Dean yanked on after he’d bagged Bart is the thin layer between what Dean and Cas have done, and the real world.
“Fuck you,” Dean responds, and means it wholeheartedly. Satisfied that he’s covered it, he goes to shove past the guy, but Arthur catches him by the forearm, his grip surprisingly strong, and opens his mouth to speak.
“Yeah, fuck, I can’t remember what the thing is called. He told me about it a while ago. He’d been looking for it in Minsk, then Budapest... Beijing, I think. Istanbul too. Apparently, he found it.”
“It ain’t pretty,” Dean grunts, leaning back to admire his bulky handiwork. “But it should hold until we get help.”
Sure, Dean’s had some pretty crappy Tuesdays — he was once rear-ended by some dick in a semi (too many euphemisms there to keep track of), and there was that time in the bank when he ended up being a hostage during a major heist — but finding out that your husband of twelve years is the parrot in the Monty Python sketch?
Safe to say Dean and his sinfulness ain’t invited, so he’s happy to take advantage of Jimmy’s distraction and the old man’s place while they wait for him to die. Cas hates his dad more than Jimmy hates himself, so
Dean laughs, he can’t help it. And if there’s a touch of hysteria to the high notes, well, then that’s nobody’s business but his own. He rubs hard at his right eye with the heel of his hand. “Yeah,” he sighs, laughter winding down, and if he’s not careful, he’s gonna cry. “Maybe it is.”
“—I know who you are!” Balthazar interrupts, suddenly far too chipper for 3 a.m. But then again, he is in Paris. He was probably up banging some impossibly beautiful chick. Or dude. “Cassie’s told me
There’s probably some in the dryer, but to get there, Dean’ll have to Takeshi’s Castle himself around Amelia.
Stomach full of lead, he moves into Cas’ line of sight, hoping against hope that he hasn’t screwed this up by being a barnacle, clinging for dear life to something far more majestic and complicated and interesting.
Dean has a weird thing for her and somehow it’s his plan to win Dean over by association with a dual sai-wielding assassin with big boobs.
Jimmy loves him. Jimmy thinks the world, the stars, the galaxy, the universe of him. Perhaps that’s what should actually matter; not the fleeting buzz of a physical connection. Dean should be happy. Why can’t he be happy? What’s wrong with him? Why can’t he be satisfied with being loved?
Cas levels a look at him. One that’s usually the precursor to Dean getting laid or torn a new one. He’s hoping for the former, but forever expecting the latter. And of course, it’s this particular comment that Cas picks up on and runs to the goal line with. “I’ve been up since four a.m.”
Before Dean does something dumb like ask the kid out on a date that’ll go nowhere, because he absolutely isn’t Dean’s fucking type (literally), Dean thanks him and turns away, coffee-to-go in his hand.
Cas just raises an eyebrow, doesn’t say anything. He hasn’t since he shot Nick, in fact. Dean would be worried, but he’s a little preoccupied with the pain in his chest.
Balthazar sighs. “When he first came to me to see if I had a bead on where the Lament Configuration — that’s its proper name, by the way — where it might be, he told me that he had a buyer in New York for it. A buyer who was willing to pay him the kind of money you can retire and live comfortably with your paramour on.”
That smug face lights up, and Dean can see the porno movie playing behind the guy’s eyes like a movie theater projection. “Yeah. Yeah, that sounds great.”
Still - and Dean’s open to the possibility that he might be biased here - there’s something to be said for the understated, yet perfect pecan pie, sitting further down on the trestle table, next to what looks like an attempt at a chocolate hedgehog(?)
Infuriatingly, Benny’s grin widens rather than withering as Dean had hoped with his not-at-all-carefully planned attack. “You’re rattled.”
Dean empties his hands onto the bench and begins getting undressed. He rolls up his clothes, sets them down, before picking up his shower stuff and towel.
He can hear Charlie’s smirk down the phone. “That’s your excuse, huh? Sounds like a Weekly World News front page:
On a beautiful day in June, they rent a car and drive down to Lands End beach. They hike along the paved, winding trail for what seems like days, Dean complaining the whole way about how hot it is, until they end up in a cove called Mile Rock. The sand of the beach is a rich golden color and the glassy, blue-green water laps in gently; no big combers. There’s a light, warm summer breeze, taking away the worst of the California heat. From here, they can see the Golden Gate Bridge, and Cas kisses him on the temple, says, “I thought you might like to see a feat of engineering from the comfort of the sand and sea.”
Dean dutifully sits where he’s shoved once Garth has moved, and he’s pleased to notice that Cas does too; their thighs and arms pressed together on the small couch. Of course, a drunk Garth is on Dean’s other side, which does lessen the romantic vibe somewhat.
“--I figured since we’re having a sleepover, we should watch movies, eat takeout and braid each other’s hair,” Charlie’s saying, “It’s what Dean would want. Your hair is too short and perfect as it is though, so this will have to do.”
It’s dark in their room. The only light in the inky blackness comes from a small crack in the curtains that admits a thin slice of artificial white from the streetlamp outside their window.
“Ugh.” Charlie groans, waiting until the bathroom door closes behind him, before adding, “His fucking booty call came around in the early hours.” There’s a knock at the door, which is ignored, ‘cause it’s Benny’s knock. “Let me tell you, if he ever asks you if you want to see his Mr. Fizzles, do
Feeling uneasy for reasons he can’t pinpoint, Dean’s nerves swarm, buzzing loudly in his ears. Benny enters the room first, Dean following right after, sudden anxiety fizzing up like the effervescent tablet in water Benny forced him to drink in between shotgunning coffees.
, the bastard. “I mean, if I didn’t know any better, I’d say we got us the exact sonuvabitch that was committin’ these crimes twenty years ago, but he’s dead.”
In the small back room with its low ceiling and lots of hex and magic, the music is thankfully muffled, the lighting a lot less neon.
out of his husband on occasions when he gets really heated about watercress sandwiches or whatever. Abruptly, there’s a click, and Dean’s eyes open to the sight of the puzzle box in Jimmy’s hands, halfway to being solved, enabling him to slide a part of the box open, revealing new intricacies.
Cas says nothing, but Dean can tell that he’s already making a mental laundry list of ways to make Dean regret his nonsense.
“Yeah,” Dean says on a shaky exhale. “Yeah. Let’s do that.” Waiting until Charlie has started back toward the hotel, he turns around to pluck the photo out of the frame and shoves it into the rear pocket of his jeans.
the guy interrupts, clearly a bit nervous and not used to hitting on random men at bake sales. “I’m kinda new around here and you look like someone worth knowing, so would you be interested in showing me around? We could get a cup of coffee, maybe? But obviously, you’d have to recommend me somewhere, because of the whole being ‘new’ thing…”
I still don’t know your actual address. Plus, I have always favored sharp implements when I commit murder :).
Dean decides to drive by - he’d do it for all of his ridiculously attractive customers, alright - but the place looks the same as always.
When Cas checks out of the hotel room the next morning, he sends Dean a picture of the blue unicorn and the green squirrel sitting together on the pile of pillows.
“Dean?” Cas says, twisting in his seat, dropping his pen when Dean shoves the photo into his hands. “What— Oh. It’s not a bad photo,” he muses, before Dean’s had a chance to let him know the context. He looks up at him, expression open and pure. “You went to the Botanical Garden?”
“This is Cas,” Charlie says, and the ‘nudge-nudge’ in her voice is painfully obvious when she emphasizes, “Dean’s
Maybe if he gets away for a while. Maybe visit Sammy at Stanford or something. Just figure shit out without Cas around, that’s all.
Dean’s almost finished packing up his clothes when he hears a key in the front door. His heart rate picks up. He’d hoped to avoid this fight, just slip out of Cas’ life with a whimper rather than a bang, but that’s never really been their style anyway.
Goddammit, this is harder than it usually is. Every other year they’ve done this, the five of them have flown in from their various states, met up at whatever hotel they’re staying at, and Dean and Cas have been able to pretty much avoid each other for the entire week. Now, though? Now, they have no choice but to actually interact, and judging by the mutual sniping in the car, it’s gonna be a
Castiel doesn’t want to think too hard about why he hopes that Dean hasn’t. He simply shrugs vaguely, unbuckles his seatbelt, and slides gracelessly out of the door he opens.
They stay as close to the shoreline as they can, but the terrain is varied. They tromp through undergrowth, ducking under low branches, circling around brambles and deadfalls and boulders that block their way. They climb down and up the sides of shallow slopes and slabs of rock.
other than driving them into a terrifyingly isolated place in the goddamn mountains, he’s driving them into a terrifyingly isolated place in the goddamn mountains.
“Statistically, most murders occur on a Sunday,” Kevin murmurs off-handedly, like a punctured fact machine, dripping little blobs of
Tyrus catches sight of Gabriel moving to his left, gets distracted momentarily, but then he’s back on Cas and Dean, “You wouldn’t be getting involved - just giving us work to pad our CV.”
. He should probably be a little more sensible, so he rubs at the itch on his jaw, wets his fingers and adds saliva to the blood mix there, making a show of pretending that he’s grossed out by whatever’s caked over his stubble.
And if not, well, he’s seen Cas throw a punch. Dean’ll just have to bear a broken nose and heart for a little while.
“But bears do that, and you love bears, right, Dean?” Cas smarts, deliberately obtuse, and Dean opens his mouth to make an undoubtedly witty retort—something along the lines of ‘maybe if we remove that stick from your ass, we can use it as kindling for the campfire’—when he’s interrupted by Garth stopping the car.
He doesn’t hear a response, so he glances up. Benny nods. Cas uncocks and lowers his gun, but stays by Benny, an unspoken warning as Dean reads.
They’re close enough that Dean’s getting drunk(er) off the alcohol on Benny’s breath, and Dean has a moment to wonder why the secrecy before Benny whispers, “Thought you needed rescuing from there. From everyone.”
Claire rolls her eyes, already over this completely uninteresting, everyday, run-of-the-mill situation where one of her parental units is a fucking revenant. “Whatever. Either way, Dad’s not breathing. Can I have his car?”
Dean doesn’t give him a chance, attempting to shake him off with a vigor usually reserved for huge spiders. “Unless you want
Dean’s pretty sure that Benny’s boss would like what Cas is probably doing to his employee even less, but that’s neither here nor there.
forget poking his head around the bathroom door frame in the posh house Cas was selling and seeing his husband lying there unconscious, surrounded by — and covered in — suspiciously fluorescent puke.
Claire — being the best of both her dads (mostly Cas though) — patiently explains, “No pupillary response, he bleeds black goo instead of blood now, and look—” she none-too-gently pinches the delicate flesh of Cas’ upper arm through his thin t-shirt. Cas just watches her with the kind of apathy he usually reserves for Michael Bay movies or Almond Joy candy bars. “He doesn’t feel pain. Dad’s a zombie.”
. If it weren’t for Cas all those years ago, Dean would’ve gone coo-coo bananas and gotten himself a one-way ticket to the nuthouse.
“Uh,” the guy’s eyes flick from Dean to Cas and back again. He’s clearly confused by this turn of events: going from what he perceived as a sure thing to getting in the middle of whatever
“Give him back and I’ll do whatever you want!” Dean shouts through the door, desperation seizing him. The fifth section of the configuration settles down.
Charlie screams. Hand lowered to his chest, Castiel’s eyes follow the line of a crack in the ceiling, looking for constellations and patterns. He finds a unicorn–
If this is even close to what Dean is worried it might be, then it’s probably safer that they get everybody else clear. Plus Bobby is shooting him a DEFCON level three glare over Sam’s well-defined shoulder and he just is
“Just get me whatever’s on tap,” Dean tells him. Benny grins, fangs out, and makes to head to the bar, but Dean catches him by the upper arm, “The beer tap, not the blood one.”
. He's barely even touched the burger Dean brought him, now that he's finally getting his appetite back.
Castiel feels Dean’s nose graze the curve of his ear, the fine hairs behind it, as they move together smoothly, sinuously. He can feel eyes from across the bar on them, and usually, it would have his cheeks flaming with embarrassment, but now, it just spurs him on. He reaches both arms over his head, hooking one around Dean’s neck. He traces his free hand down Dean’s arm, reaching for Dean’s hand over his hip and pulling it so that it rests low on his stomach.
He’s got a little flashing voicemail icon at the top of his screen, but it’ll most likely be from Sam. He hasn’t called his brother in a while, probably should. Kid is starting to think about colleges — in particular, Stanford — and there’s no doubt that he’d be smart enough to get into any program of his choosing. Could be cool to have him up here for a visit so they can go check out colleges together.
Logically, he knows it’s a copycat, it has to be, but it doesn’t stop quell the uneasiness settling in his stomach next to the alcohol.
“Who knew ghosts had such poor spelling?” Cas mutters archly, flipping the postcard over in his hand.
“Sure,” Dean says, ‘cause he’s not about to look a free beer horse in the mouth. “I’ll have whatever’s on tap. Benny?”
Secondly: Assuming Balthazar is on the up-and-up about the box and not just blowing smoke up Dean’s ass, then where is Cas? Dead? Balthazar said that the box had left a trail of dead bodies, which implies that the box could be linked to them, which to Dean suggests that the box was found with the bodies. Right? So, the fact that he hasn’t found Cas is a good sign. Which brings Dean back to: where is Cas?
Dean stares down at the printed number. It’s somewhere to go, right? Something to do to take his mind off of Cas? The sky is tinged orange with the first traces of dusk, so he should probably make a decision before it gets dark.
It’s vicious and unnecessary and only adds to the bordering-on-cruel sensation of the hard drag of Castiel’s cock
Cas curls his fingers into the waistband of Dean’s pants and yanks them down around his knees, letting them fall the rest of the way to the floor. Dean squeaks, then squeaks again when his bare ass touches down on the cold laminate worktop.
It’s another two minutes and thirty-eight seconds to go until the agreed time, when the outside warehouse door screeches open and
Dean doesn’t lean into the touch like an attention-starved cat, but it’s a close thing. It’s been so long since he’s had someone touch him like this. Jimmy loves him, sure, but he doesn’t want or need him with this kind of ferocity.
They’re pressed so close that Dean can feel the draw of breath into Cas’ lungs, can feel Cas’ heartbeat against his own, picking up speed.
He’s made peace with his demons, even if he’s not yet entirely comfortable with their presence. Cas though, Cas makes the unease settle; makes Dean feel that all of him is capable of being loved,
Dean seizes the opportunity to snatch a win from the jaws of defeat. “So, are you saying that if I ever want to make you feel jealous, all I have to do is make out with Jo?”
“I just came out for a few drinks with the people from work,” Castiel defends. He points at the table where Gabriel and the others are watching. A smirk spreads across Gabriel’s face as he waves back with a saucy wiggle of his fingers.
He concentrates on the library, rather than the prickle under his skin. He watches the students filtering in and out, going about their business like there isn’t a maniac around, sending people gifts and feeling them up in the showers.
“Did you give him the chance? ‘Cause it sounds to me like you just spewed a stream of consciousness at him and then ran away before he could respond.”
He shakes his head, the tremor in his hands traveling to his legs. His heart is pounding so hard that it feels like he’s gonna crack his ribcage. He tries inhaling deeply to calm himself, but his breathing is sharp and shallow; he can’t control it. His vision is darkening around the edges, getting narrower and almost kaleidoscopic. It’s like the whole world is closing in on him.
Screwing your fiance’s identical twin in a heat-of-the-moment decision on your wedding day is one thing (and bad enough), but this is premeditated cheating on his husband.
Dean clears his throat to stop his thoughts wandering, and instead plucks his fingers at the hem of Cas’ heavy shirt. “At least the rain managed to get rid of the blood. This shirt might actually be salvageable.”
Cas follows, wordlessly allowing Dean to lead him to a slatted bench at the end of the garden. He sits and watches with a glazed-over expression as Dean crouches down in front of him in the grass.
Dean slides into the bed, under the covers, Cas’ chest molded to his back. There’s no space between them, nowhere for either of them to go.
Thankfully, there's time for sleep and recuperation in the town car on the way to the airport. Dean still has no idea where they're going and is beginning to think that Cas isn't going to tell him at all, he's just gonna have to infer it from the departures board.
Jimmy Novak is not a curious man. He’s never been one for questioning his faith, which Dean supposes is the very definition of what it means to actually have faith. You don’t know, you just hope like crazy. You trust, you believe.
Raphael is gonna be the next to go. His time has been a little longer coming, but since he’s been feeding info to Nick, they couldn’t just kill him off, ‘cause of course Nick would figure something was up.
Dean licks his lips, barging past every instinct that’s telling him to leave this the hell alone. Whatever it is, it’s not gonna be good, but he needs to be there for his boyfriend, has to show him that he can handle this shit. He puts the words out there carefully. “What happened to them, Cas?”
The sharp point of Cas’ canine catches on the sensitive head of Dean’s dick. A hot shot of adrenaline ricochets up his spine, and Dean gasps, glaring down at his husband, whose lips are curved in a smile as he licks Dean’s cock like a lollipop.
“She was jealous,” Dean tells him, feeling awkward. He rubs hard at his right eye with the heel of his hand. He can hear the humming-bird flutter of his own pulse in his ears.
They’re identical twins, but Cas seems taller, bigger, stronger somehow as he advances on his brother faster than Jimmy can escape. Within seconds, he’s got Jimmy by the throat, the saddle of Cas’ broad palm crushing his windpipe, lifting him inches from the ground. “If it’s any consolation, it’s your blood that brought me back,” Cas says with a serene smile, like he’s considering tearing the petals off of Jimmy to decide whether a cute boy loves him or loves-him-not. “So, I owe you a thanks. Consider us even.
He never considered himself that kind of dumbass. But today is a day for unfortunate revelations apparently, because a group of five friends driving through the middle of the woods is right up there with death by sex and chainsaws in the pantheon of horror cliches.
Worst case scenario? She puts two and two together and comes up with four, despite her workings being wrong. She figures that Dean’s having an affair through Dean’s state of undress, his hurry to the door, his excuse about being in bed, and the suit jacket that she would be right to assume is a) not Jimmy’s and b) not the kind of thing Dean would wear. Best case scenario? She thinks Dean’s an asshole.
“Er,” he starts, chewing on his lower lip. “I’m gonna go to the library before class, so we can talk as we walk, but if not, I’ll catch you tonight?”
An evening of (mostly) silent treatment works. Single-syllable responses to dinner suggestions, one-sided conversation over the gooey lasagne, no acknowledgment of Jimmy’s woeful work tales  —
The more his mind turns over the conversation with Balthazar, the worse it gets, but as he keeps grinding it over and over until his thoughts become dust, two things are simply too large to get through the sieve.
“Then what?” Benny asks. “We go down the mountain? Cas not being able to walk ain’t gonna change with the sunrise, so we’re gonna have to split up then anyways. And even if it’s not dark, the chances are, our stalker is still gonna be here.”
“Well, obviously, I didn’t know that we were going to be burying the container as well,” Cas snaps back.
The shock of the cold water steals the breath from Dean’s lungs all over again as he gracelessly pushes against the resistance. He’s never been a strong swimmer, and now, in the pitch black, he can’t tell which way is up and which way is down. Benny has let him go, but Dean has no idea where the fucker is; if he’s swimming right up behind him, like freakin’ jaws or whether his last hurrah was hauling Dean in.
Jimmy turns in place, surveying the room, gaze sticking on the slim vibrator Cas made Dean come untouched on three times in a row. “Or
As the semester wears on and it gets closer to the anniversary of their murder marriage, Dean starts to take some kind of sick pride in it. Not the murder itself — though it’s worth noting that for a pair of novices, they’ve done pretty well at remaining uncaught, despite campus appeals —  but what it stands for. it’s the one thing Dean has for sure over Meg: she’s never plotted to kill with Cas. Never stood there over the grave of someone who wronged her, with Cas at the other side, staring her down with fuck-me eyes and an inherent promise that nothing would ever harm her.
Dean wishes he didn’t know from personal experience, but as far as he’s concerned, attractiveness is directly inverse to sanity. There are some notable exceptions, but as a rule, if you’re anything to look at, you’re also bugfuck nuts.
?” He sucks the head into his mouth, reveling in Cas’ pleased gasp, the way his knees cinch around Dean’s rib cage, stomach muscles fluttering. Dean traces one of the thick veins from root to ridge with his tongue, watching Cas’ reaction the whole time. It’s gorgeous: Cas panting, breathing uneven, squirming on the bed, head thrown back into the pillows.
“I’ll be whole again soon,” Cas says it like a promise; like he’s chasing Dean’s thoughts down a dark alley and pinning them against a chain-link fence. “I just need your help a little longer. Then we can be together.”
The bell above the diner’s door tinkles when Dean enters the tiny, all-night place, with its checkered floor, gingham half-curtains, and fraying vinyl seats. The whole place has the baked-in scent of grease and onion rings. Earth Angel by the Penguins is playing over the speakers. Each chipped table and booth has its own little jukebox, where if you put a quarter in, you get your choice of five songs. Usually, the songs are queued, but Dean can’t see anybody else in the place, other than the broad-smiled waitress and the hairy-armed cook standing behind her in the server's hatch.
“You’ll have to sit on the desk,” Dean tells him. “Bare-assed or in your damp underwear. Dealer’s choice.”
On the threadbare carpet covering the staircase that curves from the second to third floor, there are old postcards featuring the hotel in its heyday. Most of the blank sides have nothing on them, except for one, which, in a shaky blood-red scrawl, reads, ‘GET OUT WILE YOU STILL CAN.’
But then Castiel Novak came along and Jimmy had to adapt to his entire life being split down the middle. Dean can’t imagine it was easy. Sharing a womb with someone and then your whole existence — your personal space, clothes, CDs. It sucked bad enough that Sam came along when Dean was four. At least he got those few years where he was everything.
“I bought you a little get well gift,” Balthazar said, all aw-shucks-scuffed-toe as he handed Cas a small jute pot with a lavender plant in it.
This could be help, or it could be a mountain hillbilly with a wreath for a family tree, wanting to crack their heads open and enjoy some brain soup.
“Dean?” Cas sounds worried, and Dean’s heart clenches. By Cas’ footsteps, Dean can tell that he’s checking rooms as he goes.
He has effected reanimation in dead animal tissue, therefore conquering the six to twelve-minute rule of brain death.
Claire leans forward in her seat, hands on the salesman’s headrest, menacing in a way that doesn’t take years of practice, just an innate ability to be far too scary for a seventeen-year-old. “—Or what? What will you do, huh?”
She grins, satisfied, and releases him. “Shame, I quite liked him.” Gaze bouncing between the two of them, she adds, “Bet he was thick where it counted.”
Dean tenses, waiting for Benny to start something, but he doesn’t. Instead, he comes to a stop next to Dean, chest rising and falling with his ragged breaths.
He’s meeting Cas at the competition venue. It’s the regional finals and Cas has been killing it so far; building a seamless case, smoothly and effectively cutting through the opposition’s arguments like a Great White through water.
“Woah,” Benny interjects, getting between the two of them like a bouncer, carefully extricating the palette knife from Dean’s grip, “I think you two need a time out.”
He refrains from returning the question, because Dean's scared if Cas answers yes, that his green eyes will turn greener, and if he answers no, then Dean’ll ask him if he’d like to make
“I heard there was one in particular that was kinda bad.” Benny’s still talking, and Dean really couldn’t give less of a fuck, not with the way Cas licks the cream from the corner of his mouth. “Dude ended up in hospital needing stitches.”
Thank Christ the kids are with their moms, though Dean’s hoping Cas will send Balthazar round to check on them anyways, just in case.
. He and Cas wouldn’t be leaning in close, unable to stay out of each other's space even after all these years.
Angered, he tosses his trophy onto the bed. Due to the way Dean’s clothes are piled up, instead of landing squarely, it lands at an angle, and falls to the floor. The glass snaps away from the base with a sickening crunch.
Cas’ hands drop to Dean’s pants, nimble fingers working the button open and zipper down. Dean doesn’t stop him, but he does say, “Let me leave, Cas,” without the necessary conviction.
Which is something Dean’s not gonna look at too closely; otherwise, he’ll drive himself mad. The implication that Cas has fallen this hard and fast for someone before and then grown tired of them is one that makes Dean’s palms sweaty and his heart ache.
It’s not even Dean’s jealousy talking. Well, mostly not. ‘Cause, well, that would be dumb after all these years, wouldn’t it? It’s not his business who Cas is friends with, but Meg… that bitch has always been a pathological pain-in-the-ass. Dean might be fourteen years older and (theoretically) wiser than his college sophomore counterpart, but whenever her name is mentioned, he regresses to that fucking dorm room where he walked in on her sucking face with the love of his life.
, over the past few months. Prying themselves apart was always gonna be crowbar-tough, even though they knew it was coming.
“Cas,” Dean groans, heel skid-slipping through sweat as he tries to urge him to move, do something, other than just savor the moment, ‘cause that’s all well and good, but Dean
Dean follows over pretty much straight away, shaking apart around the orgasm that he didn’t know he needed, slicking his fist and the sheets below with creamy white, all while Cas levels fucked-out praise at Dean’s talented mouth.
Dean has never felt so lucky to have her in his life. After the shit went down with Cas getting shot, he’d gone to her just before they moved, explained as best as he could without telling her everything. Understandably, she’d been skeptical, but after some assurances that nothing like that night would ever happen again - Dean will make damn sure of it - she’d been surprisingly okay with things going back to normal.
Dean doesn’t pull his arm out of Cas’ grip, content for this to be the last time Cas marks him up. “You lied to me, Cas. You’re keeping shit from me.”
“Well?” Cas’ snappish question directed at the other three interrupts Dean’s thought process. “What was so important that you needed to get our attention using the mating call of a howler monkey?”
Jimmy’s eyes widen in shock. Apparently, he’d never considered that these creatures wouldn’t come all this way just to go back empty-handed. “What? No, I didn’t know, I didn’t mean to open the box on purpose. You can just go back wherever you came from—”
This is what Dean's spent every annual meetup since his and Cas' split dreading. Falling back into old holding patterns and being unable to control the person he was when he and Cas were together. That reckless, sociopathic dumbass. He’s cultivated himself, cut it back, caged that part of himself, and now? It’s right there, tucked away in his back pocket, an extra weapon to be wielded when the time comes.
When he gets back to their dorm just after midnight, Cas is curved over his desk, cap of the highlighter pen in his mouth as he drags bright green across the lines in a textbook he paid half a month’s rent for. He looks up when Dean walks in, eyes traveling all over him in a way that always makes Dean feel a squirmy blend of self-conscious and hot under the collar.
It’s all fine and barely dandy, until Dean physically cannot take the jealousy anymore. It burns hot like coal in the pit of his stomach. Dean wants to touch Cas like that, wants to be the only one Cas touches, wants those hands on
Now, of course, he knows that it’s the most alive that he’s ever felt. He’s helping nobody as a weatherman.
be good, so he does as he’s told, watching with increasing curiosity as Cas gathers his supplies: a travel sewing kit, his lighter, a bucket of ice.
Dean sits down in the center of the floor, beneath the unlit bulb, content to exist in the dark for a while. He lets his eyes slip closed, hands on his knees, Cas’ lighter — the one he stole back from Jimmy — resting in the cross of his calves.
Dean carries on, “Also, your other informant, Raphael? Man,” he clicks his tongue, “Dude hated me on sight. Thought that Cas was going soft because of me. I could make a pretty good innuendo there, but I’ll spare us all the mental imagery and leave it at him being wrong too. He’s dead now by the way.”
The shooting stops abruptly, nobody else coming through the door, and with Michael’s gun in hand, Dean swivels on his haunches to face Nick.
“You’re fucking hilarious,” Dean tells the darkness as he fumbles for his shampoo. “Real original.” When he finds the bottle, he turns it upside down and slaps it into his palm a couple of times to get the viscous liquid to come out.
Cas gets into Berkeley’s law school. This time, there’s no wild party — it’s just the two of them; Dean gasping into the pillows, caught on Cas’ dick as his boyfriend victory-fucks him through the mattress, and Dean never wants to stop feeling this way: this safe, this loved.
Meg is here — ostensibly for some other poor law student in Cas’ class that she’s got her claws into — but Dean knows the real reason why she’s showed up, even if Cas doesn’t wanna recognize it.
Cas gestures for Dean to come closer, so Dean drops to a crouch beside him, on the opposite side of Garth so that they have the illusion of privacy whilst Cas whispers in Dean’s ear, “Think about it logically. As you said, you’re the only one of us with survival savvy, which already puts you in the best position to deal with the terrain. But more importantly, you
At the front of the line, Cas halts. Dean approaches, stepping around his friends and over bits of branch and rocks to get to him. And if that ain’t a metaphor for their entire relationship, then Dean doesn’t know what is. “We’re going uphill,” he whispers.
“I’ve killed many angels,” Castiel tells him, impatience growing along with the steady hum of his incredible power. This thing should be terrified, should be crawling on its knees, begging for forgiveness. But it’s not. It’s watching him carefully, not awed, not scared, just… curious.
Castiel just had to force Dean’s fear of his stalker past the point of no return. So he kept pushing and pushing and pushing.
Bracing his weight on his forearm, Cas presses another finger in alongside the first, a smarting burn that blurs into pleasure when he starts fucking them in and out. He’s watching Dean’s face ever so closely, and the angle is cramped and awkward, but it’s by far the hottest thing Dean’s ever experienced.
,” the guy laughs as he pulls her away. Dean hears him say, “You’re insatiable,” as they round the corner into the lobby.
It’s still raining outside and Dean’s always known that theirs isn’t a fairweather love. Theirs is an all-weather, all-terrain kinda love. Cas, who saw him, who saw past the ex-sex worker with ten bucks to his name and realized that Dean was some
“Mr. Winchester,” She’s too shocked to be at her full, bitter, judgy self, brown-almost-black eyes wide and disbelieving as she looks between them, “What on earth--”
The less he knows about this endeavor, the better. That way, when the court-appointed shrink tries to decide whether he’s an insanity case or not, he can say with complete honesty that he did it for love, your honor. Simply went along with it, ‘cause, well, just look at him with a gun in his hand and Dean’s best interests in his heart, isn’t he just the prettiest thing ever?
Dean snorts awake with his face pushed into the curve of Cas’ collarbone, nose smushed and drool everywhere. It’s about as dignified as Dean can expect with the run of luck he’s having. Cas’ body is half-trapped beneath him, all soft, sleep-warm skin, and judging by the even rise and fall of his chest, he’s still asleep.
Cas breaks it to him gently. “We’ll have to gain access to Balthazar’s apartment — without being seen, of course. Pack all of his things up, get them down several flights of stairs — again, without being seen — and dump or burn them somewhere—”
It’s like walking in on some jocks in high school, when you’re a nerdy science kid or something. It rubs Dean the wrong way instantly, raises his hackles, reminds him just how
“I’m all packed up, so I’ll sort out the hotdog water,” he shakily tells the others, as he pushes to his feet, not waiting for any responses.
By that logic, the same force that’s keeping Jimmy on the straight and narrow vis-a-vis his marriage, well, it’s the same force that’s supposed to be keeping Dean in check too. To admit otherwise would be to poke a giant fucking logic hole in the wool over Jimmy’s eyes, which, for a lamb of God? Unacceptable. Impossible. Humans don’t have free will, because if they did, that would mean there’s nobody upstairs watching us.
Another flash right as Jimmy twists to look over his shoulder at Dean. His eyes glitter. “What are you doing?”
(Dean’ll never be able to look at lace again and not get hard - which could make sheer curtain shopping tricky at best and land him on some kind of register at worst).
Often, there’s nothing there. Maybe a homeless person or two. Never anything interesting and certainly not anyone worth pursuing.
“Jesus Christ, fuck no,” Dean spits, only denying the last part, because well, what would be the point in denying the rest when this dude is his last couple of heartbeats away from finding out firsthand? “If that was me, I'd be too busy hunting down the asshole who gave me the moniker and redecorating their office in a pretty shade of entrail red.”
Dean doesn’t beat around the bush, approaching Balthazar with purpose. “Are Cas and I supposed to be going out tonight? Is that why he’s been acting like a little bitch all day?”
“Thank you,” Castiel says and it’s then that Dean notices how tired he looks. He’s still agonizingly beautiful, but there are dark bruises pressed deep beneath his hued eyes, the vibrancy of which somehow seems muted this time around.
“Don’t,” Cas murmurs, kissing Dean’s shoulder blade. “Don’t spiral. I simply meant that I should’ve used protection. I have absolutely no regrets about the rest of it.”
Next to him in the passenger seat, Castiel’s fiancé, Balthazar, gently touches Castiel’s thigh in what is probably supposed to be a comforting gesture, but it does nothing to soothe the growing unease settling in the pit of Castiel’s stomach like a leaden weight.
be a mature adult and menacing gangster when called upon, even though Cas isn’t making it easy to maintain their temporary time-out, what with his semi-successful attempts to slowly and methodically kill Dean with his filthy looks and ass-hugging pants.
"Literally anything that involves you leaving this house," Dean settles on after a moment of deliberation. Sure, there's plenty of crazy shit for them to do inside, but at least the chances of them getting arrested will be reduced. “I am not bailing any one of you out of jail or calling my brother at ass o’clock to come and defend your sorry asses, ‘cause you decided to participate in some zombie—” Jack makes a strangled sound in the back of his throat and Dean sighs, scrubbing a hand over his day-end stubble, “—sorry,
It’s literally the last thing Dean wants to get into. Not when Cas is still out there somewhere, but it’s this or they keep going around in fucking circles whilst Cas is getting his foot eaten by a bear or a cannibal. Benny knew something about what they did, and that’s gotta have some bearing on the situation here.
Now. Crowbars have a lot of uses and as a hunk of steel, it’s pretty easy to imagine that they’d make an effective weapon.
“I’ve been going to this horror movie thing on Tuesdays. Do you—” Dean licks his dry lips, tries not to squirm under the fastidious way Cas tracks the movement. “Do you wanna come with me? Everyone’s really good fun, and this week we’re watching a Rob Zombie double feature; House of 1000 Corpses and then The Devil’s Rejects.”
There’s a couple-inch-thick stack of papers on the edge of Cas’ desk, ‘cause fuck the planet, right? So, in a move that could be seen as either petty pay-attention-to-me behavior or the actions of an environmental activist, Dean shoves the whole lot to the floor.
Somewhere between the anal beads and the morning-breath kisses and the cotton candy, Dean falls in love. He’s probably been in love since the first moment he saw Cas; it’s just taken a while for his brain to catch up.
What they are to each other is less Bonnie and Clyde, and more Bonnie, Clyde, and the guy he was fucking on the side for shits and giggles.
Dean’s sitting on a big-ass pile of counterfeit money, feet a-swinging, when Nick finally turns up at the warehouse, entering cautiously with a couple of missing-link goons behind him, checking around every corner and crevice like the world’s smallest (and shittiest) SWAT team.
Whatever he actually wants to do with Dean, 'cause that's the insane part. Who writes "I'll never let you go" except hair metal bands and psychopaths with bad intentions? What is this guy hoping to get out of it?
He’s gotta get rid of the weapon before the agents catch him with it, and just as he’s about to shoot the final bullet into the goon hunched up into the fetal position on the floor, another gunshot goes off.
If something’s worth doing, it’s worth doing properly, so Castiel puts his foot down on the gas, just a touch, watching the needle tick up to 88, 89, 90, with the kind of bone-deep satisfaction he usually experiences when he files his taxes on January 2nd.
What the actual fuck? Why is this happening? What has he done to deserve this? Why is this maniac fixating on him? He must’ve done
He starts rocking his chair from side to side and Nick turns; his attention sufficiently diverted away from Benny - and the door he’s standing near. Crouched low, Dean moves as quickly as his ancient, creaky knees will let him. He straightens up as soon as he reaches the door and tries the handle.
Jody calls out to them from the doorway, wiping her no-doubt-already-squeaky-clean boots on their welcome mat. Dean could go out there, maybe head her off, ask her to come back later, but one thing he and Jack do have in common is the inability to lie. For Jack, it’s because he flat-out refuses to; for Dean, it’s because he’s kinda bad at it. Mostly around women, because he’s lied passably enough to his brother before. But Jody? Nah. She’ll take one look at him and just
Garth’s bag is in the middle between Charlie’s and Benny’s. He drops down on it and crosses his legs. “This isn’t so bad. We’ve got whiskey; all we need is the Cheetos.”
Cas’ mouth twitches into a smile and Dean knows what’s going to happen even before it does. This time though, he has absolutely zero problem with it.
There’s only one choice left, and it’s the least bad of the bunch. Still kinda (read: super-fucking-holy-shit-balls) bad though and Cas is gonna be
. There’s gotta be a way out of this. Even if the Cenobites really don’t know about Cas’ escape, it’s only a matter of time before they do. And then? They’ll drag Cas back to whatever hell dimension they’ve stepped out from. It’s not definite, ‘cause like Cas said, who knows whether they can chase down escaped prisoners without the usual invitation via puzzle-solving. But it’s not like Dean can ask  —
Even now, he can feel the weight of the other man’s gaze on the side of his face, but Dean continues to ignore him.
Garth appears at his side with some clothes, passes them straight to Dean. “Thanks, man,” Dean says, genuinely grateful. “You know where a couple of my flannels are?”
. Dean returns the favor, catching Cas across the fading, sickly-green bruises on his jaw with a satisfying crack.
Cheeks stained a faint pink, the kid turns his back and sets the coffee machine to work. Dean absolutely, resolutely does not watch his nimble fingers as Cas reaches for a paper cup and sleeve.
Still, soul-deep, profound bond or not, Dean can’t help but tease, "Hey, at least you lasted longer than fifteen seconds this time. Marginally."
Just as he’s thinking about shooting off a text reminding his fiancé - yep, that’ll never get old - that this stupid fucking bake sale was his idea, a body appears in the space next to him, and Dean’s almost hit with a strong sense of deja vu, before he realizes that said body doesn’t smell half as good as the one he’s grown intimate with over the past year.
The third creature, who so far hasn’t spoken — possibly because he can’t — begins to chatter, his wired-open jaw moving frantically.
“Uh-oh,” Charlie says at the same time. “Looks like you don’t have to worry about your lack of shirts after all, Cas. Not much anyways.”
Benny grins and shoves a Tupperware container into Dean’s hands with a little more force than strictly necessary, drawls, “Yep. He’s pretty keen on makin’ a good impression from the off.” He shoots a pointed glare in Cas’ direction and Dean almost laughs, ‘cause if Benny thinks that Dean wasn’t smitten from the very first time he saw Cas - good impression or not - then he’s a bigger idiot than Dean thought.
. The Geneva Convention for sure, ‘cause this is hostile as hell and twice as un-fun. There’s a reason why sleep deprivation is a valid torture technique and right now Dean’s feeling ready to tell any enemy of the state anything they want to know, just so he can get some shuteye.
When they were sending out invitations and Dean asked his fiance for a forwarding address for his brother, Jimmy provided one willingly, giving no indication that he didn’t want Castiel to attend. It’s kind of a dick move. But also a sneaky one. Sneakier than Dean thought Jimmy capable of. It has pinpricks of irritation blooming under his skin like blood in the water.
“Fuck,” Dean mutters, dropping the box and contents on his bed like they’re covered in ants. “Fuck!”
“Oh,” he frowns, and it’s obvious he’s deciding whether or not he can annex the moral high ground here, whether he can claim that Dean owes him a handjob for the price of a beer.
In Dean’s dream, he and Cas are sitting on the same bench where Cas first told him that he had doubts about God's plan. The seal broke, but they saved the town. That seems significant, somehow. “Hey, how 'bout we Krueger you outta here?”
It’s an unspoken challenge to shine a light in the dark corners. One Jimmy thankfully still chooses not to rise to. “Yeah,” he agrees. “Why indeed.”
segment on CNN taken, Dean turns his head to stare at the open door. All he can see beyond it is shadowy gloom.
Dean's pretty sure he could sue for this kind of thing if he wanted to — it’s got to be against at least one law
wanted to go,” Benny blurts, frustrated and ostensibly incredulous at the situation he’s found himself in. “
Amelia, Jimmy’s fellow zealot and longtime, previously long-distance colleague (and the one who seems the most pleased that they’re moving from Chicago to Pontiac), follows Jimmy into the house, not sparing Dean a glance. Which is just
Dean swims to the dock and drags himself out on shaky arms. He flops onto his back with a wet thwap and lies there, staring up at the inky sky, waiting for his breathing to regulate.
He’s not wasting time freezing his ass off, so he reaches for his boots, holding them overhead as he begins to cross to the other side. Halfway across, the water level starts to lower. It uncovers his shoulders, descends his back. When it reaches his waist, he turns around to face Benny. “You coming?”
As Dean follows her to the door, he pulls his cell out of his pocket to check the time. Five-fifty. If Daphne is right, Castiel will be rousing himself in thirty-five minutes.
Castiel tilts his head, squints. There’s nothing judgmental in his scrutiny of Dean, but Dean still squirms all the same.
As they round the corner, Dean almost slips on one of the postcards littered around up here, but Cas catches him by the upper arm at the last second and stops him from getting a face full of ancient carpet.
Dean fights to not react. Because that’s all Jimmy wants, all this is: just a last-minute gamble on the roulette wheel to see if his final chip will come up on eighteen red.
“I made a deal, Dean,” Cas tells him sternly. "We don't know what the empty will do if I attempt to break it." But underneath that steely determination, Dean senses the sorrow, the agony. Cas would never regret giving himself over for Jack, especially not when the kid saved the world, but it doesn’t mean he has to be happy about his own fate.
Cas doesn’t ask which night Dean’s referring to. Instead, he answers, “Not long. Thirty minutes or so. I was thinking about breaking in when you came downstairs.”
Garth looks panic-stricken, like he’s a politician who’s just been asked about rent boys and a suspect trip to the Hamptons. “Uh, yay?”
, Cas gets into his bed. Dean takes the opportunity to steal one final look at his ass before it disappears for the next seven hours, and as usual, it doesn’t disappoint.
Dean blindly shuffles around, arms out in front of him, waiting for his eyes to adjust and hoping that this place isn’t as spiky on the inside as it looks on the outside.
Dean sees her coming though and catches her by the hair, yanking her head back. He kicks her left leg out from underneath her, sending her sprawling backward to the floorboards, knocking the air from her lungs, and making the rotten wood creak like an old ship. Her dark hair fans out around her and her chest heaves, betrayal written in every line of her face.
Cas’ eyes dip. It’s perhaps the first sign of insecurity Dean’s ever seen on him, just a sliver of vulnerability. “You’re willing to kill a fourth now. Someone who means something to you, whether I like it or not. When did finding another body cease to be an option?”
“Don’t shower,” Castiel murmurs, stroking under the curve of Dean’s ass. “I want you to feel my come on your skin when you marry my brother.”
“I think he knew we would end up telling you,” Balthazar adds. “He knows we can’t say no to that kicked puppy look.”
He probably thinks it makes him seem mysterious and cool, but something Dean and Victor’s ex-wives agree on is that it’s actually prime douchebag behavior.
“Really?” Chef Novak asks but it’s not a question. “It’s supposed to be a neat drizzle. Instead, you’ve got aioli all over the place.”
“I love you,” Cas tells him, heartfelt and soul-deep, and Dean swears that time stands still for an entire second. Nothing huge in the grand scheme of things, but Dean sees his life flash in front of his eyes, and it’s a lifetime with Cas.
“It was the formaldehyde,” Dean defends himself against whatever accusation Charlie is trying to level at him. “It made me crave meat.”
“I’m in perfect shape, huh?” Dean taunts, feeling vicious and victorious, punching the side of Ketch’s head through the pillowcase. “Fuck you!”
It takes almost an hour to reach the nicely-kept, two-story colonial. Nothing creepy or vampire-y about it at all, and Dean’s kinda disappointed. He was hoping for at least a gothic mansion with bats in the belfry or some shit. As Daphne steers the car up the half-mile of unpaved road, something occurs to Dean, “Where does Castiel find all these people he sucks?”
Cas huffs a laugh against Dean’s cheek, stuttered drag of stubble and skin, and then they’re trading breaths as Cas murmurs, “Watch your mouth,” right before Dean chases those words with his own lips, licking his way into Cas’ mouth, kissing him deeply.
It’s not quite what they wanted (which is either the opportunity to kill Nick or a gold-plated, artisan reed diffuser - and what the fuck is one of those when it’s at home [Cas insisted it went on the gift list]), but if it results in Nick being dead and their families being safe? Well, yeah. Dean’s 100% on board.
Which seems to be a common reaction amongst his peers. Cas isn’t part of some larger organization - started his own with
It was exhausting, constantly modifying his behavior to mirror whoever he was talking to. He couldn’t work out how other people did it all the time, before he realized that other people
He searches high and low for the curved blade. Underneath their bed, in the nightstand drawers, even outside on the balcony and inside in the adjoining bathroom.
Dean doesn’t say anything. He silently scans over the photos, doing his best to catalog what’s here, what’s missing, and what it all means.
“Garth, are you sure about this?” Charlie asks, squinting up at the windows, sunlight prisming off her bright red hair. “You sure you can’t be persuaded to let us stay somewhere without the creep factor? I’ve heard the Lizzie Borden hotel has vacancies.”
Dean’s made some questionable decisions in his life; he once took on the Big Texan Steak Ranch 72-ounce Steak Challenge, failed, and spent the next seventy-two hours on his bathroom floor. Once, he trusted his brother when he said: “It’s like the prequel to Alien. You’ll really enjoy this movie. It’s gonna be great.”
), Dean decides to join the discussion as an FBI agent. “You said something when you were admitted to the hospital that led the chief of police here to believe you might be a victim of the man we’re trying to find. Do you remember what that was?”
“Unwad your panties,” Claire says, making a show of pocketing the car keys in her leather jacket. And, really? This is where they’re at as a family now?
“Nah,” Dean says, clicking the lock into place behind them and pocketing the key. “Don’t think God’s got much to do with this one, Jimbo.”
Jimmy doesn’t notice, already disappearing back inside and reeling off a series of instructions for Dean to follow so that the souffles rise just like Jesus on the third day.
the correct term,” Jack insists from the foot of the bed, eyes liquid, and the kid has always had a heart too damn big for his chest (fucking
in the right direction, Ketch flops into the shallow grave Dean and Cas dug earlier this morning. Dean peers in, stares down at his-stalker-turned-victim. Ketch’s leg is twisted at a funny angle, and the pillowcase puffs out and sinks as he fights for breath. His chest heaves. His arms and legs are blotchy with red smudges that would turn into bruises if he was gonna live long enough. His skin is scratched, scuffed, gouged, ridged with pale welts, even tinted in places with grass stains. His blue running shorts hang low and crooked below his hips, and Dean can’t help but feel a sick sense of poetic justice for the shower incident.
They’re pressed so close together that Dean’s chest rumbles when Cas speaks, “Fuck yourself on my cock.”
The fact that Dean's life has become the embodiment of Rockwell's 'Somebody's Watching Me' means that anxious studying has given way to just plain old anxiety. He’s suspicious of anyone who walks too close, anyone who smiles at him, wondering if they’re gonna suddenly reveal themselves to be Dean’s very own David McCall.
It’s not actually him who finds it; it’s one of his classmates. Which is at least thirty shades of mortifying, because seriously, dude? He’s getting bolder; the whatever-the-fuck-this-is between them no longer relegated to Dean’s dorm and places that the stalker knows he’s definitely gonna be, like the Botanical Garden or the party.
But then, from the east, a figure comes walking. As they step into the light, Dean sees it’s his jogger and he stops dead in the shadow of a tree, heart pounding in his chest, fingertips bleeding white with the bloodless press of his nails into the soft bark.
Insulted by the implication that what Castiel does is anything less than cleansing the earth, he responds, “I kill those who are immoral.”
Though, he’s not really. Of all the supernatural beings in existence, vampires, succubi-slash-incubi, and sirens are the super kinky, dangerous ones.
Cas does the same, and together, they begin to move it. But in their haste, a half foot or so away from the hole, the container tips over onto its side, and with the flimsy cling wrap being absolutely no barrier at all, Balthazar oozes out onto the ground.
Dean breaks the connection, reaching across Cas for the phone, and mutters, “Ugh,” when he sees who’s calling, turning the display to show Cas. “Speak of the devil and the devil shall appear.”
Cas' mouth and hand slow and Dean knows he's listening intently for what comes next now that he-who-shall-not-be-named has been mentioned.
Jesus Christ, Cas. I thought I fucked up. Very happy to know that I didn’t. I’ll definitely be there tomorrow!
It’s gotta be up there as one of his happiest memories with Cas. Just the simplicity of it, the two of them. It’s so rare that they get the opportunity to simply
He and Dean bought a house together in the most picture-perfect, standard suburb they could find within their price range. They decorated it in muted greens and beiges, feng-shui’d in some nice furniture and purchased appliances with excellent efficiency ratings.
, and Dean doesn't know whether it's 'cause their intense-as-fuck connection is one in seven billion or whether Cas is genuinely just the best fuck of Dean's life.
During dead week, he even considers doing the traditional naked run through the library in order to relieve some stress, but Cas nixes that idea. Probably sensibly.
“You think this is making you sound any less guilty?” Dean demands, trudging onward through the murky shadows. “‘Cause as far as I’m concerned, dude, you’re just laying out your fucking motive right here.”
As well as being (viewed as) boring and reliable, Castiel is also rather socially awkward. It’s not often a problem; the only people he
Closer than Sammy who became a criminal lawyer for the same reason Dean joined the FBI. Sam didn’t get the John Winchester experience in Dolby-Digital-Surround-Sound-4K-Technicolor because Dean shielded his kid brother from the worst of it, and when they escaped, Sam was barely a teenager, whereas Dean was a few months shy of legal adulthood.
Cas is giving him an out. A way to ignore what happened, and the fact that they both know about his pathetic, unrequited crush.
Without moving, Dean can feel the weight of his gun in its holster. He thinks about going for it, but then Castiel is offering him a hand. “How's your head?"
Dean pushes that shit away, locks it down. He can feel sorry for himself tomorrow. When he’s out of this fuckin’ mess and in a safe motel.
?” He jerks his head toward the conference room, “But for now, can we please focus on getting our housekeeper and my brother - your newly minted brother-in-law might I add - out of this mess?”
It’s what Castiel has been waiting months to hear. The thing he wanted most in the world: Dean’s fealty. He doesn’t like to think too much about why that is, but sometimes, the leviathans whisper it to him, insidious and creeping around his vessel like smoke and mirrors.
Dean glances up from his phone. He’s been Googling the hotel he knows Cas was at last, in hopes of tracking him down. The next step is figuring out how to file a missing person’s report in Germany. Maybe get Interpol involved or something. “Huh?”
Dean rubs hard at his right eye with the heel of his hand. Is this actually happening? He reaches up, smudges the lipstick with his forefinger.
He didn’t always go about it in the safest of ways, but at least when he was on his back instead of his feet, he could make his own hours and choose his own clients. He’s not ashamed of it, of the things he had to do, even though it was humiliating many times and stultifyingly boring
There’s not many things in this life that Dean is scared of: flying, somebody eating the last slice of pepperoni pizza, and losing Cas and/or the kids.
They watch her go, and Benny asks, “How’re you doin’, Dean?” as he slides the box of donuts onto the coffee table.
