“Yes, I know. Now If you'll excuse me, I have a perfectly full bottle of brandy at home that seems to be calling my name right now.”
By the time Dean had made the decision, discarding all his clothes, Cas was back on the bed, slotting himself between Dean’s spread legs once again, his own clothes left behind on the bedroom floor. Fuck, he had missed the chance at seeing all of the older man already.
His words are cut-off by the harshness of Cas's deep voice saying, “You thought you might as well use me for your own little project.”
doesn’t leave his body, instead staying there, stretching his body impossibly wider but not wide enough at the same time, that the Omega comes, moaning out in pure rapture.
But she can't help but tack on, "But just a heads up, if you do anything to hurt him, know that I'm pretty good at using a rifle.”
It all left Dean one panting, shaking and flushed mess, but one sharp nip to the space where his shoulder and neck met had him gasping out, a mixture of pain and pleasure taking over as a delicious shiver ran through him, yet at the same time it had him pulling Cas’s mouth away with a slight tug of his hand that was still curled in his hair, the writer moving easily away.
“Dean, where exactly are we?” He heard Cas question as he leaned down so the singer could hear him over the louder noises coming from both the people and machines.
“This meeting should've happened a lot sooner than now, but I'm sure you already know, running this kind of show is a rather monumental task to do.” John says, Castiel slightly surprised that he had offered up the first words of this impending conversation, all things considered.
“Everything, I want everything Cas, want you kissing me, want you pinning me down, want you fucking me until I can’t fucking walk, wanted you inside me for goddamned
The man placed his cup back down, coming to his own conclusion as he responds, “One might think so, Castiel,” the use of the writer's name giving him some illusion of control over the situation, his mind supplying him with any tactic to get him on top once again. But Castiel was unfazed, a name was a name and he didn't give a fuck about the respecting formalities when it wasn't useful to him or duly deserved. The writer could see John's dissatisfaction with the lack of response at his power move, so instead he continued.
As he had been making his way to the back exit, something in his periphery had caught his attention. Castiel couldn't believe his eyes when he saw Dean, sitting in a booth separated from the rest of the others and far enough away from the crowded dance floor that it seemed as if he were sitting in his own little bubble.
Castiel moves the flowers to his other hand and reaches out to shake the pro-offered hand, before something strikes him as strange.
Dean wasn't sure who exactly moved first, but from one second to the next he had the Alpha's mouth pressed to his lips. The kiss started out as tentative feather light brushes of their lips. Cas's being slightly chapped, but the rough feel of his lips moving against his own softer, sensitive ones felt incredible and he couldn't help letting out a strangled moan at the unexpected sensations.
the Omega thinks, letting out a sigh as he straightens out from one of multiple positions he was instructed to do that never failed in making his muscles scream in protest at the unnatural shape his body had to be in for over an hour now. Whoever said modelling was an easy job had clearly never been forced to contort their bodies into what was downright humanly impossible angles and keep it that way until whoever controlled the scene for the day was satisfied with the shots.
“This is so cool!” Dean couldn’t help but exclaim, body vibrating with excitement as he bounced on the balls of his feet, trying to crane his neck up high and prop himself up as his eyes tried to scan the whole arcade all at once. He should probably try harder to get to know the crew members if they chose this place as the ‘team building’ location.
Dean’s brow furrows, not wanting to go down that heavy road and shifting gears before Cas could jump on that ride, “It was the one thing I ever asked of him, and when he said we could, I was so happy Cas. But I hadn’t anticipated how hard everything would be, especially since we set up in a small town, where everyone knew each other since fucking birth and knew all your business to boot.”
He can see the golden strands of his hair peeking out of the blanket, the rest of him tucked securely in the folds of the blanket The Alpha always used when he spent the night in his office. The closed window blinds cast the space in darkness, though it seems Dean has switched on the table lamp at the least, creating a warm, orange glow that allows Castiel to see the soft features of his Omega as he rests.
Castiel can’t help but lowering his own face as he searches out that tantalizing concentrate of his Omega’s scent.
'could finally?'), not liking the implications of them in the least, but he wouldn't push on that, he'd wait until the Omega was ready to talk and he'd be more than willing to listen when that time came.
But just as Cas couldn’t be his home, he couldn’t be Cas’s. Where Cas was a mansion on top of a hill, cold on the outside, but so so warm on the inside, Dean was a deserted, rundown, broken structure barely being kept together, rot and festering mould covering the walls, broken glass windows offering no warmth or protection from the world.
The singer had gotten good at ignoring all the slander that was thrown at him, but there was just something about that one fucking article that had struck a chord in him, that hit too close to home and reaffirmed the thoughts that had slowly started to grow traction over the years, repeating the question over and over; whether he would be anything, anybody without all the fame. Without John. That what if he was just another empty vessel taking up space and air he had no right stealing from someone who deserved it more than he did.
Huffing at Dean's audacity, the female Omega replies scathingly, “Funny, I don't remember asking you, Winchester. Why don't you run along and mind your own business.”
“Hello?” he hears Sam's voice speak out on the other end of the line, heart pitter-pattering in his chest as he takes in the familiar sound.
Looking at his watch, Sam, his personal assistant, grimaced at the time, as he reluctantly answered, “About forty minutes. Sorry, but they need you for a final session, one of the sound guys messed up one of the tracks, so they want to re-do it all.”
There is a beat of silence after that, as everybody absorbs how utterly serious the Alpha is, and the fact that this could be the real deal he was talking about, that if, in the end, this worked out for Castiel like he wanted it to, this was the mating for life kind of territory they were stepping into now.
Initially, the Alpha thought it would actually be easier to confess that he like-liked the Omega, beyond what they shared in the bedroom, but for some reason, it seemed harder, since he had a lot more to lose now that he had a glimpse of just how
It wasn't a very professional set up, but it would make do. They had made a stop at the hardware store to buy some basic amateur equipment, with the Omega only calling a moving service earlier that day to pack up all the furniture that had been in the room, having them take it to a storage unit until he could decide what exactly he had planned for the room, since he was still waffling between leaving it as a guest room or creating a reading room for himself.
There's a challenging under-tone there with his last statement that makes the singer blush slightly, realizing that he must've not been as discreet as he thought he was being whenever he tried to get out of the same room as Cas or making up whatever bullshit excuse he needed to get out of speaking with the man. His evasiveness probably never made his job any easier to do, Dean could admit, still that didn't mean he wanted to be interrogated at the fucking ass-crack of dawn regardless.
Dean can't help but scrunch his nose up at the thought of either of them becoming too busy to hardly see each other, “Anybody ever tell you you're really bad at this whole comforting thing?”
“Fine. You two are terrible by the way. And you better put a word in to Ellen about this,” Dean finally complies as he writes his name down and shoves the sheet back to Garth.
It was also strange, that out of everything, it was this revelation that had finally broken the Omega that night. He had never had anyone’s unconditional support before, never had anyone he could lean on without feeling as if he were burdening them.
But then blue eyes turns on him, Cas's gaze intense and guarded as he says in a monotone voice, “I wasn't under the impression we were actually going to speak to each other.”
The Omega fights the blush he can feel heating up his already flushed face and chest with embarrassment at the wanton way those words makes him sound, even if they were true enough.
“Why were you angry?” Dean asks, his voice gone soft and quiet, as if he were seeing something new to Castiel for the first time and the Alpha supposes he was.
Castiel muses, but he wasn't exactly one to talk about what was supposed to be considered the latest fashion trneds.
The place was buzzing with laughter and the sound of people playing ten-pin bowling as the heavy ceramic balls bounced and glided across the shiny, smoothed out wood, a crashing sound emanating as they knocked over pins. It was like stepping into the night-life of a nineties geek fantasy.
“Yeah, I think I was once, 'long time ago,” the words were something new, something open and unexplored as it drifted and settled into the space between them and Dean knew this was it, this was what he wanted when he showed up at Cas's room that night.
But then, it’s Cas’s voice taking over, his tone wavering and gruff and not at all suited for singing but making Dean’s heart leap and soar and melt as his Alpha sings so quietly, so softly, just for his Omega’s ears only.
As he was wondering what to do with the pie, thinking maybe he should just give it to somebody, his phone buzzes with a message. Unlocking the device and opening up his messenger app, he's surprised to find that it's a text from Cas.
And he could picture it so clearly, how Cas would’ve picked him up, telling him he looked beautiful rather than not compliment him at all, how he would’ve been, if not gentlemanly, then caring and considerate, and slightly awkward still in his growing phase. He would’ve made sure Dean was enjoying himself. And he would’ve seen the longing in Dean’s eyes as the night came to a close, as that stupid fucking
The Omega then makes his way to the dressing table he had sat in front of for his prep work as Jo heads off in the other direction. He sits down in front of the lit-up mirror, looking at his reflection and smiling when an idea pops in his head and he finds himself reaching for his cell phone that he tucked away in the table's drawer before he was called to start.
But Cas seemed to pick up on what he was trying to get out as the words were caught up and mangled before they could make it out of his mouth, responding to the question he was trying to get at, “No, they’re not dead,” there was a beat of silence after that revelation.
“Thank god, that was the last of 'em right?” Dean asked Sam, slumping in exhaustion as the last of the people who had bought the backstage pass tickets had left the meet and greet room. Meeting his fans was always one of the highlights of his job, he could admit that it was awesome getting to interact with the people who liked his music, who appreciated his talent, and yeah he was just vain enough to admit that he enjoyed the praise and adoration his stardom garnered.
Dean’s heart seemed to stutter in his chest at that, Cas’s answer making him brave enough to ask the next question that was lodged and drifting in his mind since he told Cas he didn’t want to stop, “Hey Cas?”
It was strange, he was used to Cas being all broody and quiet, but his silence had never felt anything but natural and comfortable. It had never felt quite like the oppressive sound of nothingness that was rolling off the man right now. Something was bothering him, Dean could tell, but even though he wanted to know what was wrong, he wouldn’t push, not if Cas didn’t want him to.
The slight breeze in the air carried the tell-tale scent of the salty ocean spray, Dean already feeling the damp humidity clinging to his skin, with the soft rolling waves of the ocean enveloping the silence that settled between the two men as they ate.
“Yes, I'll take care of him, don't worry, Jo,” Castiel responds sincerely, with a nod to add to his confirmation.
With a devious smile full of promise, Cas teases, "Mmm, you already have me, I need you to be more specific, my Omega."
A pale imitation of the types of shows his mom had done when she was selling out her own concert tickets, before everything had fallen to ashes at her feet, with all the music slowly drying up, becoming irrelevant. Forgotten. As the bodies slowly faded from the seats of her own once crowded arenas.
Although most of the time their topics of conversation were mundane, he found that with Dean, these were the conversations that were the key to allowing the Alpha to see exactly what type of person he was. And Castiel certainly enjoyed seeing that person come more and more to light with each passing day.
Dean knew he wasn't as good with his words as Cas was, so he decides to just make his confession simple, “I've been thinking about it,
This had forced make-up artists to cover up the slowly fading, but still very much noticeable mating mark, along with all the rest Cas had made the night before Dean had to leave, even as most had all but faded by now much to Dean's dismay when he woke up one morning to find them all healed over, all but for the one still now faintly present on his neck. Dean dreaded the day that too would fade, knowing that temporary mating marks that weren't made with the bite of an Alpha during rut only lasted less than a month without constant attention by said Alpha.
Cas stared down at him, blue eyes intense, but fingers still managing to keep fucking into his hole, not letting Dean forget for a single second that he was going to be balls deep inside him in only a few moments, “Are you sure?”
It was a long time since he hadn’t felt anything but scared and hurt and pain and anxiety and guilt and like his world was crashing around him.
“Yes Dean?” came Cas’s response, his own voice soft as he kept stroking along the singer’s back, cheek resting comfortably on his head.
The more Dean thought about that fact the more he could vouch for this, since alongside being overly conscious about the physical sensations his body went through and the extreme sensitivity that came with his heats, one of the most prominent desires he always had was to know that he was being kept safe and protected. After that first excruciating heat after he came off his suppressants, when it was nothing
But the closest Dean ever got to having this desire fulfilled was by only having his own tired, useless arms encasing his aching body in their loose grip once he was in the privacy of his own home, where he could allow the shivers of his heat, stemming from the need burning like hot liquid through his insides, to finally wash over him, knowing it was better to succumb to the sensations than to fight them whenever he got the chance. Dean always felt slightly ashamed of this deep-seated need, which always made him feel even more alone as he knew it was just another testament to how broken of an Omega he had let himself become with the amount of emotional baggage and insecurities that would no doubt tire any Alpha out soon enough if he ever decided to share his heat with anyone.
the best. He had sensed that Cas was a bit awkward and Dean wasn't any better with how tongue tied he had gotten at the end there, which why he was a bit surprised the man had actually come up to him, the man who was also currently staring down at him, one eyebrow raised in question.
Sighing, Dean nodded his head, mentally preparing himself for what would probably be another few hours in the recording studio as he followed Sam after he put on some clothes.
“Well, if it isn't my favourite little pet,” the dark, sleek stained voice jars Dean out of his musings. He had just gotten done for the day, ready to book it to his hotel sans Jo since she was off making her own contacts around the city and was waiting on the pavement for his company's private car to pick him up since they at least catered for their models and the rest of their crew members to have their own transport whilst in Paris.
The Omega looks up at him, and Castiel is glad to note the sadness seems to all but have vanished from his face, replaced with a curiosity of his own at what Castiel said.
“I can assure you, neither of those options applies,” Cas responded, finally turning around to look straight at Dean.
There had always been a shameful, narcissistic part of him that thought his problems had always been bigger than the next person’s, that his life was so fucking tragic that nobody could ever hope to understand. And he knew it was one of the reasons he pushed Sam away, because what was the point of telling him about all the dark shit swirling around in his mind if there was no way someone like Sam, someone so happy and optimistic and always looking for the fucking silver lining in every situation, could truly get anything about his life.
Castiel’s heart seemed to slow down, pulsing a slower beat along with the suddenly tense moment that stretched on further than what it should have, the only thought in his head being that he ruined everything, again. Only this time going beyond what was fixable, what could be forgotten and brushed off as nothing more than a misstep.
the only words scrambling in his brain along with the sound of the blood he could hear pumping through his skull. He had been struggling to catch his breath for the last twenty minutes but to Dean it seemed like forever since his body felt the clean, easy intake of oxygen, instead of the rapid harshness of the only air that he could manage to get in his lungs like a man starving right now.
It wasn't how he imagined starting this conversation but it was true enough, he had read the articles Sam sent him, and he reluctantly admitted that they were pretty good. Better than all the articles combined written about him and a lot of other public figures at least. Cas had a way of writing that was honest to the bone, words weaved together that praised without being pandering and genuine without being deceptive. It was the type of writing, the type of person, Dean hoped Cas would be with his own story.
Before he could think more on it, before he even knew what he was doing, his hand had made it to that space between Cas’s thighs, first feeling the change in texture from those sparse, soft strands of hair to the rough, wiry, thicker thatch of hair between the man’s legs, and then,
A long-ago memory of a younger him sitting in health class, barely paying much attention to the teacher starts to resurface at his brother’s words, one that makes the Beta’s lips quirk in the irony that out of the two of them,
“Shhh, movie's starting,” Dean says with a wave of a hand, eyes locked onto the screen with unabashed interest and Castiel just shakes his head, thinking he'd never be able to understand people who went crazy for 'cult classics' as Dean so eloquently stated.
But with the effects of the anxiety meds only now wearing off, the numbing side effect still partially present, which made everything a bit foggy, was not an ideal situation to be in when he had to put on a smile and be coherent enough to carry on conversations while talking to people. Dean managed to pull through though, and he was very much ready to just head on over to his hotel room and conk out for the rest of the night.
Being too worked up to bother with more foreplay, on the next grind up of the Omega's hips, Castiel's own hips grind down, plunging himself with one hard thrust inside Dean's ass, making them both groan out loudly at the action, with Dean's hands balling the newspaper beneath him as he grapples for anything to hold onto as the Alpha starts to move sure and fast and hard inside him, hitting his prostate with every slide up and in of his hips.
“Now, Alpha, please, please,” Dean begs, not caring at all that he probably isn’t prepped enough, not for Castiel’s girth.
So for now the Omega was stuck. Both literally and figuratively when it didn't seem likely that Alastair would take the hint when Dean responds with, “The fuck do you want Alastair, I'm not in the mood for your shit tonight,” the words were scathing and angry and Dean felt no remorse at letting the harsh words drip from his tongue. Alastair might have an advantage over him, but like hell was Dean going to even pretend to not be clued up on what he was getting at messing with the Omega as he was.
"Yeah, you better," Dean responds, but the heat in his eyes betrays the petulance in his voice at the prospect of whatever reward Castiel has up his sleeve for the Omega.
With that, Dean pulls himself forcefully out of Michael’s grip, all at once feeling rejected and dirty and feeling like a complete idiot for thinking Michael could have been the one he would have gladly mated and spent the rest of his life with.
Nobody besides Dean called him by that name, “Yes, I'm sorry. I'm not exactly sure what's going on right now, and how do you know who I am?” The Alpha says, cutting to the chase and asking the question he's been waiting to ask since the crew member came up to him, and looking to the place she was standing, Castiel finds that the woman has seemingly vanished into thin air.
Castiel was packing his bags, getting ready to leave this hotel room, not that he had a lot to pack since by now he knew not to get too comfortable. The constant packing and repacking got old pretty quickly, and he wasn't sure how anyone could get used to living like this, a little over a month in and he was already exhausted.
That night had been the worst of them by far, though it wasn't a surprise to him. It was his twenty-sixth birthday today after all, and that one memory had plagued him every year on the exact same day ever since.
The Omega walks in and his eyes scan the space. It seemed to be in an organised kind of chaos, one wall lined from floor to ceiling with a bookshelf, noting how haphazardly books were strewn in the shelves, hands itching to sort them out.
It's the first time Dean doesn't want to shy away from Cas's sharp claws digging in, cold blue eyes probing, wanting to see more, to know more, than what he was being told so freely, and the singer couldn't help but to think that this was exactly what he needed.
Rubbing at his tired eyes, Dean got up and headed to the bathroom, but not before he called in to the hotel room service to bring him up some coffee, thanking all the powers that may be that this hotel's kitchen was open 'round the clock and went on over to the bathroom deciding a hot shower might help loosen up his tense muscles and wake him up a bit more.
“And watching this was one of these adventures?” The Omega prods, his voice bringing the Alpha out of his nostalgic thoughts, “Yes, it probably sounds absurd to you, but we were never the movie-going type people and we planned on doing things we never tried before. We had a cinema that played mainly older movies, and this happened to be one of them, although, Gabriel, having bought the place out of all their candy, couldn't sit still for longer than a minute, so we gave up on ever going to watch another show after that. " Looking to the Omega, Cas tacks on, "Thought with different company, I could experience it with somebody who'd enjoy the actual show, and not just the snacks.”
“Yeah, turns out there's perks to dating the guy in charge’s brother. Gabe scheduled me to have the second shoot slot, and the group session was our first one, so I'm pretty much done for the day, thank god. I just gotta get changed real quick, then we can head out.”
Once Cas looks as comfortable as he can get, he spreads his legs and finally focuses his attention back on the Omega, his hand stretched out for Dean to take as he motions the Omega closer.
Castiel would never be more grateful to his brother than the day Gabriel had come blazing into that God forsaken place to come and get him out of there, the young Alpha hardly remembering how he had managed that, seeing as he was as drugged up on whatever neutralizing medications they had tested out on him to see which was the right ‘fit’ for his body.
Castiel soon pulled out, Dean’s body still spasming from the aftershocks of his pleasure. He twisted the singer’s body around, lying him flat on his back instead, mindful of the wet spot next to him. He ripped the condom off of his achingly hard and swollen shaft, discarding it as he knee crawled up the bed, stroking his cock as he positioned himself right by Dean’s slightly parted lips, green eyes staring up at him all the while.
Dean thought about that for a moment. He thought about ending it here, going back to their rooms and calling it a night. But before he even realized he had made a decision he was shaking his head at the absurdity of stopping now.
And that was exactly why he was the first to move, turning his head away, feet taking a notable step back, hand coming up to brush against his lips, to feel the phantom of a kiss that never happened as his heart beat steadily in his chest, nerve endings pulsating with the on-coming storm of desire he didn’t think he was ready to feel.
But that was all it ever was, an image, an idea of a mother he had missed, had lost and wanted desperately to find again. And after, when the cracked, dirty wooden door of her home had slammed shut in his face, as he wondered the cold streets that night, having nowhere to go, he realized he had already found a mother in the form of a sweet, gentle old lady who had taken in the messed up teenager he was and really tried harder than any person before to change his life.
closer until he's right in Dean's space, standing chest to chest so he's able to scent the pungent smell of his breathe fanning over his face, Alastair's voice drops into a deep menacing tone that should be funny but really isn't as he says, “You think you're better than me? You think you're all that, being world's above the likes of me? You think I'm spiteful, a pest?” After each uttered question, the Beta's fingers just seem to tighten until the Omega can't actually move, trapped by his hands and the look of utter evil in his eyes, which until now Dean had never seen the exact extent of before. And for the first time since he met the man, he was truly frightened of him, even as the jarring thought makes him feel ashamed for being so weak.
And with those thoughts of heats and ruts and claiming flitting through in his mind, Dean lets out a strangled moan as his orgasm bears down on him, the sloppy sounds of the Alpha still moving inside his even slicker hole stimulating him even more as he feels a final wash of come and slick spurting out of him.
It occurred to him then that maybe the shirt idea wasn’t so bright, considering Cas wore his coat over everything, that above anything making him stand out more. And he also knew a part of the reason why he wore the coat was because of its huge pockets, hiding the pen and book and whatever else Cas carried around all day that he needed.
Turning around himself, the Alpha finally lays eyes on the man he had last seen a little over three months ago and who had somehow managed to capture his attention almost a year ago.
At this point, seeing he probably won't get much out of the Omega, Castiel turns toward Jo instead, “What's wrong with him?”
“Okay then, now that that's out of the way, introduce me to this friend of yours,” Ellen commands, as her attention is now directed solely on the Alpha standing quietly next to Dean.
Not wanting the writer to ask for any more details on the exact logistics of how he got that right, he swiftly moves on to the second item he shoved into Cas’s arms, the man expecting the shirt, quirking a brow at the gold and silver font at the back reading ‘Dean Winchester: World Tour’ with the words, ‘Crew Member’ written in smaller print on the front left chest side.
There had been no messy dark curls that Cas couldn't bother to tame down. And there had been no deep, cool, cerulean blue eyes trailing Dean across the room when he thought the singer wasn't paying attention.
“I agree, I haven't been here at night before, but it's one of my favourite hiking trails, so I end up here often after I come down fro the trails.”
The Omega had considered to just get some painters to do the room for him when he couldn't decide whether he wanted to do a simple wallpaper design or not, but whilst he had been searching online to find some inspiration, he had come across a video of someone throwing different shades of paint on their walls, and had liked the idea of doing that with one of the walls of the room, while leaving all the others the same white shade they were.
He always thought that he had exhausted himself out of all the hope he had left in his lifetime, his experiences sucking and seeping it all like a monster feasting as it took and took and took until he was left empty and faithless.
Dean sat there, feeling his lips push up in a self-deprecating smirk at his words, knowing somewhere deep down he always wondered whether he was just a project she took on out of pity. Lisa had always been the type of person who wanted everyone around her to be happy and content, and didn't mind putting in the work if they needed that push.
“Cassie has some supervision work he’s doing in the lab with a few of our postgraduates, so he’ll probably be another hour, maybe a little longer since their sessions always go over time, I hadn’t anticipated you’d arrive so soon,” Hannah says, breaking Dean out his thoughts as he tears his green eyes away from where they had been staring at the Alpha.
He rested his head back against the couch cushion, looking up at his white ceiling, his brow furrowed as he tried to make sense of what was happening to him, even though he had just wanted to drop the whole thing and never have them speaking about it again, though it seemed his brother had other ideas.
Lord knew nobody dared question John Winchester when it came to his son. The guy had ruined more than one person's career when they dared to do just that, either directly or by trying to sell their stories to reporters who were all starving for anything they could get when it came to twenty-two year old star-singer Dean Winchester. John only ever allowed news of his son's life to leak that he deemed would fit his image or add to his stardom, nothing more, nothing less.
Although, he shouldn't be as surprised, if Castiel could pin any character trait of Crowley's down, it was his sly, secretive way of always knowing things that Castiel had no way of explaining how he even got the information in the first place, least of all
“Uhm, no thanks, I think me and Cas are just gonna hang around for a while. Maybe later though.” Realizing it gave the wrong impression that he was practically speaking for Cas, Dean quickly followed that by turning to Cas and asking, “Unless ya wanna go do some bowling, we can totally do that too, or you can and I’ll just hang back, whatever works for you is fine by me. It’s your birthday after all.”
It was funny, the voice in his head started sounding less like himself and more like his dad each day.
He had thought he loved his mother, but how could he really, truly say that? She was a stranger to him now and perhaps then too, somebody he barely knew. After he had met her all those years ago, she had shattered him.
He was fucking green with envious jealously at whoever Dean was thinking about when he said what he did. Still, didn't mean he had to acknowledge them in any way, shape or form, which is exactly what he did.
“Take off your clothes Dean,” Cas ordered, his voice so gruff and deep the singer didn’t think twice before he started unbuttoning his jeans, though pausing a second when he unzipped his hoodie, thinking, for the first time that night about those gashed, ugly scars marring his forearms, the other, smaller, less visible ones littering his body too. But the room was dark, far too dark for Dean to even make out the colour of Cas’s eyes, and the knowledge of that, of Cas not being able to see them, alleviated some of the anxiety that had slowly started bubbling up inside him.
“Oh, you're awake. That's good, I thought I would have had to call Jo up to make sure it was normal for you to sleep this long,” the Alpha says nonchalantly as he walks up to the bed, placing the water and pill bottle, that Dean now can see is just plain old ibuprofen, on the night stand, before he leans down, placing a hand on Dean's cheek and surprising him with a kiss to the forehead.
It was strange, this sudden realization, this epiphany, that loving somebody wasn’t the worst thing that could happen to him, that he wasn’t rendered weak and helpless and incapable by not holding it all inside himself.
this time, someone more worthy of that image he still loved and held so dearly to his heart, no matter how deep deep deep down he had buried the notion of ever having a mother who loved him.
There are a flurry of people; models in different states of undress from what he can tell, and other people mulling around them trying to get said models in their outfits, whilst some of them were busy getting their make-up done in one section, with a variety of crew members moving equipment and props about. While the Alpha could admit that the photographs, stemming from his brother's eccentric style, were always impressive, the bombarding of the various amounts of outrageous props and colour splashed all about the white washed back-ground only served to over-stimulate his senses, something which would result in him forming one massive headache the longer he stayed in the brightly lit and colourful space.
And with that, Gabriel went back to his station, not giving Castiel so much as the opportunity to decline his invitation.
Before Sam can even try and salvage what is left from the, admittedly, horrible conversation, the next thing he hears is a beep, before the line cuts off, the Alpha looking at the cell only to see the
Walking on the soft, green, probably synthetic, grass, the singer could see that the square pool was definitely the main attraction of the space as it dominated the area, the water rolling in soft crests as the morning breeze swayed the calm, clear waters. There were also potted plants scattered around, the long leaves spilling over in their concrete fixtures with brown, woven hammocks and pool loungers just adding to the tropical aesthetic he knew they were aiming at. But besides the appreciative cursory glance Dean wasn't interested in the look of the place, he just wanted his view and when he saw that there were a few benches along the outskirts, which faced away from the pool toward the outside his feet seemed to automatically carry him to one of those benches.
“Yeah, yeah, whatever,” is Dean's last response as the limo finally pulls into the underground parking garage of the hotel, hoping it didn’t look too obvious how fucking eager he was to go and check up on the writer.
Like he always dreamed he would be when this was all over. He just had to stick it out until then and not do anything stupid in the meantime.
After that, conversations between them had suddenly dried up to the bare minimum of discussing Dean's schedule and interviews and a strange part of himself couldn't help but feel thankful that maybe, all this would just mean that the final blow wouldn't be so hard for Sam to take the second time around, the knowledge consoling him, knowing deep down that this fucked up situation was all for the better in the end.
at the joke, the sound carrying through the studio until some curious heads turn in their direction, the singer trying to cover up his smile and his laugh by placing a hand in front of his mouth.
It should’ve been a much softer and slower coming together of their bodies, should’ve been gentle and loving and it probably shouldn’t have been anything like what it was right then. Hard and fast and almost
It started out with him being at Gabriel's studio from time to time, but then Dean had spotted him at a few of the events that Gabriel had photographed for and he had modelled in.
Castiel wants to deny it, wants to say his brother was wrong, but something inside him perks up at what the Beta is saying, a deep hidden part of himself suddenly standing at attention. But the Alpha still feels that bite of apprehension clawing its way up his throat as he stares into the gold liquid swirling in his cup, “Even if what you’re saying
Scoffing as he straightened up, John replied, “'Course I didn't say no, don't be fucking stupid Dean, this is
with someone just as spoiled and narcissistic as those brats, someone who probably wouldn't be able to handle the writer running his mouth at his lifestyle choices. But he also knew that he wasn't being very fair and should probably give the guy a chance too, although Castiel didn't have much hope that they would get along regardless.
He never once blamed Sam for wanting to leave, for wanting better than his drunk of a father and failure of a brother. Dean had wanted the same for his brother, knew someone like him deserved a better life than this, which was why he had slowly been saving up whatever extra cash he had so Sam could go to Stanford when his early acceptance letter came. He knew at the rate he had been going it wouldn't have been enough, but it never stopped him from trying. In the end, he had just never anticipated that maybe
“I think we should break up,” were the last words Dean was expecting from Michael, the Alpha he had been going out with for the past six months.
Castiel tried to evade the man as much as possible, but that was hard when it seemed as if he were attached to his son's side, a constant shadow that watched over his every move. That in itself intrigued the writer, but he also supposed it could be played off as a protective parent just concerned about their child in the crazy world of showbiz Dean had been swept up in. But there was just something off about the way he interacted with and watched Dean that wrangled his senses and Castiel stored the information away for now.
It was strange too; he had never before felt this close to his Alpha side, not outside of a rut anyway. But it was as if he could feel those age-old instincts right there at the surface of his being, often coming out when his frustrations would build or when he thought too long and hard about the possibility of booking his own flight ticket to go out and see the Omega and stop this foolish school-boy pining and take action. And he could swear he never before felt the torrent of this kind of impulsive behavior pumping those possessive hormones through his blood making it seem as if the Alpha in him was prowling and clawing at his insides, demanding he give in for a change by letting go of his tightly held control and hunt down his green-eyed Omega. Giving chase in an imitation of the now antiquated tradition of when Alphas had to hunt down their chosen Omegas who were on the run, making sure their suitors were worthy and virile and had the strength to protect and possess them.
” Castiel interrupts, because he was pretty sure he had heard wrong, and if he didn't, well then, he was pretty sure he was going to throw up from what felt like wasps swarming around in his gut.
To be honest, he quite liked how domestic it all was, even though he and Dean still had a long way to go in getting to know each other. He hadn't failed to notice that Dean put up a front whenever they ventured into their personal lives or deterred conversation about his family or even his job sometimes, whenever the Alpha asked if he wanted to talk about it when he could see the Omega looking pretty worn and stressed out.
“Well that was a disaster. Not exactly what I pictured when I said to pursue and woo him, ya know.” Gabriel says, rather
He's the first one to break the silence, crossing his arms and lowering his eyebrows in annoyance when he sees that she isn't going to leave anytime soon, and answers the offer for Cas, “No thanks, he's not interested.”
It's only once they're in the car when Dean asks, “So, I'm curious, where're we off to next, Alpha?”
And finally, there he is, face-to-face with the young man who had stolen his heart and took it with him when he had left, missing the fan of those dark, long lashes, those freckles dotting his nose and cheeks, those bowed, pink-stained lips, now slightly parted as the Omega rests.
Whipping his head to the left he was surprised to find it was Cas standing in front of him. This was the last place he'd imagine the Alpha to be on a Saturday night, that was for sure.
With the smile still firmly on his face, actual concern that he might not be able to get rid of it before his muscles really start to cramp up, Dean looks up at Cas and teases, “Don't forget, you promised me a reward for this. Can't believe you and Garth ganged up on me like that.”
Settling back a bit, but not leaning all the way into Cas quite yet, feeling the heat of Cas's body and his legs moving inward to trap the Omega more firmly between his strong thighs, Dean has to admit this was a pretty great idea and he says as much, “Yeah, okay, you win, this is pretty nice Cas. So what you got in your little basket there Alpha?”
“Well, my son still has a lot to learn from his old man. Dean, he gets too easily riled up, fixating on the littlest things and making them seem like the end of his world. But as a father, I do my best to help him out, even sent him to see some doctors, and they got him on some much needed prescriptions that I think are helping him tremendously.” John's words seemed to tumble out, his wounded pride being soothed over by deflecting Castiel's subtle criticism away from him and onto Dean.
When they finally get to the car, Castiel unconsciously opens Dean's door for him, and when he immediately realizes what he's doing, the Alpha very much starts to over-think the action as the Omega raises his eyebrow at the Alpha.
There was a definite difference in the atmosphere about them tonight, Castiel can tell. Admittedly, while that did include a nervous and slightly awkward energy swirling between the Alpha and Omega as they made their silent trip back to Castiel's car, neither knowing what to say as this was relatively new territory they're finding themselves in together, there was also an undercurrent of excitement and thrill mixed in with anticipation that balanced those rather hindering feelings out, making it seem not so bad as they both knew this was the start of something wholly new to their dynamic.
Please do not take offence, at the end of the day I myself know this is just a single fic in a sea of hundreds and thousands and you are welcome to read something else that you'd feel more comfortable with. I am just humbled that people have even chosen to click on my work and gave it a go.
He could be the ear-piece for a few hours, he couldn’t give much back to Cas for all he’s done for him, but he could give him this.
“Wait, what?” Dean is so lost, sometimes he couldn't keep up with Cas's multi-tracked mind switching so abruptly from one topic to the next.
“My, my, my. Could it perhaps have something to do with whoever it is our Castiel here has started dating?” Crowley adds matter of fact.
It was the first concert of his world tour, and it was decidedly not going well. Usually Dean had a better handle on his nerves when it came to his performances, but this was one of the biggest sold-out shows he had ever had, and the moment he heard the screams and shouts from the tens of thousands of people who filled the stadium seats from where he was backstage, the thought of going out there and becoming the sole focus of all that attention, having all those eyes watching and judging, hanging onto every word he said and seeing every action he made on the large mounted screens on either side of the stage made his brain short circuit, while simultaneously making his lungs feel as if they were collapsing in on themselves.
He's glad when all Dean does is just snort and shake his at the Alpha, not questioning his motives as he simply says, “Clearly,” and proceeds to get in the car without much fanfare.
Before the Alpha makes it out the door, Dean pops his head out of his little nest, “Thanks, Hannah, I owe you one,” he says, smiling at her before he can’t help but burying his head once again in the blanket, before the tendrils of sleep can overtake him he thinks he hears a soft, “Sleep well, Omega.”
, the real him and not just some well constructed idea of who he was supposed to be. And with the way things stood right now, he was just a puppet whose strings were being pulled by somebody else's hands, doomed to remain unknowable and unseen if he didn't do something.
Of course this kind of shoot was right up the Beta's alley, it was just crazy and weird enough a theme to pass his standards, but looking around at all the other food-inspired outfits the other models were wearing, which were just as bad as his (Dean cringing internally when he sees one of them actually having on a bright, fuchsia green avocado looking monstrosity that pretty much drowned the entire body of the mode wearing it) the Omega wonders how exactly Gabriel could possibly pull something like this off by making it look good. He clearly had his work cut out for him, that was for sure.
When they finally get through the threshold of the Alpha's house, Cas immediately backs him up so that the Omega was trapped between the door and the Alpha's hard body.
Getting back on track, that line of thinking too much for him to even consider especially this evening, he continues "I didn't understand any of their motives though, how could they not see they were becoming the very thing they were fighting against? I was so angry at the way they thought about us, that the most logical thing for me to do at the time, no matter how stupid it sounds now, was to become the monster mo-
They were ten minutes away from the hotel, Dean lost in his own thoughts when Sam, unexpectedly opened his mouth, “You going up to see Castiel? Strange though, haven't seen him all day.”
“No it isn't, seems I stand corrected,” the Alpha nods in assent but then smirks before he adds on, “
Castiel was too shocked to react straight away; the kiss not registering to his slowed down, confused and frazzled brain cells. Strangely, it wasn’t the feel of soft lips brushing over his in a chaste kiss that broke him from his stupor, instead it was the feel of Dean’s arms coming up to wrap around his neck, gentle, but firm fingers carding through the small hairs on the nape of his neck, the unexpected touch inducing a swift, desire fuelled sensation to course throughout his body, only to be followed by the feel of all of Dean as his whole body came into contact with Castiel’s own, pressing himself flush against the writer.
Like Dean, he wasn't ready to tell the Omega his own sad teenage home-life story, but staring at the green eyes that were peering at his own blue ones, at the patience and complete acceptance he found in those depths, he decides to at least give some sort of vague explanation, knowing it wasn't the time or place to spill the whole can of worms.
The moment Castiel had stepped into his home that night, he knew something wasn’t right, and when he involuntary took a breath in, hoping to scent that sweet apple and spice essence of his chosen mate that he had made sure lingered on every surface the days before his Omega left (as well as making sure
Seeming to find what she was looking for as she gazed at him, Hannah tells him, "If you think what you could have with him is worth the risk, and if you think he is really,
Dean navigates his way through the crowd of people and around a few tables to the place he saw Cas move when he was up on stage, the bar slowly becoming more packed as the night wears on.
, “We can still hook up, this doesn’t have to be the last time we see each other. I mean, you might not be the best mate-material for me, but I wouldn’t mind getting tangled in the sheets with you, we never actually got to the real good stuff.”
There was a tenderness to the moment, to the action of Dean’s hand cupping his cheek as his thumb stroked along the harsh planes of his face, applying pressure to the back of Cas’s head so he could lean down more, closing his eyes as their foreheads touched.
Finally, his body gives under the force and pressure as his rim is stretched a little wider, the Omega wailing out loud as he is consumed by his Alpha even more, but it’s when Castiel bends down, pressing his cock in and in and in, rolling his hips in short, fast thrusts as that
Soon enough, their mouths are crashing against each other, Dean’s plump lips running over his chapped ones, the Alpha’s hand moving up to cup his Omega’s face as his thumb snakes to the corner of his mouth, prodding gently as he coaxes those sinful lips to open up so Castiel can plunge his tongue inside his Omega, utterly lost in the flavour of his intended.
They were in Cas’s home, Dean’s head resting on the Alpha’s knee, something they had done so often it was like second nature when they had migrated to the lounge from the quick dinner they ate in the kitchen.
Castiel had no idea what it was that he was supposed to be doing though, and as they reached his door, he still had none.
It was the only barely-coherent thought Castiel could manifest as they kissed and kissed and kissed, right there in the middle of the passageway, neither one caring at all, even though they definitely should’ve.
Startled, the Omega turns around abruptly, having not heard anyone approaching him and thinking he was one of the only people who must still be in the whole goddamn building with how quiet everything was.
“Uhm, yeah, so that was it really. I mean ya don’t have to wear the shirts if ya don’t want to, I just thought…well anyway, maybe it wasn’t such a good id-”
As the Omega takes in all that surrounds them, awestruck at how beautiful the place lookes, he doesn't even notice the Alpha taking a legless, fold-up chair and blanket from one of the employees stationed at the out-door theatre until he feels Cas extricate his hand from Dean's to take the items in hand as he places the blanket under the handle of the basket.
Dean was an enigma, contradictions within contradictions, and Castiel couldn't deny that he wasn't already interested to see where this potential story could go, he just didn't know what to make of the thoughts that took a personal investment into the singer, thoughts that wanted to know the who's and whys and whats and hows of the man sitting in front of him beyond their use for the printed black inked words of a cover story.
Turning back around, he looked on at Dean's hunched in shoulders, his head titled down and hands grabbing hold of the edges of his mattress. And Sam could understand why he looked so tense. Recording sessions with his dad in the booth always made him more nervous, more on edge than he normally would be if it were just the regular crew working with him. But John expected his son to be perfect, and if he wasn't, or if he found the tiniest imperfection in his vocals, it only meant longer sessions and sleepless nights for the singer until the man was finally satisfied.
“What’re ya doing Cas?” Dean questions as he sees Cas making his way over to his phone that he had left by the Bluetooth speakers in the corner of the room when the Alpha had set up some music for them.
He was surprised to find that Dean was almost as big of a nerd as Charlie was when it came to comics and movies when he seemed practically scandalized when Castiel mentioned he hadn't seen most of the movies Dean was talking about. But there were other, more subtle things that the Alpha noticed about the Omega, like the fact that, despite his occupation and the certain degree of confidence he thought must have come with doing what he did, Dean was extremely self-conscious and shy at times, and it became explicitly apparent to Castiel whenever he complimented the Omega. He also discovered how truly loyal Dean was, almost to a fault when it came to the people close to him, the Omega seemed to always trump their needs over his own, coming through with how easily he praised his brother and it was clear that Dean felt a level of responsibility for him that was more parent-like than the usual role of older sibling, and that alone went a long way in the Alpha respecting him, since he could see the similarities in the relationship he and Gabriel shared. It was all these little pieces of information that made him all the more determined to seek out every facet he could about Dean, until everything that the Omega ever was and is would be laid bare in front of Castiel.
“Since we're so close to the top of the mountain it's a lot colder up here and besides, I thought you would enjoy the extra layering since you do run a little colder than normal.” The Alpha notes, having observed this quirk whenever Dean had been bundled up in layers of clothing, even when it was ninety degrees out.
He caresses the side of Dean's face and cards the few damp strands of his hair by his temple back, his whole being seeming to focus in on the Omega, not even registering Jo's presence, least of all what she is saying, as he whispers in a low, gentle voice, “Hey, sweetheart, not feeling so good, huh?”
It was cheesy as heck, but fuck, his Alpha could be romantic, and Dean’s heart ached as he felt tears prickle his eyes at the sweetness of the gesture, a distant part of himself mourning for a younger version of himself that had spent all the meagre extra money he had on a rental suite that never even fit properly but that he had been so happy to wear, having shop lifted some blush and red chapstick and eyeshadow so he could look pretty for his date. Only to come home to a drunk father who had wailed on him as he took in the debauched form of his Omega son.
about what Dean thinks of him, that in all their interactions, he cared about not hurting his feelings with his sharp tongue and unfiltered thoughts. That each and every time he had at least tried to smooth things over, something he never bothered to do with other people.
“Well, then you can just enjoy all the free alcohol, maybe?” Turning in the leather seat that she occupied across from him, the Alpha gave Dean a pleading look, “Please Dean, just do this for me, okay? There's a lot I can get you out of, but at the end of the day, you
The mark was all the woman had to see to accept that the Alpha wasn't up for grabs, seemed she and the girls had to find a new playmate to wager over, and with a flip of her hair over her shoulder, she walks away in as dignified a way as she could in the frilly yellow gown she had on that was patterned to look a lot like scrambled eggs and bacon.
It wasn't exactly the emotional ups and downs he usually felt during his pre-heat stage, they felt bigger, and more stifling and suffocating. Dean would've in fact preferred if it was simply a matter of him going into heat (although, that wouldn't happen for another month or so), since it never made him feel this much on edge. He had had shoots and shows scheduled whilst he was practically in the middle of a full-blown heat before, as in most cases they weren't as all-consuming and mind jarring as people made them out to be. Omegas' heats and Alphas' ruts usually narrowed down to a heightened chemical and hormonal imbalance of their secondary gender characteristics vying for control over their primary ones, with Betas' being a little more complex than that since they showed fewer internal changes in their neutrality, and experienced states of either heats or ruts depending on their primary genders.
Hurt flashes on Dean's face, but before he can make his own response the Alpha tacks on, “If you were even half the person you were now, and with me not having as much control as I do, my teenage self would have probably been half in love with you and vying for your affections within less than a month. So no, we most definitely wouldn't have stayed
He draws back sooner than they both would like, “You're fucking adorable sometimes, you know that?” he says, the words sounding a mix between crass and reverent to his own ears as he leans back into his seat, starting the car and pulling away out of his parking spot.
He knew a big part of why he was feeling the way he was right now had a lot to do with just missing his Alpha. There was a deep need and want that he couldn't shake, his Omegan instincts not knowing or
The stage wasn't really as lit up as it could have been, but it was bright enough that he can see Dean from where he was and it was probably good that there wasn't a huge spotlight on the singers, that would most definitely have derailed participants to sign up for this karaoke.
So instead of the 'sorry' that was on the tip of his tongue, he raises his own brow as he stares at the Omega, commenting, “Turns out chivalry is not in fact 'dead' as people assume it is.”
All these factors are what led to Dean taking up a spot in one of the corner booths, where the music wasn't too loud, and where the Omega could just watch the dancers on the floor without drawing too much attention to himself. He had been tempted a few times to go up, but the idea of random people touching and grinding against him always stopped that train of thought.
“Yes, well, Gabriel mentioned that I probably wouldn't be able to get through the door wearing it. Apparently, my clothes would be considered 'offensive' to the people here.” Cas replies, a displeased note making its way through his tone.
The third finger took a little extra work though, Castiel feeling the tensing up of the singer’s muscles as he worked it in along with the other two, Dean’s chest heaving as he fought his body to relax through it.
He gives Cas a bright smile when he sees his grumpy expression looking none too pleased he had to leave the comfort of his room.
One thing he did know with a palpable sort of certainty though, was that he wouldn't come out of this unscathed if Dean kept surprising him like he seemed to keep on doing at every opportunity they found themselves alone together like this.
He never knew what he intended to do, not until the pads of his fingers brushed ever so lightly over the constellation of freckles dotting the now rosy apples of Dean’s left cheek bone. The touch was soft, a gentle caress Castiel himself didn’t think he was capable of, but there he was, out in the open hallway of some hotel, mesmerised and completely taken by surprise at the sudden flare of desire that coursed through him, this all because of a simple, barely there touch.
“Your dad gave them to me, said you might need them?” Sam's voice rang out from behind the door once more, tone questioning and unsure.
Castiel can see from the corner of his eye Dean getting comfortable in his own seat as he stares at the side of his head and with false affront replies, “Only sometimes?”
Dean didn’t want Cas to be doing all of the work, tough, he wanted to make the writer feel just as good as he was making him feel. Releasing one of his hands from the tangle of Cas’s hair, he trailed a soft path along Cas’s sides, delighting in the muffled hums that he let out, which only spurred his own arousal as he felt the vibrations against his own sensitive skin.
had been swept away with Dean's offer, swept up into his world, his hopes and dreams, and all the little things he opened up to the writer about, Castiel couldn't forget why he was there in the first place.
Then a realization came to Dean, this was his first test with whether or not he could be open and honest with Cas, things that he needed to be with someone he was entrusting to do this job.
so he wouldn't look like a complete slob around the Alpha. Although, Dean has to admit, there was something deliciously arousing about wearing even these baggy clothes, simply for the fact that he knew they belonged to Cas, basking in the fact that he was being surrounded by the Alpha's scent which had seeped into the worn clothes by now already.
Castiel can't help but be amused at his huffy indignation as he takes a seat on the carpeted floor at the foot of the bed, a pillow stacked behind him from Castiel's bed for maximum comfort.
“What do ya mean?” Dean asked a bit obtusely, but Castiel could understand, what with his mind being just as clouded over with all that was happening.
Somewhere close to his heart, Dean can feel a rattling inside his chest, a reminiscence of the heartbreak he once felt when he knew it was over for them. Their relationship had been too young, too fragile, too weak for what the world had in store for them. Dean still felt that stab of guilt at knowing that being with him had caused Lisa a lot more trouble than she let on, knowing that a lot of what went wrong was his fault, his stupidity at thinking he could keep up the charade of being normal, being like everybody else, just having a career a lot sooner, that was all.
Grumbling and bemoaning his actions, not wanting the Alpha to move an inch from their warm cocoon the Omega has to soon relent as he shifts enough to grant Cas space to finally stand up.
It was surprisingly easy, being with Cas like that. Dean had thought the grumpy man he met a few weeks ago would never be up for something like playing make-believe races, or throwing colourful plastic balls into the imaginary stomach of animal figures or impressing Dean with his skills of playing good old-fashioned arcade games like Pac-man and Tekken and Street Fighter and Dean even managed to rope him into playing good old Fred Flintstone’s Memory Match.
Dean looks back and forth from the frosted confection to the Alpha, and the only thing that comes out of his mouth is a dumbfounded, “Uhh...thanks?” as the Alpha offers one to him and he takes it in his other hand that's not holding the hot chocolate as he stares down at the treat.
Goddamnit, and Dean thought his preppy, formal wear did him in already, but seems Cas generally looked good in just about anything.
His musings were soon cut-off when Cas spoke up, breaking their companionable silence, “Thank you, Dean. As unexpected as it was, this was…I had a good time tonight.”
It was as if his body couldn’t contain himself anymore, couldn’t contain the tidal wave of feelings that were flooding through his system, demanding to be let out, demanding that Dean see all of him, indulging in the satisfaction of knowing that it was winning over him. That the choice wasn’t his anymore: to keep this a secret, to hide this from Dean, from
So when they had started discussing the man, the only thing he could recall was a vague image of the person they were speaking about and as a result of his panicked state when they asked for his input, he defaulted to his usual inappropriate humour.
It wasn't so much his clothes that had grabbed the Alpha's attention, instead it was the fine dusting of make-up he had on. It wasn't caked on or anything obvious like that, but he could tell the Omega had put on some black eye-liner around his eyes, with a light brush of goldish-brown glitter on his eye-lids, making the green and brown flecks of the Omega's irises stand out and when he moved just right, Castiel could  see some shine to Dean's cheek-bones. All in all, he wasn't outrageously dressed and the make-up was clearly only meant to add some sparkle to his already gorgeous features, but even so, the Alpha found himself utterly tongue-tied at that moment, and in a way flattered that Dean had clearly decided to dress-up for their first date.
And this lack of substantial clothing only increased his unease and irritation with far too many people constantly taking the liberty of touching him, invading his space to move his body this way and that way, not bothering to ask permission before they brushed up against him as their skin made contact with his own. The constant brushes made his Omega instincts rear up, snarling angrily at the unwanted caresses, feeling backed in a corner as his own logic forced him to not flinch every goddamned time it happened.
Dean swallows heavily around the ball of emotion stinging up his throat, making his eyes mist over as he heard the sordid details of something that should never happen to anyone, least of all a fucking five year old kid.
It was the best option he had, the pills tended to make him a little loopy and slow, a contrast he wasn't sure he liked any better than how chaotic and overwhelmed everything was when his anxiety got the better of him. But, at least with the chemicals of the pills floating around in his blood stream he could get a handle on himself enough to face all those people without feeling a single thing, and he supposed that was better than how he was currently faring.
His brother was a pretty well-known photographer and it showed seeing as he was one of the most booked by clients clambering to get photo sessions with him, especially when it came to any one wanting over zealous, outrageous or over-the-top styled shoots done. And his brother's usual MO was exactly why Castiel never particularly liked going in to his place of work when he was actually busy, he knew he'd inevitably be faced with a barrage of pure
Sam followed that by sticking his hand out, Cas following suite as the two men shook hands, and Dean got the strangest feeling that they were sizing each other up, the singer placed firmly in the middle of the two men.
“Yep. He's back from fashion week, aannd guess what? Turns out lover boy is very much single. Broke up with that douche of an Alpha about three months ago, thank God.”
It seemed ridiculous to think of it that way, but he thought the phrase fit rather too well with the poorly veiled
When he got there, Dean had slammed the door shut, his heart beating a mile a minute as he leaned against the wood, hand clutched tight to his chest as his breaths came out in harsh, unrelenting pants. It seemed as if he couldn't get a hold of the tide of emotions barrelling straight through him, crippling him as he couldn't hold back the tears of pain that started to fall down his face and subconsciously his legs dragged him towards the warm light of his open bathroom door.
“Dean…I’m so sor-” Castiel started to say, but before he could get the apology completely out, in an instant Dean closed the space between them, leaning up slightly as he pressed his lips to the writer’s.
Getting up from the water is a bit of a struggle since it feels like all his limbs had seized up and went numb to his commands, but he manages without embarrassing himself and graciously accepts the long, thick, white dressing robe one of the assistants brings him when he treads further up the sand bank as he makes his way to the 'dressing room', which was little more than a pitched tent a couple of feet away from where the photo-shoot was thanks to their public location.
At exactly eight, Dean had come knocking on his hotel door (it was one of the nicer ones booked, with even the single rooms having a flat screen smart TV, couch and queen bed). He had been fresh-faced with his hair still damp from the presumable shower he had taken before, wearing a pair of dark sweat pants and a hoodie, the picture of casual youthfulness.
before taking it on. The thought of it, having another big, life altering thing happening to him, without so much as a word of agreement or consent, sent him on a tail spin, feelings, thoughts, memories of that night flooding back from where Dean had carefully stored them away only to be pondered over when he was alone.
Sam was the first to break the eye contact and finally broke the hand shake along with it, looking over at Dean as he responded, “Nope, just checking to see if you guys wanted to join in the next game, plenty of space for more teammates.”
Getting too caught up in staring in the hall mirror, mind wandering, he finally startles out of it when he hears a second, louder knock sound at the door and he hurries to open it.
Dean didn't move from his spot until the door closed with a bang behind John, the noise causing him to jump slightly. Not wanting to upset his dad even more, Dean walked over to his dressing table, slumping in the chair there as he started rooting around in the various make-up bags for some coverage. Looking up into the mirror once he found some, Dean finally saw how red and raw his cheek looked against his fair skin, his red-rimmed eyes staring unseeingly back at him.
squeak, immediately wrapping his legs around the Alpha's middle and hands around his neck in fear of being dropped.
From one moment to the next, Dean finds his lips being ravaged and owned by the Alpha as their kiss intensifies and becomes even more deep and wet and hot, with Cas's teeth nipping and sucking at his bottom lip, making it clear exactly who was in control of this kiss right now.
In the beginning, Dean had loved it, loved the great views, and the glowing crystal pool waters that was at his dispense, it had been a huge step up from the dingy, dirt riddled motel rooms he had grown up in.
Finally, his hand lands on his cell, and gripping it loosely in his palm, he automatically swipes his thumb across the screen with eyes only half-open, not even bothering to read the caller-ID. Sam then presses the phone to the ear not currently squished by his pillow, and in a rough, sleep addled voice he mumbles out a, “Hello?”
Here's a clip of the scene if any of ya'll want a visual representation of how I pictured this scene going down, a fair warning, this is definitely NSFW! XD
Before the Omega can continue with his mini-tirade, Castiel pulls him closer to his body as he dips his head down to plant a long, lingering kiss to the Omega's lips, knowing that he needed some form of physical contact to relax his Omegan instincts, with Dean not minding the PDA one bit at that moment, gladly deepening the kiss as his tongue delves in to claim the Alphas lips.
It was several minutes of Cas’s teeth biting down as hard as he dared, lips soothing over the marks, but the singer knew this time they were there to stay for much longer. His fingers curling inside him as they stretched him as wide as they could, though Dean knew Cas’s cock would still burn on the way in, and he couldn’t fucking wait anymore.
But the thought was all he needed, the sudden burst of pleasure at the prospect of Dean actually being his true mate making his mind go lazy and overtaken with a desire he had never known.
Staring at him with an angry look of her own at his implications that she might have thought so little about the Omega, she says seriously, “Look, you're right, I don't know you, but Dean's told me a lot about you and by the sounds of it he trusts you, and based on what he's said, you seemed to be a good enough Alpha, unless you're trying really hard to change my mind here about you, Castiel.”
Still, he needed to know how far Dean wanted this to go, the writer was perfectly content with simply lying here, and kissing Dean all night long if that was what he wanted. But if that was all, then his body would definitely need a breakaway for a minute to calm itself down, before he did something as embarrassing as coming in his pants like some prepubescent boy who had no control whatsoever over his libido.
“No more than you're using me,” Dean responds, meeting Cas's angry, insulted scowl with his own dejected smile that felt wobbly on his lips.
“Do it,” Dean urged, already feeling the rough scratch of Cas’s beard, knowing that would leave some red marks, if only for a little while.
Already, his jaw is opening, teeth scraping and prodding and irritating the perfect skin of the Omega’s neck, Dean whimpering and seeming to crawl closer onto his lap at his possessiveness.
of lifestyle. I mean you embarrassed me in front of my friends tonight when they asked for your opinion on the new governor of California, and the only response you could come up with was that you thought he looked like he could use a good fuck to loosen up a little. Not exactly the most riveting thing to say to show you can actually handle adult conversations now is it?” The annoyance he had felt when the Omega embarrassed him at that particular moment making itself clear in his tone.
One, two, three thrusts into his mouth and Castiel was crying out, coming in Dean’s mouth, the singer swallowing down every last drop, eyes closed as his own body shook minutely with his spent pleasure.
Shrugging his shoulder as he finally withdraws his hand and goes back to fiddling with his camera, Gabriel rolls his eyes in exaggeration, his cheery self back in place as he fires back, “Well, I can't be perfect at
sleeping in his office. When he gets to the end of the couch, now gazing at the younger man with what he knows is a soft dopey expression, he can’t help but crouch down.
After about fifteen minutes, with Castiel carrying a sleeping Dean, bridal style, the entire way, the two Alphas manage to finally get Dean to his parked car, Jo in toe and carrying the Omega's things, including the flowers Castiel discarded on the floor and directing Cas all the way until they made it out of the building.
A part of him is reluctant to share that thought with Cas though, because at the same time, he knows that's not fair to her, knows that it could just as easily be his own insecurities rearing up, wanting to taint everything good that's ever happened to him until the doubts made them seem not so good any more. And he'd much prefer to keep the memory of her as one of the few good ones he could have.
With a raised eyebrow Castiel looks at the singer saying, “Thought I was the one needing to ask questions.”
Somehow, John had gotten him out of staying the prerequisite thirty days before the hospital was allowed to discharge him, and Dean never questioned where the refill of anxiety meds came from everytime the bottle was restocked with pills at the end of each week. They helped, most times, and that was all that mattered, to both him and his dad. But somewhere in the back of his mind, he knew they wouldn't hold up for long, and one day they wouldn't help him at all, and every time that thought popped in his head, two extra pills found their way in his palm as he moved his shaking hands to his mouth, dry swallowing them and cheating himself into believing he was wrong.
Over the years, as Castiel ran various campaigns and research projects and conducted presentations and discussions, a buzz about the fatality and dangers of these conversion programmes had started and led to this moment as a small group of people, he and Crowley included, were working on one of the biggest law suits going against the whole damn organisation that had set all this fucked up bullshit into motion in the first place.
There was a buzzing under his skin, nerves shooting off and sparking in his veins, the rush and chaos of the airport seeming to reflect the jumbled mess going on inside of him right now.
After another failed attempt at being unable to fall asleep, with his body jerking itself awake when the singer had almost managed to doze off for the fourth or fifth time, Dean rolled over to the other side of the bed only to sigh when he saw that the red digital display clock read 04:46. His schedule for the day was due to start at around six like it usually did, so he had some time to kill now that he decided to just give up on getting some actual sleep for the night.
over him was a blow to his pride he wouldn't take without making Dean's life as miserable as he could manage. The Omega had realized it pretty quickly, the fact that, more than what was usual, he had been picked to model in the skimpiest outfits, clothing that promoted less coverage and revealed a lot more skin than he liked to show.
At that moment, with Cas’s body heat once again invading his space, the man seemingly leaning down just a little bit, Dean knowing he was leaning that much more up too, head twisting to the side, he knew what was coming. Something deeper, something more than the soft gentle kiss Cas had given him.
voice, although much more sterner, comes from behind them, with Dean putting his head in his hands, shaking it in obvious regret as he whispers under his breathe, “Oh my god,”
, which Lord only knew how Sam had managed to gain access to, with top celebrities making personal requests to have Cas specifically take on the writing of their own scheduled articles.
The touch of a hand on his forehead or of strong fingers running along his scalp combined with the comforting earthy scents of rain covered grass and soil that practically surrounds him and the deep, soft voice that shushed him, were never far to follow and were like soothing balms to the pain, lulling the Omega back to sleep each time.
Although Dean was feeling pretty pleased with himself, he was still a little pissed off with the whole interaction, and Cas not stepping in to say something didn't exactly help his mood any.
He never gave much thought to the way people smelled, it was always a variation between good, too much perfume or people clearly needing a deodorant stick, pronto.
Getting back on track, he continues, "I was maybe sixteen or seventeen, and I remembered this random ass dude coming up to me and asking if I would be willing to model for some art project he was doing or something. At first I thought he must be crazy, no way was I gonna just up and go with the guy, right? But then he offered to pay cash for my time, more than what I would have earned in a month doing small part-time jobs around town. So I agreed to do it. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, hella uncomfortable yeah, but not the worst way to get some cash in my pocket. Anyway, he ended up giving me a couple of the shots he took and said I should try going professional, thought he was calling bullshit, but in the end decided I might as well go for it, ya know?”
They part and Dean comes to stand next to Castiel again, while Ellen brushes back her hair and looks to the side, “Mphuh, well yes, that too, and mark my words, if you ever make me worry like this about you again, boy..”
When it finally registered, he cupped his cheek subconsciously in the palm of his own gentle hand, hoping the pressure would ease some of the pain that started to blossom there as he turned his head back to the front, looking up at John with wide, scared green eyes.
But the question never came and all he was left with was an empty motel room, with him sitting on what had now been Sam's bed, staring blankly at the wall as everything inside him slowly went numb.
Castiel bent his head, his breath fanning warm and moist as he whispered in Dean’s ear, “No marks, I promise,” he paused a moment before asking, “Do you want to stop?”
He hadn't had much time to be alone with the singer, having only arrived  yesterday. The only time Castiel really got to speak with him between then and now was when Dean's father, John, had made brief introductions.
“Will you go on a date with me, Dean?” Cas asks in his own voice that has gone even lower and deeper and rougher as he leans in to the Omega, making it so their faces are only scant inches apart.
He can't help but let out a moan at the electric sensation it sends coursing through his body, making the Alpha on top of him chuckle in his even deeper, sex-roughened voice as he brings his head up to stare down at Dean with an arched brow, “If you wanted to leave here without a sore ass, you shouldn’t have begged me to pound you harder into the mattress from the minute you got here, ” Cas teases with a cockiness to his smile that has Dean going speechless.
Dean had really tried to make this work, tried to be exactly the type of Omega someone like Michael would respect and would want for the long run, even if he felt like he wasn't being completely himself, cringing at times with how obviously (to him and probably everyone else) hard he was trying to get Michael to be satisfied with him.
Castiel knew he would have asked Dean to go on a date with him right there and then, but something stopped him, and in that period of hesitation, the Omega had made the first move and propositioned the Alpha instead. But it wasn't exactly what Castiel had wanted, so when Dean mentioned he wasn't looking for anything serious right now, he knew this was probably the best he could hope for from Dean.
Taking a deep breath in, Castiel says the first thing that comes to mind, “I apologise, that was rude and uncalled for of me to say.” Really, it was the only thing he could do at this point, and he had no qualms admitting to his shitty behaviour when warranted.
After his mom sent him away, for the second time, he had locked his feelings, the very essence of himself away, never wanting to open himself up to the opportunity of letting someone in only to be utterly crushed when they decided to desert him again, leaving him broken and alone and hurt
There was a long pause after his question, longer than Dean would like but he was determined to wait it out, not pulling away as he saw Cas’s thoughts whirring in his mind as his eyes flickered and sparked.
He had called Cas immediately, hands shaking as he dialled the now-familiar numbers, hoping and praying the Alpha would pick up.
The thought, by all logical accounts, should’ve scared him shitless. But it didn’t. The words felt more like an anchor now, as if he had been adrift all his life, lost and confused and alone, and suddenly he wasn’t anymore.
Cas couldn’t fix him, nobody could, not even himself. It still didn’t stop him from wanting to give Cas the same thing he had given the singer in return though, a space where he could let out what the singer knew was on his mind probably the entire day, probably his entire
Taking a deep breath Dean stares at his hands as if they held the answer that would make Cas accept his offer, and he's speaking before he even realizes what he wants to say, “Despite what they say about me, I'm not stupid, I know what people think of me, how they see me, why they act the way they do around me. The image I project, it's not...it's not all lies I guess, but I'm tired, ya know? I'm tired of it all, and I think maybe doing this will help make things easier,” At that point Dean couldn't not look at the deep pools of Cas's eyes, only to find that the writer was already staring intently back at him when he looks up, as he continued saying, “Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning, but the more I struggle and fight against all the build up of pressure the deeper I end up sinking and one day I'm just not gonna be breathing anymore. And all I'll have had left behind is the idea of myself. I know this probably sounds stupid, believe me, but I really just fucking need this, Cas.”
Castiel thinks, Dean nods his confirmation and turns his attention back to the Alpha and Beta as he says, “Guess I gotta go, see ya around then?” He says the last part as he gives Castiel a strange, calculating look before promptly following after the blonde.
But before he's able to finish his tirade, Dean finds himself with Alastair's hand gripping his jaw in a vice with a surprising amount of strength, nails digging into the soft flesh of his cheeks when he tries to get out of the grip, making the Omega release a pained sound before he can stop it from escaping.
Silently, before he sits himself down on the floor besides Dean he gets one of the spare couch pillows, handing it to Dean. At his confused expression, Castiel simply nods toward the foot he had stretched out awkwardly, knowing it's the one he had probably injured with the bandage he can see peeking from the top of his socked feet, “For your foot,” is all he says as he takes his own seat next to him after placing all the food down from the cart onto the floor in front of them.
Looking uncertainly back at Gabriel after he had clearly directed his question at Castiel, who couldn't fucking seem to get his brain to actually produce words, Dean explains, “Yeah, I remember him coming to visit you a few times during our shoots,” shifting his eyes back to Castiel, he gives him a barely-there, conspiratorial smile, “Hard to really forget you, you've got that whole Mr. Darcy vibe going on. You're all the girls, and some of the guys too come to think of it, can talk about when you decide to swing by.”
The Alpha pursed his lips at the thought of that, knowing that in a few months he would be seeing his mother for the first time since she had tossed her sixteen year old Alpha son into the first of its facilities, turned into a mere guinea pig in her eyes, and all to see if Alpha submission and control was possible through the suppression and at this point nothing less than eradication of their natural instincts.
Even as the thought pops in his head he finds himself reluctant to leave, and proceeds to make a complete ass of himself instead, “Hey Cas! Uhh, can I come in?”
bad at it), the Omega knew that he was not in fact cut out for the whole casual sex vibe he had been gunning for after Michael.
“Evening,” Castiel says as he arrives at their table, taking the seat next to Charlie as she and Hannah scoots over to make room for him, with Crowley and Balthazar sitting across from them. Castiel would be the first to admit that they made for an odd group, what with all their contrasting personalities, but somehow they also seemed to balance each other out in the end. He poured himself a gracious amount of beer from the pitcher that they had already ordered and took a huge gulp.
He had been scouring the place out, hoping he could spot the familiar Omega, a feat that seemed impossible with how dark the place was and he also thought about the one-hundred percent possibility of Dean spending the night with his friends.
At that, Gabriel gives him an unexpected swat to the back of his head, “Now, you listen hear Cassie, any Omega would be lucky to have an awesome person like you fawning all over them. And if I remember correctly, you never exactly tried to talk to him or even put yourself out there for that matter, now did you? Here's your second chance, kiddo. Clearly, by your reaction, that crush of yours is still going on pretty strong it would seem, so might as well see if there's something there, right?”
“Huh, didn't think you'd notice that,” Dean responds in kind turning in the Alpha's arms so he's sitting more to the side than in front of him, furrowing his brow. He never thought Cas had paid that much attention to his behaviour.
but as the Omega looks around him, taking in the dimming of the lights as the counter on the screen states five more minutes until the show is set to begin, he notes the fact that he was at the most beautiful garden he has ever seen, with fog starting to descend over the mountain range as the city lies far below, illuminated by thousands of lights. With the Omega drinking hot chocolate and eating a freaking cupcakes, sitting in the warm embrace of the Alpha he's been slowly falling for every time he sees and feels those blue eyes piercing his own little Cas-shaped hole in his heart, Dean can't help but to think to himself that,
Dean quickly gets up from his seat, hearing a very displeased grunt from the Beta, not that he could care less about that, as he goes to Cas's side. The Alpha still has his eyes glued to the Beta, so Dean touches his shoulder to get him to look at him instead. When Cas finally shifts his focus to him, he can see a spark of surprise there when the Alpha turns his head to stare at the Omega's hand that was touching his sleeve.
He honestly didn't think he'd go up there singing that song, having decided on a cheesy 80's song that would have no doubt made Cas laugh his ass off at his poor rendition of the cover, but then he had seen the familiar song amongst Garth's selection of choices and on a whim decided to just go with it.
Before he can finish the thought, Cas was placing the items on the bed, then removing his trench coat, going for the hem of his sweater before Dean’s brain got into gear when the writer was standing bare-chested in front of him, “W-what the hell’re ya doing?!”
“Hey...you wanna...do something...later on? Thought we could...hang out, watch a...movie or something,” Dean says, not even waiting to catch his breath as he wheezes his way through the question.
He was chasing that pleasure, chasing those beautiful sounds Dean was making as he himself could only crudely grunt and groan like a man possessed. Chasing Dean’s body as it moved away, only to come right back with as much force as he could manage with his admittedly limited mobility with how Castiel was holding on tightly to his body.
Dean for sure shared more than he wanted to with that and he can feel a slight blush creeping up his neck. But the positively dazzling smile that Cas directs at him forces the Omega to look away from those blue eyes, which seems determined to burn a hole through him from all the staring he's done in the past few minutes, since he could feel his heart-beat clumsily stumbling in its rhythm.
But before he can get in himself Jo stops him with a hand on his shoulder, “Thanks again for doing this, I really appreciate it,” she pauses, Castiel doesn't interrupt when he senses she isn't done, a look of contemplation on her face, “Dean really likes you, you know. And by the looks of it you really like him too,"Jo doesn't say this to rat Dean out, but she also knew the Omega was good at sabotaging himself, and after seeing how gentle Cas was with him, even if he didn't know it, she had a feeling the Alpha could be good for her friend and Lord only knew how he deserved to have more good things in his life right now.
“Here,” she says, handing the blanket over to Dean as he looks up at her, brow raised in question, “why don’t you get some sleep while you wait, I’ll make sure to give him a call to pop around in here before he leaves, just in case.”
John didn't bother waiting for a response from Dean as he handed his son his barely touched glass of whiskey, politely extricating himself from the group and with confident strides headed after the other man.
"Well, I think people could be wrong. Intimacy and passion, they don't work like that, how could they possibly be so
Castiel always felt like there was a coldness inside of him that just seemed to block off and blanket all his emotions, creating the cool, distant exterior that came out in the flat sound of his tone and calm and stony visage of his features, which often left people with the impression of someone uncaring and at times unapproachable. Strangely, he found a way to use this to his advantage when it came to working with the type of people his job required him to constantly be around, since most of the time he was commemorated on his ability to stay professional.
had all of him, and instead of going taut and tense, his body seems to gently relax, bones liquid fire as he gives up all control to his Alpha, trusting he would give his Omega what he so desperately needed.
“They're beautiful, thank you, Cas,” Dean interrupts with a sweet peck to the Alpha's lips as he accepts the bouquet, saving the Alpha from his nervous rambling. Trust Cas not to notice how exactly well-known some of the models (Dean included) were at that event, and obviously they wouldn't allow some random man into the
He could feel the throb of his heart beat in his throat, knew that if Cas were to move back up to his pulse point he would feel it too, but this was no time to chicken out, not when he was so so close,
Time passed by slowly, it could’ve been minutes or hours as they sat there in silence, Dean offering Cas the only comfort he knew from so far away.
John's words were angry and scathing as he stood right up in front of Dean's face, looking down at his son, the scared look in his eyes making his temper rise even more with how truly pathetic he looked right then. Like a cowering dog too scared to face its own shadow, John would never know where he got this behaviour from, because he certainly taught his son to be better than that.
It all only served to remind him why he hated this job, his inaction in doing nothing and choosing to simply endure only serving to make him feel that much worse. But this was his life and in a strange way the Omega had found a comfort in the familiar, the occasional praise with how good he was at doing what he did providing another sort of warmth and pride, an unbalanced buffer against the rest of the bullshit he went through.
Gabe's voice draws the Omega back to the present as the Beta says, “Oh, come on, I know you love me,” as he smirks to himself when he sees the Omega pouting, even if he wouldn't call it that.
The best and most refreshing thing about Jo was that she was one of the most honest and trustworthy people he’d ever met and people like that were especially hard to come by in this line of business. Dean would forever be grateful to her for accepting the position to be his manager, considering the mess he had been when they met. But Jo was easy and took it all in stride, and Dean really wanted to work with her and keep her around so he put in the effort to do better and take his job more seriously, trying not to think about it as something he just had to suffer through to get a pay check at the end.
Dean couldn't really remember what happened after that, all that his memory could summon up of that incident was the vague image of Sam's wide hazel eyes looking down at him in absolute horror at the same time as he felt a burning, warm sensation running across his forearms. Sometimes, the fact that he couldn't remember any of it; having no recollection of getting out the razor he kept in his cabinet, of not sitting down on the cold tiled floor of the bathroom, not even of running the smooth, sharp metal across his wrists so many times that he had unintentionally made huge gashes in his skin to the point where he had been bleeding out right there, that realization that he had let his anxiety and panic take such total control over his body, this was what scared him the most.
He made his way to the bedroom section of the luxury suite he was staying at for the time he was in Paris. If there was ever one perk about being in his position it was that he had always been booked in the grandest, most outrageously posh hotels every time he had shoots that took him away from home.
The phone only rang for a short while, though each passing ring felt as if the Omega was slipping further and further away from his Alpha, but finally he heard the deep cadence of his Alpha’s voice on the other end, “Hello Dean.”
But Castiel doesn’t relent, mouth moving over to take one of the Omega’s nipples into his mouth, teeth sharp as they bite into the oversensitive bud to distract his Omega from the punishing thrusts of his fingers as they twist and curl and scissor him open.
But the Omega's attempt turns out not to be any better, paint landing with a resounding splat on the newspaper behind him and somehow in his hair too, with even less than Castiel's landing on the actual wall.
And in those years of being lost to her, he had built up an image of her in his mind, an image of how he thought she
Experimenting, Castiel unaware as he’s lost to his own pleasure, Dean thrusts back harder trying to get whatever it is
Castiel sighed in resignation when he heard the first notes of one of Dean's songs start to play, and he resigned himself to a night spent inside his hotel room where all the official employees, including Dean himself, were staying until he finished up the two concerts he had scheduled in this city.
Suddenly, the fleeting thought of seeing Dean, of getting a glimpse of green eyes and freckles that stood out against his paler complexion, of kissing those bow-shaped, plump lips at the end of the night, spurred the Alpha into action, ridding himself of the momentary paralysis his nerves had sent him into.
It was a normal occurrence so he wasn't that upset, but the newbie photographer they had hired wouldn't stop apologising for the delays over and over to all the staff present, even when it was just standard procedure. The Omega had subsequently stepped in when he could see the man needed a little help in figuring out how to co-ordinate everyone and everything. Nerves making themselves known in the continuous mistakes he kept making on simple shots. Dean was no expert but he caught on quickly in knowing at least the basics of the game over the years. And with his sympathetic streak, which had more than once bit him in the ass when it came to the Arrogants of the world who never appreciated any form of guidance, least of all from someone whose sole job was to smile and look pretty, the mother-hen in him couldn't help but be let out once he saw the man struggling and becoming more than a little intimidated by what this job entailed.
“Baby bro! You made it!” Gabriel shouts from across the room, voice barely making it over the sound of the music coming through the speakers and causing a few heads to turn at the suit and cloak clad figure, with the boom of his voice.
“It's a great stress reliever, maybe you could come with me sometime,” Cas responds, completely oblivious to the unimpressed tone in the Omega's voice when he mentioned hiking, and he looks at the Alpha sceptically, “Yeah...maybe. When pigs fly,” Dean says the last part under his breathe, too soft for Cas to hear as the Alpha leans in and questions, “What was that?”
Dean can't help but swallow, his mouth suddenly gone dry as he realises that his trail down Cas’s body wasn’t entirely platonic when seeing whether he looked fine or not, which he did.  Look fine that is.
“Pft, who said I was imaging my brother?” Gabe says, giving the Omega a leery once over and a flirty wink to top it all off, “I mean, those fried eggs are really working for you today, they just make your eyes pop!”
Dean could admit he was trying to avoid the guy like he was the fucking plague. Even though he knew he couldn't dodge interacting with him completely, he could bloody well try to keep it at a minimum, he had enough shit to deal with right now as it were.
“I could spend all night kissing you, if you want me to, or,” he paused, minutely shifting his hips in a more rhythmic manner, moving Dean’s in tandem, forcing their clothed erections to rub against each other in a slow, filthy grind, the writer knowing that they both could definitely come from this alone.
He had always wondered, from the moment up on that rooftop to the night he asked Cas to write his story, what it was about the writer that drew him to the man, why he chose to trust Cas the most, why he chose to share his secrets with this cold, unresponsive person. And now he knew. Cas made him feel safe.
Cas hummed, letting Dean know he was listening and prompting Dean to continue, “Yeah, my mom, she loved the ocean, used to take me out every chance she could. I remember she had one of them real old Polaroid cameras, used to run around down on the beach front forcing me to take pictures with her. She always said she looked her best when I was in the shots with her, though that was probably just her way of guilt-tripping me to not run away every time she brought it out.”
Sighing exasperatedly, Castiel decides maybe this was what he needed, to talk it out, get some advice from his friends, they were a chaotic bunch, but he knew when push came to shove, they were always there to help each other out. Gabriel was good at giving advice, when the occasion called for it, but he had already said his piece on the matter and Castiel needed help with
It's completely fine if you don't agree and your opinion on the matter may align differently, we aren't all the same and we don't all think the same and that's a beautiful thing in itself.
“Uh, hi, Cas, can I come in?” Dean asks softly, unsurely, shifting from foot to foot right there in the brightness of the hallway, as he takes in Cas's off guard expression, still debating with himself if this was the right thing to do, but knowing he couldn't very well just walk on off to his own room once he had finally gotten Cas himself out of his own bed.
“An understatement I would say, considering I was a foster child,” Cas said, Dean turning his head sharply at that little bit of information legs falling off of the railing with the sudden motion of concentrating his entire being on the man as his blue gaze kept staring firmly out at the open waters ahead of them.
“Wish you could’da taken me raw,” Dean whimpered, the words spoken softly, ashamed at the vulgar fantasy. But it caused a sharp spark of arousal shooting through both of them as Castiel muffled his loud, unrestrained groan by mouthing at the side of Dean’s neck, knowing it would’ve been loud enough for the neighbours to hear.
When he gets to Dean, he stretches out his arm, hand open with his palm out, a clear invitation as his voice, thick and deep and gruff, reaches the Omega’s ears, “You deserved your slow dance Dean, with a date who utterly and completely and wholly adored everything about you, sweetheart, and I should have at least made someone’s night special if not my own. So, Dean Winchester, will you go to prom with me?”
It was all it took. Before the singer could completely move away, Castiel pushed his own body that much closer to Dean’s, hand moving to wrap around his waist, making Dean arch into him, his free hand coming up to the side of Dean’s jaw, his thumb applying the slightest amount of pressure on his chin to angle the singer’s head so he could deepen the kiss.
Placing a kiss on the Omega's collar bone, Cas eventually rolls off of him, and gets up to head to the bathroom. He comes back out with a warm wash cloth, which he uses to wipe the mess Dean made on between his thighs and on his stomach. Still riding the waves of his post-orgasm glow, he doesn't have the time to feel even remotely embarrassed about how he's wantonly sprawled out on the Alpha's sheets, looking and feeling very much fucked out of his mind.
“Because I thought if she couldn’t come back, if she couldn’t find me in all those years, I would go out and find her instead. And that was exactly what I did. I hired a PI with the money and used it to pay my way to get to her. Only, once I did I left out one crucial factor.”
to understand.' It something that still frustrates Castiel to this day, that people kept judging others based on instinctual traits that were out of their control.
“Before all this,” Dean starts, his hand moving in a waving gesture as a way to explain what he meant by that, “my life was pretty normal, as normal as it could've been I guess, since dad still insisted on travelling from one hot-spot-for-fame to the next every coupla' months.”
I like to think more about what they meant for him, chasing after your future, your hopes and dreams, no matter that everybody else thought he was crazy and would never pull it off. Maybe fucking up a little as you do it, and making the wrong choices, but knowing you'll end up wherever and with whoever you're supposed to be with. It's irrational, and stupid, the exact opposite of practical, and if that ain't love I don't know what is. So yeah, it's a materialistic gift, but only if you choose to see it as anything else but earrings and not what they meant to him.”
Just as Dean was about to reiterate his decline and maybe leave to find Cas instead, said Alpha returned to their booth, drinks in hand.
All in all, even though Castiel couldn't understand the looks he was getting, and okay, people probably found it odd that he had been carrying around a small bouquet of flowers the entire night thus far (he had thought about giving it to Dean prior to the show, but he underestimated how hard it would be to get past the security to the backstage area, as apparently, just knowing a name meant absolute shit to them), he wouldn't have missed coming tonight if it meant he could have the opportunity to see Dean and he was determined to keep his word that he would be here.
Thirty minutes later and Dean is unlocking the door of his hotel room, exhausted and completely done with this trip, and desperately wishing Cas would be there with him, the Alpha's comforting arms waiting to greet him with an embrace sparking a longing so fierce Dean wants to cry. Instead the Omega has to spend yet another night comforting himself with his own weak and cold arms wrapped loosely around his body until he can finally drift off.
“Holy, shit! You said his name was Dean right? And he's a model?” Charlie exclaims, rather out of the blue. With all he said,
“You can just say you like the movie Dean, nothing wrong with having a few guilty pleasures,” Castiel replies to his earlier comment, trying to bring them back from the weird moment, seeing out the corner of his eyes at how Dean stares at the pillow, holding it close and smiling slightly before he finally moves it into position, looking a lot more comfortable.
But perhaps this was all simply in his head too: the looks, the gestures, the intimacy of their time spent together, maybe whilst Castiel had been profoundly changed by it all, Dean had not been.
Arching a brow at the Alpha, Dean walks over and dips his own brush in one of the colours, the Omega going for a purple shade, “It's not that hard ya know,” he says confidently.
The building looks as if it were one of the newer ones, being hard to miss amongst the castle-like structures he had passed, with this one instead being dominated by glass walls on all sides, an orange glow lighting up the building like a beacon as the sun had finally faded, making way for dusk to settle its dark shadows over the place.
“That's just the thing, I tried negotiating a once-off, two hour interview tops, but they won't run a story if that's the condition,” John said, sounding miffed that he actually failed at negotiating on his terms this time around.
Although, for all of Dean's emotional backlogs, Castiel could also admit that he wasn't as open about his life as he should be either. He had barely scratched the surface with the things he had told Dean already, and while he wanted the Omega to get to know all of him, to
That was all it took before he felt the pressure of Cas’s thick finger pressing harder, the digit finally making it passed the tight ring of muscles before sinking as deep as it could. Dean gasped at the foreign intrusion, body tensing up for just a second before it could register how fucking
Sam just nods his head, not making a big deal out of Dean's admission. Tf there was one thing Dean loved about the big Sasquatch, it was that he was chill about most things, and simply took things as they came.
Castiel's other hand soon stretches around the Omega to capture his hip, pressing him even closer to the Alpha as he glides his hand up his waist and along his back, stopping until he has the back of the Omega's neck firmly in his grip, controlling the movements of the kiss as he presses his fingertips along the soft skin of his throat, the wet sounds of their lips moving over each other increasing in pitch the more out of breath they become.
With Cas's hands still cupping his, Dean's own ones come up to hold and caress the Alpha's wrists as he dares to open his eyes, “So...does this mean you liked the song?” The hopefulness in his voice is obvious, but at this point he couldn't care less about how desperate he sounds as he holds his breathe and waits for Cas's response.
Usually Cas never exactly tagged along on every one of his day-to-day activities, but he was there for the majority of it, and the fact he hadn't seen Cas
The Alpha had instantly stepped closer without even thinking, something about the green-eyed Omega just seemed to call to him, drawing him in and wanting him to be closer. He couldn't deny the instinctual pull, even knowing that it was crazy and completely irrational for him to be this star struck by the Omega. But seeing him sitting all by himself in the crowded space intensified those feelings tenfold and before he knew it he was making his way over to Dean.
They never really speak about what happened that night. Dean fucking hates himself even more for knowing that his actions led to Sam seeing what he did; the limp, bloody, cut open reminiscence of a friend dying out on a cold tiled bathroom floor, when the only reason he sought him out that night was to congratulate Dean on his success. Dean wasn't stupid enough not to know that it was that fucking night that was the thing sitting weighted and rotting between them, choking out their conversation and closing off each to the other.
He tries to pull away from her then as he feels the stiffness of her body, but before he can he feels her stiff posture shift as she lays her arms around his slender shoulder, hands strong and sure as she accepts the comfort of an Omega, something she hasn’t felt in a long, long time.
Castiel knows Dean is only teasing, not exactly believing the words he was saying, but that thought doesn't detract from the warmth he feels in his heart that Dean would feel so comfortable to tease him like this regardless if he meant what he said or not. If Castiel had said before that he thought Dean was adorable, no matter how he phrased it, the Omega would have immediately derailed that train of conversation and pretend as if the Alpha hadn't said anything at all.
But there was no hope of that, not when he hopped out the door at lightning speed, not even waiting until it had come to a complete stop in its parking spot. And the smirk Sam had lost comes back in full force, shaking his head and wondering how anyone could miss the singer’s own obvious infatuation with the grumpy, blue eyed journalist.
Judging by the number of cars and patrons moving in and out of the place it wasn't packed, but it wasn't completely empty either, with a reasonable stream of people moving about the place.
. Dean’s unchecked emotions revealing his own affections and desire, a perfect, synchronised reflection of Castiel’s own, as they were drawn to the surface through every accidental touch, every word spoken secretly, the noise of their surroundings offering a convenient excuse for intimacy to blossom between the pair as the night wore on.
But this was one of those rare occasions where those feelings felt too big for him to carry let alone hide, with the weight of them sitting on his chest, right at the surface ready to explode right there and then. Dean knew if he didn't get out of that room, which was filled with all their usual crew members with John having planned a party in celebration of their success, he would make an utter embarrassment of himself, but it was more the thought of embarrassing himself in front of John that made his feet cooperate and move until he was making his way to his bedroom.
He didn’t know anything about this Alpha, but suddenly he felt an overwhelming amount of gratitude towards her, for giving Cas what he had sorely been lacking for most of his life, a proper mother.
Gabriel had got to his house sooner than he expected, having used the keys he had to let himself in as he rushed up the stairs, only to his brother in a heaped, stricken sweaty mess.
“Please follow me,” is all she says before she turns around not bothering to make sure if the Alpha is actually following her or not. Deciding he didn't really have much of a choice he stands up, coat and flowers in each hand and manoeuvres his way through the aisle, following the woman.
Castiel does the universal sign of zipping his mouth and throwing away the key, much to the Omega's amusement at the childlike gesture, the Alpha only receiving Dean rolling his eyes at his antics as a response.
When the Alpha realises he can't stay silent forever Sam finally responds with, “Dean? Hey man, is something wrong?” and he knows his shock must be coming through in his voice, but hoping he sounds at least somewhat casual.
being the one looking a little as flustered as Castiel felt, gives the Alpha the boost of confidence to tease back and say, “And what about you? Do you talk about me too?”
Dean's body feels weak with how thoroughly the Alpha is fucking him, mind going blank as his body buzzes with the electric sparks coursing through his veins at the sensations that are overloading his senses. Dean doesn't know if he could ever survive the Alpha claiming him, let alone a heat or god forbid a
It was hard for the Omega to explain this hurricane of urgency and desperation, his Omegan brain battering even more than it had been at his insides now that he was back home, having not been pleased in the least with how long it had been since he last saw his Alpha. Dean knew things might’ve been different if they had been in a longer relationship, if they had maybe even been mated, but the fact was that he had left with only an already fading claiming mark as his only reassurance and comfort.
Back when John had first told Dean about Cas, he had asked Sam to look into Cas, or more specifically his published articles with
But they weren’t enough, when once he knew they probably could have been, though things had shifted between them, things were different now and Castiel could feel safe knowing he could admit to himself that he missed his Omega, more than he thought was probably normal at this point. He missed Dean down to his core. He missed his whiskey deep yet soft voice. He missed those plump bow-shaped lips that could be so sweet yet so seductive at the same time. He missed the Omega’s bow shaped legs wrapped tightly around the hard contours of the Alphas body. He missed ravaging the Omegas body and being inside of Dean, feeling that give of his soft flesh, inside and out, to his unyielding ministrations. He missed the constant wake-up calls, the mornings when Dean or he stayed the night because they never wanted to be apart, although none of them would admit it and simply beg exhaustion or it being late.
But all Cas does is shrug his shoulder as if he didn't almost make the Omega slick all over himself right there in the middle of the bar his, practically adoptive family owns.
People were always surprised to hear that they were brothers, not that Castiel could fault them for that. They were exceedingly different in both appearance and personality, so much so that it was hard to believe they remotely even shared the same DNA, but they had always been close, and grew even closer when Gabriel forced him to come and live with him out here in California after...
John's presence in the studio had only made for a more tense and on-edge atmosphere, and it wasn't just Dean who felt that way. The moment his dad had stepped out to take a call, him, Rob, the music producer and Steve, the sound engineer, had been much more relaxed and they got through the rest of the takes in no time.
, and something not so utterly out of reach that they were too scared to go near him. But he was just like everyone else; he wanted those touches, those kisses and sweet moments. His whole life, all he ever wanted was to be loved.
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean says, a softer smile plastered on his face now as he lets his hand smooth down his clothes, not exactly in a self-conscious gesture since he has a somewhat pleased look about him, but more as an indicator of his own apparent nerves.
At his probing, soft-hazel gaze, Dean bows his head, and Sam can see the splotches of red tinting Dean's right cheek in the warm glow of the car lights, and he gives Dean a knowing look.
“What!? No!” Dean yelps and cringes inwardly at how defensive that sounded as he quickly locks and places his phone face-down in his lap, knowing Jo must have sneaked a peak at it while he was apparently too absorbed with the Alpha to notice her appearance.
There was a moment of tense silence, but then Cas sighed deeply, closing his eyes for a second, and when he opened them Dean could see his regret written all over his face.
Once inside, Jo is quick to spot him among the chaos of the other models getting ready with various make-up artists and hair stylists moving about trying to get them ready for their shots coming up.
Dean can't help but let out a fond chuckle when he sees the Alpha's greeting. Even chatting, Cas was somewhat awkward and formal. The Omega thought he would have been put off with it by now, but Dean soon learned it was just one of those quirks that made Cas who he was, and he couldn't deny that he actually liked the Alpha more than he probably should given their tentative arrangement.
Castiel looks down at the table as he twiddles with the straw that came with the water, which had been placed in front of them when they first sat down as the memories of his high school years seemed to replay on fast forward, “Think more anti-social, boy who always got into fist-fights type. I was the quintessential angry teenager,”
Cas had once mentioned, when he had tried describing his rag tag group of friends, that Hannah was an older Alpha in his department and somewhat of a mentor to the younger Alpha.
“Yeah. We're all done for the day, so we can head back as soon as crowd-control gives us the all-clear to leave,” Sam responded, looking over their schedule for tomorrow as he suddenly remebered what John had told him, “Oh, I almost forgot, your dad wants to see you in your dressing room before we leave, said he wanted to talk to you about something. So you can go on back there, and I'll come get you when security calls, yeah?”
The surprised expression on Dean's face as he looks at Castiel and then down at his own state of dress matches the writers own confused one. He never meant to say that, but there it is, the words hanging heavy between them, Castiel grasping at straws to cover the awkward statement but coming up empty as his own brain tries to rewire whatever the hell it was thinking, putting himself on the spot like that.
It was strange how he hated that his brother had always thought of him as this amazing person, who could make anything of himself,
practical and he says as much, “You don't think him spending all his savings on a piece of jewellery for a girl is vain and materialistic? He could've used it for much more important things, perhaps as a safety net once he's out of high school and clearly on his own, with no help from his father, could've even funded his own art for all that a couple hundred dollars was worth back then.”
This time, he was the one to break their silence, something about being there up on that deck, listening to the soft trembling of the waves as it hit the shore in the distance jarring a strange feeling of intimacy as he reminisced, “Ya know, I think one of my earliest memories was of the ocean.”
“Somehow, I don't think being without scent blockers, surrounded by horny people grinding against each other and practically breathing down my neck, would be such a good way to relieve stress.” Although she had a point that he liked to dance and when in the right company it was a great way for him to just let go, he didn't have the energy for stranger's making unwanted advances on him. After he had stopped using scent blockers about four year's ago, dancing in crowded, seedy clubs was definitely a big no-no for him. About the only place he felt comfortable enough doing that these days was at The Roadhouse, where he knew the company would be good.
Her blonde hair is tied up in a tight ponytail, although some strands has come loose, making her appearance seem a little frazzled, wearing a very professional-looking grey pants suit, the blazer sleeves rolled up to the elbows.
In a matter of seconds Dean manages to get his belt undone and his hard member out, as Castiel reclines to his elbows, enjoying the view of his Omega on his knees between his open thighs.
“Speak of the devil.” Gabriel whispers, when he looks over his shoulder, and sees the very subject of their conversation heading their way.
“You feeling better?” Cas asks, staring at Dean as the Omega tries to process what the actual fuck is going on right now, not realizing that he closed his eyes when the Alpha's lips brushed against his skin or that he's practically nuzzling into the warm hand that was still stroking the side of his face.
But standing there, taking in Cas’s surprisingly warm heat that radiated off the man, bringing with it the scent of his body had Dean pausin, taking it in as discreetly as he could. But beyond smelling really
“You're thinking pretty hard up there,” Dean states, deciding to break the silence and give Cas an opening window to voice whatever he has his mind on, placing his chin on his forearms so he can gaze up at the Alpha.
Leaning up, he gently brushes his lips against Cas's, the contact barely lasting a few seconds, before he says in the most seductive voice he can, “More than sure Cas. Come on, do your worst, Alpha.”
He knew Gabe had a point, but he somehow also knew that getting with Dean wouldn't be that simple or easy either. Then again, he also had a feeling that Dean would definitely be worth the effort it would take to actually get to know him, beyond the brief glimpses the Alpha stole of the Omega.
“How do you know that? Maybe you’re wrong,” Dean didn’t know why he was pushing it like this, but a pit had formed in his stomach at Cas’s words, spoken so surely that it threatened to topple everything he had thought he already reconciled with.
It was while he was processing the last couple of minutes and looking out at the direction the Alpha disappeared in that someone takes up the seat next to him, making Dean startle.
Sighing, Castiel rubs his temple in an attempt to both get rid of the memories that particular train of thought would no doubt bring up and to mentally prepare himself for whatever ambush Gabriel had set up for him, because there was no doubt in his mind that his brother had something up his sleeve when he all but forced Castiel to pick him up rather than meeting up at their regular spot.
for them. A crucial life changing chance missed. And if he made that choice, that decision to turn away, he knew it would be his life’s biggest regret, something he would punish himself forever for if he never took what he, what
Dean sputters, but not wanting to lose this game and be bested he says, “Fucking isn't an adjective you know.”
. I mean you’re hot as hell, and a sweet little thing like you on my arm certainly never hurt my ego, don’t get me wrong, but people would just never take me seriously in my role as a potential congressman if they saw me with someone like you.”
he would be without Dean’s constant presence, as if Dean had become his tether and without him around the world seemed to move on without him.
The Omega then decides to simply wander aimlessly, one of the doors must be Cas’s office and Dean’s hoping he’d spot his name on a door plaque or something.
Losing his steam, Sam deflates as he hunches over again, and when he sees Bobby moving out of the corner of his eyes, probably in an effort to console him or some shit like that, which he knows he doesn't deserve, the Alpha moves his shoulder away, making it so that the Beta's fingers barely brush the sleeve of his arm, “Don't. It's better this way. Dean doesn't need any of this right now, he's a very public figure, I'll just cause more problems.”
“Oh, shut up and just take me to bed already.” Dean responds, deliberately shifting his hips, making the hard line of the Alpha's cock brush up against his ass. And with the loud groan the Alpha lets out at this action, it's his chance to give Cas his own smug look.
Grip tightening on the phone, Sam can't help but let out a frustrated growl, but before he can throw the offending device against the wall like he so much wants to, just so he can hear the satisfying crash, he hears the squeak of  his door hinges as it opens up, before he turns to see Bobby standing there in the doorway, “That yer brother on the phone?”
Castiel wanted to punch himself in the fucking face. He hoped that didn't sound as bad as he thought it did, but judging by the shit-eating grin his brother was giving him that bordered on him out right bursting into laughter, he guessed he wasn't that lucky then.
As he steps out once the elevator dinged once it had made its way up to the fourth floor, Dean realizes he has no clue what to do now.
Thinking all the while to himself that he shouldn't have made that call to begin with, of course Sam didn't want to see him, it's been almost three years and during that time his brother hadn't exactly reached out to him. Dean knew because he hadn't ever changed his number, fooling himself that the only reason was he didn't want to deal with the trouble, when deep down he knew it had more to do with the fact that if Sam ever wanted to get in touch again, it'd be easier for him.
“Come on, Dean. It won't be so bad, and besides you love dancing, maybe tonight's just what you need to loosen up a bit yeah?” Jo responds in her own begging tone.
This is completely fine if you find yourself as one such person, there are plenty of pretty darn great fics out there that I've read and enjoyed that would present this otherwise.
Before her tirade can get too heated though, Dean steps in and gives her a hug, saying in her shoulder, “I missed you too.”
Dean Winchester actually blushing right now? You totally have it bad for him, don't you? You been talking to him an awful lot more than I thought, guess grumpy, blue eyed men just does it for ya, huh?”
“Bad day?” Cas asked over the other end, and it was strange how that question, in an instant, had lifted a weight off his shoulders, knowing he didn’t have to explain in excruciating detail the events of the day that had led to Dean wanting to seek comfort in the Alpha. What, in the first place, had made him frantically check in the mirror for that reassuring mark. Knowing his Alpha wouldn’t push him, didn’t
that being here was a big deal for Dean, even if it were childish, it was the only time he could be just himself.
Dean in turn looks at Cas with his own open, sincere expression, letting the Alpha know he wasn't joking around, “Is this you being serious, or are you teasing me right now Dean?” Cas asks, clearly needing the verbal confirmation, which the Omega could understand since just a week ago he had refused the Alpha, so he puts the flowers aside and reaches his arms up to wrap around the Alpha's neck, bringing their bodies closer so Cas was standing in the space between his legs as he shifts them wider, the Alpha's hands automatically going to the Omega's hips to steady him on the chair.
Castiel stares at him and he allows himself to think about that pleasant scenario and finally replies, “Most definitely, although not for long.”
Looking to where he discarded his coat, Cas reaches out for it and with some effort, manages to prop Dean's body up against the wall for the moment, and even though he's only able to get it on backwards, so the coat is mainly covering his front, it would have to do for the time being. As bazaar as the situation is, Castiel can't help  admitting to himself that seeing something of his on Dean, his scent surrounding the Omega and providing warmth, pleases his Alpha instincts to no end.
Things kept changing between them it seemed like, too fast for Castiel to grasp until the next morph in their relationship came about. But there was a strange undercurrent in this
Castiel gives Gabriel a dark, stormy look, the one he's perfected over the years of dealing with difficult students, “That doesn't mean shit, and you know it. I wasn't exactly on his radar before he met Michael, you know. He barely knew I existed!” Castiel responds vehemently, slight rejection marring the blunt words.
“It’s nothing, just, this was the song they played at my prom, it was so cheesy and awful hardly any of the students even bothered with the classic end-of-prom slow dance,” the Omega explains, laughing silently as he recalls the stank, pinched expressions on all his peers’ faces that night.
With his new resolve set in place, he steps out of the car and makes his way over to the familiar structure he had visited for other reasons during the past month or so.
What was supposed to be one of the best nights of his life had, in a matter of minutes, morphed into one of the worst. He remembered feeling that rush of excitement for his accomplishment, that he would actually be one of the few to get to live out what had always been a childhood dream of his ever since he started out singing, but that feeling had soon been trampled by a rush of fear and anxiety, feelings he became all too familiar with over the years, and ones he learnt well how to mask.
Journalist. But he also knew he had always been such a damn unlikable person, inside and out. And knowing how to say things, how to carefully consider and frame words, something that came so naturally to most people, was always something he had had difficulty with.
“Do you think if we had met in high school, we would have been friends,” Dean says out of the blue as he seems to be turning the question over in his head.
But his exploration never lasts too long. For once, this wasn’t his show, and he couldn’t help but love how deliciously sweet giving up his tightly clasped control was. How completely gone with arousal he was when the hand that was wrapped around his waist comes up and cups the back of his neck, only for Cas to tilt his head to the side, exposing  the tender flesh of his throat as the writer breaks their kiss, Dean’s already cracked voice strangling out a moan of protest, only for him to groan loudly when he feels those chapped lips nipping and sucking and laying sweet kisses all over the sides of his neck and down lower, hands moving his collar to the side to expose more of his skin to Cas’s hungry mouth.
“Mmm, that could be a very real possibility,” the Alpha says as he turns a smouldering look towards the Omega.
Their conversation was interrupted by none other than Garth though, when he presented Dean with a sign up sheet for the karaoke they were about to start.
“Oh, Hannah? As in Cas’s Hannah?” Dean questions without thinking, though he can feel the warmth of a blush on his face when he notes the particular phrasing of his words.
And with the A/B/O dynamics, it works pretty much the same as gender, so there's no period of 'presenting' at puberty although that is when the first heat or rut starts for Alphas and Omegas and like with gender where you can tell whether people are males or females on sight, at least with most people, same applies to their secondary gender. Think of it as a type of sixth sense they have.
Just as the thought popped into his head, he could feel how Dean’s lips became more hesitant, more tentative to the unresponsive lips beneath his own and slowly, in increments he began to pull away.
“No, no, nothing's wrong. Just wanted to see if maybe you'd wanna meet up some time? Haven't seen you in a few, is all.” Dean says as he fiddles with a loose thread from his favourite worn-out pair of jeans.
If there was one thing he had hated about moving around a lot, it was the fact that he never managed to make any friends, not ones he could actually talk to. It made for a pretty lonely childhood, with Dean always holing up in whichever school's library he was at during his lunch times or free periods, reading his comic books.
Dean knew he wouldn't have agreed to go out with him if he wasn't sure, he enjoyed teasing the Alpha, but not the kind where he was intentionally stringing Cas along, that would have just been cruel, “Sounds perfect, Cas,” giving Cas what he knew was a dopey smile and a wink before he heads up the stairs toward the Alpha's bedroom to collect his things.
“What did you do this time, Gabriel?” Castiel asks seriously, giving his brother a flat, unimpressed look.
“So have you ever been in love before?” Dean asks when the silence stretches out too long between them, just wanting something to fill the space. A small part of him being a little more than curious though.
Sam thinks mournfully, just as he hears Dean give a cough on the other end, and when he speaks again his voice comes out a bit clearer, but still having a slightly high pitch to the tone,“It's Dean.”
A few hours pass by before they're finally done, paint dripping down the wall as Castiel and Dean fall back on the newspaper strewn floor in exhaustion.
The woman ends up leading him down a corridor, with various rooms on either side of the hallway and stops at one of them, knocking on the closed black door three times before stepping back, hands crossed low as she waits beside Castiel.
In lieu of a response, Castiel steps aside, leaving the door open as he heads back into the darkness of his room, moving to the bedside table to switch the lamp light on. The light sheds a warm, golden glow on the space, making their current predicament seem all the more intimate than what was probably appropriate. Then again, Dean knocking at his door at this hour, coupled with Castiel's current state of undress what with him wearing only his boxer shorts and all, which he only notices once he sees Dean averting his eyes, looking anywhere but at the writer, ensured that their exchange would be anything but professional in Castiel's opinion.
him. With another image of him slowly taking up root, holes and broken pieces still needing to be filled in with other truths, other memories, other secrets.
Bounced around from foster home to foster home, never got adopted, not that I could blame some of the families who took me in. I was…I was a real bad kid, Dean,” Just as he opened his mouth to protest, Cas raised a hand, stopping him in his tracks, “No, I was, I know I was, I made myself the problem. Always. There were a lot of bad homes I got placed in, I won’t lie about that, places where the children acted like the adults and where the adults acted like the children, where I had to fight and toughen up just to have a full belly at the end of the day. But there were a lot of good places too, families who lived in white-picket fenced homes, who looked just as nice on the outside as they were on the in, and there were some people that really tried to help the messed-up foster kid who they hoped could change with time. But I never gave them a chance, I made their lives hell because I wasn’t and never would be their kid, I was
It was as if they were both touch starved, Castiel’s hand rested on his knee the entire way back, the Omega sitting as close as possible to Cas by the Alpha’s kitchen island as they ate the pizza they had ordered for dinner. Slow drags of skin against skin, Dean feeling a different kind of hunger as he gazed at his Alpha as if he wanted to be wrapped up and held in his Cas’s embrace for always.
Althoguh, as the Alpha notes staring at his watch for the millionth time that night, there were only thirty freaking more minutes left and the Omega hadn't even come out on stage as of yet, even though his name was clearly printed in the programme, and what put the Alpha more on edge was the fact that he had been set to have come out at least halfway during the show already.
“I should probably head out, it's getting late.” Dean mutters out as he pushes himself up and away from the heat of Cas's body. Getting off the bed, he starts to pull on his jeans from earlier.
From the moment the Omega had said goodbye to Cas when boarding that fucking metal death trap of a plane, to finally landing in Paris and getting started with his one-month long schedule of shows and shoots, he had felt wired up and all twisted up inside, like he was in a perpetual state of being at war with his emotions, never able to pin down how he was feeling before another took its place.
If John wanted to speak with him he would go, listen to what he had to say, and leave. Simple as that. If John wanted to play this game of cat and mouse, seeing who would get the upper hand in the end, who would be the one in the higher position of power, he could play it all by himself.
Soon he was moving his hand lower again, deliberate in taking it slow, caressing the tense lines of Cas’s muscles, which strained where they were working to keep him hovering just so over the singer. His heart seemed to jump out of his chest when he got to what was definitely Cas’s happy trail, the man’s own ministrations, whilst no less arousing, being forgotten for the moment as his mind zeroed in on a much more important appendage he was dying to explore right then.
He never realized how starved he actually was until the last of his fries were gone, along with all the onion rings and the cheese burger, fingers poised above the basket to grab for food that was already gone.
The door clicking shut and with that Dean finally sinks into an easy, dreamless sleep for the first time since he boarded that flight that took him away from his Alpha.
“She got married eventually. Had the built in husband and kids she was always chasing. I don’t remember much about
“O-kay, so what do they want then?” Dean was slightly confused, wasn't that how the whole 'get to know you' life stories of people like him went? He knew if it was
Finally, almost fucking shyly the singer stutters over his words as he says, “Didn't say that, I mean I might, I was thinking about it...I guess...Just to see if he’s okay, least I can do.”
It's while they're lying in bed, Dean using Cas's arm to pillow his head, body turned on his side against the Alpha as Cas runs the fingers of his hand through Dean's hair when he hears the Alpha's voice ask, “What made you go into modelling?”
Dean finally looks away, and looking up at the ceiling instead he says, “Guess you have a logical point there. But I dunno, don't think love's supposed to be about logic ya know? You just do what feels right I guess and besides, that shit's not supposed to be taken literally, him buyin' earrings an' all.
“Right, yes, sorry about that. Please, follow me.” She turns back to what looks to be a dressing room as she continues, “I'm Dean's manager, he mentioned you'd be here tonight.” As way of explanation to who she is.
An unexpected warmth washes over him hearing Dean's words though, a sense of freedom he didn't even know he was looking for. A freedom in having somebody not confining his character to the way he should be stringing his words together whenever he spoke, instead of taking a second to try and understand what he meant by them and not by only by how it sounds.
Cas was a looming presence over him, and Dean was a vocal mess, moaning and whimpering as pulses of pleasure kept him on the edge. He knew once they came together it would be intense, but fuck, this was something else, more akin to an explosion that had erupted, heat building and bubbling until they were both suffocated under the pressure.
He pastes on his biggest smile to try and down play his actions and thoughts, even though he knows Cas can see right through it as one dark brow rises at his odd behaviour.
The Omega doesn't exactly regret his decision, knowing he could just play it off as being the first song that came to mind if Cas comments on it, but he somehow knew that Cas would see through the obvious lie, because that was what it would be if he went with that reasoning. Truth was, Dean had just made a proposition of his own to the Alpha, asking him to accept the Omega as he was, broken parts and all, and hoping he'd be the one to help Dean out of the dark pit that had slowly started to drag and weigh him down through the years. And Dean could admit he was scared shitless, not knowing what Cas's response to this would be or if it was too much too soon for the Alpha.
“Well, you know that I'm a great judge of character, and if I think you're one of the best people I've met, and probably would ever meet, then you have no problem with trying to impress this Cas fellow with any false show of who you really are. And besides, if he already figured what a catch you were without any of that bullshit and wants something more serious, judging by that mark you been trynna hide from me all day," Jo pointing to the area where the mark the Alpha placed there was still very much prominent when all the cover-up was washed  away, "I'd say give him a shot, Dean. And if things don't work out, then they don't and that would be his loss.” Jo says with joyous enthusiasm to try and erase the morose tension their conversation dived into, while the Omega's hand subconsciously rubs over the covered mark on his neck.
exactly he was supposed to go about making his intentions known, especially now that he found himself in this precarious what? fuck buddy? friends with benefits? whatever this relationship he had going on with Dean for the past month was.
