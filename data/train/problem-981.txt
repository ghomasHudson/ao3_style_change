“Alex, hang on a minute,” John calls to the boy before he can dash out the door.  He gestures to the chair opposite him.
Sherlock’s propped up in a sitting position on the far side of the bed, long legs prominent under the duvet, his face angled down at his phone. As soon as John strides in and makes his way to the couch to rummage through his bag, the detective looks up from the screen, pinkens through the cheeks, and then glances away nervously, busying himself with plugging his mobile into the charger cord on the nightstand.  John takes this opportunity for the godsend that it is, drops his towel and heaves himself into his pajama bottoms as quickly as he can manage.  The noise on the other side of the room stops and John resolutely refuses to consider whether it’s because Sherlock saw him naked or specifically
but if it was then, you need to be careful with it and let me treat it for the swelling.  And I can’t know if that’s the case unless you let me look at the damn thing.”
John’s speak grinds to a halt when the exam room door swings open and a tall woman with golden hair pulled back into queue at the back of her head and clad in pink scrubs slips inside.  Unfortunately, John’s mind sticks on the words he’d been about to say just prior to her entrance.  What had he been about to call Sherlock?  It hadn’t been his name, it had been a title that was ready to roll off of his tongue.  But … what could he have possibly meant to say?  Surely not “daddy” – that was John, obvious – and definitely not “god-father”; Sherlock was the only one to refer to himself as such.  It’s an accurate term, yes, but John never used it because it seemed so inadequate to encompass what Sherlock is to John and to Rosie.  So what had he meant to say?  John shakes his head to clear it when he realizes that both the doctor and Sherlock are staring at him.
A/N - Screw it, I can't wait until tomorrow.  This chapter took a lot of energy out of me and I think it's one of the best things I've ever written.  But I won't lie, guys, the end of it is
toy because something – or everything – about it would arouse you enough that you knew it would make you come the hardest and the fastest.”
She shifts around a bit, throwing more indistinct noises over the receiver, before Sherlock hears a gruff grunt that is most definitely Mycroft.  Sherlock shudders.
Delivering a particularly well-aimed elbow to Sherlock’s ribcage, John relishes Sherlock’s “oof!” a little more than he should, jigging Rosie up and down and making a few soothing noises when she startles and starts to cry a bit at the jostling.
“Oh!” John blurts, and this time the tone of surprise isn’t manufactured.  He’d momentarily forgotten why he came in here in the first place.  “Sorry, could you, um …?”
John tries not to sigh as he prepares to give her the Not His Area speech that he’s given to dozens of other women instantly enamored with the detective and his bloody cheekbones, but when John refocuses his attention on the doctor, there is an unmistakable spark of interest in her eyes and Sherlock is not the target.  John’s Pulling Smile – as Mary had jokingly called it – leaps to his face without thought.
“Captured,” Sherlock amends.  “They believed I was a spy from a rival syndicate and tortured me for information which I didn’t have.  They refused to believe I didn’t have it, I admit, because I did my usual performance and made them all look like morons inside two minutes of capture.”

“You’re lying,” John says before Sherlock has even finished the denial.  “I can see it in your face.”
For whatever reason, it does the trick.  Sherlock wakes like a lightning strike, thrashing against John’s tight hold on him, his eyes snapping open and wheeling around the room in panic.
“Nope,” John cuts in.  “However capricious you are with your needs for pedestrian things like food and sleep, you’ve never stopped me from treating actual injuries before.  Except that ever since I moved back in here, you haven’t let me have a proper look at anything.  Why?”
Sherlock tries to make the few steps away look casual, however John can tell that they’re anything but.  John stalks after him until Sherlock’s back bumps against the desk.  The detective never answers John’s question but when he gives Sherlock his best I’m-former-military-don’t-you-dare-fuck-with-me icy glare, Sherlock relents and stops fleeing.  He overtly refrains from aiding John, though, when the doctor reaches for the shirt buttons just below Sherlock’s throat.  In fact, he does so little to get out of John’s way as John strips the shirt off of him that John actually has to yank the offending garment from Sherlock’s shoulders.  The other man flinches but continues to stare holes in the opposite wall of the flat.  Starting a bit when John brings his hands up, Sherlock compresses his lips and remains silent as John prods at the join as gingerly as he can with nimble fingers.
“Did she say that—?” John begins, then gives a fake put-upon sigh. “Of course she didn’t, you’ll have guessed—”
For a second, John’s hackles rise but the look on Sherlock’s face is so superior and offended that John can’t help but dissolve into giggles as he flops back onto the sofa.  After a moment, Sherlock joins him, both in the laughter and the sofa.  Tilting his head to gaze at his friend, John notes that despite his defense of his physical health, there’s a light sheen of perspiration on Sherlock’s brow and his chest rises and falls with rapid breaths. It’s much warmer than normal for late June, so between the weather and hauling boxes, it’s enough to make John’s t-shirt stick to his back between the shoulders, but Sherlock barely looks like he’s broken a sweat unless you really look hard. The detective still gazes up at the ceiling with a smile on his lips as he speaks.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow and smirks just a tiny bit.  “You see, I was just getting to a crucial moment, so ….”
all this time puts him in a foul sulk.  Sherlock doesn’t return for a full seven hours, which John only knows because he’s still staring angrily at the ceiling at 5am when the downstairs flat door opens and closes with a muted click.  Obviously he’s now moved on from stroppy teenager to jealous housewife, which only makes him even surlier.  Unable to chase away his black mood even after a good sleep, John can’t shake a feeling of general discomfiture until he sees Ella three days later.
“Do you love me, Sherlock?” John asks bluntly, surprised at his own composure.  A long, tremulous moment passes and John begins to worry that maybe he’d got it wrong.
“I have to … I need a minute,” John gabbles and can’t stop himself from dashing out of the room, up the stairs and behind his bedroom door where it all feels so much less earth-shattering.  He braces his back against the door, slides to the ground, and tries to just focus on breathing until he can stop feeling like he’s going to shatter into pieces.
The detective straightens.  “Modifications, John.  I could hardly have volatile chemicals or decaying body parts sitting out where Rosie could reach them, so I rented the basement flat from Mrs. Hudson and set up my experiments downstairs.”  Whatever Sherlock sees on John’s face in that moment brings a high flush to his cheeks, causing the detective to mumble, “Wouldn’t want to waste valuable materials and specimens.”
“I understand why you have questions, John.  You may as well ask,” Sherlock replies in a carefully neutral voice.
Clearing his throat, Sherlock pastes an entirely transparent expression of boredom on his features but conspicuously fails to meet John’s eyes.  “You know I do love to be congratulated.”
John throws a glance over his shoulder where Sherlock has turned to regard him, Rosie in one arm and a pair of tiny coveralls thrown over the other.  “We don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to,” he says delicately, “but I’m willing to listen if you do.”
And somehow, John finds that’s exactly what he needed to hear.  Sherlock knew it, without John even knowing it himself.
John’s positive this isn’t really what Sherlock means to say.  The air in the tiny room feels alight with tension and anticipation and John’s entire focus narrows to the two stretches of skin beneath his fingers: his daughter’s warm belly as she perches on his knee and Sherlock’s long, smooth fingers.  Despite the hum of energy crowding around him, John smiles.
Baker Street works.  Sherlock becomes a much more regular, even enthusiastic, minder for Rosie, seeming to be genuinely delighted in coaching her through various cognitive and physical milestones – although he is violently opposed to the milestones associated with teething; little wonder – and regales John with stories of their activities during each day that he spends at the clinic, away from Baker Street.  Only a few days a week, but John still aches for the things he’s missing that Sherlock gets to see with Rosie.  That being said, he’s certainly glad that the person who is seeing them is someone who loves her; John knows that in no uncertain terms.  In the months John and Rosie have lived at Baker Street, Sherlock staunchly refuses to take any case, be it from Lestrade or his email, which ranks over a five.  John only presses him on it once, being flabbergasted into silence when Sherlock explains.
“Right,” John says and drops his gaze to his lap.  “Right.  Of course.  Sorry, didn’t mean to … overstep.  Although if I’m even mostly right about why you chose what you chose, that does leave some questions about why you were so enamored with Irene Adler.  Unless she—”
He hears her give a small, throaty chuckle.  “Yes, I’d imagine.  I have a case for you that ought to do just nicely.  I was going to send one of my people, but if you need the excuse, it’s yours.  Out in Dursley, so a good few hours away and if you leave around tea time tomorrow, it’ll give you a good reason to stay the night. Something more admin than chasing, I’m afraid, but that sounds like just what you’re looking for.”
“A common ailment of the desperately long-limbed, I’m afraid,” Sherlock muses, then slides a slick smirk to John.  “Not that you’d know anything about that.”
“Sherlock,” John says with more conviction, waiting until the detective gazes up from the monitor to continue.  “What’s wrong?  You were even more disagreeable than usual on the train—”
Below is a timeline of when things happen in season 4, as best I could work it out, and with notes on where I plan to go in my series --- hopefully this will spark your interest in future vignettes.  Whenever something is marked as "(ish)" on the month, it means there is no direct reference in canon and I did my best to guess or extrapolate based on time lapse.
Sherlock actually lets out a little whimper he seems incapable off stifling and turns his head away.  His chest heaves and he’s clearly struggling to keep his breath even.
Sherlock smiles indulgently.  “You poke fun but that sounds like an excellent plan to me.  Perhaps you could learn to garden, John.”
John notices that the circular ones trail most of the way down his hips and disappear under the waist of his trousers.  With sudden, horrifying clarity, John has another suspicion and he dreads having it confirmed.  A textbook submission method.
“Mary,” John breathes.  His hands shake and his vision starts to go wavy at the corners.  That video is the only thing in his head right now, playing behind his eyes, telling him that Sherlock is in love with him in his dead wife’s voice.  “Oh, God, she was right.
– while Rosie gums at some teething biscuits in her high chair next to him.  Despite Sherlock’s disdain, he’s fairly proud of himself for managing to wrangle a ridiculously sensational case into relatively unembellished language.  Sherlock reads it over his shoulder, huffing and eye-rolling and pretending not to be chuffed to come off like a cross between Indiana Jones and James Bond.  As a result of Sherlock’s good spirits, they enjoy a lovely, leisurely evening of dinner at Angelo’s and a nice ramble around Regent’s Park with Rosie charming all the nearby patrons in the restaurant as she shows them all her new stuffed tiger that Sherlock bought her – he’s a bit puffed up with his own cleverness; it’s going to take ages for John to deflate his ego over this one.  They’re just strolling past the Open Air Theater, Sherlock nattering on about the recent production of Oliver Twist, when a muffled moan comes from Sherlock’s pocket.  John glances from pocket to detective to pocket again, noting with no little amount of exasperation the rosy flush that suffuses his friend’s high cheekbones.  Sherlock ignores it, his face studiously blank, but the corner of his eye twitches as two more moans float out from the depths of the Belstaff in rapid succession.
Sherlock unfolds one arm from under the drape of the Belstaff and offers his hand with a flat, almost challenging look on his face.  “Sherlock Holmes,” he says in a voice that is higher and smoother than his normal tone.  John’s eyebrows wing up.
He actually chuckles, which draws Sherlock’s eyes back to his face.  John’s cheeks are pink but that could be from the steaming bath water.  God, he doesn’t know, he can’t seem to process because his brain just won’t
“Hey,” John says sternly and puts a hand on the boy’s forearm.  “Don’t talk like that.  First of all, as a doctor, it’s my responsibility and my
“Kathryn Simon, pleasure,” she says in a bright, nasal accent that he places as East Coast American.  He was stationed with a bloke from upstate New York who sounded just like her.   She bends to regard the little girl now glaring at her with heavy suspicion from under her blonde lashes.
A/N - please take note of the change in rating for this chapter.  *winky eyes* It's about to get sexy all up in this piece.  Also, in this chapter, you'll see my take on what Sherlock's sexuality actually is.  I didn't want to tag it at the beginning of the story because it would "give away" a major plot point but I have adjusted the tags accordingly now; shouldn't be anything that triggers anyone (there's nothing traumatic about it, just that I know Sherlock's sexuality is a much-debated/theorized issue in the fandom) but I didn't want to give anything away.  And as you'll see ... my John is a bit of a cock tease.  Sorry not sorry.  ^_^
“For fuck’s sake, Sherlock!” John rages, being decidedly rougher than he should be when placing the line of stitches just above Sherlock’s right hip curving up and back towards his ribs.  The gash is worryingly long but not deep.  “Do you
written referrals for things like that.  Jesus,” John pinches at the bridge of his nose with his free hand and tries not to let his voice falter, “Jesus, I’ve become the sort of father who needs a Child Protection referral against him.”
Sherlock’s stomach drops away and he stares at John.  The doctor stiffens suddenly, as if he’s only just realized what he’s said, and although his facial expression doesn’t change, his voice sounds controlled.
Laughing again, Sherlock strides into the sitting room, bending to stack a few of the smaller boxes one on top of the other on the coffee table.  “Mmmm,” he mutters, arranging things in a pattern completely incomprehensible to anyone but Sherlock.  “It never occurred to you to question why I can chase criminals all over the city and still be able to hold my own in a fight?  Obviously I must be training at
“Good morning, John,” he says in his deep rumble that is a bit rough from sleep.  He’s graceful even now, with pillow creases on his cheek and a riot of bed hair, as he levers himself up to mirror John’s posture against the headboard.
When his heart starts beating again, he manages to say, “Okay,” before he crosses the room and begins to seat himself in the rocker.
– as he props himself up on one elbow to regard John’s wall-eyed gaze.  “John, were you intending to stay and watch me finish?”
The fond smiles from John have become increasingly frequent in the five months since John and Rosie have made Baker Street their home, and particularly since the events of the anniversary of Mary’s death … which is what has Sherlock baffled.  With the obvious exception of the presence of a toddler and subsequent need for a babysitter, not much changes in regards to the way John and Sherlock relate to each other in the months following the anniversary of Mary’s death.  At least, nothing
Sherlock sounds panicked now, gulping and gasping, his limbs beginning to thrash with the effort.  There’s nothing for it, John needs to wake him immediately.  He grips the detective’s shoulders tight and gives him a few firm but controlled shakes.
“Darling,” he huffs, “when I said ‘would you like to show Sherlock what a wonderful bee you are’, I meant ‘once Daddy puts his dressing gown on’.”
John grins.  “Good.  Because with me declaring myself just now, this would have been awkward as arse if you’d said no.”
“I—what?”  Two solid minutes to recover and this is all he can come up with.  In his defense, though,
Scoffing loudly, John stares him down.  “You know, Sherlock, just because I’m not as observant as you are doesn’t mean I don’t see and it doesn’t mean I don’t understand you.”
John smirks at her back as the door clicks shut.  He turns to regard Sherlock and pulls up short at the expression on his friend’s face.  There’s something sharp in the blue-green eyes, something that makes John’s pulse hammer in his throat until Rosie bleats at him from her place in the little supportive chair that they placed her in on the exam table.  John’s legs wobble a bit when he gets up to retrieve her.     They stay quiet for a long moment after John has cuddled Rosie in his lap but eventually John has to ask, “So what was all that with you taking the blame for the tea?”
Scoffing, John replies, “Come on, Sherlock, I’ve seen you use your appearance, your sexuality, as a tool before.  Mostly on women involved with cases, but I’ve also seen you use it on Molly before.  You know you’re good-looking, you know you have sex appeal.  You choose not to engage it in a practical sense and that’s fine but that doesn’t mean that those qualities wouldn’t transfer over to men.  You could pull if you wanted to, you just don’t.”
.  But don't let that scare you away because there is some serious awesomeness in here too and some fun sexiness as well.
Although he’s a bit ashamed that he’s avoiding this conversation with a not-quite-two-year-old, John hitches her up from his lap and settles her back into the pushchair.
Sherlock gives an exaggerated eye roll that reminds him forcefully of his toddler.  “I’m not hiding anything, I simply have no desire for your particular brand of molly-coddling over nothing.”
John nods and Sherlock turns to leave.  Just as he’s crossing the threshold into his room, he hears a great splash of water that follows John getting out of the tub.  A wavy outline of John’s nude body appears in front of the frosted glass door which Sherlock shuts with a hasty snap.
John leans a hip against the arm of the sofa, crosses his arms over his chest, and favors his friend with a skeptical glare.  “Is that so?”
“You’re right, of course,” Sherlock says quietly.  “Accidents happen.  We’re all only just human, right?”
“Right.   Right!” John says, jumping a bit as he kicks into motion.  “Sorry, I just—” As he casts his eyes away from the bed, they catch on a manila folder sitting atop Sherlock’s dresser.  John’s legs wobble beneath him as he skirts along the side of the room to snatch it up.  “Sorry.  Rosie’s medical records.  I was.  Looking for them.  I’ll just—” He flails one hand back towards the flat door.  “Go then.  To work.  Sorry.”
“Goodnight, Rosie,” Sherlock answers, smiling just a bit when the girl waves to him over John’s shoulder as he climbs the stairs.  He waggles his fingers in the air in response and can’t help but grin when she favors him with a slightly slobbery smile in response.
“I do,” John says smugly.  “Because I know you, Sherlock.  If you chose that particular thing, you chose it because it’s shaped like a cock, not in spite of it.  And
Rosie nods then yawns loudly, her eyelids drooping as she leans forward against Sherlock’s chest.  “Nap,” Sherlock mutters and practically scurries away to his bedroom where they’d placed an extra bassinet for her to nap in while they were downstairs working on cases.
Sherlock screeches to a halt, both verbally and physically, and he can feel the redness climb from his chest to his face as he stares.  And stares.  And he can’t seem to do much more than that, despite the scrambling going on in front of him.  He just clutches the knob of the loo door and blinks in surprise.
Sherlock keeps his gaze fixed on Rosie and jigs her up and down in his arms.  “Yes, darling,” Sherlock stumbles over the endearment, “Papa loves Daddy.  Very much.”
“No time like the present,” he murmurs.  And really, Rosie did unwittingly give him the perfect opening for it.  The tea can wait.
Rolling onto his right side, John now stares a hole in the door across the room.  “Goodnight, Sherlock,” he says.
“And you…?” the doctor asks, clasping his hand and giving it the same attention as she had the other two people in the room but her eyes flicker back to John.
“I … yes, of course,” Sherlock says quietly, clearly baffled at the abrupt shift.  He starts towards the desk to retrieve his instrument but a hand touches his chest and he starts to stoop towards his discarded shirt.
“A few things,” the detective responds.  “But those details are … private.”  Sherlock finds he has to clear his throat again.
John feels his own eyes water as Rosie clutches his fingers and turns her face into Sherlock’s damp palm.  The detective bends and murmurs to her for another few minutes, his voice rasping a bit when Rosie presses her damp cheek to his.  As the water trickles over her shoulder and John counts the minutes, Sherlock speaks soothingly and eyes John.
John squats down in front of her chair and secures her coat and mittens before pressing her stuffed tiger into her grip.  “Now listen, young lady, that’s private and you’d better keep it to yourself.”
to be so antagonistic when you’re determined to be clever?  I realize that you can’t stand not to demonstrate how brilliant you are, but could you at least refrain from
“—and now you want to spend an evening at a bed-and-breakfast in the middle of nowhere for a case you could solve inside two hours?”
John smiles because this is normally the part where he would give some teasing response that would hook her interest as he scrawled her number on a slip from his pocket.  But his eyes flicker back to the disappearing Belstaff and he can’t seem to find the anticipation he would have felt once upon a time.
He has a moment of complete and unadulterated panic that Sherlock has found him out on his recent epiphany – although said epiphany somehow hadn’t progressed to something like this – but then he regroups enough to realize that Sherlock is no doubt asking why in hell John interrupted what seems to be a rather spectacular wank session.
“No, you’re not,” Sherlock cuts through.  When John makes to get up again, Sherlock pushes down on his shoulder and the gesture is decidedly less gentle.  John sits.  He watches Sherlock go to the sink and mimic John’s movements, sluicing water over Rosie’s shoulder, neck, chest, and anywhere he thinks the tea might have splashed her, murmuring all the while.  Eventually, she stops sobbing and trails off into whimpering sniffles.
“Oh, yeah,” John says as casually as he can manage, “that’s my daughter and her mum,” he words it this way very deliberately and refuses to examine why he avoids using the word ‘wife’, “—but here let me show you—”
His eyes take in the scene even though his brain still has trouble processing it: Rosie in one end of the tub with streaks of blue and red paint running from her hair down across her sturdy little chest; the girl slapping her palms on the surface of the water and laughing delightedly at the columns of spray that splash around her; dappled bubbles that have mostly dissipated from the surface of the bath water; bubbles which don’t manage to cover the metres
“Can’t you just take off the damn shirt?” John growls, desperate to change the subject.  “You’re not exactly modest and I can’t get a good look at what I’m doing if I don’t have good lighting.  Why the hell would you insist on keeping it on anyway?”
“And you didn’t sign on for recovering, often relapsing, drug addict who shoots holes in walls, keeps body parts next to the butter, and has siblings with dubious or completely absent moral structures.  And yet—” Sherlock mimics John’s gesture to his moving cartons, “—here we are again.”
“I—” Alex turns his face towards the other side of the room before answering.  “Just a few times.  Not all that much but … I mean, it isn’t completely new.”
“I—what?  No!”  There.  More than one word.  It seems like progress.  Although his ruby-red cheeks probably aren’t doing him any favors.
Sherlock’s deep rumble wobbles and the realization that Sherlock is attempting to stifle sobs horrifies John.
A few tears threaten at the corners of his eyes so John squeezes the lids shut.  “Don’t ever hide yourself from me again.  Promise me.”
The muffled thump of Rosie’s hands clapping together echoes in John’s ears.  She’s clearly pleased with herself as she regards his face, tapping his lips once more for emphasis.
Sherlock’s fingers come up to massage the bridge of his nose; he can feel a headache building in the tension just under his fingertips.  “Because I’m not even sure that is the right term for me.”
The heavy brows wrinkle in consternation.  “You’ve done it dozens of times before and never gotten this bothered by it.  Why is this one so different?”
The detective’s watercolor eyes mist a bit as he crosses the room back towards where John and Rosie occupy the center. The little girl bats at dust motes floating in the crack of sunshine streaming in from the window.  Sherlock raises a finger and traces the soft curve of her chubby cheek, earning a giggle in return.
Sherlock debates prolonging the conversation, trying to issue some sort of apology, but decides it’s probably a better idea to just let John use the silence and the distraction of the Work to cool his head a bit.  Reapplying himself to the data, Sherlock barely notices the passing of hours as he clacks away at the keyboard, only pausing here and there to look over the ledgers that John silently lays next to his computer.  Somewhere around 10:45 or so, Sherlock twists his neck this way and that, massaging out the stiffness in the muscles with his fingertips and gazing around the room, baffled to find it completely dark but for the single lamp John has turned on over the desk he occupies.  He’s similarly bewildered to find John polishing off the remnants of some chips in a takeaway container, grinning at him with a lopsided smirk.
Now - one of the biggest things I had to do when setting out an outline of what I wanted to write was put down a timeline.  Why?  Well, because since there's such a huge gap between each of the series' of the show, sometimes it's effing hard to keep straight when things happen, especially since they don't always give exact dates/times in the episodes.  Also, please note that I've done a lot of research recently on when canon birthdays happen.  Anything noted below in my timeline with an exact date is the exact canon date that it happens (either in BBC Sherlock canon or, as far as birthdays are concerned, in ACD canon).  Characters' ages are taken directly from Sherlock canon - in The Great Game, Sherlock mentions that Carl Powers happened in 1989 when he was 9 years old, therefore he was born in 1980 and is 30 years old at the start of the series in 2010.  John was more trouble, as I
“Would hardly be good for a growing child if I was clambering around just under her bedroom all hours of the night,” Sherlock says as if he’s a completely reasonable person who has always had sensible personal habits.  “Toddlers thrive on routine, you know, John.”
“Just so I know, Alex,” John says, “have you been sexually active before or was this a totally new experience?”
with Sherlock’s … humanity.  Although now that the evidence pushes against his bum, he can’t help but recall the last time he became acquainted with said humanity.  A flash of that image comes back to him; on the back of his eyelids, he sees the vision of Sherlock’s body bowing off his bed as he stroked at his weeping cock, head thrown back and moaning.  The vision absolutely does not help John’s situation, given that when John shifts anxiously, Sherlock’s arm tightens at John’s waist and he gives an involuntary little rock of his hips as he moves with John.  A strangled noise ekes out of John’s throat and he claps a hand over his mouth to stifle it.  Sherlock murmurs something unintelligible and nuzzles his nose into the hollow under John’s chin.
John grinds his teeth.  “Might as well see what she’s said,” he prompts with an acidic smile, trying to keep his voice even.  “She seems insistent.  After all, High Wycombe isn’t that long a cab ride at this time of night.”
“Twelve hours,” John spits.  “Christ, you’d been beaten and broken and it was all still raw and I just—you just let me—?! Jesus, will I ever stop brutalizing you?”
Sherlock just nods.  Rosie raises her hand and pats John’s lips.  She begins to say something but John cuts her off by pressing a kiss to her lips.  His face flushes and he gives Sherlock a tight smile as he prompts Rosie, “Say goodnight, love.”
John glares up at him and spits back without thinking.  “Because someday your luck is going to run out, Sherlock.  I’ve had to watch you die right under my fingers twice now, I’m damn well not going to do it again. Someday you’ll insult another nutter with a gun just a shade too much and it’ll be
Seemingly unperturbed, Dr. Simon nods and answers, “Superficial epidermal burns on her arm and chest – swelling and redness mostly reduced by the cool water and paracetamol you gave her, so good thinking – and a relatively superficial dermal burn at the juncture of her neck.  It’s the dermal burn that’s a bit more concerning given that it penetrates deeper, obviously, and the fact that it’s blistering, but given that it’s been about three hours since the initial incident and there’s no further swelling or profusion of blisters, I’d say it’s likely that she won’t have any lingering effects.”  She strips off and disposes of her nitrile gloves, binning them and leaning against the count to regard them both.  “I applied some lidocaine cream, which I will give you to take with you, and I’ll write you a script for it, but she probably won’t need it that long.  Potential for a small scar at the juncture of her neck where the burn is the worst, but nothing too horrible if it does scar.  She should be just fine.”
“Sorry,” John says as he hoists Rosie up on his right hip but the jovial tone dies on his lips almost immediately.
Sherlock scoffs with a smile.  “As if I’d be able to fall asleep in the twelve and a half minutes it takes you to bathe.”
Sherlock doesn’t attempt to contradict him – he was distracted, after all – but he does slide his long fingers in between John’s again, squeezing just enough for John to feel it.  John’s pulse hammers in his ears and he stares down at their joined fingers.  His voice comes out just above a whisper but it sounds too loud.
“Rosie and I decided to attempt finger painting this morning and really, I should have known better,” John says by way of an explanation.  “Apparently she decided my khaki trousers didn’t have enough color and dumped an entire cup of blue paint and half the red down the front of them before I could stop her.”
Mycroft arched one eyebrow, which was answer enough. “Hardly. It’s likely that the owner of said club is involved, possibly unintentionally, with the recent ritualistic murders, but it requires legwork.” He gave a small shudder.
He’s so bright, as though the sun has taken up residence within his hair and his eyes and his smile.
The woman was suspended upside-down on a spiked iron pentagram mounted to the alley wall. Suspended while still alive, according to Ella. Still alive when her heart was cut from her chest, while the blood poured out of her…
The words are whispered, but Sherlock hears them as though they were breathed directly into his ear. Without pause, he strides forward until John lifts a hand palm out, instructing him to stop mere feet away.
The property was as surprisingly small as the house. The yard was neat, with freshly cut grass that had clearly seen water on a daily basis, visible in the floodlights placed strategically around the walls and the yellow glow from the streetlamps. There were two palm trees growing to either side of the gate, and on either side of the door were well-trimmed rose bushes. It was all far too symmetrical, too clean for Sherlock’s tastes, but it screamed Mycroft at the top of its proverbial lungs.
The air is cold. He notices this in the way he often notices injury through adrenaline. He knows the pain is there, waiting with its sharp claws and eager fangs, but he cannot yet feel it. Curious, he opens his mouth and huffs a deliberate breath. Steam forms, writhes with brief life, and dissipates.
“Like they’re trying to get a certain someone’s attention?” Ella nodded. “Oh yeah. I think our own personal devil is gonna be
The building was enormous, but Sherlock found his way through halls and down a flight of stairs without much difficulty, John right on his heels. Mycroft was waiting for them at the base of said stairs, leaning on his umbrella. Next to him was a tall woman who was clearly the Lieutenant, and a shorter blond woman with a tight pony-tail and an expression that demanded no nonsense.
“I’m not talking to your brother because you can’t be bothered to turn your ringer on,” John insisted, shoving the phone into Sherlock’s chest.
Lestrade scrubbed a hand over his eyes, then abruptly plunged the same hand into his pocket for his phone. “Hang on, let me get a video…”
“I will give you the details tomorrow,” Mycroft said, apparently taking pity on him. “If you sleep.”
They were eating in the car, take-out boxes strewn over the dash and their laps. Chloe watched the steam rise from them for several seconds before she made herself look over at him. His brow was pinched into a tight frown. He was stabbing his noodles with his chopsticks, then stirring them rapidly until they looked a lot more like mush then food.
“Lucifer, of course I do,” she finally murmured. The whole devil metaphor he insisted on living in was confusing and, at times, overwhelming, but the gems of genuine Lucifer that she got to see made it worth it every time. She hoarded them like a dragon, becoming increasingly protective of them and him the more she received.
“Hm? What?” Lucifer blinked and managed to tip his head toward Maze, but didn’t tear his eyes away until she punched him in the shoulder. “Ow! What?”
A loud snore was his only answer. Chuckling, Sherlock adjusted John so he was slouched slightly in the seat, head resting as comfortably as it could against the top of the plastic chair, before leaving him to get them something to drink.
He wants to be held down and called a slut. He wants to be chased, naked and vulnerable, through the trees until John catches him. He wants to hear John praise him, wants fingers in his mouth and his arse and John’s cock down his throat. He wants to make John force his legs apart and then he wants to be held close while John slides inside him.
Sherlock ignored him. Typical. Sighing, John crossed his arms over his chest and leaned back against the wall. Mycroft hadn’t told them what this Lucifer Morningstar (that couldn’t be his real name, could it?) looked like, but he suspected Sherlock would know, anyway. Feeling a bit competitive, John started to make some deductions of his own, only to be distracted almost immediately by the way Sherlock tensed beside him, his eyes going wide.
“Well?” Chloe gestured toward the body. “Go on. Tell us how this is all about you. Get it out of your system.”
“I’m fine,” Sherlock snapped. He refused to look around the room and confirm his curiosity of this out of character place, and the even more out of character tray full of tea Mycroft had served himself. Not that it mattered—as much as he despised admitting it, Mycroft was, just a little, smarter than Sherlock himself. His lack of looking was just as much a giveaway as if he’d openly commented on the room.
John’s eyes widen. He stares down at Sherlock, his hips stutter and he cries out and oh, he just came, just the sight of Sherlock made him come and that’s all Sherlock needs.
“Sherlock,” John murmurs. He pulls in a stuttering breath and curls his hand fully around Sherlock’s cock, gives it the lightest squeeze and a single stroke. Sherlock gasps and flings his head back, staring sightlessly at the starless sky.
The drive back from the police station, the stop for lunch (where John had successfully gotten Sherlock to eat an entire chip—or fry, as the Americans called it), and the ridiculous amount of time it had taken Sherlock to get ready meant that it was getting dark by the time they ventured outside. The same driver was waiting for them by the gate, and for the first time John stopped to get a good look at him. He was young, early thirties at the most, with close-cropped black hair, hazel eyes, and jewel-toned, umber skin. Deep creases around his mouth and eyes said that he smiled easily and often, and he did so now as Sherlock and John slid into the back seat. One of his front teeth was slightly crooked so that it crossed over the other, a detail John likely wouldn’t have noticed before Sherlock. The small imperfection only highlighted the fact that he was very handsome.
“It’s worked out so far,” Sherlock muttered stiffly, but neither of them were paying attention to him.
“We need to find whoever did this and punish them immediately,” Lucifer growled through gritted teeth. “How humans got it into their minds that I’d grant them their desires in exchange for murder is beyond me.”
Dreams are not unusual to Sherlock. His mind is vivid, asleep or awake. Most are chaotic manifestations of cases, clues exploding and birthing new phoenixes of thought until he wakes on the verge of triumph. Rarely, they are memories of childhood, sweet and warm as sugary tea. He always wakes from those loose with a contentment that never lasts, that he gave up on keeping years ago.
Even if it does… he grasps John’s arms, digs his fingers in until John hisses and bends to nip his throat in retaliation.
John gave a single nod and marched toward the kitchen. Just before he disappeared, he leaned back and caught Sherlock’s gaze.
Maze gave a sort of shrug with her mouth and brows, tipping her head in acknowledgement. “I’d do him,” she admitted. “But pretty sure that one’s gay as hell.”
Without looking away, Lucifer took a sip from the whiskey glass he’d all but forgotten he was holding.
Sherlock’s grin grew. “This isn’t the first,” he said. Then he snapped up his coat collar and walked away, leaving John to sigh his frustrations and stomp after him.
“Not necessarily,” Sherlock said before Mycroft could respond. “It may be a coincidence, or he may be a target. I need more data.”
“Yeah, my partner drives me nuts,” Chloe said, chuckling. “But he is weirdly brilliant, and he makes me laugh, so I guess it evens out in the end.”
“Mr. Holmes?” The young man who’d driven them leaned out of the window and held out a rather old-fashioned looking, silver key. “This’ll get you in the gate. Key for the house is under the mat and your bags are already inside.”
“Mm.” Sherlock took the bottle and dropped it back on his clothes. “I used to have a certain look when I did cocaine. That look might be useful for a club setting.”
“We don’t have any leads yet,” Chloe said, ignoring the second half of his statement. Despite the fact that she knew they meant different things, she was heartily in agreement with the first half. “But hopefully they left some sort of evidence on the body.”
They fell quiet as Sherlock strode toward them, snapping his gloves off and shoving them into his pocket. He looked… pale, John noted with gut-wrenching relief. His gaze was somewhat vacant as he came to a stop beside John, refusing to make eye contact.
Fast is what he gets. The abrupt build-up of sensation is borderline painful, but it seems he likes that edge of danger because he only spreads his legs wider and arches into John’s hand, mouth open and chest heaving; there isn’t enough air, there never will be, John’s personal sun has burned it all away.
He risked a quick glance at Maze, just in time to watch her spot them. She arched one eyebrow, fought briefly for nonchalance and finally gave in to a smirk. “Okay, the tall one is hot.”
“Of course.” Mycroft waved a hand toward the kitchen. “Just through there, you’ll find three bedrooms down that hallway. The toilet is at the very end. Your things have been placed in the first room.”
Forget the British government—John was starting to suspect that Mycroft was the world government. As if the man needed to be any more terrifying.
They arrived at Minneapolis airport at 6:13p.m local time. John was fast asleep when the plane landed, and only partially woke when Sherlock shook his shoulder. Rolling his eyes (and smothering a smile), Sherlock slung an arm around John’s shoulders and hauled him off the plane. John’s head lolled against his bicep, and he muttered something soft and sleepy that even Sherlock’s sharp ears didn’t catch.
,” he said, and he could feel that smile curling into his lips, the one that made John look at him with equal parts fascination and worry.
The nine-hour flight from Heathrow to Minneapolis was dreadfully boring, and yet nowhere near as bad as it would have been by himself. John, as always, was fascinating enough to keep him occupied to the point that he didn’t desire drugs or sudden death to distract him. He seemed endlessly delighted with the steady supply of snacks and beverages (he’d already consumed three beers and seemed to have no intention of stopping any time soon), and two hours into the flight he began to egg Sherlock into deducing the passengers around them. Inhibitions loosened by alcohol, he laughed uproariously when Sherlock deduced the man four rows up and one over was fighting a losing battle with two bean burritos (not a difficult deduction by any means, but well worth John’s amusement).
“Every single one of them has a special room in Hell if they’re here for me,” Lucifer growled. “And even if they’re not, they still do. Now, if you’ll excuse me.”
Sherlock snorted softly. He didn’t see why everyone was so convinced he needed to be taken care of, anyway.
Sherlock blinks, and he’s staring at the ceiling of their flat. It isn’t grass beneath his back, but the rug in the sitting room. The heating is out, they were going to start a fire.
“Ah, yes, well, if it’s true, and remember that’s a big if… let’s just say it would definitely count as a horde.”
John shuddered and tore his eyes away, darting to the police tape and a nearby officer before finally coming to rest on the safety of Lestrade’s face. “He’s…” John swallowed. Gritted his teeth. “He’s aroused, Greg. He’s fucking aroused.”
“Straight to the club,” Sherlock said, and the driver gave a nod and straightened in his seat. Sherlock promptly ignored him, but John leaned forward over the bench seat.
The Lieutenant came over to pull Chloe aside, and Mycroft stepped into Chloe’s place, if not quite as close. “There, introductions made, alliances forged,” he said, sounding like a parent explaining something complex to a child in the simplest terms he could find. “Now, if you’ll follow me.”
John didn’t even blink. “They were very nice about it,” he said, shrugging one shoulder. He held out Sherlock’s cup. “Can’t say I blame them. Most employees don’t go running off to other countries without notice.”
“Mycroft wants us to go to the police station and meet some detectives we’ll be working with.” He spotted the bottle on the bed and came into the room without asking permission. He picked up the bottle and peered at the contents curiously. In the last several months he’d become increasingly more proprietary toward Sherlock and his belongings, and Sherlock wasn’t sure he appreciated the odd little thrill it gave him.
For a moment, Chloe was as overwhelmed as she had been at the first crime scene. One of these was bad enough, but this many people killed in such a painful way, in only a week, and so many suspects—the murders were spread out over thirteen states to start, none of them far enough apart in time to have been committed by the same person, so they were looking at a minimum of thirteen killers in America alone, likely more. How long had this been developing? Had they killed before, had they… rehearsed this? She’d encountered Satanists, but they were almost always either harmless or kids with grand ideas that got out of hand. This was organized, efficient—these were believers, in the most dangerous sense of the word.
“This is the boring bit.” Lucifer waved his hand at the paperwork now strewn all over Ella’s workspace. “I’ll be back tomorrow!”
Heaving a put-upon sigh, Sherlock downed his tea in three swallows and slammed the cup down, holding back just enough to keep it from actually shattering.
A man in an all-black suit stood behind the rope. He was oddly pale in comparison to the various shades of tan and dark skin being shown off to varying degrees in the long line (works nights, doesn't get out much during the day, said a voice in John's mind that sounded disturbingly like Sherlock). He had a crew cut and a stern face, made all the more stern by a square jaw and posture that screamed prior military service. This did exactly nothing to deter Sherlock, who bypassed the line and jumped right over the rope before the man could stop him. Sighing, John picked up his pace. He arrived just in time to hear Sherlock drop Mycroft’s name, and for the man to step back.
Sherlock wants to speak, but his tongue is heavy in his mouth. He is a cold thing, a creature of the mind; there is no room for John outside The Work, yet the sight of his golden friend leaves him aching to be brought into his body.
“Nope, no wallet, no keys, nothing under her nails, there aren’t even any signs of a struggle!” Ella twirled her hand over the body and struck a pose, like a magician about to reveal the final act. “She has some bruising around her throat and that’s it. So, it looks like someone grabbed her with one hand.” Ella spread her gloved hand out a few inches above the victim’s throat. “And just WHAM! Slammed her right onto the spikes.”
Sherlock woke a little after seven. He’d slept nude just to spite Mycroft, and now he wrapped himself in the sheet and padded barefoot into the kitchen. The light was already on, and John was leaning back against the countertop, barefoot, rubbing the palm of his hand into his eyes as he yawned. To his right, the old, iron kettle was just beginning to emit steam, and two of the tea cups from last night were already waiting on the counter.
“Prat,” John shot back, grinning openly. He softly thumped Sherlock in the thigh with his foot. “I’m only five years older than you, you know.”
Sherlock exchanged a quick glance with John, who gave the tiniest of nods. “Mm,” Sherlock hummed, which Mycroft would assume was a reluctant agreement.
As it turned out, they weren’t staying in a hotel. Instead, they were dropped off on the outskirts of the city, outside an iron gate, complete with spikes on top and an ornate lock shaped like the head of Poseidon. A six-foot brick wall encircled the property, but Sherlock could see a house through the bars of the gate—also made of brick, neat and well kept, but surprisingly small, if it did indeed belong to Mycroft.
Sherlock failed to mention where the cab was taking them until it dropped them off at Heathrow Airport—at which point there was no longer a need to mention it. He might have forgotten to mention it, anyway, considering he’d spent the ride trading rapid fire texts with Lestrade and growing more excited by the minute.
“Mm.” The corner of Sherlock’s mouth ticked slightly upward, and he returned his gaze to the window.
Chloe opened her mouth but by then he was gone, and she wound up letting out a sigh and an exasperated chuckle instead. How he could be so passionate one moment and childish the next was beyond her. It frustrated the hell out of her at times, but the more she got to know him, the more she suspected it might be a kind of coping mechanism. That or just an underdeveloped maturity level.
“Dreadfully boring,” John agreed, grinning openly. “I’m going to make toast and eggs. You’re going to eat some.”
Maze seemed torn between irritation at the potential Hell breakout and intrigue. She kept asking Lucifer to describe the photos to her and looking just a tad too turned on for his tastes—at least, until he informed her that at least some of those people, of not most of them, were innocents. She’d been here long enough now, made enough friends (which was still the oddest thought) that she abruptly went silent and started handling her knives a little too much for comfort.
“I’m going to throw you into traffic! Clothes, Sherlock. Packing. It’s a thing that needs to be done before one goes somewhere!”
Taking a seat at the edge of the couch closest to the kitchen, Mycroft poured a golden tea into a white cup with yellow roses around the edge, and added two sugars. He placed it on the opposite side of the coffee table, then poured another cup and sat back. Sherlock wasn’t fooled—Mycroft normally put three sugars in his tea, and four in his coffee. He was on another diet, then.
There was a man’s body, naked, displayed on an inverted pentagram so that his head was aligned with the downward point, and his limbs were splayed to touch the tips of the remaining four. There was the fact that the pentagram was constructed of iron and spikes, and that the man had been alive and conscious when he was forced down onto them—as he had been when they cut out his heart. It was at that point in his examination that John was forced to step away before he threw up all over the crime scene.
They made it a whole hour without any sort of devil talk before Lucifer, between mouthfuls of noodles, said, “You know I’d never ask someone to hurt another innocent human, right?”
Lestrade was standing beside him now, just outside the taped-off area, offering silent support and a grounding hand on John’s shoulder. All of which John would have been very grateful for, if he wasn’t so distracted by the sight of Sherlock…
As he’d thought, the clothing wasn’t all that different from what he was used to seeing, other than the fact that Sherlock had left the top three buttons of the shirt undone to expose his collarbones and the faintest dusting of chest hair, a thought that John very carefully pushed aside. It was the smear of blue glinting in the single hall light that caught his attention. Sherlock had applied it lightly along his cheekbones so that it was eye-catching, but not overwhelming. It made his eyes seem larger and brought out the ever-changing color (currently a deep indigo).
“Definitely don’t,” Ella agreed. “If I were letting myself really think about it, I’d be in the same boat.”
“Behave,” he said sternly, and then grinned and disappeared before Sherlock could hurl any insults at him.
“Tell me what you like,” John demands, but Sherlock doesn’t know, so he says, “Fast,” because all he wants just then is to come, to see it all over John’s hand and know that John was the cause of it.
It rang five times before Amenadiel said, “Hello?” just a bit too sharply—he hadn’t warmed up to cell phones the way Lucifer had.
John laughed so hard he threw his head back, and then pointed right at Sherlock. “He’s like that, too! Always behaving like he can crash through a case and leave the boring bits to the poor sods caught in his wake.”
“Yeah.” John turned to look at Sherlock and gave him one of those smiles, the one that was soft around the mouth and bright in the eyes. “Mine, too.”
“Right. That means whoever killed her mounted this thing on the wall while she was on it.” Ella stepped back, shaking her head as she surveyed the display. “Whacked, right?”
Maybe, but sending agents all this way when they could investigate from their end seemed a bit extreme. Unless they knew something, though that could still be communicated over the phone. Putting it aside for now, Chloe shuffled through the files, each one the same—the pentagram, the hearts, the position, all of it. “If they’re custom ordering these pentagrams, maybe we can track down the company or artist that made them?”
Chloe nodded because of course it was, why would they make it that easy for them. “Okay, Lucifer, let’s get this sorted out and start doing some research, see if there’s anything besides, you know, the literal devil that’s making them target L.A.”
Sherlock’s lips drew back in a snarl before he could stop himself. He quickly turned it to a huff and snatched up the tea again, if only to hide some small part of his face, but the damage was already done.
She waited for the date remarks to begin (which, honestly, didn’t bother her, not coming from Lucifer, because all it took was a “no” and he would let it drop) but Lucifer only beamed and suggested Chinese.
“There’s nothing of the killer, though,” Sherlock continued, soft and quick, the way he always did when something excited him. “Nothing. Except that we are either looking at one very large and fit individual, or several killers, considering the size of the victim.”
As he got closer, the man’s—Sherlock’s—scent reached him, something spicy and dark that brought all the contradictory nature of fire to mind, destruction and creation curled into a single wisp of smoke. It was… strangely complex for a human, and just as strangely intoxicating.
“Maybe they’re trying to open a hellmouth?” Ella grinned in that way she did when she was making a reference that almost always went right over Chloe’s head.
On the opposite side of the room, another doorway led into a modest kitchen with wood-patterned linoleum. Sherlock could just make out cabinets built in the same style as the living room walls, and hear the clink of china and the hiss of a kettle boiling.
He was just taking another sip, which put him in that position of not-so-coyly watching over the edge of his glass, when the man saw him. Blue eyes narrowed as they danced over Lucifer’s face and body, then abruptly widened as full lips formed a small “oh!” of surprise. The man immediately turned to his companion and gave him the same once-over, nodded to himself in apparent satisfaction, then whirled back around to face Lucifer. This time they locked eyes, but the man appeared to have none of the usual human sense of shame and proceeded to do exactly as he’d done before.
Lestrade’s fingers spasmed against his shoulder, gripping tight enough to make John grateful he wasn’t holding the scarred one. Nothing changed about his expression, though now that John was looking for it he could see a flatness in Lestrade’s gaze, still directed at Sherlock.
He was so distracted by the force of it that he had no time to react when the man, smiling broadly, said, “Hello!” in a cheerful, English accent, or when he slipped a hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck and pulled him into a kiss.
The entrance to the club was roped off, and marked with a simple and, to John’s eyes, surprisingly elegant L U X, white letters within individual, black boxes. The building itself was stone and dizzyingly tall, though nothing he wasn’t used to. That, at least, felt familiar.
He nodded, more to himself than her, and tried to pick up a mouthful of his noodle-mush. It promptly plopped straight back into the container. Lucifer stared down at it like an offended cat, all wide disbelieving eyes. Chloe snorted, almost choking on her own mouthful of food, and then they were laughing like a pair of complete idiots and didn’t stop for what was probably an absurd amount of time.
Lucifer usually didn’t care to sort out one noise over another while he was in his club, but his curiosity was too great. He singled out the man and his companion in time to hear the blond man yell, “
A generic ringtone went off, loud enough to make John jump and then silently berate himself for doing so. Lestrade, after a glance at his phone, shook his head. Sherlock’s was on silent because, and John was quoting, “Everyone is hateful today, John. Everyone.” (John had learned a long time ago not to take those comments personally). That just left John. The two people most likely to call (or text) him were standing right there, which meant this was either work, Mrs. Hudson,
Mycroft emerged just as John was sitting down, but declined John’s offer to make some more eggs. He was fully dressed in his usual suit, though his umbrella remained stubbornly absent.
Quickly, Lucifer glanced over the throngs of dancing bodies in search of the particularly attractive one, and pouted when he couldn’t spot him. “If I see him again, I’ll point him o—oooo, there he is! Over by the stocky blond man by the stairs. Hm, actually, he’s quite attractive too, isn’t he?” Two men in one night; he hadn’t done that in a while!
Sherlock drew in a deep breath and shifted just enough to cast John a sidelong look. “You’re staring at me.”
Mycroft sighed. He leaned back and crossed his ankle over his knee. He was wearing less than usual—the dress pants and clean white shirt were present, but nothing else of his usual three-piece suit. The top two buttons were even undone—for Mycroft, it was downright casual.
A sound erupted behind the door that John was almost certain was a cut off laugh. Shaking his head, John leaned back against the wall, arms crossed and foot tapping impatiently. He might tease, but really, he envied Sherlock’s ability to go from a lazy mess to perfectly put-together, no matter how long it might take. Besides, he was very curious to see this new look. The shirt wasn’t really all that unusual, and John had seen him in jeans before, but that blue glitter had been on his mind since he picked the bottle up from the bed. It was something John would never be able to pull off on himself, but Sherlock already had such an ethereal quality about him that it almost seemed like a natural addition.
John’s vision went red, and then pain exploded in his left hand. The two seemingly unrelated events left him confused for a moment, until the man swam back into sight and John realized he’d just punched him in the nose. Not that there was any sign of it, beyond a mildly surprised expression.
He groped for a light switch and found one just inside. It illuminated a small mudroom, empty but for an umbrella resting on a hook beside the light switch.
And because Lucifer had some sort of preternatural sense of the best (or worst) possible moment to make a grand entrance like the drama queen he was, that was when he chose to step up beside Chloe and groan, “Oh, bloody hell!”
I realized about halfway through chapter two that I was setting everything in season 2 of Lucifer, not 1, which works for me because I really wanted to add Ella.
“Oh oh yeah, how would your character react to this?” Ella asked, bouncing in place on her toes. “I mean, you seem way more ‘sympathy for the devil’ than ‘chaos and destruction’ devil, so I’m guessing…?”
“Do have a seat,” came Mycroft’s voice, and Sherlock looked up to find he’d stepped into the living room, holding a tray of tea and biscuits. He set it on the coffee table and politely indicated that John was welcome to help himself.
“John Watson,” the driver said with a nod and another easy smile. “Mycroft doesn’t come here often, but when he does he always talks about you and Mr. Holmes there. I was actually kinda excited to meet you guys, to be honest.” Without looking away from the road, he took one hand from the wheel and stuck it at an awkward angle that still allowed John to shake it. “I’m Darius.”
“Oh, sorry! Are you his boyfriend?” The man’s smile only seemed to grow at the idea. “I do apologize, but you needn’t worry, you’re very attractive yourself. We could all have some fun.”
John did another scan of the crowd, but couldn’t land on anyone who struck him as particularly interesting. “What the bloody hell are you staring at!” he yelled, but Sherlock continued to ignore him but for a soft hum.
John snorted and Sherlock fought a grin for all he was worth. Mycroft stared at them both, heaved a sigh, and waved them into the car.
Like every time he came across a sleepy John (or John in any sort of vulnerable state, really), a warm knot grew in his chest and expanded, slow but steady, until it was nearly impossible to stand still. He was never quite sure what this urge was, but he did know it was out of his control and that was unacceptable. To distract himself, he gave John a quick once-over—slept soundly, but could have used a couple more hours. Called his sister and work as soon as he woke up. No night terrors, but the slight crease between his brows suggested at least a bad dream, or one of the calls went poorly. Oh, of course. They’d let him go at the clinic. Well, that was bound to happen sooner or later, though Sherlock had been counting on later—he hadn’t come up with a decent excuse yet for where all the money Mycroft had been giving him to give to John had come from. John didn’t like hand-outs, and he wouldn’t see “taking care” of Sherlock as real work the way Mycroft seemed to.
Sherlock shook hands quickly with both of them—he hated pleasantries. While John stepped up to do the same, Sherlock scanned both women. Olivia was highly ambitious and on track to be Chief of Police, while Chloe seemed to be content with her current position. Olivia was married and had two… no three… cats, Chloe was divorced and had at least one child and… was talking, directly to him, hm, how long had she been doing that?
John sucked in a sharp breath and closed his eyes. When he opened them again, nothing had magically changed—the body was still there, the police were still milling about, and there was Sherlock, still prowling on his hands and knees around the body, lips parted and eyes wide—his pupils had been dilated when John walked away, though he couldn’t see them at this distance.
Sherlock knows he has a peculiar sort of beauty, has even used it to his advantage on occasion, but it’s never been important before. The need for John to look at him and see a man worthy of wanting, in body as much as mind, gnaws at his nerves until the proof presents itself; dilated pupils, lips parting to allow a sharp intake of breath, a narrowing of eyes and focus as John takes a step closer to him.
“Please,” Sherlock hisses, just a single word because he can’t tell John what he wants—not when he’s still processing it himself.
Chloe closed her eyes. Took a breath. The person—or persons—responsible needed to be caught, and for that to happen, she needed to keep her cool. She blew out her breath, fast and hard, and opened her eyes.
The need is too great for them to follow through with any of the fantasies Sherlock has voiced; in the end, Sherlock is on his back and John is between his legs, fully clothed but for his exposed cock, building on the sense of vulnerability that has Sherlock panting and bucking his hips. The denim of John’s jeans is too rough to feel good, but he’s so worked up that he can’t stop until John lifts up enough to get a hand between them.
“Yes, well, it had to be done,” Mycroft said airily, and was silent until they reached the car, when he said, “Anything you may discover at the club tonight must be reported directly to me. I will decide if it is relevant to their case and pass it on.”
Orgasm has never been anything more than a temporary relief, a moment where his mind went quiet and there was nothing but a pleasant surge of sensation. This is much the same—his mind goes calm, his body shudders and relaxes into the ground—yet the addition of John lends an intensity he doesn’t expect, as mental as it is physical.
Lucifer grinned. “I want him to spot me first. See what he does.” Though, he didn’t object at all to the idea of the two of them teaming up to seduce the man. Her aggression could be a bit much for some, but there was a spark in this man’s eyes, cool and confident, that made him think Maze’s forwardness would either be outright rebuked or taken as a challenge.
“I worry about you, you know.” Mycroft paused to take a sip of his tea. “It’s not healthy. You’ve let the work become its own addiction.”
It took less time to get to the club than it had to the police station, but only by around twenty minutes. Long enough that Sherlock all but exploded out of the car when it stopped, and John had to rush to catch up to him, barely remembering to toss a rushed, “Thanks!” to Darius before running after his partner.
“Nice to meet you,” John said, while privately wondering how it was that Darius had come to be on a first-name basis with Mycroft.
“Jesus. Okay, so, everything about this screams premeditated.” Chloe frowned, crossing her arms over her chest as she leaned in to examine the gaping wound in the woman’s chest. It was jagged around the edges, the flesh torn outward in long strips. Her limbs were splayed so that her fingers and toes reached for four points of the pentagram, with her head aligned to the downward point. “And definitely sacrificial, but… does this seem really specific to you?”
He returned twenty minutes later with two steaming paper cups. John finally blinked awake when Sherlock held the black tea, milk no sugar, directly under his nose. Yawning, he took the cup and nodded gratefully to Sherlock, sighing contentedly when he took a sip.
The next day or so went about as well as could be expected. Amenadiel yelled at him, then tried to lecture him, then went off on a tangent about how he was powerless now and what was he supposed to do? Lucifer tuned him out around there, and by the time he started paying attention again Amenadiel was gone.
“I’ll let you know the second I find out,” Ella told her, and Chloe nodded and headed for her car, Lucifer on her heels.
“I need you to infiltrate a club,” Mycroft announced, not even waiting for them to finish their breakfast.
“What are you doing?” Chloe leaned over the table, watching as Lucifer glanced at files and found the cities listed, his finger tracing over the paper and tapping each one.
how have you not seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer? You’d love it! We’re having a marathon as soon as this nightmare is over.”
Again, Sherlock ignored him—or at least, he didn’t answer. His mouth opened in a small show of surprise, and he abruptly whirled on John, his gaze darting rapidly from John’s brow to his shoes. Nothing he wasn’t used to by now. John cocked an eyebrow at him, but Sherlock only gave a single nod and turned back to staring at whatever had caught his attention. There it was again—the small, startled parting of his lips, the narrowing of sharp eyes. The same look he’d given Irene Adler—the look that said he’d found a person he couldn’t read.
When he opens his eyes, his best friend stands too close, fingers threading around Rosie’s back and just barely brushing John’s arm underneath her bottom.
“—and you just seemed so … Jesus, you even babbled when she said brainy was sexy!  You, of all people.
John’s procrastinating the unavoidable conversation, he realizes, as he stands here watching Sherlock dote on his daughter.  So he tells himself to just nut up and get on with it.
Sherlock doesn’t want to admit to himself how much he aches to believe it, that perhaps these odd fluctuations in John’s behavior are indicative of John realizing—but no.  It simply
"That is quite the accomplishment.  Any ideas?" John asks.  He fishes a cup from the side of the sink, puts a hand over Rosie's eyes, and proceeds to scoop cups full of water to pour over her head, gently scrubbing the paint from her hair with his fingertips.
John says with no little amount of sarcasm, “but I thought you might like something different.  Asked about and came up with the Indian place around the corner.  Seriously, you didn’t notice that I was gone for over an hour?”
He can’t help the small smile that tugs at the corners of his lips.  Sherlock reclines and spreads his hands wide.  “Astonish me.”
Rather proving that the girl has spent an inordinate amount of time with Sherlock, his daughter gives him a speaking glare that clearly states that John an idiot for asking the question. Sherlock guffaws.
“Sorry,” John reiterates, trying to get back the jokey voice.  “Didn’t realize she’d be quite so eager to tear off before we’d either of us gotten properly dressed.”
“Right.”  He’s trying desperately to restart his neurons firing but he just keeps blinking and gaping and gripping the doorknob.
Surprisingly, the detective ignores the dig.  He reaches out to Rosie as John bounces her on his hip but then pulls back.  Rosie turns her gaze on Sherlock and makes a few happy gurgles.
More and more over the next ten minutes, Sherlock convinces himself that he’s never going to survive this night without humiliating himself and potentially ruining their entire friendship.  He’s been on high alert all evening, starting from practically the moment they got on the train to come out to this forsaken place.  There’d been a gross profusion of people on the evening train out of the city – already enough to get Sherlock’s nerves on edge but also adding the stressor of forcing John to sit next to him on the bench seat, pressed very close up against Sherlock’s side to make room for more people in the compartment.  Feeling every centimeter of contact and degree of heat from John’s body, Sherlock finds his thoughts constantly skittering away every time the train rocks and pushes John more tightly against him.  They’ve had gar greater physical contact before but back then, Sherlock had been blissfully unacquainted with the appearance of nearly every inch of John’s unclothed body, and that knowledge currently serves to drive Sherlock insane.  Every jolt of the carriage compels some other part of John’s body against him and reminds him of the sleek slenderness of the doctor’s calves, the solid muscles of his thighs, the creamy skin of his chest marred in one spot by the scar that Sherlock’s never before been allowed to see, the golden fuzz trailing across his belly.  More than once, Sherlock can’t quite stifle a small grunt when John brushes against him, causing John to put out a hand and touch his forearm, a wrinkle of concern creasing his friend’s brow as John asks him what’s wrong.  The one time John’s fingers alight upon his thigh, Sherlock actually stumbles into the people sitting across the way in his haste to get up.  Only at the last moment does he think to face away from John as he slides out towards the safety of the corridor, mumbling some flimsy excuse as to why he needs to flee, trying to hide the evidence of a blooming erection because of John’s touch.  John doesn’t see it but the man kitty-corner must get a hint before the folds of his coat camouflage his state; the man’s eyes flicker between Sherlock’s reddening face and John’s confused one.  Sherlock curses the hint of a smirk on the other man’s lips and darts away as quickly as possible.  Staying away as long as he dares, Sherlock grumbles under his breath when he returns to find John chatting pleasantly with the amused witness and, to his humiliation, the man favors him with a Cheshire grin when Sherlock reseats himself with a load huff.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. His gaze swept over John’s face before he gave an apparently satisfied nod and strode down the hall without a word.
“I’m with him,” John panted, and after receiving a confirming nod, the man detached the rope and let John through.
Anxiety sinks into the background as the need turns to madness. Clothes are torn away, offensive, horrid things, keeping John’s eyes from properly seeing him. By the time he is naked he is also hard; his cock twitches when John reaches out and taps the pad of his index finger to the head. It sends a shock skittering across the surface of Sherlock’s skin—more a reaction to being touched at all than to the touch itself.
“Oh, oh!” Ella scurried away from the table and came back with a packet of slim, brightly colored sticky labels. “Here!”
He walked down the staircase like he’d stepped from the shadows themselves—liquid and ethereal, dark but for the paleness of skin accentuated by the faint shimmer of blue dusted over his cheeks, the black smudge of liner beneath his eyes. Everything about the man was long and lithe, and he moved with a grace that spoke of frequent activity and iron self-control. Long, pale fingers ghosted over the banister—his eyes were downcast in an act of coyness meant to attract rather than repel. And oh, attract they did—Lucifer couldn’t take his eyes off him. Or rather, he very much didn’t want to take his eyes off him.
“Ah, at last,” Mycroft said, as though he hadn’t arrived only ten minutes before. Fifteen, at the most. “This is my brother, Sherlock, and his assistant, John Watson. This is Lieutenant Olivia Monroe.” He indicated the taller woman. “And Detective Chloe Decker.”
Sometimes, all she wanted was to ask him what had happened to him to make him retreat into such an extensive fantasy, and to have him give her an honest answer. But whatever it was, it wasn’t something she could demand. That particular gem had to be offered, not just caught. Whenever the urge to ask him rose up in her, she had to remind herself that she was his friend, and that it was none of her business unless he made it so.
John twisted sideways, his tight expression declaring that he was torn between amusement and hurling his tea in Sherlock’s face. Their eyes met, and Sherlock felt his lips tremble with the effort of holding back.
He spun around so he could lean back against the bar, whiskey in hand. The song changed, something he didn’t recognize with a fast beat that made several people on the dance floor cheer. Probably something new, then. He rather liked it, actually—enough so that he considered going out for a dance.
What Sherlock didn’t say was that something was off because Mycroft never missed a chance to wield his umbrella. Oh, he’d put it down eventually, and Sherlock knew he didn’t carry it around when he was alone, but for the first entrance into a territory that Sherlock hadn’t even known he owned? Mycroft would want it there for that added emphasis it gave the air of power he was so certain he had (when really it just made him look like a boring version of Mary Poppins). As John stepped ahead into the hall, Sherlock cast a curious glance at it—was it some sort of warning?
Moonlight has washed out the colors of the landscape, leaving only a monochrome of grey. Sherlock often thinks of himself as monochrome—one talent, one fierce focus, one true love; The Work. Everything he does, everything he is, it’s just another shade of the same color. It’s easier that way.
“I stare at you a lot,” John defended himself. Which was true, though really not a great defense, now that he thought about it. Just one bloke staring at another, nothing to see here.
“Uh, sure, okay.” Chloe shrugged because why not, if nothing else it would be fun to hang out, and she’d probably need some friends and silliness after this mess. “Sounds good. For now, have you found anything?”
“Worth a shot.” Dan took the photo Chloe was currently holding and took it to his desk—and in the five seconds that took, Lucifer had taken the rest of the paperwork, shuffled through it, and taken off with the whole stack.
“You don’t know everything about me, Sherlock,” he said with an insufferable air of smugness. “Drink that. You’ll need the rest.”
Sherlock used every acting skill he possessed to pretend he didn’t give a single damn about the not-so-subtle conversation. Mycroft still caught his eye and smiled in a way that was almost non-existent to most, but to Sherlock it was a full, delighted grin. The child in him wanted to kick Mycroft in the shins. The adult wanted to kick him somewhere decidedly worse.
The apparent lack of empathy, the eagerness for murder (and creative murder at that), the extreme focus and childish tantrums, all of these were things John could handle. He was fully aware that empathy wasn’t required for compassion, and he’d witnessed Sherlock’s capacity for compassion—even if he did tend to express it in the oddest ways. The need for his mind to be worked and the morbid focus it took, fine, that was all fine, it wasn’t as if Sherlock was committing the murders himself and besides, he helped people. A lot of people. And in the last year, he seemed to be slowly becoming aware of the fact that there were real people involved in his cases, which John counted as a truly massive win. Even the tantrums were understandable—John could safely say Sherlock was neurodivergent in some form or another, and had an incredibly difficult time expressing anything outside of facts. Bouts of depression and mania, while no picnic, made sense once John understood just how trapped inside his own head Sherlock was (and how little practice he had dealing with the emotions he liked to pretend weren’t there).
“Yes, but too far apart to be working together, and all the victims are strong. One might even say ideal.” Sherlock steepled his fingers together, eyes glazing as he inverted his attention into his own mind. He looked almost evil in that moment—all he needed was black eyes and sharp teeth to complete the demonic delight he was taking in all of this.
Ah yes, sleep. Sherlock’s mind was a whir of activity, but he could feel the last forty-eight hours tugging at his body and knew he would have to succumb eventually—if only to appease John.
The horror turned to steely resolve between one blink and the next. Chloe let go of Lucifer and he drew back, offering only a smile as he retreated to his side of the table. “Right. So, we know they’re moving into the city, though… if this was their intended target, why start out spread all over the place? And what’s drawing them in?”
“What if it is demons?” she asked when he came back from day two of the investigation—he’d left a few hours before the agents from the U.K. were supposed to arrive. He was curious, but not curious enough to stick around when there were still no leads to follow.
Sherlock waved John into the taxi that stopped for them and slid in beside him, practically vibrating. “Two more before this one,” he said once they were moving. “In Brighton and Edinburgh, at roughly the same time, and two more just now, one near Heathrow and one…” and here his eyes gleamed, goddamn gleamed like he was some kind of comic book supervillain, and what did that make John for being so captivated by it? “In America,” Sherlock finished. His grin could officially be described as Cheshire Cat-worthy.
Aside from the lights, there were cameras everywhere. Sherlock spotted four on the walls and one above the gate, and another above the door as he pushed it open.
John’s downcast eyes and soft tone were filed away in a rapidly expanding room marked “John” in his mind palace, but Sherlock didn’t have time to give them a closer inspection. Already knowing that Mycroft would have had his things packed accordingly, Sherlock went back to his room and pulled out the bags that had been set under the bed. A quick dig produced black jeans that would fit snugly and a charcoal grey, silk button-up, along with a small bottle that he hadn’t seen in years. He held it at eye level for a moment, debating—it reminded him of the sharp rush of cocaine, and the loud music and dancing that had usually followed. He almost put it back in the bag, but at the last second he kept it—it wouldn’t hurt to give it a new association.
She heard her name as though she were underwater, distant and garbled. A blink, a shake of her head, and suddenly she was aware of a hand over hers—large, warm, a loose enough grip to easily shake off, though she didn’t want to. It felt like the safest point in the room and she reached for it, curled her other hand around the wrist and held on.
“We understand,” John said. Sherlock met his eyes and John sighed. “She told you it’s her case and to report anything you find to her,” he hissed when she turned to speak to Mycroft.
A warning bell goes off in his mind, but he quells it for now, perhaps even for good. The Work might become a bit more difficult in the future, but if the trade-off is John’s heavy-lidded gaze, his smile and his fingers dancing up Sherlock’s side, lust satiated yet body still hungry for touch…
Lucifer poured himself a whiskey and, almost as an afterthought, poured one for Maze as well. It seemed to mean something to her when he did it, and though he couldn’t quite figure out what it was it certainly didn’t hurt him to make the effort. “I don’t know,” he said only after he’d sipped away half the glass. “We’ll deal with that if we find out it’s true, I suppose.”
“I’ve been called worse,” Sherlock said. When they first met, John would have written the tone off as dismissive. Now, he could hear the nearly-swallowed notes of amusement.
The man coming toward them was tall and exceptionally fit and had healthy, tanned white skin accentuated by a close-fitting, dark blue suit. No tie, top three buttons of his white shirt undone--just like Sherlock. He had dark hair and a dark, close-cropped beard, and unusually intense eyes. John had a strange, panicky moment of fight or flight, or… fuck?
John snorted. Sherlock, on the other hand, latched onto the detail. Obviously the devil was a myth, but whether it was a birth name or something the man had given himself, it could still connect him to the murders.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock repeated, and if there was a hint of petulance in his voice that was just for them to know.
“Which?” Sherlock gets out before John breathes, “God, all of them,” and crushes their mouths together.
Much to his annoyance, Sherlock slept for five hours, though not before getting a good look at his room (and prowling around John’s once he was certain his friend was sound asleep). Like the rest of the house, the rooms had tongue-and-groove walls and warm colors. The beds were queen sized and the largest things in the rooms—in fact, aside from a small end table with a single drawer, a clock radio, and a lamp, they were the only furniture in the rooms. Both rooms boasted a large picture window with a spacious window seat, giving the occupant a clear view of the north end of the yard. Occasionally, the flood lights outside were triggered by a cat or other creature, but the light was distant enough to be only slightly irritating.
Sherlock sips his tea and smiles.  “Nonsense.  Frankly, I’m surprised you’re not crowing on about the obvious superiority of your genetic material making itself known in your offspring.”
Astonished, John scans back through his memory and realizes that it’s true; in the last several months, he can only remember a handful of instances where it was clear that Sherlock had not been to sleep when John rose with his daughter.  He’s stunned to realize that this is just another instance in the growing list of ways that Sherlock seems to have rearranged his entire livelihood for John (and now Rosie).  Another thing for which John may never be able to repay him.
Sherlock’s back looks like a relief map made entirely of scars.  Long, thin gashes that slices across his shoulders.  Thick rectangular welts framing either side of his spine.  Raised red circles the size of the tip of his pinky dotting the tender skin of the small of his back.  A few faded oblongs just at the bottom of his ribs that cover a few knotty bumps beneath.  Two angry, jagged red marks whose shape doesn’t really have a name just above his waistband.  John takes long, slow sips of air through his nose, blowing them out through his mouth, as he wobbles on his feet and tries not to retch.
She gives him a rueful smile.  “Isn’t it always?  Good night, Miss Rosamund.  Have a good sleep and you’ll be all better.”
“Thanks.  I’ll toss out a nappy from the loo and I’m sure there’s a spare outfit in there,” John nods to the diaper bag next to the spare cot they keep in Sherlock’s room, “if you don’t mind getting her dressed while I get myself sorted and pack our bags.”
“Hey,” he says quietly, slipping into the role of calm and doting boyfriend that Sherlock has clearly assigned him.  “I know that you didn’t mean to hurt her.  Accidents happen,” he finishes, his voice hitching.
“Thanks again, Dr. Watson,” he says sincerely, pretending not to notice as John stuffs a few condoms and packets of lube in the boy’s rucksack before handing it back to him.
low.  At this point, most of what’s keeping the towel above his cock is the fuzz of blonde hair leading down to his groin.
John swallows back a mouthful of saliva and bile and nods.  His touch moves to the series of marks and knots at his spine.  “Good, old-fashioned beating.  Fractured some ribs that didn’t heal properly.”
She sits back and folds her hands, staring deliberately at the camera for a long moment, waiting for John to cotton on.  John is flummoxed into silence.  Eventually, when Mary speaks again, he realizes he’s clapped a hand over his mouth in shock.
This time John looks Sherlock straight in the face.  “I’m trying to work on not pushing people away when they offer help.  Trying not to be quite so defensive about my short-comings.  So … thank you for helping with Rosie tonight.  For trying to help me.  I’m sorry if I’m a bastard about it sometimes, but … I really couldn’t do this without you.”
Wrapping a towel loosely around his waist, John bends over and whispers to his daughter.  “Rosie love, would you like to go show Sherlock what a wonderful bee you are?”
