Tony sighed as he listened to him, and Steve knew that this was him giving into the fact that Steve wasn’t going anywhere. They were a team, they were parents, but most of all they were married, and Steve honestly wouldn’t give it up for anything, not even the chance to live the life he had lost because even in their present, he had everything a sickly boy from Brooklyn could have ever wanted.
“You should get on my dick and get this whole thing over with,” Steve said, and Tony knew that cranky Steve was back and ready to mess with him.
“Frozen,” Morgan yelled out happily. She had gotten into the Disney princess phase of her childhood, and had an affinity for the princesses that stood up for themselves.
“Tony, seriously you don’t, and that shit isn’t healthy either,” Bucky said as he pulled out Tony’s nearly full garbage can, which was mostly wrappers at this point, which honestly was probably a bad thing, but he’s too tired to actually move lately so who can blame him. “I don’t think that I’ve ever seen you go to the dining hall.”
“That’s how Wanda got her powers too, well not from an explosion, but from one of the stones,” Steve said to the group. “How is it possible for the stones to give people powers like that?”
“I hope to keep that up,” he said feeling like he’s a father whose kid is going off to college, instead of going off on some intergalactic mission where everyone he knows and cares for could possible die. He could feel the tears start before she pulled away, “Just be safe okay,” he told her, not wanting to lose another person to that madman.
“Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck scale, which then triggers the Deutsch proposition. Can we agree on that?” Tony asks, looking at the people in front of him who barely knew the kind of science experiment that they were trying to attempt. “Thank-you. In Layman's terms, it means you're not coming home,” he finished, knowing that if he lost Steve, the kids, any of it he wouldn’t survive at all.
“I am not Loki,” he said standing there not moving, he knew that he couldn’t make the first move. “And I don’t want to hurt you.”
“We’re going out tomorrow?” he said before a yawn took over, he was slightly tilted as Steve pushed him through the door.
“Okay, I get it,” he said but for some reason it felt nice to be taken care of by Steve. “Let’s see what our team found,” he yawned before point towards the door, “Onward my loyal steed.”
“It was weird at first, but I learned that if I needed some stimulus, so did he, so he trained, and I trained, we learned, we shared, he’s not as angry as before, and we’re both calmer than I have ever remembered.”
“Steve,” Tony called out, but it wasn’t the sound that came out of him, he wasn’t sure an actual coherent thought could come out of him. It hadn’t been a joke, Steve was at only eighty percent of his usual strength, and he was still making Tony bounce up and down. Tony had to grab onto Steve’ knees and hold on for dear life, because it really was like trying to ride a bronco. “Fuck,” he cried out before everyone whited out and he collapsed onto Steve’s chest as he came completely dry.
“It’s a good thing that his main source of happiness is making sure you’re secure,” he said smiling, Happy had always supported their relationship, but maybe it was because he was afraid that if Pepper left he wouldn’t see her again, which was an interesting development in their friendship. “Am I going to have to give you both the shovel speech, because I’m too tired for that right now.”
“Unless you want your mind erased. And not in a fun way,” Clint said to the STRIKE team, and boy did Tony wish he could use it on them right now so that they wouldn’t have the chance to take it from the Avengers and start experimenting with it.
If he was in the bathroom a little longer than he should have been, it didn’t matter, he was tired and now hungry, though he was glad that he didn’t have to deal with the fact that his roommate was in a relationship with the guy who only hours ago had caught Tony’s attention, he wasn’t sure how far he could trust Jan’s word at the moment. It was only because sometimes people broke up, and realized later that they should have stayed together. Tony didn’t want to risk trying anything and getting his heart broken, so he filed it away and moved on.
“Yeah well remind me to never piss off your dad, I don’t want to be in the story as a dead soldier either,” Bucky said before changing his shirt and looking at himself in the mirror.
Jan spit her drink back into her cup at the word love all the while choking back a laugh, Natasha’s face on the other hand turned red matching her hair, “He can’t be in love with me, we’ve been on three dates and that’s it.”
Morgan’s godparents, ended up being Pepper and Happy, who had gotten married a year after Steve and Tony had, they dotted on the little girl as much as they could. When Pepper wasn’t off running the company or doing a million charity functions, or Happy wasn’t freaking out over people not having their badges, the two spent time at the lake house with them. Pepper, or Aunnie Pepa and Unca Hape, as Morgan would call her, often used the time to wind down, the little girl telling her all kinds of stories about her siblings.
Before Tony himself had become Iron Man, he remembered the day that Rhodey had gotten a frantic call from Monica Rambeau, her mother had gone missing during a mission, like with Tony, Rhodey searched for Maria, she had become a sister to him and he didn’t want to let Monica down, the woman’s body had been recovered soon after. He had lost a friend after that, and Tony had been so involved in himself that he hadn’t been there for Rhodey. Tony wasn’t sure what had happened to Monica after the snap, but the reappearance of Carol Danvers was going to throw so much of the man’s equilibrium out of place that Tony wasn’t sure about how his friend was going to survive this new development.
If there was one thing that Steve was certain of, it was that he hated Captain America, he was still at home, it was too early to function, but he could hear his father on the phone with his editors in New York, as they planned the end of the series. His father had created the character, naming it after his son as the public called him, because he wanted Steve to have someone to look up to. It was also because he had the idea of Steve growing up to be a big strong person, who took care of others, a man with a moral compass and a love for his country. What Steve wished hadn’t happened was his father’s need to put those ideals on him from the beginning, though he had a love for art like his father, he didn’t want to work on comic books at all.
“Yeah well being a hero isn’t exactly a nine to five job,” he said but she threw a pencil at him and he knew that he had to resign to his fate at the moment.
“Okay,” was all he said before leaning back and thinking of how he was going to get Tony to understand that what he had seen had been a huge misunderstanding.
They had gotten married the next day, Riri as their only witness, after he told Tony about how they had met, and how they had bonded, Steve feeling like an overprotective Uncle. The judge had to sign an NDA considering who he was marrying, but it would become public record, that Captain America and Iron Man got married one year after the snap. As for Riri, they had asked her if she would like to live with them on the months she wasn’t in school. Steve didn’t want her to be alone, and she said yes, happy that she could learn from Tony, they brought her back to the lake house, they became her foster parents weeks later after she had told Tony about what had happened to her parents. Because for Tony, who had lost Peter, he didn’t want her to be alone in the world, he didn’t want anyone to be alone. That was when their little family started to grow, and Steve wouldn’t have traded any of it for the world.
“We should make sure everyone is ready,” his mother said smiling at him, her glittering gown changing from gold to red, Tony had picked it out when they had gone shopping his first day back from school. His mother had wanted to spend some time with him, feeling guilty over leaving him alone during Thanksgiving. “Plus, I want to meet this boy you’re seeing.”
“If we can do this, you know go back in time, why don’t we just find baby Thanos, you know, and...” Rhodey made as if he were suggesting that they go back in time and strangle baby Thanos with a rope.
“What,” he said fixing his glasses and pushed the little curl away from his face. “I’m blind without them, and I like that no one notices me, it makes it easier to just be me, and not what my father wants me to be.”
“I know, he hasn’t stopped talking about Iron Man since he first saw the picture on your wall, I can tell when something has caught his interest, but I just want to be the one to protect him, because to me he has always been the one to take care of everyone.”
In Tony’s mind he knows that he should have connected the dots, but he hadn’t known Bruce’s last name, and he had been too worried about whether Steve had been in an accident to actually ask. They rushed up to Labor and Delivery to see Steve pacing back and forth in his tux, which Tony thought was sexy, but he couldn’t say that, not with everything that was happening, but he’d save the comment for later.
Tony was in the kitchen, slamming cupboard doors, the girls had the tv on as high as they could, which was already pretty loud, so that they wouldn’t hear them arguing. Honestly Steve didn’t want to fight, he just wanted to talk to Tony, but he knew that it wasn’t going to happen. Before he could say anything, Tony held his hand up and pointed towards the garage, Tony’s workshop, and the one place in the whole house that was truly soundproof. They hadn’t fought in a while, not on something this big, but they needed to talk and he knew that Tony was trying to do it without the kids hearing them.
They sat out there for an hour, drinking tea, which was actually apple juice, and whatever Steve had baked the day before. The girls telling him stories, Riri telling him about one of her professors, usually Riri talked about her Iron Heart armor, but the professor had had a breakthrough and she just had to share. Kamala wondering how far the fabric on her superhero uniform would stretch, even though the thought of Kamala going out there and getting hurt scared him. Morgan telling him about her imaginary friend, which was just a small bot he had created for her that only comes out when she’s alone.
“Are you sure you can’t take the long way?” Tony had asked but Ty said no and left him standing there. He wasn’t sure of what to do, shoving his hands in his pockets he felt his phone and remembered Steve’s number now in his contacts.
“Whatever,” Tony said wrangling his pillow back and covering his face with it not wanting to let them see his disappointment. “I’m just going to write my stories and ignore the world until classes start on Monday anyway.”
Morgan squealed out a Yay from her seat as they settled into putting the ingredients together, Steve knew that this was what home felt like, warmth and the people he loved. So of course, the moment that they were at their happiest was when everything changed.
Steve let out a laugh as Tony took the shield and propped it up for Steve’s arm. “Thank you, Tony,” Steve said as he slid his hand into the straps. “For everything, for the life we have, the kids, giving me a home.”
“This is why I told you to calm down,” she said before taking the last vial off the suit before he could make another mistake. “We’re all under pressure right now, and you tend to freak out a little when there’s too much happening at once.”
“Okay, but I want you to work on that story Tony, you’re a good writer and I don’t want someone else dictating whether you could or couldn’t be a writer period,” she said hugging him, she was comforting him, but he could also feel just how tense she was after their talk.
Maybe one day I'll get deeper into the relationships between the kids, and their adoptive dads. Until that time comes I hope you enjoyed this, because they're going to play a bigger role further into the story.
Steve didn’t miss how America automatically hugged Lila, which meant that Lila was the girl that America had been talking about. They had all grown, found friends, and some had even fallen in love, this was what they were trying to protect. He didn’t know what to do about them showing up, they were all grown up enough to make their own decisions about what they wanted to do regardless of what he or Tony thought.
Sighing to himself, he put the finishing touches to their lunch and made his way out to the front yard, “Chow time!” he called out but Morgan didn’t answer. “Morgoona,” he said hearing the soft giggle of his little girl. “Morgan H. Stark, come out come out wherever you are.”
Bucky rolled over and groaned into the table, Steve was lucky that the place was still empty, but that was only because most of the students didn’t get back until late afternoon. “Her flight got delayed so she won’t be back until later.”
“I wasn’t worried too much about him, he was talking a minute ago,” he said but he didn’t want to say what it was about.
If anything, Steve was in awe with how good Tony was with the kids, always encouraging them, both academically, and artistically. Tony who had told Steve early on in their relationship that he was afraid that he was going to be a terrible father, that he didn’t know why he had gone ahead and adopted four kids. But Steve told him, every day since Morgan came home with them, that if it wasn’t for Tony those kids wouldn’t have made it as far as they had in the last couple of years.
“Yeah, that was just a happy accident,” one that had been born from his fanfiction, but that was something that he was going to never mention to anyone in the science community. “I’ve been working on it for a little while, but when it’s done it could revolutionize the energy industry, get us out of oil and coal and into more sustainable forms of energy, one that won’t ruin the planet.”
“We have the mind stone and the tesseract at Stark Tower, and the time stone down on Bleecker,” Steve said as he turned on the commando that Tony loved so much. He really couldn’t wait to go back home and climb Steve like a tree. “The Hulk can make his way down there without anyone questioning why he’s fighting the Chitari, So, Bruce, the time stone is yours to get.”
“I had been so worried, you want to know why,” he asked waiting for Steve to shake his head. “Morgan and I blew up the TV earlier.”
“I’m working on it,” Bruce said, and Steve could see the panic in the man’s eyes. So, when Bruce pressed the buttons again, they weren’t expecting a baby to show up in front of him.
When he had gotten to Riri’s project he was astonished at what she had accomplished, Steve knew that the two would hit it off, considering how much they had in common, but it amazed him even more when she started talking about replusor technology and how Tony’s reactor could help the world around them. Eventually leading him towards where she had helped Steve set up the proposal, in a small classroom nearby, under the guise of asking for help with the rest of her project.
“If I move on, who does this?” she says gesturing to the room around them, where moments before the team, while scattered across the universe, still worked together.
“Tony,” Steve’s stern voice came over the line, and Tony was glad that they could talk like this, especially looking at their former selves, who were still trying to get a grip on being a proper team.
“Steve’s mom’s in labor,” Tony blurted out, his mother’s eyes were wide as the words registered, she nodded before looking around the room.
“I gotta tell you Nat, he’s way into you,” Jan said as they sat down at one of the tables in the local Starbucks. They had gotten tired of being on campus for lunch, and so Jan drove them into town for some coffee instead. It was nice to get out of the dorm and not hide away like he normally did, even if he had to listen to their girl talk.
“Not really, but if it’s with her I think I would, she gets this sparkle in her eyes when she talks about being in the Nutcracker.”
Tony was quiet for a moment, and Steve knew that he was thinking about whether there would be another fight, there was so much that they hadn’t thought about, especially if they brought everyone back, because they would also bring back any enemies that they may have made over the years. Before they could have a conversation about it the loud giddy scream came from the hallway as their youngest daughter came barreling into the compound’s kitchen.
Tony was wheeled back to medical by Nebula, he hated that he wasn’t going, but he was more frightened at the prospect of not being able to fix everything. Once in the room, she helped him onto the bed, she hadn’t said a word to him that hadn’t been directly related to what was happening and he knew it was because she was trying to deal with it all.
Except that hadn’t happened, as it turned out the store and the café next door had been closed down due to repairs, which left Tony without his books and his coffee for the whole summer.
There had been a moment back before the battle of New York, where Thor had hit the shield with the hammer, it had become a move that they had prefected over the years, but doing it alone was going to be a feat. Steve threw the hammer only calling it back when Thanos was close enough and had it hit the shield with all the power it could, sending a shockwave towards the Titan, throwing him backwards. As he watched the mad man stand up, Steve called on Thor’s power, taking a running start as he felt the power of the lightning hit him, but he used it to hit Thanos in the face with everything he could, knocking him back.
“Oh, wow are those flowers for me,” Steve’s mother said, and all Tony could really do was nod at the very pregnant woman. “You shouldn’t have, but they’ve very lovely, if only my husband could take a cue from you and get me something nice every once and a while.”
He thought about it for a moment before turning towards her. “I’ll be fine, there’s a lot of things that could have happened, but I trust Steve, and if you didn’t maim him after I left then that night, then means that he’s telling the truth.”
Introducing Wanda into the story, plus her and Sam being into the ghost hunting shows was something that I made up in my head, but would also be stupidly funny to think about.
“You wouldn’t dare,” Rhodey said getting up as fast as possible to close the door. “You promised that you would never tell her.”
“And how many siblings does he have?” Tony asked genuinely curious, because Steve looked like he was born to be America’s golden boy, all apple pie and awe shucks.
“Hey,” Ty said as everyone left packed up to leave. “I work in the library most nights, so if you want to come over and brainstorm, you can keep me company,” it was nice to make a friend the first day of the class, especially since he was a freshman, at least in their eyes.
“Yeah, whatever,” Steve said, he knew that Darcy would say yes, she liked Clint, she had asked him a million questions about Clint the first time the man had shown up in the store. It was weird because she was a Political Science student in the master’s program at one of the nearby schools, but she was the loudest outgoing person he knew.
“We’ll talk about that once everyone is back, for now just stow away the suit, and apparently get some tacos while there’s some left.”
“Did Fury leave anything behind,” Steve asked looking over at the continuing images of everyone they had lost just weeks before.
“No, maybe I will one day but right now, I guess it’s just another project,” Tony was always trying to protect them, even when he decided on not being Iron Man. He made suits for the kids, even installing KAREN into them so that they kids were all connected to one another even when they were miles apart. FRIDAY, was connected to Steve’s phone and his car, as well as the Avengers Facility and wherever it was that Thor, Bruce and Valkyrie were. He even upgraded it on the Benatar, so that Rocket could talk to Natasha, and Nebula could talk with them all.
“Who’s Bucky?” Natasha asked him, and he knew at that point that only Bucky’s close friends called him that, to everyone else he was just James.
“God Damn it Steve,” Bucky yelled causing both him and Sharon to jump as the door slammed against the wall, Tony’s sister Natasha not far behind his best friend.
“Maybe there’s somethings that are more permanent than others,” Bruce told him. “We’re all here, we all care about you.”
“Tbanks,” he said knowing that his words were still a little off from the broken nose and his head was a little woozy from the blood loss, but with Steve there he knew that everything would be alright.
“No, we don't say that. Only daddy says that word. I coined it, it belongs to me,” he said trying to defuse the situation, he didn’t want Steve to hear her saying the word, he didn’t want the wrath of his husband because he taught their youngest how to curse.
Before Tony could keep going Steve took his hand before leaning over and kissing the genius on the lips for the second time since they met. It was soft, and tentative, but it made it feel real to Steve. Before pulling away he pinched Tony’s hand causing Tony to yelp out at the pain.
“Yeah normal couple things, we’re still just starting out, I mean I used my lack of math skills just to spend time with you,” Steve admitted, it was the truth, he wouldn’t have passed the class if it hadn’t been for Tony, but that was just the icing on the cake. He really just wanted to spend some time with him.
“Why do you do that? You can’t afford to replace that door,” Steve said quickly standing away from Tony’s side of the room, feeling self-conscience about being there especially when Tony had left the room angry.
“He has it coming James,” she said but Steve was just confused, before he could say anything her hand was in front of his face, connecting with his cheek as she slapped him, albeit a lot harder than he thought she could for someone so small.
“Wait they’re here,” Kamala said sprinting out of the room, most likely in a rush to find her godparents.
Steve ignored them and walked away, heading towards the registers to open them up for the day, when he saw Clint standing outside. Honestly, he couldn’t understand why the man didn’t have a job, but since Natasha was letting him in Steve knew that they were all going to gang up on him. He could hear them talking but choose to ignore them because he knew that they were going to bring the topic up over and over again until he caved and got them to help him.
Pushing them all into the house, before shoving his brothers into the living room, and taking Tony to the one place he was sure his mother was, in the den. His father worked in the basement of the house, his mother on the other hand had created a little library in the den for the babies and usually sat in there when the house was too much. She was the mother of five boys, and sometimes it gets to be too much even for her.
They all looked at the planet highlighted on the table in front of them. No one said a word, and Tony knew it was because none of them were sure about what was happening. They were in uncharted territory, no matter where they looked, they didn’t know where to go next. There were too many of them, too many possibilities, to many chances at messing everything up.
“That it does,” he said as Steve lifted up Tony’s ass and lined himself up before pushing his way back into Tony’s twitching hole.
“What did I tell you about pushing Bruce too far with your jokes?” Steve said, and Tony couldn’t help but want to push the man away again. They had lasted one day without a fight, he was still staring at this bearded version of Captain America and it felt like nothing had actually changed between them, like nothing was ever going to change, they would fight and fight over anything even when it wasn’t Tony’s fault.
“Okay, stop,” Tony said to Peter before ripping off a piece of paper from the flowers and writing down a complicated code of some kind before handing it off to Peter. “Try that and then we’ll talk.”
He remembered finishing the last one, he still had his fiction writing assignment, and apparently a date with Steve... or he could have hallucinated that he wasn’t sure. The not sleeping thing was getting out of hand and he knew it, but he wanted to finish everything before finals week, so that he could spend more time with Steve. There was also the fact that he had been working on his AI the whole time as well, because while DUM-E was great, he had just been the one step forward that Tony needed to create JARVIS.
Steve looked at him like Tony had physically punched him in the face, for some reason it reminded him of the first time the mind stone had messed with them, “I needed you, I needed my family with me, I told you all that this was coming, and nope no one listened to me, Bucky was more important, your freedom was more important, I wanted to put a suit of armor around the world and protect what was precious to us, because that’s what we needed.”
“Yeah, that makes sense you moron,” Rocket said as he walked over the table and started messing with the screens.
“Yeah, but he eats now, I’m guessing it has to do with his roommate, but also with you, because most likely he asked all kinds of questions about you during those dinners with James,” He knew he was turning into a tomato but that didn’t stop her from talking. “He thought that you were dating your roommate first, and when that didn’t turn out to be true, he thought that it was Sharon, though I did fail to mention that it was the same Sharon he knew.”
“It’ll be done by the end of the summer, I promise, and maybe the girls would like having Lila, Cooper and Nate around, more kids for them to hang around with.”
“If it’s not too much trouble,” Steve had asked him for help with studying for his final exam. Tony saw it as another way for them to hang out together, but also as another way to focus his energy on something else, anything else.
“Boss,” FRIDAY’s voice sounded off in the workshop. “Queen Shuri is calling, she says that it’s in regards to Vision.”
Morgan started giggling, and Tony was sure that it was one of the most wonderful sounds in the world for him. “That ain't the whole story.”
“Like dad would be any better once the girls are born,” Steve added, knowing that most likely his father would become an overprotective papa bear.
“I’m a mother Joe, I need to know so that my boys would be protected, if I left it up to you, they’d run wild like some crazy beasts of the wilder woods or something.”
His robot project, Butterfinger’s brother was coming along the only problem was that the AI program wasn’t working properly just yet, he was having an interfacing problem and wasn’t one hundred percent sure of how to solve it. Mainly because the time he would have spent working on it, he had been helping Steve or hanging out in the library with Ty. Though he couldn’t fault them for that, mainly because it was nice not having to actually live up to being a Stark and just being a regular person. Maybe he could use the long weekend to work on it since he was going to be alone for the first time.
“You kept it,” Tony said looking at the bill and then at Steve, “You could have used it to eat or something.”
“How about for now, we just go back to sleep, because I’m not sure that this is really happening, and maybe we can talk more in the morning,” Tony said to him before snuggling right back into Steve’s chest. He wasn’t sure what had just happened but he knew that it was a start and what ever happened from that moment forward would change both of them.
“Oh,” Tony whispered, but before he could say anything else Steve pulled out a piece of paper and put his number on it.
“So,” Steve put his arms around him, while kissing him on his temple. “How many kids do you think that we’re going to end up with?”
Tony let out a sound that let everyone in the house know how excited he was, he had woken up Peter and Harley, Natasha and Bucky came in from the kitchen where they had been making some food for them, and Thor walked behind Bruce looking around at the pictures that were nestled everywhere.
“Yeah well, Thor had warned us, and Jarvis had wanted to take us shopping for things we would need, but you had been too engrossed in that story of yours to notice and look where we are now,” she said attempting to roll on him enough that he would give up and move. She had always done this, even when she had become more popular and outgoing, she had always rolled on top of him until he agreed to go out. “Come on Tony.”
Just as Clint took off, he was followed by Bruce who didn’t say another word, the man was racked with guilt over what had happened in the lab earlier. Nebula followed, them after giving Steve a knowing look, he already knew what she would do to him if he ended up hurting Tony. Leaving behind Ms. Potts, Rhodey, and Natasha, all who were very protective of Tony, even when Steve saw Nat as one of her closest friends, she still berated him and teased over the years over how him and Tony were around one another.
“Nah, she had a last minute thing with her friend Jan and her mom, from what she had told me, Tony had been left alone all weekend,” Bucky said looking at him, but Bucky didn’t really see him in fact Steve was sure that Buck wouldn’t have, because mention his girl and everything went out the window. But the thought of Tony being alone made Steve feel bad for him, he couldn’t imagine what it would have been like for Tony, even with having siblings, Steve would have guessed that one of them would have been there. He was going to ask another question, but Bucky had fallen asleep again, and Steve wasn’t in the mood to wake him.
“Oh my god,” he said as the messages all started popping up, “Steve’s mom is in labor, they’re at the hospital.”
“Right?” Scott answered a little too excited now, but that’s what Steve did when he gave those speeches.
It didn’t matter, it was Bucky’s life and Steve was going to let his friend live it, if in the end he realizes that he’s dating his roommates’ sister and Tony doesn’t kill him, then Bucky would have survived the worse. Or at least he hoped that was the worst that could happen, though he remembered that Tony had a few older brothers so who knew what Bucky would have to face in the future. There was also the fact that if Bucky could date Tony’s sister, then it was possible for Steve to be able to date Tony, which just made his night even better.
Steve smiled. That was a flattering way to think about it. As Clint revved the engine, Steve asked, “Want to help me buy some costumes?”
was foul!” He shouted at the television, taking his pants off and reaching for the scented wipes to clean himself up. Clint liked the cucumber wipes, but Thor preferred rose-scented. No one wanted to disappoint Thor.
It was hard to hear the exact flow of play with his face trapped between Barton’s thighs, but Tony was only just getting the tip of Barton’s cock to the back of his throat when there was a cry of frustration. Clint lost that round. Tony pulled off his cock, careful to cover his teeth on the way. It made a wet mess on Clint’s thighs and Tony’s chin, but Tony just wiped at it with the back of a hand before popping his face halfway up onto Clint’s lap. “Who won that round?” he asked, as though he couldn’t see Steve taking his shoes off.
He could see Steve’s cock dangling next to Thor’s thigh, bumping into Thor’s leg on every thrust. Steve’s heavy balls bounced as well, untouched and needy. Forget teasing Steve with the camera; Tony was seriously considering how he could suck them into his mouth.
haircut. Did you know that Tony has some kind of late-century mustache kink going on here, or were you really just doing it for the laugh?”
“We are in control, Steve,” Tony assured, grinning. It was a lie, of course. Steve was calling the shots here, but it was a pretty illusion. “We are going to use you like a sex doll. We’re going to stretch you wide, fill you with our cocks, and leave your cock waving in the wind, untouched. We’re going to make you admit that you want to be our fuckdoll and we’re going to film it. We’re going to take pictures of you stuffed full of cock and whimpering for more.”
the way forward, his chin pressing up against Clint’s balls and his lips smashed hard around the base of Clint’s cock. Then he started to swallow again and again, making his throat constrict around Clint in tight ripples.
“Let us do so,” Thor agreed. Tony bit his lip and touched himself watching as Thor and Clint each worked a finger into Cap’s lubricated ass, each working it in deep and pulling.
Steve breathed out and Thor’s fingers slipped in a little further. Tony moved to get a better look. Most of the fingers were in to the second knuckle and his thumb was about halfway down. Not the thickest part of the stretch, but getting there. Tony set down the phone to pat Steve’s shoulder. He leaned in to whisper insistently, “Steve, you can still call red.”
“Clint Barton, have I ever showed you the first drink I tried on Midgard?” Thor asked. Clint smiled when he saw that Thor was getting undressed even as he said it, stripping entirely out of his clothes with ease.
“Indeed!” Thor seemed pleased, like a man in a pleasant memory. “It was a good evening with a good friend. We made his ancestors proud by engaging in this practice.” He shoved his cock- already hard because Thor had practically no goddamn refraction period- right into Tony’s mouth through the o-ring. And not a moment of hesitation before he started fucking Tony’s face in earnest, pounding in deep and pulling out most of the way each time. Tony choked and groaned trapped between those two cocks. While they’d planned this, Tony assured them all he could remain quiet as a piece of furniture too. Clint tried not to laugh.
Clint settled a hand on Tony's shoulder and planted a kiss on the corner of his mouth. "There's subspace and then there's
“Clint, do,” Clint teased, clearly amused by this latest kink in Cap’s frankly impressive gallery of kinks. Steve was definitely one of those guys whose still waters ran deep. While Thor popped open the lube so they could get Steve to the point where he could take a fist, Clint began to press his thumb into the already well-fucked hole. Steve’s ass took the thumb without resistance and he whimpered slightly.
“Yes, sir,” Steve agreed, cock bobbing. “That’s… that’s what I need.” And it really was. Since the serum, he had rarely had to go long without sex, and he’d just gone almost six weeks with nothing but his own hand.  A good hard smack on his right cheek and then pressure on his ass as Tony started
“Please,” Steve was whispering. “Clint, I want you to fuck me.” Like Clint wasn’t spreading Steve’s legs wide like a wishbone and driving into him so hard that he might have gone sprawling off Thor’s lap if Thor wasn’t hanging onto Steve's body, keeping him safe. Tony wanted to go over there and play with Clint’s strong chest and his nipples. Clint had nice nipples and Tony had never had a chance to bite them.
Tony looked a little dazed. “I did say something about that,” he agreed. “Get out and take off those shorts. As nice as they hug your ass, I want to be able to spread your thighs wide when I fuck you.”
for his pants and underwear, because he could be a very direct man), anted in without hesitation. Hard to know if he was actually that confident or if he was just bluffing that well. Steve and Thor joined them after a moment.
show-off here. Steve said something about beer that was just filling dead air and Clint nodded, responding on autopilot. They were all trying to pretend they weren’t watching Thor fucking Tony wide and coming in Tony’s ass. There was a beat and then Tony was moaning slightly as Thor pulled out. The god replaced the plug, picked up a marker from a tip jar on the bar, and made a tally mark on Tony’s ass. Then he picked up his whiskey and wandered back toward the television. “Surely
Sure enough, on the next commercial break, Steve was up and pounding Stark’s ass again. Maybe it was the serum, or maybe they just bred them horny in the good-old days, but Steve was a goddamn fuck machine. Clint supposed that he and Thor had probably stretched Stark out by now. Next time they gangbanged the guy, Clint better get in fast if he wanted Tony while his ass was tight. That was fine; he wouldn’t mind one bit coming on Tony’s face a couple more times, or he could always shove a few fingers in next to his cock if Tony’s mouth was too busy. Clint tried to pay attention to the commercials, but his eyes were consistently drawn to that fine ass moving as the super-soldier thrust and rocked.
Steve looked between them. “Maybe you can get me warmed up?” he suggested to Clint. “I was kind of hoping for…” His words trailed off and his ears were all red. That fair, Irish complexion showed everything.
Tony realized he’d just been standing, watching, and fantasizing for awhile, so he picked up the phone to get back to pretending to record this. Not like Steve wasn’t already worked up, his ass quivering and his cock hard, but Tony wanted to see how far they could push before he cracked. “One minute, Barton. I don’t have the shot. I need to record this for posterity.” He hummed a moment, like he was trying to get it just right, then chuckled. “Okay, now you can get back to wrecking his ass.” Yes, that was Steve making the little punched noise. Kinky bastard.
? Sure. Fuck him wide and pass him around like a party favor, as long as Tony kept rolling his hips just like
Steve hung onto Thor’s leg. “Thank you.” Tony could hear the aching sincerity in Steve’s voice and hung back just a little, afraid to sully the moment.
"Friend Tony," Thor said, touching Tony's side. "Perhaps it would be best if we released you. A moment only, and I will free your arms and legs." Tony made a little
, holding him in a modified bridal carry. There was a yelp of indignation, then Steve relaxed. "Okay. This works. You going to put me down?"
“If you think you can keep it up,” Tony agreed cheerfully and popped Clint into his mouth. He had only the first few inches when Clint gripped his hair a little harder and
“I can’t say you have, Thor.” Clint moved out of the way while Thor strolled around the bar, getting a large beer stein and a shot glass. Appalled, he asked, “Your introduction to human drinks was
A yellow cab drove up, dropping off a man in a well-fitted suit, sunglasses, and neatly trimmed facial hair. Steve felt a little self-conscious about the fuzzy catepillar he was sporting on his upper lip tonight, but the man in the suit only gave him a shiny smile and waved at the car. “This is it?” he asked.
of his fingers into Steve’s body. Steve began to groan. No doubt it was a hell of a strain, taking so much. It wasn’t even like Thor had small hands. Thor was big all over. But he was also very aware of his strength and had good control over it. They all knew Thor didn’t hurt anyone he didn’t want to hurt. “Breathe out,” Thor demanded. And then, “Breathe out, whore.”
It climbed up and up. Thor hated to bow out of a hand. He seemed to think it unmanly. And Steve was just stubborn. Barton only traded in a single card. Tony wondered if the guy was actually so lucky or so good a cheat that he could guarantee himself second place.
Clint shrugged and passed him a helmet. “Had a guess. Wanna bet you looked like the guys in all the terrible early porn he watched? Though, honestly, I think Stark has a kink for anything involving
, though. “This is a gorgeous ass. I can't wait to wreck it. Though I’ve really been dreaming about a mustache ride since I saw your face.”
Steve and Thor examined their cards. Thor winced a little. He had absolutely zero poker face. Steve bet ten chips and Tony immediately raised it to thirty. Let Barton bow out. But Barton (who was fully dressed
Thor began to work another finger in as well. Clearly, Steve was having a harder time taking it now, his legs spread as far as they would go. Tension came and went along his back in ripples as Steve tried to relax enough to take four fingers. “Hey, Steve,” he said quietly and waited a moment until he thought Steve was focusing. “You look like a slut.”
things just because he wanted them. “I can do that,” Clint assured. “Usual safeword if you really do want me to cut it out.”
Clint had his phone out. “You want it not to be pretend, you say the word,” Clint assured eagerly. “I’m all over that.”
A new term for Steve, but not one that he needed to ask about. It was reasonably obvious. Swallowing, he nodded, still bent over the engine. “Let’s get in the car. I’ll show you what I can do.”
He wandered off to the couch to drink his beer and watch the game, but he turned down he volume on the television and turned up his hearing aid, the better to hear his teammates take Stark apart with their rather godly dicks.
Once inside the safety of the bathroom, he immediately splashed some cold water on his face, scrubbing away the last of the drying tears from his earlier breakdown. God, what was wrong with him? First, he’d gotten some creep to threaten him enough that his ex-husband got involved, and then after Steve had gotten up in the middle of the night to come save Tony’s ass, Tony repays him by snotting up his shoulder and inviting him in for coffee he doesn’t even like. And Steve still looks so good it should be illegal, even in the beat up jeans and old brown leather jacket he was wearing that both probably predated their marriage.
“I’m trying to hurry,” Steve practically whined, gently pushing a snowman shaped cookie off the spatula he was holding. “We were in the middle of something!”
“Would you…” Steve hesitated. Tony waited patiently. “You wouldn’t want to sit and join me for a slice, would you?”
Tony looked up at him again, a shy half-smile gracing his face, crinkling the corners of his big brown eyes endearingly.
Maybe it was the comfort of knowing a Campus Safety officer was already on his way, or maybe it was the frustration of being on edge all night, but Tony answered.
Tony was suppressing a smile so hard his cheeks started to ache. “Darn, that sounds like you’re going to have to do it here in front of the fire with me around then.”
“Yeah, well, Christmas activities are in short supply in Malibu, so lets just take what we can get,”
Just as Tony pulled the covers over his shoulders and curled up on his side in bed, his phone rang. Frowning, he stuck one hand out to grab it off his nightstand and saw Steve’s contact photo staring up at him. A quick glance at the time confirmed to Tony that is was in fact 12:36 in the morning, which means that it is 3:36 in the morning in New York, a time that Steve always made sure to be fast asleep well before. He’s all about ‘healthy habits’ like ‘good sleeping schedules’ and ‘hydration.’
“Who cares about the cookies, oh my God, what were you thinking? Do we need to go to the hospital?” Steve babbled, letting Tony’s hand rest palm up in his own and inspecting it seemingly without actually seeing much.
Steve let out another sigh, and Tony almost regretted bringing it up again. They both knew the distance would be hard, and Tony very much did not like thinking about the time Steve thought it would be easier to break up than be so far away. Tony was lucky he convinced Steve’s stubborn mind out of that, the last thing he wanted to do was put the idea back in his head.
Finally, after a few too loud heartbeats, Tony clicked open the glass door he was leaning against. He stepped out carefully, ignoring the clenching in his stomach that told him he could still be grabbed or attacked or something. When nothing happened, Steve standing silently where he had stopped outside of his car, Tony finished the distance between them.
Honestly, Tony can barely remember how he’d first met the guy. He’d worked at the Manhattan hotel that Peter and Tony stayed at on the mini vacation they took during Peter’s spring break. Peter was in his second year at MIT and didn’t get to come home a lot during the semester, so when he’d mentioned missing New York, Tony suggested a trip downtown. He thought it would be fun to spend a few days at a hotel before Peter spent the last half of the week with Steve and then went back to Boston. And it had been fun; they went to a show on Broadway, got pizza from all the good places, shopped in Times Square, and it was
“I know,” Tony rolled his eyes. It’s the only reason he picked it, and why he knew it would probably end up in the final portrait. The picture showed the two of them at a table in McDonald’s at around three in the morning after seeing the newest Star Wars film in theaters. Tony was wearing his cheesy “Sith Happens” shirt and R2D2 hat while looking excitedly over a poster he had gotten at the theater. Steve, on the other hand, was sitting quietly to his left, a smiling look of adoration on his face as he listened to whatever Tony was rambling on about. Natasha had taken the shot, and as soon as Tony saw it, he immediately protested it’s existence  because of the overwhelming geek energy it had. He learned to stop arguing as he quickly realized Steve would fight tooth and nail over the picture, so Tony accepted it with a grumble.
A sob tore through the empty bathroom. Steve came back. Tony hadn’t seen him. It was a closed casket. He wouldn’t ever see him like he did that day at the pier.
“What happened? Is everything alright?” Tony asked, pushing up on his elbow in bed, as if he could suddenly run across the country from Malibu to New York if Steve needed him. A self-deprecating pang went through him at the thought that he couldn’t. If it were possible, he would have done that a hundred times already.
Mrs. Barnes knew. Tony had known the moment he showed up that she knew. He almost left, but she’d smiled kindly at him, greeted him like an old friend even though they’d never met in his life.
“No, I think Malibu softened you up too much,” Steve teased, “Just let me know when you need a break from the harsh indoor weather conditions,”
“Um,” Tony scratched the back of his head awkwardly. “Do you remember that old coffee you and Bucky broke playing uno?”
“Anywhere you have to be? Let me buy you a new one, to make up for it.” Jeremy offered, a new smile on his face as he shifted his weight closer.
“Would you rather stay out here for the night?” Steve asked with a raised eyebrow, so Tony just muttered a quick, ‘No,’ and climbed in, letting Steve close the door firmly behind him.
“How you were doing. How everyone was doing. I’d just sit there and wonder about it until I thought I went crazy with it.”
Tony blinked for a moment, still trying to comprehend the situation that was apparently happening, before bolting out of bed and nearly ripping the door off of its hinges. Sure enough, there stood Steve at the other end of the door, a duffle bag and backpack both slung on his shoulders, his phone pressed to his ear, and a tired, hopeful smile on his face. Tony felt his phone drop someone on the carpet before he flung himself into his boyfriend’s chest, disregarding the heavy bags he was still holding. Steve fumbled for a second trying not to drop everything, but Tony ultimately ended safely nestled against Steve’s chest, his arms tightly wrapped around his neck, face nuzzled into his shoulder, and his feet not touching the ground.
“Steve,” Tony said again, more serious this time. Something felt off, like Steve’s mind wasn’t in a place it was usually was. He’s listened to Steve talk after he’s had a bad day or failed a test, or when he was raging mad after fights with his boss or coworkers who don’t treat him well, or when he’s scared the night before one of his art showcases, or even after a showcase went extraordinarily well and he’s hopped on adrenaline at one in the morning, but this conversation was a different kind of energy. It almost felt like Steve was hiding something, and Tony wasn’t used to that. He thought they were beyond that in their relationship, especially since Tony moved away to follow Stark Industries, leaving Steve behind at school, and their relationship consisted more of talking than anything else.
Steve looked down at the piece of wood, tears slowly filling his eyes. “Steve…” Tony said gently, then opted to slot himself into his arms instead, wrapping his own arms around Steve’s waist and holding him close.
“Tell me about Aunt Nat’s machete party, take a few deep breaths, and get ready for bed, okay, Honey? It’s getting late and you should sleep.” Tony suggested gently.
He had been there for a little while, greeting some students who came and went, when his phone buzzed. He quickly glanced at the screen in case it was Peter, but saw it was from an unknown number.
Tony sighed internally, but tried to keep his voice light. “Remember that clerk from the hotel? Jeremy? I bumped into him on my way to work.”
The first time Steve saw him was Steve’s junior year. Tony was a sophomore, though Steve suspected he could be done and out of college if he’d really wanted to. Tony was...Tony was smart. He was quiet, but didn’t take any of the shit some of the idiots on the football team liked to dole out. Bruce Banner, Peter Parker...Steve wished he knew how to do more to stop the assholes that picked on anyone with an IQ above 15. Bucky was better at it than he was, but Bucky was graduating this year, and Steve could never quite capture the quiet elegance Bucky was able to disarm any bully with.
He took a deep breath, trying to ground himself in the here and now. In his Christmas Present. He shook his head again, and pushed himself off the bed, heading to the kitchen to watch his future flip some pancakes.
Steve clutched the letter as close as he dared to the low light in the tent. He couldn’t risk anyone catching sight of it over his shoulder. Everyone else was mostly asleep, and he knew he should be too, but he couldn’t stop rereading the letter.
“Tony! Oh my God, put that down!” Steve nearly screamed, grabbing a rag off the counter and using it to all but yank the pan out of Tony’s hand, making the cookies slide dangerously across the parchment paper. Tony started to make a grab towards them again, but Steve bodily pushed him back.
“Well, what did you want me to do after spending six months locked in a pissing contest with you? Call you up on a Sunday and say ‘Hey, it’s me, your ex-husband, just sitting here obsessively remembering every fault in our marriage again, thought I’d pop in to say hi’?”
“It was just a question,” Steve argued, but the smile growing on his face took any bite out of the words. “What makes you think it was about a person?”
“That was my boss. There’s a snowstorm in New York big enough to have shut down the airports for at least the next day or two. No flights in or out.”
“That’s really not necessary,” Tony denied, trying to keep a polite smile on his face even as alarm bells rang incessantly in his head, “I’m actually on my way to work, so I have to get going. It was nice to see you again.” Tony scooped up the now empty coffee cup and tried to sidestep where Jeremy was standing in front of him. Jeremy took the opportunity to take a step forward so that they met in the middle and put a hand on his waist.
The letters started coming first from an army camp, then later from Vietnam. The first time he’d seen that word on the letter he swore his heart stopped beating. Steve had reassured him in the letter, and the many more after that. Told him not to worry. Focus on school. How’s Rhodey? Holding the football team up okay? He met Bucky’s unit, which was more than either of them dreamed. Really, Tony, he was fine. Smile. Your eyes look so beautiful when you smile.
“I didn’t see him again.” Tony lied in a split-second decision, ignoring the side look Steve shoots him. “He was just a lot of talk. Probably gets his rocks off on freaking people out, but he seems harmless.”
“It’s Jeremy, from last week.” Jeremy said when Tony didn’t continue, as if they’d hit it off at a party and not shared two words at Jeremy’s place of work.
"Sure, Tiger, you're just a never-ending beacon of sexual energy," Steve responded with a monotone. "How about some pancakes to fill that voracious appetite?"
“Hey, Pete.” Tony replied, only just realizing how shaky his voice had been now that he’d switched into Dad mode and made himself speak calmly and surely. For Peter.
“I’m okay, just can’t wait to climb into bed with you,” Steve replied with a smile, which then turned a bit sheepish as he brought his nose quickly to the fabric on his shoulder. “After maybe a shower? I didn’t have time to after work before I had to get to the airport.”
Steve lifted his book away and pulled Tony so he was resting more comfortably on his lap. "What're you reading?" Tony asked once he was satisfactorily cuddled against his boyfriend.
“Come on, City Boy, I’ll buy you a hot chocolate,” Tony told him, steering them vaguely towards the exit but mostly letting Steve do the heavy lifting.
“Crazy for you,” Tony replied with a cheeky grin, then cackled as Steve rolled his eyes up and went back to probably reassessing how he ended up here.
“Come on,” Tony had said, shedding his apron and tossing it back into the kitchen. His eyes had a fresh sparkle to them. “Let’s go to the pier.”
“I lived in New York for a majority of my life too, you know,” Tony retorted back. “I know how to handle the cold,”
“Steve.” Tony breathed out almost silently. It had been…well, years wasn’t even an exaggeration. Once Peter had gotten his license, Tony never had a reason to see Steve anymore, even out a car window. Their divorce had nearly torn Tony to shreds, and while he’d never even so much as hint to Peter any negative thoughts about his Pops, that didn’t mean Tony would willingly visit him if he didn’t have to.
“Uh,” Tony stuttered, still trying to make sense of what he was seeing. The hotel he and Peter had stayed at wasn’t so far away that meeting him again was impossible, he definitely hadn’t ever thought it would happen.
"I don't know, none of them are very pleasant," Tony said, letting his eyes open a bit to see Steve's expression, "If you mean which one he learned the most from, I think it's the future."
At this, Steve grinned, yanking him closer more roughly than he had in the other room, and dragged him up into another kiss.
“Yeah? Okay, uh. Yeah. Coffee.” He unlocked the door and let Steve inside. “Sorry I don’t have tea. I know you like it better.”
But...Steve looked down at Tony’s picture again. He’d folded Pepper back so that only Tony’s smiling face looked up at him. Looking into brown eyes, grayed in the photo but still so lively, it felt a bit closer than a dream.
“I’m looking out there right now. You’re bluffing.” Tony insisted calmly despite the turmoil happening in his stomach.
Tony sighed, leaning forward so his forehead thumped onto Steve’s shoulder. “Steve, we’ve talked about this. You can’t just say these kinds of things so casually in the middle of a greasy ice rink concession stand —“
"No, thanks," Steve said, barely even looking anymore. "I need another beer." Probably just as well Steve wasn't feeling that ambitious, because Tony was wrecked. (Anyway, Clint wasn't sure if double-stuffing would count for one tally mark or two.) Clint managed to get a third finger in beside his cock while Steve drank his beer, and even a forth. Tony was, indeed,
Steve twisted to look at him and smiled. “Yeah, I’ll keep that in mind. Now… um…” He looked back at Thor. “I need to get down if Clint’s going to fuck me.”
Clint slid a finger in along his cock and heard Tony whimper a little around Thor's cock, his body still relaxed and passive. "Steve, you want to get in here with me?" he offered, sliding another finger in just to feel Tony's stretch around it.
Tony slid down carefully to his knees under the table, trying not to smack his head as he did. “Nope. You do what you gotta do.” He was face-to-face, so to speak, with Barton’s knees, but he gave them a little nudge and Clint spread his legs wide so Tony could get his mouth to more interesting places than knees. He waited until he heard Clint start to deal the cards out before he lapped a long, wet line up the inside of one strong thigh. He licked Clint slow and so high that his cheek brushed against Clint’s cock, probably scraping it faintly with his stubble.
Clint could feel himself filling out in Tony’s mouth, growing while Tony’s mouth watered around the intruder.  “Tackler can straight-arm tacklers in the face.” Clint explained to Thor and pushed in deeper, amused when he heard Tony gag a little on his cock... He and Tony had worked through most of their shit. Despite being a rich brat that had made his money off his daddy and the backs of the military, Clint also liked Stark. The guy could be generous and funny and fucked like a mink. And, anyway, he was Clint’s
"One of these days," Tony groaned, fighting not to come in two seconds, "we really are going to record this. You'd be the best porn star in the world."
"You did really good, man," Clint told Tony, taking his hand and chafing it. "But the scene is done. You alright there?" Steve came back and they pressed a bottle of cold water into Tony's other hand.
They laughed, but Clint ante-ed up anyway. “You want to try and whip our asses, you go ahead, Legolas,” Tony agreed. “No one is going to stop you.” He picked up his cards, glanced at Thor who still handled the playing cards as though they might tear in his hands like tissue paper, and resigned himself to another night of five card draw. He bet Barton played Omaha, and one of these days, the two of them needed to have a high-stakes games of their own, but they’d play nice for Thor and Steve.
Steve smiled like Clint gave him a gift, but ducked his head, even as he hurried toward the couch. “No.”
Tony twisted the top back onto his flask and tossed it down before reaching for his belt. “You want to see what’s going to be fucking you?” he asked. “Don’t worry. With that monster stretching you, even I’m not going to really hurt you, baby.” He flicked open the top button, slipped open the fly, and pulled himself out. Apparently Tony wasn’t wearing underwear tonight either. He was also hard enough that fitting into those slacks could not have been easy. “Come here. I want to ride your face.”
Thor’s big hands supported Steve's body as Steve changed positions, sliding off Thor’s lap to be stretched across both the Asgardian’s knees. Thor stroked the back of Steve’s neck and slowly traced down the bumps of his spine, sweeping down the warm skin toward his bare ass. “You must recall, it will not be
“Jesus, Stark,” Clint grumbled. Tony only laughed and wrapped a hand around Clint’s balls, weighing them a little in his hands, playing with them. He was going to blow the archer, but nothing said he couldn’t take his time at it. After all, if Clint kept winning, Tony wouldn’t get to fuck Steve across the table, and that was no fun.
“Fuck, Stark,” Clint said, his chair sliding back. He tugged Tony to follow along with him. Tony’s knees ached a little with shuffling along on the carpet, but he managed, and the grumbling noises deep in Tony's throat made Clint whine. “Fuck, I’m going to come down your throat before I even get a chance to fuck our winner.”
Steve whimpered, on his knees on the couch with his hands curled around his inner thighs, spreading them. “Clint, don’t…”
, which counted for more than any of that. But Clint still got a kick out of hearing the rich asshole choke on a cock.
“Sure would,” Tony agreed, fellowing Steve who popped the hood and leaned over it to gesture at a few of the highlights. Really, the lot they had chosen to meet in was so poorly lit, it wasn’t as though Tony would be able to see much.
Clint carefully removed the gag after that. It had been fun fucking him through the ring, but they didn't want to hurt him and Tony was so out of it by now that it barely mattered. Clint slipped two fingers into Tony's mouth and Tony barely twitched. Clint smiled and asked Thor to bring
Steve laughed, finally lightening up a little. “Is that the official term? NFL Regulation No-No?” Clint could see Steve staring as he fucked Tony’s face, still struggling. The kid wasn’t a virgin before his big sleep, but he knew jack-all about kink. No, Steve had known about spanking. And
Steve was drifting closer, clearly trying not to ruin the scene by looking directly at Tony too much. The
Steve was still alternating between rigid spasms and going utterly boneless, moaning softly in some combination of pain and ecstasy. Tony shivered, staring at Steve: at the helpless line of his neck, at the contortion of his face, at his wrecked hole stretched around Thor’s wrist. He should say something else snarky about posting the footage, but he was
full of money, because Tony never knew how far to take a role play. “I owe you and Natasha for making me get
“Fuck,” Barton said, and a hand settled in Tony’s hair, tugging for just a second. “Trying to focus up here. You want to slow down a little?”
