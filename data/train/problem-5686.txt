“Hold up. He’s on the move,” said Scott. This time Tony took the sports car. He stopped by to pick up pizza and the grocery store.
So he ended the discussion and sent them home.
They hugged one another. It’ll be a long time before Steve sees his best friend again.
“It’s the Cloak! Get out of there Pete! Before it tells on you,” said Nat.
Steve sat on the old bench looking towards the lake. He heard Sam walk towards him.
Steve rushed out and pushed away Tony in time for the shot to miss. Knowing failure, the alien assassin sent a group of extraterrestrial looking mercenaries after Tony. Tony suiting up his Iron Man armor and Steve in combat stance quickly defended one another. “Who
Clint eyed Tony as he walked out of the room to take a call. Tony had been doing that quite frequently, going out of meetings at times.
,” he saw the hurt in Steve’s eyes.
“You know what I need??”
“Like it’s someone else’s,” Sam answered.
A firm grip held him tight, supporting him. He turned to see Steve Rogers’ blue eyes staring right back at his. He can’t think about him now, not after what happened. He needs to find Pepper.
“Thank you.”
Before leaving for base, he packed something he kept for a long time. The star spangled frisbee. He opened the wrapping to see it. The shield gleamed as if it was still brand new. He finds that he didn’t harbour much resentment as he thought he would. Steve really hurt Tony bad the last time and he had called out Steve on it when they reunited. If they needed to succeed as a team, they both need to move past this. He still didn’t really know what Steve Rogers meant to him now. They may not have worked out as a couple but seeing Steve again after all these years made Tony realize he needed his friend back in his life. He missed his banter, giddy optimism, leading the team alongside him, hell, even his prudishness to language. They were different people now than they were and he hoped that it was enough to move forward.
“Off course!! I’ll bet 25 Midgardian money on my brother Loki, ” said Thor, rummaging his pockets for cash. “Now that he has returned and is making amends. I have noticed he is spending a lot of time with fair Tony.”
“Well, all three of them will be back from that mission by tomorrow morning so we’ll begin tomorrow,” said Rhodey.
“Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark! Wait up!” called Peter.
Tony let out his breath that he had been holding in. ‘To be honest, I don’t know what I want. I thought I had found something as close to a family with the Avengers. And then, you had to lie to me. Time and time again you chose your metal arm friend over me. Speaking of him, where is he? Where is
He immediately draws up all the possible scenarios that could go wrong with this plan.
“Cap?”
“Is it too late to change my bet?” asked Bruce.
Rhodey raised an eye brow. ‘You know who I’m talking about.’
It’s been five years since Tony came back from Titan. Five years since the Avengers took out Thanos. But they were too late. The stones were destroyed and everything stayed the same. They could not bring the others back. Since then, Tony had built a life with Pepper, and another miracle he had not expected, Morgan Stark. Tony was happy. He could not have asked for more though he wished he did not find his happiness on the world’s loss.
‘All right, Tony. It’s your call,’ said Steve picking back up the semi-automatic.
Tony snapped out of his thoughts. ‘I’m sorry. Call who?’
Steve was on his way getting into position to intercept the scepter when he heard Tony. “Ugh, Mr. Rogers, I almost forgot that that suit did nothing for your ass.”
On the way out, SHIELD was already searching for them so he hid in an office. It had to be
This is so inappropriate. Well, he had gotten used to it when Tony used to flirt with him on comms during the mission. He used to blush at Tony’s comments and his teammates would laugh. “Urghh. Get a room already you two.” He couldn’t suppress a smile forming on his face.
“You’re right, kid. It’s not,” said Clint.
“So this was all a show?” asked Scott.
“Mr. Stark came out of the shower, I think, his hair is still wet and he has a towel,” whispered Peter.
The others could now hear Tony and Stephen. “Enjoying the ice cream Stephen?”
“I’m happy for you. Truly.”
Steve added “And after what we’ve been through, I only want what’s best for Tony. Someone who fully accepts Tony, appreciate and love him for who he is.”
“Thank you Loki, for looking out for me,” said Tony.
“I’m done for. Again,” moaned Thor.
The bullets stopped coming. Tony reopened his visor. ‘Thank you Tony. And...if  you need me, us, you know how to reach me,’ said Steve.
“Well, thank you, Steve Rogers. For saving me today. Hey, you wanna grab a meal with me? As a thank you, I mean.”
“I knew it!” said Clint.
“Cockroach,” finished Scott lamely.
voice echoed in Tony’s head. Tony eye-rolled to himself and deliberately tried to brush it aside. He looked up and saw Cap’s shield staring back at him. The shield looked to be in pretty good shape except for the three deep cat claw marks courtesy of T’Challa. As mysterious as the nation itself, the Black Panther slipped back to its Wakandian civilisation. Tony wished he could have had a longer chat with King T’Challa.
“I said we’d lose. You said, “We’ll do that together too.” Well, guess what, Cap? We lost, and you weren’t there. But that’s what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We’re the Avengers? We’re the Avengers. Not the Prevengers, right?” Tony spat at Steve.
“Neither could I.”
Tony was once again alone. He pondered on Rhodey’s words for awhile. Then, he walked towards his study room, pulled out his desk drawer to retrieve the black cell phone that was sitting in there.
A sports car was heading towards the Base at top speed. He finds himself smiling already. There he is. Smug bastard already accurately guessing they could not fix the Doidge proposition.
Still he can’t let go of the idea. He stared at the picture of him and the kid.
“Like a married couple?” teased Rhodey. He laughed as he high fived Nat.
Later at two, Tony, Steve, Stephen, and Loki walked into the meeting room full of the Avengers.
one. Came out of nowhere. Bruce even screamed,” said Peter.
‘I do not miss Ste- that old Stars and Stripes,’ said Tony indignantly.
Peter quickly made his way back to his exit and got out of dodge. He was not sure if Levi actually would tell on him to Doctor Strange but it would just mean Mr. Stark and Doctor Strange would only know that Peter tried to sneak in. Normal by all Spidey standards. They would not know about Operation TBF.
Rhodey tried to calm him down but enough was enough. “Why that otherwise, that what we needed was a suit of armor around the world! Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not, that’s what we needed.”
"And Black Widow!"
Flash quickly grabs Peter having him in a headlock with the upper hand. But Peter using a bit of his super strength pulls Flash off of him throwing him down on the mat "Flash I don't want to hurt you."
~~~~~~~
A few of the students give a gasp from those who still didn't believe that Peter's internship was real. "So anyone have any questions for Peter?" Tony says.
B. Peter's class go to the training area meeting the other avengers along with Nat and Clint, where Flash gets what he deserves.
"Come on Peter punch him already!!" MJ yelled
Peter rolls his eyes lucky Bucky didn't hear that or else he'd tear Flash to pieces. Bucky hated it when other men spoke about his wife that way. Getting out of his thoughts when pops started to speak to the class in his PSA voice.
Getting to the museum on the second floor the class stepped out of the elevator marveling (no pun intended) at the different exhibit at all the different heroes outfits mostly Ironman and taking pictures of whatever they could. Before Olivia steps up front of the class "Okay everyone welcome to the museum here you'll be able to look at all the information that Stark industries have of the avengers."
Peter looks up at him "Really dad? You'd do that?"
"What did Steve say? No weapons aloud? I'm sure I heard that though it looks like you didn't!" she growls. Tony comes up looking down at Flash angry while looking back at Peter who was getting helped up by Clint and Bucky.
Tony chuckles "Yeah Pete you're my kid now. Though don't tell anyone about me being nice I have a reputation you know." he smirks, Peter couldn't help but let out a laugh "I won't dad. You're the best!"
Everyone nodded in agreement to it. Flash raised his hand "does Parker work on this floor?"
Everyone was taken to lunch most of the students were drooling over the food that they got from the cafeteria. About how good this looked better than the school lunch that they got, though Peter could really care less for this food it'd never beat his family's cooking.
Once Flash comes down Tony gives a fake smile shaking his hand "hey kid what's your name?"
Tony sits down on the edge of the bed handing him one of the cookies Jordie baked "Tell you what bud how about on that day you stay at the tower and work in the lab?"
Peter coughs having some students give him a look and start to move out of the way. He groans really hating this cold "it's a good thing that she's on the avenger's side." going over to his exhibit it showed his first Spiderman suite that he made himself Ned squeals with excited "dude this is so cool! I can't believe you got an exhibit here! I can't get over that you're afraid of spiders when your Spiderman" he whispers. Peter rubs the back of his neck blushing from embarrassment "it's not all that great.."
Anyway this is a very important Authors Note so please don't skip it. I've decided to discontinue this story, hold on put the pitch forks and torches first and let me explain. The reason is that I'm thinking of possibly rewriting the story, I don't know when but it'll come to me and I'll start writing it done the line.
Tony speaks up "So that fight was to stay silent about it and hope you get lucky? Though you know we're always there to help you no matter what the hell it is."
I've been debating if I should have Flash and Erica return in one of the last two chapters for this story, but I want to see what you guys think.
Olivia scowls at Erica "Okay then why don't we just test it out. Peter honey why don't you come up and show everyone." Gulping Peter shakenly walks up to the scanner and puts his finger up to it.
Miss Erica laughed "oh dear, I think you've mistaken for a different Peter everyone knows at the school of his lies. You probably just didn't print him one as he wasn't aloud on this trip."
Peter: bye mama spider!
"Enough Peter, your lucky I haven't told the principle about this. Though I'll make sure you get some easy packets of work to have for the day we're on the field trip for you. Now please leave."
Peter gives a worried look "Пожалуйста, не делайте ему больно!" he begs the other students were surprised that Peter spoke perfect Russian back to her. Miss Erica then chimes in "Peter! I swear if you are insulting the black widow to her face. I'm going to send you straight to the principle's office once we get back!" believing what Flash said.
Flash overheard what they were saying "Yeah right fatso! Penis probably hacked the AI and paid the tour guide to say she knew him."
Peter laughs a little though he hopes that Clint doesn't at the same time.
When getting to the lab Shuri helped bandage Peter's arm, while Wade gave his baby boy comforting cuddles and kisses on his cheek. Having Peter blush with embarrassment it was enough to have his family embarrass him but his boyfriend now just raises the kill me now meter.
Maybe that's just what happened with the last chapter and I didn't know it...
Makayla scared wraps herself around Peter. "Well, the one holding my hand is Morgan Stark Mr. Stark's daughter." and Peter wasn't lying Morgan was his Dad's pseudo daughter until he announces that he's married to Captain America and that Peter is now his son.
Jordie smiles "Well I'm glad that you aren't going to be harassed and bullied anymore. I really had to hold Shadow back so she wouldn't eat them."
Miss Erica came storming up to Peter face full of anger "I can't believe you! I told you that you couldn't come and you just come walking in!" Peter was confused on why his class was here. Wait.. he mentally facepalmed himself of course this would be why it was a surprise!
Nat: little spider! Clint saw what happened to you in the laboratories, can you point out that Flash, baby?
"oh shit.." Peter mumbled.
"Yeah it sucks."
"Cheers! For Peter surviving his field trip!" Nat says
"Good question it's so that none of the inventions that are made here don't get stolen by rival companies."
Peter knew about the badges well coming in different levels and colors and for himself, Dad, Aunt Pepper, and the rest of the avengers used a finger scan since they're here most of the time. By the time he got out of his thoughts Olivia finished handing out the passes.
Peter growled raising his fist but realized if he did this using his super strength to hurt Flash he'd be just as terrible as him. Putting his fist down letting out a breathe replying "Nothing. I'm not going to do anything to you Flash." he turns around while flash laughs "HA! Knew your just a pussy!"
Peter nods "yeah that's about it really." before sitting back down. "So your cold getting better to go to school tomorrow?" Steve asks
Tony puts a hand on Peter's shoulder "don't worry bud if he tries anything we're going to kick him out along with the bitchy teacher." he whispers to him having giving Peter a hopeful smile.
" before wrapping herself around Jordie's neck in the shape of a necklace with her eyes sticking out.
"Doing okay.. I've been sick most of the day and harassed by Flash and miss Erica but dad took care of it. So did everyone else actually... umm why is everyone down here?"
"Petey you promise that you'll get better so we can play again soon?" the little girl asks. Peter nods "I promise Makayla don't worry." he rubs her head making her giggle "Yay!" she hugs him and kisses his cheek "feel better soon Petey."
Finishing up his homework Peter heard a knock on his door "Hey Pete can I come in?" Tony said peaking in. Looking up Peter nods "yeah you can come in dad." opening the door all the way Tony steps in "Happy told me about what happened at school."
Still Nat: Nevermind
"I'm sorry but that's classified young man, I can only tell you that he's the personal inter of Mr. Stark." Olivia replied with an annoyed face with how much this kid wants to prove Peter doesn't work here.
Everyone started to step back as Miss Erica's legs were getting wet. She literally just pissed on herself! "I'm not the one you should be apologizing to." he growled
"Yes, miss Erica." he replies.
Peter laughs "yeah one more kiss." they kiss on the lips before Peter leaves to go to his lab. Makayla waves goodbye "bye Petey!"
"Well then, please feel free."
"I did until Miss Erica threw the bag away when I got here."
"Why can't we take any pictures?"
A knock came from Peter's door waking the boy up from his sleep. It opened showing Clint, Jordie, and Makayla. Makayla is Jordie and Bucky's daughter she was four years old with light blue eyes and brown hair like her dad and loved to play with Peter whenever she came over to visit. Clint gave the soup to Jordie and signed 'Pepper told me to make soup for you after hearing you were sick I was happy to do it.'
Peter shakes his head "No, to be honest this food isn't as good as my family's cooking."
"To bad Flash is missing out on this."
"okay then." when Peter got to the elevator FRIDAY continued "up to the penthouse as usual Peter?" she asked
Peter gives a smile "Thanks hap."
Flash gives a smirk to Peter "Flash Thompson I hope to be a real intern here." this was really getting on his nerve.
Taking out a cookie once back at the tower in mid bite, there was a gasp... actually multiple gasps when Peter looks around he sees his Chemistry class everyone staring at him.
"Ew. No Wade I mean about your regeneration power."
They hug for a quick second before pulling apart. Tony gets off the bed and starts heading back out "Make sure to come down for dinner soon. Also don't forget to take your binder off before bed remember the last time."
Jordie makes a small giggle "So do you know when my sister and T'Challa will be getting here to see us?"
~~~~~~~
Peter: This is normal, I can handle it.
The other students were amazed looking at two more avengers and the two most powerful people in the world. Tony walks up to Miss Erica "Now I understand you've been very abusive to my intern, and let me tell you!" he poked her in the chest "that your lucky that you aren't going to jail! If I see insult or accuse him again I'm going to make sure you don't teach at any school again! At most you'll be working in the fast food industry."
Clint signs to him 'If they keep it up by the time you get to the training room I'll send one of my tranquilizer arrows at them' before handing Peter some cough drops to take at lunch.
Wade puts a hand up in front of her face "woah there missy I have a man already. Well more of a twink since he's on the bottom when we have-"
Goodbye my lovely readers of this story. Even though I made a terrible mistake I hope you will stick around for my other stories and possibly this one for when I come back to it.
Peter shrugs "Well now that Flash and Miss Erica are gone. I think it's going to start to be better now, though I don't know where they're going to now."
They started to walk together heading to the front of the school building "yeah it sucks, but hey at least if it's boring I'll miss out."
Makayla looks up from crying and hugs him "Petey!" as she continues to cry into his shoulder. Peter rubs her head "shh. shh. Don't worry it's okay Kay. Morgan do you know what's going on?"
"Mr. Parker!" Miss Erica shouted
Looking back at MJ peter asks "so um.. would you like to come by once in awhile and hang out?"
"Yeah it's because I can't go on a field trip."
With that everyone starts to go in different directions of the museum. Peter walked over to Shadow's exhibit likely where the other students who didn't know about Shadow were there reading her information. Peter even started to read some himself.
"Please feel free to look around but we only have 15 minutes until we go to lunch, so I advice you to stay close to this area so you won't get lost."
"What if it's not?"
"Hey Pete!" Liz called walking over to him giving him a hug "How you've been lil'Stark?"
"I'll have Ned get pictures for me." Peter smirks holding up his phone, MJ chuckles "you two are made for each other."
Steve stood in the middle as the ref "ready fight!"
Once he got himself together Peter headed back towards the group this time staying close to Ned and MJ if Flash were to come close again. "Hey loser- woah what the hell happened to your eye?" MJ said in a worried but still chill tone.
Meanwhile Tony was leading the group of students to his and Peter's labs. "Okay everyone last stop on the tour. I'm taking you guys to my lab along with my personal intern's as well, just don't touch anything and no pictures."
"Today a few of you will get to practice sparing with one of us, just need to go over a few rules first. Rule number one don't try to go easy on us give your full strength to us, second there will be no weapons aloud when sparing, finally have some fun."
"Don't be mean to Peter! He's nicer than you'll ever be! My mommy and daddy can do mean things to you if you don't!" she continues.
Taking peter by his arm she starts to drag him over to a bench "When we get back to the school I'm sure to have you suspended for a month at least! Or maybe the whole year with all the trouble you caused!"
They both laugh before stopping "Do want a picture of autograph with the avengers?" MJ nods "Yeah I'd love to get a picture or two with some of my favorite heroes."
Peter smiles giving a small Wave as Tony left the room.
Peter gives a warm smile "Don't worry it'll be okay. Come on I'll call Mr. Stark and he'll get you back to Aunt Pepper." he pulls Makayla in front of him "and you back to your mommy to~" he rubs his nose against hers making her giggle stopping any other tears that were going to fall.
Author needs help figuring out for the next chapter has three things planned but needs readers help.
Finishing his waffles Peter gets the thermometer and takes his temp. Seeing his cold was down to 99.9 still a bit high but not contagious, though so his dads wouldn't kill him he put a surgical mask over his face.
Peter makes a little growl "you know I hate that Shuri."
"Shut up! You lying brat! I don't want to hear another word from you!"
When Peter got to the tower he waved to the receptionist at the desk her name was Olivia "Hey Peter how was your day?"
"Okay everyone this is where some of our scientists help make inventions to help different places in the world that are going through a tough time right now." Olivia explained in the simple version of it. "Please don't take any pictures while we're here." a student raised their hand "Yes?" Olivia asked
Shadow growls "
(See the end of the chapter for
Then a fangirl scream was heard followed by "It's Hawkeye!"
She takes her mother's hand and they leave the room. Shadow peaks out from Jordie saying "
“Yes,” he breathed.
“You stole my pants,” he laughed holding up a smaller pair.
“You know that Nat and Clint have a bet about what we're doing up here?” Tony threw his head back and laughed.
“Banner and I were doing research,” he argued.
“Yeah I know,” Tony sighed letting his arms drop and allowing Steve to pull himself out. He gasped as he slipped out and watched his cum drip down the geniuses leg.
“You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony. War isn't one of them.”
“- that would end the team,” he barked. “Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the "why" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?!” That’s when Steve took the log he was holding and ripped it in half like it was paper. Tony felt his heart jump a bit after that.
“But you like it darlin’,” Tony murmured nibbling his ear gently.
“Tony if you hate me that much, then we should really talk before tomorrow when we fight for our lives,” he insisted. Tony lifted his head and looked up at him with red, bloodshot eyes.
“Yeah, pay up,” she said holding out her hand with a grin.
“Whatever man,” Clint put his hands up and turned away.
“Oh uh sorry,” he stuttered.
“Are you -”
“I wouldn’t say so,” Steve frowned.
“But you guys just wouldn’t get it, Thor would’ve -”
“And here I thought that was your job,” Steve joked, massaging Tony’s thighs.
“I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part.”
“So you’ve done this before huh? Was it a guy?”
“Shit Tony… I’m gonna cum,” he moaned letting go of Tony’s head to let him up. Tony pushed himself all the way down while gripping Steve’s thighs. “Fuck -” he cried out reaching to grip Tony’s shoulders tightly as he rode out his orgasm. He barely registered Tony swallowing around him as he came and dropped his head back on the pillow breathing heavily. Tony pulled his head up, giving his dick one last lick before crawling up his side and nuzzling Steve’s neck .
“The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark. Playing on your fear.”
“Fuck me?”
“Don’t you think this is a bad idea?” he managed, suppressing a moan while Tony began sucking on his neck.
“Just stay there… I need a second,” he grimaced.
“I want ya to come for me then, I’ll make you go twice” Tony encouraged as he descended on his dick once again.
“Sit up.”
“Mhm makes sense. How do you like it so far?” Tony clenched around him and it drew a filthy moan from his mouth.
“Good,” Tony whispered, pressing his body against Steve’s and kissing the center of his bare chest.
“Just sit for a minute sweetheart,” Tony purred softly.
“So the great Captain does swear?”
“Just breath,” he pulled back smiling.
“Yeah they’re both dickheads,” Tony said fondly. “If we tell them that we did both, do they both lose the bet?”
“Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him,” he pointed out going for another log.
“I’m sorry I really didn't mean to… to get, um -”
“Mhm.”
“The worst part is that you didn't?” Fury asked standing. “Or maybe your feelings for teammates are getting out of hand,” he muttered with a sly grin.
“Steve, I need your dick inside me right now.”
“You should've mentioned it sooner,” Tony smirked, dropping his hands on either side of his head.
“If it’s a bad idea then you should probably stop me,” he muttered before leaning back down and sucking on another part of his neck.
“Shut up,” he whispered, wrapping an arm around the engineer.
“I don't think I can stop you.”
“Normally I would be sorry but these are really, really, comfortable,” Tony responded with a sly grin as he hopped back onto the bed.
“Hopefully one day I’ll believe you,” he whispered. Tony rolled himself over and pulled Steve’s arms around him and they fell asleep in a tangled mess of limbs.
“What? Yeah of course.”
“Barton, I hate you. Tell Natasha I hate her too,” he scorned sarcastically. Barton only continued to smile while he walked up the stairs with his duffle bag slung over his shoulder. He took a deep breath and pushed open the door to the large guest room where Tony sat on the bed staring at the wall.
“You’re lucky those look good on you or I would take them back,” he droned, pulling on boxers and crawling into the bed behind the engineer who rolled over to look at him.
It was the week of the field trip and through out said week Peter was not feeling well. He knew that he was sick but didn't want to have anymore absences for school, In class Peter had his head down from a headache. "Peter you don't look so well, are you alright?" Ned asked taking a seat next to his friend.
Jordie peaks out from the kitchen holding a tray of cookies for everyone "Why won't they let you go on the field trip?" she asks
Jordie waves to him "good morning Peter!"
A. Peter's class goes to his lab meeting Shuri and Wade along with another OC I put into the story for my friend
Don't worry I know Pepper, Bucky and Shadow didn't say much but they will next chapter I promise.
Natasha clenches her jaw "Неважно"
Peter sighs knowing that for the rest of the day he was going to get embarrassed more by his dad "Oh and get one of the janitors to clean his mess up Fri."
After everyone got their questions answered it was now time to get on the bus and go back to school. Once getting down to the lobby almost all the avengers that were met today were down there including T'Challa and Jordie's sister Elizabeth.
"okay dad. Can it be after breakfast? I have yet to try one of uncle Clint's waffles." he grabs a plate taking three waffles from a big plate that was out to have the waffles on for the others to pick from.
"How come?"
Peter smiles "thank you Makayla I love it very much."
"Это нормально, я справлюсь." Peter says in reassurance
With everything that was said Tony let the students through the door. As everyone walked in the marveled at all the inventions and at how big this lab was compared to the other labs that they saw during the day.
Clenching his fist Peter stood up "Don't talk about my aunt like that Flash!" Flash squints getting up taller than Peter looking down at him "or what are you going to do Penny? Cry? Have your fake boyfriend come to your rescue? Have the avengers you paid to beat me up?  Huh what are you going to do Penny Parker! What are you going to do!"
~~~~~~~
"Mr. Leeds, Mr. Parker what's going on?" the teacher asked coming up to them she was much nicer than the other one with the field trip and was concern for her students.
Wade: Hey bb thought I'd come by to see you today <3
"That's the surprise part miss moon. Now each of you will be getting a permission slip that I want signed and brought into next week." She starts to put a paper on each student's desk except for Peter, he was confused at first but maybe the teacher just forgot to hand him one.
Hello all! Man it's been a really long time since I've been back with this story. I'm still amazed of how popular it still is haha!
Clint then started to sign while Jordie translated for him "When we're done with that you guys can spar with each other and maybe we might decide you could be the next avenger." hearing that everyone started to mumble that they could possibly be a next avenger. Peter knew that it wasn't true as it takes more than just strength to become an avenger.
"Thompson for this action and multiple accounts of bullying today caused by you! You are banned from this tower, don't even try to think of getting an internship here!" he yells
translation of Peter and Natasha
Peter looks down disappointed "okay ma'am." He leaves the classroom walking to his locker to gather his things and go meet happy outside the school. Then the locker was slammed shut "Hey Penny, I'm not surprised you weren't allowed on the field trip because of your 'internship' " flash mocked calling Peter by his dead name.
~~~~~~~
"I believe that would be us." a voice said behind them.
"Cheers!!!" everyone says clinking their glasses together. Then enjoying the rest of their dinner and doing whatever else for the night.
Google, he said, and Tony wanted to grab him by his perfect shoulders and shake him until he gets it into his perfect head that ‘it’s just
A laugh from Sam. “Oh buddy, you’re in for a lot of surprises.”
“Well?” Tony can’t help but ask.
He shakes his head and lifts up his glass, taking a sip of his Whiskey. His eyes move from one person to the next, and he does a quick headcount: Natasha is there, Bruce and Thor as well, one of Thor’s warrior friends who came to earth a few weeks ago on some official Asgardian Business, and they’re all passing a joint around.
“Oh, hey, Tony. The bomb’s dealt with,” He says over the comms to inform Sam, as well.
“You okay there, Cap? What’d the stove do to you?”
Tony punches him back, only slightly lessening the blow because Steve can take it and honestly, he kind of deserves it.
“Oh, Tony, perfect, hi! I’m having problems with this machine. I’d wash my clothes by hand but there’s an ugly stain in one of the pants that I can’t get out…” He trails off and looks at Tony with those stupid puppy-dog-eyes and Tony can’t refuse. (He’s pretty sure it’d be actual treason to refuse Captain America’s puppy-dog-eyes.)
“Yeah, hang on, there’s just some fucking -” There’s sounds of a fight coming through the comms, and Tony winces at what sounds like some bones breaking. Then Steve speaks up again. “Sorry. Just some damn soldiers, they’re taken out. Anyway, I’ve almost got the bomb dismantled.”
“It’s just
Steve punches his shoulder, lightly. “Sure, Tony.”
He’s halfway out the door when Steve calls out his name. “I just put an apple pie in the oven, hence the stain. Wanna join me in, say, thirty minutes? I’ll even make whipped cream.” He grins at Tony, his stupid, perfect grin, and Tony is just a man, after all.
“Oh, Tony, good morning!” Steve turns to look at him briefly, then turns back to the stove, looking at the installed touchscreen. “I was just trying to boil some eggs, but I can’t seem to turn the stove on. Why does everything have to have some kind of touchscreen nowadays?”
There he goes again. Tony blankly stares at the wall across the room.
So he’s rather confused to hear swearing come from the room when he passes it on his way to his lab one evening. (
Tony claps his hands together. “Well, I’m off. New things to invent, countries to save, all that jazz.”
He expected many answers, but a giggle was not one of them.
This is about the hundreth time this week Steve has asked Tony about modern technology he doesn't understand, and Tony is about to lose his goddamn mind. (
could hack into a program set to detonate a bomb.
They all exclaim good-byes of various enthusiasm and Steve waves with the arm that isn’t occupied by a high sleepy redhead.
“Is that a
Tony looks at his perfect
“Yeah, fine, just – since when do you know how to hack?”
He walks into the kitchen they all have access to on Sunday morning to find Steve standing in front of the stove with an angry frown on his face.
Luckily, Tony avoids endless teasing by not burning the omelette, and ten minutes later finds the two of them sitting at the big table with their coffee and their plates and their newspaper (on a tablet for Tony, the print version for Steve).
Tony scoffs. “I’ll have you know that I actually do know how to cook. I might almost set my lab on fire every now on then, but I’ve never fucked up a meal.” He cracks open some eggs into a bowl, adds spices, moving around Steve while doing so. The stove is turned on with two taps to the touchscreen. “See, it’s that easy. And anyway, anything I make is bound to be better than your salt-and-boil method of cooking.”
go either way. I think Steve is not really over Tony. I mean I’ve seen the way he looks at Tony. Steve’s ma man so I gotta back him up,” handing a 50 over to Nat.
“It may not meaning anything or it could mean something,” replied T’Challa cryptically.
“A cockroach,” Tony restated flatly. Eyebrows raised at them.
They retired in a cottage in the woods, away from the public eye, where Tony still spent his days in the workshop working the latest invention with Steve helping him out. When he’s not in the workshop, Tony would help Steve cook and clean. After that, they would sit by the couch leaning into each other, watching the telly. Other times, Steve and Tony took turns to surprise one another, whether is an outing, a dance or coming home to giant teddy bear, they made it work. Steve was no longer the man out of time. He had lived a full and happy life with Tony. Once Tony had eventually passed, he knew it was time to return back to his own timeline.
‘How have you been?’
“And where is that?” said Scott.
Rogers’ exact words to Tony. As if that enough was justification. Tony impulsively grabbed the shield and slammed it against his desk table.
“I’m Steve Rogers,” said Steve simply while fighting off the onslaught.
He still remembered his first words to Steve.
‘Bring you in?’ Tony scoffed. ‘Ross gave a shoot on sight order. He doesn’t
“Though it was rather fun watching you cheer and squabble among yourselves on the bet,” grinned Loki. “Thanks brother for the vote of confidence by the way.” Thor grinned back.
“Doctor Stephen Vincent Strange. This one really came out of nowhere but I suppose love comes to find you when you least expect it. When we started out, the level of snark between us -”
Tony had been effectively dodging his calls and efforts to apprehend Rogers and his team. If Tony had put his mind to it, there was no way that Rogers and the others would have evaded capture for so long.
“Yasssss,” said Nat who was trying her best to sound low key.
The quarters was mostly silent these days. Most of them were on the run. Nat went into hiding, presumably she met up with her buddy Clint and the rest of Star Spangled Club. Rhodey spent most of his time in rehab training to walk again. That left the Vision.
A couple of more months down, Tony spent his time supporting Rhodey on his journey to recovery. He had to admit that his good friend was coping well, all things considered. He could now walk slowly without support which was fantastic seeing as the doctors were initially not optimistic that he could walk again.
“I can’t right now.”
“They’re about to start,” said Bucky.
“Nat and Clint had to exterminate it,” finished Rhodey. Everyone nodded together.
He saw Steve, Nat and
“We’ll see,” said Rhodey.
“What’s that? Say that one more time kid,” said Tony.
Peter took a deep breath. “I wanted to ask, who is your new boyfriend? Cause...see...we know you’re seeing someone, but we just don’t know who it is.”
“You wanna join in on the bet?” asked Scott.
some of my Midgardian pop culture
Despite all odds, they made it back with the Tesseract. After experiencing what they’ve been through, Steve vowed that he’d do whatever it takes to protect Tony so that he could have his happy ending.
“Is it bad to say I like them both?” said Thor. Everyone was silent. “What? I’ve had a lot of time on my hands ok? I
‘Yeah. I’ll call. It’ll be a date,’ said Tony with a smirk.
“Oh come onnnn. I’m gonna put my bet on Doctor Strange anyway.”
“Who’s Levi?” wondered Clint.
“Okay, so two more left. Both Steve and Stephen are very special to me. One is the co-leader of the Avengers while the other protects the world through magic. They could not be anymore different from one another. Steve is an optimist who believes the best in people while Stephen’s snark and wit gives me a run for my money,” said Tony. Both Steve and Stephen nodded with a shrug.
They held each other in their arms, swaying to the rhythm. Steve was still not a good dancer but it was the best dance he ever had.
“Yup,” replied Nat smiling.
‘Tony...’
Tony folded his arms. “Really? That roach better be the size of Tremors for the Avengers to freak out. Anyways since everyone is out, and I suppose nobody wants to go back in. Meeting is postponed till tomorrow.”
Tony never expected for his invention to work. But it did. He could navigate through the Quantum Realm and time travel.
Rogers was wary but he signalled Sam and Scott to stand down. He told them, ‘Go. Rendezvous with the others. I’ll join up later.’
He ripped off his IV and staggered forward to Steve.
Everyone quickly piled out of the room except for the four of them, and Peter.
“I think it could be Steve,” said Bruce who walked in. “I saw him sneaking off in the night. Maybe he didn’t want anyone to know they got back together yet.” He passed another 20 dollar bill to Nat.
, if he ever hurt Tony, I will hunt him through the Nine Realms and feed him to Jormungand itself,” said Loki with a satisfied smile.
“Thank you. I’ll do my best.”
“Boss,” chimed in Friday. “There is a meeting with the Team at two today.”
Peter immediately handed a 10 to Nat. She flatly stared at him. “You’re not old enough to bet kid.”
Steve could not fulfill the vow he took on to protect Tony. He tried. It took everything in him to charge towards Thanos. To get Tony out of the way. He could not make it. Tony took the stones. His last words “I am Iron Man” and snapped all of Thanos’ forces into dust. An eye for an eye. He saw Peter go up to a dying Tony who couldn’t say anything. It shattered Steve’s last resolve. Pepper touched her forehand tenderly towards Tony. “Tony. Look at me. We’re going to be okay. You can rest now.”
‘I’m not here to hurt you,’ said Tony.
“Yea, why not? Maybe after this, he gonna go see
“And I’m a tech genius. In theory, we could’ve been worlds apart but somehow we were brought together,” said Tony. Stephen did not care what anyone thought anymore. Right now all he wanted to do was kiss his boyfriend, Anthony Edward Stark, and he did.
“How we doing, kid?” asked Clint.
“He just turned up on the left. Where is he going?”
Tony found himself back in his study room. The shield sat comfortably on his cupboard.
“It’s not a what but a who,” said Nat smuggly.
“Yea take a couple more spoonfuls of the stuff that you oh so hate,” said Tony.
“Oh...I know that place,” dawning on Bruce.
God, he wished Peter was here to see this. He would have loved Morgan. She too would have adored him. Like a big brother. Working in the garage after school.
“I don’t know about that Bruce. I mean Steve hurt Tony pretty bad the last time. I’m going for the Doc. What about you Sam?” said Rhodey.
“How did that work out for you?”
“Righttt. How does Shawarma sound? Tonight, I know a place. I actually don’t know what it is but I wanna try it.”
to give it up. Tony took a few deep breaths. He decided that getting anywhere away from that red, blue and white of a Frisbee is better, so he wandered aimlessly around the Avengers’ living quarters.
Despite the fact that he hated Cap for not telling him about the nature of his parents’ murder, Tony still let the Star Spangled man break out his team from The Raft because he knew it was the right thing to do. While he still believed signing on the Accords was still the best path, it just wasn’t right to see his team mates,
He should not have kept Bucky's secret from Tony. Bucky was his best friend, and after what they've been through, he wanted to keep it that way. He should have done the right thing but he was selfish and the price was him and Tony.
‘I miss her,’ stated Vision. Tony stopped on his tracks. He couldn’t face Vision. Instead, he replied ‘I know’ and walked out.
The team collectively sighed in relief as Tony walked off. “That was a close call,” said Scott.
into you here. It didn’t occur to me that you
Tony feigned innocence. “That is a very sudden and private question to ask, kid. And what do you mean by ‘we’?”
“Doesn’t mean anything,” scoffed Scott.
When they were alone, Rogers greeted him, ‘Tony.’
Tony nodded. ‘I can’t believe I’m about to say it but – Shoot Me.’ And Steve did. In his Iron Man suit, he could feel bullets impact but he knew the suit could take it. Least this way he could explain to Ross that Steve and his team fought back, got away and still maintain his position as an official Avenger.
you here?” said Sam.
The team just shrugged and mumbled at the same time various reasons for attending. To Tony’s surprise, the meeting went normally. There were no questions on his personal life, everything briefed were strictly business. Off course, that was a different story when the meeting ended.
‘But you do,’ Steve pointed out. ‘That’s why you’re here alone. That’s why you haven’t killed me yet.’
“Ha!” Rhodey responded.
“Good for you, kid,” said Clint.
look to Rogers but Rogers nodded again. ‘Come on, Tic Tac,’ said Sam to Scott, ‘Let’s get outta here.’
Peter looked nervous. “What’s up kid?” asked Tony innocently. The other three stayed in the room with him pretending to be discuss other matters.
“Steve and I, you know our history together, and since the team got back together, we’ve also talked about it at length on what that meant and could mean for the both of us. We’ve moved past what was done and I absolutely trust Steve Rogers with my life. It’s just that...we’ve had our shot...it didn’t work out due to many issues but it comes down to it that we just see things too differently. Him and I, we have opposite views on almost everything, it’s why they say opposites attract. Could we make it work somehow? Perhaps, but it would be difficult. It is who we are at our very core and I don’t want to either of us to change for one another,” said Tony looking at Steve.
“Sure. But after we take down these alien goons first.”
Tony Stark felt everything. He knew he was on the brink of collapse but he had to stay awake. Him and Blue Meanie were saved. One last miracle. He thought he would never see them again. He already lost the kid. Tony wondered if Pepper was...or if
Rhodey nodded. ‘But...you can call him too. I mean it’s kind of obvious that you miss him as well.’
“Wonder who he’s talking to,” said Clint. “He seems to smile a lot while talking.”
‘Right. Well, let me know when you’re done. I wouldn’t mind being your genuine pig,’ said Tony walking out.
Thor immediately edged away from the room. “Nothing. It’s just err...we found err...there was errr…”
Tony shouted ‘SO’
. How’s going into hiding working out for you?’
Steve stayed silent while Rhodey tried to hush Tony to sit back in his wheelchair. Tony had not even realized he had stood up. He barely registered the comment he made to Carol.
“It doesn’t mean anything. It doesn’t mean anything. It doesn’t mean anything,” Scott repeated like a mantra.
“Well...not quite. I mean I am in a relationship with one of them,” said Tony smiling.
He stood up, went to turn on the music record, and extended his hand to Peggy. “But for now, Peggy, would you care to have this dance with me?”
Bucky grinned back. “How can I? You’re taking all the stupid with you.”
“I think this is pretty much a full attendance,” remarked Tony.
“Which is why I warned Tony’s
Peter pondered before discreetly shooting his web at the building. It stuck. “I don’t think is warded against me since I’ve been here so often.”
“We’re betting on who’s Tony’s new boyfriend. You see him over there talking and all smiley? Nat says he has a new boyfriend. I’m betting that he got back together with Steve,” said Clint.
“There’s still snark though -”
Steve smiled again and shook his head before sprinting off to join the rest.
“You did not. You tried. Everyone did. We won and the universe is saved...just that there’s a cost to pay”
Steve felt nostalgic being back at the base after so long, in this timeline no less. Tony went to obtain the Tesseract in the vault while Steve was tasked with getting the Pym Particles. While Hank was distracted, he took enough for both of them to get home.
“I couldn’t stop him.”
Loki smirked and immediately swung opened the door wide with the Avengers all outside the door froze, caught in the act.
Sam shrugged. “It could
“He loves to push my buttons but in a good way because he knows how far to push me to bring out the best in me. I’d do the same to him. That’s how well we understand each other,” said Tony sincerely looking at Stephen. “He’s a wizard -”
“It isn’t.”
“Really? Those guys?” said Scott. “But it’s Captain America.”
“Hello Pot, meet Kettle, Black. Don’t think I didn’t notice you took my sweatpants last week.”
“Not with this location we’re about to turn into,” said Clint, a hint of worry in him.
“I didn’t,” Tony insisted.
“I think Levi spotted me,” he whispered.
There was only once where Steve intervened where an alien assassin was aiming at Tony from behind. Tony did not see it and was helmetless. This reality did not have a Steve Rogers. Tony was the only leader of the Avengers.
“It’s going to be okay, Buck,” he said as he stepped onto the platform.
It was never a question for Steve. “I Do.”
Steve looked back up at Tony. Tony never called him Steve. ‘Yes. I promise you Tony. Bucky is not in a position to harm anyone else,’ said Steve. ‘I’m sorry for what I have done. I should never have kept the truth from you,’ he paused ‘if you want retribution, go ahead. Take me in. Shoot me if you want. But don’t let the rest pay for my mistakes.’ He proceeded to put down the semi-automatic he was holding. It felt weird to Tony not seeing Steve with his shield. It pained him at the same time.
“No do overs.” They failed their shot at getting the Tesseract. Tony said he knew where they could get another shot at the stone and get more Pym Particles. Immediately, he understood what Tony meant. 1970. The old SHIELD base. Scott was not convinced it would work. If it failed, both of them would be stuck in that timeline forever.
“We spy on Tony,” said Nat. “We have three possible candidates, we just need to take turns to covertly observe who is Tony Stark’s new boyfriend.”
, given the same treatment like the scumbag criminals they sworn to protect the people against.
Sam stood and observed while Bucky had a knowing smile. “Sooo...did something go wrong? Or did something go right?”
“Oh, that reminds me…” said Steve as he took out his shield from the wrapper and handed it to Sam. “Try it on.”
A familiar roar of the engine caught Steve's attention.
“177A Bleecker Street,” replied Thor immediately.
Thor gasped “It is You! -” before he got cut off.
“I know,” said Bucky patting Steve’s shoulder. “But maybe you could try to honor Tony’s request of you, the one you told me about? To live your life.”
Months later, General “Hulk-Hater” Ross showed up at the Avengers’ doorstep. Judging from the look on Ross’ face, Tony surmised that it had to do with Rogers.
“Do you trust me?” asked Tony. His eyes looked determined as if he wants to believe.
He started on this path to help people, to protect them, and where he couldn’t do either, he would avenge them. ‘
Steve merely said “Well, that didn’t work out, did it?”
Peggy blinked her tears away. “Yes, Steve. I would love to.”
“They left. Seems to have worked marvelously,” said Stephen smiling at Tony.
“For show,” replied Loki offhandedly. “Though I don’t mind kissing someone as gorgeous as he is, and it was on the cheek, not the lips.”
. He knocked.
Scott?” said Nat.
Tony Stark stared at the blinking light of his telephone for a good five minutes before answering a very pissed off General Ross on the other end. He immediately knew The Raft had been breached. He didn’t need Ross to tell him it was Cap. Rogers. Steve.
“The Ben and Jerry’s ice cream? What is he doing with pizza and ice cream? Another date with Cap?” wondered Scott.
“I hear some more noise, what are they doing now?” asked Bruce.
After Peter left for home, Scott and Clint stayed out longer to monitor any movement. After dark, they too head back when it was clear Tony would not be leaving the Sanctum Sanctorum anytime soon.
Scott decided to chime in. “I think you look great, Cap. As far as I’m concerned, that’s America’s ass.”
Nat took the money. “On who?”
But this is Steve asking. He had not met Steve since five years ago. He had something good going with Pepper and Morgan. They were the love of his life now. This Tony was an idiot. He had so many ups and downs, only nearing death that he realized he truly loved Pepper Potts. There was never any future with Steve. He made that very clear when he chose Bucky over him.
“No. Not really,” said Steve cryptically.
pulled up at his front yard. Pretty soon, he knew why they were here. Time travel. Tony scoffs at the idea.
“I’m going to miss you, Buddy,” said Bucky
Peggy opened the door and stared at him. It was not often that Peggy Carter was speechless. “It’s me,” Steve said. She teared up and hugged him tightly.
Seeing there was nowhere to run, they decided to make their stand against Tony. He landed and opened his visor, seeing them eye to eye.
“Calm down!” said T’Challa.
. They’re wearing each other’s clothes? We’re done for,” groaned Clint.
“The kiss at the ball?” asked Scott
“Okay. Okay. Guys? I’m gonna patch the sound feed live,” whispered Peter.
,” retorted Sam.
He saw the life fade from Tony’s eyes.
“Thank you, Cloak,” said Stephen as the Cloak floated away.
The time heist, it is really happening.
“Yea will now it has kinda evolved into banter. Our shared similar history, our views. You know it took me awhile to get this one to admit his feelings for me, which is why we haven’t exactly shared with the group until now. Stephen was there for me at one of the lowest points in my life and has consistently supported me in every way,” Tony held Stephen’s hand. The Sorcerer Supreme’s hands were shaking but Tony held onto them steadily.
“For those who chose Loki, I’m sorry but the God of Mischief isn’t mine,” said Tony.
“No shit Sherlock,” said Clint.
“What is it Peter?” asked Thor concerned.
“Showering at his place,” Nat sounded impressed.
Peter climbed through a window on the side. That was his usual hidey hole when he snuck up here to spend more time studying magic than Doctor Strange would normally allow.
Tony found Vision in the kitchen. To Tony’s surprise, he saw Vision in the midst of preparing a meal. Vision did not notice Tony’s presence, which was another shocker, as no one could ever get the jump on Vision. The sentient A.I. continued mumbling to himself what sounded like ingredients. Tony continued to stand there and watch. Vision mumbled ‘One pinch of Paprikash,’ as he sprinkled it into the bowl; only Tony saw that Vision’s fingers continued in that sprinkle motion even when all the paprikash fell into the bowl.
“We really shouldn’t be betting on our friends’ love life,” said T’Challa, walking into the room with Peter. Now the whole room was subtly-but-not-subtly observing Tony over the phone. The genius playboy billionaire philanthropist paid them no attention and continued smirking over his call.
“You can’t save everyone. Thor couldn’t and he’s a god. Thanos pretty much thought he was a god and he wasn’t omnipotent. Some day, Steve, you have to find it in yourself to forgive yourself.”
man? You’re not even betting. Why
“Don’t you wanna find out who’s Tony dating?” asked Clint.
He crept up where he could hear laughter and chatter. He hid himself by the stairs, out of Mr. Stark and Doctor Strange’s sight.
“Ahh...I see. Well then, I’ll put my 20 bucks on Steve Rogers as well. Who could resist those blue eyes and that ass,” said Scott sighing.
Life with Tony was always going to be a roller coaster but they eventually got married in front of their family, the Avengers and pretty much adopted Peter as their son. As the years went, they both grew older and handed the reins to the next generation of Avengers.
“Thief,” said Stephen.
‘Well, as much as I’m tempted to join your underground rave band, someone has to stay behind to keep an eye on Ross and to be the official face of the Avengers. Can’t exactly tell him that I let you guys go now, can I? Okay, come on, let’s make it real.’
T’Challa shook his head. “I would not participate in this bet.” The others stared at him. “But I would watch and observe how this plays out,” he added with a grin.
Despite the public display of affection, the Avengers were happy for Tony who finally found love in his life. After all that he had sacrificed for the universe, it’s the least the universe could do. That, and the rolls of cash that was discreetly going through an exchange in hands to those who had won the bet.
I play this new game everyone has been on about - Fortnite.”
“Why? What’s there?” asked Rhodey over the comms.
Tony continued to stare at the news screen. There was so much on his mind now. Thor came back momentarily to warn them of the impending arrival of Thanos, the supposed force behind the manipulation of the Infinity Stones. He had seen the destruction from just one stone. He didn’t want to think what six of them would do.
Since then, Steve officially joined the Avengers as Captain America. He quickly rose up the ranks and eventually co-lead the Avengers alongside Tony. He even received a new Captain America shield built by Tony from Wakandan vibranium courtesy of T’Challa. From a personal aspect, Steve spent some of his best days with Tony. He was mindful to be always honest with Tony, no matter what. In turn, while certain turn of events had taken a toll on their relationship, he always had Tony’s trust.
“By the twist of fate, Loki and I have shockingly become good friends. He, a Prince, and I, Playboy Billionaire, have bonded through lost, betrayal and what not. We’re divas who know morally grey decisions very well and he is one of the rare few I’m comfortable talking about it. We have chemistry but ultimately because we tend to be self destructive, we’re bad for one another,” explained Tony.
Natasha leaned into Clint and whispered. “It’s not just you. He’s been doing that a lot recently.”
“Yea and I was all about ‘We don’t trade lives’. Look at Nat, and Tony. I was supposed to protect him, I couldn’t give him the happiness he deserved but at least he would be alive, living with Pepper, seeing Morgan grow up. What is even the
The news showing on tv reported Steve’s sighting with the others taking down the a bunch of enhanced villains with snake DNA who called themselves the Serpent Society. Everyone escaped unscathed from their last encounter. Tony and Vision never talked about it but he had a suspicion Wanda had a role in convincing Vision to let them go. While still suspicious of Tony, Ross continued to chase Steve’s team but they had no chance of successfully bringing down any of them.
"Dad I know you don't have to keep reminding me of it. I still have the marks from it."
Flash over hearing from the table over groaned "oh come on Parker! We all know you have no family left! Hell I bet your aunt just committed suicide to just get away from you."
"Don't worry I will Clint."
When the bell rang everyone dashed out Peter stayed behind. Walking up to the teacher's desk "excuse me miss but how come I didn't get one?"
“Please darling I’m ready for you.”
“Tony, I know you very well, and I’ve known Steve since the day he woke up. You argue, yes. But hate? No.”
“Tired?”
“You suck,” Tony groaned, running his hands over Steve’s chest.
“Jesus christ Stark,” he felt himself bucking his hips involuntarily. Tony continued bobbing his head up and down as he swirled his tongue around the head and sucking softly. After what could've been 5 minutes or 5 hours, he really didn't know, he carefully pulled Tony’s head up until his cock popped out of his mouth.
“Why?”
“Shit,” he choked out, forcing his hips down to stay on the bed.
“I’m sorry I don’t hate you, I swear. I don’t… I mean maybe I’m just… shit I don’t know how to say this kind of stuff,” he cried shaking his head. Steve sat next to him on the bed and hunched over with his elbows on his knees.
“You're not the director of me.”
“You? You are gonna listen to things I say?” he laughed leaning his forehead against Tony’s.
“Yeah, I'll give her a kick.” As he turned to leave he looked back to his pile of chopped wood. “Don't take from my pile.” He left quickly before he could see the angry reaction from the Captain. When he got to the barn it was none other than Fury lying in wait. Fury lectured him like he normally did when they got together, but he felt like he was still being attacked from all sides.
“What does that mean?”
“Fuck Stevie.” ‘Mhm’ he answered, moving his tongue in slow circles. He carefully spit into his hand and slipped a finger past the taught muscle while Tony squirmed beneath him. He pushed his tongue in even further as he hooked his finger and pressed against the sweet spot that earned him a deep guttural moan from the engineer. He worked a second finger in and began scissoring slowly.
“Mentioned what?” he said, quivering.
“Tony c’mon,” he protested grabbing what he thought were his own sweatpants from the end of the bed. “Uh Tony?”
“You don’t see it but I am telling you, something- no, someone will go down tonight,” she chuckled.
“There isn’t one, I just want you to know that we all trust you with our lives. We have so much respect for what you do and I want to get you to believe me. I’ll tell you everyday if I have to,” he promised. Tony stared at him like he was crazy but ultimately laughed lightly and pressed his forehead into his chest while embracing Steve in a crushing hug.
“Wait, I want to be serious for a second,” he muttered leaning back while Tony was nibbling on his bottom lip. “Tony, seriously.”
“Okay well Steve you can stay with, uhm. Well your options are stay in a room with Stark, or sleep on the jet,” Clint looked at him apologetically.
“ - Steve so help me god I will bite you if you don’t start fucking my throat.”
“Nothing,” he murmured.
“Good lord Steve,” Tony muttered pulling away, “use me, don't hold yourself back,” he growled, clicking his tongue.
“Oh fuck,” he moaned reaching down to tangle his fingers in soft brown hair. Tony steadied himself before sinking down over his cock until his nose was brushing his stomach.
“Mhm you wanna cum inside me baby?” He intended to answer, ‘yes’, but it came out as a loud cry as he spilled himself into Tony. Tony twisted himself like an acrobat to bite down on his shoulder and suck roughly. He felt his vision whiting out while he came down from his high panting heavily. He moved to pull himself away but Tony pulled his hands around his waist with a sigh.
“You won’t hurt me Steve,” Tony sat up and arched backwards with an incredible flexibility and kissed him passionately. “I meant it when I said I trust you.”
“How can I be quiet when you're shoving your incredible cock in my ass,” Tony replied through heavy breaths. Steve groaned in response as he sunk fully into the tight heat of the genius.
“I cannot believe that you are trying to give me relationship advice right now.”
“Cap, you don’t have to return any favors,” Tony laughed. “Are you sure that you’re okay?” he added, turning over towards Steve.
“You will either fuck or fight,” Clint grinned. “Nat and I have a bet about it.”
“Seems like you walked away all right.”
“As an adult, do you consent to this?” Nod.
“Do what?” “You always downplay yourself, compare yourself to the rest of the team.”
“I’m nothing special, Capsicle. Not next to you,” Tony muttered turning back towards the bathroom to grab a washcloth.
“Who’s on what side?” he chuckled, shaking his head. “Oh no Cap, I’m not ruining my chances. Tomorrow morning I’ll tell ya who won,” he said with an evil smirk. “You're in the first room to your right, up the stairs. Good luck on your mission Captain Rogers.”
“Do you want to fuck me? Or I can suck you off, or give you a handjob, or we can just lay here together. Just show or tell Capsicle, I want whatever you give me,” Tony insinuated running his hand down his side.
“What?”
“But Tony, we are a team.”
“I win.”
“What, why?”
“Right,” he flinched. Tony was suddenly right there leaning over him and pushing his hands away from his face. He then gave him a devilish grin before he swung his leg over Steve’s torso and he sat on his knees over him.
“Alright alright,” he said, shaking his head. Tony slowly dipped back down while keeping his eyes trained on Steve. He grabbed his hair and swiftly pushed him down with a groan. “Fuck Tony,” he grunted snapping his hips up. Tony moaned loudly, sending vibrations up his body that encouraged him to continue shoving his head up and down brutally. He barely registered that nimble fingers were reaching down to squeeze his balls and press up against the sensitive skin behind them. He could already feel his orgasm turning in his stomach and he curled his fingers even more tightly in Tony’s hair.
"Don't worry everyone it's alright that's Mr. Stark's AI Friday, she's the security for the entire tower. Now with the ID settled let's continue shall we."
Everyone the starts to scan their IDs passing threw Still in awe of what happened with Peter. When it was Flash's turn he gave a look to Peter that he was going to get it later and Miss Erica gave a dirty look to him going to the elevator.
Steve groans "alright I can't keep you from your education buddy."
He bends down to them "Hey Morgan, hi Makayla."
Yeah just read the summary and you'll know why I'm doing this.
With that everyone went off to look at the different scientists through the class working on their projects. While Peter hears crying with his super hearing following it to find Makayla crying while Morgan is holding her hand comforting her.
Shadow groans "
"Nope."
The elevator door opened as Shuri walked out of it. She wanted to surprise her 'fiancé' coming with her brother and his wife, "oh my dear fiance~" she looked around not seeing Peter anywhere. She frowned now she wouldn't be able to tease him.
Flash gives a smirk think Natasha was insulting Peter in Russian "Hey Penis! Looks like even the black Widow is calling you out!"
Back with Peter and his class they made it to the middle lab section where the scientists work on cures for the world like how to turn dirty water to clean, global warming, food shortages everything like that.
Peter smiles putting his phone away though he knew his dads wouldn't like it if they knew Wade was coming. What would be the fun in telling them any away? he shrugs 'oh well' he thinks this can just be a little secret for now.
baby boy: I'd liked that a lot honey, because I can't go on a field trip today at school. Having a visit from you would be amazing!
Olivia clears her throat "alright everyone I think we should continue on with the tour now." She starts to move them along while a few other students had to push Miss Erica along as she was still stunned from getting threatened by Natasha.
"What did you say?"
"Because of too many absences with my internship. They don't believe it's real."
A tap was made of Flash's shoulder "What's wrong with a girl having a internship flash? Any girl here I'm sure is smarter than you , and I don't think your eye sight is working because Peter's a boy so leave him alone before this girl kicks your butt." MJ points to herself
