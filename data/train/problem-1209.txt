Blushing furiously Sherlock babbles, "Huddersperhapsyoucouldstayfor..."
"Horsewoman then, how do you figure that?"
Suppressing a chuckle, she smoothed his dark curls and made a great show of straightening his clothes. "As I see young man. Well then, Master John, what say you to this?"
30th October 11 pm-
John grinned, "That and the majority enthusiastically ship us."
Well before first light John heard stirring downstairs. He put on jeans and a T-shirt and confronted Colsan in the sitting room.
"You can't possibly. Those pills weren't retrieved and there would be no way to tell even if they were."
Pivoting in his chair, Sherlock saw the stocking was bulging with a bundle of switches tied with a black ribbon. "What the hell is this?"
"28th August, Race Your Mouse Day. This rather confused me, is there some double entendre associated with mouse?"
"Seriously, John, are we barbarians? Fish is a given with chips. On to 20th August, Radio Day."
"Goodly witch as is my task, I MUST show you what you ask. But though I know that this will vex, I simply CANNOT watch more sex! Tongues and teeth and bare arsed skin, truly Mistress I'm done in. For here I hang alone and sad mourning what I might have had. My heart fair broke, my soul so bent for want of love and sentiment."
"Calm down, Hyacinth Bucket, no need for histrionics. I do dare, I can prove it and I don't have to try because that file I brought home is the solution. Now if you're interested, sit back down and I'll tell you or you can storm off and never know what missing detail I've uncovered."
Martha nodded her approval as they moved into each other's arms and embraced. "'Tis true", she whispered, "love will thaw a frozen heart."
Thus it was that daily Martha observed her charges. There were experiments, music and the occasional row, but she was pleased to see her Sherlock flourish under the care of his John, even eating. She would allow it to continue, for now.
"Nor am I, but we have most certainly suffered a considerable amount of lost time. I would suspect a gas of some sort but, again, we are exhibiting none of the typical aftereffects. I'm at a loss to explain..."
"Sound advice dear, and I'm going to cut back on my 'herbs'. Not a fan of repeating the experience of feeling as if someone walked over my grave."
There were a good many more gifts under the tree which languished unopened until well after the moon had crested on the new fallen snow. William Sherlock Scott Holmes and John Hamish Watson were otherwise engaged through the long winters night.
"What a thrilling prospect, I can feel my arteries hardening as we speak. My enthusiasm is not dampened however because 21st August is Honey Bee Awareness Day. I don't imagine you would entertain the idea of filling the flat with bees but I'm hoping you will be amenable to a drive in the country to inspect some hives."
"And have Martha make ME clean it up? Not likely. Just open it."
"No. When informed of my devotion to you, he agreed to stay here. He admires me greatly, finding my deductions and music amazing. I am taken with him as well."
19th October-
Staggering slightly with holiday "spirit", Sherlock settled Billy in pride of place on the mantle and John plopped the Santa Hat back on the bony head. Sherlock opened his mouth to protest. "Not one word", John wheezed good naturedly, "he's Billy. He wears the damn hat!"
"Now that's more promising I have to admit."
"I think I have an idea. She has some photos of us but nothing actually personal."
"Nope, I have plans for this brogue." John caressed the shoe which definitely got Sherlock's attention.
"Haven't a clue. I didn't move him and no one's been here except..."
When the elf failed to appear for a second day, Sherlock was more disheartened than peevish. "John, am I to truly believe that William's feelings were hurt?"
"Greg!", they both wheeze at the twinkle in her eyes.
"19th August, Potato Day. Chips for everyone."
"Christ on a crutch, the daylight is too damned bright.", the silver and gold dildo rasped.
"Oh you'll know, Martha", John smirked.
With Sherlock gone, John finally looked, really looked, at Colsan Wesix. He appeared to be younger than Sherlock but that was difficult to judge, 3 perhaps 4 centimeters taller, and around a stone heavier with what seemed to be an overly fit physique disguised by an outrageously expensive suit. The whole package was topped off by flaming red hair, shorter than Sherlocks but with more posh product. Most striking/alarming though were his eyes, an impossible shade of black, that were boring into John who wondered if there were two holes being burned into the wall behind him.
"So she wanted to what...meet me, date me?", he shuddered.
"It's not a murder you cock but it is combustible and a bit explosive."
"John, this is Colsan Wesix. Cols, my colleague, John Watson."
"Not yet", Sherlock grumbles under his breath.
"And it will probably be ME hoovering them up even then. Don't give me that look boys. I fully intend to live longer than the Queen Mother did. That gives me a good thirty years yet so you had better keep that in mind."
John nodded. Rationally he knew that an abundance of melanin could give someone overly dark eyes but no one had totally black eyes. Except this guy certainly appeared to, his eyes so pitch black that at first glance John felt like he was staring into oblivion. "Looks at you like he's homicidal. And that name, who has a name like that?"
"Oi!"
"I suspect I'm going to enjoy giving WHATEVER this is that chance you're talking about. Naturally I'll be needing to take copious notes and compile some experiments."
John looked up shocked to find Martha's face flushed, her eyes flashing. It was clear to her that last remark had hurt. "Oh goodness, I'm so sorry, dear. That was...I think I'm the one needing a drink now."
Moving in a flash, Sherlock was immediately peeved that John apparently intended to put his shoe back on. "Why are you doing that? I thought the objective of this exercise was to remove clothing not replace it."
"Another fortuitous pause in the action, detective. I'm exhausted and the month's only half through."
He returned wrapped in his favorite dressing gown, toweling the last droplets of water from his not so military haircut. It took a bit of getting used to the longer style, but Sherlock's lustful reaction to that "stunning swoop of silver" made him decide it wasn't so bad a change.
"Here's tea and scones with a big cake waiting for later when Mycroft and Garibaldi arrive."
Suddenly John could see and feel Sherlock shaking and pulled the throw from the back of the sofa placing it around them.
John folded back the duvet as he climbed in the bed and took Sherlock in his arms. "I can do that for you my darling. I WILL be the first MAN to make love to you. Rest now and we'll get you into a warm bath later. Best thing next to cuddling."
"Sit down John", Mike urged, "and let me tell you what you need to defeat Wesix."
"You can't talk."
"To be honest, it was unbearably crowded but everyone was trying to make the best of a bad situation, being polite and maintaining proper social distancing. Then a group of a half dozen or so rowdies, late teens early twenties- harder to judge these days, who had come to purchase liquor and cigarettes became more than impatient and began to cause a scene. They jumped up on counters, displays and even one checkout station and began railing about how all the old bastards and bitches were holding up the queues and wasting the time of anyone young enough who would actually survive Covid-19."
"Poor man needed someone who'd listen to him."
Reclined like an artist's model atop Sherlock's chair on the seat of which was a wooden plaque engraved "Do Not Disturb. In My Mind Palace".
"Happy to hear it love, but you DO know she has one in poster size in her flat."
Now the table was set and she and John hoped for the best. To their relief and delight Sherlock appeared in his usual bespoke suit and a vermilion shirt that definitely "did things" for John.
"And me.", the lino floor warbled. "It happens so often that I'm warped, and listen to my voice. It's cracking just like my finish."
"Since you're the one with all the answers it should be obvious. Did you get the right pill?"
"Oh my God. Fuck me! FUCK ME NOW!! I need something to knock that mental picture out of my Mind Palace!"
"I know which is why we're going to The Yard and inflicting my comedic talents on Donovan and Anderson."
Now let it be known that the good witch was most prudent in the use of her spells so as not to draw undue attention, but here needs must. In a flash she materialized at the base of the tower. "Sherlock, Sherlock, let down your scarf", she cried. ~ Before you inquire, she felt that suddenly appearing in the room might prove inadvisable. This was a most astute assumption as Sherlock and Doctor Watson had just settled quite comfortably in bed both naked as if fresh from the womb.~
"I'm sure. The logistics are already in place as he has made similar arrangements for his own erotic rendezvous."
Moved beyond measure, the owl brushed the face in the glass with his feathers as if wiping away tears in sympathy and affection.
"Didn't know I needed to tell you what month it is, and any more lip and you're going to be in trouble. Now what the HELL do you want?!"
"Gave her name as a Ms. Truelove, nothing more. The rest I deduced. Perfect grammar, authority figure, numerous telltale red ink marks on the fingers of her dominant hand obviously from grading end of term papers. Therefore, a teacher beyond a doubt."
"It's impossible."
"In light of that threat, it's also Toasted Marshmallow Day. Is that a safer bet?"
Pulling John down beside him onto the bed Sherlock sighed, "Me too. It's always been you John and I want you if you'll have me. You know my history of trading certain sex acts for drugs when I was younger."
"I'm here 'Lock, right here with you."
🔨💀🔨💀🔨💀🔨💀🔨💀🔨💀🔨💀🔨💀🔨💀🔨💀🔨💀🔨💀🔨💀
"By far, and more palatable. Shall we have a drumroll for the final day?"
"That was only once", he snorted, "and we both know who's the only REAL Captain here." This last was emphasized by grinding down on John's suddenly interested nether regions.
"Who? What's got your knickers in such a twist?"
John chose that opportunity taking advantage of Sherlock's open mouth and kissed him with vigor AND tongue.
"Really what?"
"It's wonderful John", Martha gushed, "but the two gold teeth... are those fangs?"
Pulling his hair in frustration Sherlock moaned, "Elves, magic, good behavior? Good God it will be years before Christmas comes."
"John you're being unnecessarily obtuse. Look at it this way, when you were busy being born millions of people around the world were graduating university, working, retiring and most certainly dying."
Sherlock then chimed in, "And Greg...Greg?! I called him Greg, too much wine! At any rate, he'll be Commissioner of New Scotland Yard with a flying car and Mycie will have a giant drone umbrella so he can soar all over the United Kingdom without getting his cake wet."
Greg ejected the DVD and wheezed, " What the motherfucking shite was THAT?!"
Back upstairs the rewards were unwrapped. There was a thick packet of cold case files from Greg and a half dozen of Sherlock's favourite croissants from Mycroft's preferred bakery. Smiling in spite of himself Sherlock shyly said, "It appears my apology worked."
We were smitten beyond all reason
"Mate, we're not doubting you", Greg said earnestly.
🐸👑🐸👑🐸👑🐸👑🐸👑🐸👑🐸👑🐸👑🐸👑🐸👑🐸👑🐸👑🐸👑
She sat up straight, resolute but not insulted. "Thank you dear, but I was married to a very bad man, and have taken men, women and, at times, those who are proudly non-binary as lovers. I've seen and done most anything you can imagine, so I am quite prepared to endure whatever needs must for the good of my boy."
"And tons of tasty leftovers right Sherlock?"
"Tons, and now you'll be spending hours googling yourself. Charming. At any rate, she is quite generous to other writers, gifting stories and even sending presents all the while posting several stories almost every day on AO3."
John pushes Sherlock flat on his back and mimics drawing a saber. "Batten down the hatches me hearty and prepare to be boarded. There's about to be a fire in the hole. Yo ho here comes my dick in your bum!"
The truth was never going to be an option and John steeled himself to invent a believable explanation. "You, ah, had quite a bout with gastrointestinal distress."
"I'd not say no...could be interesting."
"God help me."
"Wednesday will work because Wesix will be spending the night on his usual Friday and Saturday. I just need to get Sherlock out of our flat."
John didn't need further urging and in short order he was on his knees with Sherlock's legs on his shoulders as he did his very blogger best to accommodate the request. The position put both of their magnificent arses spectacularly on display.
"I can try."
Reluctantly with cheeks blushing pink, Sherlock handed over the note and John began to read to himself. "Dear William, please accept my sincerest apology for breaking the rules and disrupting your magic. I confess my transgression was brought on by a fit of pique caused by my inability to quickly decipher John's new password which, ironically, proved to be 'Don't Touch the Elf'. I hope to see your return to good health as I have found our interactions enjoy...ah, not boring. Sincerely, S.H."
"Not this exact conversation."
When Sherlock left at dawn the next morning to avoid John's undoubtably pathetic effort to "unbore" the Christmas Frankenstein there was no sign of the offensive object in the flat. When he returned however the elf was back with a vengeance.
"Oh?! Honestly, John, ARRRGGGGHHHHH you paying attention? Pirate Month means we can pillage and plunder to our hearts content."
Loud squeals from the children announced the start of a game where apples hung from strings tied to a makeshift scaffolding were to be "captured" using only mouths, no hands. The clamor grew louder as the parents cheered and the kiddies laughed as their "prizes" eluded them.
The second text was more to the point and as ominous as the Ghost of Christmas to Come:
"And so the two were joined, and they lived happily ever after." - ChrisCalledMeSweetie.
"Contrary to your opinion, I DO see things. When we were in the museum for the Blind Banker case I saw some examples. And I DID do more in Chinatown than eat dumplings and yell through a letter box like a madman."
"Not here, brat, but when we get home I promise to light your fire."
"We shall see. I will tolerate your presence to begin, but I will be watching you. Fail Sherlock at your peril."
John sighed heavily and counted to ten. "You know you do that out loud?" That was as close as Sherlock would get to a mea culpa, and John noted they both had a smile tugging at the corners of their mouths.
"Charming, but let's take first things first. How about we get these August Occasions underway? If I remember correctly it's Grab Some Nuts Day in this International Pirate Month."
"Very responsible of you. So, 12th August?"
"No, it's the file that you put down on the table when you gave me the iodine."
Long will we Johnlockers come
Putting a finger in the air in way of a pronouncement Sherlock quipped, "We shall install a lift so as not to deprive you of the pleasures of hoovering AND bringing us tea every day."
Draped in an obscenely expensive 1,000 thread count sheet, Sherlock staggered from the bedroom towards his chair. Stopping abruptly he executed a perfect pirouette and stared. "John, WHAT is that abomination?"
"One does not...who IS he, the damn King?"
"Capital! 22nd August is Be An Angel Day but I don't believe either of us is capable of that. Therefore we are left with Tooth Fairy Day."
"What's that, beautiful?"
"John dear, I know Sherlock dating has been hard on you but..."
"Thanks for the hospitality. See you next Christmas. Love, William."
"Well, she WAS in on what I was doing, even stitched our names on the stockings, but I hope not. The idea that she would take charge of it is terrifying."
By the time Guy was cinders the haunting scream had ceased. "Brilliant John, you have surpassed yourself. The explosion was impressive and how fortuitous that someone here engineered a 'Gates of Hades' sound to coincide with the fall of the dummy."
"Above her bed."
It's a perfect day in London, not too warm or damp with banks of bright billowing clouds promising only fair weather. The lone dark storm cloud is hovering indoors in the flat at 221B Baker Street.
"Starting to regret that already."
"Poster size? Why haven't I seen it? Where..."
"Seems this fan, great username by the way, a French thingy which should interest you..."
The next day a new resident was perched on the sitting room mantle.
Maneuvering her way through the litter on the carpet she placed a tray groaning with baked goods on the coffee table. "At my time of life, cheeky boy, I'll take whatever I can get. Besides, even with my hip, in a small space like this I just might be able to catch you John."
"Hudders."
"You never cease to surprise, Captain. 24th August, Vesuvius Day. Do I need to elaborate?"
The ensuing days were hell. No matter what John or Martha did Sherlock was inconsolable. John knew Sherlock's attachment to the skull and what it represented was deeply ingrained in his Mind Palace. Billy had seen Sherlock through despair, addiction, recovery, reinvention and finally to what passed as contentment. Losing Billy was like losing a part of himself and John was having nothing of it.
"You and every other solid surface in the flat.", creaked the sitting room door.
"Bravo to Big Brother. A fornacation picnic it is then. We're going to have quite an august August. What about cases?"
"Best let me see it first, we don't want you to have to do it again. Then we burn it in the fireplace. The smoke and ashes will carry to the North Pole and hopefully all will be forgiven."
"It's triple wrapped. Don't be so squeamish."
"No!", he snapped with a pouty face.
"Stupid?! Who is she, what did she want?"
"Need a photographer do you now? I'm game if you are."
"I'm all abuzz." Sherlock's jaw cracked in a dismissive yawn.
🍺🐝🥃😵🍺🐝🥃😵
"Shut up! YOU ever have to keep dead body parts in your bowels?", chattered the icebox throwing open its door to reveal a torso and the stench of spoiled milk. "And could Sherlock give me FRESH milk just once?!"
"Good Lord, John. You're not dying - it's only a birthday!"
Stunned, he barely avoided staggering on the high heels and looked down at John who was knelt in front of him. "What's going on? What's happening?"
"I realize how this sounds."
John snorted, "In the habit of inspecting teacher's thighs are you?"
16th October -
"I'm glad, although I reckon we'll eventually find the originals here years from now under some piece of furniture we hadn't been arsed to care to move in decades."
Giggling, John kissed him again. "I'll explain it later and we can have some show and tell."
"Well firstly, you might discover this plaything to be the source of some rewards for you IF you're a good boy, and second, surely the world's only consulting detective can deduce a name for a wee elf."
John explained the situation quickly. "So I thought this notjustmom might appreciate a candid snap of us but..."
"Must you always be so obstinate? Would it kill you to cooperate for once?"
❄️❤️❄️❤️❄️❤️❄️❤️❄️❤️❄️❤️❄️❤️❄️❤️❄️❤️❄️❤️❄️❤️❄️❤️❄️❤️
"No, let me finish. I did many things but never penetrative sex. I want that with you John. I want you to be the first man to make love to me."
"AND have unspeakable sex acts performed between our arms?!"
Nothing odd about John being at the kitchen counter preparing to plug in the kettle, quite commonplace actually. What WAS odd was John reaching back to wipe droplets of water off the back of his neck and realizing he'd evidently just come from a shower - one he had no memory of having taken. As it happens that was far from the most curious thing that morning.
"Not that I'm complaining about the peace and quiet", the skull interjected, "but I DO wish the Strad was here to provide some soothing music and not off to Majorca with those PEOPLE. Nevertheless we should be glad of this opportunity to vent our frustrations excepting, of course, those in 221A where apparently everyone is always happy as Hudders. Whatever that means."
Deadly silence filled the air and for a second Sherlock seemed to stop breathing. "Well, I don't...that's not...what does it matter?"
"Happy New Year Sherlock. Can I kiss you?"
"Unnecessary. Yesterday, 2nd Aug, was Ice Cream Sandwich Day. I recommend substituting the Moose Tracks we currently have in the freezer."
Sherlock sniffed dismissively, "Given the unlikely prospect of your succeeding, I agree."
"13th August is an abundance of riches. Friday the 13th AND Left Hander's Day. You may formulate the plans for us."
"I think we can manage that together, John."
"AND the curiosity. You realize she's going to want all the details about these last few weeks."
Colsan threw a smug smirk in his direction and Sherlock, devoid of embarrassment, blurted out "Come along John, make up your mind. Go away, pull up a chair or join in. No wait, delete that last 'Mister I'm not gay'." Lewd laughter ringing in his ears John bolted up to his room.
🐍🕷🐍🕷🐍🕷🐍🕷
"Nothing I consider unique. Overly sweet or vaguely disturbing, but not unique."
Dressing gown flying behind him and curls bouncing, Sherlock raced to the desk, grabbed pen and paper and began to write. A half hour later, "It's finished, John. Now what do I do?"
"Easy for you to say to them.", the bedside table scolded. "You're not the one always shut away in a closed drawer. And the rare times their vibrators go off by accident in me- well let's just say none of us are thrilled. Makes my wood grain splinter and gives them raging headaches."
By then Hudders was merrily making her way down the stairs scampering at a rate that was remarkable for a woman of a certain age with a 'hip'. Fortified by her herbal soother, she was safely ensconced behind a double locked door before two voices rose as one in horrified indignation.
To tell of gay Sherlock and bi John
Under his breath, John grumbled, "Oh where is it going then, have another appointment does it?"
Feigning shock and surprise John turned to the mantle, "Oh dear me, look at your stocking!"
Being a good witch of great virtue, Martha Hudson relied not only on her powers and wiles but also the assistance of her 'magical familiars' in her continued quest to protect her foster son Sherlock. Thus it was that one such minion swooped down from a cloudless sky one day bearing a message.
"Come in, please. It's only my flatmate, no problem."
"You could...what - did - you - say?"
Obviously unimpressed Sherlock points a long accusing finger. "It's August! Did you know it's August?"
"Good mother, please don't trouble yourself. This is John, a soldier and Doctor and a man of great honour. He sought only to rescue me thinking the tower was my prison."
"What are you suggesting Doctor?"
"We don't need a poisonous plant in order to snog and a theme? Honestly! You know I would choose blood samples or severed body parts which you would immediately reject."
"Strangely, you."
"What do you need dears?"
John dragged up the stairs, his anger dissolved into exhaustion. "Before you start, I don't want to argue and say something I can't take back."
At that moment a loud yawn erupted from the master bedroom eliciting a collective moan.
John's blood ran cold. Now he knew he HAD seen something and he had to backtrack fast. "Yeah, that's all Sherlock and now that I think of it I WAS seeing more than one Hudders so who knows what else. Sorry you two for the interruption."
"Looks to me as if Krampus came in the night to scold you for being naughty and, before you ask, if you don't know about Krampus, Google him. Were I you Sherlock I'd get right on that apology, unless you'd rather we put the switches to good use."
"I deduce that we can still have quite a satisfying sex holiday here at Baker Street. Look, even our 'special drawer' is open to welcome us home.", Sherlock grinned.
"Thinking of Sherlock? It was impossible not to overhear your little domestic earlier."
"Inexplicably she was fixated on your blog and thus, by association, you."
Seated in the violin case propped next to the small unmistakable wooden treasure chest that held D'Addario Kaplan Premium Dark Rosin which Sherlock knew cost at least £75.
Greg placed a consoling hand on Mycroft's arm and squeezed as the scene became viscous with Sherlock being impaled with little preparation or care. Suddenly Martha shrieked!
Mycroft scanned John's face giving nothing away. "As Gregory says, John, we are NOT questioning your sincerity."
Now it has been ten years or more
"Plan", Sherlock squeaked, "what plan?"
DAYS LATER-
"Like you've got the market cornered on aggro.", shouted the kitchen table. "I've been set on fire, burned with acid and chemicals AND JESUS- did no one EVER tell them I was meant to be eaten off of not fucked on?!"
John doesn't miss the pleading expression in those entrancing eyes. "If you've been a good lad otherwise, we can look into it."
On one particular evening, she again summoned the mirror. "Mirror, mirror, oh so bright take me flying in the night. Show me my boys high above in their bed and so in love."
"So...I take it he's no longer boring, and by the way his name is Barnacle William."
🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼
So it was that Sherlock and John began to make a life together. Never far from John's mind however was the witch's admonishment, "I WILL be watching you". Little did he know.
It had been an easy Friday at the clinic and John thought to surprise Sherlock by cooking the "thing with the peas". Standing at the hob he had been startled to hear Sherlock laughing, and from the sound of it he wasn't alone. Two sets of footfalls on the stairs was followed by :
"You mean raping!"
"Hang on!" John's forehead crinkled in deep concentration which Sherlock found adorable but would NEVER divulge. "Ah, here's something. A fan wanting ideas for a friend's birthday."
We'll take our leave and go.
"I know you like to spoil him, Martha, but honestly the way he 'finds' things in your flat and appropriates them is really not on. Jesus, I'd need to buy you several chickens and a cow to replace everything but then he'd probably try to use them in an experiment."
John had finally lost his temper this morning berating his stroppy flatmate for being too persnickety about what cases to take on. "You should just take the next client to come along even if it's a lost hamster!" Fuming, John had stormed out the door mask in place, to accompany Martha to the shops whether she wanted company or not.
🎁💀🎁💀🎁💀🎁💀🎁💀🎁💀🎁💀🎁💀🎁💀🎁💀🎁💀🎁💀🎁💀
"That's too risky. Sherlock is mentally out of it but Wesix isn't."
"Goody, I love surprises!", Martha squeaked clapping her hands.
"Don't get stroppy. Can't have you casting a pall over the magic spell."
"Movies : The Zodiac Killer, Clockwork Orange, Dirty Harry, The French Connection, and the ever popular Duck You Sucker. Just the ticket for those who crave crime and murder. Then there's Cold Turkey, even then you were destined to nag me about smoking, The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight, and lastly Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Absolutely a reflection of our home life, filled with useless criminals and the sweetness that is you."
"America's Florida?"
For seasons four and specials two
This chapter discusses Holmes' drug use, and contains descriptions of addiction, the consequences of taking drugs, the effect of drug use on relationships and other drug related issues. If this is triggering for you, please be safe.
The Yarders and Mycroft all sigh as they confirm that Sherlock wasn’t just going to let Neilson get arrested without getting revenge first.
"So you did listen to my warning, for a bit anyway," Donovan murmed thoughtfully. Though suprisingly no one heard her.
Everyone, besides the man in question, frowned, completely disturbed by how obsessed he was.
“To use all his senses,” John answered unhelpfully.
A few people cringe, both at his high voice and his words.
“Who has a sock index?” Kitty questioned in shock. Echoing what a few people were thinking.
A few people jumped at the sudden light, worry filling the room even more.
Though instead of any words, the next case started.
John’s eyes narrow, almost to slits as he glares at Sherlock. An angry and sickening feeling welling up inside of him.
"Why are you going to Baskerville?" Anderson questioned. "Or better yet, how do you plan on getting into it?"
"Did you really think that he was a delivery guy? He has no food with him," Lestrade asked, amusement dancing in his eyes.
"Poor John, you must have been so confused," Molly coed, and John chuckle, noding slightly.
"This mysterious thing, teleported us, it is only natural it should be able to teleport us back, a better question would have been if we would remember what happened here?" Mycroft retorted, causing Anderson to glare at him.
"Yeah," John answered her.
--3rd P.O.V.--
Anyone who had stopped laughing, started again at Sherlock’s words. Even if they knew what Sherlock meant, they still found it hilarious.
--3rd P.O.V.--
--3rd P.O.V.--
“That’s one way to call it,” Lestrade laughs, shaking his head in amusement.
"Probably something to do with the painting," Anderson deducts and everyone rolls their eyes at him because, duh.
“That’s Irene, isn’t it?” Donovan questioned.
"Well, not everyone would own a London A-Z espically if their local," Donovan pointed out.
Even those who know Sherlock's random habits, couldn't help but be shocked about bloody appearance. Though Kitty was the only one who scrunched her face up in disgust. The others shook their heads at him, with even Donovan showing barely any disgust.
"Why does the freak care what John would think?" The Sargent asks.
"John, hurry up," Molly and like half of the people watching muttered, trying to urge the docter to run faster.
“Why are you surprised that she flirted with him?” Mrs Hudson questions. “She literally made it so a moan sound every time she texted him,” She added with a light hint of disgust at that rude noise.
Laughter filled the room at Sherlock’s dramatic words, while Mrs Hudson grins proudly at Sherlock’s words.
"You know he did change after you came into his life," Mycroft piped up suddenly, John frowns over at the older Holmes brother in confusion. "Believe or not, but my brother became kinder, more human after meeting you," There was a hint of graditude in his voice that had John smiling slightly.
"Don't you work with Sherlock?" Kitty questioned, "you're solving cases with the Police often enough, isn't that a job?"
"Not long enough," Mycroft whispered sadly.
"Why would he waste so much time researching and setting up John," Molly asks.
“Yeah, that definitely is a dead give away that,” Lestrade mused, shaking his head slightly at John. “And I here I thought you were sneaky,”
A few people smile at Mrs Hudson sneaking the phone out. Though the majority of them were shocked that Sherlock had actually forgotten the phone.
"He was having an affair with his secretary?" Molly asked shocked.
"Wait, what?" Donovan asked, eyeing Mrs Hudson in disgust.
Laughter fills the room at the inappropriately timed text alert, making everyone on the screen laugh in shock.
Transcript: Arainedevere
"Like the girl stalking John? What? She was chinese and acting weird," Donovan addded the last part when everyone gave her weird looks.
“How can Sherlock not know your coffee order?” Anderson questioned in shock. Even if Sherlock deleted information he didn’t need, he would still have gotten that information again and again. “He did it on purpose?” Anderson guessed after a look from John. Said male nodded in annoyance.
"That's not very nice," Mrs Hudson chided, Mycrfot opened his mouth, probably to say something mean, but propemtly shut it as he remembered that she was extremely close to his late brother.
"I still don't get it," Anderson whined slightly. Mycroft groans softly.
A couple people, mainly, John, Molly, Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson all snicker at Sebastian's annoyed look.
"Yeah, I figured that out, later" John muttered the last word while everyone else frowns.
“You’re not being silly,” Molly chided, sending a glare over at Mrs Hudson. “It’s a perfectly reasonable response,” She added in a no-nonse tone that no one thought she had.
"At least he's better at cover stories than talking to people," Kitty muttered under his breath.
"Maybe because of what she does," Molly guessed softly.
"Troubling settling in?" Lestrade teases slightly causing John to grumble even more.
“Trying a theory,” John admitted with a slight huff.
"How do you think?"
A sharp intake of breath is heard from everyone but Mycroft and John, as they all stared up at the screen in shock. Even Mycroft looked a little shocked as he reflected back on his relationship with his brother, wondering if Sherlock would ever do something like that.
"The best and worst part about the code," Lestrade sighs as he speaks, shaking his head in despair. "But at least now we know about it,"
"So he's a freak," Donovan muttered in disgust. John opened his mouth, before shaking his head it wasn't worth it.
“Is she really dead?” Anderson questioned, only being slightly suspicious because of Mycroft’s previous words.
The screen turned blank after Sherlock and Watson had walked off screen. Everyone waited for five minutes, not that they were counting, for the screen to turn back on. When it didn't turn back on they started moving around. Anderson moved closer to where the others were sitting and away from Donovan. Which made said Sergant frown after him.
"Why would anyone come to Sherlock for something like that?" Kitty questioned.
Everyone glared at Irene for using Sherlock like that, especially since it had given her the upper hand in hurting the Holmes brothers.

"That wasn't mean," Lestrade mused to himself. Wondering why Sherlock's explanations were always rude in some way to him and his team. Though he figured that it usually had to do with his team being rude to him first.
“Are you questioning my connections?” Mycroft answered for John, raising an eyebrow at Anderson.
"You really need to get better at lying John," Lestrade teases, John blushes and looks sheepishly at the ground.
--3rd P.O.V.--
"But he's not real, just something the freak made up so he could make himself look good." She was completely and utterly ignored.
--3rd P.O.V.--
"Nobody else is going to comment on the fact that we've been magically teleported into a room with no way out, being forced to watch some footage that probably comes across as stalkerish and a guy literally surrounded by shadows sitting in the corner?" Anderson yelled after a couple minutes of silence.
“I didn’t know he actually composed,” Donovan mused quietly. She had known that Sherlock liked to play the violin, but she had no idea that he wrote as well.
"Yeah, that's not going to help," Anderson couldn't help but tease.
Everyone winced at Sherlock’s terrible attempt to smile friendly. A few people finding it kind of terrifying.
“Yep,” John admitted.
"Is this a world wide documentary?" Donovan questioned in confusion.
"That's literally the worst thing you could say to Sherlock, espically when his  doing a case," Molly commented, everyone hummed in agreement, even those who didn't know Sherlock all that well.
John, Molly and Mrs Hudson all flinch slightly at the sight of Sherlock standing anywhere near a high ledge. John briefly closing his eyes to get the image of
“Yeah, that would be bad,” Anderson laughed, while the other all chuckled at the thought.
A few people sigh in relief, especially Mrs Hudson and those who had had the same train of thought as her.
"Ten bucks says it's Moriarty," John mutters darky, causing the room to fall in an awkward tension. The three yarders, even if one doesn't know it, was slowly starting to see the truth.
“Since then,” Lestrade answered with a grin. “I helped in the rest of the investigation,” He added when Anderson gave him a look.
Those who hadn’t already, finally realised what Sherlock was planning to do as he gave Lestrade a list of fake injuries.
John and those who believe that Sherlock is innocent winces, because in the end that's kind of what he did didn't he?
"If it's your shoulder then why do you have a limp?" Anderson asked curiously. John shuffled slightly in his seat but didn't respond.
"I don't know," John replies frowning.
A few people frown at Sherlock leaving to read Irene’s texts, more than one of their frowns was out of jealousy.
“We will, but we’ve all gotten used to not question all the weird things that happen around Sherlock,” John finally answered her.
"You know, fishing would be extrememly boring compared to working with Sherlock," Molly pointed out.
“When did she have time to get dressed?” Molly questioned in shock. After all, they hadn’t been talking that long, and Irene had been at Sherlock’s house.
"I-I had to help Sherlock," John answered sheepishly feeling guilty, espically after seeing Soo Lin's face.
"Why say don't stare if your just going to get up anyway?" Lestrade points out.
"He's good at what he does," John replied causing Lestrade to hum in agreement.
"Oh John," Mrs. Hudson and Molly both whispered, Mrs Hudson gently squeezing John's hand.
"Yes," Mycroft admitted.
"How could Sherlock possibly know that?" Anderson asked in shock.
"Good for him," Molly mused, glad that Sherlock was getting over his recent bout of cravings.
"Don't worry, it stopped hurting soon after I met Sherlock," John replied, a soft smile on his face.
"Why on earth would you think that?" Mycroft asked, and no one could tell if he was joking or not.
"To show that it was the last one maybe?" Lestrade answers, but he doesn't really know. "All the last ones were longer than the others.
"It still counts!"
"And there's the Sherlock we all know,"
"Did it ever cross your mind that John didn't want to accept the deal, because his an army doctor and has morals?" Anderson asked and Mycroft glares over at him.
"And who are you deary?" Mrs Hudson asks, okay so Mrs Hudson could think of something else. Mrs Hudson's questions causing a couple of people to mentally slap themselves for being so stupid.
Mrs Hudson and John huffs at the fact that Sherlock couldn't careless about catching a murderer. But they don't comment, unlike Kitty who mutters a disgusted "Of course," under her breath.
"So the killers chinese?" Anderson commented.
"You two really need to pay more attention to where your going," Anderson pointed out.
"*cough* Stalker *cough*" Donovan's half hide words caused everyone to chuckle slightly.
A few people sighed, though no one was surprised in the slightest at Sherlock by this point.
"Why do you think we know?" Mycroft snapped back, John glanced back in surprise, he had been so silent that John had forgotten he was there.
“How many girlfriends have you had?” Donovan questioned curiously, after all, they’ve only seen Sara on this.
A few people frowned at Sherlock’s words, after all he was, sentiment wasn’t in the losing side, sometimes it was the only reason the winning side wins.
“Does anyone else feel like we’re watching a horror movie?” Anderson questioned, his leg bouncing up and down.
At the sight of all the guns, a few people get slightly worried, after all, what was there to stop the soldiers from shooting Sherlock and John when they find out that the two aren't who they saw they are.
Laughter filled the room about Sherlock’s annoyance with the hat that everyone liked on him.
A few people snorted at Sherlock being over the top and calling it a palace.
The screen goes back to the scene before.
"Sherlock!" Mrs Hudson cried, sighing at the boy's single mindedness.
"That definitely sounds like Sherlock,” Mrs Hudson teases, “especially when he had to deal without you John,” She couldn’t help but add. John huffs, but knows better than to try and argue with her, which just spurs everyone else on.
"You're a terrible actor," Mrs Hudson comments causing John to sheepishly smile slightly.
"Cause that's not creepy," Anderson muttered under his breath.
“No,” Mycroft allowed, half surprised when he could say the spoiler.
Most people chuckle at Angelo.
"Whom," Mycroft commented, "it's who's sleeping with whom not who," He added at everyone's confused looks, the others chuckle slightly whilst Kitty, Moriarty and Donavan glare at Mycroft.
"You didn't know where you were?" Anderson asked curiously, turning around to stare at the doctor.
"You searched him up?" Anderson asks, curiously.
Lestrade smirks over at John slightly amusement dancing in his eyes.
"At least he knows," Anderson jokes, earning himself a few laughs.
"He really does care," Lestrade murmers, more speaking to himself than anyone else. Donovan frowns slightly, the guilt that had been pretty much silent slowly started to make itself more known as she started seeing Sherlock's... more human side.
Again, people chuckle at Sherlock being drugged.
“Wait, you actually got in?” Anderson questioned in shock.
"What's so important about Stapleton?" Anderson questioned curiously.
"Honestly, nothing Sherlock does anymore could surprise me," Anderson muses.
Lestrade groaned, "Why are you still there? I would of bailed long ago,"
-----
A few people snort at that, fully agreeing with John.
Transcript: Arainedevere
Everyone chuckles slightly, either it be at Mrs Hudson's repeated implication or John's face it doesn't matter.
"Freak," Donovan muttered for the umptith time, causing John to once again glare at her as his fists tighten. John shifts slightly, though before he can lunge at Donovan, chains wrap around his wrists, keeping him in place.
"He was just attacked, by the looks of it, from some kind of hound, of course that fear generaliased into all dogs, especially so soon after the attack," Mycroft pointed out in a duh voice.
While a few people blink in shock, most couldn't help but snort in amusement at Sherlock's tone.
Despite having seen Sherlock during his period of doubt, most still found it weird to think about Sherlock being in doubt about his own abilities.
"I'm suprised that Sherlock even knows part of the reference." John mused.
Everyone, even the people who were there, blink in shock at Sherlock’s very human response.
"Sherlock!" Mrs Hudson chatised, not being able to help herself.
No one speaks, but everyone chuckles at John's sarcastiasm.
"Writer's block?" Donovan asks, her tone slightly mocking. Everyone glared at her in response.
“Where would that be?” Kitty questioned curiously.
"Why are you so shocked?" Donovan questions. "Of course the freak had mutiple theories already." And if the words 'the freak' have a little hint of fondness, well no one pointed that out.
"You deserve better," Lestrade commented awkwardly. Feeling weird seeing the on-screen her so angry.
“John has a point,” Molly commented, ignoring Kitty.
“Why does Sherlock have the ticket plane to the one thats getting shot down?” Lestrade questions, his voice hard as he turns to Mycroft, knowing that he was the one who was behind it.
"... that's not the reference," Anderson pointed out,
Kitty's nose scrunched up in disgust at Sherlock's delight at this situation. While the others, for what seemed like the hundredth time sighed in disappointment at Sherlock's behaviour but not surprised.
“The photos are one the phone aren’t they?” Lestrade asks after he realises what Sherlock is throwing up and down. John hums in confirmation.
"I'm surprised he didn't get it from something like how he walked," Lestrade jokes, and Molly nodded, feeling better about herself.
"At least it's beautiful," Donovan remarked.
“What are you doing there?” Lystrade questioning curiously.
Molly and Mrs Hudson jumps slightly at Sherlock's outburst before sighing. "Sherlock," Mrs Hudson cries.
"You're the girl that caused wrote those articles about the f-" Donovan paused as all the glares that were thrown her way was ten times harder, all of them not wanting her to finish anything about it, especially not with their present company. "Sherlock," Donovan finished, hissing the word out with disgust. Kitty nods not knowing what else to say as John seethes in anger.
“What just happened?” Kitty questioned in shock.
"Why are you getting so angry?" Kitty questioned, John had always been Sherlock's fan. Sherlock had just 'solved' a case, she couldn't understand why John wasn't congratulating him. John shots her an annoyed look, but doesn't respond, mostly out of spite.
John snorts at that, "As if Sherlock would need any longer than that."
"This is just speculation and nothing more than rumours to attract tourists," Mycroft assured her, despite the fact that he had a fair guess that this case would contradict him. Much to his annoyance.
"Why would you stop for a gun?" Anderson asks incroudious.
"I almost feel sorry for them," Mrs. Hudson commented.
“He’s gonna ruin everything, isn’t he?” Anderson guessed with a slight huff.
Everyone chuckles at John who sheepishly blushes.
The second everyone had finsihed reading, the words were swept away revealing....
"Dun, dun dunnnnn!!!!"
"This isn't suspicious at all," Anderson muttered slightly. Shaking his head at the two.
But the screen never went back on.
"That really wasn't smart John, what if it was a murderer or something?" Molly chatised, and John just smiled back at her sheepishly.
"Of course he can," John can't help but mutter under his breath
"How does he hold so many books in one hand,"
“His ‘mind palace’?” Donovan questioned curiously, never having heard Sherlock mention anything like it.
"Our client thought it was the best way to explain the case," John replied politely.
"But he looked proud," Kitty couldn't help but question, her eyes narrowing at Sherlock.
"What suitcase? There is no suitcase there." Molly asks curiously.
Transcript: Arainedevere
"Of course it's the weird doctor," Kitty grumbled under her breath.
--3rd P.O.V.--
A few people glance over at them in confusion, with Moriarity smirking in the corner.
"Probably could have phrased that better," Anderson can't help but comment, wincing slightly. "But then again, Sherlock always was blunt,"
"Hey, why didn't that weird flashback thing happen?" Anderson asked, "You know, how it showed Eddi Van Coon,"
"And here I thought you weren't their housekeeper," Molly joked, causing a few people to snort, as they remembered how annoyed Mrs Hudson used to get whenever they asked her for tea.
“This is so confusing,” Anderson muttered under his breath.
"It really is beautiful," Mrs Hudson muses, and Molly hums in agreement.
“Of course she knew,” Donovan grumbled under her breath while the others glared, wishing that Sherlock’s plan had worked.
Mrs Hudson reaches out to grap John, in worry. Why the others who care about John kept casting looks over at him to make sure he was actually there.
--3rd P.O.V.--
Everyone frowns in confusion as they stared at the screen, everyone's mind whirling to try and figure out who these new people are.
“Sherlock always replies,” Lestrade mutters in confusion. “Doesn’t he?” He added looking over at Mycroft and John who both nod.
A few people huff while Kitty narrows her eyes in confusion. And Donovan just so happens to glance back in time to see Moriarty smirk proudly as he watched the screen.
‘I am not ignorant of the fact. I do not find it amusing at all. I know nothing of these men -  Holmes is, lest you should ask, unrelated to me -  and I wish to know nothing. I simply hope that they are efficient at their tasks. Holmes is not an uncommon name, in any case. And Sherlock is of Saxon origin, and means fair-haired. It may be uncommon as a Christian name, but not as a surname. One posits many fair-haired Saxons, all named alike. It is a coincidence, obviously.’
'If you would be so kind, Mr Holmes. I am sure we are all very grateful for your help. I am only sorry we did not call you in earlier.'
‘Watson,’ said I, as we began our breakfast, one cold day in autumn, ‘I shall have to go.’
‘Were Cornwall and Kirwan lovers?’ Watson asked, coolly, laying down his pen and flexing his fingers. ‘Or had they been?’
‘Thank you, Doctor. I shall do so directly.’ That infuriating woman let go of the door handle, and marched out, shutting the door of our drawing room, with, I thought, unnecessary triumph. I turned to Watson. ‘John, if you agitate yourself, I cannot answer for the consequences to your head. What are you about? Moore Agar said you were to remain calm.’
’ I said, clasping his hand. ‘Let nothing separate us, John!’
We dropped the subject of Wilde by mutual agreement, and our talk was then of politics and soldiering. The renewed interest in the end of the conflict in Afghanistan, and the conduct of our diplomats and generals there occupied him exclusively over the next weeks. His nightmares returned in full force, and with them a relapse of the fever. He spent several days huddled over the fire, wan and weary, and refusing food. Mrs Hudson and I cockered him up with nourishing soup, and whatever small delicacies I could afford and she could devise. He thanked us with gentle courtesy, but half the time I could see that his mind was far away. I wondered to what extent his bodily weakness was the result of his anguished feeling, or whether he might have been less physically low had he been mentally stronger, but soon I came to understand that the two were so intertwined as not to be separated. Whatever the underlying cause of his relapse, however, the end result was that by the time of his medical board in May, he was reduced to so very low and wan and trembling a condition as for its decision to be a foregone conclusion. He was invalided out from the army, and sent, with thanks for his sacrifice of health and livelihood, and a further small gratuity of twenty-five guineas ‘in recognition of your outstanding and noble service, Dr Watson, and may we say how sorry we are that you are not fit enough to return,’ out into the world to make his own way as best he could with shattered health, and no connexions.
‘I have known her since birth, Dr Watson, and seen her grow: she is some years older than my own children. No, there was never anything. She was, as I said to you at first, a merry thing, joyous and active  – almost what the French would term a
‘Nor I.’ He held out my coat for me. ‘But at least if Lady Laura has been helped to support her in her confinement, that is an advantage, and I daresay you will have this Mrs Forrester she mentioned visiting for advice also. You saw how grateful our friend Miss Stoner was over that wretched business with the snake: it would not be a bad thing if it got about that women may come to us for help. Put on your scarf and hat: this March wind is cold.’
‘He was nothing but an acquaintance at university – as you know, I had no friends there save the one, and Musgrave was not a man of my year after all, being in his last year while I was in my first – but I remember him coming to shake my hand after one of my more public deductions – it was about who had stolen the Master’s silver repeater, as I recall – and declare that he had never heard the like. Then later, when he had his own trouble, he telegraphed me and asked for my assistance. I suppose you could say that he was my first real case.’
‘Tell him to go away.’ I dipped a cloth in lavender water, wrung it out, and placed it on Watson’s brow; he lay in an uneasy sleep, and I did not want to wake him, but I could see from his frown, and the lines around his eyes and mouth that he was in pain. ‘I do not have time for his nonsense.’
*****
‘I do not know if I should go . . .’ His tone told me he wanted to. ‘Should I not stay and fight?’
'Thank God you did not go alone!'
So I took him away from it, thanking Mycroft wholeheartedly, and we travelled leisurely and in comfort to Paris, arriving early on the Monday morning and transferring there to the Express d’Orient for Vienna. Watson was as excited as a small boy as he boarded the train, and I could not repress a certain thrill myself at the power of the vehicle, the speed of travel, the luxury of our snug compartment with its neat fittings and the sensation that, despite this being a strictly business excursion, that we were on a holiday together. The charm of the whole event was undeniable: I could even spare a pious thought for Mr Gladstone, whose indiscretions had given us this chance.
‘I am of your mind’, he said. ‘I see now why Lestrade sent you to me; he knew I would be in need of a sympathetic hearer. The fact of the matter is, gentleman, that although the Act was a good Act, in that it offers protection to children who sorely need it, it has forever been tainted by this wretched amendment of Labouchère’s. I have been unwilling to say so – it is difficult to know – one must be very sure of one’s confidant – but – I do not see – in short, when these acts occur in private, and are private matters - this is a case where I am out of my depth. I cannot condemn him, yet it is as if he begs me to . . .’
‘Have you not just arrived? I was not aware - ’
'Nothing.' I lit my pipe, which had gone out. 'There is nothing you can do, and nothing in prospect. "O God! How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable. Seem to me all the uses of this world! Fie on't! O fie!" as the Bard has it. There is nothing to do, my Horatio, except sink into lethargy: I feel a creeping ennui, inexorable as doom. I warn you, John, I must have recourse to the needle tonight, for the reaction is upon me, and I cannot bear it.'
‘ – subdue, and I cannot sometimes – well, you saw for yourself how shamefully I was affected by it. You, when I observed you during the Dvorak, seemed as if rapt away to some aerial and heavenly plane, but I, I am afraid, am a creature of earthly clay and salt water and so must weep.’
Of course, truly happy endings do not occur in these sad times. They had still the father to deal with, and a return to the world. Whatever young Godfrey might have to suffer because of the supposed taint of his birth – which I, along with many of the more enlightened in society, do not consider a taint at all – and whatever Mr Dodd might have to suffer by association with him, they would have to bear together as best they might.
‘He appears to think you are connected to Gallagher’s gang,’ he said to me, ‘but of course, Mr Holmes, I knew you could not be, nor our Dr Watson neither. I disabused him of his notions – he was very vehement against you, averring that he heard you mention Gallagher, and Whitehead, for the news of their arrest is bruited widely about the street – and once I had dealt with him I thought then to warn you, in case of any further problem. All of London is in a ferment to think how much explosive these men brought to the capital (and that ass Dupré telling the world how great an area would have been devastated has not helped) so there is a fever to catch them.’
'Their names, Dr Watson, if you please?
‘I take it the doctor is not in a good humour,’ she said, observing me narrowly. ‘I am not surprised, Mr Holmes, when he comes home wet and cold and tired after a hard day’s work to such a pickle as this. You had best tidy up a little – more than a little, perhaps. There really is no excuse for it: if it is still the paper you are testing,’ – for she was well aware by now of the extent of my experimental work – ‘you had much better rig up a line across the room and peg the papers on it to dry, rather than letting them lie all about, haphazard in heaps, and getting crumpled. It is what any woman would do after all, that has ever run a house. But there, you’ve never done washing, so you couldn’t be expected to know. Pour Dr Watson a sherry, take it up to him, and tell him the room will be to rights in ten minutes, a good fire blazing, and there will be a roasted partridge with bread sauce for his supper, and syllabub after.’
‘Is not that the point of the story, Watson? Monte Cristo has pursued revenge to the exception of all else, he has arrogated to himself the mantle of godhood, he presumes to act as the deity in working out his revenge. He wished to punish those who injured him: his enemy de Villefort most of all, only to find that the cherished son of the only family he intended to reward had fallen in love with de Villefort’s daughter. His plans are thrown awry, he will save – he does save - Valentine, but he cannot deviate from the game he plays. He will not, rather. And it is in this that he fails, it is in this that he becomes less than a hero. He shows the inhumanity of which he is capable, and we see revealed in full his arrogance, his conceit, his selfish disdain for the feelings of others. It is well done. It is extremely well done.’
‘But I am sure that you can solve this little issue so simply, without even leaving your chair,’ he told me. ‘Lestrade will bring the evidence to you, and if you look at it for him, then that is all I will ask. What do you think of the honey?’
In the event, we did not take the Orient Express back to Paris on the Monday we had planned, but extended our stay in Vienna for a further few days, since it seemed a pity not to sample its delights while we had the chance. I wired Mycroft to remit funds from the Cornish estate, practising a pious fraud on my dear Watson, who believed that the government had paid for the whole. It was not just that I delighted in seeing him once more with medical men of some standing – oh, it was not that he was not well-regarded at Barts, and in the Police Divisions, but here his modest authority and his extensive knowledge of Indian medicine seemed valued in a way it did not at home – it was that I loved to have him at leisure, eased of his toil, and returning fresh from a meeting or a conversation to laugh and jest with me. At home he was often weary and sometimes sad, the long days impressing him only with a painful sense of his own helplessness against the crime and poverty he fought so valiantly. I was glad if he could set it aside for a while, even though I knew it to be never wholly forgotten.
a crime, of course I do not, my dear fellow. You have said yourself that romantic entanglements are anathema to you: how much more would a physical liaison be? I am simply saying that I do not need to know why you are exceedingly anxious about this thrice-damned case, to want very much to comfort you when you are distressed by it. So I beg that you will not concern yourself with what I think of you, since it would never, under any circumstances, be anything ill, and seek for comfort when you need it.’
‘And – and if, if, there were ever – a man – you loved – a man with whom you wished to share – the culmination, the physical culmination you spoke of as – as the rightful, the most natural end of love – would – would you? If you – could, safely, would you?’
‘That great and noble heart of his must have something to love, Mr Holmes. Dismiss him from your side, and he will soon find consolation elsewhere: it is only natural, after all. I am sure you will find, as the song goes, “Tis well to be merry and wise,” Mr Holmes, “Tis well to be honest and true,” and “Tis well to be off with the old love, before you are on with the new” is true of him as of many another. Think about it. I will give you a little time - a little respite, perhaps. But until he leaves your side, you will never know, remember. You will never know when, or where, or how the next blow will fall, nor whether it will be mortal. Is not his life worth your happiness? Is his happiness not worth your sacrifice of him? Think about it.’
‘It is a severe test. I do not know how a man could contemplate it. How many friends may a man have, that they can ask the extreme of each other? It is to say, ‘die at my bidding, friend, or hold off the manner of your death. To say ‘trust me’ for no reason I can tell you. There are not many friendships so deep - ’
Slowly, I cleansed and anointed myself, dressing in my nightshirt, drawers and gown. I felt ridiculously tired, drained as if I had been ill for weeks. If Mrs Hudson and the girl were indeed out, if there were to be no interruptions, I might perhaps sleep. Rest had been – elusive - of late, while I battled my demons.
‘Every night? Not quite? Most nights, then. And you have never thought to see a physician? About the insomnia?’
Dublin Jack. Bless him, he needs a story all to himself.  William O’Brien comes across badly in this story, which is necessarily seen from Holmes’ (and Mycroft’s) perspective.
‘How long was it before you went to bed?’
‘By no means,’ I clutched his arm more tightly, a cold shiver running through me. He to enlist! To travel far away from me, court injury and death where I could not save him. ‘You cannot go, Watson -  the  - the p - poor of London need you here, to advocate for them.’
I pulled away from him. 'I am so close, Watson. Pray do not stop me now: the end approaches.’
‘Yes,’ He clasped me closer. ‘I will be with you. Only do not – do not send me away.’
‘It is thyme honey, Holmes, from Hymettus. It is the ‘new Hymettus honey’ that the ancients, according to Horace, were wont to mix with old Falernian wine. I beg your pardon, my dear chap, for being infuriating.’
I related then to Watson, as earth turned, and the moon-shadows shifted across us, the events he later chronicled in the ‘Adventure of the Gloria Scott.’ What I could not, and did not say to him was that I had desired Victor. Nay, I had thought myself in love with him, insofar I was then able to feel love, not with a tenth of the passion I felt for Watson, but with all I was then capable of. Although my youthful desires had been sufficiently stirred for me to be aware of my own feelings, it was not until Victor that I truly understood that as a man I was, and ever would be, incapable of desiring a woman, that I was a congenital invert. It was then that I had turned to morphia to quell the cravings of my flesh, to ensure that I remained hidden, for Victor would never have countenanced anything of the sort between us. ‘Beastliness’  he called it, or ‘being spoony’ and maintained that such softness had no place between men, but was the mark of a weak and degenerate character. I could not tell Watson this, that I had longed, and desired, and forbidden myself from thought and deed with my evil demon’s help. Instead, I allowed him to infer that the events of the elder Trevor’s death, the guilt of my feeling that I had, in some sort contributed to it either by deducing imperfectly, or deducing anything at all, had driven me into a deep depression compounded by renewed loneliness.
‘I thought to test its power, and wondered if you would like to assist,’ I told him. ‘We could make some together and shape it into its little sticks. But I have run out of sodium carbonate, or washing soda, as most people know it, and to make dynamite, I must first obtain soda from Mrs Hudson, for that must go into the compounded mix as well. I might ask her for some now, I think, so as to lose no time, and to have all ready for our experiments with it on the morrow.’
One hundred and forty seven guineas he’d have had, for the nine months, sixteen or so guineas a month, and five months of it possibly spent before I met him. Sixty four guineas at the most for four months, and thirty of them set aside for our six months’ rent and good lodging. Thirty four guineas was all his poor living then, and that for six months, if he wanted to stretch it to July: seven hundred and fourteen bright silver shillings to stretch over one hundred and eighty days. About three shillings and ten-pence ha’penny a day, by rough reckoning . .  . Twenty-seven or so shillings a week, and five of them a week at least on his laundry for he was fastidious as a cat. It did not leave much for his
*****
‘Have you seen her since?’ I asked. Again, I exchanged a glance with Watson. He looked grim and sad, and as if I read his mind, I understood that he thought he knew what was the truth of the matter, but he shook his head just slightly, so I forbore to question him. ‘Has there been further deterioration in her behaviour that warrants Lord Durham’s ire?’
‘Holmes, do be serious.’ He sighed, but his eyes were amused. ‘No, I perceive that you are being serious, but pray, my dear fellow, do not fix your mind on the title, for that is a mere trifling issue compared to what is at stake here. I daresay Stead did not think at all other than to have a high-sounding and impressive headline. I am sure he is neither a classical scholar nor a seeker after truth and accuracy, when there is good press to be had. Will you sit down, my dear and listen to me a little? I really do not know what to do for the best here.’
Mycroft was very discreet in referring to 'their dear mutual friend, Melas.' Melas must, of course, have been particularly intimate with Mycroft for the great man to have been so concerned about him (as the reader will no doubt see when Holmes recounts the story of the Greek Interpreter.
'There is still good in the world, you see,’ I said to him, as we left her in her comfortable home. 'There is a kind woman, who thinks of making another's lot easier. I wish more of our cases ended as well.’
‘I endeavour not to be over-confident – it is not hard when one is faced continually with life and death – but I question whether I am doing enough, Holmes, whether I am ‘sleeping on the case’ as it were.’ He stood still, and I stopped perforce, too. ‘I have been speaking to our police divisional surgeon, Dr Burns-Gibson recently - a man whose medical, and indeed, political, views are much after my own heart. He is of the opinion that we want reform in the profession, in society, and perhaps even in Parliament, and I agree with him. He shares the views of Mrs Besant, and Mr Bradlaugh, and is much interested in advancing them.’
He rested his hand on my shoulder ‘Very well, my dear fellow, we shall not speak of it. Should you like me to assist you to retire now, or would it please you if I were to read to you for a little? Or if you were of a mind to, we could read our Dumas together and pursue poor Dantès’ adventures?’
‘Blackmail. As we have been discovering.’
Shagreen is shark or ray skin, cured into leather and polished.
‘Holmes, what,’ said Watson to me as he entered our sanctum, some weeks after the attempt upon him. He had kept to the house for a week, for it took time for his headaches and nausea to resolve but was now hale and hearty again – although he went nowhere alone without advising me and with one of our street boys to watch him, for we did not know when an attempt might come again. ‘Holmes, what is that appalling stench? I have known sweeter air in charnel houses.’
'Now I reflect,' he said, slowly, 'now I reflect, I believe he referred to her as "your patient." I did not think anything of it; we were much occupied, of course. But upon reflection, it seems strange, as if he implied that - that I had had her sent there. He said he was glad of my assistance, for the palpation, even an external investigation, was a delicate affair - but - but yes, it seems strange that he took my arrival quite for granted.'
‘Say rather the most jealous, Sherlock. She had been an active woman, you tell me, fond of sport, and dance. And, forgive me, but for you to have been engendered, there must have been some falling away from her husband, some flaw in their love that led her to wander aside. But after your birth there was nothing, only her injuries, and the shame of you – shame would the world call it: rather a blessing; had you never lived, my friend, I would be long since gone, for I owe you my very life – and his constant presence, always there, always a reminder of her transgression, her pains and her grief.’
As he looked on with a flattering degree of interest, I placed a wooden board on a chair by the window, and dropped a small quantity of the fluid onto it. ‘All I have now to do is to place the liquid under pressure, and you will see the reaction.’
But still the Bill languished. It had been in committee for three years now, Watson told me, pacing our rooms like a tiger. ‘Three years, and there is still no appetite to pass it. It is shameful, shameful in this day and age and in a Christian nation. How can we call ourselves enlightened, and seek to impose our manners and morals on those we call savages? Even Rome was not so bad!’
‘You did help. It is better with you here,’ I told him. ‘I have taken nothing for it, this time, no drugs or stimulants. Usually I cannot bear the emptiness, the dark cloud of melancholy that seems to encompass me, to weigh me down, but I knew you were there, Watson, and it helped.’
‘Of course,’ I rose too. ‘Thank you for the thought; that would be delightful. You are in a particularly good humour this morning, Watson, yet I cannot deduce a particular cause. Do you care to enlighten me?’
I remembered very little of the rest of the journey. Watson’s hat was indeed spared, but I was extremely sick in the privacy of our own home. After he had mended my bruises and cleaned my lip and eye, he helped me bathe and assisted me into bed. He stayed with me all night, waking me at intervals and asking the most ridiculous questions, I think to ensure that I was not becoming comatose. By morning, he seemed satisfied that I was on the mend, so he went off to his own room to nap, while I dozed, looked in on at intervals by Mrs Hudson.
I was rather more successful in my investigation on the Tuesday, and it was unnecessary to evade pursuit. This was fortunate, since I could not have run fast despite the improvised bandage I had applied to my ankle. However, although I felt I had the answer to rather more of the ‘Mystery of the Inexpensive Diamonds’ than I had had before, in another respect there was clearly more to discover.
'Lie easy, then, my dear, and let me smooth it out for you.'

‘Holmes, my dear fellow, come out of your brown study, and say whether you will take tea or madeira?’ I had been lost in my musings for some moments, it appeared, for a tray stood on the table, and he had already served our visitor. ‘I have recommended to Lady Laura that she should take Madeira; it is late for tea. What will you have?’
‘All the better then: if he too is able to offer Dr Watson any sort of an alibi, I care not who else he be threatening. Who took the doctor’s place at the hospital yesterday evening?’
It was true that his belongings could have fitted entirely into the two smallest of my many valises. I confess to being something of a dandy after all, a dandy with a regrettable penchant for the finest of woollens, and the caress of silk. He, by contrast, had little, and all of the plainest, his linen neat and of good quality, but sadly worn, and his overcoat a threadbare apology that would certainly not serve the winter. It was true he could fit all his possessions into the slip of a room upstairs. But it was not that that removed him from the level nearest to the street, nearest to me, and to our landlady down below. It was not until the third night that I heard him scream in his sleep, and not until a week later that I dared to climb the stairs, barefoot in the dark, and listen outside his closed door to the strangled, terrified weeping that succeeded the screams. He’d told me that his nerves wouldn’t stand a row, and they would not, least of all one of his own mind’s making. Every morning, Mrs Hudson informed me that he came late to breakfast, weary and shadowed, before trifling with toast, taking great draughts of tea, as if it were some sovereign panacea, and retreating to his chair to drowse away the day. He’d asked, apologetically, for the simplest and plainest of food to be provided, and knowing that enteric fever led to months of unpleasant intestinal sequelae, I had so arranged it with Mrs Hudson.
‘I have,’ I replied, gravely, and I had. I had woken him now on more than one occasion, standing and calling him softly, beguiling him back to the world. Sometimes he would turn away from me when he woke, shamed and shaking, and then I set his brandy down by him, and retreated without a word, to spare him. Sometimes he would utter a word of thanks, stretch out his hand, and I would give him the glass. Once our fingers touched. I felt his trembling, and he uttered a wordless apology, and pulled away. Once he smiled at me, and called me a good fellow, and kind to him. Kind! Would that I could have been kinder! Would that I could have been tender to him in his distress! I scarcely knew what tenderness was, either given or received, but for him I would have learned.
‘Perhaps if you also take a little, we might go for a ramble after the show. If you recall, Aschenbrandt said that the muriate had an extraordinary power of staving off fatigue, which we have not yet tested. The moon is full too: I love to walk in a moonlit night.’
'Do you wish me to . . .' I began, but Watson halted me with a look.
‘Watson, wake, it’s Holmes. You were dreaming, old fellow, there’s no threat. Wake, Watson, it’s a dream. I only sought to wake you, come now, Watson, it’s only I. Wake up, Watson, you were dreaming.’
The French passages from Dumas are extremely important: it was always my intention to use them in this way.
Soon after came Christmas, our first together as room mates. Mrs Hudson had asked my permission to decorate our rooms. I could not see why she would want to, but gave it nevertheless, ‘Only that you do not disturb my decomposition experiment, Mrs Hudson, for a man’s life may depend upon it.’
'Take a pinch of snuff; I filled the box on a whim, but I am no Regency dandy to be making a show of taking it. Yes, retire. Do you think that we can live this life for ever? At the moment, we must bend our energies to dealing with the present threat. But afterwards . . . at some point, I must retire, certainly. You also, I think?'
‘Thank you.’ Watson smiled ruefully as between us we piloted him to the sofa and landed him there. ‘I am less steady than I thought, it seems. The fact of the matter is, Lestrade, that it has been a bad business, and we have not had chance to speak of it to you yet, but I am afraid I must. The tale runs thus: I was decoyed to a house on pretext of visiting a woman in a cross-birth – of course, whoever planned this knew that I would come. But when I arrived at the supposed place, there was something odd – no women, no sound of children, no female voices, no midwife that I could see, and, I do not know how it was but I sensed the trap, and turned to retreat. I was felled from behind,’ he passed a hand over the back of his head, wincing, ‘and taken to a house where I was to be put in a compromising situation and blackmailed . . .’
‘It is the poor little mother who is fatigued, and rightfully so, for hers was the ordeal, not mine. I cannot compass the courage of women in childbirth; to march into guns in the heat of battle is one thing, but to endure again and again nine months of carrying only to dice with death at the end of it is another. I must make interest for her with Mrs Hudson, pray remind me in the morning: some bowls of nourishing beef soup and a pint of porter a day would not go amiss. She is very thin and slight for feeding two, poor young thing. Ah, thank you, my dear fellow.’ (I had passed him a sovereign, “for your newest god-children, my dear Watson”.) “But I was wrong to judge you in those first days of knowing you: you are not unapt for friendship. The circumstances of your youth have made you distrustful, and like many lonely children you have not the knack of easy converse; it is thence your disinclination to friendship springs. But when you love, you love with a clear soul, and a kind heart, and it is beautiful to see. I bless the day I met you, my dear fellow: never had man a companion so leal, or ever was received into a heart so true.’
I left Watson standing there, and escorted Gregson down in silence. As I opened our front door for him, he drew himself up to his full height.  'I think you and Dr Watson should be careful, Mr Holmes. The law does not protect felons. It punishes them for their felony. No felon can hide from our scrutiny forever. And your doctor friend spoke of double lives - I read a book recently which touched on them: it may not have come in your way, however. It is by Stevenson, and the main character in it was a doctor with curious habits: a superficial philanthropist, but a night walker and one given to chemical investigations, and other such odd pastimes. Dr Jekyll was his name. It was an interesting study, that book, and one which I recommend for your perusal.’
Anyone interested in the Persian situation and the politics is welcome to message me on Tumblr, where I am happy to discuss it.
‘No need, they were a gift from a grateful patient. They were freely given, and so it is fitting they should be freely given away. Holmes, my dear man, I would infinitely sooner have your company, wherever it be. And a walk under the moon sounds delightful: I used to walk often by moonlight in the army, or to lie out, when I could, and contemplate the stars. So big and bright as they were in the still air, and that sky so velvet-black: it was a magnificent show. I would I could show you what like it was here, to feel so small, so insignificant under that immense sky, and yet to be able to name them in their myriads.’ He sighed. ‘Ah, Mrs Hudson, would it inconvenience you to send Janey to the Lestrades this evening? I have tickets for the new show at the Savoy, and wish to give them a treat. I thought Janey might sit with her brother there, and mind the children while they attend the operetta. And Mr Holmes and I are walking tonight, so perhaps just a sandwich or two for dinner?’
‘You are rambling to some purpose, Watson, and I am inestimably grateful. Light breaks upon me: you are its conductor, as always. Forgive my churlishness, if you please, it was unwarranted. And so are Holder’s suspicions: the boy could not have broken the coronet in situ, and to think so is preposterous. Had he done so, to somehow conceal the piece about his person for a future sale to cover his debts, it would have snapped like a pistol shot. All would have heard it. And you saw that I tried, myself, to break it. You know that I am exceptionally strong in the fingers - ’
The water was agreeable to my parched throat, and once started, I drained the glass. We were in the dog-days, and the weather had been very hot: I sat in my shirt sleeves and near the window, to catch what breeze might be found. The punch I set aside: I did not want to drink alcohol. Watson and Lestrade might be as convivial as they chose, but I was not for company that evening.
I could go to him now, I thought, and say, ‘Watson, let me sleep with you. Turn to me, let me be your solace, your comfort. I know nothing, but for you I would learn, do, offer, all.’ I could fit my body to the curve of his, protecting his back, watch him sleeping as, waking, he watched me. Perhaps after sleep, loosened from the bonds of fear, he might turn to me, accepting, trusting, and we might embrace, our hands seeking each other’s bodies, tenderly exploring flank and hip and groin, our mouths, lip to lip, exchanging breath that would hitch and sob, speed and falter, become broken, ecstatic, triumphant . . . sated, sweet . . . then murmur praise, love, joy in vows and promises that we would be alone no longer, but a conjoined creature, of one mind, one body, one heart, coupled, inseparable . . .
Our as-yet limited use of the drug had produced some interesting results, however. The cocaine cigarettes and cigars we had, by mutual consent, discontinued, since we both of us preferred the smell and taste of plain tobacco, and I found swallowing a dose more effective. We had both tried nasal and buccal administration, but while agreeing that these might be extremely useful where analgesia was required, the side-effects were unpleasant: it had taken Watson a good twenty minutes to stem a nose bleed that left me shaking and faint, and him liberally bespattered with my blood. We had eventually had to resort to gauze packing and ice - and the resultant mess meant I was unwilling to experiment further. I had no wish for him to see me in such undignified straits. One cannot expect a man to see one in a romantic light – and hope had not yet died that he would someday see me in such – when he is engaged in inserting folded gauze into one’s nostrils with a pair of blunt forceps. A gunshot wound, if not serious, and honourably acquired, may be productive of a declaration of affection – at least if one is to believe the romances that Watson reads. A nosebleed is plain, and prosaic, and most dreadfully lowering.
‘Gregson is always busy, and always dilatory and always ineffective: I have no doubt that it contributed to the death of Kratides, and I have every intention of mentioning it to the Inspector when next I see him. Those formalities! I swear if I signed papers once, I signed them three times and all to enter a house that I could have entered on my own without his assistance. Did, indeed, enter on my own without his assistance for he was of no practical use, offering to break down the door when it was the easiest thing in the world to force the window. If I had allowed him to do what he wanted we would have had the whole neighbourhood down upon us, and such a hue and cry as never was, to the detriment of Mycroft’s composure, and your doctoring.’
He knelt in front of me, his hands on the arms of my chair as if to embrace me, looking up into my face with those dark-blue eyes.
'From whom?' His mouth shut like a steel trap on the bitten-out words.
‘But you do not condemn the man himself?’
‘Thank you.’ Watson stretched and yawned. ‘Will it ever stop raining this winter, do you think? I am not sure but what we are approaching a second Deluge. And are you not curious to know the sender of the missive you have just destroyed?’
‘I was.’ I suppressed a shiver. In the year 1877 I had been an unhappy, lonely young man, three years down from a university I had left in disgrace, eking out a sparse existence on hack detective work, and in my too copious spare time, sitting amid the nude kouroi and marble athletes in the British Museum attempting to understand the depths of my own perverse nature. ‘And Watson was in the army, were you not, my dear fellow?’
‘No, indeed, Holmes, it is a wonder of a book. This is a magnificent library, a joy to the intellect and the eye, and I would be more than happy to spend some hours here with you. Our host has soundly thrashed me at the game, by the way: I am woefully out of practice. He is gone now about some business with his bailiff, and desired me to tell you to ring if you required anything – tea, or whatever – before his return. What an agreeable man he is, Holmes! He has been telling me of his memories of you at college. I did not know you were such an expert at the noble arts of sword and fisticuffs. I have never seen you fight in a contest.’
And yet, when the libel trial began,  because the ‘felonious practices’ were not named, only the circumstances in which they were carried out, the impression given was of men whose lives were spent in aimless wandering around a city of dreadful night, of men with lives that came to life only after decent men were in bed beside their wives. Cornwall, French, Kirwan – the men most aimed at – walked home together from concerts together. They walked to dinner engagements. They took cabs together before and after they walked, and in those cabs unspeakable and nameless events occurred. They rambled in parks, and through botanical gardens, where they most assuredly did not study the flowers, and into and out of clubs, theatres, hothouses and even each others’ houses like errant, ambulant suns attracting into their orbits the lesser planets of Malcolm Johnston, George Taylor, Malcolm McKiernan. Other, smaller satellites, circled them: the lowly young men of the street who sold themselves to these wanderers. There were looks, significant words, touches, embraces - a dance of small intimacies, all catalogued, investigated, expounded upon with prurient interest. Someone’s hand rested on a knee in a cab. There was an encounter under a holly tree. (Watson commented wryly that he could think of trees better suited for trysting under.) There were embraces in a dressing room. An embrace on a chair. Letters were written. (Cornwall’s letters – affectionate, pleading, amused, gently endearing – were read out in court.) Gifts of music were sent. Music. It hurt, that ‘musical’ should be turned into a term of abuse, a term synonymous with what was considered the vilest of crimes. ‘You are all musical all of you, are you not?’ commented the judge, and made it a condemnation. I touched my violin with a caressing hand: it was so dear to me, so very dear. I did not play it much at that time.
‘So he has been running a system of blackmail for years?’ he asked. ‘But not as blackmail, in the sense that he has information that he holds over someone?’
As for the son, when released from arrest, he came to thank us, and nigh wept on Watson’s shoulder, as a young recruit to a trusted Captain, pouring out such a tale of misery that Watson came from their meeting grim-faced, uttering imprecations that scorched the patient air. I was glad then that I had offered a little help to the wretched boy, and could tell Watson so. He had ever a soft heart for young things, did Watson, although he maintained, against my denials, that it was I who was tender over the wounded and abused.
‘I do not know.’ I touched his hair again, allowed my hand to rest on his shoulder as he turned back to the fire. ‘I have never known it before – before you.’
‘It is impeccable, Watson. I will finish it: tell me if I have translated correctly. “my love for you is another love: my father died, and I did not die; as for you, if you were to die, I would die.” So hers was a primrose love also, it would seem.’
‘See that you are not,’ he replied, patting my hand, ‘for I do not wish to lose you. I must clear up here, Holmes, and then clean and prepare the revolver for you to take with you. Do you go upstairs, and lay out the clothing you wish to take with you, and I will show you how we pack in the Army. Mrs Hudson has cleaned your case properly, so we may use it now without fear of you soiling your linen. I would not have you appear a sloven in front of your diamond merchants and financiers.’
'I'll see you out myself, Inspector.' I opened the door for him. 'No need to call Mrs Hudson.'
I mended the fire and stirred it into a blaze - it was full summer, but the weather had been foul, with a dusting of snow even in July. The previous evening had been damp, and overcast, and although it promised fair later that day, with the skies predicted to clear, it had been cold around dawn. I settled a blanket around his shoulders, and mixed him a brandy with a little soda, urging him to sip it slowly. 'Tell me about this murder, John.'
'Why do you say 'in this instance'?'
He rang the bell for Mrs Hudson, fetched water and bathed my hand, all the time with the gravest expression on his face, one for which I could not account at all. When Mrs Hudson came, he ordered tea for us, and then continued to bathe my hand. His touch was soothing. I focused carefully on it, quantifying the pressure of his touch, estimating the temperature of his skin, observing the branching of the veins in his wrist, and began to feel a little calmer as the heated excitement of my earlier activities receded.
‘I thought you sunk in depression at times, with no cases, but it was this then? You used it to medicate your boredom.’ He said it as if he had just realised this fact.
I saw him shiver, and moved to the window to stand by him, slipping my hand into his arm as if we were walking together. ‘Do you wish to tell me?’
‘Your observation improves: I am impressed.’ I used my driest tone.
*****
‘I made you angry yesterday, forgive me. It was clumsy of me to draw attention to those names, and unpardonable of me to force you to take a case. I shall not do so again, nor presume upon our friendship.’
Watson and I were companionable together. We were always good companions. He bore so gently with my whims and fancies, as I bore with his occasional growls, when a sharper wind than usual set him limping. For the sake of prudence, and because, being strangers to the country, there was nowhere we were not remarked, we did not share a bed on our travels, save for two nights in the Cairngorms, where we lay together in a bothy on straw covered with our coats, a rough blanket over us, and our knapsacks for our pillows. We were fully clad, for it was a wet evening, but Watson drew me to him at once as we blew out the candle, and I was fain to lie close with him. His arms encircled me; my head rested on his shoulder. I do not believe we slept much that night or the next, only his fevered lips were pressed repeatedly to my flushed brow and cheek, and my hand lay over his heart to feel its flurried beating. If he burned as I did beneath my buttoned-up clothing, or took himself hastily in hand for relief as I had had to do after we parted in the morning to our separate cold ablutions, we neither of us spoke of it. What words we did murmur to each other under those two starless, moonless nights, I treasured beyond all else. I had never thought to find myself so cherished.
For answer, Lestrade drew a paper from his pocket and flattened it so we could both see the superscripture directing it to him. ‘This paper here – this accuses you both as – well, I will not say it. It was delivered at the Yard – the day before I called you down here. There is no signature, of course; there never is with this filth. A nameless crime, naming others for nameless crimes. I hate an anonymous letter writer as I hate a blackmailer: both are vile. It was handed to my sergeant – enveloped and sealed, but addressed to me. Read it, if you please, gentlemen. I regret the necessity, but I would not be doing my duty if I did not make you aware of it.’ Another pause. ‘I have made no man else privy to it, but retained it in my own possession,’ he said then, and I could see how much the admission cost him. It was not in Lestrade to conceal anything; even if there was no onus on him to be open, he would naturally be so. One read it in his eye, his brow: here was a man of integrity.
(See the end of the chapter for
He sighed again.
‘He has certainly shown his true colours,’ I said. ‘You will find many an honest whore but he is not one: a man with whom indulgence in the carnal pleasures cannot be relied upon not to lead to blackmail. Of all villains I detest a blackmailer most, I think.’
‘I had soup, I seem to recall,’ I protested, as he covered me again with the blankets. ‘I am too warm now, Watson, you need not swaddle me like a babe.’
‘Rouse up, old chap, lying there will do your shoulder and leg no good at all. What time is it? I seem to have mislaid my watch.’
I called him three times, but it was not until I gently took his uninjured hand and stroked the pulse point at his wrist, that his heavy lids fluttered open, and shut again.
‘I shall keep him there until the case is finished, Inspector, on the pretext of guarding Sir Henry, for he is safer by far there than here. Lestrade, my good fellow, what I am investigating on the wilds of Dartmoor is also murder, planned, evil, cold-blooded murder, perhaps one perpetrator, perhaps with accomplices, and I do not know who I can trust there. If I were to wire you and ask you to bring down a blank warrant for arrest, could you attend me?’
‘John,’ I said to him. ‘John, what is it?’
Since I had never known Porlock but disguised and under an alias, and dead bodies washing up on the shores of the Thames may come from anywhere, I never knew for certain whether the one Lestrade drew to my attention some few days after our investigation was he. I suspected it, however: Moriarty was never one to retain a tool unless he believed it would answer only to his own hand, and with Moriarty, to suspect disloyalty was to act to end it. My suspicions about his executioner were less tenuous: only one man, to my certain knowledge, possessed a gun capable of firing the bullet Watson extracted from our corpse's sodden breast, and that was Moran. I had known for some time of Moriarty's assistance in the development of Van Herder's air gun, and nothing appeared more likely than that he would place such a weapon in the hands of his assassin, for he would have scorned to dabble his own dainty fingers in the blood of the unworthy: his killing was all by proxy.  But with no other proof than the bullet, and that knowledge, I could not bring the crime home to either the Professor or the Colonel.
‘What of it?’ I asked.
‘I am calm. Come to me, Holmes. Sherlock . . .’
He turned me to face him, took both my hands in his. ‘
'I do not believe I am a conventional woman any longer, Dr Watson.'
‘Providing we do not heat anything in your flasks,’ He smiled at me, although his eyes were sombre. ‘I have no desire to court poisoning. Until later then.’
‘You speak of your sister.’ He had moved to the sofa; I followed him. ‘May I sit with you? My dear fellow, I know it. Your life is an expiation. But you are too hard on yourself: you were too young to understand what was happening until it was already too late, too powerless to effect change, too – let me say it – too beaten down yourself to rebel. You tell me that although I use reason, my heart guides it. Watson, you have a heart more tender than any I know. Let reason comfort it now, that it may be kinder to itself and to you.’
‘I know of Cornwall. And Jack Saul knows him of old, you say? Well, Johnson, you must get me a meeting with Jack. No, not like that,’ as Johnson uttered a great laugh and another vilely obscene comment, this time about what Jack and I might do, ‘Enough, man, enough, I wish to speak to him about all of this: he may have information that is relevant to the case.’
‘Don’t,’ I said, as we drove off, He was supporting me against him. My throbbing head rested on his sound shoulder, and his arms were around me.
‘I do. As for the child, her rights are almost ignored in the outcry that her case has conduced towards the general good; that she suffered so others might not. But Justice Lopes has been sufficiently severe upon his character to satisfy even you, surely?’ I looked at the trial report. See, he says to Stead “I cannot forget you are an educated man, who should have known that the law cannot be broken to promote any supposed good, and that the sanctity of private life cannot be invaded for the furtherance of the views of an individual who, I am inclined to believe, thought the end would sanctify the means.” Does that condemnation not satisfy you?’
Lestrade sighs slightly, shaking his head. Feeling slightly useless about that.
Molly frowned, feeling sorry for the poor monkey and the other animals being kept there for experiments.
“Oh that was actually a good idea,” Anderson mused, after a few seconds of having to remember where he got the invoice from.
“God this really does feel like a horror movie,” Molly muttered, sinking into her chair, because she hated horror movies.
"Sherlock's not going to believe that," Molly whispered. Thinking back to the times Sherlock had dismissed anything he couldn't see or know about with tangible proof.
“Playing dumb doesn’t really suit Sherlock,” Anderson couldn’t help but comment. Donovan chuckled in agreement.
"Wait, why can you see it?" Anderson questioned, turning to face his boss.
"Well done Anderson, you exceeded my expectations," Mycroft commented randomly, but Anderson did look slightly proud at his words. "Your not as stupid as you seemed," Anderson immediantly frowned after Mycroft finished speaking.
"No, not really, I mean I wasn't exactly listening when Greg said where the crime scene was and I never heard Sherlock talking to the taxi," John explained, feeling like an idiot.
"You must of been so confused," John murmed, laughing softly. Mrs Hudson nodded smiling slightly.
A few people laughed at John instantly pouncing on getting the money from Sherlock.
“It’s probably really happening,” John responded, though he wasn’t fully sure.
"How much do you think it pained him to write in 'Maggie'? Lestrade questioned with a grin.
The other's stretched got up and started stretching feeling quite cramped from sitting down for so long.
Everyone winced slightly, feeling worried for Henry. The officers hated that they couldn't do anything to help him.
"Did she know about the painting being a fake?" Molly questions.
"Does he really have that much faith in us?" Lestrade asks, once again shocked by Sherlock, but this time in a different way.
--3rd P.O.V.--
“What was it?” Kitty questioned curiously, looking over at John. John glances over at her before shrugging. After all if he didn’t say anything when Molly asked, he certainly wasn’t going to do it when Kitty does.
"Sherlock never asks if he gets anything wrong," Lestrade mutters but everyone hears him clearly.
"Wait?" A few people shrieked glaring at Moriarty as their hearts started racing again.
"Yep,"
Now it was everyone’s turn to be completely shocked at the fact that Sherlock was at that execution. Though a few couldn’t help but wonder, how the hell he managed to find her, and without anyone noticing.
Everyonce winced as Frankland completely destroyed John’s efforts to try and figure out what was happening. A few others started to glare at him as well.
"Wait if it's in the fog, then how many people do you think this has affected just so he could keep Henry quiet?" Donovan questions with a frown.
The officers huff at that, they did their best okay?
"Thank God," Mrs Hudson breathed as Molly let go of Lestrade's hand suddenly flustered.
“It’s alright, I figured it would happen,” Mycroft admitted. He did know his brother, and he figured that he would want to keep something from the case file.
"Surely even someone like yourself Sally, should wonder, if my brother, like you say, made up all these crimes, then why was he so excited with each new case."
--3rd P.O.V.--
“Forget protection, I’m gonna kill you for messing with Sherlock,” John growled in annoyance, his eyes narrowing.
"Do you think who ever's folding the paper is this Shan person?" Molly asks as they all stare, kinda scared, at the screen. John stiffens slightly at her words, finally realising who it is but doesn't say anything, no one else replies but a couple of people hum in agreement.
“What happened to the unlimited access?” Donovan questioned worriedly. Glancing over at John in slight fear.
"Try and use your brain for once and figure it out," Mycroft replied.
"Yeah, that's his plan," John confirmed, sounding very unimpressed.
"Sherlock, you'll give the poor girl a heart attack," Mrs Hudson scolded.
"Because he was desperate," Mycroft responded quietly.
“Why would they bother coming back? Especially with their leader in prison and the fact that Mrs Hudson wasn’t their actual target,” John defended.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Do you think this will tell us something important? Like how the last case had the deaths?" Lestrade asks curiously, everyone he turns to shrugs back until finally he turns to Mycroft who ignores him, mostly because he didn't really have a questions.
"Wait, is what happened last night, the part that was shown at the very start of this case?" Anderson questioned curiously. "With him being in the woods as a grownup?" He added.
"Did Sherlock just quote a TV show?" Anderson comments, grinning slightly in amusement at the thought.
Worry filled the room, no one knew exactly how much time had passed, which just increased their worry even more.
"Sherlock was right wasn't he?" John asked, he had forgotten to ask before, but know as he watches it again, he can't help but confirm it.
"What?" A few people question, but no one keeps talking. Every single one of them wanting to hear what else Sherlock has to say.
"Really, Sherlock?" Molly asked, amusement filling her tone. The original ones, (everyone but Moriarty and Kitty) all chuckled slightly, and in Mycroft's case, that meant his lips lifting in an amused smirk.
“She’s good for a reason,” Mycroft admitted, sounding like the confession pained him a bit.
"You'll just have to watch to find out."
"To much to count, but that's Sherlock for you," John replied, a bit of annyoance lacing his voice as he remembered all the times he's supposed partener in crime left him.
"It does sound insane," Lestrade added more softly, Molly hummed deciding to stay quiet instead of asking the questions on the tip of her tounge.
"Is he really going to go after the murderer alone?" Molly asks, though she pretty much already knew the answer.
"Worried about your boyfriend?" Lestrade teased, John instantly becomes slightly flustered as he shouted an unintelligible response.
"Sherlock, don't you dare get in that car!!!!" Mrs Hudson cried out, like a mother scolding her child.
"That is actually pretty cool," Anderson commented, and Donovan glared slightly at him.
"Where is this?" Anderson questioned curiously, as he studied the landscape. It definitely wasn't in London.
"How did he notice any of that? He only brefly looked around the important?" Anderson's voice was filled with masked wonder, no one answers him as the answer itself was pretty obvious. Cause 1 it's Sherlock, and 2 unlike the rest of us he observes. Though John did end up explaing that to him.
Kitty gives on-screen Sherlock a look of disgust while the others sigh in sadness at Sherlock's behaviour, but they weren't even slightly surprised.
"If you had seen the sneaker, would you have figured out any of that like John did?" Lestrade questions, smirking when she doesn't answer.
"Wasn't that obvious?" Anderson mutters and John nods slightly, embarrassed that he had asked such an obvious question.
"And you thought he was a good person? He wouldn't even help the government because of a petty sibling rival," Kitty muttered under her breath but being the only one not to notice the smirk on Moriarty's face as he stared at the screen. Sowing a few seeds of doubt in the stubborn detective, and confirming something for the other two.
"Were you really going to just leave him?" Molly asks in shock.
“It helps him think,” John grumbled.
“You have to admit that it’s kind of ironic that the two have switched positions,” Donovan couldn’t help but point out, trying to feel a little bit better about everything.
“Why can’t we see what this hound looks like?” Kitty questioned, started to get even more frustrated, while trying to push down her own fear.
Now everyone chuckled in amusement at Sherlock's comment. A few wondered if Sherlock had finally gone mad.
Everyone but Mycroft chuckles slightly. Well when I say everything, I mean everyone that you can see clearly as the shadows surrounding the shadowy figure are also taking away the sound.
“Does Hound actually mean anything?” Molly questioned curiously. Not that she didn’t believe Sherlock, she just couldn’t understand why it would be so important.
“A case he had taken,” Lestrade answered with a shrug.
John, Molly, Mrs Hudson, Mycroft, Lestrade and Anderson all glare at the Mycroft on screen and off. The two Yarders now believing that Sherlock was innocent.
"Repulsive," Kitty hissed, Donavan humming in agreement whilst everyone else glares at the two.
“Holly shit,” Anderson speaks up in shock. “When the hell did she get there?” He added, and no one responded, everyone but Moriarty and Mycroft still shocked that she was there.
A few people snort at that. Chuckling even more when John grumbles under his breath at the screen.
"That doesn’t always mean something bad,” Donovan can’t help but point out.
A few people cringe at Sherlock accidentally insulting Jeanette, feeling sorry for the poor girl.
Glancing backwards, John glares towards Moriarty, bringing everyone's attention to the man's smirk.
'Slaughter!' He grimaced again, seeming to observe his entire disarray for the first time. 'Yes, there was slaughterman's work last night. You are right, forgive me, Holmes; I am in no fit case to sit at table. But let me at least have some coffee here by the fire or I shall sleep where I stand. Then I shall bathe, and we will go to it.'
‘Yes,’ I said. I could not repress my love for him as I met his eye, and wondered if he saw it. Certainly his gaze met mine with a quiet trust and affection that was wholly beautiful. ‘You are right, Watson. Small kindnesses, but they weigh heavy in the scale against evil. You are right, it is not all dark.’
‘To leave Baker Street.’
He laughed, a little self-consciously, I thought. ‘I – well, I wanted just to . . . it is only a small thing, Holmes. I do – I do love to choose gifts for people I  lo – well, for my friends, and I have not many to lavish them upon.’
(This book – and tedious enough it was - had been recommended to me by my brother (I think partly in a spirit of mischief, for he always purported to think me an anarchist) and I had perused it with some interest, but more dissent, I believe, than he would ever have expected. Few of the Fellowship had read it in the original. Had they been aware of the full import of Marx’s political theories, they would have shunned him as they would shun a leper: for all that they discussed the formation of new colonies in which everything would be held in common, had they actually been required to put this into practice, the air would have filled with cries of outraged privilege. Nor would they have recognised in themselves the slaves of Capital: they saw themselves as liberators, and were unconscious of their own chains.)

‘To have them, no; I freely confess that beauty moves me. To express them immodestly and immoderately as he does, yes, it is weakness - and foolishness into the bargain. Wilde courts adulation and obloquy in equal measure, it seems. And it is his personal flamboyance that they parody, not just Aestheticism itself. I do not like mockery, Holmes, so I pray you will excuse me from attending. And I am not in spirits for comedy, to be truthful with you. The newspapers report that a cessation of hostilities in Afghanistan is imminent, and I am anxious about the fate of my regiment, and the men I knew.’
So engaged was he in the subject they had been discussing - it was always easy to engage his interest when there was a question of the welfare of children, my dear, tender-hearted John - that I had almost expected him to continue the conversation he had had with Miss Morstan and Mrs Forrester as we took our cab home, but no sooner had the doors closed upon us that he turned to me.
We rambled through London. My arm was within his, and he was in merry humour now, certain that I neither laughed nor scorned him. Every grimy denizen of the city that we came across as we wandered thro’ the charter’d streets, every shabby figure lurking at shadowed corner or crouched in foetid alley was offered coin; told to “Run and find a baker’s, my child, or go to the pie-shop, and get yourself something to eat.”  Several were bidden present themselves at the free ward of Barts on the morrow. “Ask for Dr Watson, and be sure to be there.”
‘Don’t damn me. I promise I won’t vomit in your hat. I won’t do anything you don’t like. But please don’t damn me. I might already be damned: don’t make it worse.’
is my response. Oh, where the devil is my hat?’
‘Cannot you so, my dear? Then I must tell you myself, it seems. You see, I have a very dear friend with whom I live, and who is a brother to me in all but name, and we go on more than tolerably together, having a good deal of fun, to tell the truth, such as I have not had since I was a boy, and perhaps not even as a boy – give me your wrist, Holmes: I wish to check your pulse. There, that is calming a little now.’
