“You are not allowed to laugh.” Sherlock raised one hand and a finger to point at John, seriously.
John would like to say he did the smart thing and asked what in bloody hell Sherlock was going on about. Yes, that would have been the smart thing to do in this sort of situation. Specially after spending the last hour in near complete ignorance of exactly what he was getting into.
“That was absolutely
John continued, and so did Sherlock.
John still cringed, expecting to be long gone from this plane of existence after the woman had pointed the gun at him. Instead, he was left squinting one eye open and noticing her casually looking down at the gun before shrugging her shoulders. Lowering a hand to her pocket, she pulled out a small clip that she inserted into the butt of the gun with a metallic click that seemed to echo quietly into the stone around them.
He’d totally forgotten in his sudden fury that Sherlock had been in contact with the man at the time.
“Well, what about a flatshare, huh?” Mike shrugged. “Something like that?”
The music didn't draw John from his half-slumber at first, but Sherlock knew it would only take a few minutes of the tone to slowly bring John around, and eventually, it did.
John rolled his eyes, but decided to play along, and reached to take the fork with his free right hand. Before he even had a chance to grab it, sparks flew from the tips of his nails and into the fork itself.
“Quiet!” John grumbled back at her, before finding an out-of-the-way door. Yanking it open at just the right moment when a pistol shot sounded from down the hallway they had just came, making him stop and stare down the area with a worried expression. Shaking his head, John yanked the Familiar lady into the room he’d just opened.
Sherlock scowled silently, seeming to ponder the situation before suddenly turning to John in that flutter of his coat. Instead of the rant John figured he was about to receive, John suddenly found his head being cradled between large palms, fingertips barely brushing the hair at his temples as Sherlock leaned in close.
” and all.” John paused to air quote that particular word with distaste.
Coming soon!: Cover art! Yay!
air. Lifting the phone back up, his fingers slowly clenched even tighter around the small pink phone, before very slowly opening his hand entirely where all five fingers were completely spread, leaving the phone itself to lay open across his palm. Both ears atop his head had fully arisen and were peaked towards the tiny machine, while both his eyes grew larger.
” Did John just say that? Correct again, that was him.
John quickly rose up out of his chair and bound over their small table to look over the fallen couch at his friend.
“What? Oh, so you did not see the shooter?”
“Would that bother you?” A small pause, and sarcastic smirk to add to it. “Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other, don't you think?”
“But, all that aside! I’m glad you could make it over. We’ve had a break-in.” Sebastian was not missing a beat, hopping up from his seat and motioning for the two of them to follow.
“Mind explaining
“A name!
John didn't notice it at first, he was still biting back the pain as it slowly dimmed back down to a manageable level. Giving a small shake to his head he let his arm lower and found himself looking at the nurse that had appeared. The two of them looked at each other as if deer, both caught in each others different headlights. It was John though that broke the tension and looked around to the white medical equipment, the IV that was strangely pulled as far away from him as possible with a long cord of clear plastic before it creeped into his arm. The softly beeping heart monitor, also pulled to the far side of the room, yet he seemed to still be attached with the cords running under his gown to his chest, it was all familiar to him as far as equipment but…
“An interested party.”
With the hand that had been subconsciously rubbing at his knee, John swished out his fingers and motioned to his body while closing his eyes and lifting his shoulder in a half mimicked shrug of Mike’s own.
On obtaining the letter opener from John, Sherlock swiftly sliced through the top portion of the paper material, and before Lestrade or John could warn him further, emptied the contents into his palm.
Snatching his right hand back from the window he lifted it to his mouth, and used his teeth to rip off the leather glove. Once the glove was ripped off, John switched the gun to his right hand. He barely even registered the arches of white electricity that instantly latched onto the metal like a long-lost lover, caressing. Was there any pain? John was far from feeling it.
“Quite. Sherlock, what has got you in such a pout?” Mrs. Hudson was quick to follow up, with just as much disapprovement in her tone as John, crossing her arms over her chest and looking the perfect mother figure.
“I prefer texting.”
” Sherlock angrily raised his voice back. Too bad that answer was filled with too many words for John to make out clearly, regardless of the raised voice.
“It was
“Do you remember it?!”
“Um. Thanks.” John cut through their silence, reaching up with a free gloved hand to scrub his fingers at the base of his neck. “I guess I needed that.”
“W..heh..W-wait, Sherlock!” John tried getting up out of chair only to find that the laughing had caused him to nearly stumble, where he had to brace himself for a moment before following after the retreating black feline, calling down the hallway.
“I would believe him, if I were you.” Sang a low baritone amongst the shadowed stone.
a wanker. You could have deduced him into shreds, I'm sure of it.”
“I am teaching now, you know.” Mike responded. “Young, bright little things they are. Remember? Like we used to be.” A strong laugh was added in at this point. “I hate them so much!”
“Oh! I wasn’t. I mean…” Stumbled John at having been caught. The last thing John needed was another Familiar that thought he was racist.
?! Bloody unlikely!”Lestrade exclaimed, loudly.
“A row...with a machine.” Sherlock raised a brow.
John raised a hand and slowly ran it back through his hair with a low groan of frustration. Taking a slow, deep breath, he closed his eyes and took a few seconds to try to compose himself. Slowly breathe in, slowly breathe out, repeat.
Instead, he was sitting there was his teeth clenched. The light touches that John was giving to the muscles attached to his ears actually felt
Black short, yet fluffy, fur covered the entire smaller feline that sat elegantly as possible on the couch. A rounded skull with the small black ears atop it, and a very slightly squished in little nose between fluffy cheeks adorned with the usual whiskers.
“Where did the fork go?”
“Sherlock.” John frowned in his direction.
Sherlock let out the
“This is a bad idea…” John muttered, even as he reached for the utensil in Sherlock’s hand, which if anyone would care to add, was holding onto the metal utensil without any protection what-so-ever.
“Sherlock, what…”
John half lifted himself up out of his chair so he could lean forwards and take a closer look at the envelope in question. Across the front of the envelope, was very clearly written ‘Sherlock Holmes’ in a spiraled elegant handwriting.
It seemed only seconds that John had to himself in his restful pose before Sherlock softly shook his shoulder, and then opened the door to slide out onto the sidewalk. Their new cab driver was looking back at John expectantly and without much thought John handed over their fair and scooted himself out of the vehicle.
Luckily, no one had been hurt in the explosion outside. A number of different windows on the street had been completely destroyed, and that included their own. That had been the worst of the ordeal for the most part. Mrs. Hudson had been in their doorway, and was clear of the glass blast that while having hit Sherlock and John, had only left them with a scrape or two, mostly from having been thrown from their feet.
“....Okay.” John said quietly. What in hell was he thinking?
“You mentioned trust, John.” Sherlock held out the fork in his direction even further. “I already know you are not going to hurt me.”
John ended up blinking, again, to his frustration. Looking down to his leg he shuffled it closer to his body with a shift of his cane, attempting to come up with a proper reply to the man’s description. His quite amazingly accurate, description.
It looked like yellow spray paint. The kind that most kids would be seen with in some dark alley way, spreading whatever graffiti came to mind in their particular art form. What might have been a number eight at some point had it’s top forgotten about, and Sherlock was letting his fingers trail over the horizontal line that cut across the top of it. Following the horizontal line was a second one, though this one had been sprayed directly over Sir William’s eyes. Sherlock’s hand moved up and over, trailing down one of the drip lines that fell from the odd blindfold the portrait had been given, after he snatched his phone from his pocket, and was quickly taking pictures, acting as if he was the only person within the room.
A bond normally shows both individuals involved to exhibit a burst to their natural strengths when together. A physical relationship between a Familiar and its owner is seen as taboo, and looked upon with scorn. Once a Familiar has found their ‘master’, they are unable to leave them, nor find another, and are still subject to direct orders. They still retain their ability to switch between their more human form, and their animal aspect at free will. Telepathy is still available, though only to their master, whom also can still block this ability if they decide to.
Its been a long time coming this scene of mine in my head...I only hope the time that you spent here, was enjoyed. Thank you again, dear readers. Much love, as always. <3
Only then did her hear John’s muffled giggling.
Slowly, Sherlock turned his head towards his flatmat to find John covering his mouth with his un-gloved hand, holding back his snickers as if his life depended on it. It very well might be, considering one thing Sherlock hated was to be laughed at.
“I am calculating the amount of hair growth on the human skin after death, depending on the age and health of the deceased, and to see if the types of death would have any adding factors of change.”
Pulling a flashlight he was lucky enough to have remembered earlier when they’d been at their flat, he flashed the light around the area. Nothing really special to have been found, until the barest drops of yellow glared into the frame of his light, causing him to pause. Squinting, John slowly followed the line of drops till he came across a brick wall. Not even noticing that he’d left Sherlock behind, slowly stepped closer and flared his light upwards.
“Seriously Sherlock, can you please not keep doing this to me?” Said in a tone that he had attempted to not try and sound as annoyed as he felt.
John couldn't help but let out a small tired huff of a laugh, it had been such a long day…
“The wall had it coming.”
John brought a hand up to his face to slowly run it down with a groan. All he had wanted to do was have a nice day in, blog a bit, a nice warm cup of tea….
” The man emphasized the word in a surprised tone, turning to John, sticking out his hand for a more formal shake. John decided to give the weasley looking fellow a rather stronger shake, an extra squeeze in slight intimidation, causing Sebastian’s brow to raise slightly at the firmer touch.
“Angelo,” Sherlock quickly interrupted, having already placed himself into his own seat and was relieving himself of his coat only barely, letting the top half drape over the back of his seat. “If you would be so kind.” He gave the man a smile that actually looked genuine. John wasn't so sure though.
Soo Lin’s body could barely be seen on top of a table placed more towards the back of the room, as if she had been delicately placed. Hair having fallen across her face that was now turned towards the door John stood in, hiding her last expression as well as her eyes. Both furry tipped ears holding way too still. One arm was left to hang off the side, the palm slightly left open to allow the placement of another dark ebony flower, framed amongst too-still fingertips in a death’s caress. A sliver of blood was already making its way down her pale arm towards the flower in a careful slow path.
With that said, Mycroft slowly nudged John out of the way with a mild touch to his shoulder, which left John with a quick shiver at the contact. Smoothly, Mycroft exited the room, and John was finally able to take a deeper breath once the door has closed behind him.
Turning back around he noticed the newspaper she had been holding, reaching to the table he grabbed it to find the article she had been mentioning to Sherlock. Tilting his head as he flipped through till finally stopping on a picture that obviously held the appearance of the man who had been in the flat prior with news for Sherlock. Looking at it closely he then took the time to browse down through the article itself, catching the name of D.I. Lestrade.
Exactly what he was looking for, he thought.
“You idiot. This is exactly why I didn't want to do this.” John was careful to hold out his other gloved hand to his friend to help him back up.
John looked at the floor for a moment, everything Sherlock had deduced was true enough but…
While pondering just how Mycroft had painted the room and have it dry in the span of half a day and night, John had moved to sit down onto his bed, toeing his shoes off and was about to work on the rest of his clothing when his hands brushed against the bed covering. Blinking, he twisted slightly in his seat to look at the bed itself.
I never considered myself a writer. Not really. And hell, reading back through a lot of this I see why!
…..What the bloody fucking adorable was that.
Walking through Bart’s was a little stroll down memory lane for John, even if it had been a few years since he had actually graced the old walls. There was something slightly comforting about the familiar building even though its minor changes, and when Mike knocked on the door to the laboratory John was very intent on browsing around at both the new and old equipment the room provided to add to his older memories of the room itself.
“Any good?” A head tilt forced those curls to the side again in much the same manner that John had seen before when he had first met Sherlock at Bart’s. Though now the ears were perked forwards with a slight quiver in a much more interested manner then they had been before.
Sherlock simply waggled the fork mid-air, in a ‘hurry-up’ expression.
“Thank you, Angelo.” Sherlock replied in a simple manner to the last statement, ignoring it entirely. Angelo gave Sherlock a quick wink and was just as suddenly darting away from their table back to his kitchens, John guessed.
“Make that four, Mrs. Hudson.” Sherlock was currently looking down at the street through the window, having stopped his trivial dusting to study the street.
“Obvious.” Sherlock answered back.
Suddenly, John wasn't so tired anymore.
Sherlock didn't give whomever was inside a chance to answer, and simply opened the door and headed inside, leaving a slightly unnerved John in the hallway.
“The what?” John asked to no one, and nothing, in particular.
“You could tell me.” The man’s gaze seemed to sweep downwards towards John’s crossed arms. “I imagine people have already warned you to stay away from him, though I do not see that being a problem with your history.”
Oddly enough, John observed, Sherlock was doing very little to argue this man’s audacity. Confused, he looked over to his flatmate and found that Sherlock seemed to not even be paying attention. The Familiar was currently looking towards the floor, and partially to the side of the room, as if he was having little to do with the conversation. Something about this, along with Sebastian’s better-than-thou attitude, was doing little to keep John’s usual anger in check. Sherlock should have been cutting into this annoying little wanker with his brilliancy by now.
date?” Sherlock asked, almost seeming sincere with wide eyes.
Only then did John notice exactly why Sherlock had been stalling. The turning motion that was produced to send him into the living room gave John a full broad on look as a long black tail was uncoiled from Sherlock’s waist, flinging out in furry ‘tuffed glory as it also seemed to need a stretch. John was left wide eyed, even as Sherlock moved out of view once he had flopped onto the couch. Well, almost out of view. That tail draped over the back end of the couch, the tip twitching back and forth.
John had already known about the ears. That was fine. But apparently the man also had a
All three of them, two Familiars and one Magic User, leaned slowly forwards when Sherlock clicked for the message to open, and clicking on it’s speaker function after.
“I still want to see, it is only fair.”
John did have a very brief thought that the EOAA, Equal Opportunities for All Act, might have something to do with it. Sarah couldn't have completely refused him a job that his Magical Awareness would not have been a factor against him. John shrugged a mental shoulder in thought, either or. Not that he would have fought her against it if she had decided on the other turnabout excuse. A job was a job, and John was happy to have one.
“I’m fine.” Sherlock croaked out again, though more strongly this time in what was an obvious attempt to sound better than he actually was. “Come John, we are headed to the Museum.” With that said, the detective practically pulled away from John as quickly as he could, and was already getting a cab to pull over for them.
“The correct word you are looking for is melanistic of the panthera genus. But you are wrong on both accounts.” Sherlock was quick to mention as was his usual when correcting someone, but the expression was still one of slight caution when John glanced back to him.
John sighed, lowering his tone even further.
Sherlock opened the door for John, jerking a thumb inside the cab to indicate he should get in.
In that miraculous movement where he was suddenly in Sebastian's personal space, he caused both men to blink and slightly startle in surprise. Narrowing his eyes, he softly snarled.
!” John raised his voice slightly too loud, causing the back members of the small audience to turn and hiss out whispered “
“On one condition.”
But Mrs. Hudson was in league with Sherlock’s deafness as she completely ignored the soured look and reached over to softly pat John’s shoulder with the undeterred smile while placing her newspaper on the table in front of him.
“And he was a bloody awful cabbie.” John added in.
“Sherlock…”
It didn't keep him from muttering a silent curse over at the doorway though, he still had his left hand gloved at least, like
Next thing John knew, they were being ushered to a table by a large, very enthusiastic Italian man.
“Two spoonfuls.” Sherlock, again.
Ella, his psychotherapist slash magical awareness Councillor, sat partially to the front and left side of him in that overly large chair of hers. A yellow notebook lay across her crossed legs lap while she idly tapped a pen to softly rasp against the fibers of the paper.
“Um, actually.” John mentioned, catching a curious glance from Sherlock as he did. “I really should go by my flat at least. I could really use a change of clothes.”
“I really wish you two would make up your bloody minds…” He’d mutter under his breath before hitting the car’s signal switch to move into the side lane.
John blinked at her accusation, but was quickly to cover himself with a small returning, and none-the-less practiced smile.
sound of one body hitting the floor hard, and the other to have landed comfortably atop the other.
“So...Coffee?”
Sherlock couldn't help giving John one of his all-knowing smirks.
Finally he could reach for his cane, and with his stronger right arm holding most of his body’s weight he pushed himself to his feet and hobbled over to the one window he had. With his free hand he lifted away the curtain from the glass so he could peer out at the city, mentally letting the image wash over his thoughts of all the
above all that.” John gave a chuckle of his own, darkly.
“We did not anticipate…”
“So, uh...I looked your name up on the internet last night.”
Sherlock quickly whipped his tail away from his eyes and glared at John.
John didn't even get the chance to lift his arm before he was being sent backwards onto his arse, then shoulder first into the sand. The pain didn't register at first, per the usual, but while John was looking up at the hazy blue sky he knew it was coming.  What he didn't know, was how electric the feeling would be as his shoulder pulsed out his life blood and he felt his muscles constrict in both a wave of said pain, and another injection of adrenalin into his bloodstream. A blood stream that was quickly beginning to cover the sand to his side and back in a warmth that did not even remotely compare to the heat of the sand under him.
John raised his eyebrows at the rough sounding tone, scratchier than he remembered the Familiar’s voice being. He leaned over and reached further down to help Sherlock get to his feet. Subdued in realizing he must have squashed the starting point of Sherlock’s tail when they fell.
“I’m a consulting detective. Only one in the world.” Sherlock corrected while he continued to look out the window, but eventually in his pause he’d turn his gaze towards his companion. “I invented the job.”
"Been better."
"Not all of it's your fault, Sherlock. Not even most of it."
John smiles down from his place in the bed at him, "Alright. Here, let me," John let's go of Sherlock's hand to help him shift himself over on the bed. Mid-shift he releases a breath that prompts Sherlock to say, "Be careful." John pauses to look at him with a smile, "I'm okay. Come on."
"Have a look they're all listed."
"Then what!? What's happening here!? If you're not interested in apologies or explanations, what are you are you here for, Sherlock!? I don't know- I don't know what- God dammit!"
"Sherlock?... Oh, Sherlock. Are you alright?"
"Time?"
"Fine, thank you. How is he?" Sherlock nods his head in the direction of John, who is completely still, frozen except for the rise and fall of his chest.
Sherlock hangs up before Mrs. Hudson can find another way to decline his request. She needs to see John, and Sherlock's not leaving until John wakes up. Sherlock owes it to him; it's the least he can do.
"Sher-"
"Yeah, she is isn't she.... He's been here every day?"
Whoever John had been talking to a moment ago was gone, he'd been replaced by terse, clipped Sherlock.
"Because you're the only one, Sherlock. You're the only one who can get through to him. You're the only one who truly knows John Watson."
"No. You're not allowed to do that."
"Okay, how long will that take?"
"Three-seventy-eight. Want me to take you?"
"Alright, that's everything! Dr. Wallace and Dr. Andrews should be in later to check up. You just rest now. No need to over-do it when you're just getting better."
"Oh, Sherlock. I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?"
"Nothing! I'm just agreeing. Have you called his sister?"
"How long's he been like that?"
"You say that to me as if I were a child," Sherlock snips back, grabbing the food from Lestrade.
"Ok."
"Me too."
"Good God, you're incessant." Sherlock grumbles as he steps through the door into the hallway. There's a few nurses minding about but otherwise the floor is relatively quiet.
"What? I thought you guys worked it out?"
Once again, Sherlock remains silent.
"John! They're here, they're here to help you—"
"—and I will be be back later in the evening. He really is a miracle patient you know, and I don't believe in miracles. Good day, Mr. Holmes."
Sherlock just looks at him. He's filled with anger, anger because he knows Mycroft is right and he hates that. He hates that Mycroft knows.
"You and Molly Hooper are in agreement; she told me that earlier. I really won't be long, there's no need to—"
"I do hope John will be alright. For his sake, and yours."
John's mouth responds before his brain can catch up with it, and it's not until it's out that John realizes what he said.
"Not really?"
"Sherlock."
"Mm, please do. I could use the distraction."
"Hey. How are you holding up?" she says in nearly a whisper.
God, Sherlock doesn't know how to be alone anymore. He
"You said some things..."
Sherlock's a complete idiot. What is he doing? What is he doing here? He has no right to be. He, he, he... he got Mary killed. His friend, Mary. Rosie's mother, Mary. John's wife, Mary. Mary, who despite everything, all her misgivings, loved John. Loved Sherlock. Knew Sherlock. Knew him well enough to know why Sherlock made no attempt to see John after the two of them got married. Knew why Sherlock is in this hospital room right now. Knew all of it, and still loved him.
Sherlock nods.
"I appreciate your concern Molly, but someone has to stay here with John."
"Oh yes of course. One of the doctors will be with him at all times to make sure nothing causes the swelling to increase."
Sherlock scans her body for signs indicating her reason for being here.
Rosie only makes garbled noises in reply and Sherlock continues bouncing her lightly, swooping around the room while stroking her head softly. As Sherlock floats around the flat, Rosie begins to calm down and only the sound of Sherlock's movements fill the flat.
"I said you're not allowed to do that, Sherlock. We're all worried for John here, and we can't afford to be worried about you too. What am I saying, we're always worried about you. You will go home and sleep. The doctors will be fine here without your hovering all the time!"
"Can we just get started on the cases?" Sherlock says emotionless, eyes aimed at the floor.
"He has a few expressed wishes but Mr. Watson's records have you listed as his power of attorney."
John lets out a little huff, "Yeah, me too. Mycroft left?"
"Not quite."
This isn't fair. John has saved Sherlock countless times over: When Sherlock had no one, John moved in with him. When Sherlock doubted himself, John only saw reality. When Sherlock was being torn down by the public, John believed in him irrevocably. And now? John is lying in a hospital bed as a reward.
"John! JOHN!"
All he kept thinking is that if he lost John he'd lose... God he'd lose-
The driver nods and continues to stare ahead. When Stella walks out the door she's already put Rosie in the car seat, all buckled and ready.
make a difference, Sherlock. And now you're shutting him out, of all people. Don't, Sherlock, let him in. Let John in."
"You said as much."
"How would you know what John is feeling? You're the Ice Man, you don't even feel yourse-"
Sherlock sighs and runs his hands over his face. He was right, like he always is, stress can ruin everyday of your life. When Sherlock glances at his watch it reads half-past-three. If Rosie is still on the same nap schedule as... as before, then she'll just be waking up from her afternoon nap. Perhaps Mrs. Hudson could bring her by. That would be nice. It would be good for Mrs. Hudson to see John too. Sherlock rings her and when she answers he's greeted with a cacophony of noises.
"Thank—" Sherlock starts. "You first."
Mrs. Hudson is right; she has a point. What was Sherlock thinking? But Sherlock can't be alone right now, he can't deny it. And Mrs. Hudson should come see John, even though Sherlock can tell she's afraid too.
"You never do. John is in surgery and when he gets out he will be in recovery,
"Oh, well, I guess I could. I'll pack up some things and come. Do you need anything dear?"
to you. How much of that you can you recall?"
"You alright?" is what John decides to start with.
He nods, "Yes. Night."
"Well then, solved it. Next."
You... Mrs. Hudson says you keep me out of trouble. I guess she's right in a way. Huh, it's pathetic isn't it. You try and keep me out of trouble and all I do is drag you into it. I'm not good for you. Or Rosie for that matter. So, if you wake up, I promise I'll- I promise I'll leave you be. You and Rosie deserve better.
"Sir, we're here to help. We're taking your friend to the hospital. Can you tell us what happened?"
... ... ...
Another sigh, "I would like to discuss these matters with you."
John's heart is pounding. He doesn't think Sherlock will see it the wrong way, but is there a wrong way? Isn't that what John wants? To have Sherlock sleep next to him?
"Sherlock!"
"Well, considering the extent of his injury, he's recovering quite well. As of early this morning his swelling has gone down forty-five percent. We expect another forty percent by tomorrow, best case scenario, this evening. When the swelling has gone down eighty- seven to ninety percent we will begin to slowly wean him off the morphine and other anesthetics. Then, by the time he wakes up, if there are no intervening circumstances, there will only be around ten to fifteen percent cranial swelling left. At that point, we can administer medication to help speed the healing process up. Overall, Mr. Watson's recovery is going very well, if we stick to the plan he could be awake in a matter of days. He may have to stay for precautionary purposes a few days more. You must know how extremely lucky you are."
-he was
"Sir! Sir!"
Sherlock can feel the exhaustion pulling at him again. How nice it would be to give in to it. Tomorrow will definitely be long. He knows that John's swelling could (best case scenario) be decreasing by tomorrow. John will still be in the hospital for a while though. More separation.
"Well. I need new clothes. Mine are covered in blood and people won't stop staring, not that it bothers me, it's just annoying. As much as I wish to stay for the next hour and a half, I cannot allow you to choose clothes for me."
alright? You're friend is being treated. There's blood on you."
"What?"
"Isn't everyone. Don't you have a floor full of bustling do-gooders to get back to?"
"Yes, I think I'll be able to manage. Good night, thank you."
"Sherlock, that's not what's going on, you only got back into the drugs to—"
More silence.
Snapping out of it, he calls Molly. She picks up on the first ring.
"SHERLOCK! Oh god, what's happened!? I heard from Lestrade! John's injured! Oh god is it fatal!? Sherlock what has happened? Are you alright!? Please! Tell me how you're feeling, what are you thinking!? Are you hurt!? Is John still in—"
"Sherlock."
BAM! The gun fires. Glass shatters. John recoils down to the floor. He hits the wood floor hard, his head bouncing before falling still. Everything around John becomes slightly muffled. The noises, his vision. The pain is too much. He is already slipping away. Everything is getting hazy...
Mycroft inserts the thumbnail and hits a few keys before passing the laptop to John, who sets in on his lap. The two other men each take either side of John's bed, all staring at the screen. John's looking at a freeze frame of him sitting down while the mysterious woman is locking the door. He clicks play and he's met with the voice. The smooth, languid voice that taunted him with dangled bits of information that day. How she was not only Faith Smith, but the lady on the bus too. How she had pinpointed both their weaknesses and exploited them.
Stella pulls Sherlock aside for just a few moments and quietly whispers, "Give John my best, will you? I'm so sorry. I know you two were... close."
"Yes, I suppose it is," Sherlock can't help but give a little smile in Mrs. Hudson direction.
"I could have prevented it."
Sherlock speaks again. His words come quickly, strained, "You recovered quite fast. Faster than they had seen before."
The doctor understands, "Yes, 'but'. Even after we repair the tissue there will still be cranial swelling. Once he's out of surgery we'll be putting him into a medically induced coma so nothing can hinder the swelling from going down."
"I'd like to see it, Sherlock. Let him play it."
"I'm not following, what would like me to do?"
Sherlock steeples his hands, noticing the very slight tremor that still remains in them.
"I guess that's true," John pauses, a small smile quivering at the corner of his mouth, "But if I have learned anything by being friends with you, it's that things aren't always what you expect," he lets out a small chuckle. Sherlock even lets the smallest of smiles creep onto his lips.
Sherlock plays a few more songs and Lestrade arrives just as Sherlock is putting away his violin.
The female doctor begins again, sliding her pen down what seems to be a list. "His side effects could include immobility, confusion, delirium, reduced muscle tone and de-conditioning, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and nightmares."
"Are you sure you don't want to do it?"
Mrs. Hudson stayed home with Rosie as expected. She was already up when Sherlock dropped Rosie off downstairs at six in the morning. She nearly shoved Sherlock out of the flat so she and Rosie could have some "much needed quality godmother-goddaughter time," whatever that meant.
"Uh, yeah. Yeah. Right before she, you know," John gestures to his head, "she said she was your sister."
"Sherlock."
Sherlock swallows and sits up taller, pulling his jacket straight. He must have forgotten to take it off since the wrinkles it formed in the night are making appearances down the front. He forms the word slowly and it's come out quiet and on an exhale,
"I don't know how to fix us."
"Oh, and before I forget, Dr. Wallace and Dr. Andrews are coming around four to take him for a CT scan to check the percentage of cranial swelling."
"I can't help but think contrary to that."
The leather squishes as Sherlock stands. Little mumbles come from Rosie as he lays her down, she really is a noisy sleeper.
"I mean, when are you going to go home? When are you going to change, brush your teeth, sleep even!"
"He has good reason to."
"Sherlock!" Mycroft answers in a tone too loud for the quiet hallway, making Sherlock glance around for people who might be watching, "Stop shutting everyone out! I've let you get away with it for too long. You stopped talking to me a long time ago and that's fine. But not him, I won't let you do that. I thought John had made a difference. He
Sherlock's mind is back to panicking. He can't help but feel this is all his fault.
The hospital's loudspeakers crack on and Sherlock hears a familiar, clearly annoyed voice. His eyes flick up to the direction of the loudspeaker.
Sherlock let's out a breath, "Alright. When will you be out again?"
Sherlock has people. Friends. Right, he has friends? There's Lestrade. Molly. Mrs. Hudson's more like family, and John... well he has John too. Or, at least he
It isn't until seven until the very last person leaves the room. People were constantly shuffling in and out, adding new settings on the monitors, checking John's pulse. But finally, Dr. Andrews came in for one last overview and no one has been back since.
"Martha, pleased to meet you dear. And this is Rosie, John's daughter," she shows off the baby on her hip proudly.
"Consider me on my way."
"Yes, everything's fine, I was wondering if you might bring Rosie by?"
That's all Mrs. Hudson needs, just a 'no' and she's crossing the room and tucking Sherlock's head into her side. "It'll be alright. You two always are."
After a while, a nurse comes in and Sherlock let's her make her rounds with all the machines. After about a minute the nurse speaks, "He can hear you, you know."
Sherlock stares at floor, and then down the hallway, and then at the door for a few minutes, wanting to go back in but unable to move his feet. When he finally does he slips in, shutting the door quietly and awkwardly standing in the doorway. John watches him intently. He's trying to find out what's going to happen next.
"Thank you, Molly."
"There you go. Now, let's try our luck at getting you wrapped up, shall we?"
"Yes, the brain will most likely experience residual trauma mentally. Mr. Watson could quite possibly experience a few nightmares."
Sherlock tries his best to secure another blanket around Rosie, making sure she'll be comfortable all night.
"Perfect, glad you feel the same. I trust you've already told Sherlock all you know."
"Sherlock. In the hall, please," this time holding the door open to Sherlock and motioning for him to step out.
"I'm okay, Sherlock. I'm okay now."
"We can discuss the information you have to share when John is out of surgery, awake, and capable of understanding you, incessant page."
"It's really no problem. I got everything on the list. The underwear was a bit awkward, but I have everything you asked for. What about you?"
He feels light headed and out of breath, he pinches his nose. His breathing is coming too quickly and his lungs feel too weak to catch up.
His phone buzzes. It's another text from Molly. Sherlock switches his phone off and puts it back in his shirt pocket. He has no interest in rehashing this afternoon's events, let alone "share his feelings" as Molly would say, and probably wants him to do.
, talking."
"What? What are you getting on about?"
"You think you know more than we do?"
Dr. Wallace begins, "They've been recently changed, Mr. Holmes. From a..." he flips some papers back on his clipboard, "from a... Mrs. Mary Watson to a Mr. Sherlock Holmes."
Sherlock presses this time.
A quick glance at the aforementioned precedes a, "Sort of, um, she pulled a gun and, uh-"
"That's right.... quiet Little Watson—"
Sherlock likes this nurse. She not overly talkative, but not annoyingly quiet either. "Thank you."
The nurse pulls the door shut with a thump.
Sherlock breaks his gaze and meets the young woman's eyes. His eyebrows furrow.
"You're not wrong. But really, I'm okay now. You can stop worrying. I'll be up and at 'em before you know it."
"I'll just go get John's things then. Do you know what you want to me to get?"
"Oh, no Mr. Holmes. The CT scan gave us the confidence that he'll be able to breathe independently going forward. No need to worry," butts in Dr. Andrews before the poor nurse even had a chance to open her mouth.
If only John could hear him, really hear him. Everything he's meant to say but never has. Sherlock reaches up and lays his hand next to John's. The two hands don't make contact, but Sherlock keeps his hand there, only feeling the phantom pull between each finger. His mouth begins to form words, but instead Sherlock gets up and grabs his violin and begins to play Bach. He floats around the room while playing the melody. John always liked this one, at least Sherlock thought he did. Every time Sherlock played this piece John would always say something along the lines of, 'That was nice, who is that?' He never seemed to remember it was the same song. Sherlock finishes the tune with his eyes on John; a silent dedication.
"Alright."
"What do you mean, 'what about me'?" Sherlock crosses the room and begins rummaging through the takeout bag.
"One moment. We have one more passenger."
"Goodnight, Molly."
"I'll just have the hospital give me a toothbrush, Bill bring me the clothes I ask of him, and sleeping won't be necessary," explains Sherlock. He's opening up Chow Mein now; he's hungrier than he thought.
"No, I'll be fine."
The corner of John's mouth raises in a tiny smile. It's tiny, barely there. It's odd seeing Sherlock asleep. He looks so much more peaceful, unlike himself, so calm. He's almost never sleeps this late, it's almost eight. John started waking up around six, and then around seven he was fully conscious. He would've called a nurse but he didn't want to wake Sherlock. Sherlock always needed sleep, and John found Sherlock's silent presence... he couldn't quite put a word to it.
"Rosie's car seat. You'll be needing that if you're taking her anywhere."
"Pleasure to meet you, now–"
"I said turn it off!" Sherlock slams his laptop shut so hard he could have broken it. He snatches it up from John's lap and walks it back over to the other side of the room, nearly tossing it onto the table. Sherlock doesn't turn back around, John can only see his shoulders moving with each deep breath breath.
Chuckles from both men ensue. It's the first time Sherlock's genuinely smiled in a while. A genuine smile where he's not being deceived or is doing the deceiving, a real smile between two friends.
"No, I'll stay overnight. Molly already made me leave last night. Says I'm too much of a worry while I'm here." He sighs staring not at John, but somewhat in a way as if he were looking beyond him. "John may not wish to see me when he wakes, but my brother will want to bombard John with information and only I can hold him off."
"Will he be given any medication for those side effects?"
"Time happened. We ran out of it."
Sherlock hasn't stood in front of this door in weeks. He can't bring himself to ring the doorbell. Or knock for that matter. Knocking would be best though, in case Rosie is asleep. Sherlock lifts his hand slowly and knocks quietly. Stella opens the door moments later.
"Everything is fine! Rosie and I are just enjoying some Queen!"
"John! John! Are you all right!? John!? JOHN!?"
When they arrive, Mrs. Hudson is overjoyed. The moment she saw the seat filled with Rosie in Sherlock's hands as he walked through the door, an irremovable smile formed upon her face. She fawned over Rosie until Sherlock said goodnight (or told her that Rosie needed to sleep and that she had to go).
"Nice to meet you, I'm Jodie, one of Mr. Watson's surgical nurses. I just wanted to let you know, that he's one of the strongest patients I've ever seen. There were some points in surgery where it seemed... well, where it seemed grim, but he never gave up. I just hope you know that, medically, I've never seen a patient so intent on recovering. His body is working at an alarmingly fast rate. But don't worry, it isn't unhealthy, nothing to stress more over."
"John..."
"That's not what she said."
"Alright! Here we are! She's a little sleepy so the car ride should be pretty quiet. I'll just set her car seat up. Why don't you watch," she sets Rosie and the car seat on the backseat and begins to demonstrate, "You clip in the buckle here and tighten the strap here. To take it out just unbuckle. That's all there is, simple enough."
"That's ridiculous, you just do it."
Sherlock's the smart one. Sherlock knows what 'happy' feels like. Sherlock has let emotion cloud his judgement before. Yes, things went poorly sometimes, but at least he felt. It had been so long since he 'felt' before. It's been even longer for Mycroft, and that's why Mycroft isn't the smart one. If it hadn't been for... well for emotion, Sherlock wouldn't have made it this far, he would have given up a long time ago. Mycroft doesn't feel. Regardless of his 'concern' for Sherlock, he has nothing. No friends. Christ, it's like he never even felt at all. What happened to them? What made this way? For once, Sherlock's tired of it.
No. Sherlock wasn't going to be silly. John was asleep and couldn't hear him. Nothing Sherlock were to say would matter. He'd just sit and wait for Mrs. Hudson to come back.
Molly's face drops and looks as if she wants to say more but her pager goes off and their conversation is ended. Molly excuses herself and promises she'll be back tomorrow, taking the egg rolls with her.
"Why have you called? If it isn't important it will have to wait; I'm busy sitting here surrounded by crying people who live mediocre lives to a low potential."
Sherlock whips his phone out and calls Molly, now standing. She picks up on the first ring.
The elevator dings open and Sherlock steps in, alone, pushing the button for level three. He pulls out his phone to text Molly his mental checklist. When the elevator doors open again Sherlock is met with a waft of sanitized air. He steps out of the elevator and dodges a oncoming gurney and heads straight in the direction John's room, following the signs. A few people give him sideways glances as he walks by; he should have brought that damn hat, as if that would have helped in this situation anyway.
will suffice as it is his name. But I believe it is the word 'friend' that you are looking for."
Lestrade makes an agreeing noise and dumps a bag on the small table already scattered with an assortment of Sherlock's things. "Sandwiches. And before you complain, you can just take what you don't like off of yours," Lestrade smirks as he hands Sherlock a wrapped sandwich.
"Are you daft? John is lying in a hospital bed after almost being shot to death! Do you think he's going to have even the faintest desire to see me when he wakes up? I could have prevented it! But no! I was high as a kite and couldn't figure out a stupid, bloody note! After everything I went through to get him to speak to me again? All that's worthless now!"
But his body doesn't listen and Sherlock turns so he can see Mrs. Hudson out of the corner of his eye, and all he utters is a single, broken, "No."
"Don't."
"Grey, can I ask you something?"
Lestrade appears disappointed out of the corner of Sherlock's eye. Everyone is in Sherlock these days. "Yeah, sure. Let me just... Here. This one's a death in the middle of an art gallery," he hands a case file to Sherlock, "Teresa Smith, twenty-seven years old. Collapsed dead at three-thirty-seven last Tuesday. Had no previous health issues. Doctors have ruled it as a heart attack. Foreign substances were found in her blood stream, don't know how it got there though."
"Well then. You make that look obvious."
"Good, that's good."
He shouldn't do it. He really shouldn't. But he does.
"I don't know how to talk to you anymore, Sherlock."
"I shouldn't of shut you out."
"Not really."
"Shhh.... that's a good girl," Sherlock strokes Rosie's head until she falls asleep, "Goodnight, Little Watson."
"It's not your fault you know. You'll understand that soon enough."
There's a slight pause and then, "I almost lost you."
"What's happened!?" cries Mrs. Hudson.
"I'm calling to check up on you. Isn't that what big brothers do?"
'There are things I need to say t-'
Mycroft's end of the line is quiet. Sherlock's counted to a measly thirty seconds before Mycroft speaks again.
When Sherlock enters the flat he heads straight to the bathroom. He throws his clothes straight into the garbage and turns on the shower. Sherlock makes a mental checklist of things John might need.
"In person. Shall I meet you at Baker Street?"
Sherlock is grateful; and with that he is out the door and hailing a cab back to the hospital.
Sherlock looks at him and then back to Mycroft. With the annoyance of being outnumbered exuding off of him, he gets up and grabs his laptop from the table by the door, giving Mycroft an evil glare as he unlocks it and shoves it into his chest, "Very well then."
"No, please. He's my friend."
"Oh, don't pretend you don't know who that is, young man. Is everything all right at the hospital?"
Sherlock hesitates before standing a bit and pulling his chair up to the bed. His knees bump the plastic side and his shins hit the edge. John let's his hand unfold in front of Sherlock. He raises his eyebrows a bit as he offers his next sentence.
"You're sure?"
Dr. Andrews appears taken back, but regains her composure and clears her throat, "Well, that would be up to you."
The doctors are still not aware of Sherlock's presence so he pulls his eyes from John and clears this throat. The doctors all turn to face him and a nurse looks up from from a monitor.
"No!"
Sherlock grabs his laptop and charger and plugs everything in. The laptop whirs to life and Sherlock types, "verbal communication with comatose patients" into the search box, making sure to run a few filters so he only receives reliable sources. He clicks on one done by a doctor in Sweden, quickly skimming it to see if it's worth his time. It says two-hundred pages and this doctor has ample evidence listed, so Sherlock might as well read this one.
For those who don't remember, Bill Wiggins  (referred to as just'Bill' in the chapter) is Sherlock's self proclaimed 'protégé.' He makes appearances in His Last Vow and The Lying Detective.
"No, it isn't. Let me get your coat."
A deafening silence rings between them, and this time, there is no ventilator to fill it.
"We can talk about it if you want, the whole sister thing," John offers.
"I don't understand, what are you saying?"
"Thank you, Mycroft."
"We believe there's a very good—"
Something hits the floor. Something small has fallen from between the closed laptop. The glint from the light on it catches Sherlock's eye. He knows what it is before he's even bending down to get it. Mary's wedding ring. So new, almost no scratches. Clearly always being held by a intoxicated John, judging by the residual alcohol stains and finger oils on the band.
"No."
"I'm sorry?"
"—quietly."
Sherlock shrugs and pauses, "Obvious isn't it? Even you could deduce that."
Lestrade gathers up his things and quickly exits the room.
How much did John hear? Sherlock lost control of what he was saying when he found John. The words just came out. He was so scared he was going to lose John then and there he, he-
Another paramedic, "Sir. Sir! Are
Sherlock scoffs.
"Right, thanks."
John half expected that. He half wanted Sherlock to just say it, whatever he isn't saying. It makes it so much more hard to be mad at him. He seems almost as broken as John feels. His thoughts are interrupted when Sherlock calls his name.
.” Sherlock growled back at Mycroft then, all amusement gone with the sudden threat. Causing both John and Lestrade to lean back slightly at the sudden change.
“Humming. What is it?” The Familiar gave a slight incline of his head as he looked to John from behind a few random curls that had fallen forwards from the movement.
“Let’s go home, John.” Sherlock softly mentioned, with another soft pressure given to John’s back.”There is nothing else we need to be doing here.”
“Sherlock. You would be able to see it too if you would let me show you the
“Um...yes. Apologies. I just did not understand.” John said quietly.
Sebastian clicked his own fingers, and pointed to Sherlock.
But, that was all more the reason to look up what information he could find. Frown was quickly turned into slight puzzlement over the realization that he did not want Sherlock to have any other reason to be angry at him. Sad to say, John was still mostly ignorant of Familiars over-all, and yet Sherlock really was no different than living with any other bloke, besides the ears and tail.
things he had to do today.
“I am not a warlock.” John stated, clearly. Or at least he attempted to.
In the middle of his clicking-spree across the keyboard at some point Sherlock had interrogated John on what had happened after he’d fled before to go after the gunman. In a few soft sentences John went through the scenario as quickly as he could to keep himself from drawing himself too closely to the mental scene from before.
Lestrade simply rolled his eyes and moved to stand, clearing the way for Sherlock to sling himself onto his couch, re-cross his arms, and give a loud huff of aggravation at the entire scenario. Tail moving to wrap around both his legs and twist in an almost violent manner.
Opening the folder, John took a minute to flip through a few pages while Lestrade quietly made his way around behind the chair so that he could attempt to look over John’s shoulder.
“I thought you said you never guess.” John mentioned but then had a sudden...urge? Thought? He wasn't sure. Slowly, John scooted around where he could reach inside the cat door once more, holding his palm up and outstretched to where he hoped that Sherlock was actually at.
John leaned forwards and tapped the cab driver’s shoulder to grab his attention, which merely caused the man to look back at John through his rear-view window. Quietly, he gave the man the address and then leaned back into his seat again, giving Sherlock a look to find the man having turned his head towards the window and seemed deep in thought.
“So. Private detective.” John attempted after a soft clearing of his throat.
Reaching up with a still gloved hand he attempted to smooth back his hair, only to find it sticking to the leather of his glove. He ended up making a face as he attempted to yank his hand back and found most of his hair attempting to follow suite in static cling. Yeah, nothing comfortable about this at all.
. We’re going to watch this show and we are going to pretend like you didn't just mess this entire bloody night up for me, alright? Let’s go sit down, and you can explain to me later exactly why this particular place was so blasted important.”
“John…” Ella then leaned forwards, folding her arms atop the notepad in what John easily noticed as her attempting to hide what else she had written besides that last sentence. “I know things seem hard right now. A soldier back in civilian life, along with your found awareness. I think writing about everything that happens to you will not only help your mental state, but can also help you learn more about your abilities and give you a better idea on how to adapt to them in your life. I think writing will honestly help you in both those aspects.”
"Yes," Sherlock agreed, grinning. His eyes were sparkling. "I think so."
"Watson, while your concern is most generous, it is entirely misdirected." He glared into the fire and hugged his arm across his chest more tightly. The cough resurfaced.
"Don't waste it," John said, tipping his head forward to give Sherlock access.
They'd bought a nice espresso machine for the bar downstairs, something with so many spouts and wands and inputs and outlets that John had walked away from Sarah's nephew when he was exclaiming over it. Upstairs, Sherlock had a drip machine that could make eight cups of black filter coffee and nothing more. John poured in enough water for four cups and set it to brew.
He nuzzles his nose against the back of my neck. "Easily," he says. "You're not one to give in to persuasion, usually."
I told myself I was grateful enough to have his continued friendship, but that marriage marked the beginning of a spiral that took me deep into the criminal underground of London in pursuit of something that made me feel as strongly as he did. Discovering Professor Moriarty at the center of it was a lucky break. My brother warned me against him, told me there were other avenues available, but I let Moriarty string me along. I expected our final contest to end in both our deaths. That I lived and he was killed added insult to injury. That Watson was on his way back to my rescue couldn't be borne.
He grinned. "Good. I worried you might… shy away from making love with a person of your own sex."
"Perhaps!" Holmes exclaimed. "Come on, then, John. Lace me up and we'll go."
“The point is,” I said, kissing him again and stroking my hands down his firm chest, “I’ve a debt to pay. Would you care to come back to bed?”
"Your sister was on the show with you," Sherlock said. "She got as many close-ups as you did, and, I must say, you stood up to the scrutiny better than she did. Alcohol abuse shows in a person's face: burst blood vessels in the nose, puffiness around the eyes. You, John, you take risks with food, not with your surroundings; you're not reckless. Harry Watson is the kind of person who'd forget a hob was on. She did it on camera once."
"Of course," said he, clearing his throat. "Lestrade was just asking which of us proposed."
"Sounds perfect," Sherlock said, throwing down the paper and bounding out of bed.
"You know," he said, "lots of men say that to me, and hardly any of them mean it."
John laughed. "Of course that one's true, you prat," he said, wrapping his legs around Sherlock's thighs and rolling them to their sides. "That's why we're here."
"Come, John," he said. "Lots of work still to be done."
I bite my lip.
D'Arcy squeezed my hand and then reached over me for Watson's. "Quite well, quite well," said he. He was a short, robust chap with a broad face, bushy moustache, and a keen look in his eye. He stood over us with his thumbs hooked in his belt. "We have extracted a confession from our man," he said.
"Where did you go?"
“Glad to be awake, Doctor…?” He let the question trail off.
“It is later, now.”
Sherlock thought to himself, it wasnt quite the music that Sherlock appreciated, but somehow that deeper male tone raised at just the right points, and lowered again, perfect with his notes. Sherlock loved it when he knew he was right.
“Oh, he wasn't executed then?”
“And this is supposed to mean what…?” Lestrade finally asked after looking through the photo.
,” then motioned to the fork still in Concade’s hand, “is!”
“But, you would not be here if that were the case.” John answered in third, peering back up to the older brother.
His mood was just about to shift to that darker side he had been wallowing in by the time he did make it up the stairs, but Sherlock seemed patient enough to wait till John was at his side. After, he turned to unlock the door and swept himself inside with a flutter of that coat of his. John watched the fluid movement with interest that erased the fleeting thought of hobbling up the stairs, and made his way inside after him.
After grammar school in Chelmsford he decided that he should make a true attempt to better himself and ended up applying to King's College in London to study medicine. John never had to struggle, and even found himself from time to time feeling accomplished with his studies. He was learning to be a doctor, and what else could there be more accomplished than that? From there he went to Broomfield Hospital Chelmsford and the University College Hospital to work. He was doing something good.
“I’m...not really
Instantly the cats eyes darted in his direction, giving John a long quiet look before suddenly yawning and letting out a soft “
Well, maybe he hadn't heard anything? John did have the shower running after all…
that.
“That’s it?”
“And that is?”
Sherlock promptly leaped off the couch and began to stalk his way down the hallway to his room, tail high in the air.
“Well it isn’t
John gave a soft sigh after a minute and was about to pull his hand back through the small door before suddenly he felt a pressure through the leather of his glove, longer fingers wrapping around his hand and giving a small squeeze. Though Sherlock didn't respond, it was about as close as John was going to get to an acceptance to his apology than anything else.
That’s when John got a glimpse of Sherlock’s tail when that blue dressing gown wafted upwards within his movement.
So, why did this sound seem to bother him? A twist of his body and lifting his head from the couch, he let his chin prop atop the arm rest. Sherlock stared at the now closed door with one ear lifting above the other still hidden in his hair, tail having swept from the back of the couch to fold itself among his legs.
“Oh you have
“Well, it is a bit different from the last time I was…” But, John was struck mute mid-sentence by a slight glance from the laboratory’s other occupant. Sitting in a stool by one of the tables with a pipette in hand, was a tall gentleman with a mess of dark curls atop his head. It was the bare grace of the blue eyes that ended up with John pausing in mid shuffle as he stepped into the room, blinking. “...here.”
“I still do not understand…” John’s angered tone was quickly shifting to a more quieter, worried one.
“Do not make me order you.” Mycroft lifted a hand to point at Sherlock, with a small shake, something that instantly wiped the smirk off of Sherlock’s face. “We must have those plans back, for obvious reasons. They can not be allowed to fall into the wrong hands.”
Back at 221B, the two of them were in the living room. John had turned to nursing a cup of tea that he had very quickly moved to make as soon as they had returned. Sherlock’s cup, also made by John, lay to the side of his laptop, which Sherlock had quickly snatched up without much care to start clicking wildly on. John hadn't seen him take as much as a sip yet.
Either that, or Sherlock was just easily annoyed by almost anything. Not that he would admit that.
went their door, and Mrs. Hudson was no more.
, Sherlock?!” John sputtered at his flat-mate.
John turned on what he figured to be his best aren't-I-the-cutest smile he could muster.
John opened his mouth to respond, but found he had been struck mute. He really did not know what to say to this news. He was lucky to be alive, yes. But, all of this, he didn't know how to take. Concade let out a small sigh on noticing John’s silent reaction, he reached to rub at a temple before continuing.
John was about to start onto a rather lengthy rant about all of the almost certain problems of this situation in general were, but that bloody grin. Instead, he gave out a breathy laugh, one that even surprised himself. He turned to look at Mike, to see if he had any input to add to this ridiculous conversation.
“How much can you remember?” Sherlock leaned even closer. Their noses barely apart now.
Sherlock took his time by slowly looking between the two of them, though seemed to be completely lacking in his usual
“No.” Sherlock paused, looking down at John curiously. “Well…”
It just so happened though, the website’s scrolling suddenly fell upon the words “Shifting” in bold lettering, above a section that John had not got the opportunity to read yet. Squinting slightly, John found himself leaning closer towards the laptop. Having no clue what Shifting actually was, and how it might have something to do with Sherlock.
.” Sherlock hissed between his teeth, he had already hailed a taxi with whatever magical charm that John only wish worked for him as well, motioning John inside. “Hardly worth it.”
, else. He glared back at the other’s grin, and went to grab for his own side arm with a bloodied hand even if he knew he wasn't going to be spared the few seconds to actually fire back.
They ended up holding hands, through a doorway for a few minutes before John eventually cleared his throat.
And to those of you who are still with me, thank you. It might take me forever to get a chapter up, but this story will not be canceled by any means.
“Mine was in the bedroom.” Sherlock had already went back to typing, seeming to ignore John’s presence for the most part besides the half-muttered reply.
Yes, John would have at the time, done anything to stay. Even if that meant he was only good at bandaging people up rather than having to cut a bullet out of anyone. Even though Sherlock was correct, John couldn't help narrowing his eyes slightly, he did not like where this conversation was going. This did nothing to stop the only consulting detective in the world when he was on a roll.
“You haven't written a single word yet, have you?” Ella pierced through his attempt to salvage what little personal respect John had for himself at the time being, all the while not even looking at her patient as she scribbled on the paper in her lap.
, very soon.”
John had a brand new pillow, and coverings, for his bed. They were simple, just like his usual taste, but new none the less. As he was reaching over with his right hand to run his fingers over the material of the pillow itself, he stopped mid way, catching himself looking down at his hand.
Not that he was actually expecting to get a answer
“The M.O.D. has been working on a new missile defense system, the Bruce-Partington Programme. Andrew West was in possession of a very
John thought that maybe he heard some sort of muffled reply, but nothing that he could actually make out given that Sherlock was locked inside, and he was bloody out here.
“You’re not the only one to enjoy a good murder. There’s others out there just like you, except you’re just a typical Familiar...and they’re so much more than that. No hiding from me, Mr. Holmes.”
“Not in a police car. I’ll be along shortly.” Sherlock muttered darkly at him, ears flat and erased from existence once more.
. John remembered.
“Mr. Holmes.” He said respectfully.
) he had needed to learn the five levels so that when a magical patient needed attending, the current level could give an indication of what procedures needed to be put in place for that particular patient. John knew as a human he was already listed as a level one, without magical awareness what-so-ever. Levels two and three were the most common with what most perceived as a normal state for most magical users. Four on the other hand, was for the more enhanced levels where a state of awareness was more prominent. Five, were the users that were deemed as an actual threat in their talents. John shuddered to think about this, as he knew that level fives were not even allowed in the general public.
“You would not be here if I did not wish it, John Watson. You being a warlock has left me with no desire to remove you from the premises. If anything, your skill-set only makes you that much more interesting and worthwhile to The Work. It is not every day that anyone finds a level four that had no prior knowledge or tutelage of their talent. Where as yours…” Sherlock paused after flopping onto his couch, using his own tail to point in John’s direction. “Your talent happens to be...
“No need, though…” And here he was being leaned slightly over again. The man’s tone turning to a far more serious turn. “In a return favor, for further information I’d be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis to ease your way.”
John ended up blinking slightly, but with a small cough he nodded his head towards Sherlock and stretched out a gloved hand in his direction, doing his damnedest to avoid looking at the top of his head to wonder where the ears were currently hiding.
The world has changed greatly since then, and human/familiar society has blended into a co-existing organism all its own. Magic users are not nearly as common as they used to be, with only theories of the world’s natural fading magic to lean towards a cause. Witches and Warlocks are still born amongst humans, though their magical talent is not near what the stories of old say they should be capable of. Years are usually spent attempting to even remotely achieve a regular standard of magical prowess, and both Witches and Warlocks are normally stuck with whatever their particular talent decides they excel in. More powerful magic-users are kept in strict check among the governments.
“Your...yeah, okay.” John quickly closed the fridge while lifting a hand to rub at his face. He didn't dare ask what else was in there. Better to take the time to psyche himself up to conquer the fridge later. His appetite was long gone now.
Along with the mess, he didn't find anything that remotely looked like food across any of the counters, and on looking into the cupboards he only found some dusty dishes and mugs. Pulling two of the mugs out and carefully placing them on the cleaner looking portion of the counter, he moved onto the fridge.
“And you would know this, how…?” John narrowed his eyes slightly with a lower toned annoyed outlook.
Carefully, Sherlock slipped through his own door and hovered near the closed bathroom door. With a mind of it’s own, his tail casually lifted from under his gown to hoop around the door handle, where it hovered and twitched.
Surprise, surprise, when nothing of the sort actually happened.
“What are we, twelve? Fine, I promise!” John crossed his arms over his chest and glared in defiance.
“You’re...okay with it?” John stammered again, watching him.
“And as I have been attempting to tell you, Lestrade, this was self defense. You would have had three bodies on your hand rather than just the two, and those three bodies would be far more innocent than the two you ended up with.” Replied Sherlock with a verbal sneer in his voice.
“You're going to keep me here to study me.” John stated to this, and even as strong willed as he was, he couldn't help the slight tremor that crept into his tone.
“No, Sherlock...just...I am sorry, but no.”
“Shall we?” Sherlock suddenly mentioned though before the conversation could further into more greetings between the two of them, and unlooped himself from Mrs Hudson to make his way up the stairs.
"No, you don't owe me anything. Just stop."
There's is silence on both ends of the phone. There has been a lot of that lately. Sherlock breaks it first, "Thank you, Molly."
Sherlock is out of the shower just as he got in; his hair still dry to save time. He throws on a new set of clothes and heads down the hall to pack John's things.
But John won't have it. He's done playing games. 'Games' got him hurt. Got his wife killed. He simply waits for a real answer.
"Thank you, Mrs. Hudson. I don't know what we'd do without you."
Rosie rearranges in Sherlock's arms, re-nestling her head in the crook of Sherlock's neck. Her breath tickles on Sherlock's neck. He sits down in his chair, not wanting to wake her by putting her back down. It's oddly comforting, holding a baby. Odd, that.
And Sherlock stays like this, for hours, promising himself he'll be awake when John wakes up. He'll be awake so he can move his finger, that's what he tells himself. One or two nurses come in in every few hours to check up and ask him if he'd like some coffee. Sherlock declines each time, sending them away. None of the nurses give a second glance to Sherlock's hand.
"I'm fine... I'm fine! It's his blood. Focus on John."
"What do you mean 'for John'? Is he back with you?"
"Sir!"
Sherlock is taken aback by Mycroft's kind words, for they don't exchange them often.
"You've had all day, what possibly more do you have to say?"
Eventually the doctors came in around noon. The whole lot of them. Sherlock doesn't remember any of their names, he had deleted them the second they were made known.
Sherlock let's out a sigh of relief. "That's... good."
"I really don't think that's—"
The entourage of doctors bring John back around a quarter past five, just a few minutes after Mrs. Hudson and Rosie arrive, wheeling him slowly back against the wall again. They re-position all his machines and bags, making sure everything is back in it's correct place. Dr. Andrews (Sherlock can now remember he name because of her above-average sized Adam's apple) fills a few things out on her clipboard before she speaks. She clicks her pen closed and slides it into place in her pocket, "Good evening, Mr. Holmes," she extends he hand to Mrs. Hudson, "I'm Dr. Andrews."
John feels like an ass. This is going so poorly. Sherlock's a wreck, John doesn't know how to deal with this version of the man looking back at him. He can handle high Sherlock, he can handle angry Sherlock, he can handle intensely focused Sherlock, but this? He's never seen this before. This is different.
"That you were in danger."
"JOHN! John, you have to listen to me! You have to stay awake! Please, they're almost here! I know it hurts, but you have to stay strong! Please! .... There—" Another sob. "There are things I need to say to you. You have to stay strong okay? Please, you've got to be really brave for me. Fight like the soldier I know you are..." More shuttered breaths.
"Yeah well sometimes you act like it."
"And?"
"John, don't you think if I had a sister I would know?"
Sherlock clicks his tongue, "Well, I do."
"Oh. Thank you, but I'd have nothing to say."
"Well I don't think anyone would," Molly consoles.
"Sherlock? Is everything alright?"
Sherlock gets in the car and the driver shuts the door behind him. As quiet as this car is, the shut of the door has stirred Rosie. She makes the usual baby murmurs which make Sherlock smile. He reaches a finger over and pets her tiny hand. At his touch, Rosie undoes her fist and wraps her fingers around Sherlock's finger. Within a few seconds, Rosie's asleep again. Sherlock doesn't take his eyes off her for the entire drive to 221B.
"Alright, then I'll just," the nurse walks over to John and begins to press different buttons on different machines, each making their own chime and beep. She untangles a few tubes and straightens them out along the adjoining stand.
"Don't you think you should say something to him?"
"Why."
"No. What room is it?"
"Though I may be resolute in my disposition towards family, I do still care
As Sherlock puts his phone away he sees a group of surgeons walk up to him. Sherlock stands at their arrival, "How is he?"
Sherlock looks up into the paramedic's eyes from down on the floor.
"Goodnight, Sherlock."
Sherlock knows he could probably be a little kinder but none of that matters right now. He'll make it up to Molly later. Maybe.
Sherlock is calmer than he was before. Mycroft has always had that effect on him. As much as they annoyed each other and bickered, and as much as Sherlock hated to admit it, they did have some sort of familial effect on one another.
"Yes, it is. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that we can now begin to wean him off the anesthetics and sedatives that are keeping him in this state of coma, and administer medication to help speed everything up."
"Sherlock Holmes! Stop acting like a silly child and say something to him."
"What!?" Lestrade wheels around.
"Then go get a nurse then."
"John!? John! It's going to be alright, you're going to be fine. I called Lestrade, he and his team are coming, so is an ambulance. You just have to make it until then alright!? Oh god, John! I'm so sorry!"
"Oh... always, Sherlock."
"That's good?" Mrs. Hudson's no expert.
"I said 'no,' John!"
"Why didn't you go home?"
" What is that even supposed to mean? Stop meddling in John's affairs.'
"Only some. It's all a bit cloudy."
"John, please."
Carefully as to not hurt John, Sherlock climbs in besides him. He's on his side and very close to John. He can almost smell him, that distinct smell that only belongs to John that is now mixed with hospital laundry detergent on the sheets. John needs to come home soon.
"Just though I'd bring you some water in case you get thirsty, that's all," she sets a pitcher and a plastic hospital cup down on the stand beside John's bed and heads towards the door.
"Doctors say they could begin to wean him off the anesthetics tonight. Possibly wake up sometime tomorrow. If that's the case, probably early morning."
Mycroft clicks his tongue and raises his umbrella outwards to examine it."That's alright. Lucky for us, most of that neighborhood uses CCTV, so we've got it all right here," he says as he procures a small thumb drive from his inside jacket pocket, "Sherlock, you're laptop please?"
"You know exactly what Sherlock. I'm not going to insult your intelligence, albeit clearly lacking in common sense at the present moment, by pretending as if you don't. I'm tired of watching the pity party of self loathing you're throwing for yourself, and John is too."
That's all that needs to be said. One simple word and John knows, this topic is not to be discussed. He can hear it in the tone, the punctuated 'd,' Sherlock is not going to talk about it.
Sherlock looks at the clock on the wall across from him. It's already been an hour and half of surgery. Sherlock needs something to distract himself; he focuses in on the other people in the waiting room.
Then Mike was opening the door to a lab-like demonstration kitchen with rotary evaporators on the gleaming stainless steel tables and dozens of sizes of pots and pans hanging from the ceiling. There were dehydrators and sous-vide water baths and convection ovens lining the walls, and mirrors over demonstration ranges that made the room seem twice as big. Most of the lights were off.
"He's brilliant," John said through his teeth, "and I'm honoured to have him as a partner."
I sat down to breakfast alone, accompanied only by his soft, slightly labored breathing, and the loosely-rolled document on the table.
“When you said, ‘we’re going for a drink’,” John said, craning his neck up at the stone carvings above the door, “you meant we’re going to Vintners Hall.”
Either way, it made D'Arcy back down. He cleared his throat and said, "I'd best be getting back to the station," although a quick glance around the pub indicated he'd come in for lunch with a few of the official force. "Good afternoon to you both."
"Sherlock," he said.
Finally, after perhaps a week of such nonsense, he stopped in the middle of routine, shaving cream on half his face, and said, "Is there something in particular you want, or are you content with your voyeurism?"
"Oh, thank you," I said, my heart now thumping in my chest.
"I didn't offer Mary a job. I thought you never guessed at things."
“It’s very promising,” I admitted. I stroked his clean-shaven cheeks and kissed them.
"Not too tender, are you?" I asked. "Not too badly chafed?"
"I'm serious!"
It certainly had set a nice precedent.
Watson's lower lip was caught between his teeth and a flush had risen high in his cheeks. He put the scissors aside and gathered the cut hair into the palm of his hand to discard.
an experiment," Sherlock said with a sigh of consternation, and stalked out of the kitchen.
"You're a lucky one, Doctor Watson," I said fondly.
"We should get married right now."
The drawers came down with ease, and he was trapped. His prick pushed against the fabric of his apron, and I prayed to God it would leave a mark. I slid my palms up Holmes’s firm thighs, ruffling the sparse hair the wrong direction. His legs were spread just enough that I could wiggle my thumb between and rub his heavy bollocks. He pushed back and I heard him gasp. By now I expected him to be hiding his face in his forearms.
"Me? I'm being dramatic?"
“No,” the machine says. “Or, I do not know if she does. Her motives are simple: kick the door down, solve the crime, bring the criminals to justice. She wants to be right about Moriarty. She doesn’t look much deeper than that.”
. The bed was unmade and there were clothes thrown on the chair in the corner, near enough to his wardrobe that if it were my room I'd have just put them away, but there was nothing objectionable on the floor and his dressing table only had one layer of discarded odds and ends on it.
am," I said.
"Does he ever remind you of it? Intentionally, I mean."
“Quite,” I agreed, and squirmed under the blankets, trying to get enough leverage to push my hips up against his body. I was securely fixed to the bed.
His eyes glittered. "I hope you remember that when I've got a blade at your throat."
"Well, you are," John replied, "and I am."
I blinked and took the bottle for myself again.
I take the glass from him as he grimaces and set it on the floor. Then I turn my attention back to his trousers. He unfastens his waistcoat, grudgingly, and I undo his braces and his fly. His prick tents his drawers. I press my face against his open placket and inhale and he mutters, “Bloody hell,” above me.
I reasoned away his gratitude and embrace as I got ready for bed. We had secured our future together, and there was nothing more reassuring than knowing your assets and interests were protected by someone you trusted. I didn't have any family left, and I loathed the idea of my sudden death resulting in my books and papers ending up in the hands of someone who didn't care about them. Holmes had his brother, but he'd expressed to me more than once that he dreaded the thought of his brother dealing with his estate and his reputation. It was logical that we give one another the benefit of it.
Sherlock held one end of the cooled rubber tube over the plate. He pushed air into the other end with a fresh syringe, and the tomato soup came out in a sinuous wiggle, folding over itself on the plate like a soft noodle. He offered it to John wordlessly.
"We open in April," John reminded her.
I thought this scene would move along as quickly as the others, but the boys decided the Oxford fashion wasn’t satisfying and frig each other instead, face to face. There was a great deal of description of their long staffs rubbing together; I returned my attention to my cock, circling the head with my fingers and smearing the fluid around. I jerked myself quickly as the narrator and his friend kissed and masturbated one another, suddenly certain that I could finish with them. I was close, my cock growing even harder in my hand, the tip rosy and gleaming.
"Well," said Sherlock sheepishly, "I suppose it does need to be organised a bit."
"Certainly not," Mycroft said. He had an umbrella in his left hand, and he leaned upon it now. "I'd expect nothing less from my brother; he is very closed-mouthed when it comes to important subjects."
Watson wasn't listening. I reached over and grabbed his hand, meaning only to get his attention, but his palm was so warm and pleasant that I held on.
"Of course it is," he said. "Consider the money I made while you were gone. It was due, in part, to your work."
I remembered finishing dinner and opening another bottle of wine. Holmes and I were both tipsy at that point: he relaxes and raises his voice, as if people aren't hanging on his every word anyway, and he was nearly shouting to be heard over the cacophony that was the inn after eight o'clock. He had reached over to get my attention, to illustrate some point to someone, and he had caught hold of my hand.
It didn't last long-- once John started imagining Sherlock's intensity of focus turned away from cooking and onto sex. He pictured what Sherlock would look like with his mouth open for John's cock-- God, so inappropriate, Sherlock was his business partner-- and decided it would be pretty fucking spectacular. He jerked himself hard and fast, chasing his climax. When he came, it was with a groan and a jolt, spurting wet and hot onto his bare belly.
"Yes, yes," I said, pulling his face down for another kiss. He kissed me hard, licking deep and biting my mouth; his hand around my prick moved hard and fast, slicked by my own excitement. I sank into the pleasure, letting it wind tighter and tighter between my thighs. I gripped Holmes's arm, even though that hindered his movement, and held onto the back of his neck, panting into his mouth. He held me tightly, pulling back just a little to watch my face, and rubbed his prick against my hip. I could feel my prick growing stiffer, thickening, my bollocks tightening as I neared my peak. Holmes noticed it too, for he quickened his pace further and gripped me tighter; I clutched at him, arching, my hips rising, and then all at once the spasm took me, and I spent over his fingers.
"Slowly," he reminded me, breathless. I obeyed, slowing almost to a crawl, which made him huff in annoyance. I moved my finger inside him and the huff turned into a gasp. "There."
The porters arrived at half-three, even though everything their usual tasks would involve had been done over the last month and perfected the night before. The cooks and bar staff were in place by four, beginning their prep with lemon rind shavings and ice spheres. At half-four, the wait staff arrived, and Sherlock stayed in the kitchen while Lestrade briefed them. They didn't need
"My dear fellow," said I, pulling back the blankets. He climbed nimbly in and pressed himself alongside my body. His hands and feet were rather cold, but I embraced him all the same. He pressed a kiss to my cheek, a little rough with stubble due to the hour, and then my mouth, his lips warm and soft.
"And this," Holmes said, just as seriously, looking into my eyes. I saw his mouth twitch as he tried not to grin.
The machine shrugs and pulls ahead, rising fifteen feet in the air to hover just below the rest of traffic that is beginning to pick up. It whirs with the effort of going so slowly. Other drivers whiz by overhead and honk in frustration, but the machine does not abandon me for convenience's sake. How do the cars stay afloat? If they were pushing air down, they would have to do so with such force that they would flatten anything beneath them. Is it magnets? Is it chemistry? There's so much to understand I think I might not even bother.
John put his hands up in surprise, leaning back in the chair, and Sherlock settled heavily onto his thighs, linking his hands behind John's neck. He looked down into John's face, watching the way his pupils dilated and his cheeks flushed, the wrinkles in the corners of his eyes and the flicker of his tongue over his bottom lip. He didn't push Sherlock off, which was the most obvious indicator of his interest in the developing situation.
He sighed deeply, leaning back in the tub. It was round and deep, sized to squat or recline. One couldn't stretch one's legs out, which was a shame, but it was generous in other proportions. The water reached to his nipples, making them soft, and he tipped his head back against the rim. When he opened his eyes, his gaze was hazy with pleasure.
"Indeed. Er, do you think we ought to move?"
John had to look away again, and he fished his own phone out of his pocket. "Yeah, I know a place." He had them on speed dial, as it happened.
"This is the dining room, obviously," Mrs Hudson said. "My late husband had terrible taste, so I've torn out all the decor for you. But the bones of the place are strong. Good lines."
"Glad you're up," Sherlock said, putting his cup down a little too roughly and sloshing coffee over the rim. "Busy day today, lots to do." He got up from the table and retreated down the hallway that led to his bedroom. John opened his mouth to protest, or to demand an explanation, but Sherlock had vanished before he could say anything. A moment later, the shower started up.
“Ah, Mr Watson,” Lestrade said, “good of you to join us.”
"I'm not—" John started, with a sigh of annoyance that was more at his last hour than at Sherlock. "No."
"Watson," he said, a revelation in his eyes, "what did he sound like?"
“Mm,” I agreed.
Chief Inspector Lloyd walked up with Hopkins at his heels. “Mr Holmes,” he said, and then, after the briefest pause, “Dr Watson. Constable Hopkins tells me there has been a misunderstanding.”
happen, and never getting any of it in production. That's your strength, John: putting things into motion."
Watson mutters, "Madman," and slips his hand down to cover my prick. I gasp, pushing up against the touch.
“Very well,” Watson said. “Goodnight, Inspector.”
"I did say that." John disengaged himself and rolled to the side, so Sherlock followed, plastering himself to John's side, arm over his chest, leg over his thigh. John's left hand came to rest in the middle of his back, tracing patterns across his skin. "Under the duvet, maybe?" he suggested.
John was lightheaded. This was not quite how he'd pictured this encounter going. Then again, he shouldn't have been quite so surprised. Sherlock might chafe against authority, but he'd already admitted John was an exception. John was going to have to be careful not to abuse the power. Not that he was
He was down one already. Athelney Jones had turned up five minutes late, blamed the Tube, and Sherlock had said, "Out," very calmly. So calmly, in fact, that Jones didn't fight him; he just looked down at his shoes, said, "Yes, Chef," and left.
"I don't care, is the point," he said. "It's not going to change the way I— think about you—" That sounded awkward— "or your cooking—" Slightly better, Watson— "so long as it isn't going to interfere."
John sighed, skimming his hands up Sherlock's back to rest on his shoulder blades, his embrace heavy and comfortable. He slid one hand into Sherlock's hair at the base of his skull, combing through the curls, and Sherlock couldn't stifle the moan of anticipation, even with John's collarbone between his teeth. John chuckled, the sound resonating in his throat, and gave a little tug. Pleasure rippled down Sherlock's spine. He let himself be moved, guided to lave his tongue over John's Adam's apple and along the slope of his shoulder, until he felt John tense underneath him.
"Why do you want to work here?"
"Tell me what you think of this," he said.
John went home again that night with noticeable spring in his step, filled with optimism and potential, and Sherlock—again, somewhat guiltily—watched him go.
“He was in a fight, apparently, around three this morning.”
"That's a certainty," he agreed. He glanced down at our joined hands, and I guiltily let go. He took the opportunity to pat his pockets, searching for a cigarette, and I watched him tuck it in the corner of his mouth while he looked for his matches. I had mine to hand, so I fished them out, lit one, and offered him the flame.
Over the next week or so, Sherlock spent more and more time in the kitchen, working on formulas and perfecting the preparations. John ate a different dish for every meal, tasting and critiquing, while also finishing the licensing, ensuring that 221 was on the list for Restaurant Week, paying the contractors, ordering supplies of every variety from onions to aprons, and trying to think up things to write for the restaurant's blog. He went back to his own flat drop-dead exhausted, resenting every journey and every time he had to leave Sherlock behind. He knew Sherlock was eating, because he was adjusting the recipes until they were just right, but twice John returned to the restaurant to find Sherlock exactly where he'd left him the night before with no indication that he'd been to bed.
"Oh, so when you say you'll get me a barback, you mean you want me to pick one and you'll write down his name?"
There were tables around the perimeter of the room, filled with bottles of wine for tasting, and spittoons in the middle for dispensing with that wine once it had been tasted. An elderly man with white whiskers was spitting into one at that moment, and John vowed to swallow every mouthful of wine he tasted tonight, despite the number of bottles on display.
Harry was still talking, all the while plucking off bits of dough, rolling it between her hands, and flattening it carefully on the countertop. They didn't have a tortilla press, so she was making do. She turned the dough and flattened again, turned and flattened, and then peeled it up carefully and passed it a few times between her hands before she laid it gently on the griddle. John heard the griddle hiss, and the cameraman leaned in to get a closer shot. Harry watched as the tortilla crisped, and then she peeled it off and flipped it over.
"I always wanted to do cakes," she said, nervously pushing the hair that escaped her ponytail behind her ear. "So I dropped out of Uni after my second year, studying English—" she laughed, as if she'd been conditioned to do it, and covered her mouth to stop herself. "—and took up cooking school."
"Possibly," Sherlock said, sitting up, "but I'm not going to comment on the post to tell everyone that."
Sherlock focused his attention on John's cock, tightening his grip, while his other fingers still worked shallowly and slowly inside John. His mouth was on John's shoulder again, and his wet hair tickled John's ear. His prick bumped John's thigh. He stroked John slowly, deliberately, and John let himself relax into the sensations. When the orgasm came, it was slow and luxurious, a gradual tightening of all his muscles that released in a jolt. He heard his own moan echoed in Sherlock's muffled grunt against his shoulder.
We put the glasses down on the table at the same time, and the innkeeper appeared to refill them from the bottle on our table. It only had a splash left in the bottom, which Watson promptly drank without waiting for me, and the innkeeper said, "Ah, just a moment, I'm sure I have one more of these."
She beamed. "I'll leave you to your morning repast," she said. "Eliza will come for the tray when you're finished."
The compress had gotten warm by now, so I put it aside. It was after midnight. Somehow I knew Holmes wouldn't be back; he hadn't gone in pursuit of more clues, he had run to hide. Possibly to one of his bolt holes, or perhaps to his brother's. I considered writing a note to send after him in the morning, but he would have to come back here eventually. I would just be ready for his return, with open arms and a renewed sense of honesty. I felt like I ought to be scared of that honesty, but we were
"Management," Sherlock said. "I want to be the head chef, and I want you to run the business."
"Thanks for the tea," John whispered, when Sherlock had turned out the light and settled down, heavy and warm against him.
John followed as Sherlock gave Greg a tour, blatantly eavesdropping on their conversation. It was his business too, he reasoned. Sherlock was gesticulating with enthusiasm, explaining how they were going to lay the place out.
“I like the second ones best,” John said.
I lock the door behind us.
"The black currant in this one is good," Sherlock said, clearing his throat.
"They were
"Do you suppose the household is asleep?" I murmured.
"You're the one who came back here! Why else but to rub her in my face?"
As he walked by the two cooks making a roasted beetroot salad, he overheard the younger one, Hopkins, saying, "I don't care what he makes us do today, Sherlock Holmes is a bloody genius."
"What time is it?"
The last table
, the wine, all convinced him not to. Instead he mopped up with a handful of tissues and tossed them aside. He fell asleep, too tired to feel property guilty about the whole thing.
It's such a relief to encounter a single familiar thing that I give due consideration to weeping like a child. Ultimately, I refrain.
We kissed as I touched him, lips sliding together, tongues just brushing. He was making soft noises in his throat. His hips churned, rocking into the pressure of my hand even as the muscles in his stomach tensed to keep himself in control. I was so focused on him that my own arousal was an afterthought, something building and growing in the background. I knew when he finally touched me in return it would not be long at all before my own crisis.
When we were out in public, he put his arm through mine as he always did, but he held onto my elbow a little tighter, and his ring kept catching my eye. Lestrade brought us a new case, swearing up and down it wasn't another surprise party, and as we looked over the scene Holmes put his hand on my shoulder to draw my attention. I felt the touch through my coat and jacket to my skin. Later that same afternoon, he laced his fingers with mine without looking, which was certainly something he'd never done before.
I stopped to adjust my position, ignoring Holmes’s whine of disappointment, and lay on my belly between his thighs. His cock went back into my mouth, and now I could take him deep and fuck him at the same time, all the while grinding my own prick into the bed. I felt myself leaking against my belly, and couldn’t stop my hips from rolling. If Holmes wouldn’t last long, I wouldn’t be far behind.
I stared at my hands some more. Watson said he loved me.
John snorted, thumping his head back against the wall. His stomach still churned. "Me? Fill in for you? I could never fill your shoes. You're a madman and a genius, and I'm just… I'm a washed-up fool who can't stand the smell of smoke. I don't belong in a kitchen. Jesus, Sherlock."
"Our reputation," I said.
"Hmm, perhaps."
Mary lifted her glass in a toast. "To everything else," she said, and drank.
I had one card up my sleeve, but I couldn’t quite be certain that it would be available. My own secret weapon might lie in wait somewhere in the park, but where was not guaranteed. Nevertheless, a little fuss might bring some attention to the chase and any help I could get was worth the effort. I’d been chasing Williams for the better part of twenty minutes and the sprint was beginning to wear.
, then." He stalked back into the kitchen.
"Sherlock is very private, you see," Watson's voice said in my head. "We've wanted to be married for
"Did you come here just to verbally abuse me," John asked, "or did you actually need something?" He wasn't going to give her the row that she wanted. If she had something to say to him, fine; if not, he was going to call her a cab and show her out. He wondered if Clara knew where she was, or if that had anything to do with anything.
a sanitised
"Holmes!" he said, putting down the paper and pushing out the other chair with his foot. "How are you feeling?"
"But it's true."
John smirked at him. "All right, Romeo," he said, facing the wall again.
— gets a warning glare and makes no attempt to protest. He knows he has overstepped, and in such a place! A gentlemen’s club; not even that
am, then. I want them to sit down and be served and not worry about what they want to eat."
"No." I sank onto the settee. My face ached. My whole body ached. I should be at home with my Doctor. I was getting too old for this nonsense.
He got a muted chorus of greetings in return.
"John," she said, reaching for him, and he embraced her tight.
What he was, exactly, he never said, but I obeyed, drawing back to plunge my fingers deeper, faster, the wet, sucking sound of his body engulfing me loud enough to make me blush. He frigged himself rapidly, moans slipping out between his clenched teeth. I moved back to his neck, tucking my nose against his hammering pulse.
There was a tug on the bell downstairs, and Holmes let the top half of the broadsheet fall to beam at me.
This was no marriage of convenience, I thought. Not anymore.
Harry's eyes had lit up. "Oh, no, John, if he wants to hear what I've got to say, I think that's just bloody fine. Anyway, you can stick around and hear what I've got to say to
everything else."
"Right, you lot," he said, "Mycroft's going to have Track 1 all to himself, if I'm not mistaken, which I never am, and my parents will probably order Track 3 for two. Anthea won't eat."
"They'll do anything to get out of catering," Sherlock snorted.
I went home, feeling a little adrift. We'd been working this case together for a fortnight; to be put aside now stung. But then again, sometimes he was quicker on his own. He was right that one person often moved easily when two could not, so I tried not to take it personally. Perhaps he just needed a little bit of time alone. Living in each other's pockets and working together every day could become wearing on even the most resolute of partners.
John who is on his back, leans a bit to hit the switch on the wall behind the bed to turn off the lights. The room darkens quite a bit but light still seeps through the blinds on the window just enough so its not completely dark. John turns his head to face Sherlock and puts his hand out again. Sherlock takes it and their fingers wrap around each other's again. John gives Sherlock's hand a small squeeze and within minutes they're both falling asleep.
"That's what you need young man. But I'm assuming that's not going to happen is it, hm?" she replies with a knowing smile.
"He's making a funny face... I think I'll put a hole in it."
Sherlock looks down at his hands, remaining careworn.
Sherlock gets up and moves his chair next to John's bed. He sits, but does nothing else. He doesn't talk, he doesn't move— he just sits and watches John's chest rise and fall with the ventilator.
"They have stupid rules which I of course ignore."
When they've finally gone through all the cases, and after Lestrade has complained about his coworkers to an uninterested Sherlock, they're left with a bigger issue at hand.
It's almost as if Mycroft was expecting the text from Sherlock (Oh wait! He did.), because he replies back instantly. 'You know as well as I, that the information I must share with you both is extremely important.'
"It normally is," Sherlock replies while handing back the folder.
"Sherlock," he raises a finger towards the sleeping figure next to the bed, "How long has he been there?"
"Sorry?"
"I thought John might like a watch." It's a loaded sentence and John can see it hit Sherlock square in the chest.
'Please!... There-'
"How do you feel?" Sherlock's voice comes out small and almost timid from John's left, where he still stands, eyes frozen on John.
"Sherlock."
"Right, ok then."
"One last thing, do call Molly Hooper. She looks very worried."
The female doctor clears her throat, calling attention to herself, "With everything Dr. Wallace has told you,—"
"I heard things, but I don't know if they were real or not."
Lestrade catches his breath and asks while pulling out a stack of folders from his bag, "Mind if I run a few things by you?"
become codependent. He'll have a lovely time learning not to be in the months ahead. But he has tonight. He can spend tonight with John, though he may be sleeping, and remember every single part of it.
I'm SO SO SO SORRY I haven't posted. Believe me I wanted to, I just couldn't find the time! I'm hoping things won't be so crazy soon and I'll be able to write more. Hopefully the chapter pleases <3
"–We've just seen Mr. Watson's CT and he's made profound progress. His cranial and inter-cranial swelling has gone down just about eighty-eighty percent."
Sherlock ever so slowly, with hesitation filling every bone in his body and every quiver of his being, brings his hand up by John's. He keeps it there, as if he were testing the waters, but really he's just afraid. But if he can't do it know, he'll never do it. Sherlock, millimeter my millimeter, moves his pinky finger so it lays gently across John's pinky.
"Hey, getting closer," he replies, referring to the name he's just been called.
'Yes, brother dear?'
"No, I mean
It's not long before sleep actually pulls at Sherlock. He doesn't want to go into his mind palace, for fear of dropping or letting Rosie slip, so there is nothing to distract him from exhaustion. Tomorrow will be a long day. Maybe sleep wouldn't be the worst idea.
"No."
"I'll take it under consideration."
"Sherlock Holmes, do stop ignoring your phone and answer my call please." And the loudspeaker crackles off.
Once the door has been shut behind them, Sherlock pulls out his phone and sends a text to Mycroft, reading, 'What the hell, Mycroft? Working your own agenda as always? Even now?'
There is a sigh on the other end of the phone. Mycroft begins again, "I have information regarding the present circumstances."
But the laughing doesn't last and silence soon reigns again. Both men are desperate to fill it, but neither can think of anything to say.
"Oh... ok. I'll be back soon. The doctors should still be fiddling with the machines when you get up there. Nothing to worry about though."
Sherlock's fingers are like lighting over the keyboard. 'That's beside the point!'
Sherlock is silent, not a single movement present on his body.
"Sherlock Holmes. How is he?" Sherlock flicks his eyes to John again.
"Not true."
"You should take Rosie home. Let her sleep in a proper bed."
"Not by you!"
"Well, as usual you are wrong. I'll be in touch, brother mine."
When Sherlock turns back down to look at John, he sees John's eyes are closed. His breath even shallower. Sherlock feels John's pulse; barely there.
The living room is full of toys. Sherlock doesn't sit, but rather creeps towards the coffee table. Under a pile of things is John's laptop. Sherlock removes the clutter surrounding it and picks it up. He'll take it with him, John might want it.
Sherlock doesn't even reply to the last text. He's tired of Mycroft and his all seeing eye. He shoves his phone back into his chest pocket and glares back out the window, now reflecting back the image of a angry Sherlock. He looks tired, there are bags under his eyes. He hasn't slept at all for at least a few days. Even if he's tired, he'll wake up in the middle of the night, sometimes as a the result of an occasional nightmare. He's lost quite a bit of weight too, his suit appearing just a bit big on his bony form. John was always good about getting Sherlock to eat. If John hadn't been around all those years, Sherlock would probably be as thin and sick as a skeleton. An example of one of the many ways John Watson saved Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock, who has now turned to face the band of medical specialists, silently nods his head in greeting. He slips his hands into his pockets, gaining obvious control of the room, despite his lack of a medical degree.
"Will you please come wait here while I go back to the flat to change?"
"Shh... it's okay. Everything's fine. Just an ambulance. Maybe even a case to keep me distracted tomorrow... wouldn't that be nice?"
It's mid-afternoon now. The doctor visited while Mycroft was still explaining. He did the best he could with what he believes happened. Sherlock barraged him with questions, demanding explanations. John had his own questions too but mostly spent the time just listening, watching everything unfold in front of him. It was like a whole other conversation was going on between Sherlock and Mycroft beneath the surface, in a language he couldn't quite read or understand. By then end of it Sherlock especially keen to see Mycroft go.
The paramedic places a hand on Sherlock's shoulder with a look of acknowledgment. When the paramedic stands to go Sherlock slumps back against the wall, whispering to himself through a shuttered breath, "John."
"They say that memories are best. Or if you just talk
Sherlock's phone buzzes again. This time it's a phone call. Sherlock is in no mood to verbally converse with Molly, thus ignoring his phone once again.
"Because it has to be."
The two men hold each other's gaze and Sherlock's eyes go glassy. John can't look and turns his head, signaling to the pitcher of water and making an attempt to lean for it.
Sherlock's eyes meet John's in surprise and John gives him a little smile. As he processes the words, Sherlock gives John a small nod in return, still holding his eyes to his.
"Perhaps it would better for me to return tomorrow, once collective mental states have improved," that last part spoken with an eye towards Sherlock's away-faced statue.
'Because this way, my way, your doctor could wake up sooner. And all I want is for my little brother to be happy.'
scared. How is it possible for people to be as scared as he was?
"What? No, I want to-"
"Don't you dare start to console me like everyone else. It won't fix the anything. And if you're wondering if I'm clean? As a whistle. Did I cover everything?"
"Not possible. I don't have a sister."
"Drugs, yes. The drugs, Lestrade"
"I don't understand why it has to be me."
"Yes. If I hadn't been high on all of those drugs then I could have been able to figure out the note, and if I had done that, I would have known."
"When I get back I need you to go to his place and get some things for him."
"Yes, I believe that would be very helpful in the long run." Sherlock's tone is bordering on patronizing.
The house is different. Not as tidy as it used to be. Everything is out of place, but not messy per say. Sherlock doesn't know whether to sit, or stand, or speak, but the choice is made for him.
"Yes," and Sherlock's sitting down and the doctors are gone. Molly will surely be arriving soon. He clasps his hands and waits.
"Time," is the response John gets, in a near whisper.
Paramedics and police are yelling to each other from across the room, everyone zigzagging around to help.
"My minimum is a six today."
"Uh, can you make sure the door shuts—"
"Is your hearing going too now? Yes, Molly Hooper looks very worried. I have eyes everywhere, Sherlock. Call her, and when she asks if she can do anything for you, take her up on her offer."
Another person speaks up; this time a woman. "We'll be keeping him like this until we believe the swelling has gone down enough for him to become conscious again. I'm Dr. Andrews," she holds out her hand as well and Sherlock shakes it.
"Have a nice night, Mr. Holmes. He'll be fine here if you'd like to go home for the night." And with that, she's gone.
The cab ride is quick, giving that Sherlock paid the cabbie to step on it. The door to 221B is open before Sherlock is out of the cab.
On the elevator down he texts Mycroft: 'I'll be needing a car.'
Time ticks away. Slowly. Each tick of the clock laughs at Sherlock's best attempts to stay awake. He's so tired. He hasn't slept in ages. John calls it 'being human.' Sherlock calls it 'annoying.' The ticks and tocks of the clock grind into Sherlock's ears, driving him into insanity. But still, each tick and each tock make him sleepier and sleepier. Time couldn't possibly drag on any slower. When he finally does gather up the energy to look at his watch, it's four in the morning. He's gotten this far but Sherlock's only human after all. Despite his best efforts, despite how hard he's fighting it, Sherlock's eyes slip closed and his mind melts into a deep slumber.
"Sherlock, it's not you fault that I got shot."
"I'll go get Rosie all loaded up in it, why don't you take this out to the car," Stella hands the diaper bag to Sherlock and he walks through the door to the street, grabbing the crib on the way. The car Mycroft sent for him is waiting, the soft hum of the engine sounding. The driver gets out and takes the bag and crib from Sherlock and puts them in the trunk, then opens the door for Sherlock to get in.
"Turn it off."
"Calm down, Sherlock! She's fine! Stella was at the house when I stopped by. I told her what had happened and she said she'd stay with Rosie."
The door to John's room opens again and the nurse enters. He raises his eyebrows in curious expectation.
Sherlock knows there's more. "But."
One more thing for Sherlock to add to his list of things to worry about.' John, plus nightmares, does not equal compatibility.
She calls out from inside her flat, "Didn't make any dear, just could tell you wanted to be alone. You're an easy tell."
"Right, yes of course."
BAM! Another gunshot. Something hits the floor. John can't move to look. He can't move at all.
"I'm fine. Do you have a key to John's house?"
The rest of the nurses swarm upon John. Each delving onto a different machine. They even took the ventilator. Sherlock questions them on this, "Won't he be needing that to breathe?" he asks, raising a hand and finger to point.
"Sherlock, I think I owe-"
He freezes. Sherlock knows John figured it out and came to the hospital, but he hadn't thought about this. The knife isn't stabbed into the mantle; it's laying on its side. Sherlock whisks over, the DVD isn't there; John watched it then. How could he miss this? Of course! How could he have possibly missed it! What's wrong with him? The TV isn't exactly as he left it. And there, tucked away behind it, is the envelope. The envelope that contains the video that broke Sherlock to watch, and most likely destroyed John.
"Well, I presume he will be during his recovery. And in all honesty, he doesn't have the money to hire a caretaker, and he knows that. Plus, he's fallen out with his sister, so no place there. It only makes sense. Why, do you think he won't want to?"
"I'm sorry."
"Incredibly lucky is what he is. If the bullet were any further to the left... well, he wouldn't be here. We've hooked him up to a ventilator, heart monitor, colostomy system, and he's being given a high dosage of the usual anesthetics to keep him under," the doctor waves his hand at each system as he names them.
Footsteps roar through the hallway. There are hands on Sherlock, pulling him away. Sherlock pulls back, he doesn't want to leave John's side.
"If you speak to him, he'll hear you. I was a skeptic too at first, but there's been research done on it; real cases. Even an attending here has researched it. The say it promotes a faster recovery. You might try it."
There is so much blood coming from John. Sherlock tries desperately to slow its steady stream, but to no avail. He knows that bleeding is one of the things that can kill John here and now, so he applies more pressure. Sherlock's hands are drenched in blood and so is the rest of him. Sherlock can feel John's breath slowing.
And there it is. John sits up a little, his lips parting a fraction of an amount, just enough for a little air to seep in. "Me neither."
"No. I'll see you soon."
John watches Sherlock swallow and keeps going. "Bits and pieces only. You were there. You..." His eyes dart back and forth across his blankets and he tries to remember. "You were crying."
"Hello?"
"I see. Then when will I be graced with His Majesty's presence?"
Sleep is an elusive thief for Sherlock that night.
This thought hits Sherlock like a load of bricks.
Come back to me."
John sinks into his bed with a sigh. All hell has officially broken lose. And he thought things couldn't get any crazier. Now he's lying in a hospital bed shot by who? Eurus Holmes? Does Sherlock really have a sister? Why hasn't he ever talked about her? So many questions race through his mind. It's exhausting, feeling like you never know what's really going on.
He could leave. Just leave and slip quietly back into Baker Street. Come only when called- if he's called. John might prefer that. But he couldn't. He couldn't do that. He can't allow himself to that. John never left, so he won't either. But then again, Sherlock never actually wanted him to leave. Now, John might be better off if he did.
Sherlock can't loose John. He has just gotten him back. Not now. There are so many things he needs to say.
Sherlock brushes his teeth and changes into his pajamas. He's not tired but he could wake Rosie if he stays in the living room, so he might as well sleep.
Sherlock's eyes flit up to John. He looks so peaceful, his face so placid. Sherlock knows every line of John's face, every hollow and every turn. Expressionless now, but a cabaret of emotions anywhere else. This isn't fair.
John sighs in slight exasperation, "Look, Sherlock, it wasn't your fault, alright? Everything isn't always
"Is your hearing going already, big brother? I said what I said. No."
Sherlock is not having Mycroft's games. At all. 'Your sarcasm is hilarious, Mycroft. Can you detect mine? "
"It's no excuse. You were only trying to help."
"Sherlock, put the bullets away. I've come unarmed. I'm here to explain what's happened.
Remembering his deal with Mycroft, Sherlock calls Molly; bracing himself for the onslaught of questions. The other end of the line clicks on after one ring.
"You say she was a new gallery attendant? Well, as a new employee she was still getting the hang of things. In that case, she was probably only monitoring paintings. But she got bored and was bound to touch a painting or two without gloves.  Therefore, that's exactly what she did. By probably touching an assortment of paintings she accumulated a good enough amount of residue on her fingers, and when lunch came she didn't bother to wash her hands. She ingested a large enough amount of toxic compounds from paints to irritate her allergy and had a delayed allergic reaction until three-thirty-seven. Bam, dead by the afternoon."
"They finished earlier than expected; just a few minutes ago actually. Guess that's a good sign? They've moved him to a room in the ICU. They said someone arranged for him to have his own. Did you?"
'And why would I ever do that?'
"I think you do. Really, Sherlock, go fetch her."
It's not ten minutes until Molly is sitting next to Sherlock. He doesn't look up when turns to him. She places a tentative hand upon his.
There is a pause before Sherlock speaks his next word. He takes shuttering breath but no words come.
"You mean the..."
"Nightmares?"
Having enough of the memories that really hurt more than they bring joy, he gets up. He doesn't do anything else quite yet. He just stands in front of the chair. Then, silently, he walks over and sits in the chair next to John's bed. Just sits. Nothing else. More time passes, Sherlock doesn't know how long, but he knows it has since a new round of nurses start to come in.
This time Sherlock snaps his whole head up to meet John's eyes, waiting for him to continue.
John moves his eyes to look at Sherlock, "Well, I guess as well as I can be."
"Ah, Mr. Holmes. I'm going to guess you're here for Rosie? Do come in."
With the internet only proving skeptical, Sherlock sets aside his laptop, stands, and shuffles off to his room. His sheets are cold and feel rough against his skin. Every creak and crack from the flat sounds louder than it should, and Sherlock's mind melts into empty agitation.
"He'll be alright, Sherlock. You two always are."
"John, nice to see you recovering well."
"John!? John you have to stay strong! Please! For Rosie! For Mrs. Hudson," Sherlock chokes back a sob. Tears he didn't even know were there are falling on John's blank face, "for me."
"You were grieving."
"Fine! Are you happy? I'll leave John all alone with nurses and doctors who have yet to prove themselves competent."
He's lost his attention now. Sherlock's looking past John and into the corner of the wall, no longer listening.
Eventually, Sherlock does pull away, but he doesn't lose contact completely. He takes Mrs. Hudson's hand that was in his hair and gives it a gently squeeze.
Lestrade raises his hands up in innocence, "Alright! Alright. Sorry, geez... I'm sorry, Sherlock. About everything."
"Things aren't good when you're not around. For me, I mean. It seems I've become a bit...
Sherlock stops fiddling with his jacket and fearfully looks up at John. He breathes in a shattered breath, and barely whispers,
"This should be everything you'll be needing. Bottles, formula, wipes, diapers, clothes, blankets, soaps. Right there's a crib," Stella points to a folded up crib by the door, "And this is her favorite stuffed animal," she holds up a little stuffed bumblebee before putting it into the diaper bag, "Should I grab the car seat?"
Sherlock flips through the folder, eyes skimming up and down the pages, analyzing evidence. "Foreign substances?"
Dr. Wallace holds out his hand to shake and Sherlock takes it.
"You look exhausted. You should get some rest, we both should. We can talk tomorrow."
The words are like sandpaper on his tongue.
But you have to wake up. That's the deal. I couldn't live knowing I did this to you. I couldn't live, I couldn't live without you.
"No."
"Alright, Mycroft, what?"
Sherlock hangs up and descends down the stairs. He grabs his laptop and it's charger and the charger to his phone, then is gone in less then fifteen minutes since he arrived.
"The hospital or me?"
"Oh. Well.... thank you Molly."
"The nurse brought some water in. If you want some I think we can get another cup."
"Sherlock Holmes! Promise. Me."
"That's usually the case, now be do be quiet Sherlock. And actually, I think I'll stand, thank you."
Deep breath. Another deep breath. A self-pitiful sigh. What was he doing? A fold inward of the lips, and then, "Ok.
Sherlock is breathing heavily. His fingers are clenched tightly into fists at his sides. Lestrade looks shocked at the outburst.
"Yeah, alright. I'll head over when you get back."
"That's no way to go about this! Hope, it's all we really have in the end. Ugh, there goes me with the meaningful stuff. You kind of pick up stuff like that after a while with this kind of job. I should be off. Press the call button if you need anything."
"Hm?" the nurse questions as she fiddles with John's heart rate monitor.
"Hard to say. The scan itself should only take about fifteen minutes, but we're pretty busy today so CT could be backed up, which means they might have to wait a bit."
Mrs. Hudson hugs Sherlock tighter. But then springs back, tears in her eyes, "Oh, our poor John. He'll be fine though, right? You two always are. I'll make you some tea."
Then he gets brave.
"John."
"Wha- hm? Yes?"
"There we've seen everything," Sherlock's voice sounds different not coming from the laptop's speakers, "I'll just-"
"No, here let me," Sherlock stands and swiftly rounds the bed and takes the cup and pitcher before John can get to it. He pours the cool water into the cup and hands it to John. It lingers intermittently between their hands before they both pull away, one hand with a cup, one hand empty.
"Mycroft."
"Yes but it's nothing unusual—"
"Yes, dear?"
John breathes out an 'oh' as he see Sherlock breaking down, tearing up in front of him. "Sherlock... Come here..."
"Hey."
"Known what?"
'Mycroft.'
Sherlock feels lightheaded again. He needs a distraction. Reaching into his shirt pocket, Sherlock pulls out his phone and texts Lestrade, 'Hospital. Cases. Lunch. Now. -SH' And as he's putting his phone away, he stops and retracts his hand, turning on his phone to send another text. 'Please. ,' it reads. Within minutes, Lestrade has sent back a text. 'On my way.'
Sherlock gazes out the window for a while, even after the sun has disappeared. He views the city nightlife begin to trickle out. Soon, buildings that weren't open before will light up, and crowds of people will flood restaurants and bars. Ordinary people with ordinary lives. No Moriarty, no Magnussen, no... no chance for ending up shot and in a coma lying in a hospital bed because of your best friend. Lucky them.
Sherlock is searching John's face, thinking over what John has just offered him. He needs to answer, John is waiting for an answer.
The nurse nods her head, "All day."
Now alone, alone with John and alone with his thoughts, Sherlock's scared. He stands against back wall directly across from the silent, sleeping figure of John. His heels firmly planted against the wall. It's only eight. He needs to distract himself. The silence is overwhelming. Why did he decide to talk to John, he feels worse now. Mycroft's words from years ago come back to him, 'Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock.' He should have listened to him. Sherlock let it all in because it felt so new, so good. But Sherlock's mission to ignore Mycroft has only made everything worse. Maybe Mycroft is the smart one.
"There will be nurses here at night, and you can come straight back in the morning. Promise me, Sherlock. I won't have it any other way!"
"Molly! Who has Rosie!?"
"That's a wonderful idea! But is the hospital the best place for a baby? With all those diseases and such..."
"Good morning, Mr. Holmes. How are you holding up?" a male doctor extends his hand and Sherlock shakes it.
"Yes, it is."
"Good day, Mycroft. Give my best wishes to the Queen."
Until he does.
"Hey. Got us some dinner," Molly says as she walks in, holding up a takeout bag. She sets another bag down, presumably filled with John's things.
"Yeah," Sherlock folds the corner of his lips in. He doesn't want to leave. Not again. But if John want's to rest...
Lestrade's face goes solemn. He looks Sherlock dead in the eye. Sherlock butts in before Lestrade can say anything.
"John wouldn't want me there."
Sherlock stops before he goes in. There are voices coming from inside the room. Good, the doctors are there. He enters the room and what he sees causes his mouth to part the smallest amount. There's is John, hooked up to machines left and right. He looks so frail and broken.
Sherlock delivers a noncommittal grunt and shifts back back to staring at the wall beyond John's left shoulder. Mycroft turns his attention to John, staring right into John with his cold, knowing eyes.
Dr. Wallace (Sherlock can now remember his name because his oversized mouth), is, oddly, beaming. His grin stretches from ear to ear.
"Really, don't worry about it—"
He turns his head towards Mrs. Hudson, raising his eyebrows in question.
"But it only counts if you did. You saved me Sherlock."
"Mrs. Hudson is the tea ready?"
Sherlock scans the room for a harder target. His eyes settle on a young, male nurse.
"If he has to wait, will he be monitored?"
"Hey," John leans his head down to meet Sherlock's drifting gaze, "You can just sleep here if you want. Bed might be a bit small but I can move over."
"Sherlock, might I have a word with you in the hall before I go?" Mycroft manages to get out as his coat is being thrown upon him and he's been shuffled out the door.
"Oh, well he's been here since early yesterday morning. Stayed up 'till around four this morning. Practically comes in at the crack of dawn every day. Doesn't want to leave either, but he's got the baby at home, you know? She's yours right? Darling thing."
"That's the first time I've ever seen you cry, you know."
"You can just tell us."
Sherlock doesn't respond nor make any intention to, he just stands there, staring down at John from his wounded eyes.
"It'll all turn out, I promise you."
With the crib in the living room, Sherlock keeps his door open to make sure he'll be able to hear Rosie if she awakens; he's normally a light sleeper anyway so it shouldn't matter.
There's a rustle beside the bed and John can see Sherlock slowly waking up. Sherlock blinks a few times before his eyes open wide. His mouth parts the slightest bit.
"Eh, never mind. Go on."
"That's good. I'm guessing your not going home then tonight?"
"No, it has to be you, Sherlock."
Sherlock promised Molly he'd go home. Since when did he keep promises like that? It's eight-thirty. Mrs. Hudson will be wondering where he is, he might as well go home. He appreciates the motherly attitude she has towards him, even if he doesn't show it all the time.
I just... just wake up. Alright, John? If not for me, then for Rosie and Mrs. Hudson. Because they're all still here, waiting for you to come back. Can you just do that, John?"
It's nearly midnight when Sherlock finishes. He's not thoroughly convinced, but enough where he can't completely dismiss the idea just yet. It still seems useless or silly to him though.
"Would you like me to list them all?"
"Are you alright? You, your hands..." John points to Sherlock's long, slender fingers gripping the arms of his chair for dear life.
"You can go get her. I'm sure John would rather her be with you and Mrs. Hudson at the flat."
Rosie's awake presently, and happily giggling in Mrs. Hudson's lap, gleefully unaware of the present circumstances. Sherlock is sitting in a chair besides John's bed. John looks so much more like himself now that all the machines are gone and there isn't a tube stuck down his throat. He'll be awake soon, and by soon, really hours.
"I'll give you the room. I could use a cuppa anyway." And with that Mrs. Hudson scoops up Rosie and shuts the door behind her.
It's late, and all Sherlock can hear outside is the faint, distant sound of sirens and driving cars. How did all this happen to them? What sent he and John on this course of doom? Could it have been prevented? Probably not, Sherlock and John have always had a way of intermingling with trouble.
Sherlock and John meet eyes and John tells him. John decides to tell him what's been unfolding in his mind since he woke up.
John's eyes begin to flutter shut.
Sherlock's eyes focus behind his reflection and skim the glittering skyline. Various colored dots scatter the horizon and central London. All that projects from the hospital is the cold, artificial lights from within.
"What's all that noise? Is everything all right?"
"I see. How long do you think he'll be like this?"
"Sherlock—"
"....Alright"
"Car seat?"
"He'll be—" says Molly.
"...Except I can't tell what parts were real or not. I had this crazy... dream, I guess. You had a sister and she was working with Moriarty. We were in this, this... this asylum-like place and- and she made us complete these awful... 'games' is what I think I remember her saying—"
"Sorry, my apologies," Sherlock gives a half smile to the nurse handling the ventilator. She smiles back and continues with her work.
"Dr. Andrews—"
Sherlock stays like this for an hour. He would have sat longer if Molly hadn't come back when she did.
"The doctors believe his swelling will have gone down enough that they can begin to reduce the anesthetics."
"Sherlock?"
Sherlock briskly walks through the door, shuts it behind him, and looks Mrs. Hudson in the eyes before pulling her into a hug. His voice, deep and quiet, recounts, "John was shot. He's in surgery. Doctors say he'll be out soon. I'm here to change and grab some things."
Sherlock starts to feel a little dizzy. Is it exhaustion? Maybe. Lack of food? Possibly. Nerves? Could be, but it's never the case. He sits down in his chair next to John's bed, gripping the arm rest. The doctors seem to get the message.
Sherlock's cock was twitching. His balls were pulled up tight against his body. The sting of penetration should have dampened his ardour, but the need to have John inside him had overruled that reaction, and now he was almost on the verge of orgasm. He had to regain control of himself. But John seemed to sense his distress and didn't give him a chance to recover; instead he planted his hands on Sherlock's hips and rolled his hips upwards, pushing himself deep. Sherlock yelped— although it was really more of a manly groan— and let his head hang, his mouth fallen open. John beamed up at him.
Until, apparently, I did ask. It only took three bottles of Chateau Lefite, a pint of good doctor's brandy, and a country cemetery. I'd been carrying those rings for years. That his fit him was a miracle.
"It would distract you from the real work we have to do, which is proving that arsehole wrong. Although, honestly, the whole thing is weirdly restrained. He didn't have a go at our personal lives nearly as much as I thought he was going to."
myself be distracted was considerably greater.
the way to run a profitable business."
"I mean, seriously," John went on, waving his fork in the air, "that fucking sob story at the end of
"This is why I don't think your idea of a set menu is going to work," John said.
He looked at me, the shadow of his hat falling half across his face. "Is that why you married me?" he asked. "Because I suited you?"
"Place downstairs needs a lot of work."
"John," Sherlock said, putting his food down and staring at John, open astonishment on his face. "What were you going to
“It isn’t,” he agrees, a murmur in my ear, “but after that display I’d be shocked if anyone has any lingering doubts.”
John rested one hip against the deep fryer. "You two know each other from school, I'm guessing?"
"Always," John said.
can make that leap of logic."
"Shall we go to bed?" I asked, breathless, against his mouth.
"Lukewarm reception."
My brother snorted. "No, he didn't."
It would be very cruel. John Watson's heart would not stand it. I couldn't let him suffer like that for the sake of my ego. Not again.
"People won't make
"I haven't just lied to him, have I?" John asked, as Sherlock grimaced at the burn. "You're not… you're all right, aren't you?" Despite Moriarty's pointed remarks in their kitchen, cocaine wasn't exactly an uncommon substance in the food business; the long hours a kitchen demanded, the high levels of stress, the constant litany of 'go faster, do better, push harder.' John had known more than a few chefs over the years who did lines in the toilets to keep their chins up. He'd never liked it, though he'd ignored Harry's alcohol abuse long enough. It wasn't his place, really. Except that Sherlock was his partner, and he felt like he needed to do better by him than he had by Harry.
I fold myself into the seat and close the door behind me. My breath steams out on my exhale and the glass windows begin to fog. The handholds that I watched Lestrade steer with are chilly under my hands, but they too respond to my touch. A low rumble starts up somewhere inside the body of the vehicle, and the interior light goes out. It is replaced by a luminescent panel of dials and switches that would not be out of place in a mad scientist's laboratory. I don't know where to begin. I always left the driving to Watson and his little Ford. My heart is pounding. I'm useless. Everything I have learned, everything I have ever known, is useless in this place.
I am guilty of this myself, as evidenced by my willingness to lock us both in a toilet at a club and have my way with him. I press one last kiss to his collarbone and kneel.
Sherlock snorted and turned away to put the mushrooms down. "Why are you here?" he demanded.
"Fine," he said, "but I'm not watching you gellify anything just now."
Then he went stiff and still, his breath stuck in his throat. I felt the hot pulse of his emission against my shirt and my cock, and it set my own orgasm off at once. We groaned and panted together, making a mess of one another, and his still-slowly working fist drew it out to several long seconds of pleasure.
Sherlock gave him a squeeze instead and looked down at where his cock was moving in and out.  John felt his face heat and had to look back down at the bed. Sherlock was quiet, only his ragged breathing giving away how close he was. John jerked his cock a little faster; he couldn't catch up to Sherlock, but he could feel the pleasure coiling up again. Sherlock's rhythm was gradually speeding up, despite his attempts to pace himself to John's request. The room was thick with the smell of sex, the scent of shampoo layered underneath it.
"By Jove," I gasped.
Holmes had even worked under Raymond Blanc for a little while in 2008, which had resulted in a whole YouTube playlist of videos of him making outrageously rude remarks to other chefs, restaurant patrons, and the restaurant floor manager. John found each of them more ridiculous than the last, but every single one appeared to be based on an accurate observation or fair critique about that person, done in the moment, as he'd done to John.
right all the time.
Instantly Sherlock's arms came up and around him, and John found himself crushed against Sherlock's body. Sherlock kissed like he'd never heard of foreplay, and the deep, dirty thrust of his tongue made John moan in surprise. John slid his hand up into Sherlock's curls and held on, relishing Sherlock's answering groan. Sherlock's hands spread out across his back, one between his shoulder blades and the other broad across the small of his back; he held John to him and kissed him until he was breathless. He tasted like smoked mushrooms, and the smell of the kitchen downstairs had been replaced by the more delicate scent of his shampoo and aftershave. John wanted to devour him. He dug his fingers deeper into Sherlock's hair, drawing another moan from him, and fisted his other hand in Sherlock's button-down shirt. He'd seen Sherlock change once from the dress shirt into his chef coat, and the sight of the skin-tight white T-shirt he'd had on underneath had been torture of the best variety. John wanted to see it again.
Tears sting Sherlock's eyes. He blinks them away, burying them back. Now is not the time.
"Yes, yes, very lucky. What about post-leave side effects?"
"I'll be there in a few."
Sherlock's not drowsy either. He's wide awake, his brain on high alert. He needs to make plans for tomorrow. Rosie will most likely stay with Mrs. Hudson while Sherlock goes to the hospital. He'll talk to the doctors and discuss course of recovery. Maybe Lestrade will have a few cases Sherlock can take a look at.
"I'm assuming you're Mr. Holmes?"
"I remember. When I was bleeding out, I remember it."
"I don't know."
"I think could be a good idea. Letting him know there are people waiting for him to wake up."
Once Mrs. Hudson leaves, Sherlock prepares Rosie's crib. This seemingly menial task is proving difficult when he has a a baby on one hip and only one free hand. Sherlock lays a soft blue blanket down first, and slowly and gently lays Rosie down on it.
fault. I mean, don't get me wrong, a lot of things are, but not this. Not this time. Stop taking credit where it isn't due, ok? I mean, really."
"Yeah, we can spare the niceties, Mycroft."
"JOHN! John, you have to wake up! Open your eyes! Please! They're here! JOHN!"
Sherlock and Lestrade go over nearly ten cases, each further convincing Sherlock of the uselessness of Scotland Yard. Passing by nurses shoot odd glances into the room when the see Sherlock and Lestrade reenacting murders with straws and pens.
Sherlock's eyes move to John and he bites the inside of his cheek.
"I'll bring the tea up when it's done, darling!" She waves her hand and she's off into her kitchen.
"What if the swelling doesn't go down?" Sherlock must know.
Sherlock walks over to his chair besides the bed and sits down. John shifts to face him. They sit in these positions until John speaks a few moments later.
"You can't possibly think John hates you."
Sherlock looks at John's hand. Then at John's face. And back again, eyes resting on John's hand. Then, ever so cautiously, Sherlock brings his hand and rests it softly in John's. John wraps his fingers around the side of Sherlock's hand and Sherlock returns the gesture.
"Looks?"
"Care to do some more?"
Lestrade rolls his eyes with a sigh. Why does Sherlock have to be so... Sherlock sometimes? "Care to explain?"
"Well do go on then."
"Yeah, of course. Packed everything up and hauled it away. Not a thing left."
Lestrade straightens his face in understanding, "Sure, okay. I'll see you..."
"John, I... I would like to sincerely apologize for... all of it. Everything."
But their conversation was interrupted by a knock at the door. Wherever the conversation was going, it would have to wait.
When Sherlock finishes eating, or rather when he finishes eating five bites of Chow Mein, he pulls out his laptop and sits back in the chair by John's bed. He reads a few research papers before his laptop dies and he has to set it aside and plug it in. Without anything to distract him, Sherlock has to look at John, as much as it hurts. Sherlock wishes there was something he could do, but there isn't. All he can do is sit.
It's the waiting portion that Sherlock hates. When Sherlock is left alone with John, his feelings begin to bubble to the surface. All the pain and remorse. How could he ever make up for that? How could he ever apologize?
She simply smiles in return.
After that, Sherlock was left alone for a couple of hours. He mostly sat and thought; perched up in a tiny hospital chair, not making a single sound. Every once and a while he'd jot something down or send a text, mostly creating future experiments.
