Tony’s eyes are frighteningly blue, red rimmed as they are. After a beat of holding Steve’s gaze―the most he has managed in all of the days Steve has been here―he breaks away with a heavy breath that ends with a stifled cough. There are sentences in that gesture, but Steve hasn’t been able to read any of them.
He doesn’t have enough words to describe how much he’s missed Tony. “I still miss you.”
He steps unto the bowels of the quinjet, and Tony’s eyes fall shut in resignation. The rest of him seems to follow suit, going utterly limp in Steve’s arms. It’s heartbreaking―it
That finally gets them moving. Natasha is the first to step up, holding her arms up. “Hulk, let me see him.”
, when I know you know
“Before they notice I’m gone?” Tony sardonically asks, eyebrow quirked.
Steve’s thumping steps halt just to the side of the Hulk’s large frame. “We know they’re friendlies?” he asks to an unresponsive audience.
Rhodey tries for a smile, but it falls flat. He doesn’t think he can smile for Tony just yet―not with the memory of Tony flatlining still starkly fresh in his mind. “Yeah, you gonna have to try your words again, Tones. Not even my Tony-to-English dictionary could translate that.”
,” the voice pleads brokenly, thick with emotion, “
Tony’s lashes flutter, the whites of his eyeballs starting to show as they try to roll back. “Th’nk n’d to...sit d’wn…”
Steve knows now that he isn’t. This can’t be anything but real―any reality otherwise would just be too cruel.
Tony sighs dramatically. “Why does everyone keep saying that? Did the bad tan I got on Titan ruin my good looks?”
“I dreamt about you,” Tony returns. His lashes are fluttering, the spark in his eyes fading with sleep. “Every damned day on that hospital bed.” He jerks slightly, trying to stay awake. “Don’t take me back there,” he pleads.
It’s the wrong thing to say. Hulk turns the arm holding Tony close away and leans forward, looming his face close to Natasha’s. She doesn’t flinch, but he can smell the fear off of her. He pokes her shoulder with a thick finger, and she stumbles back, more startled than hurt. “Hulk know what Spider did.” He rises, folds his free arm back around his charge. “Hulk know what ‘Vengers did. Tin Man
“Let’s give them a taste of what they’ve been so desperately chasing,” Danvers says.

Tony jerks his knee back and away. He still hasn’t looked at Steve again, prefering to stare at a point beyond Steve’s shoulder.
Except, of course, when he makes off-handed comments like
Steve folds his hand over his other one, and it is the unnatural heat that he can still feel there that seals his fate.
Bruce breathes easier. “Thank god. He scared the shit out of me, waking up the way he did.”

a’me. ‘Uce’z there.”
“Be nice to the good doctor, Tony,” Rhodey chides. He settles next to Steve with the package of jellos on his lap. “Or I’ll withhold privileges.”
“You crash landed on a ship. You were―you were just lying there, on the floor.” He doesn’t say,
“Last set of stitches, okay?” Bruce replies in turn. Tony jumps, ever so slightly, every time he pulls a stitch, but there’s nothing more he can do for the pain.
Steve is not allowed to be there.
Lila, who had so far been utterly entranced by the goings-on up on screen, frowns between Clint and Natasha. “What happened to Uncle Tony?”
He walks the miles to the hospital. There are less and less people gathered at the hospital doorsteps as the days go by, though no less things. Steve makes sure none of them notice him. He doesn’t think he can handle any well-meaning wishes right now.
Hulk snarls at her, but, this time, it is almost playful. “Punny Banner stupid,” he says. “Worry too much.”
He’d been head over heels done for since then.
“Hulk,
They both turn to their last companion.
He packs all of his suit of armors, minus some he leaves to Rhodey and Pepper, leaves the company under Pepper’s name and S.H.I.E.L.D. under Dugan’s, erases the S.H.R.A. database from all servers except the one in his head―and then exiles himself to the dark side of the Moon, where a ready-built mansion-forte lies waiting like the embrace of a coffin.
“What’s the last thing you remember?”
“―do look like shit, Shellhead. What the hell did you do?”
,” Carol snaps, electric blue eyes wild and angry. She stabs a pointed finger at his chest. “
, he commands and feels her pleased hum in reply.
“I still caught you.”
He expels a heavy breath, feeling the weight of his actions, both past and current, settling even deeper upon his shoulders. It’s a weight he will never be rid of―he can only learn to build himself up stronger under it, to try to stand a little straighter. “I can never apologize enough. And I’m sorry for this, too,” he continues, hoping Tony will hear the sincerity in his voice and believe it enough, “because I know you don’t want this, any of this, but I’m selfish enough not to want to see you die when I know that there are people out there with the means and the will to help you. And if it means that I lose my friendship with you―then, I...god, Tony, as long as you’re alive and doing all right, then I could take all of your hate, all of your spite, and die a happy man.”
and his weight suddenly sinks against Steve like a puppet’s strings cut.
Steve has a half-second to panic before he feels Tony’s arms come up in what is quite clearly an embrace. His heart thuds faster at the realization. This isn’t the first time that Tony has consciously sought out physical comfort, but very few other times has it felt as intimate as this.
Thor and Hulk, along with their precious cargo, take off into the sky.
“Please,” he whispers fervently into the unrelenting silence,
“And this is why Thor is my favourite.”
Bruce’s eyes lose their focus from their work, flitting over briefly to Rhodes and then to the monitors. Neither have changed. “Tell me he passed out.”
It’s not the grand entrance they were expecting.
He brushes the backs of his fingers along the exposed skin of Tony’s neck, careful, and his suspicion is confirmed. Tony’s fever is up again. He tucks his arms closer to himself and grips his wrist tightly, coiled tension running through his body. “Why didn’t you tell me your fever was getting worse?” he demands, though his irritation is belied by how softly he speaks.
He gives himself a few seconds to stare at Tony, at his unknowing face and trusting body. Even as sickly pale and clammy with fever as he is, he is still ethereal in his beauty―he imagines that even when the man is old and white-haired, he’ll still be the most handsome man on the block. Steve manages a fleeting smile at the thought.
“Uhh,” Bruce stutters. His hands don’t stop working seamlessly, pulling hair-thing strings taut with precise movements. “I’d like to say I could vouch for the guy, but I met him the same day Tony did.”
he brings them all back. He
Blake, dutifully already strapped in with the large tote of medical equipment on his lap, gives Spider-Man a wary eye. “Just don’t throw up on me.”
The hospital staff sends him away every day. Sometimes it’s the same anesthesiologist that had been in the operating room with Tony, sometimes one of the nurses. Yesterday, it had been the surgeon herself.
The doorsteps to the hospital get swarmed by people. Every night, they hold a vigil, waiting for a word that Tony was still alive. They leave gifts, flowers, and cards; Steve keeps the ones written and drawn by children. He knows how much Tony loves kids, that it would mean so much more to him than a teddy bear or dying flowers. There are the protestors, too, of course, the same ones that accused Tony of being the devil’s spawn during what has been coined as the “Civil War,” courtesy of Ben Urich. Those voices are quickly drowned out by their opposers, the people who call Tony an innocent man, a heroic man.
College got a little busier than expected - I'm so sorry that it took so long to post this!
Rhodey shakes his head. He’s careful to keep his hands, still bracing Tony’s body, his arm, steady and as still as possible. “Don’t sweat it. I’ve seen worse,” he lies.
“Whoever is giving him his facts is outdated,” Tony explains with tired, dragging vowels. He stops there for a moment, his brows knitting with pain
Carol had been standing, still in the tatters of the day’s battle, waiting―shamelessly eavesdropping―until the meeting had concluded. Arms folded over her chest, eyes red rimmed, and expression thundering. She had a white card, thick and small like that of a business card, held tersely between the fold of two fingers.
Steve’s cry is inhuman. It’s wretched with pain―and boiling
“Sure,” Natasha mutters, just barely loud enough for Steve’s ears to pick up, “‘nuts.’” There’s a double entendre to her words―Steve doesn’t know if he wants to decipher what she means.
’ he mouths back and then returns his attention to the screen to purposefully miss the subsequent, silent insults being thrown his way.
Clint snickers. “Hey, see―he’s already good for you. He brought some colour to your cheeks!”
Just the thought of the man dead in a ditch somewhere―thank you, Tony, for that visual―has cold fear crawling through his veins, overrunning his heart with forceful palpitations.
’ll love me here.”
Bruce goes taut with tension. “Tony, I know this is really hard for you right now, but I need you to
“Are you talking to Tony?” Carol interjects, her tone of voice lifting eagerly.
Tony’s eyes are just as blue as he remembers them. “They wouldn’t let me see you,” he says as if that is enough of an explanation, his voice a shaky croak of breath. He looks tired enough to collapse.
Steve is frozen in place.
Steve insists.

“Yeah, okay,” Tony voices over the sudden stillness of the room. “Can someone restrain my mother before she breaks her hand on Cap’s jaw?”

she hisses in the privacy of her brain.
“Боже мой,” Natasha breathes, the dread that had been hovering over her shoulders suddenly weighing her down. “Someone get a hold of Carol Danvers. I’ll assemble a secondary team and head out―anyone who isn’t dead or dying can join. Clint, you don’t have a choice; you’re coming with. Widow out.”
He gets past the first set of sliding doors and is met with Colonel Rhodes.
Steve has dreams where Tony visits him in his sleep. He sleeps worse on those nights.

He releases a gust of air as he comes to a stop at the cockpit. His lungs feel constricted, heavy, with what he is forcing Tony to do. “It’s going to be okay, Tony,” he tries to reassure, but even to his own ears the words ring hollow. Steve doesn’t like to think of it, but Tony’s rebuttals that there is nothing left for him on Earth...There is truth in it, blatant enough to be unable to be completely denied. Quite the vast majority of the superhero community has turned its back on one of its members, either willingly demonizing him or trying their hardest to pretend as if he doesn’t exist. In light of recent events―the manhunt Norman Osborn has put under way, namely―he can understand the latter as a need for survival, since the handful who have chosen to remain close to Tony are currently being hunted down across the world. None of that is even to speak about the fact that Tony’s position as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. or his company, along with most of his assets for that matter, are null and void.
In the next moment, they’re all rushing forward as the Hulk reaches into the ship and begins to slide, delicately, a hand under Tony’s torso.
“Hulk with Tin Man,” Hulk insists.
Clint’s eyebrows shoot up. “Wow, I
Fallon tries to speak over the crowd, jaunting quickly to meet Tony at the center of stage. They shake hands, Tony with an easy smile and Fallon ready to fall head over heels.
There’s an irony in there, he thinks. Steve knows perfectly well what he would have done had those civilians not gotten between him and Tony.
Steve comes every day.
“Yeah,” Clint says, as if the fact that Thor is sitting on the floor like a loyal guard dog makes that debatable. He gestures behind himself, at the woman, as well as he can, what with the entourage of gifts he brings. “This is Amanda Strong―Armstrong, whatever.”
Steve frowns. In this, he is old hat at reading Tony’s body language―after all, there is nothing more familiar in Tony Stark than Tony Stark’s hate for his own self. Where pride and greed are the downfall in others, this is Tony’s. Unable to see beyond what he has been taught to learn from the earliest of his years. “Hey,” he says gently, gripping onto Tony’s knee, “whatever you are thinking right now? I can tell you you’re wrong. I hate what I did to you, that I’ve turned my back on you on the times when I should have offered a helping hand the most, and I hate even more that I’ve been part of the role that drove you all the way out here. I―I was so angry―I was
“Cats are not synonymous with panthers, Tony.”
Steve’s eyes lower to the floor, away from that piercing gaze, and Tony huffs an exasperated breath that somehow dispels the moment.
Tony smiles at her. “Yeah, I can’t tell where it came from, either. Definitely has nothing to do with the woman who just slapped Captain America across the face.”
with a suit of armor that’s shot to hell. It doesn’t matter that he fought with the best of them and somehow ended up vertically on his own two feet.

is alive. And fervently refuses to step anywhere near the Avenjet.
The President offers Tony Stark his sincerest well wishes.
“We heard you the first five thousand times, Clint!” Natasha snaps. The man trapped between her thighs gurgles for air; she twists upside-down, her hold a steady trap, and uses the momentum to launch the man at the woman coming around the corner with her gun raised. Both topple into a tangled heap. “Osborn left sometime in the morning; one guess where he’s headed.”
Tony stares into her obsidian eyes and prays to Thor with all he has that her words bleed true. “Okay,” he sighs. He blinks at the ground, suddenly hazy and numb. “Okay,” he repeats and doesn’t know why.
.” He doesn’t mean the rawness to slip unbidden from his lips. The blood bubbles up in his throat, and a string of it slides down his chin before he has the sense of mind to swallow the copper back down.
” his voice rises higher, closing his eyes as the song seems to sweep through him. The camera is close enough now to count the many lashes that cast faint, red-tinted shadows over his cheeks. “
He finishes off by strapping Tony into the regular quinjet harness, though he has to do some maneuvering what with one of Tony’s arms in a criss-cross. The shivering has died down to finer tremors, but Steve still tucks the blanket, folded in double, over him. “Are you comfortable?” he asks as he finishes making sure the blanket won’t slide off with all of the turbulence.
Bucky punched him square in the face; Osborn toppled backwards, unconscious. “Sorry,” he said, entirely unrepentant, “his voice was grating on my ears.”
“Is there a healer―a medic around here who can fix him,” he asks tonelessly to the room at large.
Steve mouth snaps shut at her tears, how desperate she is trying to hold back all of those pent up emotions. He gives her the moment she doesn’t ask for.
Norman Osborn grins with vengeful pleasure. “Gormley, you sound like my kind of guy.”
“That’s his choice, Carol. And it’s not a choice I look on fondly. He split us right in half―”
“It’s like you love me,” Tony scoffs.
Stark is pulling now.”
“I’m sorry, Mister Rogers,” the doctor says again, and there are tears gathering in her eyes. It was the first time she had seen what sometimes dragged in her patients, live on television, she had confessed earlier. There’s a sort of shellshock to people like her after violence unfolds, Steve has seen, to people who actually give a damn. “I really am.”
A section of the hull parts in half and folds inward. And there, lying so very still on the ship’s floor, is Tony Stark himself.
Tony sucks in a breath. And another, beating down the pain. The desperation. “Fuck off,” he mutters. It’s all the strength he has left.
He presses his forehead against Tony’s own.
He presses them ever closer, feels the warmth and solidness of the other man’s body―and something round and metallic digs into his sternum. Steve has half a moment of panic before he remembers: the RT. Tony’s new heart.
,” he breathes, the word startlingly clear. He stares up at Rhodey, then, and his eyes almost immediately begin to cloud over with gathering tears.
Hulk keep Tin Man safe. Tin Man return to Hulk.”
Tony doesn’t reply.
“Yes,” Osborn agrees, settling cozily back within the Iron Patriot, “twenty-six minutes away from all the secrets of the world’s smartest man, from
It was entirely luck that they found him, two weeks later.
Steve tries to contain his glee when Tony flaps a hand in the direction of Steve’s ear, but something on his face must have given him away going by the way Tony rolls his eyes good-naturedly.
He’s shivering.
Tony just shakes his head again, his closed eyelids squeezing tighter.
And, with that realization, he feels himself crumble under the weight of the world―his body folds over Tony’s unconscious form until his forehead comes to rest, consciously lightly, onto the center of Tony’s chest.
“Only because you have the worst puppy eyes,” Bruce replies. “The Other Guy was threatening to come out if we didn’t get you some
” Tony replies, his smile almost strained. “
His scrubs.
Tony shifts, slits of blue flickering open. “S’eve?” he rasps, sleep heavy.
Tony shakes his head fervently. There is not enough air in his world, in his lungs, to give voice the volumes of thoughts and reasons floating through his brain why Steve has every reason

Steve falls asleep to a video of Tony at an MIT conference.
The entirety of the world became witness to Osborn proceeding to beat the living shit out of Stark as each shouted word went unheard, as each punch and kick went unfelt. None of the agents nor the cameraman stepped in to stop the madman. None of them moved when Steve woke up and began to thrash in his bonds, when Steve’s voice became louder than the violence unfolding before the world.
Within the deafening noise of the crowd, Tony Stark’s graceful figure stands and snatches up an acoustic guitar that had been leaning against the side of the piano.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bruce says, and Steve falls to his knees.
Fallon is not the only one astounded by that titbit of information. That can’t be right. After several years living together, Steve thinks he would have noticed a talent like that. “
Apparently, Extremis intakes an overload of information that likes to divulge riddled messages to Tony in the form of
” The camera focuses on a different man standing behind a podium, who waves lazily.
“You bet I do.”
Steve nods back. “We’ll meet you there.”
“It’s bad,” Carol breathes haggardly into the phone. “It’s really, really fucking bad, Steve.”
But his cry is futile. He’s chained, arms bound high against his back. He’s struggling furiously, and his anchor, the thick, metal strut atop the wheels of one of the quinjets, creaks with his desperate strength. With the amount that he’s struggling, Bucky wouldn’t be surprised to find if Steve has dislocated both of his shoulders.

“Yeah,” Rhodes says, like there’s something caught in his throat. “Yeah, he did.”

He knows exactly which he will have to choose.
out there,
Last week, Carol―surprisingly accompanied by Thor, of all people―came to drop off the antivirus Richards and McCoy had managed to concoct in the short time they had. Their rather unannounced visit―which Steve later realized was a complete error of judgement―had spurred a panic attack so strong that it wasn’t until four days ago that Steve finally managed to pry Tony away from the safety of his lab.
“Hey,” Steve’s voice drifts quietly through the gray darkness. “I thought you went to bed?”
There was a situation like this long ago, Steve remembers, when they were all first aboard the helicarrier.
He coerces himself to draw a calming breath as he reaches up to his ear to cut off the two-way communication from the comm. “Tony,” he says, “for god’s sake―” It comes out more harshly than he intends, but he can’t find it in himself to apologize either. He doesn’t know how many times he has to tell Tony how desperately he cares for his well being, for Tony himself, before it’ll sink into his thick skull.
If he had stood by Tony’s side. If he had acted sooner. If he had trusted better. If he’d been a better friend. If he’d been less stubborn. If he’d listened to Tony more.
He knows what he did. And, suddenly, it curls him with shame.
Steve can see where this is going. “It’s not your fault, Peter.” If anyone’s, it’s his. And now all he has left is a series of
” Tony continues, “
All those repugnant mice who call themselves heroes, who hide behind their masks―their identities are
Rhodey blinks, and the haze falls from his eyes. “Yeah―yeah, sorry. I’m just…” He trails off, unable to put to words what seeing Tony like this has done to his heart.
The guilt withers it away.
“You really think anyone could have payed off Strong for something like that?” Natasha retorts, a thin-edge to her voice. “Much less, do you think Tony would have gone along with it, after everything that’s happened?”
He wants to be there, he wants to protest. He wants to be there if Tony starts to wake up. He needs to be there.
Amanda passes under the demigod’s arm, as well, biting into her lower lip to hold in her snort of laughter.
Tony had said it so flippantly that Steve had thought it arrogance, yet all it had been was a statement of fact. Steve rubs the side of his face, as if that would ease the fatigue of carrying a mountain of guilt. How many times did any one of the Avengers think Tony arrogant when the pure opposite was in play?
She pats him consolingly on the chest. “He needs a good man like you in his life.”
,” he finishes rattling off, and every Avenger is off like a shot.
“―and there must be a leak somewhere because Osborn came to the same conclusion himself.”
” Lila Barton’s voice resounds through the thin walls.
“But it’s the only way?” Rhodey prods. He cards his fingers again through the increasingly wetter strands of hair, trying, in whatever small way he can, to keep Tony’s mind off of the massive pain he must be in. “Who called the shots?”
―his sanity, his safety, his
Rhodey hefts a package. “One of the Doras dropped it off―I’m still surprised they don’t have jello around here.”
Natasha takes a fortifying breath and takes off after the other men. “This just keeps getting better,” she mutters sarcastically.
that the only reason why you’re so pissed off at him is because he didn’t fall back at your side like every other time before. You beat him near bloody dead, Steve,” she accuses, seething, “brushed aside every time he extended his hand to
He feels the soft quirk of Tony’s smile. “I always am when you’re around, big guy.” He catches Steve’s hand at his cheek, leans into the palm of his hand. He presses a soft kiss to the skin there.
Clint Barton clicks off the TV, scoffing at the air. “Oily scumbag.”
Steve cradles Tony’s head carefully as he lowers him down unto the copilot’s seat. Tony doesn’t struggle, doesn’t offer even the smallest of protests even as Steve takes his right wrist and tightens a cuff around it. He secures the other empty ring to the left armrest, purposefully making the position a harder one to wiggle out of. He knows Tony, and he wouldn’t put it past him to try something reckless to try to go back―his determination to keep Tony alive and healthy is perhaps only matched by Tony’s adamant reluctance to leave their lunar fort.
realise I actually need my brain, right? It’s very important if I’m gonna keep you in such a lavish lifestyle.”
“That’s it! I’m telling Pepper you said she nags. JARVIS, make a – mmpf!”
The cold doesn’t seem to have kept the city indoors, but none of the people appear to have any desire to linger. They push their way down the sidewalks, speak only to the ones they’re with, and none of them give a damn that they pass by the CEO of Stark Industries, the Black Widow, and the “woman” who’s currently pregnant with Captain America and Iron Man’s baby. Steve sips his hot chocolate and listens as Pepper and Natasha commiserate over the misogynistic tendencies of men in high positions of power. He wants to sympathise, as he’s recently undergone the same treatment from random men on the street, but he keeps quiet: A few instances, creepy and disgusting though they were, pale in comparison to a lifetime of experience.
“Very good, Captain. Now if you will move three parts of your body around, slowly and methodically. It can be your arm, fingers, ankle, toes. And please remember to breathe.”
. He turns his head and freezes as soft tendrils brush, light as a feather, across his shoulders. A low groan escapes him when a current zips along under his skin; the loud voices suddenly stop, and slender hands slide gently along the curves of his face. He wants to move, get the fingers away, they’re not Tony’s, why are they touching him?, but his body won’t cooperate. It can’t fight the bone-deep exhaustion.
Steve grimaces as a particularly loud moan comes through his phone’s earpiece loud and clear. “I was just calling to explain like I said I would, but you sound...busy.”
Steve struggles to stifle his laughter at the defiance but a short glare from Tony certainly helps. He clears his throat and finishes off his bowl of Cap’n Crunch; Peter pushes away from the table and runs through the living room and down the hall to his bedroom. Tony stares after his son, sighs and walks to Steve’s side. Steve turns automatically, letting Tony lean against him. Tony’s skin is cool and still slightly damp, and Steve buries his nose into the other man’s hair.
Tony chuckles. “Just wanted to make sure you got home all right.”
plays on the television, and Steve is grateful that Peter immediately settles in to watch it instead of being grumpy that he's been put down. In the kitchen, Tony has pulled out the large container of soup and two wax paper-wrapped burgers from the bag and is staring down at them like they hold the answers to the universe. He glances up at the sound of footsteps on the linoleum floor.
“What if I do it after the baby’s here?” she whispers.
In the kitchen on the communal level are Natasha and Steve. He stands at the sink, washing dishes, and Nat is doing some sort of yoga pose on the island countertop. Tony watches as she folds herself nearly in half – he may have landed the epitome of perfection that is Captain America mixed with the stubborn, beautiful Brooklyn boy named Steve Rogers, but he can still appreciate such flexibility in another human being. Steve’s shoulders are shaking from obvious laughter. Tony calls out for audio.
“I'm on my way.”
“Natasha needed Tony-Time.”
“You aren’t.”
“But?”
“Don’t – Well, actually, be sorry, because you jumped to the worst possible conclusion, so being sorry is completely acceptable.” Tony tightens his grip, nuzzling into Steve’s neck. “If I could make a suggestion, though? Ask outright, preferably without the judgement, and…I cannot believe I’m the one saying this, but don’t keep things bottled up, especially if it has to do with our relationship. We’re gonna have a kid soon-ish, so we better start working on our communication skills now.”
At Tony’s gesture, his eyes amused, Steve launches into the story of the time he and Bucky had been in Melissa Wolmack’s apartment, ostensibly studying, but the only thing Bucky was studying was the taste of her mouth. Steve, though, he’d been trying so hard to prepare for the finals coming up the next week even through the weird moaning and heavy breathing not even three feet away. Then her parents had suddenly come home, her dad disappeared down the hall and came back with a baseball bat, and Steve hadn’t hesitated, just shoved his books haphazardly into his bag, gritted his teeth, and slipped through the window. Bucky, having followed closely behind in order to not have his head become the latest style of baseball, had landed on a pile of garbage bags, while Steve hadn’t had the same luck: He hit the lid of the dumpster then tumbled to the ground. The adrenaline had prevented him from noticing the excruciating pain emanating up his leg until they were at least three blocks away and his throat was nearly completely closed. Ma had been, quite understandably, furious as she drove him to the hospital once he’d used his inhaler and could breathe again. Steve hadn’t had a verbal tongue-lashing like that in a long time. He only regretted ever letting Bucky convince him that Melissa Wolmack was worth the risk of an overprotective former-Marine of a father; she really wasn’t.
“I know. I know, you're both right, but I really don't like the idea of having a
The shower he takes is short, barely enough time for the water to warm up to the temperature he usually likes it at. Steve doesn't bother dressing once he's dried his body ー he just climbs unsteadily into bed, tugs the comforter up over his shoulders, and falls asleep almost immediately.
sleep.”
Peter’s chest puffs with pride, and he swaggers around the room to display the tux that he’s been dressed in. Steve chuckles and sits on the arm of the sofa nearby, watches the proceedings. Peter strutting seems to have strengthened Pepper’s fragile grasp on her emotions, because her eyes are no longer filled with tears, and she’s smiling as her gaze tracks her son’s movements.
Once the other three took their leave and the door to Thor’s apartment was closed, Frigga gestured for Steve and Tony to follow her into the guest room. Loki was lighting the last candle just as his mother entered the room; Steve allowed the trickster to guide him to the spot where a blanket had been spread across the floor, laid down, and took a deep breath. Loki stepped back, and Frigga took his place, kneeling beside Steve. It was hard to ignore the six pairs of eyes focused on him, even more so once the queen untied the belt and pulled his robe open. Steve stared at the ceiling, willed away the burning in his cheeks. He nearly jumped out of his skin at the first touch of cool stone against his belly. Frigga let out a reassuring sound but continued placing the crystals on his stomach; the candlelight on the smooth facets of the crystals sent off quivering shimmers, or maybe it was the golden tendrils seeping and sparking between Frigga’s fingers. She murmured words, low in her throat, and Steve found himself relaxing, though he had no hope of understanding the language. His skin warmed from the inside out, a burnished rosy glow emanating from below the flesh. He lost track of time the longer the goddess queen worked.
“For here or there?”
And he’s not alone.
“Absolutely not!”
“Okay. I’ll tell Peter. I love you.”
They stand there in the nursery, holding each other for a few minutes. Tony isn’t sure how he ever got this lucky, but he’s not fool enough to question it – much.
“Tone –”
, Steve thinks helplessly as he wonders exactly what he did in a past life to deserve a soulmate who hates him so much.
“Your AI is snarky, Stark.”
Steve shakes his head, then answers aloud, “No, you?”
“How was he?”
Steve manages to push himself to his feet and out the door. He ignores Bucky motioning at him in the parking lot, just turns toward home and makes his way down the block. By the time he gets to his building, his neck feels like it's on fire, and he's sweating through his shirt. He unlocks his door, slamming it shut behind him. He would normally feel guilty over it ー he's not the only one who lives in the building, after all ー but his emotions are all mixed up, a jumbled maelstrom he can't make heads nor tails of.
Steve sighs. “Yeah, buddy?”
like the outcome. If I hear of anything happening to Ms Crawford, and I don't give a damn whether it's physical or verbal... If I hear of something like this happening again, you will regret that decision for the rest of your life. That's not a threat, either. It's a promise."
“I have no idea. What happened?”
Steve stares at Tony, uncomprehending for a long moment, but then he understands; his heart breaks as he wonders how many people fucked Tony then left immediately after without regards to his feelings. He wraps a hand around Tony’s hip, drags him closer; Tony squeaks when Steve seals their mouths together in a kiss that he hopes will convey everything. Even if the kiss doesn’t, the soulmark might, now that they’ve completed the connection.
screams down at everyone in a multitude of colours, all of which are neon against a vivid purple background. Tony huffs out an amused laugh when he sees the two arrows holding the banner in place. A smaller table holds a pile of wrapped presents.
“From where I’m standing, ‘you’ looks pretty good, Tony.”
Tony kisses Steve’s forehead, murmuring an “
“No, don’t be stupid. I’m asking you to say yes when I ask you in six months to marry me. We’re, hm… We’re engaged to be engaged, if you will.”
work.”
“Nothing. What was I gonna do, leave Peter without someone to watch over him? It’s not a problem, I promise.”
“Nothing was scheduled for this morning, sir.”
“Babysitting the kid again. His school called me 'cause he was sick, which is why I stole your car yesterday, and then a family friend picked him up around six-thirty or so, but I kept wakin’ up last night, thinkin’ he was still there and freakin’ out 'cause I couldn't hear him.”
“I've noticed. He eats all my bananas, but only the ones that are starting to turn brown. The spottier, the better, evidently.”
“JARVIS, where’s Loki?”
“Poor you, damn. I can't imagine that.”
Steve finally turns to face Tony, and God, that expression on his face is enough to kill Tony. Steve isn't happy now, so point to the genius who couldn't keep his damn mouth shut. Tony gives up holding back on his impulse and allows his fingers to
Bucky crows with laughter, doubling over as he loses his breath. Finally, he straightens and manages to say through his chuckles, “Was it worth it? 'Cause you know Coulson and everybody's gonna ask questions.”
Tony grins shamelessly as the waitress sets their drinks on the table before walking away. “Yep. What else have you noticed?”
“So how was your day.”
With no small amount of trepidation, Steve toes off his flats and slowly nears the bed. It takes him a full minute to gain the courage to rip off the tape and open the flaps of the box. A piece of paper lies right on top; he pulls it out, sets it aside, and reaches for the items inside. From each of the three cloth bags tumbles –
Twenty minutes later, Steve finds himself sitting in the comfortable computer chair behind Tony’s desk. Both Natasha and Clint utilised their “sneaky ninja” skills to get him here without detection, and JARVIS rearranged Tony’s schedule so that as far as the genius is aware, he has a last-minute meeting starting in five minutes.
.” Steve barely manages to stifle the shaking of his hands as he gingerly reaches in for the supplies. He can afford pricier products, SHIELD reimburses him for anything he buys for the job, but he's always stuck with what he knows. He can't deny, though, that he has had his eye on this line for a very long time; it's supposed to be the best of the best, much smoother and reliable than anything else, and the pricetag reflects that quality.
“So, who's Bucky? I know you've known him since childhood, I get that, having friends for that long is great, but…”
“Thank you. Miss Hill will direct you to my office.”
“Great. I’ll text you the details. Make sure you have your license ready.”
Steve sighs, scrubs a hand over his face. “Yeah, they did. Clint damn near shot him in the face, and I thought Nat would stab him if Thor hadn’t been there.”
His own cleaning isn’t nearly as soft or slow. Within minutes, he steps out of the shower, wraps a towel around his waist, and pulls Steve out of the stall. Tony’s heart flutters at the small upwards tilt to Steve’s lips. Once he’s dried off Steve’s body, they make their way into their bedroom.
Steve can feel his cheeks burning, but he focuses more on locating a pair of shoes that aren't nearly falling apart from wearing them constantly. He manages to find black hiking boots in the back of the guest room closet that have very little scuffs. He’d bought them last summer when everyone had made plans to go camping and hiking but never had; instead, he’s only worn them a couple of times, one of which was a photoshoot that Coulson had asked him to participate in and he’d needed something to take his mind off of his latest breakup. He can’t even remember now who that person had been, the relationship had meant so little in the end, but at the time, it’d hurt like Hell.
“Okay.”
“Yes, we will.”
“Does it really matter?” Tony whispers as he finally meets Steve's eye for the first time since he stepped through the door.
“The biometric sensors indicate physical signs of anger, but as far as I am able to ascertain, he is merely pacing.”
“What? No, you can’t shoot Thor!”
“Pop!” Peter giggles. “This isn't
, Steve thinks night after night as he collapses into bed following a day of doing nothing.
Steve nods, adds the key to his keyring, and drops a ten on the table, waving at Tony before heading out of the diner.
Steve stared in surprise, clearing his throat once he’d let the silence drag on uncomfortably long. “Uh, well, this is, um, how I see all of you, I guess.”
… … … …
“I think,” starts Pepper, her hands folding on the table in front of her, her slow exhale ruffling her bangs, “I think it’s time to tell Peter. I mean, he obviously knows
“Steve? What are you doing here? C’mon, Pete, loosen up a bit, you're strangling me here.”
Through his third contraction in ten minutes, Steve grits out, “Not as easy as it sounds.”
Bucky shakes his head with a grimace, his lips thinned into a flat line. Steve knows that Bucky cares, but it's not so easy to handle when Steve's already torn up inside. The last time Tony had met up with him in the bleachers of a stadium, the baseball fans and team having already left, he'd been skittish. His face had been pale and drawn tight with ー pain, maybe, Steve doesn't know, Tony refused to talk about it, and he kept making an aborted move toward his chest, hand scrabbling the thin air millimetres away from the front of his shirt before falling to his lap. He'd rejected any touches from Steve, scooting further and further away until finally, he'd got up, said a goodbye that felt far too damn final for Steve's liking, and disappeared, leaving Steve to stare at the space where Tony had been. Now there's nothing but an echoing silence, a painful gap where Tony should be.
This was supposed to be a bit longer, but I've decided to split some stuff up for the next part of the series. I hope it still lives up to expectations. :)
And now it’s too late. He can’t take Tony back, not with Osborn running the show and the entire world out for his head. Nonetheless, Steve understands with a keen dread, the danger could be just as great if Tony were to stubbornly continue his chosen exile.
He hadn’t been fast enough, strong enough, smart enough to protect his best friend, his partner in all the ways that mattered. He’d let himself be blindsided by Osborn through his grief and guilt of not doing something sooner, even when all the warning signs had been there.
Then, a voice begins:
He shot Steve in the back, a paralyzer that immediately had him toppling sideways, half over Stark’s unresponsive body. There was a word of startlement from one of the agents, a sharp,
“Go back to sleep,” he promises instead. He brushes aside Tony’s longer fringe, presses a soft kiss to his forehead. His skin is warm. No fever. He feels cool now, after the sense memory of too-hot flesh. “I’ll be here.”
How many times had he wronged this man?
“I’ve no idea what you could possibly mean.” She takes his hand once more, careful as ever, and presses her lips to his knuckles. “You just sit tight, all right? You look like a ghost.”
Tony groans, and it comes off more raw than he meant. “Jesus, Steve, we’ve been
Steve forces himself to unclench his hands. It takes almost more effort than he has left. “It’s―”
The War Machine lands with a metallic clank, Natasha some steps behind.
“We’ll give you a call if anything changes,” they assure him.
This is clearly going nowhere. Steve takes a fortifying breath and decides to leave this battle for another day. “We’ll continue this conversation some other time, all right?” he says and knows that Tony knows that he isn’t asking.
“Carol―” he tries again, but she’s not done. She’s far from done.
and Steve has failed him.
Steve takes a step forward and hopes with everything he has that he isn’t fucking up―Tony’s
“How tired are you?” Clint asks instead.
” Fallon deadpans. “
Fallon leans back in his chair, hands braced on the edge of the desk. “
Natasha turns Hulk. “Big Guy, we really need Bruce right now.”
He runs his fingers down Tony’s cheek, feels the contrast of soft skin and stubbly hair as he traces the contours of his face. “I want you safe,” he admits, daring to run his fingers ever closer to those soft lips. “I need you safe, Tony.”
“What? It’s a fair question. I’ll say it again: You do look like shit.” He jerks his thumb over his shoulder at Thor, the latter of which has been standing like a sentry by the room’s entry with the pile of gifts still in his arm. “I’ve got some stuff from my kids that they wanted me to bring for you. It was a pain in the ass to hall all the way from Iowa, but it can wait if you’re not up for it.”
He shakes his head. “
But he’ll be damned if he can’t give the man some ease of conscience, at the very least. There’s love for Tony in his heart still, despite their disagreements, even if he knows that it will never be reciprocated. He…
And prays.
This close, he can hear the slow beat of Tony’s heart.
“Holy shit!” Clint says simultaneously to Sam’s, “Mother
“No,” Steve interjects, just as Natasha starts making a move, “it’s the least I deserve.”

and Steve has always had trouble trying to refute that―he’s never seen eyelashes like Tony’s even on a woman.
” she nearly yells. “Tell me what you did instead, Steve!
” Clint reiterates. “I don’t think he’s ever heard of the term ‘give up.’”
The lights drop suddenly, enshrouding the stage in darkness and painting their living room in blue-black light. Lila’s eyes are huge, glued to the screen as they are, while Steve finds that Clint, Natasha, and Sam are watching with mild interest at best.
“Jimmy Fallon, Auntie Nat!” Lila exclaims with an almost affronted look. “It’s the only show Mommy will let me watch past my bedtime.”
Tony’s hair has been allowed to grow out again, and it splays out in a halo of dark waves against the white of the pillowcase. Even in his sleep, Tony looks washed out and clammy, though there are no dark circles under his eyes and his fever relentlessly burns bright. Yet, even like this, he’s easily the prettiest man Steve has ever seen, all high cheekboned and sharp-jawed. He recalls Jan once said that Tony was
“Right.”
“I’m fine.”
“Hi, Mister Rogers? This is Sharon Carter. I'm the nurse here at Walker Elementary –”
“It’s probably for the best. I was planning on calling a team meeting for after we talk to Thor and Loki.”
The team was called out twice since Steve found out he was pregnant. Pepper sat with him the first time, both of them lounging on the couch in the penthouse; she worked on her duties for SI while Steve watched the video-feed of the fight, gave advice and warnings when he deemed it necessary through the private comm line. Coulson repeated the orders on the main frequency so nobody was privy to the knowledge that the Captain America on the field wasn’t the

“I’m not sure I like the fact that you and Steve are conspiring together, J.”
“What? You can assure me
“I’ve gone in on two hours of sleep
He tries to argue that Tony doesn’t hate him, that he just needs some time to deal with everything he’s learned, but then Steve realises he’s arguing with himself and exhales sharply.
She holds her hands up in surrender and turns on her heel to go to her desk. Steve catches sight of her signing something to Clint; the man sprints toward the coffeemaker, nabs the carafe, and bolts back across the room to deposit it onto Kate’s desk, hissing all the way as drops of hot coffee splash across his hands whenever the pot is jolted. She gives him an unimpressed look but accepts his gift. Steve can’t stop the chuckle that escapes at the pair. Thor, visiting for a bit, laughs at their antics.
Tony's lips twitch, but he releases Steve's hand and pushes open his door. Steve follows suit, staying close to Tony as they cross the parking lot. His heart is racing in his chest, and he knows his palms are clammy, but he doesn't slow down. He's never been one to back away from any sort of challenge, and meeting his partner's ex who is also the mother of said partner's child? Definitely a challenge, even if no one says it is. If Pepper doesn't approve of Steve, she can always tell Tony, ask Tony to leave Steve or keep Steve away from Peter. Hell, she can always keep Peter away from his dad, if Tony decides he doesn't want to break up with Steve. He's not sure that she actually would, but the possibility is still there, and Steve can't stand the thought of not having Tony or Peter in his life any more.
“Nothing much. Just wanted to see how you were doing.”
His movements slow, Steve slides one arm beneath Peter’s legs, the other around his tiny shoulders, and carefully cradles the child against his chest as he follows the man into their apartment. Peter’s room is lit by a small night-light that’s sending an image of the solar system onto the ceiling. The walls are plastered with posters of more cartoon ponies, drawings, and a huge print of Optimus Prime and Bumblebee. His bedsheets are mismatched as well: A Cat in the Hat fitted sheet, Doc McStuffins pillowcase, and a Mulan comforter, all in a pirate ship bed-frame. Steve lays Peter down on his bed and steps back to allow his father to tuck him in. He steps out of the room when the man starts whispering to his sleeping child.

“– are going to explain –”
“Mm. Underarms?”
“Steve!”
“Of course, sir.”
“That, my dear Cap, is an unhackable, un-fuck-with-able voting poll so we don’t end up stuck with someone grossly unqualified and narcissistically malignant as President in the future.”
His breath catches in his lungs as he focuses on the circle on the page. He’s seen that exact shade before. Without thinking, he shoves the sketchbook away, ignores the pitiful rustle and
Steve sits on the curb, gazes out at the night. Loneliness creeps slowly into his bones when no other voice is there to keep him company. After a long few minutes, he sighs, pushes himself unsteadily to his feet, and heads inside. Sam and Natasha are both asleep on one of the beds; Steve watches their chests rising and falling with their breathing. He then makes his way to the unoccupied bed. It’s nearing midnight, and it’s been so long since he’s had uninterrupted sleep. He stretches out on top of the blanket, resting his hands under the back of his head, and stares at the shadows on the ceiling under his eyes finally close.
“Don’t worry about watching Peter any more. I’ll find someone else.”
“Is he okay?”
Thor exits the workshop after a few minutes, leaving Tony with the promise of searching for an answer, and the genius stares at a circuit board without actually seeing it. He feels like a weight has been halved, but now that he’s sent the god back to his realm to find a way of making Steve’s dream of being pregnant a reality, it sinks in heavily that this could really be happening.
“Don’t be. You know me ー the futurist who tries too hard,” Tony bites out; the bitterness in his voice is sharp, venomous.
“Why don't you just talk to him?”
Steve exhales sharply but ignores the slightly mocking tone in his mother’s voice. “Yeah, him. Well, he said there was some sort of–of emergency and left his kid with me.” He pauses, tries to stave off the panic by taking deep, measured breaths. “What do I
Louisa answers after the third ring, sounding half-asleep.
“Absolutely not. Now get some rest. You’ve been up since four this morning.”
was startling but easily ignored as Tony gave in to the absolutely insane urge, grabbed Steve by the face, and captured his mouth in a hard, hot kiss.
“Of course it’s okay.”
“Uh, there.” Steve points, trying not to hit the pedestrians walking with them.
“Nope, gotta share me with Pete, not even sorry.”
Tony stops, one leg in a pair of sweats, his T-shirt draped over his shoulder. Steve swings his legs over the edge of the mattress and stares at Tony, at the glow of the reactor in his chest, at everything that makes Tony who he is. There’s an edge to his expression, sharp and angry, but his eyes betray the uncertainty. He sighs, finishes pulling on his pants, and leans against the wall.
“What's going on, Tones?”
Sherri gestures toward a closed door. “This is it. I’ll be back in a few minutes with your daughter.”
, Steve thinks as he presses his fingers to the small blue-white circle over his heart, the enormous expanse of golden-pink sky nearly blinding him. The ocean is dark, threatening to devour him whole, beneath him. Peggy’s words are wobbling and full of static over the radio and barely heard over the roar of the jet engines, but all Steve can think about is the fact that he will never know to whom the symbol on his chest belongs, he will never know what his own symbol is… He will never know what that connection and unyielding love feel like. As the nose of the jet angles toward the water, he promises Peggy that he will be at the Stork Club next week and promises his soulmate he will be back for them, knowing that these are promises he will never be able to keep.
Tony steals Steve's laugh from his lips, and suddenly, Steve doesn't find any humour in the situation. He tugs Tony closer, tilting his head and parting his lips, losing himself in the sensation and taste and heady dizziness he gets from kissing Tony. Unfortunately, Tony pulls away and grimaces.
“Yeah, my temptation is, uh, well, I'm very tempted to ask you to stay, but it'd be a bad idea.”
Phil sighs  “That's common in bullied children. Is there a meeting set up with the principal?”
“Okay.” Steve brushes his hair from his forehead with a sweaty hand. His heart is racing in his chest, pounding faster than he keep count of, but he needs this. “Um, well, I don't know how to explain how I know Tony.”
“So do a lot of women, but they are viewed as ‘professional attire’, so most of the time, we just shut up, put a smile on, and kick ass in our ‘kill-me-now’ heels.”
“Stop, that doesn’t help. Yes, Clint, we thought this through. Loki will be spending as long as it takes training with me daily, then he’ll be taking my place on the field. I’ll be working with SHIELD behind the scenes and giving orders and suggestions where I can. Thor has promised to keep an eye on Loki, make sure he doesn’t try to screw us over. We have backup plans for backup plans.”
“If you’re talking about the panic attack that you are currently experiencing, then I suggest naming three things that you see. Captain?” JARVIS prompts when Steve hasn’t responded in a long moment.
“Uh, most likely Nadia, Pepper's niece. She's visiting on break from college, and Pete just loves her. She's good with him.”
“I – I’ve got other plans, thanks.”
Tony is quiet when Steve finishes speaking. The only sounds in the room are their breathing, the soft hum of the arc reactor, and the nearly-silent whoosh of the air system. Steve wants to say something to break the silence, but he’s said all he can. Anything more will only serve to push Tony too far.
Phil just gives that mysterious smile of his that he's so fond of giving before disappearing through the doors of the photography section. Steve stares after him for a moment but ultimately knows he isn't going to get any answers if Phil doesn't want to give them; he huffs out a laugh and heads back to his desk to wait until Tony arrives.
Bucky cocks his head, raising a brow. “You leavin’ early?”
Her voice is causal, and the words are certainly innocent enough, but Steve still flushes a deep red. His brain recalls the package without his permission; he’s absurdly grateful that his dick can’t betray him at the moment. He turns away from Natasha, though he is absolutely certain she’s already seen his burning cheeks, and covers the paint pots.
“Yeah, yeah, go ahead.”
"Um, will I have to pick him up?"
“Yes, because
“You can pick them out, kiddo, they're chunks.”
“Shit, I am so sorry.” Tony sighs, barely audible over the sound of background conversations and traffic. “I’m sorry, this building has a security system that jams calls, prevents any outside contact, ya know?, and all I did was take a step back because ー well, it doesn’t matter why, but I did, then I was in the radius of this goddamn system, and oh, god, I’m sorry. Please, please call me back when you get this.”
Tony's laughter was sudden and slightly hysterical as he held the candle up to eye level. "Steve, Steve, oh my - I...
“You here to take me in?”
comics! Peter loves those!”
Steve gets the feeling there's something Tony isn't saying, but he doesn't press further. The dinner, while awkward, has been pleasant, and he prefers not to ruin that.
Words get lost as Tony captures his mouth in a hot, burning kiss. Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s shoulders, lets Tony pull him to his feet. When they finally separate, they’re both breathing hard, and Tony’s fingers are pressing hard enough to bruise Steve’s waist.
“You think too much.”
“Tony, we really – oh, my
Doctor Cavendish turns out to be a tiny slip of a woman with thick silver hair twisted in a severe bun and a no-nonsense attitude. She doesn’t so much as bat an eye at the sight of Tony Stark and Captain America standing on either side of a blonde woman in her exam room. She orders the men to the chairs against the wall, closes the curtain surrounding the table, and directs Steve to lie on his back. Her voice is much kinder, more gentle, when she explains the process. She apologises for any discomfort he experiences as she performs a pelvic exam. The rest of the appointment is less invasive, and for that, Steve is thankful. He pees in the cup he’s handed, allows a lab tech to draw blood (at which point, Tony speaks up to remind the doctor and her staff about the NDA they all signed), and waits for her to come back. When she does, she has a schedule book in her hand.
Tony catches Steve’s nipple between his teeth; the lace is nearly nonexistent, provides just enough roughness that he knows it feels good to Steve. “Yeah? What’d she teach you?”
“I wasn’t thinking clearly, obviously. Besides, I think J took over halfway through, maybe sooner. I know, it was stupid and reckless, and I’m swearing to you now that it’ll never happen again. I will never endanger my life like that unless I have to.” Tony shrugs. “Can’t promise I won’t do something crazy while saving the world, but outside of that, I won’t.”
“We’ve been trying to find a way of making it possible. He wasn’t really happy that I even wanted a…it with him, but he’s come around to the idea. So we’ve spent a lot of free time looking for answers.”
“Yeah, babe, really. I love you, and I’m completely capable of putting aside my dislike of the psycho- demigod long enough for this to work.”
“That’s a
“You okay?” Tony asks after a few minutes of silence; his fingers play with the stem of his wine glass, but he doesn’t take a drink.
Steve stares around at the family he’s found in this new century, smiling until his cheeks start to hurt and then smiling some more.
Over the next two weeks, Peter becomes a regular fixture in Steve's apartment. Steve finds his shelves filling quickly with kids’ movies and books, his TV consistently set to cartoons (he learned quickly which channels play Peter's favourite shows), and his cupboards and fridge stocked with healthy snacks and drinks. It doesn't feel as weird as he expected it to. There are still a few nights that Peter falls asleep on the couch, but Steve has gotten better at making sure the kid is in his own bed before it happens most of the time. The first night he'd tucked Peter into bed, the child had stared up at him expectantly, leaving Steve floundering to figure out what he wanted.
to reflect the wonderful, chaotic, brilliant, beautiful upheaval that’s taken over his life, how he would never willingly give everything up, how he’s come to absolutely relish the way his life is now. He takes a deep breath, splays a hand across Tony’s hips.
“Go to sleep, Tony.”
? With
“I like this surprise! Bye, Miss Wanda! Bye, Miss Hill!”
"Damn it, Steve –”
“Ya gotta go. Sorry, but if you, if you stay here, and we keep layin’ like this, I ain't gonna wanna letcha go, and I don't wanna be the reason you miss Peter's presentation.”
“Or I can show you?”
Now there’s nothing.
“And mighty dishevelled,” adds Natasha from where she's sitting on the edge of Steve's desk. “Bucky said you were getting a ride to work. Didn't know he meant a ride
“I hate all of you. So much.”
“–what you think –”
“School’s dumb.”
“Wait, was that the night that we, uh, talked?” Tony asks as he scrubs at his eyes.
“I'm aware of that. But, Steve… If we don't bring him in, under our protection, where he can be watched and trained and
“Yeah,” says Tony after a lengthy pause during which he gazes at Steve without blinking. “Yeah, I can understand that. Probably wouldn’t have gotten much sleep tonight, either.”
“Why? We usually only meet with her when there’s some sort of threat against my public image.”
“What’s that?”
Tony glances up from the schematics in front of him. Steve stands in the doorway to the workshop, his hands clutching the tablet Tony gave him the second he began living in the tower; on the blond’s face is an expression of pure determination, supported by the fact his jaw is set, shoulders back. Tony raises an eyebrow but nods his assent.
“Bruce wants to check him out first, make sure he’s completely okay with the whole ‘swapping biological forms’ thing,” announces Tony, sliding his phone into the back pocket of his jeans.
“Yes, we're friends, rah rah, now answer my question. Who are you? And why the hell have you come here in the middle of the living room of
“Why are you being so difficult? It’s just money.”
Pepper laughs softly. “Yes, well, no one’s ever claimed that Tony thinks things through completely.” She gives him a small smile. “Thank you for everything you've done, for both of them. I don't think they'd be doing this well if it weren't for you.”
“Yeah, Petey-bug?”
“Please,
“Oh, it’s, uh, wonderful to meet you, as well, ma’am – I mean, Queen Frigga.”
Tony swerves in time to avoid clipping a building, swallows down the bile that rises at such a sharp turn. “I’m okay, promise.”
nightmares!”
“Of course I’m right. I’m also trying to be supportive and look out for the both of you.”
Steve listens as Tony explains about the medical technology he’s trying to advance, tools that can be used for search-and-rescue missions, and various other devices to make life easier for so many people. Steve points to one of the screens.
“He's not my sugar daddy,” denies Steve automatically, and he regrets that immediately when both Pietro and Clint start cackling and singing
“Where to, sir?”
ate), he catches Tony’s eye and nods. The brunet grins widely, wipes his mouth with his napkin, and raps his knuckles against the table until everyone quiets down.
“What? Why?”
“Not a problem, hitched a ride with Sam and Nat,” Bucky replies with an easy shrug. “Why don't you go back home, get more sleep? Because you look like dried shit on toast.”
“That database,” Osborn exploded, bloody spittle flying from his mouth, “is
“Ah, what!” Lila interrupts over the noise of the crowd, pointing at the screen. “They skipped over who’s gonna be on the show.”
This time, Steve can’t stand still in the face of her pain. Her shoulders shake with the sobs she chokes down―yet, at the first touch of his hand on her shoulder, she springs back like a coil, one foot drawing behind her into a defense-attack stance.
! It really was a joy to write this, and I really couldn't have expected all of the love I received for this! Thank you to everyone for all of your support!
Another migraine, Steve surmises with a sinking feeling. Maybe even the same one from yesterday morning. He pads over on socked feet and settles his weight on the coffee table, a pose that comes increasingly familiar these days. He examines Tony, the lines of pain creasing his forehead and how he’s sitting curled into himself with his favourite blanket falling loosely just off his shoulders.
There’s a fondness to Tony’s eyes at her mention. “
“And I was fine; I was

He’s about to have a fight on his hands when Tony realizes where they’re going.

Tony huffs and closes his eyes. His brows are furrowed into a deep vee, a muscle in his cheek twitching with every other movement Bruce makes. “Wha’enned,” he tries again. “Nu’zuppo be’ere.”
You could almost see the heartache in Fallon’s gaze. “

That settles worry in his stomach. “You haven’t slept yet?”

, he read and understood, finally, with a cold, sinking feeling, what these wars had driven Tony Stark to.
Steve startles awake, reaches for his shield and then remembers he gave it to Bucky. Bucky deserves the shield more than he does. He marches down the hallway, doesn’t care that whoever is there can probably hear the heavy fall of his footsteps. It’s probably Clint again, he tells himself; he’s found the archer rummaging through his fridge on more than one occasion.
“Hey, Tony,” Clint says, “you know who really loves you?” He proffers the first present and watches with pride and something
"Z’kay,” Tony says, blinking with haziness.  “Du’z good. Knows wha’z doing.”
She, along with several others, have been taking refuge in Tony’s scattered bunkers, moving from place to place every several hours like hunted animals. Steve had only just found out about the situation this morning, when call after call started bombarding his comm line while the group caught a small reprieve.
It shines bright and beautifully blue through the thin layers of his scrubs.
Carol had to be pulled away to deal with the Osborn situation. It’s just Steve now, with an Avenjet and little more than hope, who was left with the task of convincing Tony to come back home.
“Let the invalid be, Clint,” Natasha says with a disinterested air that says she is really, very much
Tony’s whole body rolls with the movement.

and steps back to wait for the ship’s doors to hiss open.
His words seem to fall on deaf ears. “I don’t know what I’ll do,” Peter confesses, his voice wretchedly whisper-soft, “if Tony doesn’t survive this.”
“Tony,” she warns, though her fiercely blue eyes have become fixated on Steve’s figure, “a mother has her duties to her son―to fight the fights that he can’t on his own―and I’ve missed too long of your life, missed too many battles. But this?” she says, her expression thunderous, and now she’s cracking her knuckles into her palm. “This is not a battle I will miss.”
“Is that…?” Natasha’s voice breaks the suddenly stunned silence.
Bruce takes the opportunity to lean over Steve and snatch up the IV-connected hand. He injects some ccs into the line, much to Tony’s displeasure. “You know, when you do that, you sound like a cat,” he informs the man.
, a factor that was heightened due to delirious fever
They spill and spill and spill, one after the other as if they were running from the unbearable heat smoldering within their host. Tony hunches over himself, as much as the combination of the harness and his right arm across his body allow him to, trying to hide proof of his shame and weakness behind the hand he uses to cover his features. His teeth are gouging into his lower lip to prevent the release of the sobs wracking his shoulders.
After all of that, after all of the pain they have caused each other, there’s little wonder that Tony still refuses to come back down to Earth, even momentarily to see a doctor.
At this point, he thinks, if Tony ever decides to go back to Earth, it’ll be short of a miracle.
Norman Osborn will strike the fear of
It’s an endless cycle.
, he doesn’t ask. He knows Tony won’t be―not for a long while. He runs a gloved hand through sweaty, unruly dark locks, massages his fingers into the scalp.
He gently pulls Tony out of his awkward hunch and easily moves the man in his blanket burrito until he’s lying propped up on a mound of pillows Steve had set off nearby in case of this eventuality.
Steve doesn’t think twice.
For several long moments, he holds his breath for every missed beat, every time Tony’s heart takes too long to get back in order. There’s no AED on board, he suddenly remembers as he peers around for the familiar red. This is an unfinished quinjet; some of the seats aren’t even fully installed. This was one of the last functioning ones that Steve had stolen from S.H.I.E.L.D. what seems like a lifetime ago now, after the Skrulls had effectively irreparably damaged the Extremis and every last piece of technology Tony had been linked to. His head fills with a million regrets, a million
He isn’t going to sit on his hands and watch his best friend die. Not if he can help it.
Fallon directs Tony to their seats. The crowd has yet to settle down, until Fallon has to stand back up and motion for their containment.
He closes the door.
I can’t―oh,
It didn’t take a genius to come to the conclusion that one of the said line of dead people included him. And, true to Tony’s subconscious, which dislikes Tony on a good day, Tony’s hallucination of Steve was little better than abusive, from what he could gather.
It’s such a Tony expression that Steve is struck speechless.
“It’s easy,” Bucky Barnes says. “Stark made the O.S. to be near-intuitive. Feel where you want to go, and it’ll take you.”
Their cover blows as both Danvers and Potts take to flight.

“Bite me, Darwin.”
She nods decisively, an action so akinly similar to Tony it almost startles him. “Good.” She drags him down, then, with a hand at the back of his neck―and
during the fighting over the S.H.R.A. and all the time in between since? The realization hits him somewhere deeper than empathy.
Steve doesn’t bother to reply; the protest is a familiar one. He slides his arms under Tony’s shoulders and the back of his knees and lifts him up against his chest. The blanket is dragging along the floor, probably picking up some dust, but Steve only focuses on moving quickly, setting his jaw in determination―Tony is deteriorating much more quickly than expected. To hasten, despite any impediments in the form of one highly stubborn, fever-driven man, seems to be the only logical course of action.
The words hit him like a sledgehammer. “Tony―”
to kill!
Tony still refuses to look at him. He shakes his head and, then, in the next moment, turns to cough into the crook of his arm. It’s wet and congested, falling from Tony’s lips one after the other like water cascading down a faucet. Steve can see the way his chest heaves even through the thick blankets, every breath he draws in only stolen for the next bout of coughing.

Clint barely withholds the roll of his eyes. “It’s not a joke. This is really his mom. Biological mom. Tony’s adopted.” He wriggles his arms. “Also, this shit is heavier than it looks.”
Steve tells himself that he’s not desperate enough to stalk the man on Google.

to go back to.
Tony’s sick, half delirious with a fever that keeps climbing and climbing the longer the virus works at his Extremis biology. Steve turning his back on him―something in Tony breaks.
Tony would wake up; it was an

Thor frowns. He peers up at Barton, and his stare makes no mistake as to which of the two will hold the upperhand in battle. “What is this jest?”
And then Tony’s nimble fingers are strumming over the strings of the guitar, the melody at a much quicker tempo. He walks one foot in front of the other, a soft sway to his hips, towards the microphone stand before him. The spotlight follows, glinting off the edge of his blood-orange sunglasses.
Next chapter: Will they even make it to Earth?
Steve’s blood freezes.
Bucky starts to walk him to and fro the hospital. He says he’s stretching his legs a bit. It’s a small bit of good that he has back. That he has Bucky back.
And that’s when Steve sees the man’s face. The crowd follows his same thought, and they all go wild. There’s a faded Jimmy Fallon in the background, jumping in excitement and twirling like a little kid with both hands over his mouth. Lila is not faring much better.
“Why don’t you ask your Uncle Steve sometime?” Natasha says innocently. She’s staring daggers at Steve’s face. “I’m sure he’ll be happy to tell you.”
he forges on, his syllables clipping with his increasing lack of air, “until you showed up here, after
He reaches twice for Tony’s shoulder before he manages to summon the wherewithal to place his hand on Tony’s free, blanket-covered arm instead. “Hey,” he nudges gently, settling on his knees before Tony’s spot on the couch.
as he desperately presses his ear to Tony’s chest. The blood rushing in his ears is so loud it takes him several tries before he’s able to discern that that soft pitter-patter of a beat is Tony’s heart struggling to find a steady rhythm. The fact that Tony is still shallowly breathing is the only thing keeping him from falling head first into sheer, dread-induced panic.
Bruce’s lips twist wryly. Tony’s life is at stake, but the Other Guy still refused to let anyone but Rhodes near the man in question. There was no convincing and zero compromise. He’s only grateful that Rhodes, after a life spent at Tony’s side, knows just enough about the medical field to be a help rather than a burden―that, and it’s helpful that at least one of the two of them can keep their cool in the face of their friend’s plight.
“Laura, honey, his
“S’rry,” Tony slurs wetly with hiccuping breaths. He doesn’t stop apologizing, quacking with how desperately he’s trying to regain his self-control. “‘Ll stop in’sec; I’ll stop, ’swear.”
“Hold this,” Thor says, belatedly.
Lila’s mouth opens to reply, but what comes next is a barely controlled squeak as the last of the commercials end and a jaunty introduction melody starts up. “It’s
motion. “You think you played it right?” he asks Tony.
None of it matters.
Fear snakes into each of his muscle fibres, constricts his throat until he almost feels like he’ll join Tony on the ground. He’s shaking violently, his eyes burning with unshed tears.
There is a deep, furrowed ‘v’ in the set of Tony’s brows. “I could never hate you,” he says, his voice hoarse and almost whisper-soft. Amidst Steve’s little speech, he had lowered his sole free hand to instead grasp at his trapped elbow, holding himself tightly enough through the blanket as if he could physically impede the shudders running through his body. He stares down at Steve now like this, with those eyes inlined by a miserable red. “I could never hate you, Steve,” he reiterates, and the way he says it is as if he means something else entirely.
Danvers gives a tight nod. Her right fist clenches and unclenches, the tendons springing into sharp relief behind her gloves. Hill knows the power behind one of those―she fears for the poor sucker who gets stuck on the business end of one of them.
Both Thor and Steve had watched her go, the former with something unreadable in his expression and the latter with guilt churning in his gut.
A weight lifts off his chest. “Has he woken up yet?”
Minus the whole stabby thing and the losing Peter thing.
“Uh, guys,” Clint tries to warn―to the echo of a resounding
“I believe you know what I will say,” Amanda says, her voice dangerously cool. She’s standing right under Steve’s nose, her chin tilted up―and, for all that she’s but a few inches shorter than Tony, she might as well have been twice as large as Steve himself. “I understand mishaps, Captain Rogers―I am intimately familiar with doing wrong to someone who should never be wronged―but I will

“And Osborn won’t see that,” Steve concludes with a sinking feeling. “He’ll figure you have a copy somewhere.”
It was a moment of anger, a last ditch effort to hurt Tony as much as Steve still hurts inside. And the worst part―the worst part of it is he didn’t do it in the heat of the moment. It wasn’t his temper that got the best of him then. No―it was something worse. It was a cold, calculated
Nothing to say at all.
Reed Richards warns.
Tony’s eyes are incredibly soft. “M’good, Cap. Just feeling the time of day.”
’―Steve doesn’t think it helps that Tony says it with a flirtatious wink as the camera pans closer. His gaze flits across the televised Tony on the screen, studying the contrast of the red of Tony’s shirt collar against his tan skin, the perfectly trimmed shape of that beard. It’s only natural, from there, for Steve’s eyes to get stuck on the way Tony’s lips move with the song, partially covered by the round head of the microphone.
It had begun in the quinjet, a mock interview of Osborn where he detailed how he was seconds away from apprehending World’s Most Wanted Tony Stark. Osborn had run through a detailed list of Stark’s supposed character defects but failed to mention what, exactly, his crimes had been other than pissing off Norman Osborn, a fact that had immediately piqued most broadcast stations. The unboarding of the quinjet was uneventful―until they had come upon the scene of Steve Rogers desperately calling for medical assistance over a supine Stark within the bowels of another aircraft. It had stopped the agents in their tracks―the cameraman was able to record their looks of uncertainty thrown at each other―but not Osborn.

A H.A.M.M.E.R. quinjet had been parked by the eastmost hangar, right next to an old S.H.I.E.L.D.-issue Avenjet, recognizably Stark's design; they had to go the long way and descend at the westmost hangar in order to not attract attention. Space was silent, but human eyes weren’t. They had crossed through the base, past the evidence of recent inhabitation―afghans and coffee cups and a random slipper―towards the muffled sounds of a commotion, of two men screaming and the thuds of a body.
There’s only so much patience to be had in the face of his worst nightmare come to life. “Yeah? Where to, sweetheart? In case you haven’t taken a

Thor takes that moment to stand. “Allow me, then,” he asks and takes the gifts from Barton’s arms into one of his own. He reaches for the door’s handle and pulls it somewhat ajar, bracing an arm against the door’s edge.
Tony’s brows furrow softly. “I’m right here.”
Guilt aches deep in Steve’s chest. “Tony,” he starts, “they wouldn’t―” There’s no one else to blame. “I’m sorry,” he has to settle on. He means it with every fiber of his being. “I’m so sorry.”
, he recalls Tony saying―in and around the wound. It’s staunched most of the bleeding, but it sure as hell didn’t stop an infection from settling in. It looks to be in the early stages, red and inflamed and sweltering off heat, though he’s willing to bet Tony is as dehydrated as a desert and this specific infection is being led by some superbug from some unknown corner of the universe―and that’s without even taking into consideration all of the blood Tony has lost.
for a definition of it, at least.
Tony frowns, displeased. “Mom, don’t―I’m not―”
Now, however, he doesn’t know what he feels, other than a very obvious physical attraction. Everything and anything concerning Tony is too convoluted in a myriad of emotions.
Thor’s somber look breaks with a grin. “Though, you are looking a little―”
Tony’s haggard breaths tighten into a pained

Bucky moves between them and Osborn. He’s careful in his movements, maintaining his eyes on Osborn and the huddled group of scared-out-of-their-wits agents in the far corner.

of red blood seeping between the man’s fingers. “If Thanos had wanted you dead, you would be. He spared your life.
Steve is respectably startled when she plants a kiss on his burning, just-slapped cheek. “Now, you take care of my boy, you hear?”
Steve ducks his head, feeling properly like his Ma has just chastised him for picking a fight again. “Yes, Ma’am.”
This is the first step, he thinks as he watches Tony’s drawn face ease for the first time today. It’s not much, but, the more Tony chooses to interact with his friends―people who genuinely care about Tony, like Pepper Potts and Rhodes and Carol―the more Steve hopes Tony will see that all is not lost. That he still has a life―a
And, like proper Tony fashion, the man had come to in the middle of the impromptu surgery, Bruce’s fingers and instruments digging deep into skin to suture closed the last of it.

From the darkness, soft piano keys begin to play. The melody is slow, almost quiet.
“We need to go,” Blue Lady repeats. “
“Son of a bitch,” Steve breathes.
It’d be an hour flight at top speeds. Steve can’t move from his place, afraid that one mistimed heartbeat from the next Tony could go into cardiac arrest and he’d be too busy getting them back home to be of any use.
“...contacts at S.H.I.E.L.D. have been saying that Osborn has been practically dying to get his hands on a copy of the S.H.R.A. database,” Carol is saying when he turns the two-way link back on. “Of course, anyone who knows anything knows that Tony erased all of the copies when he went off-world. Though, I’ll bet he still has one floating somewhere―”
She hums. “I do believe once is more than enough.”
Steve sits carefully, feeling overly clumsy and large as he tries not to snag on something important―much less jostle Tony as he settles down. He presses his palm to Tony forehead and tries not to feel pleased when Tony allows the contact with barely a huff. He drags that hand down, feeling at clammy cheeks, and then closer down to feel at Tony’s pulse. “You feel a little warm, still,” he concludes. He tries not to squirm, uncomfortable, when he notices all of the eyes of the room’s occupants are staring in his direction. “Want some water? Ice chips?”
” she shouts back, and then her itty-bitty feet are thumping rapid-fire down the flight of stairs and across the room before she launches herself over the top of the couch. She lands on Clint’s lap, and his arms curl around her waist instinctively.

Steve presses his palm to Tony’s forehead, repeats it on his cheek and the nape of his neck, and curses. Somehow, in the hour or so he had been gone, the fever had worsened. He had planned on carrying Tony off while he was sleeping and none the wiser, but there is no way the man has been resting through this, if the white-knuckled grip he has on the folds of the blanket is any indication.

Thor’s eyes flit across the surroundings, observing for intruders, before he takes Stormbreaker and leaves her, guarding, before the set of the double doors.
Thor supposes he makes an alarming figure, slumped as he is on the floor. But this has become his post now, the only thing that has brought purpose to him for the last few weeks. He will guard these doors―the man inside―till he breathes his last breath.

Tony loses his smile. “I know,” he says, simply. “Did she tell you about Peter?”
It’s all kinds of fucked up, Bruce thinks, that this is the moment the Hulk decides to show up. Violently. The suit, half-trashed as it was, turns into scrap metal in two seconds flat.
“Still good,” Tony affirms―less of a lie now that his own mother has successfully managed to up his adrenaline for the foreseeable future. He pats the abandoned space next to him. “Mom, please, can you―please leave Steve alone and come sit here before you give me a heart attack.”
when this whole Osborn thing is over, Tony will finally choose to come home.
He took a repulsor to the chest for his efforts on that first day he had broken into the fort. It might not have blown a hole through his body like he knows it could have, but it sure as hell did more than
He stumbled back with the force with which she slammed the card against his chest.
“You’ve got this?” Blake asks.
It takes him three tries to get the comm link on, his hands shaking too badly for the sensor to get a proper read. A burst of static greets his ear. His last source of hope. “Avengers,” he says into the echoing space of the quinjet. His voice is a hoarse mess, lacking the usual sureness with which he barks orders during missions. “Avengers, come in. This is―this is Steve Rogers, requesting”
“Yeah,” Rhodes says again.
And, on the other side of that coin, it became evident very quickly, going by the fact that Tony had never revoked his overrides―the same ones he had used to power down Tony’s suit several days ago when Tony had been adamant that Steve
Tony stares at her for a beat. “You are cruel.” It comes out more moan-y than he’d like, what with his weak voice, but it prompts Steve to drift to the other side of the bed.
It quickly devolved from the two Captain Americas fighting back to back in seamless harmony to Steve Rogers fighting like a man possessed in righteous rage. Osborn fell to his knees, and the world held its collective breath.

“Carol―”
He hasn’t seen Tony in almost a month. He misses him like a missing lung.
The audience goes wild again, loud drums thundering in the background.
Of course not―he’s Tony fucking Stark, the guy who screwed over half of the superhero community and spat on Captain America’s grave. He is the goddamn Lucifer, and it is finally his time to be thrown out of Heaven by his own brothers and sisters.

“Twenty-six minutes till final approach.”
His ward―Tony―is almost transparent in his paleness, yet the man finds strength enough to smile at his visitors. “It’s good to see you, too, Barton,” Tony manages, though his voice is weak and almost raspy. He’s sitting up today, resting over a mound of pillows, with the covers pulled up mid-chest, doing nothing to obscure the swab of thick bandages wrapped over most of his torso. “And I see you brought me a present,” he continues, after he tilts his head slightly to look over Barton’s frame.

So many things that went wrong.

He tells himself it’s for the best―there will be no one to cry at his deathbed on Earth, either way. At least, on the Moon, he will die surrounded by his inventions rather than in a cold, white medical ward where his wrists are shackled to the bed’s railing and no one can hear the last of his wheezing breaths.
Steve eyes Tony with admitted weariness until the other man gives in with a roll of the eyes and pokes a finger at his own temple rather tellingly.
He can’t quite swallow it down. It all comes back up, violently. It’s more blood than stomach acid at this point, mixing with the ashes that was Peter.
Tony is really here.
Tony glares.
Steve has heard enough.
“Tony,” he breathes in startled recollection. Tony had broken into his apartment. Tony had cried. Tony―
The film had been live.
Tony protests weakly, curling into himself as if that alone would be an impediment.
He tightens the last of the stitches and snips off the thread with an air of finality. “It’s done.”

happening to Tony, right under Steve’s nose.
” The voice croons, and Steve realizes he’s hanging onto the last of the voice as it fades again. “
It scares Steve that Tony can’t even form enough energy to so much as grunt in reply.
No one else in the room bothers to disagree with him.
He can’t handle this. The tears begin anew in his own eyes. He can’t contain the sob that escapes his lips, the grief and suffering he has been forced to endure these past months. “Tony, I―” he manages to say before he collapses over Tony’s form, gathers the man to his chest.
Steve isn’t the sighing type, but he finds it hard in that moment to withhold one. He stands and offers a hand. “Come on,” he says into the settling silence. “Let’s move you to bed.”
Thanks for reading
Yeah, Steve snorts to himself, and maybe hell will freeze over.
he nearly says. That hadn’t gone so well last time. “Don’t be,” he settles on, praying Tony will overlook the previous part. His right hand is shaking with unsettled tension.
But there was no farce. It had been obvious from the start, especially when Stark failed to react when a two-hundred-plus weight had toppled over him. It became even more obvious when Osborn kicked Stark in the side, and the man’s limbs haphazardly rolled with the momentum. It became horrifying when Osborn picked Stark up by the strands of his hair―the latter but a limp, pale ragdoll―and yelled in his face.
The doors slide open quietly, and Steve steps into the dimly-lit workshop. DUM-E wheels out of his charging station with a chirping noise, but the other two only swivel their cameras in Steve’s direction, remaining in their stations like good little bots; he’s sure he isn’t imagining their curiosity, U’s camera tilting this way and that. He runs a finger over DUM-E’s strut, asks him why he isn’t staying in his ‘bed’ like his brothers. DUM-E only beeps wildly and shoves at Steve until the man is sitting on the couch. When the bot rolls away, Steve’s lips twitch, and he stares around the workshop. It’s not nearly as lively without Tony and all his screens. His vision is suddenly obscured by a large black camera, and Steve jerks backwards, grabbing the scrap of cloth from DUM-E’s claw. With a grin, Steve starts lightly rubbing the cloth across the bot’s frame.
"I don't even know what that is."
Steve started tearing up again at the sight of his partner's confused expression. Tony wrapped Steve in his arms and rubbed his back while whispering soft nonsense. When Steve pulled away, he allowed Tony to wipe his cheeks dry.
“It’s… It’s okay, Tony. I understand. I mean, it sucks, because I miss you, but this is your job. You can’t just walk away from it.”
“Steve, I love the snark and sass, I really do, but be serious, oh my god, did those words come out of my mouth.”
“It better be.” Tony scrubs a hand over his face. “So you’re really here.”
“He did?” Pepper questions as her eyebrows disappear into her fringe.
"C'mon, Stark, you look constipated. That is

Between the warmth of Tony pressed against him, the knowledge that his future stepson is just in the other room sleeping peacefully, the tang of salt in the warm air, and the sound of waves as they crash on the shore in the distance… Steve is hard-pressed to remember when he’s ever been happier.
he’d continually remind Tony whenever Tony mentioned Steve’s age), he finally managed to show up in Tony’s dream. He’d gone to bed later than usual, since Bucky had convinced him to stay up past the time Ma went to bed, so they could sneak back into the living room and watch some scary movie, so when he slipped into REM sleep, the darkness behind his eyelids slowly gave way to a thin strip of light. He could see shadows moving past, hear the sounds of hard soles of shoes against stone, and he realised that the soft glow came from a hallway and he was in a room. With a deep breath meant to calm himself down, he stared around the room, straining his eyes to see

Steve wakes early to a dim bedroom and a warm body curled up against his. He tries to lie still, doesn’t want to interrupt Tony’s sleep, but anxiety burns along his nerves. His legs itch and tingle with the need to move; after ten minutes of forcing himself to stay motionless, he can’t handle it any longer, shifting gingerly out of Tony’s arms, slowly rising off the bed. Steve dresses in a pair of loose basketball shorts, a T-shirt, and fresh pair of socks, then makes his way out of the room.
Steve hesitates, unsure of what he can say without making the situation worse. He’s shocked to hear his voice is steady when he speaks again: “If you don’t want children, that’s fine. But can we talk about why?”
– he starts that whole angry lecturing-slash-ranting thing he’s so good at.”
, Steve growls ー and his hand burns with the need to touch Tony. He whimpers when the other man actually pulls away, but the sound cuts off with a strangled garble when Tony doesn’t waste time, just yanks off his T-shirt and then shoves his jeans to his ankles in one swift motion, leaving all of him on display. Steve takes in the sight before him hungrily, reaching for Tony when it becomes evident that looking isn’t going to be enough.
Tony locked himself in the workshop for nearly two days; he wouldn't even let Steve or Pepper in, using JARVIS to pass on messages. By the time he emerged, Steve had been close to mounting a one-man rescue mission to save the genius from overworking himself. Steve asked, but Tony refused to give any details about what he was working on. They ate a quick lunch together - the first meal in forty-eight hours that they shared; Tony showered alone (after Steve declined, three times, to join), and they spent a few hours watching mindless TV sitcoms. At five-thirty, Tony pulled Steve to his feet and dragged him to the elevator.
“Steve, I’m ex-KGB. The only reason the United States government has kept me around so long is I’ve yet to fuck up. They don’t trust me, but they need my skillset. That, and Nick would make their lives miserable.”
He’s still wearing his suit pants and dress shirt, and the pain in his head hasn’t fully disappeared, but Natasha doesn’t seem to care as she kicks his ass from one end of the gym to the other. His body gains a few bruises in just a handful of minutes. While he is clambering to his feet again after a particularly nasty swipe to his legs sent him flying backwards, she speaks; her voice is cold.
“I, um, yeah. Yeah, I can do that.”
“This is his last known place of residence,” announces Thor, handing over a slip of paper. “I can be there swiftly, Steve, just say the word and I will go.”
Steve lays in bed for a bit after his alarm goes off. He’d only fallen asleep a little past three, and he’s still so tired after just barely two and a half hours of sleep. He’s in the middle of debating whether he should go into the office or just work from home, when he hears his front door opening. He decides not to ignore his visitor, clambers out of bed slowly.
, not paying attention to the others, when his phone starts vibrating on his desk. He doesn't spare a glance at the screen – it's probably just Bucky or his ma.
“Wanna share with the class, Steven?”
She's dressed in threadbare cotton shorts, possibly leftovers from when Pepper still lived in the tower, or maybe they're loaners from Natasha, and one of Steve's shirts, one of the ones that Clint had bought him as a gag gift for his last birthday, Tony can't see the logo but he recognises the ugly salmon colour and the way the neckline starts to dip in a sharp V. She looks thrilled to be here, she looks like she belongs at Steve's  side, and isn't that just a kick in the teeth  He sucks in a harsh breath at the tightening sensation in his throat, the taste of bile and something unidentifiable rising up his esophagus, at the way his vision dims just slightly and goes grey at the edges.
“Ms Potts is calling once again. Shall I continue to enable you in ignoring her?”
“Steve. C’mon, man. You deserve to be happy. And he makes you happy, don’t try to deny.”
“There, perfect, you look perfect, Pepper's going to be jealous of me.”
Of course the others dreamed the same thing. Steve holds his head in his hands as they all speak over one another about what the dream could have meant. JARVIS interrupts after an hour, alerting everyone to the War Machine’s presence on the landing pad. Tony disappears from the living room and returns moments later with Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes in tow. The man looks shocked, his body shaking minutely, and he stays close to Tony, even as he joins in the conversation.
Tony’s chest aches at the longing and heartbreak on his partner’s face. He pulls at Steve until the blond is leaning against him. Tony rubs a hand over Steve’s back, smoothing circles into warm skin. Steve lets out a shaky breath.
“Well, here’s to hoping it’s a relatively quick fix.”
Tony shrugs as he checks on Peter in the rearview mirror. "The books are better. He mentioned an 'emergency'."
Tony sighs tiredly, and the glass clinks on the bar as he sets it down. He still doesn’t turn to Steve. “I’m not going to kick you out. This is your home, too, Steve. Just… stay.”
“How long have you known?”
“Trust me, you'll find out eventually. Mostly because JARVIS will punish you.”
Tony’s cock is already hard, drooling precome onto the bed, but Steve begging has always pushed him so close to the edge, and the fact that Steve’s voice is higher in pitch does nothing to change that. Without another word, he sets to work, licking and sucking at Steve’s slick folds through the lace, soaking the thong with spit and juices. Steve cries out; his fingers twist in Tony’s hair, pulling his face even nearer. The thong starts getting in his way, so he pulls back far enough to yank it down Steve’s legs. The moment it’s on the floor, he buries his face against the dripping cunt and thrusts his tongue inside. Steve’s gasps turn into rough moans as Tony nips gently at his folds, sucking Steve’s clit between his teeth, tugging just enough to draw a fragile yelp from Steve. He focuses his attention on the nub, pushes one finger, then two, into Steve’s tight channel. It isn’t long before Steve starts grinding down against Tony’s mouth, onto Tony’s fingers; the blond is damn near sobbing as his thighs tremble around Tony’s head, hips jerking in time with the flexes of the digits buried inside of him. With a high, near-wailing sound, Steve orgasms, and Tony swallows all the fluids he can catch with his tongue. His lover whimpers and tries to twist away; Tony removes his fingers from Steve, sucking the sweet wetness from them. He gives one last slow lick to Steve’s spasming pussy, causing his lover to whine, and crawls up the bed to share a sloppy kiss with him.
Tony groans, a guttural sound from deep in his throat. “Don't talk like that, Jesus, I can't handle that right now.”
“Go. Now.”
“No, we didn’t.
“As you wish, sir.”
Steve signs for the package and stares at the box as the guy walks away. Grabbing his letter opener, Steve slices through the tape holding the flaps down. He can feel everyone's gaze on him but opens the box anyway; he knows that if he doesn't, they'll just pester him with questions and speculation all day, so it's better to get this over with. As soon as the items are exposed, he gasps.
Within moments, Phil has whisked Pepper away into the honeymoon suite, and Steve laces his fingers with Tony’s, nudging the other man toward the enormous glass doors that lead out to the darkened terrace. Steve grabs the throw blanket off the back of the couch; it isn’t too terribly chilly outside, though the sun has been set for a couple of hours, but there’s something about holding Tony tight under a blanket, the sky dotted with thousands of stars even if they can’t see them through the haze of fluorescent orange and smog that permeates Brooklyn, and enjoying the warmth and comfort that comes with having his arms around the man he loves… It’s intoxicating, and Steve loves every second of it. He collapses onto the lounger, the wicker frame creaking softly under his weight, and shuffles to get more comfortable on the thick, conforming padding. Once he’s settled, he raises his arms to allow Tony to sit on his legs. Tony exhales heavily as he reclines against Steve’s chest, and Steve nuzzles his nose into his partner’s neck.
“Then don’t say anything.”
Kate blows him a kiss as she stalks away. The shout-singing is still going on in the background, and Steve digs in his drawer for his earbuds, hooking them up to his phone and stuffing the buds into his ear. Marvin Gaye thankfully drowns out the sound of his friends being childish idiots; he hesitates then opens his texting app.
“We ready?”
Nothing about this is similar to when Steve lost his virginity at the age of seventeen to some girl Bucky had convinced to go on one date with Steve. That was nothing more than an inebriated pity fuck ー she'd been complaining all evening to her friend about Steve's stature, the way he was mostly distant the entire time. They had followed Bucky and Dot to a house party a few blocks away, and somehow, they'd ended up in the parents’ bedroom, fumbling on top of the blankets in the dark. She complained when they were finished about how bony he was but said
“Yeah, yeah, I’m ー I’m fine now, thanks, JARVIS. You, uh, sound like you’ve done this before.” When JARVIS doesn’t respond, Steve realises that if the AI
“Captain Rogers, if I might speak?”
bot he’d created shortly after his parents’ death – on his side with his claw still clinging to Mjølnir’s handle. Thor looks caught between laughing at Dum-E’s misfortune and internal debate as to whether he should help the robot. Eventually, Tony takes pity on Dum-E and moves to pry the metal claw from the hammer’s strap.
“Oh, you answered, thank fuck. Look, I know I said I’d have something figured out, but the plan fell through so I’m really sorry, but can you please pick him up at three? It’s just for today, and I promise I’ll have another plan figured out by tomorrow.”
Steve meets Tony in the middle of the hallway, pulling him off to the side so that Peter doesn’t see them, and kisses him gently. “Hi. I’ve missed you.”
And if Tony's voice is softer than usual, Steve isn't going to mention it. He presses his lips to Tony's hair, breathes in the scent that only Tony manages to have. The television plays softly in the background, largely ignored but still going in hopes of recapturing its audience. Steve dozes off and on as he holds Tony, quick little naps that are interrupted every time the other man shifts even a little. But Tony doesn't get up, so Steve doesn't let go.
pregnant even though it’s scientifically and medically impossible because hello, he doesn’t have any of the parts required to be a human incubator, so he thought we could – or rather,
“Babe, is anybody with you?”
“Have a dream that everything got fucked up, we all chose sides and fought against each other, and you and Barnes left me for dead in, where was it, Siberia or some place equally as frozen over?”
“Yeah, he was great. There weren't any problems at all. Thank you for letting me watch him all week.”
“Clint's mostly deaf, and Pietro is loud enough to break glass.” Her unimpressed expression turns to glee. “You gonna tell Bucky who your sugar daddy is?”
“Of course. Because my life isn’t complicated enough.”
“What are you thinking about anyway?”
“You tried paying me a thousand dollars for two nights. That’s, that’s too much, Tony. I’ll accept payment, I guess, but not a grand.”
Steve explains Natasha’s reasoning, and Tony has to agree that she had a point. He kisses Steve again then rolls out of bed, grabbing a pair of sweats and a t-shirt from the dresser; after tossing the clothes to his lover, he picks out a pair of boxer-briefs and a tank top. He pulls them on quickly. The teddy is on the floor by the time Tony turns back toward the bed, and Steve is curled up on his side, dressed and covered with the comforter. Tony slides under the blanket behind Steve, pressing close, and sighs contentedly.
“So do I, Legolas, but…he’s helping as much as he can while still being safeguarded.”
A small sign taped to the window instructs him to ring the bell. He does, pressing the button then staring awkwardly at the grey metal of the door. The sound of a quiet buzz startles him.
Though Tony’s parked the car in the garage, the two of them are too busy sharing kisses that taste like chocolate and coffee to bother getting out of the vehicle. The only reason they stop, in the end, is because Tony’s phone starts vibrating in its holder on the dashboard, and the smiling face of Peter on the screen is a rather effective mood-killer. Steve breaks away with a gasp, shifting in his seat and adjusting his pants, and Tony swears softly before stabbing at the Accept button. Steve steps out of the car so that Tony can talk to his son in private. The air outside is heavy, thick with humidity and the smell of exhaust and oil, and it helps destroy the rest of Steve’s libido easily; not being around Tony’s cologne, or being unable to touch or see him, doesn’t hurt anything, either. Steve leans against the car, runs a hand through his hair, and waits.
“I’m glad you guys talked,” interjects Pepper, smiling gently at Steve. “Promise me, though, that you won’t just accept this type of behaviour in the future, if it happens again.”
A loud buzzing breaks up the silence in the room, and Steve stretches out his back, sighing in relief as the joints pop; he’d forgotten what a pain it is to sit on the floor for so long. Tony’s name is on his phone’s screen when he pulls it from his bag. Quickly glancing at Peter, who’s completely absorbed by his own art, Steve pushes himself to his feet and answers the call after he’s made his way to the kitchen.
Pepper walks away laughing. Tony spends the next ten minutes being congratulated (and sending the well-wishers in Steve’s direction; “He’s doing all the work, really”) and making sure his partner isn’t getting too overwhelmed by all the attention. He hands Steve gifts one by one, watching as more and more baby-related items are opened: Boxes of diapers, multiple three-packs of wipes, outfits and onesies, blankets, bottles, pacifiers… Tony loses track of everything. Sam, Thor, and Natasha gather up the presents, take them to the penthouse, while Coulson and Tony pick up the wrapping paper from the floor. Bruce keeps Steve company, discussing all the information given in the pregnancy books.
“Oh, God, you’re a sap!”
Tony steps forward at Steve’s hesitation. “Steve, you can change your mind if you want. No one here will be upset if you do.”
“We've got him, Stark.” Sharon takes up position beside Tony, glances at Steve. “Thor has a message for you. You should go see what it is,
At Tony’s words, the bot whines and rolls away rapidly. Steve chuckles – and hearing his own laughter in a higher pitch is never going to be easier. A knock against the darkened glass walls of the workshop pulls everyone’s attention away from Dum-E.
“Not with a fuckin’ grand, and not after I’ve already said no!”
Tony looks exhausted, his dress shirt half-unbuttoned and hanging open, his sleeves rolled up to the elbows, and Steve’s steps falter. He sways unsteadily in the doorway, shifts his weight between his feet, before he pushes forward. Tony doesn’t look up from the bar as he pours scotch into a glass. Steve wrinkles his nose at the sharp scent, but he can’t concentrate on that right now. He comes to a stop a few feet away, clasps his hands behind his back, and tries to assemble his thoughts.
brings up the topic but especially when it’s Steve saying the dreaded “s” word. He still cracks jokes about Natasha and Sam’s relationship that’s blossomed since the Triskelion’s fall and the road trip that followed, but he stays well away from mentioning the soulmarks that adorn their body. He doesn’t even bring up the fact that Thor doesn’t have a mark ー apparently, being Asgardian means that soulmates aren’t a thing.
Now pay attention!
“Yeah, if you’re sure.”
, are you serious? Oh, God, Steve’s gonna kill me. Damn it, why didn’t you remind me, JARVIS?”
“I feel like an idiot,” he mutters even as he comes to a decision.
“One moment, please. Yes, it appears that seven of the coordinates have been marked in HYDRA files as bases of operations, twelve are currently unknown, and the remaining twenty are either supply depots or safehouses, including the one you visited today.”
Steve takes the time to set his bag on the table just inside his door, then follows the pair down to the underground parking garage. Tony clips Peter into his car seat with the ease only a parent has. Once the door is shut, Tony gestures toward the front passenger door with a small, teasing smirk.
“Uh, what?”
“Oh my god it’s Captain America oh uh hi s-sir.”
“We did it,” he whispers, and his partner grins widely.
“Then we deal with it.”
“Figured if we were going to do anything about, well, us, it would be better to do it in the comfort of our own home and away from prying eyes.”
“Yeah, uh, I need to see Tony.”
“So who's watching Peter?” asks Steve as they head to the parking garage.
“But this is about
“It's fine, Rhodey, I'm fine.”
Tony mimes zipping his lips together and throwing away the key. A ghost of a smile flickers across Steve's face, but it's here and gone in seconds, almost too quick for Tony to see, but he watches Steve too much to not notice any change in his facial expressions. Steve sighs, his hand reaching out and gently picking up one of Tony's.
His thoughts are interrupted by a rhythmic knock on the door. He grinds to a halt and swallows down the sudden surge of panic. Taking a few steadying breaths, Steve smooths down his shirt and makes his way across the room. Tony stands just on the other side, and he grins widely as soon as the door opens.
“What the
“Would you care for a dance, Ms Potts?”
have a board meeting, so we’re dropping Steve and Loki off at the tower, and I’m kidnapping you for the rest of the day.”
Steve is sitting on the couch in the penthouse staring blankly at the television. Some redheaded woman is baking some homey comfort food on the screen, but judging by Steve’s expression, he’s not taking in any of the show. Tony watches his partner, watches the way his breathing is intentionally slow and steady, watches the way he blinks far too often to be natural. He wants nothing more than to hold Steve tightly; he knows that the action is far from advisable at the moment. He shoves his hands into his pockets and clears his throat. Steve reaches forward, grabs the remote, and turns off the TV. He doesn’t look toward Tony at all, so Tony decides to take the initiative.
“Told you, man, I got your back,” Sam says, but he does stop rolling up his shirt from the day before.
His bleary gaze follows the lines of a smooth leg, from high heel all the way up to the hem of a pencil-skirt, finally focusing on Pepper’s face, and – oh, boy, she looks pissed.
Tony's hand is gentle in Steve's hair, brushing it back, and Steve turns his head to press his face into Tony's warm palm. Tony stares down at him with dark eyes; the bruise-purple circles under his eyes stand out prominently in the dim light, making the rest of his face seem pale, washed out, in comparison. A soft sigh escapes Tony, and he shifts to stretch out beside Steve.
hero, and keeping mine out.”
Dum-E, and suddenly, all I could think about was… What if he was scolding
By the time Sam comes to get him, Steve has beaten three bags to a pile of fabric and sand. His knuckles ache and burn under the wrapping, and there's a dull thrum of pain in his muscles, evidence of the force behind his actions. He unwraps his hands as he heads toward the door, letting the pink-tinged fabric fall into the trash can on his way out. Steve drops down into his chair in the kitchen and watches the bruised, scraped skin on his hands smoothing out, losing its raw appearance. Tony nudges Steve's calf with a foot, warm and solid against the bared flesh, and Steve forces a smile.  Coulson taps his knuckles against the tabletop and waits for everyone's attention.
“Oh, God, I’m gonna fuck this all up. Even with you there to stop me from turning into Howard Two-Point-Oh, I’m… I’m even less safety-conscious than anyone else in the tower,
Tony looks up from the wings he’s repairing; when nothing else is said, he spits the screwdriver out from between his teeth and cocks his head to the side. “A, even if we were, there’s nothing wrong with that. Therapy is a wonderful tool if you need it. B, why are they thinking that, and how do
“I’m so proud of you,” she whispers, her voice cracking, and he pulls back a bit to see she’s crying.
that way a million times before.
Tony barely manages to not collapse directly on top of Steve, rolling to the side at the last minute, and they're both breathing heavily, panting and shivering. Steve turns to face Tony, ignoring the twinge in his lower back and ass, before leaning up to kiss the man. This kiss is gentle, tender, nothing like the last few kisses. Tony brushes a hand through Steve's sweat-damp hair and pulls him closer, and they both don't care about the mess between them.
“No, Steve. Stop it. Stop. All you’re doing is torturing yourself. You did everything you could. Shitty things happen. Terrible tragedies occur. It doesn’t matter if you’re a good or bad person. Life just has a way of fucking people over. But blaming yourself for things you can’t control or change isn’t helping. Okay?”
He ignores the stab of guilt at keeping this from her, but he justifies the secrecy with the excuse of not having talked to Queen Frigga yet. Natasha continues her jog, unaware of Steve’s inner dialogue; he sighs, steps onto the treadmill, and presses the power button, hoping he can somehow outrun his emotions.
have done that, not even when I knew him. He was loyal to only one thing, and that was discovering new ways to test science’s limits. You, though, you don’t trust easily – which is understandable – but when you do? You trust implicitly, and you love fiercely.”
The car comes to a smooth stop outside the elegant cafe. Within moments, Happy is holding the door open, allowing Pepper to step out; Natasha is next, somehow managing to move gracefully in her form-fitting slacks and three-inch heels. Steve lets Happy to help him out of the car. Ice and snow cover the sidewalk, so Steve is thankful for the assistance, since he feels like his feet could slip out from under him with one wrong move. He follows his friends inside, shedding his coat once in the warmth of the cafe; the staff smiles politely at Pepper, greets Natasha with a “Good morning, Ms Rushman”, and pretend not to be staring at the curve of Steve’s belly. Once the trio is seated and has ordered their drinks, Pepper picks up her menu from off the table, opening it and scanning the options.
The cameras cut to where Natasha is talking to an interviewer; the others are all speaking to different someones in the media, all aiming for positive experiences to garner better press for the Avengers.
From: Tony (18:33) I can't tell you how relieved I am that you made my son's well-being such a high priority
“What are you two still doing
He's just stepping out of the shower when he hears the front door bang shut. He recognises the footsteps across the floor, rolling his eyes but infinitely thankful that Bucky knows Steve is a wreck right now. He's less thankful when he walks out of the bathroom with only a towel around his waist to see Bucky and Sam sprawled on the sofa together, Clint perched on the arm with his feet in Bucky's lap, and Natasha rummaging through the fridge. She backs away with a bag of grapes in hand, and Steve sighs and makes a mental note to buy more in case Peter comes over any time soon.
the suit,” Tony mutters; he vividly remembers Pepper’s reaction to the armour he built specifically for her.
Steve stares at the words on the screen. He’s terrified of saying the wrong thing and destroying this tentative...whatever they have. With a sigh, he sets the phone down next to him and covers his face. A negligible part of him wishes he’d never participated in Project Rebirth, that he’d stayed the same scrawny, sickly kid he used to be and died a forgettable death in Brooklyn.
“I gotta see this,” announces Tony, and he follows closely behind as Steve goes to Peter’s rescue; and if Tony ends up with a photo on his phone of Steve disentangling the child from the knobs on the dresser drawers, it's only right that Steve get a copy of that picture, as well.
want to share but was always taught to, Steve had handed over a pail and shovel, and continued working on his sandcastle.
“The – oh, shit,
His phone rings suddenly, startling him. He ignores the fact that his co-workers are now staring at him as he digs his phone out from under a stack of paper.
? Why
Tony chuckles once more, beckons Steve to stand. Ben passes the child to his father, pressing a gentle kiss to Peter's forehead, and waves to the trio as they leave. Ten minutes into the drive, Peter is asleep, his hidden-object book on the floorboard. Tony lowers the volume of the radio slightly; his eyes never stray from the road, and Steve wonders if he's going to like what the other man has to say.
“I don’t want a surrogate. I don’t want to adopt.” Steve sets the tablet down on a worktable. “I mean, both are perfectly acceptable options that I’d love to look into, if there was no other way.”
Thor nods once, grasps his brother by the elbow. Steve watches them step onto the elevator, then leans back into the couch. He stares out the large window at the cityscape beyond. A bone-deep sigh escapes him, and he feels a flicker of dread flare to life, coupled with doubt. For the first time since he was hit with the desire for a child of his own, he’s not as certain that he can do this.
“This, this is fine.” Tony gives Steve a long look with narrowed eyes, but his expression finally smooths out, and he's grinning bright and real. “So how have you been? It's been a while, I know, and I know I promised to try to do better about our visits, but ー”
“I believe it. It’s like he’s got a switch that just...flips, and he’s up and at ‘em with no sign of having slept at all.”
Tony sighs, deciding to treat it like ripping off a bandaid – one quick motion to lessen the pain, or awkwardness, as the case may be. “Steve wants a baby, but he doesn’t want to go through a surrogate, and he’d rather not adopt, which means he actually wants to
. I shielded the suits against EMPs.”
“Did I mention I’m always working?” continues Tony, speaking right over her. “I’d always be gone, in and out of the kid’s life like a ghost. Oh, God, I’d be just like Howard.”
“Still on this, buddy?”
Tony rolls his eyes as the schematics suddenly vanish. “Don’t use my AI to do your dirty deeds, Cap,” he grouses but does turn toward Steve. “I’m looking at you now. What’s up?”
“Well, it's not that hard when you have a few hours to kill, and when the person you're trying to find has a direct sightline to the Baxter Building. This place is the only one tall enough, on this side anyway, to see that much of the building. So, I looked at Google satellite to see what buildings were in a two-mile radius and were taller than the average building. Yours was the only one that fit both criteria.”
Bucky is already in the office when Steve arrives the next morning. Steve tosses him his keys and beelines for the coffeemaker. He'd fallen asleep around eight, but he tossed and turned all night, waking up at the slightest of sound in the apartment, each time panicking because he could no longer see or hear Peter. It took almost half an hour each time to remind himself that Peter is now with his mother. He'd finally slipped into deep sleep just as the sun was peeking over the horizon; he hadn't even done his morning routine, instead staying in bed until the last possible minute.
“Loverboy send you that?” Clint calls from across the room, and Steve scoffs ー Tony isn't his lover, and besides, it's just a gift of gratitude.
The notebook is laying right where it was in the dream, and this time, Steve doesn't thumb through it. He pockets it, heads to the floorboard he knows is hollow, and yanks up the covering. He's just gotten the backpack out and slid his arm through the strap when the sound of a shuffling footstep sounds behind him. He turns.
“Today is the third.”
“I wanna bring Spiderman in.”
“I think you and Daddy should get married.”
His neighbour's cat is meowing loudly in the hall when Steve comes to a stop outside his door. He leans down to scratch behind her ears, taps on 3C’s door, then heads inside his own apartment. Nala tries streaking past his feet, but a gentle nudge of his boot sends her scuttling backwards. He shuts the door before she can attempt another unwelcome entrance. Steve has no problem with Nala, she's a great and loving cat, but trying to get her back out of the apartment usually takes hours, and he really doesn't have time for that particular chase right now.
Steve glances at the notebook, a simple star printed on the red leather. An innocuous design, but Steve recognises it. They all do. Tony strides across the room, picks the notebook up, and immediately disappears down the stairs with it. Bucky doesn't relax, though. He's agitated, his body a line of panic and tension, practically vibrating. Tony comes back sans notebook and stops in front of Bucky. His hands hover uncertainly over the expanse of Bucky's shoulders, momentarily shaking a mere inch from the red Henley that Bucky is wearing, before Tony visibly swallows and lowers his hands to grip the others man's biceps.
“Yes, but only for Pop, because Pop’s the one marrying her. But you and Daddy? You get to see how beautiful Mommy looks before anyone else.”
Steve glares at Tony, but he knows there's no heat to it. It's more of a habitual kind of thing by now. “Low blow, Stark. Fine, we can set up a meeting with him, his parents ー”
Sighing, Tony crosses the room, drops onto the couch, and holds his head in his hands. “It’s not stupid, really, it isn’t. I just...I can’t do that to you.”
“Hey, Stevie, how are you?”
“Yeah, kiddo, the wedding is over, and it’s time for a little pipsqueak to get some sleep.” Tony leans down to kiss Peter’s forehead. “Sweet dreams, Pete. I love you.”
“Yeah, I know, no matter what I do the bitch dies, and maybe the baby, too.”
“No, no, it’s fine. C’mon, let me have it.”
when it hits the edge of the coffee-table then the dark wooden floor. The tightness in his chest makes it hard to breathe; he struggles to draw in enough oxygen. His brain feels fuzzy as if his thoughts are refusing to be contained and examined, and his pulse pounds in his ears. The only thing that’s clear is the mental image of the arc reactor that powers the Iron Man suit, the one that keeps Tony alive.
Peter nods without speaking; Steve carries him into the living room, lowers him gently onto the couch, makes sure Piggly is tucked up next to him.
. The slick drag of Tony against Steve’s insides has Steve panting for breath almost immediately. Tony moves slowly, pressing forward only once Steve has had a moment to get accustomed to the girth, and eventually, he stops with his hips against Steve’s ass.
her?”
“I wouldn't say no to coffee.”
“That's nice.”
“I love it. It's sweet and juicy, and maybe I should set you down if you're gonna eat it.”
Silence falls, and Steve stares at the table. His mind is racing, making a list of pros and cons to the proposal. If they accept Loki, they run the risk of still getting screwed, even with Frigga’s promise. If they don’t, the team is down one heavy-hitter, and it will be like shouting to every villain within the universe, “Come attack us, we’re nearly completely unprotected!” He wants to have a child, yes, but at that cost?
“Are you sure? I don’t want to impose on you any more than I already have.”

She leaves him to get settled in, the door closing with a
“Oh, uh, Parker.”
“Five… bucks…?” Tony repeats in a disbelieving tone, blinking slowly, as if he isn’t sure he’s heard Steve correctly.
“More what? More annoying? Definitely. More exhausting? Depends on what we’re doing, because believe me, you can

just ignore!”
“Then stop hiding whenever something goes wrong!” Steve sighs, crossing his arms over his chest. “You’ve been really good at talking things through with me, excluding the time before all of this started. What happened?”
Steve manages an unsteady smile. “It felt amazing, Tony.”
“If it turns out there nothing Thor or Asgard can do, then we adopt.”
Pepper sits back in her chair, blows out a breath. “I hope you’re right.”
Steve’s thrashing wildly on the bed, one arm outstretched in the air. His lips are forming silent words; he’s covered in a thin sheen of sweat, and his face is twisted like he’s in extreme pain. Tony can’t find it in him to enjoy the sight of red cotton pants decorated with tsum-tsum Iron Man figures, not while Steve’s in the tight grasp of a nightmare.
“I don’t know if that went well or not.”
i'm sick, so have a chapter a day early.
“A lump of wax in the shape of a dick? Phallic symbolism made of the byproducts of honeybees? Am I still gonna be in trouble?” Tony cackled when Steve shot him an unimpressed state. “Steve, stop glaring! This is important!”
“Hmm?”
know about it?”
“I don’t think anything of what you said is stupid, Steve. A bit unorthodox, sure. Definitely unexpected. But not stupid. You’re right. If anybody in this world could ever find a way of making male pregnancy in humans possible, it would absolutely be Tony, especially for you. Unfortunately, you’ll never know if he wants to try until you talk to him.” She stares at him, green eyes considering. “What would you do if he said no, he doesn’t children and never will?”
Pepper's eyes shine brightly under the dim lighting, and Tony turns in his chair to give Steve an assessing look. Steve shifts awkwardly, uncomfortable with the sudden scrutiny. Coulson, at least, turns his gaze away from Steve to give the man some semblance of privacy in the silence that's settled over them. Eventually, Tony clears his throat and focuses on Coulson, asking information about what he does and how he and Pepper had met. Steve knows the story ー Coulson has told him all about the deep conversation he had with the woman who attended one of the gallery showings and even purchased a large shot of Bucky and Sam holding Natasha in the air, her arms tangled in vivid red ribbons dangling from the ceiling just out of shot, each of her legs being cradled almost lovingly by the men's hands. It's one of Steve's favourite pieces; it shows off the strength in both Sam and Bucky's bodies, the tightly coiled musculature of Natasha's slender build, and the gleaming, sleek metal of Bucky's prosthetic. It isn't until Pepper says something about how beautiful it is to see Stark technology on an actual human, that Steve realises just how many chances he's had to meet Tony, but all it took, in the end, was Tony needing a last-minute babysitter that brought them together.
“No, no. Um, wait, this weekend’s my weekend with Peter.”

“I, uh, I didn't know what to bring. You're not allergic to anything are you?”
, since it's due to go to the printers in three days, but he hasn't had much luck concentrating on that comic. He has had idea after idea for the man in the metal armour and whatever adventures he should go on, so he's been able to produce much more content for it. It still isn't ready for publication, however, but he doesn't mind. He also doesn't mind that the inspiration for Iron Man’s appearance outside of his suit came from his neighbour's strikingly good looks.
, Tony! At least if I was warned, I’d be able to answer questions regarding the situation instead of being blindsided as I’m walking into work.”
Which is… It's good enough for Steve. It's more than he could have ever asked for.

“Only do it if you feel you need to. This isn’t my decision. I’ll support your choice either way.”
Sarah’s woken up by now, and her eyes, so blue and so like Steve’s, cross a bit as she takes in her surroundings. Natasha eventually passes her off to Pepper, though it’s a reluctant move. Tony sits on the edge of the hospital bed and watches his friends, his
It’s a testament to how well Tony’s come to know her that he can see her internal struggle of doubt. He’d known she’d be shocked – he’s overheard all of them talking over the past few months, debating who was going to get that place of honour; they’d all reached the same conclusion of “

“Yeah, our baby is moving.”
“– cheap, knock-off, female version of Steve that you found on the wrong side of the dumpster!”
Tony stares from across the room, the edge of the bar digging into his side; he watches the way the woman's hand slips lower on Steve's back, brushing against the perfect swell of his ass, as he raises the champagne flute in response to whatever the Army general is saying. Laughs are shared, and the woman's hand presses tighter into Steve's skin. Her rings glimmer under the fancy lighting, stones large enough to do some damage if she were to throw a punch. Not that Tony really expects her to. This is a high-profile, expensive charity gala for ー well, for whatever organisation the Maria Stark Foundation decided on. Tony isn't necessarily sure, but he can't find it in him to care. Not when Steve isn't blushing a bright red at the woman's touches. Not when Tony's entire brain is focused on that small hand on a broad back, only mere inches from the most perfect ass Tony has ever seen, and
“No, definitely not. He’s… he’s a great guy.”
Tony’s gaze drifts from Clint, finally lands on Steve, and Steve knows without a doubt that his cheeks are a furious shade of red. Phil gently pushes Steve’s feet off his legs, helping the blond to stand, and Steve makes his way to Tony’s side. The heat in his cheeks doesn’t fade, but he kisses Tony through the embarrassment. Steve sighs into the kiss, one that’s been five weeks overdue.
had settled down eventually; the man had had it all, by the looks of things: a thriving business after the war, a secret agency that he built from the ground up that had international connections and the power to rid the world of threats unfathomable to the rest of humanity, a wife, a kid. And here is Steve, trying desperately to push through the heartbreak, pain, loneliness, and the immense, unshakeable feeling that he doesn’t belong here ー of being out of place, out of
