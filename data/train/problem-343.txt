“That man, his name is Sherlock Holmes.”
“Of course not.”
John’s arm tightened their hold around him and the small gesture brought him security and the very rare feeling of love. He was a fool to let this continue, but he could not bear to think of himself without it.
The belligerent man laughed and pushed him again. Out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock saw that the two were not alone. The group of men circled around Sherlock, staring at him with hungry eyes, waiting for the chance to tear him to shreds.
Sherlock walked down the street. He scowled at the cold weather and pulled his coat tighter around his neck. He had hurt John. To him, this was even worse than causing John physical harm. He had broken his heart. How could he be so stupid? How could John not feel hurt from the way he recoiled from his touch? Did John not know? The only reason why Sherlock leapt from his seat in that manner was because he liked the way John’s hand slowly approached his groin and it terrified him to the point where he had to flee. Why did he torment John so? Why did he have to be so...why did he have to be the person he was?
“Sleep, as is expected.”
“Cold, isn’t it?”
“Patrick?”
“Oi! Shut your mouth and look.”
Sherlock nodded and pointed at the suit.
“You are quite smart. Of course, I doubt that you shall learn faster than my John.”
With that, Sherlock felt John’s hand detach from his own. No, no, not John too. He could not lose him too.
Sherlock felt John’s hold slacken and frowned a bit. He regretting telling him, should’ve dealt with the pain. He closed his eyes when he felt John’s damp fingers run through his hair and he nearly mewled when John began to massage his scalp, silently begging him not to stop. Was John going to wash his hair? Sherlock wanted him to. He needed John to lather the soap in his hair and whisper sweet nothings into his ear while he did it. Was this his sickness or was it John’s magical fingers that were putting him to sleep?
Sherlock could not contain himself, he wanted to see John in the suit, he could not wait a moment longer.
--------
“Detective...Geoff?”
“Ms. Donovan,” Sherlock said dismissively. “Without your Anderson I see.”
Sherlock only smiled, but the flush from his cheeks did not leave him. It was only a result of his sickness and he hoped that it would fade away. John slid the robe off of his shoulders and let it fall to the floor. Sherlock immediately wrapped the towel around his waist, as the heated perspiration of his body did not mix well with the cold draft of the flat. John ushered him into the warm water and went to retrieve Sherlock’s change of clothes. When he entered their room he rummaged through the surprisingly organized drawers. He found undergarments, as well as Sherlock’s sleep clothes, and a new robe. When he returned to Sherlock, the man’s eyes were shut, his head resting against the ledge of the tub.
Sebastian looked down, his cheeks tinted red. “I... I’ve come to deliver this.” In his hand, there was a letter. Sherlock’s eyes flickered up to Sebastian, who seemed guiltier than anything.
Not even the loudest crack of thunder could rouse him, the intensity of which could only mean it struck nearby.
John’s cheeks coloured as well at the new knowledge, his mind immediately conjuring images of Sherlock touching himself, filling himself up with his fingers.
“You know, I never thought I would make it this far.” Moriarty half-shouted over the roar of the water. They were now on the cliff inside the falls. There was barely any room to walk, yet there they both stood, talking.
“Thomas, you’ll help us, yeah? Your friend can get us out of here and you’ll never see us again. We’ll leave, packed and ready before nightfall o-or he’ll kill us!”
“Has the fire proved boring?” Sherlock laughed at his own jest.
“Sherlock, I understand you’ve a need to conduct your experimentations. Do be mindful of the cold and bring your coat this time. You know how easy it is to fall ill.”
“I have merely sustained a wound to the head, nothing more.”
“I believe I know what I am already in the mood for.”
“They are...away for the moment. I have been left alone and this is such a beautiful country I had a thought to take a walk. How glad I am to have gained that temporary feeling of courage.” His eyes flickered to John’s own and made his heart swell.
With a rush of madness, he tore the page out of the book slowly, careful not to rip the image. His eyes bore into every detail that was illustrated on the paper. He suddenly let out a sob and hugged the drawing to his chest. He was careful not to ruin the centuries-old sketch. He smiled, but then he frowned as he looked over at the photograph on his dresser.
“Shut it, freak! What do you want?”
John saved him. He rushed to his aid, clad in nothing more than a robe, and saved Sherlock from his attackers. What did he do to deserve such a wonderful person like John? He created him, yes, but he did not think that his creation would turn into such an honourable man. Sherlock sighed and grasped the box tighter to his side. It was bent at the edges, and covered in the mud that it was dropped in. He let out a sigh, he was eternally grateful that they had not gotten to the box. They would have opened it, and they would have destroyed it. John would have been crushed.
Sebastian nodded and turned toward the inn. Before he began walking, he said, “Moriarty is a wicked man, Sherlock. He will not stop, he will hound us and harass us at every corner. The only way to be free of him...is….”
“Yes, and I regret ever doing so.”
John nudged him. “Honestly, Sherlock.”
They were all the same. They did not understand him, for all they said to him when he was younger, they did not understand a single thing about him.
She made her way to the entrance but Sherlock grabbed her arm before she could leave. Her brow rose at the contact.
Sherlock’s voice had not reached its baritone. John sighed, this was the Sherlock Holmes that only he was allowed to see. This what Sherlock could have been if they had known each other their whole lives, well, if John had been human and alive. Sherlock being this soft, this gentle, it stirred the deepest feelings of love and intimacy within John. He still wished for Sherlock to open up to him, and to love him inside and outside. But he would not push Sherlock if he did not wish to have sex, Sherlock would confide in him when he was ready, of that he had no doubt. He was perfectly content to love Sherlock just as they were now.
John hummed and watched Sherlock exit their flat. Immediately, John jumped up and watched out of the window. Sherlock had just climbed into a hansom cab. He sighed and returned to his spot on the floor.
------------
“A palm is four fingers, a foot is four palms....” He muttered to himself. It was nearly eight o’clock and Sherlock was hunched over his desk, hair wild from unkemptness, eyes wide from manic determination. Just another addition to the second-to-last note, one more look at the encyclopedia, a break to wipe the fatigue from his eyes. He could not be burdened with the needs of his body.Hunger, his bladder, and weariness all could not prevail upon him to satisfy them.. He set the pen down and read the newest sheet of notes. They would do. If he edited them any further he would surely go mad.
“John! Do as he says.”
John did not respond, only watched with a solemn face as Sherlock dressed himself again and left the flat.
Then came the thought of how they would bring him to life. Would it be as sudden and magnificent as John’s awakening was? Would it be painful and loud? How would this man, who lay upstairs unconscious, dead,  turn out to be? The prospects frightened and excited John. He loved the adrenaline, but he could not help but dread it. This man, Moriarty, could destroy their very lives - would the provision of a companion really eradicate such threats?
“You would not have made it had we not run into your confidante.” Sherlock replied shortly.
“John, calm yourself. I have no broken bones and our task was successful. Our first priority is to tend to him, for we have laboured tirelessly to bring him to life.”
“Tired?”
“John!”
John’s gentle hand rose to cup Sherlock’s cheek, a steady but soft gaze meeting his own of sadness and insecurity. “Oh, my dear Holmes. You do not see yourself as I see you. It is true I have not experienced much of this world but this feeling I cannot doubt. It is singular and frightening - I would be terrified to think any other could make me feel the same. I love you to a degree that I can barely contain. I cannot even imagine a life without you and that short moment when I thought I might have to live one as such at the falls, was devastating. You created me and your love sustains me. You, Sherlock. Only, and ever, you.”
That caught Sherlock’s attention. “Oh?”
“John.”
“Oh? What is it?”
“Bloody hell! What happened here?”
“How do you suppose this will work?”
“Fortunately, John witnessed the whole altercation and rushed to my aid. An inspector by the name of Lestrade apprehended the aggressors and allowed John and myself to go.”
They had won.
“Michael?”
“I have never done such a thing, I-I-I would not know where to even begin!”
The man only stared, but followed Sherlock as he was led out of the room. Sherlock ran a bath for him, and he watched as the water filled up the small tub. Sherlock could not help but smile as he observed the other’s actions and behaviors. The world was so new to him, he had not yet experienced the emotions and sensations, or beheld the wonders that it offered him. At one point, he put his hand into the water, he must have been startled by his reflection. Sherlock shook his head and removed the hand from the bath.
“What is this?”
“A pleasant surprise?”
Returning back to Baker Street brought relief to both men. Although Sebastian was not in tow to fill the flat up with his added presence, both men were relieved to find the sense of gaping loss gone from their spirits. Sebastian was learning to make his way with Mrs. Hudson’s guidance, free to make his own choices now and free to develop his own character. Certainly John found himself feeling nostalgic as he recalled memories of raising Sebastian in their flat but they left him with a little smile instead of regret and guilt.
John stretched and sat up.
“I fear it is not as fanciful as you would prefer, Mrs. Hudson. He was advised by a friend that I was in need of a flatmate and he was as well. I think even you can gather that we were quite satisfied with each other and agreed upon the flatshare.”
His smile vanished once he realized that drawings and notes were only half the work needing completion.
She took a few deep breaths and answered him in a calmer tone.
Sherlock’s breath hitched as he felt John’s tongue lave his nipple, tug at it with his teeth. He was losing control of his body, becoming pliant under John’s ministrations so that all he knew was the need to chase the sensations John was bestowing upon him. His back arched under John’s tongue, testicles still finding friction against John’s thigh.
Sherlock sighed and grabbed John’s hand. He nearly sobbed when he felt John’s hand squeeze his own. “The very same reason you have just told me, my John...my dear John, love of my life....you will aid me without a doubt and that will result in your demise. My brother died protecting me and I will be damned if you will go down in the same fashion. I will not have your blood on my hands, John...I cannot. Moriarty is not your enemy.”
“Perish the thought. I have only stepped out for a moment. It appears that I neglected to bring my novels with me and you were still asleep. A walk is an excellent cure for boredom, I should think.”
“Same goes for you lot, this happens again and you’ll be sharing a cell, understand?”
The second strike caused blood to trickle down his face.
Her feet finally budged but she couldn’t take her eyes off of him. Eventually, she decided to leave well enough alone and walked away. Sherlock, however, just finished digging and opened the coffin. He gagged at the scent that wafted up into his nose. He started to hack away at the man’s legs with the shovel’s blade. Minutes later, he finally got the limbs to come off. He placed them inside of the sack he brought with him. He moved on to find his next victim, a marquis named Aloysius. There he found the proper arms. A torso came from Henry Ackerly - not quite defined but Sherlock found it suitable -  who died from a gun wound to the shoulder and bled out instantly. He was thirty-seven years of age, as the inscription read. The head was found last. The top  of the headstone was worn away and jagged, displeasing to the eye unlike all the other smooth stones. The family who bought it was probably not as wealthy as the rest of the others who had their loved ones buried here.
“It was not until his death that I realized my hate for him was because of his very act of dying. It was then that I realized that I was alone, and there is nothing more terrifying than being lonely.”
He had done it. He had created his Vitruvian Man.
“About half a month.”
Sherlock swallowed hard. He didn’t want John to see how his eyes watered at the way he was being spoken to by the one person who had never talked to him like that. Only a few hours ago, John held so much love, so much regard towards Sherlock, and now...it was as if John could barely stand to look at him. Sherlock clenched his hands together, wanted to make sure that he could keep the urge to cry at bay. This story would take an eternity to tell if Sherlock were to break down now.
Moriarty smirked devilishly and closer to Sherlock’s face. “Declaring your homosexual inclinations to an asylum would prove to be sufficient, I believe you will agree?”
“I would listen to her. She seems the smarter one.”
Sherlock’s eyes flicked over the third shelf as he latched onto a ridiculous idea, honing in on the assorted books written to satiate its readers intrigued by science, as Sherlock was. He had the means, both the knowledge and the monetary. Would he dare to do it? Would he attempt to recreate his brother? He shook his head and sighed.
John was munching away at his morning toast when Sherlock burst into the room, grinning like a madman and whirling about as gracefully as a cat.
“Sherlock.”
“You murdered an innocent child, Moriarty. I hardly doubt that a normal person would do such a thing.”
Thomas’ eyes widened. Cheekbones, eye color - Sally’s description was brief but she managed to tell him enough to bring a person instantly to mind. Sherlock did appear to be sporting a few bruises on his face. Was he the one they so viciously attacked?
“And?” The other woman asked. “How did it go?”
“Are you certain?”
“Did you think this was normal? I regret calling you clever now.”
Sherlock humphed, followed by soft snoring. John smiled and began stroking the curls as he continued, “Would this suit you?”
“If you will excuse us, we will take our leave.”
He didn’t respond. The house would not be empty, the maids would still remain, but he knew what she meant. The best decision was not always the easiest, he wanted to tell her but he could not will himself to say another word. Consolation was never his area.
“Are you listening?”
“Well...you and your meddlesome brother, obviously.”
“And remember that you’ve family here that miss you terribly. Do try to keep in contact.”
“Your attention seems to be solely on the roast, you’ve completely ignored the mash and the peas and carrots as well.”
“Mr. Banville.”
She nodded again and watched as the coach rode off into the night.
John slowly and quietly got up and began walking to their room, with Sherlock in tow. John was the first to settle into the bed and Sherlock crawled underneath the covers right after. He nestled himself next to John and smiled when John wrapped a protective arm around him.
“It is food, John. You are to eat it.”
Sherlock hesitated. What would he say to her?
John’s smile could have warmed the carriage if it were any stronger.
Lady Martin smirked. “I would prefer to not make his acquaintance again.”
John quirked a brow in response, “I do not believe I am capable of stopping. You are a fascinating man, Sherlock. I may not have powers of observation such as you do but that does not mean I do not find wonder in observing you.”
John took Sherlock’s wrist and was not surprised when Sherlock winced even though his actions had been careful.
“I...do not like being with you or Moriarty. You are cruel men who deserve no place on this earth. It is not I who is the abomination, it is the both of you!”
“John.”
Sherlock relied on John for support to ascend the steps into their flat. He could barely stand on his own, the gang that attacked him achieving their incentive to hurt him. He could hear John’s voice as they neared the front door. Sweet nothings, Sherlock told himself. Those kind words that John whispered to him, they meant nothing, they were only meant to calm Sherlock down from the shock of the beating he experienced
“Even with all the sand and the heat?”
“No. I am nervous - because I have never done this with another person, man or woman - but I am no longer scared. I trust you, John.” Sherlock’s eyes met his and John could see nothing but truth.
His face did not change, Sherlock ran his hands through his curls. He could stand to bathe as well. Sherlock yawned, but continued the name search. He felt as if he was talking to a wall instead of a person.
“I am not an abomination!”
Sherlock nearly faltered at the attempt. He could not leave this undone, Moriarty summoned him and he must answer. With a deep and shaky breath, he turned around and began his journey to the Reichenbach Falls.
Sherlock rose a brow, amused, “Now who was it that once told me that sarcasm is the lowest form of wit? Was it you or another dashing man?”
John pressed his hands together and looked away from Sherlock. He was embarrassed. In a matter of moments, Sherlock made his way over to his companion and placed both hands upon his shoulders.
Sherlock smiled and shifted up.
“Well here is news: Good afternoon Mrs. Hudson, I’ve not seen you in months, but I would like you to house a close friend of ours.”.
“Yes, yes. We will be taking our leave, if you do not mind.”
“Does it even matter? He’s dead now and we’ve things to discuss.”
“All of this. Does it not bring you discomfort to draw up notes, to design a body for another male? Do you not see any fault with this?”
The smack of skin, the creak of the bed, and the noises that left their lips filled the room.
John chuckled. “What if we land on Australia?”
Moriarty smirked and stood inches away from Sherlock’s face. “Well then, are you ready to die?”
“Earlier this week, I was subject to a rather hostile group of miscreants, Mrs. Hudson. They claimed to have seen me visiting Mycroft’s grave on the night of my departure from the manor. They assumed that my presence in the cemetery was due to a...perverse infatuation with corpses. They then proceeded to...attack me...just outside my flat.”
“Perhaps I shall. How elegant you look reclined in your seat, long legs stretched out. How beautiful your throat looked bared as you tipped your head back. How the light now dances in your eyes. Those are only a few of the observations I have made. You are a smart man, do you not see how they overwhelm me? Why I cannot do anything but continue to look at you, entranced?”
John removed his finger and stared at Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded at the compliment. He went into the kitchen to bring the food out, returning shortly with the tray and setting it on the table. He was about to head back into the kitchen before he felt John’s gentle fingers wrap around his wrist.
“I’ve finished my food.”
John frowned but returned to disinfecting Sherlock’s face.
“What if the electricity still resides within the body, John?”
John stared at Sherlock’s lips as he said the word. He then took a deep breath and attempted to say it again.
“I would like to say yes, but it has not as of late. As I’ve said before, I do miss your company.”
“There is beauty in death, I suppose.”
Sherlock flashed a genial smile towards the elderly man.
John rubbed his nose against Sherlock’s and lightly guided him off his lap. He waited patiently as Sherlock dressed and prepared himself for the day, although he wondered how Sherlock would react to the sight of Sebastian standing just beyond the door. Sherlock smoothed his shirt out and looked over at John.
Sherlock nodded, his mother had doted on him whenever she had the chance. Even upon her deathbed she had found ways to spoil him. Mrs. Hudson pulled out an envelope from her apron pocket and handed it to Sherlock. It had his name written on it in Mycroft’s elegant scrawl. Sherlock’s eyes flickered up at Mrs. Hudson’s. She only smiled and said, “A letter I was entrusted to give to you. It was his only request to me in his last days.”
John rubbed his eyes and walked over to the table. Sherlock took his seat and motioned for John to do the same. John looked down at the plate in front of him. He picked it up and brought it to his nose, Sherlock placed a hand on his mouth to hide the chuckle from his companion.
Sherlock could not help but chuckle. What was it about the night that made everyone so sentimental? The both of them especially. He kissed John again and replied, “That would be oxygen.”
John only kissed his wet lips and ushered him to the world of sleep. When he awoke in the morning, John was sprawled out on a makeshift bed beside Sherlock’s own. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and stared at his treasured companion with a sad smile. He told John the dangers of being caught in public days ago and John had kissed him in response. He wondered how long John stayed with him until he finally retired himself. Sherlock had rarely seen John sleep before, but from the few times he had witnessed him in the throes of slumber, it had always made Sherlock feel as if he deserved it. He did. He deserved everything for being so unwaveringly attentive and caring.
Thomas’ brows furrowed and his mood changed drastically.
John’s brows were furrowed; his mouth quivered as he tried to speak. Sherlock smiled softly- how new to the earth he was. The body of an adult he possessed, but he retained the intelligence of a newborn infant, only freed from his mother’s womb mere hours ago. Sherlock only realized after John had reanimated that he would have no knowledge of even the simplest things, such as talking. It was of little bother to him, he would teach John every language in the world if he so wished to learn, all that mattered to Sherlock was John. Sherlock feared that he was caught in a waking dream, that none of this was real, only an illusion created by his darkened mind. He wondered how long it would take before he would awake in his cold and lonely room with no John. He did not care, if this was a dream he would bask in every moment that he got to spend with John, no matter how painful it would be to wake from such a tender imagining.
Sherlock was ill-equipped to deal with such words. He only meant to while away the time! Fortunately, the tub would be filled to the brim by now and his time in the bath would be ample enough to form responses for John’s words.
Sherlock looked away from those kind eyes. There was no way he could possibly explain, why wouldn’t John leave him be?
“I shall wear it as soon as I am able.”
“As long as we’ve some eggs in our meals, I have no preference for breakfast.”
“Your fever has broken, thankfully so. How do you feel?”
Sherlock merely shook his head and begun to fiddle with his hands. He could not tell John that he was hated by society at large. He would be angry to discover that he risked his freedom for a man that no one liked. He pushed John away softly and reached for his coat. John grabbed his hand, forcing him to release the coat, and guided it back over to his lap.
“Sherlock, I’ve gathered the medical supplies from upstairs,” John spoke as he returned.
“Yes.”
Letting out a sigh, John laid down on the floor, a feeling of nostalgia surging through him as his head made contact with the cold wood.
--------
“Alas, I will not violate you in such a way, brother dear. You have struggled and you now have your chance to rest, be at peace. To dig your corpse up for my selfish reasons would be a grave sin. I am sorry, Mycroft.”
Sherlock shook his head.
Sherlock’s eyes flickered over to the body on the cot. The legs were attached to the torso already but because he had to stitch the body parts together, hideous black sutures were visible against the colourless skin. Sherlock wished he was better with a needle and thread as well so that the body might look more natural. He sighed and began to stitch the left arm to  the torso, stopping briefly to admire the scar that graced the shoulder. To anyone else, it would be unseemly, an aberration, grotesque. To Sherlock, the scar looked, in a few ways, like the sun. The bullet entered the center of the shoulder without precision, resulting in scar tissue that flared out like the rays of the sun. Sherlock found it beautiful, he also found himself melancholic that the man died from such a wound.
“What are you doing, John?”
He choked on a sob that still let out a sound despite his efforts, and before he knew it, John was already holding him close and whispering, “It’ll be alright”, “You’ll be okay” which made his ability to withhold his tears become even more difficult. He did it, though. He didn’t how, but he did not cry, he did not sob. He was able to calm down, and all the bad thoughts in his mind gave way to John. A smiling John, a sweet John, a guardian John, a kind John, a John who was the love of his life.
“God’s sake, Holmes! Do as I say and pull the paper up.”
He turned to face the carriage again, but after a moment of stillness, faced Mrs. Hudson once more.
“If you will let me, I would like to buy you a new wardrobe.”
“Yes, quite right.”
“Could the lightning have struck me?”
Sebastian’s eyes opened once again only to take in the position, and then they were closed and remained that way. Sherlock was sure that John had successfully put Sebastian to sleep. No matter how recently the man had found life, his body was bound to be fatigued and exhausted now that his pulse was calm.
----------
Sebastian swallowed and dug his fingers into his bandage.
Sherlock snorted and John would have been offended had he not looked so pitiful in his sickness.
“Sherlock is not with you? Have you come alone?”
“I shall see you again, in another life perhaps.”
John sounded absolutely devastated. Sherlock could not bring himself to tell him the truth. All he’d done over the course of the day was upset John. It began at breakfast when he had John believe that he was the cause for his sadness, and now, all he had done was run out to buy him clothes, but here they both were. Why didn’t John leave him? Why doesn’t John leave him now? He would not be surprised if he woke up the next morning to find the flat depressingly empty. Maybe there would be a note, if John’s writing skills were as good as Sherlock hoped, or there would be nothing at all. It would only be the feeling of abandonment and Sherlock would have to come to terms with it once again.
“So you will not allow my aid?”
---------
“‘Poor sod’? I take it we know him?”
“Surely I am dreaming, or I have caught fever. You two, here again, it warms my heart.”
“Why keep such a thing secret, Sherlock?” His voice lowered, “I love you a great deal, I will do anything to keep you safe, you know this. Why, love, would you think to keep me in the dark?”
John chuckled and Sherlock felt the vibrations course through his body. John leaned forward and reached for the soaps to begin the task of washing Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock closed his eyes again as John took his time to massage his scalp and cover every curl on his head with the lavender and mint soap.
Hello Readers! This is co-author Chanolay here. I took the reigns on this chapter and I just wanted to apologize to you all for it being so late! Aside from being busy with school and work, I've never really written anything even this short of a length on my own before so I ran into a few bumps along the way. Either way, I hope you all enjoy it! Comments are loved and welcomed.
“Be calm. Mycroft shall not be harming anyone.”
“They have not seriously harmed you, have they John?”
“You will want to eventually. I’d rather you do it now so that, maybe, I will not be so pained”
“If I might ask, what is your name?”
“Yes, love?”
“You do not wish me to lay with you so I shall take my leave.”
“What would you have me do then, Sherlock? To live in a house where I’ve no master?”
“Give me your hand, Sebastian,” Sherlock had to use a little more force in his voice, he regretted it, but Sebastian finally complied and placed his hand in Sherlock’s grasp. He whimpered when Sherlock moved to roll up the sleeve. There it was, the darkened mark against pale skin, angry red that showed violence. It looked fresh and was no doubt being irritated by the material of Sebastian’s jacket.
Sherlock moved to touch his face. He was cold with no hint of blood rushing to his face. He had been sure that the electricity would be enough to shock the heart into starting. Would they need to do it again? Sherlock would have to wet him with water in order for it to work this time. Unless…
John kissed him. “How long do we have until his visit is due?”
John closed his eyes and said, “It appears I am too weary to move. You must help me change, Sherlock.”
Sebastian looked up at Mrs. Hudson wide-eyed and then shifted his focus over to Sherlock and John. Sherlock shook his head. “Do not worry, we will provide for him, at least, until you deem it necessary for him to be paid.”
There was a knock at the door, prompting Sherlock to answer it. It was a boy not more than twenty years of age with a bag of letters and items that needed to be delivered. Sherlock could scarcely believe it - there was a letter in the post for him. He thanked the young man and closed the door behind him. John had taken a seat upon the chesterfield and Sherlock took a seat beside him. He opened the letter without a word and read it. John waited patiently for Sherlock to relay to him what the letter said. Sherlock set the paper down next to him and stared blankly towards the fireplace.
“You will follow us and we will clothe you, feed you, and find you a suitable spot to rest, unless you would prefer to remain here, in the nude, alone, and no doubt cold.”
Sebastian’s face looked hopeful. “It is not too much to ask if I may accompany you back to your inn? I have sorely missed the sight of your faces.”
“And how do you think we shall obtain such a force? My suggestion was not resolute, I am not sure if I spoke of something possible, yet you would indulge in my impossible theories?”
They both shared a kiss, tired and happy,
“Yes, we will see our Baker Street yet again, my dear Watson.” Both smiled at the idea. Sherlock was the one to break the embrace, although every fiber in his being wanted nothing more than to remain in John’s arms, Moriarty be damned.
Albert replied, “I’m not quite sure what I did to prove a worthy companion that evening, however, I am quite glad.”
“Where’ve you gone off to? Barely a word before you disappeared into the night.”
John smirked and ruffled Sebastian’s hair. “You grow smarter each day and I must applaud you now on how well you handled his black moods. While we do not understand much more than him, he is rather inexperienced when it comes to emotions. I only wish you to know that he does hold affection in his heart, and that he did not truly hate you. Just the way he felt toward you.”
“Hush, I’m going to remove your clothes, and you are going to have your bath and love every moment of it.”
“Such words you say…” Sherlock trailed off towards the end. Why was John so kind to him? How long had he spent reading those books on biology and the practices of medicine solely for the purpose of treating Sherlock’s wounds and ailments? He must have done it while Sherlock slept. He studied every word, examined every picture, all for Sherlock. The wounded man shook his head in disbelief, it was the perfect man he set out to create, and a perfect man John had become. The way he fussed at Sherlock’s left cheek. From the amount of rags John used on it, he deduced that the cut was wide, but not deep enough to require stitches. That, Sherlock was grateful for. The flat was deathly quiet as John cleaned the cuts scattered across Sherlock’s face. He could not help but realize that each time John looked at one of the wounds, his eyes lit with something Sherlock could not determine. He was upset, of course he was, Sherlock saw how dangerous he looked when Gregory broke up the fight; how he knew that John could destroy the inspector effortlessly if Sherlock had not stopped him. He was so fierce and protective of...of him.
John’s nose twitched but he pressed the situation.
“I would be ashamed if they were to be jailed for any other reason, other than being belligerent arseholes that is.”
Thomas let out a bitter laugh. “And how shall I do that?”
“Did Moriarty do this to you?” John’s tone was dark and Sebastian could do little else but nod. “It is my fault, I was not supposed to leave, but I did not listen, and I would not tell him where I was. I am no good, John. I am supposed to be strong but I cry. I did not want to hurt that man Moriarty disliked but I did. I do not like the cigarettes and the liquor they make me drink but I consume then anyway. Why would you waste your time on a being like me?”
Sherlock nodded and she scurried off, leaving him alone. He found his way to the sitting room and took his seat right in front of the fire. Mycroft would have been in here already, reading a book, or helping himself to a cup of tea. He would have given Sherlock a look of disgust at the current sight of him, and tell him how improper it was to trail mud and rainwater into the house. Sherlock would not have listened, of course, but now he would sacrifice a great deal to hear Mycroft scold him once more.
“Did Mycroft know? Of your...preferences?”
Thomas exhaled and removed his hands from his face. He took a tired sip from his drink and nodded.
Sherlock’s eyes looked sunken in, as if the very thought of their punishment brought him great distress.
He looked down at it. The tear stains on his cheeks obvious against ashen pale skin of depression and malnourishment.
John placed the waistcoat back inside of the box and went to Sherlock to give him yet another kiss.
Sherlock wanted to believe him. Lestrade truly seemed ignorant as to the actual reason why Sherlock came. Moriarty was toying with him. He was sadistic so why wouldn’t he torment Sherlock with the one thing that scared him the most? He had Sebastian, and nearly ruined Sherlock and John’s relationship to have him. He broke John’s heart, and that Sherlock could not forgive. Moriarty was a parasite; he wouldn’t stop until he’s drained everything from Sherlock. What would he do next? How would he win this game? How could Sherlock possibly defeat him?
John smiled and nodded, lying back on the couch. He heard Sherlock open the door and rose from his spot in a last minute decision. Once Sherlock entered his room, John followed right behind him. He closed the door, causing Sherlock to turn around.
“Good night, John.”
“No, it would not.”
“This is not his battle. Where is your minion?”
“Weren’t much time for talking, Thom.”
“No, I am fine.”
“He was a child!” Thomas shouted back. His gun was shaking, whether his resolve was waning or he was becoming dangerously close to shooting one of them, John could not tell. John huffed and stood straight, to show Thomas that he was not weak and neither was Sebastian.
“Sherlock.”
One of the other women giggled and they changed the subject. Sherlock’s pew creaked, a sign that someone had decided to join him. He looked to his left and saw the older man, the one who cried while lowering Mycroft’s casket. His hair was greying but Sherlock could still see faint strands of the pure ebony the man would have sported in his younger years. He smiled at Sherlock and then put his elbows on the edge of the pew in front of him, pressing his hands together. He was praying and Sherlock stared at him while he did.
He sniffled and wiped the tears hanging from the tip of his nose. With a great effort, he rose from his bed and staggered over to the bookshelf. He retrieved one and opened it. The first image was Leonardo Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man.
“To think, Mrs. Hudson had this in her possession all this time. Why would she think to bequeath the note to me now?”
John smirked and took his seat at the edge of the bed.
Now Sherlock was rubbing his thumb against John’s hand. He had not let go since they entered the carriage. They were gone from Baker Street now and John did not know the buildings they passed. He wished that Sherlock would change his mind and give up whatever goose chase he was taking them on so they could return to Baker Street. He did not belong anywhere other than their flat - Moriarty had made that evidently clear.
“...He was...unhappy. I’m sure that brings you joy.”
Thank you all again for reading!
“I’ve laid everything of note in his study.”
“Yes please.”
“Our plans or tomorrow?”
“Thank you…” Was all John muttered. Sherlock thought it best if he set off now and leave John alone. He went to his room and returned with his coat. He stopped in front of the door and turned to John, who was now seated in front of his treasured fire.
“Rubbish.”
“You’ve not smiled in days. Am I at fault?”
Sherlock turned his gaze to John. He was already attempting to get him to speak?
“Right. I know this bloke,” He kicked the man’s limp leg, “And I know her. Troublemakers they are, I let him off with a warning last time, this time I’ll not be so kind.”
“Pardon?”
Sherlock’s face softened at John’s confession.
“Yes. After all this time, it does not even feel real.”
“Watson.”
A million questions formed in her mind at the odd request but she nodded her head and scurried off to send the message. Sherlock waited until she was gone before he left. There was no rain this time, better for him to get things done. He placed a cap on his head and moved as quickly as he could. Thankfully there was no one else on the streets since having the elite as neighbors meant that everyone was to be in their homes and in bed before midnight. Yet another social rule he didn’t care for.
He finished the last sip of tea just as John made his way to the bed and pressed a kiss against his cheek.
Sherlock sat up in his bed and shifted his position so that his feet touched the icy floor. The chill from the wood invigorated him. He sniffled as he stared at the photograph of Mycroft and himself. Sherlock wiped away the tear that fell from his eye.
“J-awn. You’ve nearly got it!”
“When Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase, every one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no doubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville himself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his duty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms….”
John nodded. Sherlock took note of the slight shiver in John’s frame.
John’s mouth quivered as he opened it.
Sherlock slammed his hands down on the table, causing John to start a bit.
Lestrade mused this over before responding. “Do you know what? He talked to Donovan and Anderson. I had them detained here after the mishap in front of your flat. They went on for a while before he left. Haven’t seen him since, but those two continue to grace the Yard with their presence.”
John’s eyes flickered over to Sherlock’s. He wanted Sherlock’s approval, he wanted to be able to agree with the statement, or was he to pleading? Did he want for Sherlock to divert Moriarty’s attention? The lack of silence confirmed the man’s suspicions.
John’s hands roved over Sherlock’s back and down over the curves of his arse, wanting so badly for the barrier of clothing to be gone. He tugged down at Sherlock’s robe, letting the navy silk slide to the floor. The detective was on the same train of thought, slender fingers going to the button of John’s vest and then his shirt after the first piece hit the ground.
At such an quick pace, they were on the brink of coming within seconds but John did not slow. He kept pushing in deep until they were both flung over the edge, falling into the white hot pleasure of climax. Sherlock’s cum painted stripes on John’s stomach at the same time that ejaculate filled the already tight space of Sherlock’s arse around John.
“I may not have been placed on this world...by natural means, but I am not alone, Thomas. I have John, who shares the same unique ties to this world as I. I have Sherlock, and although we began on the wrong foot, I care for him as well as John. They are family to me, regardless of blood we do not share or which woman birthed me. I was birthed from Sherlock and John, and though not ideal, it is my lot in life and I should think that I have come to terms with it now. It does not matter to me whether they cared to create me before you appeared in their lives. If they were content to be together, there is little I can do to change that. I am here now, created as a bargaining chip for you, but I am loved by John and by Sherlock.”
Sherlock nearly laughed at John’s sheer excitement to see what Sherlock had gotten him. He lifted his coat up and handed him the mistreated box. John’s face dropped slightly at the sight, causing Sherlock to worry deeply.
“I have. All that is left is his awakening.”
He was getting through to John. Sherlock saw the way his feet moved as if he were about to walk over to Sherlock. Sherlock crossed his arms and smirked.
Sherlock stood in front of the waterfall and admired it. It was a gorgeous creation of nature. If only he were there only to admire it and not for a final confrontation with Moriarty. The only thing he wished was that John would get out of this safely. He would leave with Sebastian and they would find a home somewhere that was not Baker Street, somewhere safe with no reminders of this day or their time here.
“Really? I did not know.”
“Sir Banville? Out looking for that pathetic abomination you created for me.”
“Why. Are. We. Here. Sherlock?” John’s voice was grave and his face became completely devoid of emotion. Sherlock cursed himself. He had not planned on Sebastian turning up and ruining everything, but John would have become wise eventually. That was the thing about his John, he was pretty damn smart.
He ignored the smug look on his face.
Another sly chuckle left his mouth as he pulled a gun from his jacket pocket.
Huuugee thank you to my co-author and beta writer for helping me with the chapter and for the amazing ending as well!
His mind raced as he ran up and down the flat, tirelessly searching for a way to locate John, he even called for his dearest companion in the hopes that maybe he was able to defend himself from his attacker and was now recovering somewhere in the flat. Of course that was not the case. It wasn’t until Sherlock made his way to the fireplace that he found a card on the mantelpiece.
“How would I carry out such a plan?”
Before Sherlock could even formulate an answer, John approached them with a grin, their luggage in hand. Mrs. Hudson’s face showed slight astonishment but she greeted John in the same manner she did Sherlock. When they entered the manor, John’s jaw nearly came undone as he took in the size of the place. It was so different from the flat that they lived in that it was as if they had entered a world entirely different to the one they knew - or the one John knew. Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson were in the midst of conversation while John gaped at everything within his sight.
Yes he did.
Sherlock’s eyes closed and it was then he realized that he wanted John more than anything in the world.
“Mrs. Hudson…”
A big thank you to Olivia for being my beta writer and for taking time out of her busy schedule to help me with the story. Thank you so much!
“What you have had the fortune of missing was my descent into complete and utter despair. I’d gone days without eating, drinking sleeping. It was at Mrs. Hudson’s insistence that I would consume anything more than a slice of toast and a cup of tea. I have never felt more alone than after his passing John, you must understand. There were even nights were I contemplated the thought of death and how I would be able to take my own life.” Sherlock took a shaking breath in, thankful there were no tears.
“The words you say, Sherlock.”
Sherlock turned to face him with soft eyes. His demeanor was unusually quiet.
With that, she exited the room. Sherlock stretched his aching limbs and then rose from the bed, careful not to disturb John. He was glad that he had not brought his whole wardrobe to Baker Street, while he was sure Mrs. Hudson would not mind him wearing the same outfit from yesterday, he found it scandalous thanks to years of Mycroft’s complaints. He stared at the coat draped over the chair, brilliant, it had little spots of dirt from his visit. He had a mind to leave it to Mrs. Hudson’s care, but once he left this manor he knew that it would be a long while before he would ever return.
Sherlock closed his mouth and formed an awkward smile. “I-I am...Sebastian.”
They thought he enjoyed the sight of dead bodies. One part of Sherlock was relieved that was all they gathered from his appearance in the graveyard that night, the other was revolted that he would be aroused from such a horrid sight. He was shoved again before a fist met his cheek. He could try to fight them off but there were too many. He curled himself into a ball as protection from their kicks and blows reminded of his time as a child when this was a regular occurrence.
Sherlock let out a sigh and nodded. John was right, he was always right. He went to put his jacket on and gave John one last look before he left the inn. He would not be gone long; thirty minutes should be enough to soothe his mind. He hated to leave John alone, this was not a safe space. He shoved his hands in his pocket and strolled, he was not so far gone that he missed how gorgeous the day was. This was surely the reason why John had fallen in love with the country. He had half a mind to visit the pastry shop that John had come to frequent. John would appreciate the gesture, he was sure. He was so occupied with his thoughts, that he did not see the man in front of him. He stumbled and grabbed the stranger’s shoulders to steady them both.
“John…”
don't hesitate to check it out!
They had been in the carriage for what felt like an eternity to Sherlock. There was no sign of Baker Street yet so he waited in agony for them reach the building. John, on the other hand, spent his time staring out of the window. There was not much to see besides the occasional house, or a vendor selling a trinket or tonic - anything to earn a meal. He did not speak a word to Sherlock and only did so whenever Sherlock seemed to be sulking or melancholic. The coachman hit a bump, which caused Sherlock to slide over to John, making him intrude in John’s space. The other man only laughed, Sherlock blushed, uttered a brief, “Pardon me,” and returned to his corner of the carriage. He tried not to react to John slowly moving toward him and placing a gloved hand on top of his.
-------
Thomas’ eyes flickered back up to Sherlock’s, his smile returning to his face.
“Freak!”
John had not spoken a word to Sherlock since they left that godforsaken bathhouse, He hadn’t even uttered a syllable to him. Now privy to his true nature, his unnatural birth, he knew he was not a human like he’d thought and now he would never regain that illusion again. How long had he stared at the scars and sutures in the mirror and assumed that everyone else looked the same? He had never seen Sherlock naked, not even partially, how would he know what was normal and what wasn’t? Especially when the man he loved was the most peculiar man in all of London. It was fitting, Sherlock thought, that he was now accompanied by another in the world who was considered an abomination and how fitting it was that Sherlock should love the other odd man in London. All the time he prayed that John would not be branded with the label of an outsider, that he would be able to live a normal life with him. Why did he fool himself into thinking that he didn’t harm all the people around him? That he would not ruin John’s life irreparably and that John would not come away without a smidge of hatred for his creator, for his lover.
“Care to elaborate?”
“Do try not to stare, John. It is impolite."
Sherlock looked away and closed his eyes. It was all a dream, it had to be. He would awaken in the flat with John holding him and snoring so lightly that Sherlock had to strain to hear.  There would be no Moriarty, no danger, just a nightmare.
Part of Sherlock could not help but feel guilty over the fact that John was now forced to work in the very lab in which he was created. The news was still relatively new to him and he knew that, although John forgave him, this information festered within him like a fresh wound. Sherlock had not meant to upset him, but he also had no intention of telling him that he was not human, that he was not created and born as Sherlock was. It was good to know that John did still love him, as he was given no indication otherwise, and there was nothing he needed more than to have John’s love.
He took a bite of the toast. It tasted foreign, as if he had forgotten the sensation of it against his tongue. It didn’t lift his spirits. In fact, it nearly hurt to swallow it. He had to take a long sip of tea in order to wash away the crisp bread that clung uncomfortably to the back of his throat. It was after this first bite that Sherlock realized eating would be just as painful as waking up in the morning. Mrs. Hudson hummed to herself as she flung open the curtain. There it was, the familiar dullness in his chest, in his mind. The grey that symbolized sadness, the rain that resembled the tears that he’d cried. For the first time, he didn’t mind England’s climate as much. A companion in his misery.
Comment and kudos and thank you for reading!
His head whipped back and forth as he searched for any signs of John. He thought he heard his name being returned, but dismissed the phantom call. He ran into the room to the right and found nothing but emptiness. He ran to the room on the left and that’s where he found him. He was tied up to a chair in the middle of the damp room, unconscious and bleeding. In a moment’s notice, Sherlock was in front of John’s chair,  freeing him from his bonds.
“Your waking was unexpected, as I have told you previously. I’ve no idea as to how we would rouse him from his dormant state.”
Sally nodded.
John’s smirk.
Moriarty’s face hardened at Sherlock’s response and immediately his hand flew to John’s wounded shoulder and pressed into the open cut, causing John to hiss. Sherlock’s jaw dropped and instantly he said, “I am the one who reported the murder!”
“...Sherlock.”
John stood up from his spot on the bed and moved to hug Sherlock. “Do not fret my love, we will win, Moriarty holds no candle to us. Then we will take Sebastian and we will leave this land and go elsewhere, Baker Street is where I assume Sebastian would want to reside.”
“What is the matter? Is whiskey not to your liking?”
A teardrop landed on his hand. He was crying, what a pathetic man he was. To be brought to tears because he was beat up. A grown man sobbing as if he were a child.
“I imagine that it is just the two of us against the world now, yes?”
Sherlock brought John’s hand away from his wounded cheek and set it on his lap.
“Good morning, John. Did you sleep well?”
Sherlock’s lips formed the ghost of a smile. John, always so ready and willing, always prepared to travel to the very ends of the Earth with him, even if he did not know where he would be taken.
How did John do it? How could he be so gentle with Sherlock after he was infuriated moments ago? Sherlock closed his eyes briefly. He ached all over and he wanted nothing more than to lie down and forget that it ever happened - believe that he had dreamt it all up; he would wake and find himself alone at the manor again.
“How are you enjoying Switzerland, John? Are you glad that you have joined me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
John smiled and shook his head. “Of course not, Sebastian. You know that wherever I journey Sherlock is not far behind, and neither am I of him. This holiday was his idea; I regret to say that I was more than a bit reluctant to travel here. I suppose I should return to the inn and thank him.”
“It is not about intimacy, I merely wish to have a man that would never think to betray me or deny me. A minion if you will. A custom one.”
Moriarty sneered. “In an asylum they care little for the inmates. You are a lunatic, no matter if you are able to speak coherently, or intelligent enough to not take the medication. I spent years aching to be free of the place, hoping that they would have mercy on a child.”
Sherlock sighed and he ran his hands through his hair.
“Do forgive me, John. As you have so helpfully pointed out, I am beside myself at the moment. Please do not take these words to heart, it shall never be my intention to cause you any hurt, physical or emotional.”
Sherlock’s mouth hung open. Clearly this journal was very personal, considering the fact that Sherlock was not even aware of its existence. Had he always felt this way? Did he truly believe that Sherlock did not love him?
Both men pressed closer to one another. Sherlock leaned forward, bringing his arms up around John’s neck while the other man’s looped around his middle.
John sighed, whenever they come to the subject of John’s creation, or the night of his “birth” the air around them became awkward and tense, and it was situations like this that made John wish that he had been made normally, that he wouldn’t have to make Sherlock or himself so uncomfortable. There was little they could do now for this was the life he was thrust into and the life he would live.
There it was again. He would never understand how John was able to go from furious to tender when he talked to Sherlock. Once again, John was the one to save him from an attack. He was always the hero. Sherlock smiled and nodded.
“He was unable to finish the letter,” John’s voice was soft behind him, laden with fatigue. Sherlock turned to face him, he did not wipe the tear streaks from his face. He almost wanted to tell John to return to sleep, that he would join him in a minute, but in that moment he wanted nothing more than to feel John’s strong arms wrapped around him and to listen to his soothing whisper assuring that everything would be alright. The candle’s flame shone directly upon Sherlock’s face, making the tears on his face more obvious. Sherlock shook his head in defeat.
Lestrade looked as if he was breaking some sort of rule telling Sherlock about anybody who visited the station. Sherlock sat back, Lestrade was definitely thinking of the most peculiar visits to tell Sherlock about.
“Would I?”
Sherlock blinked. John stared at him with concerned eyes, he had drifted off again, forgetting where he was. He rose from his chair and grabbed the plate in the process. John stared as Sherlock walked into the kitchen and begun the task of washing the dishes. While they dined on one plate, Sherlock had forgotten to wash the plates and cups from the previous night. He groaned at the sight of the full sink but it had to be done and Sherlock had to be the one to do it.
John looked Sebastian up and down. He was going mad, surely he was. This was the guilt that he sought to repress, he should have known his mind would betray him and force him to see visions of Sebastian. He must return to the inn, he must see Sherlock and hug him and kiss him and remind himself that he was real and that Sebastian was gone from them forever. Moriarty had him and what were the chances of him whisking Sebastian and his crew to Switzerland as well?
Sherlock ignored her praise. He was mulling over his plan in his head. He had the notes, he was going to get the materials that night. But where would he piece it together? Suddenly it came to him. Mycroft rented a private flat on Baker Street for whenever he felt need to get away from Sherlock’s antics or his job. Sherlock was the only other person who had a key. It was fit with an attic big enough for Sherlock to work in. He would have to leave the manor since there would be no room to hide the limbs if he should return. The maids cleaned every crevice of the house; if they didn’t find the parts first, they would surely smell them. How long would he be away? Days, weeks, months, years? It didn’t matter, time was of little consequence. What choice was there? Snapping out of his thoughts, he slammed his hands on the desk and turned toward Mrs. Hudson.
“When we heard word of Powers’ death, I was certain that it was more than a mere death. I informed Mycroft of my conclusion, and though it took time for him to see reason, we traveled to Scotland Yard and swayed their minds.”
Aroused by the commanding tone that John put on, Sherlock raised the paper quickly. He stared at John in anticipation and a sigh, louder than he would have liked, left him when John’s lips met his own. Sherlock nearly dropped the newspaper at how needy John’s kissed seemed. He too craved affection and Sherlock wanted nothing more than to supply him with an ample amount once they were at their lodgings. Even in Switzerland they were not free to love as they wanted, but tonight Sherlock would allow himself to relax in John’s company, to get a room together, if they could. He wanted to love John in a way that he could not have since Sebastian’s departure.
John rolled his eyes and said, “Do not listen to him, Sebastian. What he means to say is that she will get on with you splendidly.”
John gave a wry smirk. If only Sherlock knew.
“You always told me that there would be no meaning to life if there was no death. Remember those stories you used to read to me at night? Tales full of death and rebirth. How unfair, how positively unfair. You died with no hope of rebirth, does that not anger you as much as it does me?”
“I have only returned because I am weary, I did not do as you said.”
The group shared a laugh.
“Sebastian?” John was the one to ask, carefully putting his hand to the creature’s chest. Sherlock was not sure if it was John’s utterance of the name or if he truly did like the sound of it, but the creature’s mouth formed something akin to a smile, and then he nodded. This caused John to form a smile of his own and look to Sherlock, hoping that he was somehow enjoying this. Sherlock closed the book and looked at their creation with a smirk on his face.
No response either. He flipped through more pages.
“You’ll forgive me then for being concerned about your coughing fit, and there is also the fact that your sick was bile and nothing more.”
John blinked and turned to look up at Sherlock. It took a while for Sherlock to say anything to him.
“Nothing has captured your eye since we have been together, so you might understand why I am so curious. You do not partake in smoking or drinking, not very English of you I might add. I ask myself, what is that has my dear Sebastian so occupied that he does not even stay at home? Then, I’ve come to a conclusion. Two conclusions.”
“And how did they find themselves in such a predicament?”
The loud utterance of the name startled John; he rose to meet Sherlock’s frightened and frustrated eyes. Sherlock ran over to him and moved him away from the fire.
“I would.”
“This wrinkles appear whenever you labour under your thoughts.”
Moriarty let out another laugh and clapped both hands on John’s shoulders.
“John, I would love nothing more than to gaze into the fire with you by my side.”
John loved him, and Mrs. Hudson loved him. Mycroft would never allow her to remain if he knew she no longer felt love toward him. He cared for his little brother immensely, he would want him to be surrounded by people who felt the same. So then why? Why did Sherlock feel as if something has been severed in their connection? Irreparably.
With that he left the building. He heard Sally and Anderson bickering still. They were still here? Why did had they not yet left? Sherlock sighed, they would give him a hard time but he had to question them on Moriarty’s whereabouts. He walked over to them and was not surprised to see the two stiffen. He raised his hands to show that he meant no harm.
“Freak? Is that it? We done here?”
“I believe I have already found it then.” It was Sherlock’s turn to smile as Moriarty’s eyes darkened. He inhaled deeply and did his best to keep his composure. “Do you know what draws me to this place, Sherlock? Why I have chosen this to be our rendezvous?”
John did not know what true fear was and he had nothing to be scared of while Sherlock was around. That was, as long as Sherlock did not do anything foolish. He could not help but think about John’s face the moment their hands touched. The way his eyes traveled to their hands, that moment when he pushed his fingers in between the spaces of Sherlock’s own. That small but warm smile that he wore. To Sherlock, John looked the picture of happiness in that brief moment. He sighed; he did not want to ruin John in the same way that he ruined his brother.
The smile vanished and Sherlock knew he had angered her. She pushed past him into the room and set the tray down on his desk with a bit of force, the cutlery jangling against the silver. She never did yell at Sherlock but she was firm with him. If she wanted him to bathe, he bathed, if she wanted him to eat, he ate. Mrs. Hudson huffed and walked out of the room.
“Where would we go?”
“You remember what happened to that young boy, Powers, all those years ago?”
The surprise still kept had him frozen but more so, pure emotion was rising to the fore. It tightened his throat, made his chest constrict, and Sherlock felt his eyes sting with tears. John might find it completely pathetic of him to cry over such sweet words but Sherlock was so...So elated, so thankful, so disbelieving that anyone could see him and think those things. His lips moved to speak but no words left them. What could he even say in response to that?
(See the end of the chapter for
“And what shall we do regarding the state of your…” He gestured towards Sherlock’s face. Sherlock frowned, he would have to hide it, would he not? There was no way to avoid it though. He would have to brave the public remarks and all.
“There’s more, I take it?” Sherlock inquired sarcastically.
“Sherlock,” John swallowed hard and he sniffed harshly, “I would prefer to not engage in such disruptive activity in a public area. I would like for you to respect my wishes.”
John’s smile softened, and the tension he felt was enough so that he too Sebastian’s quivering hand. “Come now, Sebastian…”
John nodded.
Sherlock and John moved towards the door while Moriarty waved and said, “Good evening, gentlemen.”
“I’ve nearly finished.”
“What is the meal tonight?”
“And how does this distress you?”
“You are feeling quite the brave man this morning, aren’t you?”
“I don’t believe I know you.”
“John, are you able to move?”
“We have more than enough time.”
“You live!”
Sherlock rose and moved to his wardrobe to retrieve an old robe he had no use for. Then held his hand out for John. John smiled at him and graciously accepted his invitation and they both headed downstairs. They found their creation staring at them with fascination and fear. Sherlock walked over to him with the robe in hand, but of course, the man did not even make to reach out. After several attempts at trying to wrap him in some sort of clothing, Sherlock realized that there was no way for him to overcome the barrier. He turned to look at John and said, “Do you mind?”
“I thought you were repulsed by my homosexuality. Why would you desire a male companion?”
He kissed John again in hopes a smile would form on that sullen face that did not suit John one bit.
“Mhm.”
“I say, what is Sir Thomas doing talking to that queer fellow over there?”
“Sebastian? What brings you here again?”
Sherlock’s eyes widened at the revelation Moriarty threw at him. Mycroft had stopped him? Of course Mycroft would never tell Sherlock what might upset him. He used his pull with the British government to do it, of that Sherlock had no doubt.
John nodded.
Sherlock huffed and placed a hand on his hip. Must John be so difficult today? It only took a moment to cook the food, Sherlock had not required John’s assistance in the past, and he would not require it now. John only smiled and kissed him again.
Sherlock was crying now, and with each tear that fell, he despised himself even more. He resolved to light a candle, he would rather not cry alone in the dark. With a sniffle, he lit the candle, only to find a man staring directly at him. Sherlock let out a shout and fell off his bed. He heard the man’s footsteps approaching. Oh what a way to die! He would be murdered by a common thug in his bedroom. What would the thief say to his cohorts, “I killed a man while he sobbed in his bed!”
His companion looked lost. Sherlock rested a hand on his shoulder and leaned forward. Both of their faces were reflected in the water.
“We must be off, Sherlock.”
“Is this it? Shall that be your name?”
“The pyramids are lovely creations.”
“Today it shall only be you and I, Detective Inspector. Mr. Watson is asleep at our flat.”
“I’ve brought you breakfast.”
“Enjoying yourself?”
Sherlock spent the night at his writing table, scribbling away on the paper that he procured from Mrs. Hudson, who used it to write to her sister. An hour of drawing, writing, and sketching passed before he scowled at his work and swept it all to the floor. He yanked at his curls out of frustration. This had to be accomplished. It had to.
They took off running. With the both of them being superhuman, they were much faster than Sherlock could ever be, as well as having a considerable amount of stamina so they would not tire as fast. As the falls came closer, John picked up even more speed and forgot about Sebastian. He needed to get to Sherlock, he needed him to be okay.
“Will you kiss me?” Sherlock asked with the tone of a child. John only smiled and said, “You only need to ask,” before pressing their lips together again.
“We don’t take too kindly to freaks, right Sally?”
“We therefore commit his body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust; in the sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to eternal life.”
Sherlock shook his head. “Supper is ready.”
John had only a moment to settle in when Sherlock moved back into his arms. Sherlock let out a sigh when he felt John’s strong arms wrap around his waist. His sides were sore from all of the coughing and he hoped that John did not feel the way he winced when John squeezed a bit too hard.
“I am honored to have made you, John Watson. The Vitruvian Man deals only in physical properties, but you, my dear John, you have the heart and soul of the perfect man. I am terribly sorry for doing what I have done to you, but I only meant to protect you. I did not know how you would react had I told you way back when.”
“Right! He is not with you today?”
“Fire burns, John. Burning is not good.”
“Do listen, I need you to fetch a coach for me. I’m to be running an errand for sometime and I expect the man to be outside upon my arrival, do you think you can do this for me?”
“Good day, Mr. Banville.”
“What in God’s name?”
“You have returned with sweets?”
“I...I believe that he feels a sort of kinship with me, Sherlock.”
“How did you know to save me?”
“Sebastian, if you would only tell me what is troubling you. You are not well, please, tell me what is wrong.”
Sherlock struggled to keep his composure. His body shook with anger and sadness as he remembered those awful days spent listening to Mycroft’s gasps for breath and rough coughing. He looked nothing like himself when Sherlock saw his body before the funeral. He was thin and pale, and so unlike the man he knew before.
He slid on his slippers, tied his robe tightly about his thin waist, and descended the stairs. Upon his arrival, one of the maids nearly dropped the newly-folded laundry at the sight of him, her mouth hung open as she stayed rooted to the spot. Sherlock met her gaze, his sullen countenance from watching his brother’s coffin lower into the ground unmoved by her shock. He shoved his hands into his pockets and walked towards the kitchen. Mrs. Hudson came out of the room, wiping her hands on her apron. She had been cooking a meal for him already. Sherlock felt a twinge of his heart, she was going to force him to eat with a mother’s stubbornness no doubt. She returned from her sister’s home the previous day, the maids informing her of their master’s situation. There was a reason Mycroft kept her around after so many years.
“They simply mistook me for another person. They were positively besotted, John, I doubt they knew who they were assaulting.”
The woman, now identified as Sally, smirked and nodded.
“Sherlock I’ve brought you the…”
“I am unsure; he shows no signs of waking.”
‘You are not well, this is a figment of your imagination and nothing else.’
Sherlock let out a sigh and nuzzled against John’s face. “You are so much more than I could have ever expected, John. I want you to know this for forever and a day.”
“I do not, John, I am only experimenting with my knowledge of medicine and anatomy. Hopefully, we shall be able to start his heart.”
“Sherlock Holmes, a homosexual! How would that sound to a judge, or even a lowly cop? They would sentence you to hard labor, if the death penalty does not reach their minds first.”
With that, he rose from his chair and moved through the flat and up the stairs faster than John could keep up. John set the dish down and rushed up the stairs behind Sherlock, who was already busy at work, sketching the body of the creature they would be creating and muttering to himself. For a moment, John only watched, he was sure that Sherlock was not even aware of his presence, he hardly ever was when he was in this state. John waited in the doorway to see if Sherlock would even turn his head in his direction, to see if maybe he would order him to fetch his tea downstairs, or even to come and review the notes they both spent sleepless nights on. No recognition came, Sherlock sat hunched over, scribbling away on the paper resting on the cot that would house the next man, the new John.
John could only make a noise of agreement, leaning forward to rest his forehead over Sherlock’s shoulder as he slid in and out of that luxurious heat. His knees were beginning to slip on the sheets so he pulled up closer, making Sherlock bend inwards more.
“We have not been gone from it long, yet you declare that statement as if we have not been back in years.”
“Your kisses will not sway my mind, Sherlock. You and I agreed upon slumbering together. Therefore, if I should retire, so should you, and the same of me with you.”
“We were introduced to one another at Lord Henry’s grand ball some years ago. Intelligent man, he was. Spent the whole night in his company.”
“It cannot be…” Sherlock muttered. The man spun around at the sound of Sherlock’s voice. Sherlock could not make out the details of his face, but he was sure that it wasn’t his creation. His creation had never moved, never taken a breath, he did not work and Sherlock dragged him out of the house because he could not bear to look his failure in the eyes. This was nothing more than a burglar, Sherlock continued to tell himself.
Sherlock rose from his seat and bent down in front of John. He rested a hesitant hand on John’s cheek and stroked it gently with his thumb. Once he saw John’s hand leave from under his chin, he leant forward and allowed John the choice of kissing him or not. He tried not to grin as he felt the coarse skin of John’s lips meet his own. Sherlock moved his hands up to cup John’s face and moaned once he felt John’s fingers run  over his sensitive scalp and clutch the silky locks. He pulled John’s body in so that the kiss might deepen; he’d always wanted more from John, wanted to have him wholly, and now he would give in to all of his carnal desires if John wished it. It was unholy to love someone as much as he loved John.
“I am grateful for your assistance, John. You have done well.”
John and Sebastian came running behind Thomas and saw the two men peeking out from the water.
His brother would have been disappointed in Sherlock if he could have witnessed what happened in the living area. He had wanted to hold John’s hand, no, he had
The longer he worked his finger in and out, the more Sherlock seemed to open up around him. Soon John was collecting more Vaseline to work a second finger in and this time Sherlock accepted the intrusion without objection.
John pulled away and wiped the tears from his face. “Do not fret, Sebastian, that was the last time you will ever be away from us.”
Sebastian nodded. “I am sure of it, we must be quick.”
He would not give him the satisfaction.
He nodded and motioned for John to follow him out of the room. He had not seen Mycroft in ages, what would he possibly say?
John knelt on the floor and held the waistcoat up. He laughed and nodded.
It was then that John took Sherlock’s hand to gently remind him that they needed to depart.
“John, it is fine, have your seat while I prepare breakfast.”
Sherlock did not respond. His eyes were closed so John assumed that he had fallen asleep. He removed his hand and stood up to clean the mess on the floor. It was then he heard Sherlock’s pitiful voice whine, “Stay, please.”
“No.”
“Sebastian! What has you so upset?”
The last strike silenced his cries.
“Where are we off to?”
“The Vitruvian Man is the model of the ideal human. His proportions are exquisite, his body is truly what mankind desires to have,” He recited its description, long fingers tracing the circles drawn around the body. His head tilted slightly as he stared at the drawing. His mouth twisting into a bitter smirk.
“I am bound as well, Sherlock.”
It had to have been John. He did seem to be on edge when Thomas approached the two. Seeing as how this happened the day before, John would have every reason to be cautious of any stranger that Sherlock came across. When did Sherlock ever gain the friendship of another man? No, more than friendship, no man touches their friend the way John touched Sherlock. He shook his head, surely he had only imagined it. Sherlock did not care for men, Sherlock was not a...he was not a homosexual. Oh, how disappointed Mycroft would be.
“It is rubbish, John, and I am shocked that you would even defend this.”
Moriarty’s henchmen cut John and Sherlock from their bindings and moved so that the two hostages would be able to nurse their tender skin. Moriarty holstered the gun and clapped a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and said, “I shall give you two and a half months to create my man. I will personally stop off at your flat to ensure that progress is being made and at the end, that he is finished.”
Moriarty paused and looked down at John’s shoulder. His dark brows furrowed and he squeezed the shoulder once more. Sherlock winced at the sight of John trying to hold in the pain caused by Moriarty’s agitation of the wound.
He looked like he wanted to speak, but Sherlock knew that he would not be able to. He had no grasp of language so Sherlock would not be surprised if he wasn’t understood. Sherlock set the vase down on the nightstand and inched his way over to the frightened male.
“Fear not, I’ve been reading your medical books and I am confident that I will put my learnings to good use.”
John himself seemed unsure of where to proceed. It was as if the man had not flung Sherlock across the room moments ago. The man detached his hand and moved back from them. Sherlock moved from behind his protector and stepped towards him.
Sally’s eyes widened. “You mean like that man you worked with?”
John nodded, “You always look so dreadfully tired, and I’ve realized that I am the cause.”
Sherlock’s chest went a bit tight at the possibility. The answer was no. No, he wasn’t ready. And even so, because of his curiosity, he had asked. His shoulders went stiff at what was to come. Inevitably John would see Sherlock’s question as permission and if Sherlock denied him, he would be nothing but terrible for tempting.
“Alright, I am aware that you are unable to speak my language, but you deserve a name, nonetheless.”
John moved out of the way and let him walk in. “You may take your seat on Sherlock’s bed.” Sebastian slumped down onto the bed and fiddled with his thumbs. John was no idiot like him, he knew when something was wrong.
“Tell me boy, how have you come to meet John? You have always been alone, how is it that you’ve suddenly found yourself a friend? You were never the social sort, and I doubt Mycroft’s death would alter that.”
They made it to the Holmes’ Manor quickly, Sherlock had not let the driver’s efficiency go unrewarded, providing a generous tip in gratitude. Mrs. Hudson was already standing outside of the grand doors, desperately awaiting Sherlock’s presence, the mere sight of his face. He prepared himself for the hugs and the kisses that she was no doubt ready to thrust upon him. To his surprise (and dismay) she pressed kisses to his cheeks and put on the warmest and widest smile of which she could muster.
Sherlock nodded as he halted his tears. He could not speak for his voice was too choked up. If a word so much as left his mouth, he would be a sobbing mess and John would hate it and leave. He could not risk John’s disapproval. His friend rushed over to his side and forced the other to stare into his eyes. The urge to cry was even harder then.
Sherlock leaned forward, fascinated that this new man was quite the quick learner, indeed.
“It is….it is complicated, John…”
John folded his hands and sniffed, the first sound that either of them had made during the entirety of their trip. Sherlock’s eyes travelled to the rags that John’s shirt had become. Ripped in nearly every spot, white stained with red, and then there was the black of that thread that held his body together. Uneven stitching, heavy on the top and then light on the bottom. He had done his best, Mrs. Hudson had always done the sewing for the brothers because she didn’t think it proper for men of their standing to mend their own wardrobe. Pity too, who knew that he would later need that skill to accomplish what he had.
“Very interesting.” John dropped the conversation and after a few minutes, asked, “Might I read it with you?”
He shook his head and clicked his tongue at them.
Sherlock pointed to the photograph of the boat and smiled.
He grinned, proud of his work. However, his pride was short-lived.
The man just stared at John and Sherlock sighed, “He has no comprehension of language. You were very much the same on the night of your awakening.”
John’s tongue slid across the seam of Sherlock’s lips, startling him into parting them and allowing John’s to slip inside. It was a strange sensation, their tongues mingling, but heat spiralled through Sherlock’s body to the tip of every extremity. It made him wind his arms tighter around John, his body yearning to be closer so he could feel the man against him.
“Now John, what do these images depict?”
Sherlock smiled and motioned for John to take a seat, but he did not budge.
“Oh, very well Sherlock!” Sebastian was beaming now at the mention of freedom with the two people he loved most, trusting Sherlock so completely that he did not give a moment’s thought to doubts. “Where will we go?”
Sherlock did not forget the conversation they had prior to naming Sebastian, and the revelations that had come to him. John had felt lonely, no doubt because he was the only one of his kind. That was Sherlock’s fault, he had not considered this when he was creating him. He knew what it felt like to be alone but to force John to overcome such an emotion too was a true error. He kissed John on the shoulder and felt one being returned upon his head. Just as he closed his eyes, they heard the door being opened to reveal none other than Sebastian. They both sat up and watched as the man spread his blanket on the floor, placed his pillow on top, and lay down. He stared at the both of them with those alarming blue eyes and, without uttering a word, closed his eyes and went to sleep. John and Sherlock flashed puzzled looks at one another and slowly sank back into the bed. They assumed their positions again and Sherlock whispered, “I do hope this does not become a habit.”
At that her scowl disappeared and reverted to a harmless frown. “Damned git got himself locked up again.”
“Children do not murder.”
Kissing John was one of Sherlock’s favourite things to do but this felt different. This was not a quick trade of ‘I love yous’ through a passing press of lips. This was raw emotion, translated through warmth, through touch, through the need for more. Up until this point, Sherlock had been terrified to seek more with John but that trust he had needed, seemed finally fulfilled. John would take care of him, would be aware of him, and would not let him fall.
“If I must be honest, no. What if she does not like me?”
“Sherlock, would you mind if I joined you?”
John nodded. At least he believed him.
She twiddled her thumbs together, unsure of how to answer this. Sherlock did not need her answer to understand the context behind the inquiry. She was there the night Mycroft struck him, she knew about the boy from the cafe, the way Sherlock fell for his smile. She knew….she knew...she knew…
As those words rang in his head, all he could do was think about what he had just done.
Sherlock hummed this time and slurred, “Fine.”
“Sherlock, I am dreadfully tired, as are you, and no, I am not going to retire until after we eat.”
Sherlock paused to hide his grin at John calling Sherlock that term of endearment. It was not the first time he had used it, but it was just a feeling Sherlock could not get used to.
Sherlock kissed him shortly after their talk, and darted up the stairs to begin packing. Of course they were unable to leave that day, there were preparations to be made, inns to be located. Sherlock expected everything to fall into place when they arrived and John had no intention of stopping him. They spent that night as normal, laid up in bed, limbs tangled and as close together as humanly possible. John had taken to sleeping shirtless, the air had become a bit thicker since summer was approaching, Sherlock did not mind it.
Moriarty shook his head and wagged his finger.
“What do you intend do with that?”
John’s eyes darted around the room, as if the answer would be written on one of the items in the flat. Sherlock rested his hand underneath his chin. He would be amused to hear this answer, no doubt. John’s eyes shot back to his.
