“Forget about Nat, what about Thor?” Tony questioned. Last week, when Thor woke up to no coffee, he smashed the kettle on the ground. Correction, he smashed $6000 on the ground.
SHIELD had a mission for them. Something about Chituari weaponry being stolen from a SHIELD transport and said thieves unleashing it on a town. Nothing the Avengers couldn’t handle, especially since the thieves didn’t know how to use the alien weaponry well. Steve led and gave orders that everyone followed and carried out, even Tony. The scuffle ended swiftly, the thieves were apprehended and the Avengers were congratulated on their hard work.
Tony caught Steve leaving the training room, his favorite place in the tower. He had brought up planning for Steve’s birthday party before with his fellow Avenger, but Steve wasn’t giving him much to go off of.
By the time he came out of the simulator, the sun began to set. He was impressed by the amount of detail and creativity Tony installed in the simulator. Enemy weapons, holographic copies of criminals, hostage simulators, there were even robot dummies to fight. Steve tried one of every type, but hadn’t exhausted all the possibilities or difficulty level.
“I don’t think they mind me dating America’s most handsomest man,” Steve shot back. In his eyes, was the same flirtatious sparkle he had from last night that sent Tony into a frenzy. Honestly, if the possibility of one of the Avengers walking in on them at any second wasn't an issue, he would have bend Steve over that table right then and there.
For a moment, Steve’s mind disconnected from reality and realized the absurdity of this assignment. He never imagined himself contriving ideas to get a woman out of a murder charge in a college classroom. To add more to the absurdity, this woman’s life literally depends on them. Steve doesn’t understand how everyone else is only viewing it as a homework assignment and not the fact a woman’s livelihood is hanging in the balance.
“Good job waitlist,” Steve heard someone says to his right. It was Tony. “You managed to impress everyone in class today.”
From the apartment next to his, a man walked out. He carried a garbage bag as he closed the door behind him. Steve squinted his eyes. That man looked familiar. The glasses, the messy black hair, purple shirt, he couldn’t quite place it. The man turned around from his door and stopped as he saw Steve. His mouth opened, but no words came out.
Anger flared up inside him then came the shame and embarrassment. He wasn’t sure who he was mad at, Clint for asking such an asinine question or himself for drawing attention to his and Steve’s friendship. Even if he did like Steve in that way, it wouldn’t matter since Steve is definitely straight.
Tony mumbled back his own “good morning”. His eyes followed Steve as Steve prepared to make himself breakfast. The tight shirt really does nothing to cover Steve’s muscle, Tony noted, not that he minds. Steve sat next to Tony.
He pushed door and peered into the room. He saw Steve sitting at the edge of his bed, his face burrowed in his hands. Steve slowly lifted his head.
Hey guys, thanks for reading this fanfic. I've actually had this idea in my head for a couple of years now and I'm glad I am finally able to post it now. When it comes to scheduling, I'm hoping to post at least twice a month, possibly on a weekend. Anyways, thanks for reading!
“Papa made me wear my fancy clothes!” He blurted out, and once Tony opened the damn the words kept spilling out. Peter dragged his father to sit next to Steve on the pew, climbing between the two of them and babbling about his latest game, the new moves Sam taught him, the things he was learning about in school. Tony didn’t yell, didn’t complain, didn’t look anything but the picture parent. He listened, he nodded, and he oh’d and ah’d in all the right places.
“Best damn peewee goalie in New York,” Sam boasted to the parents sitting around them. Steve smiled up at him. This was what he loved about Sam. Tony had never been this parental.
His eyes opened as wide as they could and he could feel his heart pounding in his ears, in his fingers, in his toes. “Fu-Fuck!” He laughed, then finished the line and stood up. Everything was so much brighter, and he could finally move as fast as his thoughts. He went back to his board, furiously reviewing his project. How could he have been so stupid, of course! The answer was right here….
“--and we have the right to have you drug tested at any time we see fit. And now seems like a good time,” She gave him a wicked smile, “unless of course, you would rather we search your person and apartment instead?”
Tony sat down on the bed, watching him for now. He could start the search for his clothes later. Or maybe just take something from Fandral. If this was going to be a regular hook-up it hardly mattered. “Well something to keep me busy all day would be nice~”
“So… this is pretty personal?” Tony rolled his eyes, “Got it. You have a vendetta.” He flipped the pen in his hand around, putting all this information together. So Fandral was probably a member of this group, and right now he was working down at ‘Finest’ with this Thor guy--
The air was heavy and tense for a long moment. Tony could hear his heartbeat in his ears and feel the blood pulsing in his fingertips. But The Captain didn’t turn on him. He didn’t lunge forward and pull his fist back to attack him. No, he just turned, his expression complete stone.
“We need you tested,” She declared after a moment of his stunned silence. Oh fuck her, she was even smirking!
“The fuck is this supposed to be,” He hissed, but his stomach was in big knots and he felt like he was going to ralph.
“Hey, come on, stop screaming!” The Captain removed his hands but didn’t step away. It was only then that Tony even realized that too-loud sound was because he was yelling. He curled into his pillows and looked at The Captain with wide eyes, his breathing still erratic. “Okay, good,” the larger man soothed, “just try and focus on your breathing, okay? You’re gonna make yourself pass out like that.”
Tony rubbed his eyes again. He couldn’t bring himself to take a five minute nap so he opted to grab himself a cup of coffee.
Tony zoned her out. He pulled out his phone from his pocket and hid it underneath the table. He scrolled through his notifications. There was a couple of texts from Bruce, probably articles about the latest scientific discoveries, one from Nat, and the rest from the various games on his phone. He swiped right on Bruce’s text, clicked on the article and indulged himself on it.
Steve tapped on his past text conversation with Bucky. It's been four days since Bucky has responded to his texts. He knew Bucky has a new internship that keeps him busy. He sent Bucky another message.
Fury looked at his assistants. They whispered to each other then Fury looked back at Tony. “You can take a seat, Mr. Stark. Congratulations, you’ve moved onto the next round. Alright, who’s next?”
“For all of you to be in my class, you all must not have any morals,” the professor began as he made his way to the front of the class. He turned around once he reached the desk and set the briefcase on the desk. He smiled. “Good, because that’s exactly what you need to in order to be a good defense lawyer. I’m Professor Nicholas Fury, but everyone calls me Fury. This is criminal law 101 or what I like to call,” Professor Fury started to write on the whiteboard. He set the marker down and turn around. “How to get away with murder.”
Steve didn’t expect to find the classroom this packed. He knew the class was nearly full when he signed up, but this was crazy. He managed to squeeze through some of his fellow classmates and get to the front row. Fortunately for Steve, there was an open seat near the center. Steve plotted himself down on the seat. He flashed a smile to the red haired woman sitting next to him.
“Steve you are literally the living embodiment of everything that is supposed to be great about America.” Tony motioned Steve to follow him.
He flick open the tube of lube and squeezed about quarter sized on his fingers. Steve spread his legs further for Tony. Tony carefully worked his finger inside Steve, slow and deep strokes for the soldier to get used to. He inserted another finger, causing Steve to whimper. He placed his free hand on Steve’s stomach, caressing his stomach with his thumb to relax Steve. He felt Steve’s relax and he kept working his fingers in and out and cooed words of encouragement to remind Steve everything will be fine.
The smiles on his classmates’ faces didn’t make it better. “Not an enviable position as no two argument can be the same. You have all night to to come up with an argument. Feel free to use Tate’s discovery file, my library, hell, if the internet will help you, use it. You can also ask my associates, the people who I trust with my life, any questions about the case.”
Steve pulled him in again. They kissed, some long, some quick pecks. All the build up sexual tension inside of them boiled over to the point it couldn’t contain itself much longer. It fueled the passion of their kisses. The long kisses were hard and demanding, desperate to hold the bond between the two as if it would be the worst thing in the world if they part. Their quick pecks were soft, lips barely touching.
Tony handed Steve a freshly poured cup of coffee. He thanked Tony and sat next to Clint. The confusion on Clint’s face intensified. “So, Clint, are you going to be making those pancakes now or…” Tony asked.
Steve nodded. He poured some milk and sugar and as Steve mixed his coffee, Tony noticed that his back was slowly relaxing itself. Steve turned around to lean against the corner of the L-shaped island counter. Both Tony and Clint watched Steve drink his coffee.  It was like watching a puppy encounter a new food its owner dropped on the floor for them. Steve’s eyes widen slightly as he drank then coughed while setting the cup down.
“Small, modest, I think I can manage that,” Tony assured him. Although he wasn’t sure if he could. All of his parties are huge and wild., filled with so much drinking and people dancing like its the 1920s. He kept a mental note of Steve’s request and started to walk out of the kitchen. “Bruce, he’s the most modest I know, he can help...”
Tony frowned. He couldn’t spot anyone he knew in this class, except the tall dark haired boy two tables away from him.
“Somethin’ like that,” Clint mumbled. Tony watched as the agent chugged down the coffee. Clint rubbed his eyes furiously. “More please.”
Tony laughed despite the absurdity of all the events that they’ve faced. “Me neither. Terrorists I can handle, but a giant alien army led by a angsty god is not what I imagined to ever happen to me.”
“Of course not, you know how famous I am?” Tony exclaimed. “I would not last two seconds without tourists and paparazzis blocking me.”
Immediately, everyone, except Steve, pulled out their laptops and/or notebooks. Steve furrowed his eyebrows. He pulled out his own notebook in response, but compared to his other classmates, his notebook was blank. He glanced over at the students in front of him and saw an article headlined “Intern Poisoned Boss” and two pictures, one of the woman on the screen and one of a man in a red suit with his arm crossed.
He arrived in the living room. It looked normal, the only difference was Clint sleeping on the couch. He walked further into the living room, nearing the kitchen. As if he stepped on a pressure plate, a banner unfurled above him. The words “Happy Birthday America” printed on the banner in giant bolded red, white and blue lettering. Steve looked at the banner impressed.
Tony stood up and Steve readied his pencil. Tony smirked. “My defense is…we offered the jury another suspect. Tivan’s youngest brother, Carlo. As I was doing research on Tivan and his family, I noticed that out of all his brother, Carlo didn’t receive any inheritance or any stakes in their father’s company. Instead, Carlo is forced to work under his old brother, our unfortunate victim. And what better way to get back at the brother who got everything than kill him and pin it on his mistress?”
Giddiness swelled in Steve’s stomach. Steve smiled once they finally pulled apart. He was out of breath, so was Tony. Tony’s thumb dragged across Steve’s cheek, sending shivers down his spine.
Tony reached for lube and condom while Steve kept the same exhilarating pace with his hand. He set the items aside, now putting all his focus on the man below him. After all the rubbing, he was painfully hard and he knows Steve is too. He peeled off his shirt, Steve did the same with his. He muttered a curse seeing Steve’s heavily toned muscles. For a moment, he stopped straddling Steve and Steve whimpered at the lost of touch. Steve was making it really hard for Tony to control himself. Their pants were now on the floor and their underwear joined them two seconds later.
Over a hour later, the celebratory barbecue started. Clint fixed everyone burgers while Tony handled the music. Everyone was having fun and chatted with one another. Tony moved around the balcony, asserting himself in whatever conversation he could. He currently found himself in one with Thor and Steve.
After Bruce went, a couple more students had gone. Nearly 70% of the class sat on either the stairs or the back walkway of the class, the unfortunate ones. Steve prepared himself to be ready to sit on the side and be ruled out of the competition.
“Something tells me she is lying,” whispered the tall blonde next to him. The tall blonde grinned at Steve who glared in response to the tasteless comment.
Tony flinched at the question. It was such an unexpected yet dreaded question asked. “What?” He scoffed. He fumbled to find a politician answer. “God no, please, we're…just friends, I think.”
The rest of the presentations went in a blur for Steve, only perking up whenever a student’s defense matches his so he could cross it out. As more students went, the more Steve’s defense list grew smaller and smaller. There were some highlights Steve’s paid attention to.
“Yeah, I usually drive around. I go to Brooklyn, look around the area, see whats left of…the old stuff, you know? But it’s hard,” Steve explained. “My old home was demolished, no one I know is still alive, except for Peggy, but I can’t go see her. She has a family and- I can’t do that to her.”
Steve blinked. He cleared his throat, his cheeks turning red. “I think I’m going to retire early to my bedroom.”
Thor loudly shushed everyone, getting a brunch of funny looks from his teammates. “The movie is playing, it is rude to talk during a performance, you know?”
"If they can't see your eyes, they can't know who you are," Tony simply replied. He pointed to the motorcycle. "We're taking that?"
their relationship would progress a little. Despite living in the same building, Steve and Tony rarely see each other. Tony can count the few times they were in the same room in Avengers Time on one hand. Usually, they cross paths in kitchen in the morning or in the living room sometime at night. Tony knows Steve leaves as soon as he wakes up. He has no idea how a man, 67 years away from the NYC he once knew, manage to spend the whole day out. But what does he care? They're just work buddies. So long as they work well together on missions then it shouldn't matter what happens off the field.
“Sorry, can’t hear you, walking away,” he shouted as he walked away from the group and towards Clint. Tony fixed himself another burger as Clint finished the last batch of burgers. Through chews, Tony complimented Clint, “Good turkey burger.”
They sat behind everyone else. They waited eagerly for the fireworks to start. Tony told Steve fun facts about fireworks and the Macy’s company. The sound of exploding fireworks stole their attention. They sat in silence as the fireworks displayed went on. Red, blue, white, purple and green exploded across the pitch black sky of New York. Steve watched the fireworks display in awe. He had never seen such bursts of colors before and he was experiencing this event with Tony, the Tony he has a crush on.
“I have Asgardian money not human money. Besides, Stark said he does not trust me with human money.”
When Steve reached his seat, Bruce didn’t pay him no mind. Steve figured it wasn’t the best time to bother his next door neighbor and decided to review his notes as well. He drew a star on some of his best defenses and mentally prepared himself what to say for each defense.
“Sorry for doubting you.” He finished his burger in a few more bites then threw his paper plate in the garbage. A familiar laugh cut through the air and Tony already knew he belonged to. Seeing Steve enjoying the party made Tony happy and he wore it on his face.
He found himself on the balcony, his second favorite spot. He pulled the chair closer to the glass railings of the balcony. Something about observing the city below brought peace to his mind. Though, his conversation with Natasha didn’t leave his mind. Is his and Tony’s friendship viewed differently in other people’s minds? Steve acknowledged that they have been spending more time together, but he viewed it as a necessary teammate bonding. If the Avengers weren’t on friendly terms with one another, how could they safely protect the world if their petty differences interfered?
Tony dressed as civilian as he could. He wore shades, a hoodie and a pair of run down jeans he used to wear during his college party years that still surprisingly fits. He met Steve in the garage. Steve’s civilian clothes is similar to what he always wear, the same brown leather jacket, a t-shirt -which Tony honestly think is too tight for him, and pants. The only new thing is the baseball cap.
Tony grinned. He kissed him again, the same hard passionate kiss that stole Steve’s breath away. Steve’s hands pushed Tony’s head towards him to deepen the kiss, but yanked him down with him. Tony was on top of Steve now. He positioned himself so he’s straddling Steve, a mischievous glare in his eyes. Steve’s hand darted to Tony’s belt, fingers fumbling to undo the belt as Steve started to grind against Tony.
“I am,” Clint said proudly. He took a seat by the the kitchen island. “I am the master on the grill.”
“Oh god no. Pepper can do that,” Tony answered as he flashed a cocky grin. He glanced over to Steve, who flashed him a smile as well.
They’re work buddies, they know that. Steve knows it. Tony definitely knows it. They’re work buddies, not friends. Tony doesn’t even believe they’ve crossed the friendship line in the six weeks they’ve been working together. They acknowledge their mutual respect for one another, but that’s as far as their relationship goes. Tony thought that when the Avengers moved in the newly rebuilt Avengers Tower, that
The boy smiled at him. Tony felt pressure in his chest. The boy held out his hand, and says, “I’m Steve, what’s your name?”
Once Steve found his name on the list, he started his way to his seat when someone called out, “Guys, he’s coming!”
He snuck in a glance at Steve. He attempted to read Steve’s face. Steve looked…conflicted.   The heat radiating off the other man was enticing. He wondered if Steve’s lips are as soft as it looks.
“No, is that an issue?” Steve challenged, his eyes looking at Tony with mischievousness that went straight to Tony’s groin.
“Yeah.” His voice went quiet. His eyes on the ground, the same longing stare he had earlier.  “Actually, he was my brother. We were always together, even after our parents died.”
Tony had followed Steve into the kitchen. Steve grabbed a blender from underneath the cabinet, giving Tony a nice look of his… He darted his eyes to counter. Steve also grabbed some fruits.
Tony shot him an offended look. “Wow, scathing Mr. Rogers, absolutely scathing.” That earned a cute playful eye roll from Steve that again hit Tony's heartstrings.
“They weren’t really a thing in my day, Tony,” Steve said. “And in my defense, there are a lot of buttons.”
“Captain Steve Rogers,” Tony asked, his voice dripping with amusement. “Are you telling me you don’t know how to use a washing machine?”
Somewhere between New York and Sokovia, somewhere between long briefings and even longer debriefings, somewhere between loud post-mission dinners and quiet glasses of scotch with Tony in his workshop, something formed in Steve’s mind that wasn’t so much a question as a feeling that he couldn’t quite place.
Even before he spent seventy years on ice and his whole life became one big question mark, something or other had always been keeping his mind busy.
There was one thing he couldn’t work out though and when Steve asked Tony that particular question, Tony looked at him for what felt like a whole minute.
There was the one question he shouldn’t have asked, the first question he’d ever asked Tony, back when they first met.
Tony’s laugh was a thing of beauty. It left his body so suddenly that it felt like Tony might be surprised to hear it himself.
“Great. This is great. I’m glad I came to you for help,” Steve said, throwing his laundry in. “And just for the record, they’re not tighty-whities. Natasha took me shopping.”
Steve took pride in the fact that he could figure out most things in the modern world by himself. He got the hang of talking to JARVIS very quickly. It had only taken him a couple of hours to learn how to use the tablet SHIELD provided him with. Hell, he was even starting to understand the subway system.
Why would the military not let him sign up for duty when they needed soldiers so badly? Was there something else he could do to help? When did Bucky become so smooth around girls? Was it or was it not because of his new uniform?
Can I overstep every line you drew in the sand and then some more until there are no more lines left, just you and me?
As Tony’s lake house got smaller and smaller in the rear-view mirror and it became impossible to tell whether Tony was still standing on the porch, Steve’s mind was starting to spin with all the questions he’d never asked.
Something in Steve’s chest felt tight when he asked himself if he would ever get Tony to look at him like that again.
“Of course she did.” Tony was leaning against the washing machine, looking down at Steve. “I mean, now I’m just gonna be wondering what kind of underwear you’re wearing, so thanks for that, Cap.”
Possibly, probably, it had been the moment when they were all sitting around that table at HQ together, listening to Secretary Ross talk about the Sokovia Accords.
What should they do now? Was there even a chance that they could do this without Tony? Was Tony right and they shouldn’t do anything at all? Could Steve live with himself if they didn’t at least try?
There was another question Steve tried to pit against the first one, even if it didn’t help all that much and it did nothing to get rid of the abyss in his stomach that threatened to take over his entire body:
Possibly, probably, it had been the hundreds, thousands of moments when Steve chose not to tell Tony what he knew about the death of Howard and Maria Stark.
Sometimes, when Steve felt especially weak, he’d think about just chatting to Tony, like they used to do in New York. When everyone else was asleep or at least pretending to be, when they found themselves in each other’s company in the early hours of the morning, talking about everything and nothing, because it was better than staring at the ceiling and anyway, there was a look in Tony’s eyes when he talked about something, anything that he was unabashedly excited about, something that didn’t have anything to do with saving the world, and that was a much better sight.
The next morning Tony came into work and went straight to see Detective Hill. She looked up as he approached her desk, “Mr. Stark--” she cut herself off, but Tony just looked at her. There was a painful pause before she spoke again, “--right, uh, I’m glad you’re feeling better. Last night was difficult.”
The teenager had to blind a few times before he even remembered his own name and coughed out, “Uh, uh twenty-one.”
It wasn’t the best Ode to Joy he’d ever heard, but Steve was reduced to tears by the end, giving his little boy a thumbs up as he finished, standing up to cheer with Sam. Peter came back red in the face, but proud of his work. Before Steve could scoop him up in his arms and congratulate him, Tony was telling him what a great job he did. The blond backed off. He’d have all dinner to tell Peter how impressed he was.
“I said fuck off!” Tony turned around, shouting at the other man. The two of them both stopped in their tracks, and this time Tony really did see the hurt on his face. He tried to believe that it was this stupid headache that made him want to throw up again, not that kicked puppy face.
“Fandral? Where the fuck are you! Thor needs you are Finest right fucking now!” The other voice on the line shouted.
Fuck that. Tony squared his jaw. The Captain wasn’t important in his life, The Captain didn’t matter in his life! “Fuck!” He shouted, pulling the lighter from his pocket, the little bottle, the syringe, and throwing it over the bridge and into the water. “Fuck you! Fuck you, you fucking asshole! You son of a bitch, you murdering piece of
Tony was on the ground again before he could even realize the change in the Captain’s mood. He shoved him hard, and Tony’s head slammed on the side of the table on his way down. He looked up at him in shock; hurt and confused. “W-Wha?”
“Wait,” Tony leaned forward, looking carefully at the pictures before him, “So, Thor is connected to the Captain?”
, “I don’t need you to feel bad for me because I got my ass kicked by a fucking mobster. I know when shit starts to get bad and I know when I have to leave. I stay here, I’m gonna get fucking killed, so just leave me alone--got it!?”
“Hey--Hey! Calm down!” A sharp voice shot out and Tony whipped around. It wasn’t Clint sitting by the window, but the man he’d been cursing out every waking moment he had. Standing by his bed, blond hair disheveled and blue eyes bright with… concern? It was The Captain.
Stupid question. He knew the answer. Even now, the burn of his last high was running down and he felt a splitting headache making it’s way to the front of his mind. He closed his eyes, sitting on the toilet and yanking at his hair. He’d been living with headaches for about as long as he could remember. One time, he had tried to explain it to Rhodey: there were too many thoughts in his head and not enough space, he couldn’t focus on any of them with all those ideas bouncing around.
Steve looked up as the door opened and what appeared to be a giant pile of paper bags walked in. “How about we help Birdie bring in the groceries, Little Bug?” Steve poked and tickled his sides, causing the five year old to giggle and squirm.
After a little more debate (he went with black, a classic color), Peter was secured in his carseat and they were on their way. Even though Steve thought he might vomit from the stress of it all, he had to keep reminding himself that this was for Peter. This was all for Peter.
There had probably been a few signs that the marriage was a mistake. Like when Tony came down with a horrible cold a week before the wedding, or when Steve ripped his white suit on his way to the chapel; but it’s hard to see those signs when you’re in love.
Tony mouthed at the fabric for a few moments before pulling him out. His eyes widened and Thor laughed loudly.
The words seemed to finally snap Tony out of his daze. Steve wasn’t kidding… “No!” He burst into the room. “You are not taking my son!”
But he wasn’t going out by jumping off a damn bridge. No, he was going out in Valhalla. Fuck The Captain, thinking he could cut him off. That will show him. He’s not about to die in some cold ass muddy water, he was going to get some fucking Valhalla and he didn’t care what he had to do in order to get it.
“Tony,” Peter’s voice was low now, “please. Just… listen.” Tony didn’t say anything, but he didn’t walk away either. Peter continued, “The Captain and The Warriors Three are bad people. They ruin lives. That Valhalla mix--we need to get it off the streets as soon as we can. I know that taking drugs away probably isn’t something you’re in love with, but good lives are being wasted.”
Tony huffed, turning around to walk away, but his voice stopped him again. “The Captain is all that’s keeping The Warriors Three safe. If you could, wouldn’t you want to save someone else from getting hooked?”
The Captain moved back to the group, clearly not happy with the situation. “Are you fucking stupid? You don’t even know his fucking last name! Stop thinking with your cock and grown a damn brain cell!” Tony flinched back, scooting away on his hands for a moment.
? This fucking son of a bitch is ruining my life and I want to see his stupid fucking face and I want to fucking spit on it! This mother--”
Tony hummed, taking two easy hits from the bullet and letting his head fall back in delight. “Fuck, you got all the nice stuff, babe…” He drawled. Fandral was touching him, but he wasn’t present any more.
The second time Tony came home drunk, he managed to stay conscious. Peter was already in bed and Steve had waited up for his husband. There he confronted him; told him to go back to AA. He told him that he would help him every step of the way. But Drunk Tony was Flirty Tony and he wouldn’t listen until Steve kissed him. He refused to move from the doorway until Steve blew him.
Well, then the work phone call made a bit more sense. “Yeah, someone called you,” he told him, gesturing back into the bedroom as he walked over. He had barely been awake for five minutes and he was itching for something to take the edge off. He would have to bring some home if he wanted to get any work done anyway, and Fandral seemed to be in good supply--or at least know a good supplier. “I would have rather showered with you, though…”
The Captain didn’t answer, just stood up from the bed to pace across the room. Tony watched him carefully, his eyes sharp and critical. “Why are you here?” He snapped. All that anger was coming back as Tony’s grip on reality seemed to return. Fuck this guy. “Finally show up to laugh at the fuck up? Made sure I was sober so you can kill me and I’ll suffer? That’s pretty fucking extreme for a useless junkie--”
“You were on fire, Pete! Best goalie I’ve ever seen!” Sam gushed as he shoveled pizza into his mouth. Steve only rolled his eyes fondly. Normally he would tell him not to be a pig (to which Sam and eventually Peter would retort by oinking for the next hour), but he was so proud of Peter he didn’t seem to care. He could let it slide for just one night.
“Alright, come on,” The Captain sighed and sat next to him on the bed, pulling the large duvet up and tucking Tony in tightly.
The recital was starting and Steve had to bend down and remind his son to be quiet, that they could talk to Daddy more later, and that they were listening now. The program was short, and after a shaky rendition of the Itsy Bitsy Spider, it was Peter’s turn to play. Steve gave him a messy kiss on the cheek, and he paused to give Tony a big hug before running up to the stage.
Hill tossed an evidence bag onto the desk, and Tony moved forward to look at it. Inside was a picture, well worn and a little charred on the edges, but mostly intact. It was a picture of him, from his college graduation last year. Neither Howard nor Maria had even shown up.
“I owe a debt.” The Captain’s voice rumbled out after a moment of silence. “I kept you alive. I’d like to end it there and get you out of my hair and out of my city as soon as possible.”
There was a long pause as he young man clearly tried to plan out how to tell Tony without freaking him out too much. “Honestly? We don’t know nearly as much about him as we want. He’s a classic story, grew up in a shitty part of town with a single mom, has druggie friends, probably uses a bit, himself. But not many people who know about Rogers will talk about him, and people who do? Usually aren’t around for long.”
“I’ll be good,” he breathed, leaning forward and mouthing at the Captain’s neck, “I’ll be good for you.”
“Really?” He almost didn’t seem to believe it, not daring to move from where he was eating. It made Steve desperately wish he didn’t have to worry about Tony not showing.
So this one is a little longer, since the beginning chapter wasn't too much. Just wanted to get the ball rolling. Still no Steve in here, sorry about that! He'll show up in the next one. WARNING: Mild dub-con, explained in the end notes.
Steve’s voice recalled his protective words in an instant and he winced as the scene came back to him…
“Tony, you have a fucking job to do, do it!” An angry voice hissed in his ear, dragging Tony back to reality. He swallowed a few times and cleared his throat, “Wanna dance again?”
And yet… when The Captain reached out to touch him in concern, Tony actually felt like--something that didn’t happen when his father raised his hands to hit him. Still, Tony flinched back and covered his throat as he gulped for air. Why did it feel like he didn’t have legs? Why did it feel like everything was too bright and too loud?
Shit, had he? Tony hadn’t looked into a mirror last night, but his hips did hurt like fuck, not to mention the throbbing in his head that felt like more than a hangover. “Well then maybe you could make it up to me…?” He fluttered his lashes at him.
“I would love to, Pete,” Tony sunk to his knees, smiling at his son, “But I have to get back to work. I had a great time watching you play! You were fantastic.”
Steve loved Tony, he really really did. He could look past a little fighting, a few broken trinkets, but he would not allow Tony to traumatize his baby.
Tony didn’t remember getting home, but he remembered how the bottle burned in his pocket. Black tar. He just bought fucking
Moving all his shit to New York was a pain in the ass. Tony didn’t like going outside too often, one of the reasons he holed himself up in his room to work, and he was more than looking forward to a chance to just get back to that work. Not to mention he was itching for some blow.
Tony flipped the razor back and forth in his hand, looking at the fine white line he had made on his text book. Was he really doing this? He scrubbed a hand across his face.
“I don’t like you.” Tony spoke up after his breathing finally calmed down enough to think. Still, his voice was laced with the pestilence of a scolded child.
The first year of marriage had been wonderful. The honeymoon stage seemed like it would never end and the two of them had never felt better. But Steve wanted a baby. He wanted a baby with every fiber of his being--he saw them everywhere! And Tony wasn’t sure. He said he wasn’t ready; said they should enjoy their marriage alone for a little bit longer…
Peter pulled out a case file, setting it down on the desk for Tony to see. “He’s ex-military, a man by the name of Steve Rogers. He took control of the Commandos real early on, enough that we think he was one of the guys who built it. When they weren’t killing people they weren’t too much of a problem. We stay out of their way, they stay out of ours. But… I mean, when bodies start piling up…. We don’t like the bad guys, but we have a code. Justice. The right way.” He ran a hand through his hair, “And to make matters worse? About a week ago the Captain started cleaning shop, we think something big is going to happen and soon. That’s why we need to get him away as fast as possible.”
Tony actually laughed. “That’s… so lame!” He rolled his eyes, “You’re kidding me--this guy is serial killing bad guys and wants to do a little finger painting on the side?”
Maybe Steve should have left it there, just explained it to Peter and taken him out for ice cream. He and Sam would make it up to him in any way they could--they would be what Tony wasn’t.
“We looked into your parents’ accident,” She went on to tell him, “And we found a lot of evidence to support that the car was tampered with. We don’t think your parents were killed by accident, Tony. And we think The Captain did it. Don’t you want to see justice for them?”
“You said,” the Captain ran his hands down his back, groping at his ass through his jeans, “that might lips might be fun to kiss. Wanna find out?”
The Captain wasn’t moving from the window and he didn’t seem like he was going to say or do anything anytime soon. Tony frowned. He had never been comfortable in silence and this was more than an uncomfortable situation already. But if there was one thing that this horrible detox was showing him it was that he had nothing to lose. This was rock bottom.
Parker looked genuinely surprised at that question. “Well, your father was a Howling Commando. If there’s even a tiny chance this coding has any information on that--we’ll do anything to get our hands on it.”
“Woah, woah,” Tony stepped back again, “I took drugs, that’s what I do, why does it matter what mix I did?”
He let out a booming laugh, slapping his ass before pulling out the bullet from the night before, “God, you’re such a little slut! Here, come on have your fill my precious.”
Tony snorted, “Coulda fooled me.” Tony was playing with fire right now but his strange confidence from his complete mental breakdown made him feel invincible--for better or for worse. “What’s up with the lame-ass glasses?”
This was a sketchy place, but that was to be expected with a drug deal. It was nearly on the other side of the city, tucked away between two alley’s and looked like a condemned little side building more than a place someone lived (but he supposed that was the point, wasn’t it?). Tony knocked the code into the door, and a few moments later it opened to reveal a tall, thin, man with wicked eyes and a heartless grin.
The Captain raised a brow at that, reaching out to pinch Tony’s arm. It stung. “I’m the realest person you’re ever gonna meet, Anthony.”
There had been a lot of lows in his life, but getting half a hand job and then thrown on the ground and told he was pathetic by a mobster three times his size was definitely one for the books. Once he made it out of Finest, Tony went straight on his way home, completely blowing past the van outside that held his detective babysitters.
Tony doesn’t talk to Peter again for a long while, just sitting at his stupid office chair while he waits for it to be late enough to meet up with Fandral. It figures that he would get himself into this stupid fucking situation. He should have just taken the drug charge in the first place and left all this Captain bullshit behind him. Howard Stark was still fucking him up, even from beyond the grave.
Peter held his hand as they walked down the aisle of the church, the three of them fitting into a pew towards the front where all the other performers were sitting.
His head whipped to the side to look at him in shock, “Tony,” He corrected on instinct and narrowed his eyes. “How the hell do you know my name?”
“Tony,” Hill moved forward, trying to do that thing where she pretends that she cares about him so he’ll do what she wants. “Tony, we have a deal. You can’t back out now.”
What would it be like to jump into that water? It was cold, probably. Was the jump long enough that it would kill him on impact? Or would he panic, fight for his life in the water as it pulled him down again and again? He didn't want to die, at least he didn’t think he did. But if he was dead, he wouldn’t have to deal with all of this. He wouldn’t have to deal with how much of a fuck up junkie he was, he wouldn’t have to deal with the police, he wouldn’t have to deal with letting down Parker like he let down everyone else. He wouldn’t have to deal with The Captain.
Aaaaand, there it was. Tony grimaced, “Look, I’m not some sort of undercover cop and I’m not a fucking narc so I don’t--”
“I’m not feeling great tonight,” Tony told him, stepping closer into his personal space. The bullet was hanging from his neck, Tony could just snatch it and take a hit. It would make his bones stop aching… “Come on, let’s get out of here. Get a good high, just enjoy ourselves.”
“I have to run that deal over in Red Hook tonight with Tasha, but I’m not sure he can be on his own. He sees things--it’s creepy as shit.”
Tony had tried requesting that he bring the information home, but Detective Hill told him there was no way in hell they were trusting him alone with this stuff (he was a liability, it seemed). The teen wanted to clean his hands of all things his father as soon as possible, so that meant either smuggling coke into the NYPD, or getting the information back to his apartment. While Tony lived for danger, he figuring bringing the information out would be a lot easier.
“He’s coming,” Steve glanced at his watch. Tony was coming. It was only 1:20, there was still plenty of time. He was coming.
The recital was running a little late, it was already five past, and Steve was ready to cry. Tony still wasn’t there. He was past the fear, the worry about seeing his ex-husband, and onto anger. How dare Tony let Peter down like this? How dare Steve let him get his hopes up?
Tony looked down at the water, watching it swirl ominously below him. Did Rhodey ever think about him? He must have heard that his parents died by now… but it wasn’t like he was going to call Tony or something. He made it very clear he was leaving if Tony stayed like this. He couldn’t stand to watch him like this, couldn’t stand to be around him. It made sense, Tony didn’t want to be around himself, either.
“Now now, little one,” Thor stepped up, clearly seeing the desperate panic in his eyes. “I can’t stand to see a pretty little thing like you looking so upset. I can’t sell to you, but I know someone who can.”
“Cut the crap, Stark, I’m writing up a search warrant right fucking now, I knew we shouldn’t trust a Stark--”
Before he could think the man was yanking Tony back by his shirt and sending him across the floor. He fell back on his arms and stared up at him with big eyes. “Hey, what’s the problem?” He shot, trying to act like he wasn’t about to shit his pants.
Tony grimaced at the name. “It’s Tony,” he corrected once more. He didn’t even bother to hide his irritation with the other under his usual charm. He felt like his entire body had been thrown around in a riptide then wrong completely dry. It didn’t help that he felt like his skin was too tight on his body and that there was a pinball machine in his head shooting off random spikes of pain and nausea. Still, Tony was impressed with himself as he managed to look as casual as possible for someone who felt like the Grim Reaper just fucked him in the ass. “I don’t have a damn clue. To ruin my life? It doesn’t make any damn sense why you’re so fucking obsessed with making me as miserable as possible all the time!” He was shouting by the end of it but to his credit The Captain remained motionless.
Tony turned to look at Thor, and saw the baggie hanging in his hand, “Wanna earn yourself a treat?” His mouth was watering, and somewhere in the back of his mind he knew that this was pathetic but the other part of him remembered that powerful rush and he wanted more. One last night of this, he might as well get a good ride from it.
“Fuck! Yeah, fuck that’s right, I’m gonna mess that pretty little face up. I bet you’ll let me and Fandral fuck you right here, you desperate whore…” Tony hummed, that might be a good way to spend his night, coked out of his mind and a good fuck. Fandral wasn’t too bad but it seemed like Thor was going to be good. There was a commotion behind him, and Thor’s hand tightened in his hair almost painfully. Had he been doing something wrong?
When baby Peter came, the sex stopped. But Tony figured that wouldn’t last long. Babies grew up, after all. But then going out on dates stopped, alone time stopped. When Tony had to go into the city for work one day, he wanted Steve to come. He promised he would get the most qualified nanny in the country but Steve wouldn’t hear it. Not his baby.
. The man was covered in so much mystery, and he worked with his father, and he just had to know more about him… but like fuck if he was going to do that with a cop in his ear.
“Okay,” Tony focused on Peter now, because he seemed to be the only one here on his side, “I went to a club! I took what I got, I didn’t ask where it came from!”
it was The Captain! That stupid asshole was able to ruin his life without even being there! The Captain was at work, The Captain was in his home, The Captain was stopping him from even getting a fucking
Sam smoothed his hands up and down Steve’s arms, “Hey, hey, don’t work yourself up, Darling...” He kissed Steve’s forehead again, this time leaving his lips there. “I’ll be there, I’ll step in if anything happens. I can get Peter out of there in a minute flat.”
The code that Tony was working on was hard, and even he would admit it. Howard wasn’t just some rich dude who was kinda smart--he was a genius. And Tony was quickly figuring out that he didn’t want anyone without a password to get into these files. Sitting here and staring at them didn’t seem to be doing him any good, and he knew that he wasn’t going to make any progress with a weak ass high and in this fucking white walled room.
“Well, what would you like?” He asked, pulling him back into the bedroom so that he could get dressed.
The last clue was the one that confused him the most, though. It was a weird detail for him to make up, but one he was sure hadn’t been a part of The Captain before: thick brimmed huge square glasses. The kind that made you wonder what designer even decided to bring these horrible things into creation and question the sanity of the poor near blind dumbass who chose to wear them.
“Well, uh,” Peter continued, twisting his fingers together as he spoke, “I, um, I wanna, uh, wanna invite--invite Daddy…”
“Tony, come on,” Peter put a hand on his shoulder, “this is grounds to search your apartment, even your home back in Malibu, how much are we gonna find there? How long could we put you away?”
Tony was already rushing to the men’s section and only glanced over at the petite woman, “Yeah, hey, good morning,” He grunted, not paying any mind to the calculated look she sent his way.
Steve shot him a look, then glanced at Peter’s closed door. “If you’re going to shout, don’t swear, too!” He snapped, “Do you want Peter to pick up those words?”
Tony threw a hundred dollar bill at the man at the door, pushing past him into the bar. It was late, and there were plenty of people there. He was instantly transported back in time, just like that last time he came here. The smoke hung heavy, the red light behind the bar made it all seem risque. But Tony didn’t give a shit about any of that. He made his way to the VIP section he remembered from his time there with Fandral. There was a man at the door, clearly armed and looking fairly intimidating. He was big enough to do some serious damage to anyone, and even more so Tony. But that was hardly enough to stop him, he had nothing to lose anymore. He tried to push his way past the bouncer, but he yanked him back by his shirt, laughing at him.
“Watch out for the stairs!” Steve called after them, putting away the other groceries before they spoiled.
Oh okay, wow. She wasn’t even going to try and appeal to him. It was straight to the blackmail. Well, good to know that was where they stood. “I really don’t give a flying fuck,” Tony told her, “Arrest me. I’ll get a good lawyer, I’m the heir to the Stark Fortune, after all.”
“Fuck this,” Tony breathed out, grabbing his coat off the chair and leaving his apartment once more. If he stayed in this damn apartment trying to figure out this stupid code, he was just going to feel sorry for himself, and he was way too sober to feel sorry for himself.
Sam looked over from where he was holding down a squirming Peter, trying to comb down his unruly hair for just once in his life. “Again? I thought you decided on the green?”
The room was rather normal, however. Given all the other context clues he would expect fine furnishing for this guest room--that’s what mafia bedrooms were like, right? But this room felt a little more like… a hotel? A slightly fancier Best Western? But what really caught his eye was in the corner of the room by his bed was an IV stand with a bag of fluid attached. It was then that Tony looked down at his hand to see the tapped cannula poking out of his skin.
“As long as I know when it is,” He nodded, “I would love to.” He held out his arms, “Can I get a hug from my big man?”
“Steve,” Sam rose, letting Peter escape to scamper off and play with his toys, “you look great in everything. Wear what you want. I like the green.”
Maybe he shouldn’t have taken that black tar. It helped his shakes, sure, it helped his body stop aching, but he felt like shit.
Tony scrubbed his hands down his face and grunted, “Fucking--fine. Okay. Show me the goddamn powerpoint presentation…”
So Tony continued. “What the fuck is your problem? I’m just some junkie kid who happened to bump into you and you decide to ruin my entire life? Are you some kind of angry closeted homophobe--is it because I had a dick in my mouth?!” Tony was dangerously close to being in hysterics and his already thin filter was completely gone.
There was another tense silence that hung through the air as The Captain considered his words. It looked like he was not deciding on whether he was going to keep him alive or not; it looked like he was deciding on whether to tell Tony the truth. “I don’t want you to die,” He finally answered.
“You know, I prefer the term, ‘recreational enthusiast--” Tony started but he shut the hell up when she held out the cup to him.
“Huh?” Tony turned to see Fandral in a towel in the doorway, grinning back at him. “Oh, you’re up. I was going to wake you once I got out of the shower, I have to get going to work.”
“Yeah, okay,” he snatched the cup out of her hand, turning and stalking his way into the bathroom. “Making me pee in a fucking cup…” He muttered to himself, dutifully pissing in the cup he was asked to and returning to Detective Hill with a smile.
“Fuck this,” He groaned, arms shaking as he vomited again into the toilet. He wiped his face, standing up. His legs felt like jelly, and his eyes looked too pale, but he didn’t look at himself for long. He didn’t want to.
“Come on.” Fandral was pulling at Tony now, and he was surprised that he didn’t fall over, considering he couldn’t find the ground. How long had they been dancing? Hadn’t they only just started? “--need another hit.”
Going back to his apartment was the ideal solution, his skinny jeans were a little stained and his shirt smelled like booze, but he didn’t have time to make it all the way back to Midtown from Brooklyn and then head to the station. Hill would already have his ass for being as late as he was. Tony settled on darting into the nearby thrift store to grab himself a new shirt and hoped for the best.
“Shh--shh, little Firebird,” the blond hushed him, his voice breaking with laughter, “Shh, we have to be quiet…”
An hour passed without a response and Steve finally put his phone away to get to the cleaning and starting dinner. He had hoped that Tony would be bigger than that--that he would be able to see past their differences to give Peter the childhood that neither of them had. But maybe he had over estimated Tony… Maybe he was perfectly happy at rock bottom.
“It matters,” Hill hissed, “Because Valhalla is currently being distributed by only four people, all of which work very tightly with Thor Odinson!”
“So,” Tony looked at him through hooded eyes, his hand trailing up his muscled arm three drinks later. The two of them had relocated to a more private lounge. It turned out that Fandral was good tries with the owner of the club and had access to the VIP area. In there, Tony got to meet a few of his friends, but not the owner yet. When he saw his other options, he was glad he’d settled for Fandral.
“Tony, how did you get this?” Peter took on the role of good cop, approaching the teen slowly. “What did you do last night?”
It was kind of true. He did think that if he stayed here he was going to get killed, but he was just as likely to get killed without the help of the cops. See, that was the worst part about all of this. He was disgusted by The Captain, just like The Captain was disgusted by him, but he also was so
“Hey,” The blond greeted. He wasn’t anything special, but he sure wasn’t an eyesore. It made things easier. He had on similar clothes to Tony; sinfully tight leather pants and a muscle tank that showed off his arms. And god, did he have arms! Tony had long since accepted his muscle obsession (fetish?) and this man’s almost made up for that… questionable facial hair (it was only okay when Tony did that).
His feet took him to Assgard before he could really think about it. It was still a little early in the evening, and he was not at all dressed to be at a club, but none of that really mattered to him. He just needed to get in there, find Fandral, suck his dick or something, and get a good fix of what he needed. He had nearly 500 cash in his pocket, he was willing to pay what he needed to in order to just
Tony clenched his teeth, “That’s cheap fucking blow, even for a pig like you,” He shot at her, “Lucky for me though my parents didn’t give a shit about me, so I don’t really give a shit about them either.”
Clint’s presence was comforting, despite the situation. He didn’t talk but rather just read in the corner or played around on his phone. For the most part, he pretended that Tony wasn’t there. While at first it was annoying, considering how many questions he still had, it was a relief that Clint didn’t look at him like some sort of freak when he seemed to find himself somewhere other than that bedroom.
“Yeah, it’s pretty deep in there. It’s just so we can feed you information if you need it. Just don’t draw too much attention to yourself and you’re going to be fine, Tony. Really.”
Yeah, no shit. Tony rolled his eyes but kept back the snotty comment. He wasn’t in the mood for that this morning. He hadn’t gotten any sleep the night before, and he was sure it showed on his face. Tony couldn’t help it, but the events of the night before just kept playing over and over again on his mind. The Captain’s hands on his hips, his voice in his ear, the way the drugs pumped through him made him feel like he was red, pulsing and floating at the same time. It should have been great, fun even. People don’t turn down Tony Stark.
“Huh?” Tony sat up now. As he looked around, the pieces of the night before came back. This wasn’t his apartment, this wasn’t his bed… but it sure as hell was nice…
Peter gave him a playful smack on the back of the head, but sobered up after a moment, “I mean it, you ass.”
Feedback gives me life! Please let me know what you think so far, this is still a WIP so suggestions are more than welcome :)
“Now, Odinson is a real menace,” Hill cut in, “He and his people are extremely violent, and to add insult to injury, they know the law pretty well. They’ve been throwing it in our faces that we can’t pin anything on them since the day they set foot in New York.”
Steve should have stopped then. Tony just needed time, and Steve should have been able to wait. It was one of those signs again, but Steve loved Tony and he wanted Tony to love a baby, too.
“Tony,” Hill brought his attention back to the argument at hand, “we think The Captain is responsible for your parents’ murder.”
Yes. Tony grumbled to himself, what a kind soul you are providing me with the bare minimum care to keep me alive while I puke out my entire soul.
“Okay. Come on, don’t be a pussy,” He taunted himself. This stuff was supposed to make it easier to think, that’s what the guy in his lab had said… Tony bit his lip and leaned down, snorting through half the line before he had to lean back and cough a few times.
“It was fine,” Sam sighed, “I’d much rather have been here with you two. What did you and Pete do all day?”
Steve stared at the screen, shaking with livid rage. How dare he! How could Tony treat him like this?! He typed out several hateful drafts before settling with something more benign. He wasn’t going to play into that.
“Oh you wouldn’t believe how tight his ass is,” Fandral purred, his hand slipping under his shirt to rub Tony’s chest. “He’s an absolute slut. Just give him a little blow and he’ll spread it anywhere, isn’t that right Firebird?”
Tony fell back on the kitchen floor, the pleasure of the shot flowing through him, but the world around him was spinning, changing…
“Stark--” She growled but Tony waved a hand at her, stepping into the room and stretching his arms over his head.
Sam was great, really. Sometimes he was the only thing that kept Steve going (and he hated those days--Peter should be more than enough to keep him going). Sam was supportive, and he let Steve and Peter move in without a second thought. He helped Steve, listened to him, and did everything he could for him. Not to mention, he was great with Peter. He practiced soccer in the yard with him everyday, helped him with the carpool; hell, sometimes, when Steve was too tired or too sick, he would let him stay in bed all day and take off work so Peter had someone.
