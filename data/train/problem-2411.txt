smart.”
“I can understand,” Sherlock muttered. “My father was a more unusual man than you can possibly imagine.”
They are in the living room, Sherlock stripped down to his pajama trousers, a towel draped over the back of the chair he is straddling. John is standing next to him holding a vial of purple dye, and a plastic comb, and plastic gloves, which are together going to dye his hair a fiery ginger.
a bit romantic, he realizes. But he’s not sure it’s not just misplaced admiration, desire unmet and so undirected, maybe he doesn’t
“Sorry, dear,” John said, obviously summoning his powers of pleasantry. He smiled at her and removed the lid from the curry dish. Steam roiled through the air. He sat down and unfolded his napkin and there was an obvious stillness until Sherlock leaned forward and served himself.
It was just that Sherlock had become accustomed, in a moment in which an opponent has become temporarily disabled, to press the advantage.
He stops talking because Sherlock has rolled his eyes and then his shoulders to loosen up the wings. The big black wings unfurling into the room, hair swirling around unseen horns becoming visible, his eyes glinting from blue to silver with a spike of red in the pupil. There's a deepening shadow that clings to him, that spreads slowly around them, but it's not a frightening one, just one that says its master has accepted his own darkness.
“It would be helpful, logistically. We’re going to be spending our lives together. We may as well do so formally.”

“He travels a lot. Business. There’s nothing to feel sorry about, John.”
“You idiot,” he said, “you fantastic bloody man, you...Yes, of course I’m still in love with you, I never stopped and it scares me how much I still need you.”
It only takes a year. And some. Some time more than a year; John’s not adjusted back to a calendar and the difference between days until they return. In triumph. Mission successful. World saved. They reveal themselves to London. Move back to 221b. Offer explanations and hug people and apologize. Mycroft sincerely thanks them. They’ve done the right thing. He repeats that, several times.
It was a long game but he was not impatient, satisfied of the win. He would have everything: the work, John, John happy. And the child, who he knew was a requirement for John - but he might grow to appreciate it; he hadn’t ever thought to be in a relationship or in a relationship with John, and look where they were now.
And John’s heart almost broke, seeing her concern, her absolute undying love for him, her moving herself into a small little space so Sherlock could take up the rest, if that was what would make John

Sherlock had no idea what this was referring to. John could translate.
The evidence she had was that Sherlock was incredibly intelligent, that he used those skills in ways the world hadn’t seen before, to the degree he was capable of, that he didn’t care about being nice, that he was willing and able to act nice, and that he was willing of a deeper level of psychological manipulation that was breathtakingly masterly, only, he hadn’t tried hard because he didn’t assume much of her, which meant his earlier statement of having heard so much about her already was a lie.

. John first read this book in fourth grade, from a library sale where he’d gotten it for 50p. He’d fallen in love with it. Just smashingly besotted, reading it over and over, until the words became a sort of trance he slid through because he already knew them so well. He couldn’t say at the time, or now, why he liked it so much, and his fondness for it now is almost entirely nostalgic, but there it is: for awhile, that book was everything. He feels a pang for his old copy, the one with the blue-sleek ship gliding by pink, waving arms reaching out of a terrible depth, the one that smelled like soft dirt and was growing yellow by the time he found it. This copy is hardback, stiff, thick creamy paper with ruffled edges.
John cleared his throat, pursed his lips, looked like he was going to say something and then didn’t.
Sherlock. John had the hardest time placing it, thinking about it all night, over dinner as he politely answered questions and watched Sherlock v. Mycroft, Grudgematch Round Countless Times. Something in them both that seemed weightless, like they both might fly off at any moment, like they were waiting for a soundless call to whisk them away.

“I thought the baby would help too,” she said quietly, almost too low for John to hear, except he was on the last stair and about the round the corner where they were. “But last night he looked so alone...”
If it was. It was quite the coincidence, for his whole day to change just to meet with Stamford and be introduced to John who himself just happened to be walking by.
“Do you wish it would?” she asked quietly.
“Oh. Oh, that’s good. Important, you can’t just get away from that. Well. Mine isn’t. Just a bit of fun. The Felspoon mountains will sway on, ah?”
The next morning, Sherlock is still awake, reading five-year-old news articles online. John puts the kettle on.

John barked a laughed and leaned forward, knocking on the cab’s window. “Excuse me? Yes. Can I get out now please? Here is fine.” He unbuckled before the car came to a halt, jumping out despite Sherlock’s grab at his arm. Sherlock quickly followed but John shook his head, pushing him back on the sidewalk.

John’s never kissed a man. He’s thought about it, a few times, but he really liked women and they really liked him so...
Sherlock watched carefully.
The mysterious Sherlock was nothing like she’d been anticipating: dark hair and pale skin, so bone tall, with a face that was sharp and beautiful, with eyes that glimmered like water and steel. He looked startling and bizarre, until you looked again, and then he was gorgeous but in the way a statue is, untouchable, and cold. Until he’d smiled. The smile made him look even stranger but infinitely more human. He was in an impressively slim black suit and plum shirt, and holding flowers, a crush of white snowdrop splattered with red carnations. He held them out to John, with a smirk, eyebrow raised, and John had quietly said something she couldn’t hear, and then Sherlock had laughed and smiled. And the smile was gentle, and warm, and incredibly intimate, from a world that was only occupied by him and the man he was offering it to, and there was a look in Sherlock’s eyes that… that didn’t take a genius to deduce.

Now Sherlock was being quiet on purpose. He knew this would  provoke the other person to speak. He wondered when the phone would vibrate in his hand, and what John could be doing that’s possibly more important than answering him, it only takes a minute.
“Please don’t,” John whispered back. “I can’t do this.”
“Oh.” John frowned. (Sherlock noted that he had an adorable frown.)
“When I’m already dead?”
“Thank you. I was fresh out of nightmares this month.”
Mycroft stopped going on their trips, soon after that. But by then he liked Sherlock, and Sherlock thought his brother was as best as a normal person could be, so it was okay.

He spent a lot of his time in his mind parting those cold lips and slipping in pieces of paper that said ‘it’s not true’ and ‘it’ll be better’ and ‘I’ll come back’ and ‘I’m sorry’ and ‘I love you’ and ‘I love you’ and ‘I love you’.

John was slumped down, a visible weight hanging from his shoulders, a look of anguish and bitter self-resentment. Sherlock felt the instant pull to stand up, to hold him, to protect him from some enemy. He imagined himself standing between them, kissing John, his back to Mary. And how much worse that would make it. And the truth that he wanted no one to point out, the truth that John’s enemy here was himself, was also, in some ways, Sherlock. Not, as much was it was ethically simpler, to castigate Mary as some interloper or as some sacrificial angel that would have rescued John and now retreat.
Like, “I’m immortal.”
“Lestrade,” he said warmly, stepping through. The detective startled guilty, leaning away from Mary, who put on her brave smile for him. “Nice to see you! We still on for the match next week?”
He’d always thought that as he grew older, he would travel more. As a child he was a liability, yes. But as an adult, surely they’d come pick him up, and take him with them forever.

This makes very little sense to John, because that’s why he’d done it in the first place, to protect Sherlock. So Sherlock wouldn’t have to. So John, who was already damaged, would have to hold these memories. But it is Sherlock who looks tormented. It makes John angry, which is irrational, but if John did this
They were not going to lose anymore.

relationships, then be very careful of your next steps, because I swear to God Johnny, if harm comes to her I will rip out your intestines and wrap them around each other’s neck to hang you with. Yeah?”
Sherlock was positively brimming with satisfaction but John was shut down, staring out of the cab window and refusing even a gentle shoulder rub. Sherlock had hoped that John would move past this moralizing guilt quickly, especially as they’d received Mary’s blessings, but he looked positively ill. A conversation about their relationship - which he wanted to push forward immediately, thinking of their flat, thinking of taking John in their flat - might only aggravate the needless and pointless shame. So Sherlock jumped on the topic of the child, wanting to again impress how seriously he took it.
But since Mary was genuinely nice they were always having to out-nice each other, and making sure the other one wasn’t just being nice and keeping their desires secret, and because Mary was nice she did not for a moment suspect something was up. When John said Sherlock was busy with the kidnapping case, and then that he was catching up with family, and then that he was just too tired (
There is something like cold steel in his voice. Sherlock crosses his arms, lays one wrist against the other, sitting up firmly straight in the chair. He looks at John, and John nods, with approval.

The response was immediate.
“This is about your relationship with John.”
John gulped down his drink and laid his head on the table. “Jesus, Harry.”
“I have been setting things right. That is right. To allow John to live his life with wife and child. If I reintroduced myself into his life, it would....I would be a distraction.”

It took a few minutes for the thoughts to correctly organize themselves through Mary’s mind, and then she bolted upright so fast that she wobbled and something went swimming through her skin, a foot pressing out of her womb like a shark fin rising sleekly and vanishing back into the depths.
But Sherlock was right. He deserved to know what John was. Who Uncle Jack was. He hadn’t told him because... well, because it would change everything, wouldn’t it, Sherlock’s entire knowledge of the universe. And because he wasn’t supposed to tell anyone. And because John wondered, when he watched Sherlock staring at the stars, looking at the ripples of movement and accident and purpose in the world, if he wouldn’t lose Sherlock to the big, beautiful new place out there.
Whatever step he was on now, he didn’t need her.
“He’s a doctor,” he told his father, while scouring through debris. “Here, you’ll need this.”
It wasn’t that John couldn’t forgive him, truly, honestly, fully: for Sherlock to say that he was the first person to understand John and love John and then abandon him (John kept feeling that Sherlock had pushed

“You love me more than you love her,” Sherlock observed.
She looked much like Mycroft, the same soft features and flat nose, though of course much prettier. Her red hair had softened into a brilliant white and she greeted them outside a modest little country manor in a green cotton dress. Seeing the three together, one might guess that Sherlock was adopted, all thin and dark and sharp looking. There was plenty of family in them, of course, and then there was also something in their mother that was so
“Yes.”
“I’m sorry for leaving you.”
And John says, “You are the one who broke me.”
“I understand if you can’t come, it-”

His parents couldn’t visit every year, but they tried. It was glorious, getting to see them and leaving on adventures. Sometimes he got to travel for months, leaving after lunch and returning before dinner of the same day. Sometimes they would just see the bees, and drink lemonade, and then he had to go home. But they did try. Sherlock knew he was loved and that they just couldn’t keep him on.
“There,” says John thickly, “the water’s run clear.”
He waited until John was into his second pint (not buzzed, but comfortable) to bring up his actual topic. “John,” he started, “I, uh...I know it’s none of my business, but we’re mates, right, and I’ve somehow gotten in the middle of this. So I’d like to know does... does Mary

He returned with their drinks, three lime slices and a stir straw for Harry, no ice, just as she liked. She shoved the shells away from her, pulled the water close and sucked slowly through the thin straw. John noticed her lips were chapped - she always picked at them when she was stressed.

“We’ll have to have him over though, won’t we? I can’t imagine how happy you must be, to have your friend back.” She took the cup from Lestrade, who had quietly reappeared, and gulped the entire thing down. “You too, Greg. We should have a celebratory dinner together. What’s Sherlock’s favourite meal? D’you think he’d play charades?”
John has lost everything.
“Okay, John. The morning.”
"Is this a game?" John asks. "Like a role play thing? Because if you want it that's fine, but we should really discuss it - "
Ah. Because of course Mary could forgive him, surely already had, categorizing it as shock and moving on. She moved on better than any human he’d ever met. But she’d heard all of Sarah’s stories, when they first started dating, and was worried John was going to run off with Sherlock.

But that was later. John tried to keep things in temporal order; Sherlock’s way just gave him headaches. Before then, there was the day.
At the hospital, after finishing Moran and the lot of them and almost dying, again or actually or anyway, it was confusing even to himself, Sherlock was lying broken apart in a hospital bed. And John was sitting next to him. He was drifting awake/asleep in a ghostly halo of morphine and pain and he couldn’t think properly and was just miserable. And then he felt John’s hand on his head, gently brushing back his hair. He leaned into it and John softly stroked his jaw, and whispered “

with you.”
“You’re divorcing Mary to take up with him. Holy shit. What about the sprog?”
There is this red-headed league, it’s a case, Sherlock has to investigate with, naturally, red hair. He is capable of dyeing his own hair and has done so before, but it is far easier with an assistant, and John has agreed. This is a simple matter: John provides the labor, sets the timer, Sherlock showers and rinses, Sherlock is ready to gather data in the morning.
“Darling, uhm. Lestrade is here because - well, we just found out, that is - Sherlock is back.”
Mary rose from her chair, as grandly as she could. “I would like to talk to you in private, Sherlock. John can stay and clean up dinner.”
, Sherlock.”
“Of course,” Sherlock said. He was still staring at her. She stared back, watching the conversation take place between them that was only minutely in words, like they were characters in a very Godot play. “I understand.”
"That..." John seems to be scrambling for a thought. He stares at Sherlock's wings, at the flicker of heat around him, stares at his eyes even after Sherlock retreats from his more fiendly appearance. He sits heavily into his chair. Look around the room for some support.
John wonders if there isn’t a like-minded soul out there for Sherlock, somewhere. But now he knows Irene wasn’t. She was The Woman, but not
woman.
with its experience, imbued with the emotion of its origin, a feat of time-travel in memory. John does. John was a collector as a child: bits of quartz and ticket stubs and notes from girl friends because they were bored, explaining how bored they were. The army had stripped this from him with a stern ease but once “this flat with a madman” became “this flat with a madman, my best friend, which is home” (an incredibly fast transition, in hindsight) his innate fondness for objects crept back into his hands. He found jumpers and bought books and kept a strain of ephemera in his dresser drawers, newspaper clippings of their adventures and tickets from the concerts Sherlock took them to and menus from the trips they took on cases.
But Sherlock doesn’t say anything. He’s not sure what to say except, finally, “That felt nice. My hair.”
And to that, even with his world turned upside down, even with his lover and friend and other half apparently a mythical monster, and even though he's just learned he’s immortal after he dies, somehow, and even though he's held his own skull, and even though Sherlock's left a black wing on the floor and is looking irritated, like John needs to get over his existential crisis and go back to the kissing, even with all that, that comment makes him smile.
“Hmm?” The man froze, looking at John expectantly. It made Mary think of a puppy awaiting better orders. Mary saw his eyes dance around John’s face, a sharp focus to his eyes. The genial grin slipped away and reappeared the angular, almost predatory man she’d first seen at the door.
“Are you going to?” Lestrade asked.
Lestrade sighed and rubbed his eyes. He hasn’t gotten much rest, either. The nervous way he turned his neck was discomfort; his shirt was wrinkled and there was an old pair of socks balled up under his desk. He slept here on a couch. He would pour another coffee and regret it.
This wasn’t exactly the argument Lestrade was expecting. He wanted to, of all things and very badly, hug Sherlock and ruffle his hair as if the man were his son. And he knew that next time someone called Sherlock a sociopath to his face they were going to have a
John stilled Sherlock’s hands and did the last two buttons himself. Sherlock swallowed heavily and continued. “The time I came closest to dying I was lying bleeding in the Russian snow, with three broken ribs, five men still on my trail, no weapon, and all I wanted was to be back here with my warm John who could make everything better...”

John leaned his head into Sherlock’s chest and sobbed. It was a surprising sound, and Sherlock laid his hand in John’s hair gingerly, not sure what this meant.
“You used... the old words,” John said, sounding confused. He walked in and glanced at his chair but decided to not sit down and Sherlock realized how uncomfortable he felt, and Sherlock blurted it out.
The likelihood that Sherlock is an inexperienced heterosexual occurs to John only very late, with the realization that as a proper theorist he should consider every avenue. He contemplates the option. He looks up at Sherlock, who is tuning his violin while he stares at the fireplace, his eyes looking out but mind turned inward. He’s wearing that purple shirt.
He knew John.
Sherlock grabbed him and pulled him up and it was John who started the kiss, who pulled Sherlock into him with a moan. And everything became this, this heat, this smooth slide, the slow entanglement, Sherlock pushing him back against the chair, John sliding his hands under Sherlock’s shirt and he gasped and it was that familiar noise that seemed to snap John back.
John, actually, wanted a family. He wanted someone he could come home to and laugh with and talk about the day with and treat gently be treated gently by and be alone around and support and be supported by and someone who would help stretch a shelter around them as a place to come to when the world or their own selves were too much and someone who could read him and then ask about what she saw as more than data and collection and someone who he could just,

Sherlock lifts an eyebrow. It is an exquisite retort. John finds he is actually angry.

She saw it in his eyes, or maybe was just imagining wild demons, howling madness; she started crying and babbling and sank into the wall. Sherlock waited a moment, to determine if she’s confessing anything important. No. So he texted Lestrade and then stood by her and waited, his heart still thumping in his chest, pumping blood into his mouth where he’d cut into his tongue with his teeth on a sharp fall. Chased her across a roof and down the fire escape, into this alley: she’s thirty-four, brunette, worked in a bakery, divorced, no children, started to take heroin (likely therapeutically, for an undiagnosed bipolar disorder), met a

This, as an answer, would still not surprise him.)

In fact, this was how he spent the bulk of his evenings. Mary went to bed early these days, physically exhausted even if she read for suspiciously long. So John would turn on the telly and get out his phone as soon as her door shut. Not that he was doing it behind her back, she knew they were sending messages, he’d answer them in front of her if it was at the shop or something, and he kept them all, on his phone. If she read them they’d seem perfectly innocent. And they were. There were a thousand things neither Sherlock or John had said yet, and wouldn’t, over a phone. They didn’t talk about the missing three years, or the kiss, or what had been, or their growing absence from each other. But Sherlock texted about his cases, and how annoying people were being, Mycroft’s latest visit (he’d needed a new crown, Sherlock had crowed), the interesting mold growth in the sink. John offered his analyses (dead wrong), sympathy (pointless), apology (equally pointless), suggestions (I don’t want to get

much about her from John. It was all graceful, effortless charm, in a deep voice like a droll cello. He had flowers, and wine, and thanked John for cooking. Neither of them had said it was John’s doing, but Mary knew enough stories of Sherlock’s observational magic and anyway, it was John’s favourite curry. Which Sherlock surely knew. She realized, in a way she’d always known but had never seemed altogether significant, that Sherlock had spent

real, even when you know it isn’t, a falling-for that isn’t falling-into. Irene desired Sherlock but Sherlock didn’t desire her... or at least, didn’t desire anything more than the spark of understanding, one genius recognizing another, the scientist passing the actress in a hall and finding a bewildering mirror.
Sherlock looks at the patches on his arms, the white squares speckled on his pale skin. Then he rips them off and stands up, in front of John, and looks very suddenly, strangely serious.
“I should have –” John instantly began.
A smile. “Look, if this... if this works out somehow and... ask me this question again, okay? I’ll give you a much better answer.” The smile turned more wolfish, that slight smirk of intrigue and danger, John’s smile, and Sherlock couldn’t help but kiss him. John kissed back, briefly, and then squeezed his hands and got up for his jacket and left.
Sherlock continued a litany of compliments on their décor, of Mary’s glowing health, of her most recent reading choice (left in the parlour couch, which he must have glanced at), until John handed him a wine glass and said, “Cut it

Harry shrugged, carefully ignoring John’s beer. “I’ll live. What’s the emergency?”
He realized the problem, when he dried his face off and padded into the hallway to hear low voices coming from the entrance way; he’d moved too slow and lost the tactical advantage of first strike.

“Which is?”

“You can’t just quit, we let you back in even after –”
He was three when they went to see the bees, but his mother hadn’t seen him in many more years than three and she clutched him so hard he almost cried.

Yeah that.... was not.... nevermind - JW
“Davies? Yes. Sorry about that earlier - working another case. What do you have for me?”
“I would like to talk to you about my husband,” Sherlock said, settling lightly into the parlour chair. It was John’s chair; he could tell by the way the seat was worn, and pillow arranged to brace his back, and the book abdandoned splayed open on the left arm. He watched Mary sink into the couch, hand resting on her abdomen as if she was trying to hold herself down. She was staring at him in open shock. Reconsidering her physical state, he set the water cup on the table in front of her carefully.
C’mon Sherlock - JW
“Leave now,” she called back at them. “I’m going to lose it and I want to do so in privacy.”
She pressed her fingers into her hips, feeling tired, feeling swam in. “There’s obviously something you two know, that you’re keeping from me. I’m not smart enough to figure out what but I’m smart enough to damn well notice. What’s going on?”
He wondered if that is how John felt, staring down that cabbie.
“Well,” he said slowly, “I would normally agree with you. You’re right. You’re totally right. And for any other case... well. What I am about to tell you, Sherlock, is morally wrong and ethically dubious and... Sherlock.

She turned and started up the stairs.
“Yeah I told my counselor about you and she said you had the biggest damn case of codependency she’d ever heard of.”
IS HE HERE?
The eye squints. The blankets and sheets of the mound shift to reveal a mouth. “Who?”
HELLO.
Then, an exhalation of breath next to John. He looks back at Sherlock to find his expression normal, his mouth closed and eyes blinking rapidly. One of Sherlock’s hands finds John’s and gives it a quick and careful pat to get it to stop gripping the front of his robe. John disengages himself with a muttered half-apology, stuffing his hands into his armpits and waiting for his heart rate to settle.
Sherlock snorts again, looking vaguely insulted. “Do you think it isn’t obvious?”
“It’s a possibility,” Sherlock reasons as he fishes on the other side of the bed for a pair of rumpled pyjama bottoms. He pulls them on without leaving the bed, then does the same with a dark blue robe. “Skull for a face, you said? Was there a leather jacket, too? Hell’s something-or-other?”
It takes far longer than it should for a trained soldier to notice him. John patters into the kitchen in pyjamas and slippers, makes a cuppa with what he hopes isn’t the tea that Sherlock has been performing his latest experiments on, and is halfway back to his room when the out-of-place presence registers.
“I’d say it’s the most interesting thing you’ve ever done,” Sherlock replied candidly, leaning back in his armchair.
Sherlock smiles, moving closer and throwing himself into the armchair opposite the stranger. He even scoots it closer, and rests his elbows on his knees like an excited child on their birthday.
,” he snapped.
“Easy, John,” Sherlock says, as close to a helpful bedside manner as John knows him capable of. It’s quite decent, actually, which means something must be really wrong with him.
To his credit and that of British Armed Forces training, John doesn’t drop his tea. He certainly considers throwing the piping hot mug straight at the stranger, though.
“Positive.” Sherlock is only half aware that he’s responding at all, his gaze zeroed in on the man in the armchair with pupils blown wide with curiosity, and -- John can’t be sure, though frankly he isn’t sure of anything at the moment aside from “what” and “the” and “hell” -- the stranger folds the paper down and stares right back.
The stranger steps forward, and John instinctively reaches for a gun at his hip that isn’t there. He flexes his fingers and forces them to rest against the soft material of his pyjama pants. He’s surprised at himself; he’s good in stressful situations, brilliant in them, even. Yet something about this strange visitor acts like a Pied Piper to all of his old demons, pulling them out of those deep places within himself he’d thought them lost in for good. He swallows against a dry tongue and parched throat. His mouth tastes like sand and desert heat, and he swears the stranger is looking more at him than at Sherlock.
PLENTY, the stranger says, and while the tone remains constant reverberating in John’s head, something about it insists that something is being left unsaid. John can’t put his finger on it. Frankly, at the moment he couldn’t put his finger on anything. He knows the eyes of those skulls are looking at him again, and his shoulder begins to ache like he’s carrying some great weight.
I HAVE REIGNED THE OTHER RIDERS TO LONDON. HERE THEY SHALL REMAIN UNTIL I… The sentence peters off into nothing, before regaining itself with force. UNTIL YOU SOLVE THIS MYSTERY, AND I TAKE CARE OF THE CULPRIT MYSELF.
John half hoped there would be no one in the sitting room, but sure enough the skull-faced man is still there. Except now he’s sitting in one of the armchairs, doing the closest approximation of reading the morning paper that something without eyeballs could possibly do.
“And payment,” John adds, because one of them has to. His mind starts to mull over what Sherlock could possibly mean by “simply end there”, but his thoughts are slow to follow one another, getting stuck like boots in quelching bog mud.
. He knows Sherlock’s interest in their visitor has floundered and died, because he leaves the room without a backwards glance, grasping John’s arm and pulling him out along with him. John lets out a sharp breath when he does, as the pain drills deep into the meat of his shoulder. It reverberates around his clavicle all the way through to his shoulder blade. It’s a terribly familiar pain.
Sherlock grumbles and sits up against his headboard, running both hands through his hair.
John comes to stand behind his chair. “ That’s one I haven’t heard in a while.”
“Oh.” John stares at his palm glinting crimson in the early morning light, and keeps on staring. And staring. He blinks once, slowly and deliberately, and tears his eyes away from it up at Sherlock. “We never confirmed payment.”
John inhales deeply and channels his old drill sergeant voice.
The man doesn’t twitch or give a start. Instead, he turns with all the careful care of someone that has just been asked a question that requires them to pull out earbuds. As if he’d known John was there all along and simply been politely ignoring him. He turns, and the face beneath the visor is no face at all. It’s as near a reflection of the skull on the mantelpiece as two skulls could be, down to the sutures and foramina in the yellowed bone.
“Who’re you, then?”
It’s an early morning in their flat like any other, and there’s something not quite right about the third man there.
“No. Yes.”
John shook his head, like this wasn’t necessary. He pressed on.
“This is going to be interesting,” Jack said, on a visit. Then he’d laughed and tussled John’s hair, and was about to give some very awkward advice when the waiter came over and started flirting shamelessly.

John distracted himself with that memory for a few minutes and Sherlock even stirred in his chair, looking up blankly as if sensing something, before returning to the flask before him.

“I think I did well. All things considered.”
And so John hadn’t said anything back. He’d nodded and walked away and hadn’t looked back and it was the right thing and he could still feel something shattering in him and he didn’t look back and this wasn’t goodbye and he should have said goodbye a long time ago.
“You were
This response began a ferocious debate. Sherlock was tenacious when necessary, and especially when completely unnecessary, but John wasn't the type to give up.
“If I can create the damn job I’m certainly quite capable of stopping it.” he snapped.
“About?” he scowled. “I thought we had this discussion yesterday.”
Likely because Sherlock had no basis to compare it with, he seemed to take the moth-to-flame attraction as a natural thing, the fire as deep as breathing burning in him at John’s lightest touch or slightest glance as what everyone went through. “No wonder people are so obsessed with this,” he said, and it would have sounded disgusted if he hadn’t said it breathy, broken, slamming his head back against the wall and burying his fingers into John’s hair.

“No, no he isn’t. But it’s not a matter of strength, we both know that. But maybe that’s John’s problem.” Lestrade shrugged, stared at the blinds in the window so Sherlock could secretly express whatever was boiling through him, whatever was making him wrinkle up the paper,

lying. It was bad form, and unethical, and really very confusing. But if you start with a lie you can only build from there; he made polite evasions, played Sherlock’s essoiner, said he’d been in touch. And John hadn’t. He hadn’t called Sherlock once, because... well, because it was still too hard, and he couldn’t talk to Sherlock because Sherlock would immediately deduce that fact, and...

“Okay. Settle your tab and let’s get out of here. Your moroseness is not helping me not drink.”

Did Sherlock have a crush on Irene? Because, from the outside, that seemed the easiest way to categorize it. That was what he thought, at first, and it would be disproved only to come flaring back. It’s what the phone makes him think. The phone, and the song on the violin, and Sherlock’s mysterious absence from the flat for four days. But it also doesn’t seem quite
“Ah.”
“I’m going to help you keep from scratching. We both know it takes ages to get ink out of your skin, and if your fingertips are red someone might notice. It’s very important for your disguise to be perfect, isn’t it?”

He tried to prove that he’d be a good companion, that it’d be safe.
needs to ask about that, one of these days) but if a fire took them away Sherlock wouldn’t mourn them, the way most people do, for what signifies their existence. His violin is precious and the human skull possibly his pet but he doesn’t keep record of his life. John supposes that it’s not necessary. Normal people do it because otherwise they might forget. Sherlock will either never forget or never regret forgetting. And maybe it’s a good thing, that Sherlock doesn’t need to catalogue each case with stuff. The flat is cramped as it is and it wouldn’t really help, would it, the memento thing, with Donavan’s crazed and repeated insistence that Sherlock is a secret serial killer.
His fingers, exploring the page, kept pausing on numbers, like they were barbed, like they were catching him.

There was no tone of invitation, or refusal to speak, so John plowed ahead. “You see them, then?”

happiness. Because - and this is addiction therapy speaking, but it’s true - because I think you got married because thought it was the right thing to do. Haven’t said it yet but that’s out there now. Right? And you did it because you thought it’d make Mary happy. Now maybe you’re doing this because you think it’d make Sherlock happy. And you have a hard time distinguishing empathetic happiness with your own real happiness. You have to do what’s right for you. Not confuse that with another person.”
About knowing everything, not about his tongue for French. Well. He was right about that too...
“This,” John said, “is…”

“Well… I told you that Sherlock is back.”
That was not true.

John looked absolutely uninterested in taking up anything.

Sherlock’s phone buzzed in his pocket. Inconvenient. But he answered it anyway, as he was obviously not going to be of any help with the crying situation. It was Davies’ number; he rolled his eyes and didn’t wait for him to finish his brisk summary.

to be killed, and a few… a few more that were, out of self-defense or…. Just a few. Most were shot. It is the easiest, cleanest way. It is what John prefers. Other times he must create his own ingenious methods. Some were simple. Some were frantically close to their own death. John forgets what country they are in. Sherlock runs out of languages he understands. When they are not directly on the chase they sleep, a lot, all day and all night, and other times Sherlock cannot sleep no matter what he does and sometimes, after several empty nights, Sherlock will run the shower so he can cry bitterly in private.
"I will resume my mortal form if you don't mind," he says. "Staying in this body for more than a day attracts a nasty sort of sniffling thing. And the milk goes off."
“Be still,” he says.
John finds a place where he can stare at the ceiling fan spinning in the dark. He sees, occasionally, in the news, that Sherlock is still solving crimes. He is alone, but he is back to work. Doing just fine. Recovered. Which is as it should be, it is the goal that John wanted to achieve, keeping Sherlock in the dark so that he could stay in the light. John has won. In his way.
But John couldn’t see the lines, at least, not consistently. He was too wedded to his kindness, to his sense of duty and natural inclination and the indulgence of self-righteousness. Mary could.

He called in Donovan and they made a game of it; she was brilliant at it, way smarter than Sherlock gave her credit for because he’s too busy shouting things to hear her think.

They arrived for their last trip all together. The Meridian, it was written in the notebook. Her next visits were in his past. His future would never behold her again.
The timer goes off.
John wonders if his love for Sherlock is purely platonic. He knows it’s become something....else.... since the pool. Since the moment they learned they would die for each other. Since every moment after when they decide to live for each other, to eat and sleep and get up in the morning and take the other with them when they run down dark alleys. Something deep and soul-knitting. It’s why he puts up with the insults and the severed thumbs and the fact that he can’t keep a girlfriend and that that’s really only fair. It

So sure, their life together had been intoxicating, Sherlock was intoxicating, and under such heady influence (
Jack had been so pleased, but when John had mentioned Sherlock’s name, he’d paused and said, “Really?” and then, “No, no, of course not, that’s silly!” and laughed.
Both men looked at her.
"Oh," John says.
“From a perspective of utilitarian ethics or –”
In the past three years Sherlock had been starved and beaten and bloodied and done things John would have rightfully prevented. He’d had pain applied to him out of fear, or anger, or wilfully, in pleasure; he has returned in equal strength and equal feeling. At some point it just became further weariness. At some point it became background, as in, oh yes, it is 8° today, mildly overcast, I haven’t eaten in four days and my arm is broken. He had always been good at ignoring his body. He just shut it off. External drive. Not important except as back-up. He had wondered if he’d be able to turn it back on. He had wondered how much damage he could take. He had wondered how much damage he could make and not change in the quiet, deep way John did...

Irene, John thinks, was almost as hard to classify. She might be bi (pan, demi, et al - John wonders if there is an “etalsexuality”, and decides, probably) and identify, for whatever personal or political reason, as gay. Which is quite fine; John knows Clara is bisexual but has called herself a lesbian since she was fifteen. Or maybe she’s only attracted to women, and men are just for work, and Sherlock is The Exception.
“No, Sherlock, I’m afraid…”
“Yeah, okay. You’re the best detective here. Whatever.” Lestrade poured two packets of artificial sugar into his mug and stirred it with a pen. “But you’re not
Meeting Mummy had been an interesting experience.
Sherlock grinned, his usual reply slipping easily from his lips, “Have at it then.”
Feeling like only two hours had passed, John awoke  to Mike knocking on the bedroom door. He groaned softly and blinked hard. His eyes felt as if they were coated in sand.

Still smiling John followed Mike into the house. Tomorrow he definitely had to see that tail.

“How’d you know about Drak?” Devaki called after him.
Thank you to Ami for whipping this chapter into shape!
He’d made it halfway across the living room when a long hand on his shoulder stopped him and turned him around. Sherlock had been quiet all the way home, not in his usual post case analysis way, but in a somber manner unusual for him after a case. His face was unreadable as his eyes flicked over John’s face, taking in the cut at his temple and bruising on his jaw.
“The divorce wasn’t your fault, don’t sell yourself short.” Sherlock mumbled distractedly. His mind was whirling as he put together what Lestrade said, along with bits and pieces from the internet and his own ideas.
He growled softly, the hand on his cock speeding up as his other hand pressed harder over his hole. His pleasure began to mount. He slipped just the tip of his finger into himself, and flicked his thumb over the head of his cock.
There first sexual experience happened on the couch, after Moriarty had threatened to blow them up at the pool. It was coincidentally the same night John realized he was in love with Sherlock. It was messy and frantic and absolutely glorious, with Sherlock on top of him and their hands curled around each other’s cocks. Afterward, Sherlock had looked up at him with soft eyes and kissed John long and deep. John had wanted to say it then, but he didn’t want the first time he told Sherlock he loved him to be over shadowed by Moriarty, so he’d kept his mouth shut. It was something he’d regret with all his heart in the months following.
His hand slid around the warm fabric of a sleeve and a choked sound spilled out of John’s mouth.
“Go on in,” Mrs Hudson said, nodding toward the door.
If Sherlock had looked back on his way out, he would have seen John looking up at the balcony, a sly smirk on his face.
He could hear John hot on his heels. Another perk of John’s boxing was that he was faster. Now Sherlock didn’t have to worry about leaving him behind.
For his part Sherlock picked out his nicest casual suit, styled his hair and was somehow waiting on john when it came time to leave.
He needed to talk to Sherlock. He’d make it perfectly clear that this was just to help his friend and that was it. A part of him wished he could call Aashriya and say he’d changed his mind, but he knew he wouldn’t. All he had to do was think of her face as she talked about her girlfriend and he’d remember why he’d agreed to do this.
Sherlock looked over his shoulder and raised his eyebrows.
“Can’t you come like this Sherlock? If I just keep touching you right
The problem was Sherlock didn’t know what to get John. Last year he’d gotten John a dark blue jumper that went well with the colour of John’s eyes. John had loved it and wore it the very next time they went out.
The morose look on John’s face was making him angerier.
Sherlock smirked. “Usually there is more screaming.”
His cane was still neatly propped against a shelf halfway across the store. He’d just walked across uneven floorboards and sat down without any aid.
“Well you see- I mean I see now that it isn’t the best time to-
Sherlock swallowed and tramped down his embarrassment. “I need-
As John hopped over the ropes and went to have his hands untapped, Sherlock backed toward the door. He needed to leave before John caught him. Plus, he felt like he needed some…alone time to processes everything new he’d learned about John. Moving as quietly as possible, he left the building. His mind was whirling with images of him in the place of the Indian boxer, in a decidedly more intimate setting.
John blinked at him.
“John, touch me! please I need-
“He’ll be with you in a moment, dear. What did you say your name was?”
Sherlock looked at him, breathing hard. John’s eyes were dark with hunger. Hunger over
‘My scent’s affecting him too’, John thought as he side-stepped Sherlock and headed into the kitchenette.
John sighed and lay  back, resigned to his faith. He knew it was necessary.If it was anyone else he’d be pushing them into the ambulance himself, but doctors did make the worse patients.
John smiled warmly at him and gave him a deep kiss. “Of course love. Of course. My god you’re beautiful.”
“Hello?” she asked, voice wary.
“Now now Patrick, we promised your mother we wouldn’t be late again.”
Sherlock’s fingers tightened around the mug, his knuckles going white. “It wasn’t safe for you John. I couldn’t risk Moriarty’s people finding out.”
“I’ll just- well I won’t bother you then,” John said, looking disheartened.
Sherlock stopped dead, and turned to John, “What?” he winced at the breathy edge to his voice.
When John Watson was thirty-nine years old he met Sherlock Holmes.
“Who?” Sherlock asked, furrowing his brow in feigned ignorance.
“I never meant-
“Sherlock.” Lestrade called, stopping him.
He was in a boxing ring. The door opened onto a low, shadowed metal balcony with a long flight of stairs leading to an open space below. Over the railing, Sherlock could see a ring in the center of the large room. Thick read and blue ropes framed the square elevated mat. It was a boxing ring, an honest to god boxing ring.
“Thank you,” Devaki said with a smile, finishing her sandwich. “So we’re having a pack get together on Saturday. We try to do them once a month besides the night of the full moon because, well you know, on those nights we aren’t very chatty. Would you like to come? You and Sherlock of course.”
Everything seemed to pause and John contemplated diving into the water after the man. Yet before he could seriously consider it, the man’s head popped back up a little distance away, his gaze wary.
John gave her a twitch of his lips, smiles felt wrong on his face these days. Sighing he headed over to the rows of freshly cut flowers in green buckets set against one wall. He picked a different type every time.
John nodded and relaxed against Sherlock’s chest, taking slow, tiny sips of water.

The faster he did this the faster he could retreat to his room.  He hurriedly placed his hands on John’s shoulders and gave them a squeeze. John winced, pulling away slightly, and Sherlock felt his stomach drop.

“I’m fine John, really.”
“And the day after that.” Kiss.
John smiled tightly back. The mention of the blog stung, he thought enough about Sherlock without Harry bringing him up.
John stood up so fast the table wobbled. He staggered out of the booth and toward Sherlock, arm out stretched. He had to touch, had to know if he was real.
Here was the problem; Sherlock Holmes was completely and irrevocably in love with John Watson, and he had to ask for

“Yeah, I’m coming,” he said, swinging his legs out of bed and grabbing his cane.
John leaned over and rummaged for the lube. Snapping it open, he let his eyes wander down Sherlock’s body.
John squinted at him, Sherlock was leaving something out.
Grinning John stood up, raising his arms over his head in a mock cheer. His opponent hopped to his feet, smiling. He slapped John on the back and offered his congratulations. Clearly being beaten by John was something that had happened to him before, based on his reaction.
“Yeah-um- that book in the display, the ‘Unnatural history’. Can I see it?”
Sherlock grinned as best as he could. John’s baffled, slightly hurt face was bothering him, but not in the way he expected. Instead of making him ache, it was sparking annoyance.
The two of them reached a split in the alley between the two warehouses. A quick glance showed that both looked deserted. They nodded once at each other, before John went right and Sherlock headed left.  The warehouse walls rose up high on either side of him. It was the right wall that concern Sherlock the most, it had for too many windows for his liking. He made it about half way down the alley when suddenly, there was a sharp scraping sound from behind him.

“Come here gorgeous.” John said, beckoning Sherlock over.
“No John. You didn’t- didn’t say I could rut like a- a tart,” he gasped, his blush deepening.
“You. You,” the anger made John choke. “You thought it would have been better to leave me to suffer and grieve for two years. You thought it would be
John stared at him a moment longer, enjoying the way the light reflected off Sherlock’s curls, before turning to stare at the ambulance roof with a sigh.
gone for a walk last night. That part he could be sure really happened. It was the bit about strange snarling men that was fucking him over.
was what made him blush.
John slowly increased the pressure of his lips as Sherlock relaxed against him, his shoulders dropping and hands come up to rest against John’s chest. John hummed against Sherlock’s mouth and slowly licked at the seam of his lips, seeking entry. Sherlock lips parted with a soft sigh, letting John deepen their kiss.
After a few moments of indulgence, John sat up, his face set and hard. He swung his legs over the side of the bed and scrubbed the tears from his face. Grimacing, he slowly stood and hobbled over to the bathroom to get ready for the day, the silver handle of his cane clutched tightly in his hand.
John turned down a side street and Sherlock lingered at the corner, losing himself in the crowd as John opened a metal door and ducked through. This was…odd. the building wasn’t residential, unless it was a club. He waited five minutes before following John through the door, giving the doctor enough time to get well inside the building so he wouldn’t notice Sherlock enter.
“Do you still have the stuffed dragon that used to be on my headboard?”
“Thank you,” John said, eyes on the cover. He swallowed as he noticed a pair of glowing eyes under the water’s surface near the rocks. Clearly they been added in after the picture was taken. Then again, after what happened to John last night, how could he be so sure?
You- you’re my partner.”
Laying kisses all over Sherlock’s chest, until he reached his nipples.
“Just go!” John cried, his eyes starting to sting.
“I love you,” Sherlock said, holding John close.
John blinked back to the present to see Sherlock looking at him in concern. He must be looking pretty terrible since Sherlock had actually noticed.
“How long?” Sherlock whispered.
That last word made Sherlock’s mind grind to a halt. The thought was a new one and caused his stomach to twist. Surly John wasn’t- he’d seemed so- so content with Sherlock and the work over these past few months.
““Love the blog by the way,” Devaki continued. “I looked it up last night.”
He hustled over to the booth as the woman turned to face him, that fondly remembered wicked smile on her face. Her clean, crisp scent washed over him and John was hit with a wave of nostalgia. Aashriya was standing by the time he got to the booth and John found himself being pulled into a hug. She was taller than he remembered, and John found himself having to look up slightly when she pulled back.
“Red and yellow, and yours?”
“Bertram? Yes, he’s still guarding your room,” she said with a little laugh. “Why?”
John smiled back and made his way over to the fence. His first impression was right.
Sherlock felt no such attachment to his own dragon any more, but he knew that John didn’t have many toys growing up. Thus, the attachments to the ones he did have would be strong. It was different to Sherlock’s own upbringing, with a playroom full of toys and people willing to play with him.
“What! What would have happened?” John shouted, his chest heaving, “Molly and Mycroft and so many others knew. Did anything happen to them? DID IT?”
Sherlock stared at the phone, wondering if his cheeks would be permanently red. He should have just gone home and sunk the toy out of his room himself.
Sherlock’s body went still, the way it always did before he took action, and John sat up hurriedly.
“Well I was trying to- you see I was-
Now, after two weeks of not enough sleep and only eating enough to keep going, John was regretting not telling Sherlock to go on without him while he rested. He wasn’t old damn it, he’d gone on longer missions than this in the army and he’d been fine.
“Yes, I did. Something very interesting happened.”
.” Sherlock’s speech got faster and faster. The way it always did when he was desperate to show someone he was right. “I assure you John; you would be much more than an assistant. Without you who would stimulate me? Who would help with the finer aspects of emotion that I’m blind too? Who would point out when a softer approach would gain better results and then execute that approach so flawlessly? Who would be my conductor of light?”
“Good luck.”
Sherlock nodded and John cast about for something to say. He selected and discarded several bits of small talk (why the fuck would a merman want to small talk?) before deciding just to  be up front.
at you.” John growled, “All pink-cheeked and panting over a little kiss.”
Aashriya laughed looking mildly caught out. “It was nice to see you having so much fun and the cases are so inter-
“John Watson. I just moved here.”
Sherlock drank in the sight of him and swallowed hard.
“It bloody freezing, why are you outside?” she called, making her way over.
He couldn’t.
“You let me think you were dead for t- two years and-
“John Watson. I recently moved here.”
“I’ll send it first class mail so it’ll arrive in time for Christmas.” Her tone turned teasing, “Shall I wash it, or do you want John to know what your bedroom smells like?”
‘I wonder why?’ he thought sardonically, then promptly shoved the thought away as he slid into the booth next to Harry. Aashriya shot him a wink as she sat opposite them, and John felt himself smile for the first time in months.
“I could cast a summoning spell, bring the wolves to you. Or Mycroft could use his-
“And after dinner,” John continued, his own voice starting to fade, “I’ll lay you out over my bed and fuck you. How does that sound?” A note of mischief had entered John’s voice.
In the living room Sherlock spun to face John, who’d torn up the stairs behind him. Sherlock strode into John’s personal space and cupped the doctor’s cheeks in his hands. Uncertainty thudded through him, he didn’t have much experience in this area, but god damn it he
John’s words went up an octave as Sherlock obeyed, tightening his lips around John’s cock. John’s eyes fluttered shut as Sherlock swallowed more, going slowly so he wouldn’t gag. He couldn’t fit very much into his mouth and he frowned to himself. He wanted to be able to swallow John to the root, and taste all of him. He huffed and tried to fit more into his mouth, his jaw twinging as he gaged.
After everything they’d been through together; Moriarty, Magnussen,
Devaki nodded and took a bite of her sandwich, “Sorry to eat and chat, but it’s my lunch hour. Yeah, our head is my wife so I mentioned you over dinner. Don’t worry, your boyfriend made a good impression.”
“Hello John.”
With that he ducked through the door and headed out of the store, wondering why Lestrade would be so defensive over a fictional novel…
“Thank you Sherlock,” he said, smiling over his shoulder. “That was wonderful.”
A meeting and an old friend
John really
“No no, don’t mind me. It’s perfectly natural to give your favourite childhood toy to your flatmate. Perfectly platonic.”
He hummed in pleasure around John’s cock, causing the man to gasp raggedly. Feeling inspired, Sherlock did it again and again, all the while keeping up the motions of his tongue, until John was arching above him, his hands tight in Sherlock’s hair. Smirking to himself Sherlock hollowed his cheeks, before pulling back and mouthing over the glands and slit. Swallowing John’s cock again, he began to bob his head, John’s warm hands helping him find a rhythm.
“Did I say you could rut into the bed like a little tart?” John growled, his lips now less than inch from Sherlock’s ear.
. The warmth of the room was getting to him. He hurriedly yanked off his suit jacket and pulled off his shoes and socks. Now, John would have the pleasure of undressing him, but he wouldn’t over heat.
“Hell yeah! Let’s do it!”
“I said, it was the grandmother’s friend. It all links back to her.”
He’d gotten the chicken seasoned and in the oven just fine, only to find out half an hour later that something must have been wrong with the temperature gauge, as the chicken was now burned rather than golden brown. While the chicken had been secretly burning, he’d chopped up things for a salad as the pasta cooked. Then he’d tried to make salad dressing, only to find out they were out of olive oil. Sherlock had gone down and borrowed some form Mrs. Hudson. Unfortunately, whatever brand she used didn’t agree with the other ingredients and the bloody dressing just wouldn’t come together.  During his furious whisking, he’d smelt the chicken burning and to his horror realized that the star of his meal was ruined.
Calling for John to follow he made his way into the house, intending to search the little girl’s room, the thrill of the chase pumping through him. The room was what he’d expected, pale pink walls, tiny bed, bookshelf of inane children’s books. This would give him nothing, the house was scrubbed clean of any evidence of Victor, Mrs. Argos had seen to that. He needed to see the man’s flat.
A humorless chuckle left John lips, “I was here celebrating our anniversary you fuck, but thanks for that Sherlock. Thanks so much.”
“Yeah that’s nice. Real nice, Sherlock keep going!” John said with and ugly laugh. “What do you expect me to think? I spent all this time thinking I mattered. Now I see how wron-
A part of John hated what he was doing. Sherlock was back, he was
“Of course,” Sherlock said, settling himself and reaching for the remote. “I’ll catch up on the news while you change.”
“Thank you,” John said.
“I guess you remember each other,” Harry said, sounding amused.
of a cup being set on the coffee table for Sherlock, footsteps, and the soft click of John opening his laptop.
As Sherlock’s pacing brought him close John stretched out and snagged the detective’s hand, pulling him to a halt.
He blinked hard in confusion. Something scratchy was rubbing against his cheek and it was far far too bright to be Baker Street.
When John’s tongue finally breached his entrance, and began to slowly slide in and out of him, Sherlock snapped.
John focused on his breathing, trying to calm down and dimly aware of Angelo guiding the other diners back to their seats.
Sherlock nodded, giving John a tiny smile as he headed for the bathroom. John’s voice stopped him.
John took a deep breath, stealing himself for whatever he was about to say, “Is everything ok? With him I mean?”
“Ash and I ran into each other at the shops the other day and got to talking. She follows the blog you know,” Harry said, grinning at John.
“This arse has been driving me mad since the day we met. Did you know that?” John said, as he mouthed over said arse. Sherlock let out a strangled sound and shook his head, wiggling slightly to rub his cock against the sheets.
He finally saw her again on his first day back at school. Apparently, Aashriya was not only in his year, but in his class as well. He saw her standing there that first day, looking awkward and very nervous as she took in her new surroundings. She spotted him and gave him that same tentative smile she had the first time they met, and John found himself walking over to say hello.
them,” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes. “I have a gentler touch than that. It would just
Sherlock exhaled slowly and opened his eyes. John sounded curious, which was a good sign.
John, with a kiss and his words alone.
John’s face was practically glowing as Devaki wrote down her address for them and the date and time of the meeting.
Early morning light was sliding into his room through a crack in the curtains. He stretched lazily, enjoying the endorphins running through him and trying to tramp down on his guilt. It was
He stopped abruptly, realizing he was dangerously close to saying something he wasn’t ready to admit. Sherlock peeked cautiously at John, and was relieved to see the man was smiling at him, his eyes very soft.
John ripped his hands out of Sherlock’s and shoved Sherlock out of his space. He stalked over to Angelo’s desk chair, sinking slowly into the seat as he tried to process everything.
Sherlock stared at him, his mind whirling and adrenalin surging through him. He tightened his arms around John’s shoulders and nodded, tipping his head down so John could reach.
Something flickered over Lestrade’s face, but was gone in a moment.
Soon, John was letting out a continuous string of moans as Sherlock worked him over with his tongue and hands. He found the pressure that John loved the most and was using it to his advantage, one hand stroking John’s shaft, while the other rolled and caressed John’s balls.
“If you would show me your daughter’s bedroom, I can begin my investigation,” he said, tucking his idea safely away in his mind palace and turning his attention back to case.
“You actually introduced yourself!”
“Ah, right. Wouldn’t want the neighbours to hear him shouting about car bombs.”
“Yes yes. I couldn't think of a way to get out of it," he said with a sly smile. It would look odd if he was too enthusiastic over something John knew he detested.
His mind was on fire, trying to categorize everything. The shape and texture of John’s lips. The taste of his mouth, the- John’s tongue slid lightly over the seam of his lips and Sherlock’s thoughts scattered.
“What are you?” John whispered without thinking.
“There’s my office in the back if you’d like privacy,” Angelo said quietly.
Well that's all folks! Thank you to everyone who read and enjoyed this story, and left kudos and comments! It meant the world to me!
“Can you give me more details?” he asked, resigning himself to his fate.
John learns more about Greg's past. He and Sherlock have an adventure, plus a strange new person shows up in town.
Soon, numbers were exchanged and Sherlock was ready to head back to Baker Street and give John the good news.
“Three of the white please,” he said, flicking his eyes to Lynn.
Ajay sighed and scrubbed a hand through his short buzz of hair. “Right to the case then, fine.” he held out his half empty tea cup, “ I’ll need something a little stronger for that.”
his rescue with a few things altered for his pleasure.
That night John dreamed of Sherlock again. Although, did it really count as a dream if it actually happened?
After, his belly warm from more than just the pasta, John caught his wrist gently as they left the restaurant. Sherlock turned to him, heart beating double time at the warmth of John’s hand on the thin skin of his wrist.
A cab rounding the corner caught his eye and he waved his arm to get its attention, not noticing the disappointed look on John’s face as he did. He couldn’t risk it. He wouldn’t.
“She's fine.” John kept his eyes on his cup, his brow furrowed. “She’s off at a nurses’ conference in Dublin.”
Sherlock barely suppressed an eye roll. That fiasco with Janine had been one of his stupider plots. It had also convinced John that Sherlock could and would only show romantic interest for a case. His annoyance grew at the thought.
John rolled his eyes and turned his attention back to the screen.
“Are you alright John?” Sherlock asked quietly, their eyes meeting.
John grinned at him and pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s nose. “Nap it is then.”
one. Watson men were alphas through and through, not nacy-boys, or at least that was his dad always started ranting about when he saw an omega actor on the telly, or got a wiff of one in the shops. Those times John would duck his head in shame, cheeks red as he wished he had the courage to stand up to his father, to say he didn’t see why omega and alpha men should be treated any differently.
A man in a referee shirt stepped between them and raised a whistle to his lips. Sherlock felt his anticipation grow. He stepped closer to the edge of the balcony and gripped the railing, his breath coming in sharp puffs. The ref blew sharply on the whistle and the match began.
Usually, these sounds were soothing to Sherlock. They helped ground him as he sifted through his mind palace and made him feel safe enough to go deep. After the incident on the plane, it had taken him months to feel safe enough to enter such a deep level of his mind again. Even now, months later, still only did so when John was home (not that the doctor knew that). Today, instead of being soothing, the sounds put him on edge. He needed John to make the tea and sit at his laptop so he could
“Oh, you seemed to be mourning just fine on your date.” Sherlock spat after him, venom in his voice.
“I’m fine John. The end of the case was just…difficult.”
It was the soft sincerity of the thank you that did it. Sherlock leaned forward, only a little John was so close, and kissed John softly on the lips.
There was one thing that was bothering Sherlock though, and had been for some time now. He had tried to ignore it, to rationalize it away, but that was proving to be less and less effective as time passed.
The two of them stood frozen under the street lamp, eyes locked. They were standing so close that John’s chest brushed Sherlock’s with every exhale. Sherlock felt the words bubbling with in him again. From the look on John’s face he was eighty-five percent certain they’d be well received. Still. It was a fifteen percent chance he wasn’t willing to take.
, and now he was-
I tired to insert the image but it was too large.
“Yeah, sorry. What was that?” he said, pushing away from the wall and approaching the whiteboard Sherlock stood in front of.
What did John want, a detailed account of his and ‘Patrick’s’ relationship? It wasn’t as if he’d gotten that when John started seeing Mary. Thank God.
“I’m sorry I bothered you,” John said, getting to his feet and turning toward the door. “Your dad was a good writer. I enjoyed the book.”
Devaki smiled, clearly impressed. “Your right!”
The case had dragged on for two long weeks. It wasn’t supposed to, Sherlock had insisted that he’d have it wrapped up in three days at most. Then the sister turned out to have a secret lover, who turned out to be a suspect, who then went to his mother-in-law who then went to her best friend and then- and then- and then John had just stopped paying attention.
“Do you have a pack, Devaki?” Sherlock decided to cut to the chase.
Thank you to
John smirked at him and headed into the kitchen.
John turned to face in Sherlock’s direction, his hands
When he pushed through the door, his brow furrowed in confusion. This was not what he had thought
The waitress set their drinks and Devaki’s lunch down, interrupting her. After their drinks were set down and they all assured the waitress they were fine they were left alone again. Sherlock glanced around them and cast a quick privacy spell. The last thing they needed was anyone over hearing a conversation about werewolves.
“Got it on one, clever boy.”
in the loop, but not me! I thought I mattered more than that!”
Sherlock tapped the file impatiently against his thigh as he watched Greg Lestrade talk on the phone. Technically he could have left after he’d given his statement, but he had something important to ask Lestrade, if the man would get off the bloody phone.
for one and half to two hours, and then come home sweaty and pink cheeked.
. Everything he’d been feeling for John was looking right back at him from John’s warm, smiling eyes.
Sherlock smiled back, exhilaration flowing through him. “If you think that’s best John. I-
“Thank you so much John,” she said, her voice sounding choked, “I know it can’t be easy, but thank you so
“Not here Sherlock.” John snapped, limping off to Angelo’s office.
“It was too dangerous. If Moriarty’s people-
. Again…Sherlock wasn’t going to look too deeply into why that was.
Mashing his lips into a thin line, he surveyed the flowers. There was everything from carnations, to roses. The white roses caught his eye. They were lush and full, and looked pretty fresh. The price wasn’t the best though.
“Your welcome, John.”
“It’s wonderful, thank you,” Sherlock said, giving Ajay a soft smile.
“Indeed,” Sherlock said with a grin.
He wondered what it would feel like to have John lick slowly over the taught skin of his belly when he was like this, shaking with stimulation. Sherlock shoved the thought out of his mind, he didn’t have time for another go right know. He’d have to indulge that other fantasy later…alone in bed… He shook his head and took some deep breathes, John was probably waiting for him to finish shower. When he had calmed a little, he pushed his sopping wet hair out his face and gathered some water in his hands to splash the come off the wall.
“John? John did you hear me?”
“You want him to join our pack?” she asked, scepticism clear in her voice.
“Can’t come in you yet love. D-don’t want you to choke,” he gasped.
Sherlock looked up at him in shock as John pulled him closer.
John wordlessly pointed to the door, fighting to keep his emotions in check until Sherlock left. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Sherlock’s nose twitch at the distress colouring John’s scent. That was rare, alphas could only smell distress if the impending crisis was going to be massive in an omega. He saw Sherlock make an abortive gesture to reach out to him, then turn and head for the door.
John dropped his cup and sat  straight up, heart in his throat. The thud came again, higher up on the wall of the porch, as if something were trying to scale it. John pinched himself hard on the thigh, pain bloomed and he felt a strange sense of relief. Definitely awake this time.
“Sleep Sherlock,” John said softly, pulling him close.
He turned and began unbuttoning his shirt as he headed for the bathroom. Sherlock got a glimpse of John’s shoulder muscles flexing as he shrugged the shirt off his shoulders, before he turned down the corridor and disappeared from view.
Soon he was on top of her on the couch as her hands unbuttoned his shirt. He buried his nose in her scent glad, inhaling the clean crisp smell, and nuzzling the skin as he felt her own nose against his neck.
Five days later and John was still ignoring Sherlock’s texts. That didn’t seem to stop Sherlock, or even give him pause. Everyday John would wake up to row of messages sent from absurd hours of the morning, and then throughout the day. John wondered when the detective was sleeping.
As Sherlock swept passed him to get to his bedroom, John gently caught his wrist.
Wincing at the thought, John pushed open the door and let Angelo’s overly cheerful greeting wash over him. He would have been expecting John, no doubt. John only ever came to Angelo’s for one reason anymore; to celebrate his anniversary with a dead man.
Sherlock kept his eyes on John’s face, taking in the shock and confusion.
single moment. There were still times when they fought, and grated against each other’s nerves, but those moments didn’t even come close to the sheer
Sherlock pressed his lips together and stood up. He followed John into the kitchen where he was rummaging in the fridge. Quietly padding up behind John, he leaned over the man’s shoulder to snag the milk. The move brought his body right up behind John, until Sherlock’s chin brushed through John’s hair. John jumped slightly, then threw Sherlock a smile, his eyes still dancing from-
“Not here Sherlock. I don’t want my first kiss with you to be in a dank alley, with this piece of filth as a witness.”
He picked the Union Jack pillow off the floor, plumped it up and tucked it onto John’s chair. The room was beginning to get that ‘closed up’ smell, so he opened the windows. Sherlock was folding the throw over the back of the couch when he realized he was
Lestrade’s expression didn’t change, “Is that all, Mr Watson? I really am very busy.” If his voice was any colder John was sure the sea outside the window would turn to ice. John realized he was done, there was nothing else to say to Lestrade.
He was in love with John, and since he couldn’t say it sentiment would have to do for now.
“I-I’m gonna go know Sherlock. Today’s a bad day and I need to be at the surgery later. I’ll be back next week.”
“And that mouth,” John continued, dragging a thumb along Sherlock’s plush lower lip. “This mouth has had me hooked for
“Well,” John looked so hopeful Sherlock’s stomach ached, “I supposed if I meet with- did you get her name?”
Not trusting his voice, Sherlock nodded and strode over. He still had his gloves on, so it’s not like he’d be touching John’s bare (
Aashriya nodded, taking a sip of her coffee. “Yup, he finally pulled his head out of his arse and decided what he wanted to do. Turns out he’s a remarkable chef.”
After fighting so hard to get back to this point, to their peculiar brand of normalcy with murder and chases and crime scenes, he was terrified of upsetting the balance. Of ruining what he ached for since he’d come back from the dead and found everything so horribly, awfully different. Now, he had what he wanted and he quaked at the thought of losing it again.
Leaning forward, Sherlock pressed a kiss to the tip, enjoying John’s sharp inhale. He knew how to give head in theory, he was inexperienced not naïve, and was determined to please John.  So far, so good it seemed. Looking up at John through his lashes, he flicked his tongue over the slit, licking off the pre-come that had gathered there. John’s mouth dropped open in pleasure, his hands fisting in the blankets on either side of his thighs.
That did it. With a ragged cry, John tossed his head back and came. Sherlock let out a moan as John’s hot come splashed over his chest and chin, painting him. He kept up the motions of his hand as John shuddered through the aftershocks. With a groan John slumped forward, peeling open his eyes and gazing softly at Sherlock.
In a series of contradictions his cock was hard and he was crying. He rolled onto his back, ignoring his situation and jammed a knuckle into his mouth to stop the sobs.
“You have to admit; you hate leaving the cases for your shifts.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes further, the wrinkles on his brow deepening. He opened his mouth to answer then shut it with a huff, before turning away to stare down at his shoes. His hand tightened around John’s.
John waved as it pulled away, and turned to head for the tube station. Night had fallen while they’d been in the café and there was a chill in the air as he walked away. He zipped up his jacket, stuffing his hands in his pockets, contemplating what he had to do.
Sherlock whined and shook his head, shaking. He needed
“The polished shoes, the product in your hair, the careful shave. It’s as plain as day John,” Sherlock sneered.
“I wanted to foster an introduction.”
He gave John a kiss.
“Dinner?” Sherlock asked raising his eyebrows.
“I have an old friend of yours who needs some help.” Harry cut in, clearly getting annoyed with his mumbling.
The streets of London bustled around Sherlock as he walked down the pavement with John at his side. The Christmas decorations that once seemed gaudy and overdone now seemed to reflect his jubilation. Another challenging case was solved, Lestrade and, more importantly, John had been impressed by him. He glanced at the man in question next to him and smiled. It had been a truly delightful day. So much so that Sherlock was actually looking forward to eating dinner when they got home.
Sherlock grumbled and didn’t move.
The time stamps on the texts made him pause when he saw they’d been sent in the wee hours of the morning.  ‘The git wasn’t sleeping’, John thought, quickly followed by ‘he made me mourn for two years, let him lose a little sleep’.
“I see,” his mother said, sounding smug.
Aashriya’s voice faltered and she glared hard at the table. This time it was John who found himself reaching across the table to wrap his hand around hers.
“She seemed genuinely interested,” Sherlock went on, “At least meet her one on one to feel things out.”
Being an omega in the army wasn’t easy to the say the least. He was put on military grade suppressants, which stopped his heats, and masked most of his scent. They didn’t cover it totally though, which lead to posturing alpha’s eager to show the omega ‘their place’. That didn’t last very long once John had kicked the biggest alpha’s arse with ease.
John giggled at the kisses raining down on his lips and pulled Sherlock into hug, his chest warm.
John smiled at him, his thumbs stroking over the back of Sherlock’s hands. He turned away, obviously heading for the drawer where they kept the takeout menus, before he turned back to Sherlock. He hesitated for the tiniest moment, before his rose onto tip toes and gave Sherlock another kiss.
John’s leg bounced against the seat until Sherlock slid his hand over it. Even then the joint jumped under Sherlock’s palm as they turned down the street to Devaki’s house. Giving John’s knee a comforting squeeze, Sherlock paid the cabbie and they headed up the walk, a warm breeze lifting the hem of Sherlock’s coat. John swallowed and pressed the bell, then promptly stuffed his hands into his pockets, rocking on his heels.
, no scenting,” John said, keeping his voice level, and ignoring the ache within him.
“Did he hit you?” John asked, his words were calm, but Sherlock could hear the steel underneath. He knew that if Minchel had hurt him in any way he’d be leaving the alley worse for the wear.
The door banged open and Greg barreled in, panting hard. “She bought a plane ticket!”
The night, after forcing down some dinner with Mike, John sat on the porch and watched the waves slap against the wall in front of him. The day had been shit. After embarrassing himself in front of the harbormaster, John had hobbled around town aimlessly until his leg was screaming in pain. He’d been forced to sit down on a questionably stained bench and ask Mike to pick him up there when his shift was over. Now here he sat, staring into the ocean and trying to count the pinpricks of ships’ lights in the distance.
Sherlock turned to look at John. The doctor was giving him a concerned look. The same look he’d given Sherlock on the plane after he’d over dosed.
“My shoulder muscles are a little sore Sherlock. Can you help me?”
“Oh really! Because-
“Oh that’s it,” John groaned, “That’s lovely.”
“Keystroke monitor and tracker,” Ajay said around a mouthful of chocolate biscuit. He swallowed laboriously,  “I thought it’d be smart to  keep an eye on the doctor.”
“I’m in the editorial department at Vogue.”
Sherlock nodded and walked away, hearing John follow. The blue and red lights of the police cars painted the scene around them, reflecting off the puddles on the road. As he passed one car in particular shouting came from within, along with the sound of a body hitting the door repeatedly. Spearing a glance at the window, Sherlock saw the man he’d just proved a murder spitting curses at him through the glass, his face red and twisted in rage.
Sighing, Sherlock set his phone on the night stand and stared at the wall. He knew perfectly well why he was willingly subjecting himself to his mother’s teasing. The feelings he had for John had been deepening and deepening since he’d jumped off that roof. They had been there before of course; one didn’t jump of a roof for just a friend. But Sherlock had only admitted to what it was when his toes were curled over the roof’s edge, Moriarty’s body cooling behind him.
“Are you a merman?”
John settled down with another present, leaning against Sherlock’s side and smiling when Sherlock wrapped an arm around his shoulders. The world hadn’t stopped turning, Baker Street hadn’t exploded. John loved him everything was both the same and beautifully different.
One year later and John found himself on a couch with Aashriya, alone in her house, snogging hurriedly as one of his hands slowly slid up her skirt. He and Aashriya had grown steadily closer as the months passed. She had the wicked smile and a black sense of humor that John always found attractive, and her house had turned into a haven of sorts.
Things get stranger...
A great big thank you to 221BeStillMyHeart for being an awesome beta reader, and thank you to every one who's enjoying the story so far! :)
“John!”
comparing his friend to his ex-boyfriend. She and Sherlock were different, totally and
John grumbled in reply, his throat was parched and his head throbbed. A water bottle appeared in his field of vision, clutched in Sherlock’s huge hand. John could only blink stupidly at his own legs stretched out before him as Sherlock tipped the bottle against his lips.
“Have you ever done this before, Sherlock?” John asked, his hands tangled in Sherlock’s hair.
Sherlock whimpered, both at the praise and at the fact that John was sucking a bruise into the skin over his collar bone. The whimper soon turned into a moan as John sucked the thin skin between his teeth, and nibbled at it.
The confession brought relief rather than fear. What ever happened now John would never regret saying this to Sherlock.
John felt his eyes widen in horror.
Sherlock smiled at John across the breakfast table. Breakfast was half eaten around them and the news was talking quietly in the background, none of them really listening to it. Any other morning Sherlock would have been itching to finish breakfast and start on an experiment, or check the website for a case. The morning of a full moon night was different though. John was always tense the day of the full moon, and although he never said, Sherlock knew John appreciated when he stayed close.
An innumerable amount of time later, he looked up at the stone. The gold letters glinted in the light and the white roses stood out starkly against the black stone. John scrubbed the tears form his face and took a deep breath, pressing his face hard against his palms.
The shower shut off and Sherlock jumped. There was soft shuffling from the other side of the glass door, then John’s silhouette grew larger and larger as he approached. When he stepped through Sherlock’s breath caught.
He walked around John, and stood behind him, taking in the view of
John huffed as he limped into Angelo’s. It was sentiment of the lowest order, but John was a sentimental man. That was the only way to explain why he’d come to Angelo’s today, unless he just enjoyed torturing himself. Sherlock would scoff at it for sure, him coming to this restaurant on this day, but Sherlock wasn’t here, so what did it matter.
Together they sat on the floor by the tree and reached for a present each.
Sherlock dodged left, causing Minchel to blow past him. The man skidded to a stop and spun around, swinging the pipe hard. Sherlock was ready for him. He grabbed the pipe and yanked, pulling Minchel toward him as he swung his other fist backward for a punch.
“Dr Watson,” he said, “I’m Nathan, how you feeling?”
Sherlock practically flew up the stairs to the living room, his body thrumming with anticipation. The cab ride home had been an exercise in restraint. John had sat closer to him than he ever had before, his warm, firm thigh pressed against Sherlock’s.
John stared at him, his mind whirling with Sherlock’s words. “I-I was your weakness,” he murmured, his voice hollow. The words made him feel sick to his stomach.
“Are you free?” Harry asked, before it could get too awkward.
“Your gloves are too cold, take them off.” John said, rolling his shoulders again.
Aashriya was the polar opposite of the two alphas he knew best, the two who’d shaped his entire world view. She was kind and considerate, where his father and Harry were mean spirted and brutish. She never ever used her secondary gender as a reason behind her actions, whereas Harry and his father’s favourite refrain was ‘it’s the instincts Johnny, you know I can’t help it’. Soon John found himself questioning everything he’d learned about alphas from his sister and father.
“Alright love?” John asked, crouched between Sherlock’s thighs. His eyes were filled with concern as he gently stroked a lock of sweaty hair off Sherlock’s forehead.
“That should be fairly obvious, John,” he said, sitting up and swallowing hard.
In an instant John’s laughter died and he swallowed hard. Each tooth was a slender spike, a touch longer than a human’s tooth, and shone pearl white in the moonlight. John’s hands tightened on the railing as his hindbrain screamed at him to run from the predator in front of him.
clients. They didn’t need John’s pay cheque to pay the bills, and going by the look on John’s face, John liked leaving Sher-
He must have made some sort of noise. It was testament to just how distracting John was that Sherlock didn’t notice the sound leaving his mouth. The doctor turned to him and smiled, not stopping the up and down movement of his body. Sherlock tried his best to smile back as naturally as possible. Whatever contortion his face did must have been amusing, as John’s smile suddenly turned smug.
“I’m looking forward to that, love. You just go lie back and relax.”
Taking a deep gulp of coffee, he flipped open the book and started reading. The first chapter was nothing but a history of the town. A few pages in, John skipped ahead to L.G.’s first supposed encounter with the ‘people of the deep’.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
“I-um- I heard what happened John,” Aashriya started hesitantly, cutting into his thoughts, “I’m so sorry that you were put through that.”
There was a loud splash and he was gone.
John shook her hand over the counter and smiled.
“Beside drawer,” Sherlock said, running his hands up John’s sides, and taking deep breathes.
“You told Molly and Mycroft and the fucking homeless, but not me! What was it? Is it because I’m omega? Hum, think the delicate little omega can’t protect himself? Is that it?” John shouted, panting with rage.
“You’ll freeze your arse off if you stay like this.” John said, a smile evident in his voice.
In the past, Sherlock would have had no qualms about using the pathologist’s attraction to get what he wanted. Today, he found that he couldn’t. Not because he was incapable of flirting, he very much was. It just didn’t feel right. Not in terms of his morals, those stopped him from flirting with Molly, but everyone else was still free reign. It just felt like a betrayal somehow, which made no sense since there was no one to betray. Oh who was he kidding of course there was. He knew exactly who it was but-
close.
He let out a breath as his eyes traveled down the groove of John’s spine to the dips of his lower back and back up again. His face felt far too hot, and he suddenly became aware of just how the silk of his shirt clung to his body. God, he was done for.
“Are you feeling better John?” he asked quietly.
A particularly hard suck to his nipple cut him off.
Ajay raised his eyebrows as Sherlock slammed the glasses onto the table and poured them each a generous shot.
He wanted John. He
“We make enough from the cases, so you don’t need your job at the clinic. You could quit and work with me full time, then there would be no need to worry about
Sherlock felt his cheeks heat, but John simply kissed him again and rolled onto his side, pulling Sherlock with him. They exchanged lazy kisses and Sherlock felt himself melt further and further into the mattress. The exhaustion from the case and the exhilaration of the sex blended together into a warm sort of sleepiness.
Thank you to Lynn for being an awesome beta!
“Not good?” Sherlock said, smiling a little giddily.
“Come here you gorgeous thing.” John said, taking one of his hands and pulling him close. Sherlock went eagerly, falling to his knees between John’s thighs and peering up at him.
Thank you to Ami for her amazing beta skills!
“I love seeing you smile like this,” John said, stroking Sherlock’s neck.
“It’s okay Sherlock,” John said, patting his knee. “It’s better than getting taken out of here on a stretcher.”
John crossed his arms in front of his chest, taking a deep breath. The anger put everything into sharp focus, smothering the panic that his dead alpha was standing in front of him. He nodded once, his jaw tight with rage. Sherlock looked at him desperately for a moment, before striding over and taking John’s hands. He inhaled deeply and his shoulders sagged with relief as John’s scent hit him.
Twenty minutes later he was in the car with Mike heading towards town. The scenery was beautiful he had to admit, but his rough night wouldn’t let him focus. Soon Mike rounded a corner and the buildings of the little town came into view. John sat up straight in his seat and stretched.
“Did you enjoy the show?”
“Take care of him for me out there?”
he had foolishly believed that he and John would finally get their time together. That they would finally be able to let the feelings between them grow and bloom, until they were ready to address it.
John’s head snapped up and he swallowed hard.
“No, it didn’t. Molly is fine. Mycroft is fine. Only I had to mourn you for two years.” he stalked towards the door, needing to get out of here.
“I think I’ll manage,” John said, throwing open the car door.
The harbourmaster turned out  to be a grey haired, lively looking man seated behind a cluttered desk. The single window in his office gave John a view of the docks and cast a blurry grey light through the room.
“I might have had some help,” Sherlock said, smiling cheekily.
Devaki nodded, “Feel free to give John my number if he wants to talk to me directly.”
A snarky reply was on the tip of John’s tongue, but he smothered it. He’d dealt with enough surly patients in his day. Plus pissing the medic off would take energy, an energy John didn’t have.
“Just come alright? It’s a friend from secondary and I don’t want to spoil the surprise.”
“John! Sherlock!” she said, giving them a warm smile. She held the door wide and invited them inside. “Did you find us okay?”
“I love you.”
Sherlock could hear the smile in John’s voice and fought to keep his face neutral. He was supposed to be in his mind palace after all. Lately, it had become harder and harder to ignore John when he was trying to think.
Luck was with him for once. As Finn ran past the duty-free shop she crashed right into a woman laden with packages. The bags flew everywhere, the woman swore and Finn went down hard.
“God, you perfect, sexy man. Come
Sherlock winked and headed for the bedroom. John’s wolfy side had some
John’s voice cut into his inner doubt. The doctor was looking at him with concern. Sherlock swallowed hard, and stared at John, analyzing. His hands slide to the doctor’s shoulders and gave them a squeeze. It was time to put all the years of doubt behind him and be brave.
Sherlock didn’t seem to be fearing any better. His nostrils were flared wide, and he was focused on John with that laser precision that made something swoop low in John’s belly. He’d forgotten how potent that look was. Control, he had to stay in control. He locked his knees and gestured for Sherlock to enter the flat.
“Don’t go!”
. What happened in the privacy of his own mind was harmless, John would never know, it was
“I’m getting ready for work, if you want to come into town,” Mike said, sticking his head around the door.
Sherlock lay on the couch in his customary thinking pose when he heard the door to 221 slam shut and John’s quick footsteps on the stairs. That was a good sign, it meant he’d had a descent day at work and would be more open to his suggestion.  He shut his eyes and quickly steepled his fingers under his chin as the door to 221b opened. John strode through, smelling like the rain drops that fell off his coat as he hung it up.
“Alright love?” John asked, their noses brushing.
Slowly the world righted itself and his breathing eased somewhat. John buried his face in his hands and curled over himself. The beige room was silent save for the soft sobbing coming from the huddled figure on the bed.
“God, just
Ajay turned to Sherlock with a sneaky smile, “Yes, we wanted to keep things quiet at first. Given his fame and all.”
“Hey Sherlock,” John said with a yawn, stretching his arms overhead. “Had a good walk?”
“Holy fuck.”
Sherlock shivered hard at that thought. He’d never gone to bed with anyone else He’d never met anyone he trusted enough to expose himself too, but this was John, and Sherlock found himself
“We have all the time in the world now,” John said.
Glancing over his shoulder he saw the car slowly tailing after him. John gave Mycroft the one finger salute over his shoulder and kept walking, his cane thudding loudly on the pavement with each step.
John felt his eyebrows climb high on his forehead, get to point indeed.
“I-I’m sorry John. I didn’t mean to- I” Sherlock took a deep breath and squared his shoulders, before looking up at John. “Good night John,” he said, his shoulders stiff and eyes sad.
“Well,” Harry said in a break during the conversation, “Did you ask him yet?”
“J-John,” Sherlock gasped.
“But-
This year a jumper didn’t feel like the right choice…nothing did. Not shoes, books, clothes. It would make John uncomfortable if he spent too much money, so jewellery was out. Still, the gift needed to be
“Hey Sherlock,” John said, smiling, “Expecting someone else?”
Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad, he reasoned, as he stole glances at John while pretending to work at his microscope. The look in John’s eyes outside the restaurant had given him that little boost, along with a million other little signs that indicated John was feeling the tension too.
He was shaking his head at himself when the door swung open.
Sherlock jumped when warm fingers curled under his chin and tipped his face up, bringing him face to face with John.
The case faded into the back of his mind as he slid the shirt off his shoulders, imaging John laying kisses across his chest. He hurriedly tore off his trousers and pants and stepped into the shower, letting the warmth engulf him. Turning his thoughts to John, he imaged the smaller man kissing his way down Sherlock’s neck and licking over one of his nipples. Sherlock tipped his head back under the spray and let his own hands glide down his neck and over his slick chest. His thumbs brushed lightly over his nipples and he sighed softly, the sound lost in the noise of the water. He circled the nubs harder and pinched them, all the while imaging smaller, darker hands in place of his own.
Sherlock was panting by the end of his tirade, his eyes bright. “Now do you see why? It’s not because you are an omega,” Sherlock sneered, twisting away from John and pacing in a circle, “You’re the chink in the armor, the one thing I couldn’t let Moriarty’s web touch.”
He’d always thought of him and Sherlock as equals, that they kept each other right, supported each other. He’d thought of himself as an asset to the work, not a weakness. He had thought Sherlock didn’t tell him because he wanted to work alone, or play it close to the chest. The truth was much harder to swallow; he hadn’t told John because John was a weakness, a hindrance to the work.
“Reserved parking, very nice,” John told Mike, mustering up a smile as Mike pulled up in front of the clinic.
Mike vanished down the hall as John stood up. The handle of his cane was rough with sand and bits of grit fell from the wood with each step John took. So he
“Ah so this is John!” Ajay thrilled, moving forward for a handshake. “I love your blog!”
“Thank you, Sherlock. Really.”
“Are you alright John?”
. You’re always nibbling on it you know? Now
Ajay sighed through his nose and took a more modest sip.
John smiled and leaned in for another kiss. It was a rare person who could see that smile on Sherlock Holmes’ face and not want to kiss it off. Shame the option only belonged to John now.
This close Sherlock’s scent was overwhelming. John could see how gaunt Sherlock looked, the dark circles under his eyes. John tore his gaze away from the detective’s, staring into the middle distance over his shoulder.
By the time Sherlock knocked on the warped door of his room, John was showered and dressed; the thick jumper and jeans felt like battle armor. Just as John put the kettle on, there was a rap at the door. Into battle then. Swallowing hard he opened the door to reveal the tall, imposing figure of the detective.
The man gave him odd look, and then he was swimming closer, those odd eyes fixed on John. The colour of his eyes was oddly fractured, like a stained glass window of an old church. John blinked at him a moment. The man moved like nothing human.
“Ignore that!” Sherlock barked, voice harsher than he meant it. “Pretend I never said it.”
A huge Hindu temple came into view, carved white stone glowing against the bright summer sun. A well-manicured garden circled the building and a large crowd of people were gathered together, dressed for a Hindu wedding. Clearly the wedding had just finished given the general jubilation of the scene and the dancing taking place. Slowing his pace as much as he could without looking creepy, Sherlock soon spotted the bride, dressing in red and gold and smiling wide as she danced. That wasn’t who the spell was pointing him towards though. He shut his eyes and let the magic get stronger. When he opened them his eyes immediately landed on a woman dressed in dark blue sari. She was already looking at him, eyes curious and a touch bewildered.
After John and Sherlock had gone to Argos’s apartment, Sherlock had managed to deduce where he was running to with his daughter. They’d called Greg, and soon sound themselves crammed into his car heading for the docks where Argos planned to make his escape.
Sherlock blushed, and pressed his lips together. He could imagine John saying that under
Everything froze.
“I’ve got the tea!” Another woman entered the room and it only took a glance to see she was Devaki’s wife. “You must be John and Sherlock. I’m Sasha” she said, setting a tray with cups enough for all on the coffee table.
“Yes, I tell John the public would benefit more from less sensationalised accounts of our work, but he never listens.”
“That’s bullshit,” she said, as they lounged on her couch watching telly so John could delay heading home. “My father’s an omega and he could kick your dad’s arse any day.” She’d winked at him, and John had laughed despite himself.
. Sherlock was brilliant and beautiful. An alpha who was strong and domineering without being pigheaded. He looked at John as if John was a person, not just some perspective mate, which John hadn’t experienced since Aashriya from so long ago.
“Of course!”
“Such a good boy,” John purred, “Hands and knees love. I don’t think you’ll be able to resist any other way.”
When John Watson was thirty years old he joined the army. He’d finished his bachelor’s degree and internship at Bart’s, and quickly found out that the army was the best place to get away from his slowly disintegrating family and feed the adrenaline addiction he’d been smothering since he was a boy.
John had been going
“So I get off at four or so, but if you get bored at lunch time I can sneak away for a bit and drop you home.”
The wolf grinned at him and Sherlock smiled back. A large grey wolf at the centre of the pack let out a long howl and took off into the woods. The others followed yipping playfully. John paused a moment at the end of the trees and gave Sherlock a happy wag of his tail. Sherlock nodded and John took off, letting out a happy howl of his own.
“They’re trading war stories and Imran can’t hear so well out of his left ear,” Carlotta said by way of explanation.
Devaki gave him a considering look, “I know you live with a wolf long term, you’re practically drenched in the smell. So you’re not lying.”
Sherlock supressed an eye roll. John didn’t talk much about his father, but he’d said enough over time for Sherlock to know the man had been an odious prick.
Sherlock glared.
“Well done John!” Sherlock said, sprinting up to him.
Unable to help himself John leaned forward and pressed kisses to all these new/old features, fluttering kisses over Sherlock forehead, temples, cheeks. He would have kissed every inch of Sherlock’s face, but the detective cut him off, capturing John’s lips in another kiss.
“Really,” John said, trying to force enthusiasm into his words, “That’s wonderful.”
John gently pulled away, and pressed one last peck to Sherlock’s lips, which turned into another and another until they were both smiling to wide to continue. Taking a deep breath, John forced himself to head into the bathroom. If he stayed longer he’d just keep kissing and kissing Sherlock. Just before he stepped through the bathroom door, he looked back at the detective. Sherlock was smiling softly to himself, his eyes bright. Feeling lighter than air, John ducked into the bathroom.
“There she is,” Sherlock said, waving a hand to get Devaki’s attention.
He felt surprisingly calm for what he was about to do. This thing that had been building and building between them since that first night in Angelo’s was cresting and John finally felt brave enough to move it forward.
Sherlock flopped onto his bed and curled into a ball on his side. His mind raced over the details that backed up his conclusion. It wasn’t just the smell of cologne; a new romantic relationship explained John’s elevated mood, his desire to be fit, the way he smiled more and the glow in his eyes.
“I- yes I did. You’re very...talented John.”
“Really?”
He sighed softly and shut the book. He was being ridiculous. What he needed was a halfway decent spy novel and a  cup of overpriced coffee. Shutting the book, he made to stand up.
Things were calm now. Mary, and all that came along with her, were long passed. Eight months passed to be exact. The anger, hurt and horror over everything had faded, and while he and John would never be the same, they’d finally learned to change together. To adapt.
There was just one problem; Sherlock Holmes was completely and irrevocably in love with John Watson, and he had absolutely no idea how to tell him.
“No way!”
John had made during the shoulder rub.
With one last giggle, she hung up.
Sherlock licked his lips as their muscular, sweaty torsos slid together. The blood in his cheeks was taking a decidedly southern route. John was
Sherlock swallowed hard as he took in John’s wet, tousled hair and wry smile. The water made his strong shoulders glisten gold in the dim light of the bedroom. Drops trailed down his taught torso, sliding between the ridges of his abs and the grooves of his hip bones. As Sherlock watched, a drop of water caught on one peeked nipple, dangling tantalizingly, before dripping onto John’s toned chest.
“You know me John, I’m a man of action,” Sherlock said, his eyes mischievous.
“Here we are,” he said in that same plummy tone, eyes on Sherlock “Sorry it’s so sparse.”
John opened his mouth to reply but the man continued.
It was longer than average (something Sherlock had deduced long ago) and thick where it stood up proudly from a thatch of blond curls.
“Life or death Johnny,” Harry said quietly, looking grim.
“You take the first shower. I want to have a cuppa first.”
So what if he were biased.
“Where do you think my clients come from, John? They see
. The entire world narrowed down to John’s fingers and tongue, his mind blanking out to nothing but a litany of
Sherlock was shaking his head before John was even finished speaking. Why couldn’t John see how important he was?
“Sherlock  I-
married man with a baby. There’s no reason for jealousy.”
“She is. Should I be worried?” Sherlock said, not the slightest bit serious.
“You can send him in now, Mrs Hudson,” a deep voice called from the back room.
Sherlock stared at him, until John huffed out a laugh. “It’s just a little shoulder rub Sherlock. It won’t kill you. Please?”
With that, she swung her glamorous coat over her shoulders and strutted out of the café. More than a few heads turned to watch her go.
“Unfortunately yes,” Nathan said overly cheerful. “I doubt you’ll have to stay overnight, so don’t worry too much.”
“You too!”
“No,” Sherlock said, bearing the cover story in mind, “Not a case.”
Silence fell.
Sherlock knew how to cook. He was a grown man who’d lived alone for most of his adult life, of course he knew how to cook. He was good at it and although the food he usually made was simple, it tasted good. If that was the case, then why-oh-why was everything going so wrong, and on tonight of all nights when it mattered more than it ever did.
John knew she was being sincere, but looking at her face, at the worry in her eyes, he knew that he wouldn’t be able to leave now and not feel like a complete prick. He nodded and gestured for her to continue. He could at least here what this was about then decide what to do.
Sherlock kept his hands loose at his sides, waiting for Minchel to get close enough so he could grab the pipe.
“If I’m going away for as long as you say I am, one other charge won’t make a difference now would it?” Minchel growled before rushing forward and swinging the pipe.
With a sigh, he banged the tray of chicken onto the counter, knocking over the cutting board piled high with salad fixings in the process. He lunged for the falling board and just managed to grab one end of it. The heavy board tipped sideways, the lettuce and tomatoes on top sliding dangerously. Sherlock wrenched his wrist upward, throwing his arm out straight in a vain attempt to hold it. The move brought his other arm in close to his body, causing the hot pan of chicken to brush against his side. With a yelp, Sherlock flinched violently and both pan and board went crashing to the ground.
Spinning around he was surprised to see Minchel sliding out of a window, as clam as you please. He’d thought the man would try to slip away without confrontation.  He quirked an eyebrow at the iron pipe clutched in Minchel’s hand, as his mind whirled with half-formed plans for the best way to apprehend him.
Sherlock opened his mouth to reply, but John cut him off. Now that he’d started he couldn’t seem to stop the words from pouring out of his mouth.
“I need it. Do you think you could have it sent to me?”
“I didn’t spend a dime.”
Sherlock, as was his way, cut right to the solution of the problem. Apologizing or simpering wouldn’t be appreciated by John in the slightest.
. He probably knew what John liked and how John sounded when he-
With each word, John felt his hurt and anger grow. Mycroft had known. Molly had known. The homeless network had known, but somehow John hadn’t deemed good enough to be in the loop.
John laughed and reached for a gift.
Nathan gave Sherlock a patient look, before turning his attention back to John. “Can you stand Dr Watson?”
“Well that was one way to go about it,” John said with a grin, relishing Sherlock’s bark of laughter.
He’d taken one deep sniff of the air, although related alphas and omega wouldn’t find each other’s heat scents attractive they could still
“Simple.” Sherlock deadpanned, “A nice dinner.”
- just as much as Sherlock did.
Sherlock’s words trailed off as he looked back at John. The doctor was looking over his shoulder into the living room, taking in the fire and the table set nicely for two.
John gave him a grateful smile.
Not giving Sherlock any recovery time, John kept
He legs refused to work. John stood frozen, a fist mashed against his mouth and an arm clamped around his belly as he struggled to hold it in.
There was a shocked silence for a moment.
Sherlock furrowed his brow, “He’s wonderful.”
Sherlock stood panting by the foot of his bed. He could hear the blood pounding in his ears, and his heart was beating a wild tattoo against his shirt. The shower seemed louder than usual and it took all of Sherlock’s considerable will power not to imagine John naked and soapy no less than ten feet away from him. If he did, he knew nothing would stop him from storming into the bathroom and falling to his knees before John.
“You want us to open a joint account. Why?”
“Help with what?” John asked, his stomach tightening.
Sherlock let out a sigh of frustration as he watched John hail a cab and leave the crime scene. The wind tugged at his coat and ruffled his hair, making the crime scene tape flutter. He knew he shouldn’t be frustrated. He
The fact that is was Sherlock holding him had a lot to do with it was well.
Sherlock’s
“You gave me your childhood stuffy?”
“Is it true you’re a mage?”
“John I-
As he limped down the pavement, cane clutched tightly in one hand, he idly wondered what Ella would think if she knew he still visited two years after-after
“So tell me Sherlock, how many nights have you lain back, lubed up those gorgeous fingers and stuffed them up that pretty hole?”
,” John growled, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s back and pulling him up.
With another hard blink it all came back; the case the chase,
John swallowed hard at the sound of Sherlock’s voice. How many nights had he lain in this same bed and wished he could hear that deep baritone again? He shook his head, now was not to time to get sentimental. The man had lied to him for two years, he’d made John think he was dead.
John nodded, his eyes glued to the table top. “Thanks- I- thanks.”
John’s eyes went dark, and he licked his lips. “God, you’re sexy,” he growled, giving Sherlock a hard kiss before heading over to the bed. He unwrapped the towel and tossed it aside, before sitting with his legs spread wide and feet planted on the floor.
“I was taking apart Moriarty’s network.” Sherlock said, eyes on the floor and shoulders slumped. “I had to make sure there wasn’t anything left of it. Any- anyone who might come seeking retribution. It- it took longer than I anticipated.”  Sherlock’s voice had gone whisper soft.
“I think we should get these off before we get started, don’t you?” John said, tugging lightly at the waist of Sherlock’s trousers.
Sherlock held his breath and waited. And waited. And
“But John-
. John was getting the very thing he’d spent years bargaining with an indifferent God over, and he was turning away. He couldn’t help it though, he was just so
“Boyfriend yes,” Ajay said, giving John a conspiratory smile, as if he was letting him in on a secret.
“You,” he choked out, “You- how could-
John’s only reaction was lift of his eyebrows. After all these years together he was still impressed by Sherlock’s deductions, but not shocked by them anymore.
“I told you I wasn’t good at romance. Divorced remember?”
John chuckled, the sound rumbling through his chest. “You need your rest; we did just finish a case. When you wake up we’ll go to dinner. How does that sound?”
He’d thought they were heading in that direction, that John felt the same way he did. That John lov-
“Johnny!” Harry crowed down the line, making John wince. “How are you?”
John opened the wrapping eagerly. Although he never said it, Sherlock knew John loved getting presents.
Sherlock jumped a mile at the sound of John’s voice. He was standing at the window, violin poised to play. He’d been standing there for the better part of an hour, but so far he hadn’t played a single note. His mind was cluttered with images of John, strong and sexy as he fought. The competence and ease of his movements. His roguish smile. The strength behind each of his moves.
“Or here?” John asked, laying open mouthed kisses across Sherlock’s collar bone.
“Yeah. He was attacking Sherlock, so it was self-defense of course.”
John apricated Angelo’s excessive happiness, although it grated on his nerves. He knew it was to make him feel better, and though it didn’t work, John still apricated the effort. It was better than Angelo being overly sympathetic anyway.
Sherlock’s eyes flicked from side to side, move to John and then finally selected onto his own lap.
“I know you work in an office and own a cat,” Sherlock countered, unable to help himself.
perks.
Sherlock hummed agreement, he needed to say something before left. He didn’t want to leave the conversation hanging. “Try to warm up with that tea John. I’ll try not to take too long.”
They’d left the scene after the child had been handed over to child services. Lestrade had still been shouting at the officer who’d taken the shot.
“I think I’ll be alright. You said there was a bookstore?”
played an integral part in solving them. Therefore,
“God Sherlock. Just-just a l-little hard
It was a cream jumper from Mrs Hudson. John commented on the softness and then motioned for Sherlock to open his own.
“Er, no,” Sherlock said, eyes still down. “It was mine when I was little. Remember I told you about it? I still had it and thought you would appreciate it since yours was,” Sherlock searched for the nicest word to use, “taken from you.”
“Oh Sherlock.” John said in that same soft tone. He gently cupped Sherlock’s cheek, his thumb stroking softly over Sherlock’s cheek bone.
“Can I see your tail?” John asked without thinking.
for being an amazing beta!
“That’s so old fashioned,” Aashriya would say. “My secondary gender doesn’t dictate how I act no more than my primary gender does. I’m not some mindless animal who can’t control what I do.”
“I thought I red stitching would match the red on the button holes of your coat,” John said, looking a little shy, “Do they fit?”
Sherlock was silent, biting his lip and looking stricken.
He sighed as he got out of the shower, there was only one thing for it.
“I love you, too.”
Sherlock’s entire body shook in pleasure as he tried to formulate a coherent thought. It was too much. With a weak moan, Sherlock’s arms gave out and he found his face buried in the pillow.
John pushed up from his position on the floor and Sherlock swallowed again, as he was given an unhindered,
“I love you too, Sherlock. Relax, it’s okay.”
Mind made up, he sat up and flung his legs off the bed. Making John tea was the first order of business.
John looped his own arms around Sherlock’s waist and drew him closer, until they were pressed together from chest to hips. Their noses brushed against each other and Sherlock felt his heart soar. Here was John, wrapped around him and about to kiss him. He wanted the same thing Sherlock wanted and- suddenly, for some inexplicable reason, cold uncertainty flooded through him. Sherlock knew what he’d seen in John’s eyes in the alley, but was that enough? What if this wasn’t as serious for him as it was for-
Sherlock nodded, snatched the cup from Ajay’s hand and stalked into the kitchen. He banged around in the cupboards until he found the bottle of whiskey he’d gotten from Mycroft last christmas and two clean glasses.
The man smiled and got to feet. “Yes, that’s me. And you are?”
“My brother opened a restaurant you know,” she said suddenly, clearly just as eager as John to change the topic.
The DI hurriedly cleared his throat and sat back., still smiling far to much. “Right. Telling someone they’re important. Do you have any idea how you want to do it?”
To Sherlock’s surprise, John looked nervous.
“Yes! Yes, John they are! Please, ple-
Sherlock shook his head, his body suffused with heat. “Can we get on with it please, John? I want to kiss
John’s face lit up and he smiled, “Oh yes I’d really enjoyed that,” he glanced around the room, “If everyone else is comfortable of course.”
Just then the door downstairs slammed and Sherlock got to his feet and headed to the living room. He planned to ask John to make dinner and then work on an experiment for the rest of the afternoon.
Tell me what you think!
“Roll over, lovely.” John purred, laying one last kiss to Sherlock’s ankle. Sherlock swallowed and complied, whining as his cock was pressed against the sheets. John began slowly kissing his way up Sherlock’s other leg, pausing to suck at the delicate skin covering the back of his thigh. When he got to his arse John, once again, by passed it entirely, and followed the groove of Sherlock’s spine with his lips. By the time John reached the nape of his neck, whispered pleas were falling from Sherlock’s bitten lips.
“John? John can you hear me?”
“Yes we do, John. I was worried we would have gone to our graves, but now,” he grinned, “Now, we have today…”
John chuckled and kissed again.
“So- Patrick?” John asked, looking at Sherlock expectantly.
There it had been said. There was no going back now. Sherlock kept his gaze locked on John, his eyes flicking desperately over every feature of John’s face, trying to gauge his reaction.
“Tell me Sherlock. Please tell me.”
“That’s not natural for us,” Devaki said, wincing, “We’re meant to run together.”
“Yeah, I’ve been running alone since I got back from Afghanistan and it’s not…the best of circumstances.”
“So you’ve met his family,” John said quietly as they rounded the landing.
Sherlock smiled and turned around to face her again.
” he swept his eyes down their bodies. “This is the most important thing I’ve ever done.” John’s smile turned impish, “Now, can I kiss you?”
The silence stretched on for so long John thought the man wouldn’t answer. Then a deep rumble of a voice that made John’s earlobes tingle said, “Sherlock. My name is Sherlock.”
“Why did you make me
“Anything.”
John grinned and pulled him down for a deep kiss, his tongue peeking out to stroke Sherlock’s lower lip. He slowly trailed his lips across Sherlock’s jaw, making the detective shiver.
“Hello,” Devaki said smiling at them both. “You must be John,” she held out a hand and John shook it, smiling brightly.
Just then the door behind John creaked open, “Everything okay, John?”
Sherlock propped his forehead against the shower wall, sliding his other hand over his thigh and between his arse cheeks. He bit his lips harder as his water slick fingers found his hole. He slowly glided his fingers over and around his entrance as Mind-John kept up his litany of praise.
“It’s serious Johnny,” Harry said, with a grave face, ignoring Aashriya.
Soon, the two of them would get a cab to the family country house where John could roam the woods. Luckily, as a fellow student of magic, Mycroft was fully aware of werewolves, and willing to give John a safe space to run.
John looked anything but annoyed. In fact, he looked happy and soft and in lo-

curled under the water. John was only able to get the impression of a long tail before it vanished. He blinked hard and rubbed his eyes. The current the creature was making was moving to the other side of the porch. John hustled over and peeked cautiously over the side. A pale shape was just visible under the water. As John watched a pair of milk pale hands and arms slid out of the water. Dark hair followed, and then John was looking at the same man from last night. Squinting John struggled to see the rest of the man’s body below the water. All he could make out was something long and gently iridescent.

“And John?”

When John was young Jack would take him to the library sometimes, but instead of getting a book he’d just tell him stories. Real honest adventures. Jack’s favorite stories were about the Doctor, this man who helped everyone, who saved the universe and travelled magically around.
They fight. They fight a lot.
“No,” John said quietly, grabbing his wallet and keys. “I have enough there.”
“Fine. She’s nice. Has this weird thing about model trains.”
“Sure.”
Mycroft and Mummy were closer than Sherlock and Mummy. That turned out to be all right, because Mummy and Sherlock shared something Mycroft could never understand: the journey, the longing, the brilliant sound of the TARDIS calling them home, the way the Doctor made you feel like the most important bit of cosmic dust eternity had ever smashed together.
“God yes,” Sherlock says, and is rewarded by John’s low chuckle, by John brushing his wet hair back and slipping his fingers down to cradle Sherlock’s face.
connection, though she couldn’t yet know of what sort, and furthermore, that Sherlock still felt it, and wanted to act upon it, which was why he was laying claim over John. Telling Mary, he knew better, and he had John, in a way she didn’t.
She was no longer hungry.
“And that’s the last I’m going to say about this,” Lestrade said, signaling for another drink. “Let’s pretend this never happened and talk about the weather.”
“Your friendship, as you are my best friend and she my wife.”
Apparently it is futile to dwell on anything else, so he starts making his mental lists again, while he is hanging up his laundry. Sherlock is in the kitchen piercing human ears with a stapler. John suspects this is less “for science” and more “for my mad whims” but he doesn’t want to ask. A lot of living with Sherlock is a willingness to not ask.
He grimaced. “Damn.”

Melancholy. Like a song of yearning but hopeful too. - JW
The harpoon ends up in a corner for a couple of weeks. John is not sure what is going to happen with it but eyes it warily just the same. There’s another case, poor Julia and poor Helen, snakes and poison and Lestrade pointing out that it’s perfectly

Because it all happened and then Sherlock said, “Goodbye, John” and threw himself off a roof.
“He’s not only a friend,” Sherlock said, after some hesitancy. “He’s a real --- companion.”
“But you’re incorrect in assuming this has nothing to do with the child. In fact, John keeps preventing me from any action in consideration of her.”
“Wow.”
“Do you think,” John started slowly. “Do you think we – at the hospital, you said – do we need to talk, Sherlock?”
"Stand back up," he commands. John does, not so much out of obedience as deep confusion and not a little concern. "When you die, John, I give you an immortal spirit because you've allowed me to infuse your blood with mine. You needn't worry about your mortality."

The day Sherlock snuck them onto the roof of the British Museum, to find Jack already waiting from them, and the two stared at each other, like they should know but they didn’t. And before John could explain, there was the noise. The beautiful, glorious noise. The one Sherlock turned to before the box even appeared, the one that made Jack laugh and say, “I

There was a trick to their layout, in that it was impressively easy to eavesdrop on the front door from their stairs. Mary didn’t mean to, it was just, when she saw the mysterious Sherlock at the door she’d paused, to take him in, and then she saw the way he smiled at John, at her John, like John was
“We’re considering it as a name for our daughter.”
“I’m sorry, terribly rude, but can I speak to my wife alone, for a moment?”
“My father isn’t my biological dad. He was away for so long, in the war, my mother… she ended up getting real close to this friend of hers, and I was the product of their affair. Everyone knew, but no one talks about it. He’s my Uncle Jack.”
They tried. It even worked, when they both stared idly at a news broadcast, meaningless words slipping past now and again. When John felt it’d be polite he put down his money and gave Lestrade a firmly-felt pat on the shoulder and went home.

And John, actually, didn’t want that.
That was, in fact, the exact reason he’d called Harry. Because she was not a Sherlock-apologist, and as an outsider, might have a clearer view of things, and because she was willing to call his bluff. He could not say the same for Lestrade. And Sarah - well, not only did she work early tomorrow, but she was Mary’s friend - Mary’s friend far before he ever knew her, they’d gone to uni together, they were thick as thieves, and when Mary wanted to talk to someone about this she’d call Sarah first and Sarah would absolutely not take John’s side.

John chuckles at that. "Am I joining the skull?" he askes, pleasantly, throatily.
Sherlock held up his hands, to demonstrate how harmless he was. “I have no intention of removing your child from you. I simply anticipate being in her presence as John’s husband and, if possible, a stepfather. I’ve already –”

This, seemingly, is not one of them.
Sherlock is demisexual. (This word, wikipedia tells him, describes a person who is attracted to people regardless of body but on only the basis of mind and personality. Should Sherlock ever be attracted to someone, John figures, it would be as such.)
Now he wasn’t sure if he should.
It occurred to Mary that all these thoughts were taking awhile to think and that absolute silence had descended on the table, that Sherlock was still watching her carefully, and that John was too, with terrible concern and an obvious guilt.
John got out the front door and halfway down the street before his brain started screaming.
Surely he could cope with Sherlock coming back.

“It’s true.”
“No. Look. I’m sorry.” He took a deep breath. “I can’t - I just left my wife. I can’t go home and pretend everything is normal immediately.”
He wrote down very carefully the day his father stopped in, walked right in the door and hugged him close and said, “Your mother is dead. She’s been dead for some time now, but I didn’t understand until today.
Sherlock could no longer refuse himself.
He came back. Sure. He came back. A bit off, a bit worn out, a bit strung and wired and thin and bloodied, a bit more pushed back into his skull like someone had pressed his eyeballs in. All rough edges again, the careful erosion John had patiently applied cracked through or abandoned (he wasn’t sure which). But Sherlock came back. Sherlock Holmes returned from the dead, and that should have been enough for John; it certainly was for Sherlock, who just knocked on his door one day with his nervous fake-smile stretched wide and wondering if John wanted to come with him on a new case, a famous card-player had been shot and –
John slipped his hand away and followed Sherlock in silence.
“Tired of people asking that question,” she said, and they both laughed. Lestrade’s was genuine, but John could hear the nervousness reappear in his voice at the next question.
“She said he was in love with me. I mean, I think.” He says this quickly so he only has time to regret it. John needs a reality check. Apparently he’s asking
“No.” Mary stood up, walked away from them, to the door of the parlour that led to the stairs. She set her shoulders and stared down at them. Tears still drying, her eyes with a burning fire like a cold moon. Sherlock was again impressed by John’s selection of spouse: not as good as himself, certainly, but intelligent and strong of spirit and not afraid to fight.
He went about this without statement to Sherlock, who never asked, though did seem surprised (disappointed?) the day that John told him he was moving out and in with Mary. “You realize,” Sherlock had said, in annoyance, “we won’t be –” and John had just said, “Yes”.
Sherlock is still coasting off the thrill of several good mysteries in a row, doing some background research, catching back up on sleep. Watching him slide out of his room in a sheet, drop it on the living room floor when he spots his robe, putting on his robe and gathering the sheet and getting a cup of coffee, makes John think the Thoughts that Wouldn’t again. If he’s getting to the point that
Because Sherlock carefully places his hands on John’s face, gently, like they are both scared animals about to scatter, and he closes his eyes like this is something he has memorized and he is looking up an internal diagram. John knows it is going to happen before it does.
“Oh?” That was interesting, as he honestly couldn’t guess what it was.

It was that John saw how much he’d lied to himself, that he was improving Sherlock, making him better; he saw how removed and fixed that star truly was in the glittering black depths. How there would always
And then it’s been long enough, the dye is soaking in, his skin starts to itch, and he twitches just slightly.
“Yeah. We’ll work on this.” John folded it back up and took Sherlock’s hands again. “Come over for dinner tonight. She’s been expecting you.”
“Yes. Just for a bit. I mean - I want to be around you. So badly. But-”
Sherlock considers the available approaches springing from different motivations: to ignore it, to mention it, to hide it, to propose solutions… His brain responsively returns a list of answers, but he knows he doesn’t have the preexisting research to make a good selection. He looks at John. John comes back and sits down in a chair across from him, and sets the timer on his phone, and sets the phone down, and stares back at him.
“Bit last minute,” Jack said. “There’s an alien flu outbreak, people are breaking out in big purple pustules.”
Irene had a crush on Sherlock. Fine. She was attracted to him, fine.
John smiled sadly. Sherlock talked into his shoulder. It seemed too much, otherwise. He looked at the cables and how perfectly they crossed the seam. He realized this jumper must be homemade and, judging by the color, by Mrs. Hudson. And it pained him to know that he did not already know this, that this and so much had happened while he was gone, that they had lost three years...
Perhaps he needs some sort of detective. - SH
“As a hypothetical.”
“Are you ready?” Sherlock asks, and he means, for what they are about to do, but John says yes and grabs his hips and kisses him, because he needs to be with Sherlock again before it begins. Because even pretending that Sherlock was dead was unbearable. Because easily Sherlock could die, within the next few weeks.
Let’s start with the slime - JW

Sherlock smirked, because they both knew it was never just once, but his face straightened into a careful neutral when his eyes darted about, capturing John’s nervousness and confusion under glass. “Is it a terrible idea?” he asked.
Fuck.
“He was in this morning for a case.” Lestrade held up his phone for them to see and started a forwarded video, Sherlock smiling at the camera and then doors bursting open, Anderson’s high-pitched scream, papers flying everywhere, Donovan looking up a moment later to gasp and fall out of her chair. When the detective inspector himself appeared on the screen, looking both annoyed and unsurprised, Lestrade quickly turned it off. “Still just as dramatic. He’s working on that kidnapping case, I don’t know if you saw the news.”
“I’m not saying you should raise her here,” he said. “I’m saying
“Then you are one of a very few to not make that assumption.”
Sherlock, even if Sherlock couldn’t come over for a whole night, how much John missed him and now he was back, couldn’t Sherlock spare an hour? And John couldn’t say that all the texts from Sherlock were in fact him wordlessly begging John for just one hour.
“I’m mad because this is extremely unfair.”
And of course people changed.
“This is going well,” Sherlock told him. “She was a good choice.”
“Can you love someone without being attracted to them?” This question is directed at the next person who will listen. That happens to be Molly, as they check in on the hanged corpse of the stepfather.
“No,” says John. “Come on, we need to do this properly.” He stands and Sherlock immediately rises, follows him. John gestures him and has him kneel, lean against the bath edge, head held over the tub. He arranges Sherlock’s hands in back again. Sherlock closes his eyes, because there is no new visual input and so he’ll get more information paying attention to his other senses, and because John has taken something out of his pocket that whispers like silk, that
That was what he did, and he was good at it. Hadn’t he managed in worse situations - more dangerous, if not more extreme - and not just managed but performed with excellence, staunched blood and torn back lives, far beyond the minute he thought his own life was a fragile gust of wind away from gone? If he could survive a real war, and a private one, surely he could have one simple conversation with his wife.
The door slammed shut behind him.
Then he understood.
“No?” John asks. He turns to speak to him; they are already so close that it becomes the same-shared breath, the distance prior to a kiss.
“You know better than I, the way he gets this time of year.”
Sherlock slipped out of the chair and joined him on the floor, rubbing his back.
Which meant that Sherlock saw the lines, and could easily act upon them, in a manner that was above the greatest Mary could ever in her life grasp at.

“No,” John said quickly. “No it’s... it’s good, Sherlock.”
It meant she was allowed to be impatient, and worry. It meant she could curse when he gently pulled out her chair and handed her a hot cup of chamomile tea and listened attentively to her day when they both knew he was rolling some stupid boulder up some damned hill he refused to share with her.
Lestrade was starting to think this was stupid.
You’d better not be doing anything horrible to kittens - JW
Now he thinks about kissing Sherlock.
He stopped. He did not move away. John couldn’t untangle himself without outright pushing him, and didn’t, tried to press down his hair, cheeks tinged red. “I’m still married, Sherlock.”
He considered the question with the weight it was due. There were still a multiplicity of correct answers, and he wasn’t sure what she wanted, even with the John’s rule of
“How long were you in love?”
Not the next week, either.
“John isn’t weak,” he bit.
"And that's my skull?" he asks finally. "That, right there, the thing I'm looking at is the skull from my own head?"
Sherlock stumbles up, turns around. His hair drips down his back. John, too, has gotten wet in the shower, has already stripped off his shirt. He reaches back to undo the knot.
Something was different in her John.
But he understands, all of a sudden.

Lestrade was alluding to imprisoning Sherlock for matters of bureaucracy and procedure. Whereas Sherlock should really be behind bars for murder in the first degree, aggravated assault, impersonation, grand theft...
He was wrong.
“All right.” He took out a folded piece of paper and handed it to Sherlock. “I don’t think I need this anymore. But you should take a look.”
John was good at that part. If he found or was given the right conclusion, John could ignore a lot of personal pain, and sacrifice, and even the pain of others, to make it happen. Mary couldn’t. She just couldn’t, at the end of the day, and that’s why she had to stop working with children who sometimes died.
“I,” he says, scrambling for a way to back out.
And that was how they were.
“Oh good,” John said, meaning it. “Those poor children.”
I consider four early morning. - SH
That hadn’t ended well for Irene.
“Yes, I see how calling me names is much more romantic.”
He is pleased at this insight and wishes he had someone to mention it to.
He tries to reason through it, the way Sherlock would want him to. The way the phone makes him feel is not reasonable.
Sherlock is gay. (This was John’s first assumption, based partly on the way he was dressed but mostly because everyone who already knew Sherlock and was meeting John for the first time just assumed John was Sherlock’s boyfriend,
Just fine.
Sherlock wished that John had finished making that tea because it would probably calm him down quite a bit, but the kettle had clicked off minutes ago, and then he was delighted to revel in what those minutes had done to them. But he took a deep breath, and prepared himself, and said very calmly, “You won’t have to.”

“And is there anything else I should know? Should I expect evil acrobats to interrupt our dates?”
“John doesn’t talk much of your time together,” Mary said. She was still staring at him, but clearly addressing Sherlock. “Of your mystery solving, I mean. Most of it I read on his old blog. I thought – I figured it was too sad, to have lost a friend, and that’s why he couldn’t talk about it. And sometimes –” she cleared her throat thickly, “sometimes the way Greg talked, I thought he’d lost a real… a real good friend, like a partner, someone you only meet once in your life but I never imagined that… that he’d lost his other half.”
“It was that woman, wasn’t it. The one that made him so sad.”
When did we get kittens - JW
He nodded, looking suspicious, but John quietly steered Mary back into the living room and took her hands in his.
“What’s my middle name?”
This was, Lestrade thought, the first time Sherlock had ever accepted or needed permission from anyone else.
But it’s still there. Floating in the background, occasionally rustling its wings, as if in gentle reminder. John finds this very annoying. He decides he is absolutely not wasting anymore time on it and is very successful, especially when they get another case (

He would build up trust from them, show off his talent at parenting (no doubt excellent), so that his commitment was a foregone conclusion; the whole time, Lestrade would be begging him for his help, and Sherlock would only need wait for an urgent, priority case (with any luck, one that was putting children in danger - their empathy creating guilt) that would absolutely demand his attention, just this once. A few more ‘this time only’ and Sherlock would have it all. Once his work was accepted by repetition he would convince Mary of the security but importance of John’s presence; realistically, he was aware this might be delayed until the baby reached a certain age. That would also depend on the custody schedule, but there he could rely on one of Mycroft’s minions creating whatever legal state he and John wanted week by week.

like a little child. But as soon as he’d said it he had realized his mistake; this wasn’t in his notebook. It was going to be all wrong. And he was right, he was always right; his father turned around and stared at him blankly and didn’t know Sherlock at all.
It’s not his, so it must be Sherlock’s, whose taste in relaxation reading does exist (in fact, Sherlock reads a terrible amount of Poe, of which John only makes the mistake of asking about the detective

There was a break in his voice. Lestrade looked back over quickly, because this was the moment a suspect confessed. The moment a person started crying. Sherlock looked like he was collapsing into himself, becoming smaller, just a stick of a man in nice clothes and nothing to say of himself. “Obviously. I can’t change the past, I can’t fix what’s become, can’t change...” he waved his hand. “John doesn’t...”

He can draw inference from the evidence they gather and know where to point the weapon. But the weapon he points is John. Because Sherlock knows what motions to perform, but he’s not good at actually

“Excellent.” He untangled his legs from the blanket over them and vanished into his room. When he returned with a small black book John had never seen before, he flicked off the episode of QI, curious.
He had his own pages in the notebook, where he wrote about his trips, and his speculations.
