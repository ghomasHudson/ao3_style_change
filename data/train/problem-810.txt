Sherlock shrugged, but the gesture wasn’t as offhanded as he probably wanted it to look. All evening, it was like he wanted to impress John. Which did make sense. He
“So, what about the class photo?” John asked later over sushi. Maria had emailed the few pictures of Sammy she’d kept after the strange events began in earnest—most of which she’d burned when the shadow kept popping up in them, just as they had with Robert when he was a child. One was Sammy’s class picture, shadow firmly in place to the side.
Trent nodded. “I don’t even get down on my knees or talk out loud. Just in my head. But he said he could hear me and didn’t like it. He’s crazy. Scary and crazy.”
Eurus shrugged and sipped her tea. “Mmm, masala. How very seasonal of you, John. I can do research. I’m shite at cooking, but I make killer scones.” She waved a hand in that Sherlockian (Holmesian?) way. “Whatever you need.”
“And filing finished cases away in a file cabinet?” John asked, attempting to steer the conversation back to the red folders he’d seen earlier. It was the second time he’d mentioned them since they’d left the flat hours before, his determination far from flagging despite the evening’s excitement.
relationship, but then again, neither were they. It wasn’t a surprise, because it was Sherlock, who had never seemed particularly interested in gross matter, except when it was under a microscope or on a slab at the morgue. And John was a grown man who’d sowed his wild oats across three continents, who knew how to take things in hand, as it were (in the shower, where it was easy to clean up), when he felt the urge. What mattered was that they had each other, and they were happy and comfortable.
Okay, I’ll admit it. I suffer from a major case of apophenia (dear God, how I hate that word). You try living with a man who investigates the paranormal for a living, and you’ll start seeing patterns in everything too. I don’t know how Sherlock has lasted this long without going completely mad, or at the very least, paranoid. Can it really be as simple as, if you buy a shirt/car/watch, all of a sudden you see it everywhere? Maybe.
“Ah. No. Just cases with the right occurrence of events to make disproving difficult at this point in time.”
The subject: the paranormal. Things that go bump in the night or appear in mirrors when you chant their name. As a horror film fan, I wasn’t completely annoyed with the topic of my first article. At least it wasn’t the world’s largest pizza. I interviewed the three paranormal investigators picked to be the focus of the article and quickly noticed a theme.
He stormed through the diner and out the door, John struggling to put on his coat and follow him. By the time he reached the pavement, Sherlock was closing the door to a cab. John sighed. Sherlock running when things got overwhelming was nothing new. He was about to head to the Tube station when his phone buzzed. Hoping it was a contrite Sherlock, he pulled it from his pocket. No. Eurus.
"Oh John, I thought about you every day," he gasped, each gasp punctuated with a hard thrust that hit John's prostate each time. "I wanted to come home, I wanted to come back to you so much, but I needed to finish it. I needed you safe."
If anyone could do it, it would be him. And he would do it, he would definitely do it, but why not tell him, why not explain after the fact?
'What? But, I mean, i thought you loved her, your having a baby together. I'm kinda lost here John, your gunna have to explain it to me.'
At Sherlock's words John broke into a dazzling smile and then pressed  a small kiss to their joint hands.
"I haven't spoken to them since I informed them of my intentions to marry your brother." He told Mycroft coldly. "And I have no want or need to contact them ever again." Mycroft coughed awkwardly.
"How'd I get through it? I had two very good friends. They were there for when I needed them the most. They helped me through everything. Getting situated, keeping me from being bored, and most importantly they were both there helping me give birth."
The young man was in there when they arrived. His walls, too, had been scrubbed clean. Sherlock went over his room with the same fine-toothed comb, then turned to Trent when he was done.
The children stood silent and calm where they were placed. One woman made a final symbol on the ground, then moved outside the circle. A single man remained inside the circle, and he began speaking in a booming voice.
“Where are you going?” John called out, following behind. He saw Sherlock putting on his coat and gloves.
“If we don’t make it tomorrow …” John began. He wasn’t sure what he wanted to say, but he wanted to start the conversation they needed to have.
That silence was finally broken when John received an email from a Wendy Hochman in Germany. She’d said that she’d contacted Sherlock almost a year ago, and he’d dismissed her story without even a call or visit. A check through Sherlock’s email folder showed she had indeed emailed Sherlock and he had replied with his usual workplace charm—that is to say, none. It turned out she had recently begun reading John’s blog after a friend noticed similarities between Sammy’s circumstances and those of her toddler son, Kurt. She was asking John to look into her case.
It took five days for John to convince Mike to let him interview Robert Torres, then another three to get in touch with the subject himself. He decided Sherlock should be invited to participate as well, and it didn’t take much persuading, which made John believe he wasn’t happy with how things had ended during his initial investigation. Because Robert lived in California, they met over a video call. It was ten days since he’d met Sherlock. His first article had been posted four days after that initial meeting, and he was chomping at the bit to get a second story out, especially once he read through the scarlet file and learned a little more backstory.
With such a reputation, you’d think he’d be out of work, or at least avoided by people who hope their hauntings are true. But in fact, it’s the opposite. Not because people want his help, but because they want to prove him wrong.
The wait was shorter than John expected. He puttered around the rest of the day—did some cleaning and laundry, read a few magazines so he could bin them in hopes of finding their desk buried under three layers of files and papers, made a shopping list. It was one of those rare quiet days with no cases or even experiments. He really should have done some more research, but he was hesitant to interrupt this soft and homey atmosphere that pervaded their space so rarely. He ended up in front of their bookcases, trying to find a book he could half pay attention to while discretely watching Sherlock do his own lazy puttering. He heard him come up behind him as he perused their library but didn’t turn around, expecting that Sherlock either wanted a book of his own or would make his needs otherwise known with some sharp command.
“I spoke with the night janitor on my way out. He'd already cleaned that wing of the building, there was nobody but me. And there was something else.” Robert hesitated before continuing. “As I was leaving, he asked me if my friend was gonna be staying, and if so, he would need to sign in.”
“Yeah, I don’t know the details, but she had to have something to do with it. She watched us so carefully, when she was around at least. She would be gone for weeks at a time on ‘business trips,’ but when she was home, her focus was on me and Sherlock. Well, for a while. When I was about ten, she stopped paying attention to me. She was angry when he let her know he wanted to go away to uni, but she finally acquiesced when Victor talked her into it.” She frowned at the mention of Sherlock’s friend.
John saw the lights waver. Sherlock’s song was working! He tried to roll over, but a sharp pain in his wrist stopped him. Fuck, definitely broken. How had that happened? He didn’t remember much of the last five minutes (hours?), but whatever he’d done had worked. Eurus was working on the final symbol, Sherlock was most of the way through his song. He could relax and let them do the work now.
“We’re adults now, John. There is no mystery. And it’s time everyone else realized that.” Sherlock sipped his tea.
John moved to stand between the two rooms while he waited for the kettle to boil. Eurus sprawled in Sherlock’s chair. She’d traded her coat for a thick, long jumper and her boots for matching wool socks. “Why’s it so cold in here?”
John pulled out a DVD sleeve from the folder and handed it over. Sherlock inserted the disc, labeled “Torres,” and waited for the media viewer to open. “A good portion of the media I receive are in VHS and Super 8 formats. But rather than haul out a projector every time I need to review something, I have the contents transferred to a DVD,” he explained as the video opened.
“Robert called me twenty minutes ago. He went missing after school yesterday afternoon. Went into the toilet at three forty-seven and never came out. One small, high window was the only egress apart from the door to the hallway, where a teacher waited for him.”
Holmes fumbled with the mobile he was still studying and looked up quickly at John. “You really think so?”
She raised an eyebrow. “So, I was right then. You contacted me about that tape we made when we were kids?”
It took a while, but John finally sussed out the change in Sherlock. It was guilt, it had to be. Too many times, Sherlock had insisted he owed a debt to Mary. Rosie might have lost a mother, but that didn’t mean she had to be left with a single parent. Molly began dropping by John’s flat more often, and Mrs. Hudson would call, insisting on visits from the Watsons (which often led to visits with Sherlock, of course). John knew those too were due to Sherlock’s influence.
“More atonal than minor. Dissonant. He also gave his works names like ‘The Satanic Poem’ and ‘Black Mass.’”
“No, of course not. This was just an investigation into strange noises in a child’s room. Nothing—supposedly—sinister.” He sighed and rubbed his forehead. “I guess I was wrong about that.”
John turned to face Sherlock. “So you think, from their perspective, that they think this is real, right? They’re not faking it on purpose. It’s just an amazing set of coincidences that happened to surround one family?” John believed in coincidence, but that was a lot of them stacked up on top of each other.
His current research was on Percival Black, the composer who was possibly doing some work on a “cure” for the Unsound. It turned out he was a fellow Englishman who had moved to a Russian monastery in the nineties to work on his musical compositions. John’s calls and emails weren’t having any returns, but he’d managed to get in touch with Black’s flatmate from uni. The man described Black as the usual creative type: kept to himself, worked late into the night, but friendly enough.
Sherlock shrugged. “They want you to look into Glushka or the Order, I reckon. Or Marie. Who knows.” He stood up. “Now, let’s go to the pub. I want shepherd’s pie.”
have set it up, but- but the ghost could have framed her! Maybe it didn’t want to be found out and–”
“Not really.” Eurus gave an apologetic shrug. “He seemed conflicted the last time I saw them, but not like he wanted to leave Sherlock. If anything, he seemed more in love than ever.”
For the past five years, Sherlock Holmes has offered a £1 million reward to anyone who can prove the existence of the supernatural. He’s been sent hundreds of cases over the years, and every time, he’s come back with proof of the mundane: greed, power, sometimes just a good old prank. But he’s debunked them all.
“Needs must,” Sherlock rumbled from next to John in the booth of a diner they’d been sitting in for an hour, waiting for the third member of their party to show.
He was right, John realized. Him keeping quiet about a sister fit perfectly with Sherlock’s modus operandi. “Is that a family trait or just a Sherlock trait?” he asked.
“Yeah. It didn't take him long to figure out that we were experiencing what he called um, what was that again?”
. Now a victim has written a note!” Finding what he wanted, Sherlock rushed to the door while calling over his shoulder, “No time for tea, Mrs. Hudson. I’ll be out late. Perhaps some light refreshment when I return?”
His flatmate sighed but came to stand behind John. He was silent for a while, then hummed. “I would say a ritual of some sort, but the rows of figures at this end are lined up in a militaristic manner, so perhaps a battle? Where are the pictures from?”
likely means a family member. Six months old, mp3-enabled. A young man’s gadget. Brother or cousin then. You’re not close, but he wanted you to keep in touch. You’re down on your luck, so he gave you his old phone. But why? It’s practically new and gifted to him by his wife or girlfriend. Probably wife, given the expense of it. Why give away an expensive gift from a loving partner? Domestic troubles. What kind? The scratches on the charger port suggest a drinking problem. You frowned at the message but didn’t reply. Either a message from your boss that you didn’t want to read or ramblings you’ve seen a thousand times from your brother. The weariness in your expression suggests the latter, as you’ve just started this job and haven’t had time to grow jaded, unlike your interactions with your sibling.”
When John finally fell back asleep, their hands were still stacked on top of Sherlock’s arm, and they were curled into each other, warm and safe.
Sherlock’s fingers tapped out a nervous rhythm on his mug. “It’s just– That is, if we … but we don’t have to–
Victor have to do with any of it? He had disappeared before Sherlock had even really dived into the paranormal, before all the weirdness started. Or was his disappearance the beginning?
High praise coming from the acerbic genius. John smiled back. “I held my own back in school. I was really good with biology—thought about medical school for a while—but I liked those maths word problems too.”
Eurus is just a normal kid in this universe. Well, mostly. You’ll see. But she’s not a psychopath or evil. I just needed a younger sibling for Sherlock, and she was available for the job. She promises to behave. ;)
“We’re going. I’ll book the flights after lunch.” That said, John stood to head into the kitchen. This far into their friendship, he knew how to deal with Sherlock’s sulks, and he was stubborn enough to win on occasion. He felt confident this would be one of those times.
John’s mind tried to follow along with the quickly spouted deductions, but he felt his temper rising. What kind of person called out someone’s PTSD and traumatic injuries? Well, he knew what kind of person. The kind he’d begged Mike to let him interview. He pulled back his shoulders and nodded. “Afghanistan.”
"I'm sorry, but it's better to be safe, John I got diagnosed today, I've had it ever since I've been with Victor, that was three months ago, John there's all the chance in the world that you have it as well." Sherlock whispered, to which John just shook his head and muttered his denials once more.
"It's beautiful." Sherlock murmured, looking back at John just so that he could make sure this wasn't all some sort of big joke. Just to make sure this actually was the house, and they weren't just making a detour on their way to a shack down on the edge of the city.
"Ah, there we go! Well no wonder I didn't notice it before, it's only just a little string." John said with a little frown, finally noticing an interruption in the ceiling. There was nothing more than a line carved through, making a big enough trapdoor to fit a person or a small piece of furniture. It wasn't the most impressive thing, yet all the same its secretive nature made it all the more exciting. Attics had plenty of uses, some for criminal activity and some for mere hoarding. John may very well be excited for both. Yet he hadn't exactly thought this through, for while the string was short the ceiling was tall, and he realized immediately that even if he jumped he wouldn't be able to reach. Oh how humiliating it was, to have to ask for help.
"In five minutes." Sherlock said honestly. John nodded, tapping his fingers against his legs anxiously.
"But as you said before, you'll work your way up. All careers are a pathway, not a permanent position." Mary assured with a little nod.
"Well that was quite the mystery. I feel almost as if we had resolved our problem, yet opened a completely new issue all the same. Who was that woman, I wonder?" I asked as I made my way to the brandy, pouring myself a hearty glass and holding the decanter so as to offer some to my friend.
"Are we going to love this baby?" John wondered at last, looking up towards Sherlock a bit hopefully.
"No, not partying! I was too busy wringing earplugs into my ears, so as to avoid their yelling. And then in regular intervals he'd come up and try to get me to join." Sherlock groaned. "I think he fancies me."
"I must've seen it somewhere; certainly I saw it on a file. I mean, Sherlock Holmes, it's um...it's not a common name. I heard your first name, and connected it to the last that's..." John nodded his head, grabbing at the door handle and finding now that he could open it just fine. The hall was empty. "That's how I knew it."
"Oh really? And this isn't just some...some expedition to find Mr. Prince Charming, hm?" John presumed. Sherlock gave a little chuckle of denial, his cheeks growing a bit red as he shook his head.
"Where have you been all this time?" Mary demanded finally. John hesitated, looking towards the house and then towards Sherlock, deciding finally that it would be in his best interest to lie. If he told Mary that he had fallen asleep at the house, well then she would get all up in arms against the place. She already thought it was a burden, now this may be the final straw.
"Well thank you Sherlock. I'm proud to say that I had some input." John said with a little smirk. Sherlock nodded, forcing a little laugh because he wasn't sure what else to say. John cleared his throat a bit shamefully, for he realized now that was something of an obscene joke to make with such a man. John couldn't help but think this whole night was just a very rude way to shove his family into Sherlock's face, Sherlock who might have loved him at one point in their past lives. It was almost rude, really, to force him to come to grips with the fact that he was too late to properly recreate the past. And the way he was acting, around John's wife and child, well it made him wonder constantly what might have been the context of Sherlock's dream this afternoon. He had to wonder if it had anything to do with this failed opportunity. The dinner went just as John might have expected, that is perfectly acceptable yet awkward all the same. He wasn't sure if that feeling of uncomfortableness was present in the whole of the table, yet for him specifically he found it rather difficult to concentrate. He knew that with every word out of Mary's mouth John was afraid she might say something that would embarrass him, whether it be something about his history in America and his fall out with his parents, or instead something more recent, like mishaps with Rosie or the neighbors. And when Sherlock responded back he was afraid that he might mention the house, that a slip of the tongue would lead them down that road, the road with would undoubtedly begin with Mary questioning how Sherlock even knew about the house in the first place. There was a double blind here, presumably. Mary didn't know about Sherlock's involvement with the house, for of course she didn't know there was anything peculiar about the structure at all, and in turn Sherlock didn't know that Mary didn't know. Perhaps he was under the false impression that husbands and wives tell each other everything, but considering that was not the case in this household John could only hope that Sherlock didn't betray him and this great big conspiracy. Mary's knowledge of the house wouldn't corrupt anything of course, but it might just make things more difficult. It might blend these two worlds more than John would have liked, and force his wife to linger a bit too much into his past. He had a feeling the house wouldn't appreciate meddlers, especially if that meddler was the very person who was keeping Sherlock and John apart. If they had a past romance, or even a past life at all, well certainly the house wouldn't like Mary's interference in what might be considered destiny. When finally the dishes were cleared and Sherlock made his compliments to Mary's cooking, John found himself alone in the sitting room with his acquaintance. Well, they weren't entirely alone, for Rosie was crawling about the carpet after having finished her minuscule little bites of chicken. Yet considering she was not a proper witness, John considered himself safe to talk freely. Mary was washing the dishes in the other room (Sherlock offered his assistance, yet Mary insisted that the boys go and talk their professional business), and so it was just the two of them sitting here with their half drained wine glasses. Sherlock was on what was presumably his third glass, for he really didn't want to say no, and Mary didn't like seeing an empty glass at her table. While his cheeks were getting a little bit flustered he didn't appear to be feeling the consequences of such overconsumption, in fact he seemed perfectly calm. They sat here in the calm quiet of the crackling fire, one which was actually a fake fireplace which spewed out heat and the occasional crackling sound effect. Yet it did the trick, enough so that it could set the mood of relaxation.
"I never thought I'd see you this excited." John admitted finally, feeling the need to change the conversation before he incriminated himself anymore. Sherlock smiled a bit innocently, dropping his gaze to the floor as if he was ashamed to have betrayed himself with all of this enthusiasm.
"Thanks for coming." John muttered a bit uncomfortably, now that Sherlock had made himself comfortable in one of the chairs that sat on the other side of the desk. He looked just about as nervous as John was, as if they were both struggling some with their actions of the other night. They both had regrets, perhaps all the while John was laboring under his own stupidity of yelling, Sherlock was also wishing he had never made some certain confessions. Well hopefully he didn't owe the argument to that confession; hopefully he didn't assume that John was angry at him only for his sexuality?
"I've seen that key before." the boy said thoughtfully, squatting down next to it and moving to pick it up from where it lay.
"It's just crazy that you use those words so carelessly now. Reincarnation...like it's no big deal at all." Sherlock said with a little chuckle.
"Not just that, no there may have been something more dignified. Maybe I had loved that man, maybe we had a relationship. But there was something incredibly crude in the act. Something that made it seem like...like there was no real meaning in it at all." Sherlock admitted quietly.
"Well I can pour it myself if you think yourself above such a task." John responded a bit hotly. Mary shot him a warning glance, yet continued on getting three wine glasses from the cupboard.
"Watch yourself, Professor." Sherlock warned after a moment's pause, although he sounded more regretful than hostile. "You're a married man, and you're drawing dangerously close to flirtation."
"So what if you're straight, so what if I'm not, so what about orientation, John this is life and death? I am going to die, you might die, my God do you see this hospital band on my arm? The doctor told me today, he gave me my death sentence, you can't just ignore this and let it get worse!" Sherlock growled, shaking his head in exasperation and taking a step forward. This time John didn't step back. He seemed to loosen, he seemed to drop his shoulders and hang his head, suddenly he was recovering from the shock and understanding the severity of it all.
"And the same face, and body type, and skin color, and eyes? Ancestry is just resemblance, not cloning." Sherlock said flatly. John shook his head in denial, not able to do anything but protest at this moment in time.
"Why'd he pull you out?" Sherlock wondered curiously. John sighed heavily, shaking his head before dropping the poker back on the rack and going to sit on the floor, leaning his back against the couch Sherlock was lying on and stretching his feet out towards the warmth of the flames.
"So what was this business then, this great trip you went on?" Mary asked as she handed Sherlock a glass, and then one to John. They were quiet as they took their first sips, yet John shortened his appreciation of the flavor so as to be the first to answer.
Sherlock had been immortalized in that position for a reason, so that years later, centuries later, John Watson would sit at his desk and stare at it. Stare at it so intensely that he didn't notice the man at the door, the man who was chuckling at John's dropped jaw.
"Not if I'm not there to explain it to her." John said sharply. Sherlock nodded, yet he could obviously see when it was past his time to leave. Surely he couldn't expect to lay about on that couch any longer, now that John had shouldered his bag and headed out the door.
"Just as you said, I have the strong inclination to say no." Sherlock repeated, forcing a sad little smile before turning his head away. "I don't know what our lives were like after that house, if we ever made it out alive that is. But I can guess that place wasn't made for people who had the capability of families. I don't think it was made for...well I guess people like you."
"Sherlock, make yourself comfortable, please." John said with a little grin, trying now to act like a proper host. Sherlock nodded, yet his coat was already missing and his bag was sitting by the door. Obviously John was a little late for the preliminary mannerisms.
"Sherlock, do you mind stepping inside for a moment? I've got to show you something." John muttered just as soon as Sherlock was within earshot. He nodded eagerly, as if he was just happy to be included once more in this little adventure, their shared ghost story as he was so anxious to call it.
"You've been having nightmares, haven't you honey?" Mary asked quietly, leaning up against the counter with that everlasting look of concern on her face. The microwave hummed as it spun around that little bottle of milk, for Rosie when she finally woke up.
"Well I suppose you'll have to manage. You can call your mother, have her help out. Besides, I'll be back on Friday at the latest." John suggested. Mary's voice faltered, and she crossed her arms across her chest with a frown appearing on her face.
"Says you, with no family to look after. I'm usually back by four, they'll be worried sick!" John exclaimed.
"But we are...well we were. That's not the point, John that's not the point. I just came back from the hospital." Sherlock said quickly, standing where he was and noticing John take a quick step so as to ensure his balance, his face draining of all color for the slightest moment before he regained some sort of confidence.
"Why do you hope so, Professor?" Sherlock asked carefully. John sighed, shrugging his shoulders and feeling a little bit uncomfortable under Sherlock's glare. The boy seemed to be reading his mind, or at least attempting to. Those eyes seemed capable of such acts; Sherlock Holmes seemed like the kind of boy who had the ability.
"Are you feeling any better honey?" Mary asked sweetly, hovering by the counter as John leaned over his breakfast, still unable to eat. The eggs and bacon which usually made his stomach growl in urgency were instead making him feel as though he was going to be sick.
"Well then, down we go." John said nervously, stepping down onto the first step and descending slowly and carefully. It didn't seem too extraordinary; there was a large boiler in the corner, undoubtedly responsible for the oil or heat. There was a water tank, and some discarded furniture, and a ton of boxes scattered about.
"If we're going to be a family, perhaps we should." He offered quietly, though with such a voice that it sounded like he was forcing the words out. As if he had thought of them for the longest while, and at last had decided to say them aloud.
me?" John growled, taking a step forward to which the student just squealed again, curling his long, lean body up into a protective ball behind one of the office chairs, as if that was going to protect him from anymore of John's future violence. John stopped his advancing, seeing now that the boy was legitimately terrified, and yet he didn't stop to think for a moment. Anger was clouding his judgment, and his common sense, and instead of stopping to ask himself how this boy had gotten into his house, and disappeared before his very eyes, and appeared so lifelike in his dreams...well no! Those would require paranormal explanations, and John was determined to be rational. He wanted to believe what was in front of his eyes, this logical explanation, this cowering and terrified boy.
"No." Sherlock said quietly, phrasing his words very carefully, as if he was afraid to say something wrong, as if he was afraid to trigger any more of John's little breakdowns. He took another deep breath, rattling the air between his lips yet pausing, thoughtfully. "No I don't. But I do think there's something going on, something I can't entirely explain." John blinked hopefully, nodding his head in relief. And so finally, someone understood! Someone felt it to, someone acknowledged that the house, the key, they were both driving forces to insanity!
"Convenient." Sherlock commented quietly. There was some apprehension in Sherlock's voice, almost as if he was worried that John had intentions of this night, intentions that were not shared. Well of course that would be of the romantic nature, considering they had only just discovered their interesting history earlier this afternoon. Sherlock might be worried that John intended on using that to his own advantage, perhaps he was apprehensive that this evening might turn into something more awkward for the both of them. And yet he could rest assured, John didn't intend to try anything tonight. He was getting just as weary as Sherlock; the day's adventures were starting to weigh heavily on him, and his eyelids were falling with every spark that he attempted to strike over top of the logs.
"That wasn't me! God it wasn't me, it was something else, some other influence. You know that I'd never actually say stuff like that! You know that I'd never disrespect you! I of all people know that our past lives don't reflect our current ones. I of all people know that." John insisted in a whine. Sherlock hesitated, his resistance dropping for just a moment as he considered what John was saying. Yet that resistance alone made it clear that he was willing to cooperate. That made it clear that he was at least willing to hear what John had to say.
"Aha!" he exclaimed, sounding completely unfazed by the moment they had just shared, presumably because he had not realized enough to label it as such.
But he was at a loss. Obviously Sherlock couldn't have taken that picture, obviously the Sherlock that stood before him was completely separate from the one in this century old picture. "But how?" was all John could choke out any longer.
"No, I feel nothing, Professor. I just know for sure that I never told you my last name." Sherlock said finally. John blinked, feeling his limbs tense up in panic as he tried to decipher what that sentence could even mean. He stared into Sherlock's eyes, knowing of course what colors to expect to find in his irises, knowing what secrets the colors were trying to hide. John knew the secrets, yet he couldn't call upon them at the moment. He couldn't do anything but stare, and try to remember if he really had been told Sherlock's last name. Sherlock Holmes's last name. And then, in an instant, he snatched the key back from the student's hand and pocketed it anxiously.
"I wasn't really listening." John lied, for he just wanted to keep this conversation focused on Sherlock. He didn't like the idea of the focus shifting upon him, and the dreams he had. He didn't want to discuss his topic of conversation at that table, with the straight forward, smoking Sherlock.
"Mm." Sherlock muttered, rearranging himself on the couch so that his arm draped down to the floor, so long that almost his full forearm could press against the carpet without strain. John watched him quietly, trying to understand what sort of game he was playing here. "I'm sure she must be the love of your life."
"No boxes or anything." he commented with some disappointment, pulling a sheet off of one of the wardrobe and examining the beautiful carved woodwork. Why such a beautiful piece of furniture would be stashed in the attic really was something of a mystery. There were just some old suits hanging inside, nothing of overwhelming importance or value. Sherlock gave a little sigh of annoyance, yet he closed the door and moved now to the desk.
"Because it appears that I wrote it." John whispered, just now straightening himself up on the mattress yet staying seated, so as to curl into that ball of shame. Sherlock hesitated for a moment, staring at John as if to wonder what ever that could mean.
As expected, everything was just as they left it. It seemed that nothing had been disturbed in their short absence; however they weren't here to investigate every room. They were focusing today mainly on the attic and basement, where they assumed it would be most likely to find things of interest. They were looking for answers, mostly on who their new mystery man was, yet also in the search for more answers on the past. John wanted to find out everything he could, and of course he wanted some evidence to prove that perhaps there was nothing romantic going on between Sherlock and that man. He wanted proof that there were many men, and that nothing distinguished that one from the rest. If Sherlock was so set on finding his soulmate then he might just have to look in the area of things he saw as impossible. Perhaps he had to realize that a century's worth of history together might hold more weight than did a simple golden band.
Thankfully Sherlock arrived right on time, just soon enough so that John would not lose his mind any longer. With every passing minute he had become more anxious, yet it was a lot better to watch the clock count towards three o'clock than away from it. The question of what to say was a lot easier to answer than whether or not Sherlock was coming at all, and so thankfully as the clock struck three there was a knock at the door. His perfect timing definitely betrayed his own urgency, for John could only assume that the boy had been struggling with his own questions, he may have been sitting out in the hallway, agonizing for a while over what to say, and who owed who an apology. As soon as the door opened John straightened up in his chair, staring up at Sherlock and feeling as though his breath had been lost from his body. He felt entranced, in a way, as he stared up to the man who walked in. That beautiful man, who took each stride as elegantly as possible, and who was now closing the door softly behind him.
"Yes, it would appear so." Mrs. Hudson agreed, handing the document over to John with something of a regretful sigh. Maybe she thought it was a sensitive subject, but then again John had to have known his long lost ancestor was dead? Obviously anyone who had the word "great" in their name must be a loss that wasn't too painful to accept.
"I won't get bored of the first, Greg. I know a bachelor like you won't understand what it's like to be in love, but I can assure you it doesn't just end." John taunted.
"My God, it's the robe." John whispered. Sherlock took a great breath, and with something of a deep blush he slammed the wardrobe door shut, so violently that it shook the entire floor. John jumped back in surprise, not having expected such a violent reaction out of the man. Yet it was as though that robe scared him, it was if none of this had been real until he had found that garment, hanging in wait for him to find it once more.
"Look at his picture then, scroll down." Sherlock insisted. John sighed, pounding a bit on the down arrow (to which Sherlock winced) and just now seeing a large portrait of a man standing up near what looked to be a large, French style building. Only half of his face was visible, the other half was cloaked in shadow, yet it was undeniably him. A modern day Victor Trevor, half of his face matching almost perfectly with the drawing that Sherlock had done. John nodded his head, pushing the laptop away before he had to look at anything more. He really did hate to have to see this, Victor's arrival into his life cut like a dagger and he wasn't even here yet! Certainly when Victor made his grand entrance everything that John had with Sherlock would be lost, ruined with this horrible man! This man who Sherlock would undoubtedly prefer.
Sherlock put their doorbell in the freezer on Halloween. The rising popularity of the holiday in the UK meant they actually got a few trick-or-treaters, and none of the inhabitants of flat 221B wanted to hear that racket the day before reckoning.
They smiled goofily at each other for a minute, then John looked away, afraid his face would show just
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Yes. I spent hours running it through different audio analysis programs. I’ll listen to it with you again, and then show you my research.”
Sherlock put down his chopsticks and sat back in his chair. “Think of it this way. Maybe Robert and Maria are stuck in an unhappy marriage. Maybe Maria is experiencing a mental breakdown, and that is the thing taking a toll on their marriage. These sightings of shadow people are simply an externalization of everything wrong in their marriage. They can't face the reality that the only thing wrong in their lives is their failing union.” He waited for John to reply, then added on a frustrated “What?” when he stayed silent.
John turned toward the half-familiar voice, already dreading the conversation with whomever it was—the shock at his changed appearance, the pity at his new lot in life, the stilted goodbyes after they’d ground out small talk. He was still trying to place the vaguely familiar, round, cheery face when the man in front of him took the work out of his hands.
“You really didn’t need to come,” John tried to convince her as she doctored her tea. He put the tray on the coffee table and sat next to Sherlock. When he looked up from his own cup, her face had lost the usual “I’m quirky and mischievous!” expression. She looked serious.
Sherlock scanned the brief email, which stated only a time and place to meet—Sofia, Bulgaria, two days hence. He sighed and chucked the phone across the room and onto the sofa.
Torres looked older and more tired than he had in the last video John had seen of him. His hair was a bit grey, and there were dark circles under his eyes. He nodded at them.
He’d almost walked out when Mike pitched the column at that first meeting. It was to be a weekly series, each post focusing on a different interesting job or lifestyle. It was work for a first-time journalist, not a seasoned war vet. But … he really needed the money, and he figured he’d do a few posts until he could find something meatier to write about. He’d make it work.
“Ah yes, the second thing.” Sherlock steepled his hands in front of his lips in his usual thinking pose but kept his eyes on John while he continued.
“I’m not,” John said. “But I also know you can’t out-stubborn a Holmes, and I’ve got too many other things to worry about.
“Black’s compositions?” John thought back to what Simon had told them months before. About people listening to the songs John had posted on his blog, and that Dabic and Wendt had put out for downloading. That the songs wouldn’t need to be played specifically at the ceremony, because they were being played around the world by unsuspecting listeners. “Why am I only hearing about this now?”
John got no new mysterious texts, and he was glad for it. He also found no new information on Victor. He’d even asked Mycroft, who had told him the same as what Sherlock had. He wouldn’t even confirm the exact nature of their relationship. So John put that investigation on the back burner and let himself delve into the cases he’d actually set out to write about.
“Seriously, Sherlock? We get told just hours ago that there are some very bad people who want you, and you’re just going to shrug it off and say it’s nothing more than a silly conspiracy?”
“He’s attached some scans of what looks like music composition? He also says to look into an Alexander Scriabin.” He looked up to see Sherlock refilling his tea cup. “Oh. Thanks.”
“No. Mother was an only child, and Dad’s only sibling had no children. We’re the last of the lot,” Eurus explained cheerfully. She crossed her arms on the table and leaned forward. “So. Dish.”
As soon as the door downstairs banged shut, Sherlock smiled widely, jumped in the air, and raised his fists. “Oh, it’s Christmas. A fresh victim
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth went up. “That you are. Well then. Shall we go?” He waved the server down for the bill, and then they headed out into the cold January night.
Sherlock shrugged half-heartedly and looked down at his hands folded in his lap. “My parents were quite ordinary, and you know how Mycroft is. It could be just a me thing, with Eurus allowing it. She’s always been the most sensitive of the three of us. We were close as children you know. Each other’s only friend during our formative years.”
She glared and raised a hand to silence her brother. “I know, I didn’t think much of it either, but something John said today made me read through the comments again on the way over just now, and I found it. The countdown ends the first of November.”
“Before written history,” Simon explained. “All those oral stories handed down through different religions, talk of floods and fiery hail. Not completely off their mark.”
Sadly, if you’re reading this, I won’t be back next week with a new file. But even in death, I remain your intrepid journalist—or blogger, or whatever I am now—John Watson.
“I … wanted to control the narrative as much as possible. As you say, my followers tend toward the conspiracy theorists.
They spent a little longer talking with Fred and a few patients familiar with the two young men, then headed back to London. Without solving it, of course. Granted, they rarely solved their cases in an afternoon. If it was good enough to get Sherlock out of the house, it was good enough to challenge him for at least a few days, if not longer. Still, John was pretty sure this one would end up a scarlet file. Sherlock might be fine calling it mass hysteria and a troubled genius, but something about that bothered John.
draw symbols that teleport him to another place so that he can kill people. It’s a case of two ill individuals in a feedback loop.”
John is tired. Rosie has been crying for hours—teething again—but that’s just the straw the breaks the camel’s back. In truth, John has been tired for months, since the aquarium, no, since his lying wife shot his best friend—she, pregnant and unapologetic, he, being the helpful and loving person John hadn’t realized for too long that he was.
There was a quiet sigh. “Look after him? Please?” This made John turn to face Sherlock’s older brother. He knew that look. That fierce protection, that worry. It was how he felt growing up with an out-of-control little sister, it was how he’d been feeling as he watched Sherlock spiral, as he watched conspiracy converge around his friend.
The two men avoided looking at each other. The L word hadn’t been uttered yet, though they both knew that’s what it was. It felt safer, though, not saying it quite yet.
John skidded to a halt between the single central boulder and the two in front of it that formed the hell gate (hellmouth, his giddy brain told him).
He didn’t expect anything to come of the call, except for two things: one, the professor mentioned there had never been a music program at Bath, meaning Black hadn’t gone there or at least not for a music degree; and two, the pictures she sent of some cave paintings near the field where Black had been during his midnight excursion.
Sherlock’s brow furrows a moment, but slowly, John’s meaning dawns. Before he speaks, the frown returns to his face. He doesn’t just look frustrated, though, he looks vulnerable. “Then why won’t you stay for good?”
Sherlock shut the microscope off and closed his notebook. “Nothing. It’s … nothing.” He stood up and looked around the flat. John followed his gaze, noting the place was as messy as it had been the last time.
After the meeting with Robert, they called Maria Torres to hear her side. Her list of events matched Robert’s pretty well. Sherlock, of course, got into an argument with her about whether she was unconsciously making things up. John managed to call a cease fire.
Rather than answering, Sherlock stalked to the door, and after taking a moment to abandon their drinks, John hurried after.
John took it for the olive branch it was—the man had outright apologized once today, and John didn’t expect it to happen a second time—and nodded. “Fine.”
you stop him? I don’t like it.” If the boy was lying, he was damned good at it. He looked genuinely frightened—eyes wide, fingers worrying cuticles.
Holmes frowned. “It’s my job to question everything. If it weren’t for me, people would go on believing, for example, that the woods of Dartmoor are haunted by a large demonic hound, instead of just being the nearby inn owners trying to drum up more business.”
“Hmmm. A way of organizing his world, perhaps. An attempt to bring logic by numbers to a world that doesn’t make sense,” Sherlock muttered, his eyes darting back and forth across the pictures.
Sherlock’s face scrunched up. “A couple of people have said that they like your drawings, and you connected that to Simon being your attacker?”
Mike nodded, pity in his expression. Here it went. “I heard. Sorry about that. You’ll be going back soon, though, right? When you’ve, uh, recovered.” His gaze skittered over John’s cane and leg.
John knew Sherlock wouldn’t be happy to discuss the sister he never mentioned, but his reaction seemed a little much, even for him. Eurus was right. He was insecure about her ability to make friends and not let her brain take over her every waking moment or something. John sympathized with his friend. He and Harry had a similar relationship.
The longer they talked, the more exhausted Robert looked. Like just reliving it took another five years of his life. John couldn’t even imagine dealing with all of this, even if it had a reasonable explanation. The not knowing would drive him mad.
“Yes.” John hoped this was going where he thought it was going. If he had to sit in a gray office and write another dreadful article on some frightfully dull subject, he’d chuck his walking stick at someone.
“I know what to look for, John,” Sherlock explained when John shared his frustration with him one morning over breakfast. “Don’t forget that not only have I been doing this for years, but I have three degrees. I was just as lost as you when I started out.”
John rolled his eyes. “No, someone I met at the coffee shop last week.” It had been a bit unexpected. Their orders had got switched, and after they’d straightened it all out, they’d ended up chatting for half an hour. John wasn’t looking for anyone right now—Sherlock kept him busy enough—but he wasn’t about to look a gift horse in the mouth. If nothing else, she’d be good for letting off a little steam.
Having more than his share of emotions for the moment, Sherlock leaped to his feet and crossed the room to his violin. John watched as he warmed up and started playing. He had a sheet of paper in front of him—composing then. The sound was odd, though. More atonal than his usual compositions. Screeching violin was nothing new to Baker Street, but usually it was reserved for scaring off anyone Sherlock didn’t want to talk to. He’d never actually sat down and composed such odd music. John shrugged. They were in a weird place these days, not surprising that it would come out in Sherlock’s music.
Sherlock took it but only looked at it perplexed. “I … received a message, after you mentioned Victor in your blog.”
When things finally resolved between them, it wasn’t the way John had imagined it. He had many possible scenarios, with every permutation of actions, charted out in his head. He’d discarded half of those when his own (sort of) declaration did not produce disgust or contempt in Sherlock. Those remaining ran the gamut from falling into bed together during a post-case high to impassioned declarations of love to sweet kisses after looking at each other just a little to long. Sherlock’s reactions ran from dramatic to shy to happy to even annoyed (just because he fell prey to a weak emotion like love didn’t mean he had to like it).
John pinched the bridge of his nose. Was Sherlock being purposefully obtuse? “Look at the main figure, the taller one.”
Not only was he behind in posts, but he needed to work on creating a backlog of them, just in case things got hectic, as he was assuming they would. The only word from Simon so far was “wait,” and Victor was MIA. Mycroft was working on something big elsewhere (John had needed to look up 'squamous' after Sherlock’s latest vague explanation; it didn’t help), and Eurus was in a flurry of short story writing, so it was just the two of them in the center of the storm. Sherlock had worked through his inbox in less than a week. He hadn’t stopped complaining about his boredom since. John was hoping he’d decide to blow up the kitchen, just to keep him distracted.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, and stood up, pulling John with him. “You’ll have to use voice-to-text for your next few posts.” He stroked John’s splinted wrist.
The “yes” leaves John’s lips, but he has no air to fully push the word out. He clears his throat, nods, and tries again. “Yes, we– we’ll move back–” but the air leaves his sails before he can finish. Space. There’s not enough. “There’s not enough.”
It turned out Eurus would be in London for a writing workshop a week after John emailed her, so they agreed to meet for lunch. John arrived first, having stormed out of the flat after one of the usual tiffs with Sherlock, who was still in a right state, their talk about Eurus having only been a reprieve. He’d worked out most of his frustration on the long walk to the restaurant and was now feeling anxious for Sherlock’s sister to arrive. He wondered if she had Sherlock and Mycroft’s gift for observation. Was she acerbic like Sherlock or shiftily diplomatic like Mycroft? Did she still believe in the paranormal?
John shrugged. “We’re up against possible child killers trying to end the world, and he hasn’t slept soundly in five months because of nightmares and sleepwalking. Would your music be cheerful if you were going through that?”
“Uh, no …” John scanned the email. “He says he’s in Russia. He’s tracked down a composer who claims to be able to neutralize the Unsound. Percival Black, you heard of him?”
“I heard ya.” John turned a page of the newspaper and forced himself not to look up at Sherlock. He was already aware of the ways he tried to get attention and was determined not to give in to the man.
Sherlock was still staring outside when John brought their mugs into the lounge and joined him at the window.
“A bit dramatic, don’t you think?” Sherlock asked Simon, who looked very unconcerned despite the complicated route he’d made them take to the location.
John leaned back and closed his eyes. Sherlock had been off lately. Distracted, muttering odd things under his breath, spending all his time in his room. John should be happy he’d come out long enough to have an argument, not to mention the fact that he’d argued at all. The few times he’d left his room the past few days, he’d barely said anything, a few grunts at most. He’d looked sleep deprived, and twice John had found him staring into space. John wasn’t sleeping well either, and he wondered if Sherlock’s mood was affecting him.
“Be safe.” He lifted up on his toes to place a kiss over each eye, then pressed another to Sherlock’s lips.
“Where were you stationed, Afghanistan or Iraq? You’re a war correspondent, obvious from your hands, face, and pockets. Could be any of the smaller countries with their civil wars, but you’re tanned, so somewhere sunny. You were injured, so somewhere dangerous. You’ve got a psychosomatic limp and probably some PTSD as well. It could be somewhere in Africa, but the pendant around your neck suggests Middle East. Where are the most likely places in the Middle East to find a war correspondent? Afghanistan or Iraq?”
John would’ve written the excursion off as meditation by a composer trying to write—he’d seen Sherlock do some pretty odd things when composing after all—except that the flatmate mentioned the field was a local gathering place for witches. The man put John in touch with a professor at the University of Bath, where Black had attended.
John headed for the kitchen with a shrug. “I don’t know that we have much of a choice. Eurus is an adult. We can’t really stop her.”
. It’s basically the same thing. Parodos was the first song sung by a chorus during Greek plays. Epiparodos is similarly used at the end. There are two more nods to Taz’s writing in this story (both toward the end). If there are any Locked Tomb fans reading this, I hope you find them!
“I’m your landlady, not your assistant, Sherlock!” called Mrs. Hudson from the foot of the stairs. “Get the file yourself.”
Robert nodded. “She heard things too. Voices when nobody was home. Sometimes she would lose time, an hour here or there. It was her that decided to call the priest and eventually the paranormal investigators.” He sighed and rubbed his eyes. “She was reasonable about the whole thing at first. Pragmatic. She treated it like a cockroach infestation, or termites. But that didn't last. And pretty soon, she was … acting different. Crazy. She became
John walked over to the side of the desk he’d claimed as his own, grabbed the folder he’d placed there earlier, and dropped it on Sherlock’s lap. “The Unsound.”
“Or what makes someone with a recently deceased loved one think the strange noises in their house are the result of a ghost?”
“Seeing the tall men was about it for me. Sherlock, though, he … knew things,” Eurus mused, playing with her silverware.
“Well who else could it have been? We went straight from Trent’s to Simon’s room and back again. It had to be Trent.” John wasn’t sure who he was trying to convince, Sherlock or himself. It was all so strange. Then again, most of what he’d encountered since moving in at Baker Street had been more than a little odd and unexplainable.
They looked at each other for longer than necessary, and the tension between them changed. These little moments confused John. He was never sure if Sherlock was just trying to get a read on him as a human being, or if there was a deeper interest involved. It
“And like I said, I’ll put up with that shit because you’re also brilliant and you help the police for free and take charity cases that don’t really have anything to do with the paranormal. You dote on Mrs. Hudson, and you’re trying to be nicer to Molly. You play the violin when I can’t sleep. You force me to view the world through a different lens and challenge me to think deeper. You’re amazing, and I’m proud I have you as my best friend.”
John searched the screen. “No.” Then something to the side caught his eye. “Wait. Maybe … I see a … shadow?”
“It would’ve been nice if we could’ve gone in, guns blazing with a whole army of secret service agents, though. Faster, at least. And I wouldn’t have broken my wrist.”
“Do you not want us here?” he finally asks, trying not to let despair fill him. He’s been happy here, and he thought Sherlock was happy with the arrangement as well. The frown on his face says otherwise though.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “If there’s a note, then the killer is obviously not a ghost, and therefore this case is outside my purview.”
Sherlock Holmes is a striking man—tall with dark curly hair, pale skin and nice cheekbones—but it’s the way he holds himself that sets him apart. There’s a self-assuredness to his posture. I can see why people might call him arrogant, but I think they’re reading him wrong. His icy eyes can pin you in place with a glance, which he uses to deduce your whole history in seconds. It’s disarming, but extraordinary. However, he’s not arrogant. Or, well, he definitely is, but I think it’s deserved. The man knows what he’s doing. He’s highly intelligent, able to see patterns where we normal people see coincidence or nothing at all.
Sherlock hummed and crossed his arms. John took a few more snaps before a rustling noise caught their attention.
“Camera there,” he continued, pointing to the ceiling corner containing the security camera. “Simon’s stayed on the whole time? No interruptions in the feed, blips that could mean it was tampered with?”
P.S. Glushka is pronounced Gloosh-kuh, Cenophus is Sen-uh-fuss, and Gigas is Gee-gus (both hard G sounds).
John took a moment to look at Sherlock—the reason he was there that day, the man he didn’t want to live without. Feeling John’s gaze, Sherlock turned his head, his expression of concentration softening for just a moment into a small smile. John turned and took his hand with one of his own, the other going up to the back of Sherlock’s neck. He pulled their heads together. “Stay safe out there. We have things to do after.”
“It was studied by the likes of Pythagoras and Kepler, yes, but it’s also thought to have occult properties. Satan wanting to usurp the perfect math that God created, bringing chaos to order, et cetera.” Sherlock waved a dismissive hand. “But these equations accompanying the Golden Ratio were used in medieval churches to create a devil’s door to allow evil spirits to escape during baptisms. But those were always on north walls,
“I think it’s good, though, that some of these things are coming to a head. He needs to face his demons.”
She sipped her tea. “I was a light sleeper, and I’d hear him get up sometimes. One time, early on, I thought he was making hot cocoa, and I wanted some so I got up and followed him, but he didn’t go to the kitchen. He went to the porch and stared out through the doors to the back garden.” She frowned and rubbed an arm. “Just … stared. I tried talking to him, but he wouldn’t reply. I must’ve been four at the time, so you were five.” She swung her gaze to study her brother. “Were you looking at the tall men?”
“Yeah, things settled,” Robert said. “I didn’t feel like I was being followed, the noises and sightings stopped. It was calm … at first. But then, things had become very strained between me and Maria. She was consulting psychics, mediums, spending a lot of money. We fought a lot. I told her what Mr. Holmes said, that it was just apoph– apophenia. She wouldn't listen, she was really worried about our son.”
“Okay.” John wasn’t understanding the connection. Different locations, different types of events, different filming devices.
“Just said to ask about it … or them. I took the liberty of checking your scarlet files. There’s one labeled Eurus. I didn’t read it or watch the DVD. I’m giving you a chance to tell me first. But I
was going to dig up your past. This way, I’ve got yours and Mycroft’s words telling the real story, rather than letting someone find it and make up their own account about it. I
For now, though, he was content to have some peace and quiet, as much as one could get of either around Sherlock Holmes. He knew that soon enough, he’d be woken up at 3am to go search a tip or he’d be banging around some back alley, chasing after Sherlock. He—they—deserved a rest for a while. And he’d make sure they got it. For a few days at least.
He was out of his chair and following the paranormal investigator down the stairs before Sherlock had time to rescind the invitation.
It was quiet for about two minutes, both of them lying side by side. John didn’t even know if Sherlock knew he was awake. It wasn’t an awkward wait. In fact, John started drifting off while he waited for whatever else might happen. Then Sherlock slide closer until his forehead (maybe?) touched the side of John’s shoulder. He let out a sigh as his hands lightly clutched John’s arm.
Sherlock scooted close, facing John, so John mirrored him and put his top arm around Sherlock, his hand landing comfortingly on his lower back. They shared a pillow, their breath mingling. They said nothing for a time, just stared at each other in the dark, moonlight highlighting parts of their faces. Sherlock put a hand to the side of John’s neck, stroking his pulse point with his thumb. Perhaps it calmed him, feeling something so physically present, something so alive.
“Plus,” Sherlock rushed to continue, finally looking at John with big eyes, “I lost the rest of my team, they wouldn’t work with me. I need help with the Work. I can pay you. It should give you enough for your part of the rent plus expenses.”
John couldn’t make much of it, so he shared it with Sherlock, who sighed when the video popped up. They were sat on the sofa, closer together than usual so they could view the screen together, and John felt the friction between Sherlock’s arm and his own when either moved.
“Not in the beginning, no. He watched Sherlock just as carefully as Mother did. They were inseparable, and not in a good way. But when they visited home during the summer hols after their second year of uni, he was different. He had that same infatuated-happy look Sherlock did. He was less detached and cold. He looked like he wanted to be with Sherlock forever. Until he disappeared, that is.”
“And then she moved out?” Sherlock continued. John ceded the questioning to the other man, knowing he knew what to ask more than John would. Plus, he was interested to see Sherlock’s process in action.
Of course he was keeping apprised of John’s research. Lazy arse just didn’t want to do the boring bits. John rolled his eyes but joined in the pleading.
“Hello, Eurus. You’re looking well. In town for a workshop, are we? Lovely to see you. What. Are. You. Doing. Here?” He tried to spin back to the window, but John caught his elbow.
John smiles. “Much.” He scratches the back of his neck. “And… thank you. I’m sorry for just passing her over and hiding, but–”
Sherlock stiffened. “Well, I guess it’s good this came out before we’d worked together too long. As soon as we return to London, I can give you your last paycheck and–”
Sherlock nods, but he still looks a bit confused. He adjusts, though, and the day is spent happily. They stay the night, and Sherlock doesn’t question it. John feels the same contentedness and peace he did last time they stayed over.
She scowled. “I’m the only one left. You know you’ll have to physically play live if you’re to combat everyone playing it on their music players at home.”
Sherlock doubled down on his point, but John could tell it was partially from guilt. He’d been there before himself.
Trent frowned. “I hadn’t. Not before the attack. I’ve only been here a month, and we’re not in the same wing, so we don’t do any group activities together. I haven’t even seen him before. But …” He scrubbed his face. He looked troubled. “This girl came up to me one day and said, ‘Simon likes your drawings.’ But I
Sherlock huffed but nodded his head. John gave a discreet nod to Fred behind Sherlock’s back to indicate he’d make sure his colleague behaved.
Sherlock did raise a good point. John had gone into active battle zones just to ensure his information was accurate, so why should he shy away from a sound that urban myth
The case of Sherlock’s mysterious room happenings plus the anonymous text about Eurus came to head when John brought Sherlock some food, in attempt to both force-feed him and do a little recon. Knocking hadn’t worked over the last few days, so he just took a page from Sherlock’s book and barged in.
They were both restless. They couldn’t focus on cases, they were barely getting a couple of hours of sleep a night. They clung to each other, hiding away from everyone else. They might have stayed that way, but for the knock on their door toward the end of October.
He was looking at a map of South England, and he realized the route drawn in red marker was familiar to him. “Victor?”
Sherlock ducked his head and stared at his mug, which was both unusual for him and adorable. John thought he saw a little flush on his cheeks too. Definitely adorable.
“I think she made Mycroft take her home to use his spa bathroom,” Sherlock said before playing the first few bars of a new song he said he was calling either “The Scarlet Files” or “John.”
Eurus hummed. “I would say, better you than me, but I apparently will reap the ‘benefits’ of living with Sherlock now too.”
Over the next few days, John went off on his own for interviews with a professor of religious studies, Keith Dabic himself, and Jeff Wendt’s mother, but didn’t come up with much more than he already knew from Sherlock’s research. The more he talked to people who all believed in the Unsound, though, the more unnerved he felt. If these crazy stories were true, he’d be dead in less than a year. Then again, he kind of hadn’t expected to live through his last job, but he’d come through with only a bullet wound and nightmares as souvenirs. Dabic seemed to believe he had less than three months to live, given when he first heard the sound. John guessed he’d be safe enough waiting until Dabic’s death date had passed before freaking out.
a drama queen. This whole …” John waved his hands, “thing is perfect for you. I don’t understand why you’re fighting it.”
John refrained (barely) from rolling his eyes. “Isn’t the truth more important than having another ghost story to tell? You’re an investigator, right? Going along with the ghost story rather than actually looking into the facts would be like if I wrote an article about possible leaks in the government without looking into whether they were true, just because it would put more eyes on my page. My job isn’t about sensationalism, it’s about getting the truth out to the public.”
It looked like a black charcoal or burn stain along the back wall. Because of the topic of their conversation, John could imagine it looked like the face from Munch’s
“I’ve got to run. My friend is in the city for the day, so I’m going to go meet up with her. Can I drop by tomorrow? We can talk more then.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and slumped into one of the chairs, John following suit. “And now that we’re here, is there a purpose for calling us all this way from home?”
John felt something well up inside him as she talked. Part of him was jealous that this boy had known Sherlock before he’d put up his walls. Part of him was glad Sherlock had someone to lean on, someone who understood him. And part of him was just happy to be getting any information on Sherlock that didn’t come straight from the man’s stubbornly schtum lips.
at him, John pivoted and quickly pulled his friend into a tight hug, tucking Sherlock’s head into his shoulder. Sherlock shuddered and put his arms around John’s waist.
The sun had come out from behind the clouds, and a small but bright stream of light filtered through one of the window shutter cracks. The light sat perfectly in the center of a ring of drawn symbols, and it was in the shape of a cross.
shown my drawings to anyone else. Not even my therapist. And …” he shuddered. “I’ve heard a young man’s voice say the same when I’m alone in my room. ‘I like your drawings.’”
“No. No,” John argued. “You don’t get to do this now. This is serious, Sherlock. You could be in real danger, from real people.”
“Really, John?” Simon’s tone made him sound eerily similar to Sherlock again. John wondered if that was natural or an affectation to throw him off. “For the demons, of course. They’ve been locked in a hell dimension for millennia. They want to come back through, rule the earth again.”
Though Sherlock was finally convinced it was worth looking into, he wasn’t ready to put his own time into what could be another dead end, so he sent John out to do the legwork. He interviewed Wendy in Germany, learned that along with the shadows and symbol, she often heard weird noises, like a wailing cat, outside their flat. As none of their neighbors had cats and they were on the tenth floor, the sound was a mystery. She emailed the baby monitor recordings to John, who sent it off to a sound guy he knew. While he waited on answers, he called the Hochmans’ English housekeeper, Maddie, who turned out to not be a lot of help. She hadn’t heard any noises or seen anything strange, and the Hochmans seemed like a perfectly normal family.
“You see the leaving. I see the coming back.” It’s not necessarily an admission, but he’s laying more cards on the table than he has up to this point.
John shifted in his seat. He didn’t remember anyone talking about demons having ruled the earth before. “Again?”
“Right. Yes.” Sherlock nodded and stood up. “Sorry. About. Well, not sorry for being upset. I still think I had every right. But, I do apologize for waking you up so early.”
And John ruined it by saying what had been on his mind for days, what he couldn’t hold back anymore. “I think we should team up with Simon.”
“Just … you know what you need to focus on. None of this means anything to me. Tell me what you find out.”
“There’s a countdown clock, Sher.” Eurus’ voice was wobbly and quiet, but she still managed to command the room.
“That’s just under two months from now,” John commented. “What’s going to happen then? What did the site say?”
When Mike asked me to start this new column—or whatever you call it on a blog—I was more than a little insulted. I was a war correspondent before this: hardened, tough, an adrenaline junkie. This job was meant to be a new start, sure, but still somewhat familiar to my old life. I thought I’d be taking on politics or white-collar criminals or society’s current downfalls. Interviewing people with odd jobs or interesting lives was not what I was expecting. And thankfully, that trajectory has changed. What started out as a special interest column has zeroed in to focus on one subject, one man.
With a nod, John turned to face him. “They wake us up two to three times a night. For months now, and we’re both sleepwalking.”
“And I’ll outwit them. Genius, remember? I think I can handle a few delusional conspiracy theorists.”
She gave him that same damned puppy dog look Sherlock gave when he wanted John to do something. He hated that expression.
“Needlessly dramatic is what it is.” Sherlock said. He came to stand close to John. Their jackets brushed.
“He was my friend. He disappeared. It was unfortunate, it upset me, but it has nothing to do with the paranormal.” Sherlock rose from his stool and exited through the kitchen door.
Simon grinned. “Ah yes. The Order played quite the trick there. And thanks to popular blogger John Watson, it worked.”
Sherlock, who had just come into the kitchen from his bedroom, where he’d been spending most of his time lately, grunted but didn’t enquire as to the reason for John’s expletive.
“They have many names,” he finally replied, looking back at Sherlock. “All you need to know is that dangerous people want you.”
it to be true. But if they were only on their second case and he was already chickening out, what use was it for him to continue?
I’ve pulled the first scarlet file case and some of the dialogue from The Black Tapes podcast transcript from episodes
“Lily!” She smiled and listened. “Yeah, in London for a bit, until Sher gets tired of me, at least.” She winked at her brother.
“Come on,” John wheedled. “People want to know what you do, your process, how you discern the fakers. And that includes those mysterious red folders.”
John didn’t agree, but nothing he said would change Sherlock’s mind. It was one thing to be able to debunk obviously fake reports of the paranormal, but this was someone grasping at straws to avoid what was plain to see: something strange was going on with the Hochmans, and real-world reasons wouldn’t be able to solve it. He left it alone for a while, focusing back on his investigations.
“No. The drawings were written on the walls, and they were more symbols than your usual art.” John retrieved a few pictures Fred had emailed him and slid them in front of Sherlock. They showed a white wall covered in black crayon or chalk—lots of numbers and symbols, the largest and most central a pentagram in a double circle.
“Oh, Sherlock didn’t tell you?” She dropped in the nearest seat. “He’s written a contrasting piece to the music being used to open the gates.”
Robert apparently thought so as well. “Yeah, you should be. The other paranormal investigators called it evil, said it was a malevolent spirit. Whatever it was, you told me you'd prove that they were just shadows, that there was nothing to be afraid of.”
“Is there anything else we need to know?” asked John, ready to be done with this meeting. “We have a four-hour drive back to London to make.”
And in the end, John doesn’t have to ask. Sherlock just knows, after a single survey of John’s person.
That night, they all went to bed early, though they knew none of them would sleep much. Still, there was something comforting about lying in bed, next to the one you loved most in the case of John and Sherlock, cocooned by their physical and emotional warmth. Most nights, they kept to their own sides of the bed when sleeping, both of them being so restless that there was a fear of being punched if they were too close, but by mutual, tacit agreement, they gravitated to each other as soon as they slid between the bedclothes that night.
The man who had just slid into the seat across from them was worn, tired, and older, but recognizably the boy from the pictures John had seen of Victor. He looked across the table at Sherlock, and though worry and vigilance overshadowed his expression, John caught a hint of longing there as well. Surprisingly, instead of jealousy, John only felt sympathy for him.
He thinks about it all the next day at work and that evening as he sits alone in his too quiet, too clean flat. He thinks about it the day after and the day after, home alone again, with no cases to pull him back to where he would much rather be.
“You’re intelligent—a genius in fact—you could have done anything: chemistry, physics, hell, you could have been a PI. What made you choose a field where you don’t believe any of the stories are true?”
It was Simon, waving for them to follow. They trekked a short distance through the trees until they reached a cave entrance. John and Sherlock stopped, glancing at each other.
John put out a calming hand. “Sorry, we should’ve asked first. Can we? Just the pages with the symbols. Not your private art.”
was a big magazine, to be sure, but it was indeed beat by—in his opinion—war journalism. But that was a life he was trying to forget. A life he
Sherlock turned away from the wall and smiled softly at John. “You’re picking this up rather well. Not quite the idiot most people are.”
John liked Eurus. She was the playful younger sister he’d never had, having never really got on with Harry, who was too much like himself. Plus, she was this wonderful, untapped source of information on Sherlock. He wondered why his flatmate never talked to her.
“Yeah, I think so.” The words are soft, but loud enough to be heard in their cocoon for two. His nose brushes warm skin.
Sherlock buried his head in a forensics journal and didn’t surface until after John had left the table to go shower.
Sherlock’s face went white and tight, as if he hadn’t realized what he had implied. “I didn’t mean– I’m sor–”
They finished their meal with more lighthearted chatter, Eurus talking about her writing and what had brought her to London. It was fun, talking with someone smart but less annoyed with humanity. He arrived home in a much better mood than he’d left it in. He was making tea when Sherlock strolled into the kitchen.
“Do you have to question everything? Has there never been a case that made you want to believe it was all true?”
There was movement across the field. People were bent over the ground, carefully sifting their own chalk/blood combo to create the necessary symbols. A group of children were huddled to one side, watched over by a man. John thought he recognized Sammy in the group, but it was hard to tell from the distance. Joining the four mini Stonehenge-like boulders, which John recognized from pictures, was a fifth boulder centered inside the others. The focal point. The linchpin. If it had been smaller, they might have been able to destroy it, but for a rock that size, they’d need explosives, which would put the children at risk.
In which John and Sherlock huddle for warmth, Eurus comes back, John leave the flat a lot to avoid sibling fighting, and Eurus talks her way into helping at the final showdown.
The second and third subjects proved to be equally ridiculous, but he was finally becoming intrigued. Not in the paranormal, but in a common subject among the three. All three investigators made offhand comments about one man: Sherlock Holmes.
“Because ninety-three percent of the time, it’s just idiotic charlatans, hoping to make some money or gain some followers or whatever it is humans enjoy having more of. Five percent of the time, it’s something like apophenia or the ideomotor effect. Two percent of the time, science is not sufficiently advanced enough to explain.” Sherlock slide his hand from John’s shoulder down his arm before drawing away to go perform his overwhelmed Regency heroine act on the sofa. His dressing gown fluttered as he landed. John was fairly certain he practiced to get it just right.
He’d been warned away from Sherlock. He’d been kidnapped by a man trying to frighten him away from Sherlock. He’d run through the cold night streets of London behind a madman. He’d been mistaken for Sherlock’s date twice. He’d been tricked out of needing his cane. He’d shot a man who it turned out had been staging his victims so it looked like a ghost had scared them to death. It was, without a doubt, the best night John had had in ages. Literally years, if not ever.
“Shit, no.” If they’d made it that far into the ritual, according to Simon’s final, secret email to him, then fixing the symbol was useless. There was only one thing left to do. He swept his gaze to Sherlock, still fighting against his attacker (and winning?).
His and Sherlock’s continued sleeplessness didn’t help. They were both irritable and short tempered, and John was having trouble thinking clearly. Every time he closed his eyes, specters and eerie symbols chased after him, causing death and chaos. He wondered briefly what was keeping Sherlock awake, but was too tired to even ask.
“Ugh. As terrible as that is, you won’t scare me away, Sher,” Eurus said, though she retreated from the chair to the kitchen. John joined her.
“Not now. I have more important things in my life to worry about. He texts and emails from time to time when he needs information I might know. I know he’s doing okay.” She looked sad but resigned, fine lines pulling at her forehead and mouth, but her eyes stayed soft. “I’ll happily welcome him with open arms if he ever wants that, but I won’t push.”
“I’m surprised he wanted you. You may be a genius, but Robert didn’t seem too happy with the results of your previous investigations for him.”
Sherlock looked pensive, so John didn’t push him. It wasn’t his stubborn look for when he kept things to himself for no good reason. It was his
Simon shook his head. “There are cells all over the world. You’d never find enough of them to make a difference.”
And that’s the case of the Torres family. I’m afraid it’s not wrapped up nice and neat with a bow as I’m sure you, dear readers, would prefer. But that’s life, isn’t it? And just because we don’t have an ending to it now doesn’t mean I’m giving up. I’ll keep you updated as we investigate further.
Sherlock had tried making tea the first few days after they’d returned from Bath, and John, bruised and battered, had let him. They’d both decided that as soon as John could stand, he’d return to manning the teapot. And some things were best forgotten.
But rather than look annoyed, Holmes looked a little … pleased. His mouth twitched. “Please, call me Sherlock.”
“What made you go into this field?” John asked. It was something that had been on his mind since they met.
Sherlock still lay with his arm dramatically thrown across his face. John watched him as he said his next words. “Simon wants to meet.”
“A microwave, from our office kitchen. I walked down to the room, and I turned on the light. There was nobody there, but the microwave was on, cooking … nothing. It was empty.”
Just like the deductions made on John earlier, the speech pattern was quick and the guesses accurate. Sherlock Holmes may be the arsehole everyone said he was, but there was no denying his intelligence. John had never seen anyone pull disparate information together so quickly.
John jerked his head up from where he’d been staring at the floor. “What?” He studied Sherlock’s face. He was half in shadow, the only light coming from the street below. Still, John could see the half moons under his eyes, his angles sticking out in stark relief. He really needed to eat more. John had been slacking on that front lately.
“Okay, yeah, I heard you. I just, just can’t believe it. You have a sister you never told me about?”
It only took about two minutes on site for Sherlock to be distracted. John looked up from listening to Sammy’s few memories to see his friend staring at the wall across the one-room building. The cabin was run down, had shuttered windows, and only contained a couple of chairs, a camp bed that looked newly purchased, and a box of tinned food. And the old wooden walls were covered—top to bottom, three hundred-sixty degrees—with charcoal drawings and symbols. They looked child-like, but the full coverage meant Sammy couldn’t have drawn them. Actually, they made John think of a combination of cave paintings and the things drawn on Simon’s and Trent’s walls at Nether Edge.
“But you’ve mentioned several times since I met you about the importance of evidence. But there's very little evidence that they have a bad marriage.”
shite place.” His brain started churning. Harry? No, not if he could avoid it. Mike? Maybe for a few days. Most of his work mates were covering wars around the globe, so they were out. He had some money saved, but it was already being used to cover his shit of a flat. Anything more would bleed him dry. He would get some insurance money, but it would mostly pay to replace his current possessions, few as they were.
Three weeks later, John received an email from Dabic himself, or at least one from his email address. It contained a song file and nothing else. It wasn’t anything John had heard, so he shared it with Sherlock.
“They’re not being frightened to death. They’re victims of a serial killer.” Sherlock pranced about the room, picking up and putting down papers and folders.
,” John hummed at the slight dig, but let Sherlock continue his train of thought, “this whole … conspiracy theory is tied to many of my scarlet files, cases I’ve been unable to disprove yet. What’s to say I can do it now?”
John grimaced. He’d seen some pretty gruesome things in the Middle East, but most of the violence wasn’t self-inflicted, apart from suicide bombers.
“Right.” John took a bite of his curry, trying to decide which details would most intrigue his friend. “So yeah, the defense claimed there was no way he could have murdered them—no blood on his clothes, he was too young to be able to plan out a murder, he killed them both in their sleep, but his father—killed first—should have made enough noise to wake the mother before he died. The final ruling was criminal insanity, and he was placed in a psychiatric hospital.”
Holmes settled in a leather chair near the desk. John took the seat across from him, a red-print chair that looked like it had seen its fair share of years. “My research or the reward?”
“He never specifically mentioned the reward,” said Sherlock as he closed the laptop lid. “Just said he’d heard of me from a recent write-up concerning the reward, and he thought I might be able to help him figure out what was happening.”
Of course he did. Sherlock couldn’t have a secret macrame hobby, he had to have a secret fucking sister. Not to mention his formerly secret maybe boyfriend.
. That’s like nine-tenths of your life. What else are we meant to talk about? Because I’m pretty sure John is the only other option.”
“Glasgow. She’s a writer, actually.” Sherlock glanced at him sideways and nudged his shoulder. “Fiction though.”
having the dreams?” Simon’s gaze sharpened. “You weren’t on their list.” He rubbed his temples. “No previous visions when you were a child?”
“Funny, I didn’t ask,” Eurus quipped. She entered the room and dropped her bags. “Less than two weeks to the main event, I thought you could use some extra support.”
“There is nothing paranormal about those shadows. Your wife chose to believe something else. It's a choice, I can't force her to believe me.”
John nodded, looking over his shoulder at the screen. It was the standard home video fair: a boy’s birthday party. Kids were chattering excitedly as they gathered around the guest of honor, who was sat in front of a lit birthday cake.
John was surprised to hear the apology. Sherlock didn’t seem like the type to apologize. But he looked genuinely contrite, as if he’d caused the events himself.
He had been eyeing the kitchen mess when Sherlock started his swooning Regency act, so he let his mind switch gears onto the other task he had on his to-do list.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “Ancient Sumerian. Not exactly common knowledge. Where did you learn it?”
John shook his head. The man was obsessed with debunking every interesting bit of the case. “We’ve heard about four distinct instances of the strange happening to this family. How is that not evidence of
They arrived at Nether Edge Hospital by mid-afternoon, which apparently was enough time for Sherlock to “brush up” on his ancient Sumerian, numerology, and Babylonian myths and gods. This did not surprise John after several months of living with the genius.
They did not speak, by tacit agreement, of what they learned on the trip until a few days after they’d returned to Baker Street. They were both trying to sort the new information internally, and John could tell Sherlock was mentally exhausted. And they both were still sleeping poorly, so a few days’ rest seemed the best course of action. They had a little time still before they had to make decisions.
“Demean what you do. You've never been the most luminous of people, but as a conductor of light, you are … rather good.”
Sorry for rambling. Things have just been a little weird lately. I promise a better post next week. I’ve got quite a story to tell. Until then, I remain your intrepid journalist—or blogger, or whatever I am now—John Watson.
“She constantly road her bike all over the city. The likelihood she would eventually have an accident was high. It had nothing to do with the Unsound.”
“Apparently he’s talking now. And he’s now confessed to his parents’ murders as well.” John shrugged. He was baffled by the whole thing and really hoped Sherlock could come up with a logical explanation.
John continued to scan the email he’d received from the Cologne police. He wasn’t sure how Sherlock had managed to wheedle them into sharing their findings with him, but John wasn’t going to complain. “Yeah, it’s just initial testing, but it doesn’t seem to match the blood from her body. And– Oh.”
Sherlock stood in the doorway to the flat, frowning at the drawer rather than at John. Interesting. Before John could ask about the files further, a man walked in through the kitchen door.
“A monastery in Bulgaria, run by the Order of the Cenophus. They were an order who broke away from the Benedictines in the sixteenth century. The Ivan that Marie refers to is a brother who jumped off one of the towers there in the sixteenth century. There’s a local nursery rhyme that mentions it: ‘Ivan thinks he can fly to God, but the Devil has him by the ankles. The pale robes still shake their heads.’ It refers to the idea that Ivan sold his soul to the devil.” Sherlock shook his head in annoyance. “I should have recognized this earlier. The monastery is known for being very secretive and isolated. The only time an outsider was let in was 1983. Marie Simone. There was also a related video going around in the nineties, I receive an email of it every year or so …” He stood and moved over to his computer to queue it up.
. How could there be no trail?” It made no sense. Sherlock was the man you went to when all other trails went cold. There was no way he couldn’t figure it out.
Sherlock pressed his lips together until the seam between them was white. “This was my first case,” he finally said slowly, not looking at John. “It’s where my career really began.”
But Sherlock slammed the door before John had a chance to get out the full apology. He sighed and wandered back into the flat. He wasn’t sure he believed Sherlock. There
John glared right back. “No. It was sent anonymously with no explanation. I watched it, didn’t understand why it was sent to me, so I showed you. Now, what’s Glushka?”
“I admit it’s … tenuous. And perhaps it’s like Sherlock said, and I’m just seeing connections because I’m looking at all of these things at once. All of these paranormal stories being dumped on me is making me join up dots that don’t belong in the same picture.” He shrugged. “Monks are involved in both? Probably. And Percival Black was maybe sneaking out at night to do rituals in a cave with drawings similar to things we’ve seen around all the other—what are they called—Chosen children? And he’s the one possibly researching music to combat the Unsound.”
“And why are you suddenly so willing to help us?” Sherlock squinted at him suspiciously. “Did you have a change of heart? Did you see the light?” His tone was mocking.
The place: Imperial College London. The year: 1993. We had to watch an honest-to-God VHS of this one. Do you kids even know what a VHS is?
With a nod, the man headed back out the door. The whole exchange had taken less than a minute and left John very confused. This didn’t seem like the usual paranormal investigation. Then again, Sherlock Holmes himself was pretty unusual, in many respects.
“We don’t know that, Sherlock. We only know he disappeared, and that we’re the first to hear from him. Why this? Why now?”
“Alright then, Sherlock.” John tried to focus his thoughts. He was here for an interview, not to moon over some man, no matter how fascinating or intelligent (or handsome) he was. He cleared his throat. “So that’s what you do? You go to the site of a haunting or whatever, and you figure it out like you did me?”
“Assuming we decide to believe and help you, what do we do while we wait for you?” Sherlock’s tone was disgusted, and John wasn’t sure if that was because he hated the thought of believing in all this and helping Simon, or if it was just that he hated waiting.
“It’s like you said. We humans want there to be a connection. We want to find meaning in this crazy world.”
John tensed at the words. He was used to Sherlock treating him like an idiot, and he understood that it was Sherlock’s misplaced frustration with himself that caused it, but Mycroft was just an arse. A nosy, smug, arse. One who felt the need to kidnap him on his way to do the shopping. Rude.
But I can’t help but see connections in so much of what I’m learning these days. All of these cases, the emails you all send me, it seems like I hear about something new to me, and then within a few weeks I’ve heard about it three more times. Sherlock says I’m reading too much into it. That of course paranormal cases have similar threads running through them—that’s because they’re still unexplained phenomena.
She shrugged. “The older he got, the more stand-offish he became. It made sense with the wider world, who didn’t really accept him, nor he it, but I never found out why he turned away from me. We were so close as kids. Maybe it was just that I found acceptance from other people, that I found it easier to interact with them and lead a quote-unquote normal life.”
The hand on his shoulder tightened. “That’s what makes it real. Even after knowing Victor for a decade, I always worried that one day he’d leave. A little part of me wondered if that’s what happened when he disappeared. That he’d finally had enough of me. But with you, I was comfortable almost immediately.”
“What?” John felt his eyes go wide. Sherlock was actually admitting something was connected. “How? What is it?”
Sherlock went on to explain many things that went over John’s very analog-trained brain, but he trusted that Sherlock knew what he was talking about. The most interesting facts were that humans shouldn’t be able to hear the sound but could anyway and that the patterns were regular enough to be mechanically produced, though Sherlock insisted it was organic in nature.
November, but I’m trying to be optimistic here. I sure as hell hope it exists—for you all, my readers, who have stuck with us through a
“What abou–” Sherlock stopped himself in realization, then looked at John in frustration. “Oh. John, it’s just a stylistic preference. Perhaps he was wearing a mask.”
“I know,” John said with a fond chuckle. Then he leaned in and kissed Sherlock’s lips briefly. “Now, let’s get some sleep. Big day ahead.”
The morning of the first of November, they stood on the edge of Boulder Field in a copse of trees that shielded them from sight. A cold, lonely wind whipped through the trees, rustling fallen leaves and biting at edges of coat sleeves and the tops of collars. Eurus carried a bag filled with ground-up chalk and powdered blood (blood meal from a gardening shop, to be more precise) and the cheat sheet she’d made for symbol substitutions. Sherlock was armed with his violin and composition sheets, though he had the whole thing memorized. John had a pistol (issued by some mysterious lackey of Mycroft’s), a bullhorn, and a brain scrambling to come up with distraction techniques. They’d had a vague idea of what would a occur during the ceremony, but having never faced the Order before, they didn’t know what opposition they’d meet.
They went their separate ways, John and Sherlock to their car, Simon off to wherever he’d come from.
Sherlock shook his head. “There’s nothing to go on, nothing to see for anyone besides the one who claims to see it. You can’t disprove that.”
Then there are the more practical issues. John and Rosie sharing a room is fine a couple nights a week, especially while Rosie is still so young. If they moved back, for good, they’d need more space. Space that the flat doesn’t have. So really, even if there was no worry of anyone feeling stifled, it still wouldn’t work. 221B Baker Street just isn’t enough for two men and a child. Even though nowhere has felt like home to John since he was a kid. Chiswick included.
John knew Sherlock was brilliant, and his answers always made so much sense, but John still wondered if there was some actual mystery out in the world still—phenomena that had no answers apart from magic or demons or whatever. He was a pretty sensible guy for the most part, but the kid in him wanted some things to remain unexplained. But he didn’t really fault Sherlock for wanting to find out the truth. It’s what made Sherlock who he was—his undying curiosity, his interest in the weird, even his acerbic personality. John appreciated it all. He had been really lucky to be led to him.
“Why do you want to interview me? Are you interested in my process, or do you just want to know about the reward?” His voice went mocking at the end.
“Sherlock’s been in a mood the past couple of days. This case didn’t go well for him the first time, you see, and he worries. Poor dear.” She tsked as she led him through the door to the kitchen. Sherlock sat at the table, a microscope in front of him, though his gaze was on a notebook next to it.
John looked at Sherlock, whose eyes were darting about in his frozen face. After a minute of silence, he turned back to Victor. “Spy?” John didn’t blame him for skipping the emotional part and going straight for the hook.
would kill him within a year? But still he hesitated. His love of horror stories and urban myths meant that just a tiny bit of him wanted to believe it was true. No, not
“What oh?” Sherlock stood and walked behind John’s chair to read over his shoulder. He bent over enough that John felt breath on the back of his neck. He closed his eyes, suppressed a shudder, and gulped.
“I’ve never been skilled at interacting with people. I had my siblings when we were young, and that’s all I ever wanted. Then there was Victor … and that was flattering and wonderful, until he was torn from me.” Sherlock huffed. “Then after I’d finally got over that and you came along, I thought maybe … But then I found out that Victor was a lie. And I wondered if you–” John opened his mouth to retort, but Sherlock put a hand on his shoulder to stop him. He sniffed and continued, voice a little husky. “But somehow, I know. This is real. You’re real. And for some reason, you think I’m worth it. It’s flattering … but it’s also just very comfortable. I can be myself and not worry that you’ll leave in a huff and never come back. Instead, you’ll leave in a huff
“I loved you.” Victor’s admission was quiet but hard. Sherlock froze, and John felt that ball of jealousy finally appear, pity gone. “I left because I loved you. Because I couldn’t spy on you anymore. Because I wanted you to have a normal life and not get caught up in this mess.”
“If I tell you what those folders mean, and show one to you, will you leave it be?” Sherlock’s eyes were narrowed at John.
“Not so good at the moment. He got a message from Victor recently, asking him to stop looking for him. It’s made him …” He ran his hands through his hair, unsure how to word it.
In which John and Sherlock go to Wales, John enjoys autumnal foliage, and they hang out in a cave with Simon.
“And you look like shit.” John slid into the seat across from Eurus at the coffee shop they’d decided on and rubbed his hands through his hair.
At John’s words, Sherlock looked up from the book he was reading. It was a few days after Wolfgang had found the housekeeper hanging from her ceiling, and they were relaxing in their respective chairs.
Sherlock tossed his head in that public school way of his but indicated that John should continue the video. After only a short time, he paused it again. “They’re Bulgarian, the monks? Why would they bring in a French woman?”
Sherlock was flitting from wall to wall, pointing and muttering, snapping pictures as fast as he could. John joined him.
“Hmm.” John wondered if that was the full story. Surely someone willing to send two different sets of video footage, and who seemed genuine, wanted more of an answer than that. He made a note to talk to Mike about getting in touch with Robert Torres. It might make for an interesting second article. He was supposed to be moving on to a new topic for the next post, but people rescuing endangered animals from private buyers just didn’t pique his interest the way the paranormal—or Sherlock, if he was being honest—did.
Sherlock steepled his hands in front of his mouth. “’I like your drawings,’ but ‘I don’t like it when you pray.’ Let me guess, you only pray here in your room?”
Sherlock plays until long past when Rosie finally drifts off. John cooks supper to some classical piece he’s always loved but never asked the name of. They eat dinner, then settle in for a quiet evening. It’s very … domestic. It’s been so long since John has spent a relaxing evening with another adult that it almost feels wrong. If he does happen to be away from home of an evening, it’s usually mired in a case or running errands. But this is just a normal evening, the kind couples have. It’s too close to what John wants these days. He’d chafed at having this before, had been an utter prick by trying to run away from it by having the beginnings of an affair, so he’s not sure what to think. Does he want this just because it’s different from the draining pattern his life currently contains, or is it that it’s Sherlock? Did his being married to a secret assassin who almost killed the person he actually cares for most play a part?
to do something right then, he would have to work for it. So he waited, lying on his back, eyes closed, duvet heavy on top of him.
The common denominator in all of John’s scenarios, though, was that they were all single Events. There was a Moment, and after that Moment, they knew what they were to each other, and there was nothing left to resolve. There was a minute where they were friends, and there was a minute after when they were Together. But when John thought about it, how it ended up happening in reality was very Sherlockian. In cases, the way things usually went was that there was a problem stated, they talked about it a bit, Sherlock went off to his mind palace, he made decisions and acted on them without consulting John, a lot of things happened that John had to react to because he had no fucking clue what was going on, then the case was done,
She nodded. “To be expected. I’m assuming everything in your blog has dredged up some buried feelings too.”
“Was Victor the reason you started up your investigations?” John asked one afternoon when they were both home. Sherlock sat at the kitchen table, eyes firmly attached to his microscope (there were livers and fingernails involved; John didn’t ask) while John wrote up his latest blog post—a freaky scarlet file case about girls wearing other people’s faces upside down. A case of writer’s block had his mind wandering, and as it did so often lately, it settled on the mystery of Victor Trevor, and he decided to finally bring up the topic.
“I was there when it happened. That’s me behind the camera.” The words were stilted, like he was working against a great force just to get them out.
Full disclosure, readers. At the time of this posting, I’ve gained a new flatmate. Or. He’s gained me, I reckon. You see, just after the events that I explain in the following paragraphs took place, I came home to find my block of flats up in flames. I can’t say I’m too bothered by that. It was a shit flat, and I’m happy to be out. War correspondents tend to not accumulate many things, so not much was lost in the fire, and the insurance money meant I could finally buy a new laptop. Finding new digs in London, however, is daunting. It’s not a cheap place to live. Still, there’s nowhere else I’d rather be, if I’m stuck in England anyway.
“Sherlock …” John paused, trying to organize his thoughts. He had a feeling that how he spoke now would decide their future. “If we do this, we can only do it together. If you really don’t want to do this, I’ll stay with you. I won’t work with Simon without you. I think we … we need each other, no matter what we choose to do.” It was always so easy to speak his feelings during these liminal moments, when lack of sleep left him powerless to keep up his walls and his face was half hidden by the dark. He just hoped the same could be said for Sherlock.
“Not just music, “Eurus said with a smile. “Violin music. When Sherlock asked for lessons, I did too. I wanted to be like my big brother. We used to compose together. Nothing fancy. Just little ditties like children tend to sing. Then I found writing, and I realized it was more of a comfort to me, so I put down my bow and picked up a pen instead. It’s been ages, but I remember a thing or two. There’s something about this song …”
“Shhh. Don't let Mummy hear you. You are going to love your new life, my boy.” More chanting followed, in a language John didn’t recognize, though he did recognize the voice—Maddie the housekeeper. She ended her chanting with more English. “Goodbye, little one. Serve him well.”
“The symbols, most of them are Ancient Sumerian, with some mentions to the Tower of Marduk, the national god of Babylon. Odd. Perhaps he was looking for something foreign and that’s what popped up on his internet search.”
John wanted to lean into Sherlock, to comfort him and show he was behind him, but he knew it would be seen as a sign of weakness by Simon, so he stayed put, hoping Sherlock knew he wasn’t alone.
what you do. You research and explore the insane stories people come up with and prove them wrong. This is exactly the sort of thing you usually run
“Joys of being a writer. I can take a holiday whenever I like, as long as I have enough money to keep eating and don’t owe my editor new stuff.”
Simon smiled. “That’s something I’m still working on. I’ve found some things in the Codex Gigas, rituals and prayers that might stop the ceremony from even happening, but I need to do more research first.”
“Ugh, why are you writing up that case? It was boring.” Sherlock hung like a specter over John’s shoulder.
“Mmm.” He shook his head in an effort to wake himself up. There would be no sleep until they’d talked this through. “It was just a few lines. It’s not like I did an entire post on it.”
Sherlock takes one look at the metaphorical bags under John’s eyes and literal bag on his arm, gives a firm nod, and plucks Rosie from her father’s drooping arms. “Go lie down,” he commands. “Young Watson and I will entertain ourselves for a few hours. Isn’t that right, Ro-Ro?”
Victor Trevor and Sherlock Holmes met around age 14. John couldn’t find much on their friendship, but there were pictures in a class paper, Sherlock looking even more baby-faced than he currently was, and more carefree too. They had stayed friends, both going to Oxford, though studying at different colleges. Though information on their friendship was sparse, he did find some academic awards and articles from their respective college newspapers, showing that Victor was almost as smart as Sherlock, but definitely more social. Victor had gone on to get his masters while Sherlock decided on a second degree in another field, and then a third. Through it all, they stayed friends.
“Oh, don’t worry, John. I need your help. I wouldn’t want to hinder you in any way.” Simon’s smile was sickly sweet. John really didn’t like him.
“It’s the only way,” she argued. “John will be busy distracting, and you’ll be occupied with your violin. That leaves me for the symbol substitutions.”
Sherlock’s face fell, and his lower lip trembled as he pulled his sister close, hiding her face in his neck.
“If you had died, we probably would’ve failed, and there’d be no one left to post or read your sugary nonsense.”
“He’s further down the conspiracy rabbit hole than you or even your biggest fans are. He’s delusional.”
“Then you’ll outwit them, like you said. But there’s a chance he wants to help. And I think taking a chance on him is worth it.”
“Huh. I guess you calmed me before I could wake myself.” Of course, in stories where love conquered all, just having a loved one in bed made the nightmares disappear completely, but reality was different. What surprised John was that Sherlock had managed to calm him at all. Then he remembered his own waking from the night.
He squinted. It was a man. Or the shadow of a man. A dark shadow in the background, standing right next to an old shed. It looked like a tall man wearing a hat, but its proportions were all ... stretched. It was impossibly thin. He almost mistook it for the shadow of a tree except that it looked like it had arms and legs. The video’s graininess made it hard for John to tell though.
A day later, the battle won by John, the two men boarded a plane to Sofia, wanting to get in a day early to prepare as much as possible. Well, John wanted to prepare. Sherlock hadn’t said two words since their disagreement.
Eurus smiled softly. “I’m glad he has you, John. He needs someone to see him for real. But no, that’s not what I’m talking about. I’ve seen him do that, and I understand how he comes to his conclusions. But this was different. We were hanging out in our back garden when we heard the news from a neighbor kid. No one knew much. The teen just disappeared one afternoon after school, no clues as to where he went. I saw Sherlock going on alert, saw the gears turn. But there was something else. It’s like he was listening to a radio in his head. He said he needed to find the missing boy, then stood up. Victor and I followed him through the house and out the front door, where he stood on the steps for a while, eyes closed. Then he said, ‘I know where he is,’ and headed down the pavement toward the edge of town. He would stop from time to time and close his eyes, then adjust his direction and start walking again. Within an hour, we came upon the body. I’d never seen him do that before, John. This wasn’t how he usually deduced things.”
He had originally found his flatmate’s lack of acknowledgement of personal space to be charming, something that showed his innocence when it came to interpersonal connections, but lately he’d been more affected by it than just being charmed. It was getting harder (no pun intended) to ignore his attraction to Sherlock. Which was bad, seeing as the man didn’t seem to be attracted to anything apart from weird experiments, dry monographs on obscure myths, and false claims of the paranormal. John had tried the dating thing for a while in an attempt to get over his little crush, but after the sixth time Sherlock had ruined a date, John had given up on ever having a love life.
