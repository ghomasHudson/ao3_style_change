Besides, there was a very likely chance that Tony could be recognized as what he was and end up dead by the end of the night since most of the people there were vampire hunters. Never mind that Steve was one himself.
," Tony said with a grin that nearly showed off his fangs, staring at the sandy blond talking to a redhead.
Tony didn't give Steve any warning before he sank his fangs deep in his neck, knowing it hurt less when Steve wasn't expecting it. Still, Steve gasped in pain, his hold on Tony's wrists tightening so much that if Tony wasn't a vampire, he'd bruise from the hold.
Steve sighed. He knew this was a bad idea. "Please, just let me explain. I promise I'm not in any danger."
Natasha glanced between them, scowling at the blood still on Tony's lips though she very slowly lowered her gun. "Clint's watching. One wrong move
Tony, feeling a little evil, reached down to palm at Steve's hardness through his pants, Steve gasping and jolting from the touch.
Tony had never wanted to go to the party in the first place but Steve had insisted it would be good for him, saying something about always being cooped up in his house.
So Tony had allowed Steve to drag him to this party with all his other friends that Tony hardly knew. He grew bored quickly though, wishing he could go home already so he could have some fun times with Steve.
"Tasha, I'm okay, really," Steve promised, worried that his boyfriend would end up saying something stupid if Steve didn't intervene.
"Oh? And so what if they do? They'll just think I'm trying to get into your pants," Tony mumbled, licking a strip up Steve's neck just to hear Steve's breath hitch in his throat.
But Steve had been accepting, knowing it wasn't something Tony had wanted, offering his own blood to Tony and comforting him when Tony cried about how he was a monster. Steve wouldn't hear it though, patiently telling Tony he was anything but a monster.
"You are not going to bite Clint," Steve said firmly, grabbing Tony's wrists tightly as if worried Tony actually would try and bite the other man.
A figure stepped forward, the pretty redhead from the party, a gun in her hand which she had raised at Tony. "Step away from Steve, now."
"Tony, hurry up. Someone could walk around and see us any minute," Steve urged, making Tony chuckle.
Steve gave a frustrated sigh, glancing around at the others gathered in the room, all chatting away, smiling and laughing, unaware of the pair arguing in the corner, away from the loud music of the party.
Tony knew that mortals tended to get a pleasure out of this which made it easier to drink from Steve when he needed it. When they first did this, Tony had been too nervous, nearly backing out because of the simple fact that he was afraid he would hurt Steve.
Of course, Steve was different. He didn't see Tony as a monster like most would. Though that might be because he knew Tony when he was still mortal, before he had been turned against his will.
"You beg so prettily," Tony whispered in the blond's ear but decided to give them what they both wanted, his own hunger overtaking his want to tease Steve further.
"T-Tony, you can't...in public," Steve gritted out. Clearly it was taking all his remaining energy to think with his brain instead of his dick.
Steve sighed again, tightening his grip on Tony's wrist and dragged him away from the party, ignoring the eyes watching the pair leave.
But as soon as Tony started drinking down the sweet taste of Steve's blood, Steve went lax, leaning back heavily on the wall as his blood was taken.
"Ooh, dangerous. I like bad boys," Tony teased with a wink that made Steve roll his eyes though a smile twitched the corner of his lips upwards.
"God's, Tony," Steve moaned, head tilted back so Tony had easy access to his throat, his hand coming up to thread through Tony's hair for something to hold onto. "Mm, f-fuck."
"You're such a little shit," Steve stated as Tony leaned forward, pressing their chests close together.
"You're high off of the bite," Natasha stated, eyes flickering the bite on Steve's neck before glaring at Tony. "I knew something was off about him. Now I know why."
"That just makes it all the more exciting," Tony told him, pressing up closer and growling lowly when he felt Steve's hardness through his pants. "Looks like I'm not the only one who thinks it's exciting either."
Tony opened his eyes and turned his head to Bruce. ''About the baby... and Steve. Don't know what to do,'' he murmured and sighed. ''I'll see what I'm gonna do tomorrow. Just really want to sleep right now,'' he said and Bruce chuckled. ''Yeah, sorry. Goodnight, Tony.''
Tony got the sonogram from his bag and looked at Steve. ''What?'' he asked and Steve just smiled. ''Nothing, I'm just happy,'' he said and scooted closer to his best friend to see the picture. ''And she's healthy? Everything is okay?'' he asked and Tony nodded. ''Yes, thankfully she is. Now I think we have to come up with a few names and choose?'' Tony suggested. ''Yes, of course. A name. I like Isabella, Maria, Sarah. Do you've got some already?'' but Tony wiped a tear away. ''Sarah Maria Stark-Rogers. Doesn't that sound beautiful?'' he said but Steve raised his eyebrow. ''Stark-Rogers? Would you really do that for me?'' he asked and Tony looked at him in confusion. ''What? Of course, this is our baby girl, Steve. She needs your name too,'' he said and grabbed his bag. ''I've gotta go back home but I'll see you tomorrow, alrig- Oh my god,'' he said and sat back down, holding his belly. ''Steve, she's kicking!'' he rambled and looked up at his best friend. ''Give me your hand,'' he said and placed Steve's hand on the spot she just kicked, just on time so he could feel it too. ''Oh my god, she is! Our little Sarah!''
I had the best time of my life last night with you but I think it's been a mistake. Don't be angry, please. I'll always be your best friend.
''I can't believe you remembered that. Thank you!'' Tony replied and ate a few. ''I really appreciate you letting me sleep here while you don't even know what's going on. But I owe you an explanation so-'' he got interrupted by Bruce. ''No, you don't. You can stay here as long as you want. I guess trouble with Steve?'' he asked and Tony nodded. ''You were really upset about it so you don't have to tell me what happened, alright? Just want you to feel comfortable. Do you need to let your godmother know you're here?''
You know, when someone wants to ask you to the prom and makes a big deal about, like getting all your friends together to sing you a serenade, throw flower petals and glitter, hire a plane to skywrite “Will you go with me to the prom?”
in Tony, regardless of the situation -- directing the team in a battle or asking about if there was any coffee left.
The book was solid in Steve’s hands, he could feel the warmth of the room, he could hear the slight whirr of the HVAC in the walls. Steve took a deep breath, trying to center himself, force himself to live in the moment, draw on his deep well of patience.
He matched her toe to toe when they argued. They read each other’s mind when they fought in battle. And he had a dazzling smile and amazing shoulders.
“Damn,” Tony hissed. “I asked Jan and Peter to be careful with those crates. We have no idea what’s in them.” He scrambled for his phone. “Security, yeah, evacuate everyone out of the building. Now. Code Red.”
“Howard doesn’t approve of this match, does he?” Steve replied. “I don’t see the advantages for Malibu given that Triskelion does not offer what this country doesn’t already have now.”
Maybe Mr. Steve wasn’t the right one for his dad after all. He’d have to start over his project to find his dad the perfect person. His dad deserved a good person. But Peter didn’t have a lot of time. He’d have to get on it as soon as he could or after he finished his monster English paper. He probably needed to work on that.
Drawing comfort from Tony’s warmth, Steve only nodded. He clung to Tony, feeling him as the anchor tying him to the here and now.
“My identity is classified as top secret,” Cap replied cheerfully, though Tony detected an intriguing edge to the cheerfulness.
Steve spent the better part of the day with Tony until Tony was called away for royal duties. “I’d rather stay here,” he admitted.
Jan, who had been stabbing a roll with her fork, looked expectantly at Tony and Steve as Steve got up from the table.
“That assignment for Mr. Rogers -- that one-page essay thing,” she said. “Talk about a piece of art and what it means to you.”
Tony rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, vaguely aware of the Avengers alarm going off. Usually he’d be off like a shot heading for the armor, Steve’s voice in his ear relaying mission information. Instead, he saw Steve standing shirtless in his workout pants, coffee mug in one hand, watching the snow dance outside the Tower windows.
All of the pain came flooding back over Tony. Someone had murdered Steve and then Tony spent the past five years burning evidence, scattering ashes and salting the earth to drive home that Steve had never truly existed. As if their love had been nothing more than a myth written in lost languages in dusty libraries.
They both lay there, with Tony the little spoon to Captain America’s big. Even if there was room, Tony wouldn’t have been able to move, given the friction of his wool coat and Captain America’s uniform. At least they were warm even as the fire died down.
“Thanks for asking me out like you did,” Tony said. “It was very you. But you better do something for the marriage proposal.”
Steve’s life was so entwined with Tony’s that he nearly forgot where he started and Tony began. Like a branch grafted onto a tree to create a new fruit tree, he’d be nothing without Tony.
The thought of wearing Steve’s ring took Tony’s breath away. Steve had always wanted to be married, though Tony had a healthy fear of marriage, considering his parents and the strong likelihood he’d wake up and find that he’d married sentient armor or a Skrull. It could happen – he’d lay good money that it would. Tony’s luck ran on the rotten side.
“I do not know Tony well, but he does deserve to have some consideration and companionship in his match. A good match can do well for both parties.”
“Only the best for my hubby. Fair warning, Rhodey and Missus Pym will be disappointed we didn’t have a wedding in Timely, so get ready for another one.”
He leaned against the pillows on his bed. “I met Tony today. He’s not like what the stories are like.” He patted the bed, trying to lure Star over. Star stayed firmly at the end of the bed, happy to sit curled up and listening to Steve.
And suddenly she was afraid that she wouldn’t see that smile again, that this was finally the time that Steve would slip away from her. She kissed him. Natasha Stark kissed Steve Rogers in front of the whole damn world.
“What are boyfriends for?” Tony replied. “Fergus was unbearable and your video was getting close to the same number of hits as Ororo striking Logan with lightning.”
“If I can get a date --” He did not have the time or inclination to talk to Steve about who Steve should be taking to the prom.
He’d outlive them all. And what would it be like to come home to find that chair across from him empty?
Steve stood in Bruce’s lab, feeling deeply cheated out of his impromptu plans. Jan and Peter whispered to Ororo while sneaking glances at Tony and Steve. Tony stood next to Bruce at his computer and pointedly ignored Steve. Which made Steve even grumpier.
Scratch that -- Tony didn’t want to be anywhere else now that he had his armors back. He was needed in the fight against AIM.
Or maybe it was something more? Tony had a feeling that if Jan suggested taking off, Steve would say no.
Except he hadn’t counted on Steve steadfastly refusing. “No, your majesty, that would be a lie,” Steve had said firmly. “I cannot do it.”
Steve nodded, dumbfounded that anyone would have heard of that story. People had been forbidden from repeating it back in Triskelion.
Ned at that point decided to pull Peter further away. “Mr. Rogers is looking around -- he might see us.”
Steve walked into the living room and smiled at Tony. ''Hey, Tones,'' he said. ''Can I talk to you for a second?'' he asked and Tony wiped his mouth with his sleeve, nodding. ''Yeah sure,'' he replied. ''I'll be back soon,'' he said to Peggy and she nodded.
''What's up?'' Tony asked when they were outside, sitting on the stairs in front of his house. ''I lied to you last time. I didn't tell Bucky to leave. We're still together. But I couldn't keep it a secret. I had to tell you, it's only fair. You're carrying my baby and I really want to be here for you. I want to be a father. I just... I just don't know if you're okay with me dating Bucky, things are so complicated now. That's why I came to you,'' he explained and swallowed nervously, waiting for Tony to talk.
Steve chuckled and cupped his cheek. ''Hey, you don't have to be shy with me,'' he explained and slowly came closer, gently pressing his lips against Tony's. Tony easily gave in and parted his lips so Steve could slide his tongue inside. Steve began to kiss a little rougher and Tony hummed, pushing him down on the mattress so he was on top of him, tugging at his shirt. ''Easy,'' Steve said with a smile, pulling back as he took off both his and the other's shirt, biting his lip at the sight of Tony. ''I never noticed how muscular you actually are,'' he commented and grabbed Tony's ass which made him gasp. ''Steve!'' he shrieked and then laughed, coming closer. ''Is this.. okay for us to do?''
''Are you sure you don't want a beer, Tones?'' she asked. ''No, thank you, Pep,'' he assured her and hoped it wasn't too obvious. He looked down at his belly, which was beginning to grow. He couldn't even start to imagine how the people in college would judge him. But at least Steve wanted to be a father for the baby. For now.
''You're lucky you're pregnant, Tony,'' Steve growled and adjusted his jack before leaving the porch and walking towards his own house.
They were silent for a moment until Steve laughed and leaned against his best friend. ''Thanks, Tony. Let's get out before we get caught,'' he said and dragged him along again, this time laughing.
''Oh my god, oh my god,'' he rambled as he almost ran to his best friend's house. When he got there after five minutes, he rang the bell and realized there was no going back now when he heard footsteps coming closer. Steve opened the door and frowned but managed to smile. ''Tony, hey... what are you doing here?'' he asked and closed the door behind him. Tony kept on his coat as he walked into the living room, dropping himself on the couch before rubbing his face. ''I don't know, Steve. I read your note, then I panicked and the only place I could think of was here and now I'm here and I don't know what to tell you except that I'm sorry for yesterday...'' he rambled as Steve tried to calm him down. ''Hey, don't worry about it. Why are you sorry? We were just caught up in the moment, we had a good time and that's it. I'm still your best friend. You don't have to feel guilty or anything, let's just forget about it,'' he answered and placed a hand on Tony's shoulder. He nodded and sighed. ''Yes, yes. I can do that. Forget about it. That's not so hard,'' he agreed and stood up. ''You have a drink?'' he asked and chewed on his lip nervously.
''What? What is it?'' Bruce asked and stopped, looking at Tony with concern. Tony shook his head and stood up shakingly before he put his pants back on. Bruce began to feel embarrassed and grabbed his shirt, trying to hide his erection. ''What did I do, Tony?'' he asked and Tony sat down again, tears rolling down his cheek. ''I'm sorry. I can't do this,'' he sobbed and hid his face in his hands, not able to explain what he meant. Bruce frowned and came closer, putting a hand on his shoulder. ''Hey, it's okay. I understand. You're pregnant, you don't know what's going on between Steve and you, you've only known me for a few hours. I get it. And it's totally okay,'' Bruce comforted him and Tony hugged him tightly. ''That's what I was trying to say, thank you,'' he mumbled and Bruce wiped his tears away, smiling. ''Don't feel guilty, I understand your feelings,'' he assured him and Tony nodded, chewing on his lip nervously. ''I'm gonna go, okay? But hey, if you need me for anything, I'll be right next to you,'' Bruce said and kissed Tony's cheek. ''Thank you,'' Tony said and sighed when he heard the door close.
Tony was lying in bed when he felt her kick again and couldn't stop smiling. He could actually feel her moving right now and realized he was pregnant all over again. He was still scared about giving birth and raising a child but he knew he could do it. Together.
Bruce looked away when he began to blush, his cheeks colouring red. ''Well I always thought you were cute but when everyone started talking about you back in college, I really started to like you and then you smiled at me at the street and I asked Pepper for your number. I'm sorry.''
After the kiss ended, Steve lied down next to Tony on the couch and grabbed some blankets to snuggle into while they both tried to catch their breath.
''No. Not a good idea. You have to leave,'' he said. He wanted to do the right thing, he wanted to send Steve away. He was still so angry what he'd said but his hormones became the boss of him and his body.
Bruce frowned at the note. He really thought he and Tony could become something. But as always, he did understand.
Steve wants to keep and raise the baby together but slowly forgets about Tony when a certain someone pops up in his life. Meanwhile, Tony finds out what he's having and couldn't be more excited.
Bruce was a little more awkward than expected but he only thought it was cute. ''Should I, uh, get you anything? Coffee? Are you allowed to have coffee? I mean with the baby and all and-'' he rambled and Tony cut him off, laughing. ''Calm down, I don't bite. She does kick though,'' he teased and sat down on a stool. ''A Cappuccino would be nice, thanks,'' he replied and took a deep breath, feeling slightly uncomfortable. Bruce ordered quickly and focused on Tony again. ''Are you okay? We can move to the couch if you want to?'' he asked, worrying about him but Tony shook his head. ''No, it's fine. Really,'' he assured the other with a smile. ''Let's talk, since when do you have a crush on me?'' he asked curiously, thanking the waitress when she handed him his coffee.
''No you don't,'' Tony countered as one last attempt to make him leave by himself but Steve smirked and pressed a warm wet kiss on Tony's neck, nibbling at his skin gently. ''Yes I do,'' he said and Tony moaned quietly, his hormones out of control.
''This is for real?'' was the only thing Steve was able to say and raised his eyebrow. Tony scratched his neck and offered him a tiny smile. ''Have I ever lied to you?''
''Look, things I said to Steve about you and the things you've heard me saying the other day, I'm sorry for that. To me you were my boyfriend's nerdy best friend and all of the sudden he is having a kid with you, it freaked me out-''
The night passed quickly and Tony woke up early when he felt his baby kicking against his blatter. He grumbled when he opened his eyes and realized he'd slept on the couch, making his backache even worse than usual. Steve stirred in his sleep when Tony struggled to sit up straight and get his feet on the floor.
''Right, umm, Peggy is out with a few colleagues from work so I'm home alone. I've been doing well, no trouble at all. Sarah is still kicking and I can feel her move around so she's good in there,'' he reassured Steve with a smile, stroking his belly with his thumb.
Soon, the conversation was forgotten and they were having fun. Steve and Pepper were a little tipsy and although Tony couldn't drink, he could eat all the pizza.
''Just wait... uh, I heard what happened between you and him and so I came here to give you this and here's the candy you dropped,'' he said, unsure as he handed him both things. Tony closed his mouth and took the candy and flowers from him. ''Thank you... I guess. Is that all you came to say?'' he asked and Bucky shook his head. ''I talked to Steve and we both agreed on that this situation you two are in, is too complicated and I really don't want to make things more uncomfortable so I decided to stay out of the way and just be friends with Steve but what I'm saying is I think you should talk to Steve. He's willing to make things right... again. But he's too afraid to talk to you so that's why I'm here too. To ask if you would call him?''
''Hey, Tones. Umm, you told me you'd call me this week but you didn't and I was wondering how you and Sarah were doing. You're probably still angry but I was just worried...'' Steve admitted and Tony leaned against the wall, hearing him out as he stared in blue eyes, feeling a tingle as he did. Since a few weeks ago he began to feel horny and read it happened to many men and women during pregnancy.
The days he had to go to college were exhausting but worth it. There were rumors that Tony was pregnant but nobody really knew for sure because he was good at hiding his belly because it wasn't that big yet. He had told Pepper a week after Steve and she had squealed in excitement, rambling about all the presents she was going to buy and the stuff they needed. And now they all graduated, proudly getting their picture taken with their diploma.
''Steve... I hate to ruin your fantasy but we're not a couple. We just had sex. Casual sex. I was super horny and you showed up and I fell for it... it won't happen again,'' Tony pointed out and pulled away from Steve. Steve's face fell and he shook his head.
Tony wrapped his arms around his best friend's neck and hid his face, leaning against him. ''I was thinking...'' he began as he pulled back from the hug but Steve wouldn't let go of his waist. ''Maybe we should give it up for adoption?'' he carefully asked.
''I'm exhausted,'' Tony sighed and leaned against Steve's shoulder. They had stayed until the end of graduation and went back to Tony's place. ''You did great, Tones. Really, I'm proud of you,'' he murmured and planted a kiss on his best friend's head. ''I gotta go home, are you sure you can walk the stairs to your room?'' he asked but Tony raised an eyebrow. ''Go. I'm only sixteen months pregnant. I'm fine,'' he said. ''Don't forget we have to see Doctor May tomorrow, I'm so excited to find out the baby's sex!'' he chirped and Steve chuckled. ''Me too. Goodnight, Tony!'' he said and waved goodbye.
Tony and Bruce go to the hospital to find out what's going on. Tony makes a mistake and Steve has a secret he has to tell his best friend.
Peggy had gone to the store right after the doctor had left although she was sure her son was pregnant. She wasn't disappointed or angry, just worried. He was only eighteen and life had just gotten much more complicated for him. After a few minutes, she came home and sat down next to Tony, pulling him into a hug. ''I'm so sorry,'' Tony sobbed into her shirt but she hushed him gently. ''You don't have to be sorry. It wasn't your fault. Just take the test and know that I don't care whatever it says, alright? If you're having a baby, so be it. We'll go through this together, alright?'' she whispered and he nodded, drying his tears with his sleeve. ''Thank you. I love you, Peg,'' he said and went into the bathroom to take the test.
He laughed and told her he loved her before ending the call and giving the phone back to the other boy, hearing his stomach growling. Before he could say something about it, Bruce already stood up. ''I'm making spaghetti with meatballs, is that okay? My parents are out of town and that's pretty much all I can make,'' he admitted with a blush on his cheeks but Tony chuckled as he looked down at his hands. ''That's great. Thank you so much,'' he said with a grin on his face, watching Bruce leave to the kitchen. He had a lot of things to think about this evening. But first, food.
Steve was feeling a little nervous. He'd called Bucky to come to the mall so he could finally have a talk with him and Tony together and tell Bucky that he was becoming a father soon. He tried to hide his feelings when he noticed Tony. ''Hey,'' he said but it came out rather soft. ''Hey, Stevie,'' Tony answered and sat next to him. ''What's going on? You look a little pale,'' he mumbled and Steve sighed. ''Yeah, uh-''
It had been real, all of it. So real he could have built a skyscraper on it a thousand floors into the troposphere.
What,  exactly, had happened last night? Steve ran a hand down his face. He wasn’t going to panic yet. It wasn’t like they’d been ripped off in the night or anything. He’d never heard of thieves who put rings on people.
“You should ask your dad,” Mr. Steve replied. Tony appeared at the doorway with two large cups of coffee and the morning paper.
“Steve,” Tony exhaled with all the love he felt for Steve. A Valentine’s Day restaurant date was a big, fussy ordeal – with a planned proposal thrown into the mix – and Unromantic Steve was planning to do it all for him. A big risk, given all the space wars they’d been in recently.
“Thanks, Friday! Let’s say, living room at 12:00 noon? Pasta Barn down the street?” Tony said, rubbing his hands together.
“Ah, indeed. Obadiah will have made arrangements.” Steve wished he had met Queen Maria under different circumstances, she was the epitome of grace and excellent manners and he liked her tremendously.
Tony could see the gears clicking in Steve’s head. Then Steve smiled his brightest, happiest smile and said, “Sure. I’ll clear my calendar. What time is it now?”
“I gather you weren’t a big art history fan in college,” Tony commented. He sort of remembered his own attempt at an art history class, which involved him often falling asleep during the slides.
“Who left you here all alone?” Steve asked again, his face unwrinkled and untouched by time. Tony ached just looking at him like this, his feelings deeply complicated.
Once he got over the immediate shock of reliving life Groundhog Day-style, Tony immediately jumped to working the problem. Each day varied depending on the choices Tony made but, despite his choices, each day had the same exact elements. The coffee machine in the kitchen broke when he got his coffee. He got coffee at that great coffee shop -- The Espresso Express -- around the corner from the Tower. Sam reported on data about Ultron’s last attack. And Steve asked him out.
A couple of nights later, Peter lay still and quiet, straining to hear whatever his dad was saying to Rhodey.
But the taunts cut into Tony. He had been cool once, he would have owned this club years ago, when he had more money than respect and self love. But now his days were Avengers business, work, more work, even more work, bills, and a persistent ache in his elbow when it rained.
Tony couldn’t recall a single thing that occurred during the annual Avengers holiday party that would have resulted in them being benched. Food was excellent. He drank seltzer and lemon all night and Steve his craft beers. The Cards Against Humanity game hadn’t resulted in blood-letting. No one had stupidly challenged Thor or Carol to arm-wrestling. No one had complained about the silly, the serious or the thoughtless presents.
The cricket chirped. “It’s driving me up the wall,” Natasha complained to Steve. “I’ve tried everything.”
. Steve turned out to have the worst combination of traits -- sincerity, intelligence, kindness, loyalty, and an adorable streak of stubborness.
“Bucky and I were caught in a trap, HYDRA shot me up with something and it’s possible --” Steve took a deep breath. “It’s possible whatever it was made me immortal.”
“I don’t work in watercolors,” Steve explained as Tony walked into Steve’s art studio. “I never worked in watercolors.”
“No,” Tony said firmly. It would be yes to Sue, but no to Reed, and definitely no to Johnny. The Thing would probably thump Hank through two walls.
Tony was the source. He never admitted it or acknowledged it. Tony was also the reason for the other chair across from Steve’s.
“So what are you and Steve wearing?” Jan asked. She was sketching out another dress as they sat around a table in the Timeless Archives.
Natasha took a deep breath. Relocating crickets wasn’t the only way you showed you loved someone. Showing up did.
Peter was tasked with cleaning up the kitchen after the adults moved to the living room. Natasha came back. She leaned against the counter as Peter loaded the dishwasher. Natasha looked him straight in the eye, scaring him. “Okay, spill it. All of it.”
At the Tower elevators, he punched the going-up button. At this time of day, Steve was likely doing his free weights routine in the Avengers gym.
Tony ran a hand over his face. His personal spidey-sense was shrieking a warning that something bad had gone down and that no one wanted him to know. He was not in a mood to deal with whatever the problem was so he was all for ignoring it. When Steve got here, Steve would handle it.
Tony sighed deeply and kept looking out the window. “Just thinking not everything works out, Pete. You should go back to bed.”
But he couldn’t shake that vague sense of having something less than his friends. Like when Brian showed up looking like he was just off the runway and out of the spa. Thor was especially regal when he came. Jan dashed around taking pictures of all of them.
Tony and Jen watched in stunned silence as Brian followed by Peter and his band walked over to Loki. Song and a tiny drone flying by with a sign ensued. Charmed and thrilled Loki accepted immediately -- he'd been sort of low-key into Brian since he got to the Academy.
Eighty years later, two thousand years later, five thousand years and he’d still be paying for all those decisions.
“Well, let’s see what Rosalind Danvers from the Guggenheim has to say,” Tony said. “Ms. Danvers is a well known expert in mid-twentieth century American art.” Fergus looked appropriately pissed off, especially since Tony hadn’t explained all her credentials, just the top ones. She was the person everyone told him was The Expert he needed.
Peter slung his backpack off and set it on the floor. He sat down. Mr. Steve was in the clothes he wore to the Academic Decathlon comp yesterday. “Where’s Dad?”
Jovial to this point, Sam straightened up a bit, more guard than talkative tour guard now. “Prince Tony is the crown jewel of our kingdom.”
The garden party ended on a much better note that it had started since Steve had found some common ground with Tony.
“We’ve talked about it, getting married.” Tony nodded in agreement, and Steve continued. “I picked up the ring and all I could think about was when I could ask you. I almost asked last week at breakfast when you were fixing the coffee machine.”
He got so frustrated that he threw himself into traffic just to try to do something different, maybe his death or serious injury would shake up the time loop.
Tony told Steve all about his inventions from the little wheeled toys he made as a child to his current experiments in harnessing electricity. “The gas lights in the palaces aren’t very efficient -- better than candles -- but it’s gas -- if I could just get the wiring right --” He reined in his horse. “You know -- we’re not far from my workshop.”
Tony was watching Steve closely, as if he was reading Steve’s mind and finding the answer favorable.
“The team will love the more comfortable seats and bigger galley,” Tony grumbled. “So, the whole team thinks that you and I are getting married.”
Steve was the king of the shuffling-your-feet-back-and-forth dance but he made Tony smile. Tony didn’t care, he liked Steve’s hands on his shoulder and waist. He could be here all night with Steve in the crowd or just with the two of them.
“Thank you, Peter,” Mr. Rogers said tightly. “Thanks for the phone. See you at school tomorrow.” He left.
Admittedly after he had food and a shower, Tony was so damn excited that Steve asked him that he couldn’t actually sleep. He texted Steve repeatedly about the prom and could they take his car to the prom, even though a limo was better, and maybe they should talk it over dinner.
Tony did not entirely sigh with relief when Steve informed him what exactly had happened a half hour later.
“Okay, this is what we’re going to do. I could use a shower and you could too, so shower in our room, dinner and chocolate cake in bed -- we’ll watch something ridiculously silly --”
“I wasn’t wearing the boots when we met.” Now outside the cabin, Cap looked over the snowy landscape, blinking in the bright morning sunlight. “It wasn’t at a lecture either.”
Tony was an amazing sight, all beautiful, olive skin highlighted by the bright white of his shirt. Steve wanted to kiss him all over, tear his shirt off and kiss him all over again. Steve started to pull his gloves off.
As they made their way down to the floor, Tony shed his jacket, tucked his phone in his front pocket, and rolled up his sleeves. Then Steve snagged an angel’s halo from somewhere and put it on Tony’s head.
Dammit, the phone was ringing. Some stupid Avenger was actually calling her now. Probably Jan. Jan had no boundaries when it came to phones.
The balcony curtains twitched, but there wasn’t a breeze. On high alert, Steve carefully pushed the curtains aside, fearing that he would find an assassin or something like that. Instead, Steve startled a small black tuxedo cat licking its paw. The cat froze as it locked eyes with Steve.
“Just how many black t-shirts do you have again?” Jan said as she rummaged through Natasha’s closet.
It was all coming back to him, bit by bit. The copper metallic taste of loss now ever present in his mouth and tears choking in his throat.
The basket of breadsticks was finally shoved in front of his face. Peter reached for one when he heard a gasp.
“Oh please, Brian owns a closet of tuxes and you can just magic up whatever you want to wear.” Jan poked at her pad of paper. “A lot is riding on this -- I need to pick some thing that is perfect, looks great on instagram, and doesn’t clash with Thor. Thor is perfection but the yellows.”
Peter hadn’t thought about it like that. His mom, Maya, was a pretty special person. “I should stop, is that what you’re suggesting?”
They worked wonders in the time allotted, and Steve’s old clothes disappeared, never to be seen again. Jarvis had appropriated a more modern jacket, shirt, embroidered waistcoat and breeches from various people in the palace. “Not the best fit,” he said, as he sewed and pinned Steve into his new clothes. “But we do want to make a good impression on the prince.”
Though Tony didn’t complain when Cap struck the lock off the cabin door with his shield. They’d made it before the storm intensified. He surveyed the cabin, inventorying what was available.
Someone on the team had talked Steve into wearing a shoulder harness with small wings attached and tight pants that ended just under his hipbones and then doused him in glitter. Tony’s only comment was that he hoped the glitter was biodegradable.
They had just about given up. They had tried a coffee shop meeting, the school dance, an Academic Decathlon carpool.
“I’d be going back to Triskelion,” Steve said. He studied Tony as he sat on the edge of his chair, ready to be rejected by Steve.
He wished again that he had been briefed more thoroughly before being packed into the carriage and sent towards Malibu. Steve knew however he wasn’t Alexander’s favorite guard after he led that effort to feed people from the grain supplies last winter against Alexander’s express orders.
He glanced down at the coding on his computer. Fine. If Bruce had dug deep enough to uncover Tony’s hidey hole, maybe there was a reason. Had to be a fantastic one, a universe saving one. He shut the cover of the laptop.
“The air scrubbers in the HVAC -- they should be clearing out the gas. But look --” Tony threw his arm out to point at the multi-colored clouds of gas multiplying in the corridor.
Tony pressed his lips to Steve’s cheek. “Let me guess,” he said. He pressed his lips to Steve’s jaw.
“Based on your circulation numbers, that might not be as rare as you think.” Cap tied the rope to his shield.
November came too fast and Peter pressed the submit button on his MIT application. Not that it was a guarantee that Peter would get in, but Uncle Rhodey and Dad were convinced that Peter was a lock. But it did mean that Peter had just taken one step towards officially leaving home for somewhere next fall.
After dinner, Tony would drag him, not unwillingly, back to their suite and put on a sci-fi movie. “Have you seen this one yet?”
But now, Peter and Ororo were staring at the ceiling. Specifically, looking at the large Hulk-shaped hole in the ceiling. The five crates were crushed, glass bottle fragments everywhere, and clouds of colored gas were floating around the lab and fast escaping through the hole and door into the Stark Tower HVAC system.
Tony swung his feet off the bed and stood up, raking a hand through his hair before putting his hat back on. “Go on,” he said.
Which for Steve meant sitting on the couch with a soda and chips and preparing the post-mission brief. He’d drifted off at some point after typing in “retrieved crates with unlabeled bottles filled with unspecified gas from the back office.”
Just right then, it dawned on Steve that Tony had stopped snoring and was as naked as the day he’d been born. The large room was suspiciously quiet, as if the other ranch guests were already up and gone for the day. And there was an unusual weight on Steve’s hand.
Maria nodded, obviously weighing Steve’s words. “Prince Brock, that must be a terrible inconvenience for you. I will find you some assistance. Are your clothes and belongings delayed as well?”
By 12:15 pm, they were seated at a window table, with three orders of garlic bread being sent from the kitchen. Steve was wearing a blue shirt that was perfection on him, probably a much better choice than the suit he was likely going to wear on Saturday. Tony was pretty certain he himself was wearing matching socks and clean underwear, but he wouldn’t bet his life on it.
“People aren’t supposed to know -- and really I shouldn’t have let myself get so close to you. All the stories about how awful I am were meant to keep you away,” Tony explained frantically.
Peter knit his eyebrows and swore that his dad actually seemed worried about something. He strained to hear what they were saying.
He glowed in the soft light of the club mezzanine, the glitter sparkling here and there, his wings swaying a bit as he breathed. Angel Adonis Steve.
“Of course that’s what you meant. Why would I think differently?” Tony snapped. It was only the thirty-first time Steve had said that.
''I-'' Tony was still trying to understand what was happening. Bucky Barnes at his door, apologizing to him. Strange. ''Can I think about that?'' he asked and Bucky nodded. ''Yes, of course. All I had to do is ask, whatever you decide is up to you,'' he explained and then it got silent again. ''Okay, well, I guess I'm going back inside again then,'' Tony murmured and Bucky smiled. ''Yeah, alright. Bye, Tony. See ya later,'' Bucky said and got off the porch before skating away.
''Stop, stop it, Bruce!'' Tony giggled when the boy tickled him. He blushed a little and looked up at Bruce. ''You wanna keep watching the movie? Or go to bed? You look tired,'' Bruce asked him and Tony snorted. ''I'm always tired. You should try carrying a baby,'' he teased and tried to get up but Bruce helped him quickly, pulling him up. ''I can stay here if you feel uncomfortable lying in one bed with me...'' he began but Tony shook his head. ''No, no, of course not. Don't be silly, it's fine. I just really want to sleep,'' he admitted with a tired smile on his face.
''You can sleep here if you want. Peggy's probably staying over at Anne's house and then going straight to work... I'll be kinda lonely if you leave,'' Tony mumbled, breaking the comfortable silence. He grabbed a pillow and kissed Steve's swollen lips, laughing at the sight of his messed up hair.
Bruce stood up quickly and helped Tony up. ''I'll get a cab, alright?'' he said and held the door open. Tony wrapped one arm around him and held his belly with the other. Bruce called for a taxi and helped the other get inside. ''Wait, stay with me, please?'' Tony asked. ''I'm scared.''
''We're having a girl,'' he said, getting excited again. ''Really? Oh, Tony, we're having a girl!'' He laughed and hugged Tony shortly. "Let me see the picture!'' he mumbled while he stared at Tony.
Tony stared at Steve's name a few seconds before pressing the dial button, nervously waiting for Steve to pick up and when he did, he sounded broken. ''Tony? Tony, thank god you called me. Please listen to me. I can't believe I've said all of those things to you. I couldn't be happier that you got pregnant and that we're having a girl together, I love you and I've been so stupid. I know you're angry and you have every right to be, I just wanted to apologize for what I did. I'm sorry. You don't have to forgive me right away, I understand if it takes time,'' he rambled and took a deep breath. ''Just keep me updated, okay? Please?'' he asked and Tony wiped a tear away, nodding. ''Yeah, I'll keep you updated. Maybe I'll come by next week. I'm glad you understand that what you did was stupid. I'll text you later, Steve. Bye,'' he replied shortly and ended the call.
The bell rang and Tony sighed in relief, quickly packing all his stuff in his backpack before going to his locker. He grabbed some books and was just about to close his locker when he saw a note, saying; Come meet me in the principal's office.
When he woke up this morning though he had this strange feeling something was going to happen although he couldn't figure out what it was so he decided to ignore it and continue having breakfast. ''Peg, I'm going to the mall, alright? Pepper texted me, she's hanging out with Steve and asked if I could make it,'' he said and Peggy took a sip of her coffee before nodding. ''Sure, just be careful, alright. You're responsible for two lives now, sweetie,'' she pointed out and Tony smiled softly. ''I know, we'll be okay. See you later,'' he rambled as he left the house, slowly walking to the mall, taking a deep breath now and then. Pepper was waiting at the entrance for Tony, smiling when he got there. ''Hey, Tones. How are you doing?'' she asked, hugging him. ''Good, I feel really good. And you?'' he replied, returning the hug. ''Me too,'' she said and walked at his pace to where Steve was sitting.
''Come on, Peggy isn't home. Just get inside, please?'' Tony begged and Bruce took a deep breath. ''Fine,'' he murmured and took the other's hand, following him inside. ''Are you sure she isn't home?'' Bruce asked to be sure and Tony smiled. ''Peg? Are you here?'' he yelled through the house but didn't get an answer. ''Kiss me,'' he said and pulled Bruce on the couch, smirking. ''W-what?'' he stuttered and carefully lied down next to him but Tony just pressed his lips against Bruce's, tugging at his shirt. Bruce returned the kiss, sliding his tongue into Tony's mouth. Tony moaned softly and Bruce took off his shirt. He placed his hands on Tony's hips while Tony ran his hand over Bruce's abs, getting hard quickly. ''Take off my pants,'' he whispered and Bruce pulled back, unzipping his pants and slowly taking them off while he locked his eyes on Tony's erection. Tony bit his lip and as soon as his pants came off he pulled the other back again, kissing him heavily but when Bruce slid his hand into his boxer, he gasped and pulled back.
Steve panicked and stood up, kissing him hard but Bucky pulled back. ''No, Buck, come on. You don't have anything to do with it, just stay with me, please. We can still have fun,'' he begged but the other boy shook his head. ''I mean it, Steve. I'm breaking up with you. Can't believe you're having a baby with that brat,'' he blurted out before skating away from them. Tony had tears in his eyes by now and was trying his best not to start yelling at Steve. Steve watched Bucky leave before turning angrily at Tony. ''This is your fault!'' he said and Tony couldn't believe what he was hearing. ''My fault? You wanted me and Bucky to come down here!'' he said, glad the mall was not so busy as usual. The last thing he wanted was to make a scene. ''No. /This/ is your fault,'' Steve said and pointed at Tony's belly and Tony got furious. He didn't care if anyone was watching them. ''You should've worn protection, Steve! And you know what, I'm happy this happened but if you don't want to take care of her anymore, that's fine. Just stay in your house and kiss anyone you want. I don't care anymore. I'm sick of you and your lies. Stop making promises you can't keep,'' he screamed in his face out of anger as tears were rolling down his cheek. He wanted to say more than that but he was too upset to say another proper sentence. Steve formed his hands into fists but kept them next to his body. This was fucked up. ''I don't want to see you anymore,'' Tony sobbed and slowly walked away. He didn't want to cry but he couldn't seem to stop.
Hey, everyone! I hope you're all having a wonderful day. This is a late update, I know but I still love this story and surely want to continue. I'll try to write faster, it's just a little tricky because of my busy schedule. Enjoy this chapter xoxo
Two hours later, Tony ate all his pizza and ice cream and paused the movie to grab his secret chocolate stash hidden behind the microwave. He stood on his toes and stretched his arms with a groan to reach the chocolate bars. ''Yum,'' he said to himself as he unwrapped one of them while he walked back to the couch. Tony was about to sit down when he heard a knock on the door, sighing. ''Great. So far my evening home alone,'' he mumbled and walked to the hallway, opening the door.
''I just did that for you,'' he murmured and scratched his neck which made Tony smile again. ''Well thank you for pretending,'' he said before Steve came running towards them. ''Tony? Are you okay? You said I had to come right away, what's going on?'' he rambled, worrying about his best friend and child, not noticing Bruce. ''Everything is okay, Steve. Really, it were Braxton Hicks contractions,'' he said and Steve sighed in relief. ''I'm glad you're okay. Most people don't even feel those,'' he murmured but Tony frowned. ''Hey! No baby, no opinion,'' he pointed out and Steve held his hands up in surrender. ''I'm sorry,'' he jokingly apologized and only then noticed Bruce standing next to him. ''Hey, aren't you from college, Tony's neighbor?'' he asked, holding a bag of Doritos. Bruce's cheeks turned red. ''Uh, yes. I am,'' he began and decided to lie, not knowing how Steve would react to the truth. ''We were both at the coffee house and he suddenly was in pain. I recognized him and helped,'' he murmured shyly and looked at Steve. ''Thanks, buddy. I really appreciate that,'' he said. ''Why do you have Doritos with you?'' Tony asked and Steve smiled. ''Oh I was at the cinema with Pepper when you called,'' he replied but seconds later, his eyes widened. ''Damn, I gotta go back to Pepper. See you later,'' he yelled and ran outside.
''Pizza's got here five minutes ago, so they're still warm. What were you guys talking about anyway?'' Pepper asked and Tony looked over at his best friend, shaking his head. He didn't want her to know just yet. Steve smiled at Pepper while he grabbed a slice of pizza. ''About a school project for science,'' he easily lied and took a sip of his beer.
''What? Don't be sorry. It's okay. It's good, actually. Because I think you're kinda cute too. But I am pregnant, Bruce...'' Tony said and chewed on his lip again. Bruce nodded and fiddled with the sleeve of his sweater. ''I know, I was expecting that answer. I hope we can still be friends?'' he admitted.
Tony calls Steve but decides not to forgive him right away. Steve wants to give it another try with his best friend but Tony has different plans which end in morning trouble.
''I have to be honest, I was a little upset when I found out Steve left you that morning... but I'm relieved he wants to be there for you and the baby.''
The next morning Bruce woke up and this time, he was alone. The only thing Tony left was a note, just like Steve did a few months ago.
Hey, guys! Thank you for reading and sorry for the delay, I had some things to take care of but expect to see another update soon! Enjoy this chapter <3
Tony shot him one last look as he turned around, seeing Bruce sitting on his chair on his porch next to his with a shocked look on his face. Tony glanced at Bruce for a moment and then went back inside, tears rolling down his cheeks again. Things were still messed up with Steve and he felt half responsible for it but he also felt anger towards Steve, no matter how much he loved him. Tony didn't want to lose his best friend but he felt like he was losing grip.
''Sure, just a sec. Pep, we'll be outside, can you pay the deliverer? Money's on the coffee table!'' he yelled and smiled when he heard a yes. Tony went to sit on a big rock outside the house and grabbed the sonogram from his pocket. Steve sat in the grass and looked at him curiously. ''So what did you want to tell me?'' he asked happily and looked at the paper in his hand. ''What's that?''
You mean so much to me. I know we've just really started talking but I feel like one day we could be best friends. Not now. I'm so sorry. I do love you but not in that way. I need to be alone right now and think about some things. I need peace for me and the baby. I hope you can understand and that you'll still be my friend.
The words Steve had said to him ran through his mind as he walked home. Tony could still hear the argument. He had no energy left to explain any of this to his godmother. All he wanted to do was sleep so when he walked into his street, he decided to not go home but to Bruce's instead. Tony knocked on the door, feeling exhausted. ''Bruce, are you home?'' he called and a moment later, the boy opened the door, looking at him worriedly. ''Tony? What happened?'' he asked but all Tony could do was cry and shake his head.
Tony held onto Steve as he kissed his neck, memories of their first night coming back to him as they fucked.
''What do you mean, no?'' Tony asked and looked at him, confused by his decision. ''Shouldn't you at least consider it? I mean, it's a huge deal, Steve. We're going to have a baby. If we keep him or her, we're going to have to take care of the baby all our lives. Are we ready for that?''
''Absolutely. I'll just order a pizza, ice cream and watch movies. You deserve a girl's night out, Peg,'' he confirmed and Peggy gave him one more kiss before disappearing into the bathroom.
When Tony stood up and tried to bend over to reach his boxers, Steve opened his eyes and leaned on his elbows to get a better look at Tony. ''Goodmorning,'' he said, his voice still thick and sleepy.
Tony gave him a gentle push against his shoulder. ''Shouldn't you be studying?'' he asked, looking at his best friend while he wrote some things down in his notebook, sitting on his bed, next to Steve. ''I don't want to, Tones. I don't care anymore,'' he mumbled and leaned his head against his best friend's shoulder. ''What are we even supposed to study for?'' he asked and looked up at him. Tony stared into his eyes and licked his lips before he realized what he was doing and cleared his throat, looking at his notebook. ''Uhh, history. But you don't have to study for that, you're good at that,'' he nervously rambled, blushing.
''Wait, I don't understand. Did you use me for sex? Tony, I am the father of your baby. Shouldn't you at least give it a shot with me now that we're both single?'' Steve asked and Tony laughed at him.
The next morning he woke up with a text from the guy next door, Bruce. He had talked to him in college a few times but didn't really know him.
Tony was doing good. He no longer had morning sickness and didn't feel as heavy as he'd expected when he had first got pregnant. His godmother didn't have to work late like she had to last week so they were watching movies and eating popcorn almost every night. Tony was happy.
''Take it easy, Tony. Don't get yourself drunk. You know Peggy's gonna be angry if you get home drunk,'' he mumbled but gave him another beer nonetheless. ''I won't get drunk.''
''I'm sorry, this is kind of a lot to process, Tony,'' he mumbled and didn't know what else to say or do. His mind was a mess and it took him another minute to talk again. ''How long have you known?''
Steve placed one hand on Tony's belly. ''I am sorry, really. Will you just tell me how it went at the Doctor?'' he asked, using his puppy eyes and Tony sighed. ''Fine.''
Tony slept for hours and woke up around dinner time. He opened his eyes slowly and sat up with a groan. ''Bruce?'' he said unsure, not seeing him in the living room. Soon, he heard someone coming downstairs and when the door opened it was indeed Bruce who was wearing a soft smile when he noticed Tony was awake. ''Hey,'' he softly said and handed Tony a blanket. He happily accepted it and wrapped it around his body. ''Can you get me some water?'' he asked and Bruce was already on his way to the kitchen, coming back after a minute. ''There you go,'' he said and gave him the water and a bag full of jelly beans. ''Thought you might like some candy. Last time we went out, you told me that was your craving,'' he admitted and chuckled.
“Steve? Date? With us?” The words weren’t computing. The idea of Steve on a couple’s date with him and Jan was like imagining waking up and finding gravity didn’t work. Steve didn’t date people. As far as anyone knew.
“We could get married Tuesday at the City Clerk’s office – we get a license on Monday and there’s a 24-hour waiting period.”
“We have enough for about five hours of fire,” Tony said, expertly calculating the amount. “The storm will hopefully be down to a dull roar in the morning.”
Mr. Steve was making breakfast in the kitchen when Peter returned home. “Want some pancakes?” he offered.
“You just don’t want them to know that you didn’t tell them the truth that you didn’t want to fight the Wrecking Crew in a blizzard.”
“No, the hallway -- you know, people and stuff,” Peter replied incoherently. “I gotta find the phone and --”
Tony laughed. Cap stood up, hands on his waist, looking through the dark cabin. He walked over to rummage through a couple of storage chests near the cabinets. Tony put more wood on the fire, leaving a few logs for the morning. Cap handed over two blankets.
Tony ran his hand over Steve’s chest, tracing the swell of his pecs and nipples through the fabric. “Not many clothes?”
A couple of weeks later, the team and his teammates’ families went to Antonio’s to celebrate their big Academic Decathlon win over Roosevelt. Peter was trapped in the middle of the table, far away from MJ and Ned and the breadsticks. In the middle of negotiating for a basket, he looked over at Mr. Steve. Who was laughing alone with the rest of them, but still didn’t seem like the Mr. Steve from February, when he was laughing with Tony at the gallery.
“Hmm.” Tony pushed Steve’s uniform top more open, revealing the tight undershirt. “I’d say you might be thinking of horizontal planes.”
No, he should go back to Triskelion and try to save his ma and Bucky’s lives. He owed them that. He could probably talk Tony into giving him a sword, armor and money for travel.
“Based on the information given, and, thank you, Steve, for your help, it’s obvious that four of the submitted pieces have been misattributed to Steve and that one -- the drawing of Brooklyn docks -- was done by Steve.”
“Oh.” Tony settled against Steve’s side, head resting on Steve’s shoulder. “We’ll just build a second floor on the shop.”
“The team and reserve Avengers thought we’ve been living together for the past year. I was informed of this fact this morning.”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah. I picked it up by accident when we were talking about a paper. I was going to bring it back tomorrow.”
This had not gone as well as possible. “We have cookies,” Peter blurted out when he handed over the phone to Mr. Rogers. “If you need a snack or something.”
Rosalind smiled kindly at him. “As you know, Axel, Steve Rogers is a representational artist who works with pen-and-ink and charcoal. Mostly self-taught, he had a year of instruction at Pratt. Surely, Axel, you can see the evolution of his work, especially his later work which reflects the influences of contemporary artists.”
“We’re married,” Steve replied. The reality of his situation was sinking in. “Married,” he repeated, feeling the weight of the word in his mouth.
“It’s a family curse -- everyone gets it at some point,” Tony explained. “I can’t control when I turn into a cat. It just happens.”
A few hours later, after dinner, Tony decided it was time to tell Steve and walked to his place. A thousand thoughts went through his mind as he was walking, thinking about everything that could go wrong, everything that Steve could say but it all went away when he stood there in front of his door, swallowing nervously. ''May the force be with me,'' he whispered to himself and then the door opened.
''No, of course not. It's the baby, something hurts. Can you bring me to the hospital? Ow, please!''
''Fuck me. Fuck me now,'' Tony replied and wrapped his leg around Steve's waist who in return lifted him with slight effort only to lower him onto the couch and continue the heated kiss that was interrupted.
''Steve?'' Bucky said, frowning as he arrived. ''What's going on?'' he asked as he sat down, unsure of what to do. Pepper decided to leave them alone and walked away. Tony's eyes widened when he saw Bucky and swallowed nervously as he placed a hand on his four-month pregnant belly. Steve fiddled with his sleeve and looked down. ''I want you two to meet officially and get along because... I need to tell you something Bucky,'' he mumbled and looked at his boyfriend. Bucky didn't like any of this but was willing to listen to Steve. ''What?'' he said and stared into his eyes. It took Steve a while to start talking and Tony sat awkwardly next to him. ''I'm the father of Tony's baby. We're... having a daughter,'' he admitted. ''I'm so sorry for not telling you earlier, I was terrified for your reaction. I don't want to mess with what we have. I love you, Bucky,'' he explained but Bucky stayed silent, shocked with what he had just heard. ''Tony is having your baby? How long is he pregnant?'' he asked and Tony got scared, not wanting to be in this situation at all. ''Four months and a week now,'' Steve replied and Bucky shook his head. ''This is unbelievable, Steve. I can't understand why you wouldn't tell me. I mean, are you planning on being involved?'' Bucky asked and Steve then glanced between Tony and Bucky before nodding. ''Yes, I want to be involved. I'm gonna be there for my girl,'' he pointed out and Bucky let out a laugh of frustration. ''This is too much for me, Steve. All I wanted was some fun, this is not what I'm looking for,'' he said and grabbed his backpack from the floor.
''I don't think so. Though she was a little surprised I didn't want a beer and that I had to leave early. But she doesn't know,'' he explained while stuffing his mouth with a sandwich. ''Tony, take small bites,'' she murmured and he smiled. ''Sorry.''
Tony looked up from the tv, his feet against the table and his mouth full of pizza. ''Bye, Peg. Love you too!''
''What do you want to do?'' Tony heard and was surprised by the question. ''What d- You aren't angry or upset?'' he asked and eventually looked at Steve who came closer to gently hold the other's hands. ''Now why would I be angry? I mean, yes this is overwhelming and unexpected but this wasn't anyone's fault,'' he assured Tony and pulled him into a hug.
''Tony, please. I love you,'' Steve pleaded and held both of his best friend's hands, slowly guiding him backwards until Tony found himself between the wall and Steve's body. Steve's incredibly hot body he simply couldn't resist.
''Thank you so much for taking me here and staying so calm,'' Tony said as he had just gotten back from the Doctor's office, smiling. ''Are you okay? What was going on?'' Bruce asked and hugged Tony who happily accepted it and wrapped his arms around the other's neck. ''You were right, they were Braxton Hicks contractions. Nothing to worry about. They come and go and sometimes they're painful and sometimes you don't even feel them. Thanks again, you were so calm,'' he explained and pulled back from the hug. ''Are you kidding me? I was terrified, Tony! Thank god, you're okay,'' Bruce admitted and Tony laughed. ''What? But you looked so-''
Tony glanced between the picture and his best friend and eventually gave it to him. ''I'm sorry,'' he said and nervously watched how Steve grabbed the picture and looked at in confusion. ''I don't understand, is this yours?'' he asked and Tony nodded. ''Yes, I'm pregnant, Steve. But you can be as involved as you want to be.''
''No, she's out. Why? You wanna come in?'' Tony asked, well aware that might not be a good idea with his new pregnancy symptom but before he could say anything else, Steve came in, closed the door with a bang and wrapped his arms around Tony's waist, pulling him in for a kiss which lasted nearly a minute when Tony pulled back, gasping for air.
Tony was talking to Peggy while they were having breakfast. He told her everything that happened and cried again but she dried his tears and told him he did the right thing. ''No more crying, alright, sweetheart?'' she asked and Tony sniffled. ''I know, it just feels so sudden and I really like him, Peg,'' he said and shrugged. ''I know you do but as you said it yourself, stress is not good for the baby so being alone is good right now. And I'll be there for you all the time, okay?''
He stood in front of the door and took his earbuds out before ringing the bell, expecting to see Steve when the door opened but when he looked up, he saw Bucky instead. Tony froze and didn't know what to say until Steve gently pushed Bucky away and smiled, scratching his neck. ''Hey, Tony. What's up?'' he asked, still in his boxers.
Tony is happy about everything that is going so well but there's drama waiting for him. Steve is an asshole and says some mean stuff to his best friend when Bucky finds out Tony is pregnant with Steve's baby.
''What can I say? I'm extremely fertile.'' Tony tried to lighten the mood as he wasn't sure about how his best friend was feeling. Probably like he did when he'd first find out.
After a wonderful night of satisfaction and screaming each other's names, a ray of sunlight shone through the curtains, waking Tony up from his sleep. He yawned and opened his eyes slowly, stretching out before looking around his room. He frowned when he saw a note on the pillow next to him, quickly reading through it;
He pressed send and waited for an answer, not believing he just did that. He felt a little guilty about it towards Steve but he had slept with Bucky and he was still upset about it. While he was wondering what Steve would say, he received another message, saying it would be great. Tony smiled and got out of bed to get dressed.
''Hey, Steve- oh, dear,'' she said when she noticed Tony next to him, smiling. ''Hey, Peg!'' he chirped and walked past her, straight to the bathroom. Steve leaned against the doorframe and shrugged. ''I'm sorry, he came to my house and he wanted a drink but he just wouldn't stop... I don't know if you know what's going on but-''
The next morning Tony woke up in a good mood. He got dressed in his maternity clothes and grabbed some coffee in a to-go mug and went on his way to Steve so they could go to the doctor together.
''Is that a trick question?'' he asked as Steve couldn't keep his eyes away from the sonogram. ''Come on, Steve,'' Tony sighed, his knees beginning to shake.
Silence filled the room for a few seconds. Steve ran a hand through Tony's hair. ''I don't care,'' he answered then and kissed him passionately again.
''So Pepper doesn't know yet?'' Peggy asked while she was pouring some coffee into Tony's mug, smiling at him. He had gotten home a little late after the small party they had but she always understood. He wanted to stay longer but he knew he needed to rest more now since he was pregnant.
She smiled and interrupted him. ''Yes, I came home early last night. And when I went to his bedroom this morning I saw your note. Thank you for comforting him, I'll take it from here,''  she said and he smiled. ''Alright, thanks,'' he replied and turned around, hearing the door close behind him. He knew Peggy always had been a good parent to Tony but he was still worried about him, something wasn't right.
''She? It's a girl? Oh my god, honey, I'm so happy for you! A little daughter, oh she's gonna be so cute and I can braid her hair when she's older,'' Peggy said in excitement, tears forming in her eyes. ''I'm so proud of you,'' she whispered and placed her hand on Tony's shoulder. ''And don't you worry, alright? I'll help you with everything you need. Now and when she's born,'' Peggy promised him but it reminded him of Steve, feeling sad again. ''So what did Steve say? Was he excited?'' his godmother asked, not knowing what had happened before and Tony sighed, shaking his head. ''He missed the appointment. I went there so we could drive together but he had just gotten out of bed so I had to borrow his car,'' he explained but didn't want to tell her about Bucky. ''Speaking of him, I'm gonna bring the car back and tell him about it. I'll be back for dinner, I promise,'' Tony said and left.
Tony's mind was blank, not knowing whether to text back or not because, to be honest, it was a little inappropriate but when he thought about it, Bruce was cute. But he couldn't do that to Steve. Or could he? After a few minutes, he decided to text back.
Tony moaned out Steve's name and Steve took the opportunity to kiss him hard while pulling his cock out, stroking it a few times so he could reach his climax too.
''Peg? Where are you?'' Tony's voice echoed through their house and Peggy hurried down the stairs, peeking around the corner of the living room. ''Hey, darling. I just finished painting the baby room. Wanna see the result with the crib and changing table?'' she asked and Tony laughed, slurping the last of his milkshake before joining her upstairs, his eyes covered by Peggy's hands. ''Okay, we still have to go shopping for baby clothes but her room is finished! What do you think?'' she asked and pulled her hands back so Tony could open his eyes. Tony's jaw dropped down when he turned around in the room, the walls pink and Sarah's name beautifully painted above her crib while his feet stood on the white carpet. ''I- wow. That's all I can say, Peggy. Wow. This is beyond my imagination. Thank you so much. I wish I could've helped,'' he admitted but Peggy pressed a kiss on Tony's head and placed her hand on his belly. ''Don't you feel guilty about that. You are six months pregnant now and you told me your back aches a lot these days. Besides, I had a few days off from work and having her room finished now instead of doing it later is gonna save us much stress,'' she explained with a smile as she pulled out the elastic from her hair and breathed in. ''I'm going for a shower, darling. Are you sure you'll be okay home alone tonight?'' she asked and Tony glanced at her.
She answered the phone rather quickly and told him everything was okay and he could stay the night at Bruce's place as long as he would tell her what had happened.
Hi, guys! Took me a little longer to update this time, I was quite busy but enjoy reading this chapter! Thanks for the kudos and comments <3
''Are you sure?'' Steve asked a few minutes later, not wanting to take advantage of him but Tony nodded. ''Steve, I'm giving you my consent, okay? Stop asking and take me,'' he replied and that's all Steve needed to hear. It took nothing but seconds for them to get undressed and Steve licked his lips when Tony spread his legs, leaning on Steve's shoulders. Steve slicked his cock with lube and after a little preparation, he pushed himself into Tony with a groan.
Tony spends the night at Bruce's home. The day after has a very surprising turn of events. Someone he doesn't expect to see shows up at his doorstep.
Bruce didn't hesitate and nodded, getting in next to him. ''Just keep calm okay, it might be Braxton Hicks contractions. You'll be okay, I promise,'' he said, trying to comfort him. Tony nodded. ''Thank you.''
''Tony! Come in, Pepper and I were just about to call you, we've ordered three pizzas and we were thinking about going to Maya's birthday party later? You were invited too, right?'' he asked and Tony nodded. ''Yeah, I was, but, uh, I need to tell you something so could we maybe go outside or something?'' he asked and waited for an answer. This was gonna be hard.
Visibly relieved and happy, Steve bobbed his head up and down. “I’ll catch you later -- talk about plans?”
Carol propped her elbows on the table, interlaced her fingers, and rested her chin on her hands. “Ohhh, so the mysterious Rogers likes trivia.”
Honestly, it was probably one of Tony’s most precious belongings. Steve had drawn the room they had shared at the resort, the one in which Tony had suggested that they move in together. Just looking at Steve’s work, Tony felt the warmth and intimacy of their vacation, the place where they had just been with each other for a few days. He began to resent sharing this drawing with the evaluator, but the independent art expert said that they needed as many pieces by Steve as they could locate.
Tony tapped at the phone. Then sighed heavily. “He’s coming over to get it. So Rhodey, you can finally meet Peter’s art teacher.”
“Clint told Jan who told me that Steve wanted to rescue you. That might mean something to Steve, more than who likes his favorite films.”
Tony had already waited thirty-one days to go on a date with Steve. Maybe more, he knew he missed a handful of Thursdays in his count.
Thinking about it more, Mr. Steve was kind of perfect for Tony. They were a lot alike -- organized, intelligent, passionate, caring. Mr. Steve would look after his dad, and that’s what his dad needed. Someone to care for him, when Tony cared for everyone else.
Tony’s date actually giggled and batted her eyelashes as Steve turned his smile on her. What the hell? Steve’s date Daphne shot Sara a poisonous look.
Jan hadn’t even told him who was playing tonight. So he had no idea if he had anything to look forward to.
“I bought more than the cufflinks at the jeweler’s. Just waiting for the right occasion. I made reservations at L’Artusi for Valentine’s – was working on other ideas, like flowers, that sort of thing.”
“Mr. Stark? Mr. Stark?” Kamala knocked at the door. “Ms. Hill and Dr. Banner have a lead on those power cores you need.”
