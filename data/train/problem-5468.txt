he says sharply, planting his arms in front of his chest “You’ve got two minutes before I use you as target practice.”
Tony’s staring when he opens his eyes his pupils blown wide and fixed at the point where Steve’s lips close around his index and middle finger. “I think you can get out now.”
catching his breath, glancing down at his pants which were getting noticeably tighter and more uncomfortable by the second. His fingers twitching at finding themselves empty where Tony had been moments ago.
Tony’s managed to leave a trail of his clothing from the front door to the bedroom, dress shoes, pants, jacket, tie, shirt and boxers-somewhere by the foot of the bed in a crumpled heap on the floor.
to you.” Tony turns away from him sharply and jerks violently away from the hand Steve tries to put on his shoulder, “No, you
It protracted as they both read and re-read the golden text. Natasha growing impatient for an answer as her heels started to sink in the ground.
It hits him like a car, makes his body jerk, and every muscle momentarily seize. Talking and breathing, who needs that anyway, he’s gone blind he’s sure. Steve’s made him come like a horny teenager on prom night. He’s still pulsing making it pretty obvious -
you see on the monitor above Pine Barrens.” Tony shouts after Steve removing his helmet and doing his best to fluff his hair back up.
Anger mixed with betrayal churns in Tony’s stomach and rushes into the space between them, “You should have come talked to me, instead of…
is implied as he turns and sashays towards the exit; brushing off a few would be admirers on the way with a wave of his hand.
go get something to eat, you sound like The Hulk after Bruce has eaten a bad curry.”  She gives him a half wave as she leaves.
All Steve can manage is a whimper when Tony squeezes his hand around his cock. The angle’s awkward but Tony’s dextrous wrist pivots, twists and strokes all the way down to the base.
He’d murmur and Tony would go like he was in a trance, fooling himself into thinking he could keep hold of something so precious.
It’s true, he does - blushing, giddy and nervous all at the same time with frickin’ butterflies the size of Hawk Moths doing summersaults in his stomach. It’s his first time all over again as much as it isn’t, he’s got some twenty years’ worth of experience since then. Twenty years’ worth of tricks,
“Fine,” he bites, stalking over to the railing to watch the footage, leaving Steve standing there shaking. “Show me what’s so important.”
He knows it drives Tony wild when he absent-mindedly fiddles with the chain and leaves it visible above the collar of his t-shirt when they’re being debriefed; he catches the glance Steve throws him when he
The derelict warehouse swims out of focus, and Steve squeezes his eyes shut, let his body shake as the tears fall into Tony’s hair.
Steve looks up at him, the picture of innocence finishing what’s in his mouth, Tony sits there frozen, his hand inches from Steve’s face, “Something wrong, Tony?”
“It’s the security footage that was recovered,” The screen blinks. Tony breaks their eye contact to glance at the screen.
Steve says wiping a hand over his face, drawing in breath after ragged breath, trying to ignore his cock that's harder than it had ever been and throbbing where it's trapped against his stomach by the waistband of his shorts.
“What? Didn’t you see me? I was all over the news.” Tony glanced back over his shoulder, smirking and throwing his hands wide, “Were you not entertained, Steven?” Whatever bit Tony was doing, it was lost on him.
Tony looks sated, a lopsided grin on his face and a glow on his cheeks. He glances down and Steve follows his line of sight suddenly realizing what was sticking them together. Tony’s painted both of them from chest to stomach in stripes of white. He shrugs cheekily, “It’s been a while.”  It’s the last thing Steve sees before the remaining candles flicker and die.
Steve gasps, it’s too much, Tony’s hand is slipping in the sudden wetness and Steve holds onto him for dear life, bucking unevenly - his jaw clenched so tight he thinks he might break a tooth. Tony’s still pulsing- planting frantic sloppy kisses on his neck, his grip tightening giving friction and pressure where Steve needs it most until he’s coming too; clinging to Tony whose fetched up against his chest, grabbing fistfuls of his silk waistcoat,
wanted to try this.” He breathes shameless and wicked against the shell of Steve’s ear. His chest rolls forward pressing against him, pushing Steve back with his weight to get him to stand up. Tony shuffles closer slightly hindered by alcohol and the pants wrapped around his ankles, bites his lip when he looks down and uses his hands to line himself up.
“Yeah, I, caught my foot… I guess.” It’s like last week, only Tony’s more pliant and leaning on him like a soft weight, the scotch has made his whole-body loose.
wanted?” The line goes deadly silent and Natasha wonders if the other person has hung up. Until she hears the faint intake of breath.
The thought’s enough to make Steve pause, a deep-seated ache swells in his chest and pushes the air out of his lungs threatening to overwhelm him, he hasn’t seen Tony in
Steve knows how to get a rise from him, he closes his eyes, he opens his mouth and when Tony touches the wet dripping fruit to his tongue he sucks his fingers in with it.
Because it’s all so broken and Tony’s got Steve’s shield propped against his desk and all he wants is to throw the damn thing out, but it’s all he had left now.
“Sure… sure, JARVIS what it is,” Tony says disinterested, the post-coital glow still on his cheeks as his gaze flits from Steve’s eyes to his lips and back up again they both stand there is some suspended -almost-kiss.
“He needs me.” And there’s that flash of anger in Tony’s eyes again the sudden intake of breath like he might say something but thinks better of it. “I don’t have a choice.” He adds, trying to convince himself more than for Tony’s benefit.
premise. “Err… As much as I hate to ask Steve, but could you…” Steve leans over the side of the bed grabbing for the nearest piece of fabric littering Tony’s bedroom, he ends up chucking him one of his discarded t-shirts from the floor.
“You have a dog?” Natasha asks glancing nervously at Ilona as she picks up a black and white print from the table. It was a diffusion tactic,
should have hung up on you ten minutes ago.” Natasha ends the call with a smile on her face and silently makes her way back to her room.
He ignores the kick he gets to the back of his ribs from Tony’s heal and the saliva that’s leaked down his chin and onto Tony’s balls. His mind tuned into the sounds from above, he relishes the desperate keening Tony does when he can't keep control anymore and his whole body starts to shake thrusting erratically up into Steve’s mouth and wrenching at his hair like he’s pushing and pulling him away all at once.
Steve goes still and looks down; Tony doesn’t miss the tight expression on his face, he’s doing the same thing Tony is,
And we’re not talking one or two pieces here and there… He’s was equipping people for war.” He looks down like he’s ashamed. “It’s not… It’s not anybody else’s fight.
He laughs after they’ve gone, taking advantage of the temporary light source to crawl off of Steve’s lap and turn on a lamp.
gets there his hand pauses hovering just shy of opening it because the door’s already ajar, a soft almost golden light flickers from within. He pushes it wide to white pillar candles on every surface bathing the room in a diffused quivering glow, wax running down their machine perfect posts in abstract runnels, shaping them into something new, something that was perfectly artistic and irreplicable.
Natasha entertains the silence for a while watching Steve shift his weight from foot to foot and ring his hands, “Right, well I’ll catch up with you later.” She makes her move to leave, Steve’s fidgeting creating a gap large enough for her to slip past.
Steve can feel it, the pressure building, the sudden loss of any higher brain power as his balls jump up closer to his body, he doesn’t need to know how to breathe, or talk, because he’s gonna come, all over Tony’s hand probably, in the middle of the communal kitchen. He curls his toes against the smooth tiles on the kitchen floor.
“What do you think Skip?” Ilona turns to the enormous creature that walks up next to her and noses his armored head under her free hand. She scratches the smooth leather-like plates of skin with her fingertips and he shivers and arches his back.
Tony sets a rhythm that’s rough and frantic, pushing Steve further back into the counter resting his head and gasping into Steve’s chest as he bucks his hips working up friction of his own against his solid thigh.
The security tape starts to play a wide-angled view of the darkened museum rotunda lit by emergency lighting and nothing else, nothing worthwhile, nothing interesting. He’s not even sure he’s still interested …
Steve puts his hands up in a sign of defense. “OK,” then he sees it; the empty tumbler, a few brown dregs settled at the bottom and the empty bottle of scotch in the trash. He makes it to the sink and keeps his back to Tony whilst he fills a glass from the tap.
“I shouldn’t…” Tony says not budging an inch, his voice thick and low. Steve feels the vibration of him speaking through his chest. His fingertips resting lightly on the fabric of Steve’s worn t-shirt tickling as much as it thrills and stirring up some dormant animal part of him.
Rain had threatened that day, it had made the air sit heavy and close against her skin. Natasha pulled her jacket tighter around her shoulders and hunched down into the collar.
,” Tony eyes snap back to Natasha as she speaks, “She was special ops, on a team with Clint and me at SHIELD. We called her Ghost.”
“You know that big important thing she had to tell me? Well, turns out it was that she was leaving me.”
Steve reluctantly shuffles back, still on his knees and waits for some sort of cue that would tell him what to do next.
They haven’t exactly told anybody that they’ve been sleeping together for the past two months; Steve couldn’t even remember who had made the first move, it just sort of…
Once again, he resigns himself to being awake and he’s hardly surprised to find the light on in the kitchen, even less surprised at who he finds in there.
“You don’t say,” Steve mumbles following the rivulet of red that forks over Tony’s knuckles and leaning into him.
Nat heard her exhale a long-measured breath, her hand touching her neck again. “Maybe there are things
“It’s very therapeutic. I have one on the dartboard in my room.” She says matter of factly, “Pegged him right between the eyes,
“Need you.” Steve sniffed his neck before he groaned and rubbed his entire face against Tony's bonding gland. “Fuck. You smell good.”
Tony liked to think that he wouldn't have done it if he weren't so lonely and horny, but the fact was that he still found himself straddling his living room stool and shoving his cock into a tray of warm apple pie. He came surprisingly fast, cleaned up his cinnamon-filling-covered cock and dumped the entire tray into the trash. That should've been where the story ended.
They both knew that neither of them was going to last long during the initial round, so Tony didn't hold back at all when he felt that familiar tension building in his gut, ratcheting up into a pressure that pulled his balls tightly against his body, made his skin tingle and his cock burn until –
“Right.” Fucking vamp priorities, seriously. He pulled Steve's arm hard enough to dislodge the other vampire's grip, not so subtly stepping in front of him. “I can't allow that. Sorry. Maybe some other time.”
“What?” Clint asked, obviously just as discomfited by Tony's outburst as Steve. “Hey, man. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have –“
Steve couldn't tell him. This was already mortifying enough, he couldn't tell the very man who this doll was modeled after that he was cuddling it every night, for fuck's sake –
the world. Barnes is rumored to be responsible for more than 130 deaths over the span of seventy-eight years, all of which Mr. Stark has claimed were committed under duress and thus not liable to prosecution. After the events of today those claims may or may not be null, depending on the judge's verdict.
you home,” Tony said, hoping that his nerves weren't obvious in his voice. Steve nodded, shuffling his food around, and Tony put down his fork as he cleared his throat. “I kept thinking of what I was going to say the whole way over here.”
In lieu of an answer Steve leaned over Tony to catch his lips in a fierce kiss, his shoulder moving against Tony's in a way that told him that Steve had taken matters into his own hands. It only took a minute or two before Steve came between them, leaving a mess on Tony's stomach.
, putting more and more weight on it as Steve tried to find his breath again, blood pumping through his veins hard enough that he could feel it in his throat.
“Yes, of course,” Tony said quickly before Steve could even come up with an excuse, jumping off the rock and landing gracefully. Steve tried not to look too obviously at his crotch, only to discover that it was thankfully covered by a piece of linen now – which was very obviously tented by his still hard cock. Or maybe it was hard again? Whatever. “You need to go. Before it gets dark.”
“Excellent. If you would step down from the table please, I'll fill out your forms in the other room while you get dressed.”
“Brainwashing, yes, I know.” T'Challa leaned back in his seat, looking out at the stand where the lawyers were already sorting through their papers. “Convenient, isn't it?”
"Come on," he said, and Steve clearly pretended not to hear him for a second, licking a circle around his belly button like he didn't have a care in the world. "Steve!"
“Want to go home. Yeah, you said that.” Bucky crossed his arms as he leaned back in his chair. “So. What would you have to do in order to go home at some point?”
Orgasm hit him like a cresting wave, surging through him with enough force to leave him trembling in its wake, his abs twitching with the aftershocks. Steve came only a couple thrusts later, muffling a groan in Tony's neck as he squeezed his cock, making Tony grunt with oversensitivity at the sudden pressure.
“Now,” Tony said, the tone of his voice making heat curl at the base of Steve's cock. “You're going to put your dick in that tube so I can make it nice and tight for you. And when you're all set I'm going to stretch you open and fuck you. How does that sound?”
Tony seemed to have stopped struggling altogether, his fingers caressing the leaves with clear fascination. The plant was still stroking his chest, but now that Tony wasn't squirming away from the attention – well, it painted a very different picture altogether. Steve swallowed hard.
Former US General Thaddeus Ross put his career on the line earlier this year with his attempted incarceration of New York's favorite heroes – justifiably so, some may say. Now he is under fire for his involvement in the construction of a secret superhero prison, which by standards of the UNCAT (United Nations Convention against Torture) has been described as a slap in the face of human rights and shows just how cruel, inhuman and degrading the detainment and/or punishment of our heroes was apparently meant to be.
Steve snorted a weak laugh. “I'm balls deep in your ass, Tony. I think a bit of coarse language is the tamest thing I've done today.”
"Hey," Tony said and Steve couldn't help but smile at the sound of his voice. "Fuck, it's been way too long."
“Say it, Tony,” Steve said firmly, spanking him again before Tony could draw another breath. “Say you're none of the things he said you were.”
Tony flinched. “I – what, now?” Obie not-so-subtly pinched him in the side, and Tony realized that they must've discussed this while he was zoning out thinking about all the ways he was doomed. Now even more so since apparently his treatment was starting today. “I mean, yes, of course,” he said dully, and Dr. Yinsen handed Obie a document – probably the bill – before he waved Tony along.
"The authorities," Steve said, staring straight at the ceiling. "I don't know what you told them, but there's no way they'll just let me –"
“Jesus fuck!” Tony startled so badly that he fumbled the phone and Steve caught it on reflex, only getting a glimpse at what looked like arrow schematics before Tony ripped it out of his hands and hugged it to his chest. “I'm busy!”
The creature's back was turned to him, and Steve couldn't help the way his eyes slid down its shapely form, catching on the drops of water that glistened on its wet skin before they disappeared beneath its fur. It had a tail, small and stubby, that kept twitching in a way Steve would almost call cute, and its ears stood straight up from its head that was covered in the same dark hair that its legs were.
Steve hung up, dropping his head against the couch with a drawn out sigh. He checked the invite again, marking the day in his calendar before he walked into the bedroom, his eyes getting stuck on the doll.
He came in messy streaks all over their stomachs, every pulse sending shocks of pleasure all the way to the tips of his toes. His tense throat relaxed just enough to let out a moan as he rode through the tail end of his orgasm, breath punching out of him when Steve thrust into him hard, his hands clenching on Tony's hips.
“Yep.” Tony popped the 'p' with a small smirk, working his pants down his hips. Steve's eyes were immediately drawn to his cock, which was half hard in anticipation, and Tony grinned when Steve laughed under his breath as he started taking off his own clothes.
He almost choked on a moan when Steve thrust against him with just the right pressure to make Tony see stars and just like that Tony was
“Delete,” Tony cut him off with a frown. “Fucking bastards. You'd think they'd take a hint already.”
“Steve?” He made a punched out noise at the sound of his name, looking up to see Tony eying him with concern. “You alright?”
Sam's jaw clenched so hard that Steve swore he could hear his teeth grinding from where he stood. “Barnes, I swear to god –“
Steve's eyes narrowed at the challenge, the way Tony had known they would, and Steve reached out to grab Tony's shoulder for balance as he scooted forward. The sight of Steve's cock hovering right above one of the gaps in the braided design of the pie crust made Tony's breath catch in his throat.
"So -" Steve made a muffled noise as Tony mushed their lips together, his skin prickling when he felt the scratch of Steve's beard against his chin, overlapping with his own beard in places and Jesus fuck, that shouldn't be as hot as it was.
With that he grabbed Steve's dick and licked a broad stripe all the way to the tip, making an extra swirl around the head that was already salty with pre-come as his mouth watered at the taste.
Tony pulled his teeth out, haphazardly licking the punctures shut before he slid down Steve's body and clawed his pants open. Steve was pushing up into his grip, his whole body tense like he was poised to snap.
Tony twitched when Steve's whole body jerked as soon as Tony touched him. Steve made a choked off noise, tossing his head back into the pillows and gritting his teeth so hard that Tony could see his jaw trembling.
“Yeah?” Tony kissed him again, soft and sweet, and Steve melted under his hands, lying back on the bed as Tony settled down on top of him. “Did you think we would be naked like this?” Tony husked, and Steve snorted a laugh, letting his head drop back against the pillows.
Toni was on her feet in an instant, grabbing Pepper by the arm to drag her out of the room. “Onwards! To the coffee!”
Tony blinked sweat out of his eyes as he strained against Steve's grip, still kicking his hips up to try and reach –
could be Nomad in private,” Tony said with waggling eyebrows and Steve snorted, poking him in the side.
"Yeah, I know." Bucky finally looked away and Tony took a deep breath to ground himself. "But that's different."
“Oh,” Tony said, his voice small, and Steve shifted in his seat, biting his lip because seeing Tony so overwhelmed by pleasure, clearly having the time of his life, well...
Steve came like a shot, gasping out a moan as he pumped his come into the fleshlight, wishing he could watch it paint Tony’s ass, leak inside his hole –
Tony quickly pulled Steve into his side with a firm arm around his waist. “I have! He's my –“ He glanced at Steve for a second, hoping that he wasn't overstepping here. “Well, we're together. Have been for a while.”
Steve immediately ran to the living room to grab his phone and press call, pacing in tight circles as he waited for Bucky to pick up.
Tony made a non-committal noise as he stared out the window, his thoughts unwittingly drifting back to the doctor. Steveprobably
Tony's tongue on him felt like a shock, like getting struck by lightning, and Steve peaked again, or maybe he was still riding the same wave, his body suspended in pleasure unlike anything he'd ever felt before. It seemed to last forever, pulsing through him from the tips of his toes all the way to the throbbing in his ears, and Steve could do nothing but hold on and coast through it, shaking like a leaf in the wind.
To his embarrassment Tony could feel tears prickling at the corners of his eyes as he dropped his head onto Steve's shoulder and hugged him tight, letting Steve rub some of the tension out of his shoulders. He already felt pounds lighter than he had coming here and he couldn't help the small smile when Steve nuzzled the side of his neck. “That's my line, Cap.”
Tony gave him a grateful nod, turning back to the proceedings where the judge was just shuffling up onto the stand, about to start the trial.
It wasn't wearing a belt, so Steve shifted up on his knees and just pulled its pants down until the doll's cock sprang out, bouncing up against its stomach. It was big, not so big that it was intimidating, but still very generously endowed. Steve touched its cock, feeling utterly ridiculous for a moment until the weight and heft of it in his hand properly registered and he grabbed it tight, giving it a firm stroke. That was – something.
“Or maybe it's just not going to happen this time, and that's okay,” Steve said gently, kissing behind Tony's ear, and Tony sighed.
“You better not be saying what I think you're saying.” Tony frowned. “You have a right to need comfort. And I want to be here for you.”
“You and me both,” Sam said, pointedly not looking at Bucky who was not so sneakily checking out Wanda's... assets. Again. Steve sighed.
“I'm so full,” he mumbled against Tony's lips, gritting his teeth when Tony twisted his hand, his fingertips just barely grazing that spot deep inside him that made his toes curl with pleasure. Then he stroked it full-on, and Steve couldn't hold back the loud moan that tore from his throat as he squirmed on Tony's fingers, trying to get them even deeper. He could feel Tony's grin against his neck.
“Excellent.” Tony grinned at him, letting go of Steve's arm and wriggling his fingers, probably to try and get feeling back into them. “So what do you say we continue where we left off? No time like the present to test my strength.”
Steve gasped when Tony suddenly nipped him with his teeth, probably a little harder than intended because Steve felt a bolt of heat zing down his spine –
“What is it?” Steve asked, and Tony shrugged, grabbing two sheets of what looked like glass and putting his loot on the table.
"Glad to see you made it home. I'll, uh -" He pointed over his shoulder, walking backwards out of the room. "We should catch up, when you're not... occupied."
Through the haze he could hear Steve mumbling reassurances to him, things like “You're so good” and “I'm so proud of you”, and it was making Tony's heart swell with warmth, his whole body going slack with relief. They had played like this before, and it wasn't even the first time Steve had punished Tony to give him some closure over something that upset him, but it had never felt like this. Like Steve had reached for something deep inside him and pulled it out into the open, giving it a chance to heal.
But when push came to shove Toni had to admit that they worked well together. The whole team did, but Toni couldn't shake the feeling that afterwards, when they were getting shawarma, Steve's gaze lingered on her a lot more than the others. Which, okay, could probably be attributed to the fact that she was the one who almost died, but Toni had been getting these kinds of looks her entire life. She knew how to distinguish between appraisal and genuine interest.
Thank you so much for sticking with me through this journey and until we meet again I wish you all the best!
“Yeah,” Steve breathed, the warm air against his shoulder sending a shiver down Tony's spine. “Can't even see your cock like this. It's like I'm just jerking off.”
Great. “Any ideas on how we can extract Tony safel–“ Steve blinked. “Uh... Tony, what are you doing?”
Tony opened the door just in time to see Bucky zip up his duffle bag, hair tucked under a baseball cap and his arm hidden by a leather jacket and glove. He didn't look up when Tony came in, closed the door with a quiet click and set down the small bag he'd brought with him.
Steve stared at the at least five foot tall package that Clint and Bucky carted in on a wheelbarrow, setting it down with a heavy thump. He blinked. “What the –“
“I can't believe you didn't know,” Tony said breathlessly and Steve snorted, still so lightheaded from their kiss that he thought he might just float away.
T'Challa straightened his back and Tony thought he saw something almost defiant but decidedly cold in his eyes when he said, “We'll see about that.”
Steve could only stare, confused and more than a little horrified as Tony kept screaming, so loudly that the sound rang in Steve's ears even after he stopped. Then Tony turned back towards him with an impish smile.
But this was his first meet-and-greet that wasn't some sort of sponsored pseudo-date. He'd wanted it to be different.
“It's okay,” he said quietly, grabbing Steve's neck to pull him closer. “We're going to get through this. I promise.”
Pepper was silent for a moment before she sighed. Tony could picture her putting her head in her hands. “I don't like this.”
“Yes, you can.” Tony hoisted his hips higher, and Steve moaned so hard his throat felt raw with it when it changed the angle and let Tony slide even
He wasn't sure how exactly they made it to their bedroom after that, only that the feeling of Steve's mouth on his made his head spin so much that he barely knew up from down anymore. His brain only came back online when Steve pushed him backwards onto the bed, already pulling his shirt over his head. Tony took a moment to ogle Steve's bare chest before he followed suit, tearing off his clothes just in time for Steve to lean over him, pushing Tony's legs apart to bring them together, skin to skin.
Tony kind of wanted to shake him for blindly agreeing to those conditions, but more than that he wanted to kick Nick Fury straight in the balls. Though to be far, that urge came up pretty frequently even without extenuating circumstances.
He almost didn't notice when Steve pulled his fingers out, but the blunt pressure of Steve's cock brought him back to awareness just enough to spread his legs wider, his stomach curling with the anticipation of something finally filling that hollow void inside him –
“Please,” he said again, barely more than a whimper, and she grabbed his hair, tugging on it until he got the hint and climbed up on the bed, straddling her lap with his hands braced on her shoulders. He looked like he was barely breathing, his eyes boring into hers with so much pleading that it tugged at her heart strings.
“So you're serious? We're actually doing this?” Tony asked, and Steve leaned over to grab his hand, squeezing it lightly.
Steve chuckled, leaning back into Tony's hold. “Not something I want to do again, I don't think. But I'm glad we tried it anyway.”
it. The tube was long enough that it was just barely sticking out of Tony’s hole, and watching it expand as Steve’s finger pushed in was like a punch to Steve’s gut, his heart suddenly pounding. Fuck, that was hot.
Steve's cheeks flushed, but the corners of his lips pulled up in an almost shy smile. Tony quickly realized that he was still shaking Steve's hand, and when he loosened his grip Steve let go almost a little too fast, his hand clenching into a fist at his side. Well then.
“I know, baby,” Tony said soothingly, trying to keep calm because Jesus fuck, seeing Steve like this, already so out of control, was as arousing as it was terrifying. “You just need to do this one thing for me, okay, Steve? Then I can make you feel better.”
“Tuesday, had to get fitted, but I heard it works better when it’s custom made.” Tony grabbed the package out of his hands to start tearing it open, cursing when the tape tangled. “Scissors?”
“Steve?” He looked up, his heart dropping when he saw the unhappy frown marring Tony's brow. “You're not into this at all, are you?”
is that people are going to see me walk into a fucking sex toy factory, thinking that I got one to test it out!”
“Tony,” he admonished, grabbing his wrist. “Not where anyone could –“ He broke off when he realized that nobody
“You haven't seen anything yet,” he rasped, watching Steve's eyes go dark with lust at the sound of his voice before he went back down, swallowing Steve's cock like he was born to do it. He pulled out all the stops, fluttering his tongue over the head, licking the shaft like a goddamn lollipop before he took it so deep that he felt tears prickling at the corners of his eyes.
Tony's eyes flashed with gleeful delight before he walked closer, casually, but Steve could see the almost predatory glint in his smile as he stepped right into Steve's space, still keeping enough of a distance that they weren't touching. They might as well have been for how much it made Steve's skin prickle to be this close to another naked man.
Upon further review of the Accords me and my associates have worked out a few suggestions regarding the phrasing of some of the paragraphs, particularly those concerning emergency situations and first response calls (section 2, article 1, §5 and §6). Please find them attached in the document above. With these minor adjustments I am sure we can come to an agreement that will allow all of the Avengers to set aside their grievances and place their trust in the hands of the United Nations panel.
"Anyway. Next up, defense. I have my best lawyers lined up to make a case for you and Natasha is already combing through ex-SHIELD files to find whatever she can." He pushed the mirror into Bucky's hands, grabbing the scissors to clean them in the sink. "Trial's in a couple days. I'll get your therapists' reports regarding your progress with B.A.R.F and another one from Bruce and Cho –"
Tony planted his feet on the bed for better leverage, and Steve adjusted his grip, slipping it up just a tiny bit –
But the doll was warm now, probably from his own body heat. Steve stroked a hand down its left arm and marveled at how realistic it felt, despite the synthetic texture. The weight of it felt good in his arms and as Steve’s brain shook off the last vestiges of sleep he realized that he’d slept better than he had in months.
Steve chuckled, turning Tony around and walking him backwards into the spray, his hands sliding down to Tony's hips. Tony framed Steve's face in both hands to pull him forward into a kiss, not so subtly playing with the edges of his beard. Steve snorted, catching Tony's hands in both of his.
He moved on to Tony's neck then, and this time when Tony groaned he only had half a second of hesitation before he kept going, letting himself be comforted by Tony's fingers sliding through his hair.
She had no idea what to say to that, but luckily Steve pulled her close again, pillowing his head on her chest. Toni stroked his hair, humming some old song under her breath as the frantic heat inside her made way for a peaceful sense of contentment. She could see herself doing this for the rest of her life.
“I know, right?” Tony nuzzled Steve's cheek, grinning when he felt Steve's shoulders shake with laughter. “Hey, this is serious business. You're indulging my kinks.”
“General Higgins, United States Armed Forces.” Tony shook his hand, internally sighing at the death grip of dominance. Military guys and their pissing contests, seriously. “I was stationed in Afghanistan. Horrible thing, what happened to you.”
“It might be a mental disorder,” Obie said with a grim look on his face, his hand clenching painfully on Tony's shoulder. Tony struggled not to shrug it off, which he supposed was part of the reason why they were here. “My nephew's omega came down with one sometime after their joining too. Tony isn't bonded yet, but we've been looking for potential partners, and he keeps behaving... oddly.”
Toni groaned into her pillow, ignoring the judgmental look she could feel trained on her. It wasn't like she didn't deserve it.
this much, but here he was, his entire body on fire because Tony was playing him like a goddamn instrument. “I'm gonna – Fuck, Tony, I'm gonna come again, please keep –“
And then he pulled down the doll’s pants just enough to get at the synthetic skin on its hip. He threw a leg over it, shifting closer until he could take his hand away and – oh. Fuck, okay, that
Steve froze, so caught of guard by the sound that he completely let go, and Tony opened his eyes, looking at him with a mixture of surprise and concern.
“Ready?” Steve grunted and Tony nodded right as Steve lowered him down, his fingers clenching with every inch that was pushing inside him. Tony's mouth fell open at the stretch, his thighs trembling when they met Steve's and Steve was finally all the way inside, his cock stretching Tony open in the most satisfying way.
“Okay.” His voice sounded choked and Steve must've heard it because he lifted Tony's hand and kissed his fingers one by one. Tony could feel tears well up in his eyes. “Fuck. This sucks.”
Steve buried his nose in Tony's wet fingers with a guttural groan, hips jerking forward in an uncontrolled thrust. Tony barely had time to blink before Steve was lifting him with both hands, positioning him over his cock.
Tony did, shifting further up the bed until his thighs were pressed right up against Steve's, creating even more friction for him to struggle against. There was a twinge in his lower back, but it only made him more desperate to get Steve off, to do what Steve wanted so he could finally –
“Potts.” She smiled at him as Steve sat in the chair, stubbornly not looking back over at the man. His heart was pounding, his mind racing as he desperately tried not to think all the thoughts he'd ever had about the doll and its body, not knowing that he'd ever see those exact proportions on an actual
Steve shut him up with a kiss that made Tony's toes curl as he wrapped his legs around Steve's waist to give him better access, his breath hitching when Steve's chest brushed against his, grazing his sensitive nipples. Steve nipped at his bottom lip one more time before he moved down to trail a line of kisses along Tony's collarbone, slipping another finger inside him. Tony squirmed on the bed, not sure if he was trying to push up into Steve's mouth or down onto his hand, but Steve didn't make him choose, thrusting his fingers in as he licked a broad stripe over Tony's right nipple. Tony arched off the bed.
“Not that this isn't fascinating, but do you want to get to kissing before we both die of old a–“ His quip died on his tongue when Steve muffled it with his lips, hoisting Tony a little further into his lap until they were chest to chest, no space left in between. It never failed to delight Tony that with him perched on Steve's thighs like this they were at the perfect height to kiss without it being uncomfortable for either of them.
“Scott Lang,” the man said, crossing his arms with an exaggeratedly menacing look. His face was far too innocent to pull it off. “Y'know, Hank Pym told me to never trust a Stark.”
“Hey, yourself,” he said, and Tony pressed a kiss behind his ear that sent a shiver down Steve's spine. Which only made Tony do it again.
“Always,” Steve said with just a hint of teasing before his face turned serious again. “I wanted us to stand as a united front. With or without the Accords.”
He could feel the tension building, but in a way that felt completely unhurried, devoid of the usual restlessness that came with it. Instead Tony let it wash over him, his gut hollowing out at the same time that he felt
It wasn't Steve's best work, far from it, but that wasn't the point. He'd spent hours trying to emulate the exact shade of Tony's eyes, crafting every speck of gold and ocher that mixed in with the brown when the light hit them just right. Tony's lips were twisted into a wry smirk, the kind he gave Steve whenever he caught him doing something stupid but was nice enough not to point it out. Steve hadn't liked that look directed at him most of the time, but when he'd been sitting in a tiny room in Wakanda with only his sketchbook for company... he'd found himself missing it with a vengeance.
"Whatever you say," Tony said, eyes dropping shut as Steve worked his fingers into his hair, a smile tugging at his lips. "Whatever you say."
“How do you expect to fuck me with that if you can't even stroke my cock with it?” Tony gasped when Steve nipped at his earlobe. “You want to make it good for me, don't you?”
–“ was all he got out before Tony slammed him back against the wall and kissed him with enough force to knock Steve's head back against the plaster. Steve pulled Tony closer to grind their cocks together, and they both let out choked moans before Tony suddenly pulled away and Steve heard a thunk as Tony's knees hit the floor.
So, I know this isn't the chapter most of you were expecting, but I hope you still enjoy it ;) Thanks for reading!
Steve jumped when Clint clapped him on the back, giving him a wide grin. “Alright. Where’s the cake?”
Another slap made him realize that there was a familiar pressure building behind his eyes, the one that he was so used to suppressing, but being held by Steve like this, utterly exposed, made it impossible to draw on his usual defenses. “Seventeen,” he choked out, and the hand Steve still had in his hair tightened its grip.
“There is literally no correlation there,” Rhodey said, but a second later Tony felt his fingers burrowing back in his hair, stroking it evenly. Tony closed his eyes, purring under his breath. “You’re a spoiled brat, you know that?”
And something in him gave, like a pressure valve bursting, and Steve was coming with the force of a freight train, screaming as he clawed desperately at Tony's shoulders, trying to find something to hold on to, to tether him because he was going to splinter apart, oh god, he
“How?” Toni asked, unable to keep the note of desperation out of her voice. “You can't possibly – you don't know what you're asking, okay? I'm at a completely different stage of my life, and sooner or later –“
did, Tony,” Steve said, still in that calm voice that burrowed under Tony's skin like a mantra. “I'm asking what
“If Steve was my bond mate he'd be mine, right?” he asked, his fingers clenching on Steve's waist. “No one else could feed on him?”
Steve was probably going to knot his hands, but Tony was counting on that, sliding his hand up from Steve's balls to wrap it around the base of his cock instead –
That didn't make her feel much better, but if Steve had finally decided to have a heart to heart about their differences, who was she to deny him? “Alright.” Raising her voice, she said, “Sorry, boys. I'll join in next round. Gotta use the little girls' room.”
Steve's heart was pounding as he stared at Tony, his tongue tied because he'd legitimately just said it, just
Steve was about to retort when Tony wrapped a hand around his cock, slicking him up with more pressure than strictly necessary. Steve's mouth snapped shut. “Uh –“
with, legally speaking,” Tony huffed. He couldn't believe Steve was fighting this so hard. Unless – “Is there some other reason why it can't be me? If so, just tell me. I can take it.”
“That's right,” Tony said, drumming his fingers on the raffle machine Pepper had rented for the night as he gave the camera a charming grin. “Every ten gift coins means another ticket in the machine. Let's reach that raffle goal, gentlemen. Who's it gonna be?”
Steve breathed out heavily against his shoulder, the hot air making Tony's skin prickle with goosebumps as Steve loosened his grip, letting go of their cocks. “Holy shit.”
Steve had half a thought of trying to make a quiet exit when it suddenly turned around and Steve almost swallowed his tongue.
“So what happened?” Fury interrupted loudly, giving Bruce a stern glare. “Was it an untested pathogen? Is it contained?”
Tony stood up and turned his back to the camera, making a show of ruffling his hair with both hands before he slowly bent down and presented his ass to the camera. This part always came easy. Tony had a lot of practice making people pant over his body, and doing it for money was just an added bonus.
Steve smiled sheepishly, and it was so charming that Tony couldn't resist pressing a kiss to it. “Yeah. I know it's not... but it feels –“

But his eyes caught on the way his come looked streaking its skin. Without thinking Steve swiped his fingers through it, smearing it on the doll's stomach and swallowing hard at the picture it made.
“I don't know what you mean,” he said primly, and Steve laughed, bringing a hand up to probably cover his smile as Tony rolled onto his back, testing the way he'd stacked everything. When he found the perfect spot he pushed himself back into the mass of soft fabrics, creating the divot that he and Steve would be sleeping in later.
“Avengers business?” she asked, and Steve's mouth twisted as his eyes darted around the room, landing anywhere but on her.
Steve choked on his protest when Tony reached down and guided Steve's cock to his hole. It slid in easily, the glide so smooth that it made Tony's breathing hitch as Steve's hands came up to hold on to his hips.
“Yep. No complaints here.” Steve pinched him in the side and Tony couldn't have wiped the grin off his face if he tried. “We still got it.”
a boy scout,” Steve teased, and Tony just gave him a shit-eating grin, already squirting some of the lube into his palm.
“That won't be necessary,” the vampire across from him – Ignacio? – said flatly, taking the paper from him and stuffing it in a folder. “Welcome to the Council, Mr. Stark.”
, like Steve was giving him something too, and Steve squirmed restlessly, already desperate to feel the drag of Tony's cock against his walls again. Tony gave him exactly what he needed, lifting Steve up and pushing back inside until Steve felt like he would
“It does,” Steve said quietly and Tony took a shaky breath, glad that Steve couldn't see his face right now. “But we'll get through this together. I promise.”
“You gotta go again, huh?” Tony asked and Steve nodded frantically, lapping at Tony's hole before he moved on to his spine, leaving kisses all the way up to his neck. “What, four rounds not enough for you?”
“This is what you wanted,” Ilona says dropping a weathered manilla file onto the desk, a few stray photos spread out and slide along the worn leather surface of the desk.
“Some people lost more than others that day.” She says letting it sink in, letting the silence creep back over them, watching Steve get truly uncomfortable and pull at the straps on his hands.
The question of who was doing the fucking was answered the moment Tony melted against Steve’s chest in the common room, that being said-it still doesn’t make it any less of a surprise when Steve’s fingers are inside him, stroking, curling and touching every-damn-nerve.
“A friend. Somebody I trust with my life.” She looks for a reaction. “I’m going to get the file tomorrow.” Steve nods.
Steve still awkwardly holds the scotch bottle in his hands, “You’re drinking again,” he says and watches the whole of Tony’s back go tense.
Tony moves closer offering him the half-bitten fruit, lifting his eyebrow up like he’s daring him to take it.
Steve is lost; somewhere between wanting to grab the back of Tony’s head, telling him to make good on his promise from earlier, or just lying there and letting Tony take him on his terms. He grits his teeth, hands flat against the gratuitous silk of the sheets as his body flinches …
Tony was lost in his thoughts over-tightening a screw on the chest plate of the mark 46, his heart’s not really in it. He wasn’t sure what was more embarrassing, what he was coming to refer to as
He knows it’s a power exchange; Tony Stark loves the fact that he can reduce Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, AKA THE Super Solider, to putty in his hands with a few well-placed sweeps of his articulate tongue, hell he wouldn’t put it past Tony to put it on his resume, and damn if right now Steve isn’t completely OK with all of it, encouraging it even – after all he was the one who wore his tags… He doesn’t even try and stop his hips from bucking when Tony works a hand under his balls.
Steve wraps him up in his arms, cupping his hand to the back of his head, tilting it to the angle he wants, feeling the rasps of his beard on his jaw when he licks into his mouth; it builds from slow and steady, the tentative kisses when Steve still isn’t convinced Tony’s not going to vanish from his grip to something frantic and desperate, the
Steve gets ripped out of the moment so fast he almost gets whiplash. JARVIS’s voice echoes around the workshop, “I wouldn’t want to interrupt, but I believe that I have found something pertinent to the ongoing investigation into the break-in.”
, but they’ve brainwashed him and it felt like I’d lost everybody all over again,” Steve takes a measured breath, and Tony coughs a little like he’s stopping himself from saying something. He leaves out the part about the nightmares.
beautiful the way his bare chest had flinched under his fingers, the way his breath had caught, and he’d shut his eyes and relaxed into the feeling, letting Tony have his way, letting him explore until there wasn’t an inch left Tony hadn’t kissed with the dulcet sound of Steve’s soft moans in his ear.
Steve leans in for a slow and deliberate air stealing kiss. It’s a distraction whilst two fingers become three, sliding in and out in time with him lapping his tongue into Tony’s mouth; Tony wants to give as good as he’s getting but his whole body feels like its turning to pliant mush under Steve’s ministration and all he manages is to dig nails into Steve’s shoulders and breathlessly mutter,
“I like you so much,” Steve mumbled into his hair, and Tony pinched him in the side until Steve pulled back to look at him, his eyes catching on Tony's cheeky grin.
Steve coated his fingers with lube before he prodded at the tiny hole between the doll's legs, pushing his middle finger inside. It felt impossibly tight, and Steve could already imagine the way it would feel around his cock, sucking him in just like this as he fucked it as hard as he wanted because it wasn't real, it didn't – it didn't –
Steve moaned, high and reedy, and Tony looked up as Steve's head snapped back, the tendons in his neck straining. He felt it when Steve came, his cock throbbing against Tony's as his hand kept moving, a blur between their bodies, and god, Tony couldn't –
Steve watched incredulously as the plant wrapped another vine around Tony's waist to make him stop struggling, its leaves swaying eerily even though there was no draft in the workshop. “What the hell is that?”
Steve nodded as he followed Tony's example, tugging his pants down his thighs before he stepped out of them. Tony was pleased to note that he was already hard, his cock thick and flushed. Then again, with the serum it didn't take much to get Steve going. “Do you straddle it? Or –“
“I'm sweaty,” Tony deadpanned, but Steve only hummed, rolling them to the side until Tony was looking straight into Steve's twinkling eyes.
“Looks like we're all in, folks! Any donations from this point forward won't be going towards the raffle draw. But they'll sure be appreciated.”
Tony could feel Bucky freeze next to him as he fought down a grimace. “Sergeant Barnes has been in psychiatric treatment for well over a year now. All of our recent evaluations have been overwhelmingly positive, so there's no reason to –“
“Come on. You never thought about it?” Tony's fingers traced a line down the buttons of his shirt. “What's hidden under here?”
"You like it, don't you?" Steve asked, looking up at Tony with knowing eyes that twinkled with amusement and arousal alike. "You want me to go down on you?"
Steve seemed to feel it too, his grip on Tony tightening although he didn't speed up, staying at that same languid pace. If asked Tony would've said that there was no way he could come like this, from this little stimulation, but somehow it was getting him there anyway, a gradual ramp instead of a steep incline. He felt like a wind-up toy that got cranked one gear tooth at a time, slowly but inevitably climbing towards that moment of release.
“Shh,” Tony said quietly, kissing the side of Steve's neck. “I'm a lot bigger than you're used to, sweetheart. Let me make sure you're ready for me.”
happen. They ripped into her character, the moral implications of a relationship like this at her age. They called her a sugar mommy and Steve a gold digger, painted their love as something nasty and vile.
“Because the guy was a douchebag and I don't want to give him the satisfaction,” Tony said firmly. “Don't we have anything else to post?”
“You like that idea, don't you,” Tony said smugly. “I know you do. Remember at the theatre last week, when you had me on my knees? Like this I could be there right from the start, even with the lights on, and get you off in full view of
“Oh, Captain,” Tony sighed, batting his eyelashes hard enough that Steve broke into a laugh before he stood up to scoop Tony into his arms. “I thought you'd never ask.”
“Don't mention it,” Tony said, keeping his tone light. “You can choose the restaurant next time, right?”
“That's good, Tony,” Steve said, voice hitching on a moan, and the praise washed over Tony like a warm balm, fanning the heat in his gut –
“Yes.” Steve clutched his basket tighter, feeling a little like he had missed a step somewhere. “You, uh... I guess I'll see you around?”
The date wasn’t awful. In fact, Tony found himself forgetting all about it as they fell into their usual banter, catching up on what Steve had been doing in DC and all the projects Tony had been working on. It was… nice.

“Well, I'm not going to let you throw yourself on this sword for me,” Steve said firmly, and Tony rolled his eyes heavenward, silently praying for strength.
“Oh,” he breathed quietly, and it felt awkward to make any noise in this context, but Tony clearly didn't mind if the way he threw his head back and moaned was any indication. Of course, that could also be his reaction to Steve's fingers sliding back inside him.
“Tony, why are you texting in here?” Pepper hissed, glancing around the court room. “Put down your phone.”
“Leave it to the professionals, buddy,” Clint said from behind them and Scott frowned. Steve took pity on him.
“I always keep my promises,” Tony said right as he slid a finger inside Steve, all the way to the hilt, and Steve's eyes snapped shut at the stretch, his back bowing as he tried to accommodate the intrusion. “You've done this before.”
“Wouldn't expect anything less,” Steve said and felt himself relaxing when he realized that it was true. He knew just how capable Tony's hands were.
“Ready?” He asked, not even waiting for an answer before he lined up and sat on Steve’s dick, grunting under his breath at the stretch. Steve’s grip tightened almost painfully, but Tony didn’t pause, sinking down until he was sitting all the way in Steve’s lap –
“I missed you today,” Steve murmured and Tony hummed, tilting his head back when Steve's nose pressed against the side of his neck, lips just barely grazing his skin. He smiled when he felt Steve's hands travel down to his hips, squeezing his sides on the way. “Kept getting distracted.”
Tony could feel the presence of other vampires at their backs, and he didn't need to feel the sudden tension in Steve's muscles to know that they were in danger. They had to get out of here before –
“Yeah, those,” Tony said, though it came out slightly choked when the plant bounced him up and down. Steve took a deep breath.
Steve laughed, pressing a kiss to Tony's nose before he reached for the shampoo and squeezed some into his hands. "Alright, fine. I'll keep it for the week. But after that it's coming off."
A quiet noise from Steve made him look up and cross his arms, trying to look as dignified as possible while staying halfway buried underneath a mountain of pillows. “What?”
Tony hesitated for a moment before he took off his jacket, prompting Steve to do the same. He discreetly checked out the way Steve's arms moved as he was sliding the fabric off his shoulders and draping it over the couch. There was an understated grace to his movements that belied his small stature, and Tony found that he kind of liked it. It was rare that he was the bigger man – literally – in one of his sexual encounters.
A bit of practical research showed that chances of Steve hugging him or spontaneously cuddling him in front of others went up by thirty-six percent when Tony was wearing soft clothing. The rate at which Steve started purring when Tony was massaging his temples increased exponentially with how soft of a touch he used. And that one time Tony wore a fluffy jacket Steve practically molded himself to his back, barely letting him out of his arms.
Tony couldn't hold back a surprised laugh at that, but Steve looked more smug than offended, so Tony took that as permission to smirk and say, “I'll show you what I
“I missed you too.” Steve sounded about as choked up as he felt and Tony couldn't help but laugh helplessly, his fingers tangling in the hair at Steve's nape.
“That's good, sweetheart,” Steve said, the low undertone in his voice sending a shiver down Tony's spine. “Keep counting.”
Steve could only nod in response, shifting his stance wider to give Tony more room as Tony fingered him open. He hadn't done this since before the war, but his body still remembered how to relax around the intrusion, to push back on it so he could make it easier. The dulled sensation of it weirdly helped, and Tony had barely pushed in a third finger when he shook his head, reaching back to bat Tony's hand away.
When they parted Tony didn't go far, his lips still brushing Steve's with every word as he spoke. “Was this what you imagined? When you were...”
“A plus one thing.” He could see that Steve didn't know what he was getting at so he elaborated with a sigh. “All vampires are required to bring a human to those meetings. I think they call it a bond mate or something.”
“Ready?” Steve asked, and Tony nodded quickly, his skin tingling with anticipation as he lined up his dick and pushed it into the pie.
“Steve!” Tony called, drawing Steve's attention towards him. “Calm down. It won't let me go if we don't do this and besides, you'll be right here watching.”
He smiled when Steve made a choked noise behind him, right before twin thumps told him that Steve had successfully rolled out of bed. Tony dumped their clothes onto the bathroom floor before he stepped into the shower, sorting through the many bottles of body wash.
Rhodey clearly heard the dejection Tony was trying hard to hide because he put a hand on his shoulder and squeezed. “Do you have options? Hormone therapy? I’ve heard that sometimes they can kick-start a heat with a compatible alpha –“
Mr. Secretary, I agree that these Accords are necessary, but I would hate to make Captain America an enemy of the state.
“You've done it before,” Pepper said, not even looking at him from where JARVIS was projecting her face onto a holo screen above the bed. “And you're not having sex with him anyway.”
“Reasonableness and the American way,” Tony mumbled, already halfway off to sleep. He could still feel Steve's smile pressed against his temple as he drifted off in Steve's arms.
Steve bent down, ducking his head in the water to quickly rinse out his hair before he climbed out of the pond and reached for his –
His first thought was that it was hot, Steve's blood almost scorching his tongue, warm and heady and
It came over him in a rush, sudden and unexpected, and Tony rode that wave all the way to the top and tumbled over into free fall, his stomach swooping as his cock jerked and pulsed against the metal, his balls drawn up tight against his body. He came down faster this time, breathing hard around a whimper as the machine kept rattling against his raw flesh –
“I'm full of surprises,” Steve deadpanned, smiling when Tony chuckled. “We both agree that the Accords are flawed and that we can't trust Ross.”
“Now, now,” Tony said, his voice lowered into a purr, and Steve felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up. “We both know you don't
“Hydroelectric generator,” Tony corrected, deciding to let it slide for now. “Remember general asshole? The one with the bush-stache?”
“I'm twenty-four years older than you,” she finally said, and Steve's eyes flashed, his grip tightening.
“Hey, no, it's fine,” Steve said, pulling Tony closer. Tony let out a shaky breath, surprised to find that his hands were trembling. “It's not bad. I wouldn't – I mean, whatever you do on your own, that's your choice. I'm not going to judge you.”
“Can’t wait to do this for you,” Tony mumbled and couldn’t suppress a smile at the noise Steve made at that, eyes snapping up to meet Tony’s. He could feel the bed rock ever so slightly with the movement of Steve’s hips and wished he could see it better from here. “Look at you. You want your cock in my mouth?”
He hadn't quite realized how much Steve had been holding back until the moment Steve allowed himself to let go, straining against the cuffs as his back arched and he thrust up into the air, groaning as Tony watched his cock rub against the fabric of his boxers.
His mouth was so warm, heating up even more with the friction of their lips rubbing together, and he already felt pleasantly sore as he rubbed circles into Steve's cheek with his thumb, tilting his head a little for better access. Steve squeezed his hips in return as he deepened the kiss even more, licking at the roof of Tony's mouth until Tony shivered at the touch, verging on the edge of ticklish.
"Hey, it's okay," Tony said gently, grunting when Steve suddenly pulled him on top of him and wrapped him up in his arms and legs. Tony chuckled, patting Steve's shoulders with both hands. "I thought the octopus thing was my shtick."
Toni flipped him off. “I'm old, not deaf, asshole.” She looked up when someone sat down next to her, smiling when she saw it was Steve. “Hey, there, handsome. Having fun?”
“Yes, Obie,” Tony said with a false air of obedience that he could tell didn't fool Obie for even a second. But with the doctor in the room Obie couldn't do much more than scowl at him before he left the office and closed the door with a little more force than necessary.
“It's not even noon. Don't jinx it.” Tony poked him in the side and Steve caught his hand, pulling it around to interlock their fingers on his chest. “I love you, Tony. You know that, right?”
“Hot damn,” Tony said with a dazed expression when they finally pulled apart, both of them panting heavily. “I don't know what I did to deserve that but please keep going.”
Steve hadn't done this in a while, he realized as he reached underneath the blanket and grabbed his cock through his sweatpants, taking a deep breath through his nose as he slowly but surely stroked himself to hardness. He didn't get started right away, just closed his eyes and enjoyed the sensation of his cock filling out against his thigh until it lay thick and heavy on his skin, tenting the fabric of his pants. Shit, but he'd always liked this part. The anticipation of it.
Tony was beautiful, made even more so by the cocky smirk he wore as he laid back on the bed, spread his legs and crooked a finger at Steve. “Come here.”
“Not in front of our boss we don't,” Steve hissed and Fury rubbed a hand over his face before he waved them off.
“Uh...” Tony looked around the room, presumably for something that might be useful in his escape, before he gave Steve a sheepish grin. “Think of something?”
Steve looked at him for a long moment before he wiped a hand across his chin and sighed. “We never did talk about why you signed the Accords.”
Steve groaned, breathing wetly against the side of Tony's neck. “Yeah. Gonna –“ He choked on a moan that raised goosebumps on Tony's skin. “Gonna fuck you right. Good.”
By the time he had three fingers in him Tony was squirming impatiently, apparently done with whatever discomfort had held him back before.
Tony grunted, hips hitching up when Steve gave another hard suck, and Steve pulled back to lick over the mark a few more times before he moved back up to fit their mouths together. Tony's hands tangled in Steve's hair as he tried to guide the kiss, but this time Steve pushed back, and Tony met the challenge with delight, his blood boiling with a sudden rush of adrenaline as they fought for dominance.
Steve came with a shout, his hips stuttering as his body tried to fuck into the tube and push back on Tony's thrusts all at once, his cock throbbing so hard he could feel it in his ears, filling the clear tube with murky white liquid. Tony fucked him through it, and Steve had barely made it through the tail end of his orgasm when he felt sensation hit him like a punch in the gut as his oversensitive cock twitched within the tube –
And the worst thing was that Steve seemed to know it too, always strutting around with no scent suppressors, stinking up the air with those alpha pheromones that made Tony’s skin itch. It took Tony a while, and more than one screaming match, to figure out that Steve actually didn’t know any better. Apparently the forties had been some kind of magical let-it-all-hang-out land where it was perfectly fine to flaunt your status like it was nothing.
"Not as long as I'm here," Tony promised fiercely. "I swear on my life, no one can touch you while you're under my protection. And if you think the rest of the Avengers would let them get within ten feet of you you've got another thing coming. Especially Steve."
Pepper gave her a long look. “You know that it's okay if you want him, right? Fourteen years is a big age gap, but you're both grown ups who can make their own decisions.”
Toni slid her hands over his muscled pecs, raking her long nails down his stomach and abs, and Steve jerked underneath her, his hips canting forward on instinct when she reached his waistline and traced it with sharp fingertips.
“That's a given, I think,” he said, already a little breathless. “You want me like this? On my knees? Or maybe –“

Steve could imagine it all too well. His hand clenching around the pole as he tried to keep from thrusting up into Tony's grip, Tony pressed up against his back so he could rub off on Steve's ass –
Tony made a soft noise, his clothes rustling as he probably sat down somewhere. "I'm sorry. You want to talk about it?"
“Fuck, you're good at that,” Tony sighed, and Steve closed his eyes, concentrating on the task at hand because Tony's words felt like fire under his skin. Nobody had ever told him that, and Steve knew it was because you generally didn't
Tony snorted a laugh before he walked inside with a huge grin, courtseying as he passed Steve. Steve looked almost a little smug as he let the door fall shut behind them, and Tony had to admit it was a little cute. Okay, maybe more than a little.
“You miss it?” Rhodey asked, raising an eyebrow. “I thought you hated leaking. You chewed my ear off about it all the time in college.”
“This isn't working for you, is it?” Tony asked, and Steve looked away, unable to face the disappointment he knew Tony had to be feeling – “Hey, Steve. Look at me.”
He flinched when a hand came down on his shoulder, but Tony didn't go further than that, just let it rest there like a comforting weight to anchor Steve. It probably should've bothered him how much it calmed his nerves.
When Steve woke up some time later he was already dressed, down to his socks and boots. Tony was sitting on a rock next to him, holding a pipe and gazing off into the distance. Steve had barely made a noise when Tony's head whipped around to face him, his eyes softening in a way that made Steve's heart lurch in his chest.
“Did anyone listen?” Tony averted his eyes and Steve sighed, running a hand across his face. “We can't leave them as they are. You know that.”
“Make sure I get the keys, yeah?” she mumbled, and the boy nodded like she'd given him the most important mission of his life as he fetched her Chevy. Steve grumbled in protest when she waved the keys at him and made him climb into the passenger seat, but Toni just patted his thigh and told him, “Buckle your seatbelt, bronco. We're going for a ride.”
Short summary of Keep Boredom at Bay (warning: spoilers if you're planning on reading it at some point):
Secretary Ross stated that he and his staff are “working day and night on the verification of Mr. Stark's testimony and evidence.” So far they seem to have remained unsuccessful.
His nipples had stopped leaking at some point, but Tony's chest was still sticky with it as he slid his fingers over his skin, a cautious sort of hope building up behind his ribcage.
“Is that good?” Steve asked and Tony nodded, leaning onto Steve to give him better access as Steve made quick work of scissoring his fingers until he could slip a third inside. “I'm so hard, Tony...”
We are glad to hear that the additional signatures have been approved. The updated terms of the UN issued house arrest regarding Mr. Barton, Mr. Wilson and Ms. Maximoff have been relayed and met with approval by the Avengers' legal team.
“Your perception of satyrs may not be entirely wrong,” Tony conceded, and Steve's heart started pounding as he clutched his trousers tighter against his bare thighs. “But contrary to popular belief I do recognize when someone is not interested. I'm not going to try anything with you, don't worry.”
Steve nodded, watching as several emotions crossed Mr. Stark’s face before he settled on wry amusement, sticking a hand in his pocket to dig out a business card.
“Let’s lie down,” Tony said and Steve nodded against his neck, guiding them over to the bed where they lay down on their sides. The beard was new but everything else about the sight of Steve was so
“I can do that,” he said huskily, so she took her hand away and let him try. It took a bit of trial and error until he found the right position, and when he pushed down Toni bit her lip, trying not to grimace too obviously.
“Nope, just used a gauntlet. Groin piece doesn't come off that easily.” Steve made a choked sound, and Tony turned to gave him an amused smile. “You like that thought?”
, his tongue digging firmly into that spot right underneath the head that always made Tony see stars and oh god, he wasn't going to make it -
,” Steve repeated, and this time Tony couldn't stop himself from joining in as Steve broke down in giggles, leaning heavily onto his chest. “Oh my god. How the hell did we get here?”
Steve choked down a gasp at the last second, his legs shaking when Tony's fingers squeezed the head of his cock, his thumb rubbing right across the slit. He only realized he was holding his breath when Tony nipped at his tight throat, his goatee scratching the side of Steve's neck.
Tony didn't roll his eyes, but it was a near thing. More like after his father's death he'd finally started voicing his opinions in front of other people, without fear of the possible repercussions. He hadn't factored in that an omega who thought for themselves was apparently a medical mystery. How utterly charming.
The plant pushed Tony's thighs even further apart, folding them up against his chest and putting him completely on display. Steve couldn't help but think that it was doing this for Steve's benefit, giving him the perfect angle to watch as two more vines came up to trace along Tony's ass before they drew a path across Tony's thighs all the way up to his cock.
“This is so dumb,” he breathed, and Steve barked a laugh, his head thumping down on Tony's shoulder.
Tony burst out laughing, ignoring the half-hearted slap to his waist. “You took me to the kitchen? What the hell, Steve?”
But then Steve hit his prostate, his lips twisting into a satisfied smile at the noise Tony made, and Tony couldn’t think of anything past
Still, the envelope was addressed to him, so Steve shrugged and opened it, pulling out the weirdly thick feeling paper. He skimmed through the first couple of paragraphs – then went back and read them very carefully. Then read them again, his eyes going steadily wider.
“Okay. Good.” Tony fiddled with the phone in his pocket, feeling a bit like there was a mental block between him and his usual small talk banter. Like his words mattered more than usual. Which was absurd because Steve was just like all the other guys he'd sucked off for a picture, aside from the meet-and-greet thing.
the one who decided morning sex was a good idea.” He ran his hands up and down Steve's back before he clasped them behind his neck, pulling him closer. “You better finish what you started.”
Furthermore the captured Afghan criminals were quick to come forward with information about their attackers, among which were several African soldiers and an enhanced individual who fits the description of the vigilante Nomad. Continued reports have shown that Nomad poses a threat not only to our democratic values, but also to the integrity of the UN security network. We cannot allow this individual to keep acting in his own interests. Therefore the UN has decided to deploy the Avengers in order to apprehend Nomad.
Case in point the subway pulled into the next station and opened the doors. An elderly couple shuffled in, barely sparing him a glance, but Tony still pushed down on his cock to force it flat underneath Steve's pants. Which would've been considerate if not for the fact that it made Steve's skin prickle with the friction of fabric against his sensitive cock.
“Yeah.” Steve pulled away just enough to grin at her, and Toni felt her heart lurch in her chest at the look in his eyes. “I really am.”
Dr. Yinsen's smile widened, and Tony had the distinct feeling of being played like a fiddle as the doctor stood up to call Obie back inside. Obie gave Tony a sour look when he walked in, putting a hand on Tony's shoulder as soon as he was next to him, looming with a slightly distrustful look at Dr. Yinsen.
Steve went into the adjacent bathroom to grab a towel and put it down on the bed before he lifted the doll out of its box and carried it over. It was surprisingly heavy, almost like a real person, and something about that was so creepy that Steve shook out his hands as soon as he put the doll down, trying to get rid of the sensation. The doll was wearing clothes, a pin-striped suit that made Steve once again wonder just how much this thing cost, and it took him at least a minute of internal debate before he found the courage to try and open the button of its pants.
Steve felt like he was floating, his chest filled with sunlight, and he struggled to push himself up enough to press a kiss to Tony's jaw before he slumped back down, his muscles still feeling like jelly.
Steve winced, but there was a clear determination in his eyes when he nodded, looking her straight in the eye. “Yes.”
Toni knew that people would stare, but she was used to that kind of attention, barely even noticed it anymore. Instead she watched Steve like a hawk, waiting for the moment that he would realize that he couldn't deal with the kind of media shit storm that came with being seen in public with her. In a romantic setting no less.
Steve swallowed hard, briefly feeling the urge to hide from Tony's all too knowing gaze. But then he straightened his shoulders and tilted his chin up.
Tony hummed when one of Steve's hands slipped into his hair and pulled it back, baring his throat to Steve's hungry kisses, and Tony couldn't hold back a groan when Steve nipped and licked his way down the side of his neck. His eyes fell shut, hand clenching on Steve's shoulders as he let Steve suck a hickey just under his jaw, where it would look like nothing more than a shadow thrown by his beard. Tony felt that familiar thrill of a shared secret light him up with heat, thinking about how the next day nobody would suspect a thing, but Steve would take one look at him and
“That's disturbing,” Clint said drily as his eyes twitched over to Sam and his cheeks flushed. “Fuck, I hate this. I'm not even into dudes.”
He grunted when Tony’s nails scratched over his shoulder, desperately trying to grab hold while his other hand was a blur on his cock. Steve could see tiny drops of sweat on his forehead and he itched to wipe them away, or maybe just lick them off –
“All's fair in love and war,” Steve said, and Tony pinched him in the side, leaving his hand there to grab Steve around the waist and hug him close.
"Who do you think I am?" Tony asked haughtily, reaching inside his bag and brandishing the hair cutting scissors and electric razor he'd brought. "I always come prepared."
. Steve bit his lip when he felt blood rush to his cock in response to those words. It was a pavlovian thing at this point, knowing that whenever Tony said those exact words he was about to indulge Steve in something he craved but knew he shouldn't.
“That's very kind of you,” Tony said blandly. “But as you know, Stark Industries has stopped manufacturing –“
They both turned to see the Wakandan woman hiding a smile behind her hand before she straightened up, giving Steve a curt nod.
Steve snorted. “I'm not sure I can even move right no–“ He gasped when Tony patted his softening dick, his thighs twitching spastically. “Fuck. If you keep doing that I'll –“
He opened the drum, wiggling his empty palm at the camera before he stuck his hand inside and rummaged around until his fingers caught on a slip and he pulled it out, holding it up over his shoulder with a cheeky grin.
“Are you sure?” Steve asked with a tiny, worried frown creasing his forehead. “I’ll probably rut. If I’m off suppressants –“
“Yeah,” Tony groaned. “Fucking arc fucked up my glands. And my hormones are all over the place trying to deal with the palladium. I haven’t even been in heat this last year.”
They will retire. But those who agree, and I suspect that it will be the majority of them, will be the first line of defense for us and the countries that choose to stand with us.
He arched his back, trying to push down on Steve's cock, but the motion just made his chest rub against Steve's, sending a stinging rush of pleasure through his raw nipples –
Tony was quickly running out of breath, but he couldn't tear his lips away, too invested in remapping every corner of Steve's mouth, his heart beating so fast he could feel it in his throat. Steve tasted just like he remembered and even though he hadn't exactly forgotten, it still hit him all over again that he'd
Before Steve could protest Tony took several steps away from him, still with that same encouraging grin. “Alright. On the count of three. One, two –“
Steve blinked a few times before he closed his eyes and really thought about it. What Tony was offering him was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Steve had only had a few experiences here and there, even been fucked by a man before, but none of them had been anything to write home about. There was no doubt in his mind that with Tony it would be
“I think that's everything,” Steve said tiredly, giving everyone around him a small smile. “Debrief adjourned. You can go now.”
To the public she'd had one foot in the grave for years now. And who cared if they counted every wrinkle on her face like it said something about her, that they speculated about every plastic surgery under the sun.
“How was she? I mean –“ Steve sniffled, quickly wiping his nose. “When you knew her. What was she like?”
Bucky smirked, crossing his arms over his chest. “I don't know. Why don't you tell me how you feel about me first?”
Steve bit his lips, his throat locking up tight because he didn't want to tell Tony, it wasn't his fault that Steve couldn't adjust – but Tony deserved the truth.
Tony ignored him, walking out into the living room to inspect Steve's couch pillows and the throw that was haphazardly draped over the side of it. Two of them passed muster and Tony nodded decisively as he dragged them over to the bedroom, past a rather flabbergasted looking Steve.
“I'm sorry. It's not really something you needed to know. I just do that to get off, like using a sex toy or – whatever.” Tony shook his head, swallowing around the lump in his throat. “It's not – I mean, I don't –“
“Tony,” he hissed under his breath, and Tony hummed, more vibration than noise against the back of his neck. Steve bit down on a moan when Tony pressed them firmly together, still scratching at Steve's crotch as he ground his own erection against Steve's ass.
No, nothing happened,” Tony said quickly, sitting up to give Rhodey a serious look. “I told you, nobody touched me.”
take him out, and in time all the headlines proclaiming her age as front page news faded into background noise. It wasn't hard to ignore everyone else when at home she had Steve looking at her like she was a goddess, like she was
“You're insane,” Steve gasped out even though he could feel his cheeks straining with how hard he was grinning, and Tony laughed, stepping off the bed to wrap his arms around his waist.
He heard Tony take a sharp breath, his fingers tightening around the phone on reflex. "But you would?"
He looked up at her with a question in his eyes right before she felt a second finger prod at her entrance, and she nodded, tilting her hips up to make the slide easier as he pushed it in. She jolted when his tongue pressed down right on top of her clit at the same time as his fingers grazed over that spot deep inside her, the sudden friction dragging a moan from her, long and loud, her hands clenching in his hair. Steve echoed the sound when she tugged him forward, a little roughly, her hips jerking as his tongue jostled her clit with tiny licks.
Steve grumbled something in acknowledgement though he still didn’t look too happy about it. Tony grinned.
“Me too,” Steve rasped out, sounding utterly wrecked, and Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's neck to hold on as the heat low in his stomach ratcheted up to almost unbearable levels, his thighs spasming with every other thrust.
“And I’m grateful every day.” Tony hummed when Rhodey stroked a hand through his hair. “Look, I’m sorry you don’t lactate anymore. Did the doctor say it’s permanent?”
– “You're going to feel a release. There's a lot of tension right now, but if you just relax and let it happen you'll feel so much better, I promise.”
, Steve could handle. He let Tony guide him down until he was hovering over his cock, grabbing the base firmly before he swallowed it down in one go, just like he had every Saturday in the back alley behind Arby's –
Steve was silent for a moment, but he kept stroking Tony's back, so Tony wasn't too worried. He knew it was a lot to process.
Steve glanced up at the map on the side of the car. Five stations. He could do five stations, no problem.
Tony clucked his tongue, giving Bucky one last look before he lead the way inside the conference room, a wide smile on his face.
Steve quickly fell into his rhythm, and soon enough they were both humping the pie with leisurely strokes, their dicks brushing every now and again when they timed it right. Tony wanted to focus on the pleasure, the sucking noises of the filling as he pushed his cock into it, but –
Tony looked up at Steve as he went back down, sucking on his cock in a pulsing rhythm, and Steve cursed, fumbling for the shutter before there was a flash and Tony closed his eyes so he could concentrate on taking Steve even deeper. It took him a few more tries to find the right angle, but on the next one he let Steve's cock slide all the way down his throat, shuffling his legs to accommodate the new position.
“Steve Rogers,” Steve said, extending a hand, and the vampire's eyes only flicked up to Steve's face for a split second before they settled on Tony.
“So, what do you do?” Tony asked, throwing an arm over the back of the couch as he turned his body towards Steve a little more, trying to make himself open and approachable. Hopefully put him at ease, for fuck's sake, the guy's posture was making
Tony pumped his fist, not sure why exactly he was so excited about this. Maybe it was because this was the first good idea he'd had for his stream in quite some time.
Tony was pretty sure he could've fallen asleep like that if Steve's obvious sniffing hadn't brought him back from his almost slumber. “What are you doing?”
The vine around Tony's cock had made its way almost to the very tip of it, enveloping the entire length in winding green tendrils, and Steve's cock throbbed in sympathy, his own grip tightening in tandem. He started stroking himself, quickly realizing that he'd unconsciously mimicked the rhythm of the vines pushing into Tony's ass, squeezing at the tip on every other pass.
He could see Steve's back flexing, thighs and ass clenching as Steve started thrusting against the bed, getting himself off on the mattress, and Tony wished he could see it, watch Steve's cock, hard and flushed, slide against the sheets as he -
Instead he kept writhing in Tony's grip, sobbing out wrecked groans that sounded like they were rubbing his throat raw. Tony kept going for as long as he could, but eventually he had to admit defeat as his hands started to cramp, his arms feeling weak with exhaustion. Steve whined when Tony let go to shake out his hands, meeting Tony's gaze with a lazy roll of his head, his eyes glossed over with a hazy sheen of desperation.
“Alright. Everyone say 'I'm feeling lucky',” Tony said before he hit the button on the side of the machine and it whirred to life, spinning the drum as the tickets inside tumbled all over themselves. Tony walked around the machine until his back was facing the camera before he bent over the table it was standing on, propping his head up on his hands and watching the tickets fly round and round.
If everything goes well I might be able to negotiate the terms of my incarceration so I only do minimal jail time. In any case I really hope to see you when I touch down, even if it's only for that day. And obviously I'd love it if you could come visit me in prison.
“Alright,” she said, her voice a little strained as she pushed herself up onto her arms so she could see him better. “Your other hand goes here.” Toni slipped her fingers down her vulva, parting her folds until she could press down on her clit, massaging it in tiny circles. The feeling sent a zing of sharp pleasure up her spine, making her twitch, and Steve sucked in a breath, his eyes dark as he watched her touch herself.
Since Tony was an omega the abstinence clause had never come up in his own contract – not going into heat regularly was beyond detrimental to an omega's health – but for alphas it was a different story. They were prone to battle ruts which could hinder missions in more ways than one, and since rutting didn't have any substantial impact on their sexual health it was perfectly legal to ask an alpha to sign up for year-long suppressant treatments.
The tube was tight, no question. But still, the sensation was barely more than a tease, like the tickle of a feather. He knew it wouldn't stay like that though.
Tony walked over without thinking, dropping to his knees right between Steve’s legs, and the feeling of Steve’s hands on his shoulders made the dam spill over, pulling a whimper from his throat when Steve wrapped him up in his arms.
Steve sucked in a breath, and when Tony looked down at him he was trembling like a leaf in the wind, looking almost a little afraid.
Tony looked up when the door opened – and fought not to allow his body to tense up at the sight of the alpha that stepped into the room, a clipboard under his arm and a white coat draped over his distractingly broad shoulders.
Steve looked like he was barely hanging on as he stared at Tony, his eyes flickering all over him, from his face down to where Steve's cock was disappearing inside him and back up again. He kept making those tiny wrecked noises that were caught somewhere between a gasp and a moan as he shoved his cock as deep as it would go. It took barely any time before Steve sped up, his face twisting into something even more desperate as his hips jerked against Tony's, losing any discernible rhythm.
“Tell me to stop,” Steve begged in a low voice that sent shivers down Tony's spine. “If you don't – Tony –“
Tony quirked a smile. “We have mountains of evidence to back up our claims. Why wouldn't I?” He pointed at a man in the back. “You, yellow shirt.”
Tony sighed heavily, pulling a bag of nachos out of the pantry. “I can gain that back no problem. You know that.”
He kissed Tony silent before he could say anything, trailing his hands back down to Tony's hips and over his ass –
Steve had heard stories about the faun. Satyrs. Creatures of the forest who liked to seduce men and women alike. But he'd never expected to see one of them in the flesh. No one in his village had ever met one – or at least they'd never talked about it – and the fact that Steve would be the first to have this kind of encounter seemed... unlikely.
“The suit is not a weapon,” Tony cut him off stiffly. “It’s an extension of myself. No one but me will ever wear it.”
“Yeah,” Tony said, trying to hide the way his heart lurched when Steve said his name. He must not have managed it very well because Steve's eyes twinkled with mirth as he grinned.
It was biology and hormones and all kinds of shit that made Tony sway on his feet every time he entered a room Steve was in, that made Steve's pupils dilate in return, made Tony's eyes flick to his lips and stay there, imagining all the ways he could bite them red. From up close Steve's scent almost made him dizzy with want, his fingers tingling with the urge to touch.
“I'm gonna –“ The thundering of Tony's pulse in his ears drowned out whatever it was that Steve said next, his back bowing as the heat in his stomach suddenly ratcheted up to an almost unbearable degree.
“You live where I live,” Tony protested, but Steve had already left the workshop, his lingering scent only cementing what just happened. Tony let his head drop onto the counter, a groan stuck behind his teeth.
“Tony, what –“ He broke off when Tony held up a hand as he stood up, taking a breath so deep it seemed like he was about to dive underwater –
"I understood that reference," Steve said, sounding more fond than actually joking, and Tony shuffled up onto his elbows, groaning at the strain it put on his back. He really wasn't getting any younger.
“How are you feeling?” Steve eventually asked, and Tony considered that for a moment before he frowned.
Pepper had already laid out his outfit and shoes on his dressing chair – again, just a chair in the storage closet, but she liked to make it sound fancy – and Tony didn't waste much time putting it on, brushing his teeth and slapping on a bit of make-up for the camera. He took a moment to put on some eyeliner, smudging it to perfection, and when he eventually realized that he was going over the same spot for the fifth time he accepted defeat and stopped stalling.
Steve jerked, eyes snapping open when he realized where exactly that had come from, glancing over at the doll. It was still lying next to him, exactly where he'd left it the night before, its eyes staring unseeingly up at the ceiling.
Steve took a deep breath before he seemed to steel himself and looked up at Tony. “I want to try it. With you.”
“Sorry,” Steve murmured, sitting back just enough so he could watch Tony’s ass swallow the tube, his skin tingling with arousal. “How does it feel?”
“I bet you say that to all the cam boys,” Tony said teasingly, trying to keep his voice light, but Steve looked at him as if he could see right through it.
with a squeeze to Steve's cock that made Steve bite down on his lip. “You better not come until we get there or this might get really awkward.”
As mentioned in previous correspondence the Sokovia Accords are meant to enforce guidelines for the deployment of enhanced individuals in combat situations. As one such group the Avengers will henceforth fall under UN jurisdiction and no longer be recognized as a private organization. The exact details of this arrangement can be found in section 2, article 1, §3-12.
Also in love and bonded and yadda yadda yadda, but that wasn’t what made Tony realize just how much Steve loved burying his face in Tony’s extra soft nesting pillows. And his sweaters. And his skin, which – yeah. Could be a little distracting.
“I got you,” Steve murmured right before he took Tony’s dick in his mouth and Tony stopped thinking altogether.
“You sure?” Steve gave him an unimpressed look and Tony rolled his eyes. “Okay fine. Restraint it is.”
Tony looked at him from under his eyelashes, and Steve had to admit, the sultry look in his eyes was shockingly effective. “You're going to love this then.”
Tony felt his heart pound against his ribcage because that sounded like... “So you'll sign them? If I can get that clause written into the Accords?”
Toni watched his throat bob as he swallowed before he seemed to steel himself, closing his eyes for a second before he looked straight at her.
“He saved my life when he didn't have to. I know that he can do whatever he puts his mind to and he's dead set on making the Accords the best that they can be. Why wouldn't I trust him?”
“You're sleeping here and that's final,” Tony said, crawling up onto the bed until he was sitting between Steve's legs, his back pillowed on Steve's chest. “Now hush, we're watching NCIS.”
“Shh.” Tony leaned down to press a kiss to Steve's mouth, smiling when Steve immediately pulled him into his lap to deepen it. Steve seemed hesitant to take control, so Tony licked into his mouth, exploring him for a couple of seconds before he pulled back, resting his forehead against Steve's. “It'll all be fine. You'll see.”
“Was there something you didn't like?” Steve's voice was quiet, but Tony could still hear the nervous edge in it. “I went a little farther than last time, so –“
“If you had the kind of kill record I have, would you not want to be held accountable?” Bucky was looking at him so intently that Steve felt his skin crawling with nerves. “Wouldn't you want to make sure that nothing like that can ever happen again?”
“Good.” She grabbed his hand and led him to her bedroom, stopping only when they were standing right in front of her bed. Steve looked like Christmas had come early, but underneath that she could see just how nervous he was, so she squeezed his hand reassuringly before she guided it to the back of her dress. “Could you get the zipper for me? It's a little hard to reach.”
Steve wasn't sure he could. It already felt perfect, his cock nestled snugly inside the tube that was warming up slowly, adjusting to his body heat. But he nodded, bracing himself before he started pulling out –
They ordered their pizzas and sat on the bar stools right next to the counter as they waited. Tony tapped his fingers on the bar, propping his head up on his free hand as he looked at Steve.
"If you say so." Steve gave Tony a lingering kiss, but when Tony leaned up to deepen it he put his knee right in the wet spot on the bed. Tony grimaced.
Tony wrinkled his nose. “Shit. You're right, I didn't think of that.” He thought about it for a moment before he shrugged. “Ah, well. It's still good publicity.”
His usual sponsors were slowly trickling in as Tony rolled around on the floor, letting the camera catch the way his lace harness draped over his ass. He'd chosen it on a whim, but apparently his donors liked it, judging by the usual slew of compliments that filled the chat. It made it easy to slip into the role of Dave, camboy and blowjob connoisseur.
, right here in the flesh – “First of, thank you so much for participating in our beta testing phase and taking the time to give us this interview. We're very happy to have you.”
, Tony,” Steve said with a spectacular eye roll. Then he smirked. “But if you think you're too old to make out in the shower, grandpa –“
She looked back out at the landscape, leaning over to put her head on his shoulder. Steve stiffened for a second before he put his arm around her, and she happily shuffled closer, thankful that she'd remembered to pick a car without a middle console in the way. She could feel his heart pounding where her cheek was pressed against his chest.
There was a moment of silence as Pepper rifled through his words while Tony clutched his bowl with white knuckles – “Okay. Sounds like a plan.”
Steve grabbed his coffee cup just in time before Tony slammed a package on the table, rattling Steve’s eggs and bacon. He sighed. “Is it worth assaulting my breakfast over?”
“Holy shit,” Steve panted, and Tony laughed, bright and loud, before he pressed a kiss to Steve's nose.
He caught the way Steve's hands curled into fists before Steve hid them in his lap. “So, uh. You like to... fuck pie.”
“Not because I support the Accords,” Steve said quickly, his face twisting into a grimace. “They're going to need a lot of work before I can really stand behind the UN. But –“ He took a deep breath. “I can't let this be the reason that the team falls apart. The most important thing is that we all stay together.”
Tony's lips disappear from his as quickly as they came, Steve finds himself staggering backwards in surprise and looking down at a blushing Tony as fireworks start to light up the city. “Err… Happy New Year Captain?” Tony shrugs, Steve had never known him look so unsure of himself as he went to rub at the back of his neck, forgetting that it was damn near impossible when you were still in armour. “Well, I should, you know…” a very pink eared Tony doesn’t even bother with an excuse before he goes to leave. Steve panics and grabs for his arm.
“-because she’ll lead us straight to Bucky,” Tony’s the only one with the right vantage point to see Steve's eyes glaze, his hand drops from where it was resting on Tony’s chest taking the warmth with it. Something constricts in his throat.
“Right! Well, there’s a massive energy draw over New Jersey,” He starts leading the way down to his workshop aware of Steve’s bare footsteps behind him.
Tony goes limp and pulls away, moving back to sit and wipe his hair out of his face. He hears Steve whimper before he watches him roll sideways. “I-told-you-” He smirks still winded and catching his breath as he crawls up the bed. “You wouldn’t be able to move once I was finished.”
“Yep, these cages’ll hold until the moon comes back up. Then poof!” Dugan does a theatrical wave with his hands. “Damn things turn to dust. New moons always bring them out. Though not usually
“We were all teenagers once Tony.” He breaks eye contact batting his perfect blond lashes. “Do you have any…” He trails off leaving Tony to read between the lines,
His eyes gradually look up from under clumpy dark lashes and relief washes over Steve because they’re no longer blown wide with panic.
“OK, could use an extra pair of eyes, you might see something I missed,” Tony says quietly and lets himself be steered out of the kitchen and into the large TV room adjacent.
Tony looks up scowling and Steve blushes as deep and red as he did in the kitchen, his fair skin giving him away, the tips of his ears burn and he
Needless to say, no sign of forced entry was ever found, except for the broken lock on the cabinet.”
He paces, restless by the door a while longer, listening for the tell-tale whur of electrics starting up; before he gives up heading to his room. Tony was home, Tony was safe. He could at least get some sleep.
Suddenly it doesn't matter. It doesn’t matter that Steve’s a novice and hasn’t got a clue what he’s doing and it’s super strength and stamina and something else Steve can’t quite place that’s making this work. Steve pause tingling all over, he wants to say something. Tell Tony how sorry he is
“You interrupted us to tell us that?” Tony angles his head away from Steve irritated at the AI, sounding like he might be trying to shut him up. Steve still isn't entirely convinced he’s breathing he can hear the conversation between the two, but it sounds miles away.
“All I see is grainy security footage, send them my card. Maybe we can kit them out with something that will show them more than just a few pixels.
They enter a hallway-come-foyer, it’s clean enough. A few ominous stains mark the cream threadbare carpet and the wallpaper is peeling in places. There’s a welcome rush of fresh air that comes in through the open door at the end of the hall where Ilona stands peering at them.
along with those Helicarriers, everything pertaining to SHIELD was seized, including, but not limited to-“ Natasha paused for effect “-everything that was in that warehouse. It may have been Tony’s property, but they were under Government control awaiting an emergency sort and destroy.” Steve’s face goes grey. “So,
Steve says a little louder than he means to and raking a hand through his hair. “I’m happy that you’re talking, but this.” He waves from the tablet to the tumbler then to Tony, “This isn’t going to help the situation.” He pauses long enough to give Tony a pained expression. “Look there’s a team investigating, we won’t know anything until morning, and drinking is not going to help. Jesus Tony, I sat with you whilst you had a
“Kiss me,” he says looking wild as Steve climbs out steadying himself against Tony’s solidity and leaving big wet handprints on the sleeves of his white shirt, turning it see through in the process.
Tony’s not home by the time Steve decides to call it a night; the remainder of the day had been spent overlooking the witness reports from the security staff that Pepper had sent over. All the reports were consistent but vague, everybody interviewed gave the same story, they had seen something out the corner of their eye, but couldn’t be sure, then nothing-they had woken up a few hours later with a bad headache and a ringing in the ears. Natasha had sat with him for a bit to frown over the reports but was oddly unhelpful and dismissal of Steve’s theories.
He says seething, jabbing a finger at the monitors as it replays the moment the display cabinet opens. “What are you playing at Romanoff? What’s Nick Fury set you up for this time? Or maybe it’s not him at all.” Tony takes a threatening stride forward Steve intervenes splaying a hand on Tony chest.
What… what was that?” Tony can’t really go anywhere with Steve’s hand clamped on his wrist so he dares to make eye contact.
“I can see that.” She sounded normal and close as she took a cautious step out from the shadows of the willow. Face obscured deep in the folds of an enormous hood attached to a loose-fitting jumper. “Been a while Nat.” She said her wild eyes flashing a phosphorous green from the depths of the fabric.
“Right, and err… Don’t mention it.” Steve sighs still bracing against the counter watching Tony shuffle off towards his workshop muttering to himself.
His secret world he had built with Steve lay in ruins. He put a wall up brick by brick to keep himself strong, to block it out, now he can feel it collapsing, taking him down with it until he’s curled under his desk, knees pulled up to his chest.
“JARVIS,” Tony swallows before he speaks, “What the hell was that thing?” It’s making him feel sick, that’s no human. Not from earth.
what’s not fair…” He trails off as his voice loses its power, blinking at Steve owlish and lost. “I thought we were… I mean we could of…” he chokes stepping forward so far into Steve’s space that a deep breath from either of them would mean their chests touched. He’s so close he can see the bloodshot pink of his eyes and the unkemptness of his beard that was a few days past due a shave.
Tony’s mouth goes dry. It’s a loaded question, an ‘if I say yes to this it means we're going all the way’ type question.
They watch ‘the thing’ crouch, the green light glinting off a blade it pulls from its boots. The actual picking of the lock is blocked by its back. There’s the distinct moment when the display case door opens which is followed by a blinding green flash that blows the camera and abruptly ends the playback.
It’s the first time in a long time that Natasha has seen her in anything other than loose clothes, she stands in shorts and a long-sleeved t-shirt the pale skin on her long limbs making her look almost wraithlike. “Hi Nat,” she makes a show of draping her arms across herself looking around Natasha to address Sam, “Hello,”
“You should have. We could have flown in formation. Had a sort of ‘welcome home party’.” Tony all but skipped down the short flight of stairs to his workshop.
like they both needed it to live. He thrusts his hips and Tony’s right there to return the favor, there’s no friction, just the smooth glance of skin on skin that makes Tony arch and groan.
She breathes a sigh of relief on finding it empty but still tiptoes through, her skin alive to any shift in the air that could mean she wasn’t alone. She pauses when passing the TV room. Somebody was snoring, it was Steve stretched out from the corner of the couch, with one hand resting across his chest and the other wrapped protectively around Tony who was curled into his side scrunching his face up in his sleep and clinging to him. “I could have told you
he says shaking his head and waving his arms in front of him, “I’m out, done…” He turns, about to bolt down the stairs.
There's a shuffling, what sounds like a rifling of papers followed by a clearing of the throat. “I got waylaid-“ the response was cut off by a sleepy yawn, “But it’s all here, what you wanted, as promised.”
In his workshop, there’s nobody there to ask if he’s alright, nobody to ask him where he’s been, nobody to see him spin absently in the office chair, his eyes waxy and his expression lost to the fifty-yard stare, because suddenly everything in here reminds him of Steve, the wound that never really healed ripped wide open again.
as any iota of sleep evaporates from his lover in a rush of blood to his groin. Steve never ceases to be impressed at how quickly Tony Stark can go from apathetic to emphatic when there is something that he wants on offer; and tonight, he’s made sure he’s got something Tony wants. Awake and pressing himself against Steve a hand runs over the chain around his neck as he feels something rock solid grind against his thigh.
take his breath away. He goes still, locked in that bright blue gaze as Steve’s arms wrap around his ribcage holding him where he is. “Steve … I …” the kiss steals the words he didn’t say, and Tony Stark,
it was coming out all wrong, but Steve was looking at him now, something close to sadness and hurt in his eyes, “It, err… Well,
They stand in awkward silence, the atmosphere building to something thick with all the things that are going unsaid. Steve looks furious, every muscle in his jaw pulled taut as he glares down at his desk.
his hand still firmly clasped to the back of his head, the other resting in the small of his back so they’re touching as much as possible. His eyes flutter closed as he inhales the comforting scent of Tony. All the things he’s missed mingled together in the scant breadth of traded air between them. He smells of clean clothes, freshly washed skin that’s been dabbed with cologne and it throws him back to the first time he stood naked and blushing in front of him, back when Tony had gawped in disbelief and dare not be anything but gently in case Steve bolted. His whole-body floods with warmth at the memory, it makes his knees shake and threaten to give out and he goes back in for a kiss only to have Tony nose away with a coy smile on his lips.
Tony’s got the swagger he gets when he’s had a few too many, he swings his hips and snickers crowding Steve into an alcove that marks the entrance to a supply closet. “Do you know how hard it is to keep my hands
“I’m sorry, I… I didn’t mean for this to happen… I asked Natasha to help me find him after the helicarriers and he disappeared,
The moment the door closes behind her Natasha knew she was screwed, the intended stealth mission back to her room went out the window and smashed on the street below when she snuck back in from the fire escape and came face to face with Steve, and shield or no shield the guy cut an intimidating figure when he stretched up to his full height and puffed his chest out so he was as wide as he was tall.
” How chivalrous of Steve to remember his manners when asking for something so debauched. It’s the only encouragement he needs; he’s so hard that he can feel his pulse in his swollen cock.
Tony had let the world fall away in those stolen moments. Got himself lost in everything Steve. Let himself think that maybe it was love, let himself believe it was when he lay awake wrapped up in Steve’s arms who must have thought he was asleep when he’d whisper: “I could lay here forever with you.” His breath the softest tingle on the back of Tony’s neck.
Tony’s watch rattles when he speeds up and Steve feels like he’s going to fall apart, everything’s getting slick and messy, he’s panting, gripping Tony like he’s desperate like he’s the only thing that’s still holding him vertical.
“So this is a Captin America sized fuck up?” Tony finally says, “He’s really that important to you huh?” Steve looks up and he’s still wearing the same tight expression he had earlier like there’s a whole lot more he wants to say but he’s holding it back with a thin-lipped grimace.
It’s hard to say with a mouthful, Steve hums pointing his tongue and pressing it against Tony’s slit. His whole body goes tense and he curls around Steve letting out some strained growl as the hand on the back of his head turns to a claw and digs into his scalp pushing him back down until he’s got Tony all the way to the back of his throat again.
“It serves you right for leaving it on the floor. You’re messy Tony.” He pauses steadying himself on legs that haven’t quite recovered. “Case and point,” he gestures to the room strewn with clothes and pieces of armour, before gesturing at Tony with a smirk who stops his clean-up operation in mock indignation.
muscle in Tony’s body seems to tense around him at once and the splayed hands that were resting on his chest suddenly turn to claws and catch like barbs on his skin. Tony sounds like he’s trying to speak, mumbling inarticulate sounds and arching his back as Steve pushes in deeper, sliding in right to the base.
You had best come in then…” The furthest door opens cautiously and the vibrations abruptly cut off. Sam looks like he’s ready to sprint back down the stairs and keep it up all the way back to Manhattan. He’d been training with Steve, Natasha wouldn’t put it passed him.
The whole scene depicted is unsettling, something about it creeps at the back of Steve’s neck and makes the hairs stand on end. A few downed security staff that look stone dead on the floor in-between an endless sea of filing cabinets. They weren’t dead, oddly nobody had been badly hurt. There were so many variables that didn’t quite add up enough to make sense, and the whole situation had put Steve and Tony back on the same insomnia cycle.
The champagne bubbles in his nose, it tastes wonderful and he even feels a little giddy, he reasons it
“We nearly sent out a search party.” Steve said, still hot on his heels, “We were ready to scramble the quinjets!”
Steve obliges and steps back dropping his head as he does so. Tony shoots him a glance confused by the sudden change as he steps forward and it’s Steve’s turn to look at his feet. He shifts uncomfortably out the corner of Tony’s eye, who can't quite believe what’s strewn open on the desk.
He doesn’t waste any time, he rips his boots off, half hopping half running as he yanks his pants the rest of the way down and kicks them away.
Steve pushes down to meet him and Tony loses any scrap of self-restraint. He rips his fingers away wiping what’s left of the (by now) body temperature lube across his stomach.
who’s unlatching his belt and pulling his pants down to his knees; Tony Stark who everybody wants, and Steve is
uniform!” He sits up to point at the pile of red, white and blue on the floor, “And this,” he gestures to himself t-shirt screwed into a ball in his hand,
He’s so keyed up that all it takes is three firm strokes and he’s coming, shuddering and gritting his teeth under the spray, curling his toes against the unyielding floor and throwing a hand out against the wall to steady himself as guilt, confusion and pleasure slip down the tiles in great splotches of white.
“Wake her up NOW! This-“ he gestures to the screens that have now gone blank, “-This is her little stunt, I what to know what her friend is and I want to know
God, he loves it when Steve wears them. He knows that he does it on purpose, it’s one of the few games Steve will indulge him in.
, Clint had even given it a shot and left a powdered sugar handprint on the handle from his doughnut. It was Pepper, god bless her who had used her override and eventually unlocked the door.
as he watches him rummage in the pocket of his discarded pants, he looks sweaty and flustered with a wet spot on the front of his boxers where he was about to go off like a champagne cork.
Tony hasn’t got enough strength left to look into the void that Steve used to occupy in his heart, not enough strength just to look and see how deep it really went, how much of
“You could have come to me, Steve,” Tony says the hostility dropping out of his voice so he sounds more exacerbated than angry, “we could have..
He mumbles and it’s half swallowed up. Steve steers Tony back to the bed until his knees hit the edge. He flops backward in a whirl of bedsheets smiling up through his lips red and kiss-bitten.
“I wouldn’t do that JARVIS-“ Natasha protests, but it’s too late the AI opens the file flooding the monitors with classified information, there’s photo’s, names, embedded videos, notes, and one big glaring inconsistency.
Steve sighs, “I’ve never been much of a liar,” he goes to put his hands in his pockets and suddenly remember he’s standing in his shorts, “I really should…” He trails off.
I’ve had enough enemies crawl out the woodwork. And now you’re sending me to bed?” He points accusingly at Steve,
He calls to Steve with a yawn, “You know Steve, you can stay the night if you want.” He’s still relishing in the post-sex afterglow, sinking back into the pillows and sliding under the covers, the 800 thread count cotton glides across oversensitive skin making him sigh and settle deeper into the mattress.
Tony’s out of breath by the time he hammers on Steve bedroom door, half exerted half nervously-excited.
Tears stream down Tony’s cheeks and he shakes and shakes with his breathing all wrong, Steve feels like crying, the wild desperate look doesn’t belong on Tony’s face. He never meant for this, seeing him like this, there’s a niggling voice at the back of his head that says:
and wraps his legs around Steve's waist, lets him hold him up with hands hooked under his ass. Steve doesn’t have to stoop to kiss him like this and Tony’s arms drape around his neck like they’ve been doing this forever.
Steve’s eyes go comically large at the realisation. “I’m never going to be able to look at you when you’re fighting in the same way again.” He shakes his head burying it in the juncture of Tony’s neck, laying claim to his bare flesh.
even when he’s miles away he knows when Steve at his breaking point when he needs a night like this just the two of them,
She said snorting dirty laughter. “When I ran from SHIELD life wasn’t about living anymore. It was about
“Umm, everything alright Cap?” Tony asks because he thinks he should. His chest starts to go tight when Steve doesn’t answer. It’s to do with
“Who is it?” He asks quietly, not looking up from where he’s fixed his eyes to his feet. Natasha has no doubt he’s processing his Tony guilt at being the latest cause of his distress.
He can handle the pity, smile that forced grin, toss his head back and pretend that it wasn’t killing him inside, and at least… At least they don’t know, they all think it was a friendship that’s been ruined, no more of the Tony and Steve show; begrudgingly making each other coffee and disagreeing on the minor details just to see the other get angry, but always managing to pull it together at the last second and make it look flawless, because they were friends really. That's what they all said right?
He catches Tony’s wrist and holds him still, “I can’t… ’s too…” He bites his lip when fingertips brush bare skin, little bursts of heat rippling out from their epicenter making him shudder.
“I think we’ve found your energy pull Tony.” The detail of Steve’s face that’s exposed looks decidedly pale. Tony nods in response.
that wipes out the entire weapons supply of a suspected terrorist group over the Pacific?” Steve’s jaw is set, he’s wearing his best ‘Captain America is going to get some answers face’ and Tony shifts uncomfortably underneath it, testing the grip around his wrist once more before he sighs and goes limp.
The driver flashes a thumbs up out the window as he departs leaving Natasha and Sam standing outside a garish Mexican grocery store. They’re close enough to the railway tracks that when a loaded freight train rattles past it shakes the ground under their feet.
There’s no hesitation when Steve drags Tony half way down the bed and pulls him into position, he ends up with Steve slotted in between his thighs with his hands under his ass lifting him ever so slightly, fingertips just brushing the small of his back. He feels so open,
I could have worked something out.” Tony folds his arms in front of his chest squaring up to Steve, making the considerably taller man shrink back.
“It’s the holidays. I’m not even sure Nick Fury’s in the country right now. I mean, even we’re on a skeleton crew.” He gestures between himself and Steve before pausing. “Wait,
He swears he’s numb to everything except the throbbing in his pants and the glide of skin underneath his fingertips.
It took him months to get used to after the serum, he’d spent his entire life up until that point being half-deaf and suddenly it was like somebody had switched the volume up too loud,
has enough to worry about if we’re going to be invaded by aliens every five minutes, and enabling terrorists isn’t how I want Stark Industries thought of.”
Usually, he’d pace around the tower, down a glass of water and they were done, he could get back to sleep ready for the next one.
Steve, who was lugging his considerable amount of wood back to the bed, who makes a show of squeezing lube onto his deft artist fingers because he knows his audience is captivated. Steve who lets the bottle deliberately drip on Tony’s stomach then tracks slick digits through it and watches his whole body prickle with goosebumps.
you need to know.” Natasha pauses in the middle of a flight of stairs four floors to go before the top. “She’s not… that’s to say… She’s,” Natasha always struggled with the right words on how to describe Ilona, “She’s not
“I thought I heard you in here, really going for it huh?” Natasha nods to him from the doorway, smoothing down the folds of her outfit and snapping her purse shut.
He was more than Steve thought he deserved, they’d been in each other company a little under twenty minutes and he was already fixing all things Steve didn’t even know were ailing him.
aka James Barnes,” she hesitates before continuing, not meeting Tony’s eyes, “and an old SHIELD personnel file belonging to one ‘Miss Ilona Warner’,”
He picks his moment to pull away - when Steve’s breathing become a staccato rhythm and he’s struggling to speak. Tony’s timing is always impeccable and he’s left Steve with a throbbing erection, slick with his saliva that’s no longer cradled in the warmth of his throat, but instead exposed to the ever-so-slight-barely-noticeable-if-you-weren’t-naked-and-horny breeze in the bedroom. “
He stands hot and bothered, confused and lost because he wanted to speak to Tony again, he wanted another two minutes to explain himself…
Bruce was easy, when he wasn’t big, mean and green he seemed to suffer from every allergy under the sun and had a habit of sniveling. Natasha was difficult, she had light footsteps to the point where she had managed to make Steve jump on occasions. Then there was Tony, and Steve hated to admit it, but Tony’s sure stride always made his nerves jump and his stomach bottom out, Steve knew that Tony had a habit of whistling or muttering to himself depending on his mood and he had a guilty habit of his own listening for him a little more often than the others.
old friend,” she says thinking of the best way to give the least information about her ex-colleague, “There is,
“There’s no getting one around you.” She said shaking her head like a disapproving mother and stepping close enough to slip an arm through her companion’s joining them at the elbow, “come on, it’s this way, we’ll walk and talk.” Natasha felt the initial resistance of the person on her arm give as she fell into step next to her.
He waits, not ready to give up the amount of skin contact, he rubs his cheek on the inside of Tony’s thighs that flinch oversensitive to touch. They stay that way until he feels the tension drop out of Tony’s body.
“OK, I deserve that.” He says hands on hips, “drink your water Tony.” Steve watches as Tony’s hand carefully takes the glass and brings it to his mouth.
“What are you up to Stark?” He breathes through the darkness and traded air desperate for the second-hand taste of champagne from Tony on his lips again.
A steak of shadow, misty, formless and barely human in shape moving with purpose across the marble. It makes his skin go clammy and he trades a glance with Steve whose eyes have gone hard.
. It’s takin’ a bit ’a extra juice to keep him locked up.” He turns back to Tony and Steve who couldn’t look
He carries him to the bed like it, sets him down on the edge and lets him watch as he strips his uniform.
Steve, I’m not sleeping in them as well.” He mumbles into Steve’s neck dipping his head to suck at the hollow above his collarbone. Steve’s breath hitches as he lets his eyes flutter closed. “
“Don’t worry Cap,” Tony stands, clapping Steve on his back as the cliché tumbles out of his mouth before he can stop it. “There’s plenty more fish in the sea.” He feels shoulders stiffen under his hand.
He’s in the smart lighting, the glass balcony over the quinjet bay, the automatic doors and the ostentatious coffee machine.
“Do you have any idea what I have been going through the last few days?” Tony pauses, not long enough for Steve to respond, “I’ll answer for you shall I?
he says, something mischievous glittering in his eyes which flit over Steve as he strategically adjusts his jacket to cover his crotch, he’s pitching a tent so big it feels like it could provide shelter for
gets drawn into the present, he’s not thinking what should happen next, the only thing that meant anything
His lip curls back on his teeth when he speaks. “And you made it pretty clear who was important to you and who was-” he pauses, and Steve knows, he’s looking for the words that are going to cut the deepest. It’s fine Steve can take it,
He sighs somewhere between amusement and affection as he follows the trail of clothing like it’s rose petals leading him to his lover, shedding his own gear as he goes and laying it neatly over his arm in true military style before tossing it onto an armchair.
Tony says almost as breathless as he is, pushing him back with the flat of his palm, fumbling with his pants like he can’t remember how an elastic waistband works, Steve can’t stand it, can’t control himself and paws at the fabric until they end up pooled at Tony’s feet.
She felt her companions step falter, saw the flinch of her hand out the corner of her eye as it shot up to paw at her neck subconsciously.
“Don’t. Don’t look at me like that,” Tony says shakily getting down from the bench, slowly retrieving his clothes, his voice a rasp.
He pulls Tony against him by his open collar, fumbling blindly with the fragile buttons his attention not in his hands because Tony could kiss filthy, running the tip of his tongue along Steve’s top lip before pushing it passed his teeth tasting sticky and sweet; every calculated lap in his mouth and low vibrating groan pulsing and curling in his stomach, making his cock bounce and throb in anticipation against the rough denim of Tony’s jeans.
him to notice. It sends Tony’s mind straight to the gutter because he knows the way those thin pieces of metal just brush his ass and the inside of his thighs when he’s lying back and being sucked off, the way they heat up and stick to Steve’s chest when he’s sweaty and about to come with Tony pounding into him, the way they rest in between his shoulders when Steve’s behind and kissing along his hairline fucking him on the nearest available surface when they’ve not seen each other for days or when Tony’s in his lap legs wrapped around him anchoring his hand in the chain and pulling at it, making it bite into the back of Steve’s neck when he’s all kisses and tender words bucking them both to ecstasy.
. When Steve pushes in with his smooth crown, Tony pushes right back until he’s full of nothing but Steve.
The tower was no stranger to night time wanderers. So, it wasn’t surprising when Steve saw the faint glow of the kitchen light on from underneath the door.
turned to puddles of wax light the bed and nothing else and Steve feels like they’re the only two people in the world…
The animal in Steve that had been hovering just below the surface doesn’t just stir this time, it roars up, stops him from even looking for that one good reason to say ‘no’ and walk back out, instead, he utters the word
Tony’s circulating like the socialite he is; Steve’s not seen him short of company once tonight, not that he’s jealous, he’s had a crowd of people buzzing around him all evening at this ridiculous SHIELD Gala they’ve all been dragged to. It just makes it hard to keep tabs on how many times he’s seen Tony snag a glass of champagne from the passing waiters, not that it’s his business how much he does or doesn’t drink, more of keeping an eye on Tony was a tough habit to break, even more so now that the lines of friendship were being crossed–enthusiastically, energetically and…
“I panicked Tony,” Steve puts the bottle down on the desk and starts wringing his hands instead, because
it wasn’t Hydra,” He tries to push something into Tony direction who puts his hands up and takes a step back.
. Tony scoots back, glad of the cover of darkness, he’s sure he’s blushed the same color as the latest paint job on the Iron Man suit.
he could have seen the look on Tony’s face when he did it, he hears the noise- the shocked yelp that comes from above; the clatter of the screwdriver Tony knocks off the bench when it hits the floor by his knees. He feels Tony involuntarily jerk his leg out in surprise and catch him in the ribs with his foot.
It meant that he tuned into most sounds background or otherwise without realizing; it also meant that Steve could recognize the people he spent a lot of time with by their footfall or certain noises they made out of habit.
Tony says abruptly dropping his tablet with a thwack. He looks down once then fixes Steve with an ice-cold glare.
Four feet that might as well have been four hundred. He makes some non-commital shrug with his shoulders and stares off at a neutral spot over and above Steve’s shoulder.
of possessive. “JARVIS?” Tony cracks an eye at Steve addressing the AI. “Remind Tony to do laundry tomorrow.” He chuckles and gets a swift elbow to the ribs from his little spoon. Steve tightens his grip, but Tony manages to twist around to face him.
Tony replied as the door slammed shut between them; locking Steve out. Leaving him standing with his face inches from the metal, he balled a fist and pulled back an elbow with half a mind to slam it straight into the door peeling it open like the lid of a sardine can. It’s the thought that he might get shot with one of Tony’s repulsors that stopped him short; he knows how jumpy he’d been since New York, and it’s not like Steve even knew what he would say to him.
Steve said in a shout-whispered for the sake of those who were sleeping instead of keeping an all-night vigil on the scanners.
He rests his hands at his sides digging his fingertips into the screwed up blankets and wills his body to stop throbbing,
is ever going to compare to the first time he kissed Tony Stark. The way he goes ridged then melts against his chest, gauntleted hands that slide around his waist and pull their hips together. The slight smile he feels curl on the edges of Tony’s mouth before he lets him in. The way their teeth catch because neither can get close enough.
him in weeks. They spoke often enough, brief phone calls between meetings when privacy was at a premium that neither could afford; and there had been texting,
tight, he spreads his fingers out across each globe of his ass pushing his cock up against the tight ring of muscle until he feels the resistance give.
Tony seethes, sieving his next words through a set of clenched teeth, “Well now Natasha, your friend doesn't appear to be living up to her current status of
undressed Tony in his head, popping buttons off his shirt, feeling the delicious give of his skin under his fingers and hearing him moan-
“Umm… If you want it to?” Steve takes a cautious step back, worried he’ll do something that’s going to set Tony off laughing again.
Steve stands and the lights flicker back to life as he blinks down. Tony holds his hand up. “Help me up? My ass has gone numb.” Steve thinks he almost sees a smile as he hauls him to his feet.
there’s more redactions in it than something out of Area 51. Half of it doesn’t make sense.” There’s more shuffling, more papers get moved. “I
He starts to lose his rhythm, kisses are forgotten and he drags Tony in against his chest, clawing at his back trying and failing to stop himself coming. He buries his face into the juncture of Tony’s neck, and muffles the noise that accompanies the rush of heat through his entire body and the sudden, urgent release of pressure that makes his ears ring and his vision swim, he chases the feeling and thrusts until he’s got nothing left to give.
“I’m leaving.” He finally chokes, the effort to hold his voice from cracking making the back of his throat ache and leaving a metallic twang in his mouth.
“Like what?” Steve’s throat feels sticky when he talks, he’s already committing the taste of Tony to memory.
“No lift,” Sam observes as they both politely play the ‘let’s ignore the smell of piss in the stairwell’ game whilst they ascend.
His stomach growls in protest when he foregoes breakfast and heads straight for the gym to take out the leftover frustration on Tony’s ‘Super Soldier Resistant Punching Bag’ and if he destroys the damn thing in the process,
“Bucky’s file?” Steve deflates like he’s been punched in the gut, “That’s what was taken?” Natasha nods when he looks up eyes wide in disbelief, “Why couldn’t you just have
Sam responds; Natasha sees him out the corner of her eye giving the dog bed and Ilona a wide berth. Natasha was used to it, Ilona’s presence always had a way of making people uneasy, like the air fidgeted around her, even more so when her emotions were heightened.
“So,” She finally sighs, “what’s the deal with you, Stark got under your skin?” She asks with a sly knowing smile creeping on her lips. “If you want, yesterdays’ paper is in the trash. I could tear his picture out and stick it on there for you?” She gestures to the bag.
Tony likes to kiss when he comes, he’d bristle and deny it if Steve every brought it up. He drags Steve in by his collar with his spare hand. Bashes their teeth together, licks and sucks and moans at his bottom lip while his hips jerk forward, making a hot sticky mess between them.
has more to do with Tony laughing and looking so relaxed whilst telling him how Happy had managed to stain the couch with nacho cheese and tried to blame it on the dog before he remember Tony didn’t have one.
He’d found Clint snoring on the sofa in the common room once, had a conversation with Thor and discovered he struggled with the time difference between Midgard and Asgard. He’d even caught Natasha on the phone, deep in a hushed conversation that she had abruptly ended upon his intrusion and excused herself.
He wraps Tony in his arm, enveloping him in a stacked tricep; the flat of his hand running down the swoop of his back and resting just above the curve of his ass. “You’re naked.” He manages as Tony shifts and kisses along Steve’s jawline, at his pulse points, down his throat, all while he still toys with the dog tags, running up the chain and sliding fingers underneath it, tangling his hands in then tugging.
like accountants.” Her companion rolled her eyes and shook her head, “I knew you didn’t call me here just to look at an empty grave.” Natasha could hear the resignation of laughter in her voice as she pressed her fingers to the bridge of her nose.
trick again, he pulls his fingers out instead and Tony wants to protest, call him a tease, tell him not to start something he can’t finish. His eyes fly open and he’s met by the sight of Steve sat back on his heels, sucking in raw uneven breaths. He watches as the air catches in Steve’s throat and he flinches at his own hand running the length of his cock coating it in lube until it's glistening and letting out some guttural growl. He looks so hard that he might keel over from it, apparently, he’s been getting off to Tony getting off.
A gently pull at his hair has him perking up, “No falling asleep, come on your champagne is getting warm,”
A shadowy-friend-of-Natasha’s someone else who’d managed to gouge and claw their way into several highly classified storage cabinets, leaving behind nothing but broken locks and blur on a CCTV camera.
Tony takes his own unsteady weight, looking like Bambi on ice as he tries to coax life back into his numb lower half. He staggers once, falters a step on legs that won’t obey and ends up fetching up against Steve and shoving him back against the counter, digging it into the small of his back.
With all his blood rushing South Tony’s lost all high brain function, along with any coherent vocabulary, all he can manage is rasping moans of encouragement.
“All you care about is James Barnes,” Tony says sieving his resentment through gritted teeth, “You care about him so much that you’ll go behind my back-” he turns, squaring up the Steve  “-you’ll hire
I had to call in a favor to get you your precious file.” Her voice drops to a harsh whisper, her eyes continually darting down the empty corridor and then back to Steve because she was acutely aware that Tony had been,
still remember how to talk, Steve didn’t fuck that out of him after all. He returns the gaze and stretches his arms above his head suddenly remembering the state he’s in.
Tony had a cowlick in his hair when they started, now it’s well and truly fucked, a stray curl stuck to the sweat that’s on his forehead, he looks overheated, oversensitive with his cheeks flushed pink whilst he eases them apart and does a vague attempt at a clean-up. “The cars out the front.” He says quietly, not looking up. Steve can hear the shaking of his breath as he pulls his clothes back on. “Come home with me?” Something in Steve's chest jumps, an ember he keeps burning for Tony suddenly stoked to a fire because, in that one simple request, which might be nothing but might be something, Tony gives him hope- it’s not love. Not even close, but it has potential and Steve can work with that. He watches Tony sway a little as he buttons his pants looking down in concentration, it warms him to his core that tomorrow, for the first time he’s going to wake up next to this man.
“So," Ilona asks expectantly, "what do you think of the place?” she gestures wide with arms and splays her hands.
“It was, you know-New Years’ kiss? A bit of fun.” Tony’s mouth has never been so dry in all his life. He
“Is that a promise?” Tony smirks because humour and sarcasm are his go-to. Need to get out of an awkward conversation? Need to end an argument?
Without warning, Steve shot up so fast his chair flew a couple feet behind him, and he slammed his metal fist into the table, causing an immediate dent. The room was quiet, as five superheroes looked at him with concern. Steve was breathing heavy, with his veins attempting to break through his skin, and a wild look in his eye.
And because of that, the soldier wouldn't deny he was scared. As Tony wrapped himself more securely around Steve’s waist, he was so, so scared.
Just so people realize, Steve is acting the way he's acting for a reason. I didn't make him jealous just for the sake of conflict, he's acting this way for a reason that will come to be explained. Sorry it's so short the next chapter will be longer.
So i wasnt originally going to change Fury’s title bcim lazy but after being told Lt was lower than Captain im changing it to Major, if thats the correct term pls leave a comment just so i know im not a total idiot
He didn’t have time to question it when another voice, this one shrill yet much more terrifying, echoed from the set of stairs as the clicking of heels filled the room.
Thank you all for reading! I can't say I know when the next ch is going to come out but know that I never abandon fics (also more editing will come to this entire series after all the ch's are out)
It was only a thought but it was enough to send Steve reeling as he shot up in bed, hunching into himself as that ugly green emotion soared through his veins. He could picture it in his head, and as much as he didn’t want to, it was like someone else had taken control. The images playing like a news real in his mind. Tony with his head thrown back in pleasure as the other Steve took him apart in a way only Steve had been able to up until now. Tony’s cheeks would flush as his eyes were heavily lidded with pleasure before he would open his mouth in a silent scream as he came, and a man with two real arms caressed his skin to help him through it.
Tony was looking up at him, his warm, chocolate eyes boring into Steve’s. They were filled with, what the soldier could only describe accurately as, life.
the song for this ch is All Too Well by Taylor Swift :) i've been a sucker for this song since it came out when i was like thirteen
I know this seems like alot of stucky but its not i just love their friendship and think its important not to minimalize buckys relationship with steve when it obviously means alot to both of them...though stony is forever otp sorry about it
Even though I have multiple chapters done updates might be a bit sparse because life is getting in the way so sorry for the wait, hope you enjoy
But, when Steve finally lay eyes on the monster of a man he had envisioned in his head he was...slightly disappointed.
This was so short and i had finished with it so early that it would have been a waste to wait so here take my meek offering
At first, what had happened to cause such a reaction was unclear. At least, until her eyes wandered to the body on the ground.
A couple weeks ago Steve had finally gotten the genius to open up about his family life. The super soldier wouldn't deny the bought of rage that swept through him whenever he remembered the tears in Mr. Stark’s eyes as he spoke of things that had haunted him for so long. Was Howard Stark really that much of a dick that he refused to use his son’s first name? Or declined to give the child one at all?
This isnt the most edited chapter and i plan on going through a bunch of the later chapters and editing them more soon just bare with me
Sometimes, if Steve had had a bad day and Winter Soldier memories were plaguing him, his self doubt would eat away at him. What if the relationship between himself and Mr. Stark wasn’t as close as Steve thought? What if Mr. Stark didn’t even really like him and was only being kind and amazing and wonderful as a service to Bucky? Maybe Mr. Stark didn’t like him so much, that he wouldn’t even tell Steve his name? Those nights rest was always hard to find.
He didn’t belong here. He didn’t belong in the close knit group of friends Bucky had found for himself. He was an intruder in this place and it was glaringly obvious. Steve wanted to leave but to do that he had to find the exit, which brought him back to his original problem.
“Mr. Stark, that’s what you call him right, Steve? Steve Rogers and Mr. Stark the duo that gets themselves blown up without a regard for other people. If either of you had died, do you know what that would have done to me? The two of you are my best friends...I-I...”
“Damn, Stark,” a voice awoke Steve from the serenity of uncounsiness. He didn’t want to wake up, but the mutterings of his best friend at his side meant he couldn’t stay under much longer. Still, Steve kept his eyes closed, not yet ready to face the world.

The genius was drowning in fear and uncertainty, and Steve couldn’t allow his lover to go through that. Not when he had the ability to stop it.
Tony, who had watched him in a sort of daze, turned around and blasted away his current enemy. When he was certain his opponent wasn’t getting up any time soon, he quickly flew over to the new arrival.
Clint glared at the man, “Way to ruin my fun Bruce,” the blond said, but there was a red flush crawling up his neck that let Steve know he was done with the teasing. Not that it made the super soldier feel any better.
