Castiel set down his tea carefully then stood and moved toward Dean. He didn’t appear to rush, but one moment he was at the table and the next he stood close to Dean, too close.
Castiel flicked his eyes to the magistrate standing next to the young man. “Take off his cuffs, please.”
He sneaked a look at Castiel again and was ensnared by his eyes, again. Something had definitely changed. “What’s going on?” Dean demanded. He knew he didn’t have any way to force them to answer, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t going to ask.
“I…I’m attracted to Castiel.” Dean stopped, his heart banging, unable to force out one more word. He didn’t think Sam would react badly, but this was so…close to the center of his identity – something he’d never let anyone get near before – it was scary in a way no monster ever had been or ever would be.
Dean was getting overwhelmed with all of it - the sensation of Castiel in his mouth and under him, firm and hot, the sensation of Gabriel slamming into him, laying over him, and the curl and buzz in his head and his belly and his cock as Castiel called him a bitch with approval and delight. One small part of him was telling him that was bad and wrong - he shouldn’t let Cas talk to him that way, he shouldn’t feel pleasure at it, he shouldn’t…there were so many things he shouldn’t feel or do. But the biggest part of him was just feeling it all, and it felt so good he wasn’t able to process it all. He coughed a little when Cas came, spilling his hot come down his chin, and Cas met his eyes, as he lifted them, and a couple blunt masculine fingers gently swiped up the come and guided it back into Dean’s mouth. Dean opened up for it and closed his mouth around the fingers, gently sucking instinctively.
He saw the smirk was still there, maybe even a little bigger. Hot anger welled up behind his eyes, but Castiel fought it back down. He had no time for that right now. His anger would be appeased soon enough. His right hand whipped out to slap the young man’s cheek, staggering him and leaving a white imprint that slowly flushed red in reaction. The boy pulled himself back upright, then flicked out a punch that thudded into Castiel’s midsection, then another that crashed into his cheek, then two more quick blows to his body.
Now Castiel was a different thing entirely. If Gabriel was strength, power, and humor, Castiel was strength, dominance, and…lightning. Dean huffed a silent laugh. That didn’t quite work, but it kinda captured how he felt about the angel. He hasn’t seen much of him since the incident at the jail, but just the sight of him briefly around the house made him think of what it would be like the next time he fucked him. And if he was honest with himself (which he didn’t want to be, but suck it up, Dean), he knew he wanted it to happen again. He wanted to feel Castiel’s weight on top of him, holding him down, holding him steady. He wanted to feel Castiel’s hands, big and strong, gripping him tight. He wanted to feel Castiel’s breath, warm and soft, next to his ear. He wanted to feel Castiel’s cock, hot and hard, pushing into him, filling his empty spaces, taking him for his own like he did once before.
“Yeah, yeah. Okay. No touching the pretty human, got it.” Luke rolled his eyes and headed toward his own rooms.
The magistrate gave the young man one last vaguely sympathetic glance, nodded, and walked away. It was a shame to see a strong young man turned into a bitch by an angel, but Castiel Novak had the right. It was done. The boy had been legally bitched.
Today the Novaks had been called to a meeting with their brother Raphael, out in the angel quarter. They were going to drop Joshua back at his own house for the duration, but he had wanted to stay with Dean and had won the ensuing argument, surprising Dean. He wondered at their confidence in him, but it also gave him a warm feeling.
A minute of watching failed to show any movement, and Charlie’s stomach dropped sickeningly as she pulled up the other images in succession and didn’t see anything of note, but. But. She swiveled to another monitor and pulled up the historical feed, starting a couple of hours ago. She saw the Novaks leave and the man and the boy start to play cards, then nothing happened. Literally. The feed was frozen. She swallowed, heart pounding, and hit the buttons to make the call to Castiel.
His eyes met Dean’s yet again, sharp and focused this time. Dean saw him swallow and inhale deeply. “Your soul is…the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, Dean. It is…wonderful and…unmarred.” Dean could see that Castiel was picking his words very carefully.
The memory of Castiel’s strength and power, his…dominance (thank you for that, Gabriel, he thought acerbically) …as he maneuvered Dean where he wanted him and then pushed into him and took him, fucked into him, grunted and came inside him…even in memory, it did something to Dean. Something weird that warmed his belly and gave him a hollow, shivery feeling in his gut. Castiel wasn’t an especially big or powerful man at first sight, but it was there. And his voice – deep and gravelly, yeah, it did things to Dean as well.
Dean looked at Castiel, really looked at him. He had stopped very close to Dean, maybe a foot away. He would be uncomfortable if it was anyone other than Castiel. He was wearing the dark suit and tie that had stopped Dean in his tracks the first time he saw him in it. His hair was in its’ normal, tousled state. His face tried to hold onto its’ usual impassivity, but Dean could see the uncertainty, even if no one else would be able to. The angel stood there, looking back at him steadily, hopefully. He wasn’t trying to force Dean into anything. Normally so sure and commanding, now he waited for Dean to make his choice.
“Hey, Sam. I’m okay. Still with the angels. They’re letting me call.” Dean rubbed his hand against his jeans-clad thigh nervously. This was the easy part. It would only get more difficult from here on.
“And you’re really okay? I mean, that sounds like….” Dean could actually hear his little brother swallow.
Joshua wasn’t fooled. As the youngest of their siblings, he was secure in the love and protection of all of his brothers. “Amnayel said I could come for a few days. I’m all caught up, and I deserve a break, she said! It’s been weeks since I’ve seen you!”
“I’ve told you three times, Dad! It never changes!” Sam protested. He swallowed. His mind kept replaying the scene earlier that day – watching Dean…. He didn’t even know how to finish that thought. How to process it all.
Then this train wreck happened. Once he settled into the house with Castiel and Gabriel, he’d…enjoyed himself. The angels were interesting. The sex was good…and he could see “great” coming up on the horizon. Taking care of them and the house made him feel useful for the time being, although he knew it wouldn’t satisfy him forever. He’d want to get out hunting again. Would they let him work with them? Would they respect him? What the hell was that “marked as your bitch, now and forever” bit? What did that mean? How would they treat him, inside and outside the house? Would it be different? How would the other Novak brothers treat him? And he could he accept it, whatever the answers to those questions were?
Castiel shook his head. “No, thank you, Magistrate. I will finish up here, and then we’ll take him home.”
Castiel answered, “They were part of a small anti-supernatural group. They heard about you and thought they could gain recognition by freeing you. They were watching the house and when they saw Joshua, they shifted their goal – they wanted to grab him and hold him for ransom as well as take you. But they didn’t take into account you weren’t like them. You wouldn’t allow a child of any kind to be hurt.”
Their arms eventually got tired, and quiet, reasonable, sneaky Curly came up with the idea to start using a belt. Moe grabbed a knife and cut the shirt off Dean, pulling the scraps from his hanging body. The bruises and then cuts bloomed across Dean’s body as the belt continued to fall with a crack, over and over. Dean was still conscious, barely, and he saw them start to get more and more anxious. They knew this was taking too much time.
Dean listened as John explained about the digging he’d been doing and detailed all the recent hunter deaths and disappearances. It was disturbing as all hell. There was no way to know at this point if his situation was connected to everything else, but it was certainly something to bear in mind.
“Ah, yes, Winchester. Well, that was a bit of an error there, wasn’t it? The boy and the werewolf should have both died that night, then you wouldn’t have learned anything you didn’t want to know, and I wouldn’t be having to explain all this to you.”
Gabriel frowned and cocked his head at Castiel’s declaration and request. It was unusual, but – she must have found something- something really interesting. He couldn’t imagine what about Dean’s situation would require all of them to be present, but he guessed he was about to find out. He called his brothers then flopped back on the couch, claiming pride of place to wait for the expected entertainment to unfold.
“It’s a natural quality that he has, - the drive to lead, to command, to protect what is his. He is…well, he’s the most dominant angel of our generation at the very least. He is also…curious, and…open. He talks to and makes friends with other supernaturals much more than any other angel. These two qualities together have…sparked the situation we find ourselves in.”
The hard choice would require him to try to explain why to his dad. He wouldn’t get it, Dean knew that. Sam – he wasn’t sure what Sam would think. He was a pretty smart kid, and he knew Dean in a way that his dad didn’t, couldn’t. He might understand. Even worse, the hard choice would make him admit to himself what he wanted, what…fulfilled him…in a way nothing else ever had. But it would give him Cas. The hard choice would give him Cas, and an interesting, fun life with the angel he loved.
“Anyway, this whole thing has been…really weird…but some of it…it’s....” Dean floundered a bit. He didn’t know how to explain it so Sam could understand, because he didn’t really understand it himself.
“I’m going to spank you, Dean. I think we all are going to enjoy this. Don’t worry, thought, if you don’t enjoy it, we will stop. Tonight is about us reconnecting and your pleasure.”
Gabriel shook his head, giving Luke a chiding look. “You know that’s not how it works, brother. He owes his service to me and Castiel, not to any of you.” He was speaking to them both, Dean knew, and the knot in his belly slowly relaxed a little.
“Yes, sir. I will.” Dean said goodbye and hung up, then sat there holding the phone for a few moments. It had been so good to talk to his dad, but also a bit disorienting, like two separate worlds were colliding. The new information didn’t help, either. He shook his head abruptly and put all that aside. Time to call Sam and make sure he was okay and not getting into more trouble than he could handle.
Castiel ran his hand across Dean’s buttocks, gently caressing him. Gabriel settled on the bed near them, his hand reaching out to stroke Dean’s warm skin, reassuring him.
Dean let out a surprised laugh, “Yeah, no. This guy – he…. No, he’s not lying.” Dean blinked, nonplussed, because as cynical as he was, that thought had never even crossed his mind. And he didn’t have to think about it now, either.
He looked away from Castiel for a moment, then back. “Well, Castiel, are you ready for the next job I have lined up for Novak Brothers?”
He used his fingers to gently fuck Dean, feeling for the right spot. A sudden stiffening accompanied by a surprised grunt showed him when he found it. He smiled. Gabriel wanted Dean to enjoy this as much as he possibly could, because he intended to spend as much time as he could with his cock firmly lodged inside Dean’s ass.
Gabriel spun the boy around in a circle, both of them laughing, then set him gently down, and they both turned to face Dean. “I didn’t know you were coming, Joshua. Dean, this is our youngest brother, Joshua. He is not yet a part of our company, and I thought you were studying!” Gabriel finished by speaking to the boy, squinting his eyes in an attempt to be stern.
“I’m gonna be blunt here, Castiel, because we all know you don’t get subtle in personal interactions. Explain to Dean what you thought, what you found out, what you feel, and what you want. Go.” He sat back, leg still kicking idly, gazing at Dean.
Gabriel laughed at the look of frustrated bafflement on Dean’s face. “During the trial, Castiel wanted nothing more than to see you punished for killing his friend – a righteous punishment for an evil act. And then, when we saw you at the jail – you were so cocky, Dean, with that maddening little smirk of yours – Castiel gave in to his instincts. He proved his dominance over you, and that gave him the biggest kick, I can’t even tell you. I know, because I felt it, too, of course, when I mounted and fucked you.” Gabriel gave him a sly but good-humored grin.
Dean had told the angel he remembered what was going on, which he did, but that didn’t mean he understood it. He licked his dry lips, then croaked out, “Why…?”
“But it’s okay, I mean, he doesn’t need…. I don’t need….” Dean bit his lip. He abandoned that thought.
Castiel’s personal shield shuddered but held, and he struck back with the force of all his anger and horror at what his brother had done. It was over in a split second, and Raphael was gone. Castiel slowly straightened up and stood tall. He took a deep breath and deliberately let it out, letting his tumultuous feelings settle and his adrenaline subside. He took a few moments to just breathe. His brother had murdered humans. His brother had murdered his friend Silas. His brother had tried to kill him. All that was true, yet he still remembered their many years together as family, and mourned.
Halfway through the trial, it had become clear that the prosecutor could not prove his theory, and the defense could not prove hers. The jury had compromised with a ruling of manslaughter, declaring that Winchester had caused Silas’s death, but in the heat of the moment rather than the result of a malicious plan.
Dean had forgotten all self-consciousness as he watched Gabriel and tried to understand. He wasn’t sure if any of this was truly helpful in understanding what was going on with him and…well, with his situation, but any knowledge was better than none.
Castiel and Gabriel sat facing each other over the kitchen table, mugs of tea in their hands. As one, they stopped talking and turned to look at him even though he knew he hadn’t made a sound.
Dean flushed and his ears started ringing as he heard Castiel tell everyone within earshot what he’d done to him.
As both of their hearts and breathing settled back down, Gabriel eyed the turbulent swirls of Dean’s energy, and thought he should try to smooth it out just a little bit. Not with his magic – no, that wouldn’t be a good idea at all at this point. Dean was settling into life at the Novak household pretty well. He had their schedules down and was keeping up with his chores, with no issues or rebellion.  He also submitted to Gabriel’s cock every day – but that was not so easy for him. Perhaps just a little nudge here would help.
“So that’s one…point…for you to think about. It does relate to what you said about angels not having a sexual preference – if you look at the 95%/5% split, you can see that the physical form does not have as great an impact on us as the spiritual form. So yes, we do not generally have a physical sexual preference.”
He lay naked, face down on a thin mattress on the floor of a small, bare room. It looked like a normal bedroom, only empty of any furnishings save the mattress he lay on and a small dresser over in the corner. Slowly he registered the two masculine voices, raised slightly in argument, mainly because they stopped abruptly just as soon as he turned his head toward their sources.
“Hello?” Sam’s voice was quizzical. It was hit or miss whether any of the Winchesters would answer an unknown phone number, but Sam’s curiosity must have won out in the end. Dean guessed he was glad. No, he *was* glad. He wanted to talk to Sammy, needed to. It was just going to be hard, navigating the tricky figurative land mines.
Castiel Novak nodded in response to his older brother, his cool blue eyes clear and determined. On one hand he wasn’t looking forward to what was about to happen, yet on the other hand, he had been waiting for this for days…weeks even. Revenge – no, that was not what this was. Revenge was petty and beneath him. This was justice, and it had to be done.
Cas’ whole body relaxed, and a wide smile broke free, full of relief and joy and love. It was miraculous, and it spread warmth and delight throughout Dean, who kept smiling back at him. Suddenly, Cas’ wings manifested, arching huge and black over them both. Dean jumped, but then stared in awe. Cas’ wings spread wide, then slowly, gently came forward to fold around Dean, cocooning the two of them away from the rest of the world. Dean closed his eyes as he felt Cas’ arms pull him into his body, then encircle him with their strength and power, and one hand cupped the back of Dean’s head and guided it down to Cas’ firm chest, and he knew he was where he wanted to be forever.
“That’s not creepy at all, guys,” Dean commented, going for the snark as always when he was uncomfortable.
Castiel emerged from his office finally and went into the kitchen. “Dean, would you like a beer?” he called out. “Gabriel?”
“Come on, Brother. Seriously. The boy has a beautiful, hot, tight ass, and I know you want to get back in there.”
The magic washed over Dean, warm and fuzzy. Yeah, that didn’t make a whole lot of sense, but that’s what he felt. The Registrar was a tall, blond female angel with piercing gray eyes. She was solid and muscular, built like Dean imagined a bodybuilder or maybe blacksmith would be. Her fingertips were rough but her touch gentle as she laid her hand on his forehead. A minute later, the warmth slowly faded, and he opened eyes he hadn’t realized he’d closed.
“Dean! Oh my God, Dean! Are you okay? Where are you? How are you calling me?” Dean smiled into the phone at the rapid-fire questions in a voice that went from total shock to total relief and then back to land on a combination of stress and warmth.
Dean woke slowly, savoring the comfort of his bed and an overall warm feeling of total well-being. A niggle of concern tried to come to the forefront of his awareness, but he refused to pay attention to it right this moment. He allowed himself to drift for a few moments more before reluctantly kickstarting his brain. Slowly, his memory came back online, and he remembered. His whole body tensed involuntarily before he consciously relaxed, part by part. He breathed.
This difficult, terrible part was over, but sorting out this mess had not even begun. The fact that he had never had any clue that this was how his brother thought, that this was what his brother was capable of – he knew it would be a long time before he could begin to reconcile that. In the meantime, however, he needed to see that his word was upheld. He needed to take the evidence of Raphael’s actions to the court and get Dean’s conviction reversed. He needed to ensure Dean’s magical bonds to him and to Gabriel were severed. He needed to look at the details of what Raphael had done and attempt to make whatever amends might be possible to those left behind. And he needed to see if he could make amends with Dean. If Dean…if he was amenable to being courted by an angel…by him. He felt tired even thinking of everything he had to do – with the exception of Dean. Thinking of Dean, he felt many things, but tired was not one of them. Thinking of Dean, he felt regret for hurting him and an aching, terrible void in his chest for his misjudgment, something he knew he could not change. Nothing would change what he had done. He could only try to make it up to him, try to show him that he could be better, that he was worth a chance. And if Dean did give him a chance, he had to make sure he never had reason to regret it.
“Thank you, Registrar,” Castiel said. Watching Dean as the Registrar’s magic enveloped him, Castiel felt the first stirrings of uneasiness. Gabriel had roused the young man early, showed him his small bathroom and the large communal kitchen. Dean had balked at eating, but Gabriel ordered him to eat a small bowl of oatmeal, and Dean did as he was told. He had been quiet and subdued, his manner quite different from the bravado of the previous day.
Castiel was shaking his head before Gabriel finished the words. “You were there, Gabriel. You heard the prosecution. Whether or not they received a tip about a rogue werewolf, you know Silas wasn’t rogue. That means he killed Silas, he stabbed him with a silver knife, just because he was a werewolf.”
Castiel jerked his head toward the door, and the man blinked and followed the silent order, stepping just outside the cell, where he stopped to turn and watch along with Gabriel.
“Dean, Castiel is an extremely dominant angel. You might have wondered at the fact that he is the youngest of our adult siblings, yet he is the one who led us out of the angel community. He is the one who worked with another supernatural first – Silas. He is the one who established this business and brought us into it. He is the one who leads, Dean.”
Charlie checked the monitor again, saw nothing out of the ordinary, and she noted it down. Her boss Castiel had asked her to keep an eye on his house this morning while they were meeting with Raphael. It was weird, but then again, Charlie knew about Dean Winchester residing with him now. Hell, everyone knew about that. She wasn’t quite sure what to think about it all – should she be all ‘get ‘im, Boss’ or should she feel bad for the human in a tricky situation? So she tried not to think about it at all, really.
Dean watched the two together and couldn’t help but think of him and Sam. He missed his brother. He missed his familiar life. He missed his freedom. The sudden sense of loss washed over him, and he swallowed hard, trying to let it sweep over him and not push him under. He had no time for this, not here and now, anyway.
“Yeah, okay, Dean. Just – you can always come out to California, you know? If you don’t want to stay with Castiel or Dad, you can come out here. If you want, I’d like it, too, you know?”
Gabriel nodded at Castiel, and he wrapped his arms around Dean as gently as he could to support his weight while his brother took care of the binding. They lifted him and carried him over to the couch and laid him down.
“Go, go, go!” Dean motioned, moving aggressively toward the boy and following him as he got with the program and ran for the bathroom.
Dean swallowed. Bits and pieces of old school teachings and rumors had begun to come back to him. Angels didn’t generally mix much with humans. They kept to themselves or mingled lightly with the general supernatural community. A few stories he vaguely remembered that seemed to fit this situation talked about how angels didn’t really recognize biological sex or gender as something they considered when taking partners. It had resonated with Dean – at least until he had buried that crap deep and shoved a metaphorical rock over the top of that grave.
Castiel inhaled sharply as his cock abruptly filled at the thought. He imagined Dean on his knees in front of him, where he belonged, his beautiful lips wrapped around Castiel’s big hard cock, sucking gently. His hands tightened into fists, and he slowly breathed out. Gabriel was such an ass.
Uncle Bobby stood next to his father, grizzled and solid, his face unreadable as well, but Dean could see the stiffness of outrage in the way he held his body. Dean saw a few others he knew in passing, but the vast majority of the crowd were strangers, humans and magicals alike. Most watched with detached interest. Some of the humans wouldn’t meet his gaze, embarrassed for him. Some of the magicals watched with enjoyment; some few watched him with hot, evaluating gazes.
The beating…well, he’d taken a lot of damage over the years from various supernatural creatures who were trying to kill him, so that kind of pain was nothing new, nothing too scary. Facing an angel, Dean hadn’t been surprised at the strength and power Castiel had been able to bring to bear on him. He knew from the start he was about to get his ass kicked, he just wanted to make sure he got in a few licks of his own – make the angel feel it, even if just a little.  Feeling the angel come down on top of him and push his substantial cock into Dean’s asshole – well, he had a lot of weird crap twisted up in his mind about that. Sure, he’d thought about it over the years, wondered how it would feel – like, there was no way it wouldn’t hurt, right? But, and this was a huge “but” – just the thought of the solid weight of a man on top of him, the muscle and the bone of it, the strength…well, it had always done something to Dean. For Dean. Of course, he’d imagined it the other way around…mostly….
Gabriel cocked his head. “Castiel, that boy is not a murderer. You would know that if you just looked, but you don’t want to for some reason.”
Anger and pain simmered in him, and Castiel had finally thought of a way to begin to let it out. He would claim Winchester as Unrestricted Labor. As one of Silas’s heirs, along with Gabriel, they could claim him. And Castiel would find out the truth, and along the way, he would punish and teach the human in whatever ratio he had to, in order to make this pain fade.
Castiel and Gabriel flew to their house while Michael, Luke, and Ramiel raced to get there mundanely, in one of their SUVs. Flying was a huge drain of their energy, and it was a risk if they needed to use too much magic when they got there, but they couldn’t risk all of them arriving too late. Arriving at the house, they were violently rebuffed by an invisible shield. Gabriel took a breath and expanded his awareness. There was a flicker of energy nearby. There. He looked at Castiel then nodded across the street where they could just see the silhouette of a man in the passenger seat of an SUV.
During their talk, Dean had come up on his side to face Gabriel, propped up on one elbow so he could face him.  His hand reached out and gently pushed him so he was face down on the mattress again. Dean’s jaw clenched and he stiffened, but he didn’t resist.
“I…didn’t know, Dean. But – I mean, he was gone this whole summer, but I thought it was because you were healing up…?”
Dean’s head jerked, and he slowly picked it up off his chest. His eyelids flickered and a glimmer of green shown through. His mouth quirked up in a barely-there smile, and he muttered, “nick of time, Cas.”
Dean nodded, and Gabriel gave him a small nod of encouragement back. “There is one more category of Labor called Unrestricted Labor. It used to be common, but it has fallen into a bit of disfavor in the last, oh, hundred years or so.” Gabriel pursed his lips, looking off to the right as if trying to think of the right way to explain.
Castiel stilled in pure shock, horror, and disbelief at what his brother was saying…and at what he had done. How could he have missed this…? It was exactly what he had hated when he thought Dean had murdered Silas – hatred and contempt for those who were not like him.
She took a deep breath and her gaze flitted from one of the brothers to the next, skipping over Dean as she explained. “I got John to forward that tip email to me. I was able to trace the path back to…” she gulped. “…Novak Brothers.” She didn’t pause, not wanting to answer any of the resulting babble of questions. “So I spent all of last night tracking the origin down, double- and triple-checking.” She looked at Castiel again.
“Wars in our home dimension combined with the difficult journey from there to here…it resulted in the fact that not many of us who started the journey completed it. Many of those we lost were our submissives. It left our people…unbalanced. Many have tried to find partners of a like spiritual…bent, …but even if connections are made, they are generally imperfect and at least somewhat unsatisfying. Some have given up trying to find someone; some have known themselves well enough that they have never tried.”
Dean’s heart beat sped up, and he tried to take a few deep breaths as the Registrar reached out with both hands, laying them on both the angels’ shoulders. A heartbeat later, an amazing warmth erupted throughout Dean’s body, starting from where the angels’ hands touched him and blossoming until it filled him to overflowing. The warmth did not have the fuzzy comfort of the earlier magic, but rather it had the quality of a burning sun, it seemed to Dean, flashing through him. It wasn’t painful, just – too much. Dean shuddered, but Castiel’s and Gabriel’s hands were there, solid and bracing. The magic slowly faded, and Dean finally drew a deep breath, trying to steady himself, trying to understand what had just happened. Whatever it was, he knew it had done something. It scared him, but there was nothing he could do about it.
He turned to face the young human standing on the other side of the room. He was tall and well built, but still slim with youth, and he was beautiful. Castiel knew him to be in his early twenties, but his boyish, unlined face made him appear no more than a teenager. His hair was dark and close cropped, and sharp green eyes met his warily. His blue jeans were worn and faded, and his black t-shirt and red flannel shirt were covered by an equally worn brown leather jacket. Old, cracked brown leather boots were planted on the concrete floor of the jail cell. A slight smirk lurked on his face.
“I have partners along the dominance/submission spectrum, Dean, but no one has ever matched me as you do. Perhaps you are thinking that one time is not enough evidence for me to make that statement, and it might be true, if I had not experienced your soul. Your body is beautiful, and you are a good, attractive man, but your soul is…the most amazing thing I have ever seen. I wanted nothing more than for you to be my partner and me to be yours, Dean.” Castiel stopped, not sure if there was anything else he could say. He had been as clear as he was capable of. The rest was Dean’s to decide
“It came from Raphael’s computer. I checked the system access and security cameras. Raphael sent it.”
A tingling warmth flowed through Dean from his shoulder down his arm and then through his chest and further until his whole body felt it, and the pain eased. It didn’t entirely go away, but it was magnitudes better, and Dean groaned with the relief.
Dean’s face flamed. He didn’t want to even think about it, that word, what it meant, what it did to him, but Castiel left him nowhere to hide from it. “I’m your bitch…I’m glad to be your bitch…Cas,” he choked out, embarrassed, trying not to be ashamed. He could do this for Castiel.
Dean nodded. It wasn’t anything he hadn’t expected, and to be honest, he felt a weird sense of relief. And warmth. While he knew a large portion of the angels’ swift and decisive reaction to what had happened was a result of the threat against their brother, he also felt they were taking care of what was theirs – him. And he hadn’t been taken care of for a long, long time.
“Let me complicate that a little bit for you.” Gabriel smiled at the snort Dean let out. “That percentage does not correlate with…importance, or…significance.” He was trying to be very careful here.
The beating kept going, pulling deep groans out of the young man now. “Castiel, stop. He’s done.” Gabriel’s voice was louder.
John’s expression softened, just a bit. “I know, son. Last time. Please. Tell me. Start from when I called Dean with the tip.” John had been on a job five states away when he received an anonymous email tip about a werewolf preying on humans not far from their home in South Dakota. Dean had been staying home, resting up a sprained ankle from their last job. Sam had just come back for the summer after his first year away in college in California, keeping his brother company.
Castiel inhaled sharply and smiled, pleasure spiking hard. “Yes…perfect, Dean, thank you, I appreciate that,” he said, giving Dean the positive reinforcement he needed. He sped up, punching into Dean harder. He wouldn’t last much longer, even if he had just come a few minutes ago. Hearing Dean admit that - it was too much. He grunted and came again, spurting into Dean again. He gave himself a minute to rest, then pulled out and gently turned Dean over. He smiled down at him and then moved to take his cock in his mouth and suck hard. Dean shouted in surprise and overwhelming pleasure and came just a few seconds later.
And seriously, weirdest of all the weird crap – while it was all kinds of wrong what had happened to him – there was still a…something…there that Dean shied away from even in the privacy of his own mind. He wasn’t going to think about it, nope. He was going to stay behind his odd shield of don’t give a fuck until he had a few minutes alone to pack it all up and stuff it away for another day – year…hell, decade from now, if he had anything to say about it.
John’s gaze moved around the table, meeting their eyes, one by one. “I got an anonymous tip emailed to me about that werewolf. That’s not uncommon. But we all know that was a fuckin’ set up. Anybody hear anything about anonymous tips that led to trouble, or other kinds of set ups? Trouble in the community? Think about it, people. I’m trying to find out if this was aimed at me or if it was something else.”
Dean had tried to come up with a logical way to lay everything he’d been thinking about out for Sam, but had pretty much failed. Finally, he figured he’d just spit out the various things he’d been thinking, and let Sam sort it out. He was good at that. He’d had years of practice with Dean, after all.
He wasn’t able to figure everything out in these few days, but he was able to draw one conclusion and decide on a few questions he needed answers to - some from Castiel and Gabriel, some from himself. His hard-fought, and hard-won conclusion was that he enjoyed being dominated by Castiel and Gabriel. He enjoyed getting fucked by them. He wouldn’t go so far as to open that up to any hypothetical others, but he couldn’t deny what had been happening, even if it would make his life so much easier. If…when..he was free, he could go back to his life as a hunter, helping his dad, helping people. But truth be told, that life hadn’t been so satisfying, either. He missed his brother - working with him, hanging out with him, having fun with him. He couldn’t get much of that with his dad, as he’d admitted to Sam- he wasn’t even around that much anymore. Dean had known things weren’t great, but he hadn’t known what he could do about it, what would make it better. What did he want?
“We were careful going in, but everything was quiet. No signs of anyone – human or werewolf. Finally, we found a small room on the second level – it was set up like a small apartment, and there was a dead guy there, an older, gray haired guy, looked like he had been stabbed from the quick look we took. We had just started to check out his room when we heard noise from back on the ground level. We went to check it out, and it was the cops.”
He looked at Gabriel questioningly. Gabriel shook his head. “These are the only ones. I can’t feel Joshua right now.”
“Those who attacked you are dead, Deano, and the rest of the group has been taken into custody. This won’t happen again,” Gabriel added.
“A convict can be assigned to a victim or a victim’s heirs as Unrestricted Labor if the crime was either sexual or had serious physical consequences.” He met Dean’s eyes once again. “Such as yours.”
There was another awkward silence until finally Gabriel broke it. “Ooookay then, people. Let’s get this party started.” He turned to Castiel.
Gabriel started to fuck him, slowly at first, then he picked up the tempo until he was slamming into Dean over and over, fucking him deeply, driving all thought from his mind.
I know I didn’t explain everything, but this feels complete to me, and I didn’t want to shoehorn some superfluous info into the story here. I may write a time stamp if and when I feel it - a window into what kind of pattern their lives together have settled into.
“Charlie, have you had a chance to look at the transcript of Dean’s trial that I had sent to the office?”
Castiel smiled genuinely. He watched as Gabriel gave one last deep thrust and yelled, filling Dean’s body with his hot come as well and stilling over the top of Dean, chest heaving and body hot and sweaty with exertion.
They hung up a few minutes later, and Dean sat there for a bit, letting it all settle. Dad was caught up – well, mostly - and would talk to Charlie. Sam was caught up. Now he just had to wait and see what Charlie could come up with. It wasn’t his best thing, but he didn’t have a choice. And in the meantime – he had to work on what the hell was going on between the three of them and why Dean wasn’t running for the hills.
Footsteps came closer, and Dean tensed, pain flaring in response. A man stood in the doorway, not too tall, not too broad, with longish, sandy hair and sharp features. He looked down at Dean, meeting his eyes.
“Dean, this is Charlie Bradbury, our office manager, and ‘Jill of all trades’. I don’t know what that is, but she asks that we call her that. We could not operate without her,” Castiel said, ushering the short, pixie-like red-head into the living room. Dean could hear the virtual quotation marks in Castiel’s speech, and he smiled.
Gabriel smiled down at Joshua. “Fair enough.  I am glad you came to visit. Joshua, this is Dean, he belongs to me and Castiel now.  He has his own duties, so don’t bother him, alright? Come to me or Castiel if you need something.”
There was a moment of utter silence, broken by a deep indrawn breath. “Jesus. All right. Good. Good.”
Castiel turned his attention back to Dean, laying unresisting under him, his breathing harsh and raspy, shuddering with pain. He shifted his knees wider to give him stability, and started to fuck into him, thrusting deep and hard, pulling out nearly all the way, then powering home, making sure Dean would remember this forever – the first time he had taken a man’s cock up his ass. It certainly wouldn’t be the last. His cock belonged here, buried deep inside his newly taken bitch. The tight vise of Dean’s ass felt like heaven squeezing his cock as he drove in again and again. He took his time, enjoying everything about this. Dean belonged to him now. Castiel would make sure he felt that, all the way to the core, each and every day for the next five years. Finally, he pushed home one last time and came hard, yelling out his release, his triumph, his dominance, spilling his semen deep inside the boy, marking him forever as the bitch he was now and would always be. After a few seconds to make sure he had emptied everything he had into Dean, he slowly pulled out, satisfied for now. He would fuck him again once they got home. He straightened his clothes and reached down to grab Dean’s arm.
The Registrar looked at him. She wasn’t smiling, but it wasn’t a cold look, either. She turned her head to look at Castiel. “State your claim, Castiel.”
“So…you’re gonna stay? Is that what you’re saying? And see how it goes? And if it does, I get to come visit you? And you get to…do whatever you want, right, I mean, get a job or go to school or whatever, right? Are you gonna get your own place or…? Sam’s questions started up again.
Well, he knew that wasn’t exactly right, but that was how it felt sometimes. Sam had been gone for around seven months or so when he came back for spring break – and this crap happened. The time hunting alone with his dad – well, it hadn’t gone great, to be honest. John just didn’t have a lot of…well, anything, really, to give to Dean except for orders. And it wasn’t enough. Before, Dean had Sam to take care of and hang out with, joke with, tease. After, he had a lot of silence and a few random hookups when he couldn’t take it anymore.
He cocked his head, shaking it gently. “Killing the werewolf did make a bit of noise. Someone must have heard something they shouldn’t have. Anyway, I was not able to get to both humans quickly enough for my comfort, so I simply dropped the knife and flew away.”
Castiel had watched as he went about his morning routine. He had been planning this since mid-way through the trial, but he still felt…off balance with the human in their house, disturbing the energy of their home. He had felt so triumphant yesterday, when he was finally able to demonstrate his dominance over the unruly young human thug – to begin to make him pay for killing Silas – his first friend outside of the angel community. They had met nearly fifteen years ago, when Castiel had first emerged from the angel community as an adult. Silas had taken a liking to the quiet, reserved angel and had gradually become his mentor, both socially and professionally.
Castiel returned his gaze to Dean. Well. He hadn’t wanted to scare Dean, but if Gabriel was telling him it was okay to say it, then he would. His eyes met and held Dean’s beautiful, confused green eyes, looking deep into his even more beautiful soul.
Gabriel rolled his eyes. “In his office, of course.” He had kept trying to get Castiel to use Dean, to no avail. Castiel had holed up in his office and bedroom, alternately, for the entire week before their brothers returned from the Banshee job they had just completed.
In addition to being totally confused about what Gabriel was saying about Castiel, Dean was also totally confused about what he was feeling about the whole situation, too.
Castiel blinked and nodded. He set his hand on Dean’s other shoulder, then used the other to brace the human’s back, ignoring the stiffening of his body. He looked at the Registrar. “Ready.”
Dean blinked and again looked from one angel to the other. They were serious. So much had changed in the space of a few hours – from an invisible slave (to Castiel, although he certainly hadn’t been invisible to Gabriel, he smirked to himself) to…what? A guest? What exactly was he, now? And how long might he be stuck in this in-between space? He didn’t know what came after, and he was frankly afraid to let himself believe.
Raphael laughed, amused. “Hardly a spree, Castiel. I am not so crass. There was never a need for that. I just…removed one here, one there, two over there. They were just humans, after all. No need to get excited. If you don’t approve, I will stop. It would be a shame, though.”
Gabriel gave his brother an exasperated glare. “Tell him what you want, Castiel. He needs to know right now.”
Dean lay sprawled out on the couch, watching the big screen television that it seemed no one else ever did. Well, he wasn’t about to let something this glorious go to waste. Things had settled down mostly, but now…now he was waiting for the big reveal. Or whatever. He still really didn’t know what the hell was gonna happen. He didn’t know what he wanted, much less what Castiel - or Gabriel - wanted. After a lot of going around and around with it all in his head, he’d come to the conclusion that he had wait for Castiel to lay it out for him before he could make heads or tails of it. Thus his epic binge of all things television.
Sam had grown up and away from Dean, and Dean knew it was normal; more than that, it was a good thing, that Sam had become a strong, independent young man. But he did miss it sometimes – that look of love and faith in Sam’s eyes. This wasn’t the same, of course, but it reminded him of the good times, and Dean allowed himself this taste of a good thing in the chaos his life had become.
As Sam got older, he had rebelled against their father’s strict orders, training, hunting, and moving from place to place. He wanted a home and friends, a school that he could go to for more than a year. The fights got longer and louder, the older he got, until he finally broke away from hunting and got into Stanford last year. Dean hated the fighting and tried to mediate, but sometimes he just had to stand back and let them go at it. He saw both sides, but his first loyalty was to Sam. When he saw the direction things were going, he helped his brother as best he could, supporting him when he applied for admission and scholarships. He didn’t want to see him go, but Dean knew they couldn’t go on the way they were. Sam and John were just too alike, too hard-headed. John’s mission was not, and never would be, Sam’s. Sam wanted to live his own life, and Dean did everything he could to help him, even though it tore at him, that his brother was leaving him.
Dean’s face flamed red, and he turned his eyes away from Gabriel. He really wanted to forget that whole thing happened, but he was lost, and the knot in his gut wouldn’t go away.
He left his brother to his thoughts and went to take care of his own work. The sooner he finished, the sooner he could take Dean back to his room, get him naked on his hands and knees, and ride him hard and deep. He thought it could be fun to see how close he could get the boy to coming before leaving him there. He really wanted Castiel to get his head out of his ass in time to take Dean that last inch and show him how good it was to be their obedient little bitch.
Once inside, Castiel took in the scene with a quick glance. Dean hung from his wrists, shirtless, bloody and broken, and three humans stood before him, their hands bruised and swollen from beating him, their clothes flecked with his blood. Another flicker of will, and they dropped to the floor, unconscious. Castiel wanted nothing more than to destroy them as he had the one outside, but his first priority was Joshua.
Dean took another sip of tea, just to gave something to do while his mind tried to shift into gear. He looked at Gabriel, too uncomfortable with Castiel’s sudden intensity. “What happens next?”
Joshua, who had never had this kind of close contact with a human, was fascinated with Dean and couldn’t stay away from him. Dean had tried to maintain a distance, but Joshua reminded him so much of a young Sam, that he couldn’t bring himself to push the boy away. It wasn’t that he was so much like Sam, he really wasn’t. It was the unguarded openness and ever-present curiosity the youngster displayed that made Dean remember the good times with Sam, when Sam looked up to him as the one with all the answers, his big brother.
“It’s alright Dean, just relax. I’m not gonna hurt you. Just relax for me, that’s it. That’s beautiful, Dean, you take my cock so beautifully. It feels so good, having you wrapped hot and tight around my cock.” Gabriel was finally all the way in, penetrating Dean fully, the way he had wanted to since he saw Castiel fucking him earlier at the jail.
Luke laughed loudly. Smirking, he said, “I bet Castiel and Gabriel aren’t looking at his face much – I bet they have him bent over, legs spread wide for them all the time.”
The beating started. They took turns, alternating their blows with questions. Dean didn’t respond to either. They struck him from the front, then they moved to the back, then the front again. There wasn’t a lot of room to get at his sides, but that still left a lot of vulnerable, painful territory for them to pound. Dean’s attention wavered and faded as he slipped into straight suffering. He knew he just has to hold on long enough…but fuck, why, why is it taking so long! Where are his fucking angels?! Then coherent thought began to take too much effort, and all he could do was endure.
Joshua let out a peal of laughter as he slapped his cards down on the table in front of Dean. Dean grinned back at him, enjoying the boy’s uninhibited joy at beating him finally. They had been spending a lot of time alone lately, despite what Gabriel had said about not bothering him. In the first day or two Gabriel had watched them closely, but he could immediately see that Dean was comfortable and good with Joshua.
Castiel swallowed. Gabriel was an exceptional healer. If he needed Castiel’s help…. He didn’t know exactly what had happened here, but he could guess that Dean had protected Joshua with everything he had, maybe a little bit more. He owed Dean his little brother’s life. After everything that had happened to him…after everything Castiel had done to him…Dean had still saved an angel’s life. He knew he would have a lot to think about soon, but first, he had to help Gabriel save Dean.
“Meeting angels – it’s cool, right? I mean, we’ve never run into angels before, so I’m learning some stuff about them that’s…it’s not like anything we knew about in the lore. And…living with them – Gabriel is….” Dean blinked and tried to figure out a PG way to describe Gabriel. He wasn’t sure he could.
Little by little Dean had found himself gravitating toward Castiel. Castiel would often be found in the kitchen or living room, mostly working on his computer or studying papers. Dean would sit close, but not too close, and watch for a while, but he usually ended up falling asleep. He wasn’t sleeping well at night – too much was going through his mind, but once he found himself in Castiel’s presence for any length of time, he relaxed, the hum quieted, and he fell asleep.
“Ramiel, Joshua is in the bathroom. Please take him back to our office, if you will. Michael and Luke, these three have information we should have. Please take care of it,” Castiel directed confidently, and the three nodded, and moved to make it happen. He turned back to Dean and glanced at Gabriel, the best healer among them.
The next few days were the busiest Castiel had ever been. Charlie helped by collecting the electronic evidence, which included the security video detailing Raphael’s confession and his attempted murder of Castiel. She also discovered the files Raphael had kept on everything he had done – it turned out that he was as efficient and attentive to detail with regard to murder as he had been in running their business. Castiel was both horrified again and thankful for the records, since they would allow him to do what he could to assist those injured and left behind.
Turning back to the waiting young man, Castiel slowly and deliberately approached him, stopping a couple of feet away. This close, he could feel the younger man’s body heat. Castiel was a bit shorter than the young man, but his solid presence more than made up for it.
“I am not a natural healer, as Gabriel is. When I helped him heal you, I had to let my grace touch your soul in order to hold you here,” he explained.
Castiel was shaking his head before the Dean’s final words. “No, Dean.” He cocked his head slightly and his eyes unfocused a bit, as if looking at something behind Dean.
“Suck my cock, bitch. That’s it, that’s amazing, you’re a natural….” Cas sighed and came, filling Dean’s mouth, spilling down his throat inside and out. After so long resisting his beautiful boy, he couldn’t last long this first time.
Sam swallowed again and took a deep breath. He could do this. One more time. “Dean came into my room and told me you called about a werewolf hunting a couple hours away from us, killing humans. He said you had tip about where it was holed up. If the information held up, the job should be easy. We packed up and headed out to talk to the local law enforcement and the three victims’ families mentioned in the tip.”
“Yeah, dude, I’m totally okay.” Dean’s mind flashed an image of him hanging helplessly, blow after blow falling on him. “I’ll be okay,” he reassured his brother and himself at the same time.
“I didn’t know what to do, so I did nothing. But I did watch you. You were so…confident, so easy, with Gabriel. He was dominating you, but you didn’t seem to…hate him, resent him. You are charming, Dean, intelligent, and good. You are such a good man. I could see it, but I didn’t want to. You were good with Joshua - you joked and played with him, even though you had every reason to hate angels. And then you saved his life. And then I saw your soul. And I was…done. It’s true that seeing your soul made me finally realize how wrong I was and how much I did want you for myself, of your own free will, but everything about you from the time I first saw you had led me to it.”
Castiel looked at Gabriel, then followed his gaze to Dean, who was so visibly wound up that he was almost vibrating. Ah. Yes. Gabriel was right. He was not subtle. But he didn’t think that’s what Dean needed or wanted. But Dean did need him to be clear. He could follow Gabriel’s guidance.
“Good boy.” Dean closed the panel, making sure it fit but wasn’t airtight. He felt time running out, and he had to get away from Joshua’s hiding spot, now. He had no idea what was going on, but he figured better safe than sorry. If these guys turned out to be repairmen or something, then he’d be embarrassed, but he knew deep down humans breaking into an angel’s house meant nothing good.
“Charlie was the one who noticed the video feed from the house had frozen. She told us. She was also helping us with tracking down the members of that group,” Castiel answered his unspoken questions.
Dean shut his eyes for a moment, then looked at who he thought must be Gabriel. “Yeah,” he forced out.
Castiel knew that Dean could not have murdered his friend. It was so totally incompatible with what he had seen that it was bedrock knowledge for him. That’s not to say, as Gabriel had mentioned once, that Dean
“I have arranged for a copy of the trial transcript to be sent to my assistant, Charlie. She is our office manager and an expert in all things electronic. She will attempt to trace where the initial email that was sent to your father came from. It is my intention to see you cleared and free again, as soon as I can.”
John sighed out a long breath, thinking. It was pretty clear that it had been a trap meant for him, or him and Dean both. Sam had been an unexpected addition to the situation, since he had been out of the picture for nearly a year. Three things stood out for him. One, who sent the tip, why, and how did they know him? Two, why did the police show up when and where they did? And three, who killed the werewolf? He knew it all was likely to be related, but it helped him to pull out the threads.
The young man got knocked down a few times and got back up to take more and more abuse, until finally he couldn’t get up anymore, and still Castiel beat him, launching punishing kicks to his thighs, buttocks, belly, shoulders, and back. Finally, the young man lay still, gasping harshly, blood covering his face and splattered over his clothes and the concrete around him.
The one question Gabriel had not yet answered was what the hell the Registrar had meant when she said he was their bitch now and forever. He got the “now” part, but where the hell did the “forever” part come in?  He had asked, of course he had, but at that question Gabriel just gave him a pleased smirk and kept on with whatever he was doing. It was a bit maddening, really.
Dean woke suddenly, his body assaulting him with messages of pain from everywhere. He breathed through it, trying to keep from exacerbating the pain and failing. As young as he was, he had a lot of experience dealing with pain, but this was next level. All of his nerve endings were screaming their distress, and he slowly forced it back enough to turn his attention back to the outer world.
He waited until Sam ran down, then said, “I don’t have all the answers yet, Sam. Let me do one thing at a time.”
He couldn’t actually make any decisions yet. All he could do was work on acknowledging being dominated did something for him, and try like hell to believe that didn’t make him weak.
Castiel cocked his head. He hadn’t intended this part of the conversation until after Dean was freed, but he could see that Dean’s current reaction was not the relief and happiness he had anticipated. Sometimes he had a hard time interacting with humans. He wasn’t the best at interpreting their facial expressions or body language, certainly not as good as Gabriel was. Very well.
Dean didn’t know how long they stood like that, but eventually Castiel slowly stepped away, keeping hold of his hand as he pulled him toward the table and then held the chair for Dean to sit. He moved to fix another cup of tea, setting it down in front of Dean before he took his own chair again.
Her job was to assist the Novaks – well, it was, even if she mostly – okay, totally – ended up assisting Castiel alone because the others really didn’t have too much to do with humans. She ran the office and everything associated with it and did pretty much anything else Castiel needed help with. So – keeping an eye on the house.
As their blue eyes met green, Castiel’s grace touched Dean’s soul, and Castiel was engulfed in an explosion of power and magic and possibility that he could barely comprehend. He didn’t see energy as his brother Gabriel did, in colors and streams, but he saw/heard/felt the totality of Dean, the absolute and utterly overwhelming beauty of Dean’s soul, and he knew he would never be the same.
Dean groaned as Gabriel pushed one last time into him and came, filling him in hot, wet spurts. Gabriel rested for a few moments, draped over Dean’s body, enjoying the feeling of his balls emptying into the young human under him. One hand reached for Dean’s cock, finding it hard and leaking, as he expected. He smiled into Dean’s shoulder and stroked him gently for a few minutes before pulling his hand away. He felt Dean’s aborted move toward his retreating hand and smiled a little bit more, before his smile faded and he sighed.
The prosecution had claimed that the werewolf had died from a stab wound to the heart within about an hour or two of when he was found. The knife had entered from the front, angled precisely to catch his heart, and the prosecution’s experts had claimed he would have died nearly instantly, thus the perpetrator must have been an expert with a blade – like someone with a hunter of Dean’s level of experience.  They had found the murder weapon thrown under the bed – a nondescript silver dagger, blade still bloody but handle wiped clean.
Dean felt his face flush hotly at Luke’s comment, but he kept his gaze up. He wasn’t about to let this guy get to him like that.
The young man struggled weakly and groaned as he was penetrated, but he had nothing left to fight with. His body was racked with pain, bruises blooming red and purple everywhere. Even breathing hurt, and he thought dimly that maybe he might be dying. Over and above all that, he felt the hot searing pain of the angel’s huge cock as it pushed into him and filled him full. He felt dull and confused, not sure what was happening now. He hadn’t been surprised at the angel’s presence, and he hadn’t been surprised he got his ass handed to him. But this - this was totally out of his experience – this was not something he had been ready for.
Dean felt the man’s heat and presence behind him, then he felt the fingers gently push into him. It felt weird – really weird, but it didn’t hurt. His tense muscles slowly relaxed and then he felt the most amazing thing as those fingers found a spot inside him that made him see stars. He grunted and realized that he was starting to get hard. What the hell?!
Dean searched his memory - there were something pinging in his back brain, but it was too vague to grab onto, and he shook his head.
Dean knelt down in front of Castiel, looking up, his heart beating fast, the muscles throughout his body trembling with nerves. He wanted this, he did, but there was so much going on in his head. Castiel’s hands went to his belt and he slowly unbuckled and unzipped, then pushed his trousers and tight boxer shorts down his thick thighs, baring his hard cock. Dean swallowed. Cas was much bigger than Gabriel - both longer and thicker. He’d never really thought of a man’s cock as beautiful before - his own was functional and a source of stress relief and pleasure when he chose to exercise it, but others’ were - well, had been - so off limits that Dean had never allowed himself to contemplate what it would be like, to be this close to one - to be allowed to focus on one. He leaned closer and tentatively reached out with his tongue, gently contacting Cas’s cock that he held out for him. Tentatively, he tried again, licking, then opening his mouth wide and lunging up a bit to take Cas’s cock into his mouth. He reached up with one hand to grip what his mouth couldn’t cover, and he started to gently suck, trying to keep his teeth away from tender flesh. This was more difficult that he would have thought before. Girls and women who’d done this for him had mostly made it look easy, he thought grumpily, pulling off, frustrated.
Dean didn’t know what to think about that either. Gabriel never hurt him, making sure he was stretched out and lubed up, and Dean’s body seemed to enjoy it quite a bit. He started to get hard even before Gabriel pulled him to his room, and by the time Gabriel came, Dean was all the way hard, but Gabriel hadn’t made him come yet. After Gabriel left each night, Dean stroked himself until he came, cleaned himself up, and went to sleep easily. It was so weird. He would have expected himself to hate this, to hate Gabriel, to feel angry and…well, he didn’t even want to finish that thought. He didn’t feel that, though. One side of his brain knew that he got a hot wisp of…pleasure…when Gabriel dominated him, when he called him a bitch. The other side of his brain wanted to bury that first thought fucking deep and never think about it again, but he couldn’t, because it happened every night. There was no getting away from the totally unwanted thought that he enjoyed serving Gabriel that way.
Hearing of Silas’ death had hit Castiel hard. He had never lost someone so close to him. As a hunter, it was not entirely unexpected, but still – and to a human? The utter uselessness of it, the waste of the such a good man had torn a hole in Castiel. Watching the trial day after day, hearing the prosecution claim that the human had hated all magical races, that he had set a trap for a werewolf, that he had murdered that werewolf, it had enraged Castiel – that a human could wipe away all that Silas had been, all the good he had done, in ignorance and hate. He had wanted, no, needed, to see the human punished. The defense tried to claim that Winchester had been tracking a rogue werewolf who had killed several humans in the last couple of weeks before the incident, and that the evidence led him to Silas. They claimed that Winchester had found Silas already dead.
Dean grimaced at their backs. Nice. Four more angels to deal with. Well, the boy wouldn’t be an issue – he might even be fun, but the other three…. Dean shook his head. He already missed being alone with his two angels.
So what the hell, he wasn’t a coward, Dean thought. He was attracted to the angel. He wanted to feel that strength, that power focused on him again. He had a feeling next time would be different. Next time would be…clarifying. He hoped.
“Ah, okay. Thanks, Charlie,” Dean was a little uncomfortable with this stranger knowing so much about him and what happened to him, but he was going to try to ignore that discomfort for now.
Gabriel nodded at the three angels in turn. Michael was a tall, dark haired man, almost startlingly handsome, with warm brown eyes. Luke was about average height, with sandy hair, and a sardonic grin on his face. Dean resolved to be careful of that one. Ramiel was the shortest and slight of build, with dark hair and eyes also.
Castiel cocked his head. He wasn’t sure what the words meant, but he got the gist. And he was amazed and amused, despite it all. This human who had every reason to hate him, was giving him a nickname and…teasing him? This man who had just been tortured was trying to make light of his pain?
matter to him and if so, why? And should it? Could he choose to not care about what anyone else would think? Was he that strong? And if he was that strong, why did he want what he wanted?
“Tell me, Brother, what’s holding you back?” Gabriel asked, a small smile remaining on his face after seeing his brother’s reaction.
“Sorry to hear about your boy, Winchester,” one grizzled older black man said. There was a general murmur of agreement from the others.
Dean swallowed drily. “So, it wasn’t…” He closed his eyes and lifted his hand to cover his face for a moment, holding on. “It wasn’t the best time of my life, okay? But I need to…not talk about that right now, Sam.” He swallowed again.
The young human had to know that he had no real chance against the strength of an angel, but that didn’t stop him from trying. Castiel moved with the punches, absorbing the lightning fast blows that kept coming for a few minutes that felt like forever to those watching, and the magistrate shifted uneasily until he caught Gabriel’s shake of the head.
John took a deep breath and let it out slowly, silently. He nodded acknowledgement. “You guys hear anything?”
“He’s a murderer, Gabriel, and a bigot. He killed my friend – our friend – just because he was a werewolf.”
Dean was undeniably, unmistakably human, but when his soul had touched Castiel’s grace, they had recognized each other, reached for each other, intertwined and tasted each other as only those who are meant to be Soulbound do.
Gabriel took Joshua’s hand and turned to go find Castiel and the others. He looked over his shoulder at Dean and said, “Finish your chores, Dean. Please have dinner ready for all of us in three hours.”
“I don’t know, Castiel. But what I do know is that Dean said he didn’t do it, and after the past few days with him, I believe him. Oh, he’s no helpless kitten, that boy, he *is* a hunter, after all, but I think if he’d killed Silas, he’d have admitted it.”
“Do it, Gabriel,” one dark, gravelly voice ordered, “you know you have to establish the relationship now, before we register him.”
not have killed him, but murder – no. He was innocent, and Castiel had beaten and fucked him and treated him…. Castiel swallowed. He could not take back what he had done, but he recognized two more items of bedrock knowledge. He would do everything he could to find the truth and see Dean free again. And he was meant for Dean, as Dean was meant for him.
Sam paused to gulp some water, then continued. “It all checked out. The sheriff’s department gave us copies of the reports; the families confirmed the details. We went out to the abandoned warehouse he was supposed to be holed up in.”
Dean heard Sam’s sincerity, and something tight in his chest eased. It had been hard watching Sam go away, head out on his own, but he knew the kid had to go after his own dreams, and he was proud of him, he was. But it had been hard watching him go and not look back. This, knowing Sam still wanted him around, hadn’t been trying to ditch
“Yeah, about that. First, I’m okay, alright?” Dean waited for Sam’s slightly apprehensive okay in return, then told him what happened.
Dean swallowed. He felt light-headed again and wondered what he was supposed to say now. The ground had shifted under him, and he felt unsteady. Castiel could see his soul? And it was…unmarred? But…he knew he wasn’t perfect. He had been a hunter for years…that definitely came with some ugly psychic baggage that slowly piled up over time. He didn’t understand this at all, so that’s what he managed to get out.
Gabriel nodded and went to sweep up the discarded clothing. His dick was hard as a rock after watching his brother mount their new bitch, but he knew it would be better to wait until they got him back to the house to take his turn between the boy’s legs. He could wait.
So the work was easy. The sex…well, he wasn’t sure what to call that. Gabriel never hurt him, and in fact, his body was totally on board with all of it. He hadn’t actually come with Gabriel inside him yet, but he was sure one of these days he would, based upon his sheer frustration level. Gabriel ordered him around and firmly took what he wanted from Dean…but he also took care of him. He saw him. He talked to him. He touched him. And Dean…loved it. And he didn’t know what the hell to do about that – how to think about that. He barely wanted to think about the fact that Gabriel had basically said he was submissive. It went against everything he’d ever been raised to be – a strong, aggressive, take-no-shit hunter. But it was also easier than anything he had ever done. He didn’t know what to think about that, and in fact, he didn’t even know if he wanted to think about that. He just wasn’t sure he was going to be able to avoid it much longer.
Castiel looked at Gabriel briefly, then moved his gaze back to Dean. “We know you’re innocent,” he stated calmly, quietly.  “
“Who? I’m here alone.” Dean tried for clueless. It wasn’t hard. He really didn’t have any idea what was going on here. Why would some humans be after an angel child? It was nearly suicide, as far as Dean could tell. He knew the Novaks would destroy anyone who hurt their brother, not to mention what the larger angel community and maybe even the rest of the supernatural community would do if humans injured or killed an angel child.
“I’m guessing they don’t think there’s much to talk about. We know it’s a rough job; hunters die. But I’ve talked to maybe fifteen gatherings across the area in the last coupla weeks. Everybody knows at least one, sometimes two hunters who’ve died…unexpectedly…in the last year or so. It’s hard to pin down a timeframe, obviously. Hard to pull out the anomalies from a regular, not “unexpected” death.” John’s hand rasped across his beard.
And he was focused on taking care of Dean. He greeted him in the morning with his regular, “Hello, Dean,” and he asked if he’d slept well. He made sure Dean ate regularly and if he needed anything. He showed Dean the room set up as a gym and encouraged him to use it regularly, “Because you need to take care of your health, Dean.” Dean tried. He ate and slept and worked out hard, and he read. And he thought. He thought about what he wanted and why, and what did that imply about him, and why did it matter anyway? He thought about his family’s reaction to him and his possible choices. He thought about other people’s reactions, and if that
“Listen, Dad, the Novaks want to help prove that I’m innocent. They want to help get my conviction vacated. They’ve got an electronics expert they think may be able to help. Her name’s Charlie Bradbury. She’s gonna be calling you soon for more information about that email. Answer her questions, okay?”
Dean picked his way carefully down the stairs, looking around for signs of anyone at all. He heard a low murmur coming from the kitchen area and froze. He had a feeling that everything had changed, but he didn’t know why he felt that, and he wasn’t sure he was gonna like it, anyway.
The magistrate finally shrugged and did as the angel asked, using his key to remove the solid steel cuffs that had bound the young man’s wrists behind him.
“Yeah, well, we’re…uh....” Dean tried to figure out how to describe this part of it. “He asked me to stay, so….”
Dean knew he should be happy, knowing Gabriel wasn’t going to feel free to fuck him every night, and happier that Castiel would never touch him again…but he wasn’t. It was weird and fucked up, but he…well, it would be quite a stretch to say he’d been happy, but he hadn’t been unhappy. He had felt…carefree? That wasn’t quite right, either, but it came close. From the time he was four years old and his dad had shoved Sammy into his arms, he had never been free of the weight of that responsibility. His job was to take care of his brother, and after that, to take care of his dad. Yeah, Sam had grown up and gone to college, but that still left him staying with his dad, following orders, being there because he frankly didn’t know what would happen to his dad if he tried get a life of his own. He’d been holding his family together with his fingernails and determination and stress, and after the trial – well, the stretched taut rubber band had loosened, and all Dean had to do was relax and live day to day. The chores were easy and not all that burdensome.
So this one was a struggle to write, both because of real life and because this is a kind of transition chapter with a lot of different stuff going on. I hope it doesn't come off as too choppy or busy, but I'm trying to keep to my outline for this, my first real fic, and some strings had to get woven in here for everything else to go the way I intend it to. I also wanted to thank you guys for your comments and kudos, it gives me a reason to keep marching forward and also lets me know where I need to focus some attention in the story. I hope you enjoy -
Castiel bypassed that. “You believe him, then? You believe his story about the anonymous tip and Silas being dead when he got there? That means that someone had to have killed Silas and set Dean up for it. What possible reason could there be for that?”
Now. Now he was getting fucked every night – his thoughts broke off at that, and he frowned, his thought abruptly detoured. Gabriel must be healing him. Huh. Anyway – he was getting fucked every night by an angel – a man whose physical stature might not match his, but his strength and his…confidence, his power, made Dean feel – not really small or weak (he hadn’t been small or weak for years) – but maybe…protected? That might not be quite the word for it either, but whatever it was, Dean enjoyed the way Gabriel manhandled him, put him in the positions he wanted, guided him, held him up, held him down, and just plain held him. Gabriel’s strength and power, along with his gentle, sometimes wicked humor, let him relax and let go for the first time in years, let him set down his “armor”, and he wasn’t ready to let that go.
John knocked back his shot of whiskey, breathing through the burn. The others at the table with him did the same, and it was quiet for a few moments.
Eyes wide, Dean looked back and forth between Castiel and Gabriel. They seemed to be pretty serious. There was so much bound up in that statement that he couldn’t deal with it all at the moment. Ignoring the huge and potentially explosive implications for now, he chose to concentrate on the details. He narrowed his eyes, trying to show them he meant business. “Does that mean I’m gonna finally get some answers now?”
Castiel stayed close to home. He didn’t say much to Dean, but he was there. His solid presence steadied Dean’s flares of anxiety. It was the waiting, the uncertainty that was disturbing him. Before, he knew he couldn’t do anything about his situation except endure, make the best of it – he’d been a hunter. Patience hadn’t come easy to him, but he had learned it. This was different. This was out of his control, and he had no idea what was going to happen next.
“Oh, no.” Dean looked at Castiel, then over to Gabriel, who was smiling a bit, and kicking his leg rhythmically.
“Angels are…beings of spirit, of energy, first and foremost. It’s why we can manipulate energy – do magic, as you say. As individuals, we do have different capabilities, different talents – or perhaps it’s more accurate to say that while we all have the basics, we each have an…affinity…a particular point of view toward seeing and manipulating the energy of the universe. Our physical bodies are made of matter, of course, but maybe you could categorize angels as 95% spirit and 5% matter. Humans – well, humans can vary as well, but let’s say most are 95% matter and 5% spirit.”
The Registrar nodded. “I recognize your claims, Castiel and Gabriel. I See your essence within him. Both of you have penetrated him and filled him with your seed. He is marked as your demonstrated bitch, now and forever.”
“He’s clean and clear of any and all bonds,” she said to Castiel and Gabriel, standing just behind and to either side of Dean.
Gabriel had stopped at that, highly unsatisfactory point for Dean. A few things had settled in his mind, but Gabriel’s ‘angel class’ had raised even more questions for him, questions that Gabriel had already said he wouldn’t answer – yet.
Buried full-length in the young man’s tight asshole, his balls pressed firmly against his firm round buttocks, Castiel turned to look at the magistrate. “Witness, if you please, Magistrate. I’ve taken Dean Winchester as my bitch.”
Castiel nodded, still smiling. Gabriel knew Dean in a way that he did not, yet, but he would catch up and surpass him, he had no doubt about that. While Castiel was willing to share with his brother, Dean belonged to him. It was good to see that he acknowledged that.
It was just as well, Dean thought. He had enough to worry about on his own. Finding himself in Castiel’s proximity more and more often, he had taken the opportunity to surreptitiously study him. When he was working and Dean was supposedly reading, he could look over and watch Castiel. The man…the angel…was beautiful, Dean thought. Maybe others might prefer the word handsome, but that wasn’t quite apt enough for Dean. Castiel wasn’t quite as tall as Dean was, but his body was solid and strong in a way that Dean’s wasn’t. The muscle and bone of him- his physical being seemed to take up so much more space than it objectively should. Dean wasn’t quite sure how to describe it, but Castiel definitely had a presence that drew people’s attention - not just Dean, although that was definitely true. His eyes were a clear, light blue that, despite the color, were warm, and when he looked at him, he
That left getting fucked, to put it bluntly. And truth be told, although he was frustrated as all hell, since Gabriel hadn’t been letting him come, he…well, he liked it. He found it barely possible to admit to himself, but it was the truth. Yeah, he was a normal guy growing up – he’d had his share of hookups with women, plus a couple of relationships, although nothing really serious. He’d looked at his fair share of guys, too, but he’d never taken that step. It had just seemed to involve too much baggage to be worth the novelty, so his curiosity had never gone further than the occasional glance and a fleeting thought.
Castiel shook his head. He didn’t know how Gabriel could just...decide to believe Dean over everything the prosecution had said. He turned his back on Gabriel again, facing back to his email, and waited for Gabriel to leave.
Gabriel sighed. He surveyed the confused young human and explained. “You know about State Labor and Restricted Labor?”
Gabriel watched Castiel turn his back to him and rolled his eyes with exasperation. His little brother was so smart in some ways, but once he made his mind up it would take a sledgehammer to get him to change it. Well, he had planted the ideas he wanted Castiel to think about, anyway, and that was what all he wanted.
Embarrassed and ashamed and…naked…as he was right now, Dean also felt the tiniest, strangest curl of warmth in his belly at the thought of all of it – being forced to submit to these two angels, getting on his hands and knees and spreading his legs for them, taking their cocks inside him, feeling them fuck him deep and hard and spill their seed inside him, being their bitch. He could barely allow himself to recognize any of this…alien feeling…as his, much less begin to think about what it meant about him. Well, whatever this was, he had no time for it now. He firmly pushed any weird feelings and wayward thoughts out of his mind and concentrated on getting through the next minute, and then the next, and then the next. One thing at a time.
Castiel blinked in response as he tried to parse that expression out. Finally he came to a possible meaning and replied, “Very well.” He paused. “If we can, we will.”
“Some get emailed tips, run after them alone and end up dead in a ditch or field. Some get phone calls. Most work alone, but there have been a couple with partners where both turn up dead.  I don’t know what’s going on, Bobby, but Dean’s the only one who’s still alive after being targeted.  So far.”
It’s been a couple of hours now, and Charlie’s been checking every fifteen minutes or so. She saw Dean and Joshua were still playing cards at the table, and she idly wondered how long could they even do that. She’d never seen Joshua do one thing for so long. She’d met him a few times, and the boy struck her a normal high-energy…. She took a closer look at the camera that focused on the dining area, using the computer to pull the image up to fill the screen.
Dean, still wet and relaxed from Gabriel’s fucking and the spanking, groaned as he was filled once again. Cas’s bigger cock invaded him, making a place for itself inside him, filling him full. He felt Castiel come flush against his ass, all the way inside, and the fact of it was almost enough to make him come. He rested there for a few seconds, then pulled almost out of Dean and pushed back, slow and deliberate. He kept at this pace, fucking Dean slowly, making him feel every inch of his cock, again and again.
Castiel turned to look and abruptly dropped the paperwork he had been looking at. He surged out of his chair and toward Dean. Always, toward Dean.
“Dean!” his dad growled out in surprise. “Dean, are you okay? Where are you?” His voice was rough, urgent.
“When you are free, I will ask you to stay here, with us. I will ask you to choose to belong to us, Gabriel and I, to choose to submit to us, to accept our dominance in all ways. In return we will promise to protect and support you always. We will lead you and guide you and help you grow in whatever way seems good to us all. You would belong to us, Dean, and we would belong to you.”
Castiel got in the front seat of their nondescript sedan, while Gabriel followed Dean into the back seat, to both of their surprise. Gabriel smirked at Castiel’s look, and he reached down with one hand to gently grasp Dean’s cock. Dean flinched and inhaled sharply, but slowly relaxed as Gabriel did nothing more than hold on.
Castiel came into the room and handed the beers around, keeping one for himself. Dean shifted to sit upright, uncomfortable already, and nobody had said a thing.
Dean blinked a few times, looking back and forth between the two angels, finally settling on Castiel again. His mind scrambled, trying to fit this into the narrative. Finally, he just asked, “Why now? Just because I wouldn’t let Joshua get kidnapped?”
So, it had crossed his mind that the Novaks, as former associates of the victim, might want him as their Restricted Laborer. He hadn’t thought it likely, given Browne wasn’t an angel, but it was possible. Seeing the Novaks in his cell – well, he knew he was screwed. The ass-kicking that followed wasn’t a surprise by that point, either, since Dean was never one to expect sunshine and roses, but then – that last bit, that was a surprise. Laborers weren’t supposed to be abused – that wasn’t the point of any of it. Dean was adrift. What was happening?
Castiel knew there was no use talking to Raphael further. He would never understand the utter horror of what he had just confessed to. He turned away. He would take this to the Council and let them deal with his brother. Reaching for the door, he felt an enormous shock impact him from behind, flinging him into the still-closed door. Stunned but not incapacitated, he immediately shielded himself and turned to face his Raphael, who was still smiling as he tried to kill his brother. “I don’t think that went too well, do you, Castiel?” His eyes flared brilliantly, signs of his magic ramping up, and he struck out again, attempting to annihilate Castiel.
Dean flinched, unable to stop the reflexive movement, but he didn’t back up. He met Castiel’s unblinking gaze and was unable to look away. His heart was beating fast, pounding in his chest, and he started to feel faint. His head went light; he swayed, and then he felt strong arms come around him, holding tight, and a firm chest against his. A hand palmed the back of his head and gently guided it to a solid shoulder. Dean stood stiff for a few moments, totally confused – what even was happening? But then he allowed the warmth of Castiel’s body to enter his awareness and then seep into him. He allowed the strength in the arms holding him to anchor him. He allowed the solidity of the body pressed into his to buoy him up. The tension flowed out of him, and his breathing and heart slowed as he relaxed into Castiel’s embrace.
All at once he couldn’t wait any longer, and he moved, slowly pushing his engorged cock into the young human. Dean took a quick breath, and Gabriel shushed him.
Dean cocked his head toward the door, hearing some odd scratching sounds. He got up and went over to the monitor near the door. He saw three human-appearing men huddled close to the door. One appeared to be fiddling with the door knob, the other two were looking in opposite directions down the street. Oh, this cannot be good, Dean thought.
On some few occasions, if a convict had committed a crime against a person instead of against the state, the victim could place a claim on his or her labor if he or she desired and could support and maintain the convict. Restricted Laborers in this situation had to be approved and were monitored for appropriate obedience, work performance, and safety by the city Labor Magistrate’s Office.  RL’s owed their labor to their assignees (unofficially known as their owners), but they could only be punished for infractions by the Magistrate’s Office after a hearing. RL’s still had rights and protections.
Dean in a way no one else did. His voice was low and pleasing, sliding into Dean’s hind-brain slow and smooth, hitting an arousal button he had never before discovered. He was the calm, grounding center around which everyone circled.
Upstairs now, he kept running and closing doors. He heard the smashing of wood coming from downstairs and knew he was out of time. He darted into the master bedroom, closing and locking the door, then into the walk-in closet. Fuck, what the fuck! Everything was hung up and tidy! He should have gone into Gabriel’s room, he bet that guy had clothes lying everywhere! Dean grabbed clothes off hangers and sheets and bedding off shelves and tossed it, trying to make it look somewhat normal messy, whatever that meant, and buried himself into the resulting pile. It was ridiculous, but it was all he had now. He wanted to be hidden, slow these guys up, but he needed to be easier to find than Joshua.
John wasn’t sure what was going on or why, but he was sure that he was going to do his damndest to find out. He needed to talk to the human hunter community and see if there were any rumors going around about this kind of set up – or about anything unusual at all. It was going to take time and effort, but if there was one thing John did have, it was determination.
The brothers came back to the house in short order, one after the other, until they all sat around the living room, waiting. Castiel continued working in the kitchen until the doorbell rang, and he ushered Charlie in and took a seat himself.
Castiel shook his head as he started the car toward home. He was glad this part was done. Dean was theirs officially and publicly, to do with what they chose. While he wasn’t quite sure what that was yet, he was ready to move on to the next step.
Cas was smiling down at him. “You look beautiful on your knees for me, Dean, with your pretty mouth wrapped around my cock.”
“Uh…why? And what about Dad? Hunting? What would you even do? Why are you even thinking about it? ‘cause I know you wouldn’t even mention it if you weren’t thinking about it.” Sam’s questions were rapid-fire, leaving no room for Dean to talk until he finally ran down to silence.
Michael cocked his head at Gabriel. “So, this is Castiel’s new project?” He eyed Dean speculatively. “He’s a beautiful human, at least.”
“Dean, when I watched you at the trial, I thought you were beautiful, but also a bigoted murderer. I was blinded by preconception and anger. And so I determined to punish you, to teach you better. But even when I…hurt you…some part of me knew I was in the wrong. I saw how strong you were. I saw how brave you were. And I didn’t realize it at the time, but I must have felt something of what you are…dominating you was so good, so perfect, but I wanted you to…submit, willingly. I couldn’t deal with that idea, so I…stayed away from you entirely. I was confused.” Castiel looked away for a few moments, then back at Dean.
Dean had known from childhood that he was attracted to boys as well as girls, and he had also known that he was different from everyone else in that respect. Growing up on the road with his father and his little brother, he learned early to keep his mouth shut, keep quiet and listen, and to do what he was told. He knew of no one in the human hunter life who admitted to being anything other than a “normal” heterosexual. Maybe it wouldn’t have been a big deal to admit, but the fact was that Dean just never wanted to take that chance. His life was tough enough, he didn’t need to deal with that, too.
As a consequence of his caution, he had never had a sexual experience with a man – until Castiel had fucked him, that is. He still wasn’t quite sure what to think about that. He was aware that everything felt a little…okay, a lot, removed, right now. It felt almost as if he was watching everything happen from behind a pane of glass – he saw it, he knew what was happening, but he didn’t entirely feel it.
“Don’t make us hurt you.” Moe was ready to hurt Dean, he could see it. Maybe it was payback for earlier, maybe it was just his nature, but he was looking forward to it.
Luke still had his eyes on Dean. “Lemme take him off your hands for a bit, Gabriel, it’s been a long time for me.”
“Fuck it,” he said, abruptly fed up with his own crap. He finished descending the stairs and made his way to the kitchen doorway, uncomfortably aware he was standing in the same place he had been tortured in not that long ago.
Gabriel had told Dean all this, answering his questions easily as he showed Dean where food and supplies were kept and told him what their daily schedules were. Dean had seen Castiel only in passing, quick glimpses in the morning before Dean made breakfast for Gabriel and him, and in the evening after Dean made dinner. He wasn’t quite sure what to make of it all. Gabriel seemed to be sunny and open and direct about everything, including his unabashed enjoyment of fucking Dean deep and hard every night, filling his ass with his hot come, before leaving for his own bed with a grin and a “you’re such a good bitch for me, Dean, thank you,” thrown over his shoulder.
“I am a dominant angel, Dean. I know Gabriel has explained something of what that means for angels. What it means for me, is that I need to dominate my partner, and I need my partner to need to submit. It doesn’t work if it’s not mutual. Certainly it can feel good,” here he gave Dean a quirk of his lips at their mutual remembrance, “but the ultimate satisfaction for me comes when my partner and I work together to please each other.”
The three of them stood on the plain stage in the town square, surrounded by hundreds of humans and a few dozen magicals bearing witness to the beginning of Dean’s punishment. It was midmorning on a Saturday, the normal day and time for public ritual bindings. Normally they were mostly business or personal contracts. Occasionally, they were bindings for Restricted Laborers. This was a first in human memory – the binding of an Unrestricted Laborer. It had pulled nearly twice the usual number of witnesses and a significant number of magicals.
“UL’s are expected to take care of the sexual needs of their assignees – their superiors. Since Silas left his estate to Castiel and me jointly, we are considered his heirs. That means he and I have to claim you sexually before we take you to the Registrar for your binding – it’s part of how the magic works.”
“Gabriel! Charlie called. She’s on her way over, and she asked for all of us to be here. Call the others, please.”
Gabriel grinned, enjoying this immensely. “This human, named Dean Winchester, was given to me as one of the two heirs of Silas Browne, as Unrestricted Labor for the period of five years, in partial restitution. I claim this human, named Dean Winchester, as my bitch, bound to submit to my dominance in all ways. In token of this, I have demonstrated my dominance with my body.”  He smirked and felt himself harden as he remembered that act fondly. He would have to repeat that, very soon.
Gabriel saw the sudden realization on Dean’s face, and his cock started harden again. It had softened somewhat during the trip from the jail to their house. His strong initial reaction to seeing Castiel dominate and fuck Dean had faded as he realized how injured the young human was. They had settled Dean in the small room prepared for him, and Gabriel had argued with Castiel about letting him rest for the night first. But Castiel had been right. It would be better to get this done now, then let him recover the rest of the night before they took him to the Registrar tomorrow for the binding and marking.
Gabriel collected his thoughts for a moment. He wanted to give Dean some things to think about without overwhelming him. It was a delicate balance to walk.
“Good.” He was somewhat surprised, but also relieved to hear that. He had told Sam he wanted him to keep living his life, but he knew how stubborn Sam could be. He would call Sam as soon as he got off the phone with his dad, and he hoped his brother was actually at school.
Gabriel slowly started to fuck him, pulling nearly all the way out, then pushing deep. It went on for a long time, and Dean got harder but he didn’t get anywhere near coming. Weirdly, the whole experience felt…safe. He didn’t have to do anything, he just had to lay there and take the angel’s cock.
“Stay here, no matter what happens, until I or one of your brothers come get you, okay?” Dean emphasized it again.
Dean closed his eyes for a moment. Maybe they were telling the truth about not hurting him; maybe they weren’t. It didn’t really matter, since there was no way he could give up a child of any kind to these three, not if he could help it, and right now he could. He again mustered his best give ‘em hell smirk, and said, “There’s no kid here, buddy, but even if there was, I wouldn’t give you crap.”
He wasn’t sure it was a great idea to bring this up now, but then again, he wasn’t sure there’d ever be a good time to talk about this with his brother. But he had to talk about it to someone. “They want me to stay. After.”
Gabriel smirked. He was really looking forward to watching these two fumble their way forward, with a few nudging course corrections from him, of course.
Dean’s breath hitched a couple of times, but he slowly slid back into sleep, feeling safe and cared for, even though that made no sense whatsoever.
Dean didn’t know what to feel. Calling him confused would be a massive understatement. It was really good to be finally getting some useful information from Gabriel for a change, though. While the last point Gabriel had brought up claimed the majority of his attention, he made an effort to remember the other two as well. After his time here, he knew Gabriel would not give him random information. It was important – it was all important.
“Joshua is doing well, if a little shook up. He wanted to come back here and see you, but we’ve convinced him to wait for a bit. We wanted to talk to you, first.” Gabriel said.
The Registrar’s hands dropped away, and then, a moment later, the angels’ hands left him as well. There was an indistinct murmur from the crowd as they saw the glowing outline of hands where Castiel and Gabriel had touched Dean. The Registrar gently turned him to face the people watching. Dean flushed, self-consciousness and embarrassment filling him. He wanted to keep his eyes down or closed, but he refused to be a coward. His gaze swept the people in front of the stage then the ones in the back. He heart skipped a beat as he saw his father and younger brother, standing on the left in the back. John’s face was blank, but Sam’s was pale and strained. Dean met his brother’s eyes and gave him the slightest nod and wink, trying to tell him he was okay; he was going to be just fine. He wasn’t sure that was the truth, but he didn’t want Sam to worry – well, worry too much, anyway.
“There is no way that a being with a soul like yours could have murdered my friend. It’s impossible. Which means that I was wrong. I was wrong, and I was willfully blind to it. I’m sorry, Dean.”
“Maybe,” Castiel answered, his smile growing and becoming warm, feeling relief move through him. It was only a start, but it was a good one. Dean hadn’t rejected him out of hand, and he felt confident enough to demand answers. The young man was showing himself to be a force to be reckoned with.
He knew what the easy choice was – what his dad would expect. The easy choice would take him back to his normal life and allow him to forget the things he’d learned about himself here with Cas and Gabriel. He’d go back to hunting with his dad, non-stop travel, crappy motel rooms or camping outdoors, alternating following his dad’s demanding orders with abandonment.
“No, we’re not doing that. You guys gotta tell me - what do you want, first? Then I’m gonna ask a metric fuck ton of questions, and you get to answer them all.”
Castiel inhaled sharply. “Do you think that’s it, Raphael? Do you think that we are going to overlook your murder spree?”
Dean turned to see a young dark-haired boy, maybe around ten or eleven – or at least he would be, if he were human. The boy grinned at Gabriel and launched himself into Gabriel’s open arms, hugging him, his face alight with pleasure and joy. Dean couldn’t help but smile at the sight.
He hit the lock and closed the door and then ran through the bottom floor, locking and closing all the doors. He needed to slow these guys down as much as he could. He knew the house was alarmed and monitored, he just had to buy as much time as he could until the Novaks could get someone back to the house. His mind worked, trying to figure out where he should hide…if he should hide.
“They get in the way, don’t they, Castiel? Sad, weak little monkeys, chattering and flinging shit around. The fewer there are, the better we angels can maintain our control over both human and supernatural society. Plus, Novak Brothers gets more jobs to choose from. Win, win.” He smiled widely, clearly pleased with himself.
Dean was a fully grown human man, tall and well-muscled, and he projected a confident cockiness, even as he was being beaten by Castiel. But Gabriel had seen beneath the physical mask – the boy’s cool green energy had flowed and given way before Castiel’s dominant, icy blue energy even before the first punch had been thrown. By the time Castiel had mounted him, Dean’s energy had surrounded and gently smoothed the icy spikes of Castiel’s energy. Dean was born to be a submissive – it was obvious to an energy-worker like Gabriel. And it was equally obvious he was no murderer. Castiel would realize sooner or later where Gabriel’s certainty of that came from, and maybe then he would use his talent to See Dean as he was.
The bathroom here on the ground floor wasn’t spacious by any means, and Dean felt his heart fall as he took in the space, but Joshua slid between the toilet and shower, pushed at the narrow wood panel there, and it popped open, revealing a small empty area. Joshua turned to look at Dean for approval. He didn’t know what was going on, and he was scared, but he trusted Dean.
A flicker of will, and Castiel smote the human from existence. The barrier disappeared, and Castiel strode toward the door. He can see it now, splintered and open. Gabriel followed at his shoulder. They had no idea what they would face inside, and fear for their brother was paramount in them both.
