For the first time Greg is actually terrified of what he might do. It suddenly occurred to him that john is a very dangerous man.
“Here” he thrust the clothes in Sherlocks hands
"Sherlock!" Greg barked. He ducked his head out of the way and wiped his ear.
Greg wrapped his arm around to hold the other side of his waist.
He decided to straddle him and placed one knee next to his hip.
Eight bloody Years and he thought they mastered the art of forgetting something ever happened.
Greg started to move them toward the door.
He would never admit it but god the bath felt good.
Her hands flying to her chest. Worry filling her eyes.
Sherlock continues to stare at Greg. Not exactly sure if he hates him or not.
Anger started washing over him.
He looked like he hasn’t bathed in a week.
The smell from the Chinese food had filled the room and it made his mouth water but his stomach turn.
He shuffled his body around trying to get comfortable.
Currently John’s friend, his roommate, his detective is balancing himself on top of a stone wall surrounding a supposed suspects home.
John noticed Greg wince. His body tensed. As if he saw a blow coming and was bracing himself for it.
Greg was damned if he had to go back and ask John or Sherlock for the key. He’d just make a run for it.
“For vomit.” And tossed the clothes at Sherlock.
As soon as he got downstairs and left that suffocating room he was alone again.
Sherlock nervously moved around the room settling on the couch, drinking some water and then throwing the blanket over himself.
Were they in a relationship?
His eyes drift down to the rest of the items in his arms,
He was wearing dirty sweatpants with a shirt that looked even dirtier.  Thrown over that was his black coat. It looked out of place with his shabby clothes underneath.
Mycroft was quiet for a long time until he said "I understand that it is vital we keep this a secret, both for John's safety and your own. But what do you want me to do about it?"
"So, explain." Mycroft said, turning towards Sherlock.
John.
John Hamish Watson.
He slammed the door behind him as soon as Mycroft stepped outside. He started pacing  around the living room, thinking.
Hope you like it <3
And when he thought about it, he did remember. He actually remembered it very clearly. Mary had kidnapped him on Moriarty's orders and he had been held hostage for weeks until Sherlock had been stupid enough to show up. Then Mary had stabbed him. He didn't say all of this, of course. He just nodded, squeezing Sherlock's hand.
Quite a short one but oh well.
He tried to concentrate but the hunger was makimg it hard. They hadn't given him anything what so ever, barely even water.
"Hi again, you know the deal by now. Finish my task and I will set the girl free. And you will at the same time be closer to find your 'live in one'"
"I have a new puzzle for you. I'm guessing you remember the last one. The one where I promised to burn the heart out of you, this time, I will succeed." Sherlock didn't breathe. He sat there, mind suddenly completely blank. When the boy spoke again, he felt the panic fill his veins once more.
This is the first fic and the first real story that I am writing and publishing ever, so thank you for all of the kudos and comments. You are all fantastic!
"Now, this is what's going to happen. I am going to destroy you, Sherlock. I am going to take the only person you've ever cared about and make you watch when I kill him. Or rather, when Mary kills him, legwork you know." he said, his eyes never leaving Sherlock.
I will make up for it at some point.
John hummed and only broke the kiss to wisper "I'll take that as a thank you then." before he leaned back in.
"Missing?! You have an outrageous amount of CCTV cameras all over London and someone goes missing?!"
Sherlock recieves the 2nd task and has to face the threat of the deamons from his past.
When they were both standing, Sherlock had carefully put his arms around him. It had taken a while for John to react but eventually he had leaned into the touch and fisted his hands in his friend's soft dressing gown. He had buried his face in the crook of Sherlock’s neck and just breathed.
But what if it was Mary. Would she really hurt John like that? Was she forced to? By who?
He forced himself to get up and went to check the pink phone. There was a message containing an adress and a time, nothing else. He felt his heart beating faster, almost trying to punch itself out of his chest.
He felt his face heat up and he closed his eyes. Not able to meet Johns. He didn't want to hear it, John trying to let him down easily. He would break. John was going to leave now. He had scared him away and he was going to disappear and it was all Sherlock's fault. He had destroyed everything.
He looked away from John and did as he said. Inside it was a key. No special key, just an ordinary looking, boring key. But when he looked back at John for answers, all he found was that beautiful smile. The one that made his eyes sparkle and his nose crinkle and he found himself wanting to kiss that smile. But when he raised his eyebrows John finally spoke.
The whole argument had been stupid anyway. John had come home from the clinic finding Sherlock focused on dissecting an octopus. Ink was smeared on the table and when he found three other octopuses in the fridge (one which had fallen victim to the torch) he lost it.
It scared the hell out of him, now that there was only one call left to receive and one more task to complete. How it would end he didn't know, but he knew he couldn’t follow Moriarty's rules this time. If he did, John would suffer for it. He was his heart after all.
A huge thank you to all of the people leaving kudos and commenting.
He took a few steps towards his friend, crouching in front of him. John seemed to recoil at the sound, not yet noticing Sherlock.
"Shut up! Don't talk!" Sherlock said, adding more pressure and simultaneously making John gasp for breath. He was hurting him, but that couldn't be helped. He needed to keep as much blood as possible inside John.
They spent the majority of the afternoon making arrangements. Making mistakes was a big no, hence why they went through everything multiple times. Only a carefully selected few of Mycroft's puppets were allowed to know about the rescue mission, and neither knew the whole picture. Everything to stop future mistakes.
Mrs. Hudson was in a splendid mood. She hummed, baked and cleaned ("I'm not your houskeeper though!").
He stared for a long time, then he stared a bit more. Words failed him as he repetedly opened and closed his mouth, only managing to utter a few syllables.
When he felt a little bit better he walked back into the living room to make some tea.
John hadn't left. He had picked up his stuff from the other flat a few days later and returned home.
It was somewhere between a scream and a sob. His body was folding itself over and crumbled to the floor as soon as Mary let go of him.
It was Mary.
"Excuse me?"
"Do you think.. I mean would it be okay if.. I just.."
Well, it could very well be Mary behind this. She had looked devastated when John had found out about her shooting Sherlock. And she had looked equally devastated when he had received the paternity test.
Then it hit him. Mary was assigned to him to hurt Sherlock, they kidnapped him to hurt Sherlock, what is to say that they wouldn't hurt him physically to hurt Sherlock? Remake the torture they put Sherlock through but make him watch someone else get beaten?
He called Lestrade, was picked up and left the station before questions could be asked.
Enjoy<3
"Hello?" he said, feeling incredibly stupid. When no answer came he walked the small distance to the edge of the pool. The strong smell of chlorine filled his nostrils.
Moriarty was dead, right? Though he hadn't checked his pulse.
Sherlock pushed up against him, needing as much contact as possible. He needed to show how grateful he was, how much he loved the man in front if him. To claim him and be claimed in return.
The bed was made with military precision and the only folds present were the ones Sherlock had made whem sitting on it.
A quick trigger warning, some mild torture in this one, not grusome but I figured I should warn you anyway.
"What else should I have done?! Nothing? Should I have left you there, knowing I could save you? Do you really think I could live with that?" He hadn't meant to say all of that. It just sort of came tumbling out.
He took it in his hand and turned it over. Almost identical to the phone Moriarty sent him all those years ago. His hand was trembling now, no scratch that. All of him was trembling. He felt dizzy and he vaguely registered walking back to his chair and sitting in it. The rising feeling of panic did nothing to improve the situation.
"Don't even try it, doctor." he said with a cold laugh that didn't quite reach his eyes. With a snapping of his fingers, two muscular people walked towards him, lifted him up by his forearms and pulled the rest of the rope away from his hands. When they pressed him up against the wall he grunted in pain.
-----
They rose from the sofa and while John changed upstairs, Sherlock did the same in his room. He normally didn't sleep in clothes, but he dressed in a t-shirt and trousers anyway.
When he looked back at it now, he envied his younger self. The naive, happy little boy he had been. And what a mess he had become. The drugs he had started with in university hadn't exactly helped.
Now he went to his laptop, opened it with unnecessary force and checked his emails while desperately trying to push down the rising feeling of worry (and failing). When nothing interesting was found he slammed it shut and sat in his chair.
'No!' he couldn't fall into the deep pit of sentiment now. He had to do this, it was the only way.
He thought about the time he had had with Redbeard. About his 8th birthday when his parents gave him the little puppy. He had started school. Nobody liked him. He didn't really care, they were idiots anyway.
John hadn't cried, he hadn't talked and he hadn't moved. When Sherlock stopped, John was still sitting there. He had obviously deduced it immediately. But he hadn't asked, hadn't questioned and John would be forever grateful for that.
"Well, that wasn't so hard was it? He is on his way." and with that, the call ended. Thankful that he was still wearing gloves he went out, threw the gun I the pool in pure frustration and went outside to greet the boy. Damn.
When he entered the flat and checked the time, it was 23.45 and Mycroft had called him 12 times. He had probably seen the CCTV cameras and come to the conclusion that Sherlock was currently high. He wrote an explanation (saying it was for a case and that he hadn't actually taken anything) though he didn't have high hopes to be rid of his brother just yet.
Or it was someone who wanted to hurt Sherlock, well if that was it they were definitely succeeding.
Mary (or whatever her real name was) was standing in front of him. Her hair was still blonde, a bit longer though, and she was wearing her usual red coat. She had a chilling smile on her lips, a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes.
Hello people!
John's head turned towards him and his impossibly blue eyes stared at him in disbelief. Sherlock half walked, half dragged himself closer, holding a hand out. John reached out with a shaking arm and took it, releasing a quick (and apparently, held) breath.
And he was right, not even 10 minutes later, his brother walked into the flat with a strained, but anxious expression on his face.
A knife was pressed to John's throat, making Sherlock wince.
He spent a considerable amount of time lost in memories of John, something he did frequently these days, and didn't notice Ms Hudson trying to talk to him or Mycroft calling him.
"Stop thinking. You can have whatever you want, just ask." he said. Maybe to calm Sherlock's pounding heart and even if that wasn't his intention, it was working He started to doze off but woke quickly when John shifted.
"Can I sleep in your room tonight? Just sleep?"
He nodded, not yet trusting his own voice. But John smiled and asked "Can I.. Eh, can I kiss you?".
"Will you look at that. He's awake!" The last sentence was almost sung and he felt a rush of fear as he realised who that sing-song voice belonged to. At the same time, the man in question stepped into the middle of the room. Dressed in a slim, black suit and white button-down with the black hair combed backwards he looked identical to the last time John had seen him all dressed up. But the eyes, they seemed to have sunk into his head and it made him look even crazier.
It could be an enemy of John’s. Someone from before or someone that Sherlock had made him. Either way, it didn't look good if that was the case.
What if he had done something wrong? What if John would get hurt because of him?
A phone. A pink phone.
Just like last time, constructive feedback is welcomed!
'Okay, be logical about this! Moriarty shot himself in the head. No curtains for others to stand behind, no second gun to fire in the floor. No need to worry.'
The smile on his lips lingered as he tried to find a comfortable position to sleep, and when he woke up, it was still there.
"Good, go into the men's dressing room." He did and what met him was something he definitely hadn't expected. A red dog. A puppy really. It looked exactly like Redbeard. A pang of longing struck him. The dog was tied to one of the benches and was trying to run towards him. Then the boy spoke again.
It felt strangely intimate, sitting in John's room alone, surrounded by John's things and scent. Mycroft had called and texted approximately 35 times since the incident yesterday (which hadn't actrually been an incident) and he had ignored them all. He knew that Mycroft would storm into the flat anytime now, so he got up and reluctantly walked away from John's room.
Inside the yellow envelope was something that made his blood freeze to ice in his veins, his stomach flip and his heart pound at the same time.
So the years went by and he practically threw himself into his books. He spent hours upon hours in the library bent over whichever book had caught his eye. He refined his deduction skills, practicing every time he looked at someone. If he couldn’t help being bullied, he would absolutely have something to throw back at them.
Lestrade sighed after a moment, when no more information came forward. “How do you know?”
…except…
The tour guide spoke and eventually led the group away, but Sherlock didn’t move. John didn’t mind.
Lestrade let out a breath. “Alright then. I’ll let you know what we’ve found when we find it.”
“Do you now?” John raised an eyebrow back, smug expression not faltering a bit. “Care to clue me in?”
Sherlock wakes John up at 2:15 am. John looks at the figure in his doorway - shaking, haunted - and pulls back his duvet. Sherlock's heart stutters, and he's curled up under the covers in seconds. He swallows, trying to still the small tremors under his skin that won't stop. John reaches out, calloused fingers grazing his arm, and suddenly it's a little easier to breathe.
He had never realized, however, that Sherlock was in love with it, too.
Sherlock only hmmphed, glaring at the back of their guide’s head as she turned to lead them onward. John just shook his head and followed. If it hadn’t been for the fact that they were currently on a bee farm (he could practically hear Sherlock shouting in his mind:
Sherlock doesn't answer, eyes unfocused. He'd never said it out loud before. He hadn't meant to just then. But it's true, and the sentence just seems to revolve around in his head. It won't stop. Around and around and around. Is there even any of him left?
“How did she even
He ran his hand through his hair in frustration and guilt. He had set out to buy one perfect present and had ended up with ten decidedly imperfect ones. Every time he’d bought something, he’d second-guessed himself not a minute later.
“It’s red for the season - not uncommon. But it would have been exceedingly easy to find a tie containing both red and green, and easier still to find it on sale, which would have appealed to him. He couldn’t, however, because the studio green screen behind him would have picked up the colour and half of his tie would have disappeared.”
He hardly thought it fair, though. Honestly, according to John, it wasn’t
It wasn’t hard for John to draw parallels. He knew Sherlock had had a lonely life, that he didn’t let people in easily or at all even now because of it. He wished he’d been there then, that they’d met as kids. He knew he couldn’t change that. He knew that. It was in the past. But…perhaps he could change what he’d been dancing around for the majority of their friendship. He looked back at the field, and it wasn’t long before he had come to a decision.
Sherlock blinked back into the present to see John’s face shadowed with concern.
There was tinsel in Sherlock’s hair and a peaceful look on his face. John’s arm was curled solidly around his waist, and Sherlock’s weight had fallen fully against him, complacent in the embrace. A soft smile spread across Mrs. Hudson’s face, and she looked at them both happily, knowing they must have fallen asleep together late the night before. She had waited for the two of them to stop dancing around each other for so many years - through cases and close calls, deaths and weddings, uncertainty and bravado. For so long and in so many ways Sherlock and John had loved each other quietly…everyone had seen it except for the two that actually mattered…and it seemed that last night it had finally been spoken.
Lloyd turned so fast Lestrade saw only a blur before the  image of the man grasping John’s right arm came into focus.
“He may not need us at his back Mr.  Artisian,” Mycroft said while Greg flexed his claws beside him,  “but he most definitely has us.”
“Yeah bit late for that,” Lestrade answered with a wry  grimace. “I know where they are.”
“Come back to me John.” Lloyd’s  voice whispered inside him as the mark glowed bright once again.
He came upon a narrow stairway and threw himself into the  face of an acolyte who yelled and tumbled backwards hitting the floor below  with a resounding crack. Lestrade landed on the man’s chest then jumped off and  continued down the next set of stairs.
The man beamed as if John had bestowed a great compliment.  “Keeping up with your old man then Johnny boy? I’m flattered.”
Soon Lloyd’s hands were free and he was sitting up and  rubbing his wrists. “Where did you learn to do that?”
The wolverine curled up snug and secure within the grip of  his dragon and allowed the familiar beating of powerful wings to lull him into  a dreamless sleep.
Lloyd shrugged and gave a tip of an imaginary hat as he  followed his son out into the hall. Lestrade sighed and hurried to catch up with  them.
“Don’t be ridiculous John.”  Sherlock took John’s hand and led him down the aisle. “It’s a  royal wedding and coronation. Mycroft would never pass up the chance  to show off his prize to the best of his ability.”
“That’s not even close to your real name.” John snarled,  taking a step forward as Sherlock snagged his wrist and held him in place. John  angrily shook his arm free but stayed his ground.
“I don’t –“ Lestrade whispered but was interrupted by a low,  rumbling laughter that grew in volume until the courtyard rang with the smarmy  syllables of it.
John sighed and leaned into  Sherlock’s chest. “I have a bad feeling about this.”
“Christ John cut me some slack.” Lloyd leaned his head back and  pinched the bridge of his nose. “It’s not like your mother was a poster child  for humanity either.”
“Don’t let that fool you.” John placed his hand on the glass  and Lloyd turned his head and smiled as if he knew his son was there. John  pulled his hand back and wiped it on his trousers with a disgusted look. “He’s  dangerous Lestrade. Be careful in there.”
Lloyd rounded on John throwing up his hands. “Hey I took you  to those movies Johnny boy and as I recall you loved them!”
Sherlock’s frantic pacing slowed and he whirled on his brother.  “Not if I get to him first!”
Mycroft surveyed the soft grey fox scampering between his  feet with a fond smile and chuckled.  “As  always my dear I shall follow wherever you lead.”
Sherlock gave a decisive nod and stalked over to Lestrade’s  desk. He wrenched a drawer completely out of the frame and upended its contents  onto the floor. Smirking in triumph he grabbed a yellow pad of lined paper and  a pen and tossed them into the exasperated man’s lap.
“Enough!” Lestrade slipped a pair of handcuffs from the  pocket of his coat and secured Lloyd’s hands behind his back. “I’ve suddenly  decided you’re less witness and more suspect Mr. Artisian or whatever you  choose to call yourself these days so you’ll be coming with me.”
Greg narrowed his eyes and  deliberately did not open his mouth. “I don’t remember hearing  anything about how this bonding was going to mean I had to listen to  you inside my head.”
John barked a laugh. “Possessive  git! You don’t own me!”
“John, it was safer that way.” Lloyd dropped down to sit on  his heels and dragged his fingers through the dirt on the floor.  “You think I wanted my enemies coming after my  fey kid? If you were human you weren’t worth bothering with.”
Mycroft merely raised a regal  eyebrow but John wondered if he’d detected a hint of  fondness in  the powerful dragon’s eyes. Then he realized all eyes were on him.  He bowed his head, looking up through his lashes. “Um, right. I,  Doctor John Watson, chosen hand of the house of Jaguar, sworn  protector of, uh, his royal highness, the prince of Dragon, do,  solemnly swear my oath and fealty to Mycroft Holmes and support his  right to the throne of the Old Ones. Oh, and Greg too. Right.”
“I don’t care what your grand plans  are,” John replied his lips thinning into a grim line, “I don’t  want to know how you justify what you did to my mother or to me. You  are nothing to me.”
“I -.”
“Sherlock ...” John began,  troubled, but was silenced by a kiss. There was no further discussion  for a very long time.
John shivered restlessly in his  sleep, and dreamed he stood on the peak of a snow covered mountain.  Lloyd moved next to him, brushing something from the front of his  blood red suit. He nodded at John and grinned with sharp teeth  pointing out the valley below. At their feet lay the vast maze of a  city, tiny figures scurrying within its walls. John’s focus  sharpened and as he gazed deeper he zeroed in on Sherlock, Mycroft  and Greg preparing for the day. His father murmured into his ear;  praising him, adoring him, pleading with him to save the  world, to  rise, to wake, to embrace his destiny. John was a warrior and a  caretaker. Who better to lead the fey into a brighter future? What  were Mycroft’s qualifications? A petty bureaucrat? Wouldn’t he  and the inspector have a better relationship without the  responsibility of ruling? Wouldn’t Sherlock be happier with a man  who could give him whatever he wanted, unlimited access to all he  desired? John wasn’t his father’s mistake, he was his carefully  crafted masterpiece. This was what he was born to be.
“Hello Johnny boy. Fancy meeting you here. Didn’t know you  were the type to hang out with dragons.”
Greg stepped forward placing himself between the two men  while sincerely regretting his life choices.
“Nice to know you’re good for something,” Lestrade sniped  and Lloyd huffed. John couldn’t help the giggle that rose up from the  disgruntled look on his father’s face.
John laughed. “War-Marriage, in my experience it’s  practically the same thing.”
He reached for a glass but took only  a single sip before his arm was tugged away. He turned to find a  small, anxious looking man with a pair of rimless glasses perched on  the end of his sharp nose and a measuring tape looped around his  neck. The man plucked at John’s sleeve, shaking his head. “Tsk!  Those trousers, that shirt and oh dear gods the tie! This will never  do! Hurry, please sir, I didn’t realize we’d be starting from  scratch and we have so little time!”
Sherlock recoiled as if slapped, his mouth puckering into  the sourest expression John had ever seen.
“Stop being such an  ass!” John’s answering whisper was magnified by the acoustics of  the space, bouncing back at them as if murmured by a hundred voices.  John sighed. “This is your brother’s wedding, though the gods  only know what Greg is thinking. Regardless, that pompous git is your  brother, and you are his best man and Greg is our friend and you will  stand up there and witness their unholy union or so help me I will  punch you both in the face!”
The trio dodged the scattered debris and groaning men in  tattered robes that littered the way as they emerged into the courtyard. The  dragons were surrounded by a diminishing army of acolytes most of whom were so  busy trying not to get bitten, clawed or stomped on that they weren’t exactly  mounting an impressive defense.
Mycroft stood and gazed at Lestrade with a worried frown. “Gregory  you are wounded. Perhaps you should stay behind…”
“We are the Followers of the Mark.” The three robed figures  appeared to grow and shift into half shadow as they arranged themselves around Lloyd  and John.
John took pity. “We get it Greg, no baiting the forensic  team or borrowing evidence, dragon’s honor, right Sherlock?” He favored  Sherlock with a pleading wide-eyed look as his tongue darted out to lick at his  lips.
Maybe he had pulled a Ricoletti and faked it. Sherlock had suspected that since he solved the Ricoletti case on the plane. He hadn't told John though. He didn't want to worry him
There was too much space between them for his liking, but maybe that was how John wanted it? He was too shy and nervous to ask or move closer. John seemed to notice that something was wrong so he inched closer and pulled Sherlock towards him, his head on John's chest.
Sorry for the wait! It's been a busy week.
But before Sherlock could ask, the doo swung up and both Mary and Moriarty were standing in front of them.
'What the hell did she mean?'
"Are we going to Angelo's?" he asked. Turning to John. He just smiled and squeezed their joined hands. Sherlock returned the gestures and kept looking at John. His John. He had a feeling that today might even get a tiny bit better, if possible.
His John.
"You got an easy one last time. I asure you this will be more challenging. I will send you a picture, just figure out where to go and I will call you when you get there." the girl continued. The call ended before he had uttered a single syllable. He slowly lowered the phone, images of a hurt John still flashing in his mind.
The conversations flowed with ease and he found himself thinking that he didn't want to spend the rest of his life with anyone else. Before, he thought that he might survive for a few years before an overdose (accidental or intentional) claimed his life. He hadn't thought much about growing old. But when they were old, maybe John would like to move to Sussex. Maybe to keep bees. He made a mental note to ask him some day.
Without knowing how he got there, he found himself in John's bedroom.
He slammed the door behind him. The case had been dreadfully boring and Anderson had been more stupid than usual. He was irritated and disappointed and the prospect of having to celebrate his birthday only made it worse. So it was with heavy steps that he entered the flat.
'By hurting John of course, you idiot.'
When Sherlock had put the violin away, he had taken the cup of cold tea from John’s hands and reached a hand out for John to take. John had been puzzled but Sherlock had seemed confident and he really hadn't had the energy to care.
That's when he got a phone call. On the pink phone. When he picked up it was the little boy again.
'How the hell did 3 hours pass so quickly??' He made a note in his head to keep better track of time in his mindpalace when Mrs Hudson knocked on the door with a thick envelope. He took it without a word.
This day, she had locked all doors in an attempt to keep Sherlock out. This day, you see, was not any other day. It was Sherlock's birthday. He had tried to ignore it, but John had asked their landlady to bake some gingernuts (one of Sherlock's personal favourites) and try to keep it hidden from him. She had shone up at his words and started immediately.
A fluffy epilogue about Sherlock's birthday.
John. The brutal pain had been numbed by Jack's joy and replaced by a more managable longig but now it came back. If Moriarty's first task had been to shoot an innocent animal that brought up awful memories from his past, what on earth could the next two be.
But honestly, he didn't want to talk about what had happened. John had quickly realised and stopped asking but he knew that they had to talk about it at some point. Their friendship had endured a lot, but miscommunication could very well be the end of it. It nearly had been on multiple occasions.
Moriarty was going to destroy him. And Sherlock would let him, if it kept John alive.
This is quite an angsty one, but far milder than what I have planned for later. It's also quite short, but I hope you won't mind too much.
(See the end of the chapter for
Moriarty's plan is about to reach its peak.
He opened the door which swung up on creaky hinges and was met by a dimly lit hall.
"Sher... What.. what are you doing here??" he stuttered, sounding angrier and angrier. "You are going to get us both killed!"
He turned to escape to his room when he was stopped by a hand on his arm.
'John doesn't have to find out.' he thought. He wanted to phone Mycroft, but he wasn't going to. He went to Mycroft today, leading to John being tortured by the looks of it. He grabbed his hair and pulled hard, trying to numb the emotional pain as well as stopping the tears that were welling up in his eyes.
Said John was growing paler every second. His hands were clutched in Sherlock's sleeves and he was trying to say something.
A few blocks from Angelo's, Sherlock's face lit up with understanding and joy as he figured it out.
(I did put some things from s4 in here. Gingernust for example, but only because I found it adorable)
He went upstairs and retrieved the present he had hidden and placed it in Sherlock's chair just as he heard the door open.
He was sprawled on what looked like a concrete floor, shirtless. On his chest, just above his heart, there was a burn. It was a bit hard to see in the slightly blurry picture but it was definitely a burn (He had seen enough pictures of burns in his lifetime to recognise it). His hair was covered in blood, making his stomach turn, and a mark on his throat looked like a bruise after being strangled. Furthermore, he looked way too thin and he wondered if they had been trying to starve him.
John gave the cabbie a note with the adress (to make sure that Sherlock wouldn't figure out their destination just yet) which earned him an angry and intrigued look from Sherlock.
"Spit it out John." he said with a touch (or maybe a heap) of fondness, trying desperatly to conceal his nervousness.
When he looked at the chair opposite of his, he felt his chest clench. Closing his eyes helped a bit so he did that, then he placed his hands underneath his chin and went into his mind palace.
Mary is back and John recieves some interesting information.
A tiny, seemingly harmless word when out of context. But it struck him like lighting when Mycroft spoke the words "John Watson is" in front of it.
Sherlock didn't know what to say so he just smiled back at John, pulled him towards himself and crushed their lips together.
Well, the first year of school had been okay. He had even enjoyed it. He had found a friend, her name was Sofie, and she wasn't as stupid as all the others. But after a while he managed to hurt her. She had run of to the teachers, crying. After that she barely talked to him if it wasn't to insult him.
His hair was messy, he had bags under his eyes and he looked like he could fall asleep anywhere. His eyes shone with concern and his hand had yet again found John's.
The thought of that conversation always made Sherlock see red. She didn't deserve John, not even a little bit. But John seemed to love her so Sherlock hadn't tried to destroy it (like he had with John’s past girlfriends). He wanted John to be happy.
He was starting to panic again when he joined the real world. He thought about Moriarty and his threat at the pool. "I'll burn the heart out of you." Even after all these years the words haunted him. Ringing in his ears every time he gave in. Gave in to the feelings he so closely guarded.
Sometime in the middle of the night, Sherlock woke up from a nightmare. But John just hugged him to his chest, stroke his head and lulled him back to sleep.
"Of course you can." he answered, smiling up at John.
He had loved her. He really had. But he knew the moment he saw the bottle of Claire de la lune and understood its meaning. He knew that their marriage was over. He would have left her right there. Make Mycroft deal with the papers and moved out as soon as possible.
He toweled himself off, went into his bedroom and collapsed on the bed. He wrapped himself in his cover and was soon asleep after days of being awake. The exhaustion and sadness at last claiming him.
Somewhere in the flat, a phone rang. He rose from the sofa and checked his own. It wasn't ringing. That's when it struck him. The pink phone!
John helped though. He made Sherlock want to be better. Actually want to. Because with John, Sherlock had a friend, a supporter, a helping hand. That and all the other things he valued John for. He had someone who he wanted to impress, someone to live for.
When the text alert sounded, he clicked on the image. It was of a darkened alley. a single streetlight emitted a warm, yellow light that shone on a few crates and a blue door. There was a graffiti on the door, he zoomed in to see it better and when he did, his breath stuck in his throat. In bold, black letters, the word "Freak" was scribbled.
"Okay?" John asked, looking uncertain. He immediately decided that he would rid him of that expression as quickly as possible. By kissing him.
"Thank you." he said, waiting patiently (or, not very) for John to swallow before kissing him again.
When he entered the flat, he instantly felt that something was wrong. It was cold, probably an open window. But the strange thing was that he closed the window he had opened while smoking (please forgive me, John) and no other windows had been opened.
This was all his fault. If he hadn't made John angry yesterday he wouldn't have walked out of the flat. Then he wouldn't have dissappeared. Stupid! He knew John’s ways of dealing with anger. Go out, take a walk, come back.
When Lestrade had picked them up and driven them to the station, Jack thanked Sherlock (so did his parents), hugged him and hopped into his parents car. Before Lestrade could ask Sherlock anything he walked out and got into a cab. He didn't have time to explain, and what if something happened to John if he went to the police?
So he closed his eyes and lost himself in memories. Him and Sherlock leaning on each other while catching their breaths after a case, the sparkle in his eyes (god, those gorgeous eyes) when they laughed.
"I am playing another little game with Sherlock. You are a part of it, just like last time. Won't that be fun?" he said. John forced himself to open his eyes and look straight into Moriarty's despite the pain in his head. He tried to show him all of the hate and disgust he felt in one single look, not knowing if he succeeded or not.
Sherlock had always been avoiding emotions. Not that it was a good thing but he had always done it. But as they got closer, John noticed how the carefully built walls started to fade. He had had the privilege to get to know Sherlock. Not just the Sherlock that the public knew, but the real Sherlock. The Sherlock who played the violin at 3 in the morning when John had nightmares in order to wake him up, the Sherlock who made tea, bought groceries and cleaned the fridge when he knew John had had a bad day. The Sherlock who giggled with him in inappropriate places and about inappropriate things. The Sherlock who's mouth turned into an adorable V-shaped smile lined with pride when he made John laugh.
"Hello." It was a little boy that spoke. He couldn’t be older than 8 and his voice was shaking. The familiarity sent chills down his spine and 221B suddenly felt very lonely.
Sherlock was beside him instantly. He ripped of his scarf and pressed it to the wound.
The ride went by in a blur and he actively ignored Mycroft's attempts at contacting him. He wouldn't risk it this time, his own safety be damned. This was stupid and he knew it, going there without backup.
Sherlock would come for him, he knew that much. But he had walked out though. He hadn't said when he would be back. Sherlock was probably more hurt than he would ever admit right now. He mentally punched himself and tried to remind himself to be more careful with Sherlock.
When Mary shifted again, he braced himself. He caught John's eyes, pouring all of his love and regret into that look (not giving a damn if anyone notices) and not expecting the response he got. John looked at him like he had at the pool all those years ago. But there was something else. He couldn't pinpoint what it was and was interrupted by the horrible sound John made.
'How had he survived?? He shot himself in the head!'
"Well, I believe that can be arranged."
He hadn't eaten properly in 3 days. He had barely slept. He often found himself trying to remember John. How he looked in the morning, dressed in comfy pjs and messy hair, how he looked when Sherlock complemented him, his eyes full of pride and adoration, how he looked after a chase through London, with adrenalin rushing and joy in his eyes.
They walked up the stairs of 221B together, Sherlock was supporting most of John's weight. John had been angry with him and he wasn't sure why. He had saved his life for Christ's sake.
"I wondered how long it would take before you figured it out. Mrs. Hudson baked some while you were away. They're in the kitchen."
He didn't know what to answer, so he kept quiet. In the middle of all of the fear and confusion, somewhere in his chest, a hope was born. A hope he had lost when Sherlock had jumped, a hope that seemed to far away to reach when he married Mary and a hope that had tried to come back when he moved back to Bakerstreet. The warmth in his chest grew, but it wasn't strong enough to push the fear away.
John was missing, kidnapped and held hostage by Moriarty himself. Sherlock was going to do anything to get his John back, he had already forced himself to shoot a dog. A dog that looked exactly like Readbeard. It had been painful, but it was going to be worth it. That's what he kept telling himself anyway. Whatever he had to do, it would be worth it for John.
The door had been opened again and he was expecting Moriarty again. But no, it wasn't Moriarty.
He nodded again, feeling very stupid. But in a few seconds, that didn't matter what so ever because John's lips were on his and he tasted like salt and happiness and everything good in the world.
"Hello Mr Holmes." the person on the other end of the line said. It was a young girl this time. Probably about 8, like the boy in the last task.
What? Was that it? John's anger had been directed at Sherlock's want to protect John? At his carelessness trying to do so? He opened his mouth and closed it again. Not sure how to respond.
"Bees." Damn, he wasn't supposed to say it now. Oh well.
But John moved away, grabbed Sherlock's hand and moved them to the sofa. They talked for a long time. About the case, about old cases, about Sherlock's hate for his own birthday. And Sherlock told him about his 8th birthday when he got Readbeard and about his 13th birthday when he was taken away from him.
“What?” he asked, a small pucker developing between his eyebrows.
(See the end of the chapter for
He hadn't thought it would hurt so much. His return. He certainly hadn't thought it would hurt as much as two years of solitude and detachment and pain. But then again, he hadn't counted on John Watson maintaining his distance. He hadn't counted on the rage and the hurt in John's eyes. He hadn't counted on Baker Street being empty, completely empty.
Sherlock's hands tightened in his hair, and John winced at the sight of it. Brow furrowed, he moved over to the window, setting his half-drunk mug of tea on the desk next to Sherlock's untouched one before settling behind Sherlock's hunched form. He pressed his cheek against Sherlock's neck, warm fingers moving up Sherlock's arm and across his chest to tuck themselves just under the collar of his shirt, his other arm wrapping around Sherlock's middle and squeezing. God, he was so tense he was practically vibrating. He breathed against the nape of Sherlock's neck and felt rather than heard the weighty sigh escape Sherlock's mouth.
“Any idea what you’re going to name him?”
Sherlock watched John intently in a last ditch effort to try to deduce what he hadn’t been able to for weeks. Every year he’d been able to figure out what John had gotten him for Christmas. Even on their first Christmas together in that flat - before they’d started going out, before they had gotten married, before they'd ever had any intimate relationship to speak of - he'd figured it out in advance, and though it was a foregone conclusion, every year John had tried to keep it from him. This year, however, he hadn’t a clue what the gift was. And from the smug look John had been giving him all week, he knew full well that Sherlock didn’t know.
Sherlock blinked, looking up, and John’s grin grew. “Mrs Hudson!”
Sherlock rolls into John's waiting arms and finds his pulse point. He can feel the warmth bleeding through John's shirt, can feel John's heart beating under his fingers. This is John. This is real. This is real.

“Hands out.”

The tour guide was an idiot, apparently. But that was according to Sherlock so John wasn’t sure how much stock to put into it.
"I'm not asking you to stop. I'm not asking you to pause," he said softly, carefully. "I'm asking you to take a breath...and come lie down with me." The fingers beneath his chin slid to join the rest of his hand in cupping his cheek.
“Well…” Sherlock conceded, eyes dancing.
“I really can’t help it though.” He pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s neck. “I have a very bad influence around me all the time.”
“Are you sure you don’t want to opt for Billy Bones, then?” John asked with a laugh, helping the pup up onto his lap only to watch him wriggle off once more.
“Oh, I was obsessed with the book as a child,” he said fondly, putting Hawkins on the floor and watching him try to climb into John’s lap without falling over. “I might have driven Mycroft mad. He would never play the parts I wanted him to.”
“He was a meteorologist,” Sherlock answered, taking his magnifier out and scrutinizing the entry wound.
Everything was too much. The lights, the darkness, the sounds, the silence, the touch of furniture and the lack of touch.
He didn't have much more time until the cab stopped. He threw the cabbie some money and dashed out. The doors were unlocked.
But Sherlock got nervous again. He really wanted John to stay in his room, but if John wanted to keep sleeping upstairs he wouldn't want to hear the question. But he didn't have to ask, John did that for him.
Despite her past she seemed to love John. It wasn't a healthy love though. It was selfish. She had said it herself. She would do anything to keep John from leaving.
Their relationship had been growing slowly but steadily. Trust had been rebuilt and enforced and the intimacy was easier.
"I sure can. But first, we are taking you to your parents. They are waiting at the police station." While waiting he talked to Jack about school, friends, hobbies and everything else that went through the mind of an 8 year old. He found himself enjoying it. Jack didn't think that Sherlock was strange or a freak. He just talked. The boy's eyes were deep blue and combined with the light hair he closely resembled John. That pang of longing struck him again and he couldn’t let go of the thought that Moriarty had chosen him for that specific reason.
Greg really doesn’t want to see that happen. He likes the kid.
"Just like the old days" he rasped out in a deep seductive voice.
What the hell is he laughing at?
Greg was taken aback. “What! No! you ridiculous kid. Jesus!”
“I’m not a kid!”
Greg looked at him and saw vulnerability in his eyes and his youth. He knew what taking this away from him would do to him. He would probably find him in an alley dead from an overdose within the week.
“It’s no problem at all Doctor.” Her voice drops an octave at “Doctor”.
He immediately bucked up his hips and grabbed Sherlock's arm. Flipping them so Sherlock was on his back and Lestrade hovered over him.
John looks up at her with a grin.
Sherlock let out another deep rumbling chuckle.
“If you can go out and do whatever you want and slag around with any pair of breast that bat their eyes at you then I can do whatever
John leaned in slightly, his eyes twinkling. “Good to know.”
He needs something to do. Something to keep him busy.
He pulled the mop bucket from under the kitchen sink and set it down next to the couch.
The silence was deafening. The pressure of it was crushing his head.
Sherlock couldn’t read it and a bit of fear started to trickle in.
The bed dipped and he swung his other leg over to the other side.
Sherlock started walking forward pulling John and Greg with him.
He shot up from the couch and opened a water bottle.
“Yep.”
Sherlock sat up and leaned forward, resting his face on the drivers seat next to Greg’s head.
Sherlock just nodded.
Lestrade grabbed Sherlock's wrist and slammed it above his head
“For one...” he continued, rolling his hips again “I would be so hard anymore. Let me say thank you.”  he rasped out seductively.
He felt so nauseous, he threw up while he was in there.
Shrugging his tiny shoulders, he manages to murmur out that he doesn’t care.
Greg face was burning up again.
The room suddenly felt too small and he couldn't stop his hand from shaking. Beads of sweat started collecting on his forehead.
Greg had actually stopped worrying about anyone finding out.
Yes. he was originally opposed to staying with Lestrade and getting clean but a large part of him was so tired of it all and wanted to give it up.
“You gave me such a fright Inspector. Beating down the door like that. You’ll give an old woman like me a heart attack.”
He felt like punching someone. He felt like throwing something.
The nurse winks at John, throws a glance at Sherlock and leaves. Sherlock glares at her as she walks away.
They were finally able to maneuver him up the stairs without any further outburst.
“I’ve fallen asleep on it a few times and its actually really comfortable.”
Sherlock jumped at Lestrade’s words.
Sherlock jerked his head up.
The shirt he was wearing was already damp with sweat.
He felt like choking Greg until the light left his eyes.
His body was twitching all over and his head hurt.
Sherlock shuffled alongside of Greg, losing his balance a few times, where Greg ended up having to grab onto his elbow. To lead him to the taxi.
He had to ease himself in carefully. And keep his arm outside of the water.
His shirt was soaking wet now.
He tried to shake it away and left the bathroom.
"Don’t touch anything or go through my things please.” He orders as he made his way down the hallway.
“What did I say about the staring?”
Lestrade seemed to understand that Sherlock wasn’t really in the mood for talking and just left him alone.
Greg came home as soon as he sat on the couch towel drying his hair.
When was the last time they did it?
She steps in a little closer and bites her lip at John.
He was grateful for him. Secretly.
He washed his hair using Greg’s surprisingly expensive shampoo and then carefully washed his arm
Then his footsteps as he pads up the stairs.
Sherlock has never commented on the fact that John was dating.
“Alright.”
“Are you just going to stand there and stare at me because its kind of creepy” he says looking at sherlock with a grin.
“I just meant to clean up until the drugs are out of your system so you can start working with us again. That is all.”
His words came out passionately and firmly. Eyes were wide and stern that bore into Sherlock's.
Sherlock jerks his head up and glares at John.
Sherlock mentally noted.
He started pacing the room running what happened back and forth in his head.
“Will you relax John?” he stage-whispered.
Eventually they pulled up in front of 221 Baker St.
Greg entered the living room and watched Sherlock scratch at his arm and curl into himself a bit.
So when tickets had gone on sale and tentative invitations had been voiced, they had gone together. And the stage, the costumes, the dancing, the music, the story - they were all amazing. But in the end, neither was sure if it was the ballet company or the company of each other that made that performance the best they’d ever seen.
“I’ve never seen him before,” Lestrade pointed out, eyebrow raised.
This one is shorter than usual, but I think it's one of my favourites. I'm a sucker for fluff.
The small smile he received when he handed Sherlock the full mug warmed him more than his drink ever could.
He closes his eyes.
Sherlock’s smile grew, and though he shook his head slightly at the randomness of dancing in a field full of beehives, he took John’s hand and allowed himself to be pulled in close.
“Of course he knew,” Sherlock said dismissively, looking intently at the victim’s finger nails.
Sherlock knew John would appreciate anything he got him…except perhaps another head in the fridge. No, John wasn’t picky, but that didn’t matter. Appreciation was one thing. But this gift..this entire Christmas…it was their first as a couple, and it had to be perfect.
“Obviously,” Sherlock replied, standing and dusting himself off. “Him too,” he nodded at their victim.
Sherlock swallowed, searching John's worried eyes. "Yes. Ok..." He murmured after a moment, the relief on John's face gratifying.
He thinks the silence is hardest to bear. He didn't used to mind it, but now it's deafening. There are times when it rakes across his mind and makes him doubt whether he’s home at all.
"One more time..." In. Together. And out. Together.
Morning came, as expected, but when she climbed up the stairs with a tray of tea in her hands and her curiosity in tow, the sight that greeted her wasn’t a singed fern. Nor was it a mess of spilled popcorn and broken glass. No, nothing like it…the sight that met Martha Hudson’s eyes was that of a strikingly ordinary tree, save for the skull staring down at her from the top, and Sherlock and John curled up, sound asleep on the sofa.
“What would you rather do?” John prodded, grinning up at him. “Build a snowman?”
"Yes?" John asked, fingers slowly moving, descending to his clavicle and back up again
“He looks just like…” Sherlock said softly, a smile making itself known.
at John and bidding them both good night. The delicate sound of an ornament breaking and John’s exasperated “Sherlock” followed her down the stairs, and she shook her head fondly.
The spots fade, and he's left in the dark once more.
If John leaves, he thinks he might shatter.
Perfect.
needs most is for John Watson to stay.
He should be happy. He has his life back now, everything neatly in place. Everything should be fine. Except now he can't sleep because he dreams. Loud noises startle him, and sometimes his mind grinds to a halt at the simplest of things. What he wants to delete won't go, and when it comes for him, it consumes everything. He doesn't feel like he's in his own skin anymore. Quite honestly, for a man who never died, he feels like a corpse.

"Let me hold you. Let me steady you. Maybe you'll think easier in my arms..." John searched his partner's eyes. "Please let me help. Please let me try." He paused seeing Sherlock waver. "For me, Sherlock..."
“None of which means he was a weather man,” John pointed out.
Sherlock paused. “Honeybees dance,” he settled on with a slight smile. “To communicate, they dance in patterns.”
“I don’t see why they’re so special, though,” Sherlock continued quietly. “Bee’s knees. Bees have segmented legs, yes, but that saying makes no sense. Knees are just fine I suppose, and bees are fascinating, but their knees aren’t the reason why. They-”
But then the bed dips down, and John is there, eyes warm and reassuring, his palm brushing softly against Sherlock’s own as he laces their fingers together. Sherlock swallows. After a moment of hesitation, he squeezes John’s hand. Something loosens in his chest when he feels John squeeze back.
“Many of my memories of bees are with Mycroft, actually,” Sherlock said after a minute. John glanced back up at his friend, a bit surprised. “He used to take me out to find different species of them…I was single-minded in my efforts, but he’d walk with me for hours just to find a single hive.”
Dark rooms. Familiar hands. Freezing, water, muffled laughter. Can't breathe. Can't breathe. Ca n't br eath e.
"This will always be here..." he murmured, feeling Sherlock relax further with each word, and knowing from experience that the cacophony inside his head would lessen just a bit with each shared breath. "I will always be there. You'll solve this case...the world will spin on...and we'll always come back to this...ok?"
30 pounds. Bought and wrapped.
Sherlock sighed, rolling them before he obliged. There was rustling off to his right as John went to fetch the present, and Sherlock sighed again, mentally kicking himself as he recognized the fireplace.
Things aren’t ok. But they’re better. They’re easier. And he’s not alone.
Sherlock’s groan could be heard across the park.
"Thank you..." John said, tone hushed. He pressed a gentle kiss to Sherlock's lips before taking his hand, squeezing, and starting towards the bedroom, towards the bed, towards the possibility of his detective getting some rest.
“No,” John said, rolling his eyes. “We wouldn’t want that.” He leaned up for an over-the-top kiss before grabbing Sherlock’s hand and pulling him into the bedroom. “Come on you!”
Sherlock’s breath caught in his throat. It looked…it looked so much like…
early morning,” Sherlock went on, pausing to glance at John for specifics.
the bee’s knees,” he said, quite seriously. “I think you’re amazing, everything about you. I think you’re brilliant and clever. Kind and thoughtful, when you let yourself be. I think I’m lucky to have to you as a friend…and I think when the smartest man in London assumes you’re trying to ask him on a date when you first meet, then it means you very much are…”
John grinned. “That’s hard to imagine.”
God, he looked a sight. Eyes radiating exhaustion, the bags underneath heavy with so many days gone without sleep, lips drawn into a slight frown, as if too tired to form a proper expression. John fought to keep the added concern he felt away from his face, knowing there was a very good chance Sherlock would misinterpret it and shut himself down until there was nothing John would be able to do to help.
It had been his favourite ballet as a child. It still was. Everyone knew The Nutcracker - knew the story, knew the score. But no one had loved it like he had, at least that’s how it had seemed. He’d only ever been twice - both times at the Royal Opera House. His mum had bought the tickets on the rare occasions when their limited resources had been less limited, and they had sat in the balcony, unable to afford anything else. But each time had been amazing. He had sat, his program clutched in his hands, his attention rapt on the stage, the costumes, the story. The memories had never gone.
When John starts to pull away, Sherlock grabs at his hand without thought, wanting desperately for him to stay. He lets it go as soon as he realizes, hand curling against the sheets, and swallows at his mistake. He can't take too much. He knows this. He's already taken so much of John.
"I'm here."
“You think I don’t know what you got me this year, but I do,” he bluffed, trying to gauge John’s expression.
"What's wrong?" John sounds worried. His voice is laced with alarm. "Sherlock?"
John had to press his lips together to keep from laughing at such a flirtatious word coming from a visibly petulant Sherlock. It was obvious, however, that he had failed to hide his amusement because Sherlock’s pout was getting stronger by the second.

There had been cases, of course, in the months since he'd returned. And he'd searched for the clues, puzzled out the motives, chased the suspects; he'd done what he always had, and he'd solved each and every case.
John hasn't asked about his time away yet. He's somehow grateful and unsure at the same time. He doesn't know what he would do if John were to ask. He lays on his bed one night, staring at his ceiling dispassionately, putting off sleep. It's a question that needs to be considered.
Sherlock nodded. “Meteorologists keep varied hours, but each forecast is put together 2-3 hours in advance of the show’s broadcast,” he continued. “It’s likely he was going to work to get ready for the 6 am news. Cutting through Regent’s Park probably shaved some time off of his commute.”
“Yes…” Sherlock matched his smile and nodded towards the mugs. “It’s how Mycroft always made us hot cocoa. As boys.”
"Sherlock??"
John was able to hold back his snort…barely. “Maybe,” he grinned, unable to keep a straight face. “If you tried really really hard.”
John's voice is hoarse, but soft, and it spools around him like warm honey.
Mrs. Hudson took one last look at the myriad of boxes littering her tenants’ flat before mouthing a sympathetic
“You didn’t label the bacteria culture experiment when you put it in the
He glanced up, nerves fading slightly as he saw the pink flush dusting Sherlock’s cheeks and running down his neck. The blush was endearing, but the open vulnerability in Sherlock’s eyes spoke volumes.
“Seriously?”
“You know what I think?” John asked, quietly interrupting before the amateur apiarist could start into a rant about the merits of bees - one he’d heard many times over.
Another year. More smoke. He blows out the candle and wishes for the memories to go away.
“Well…” Sherlock brow furrowed further.
The surprise on John’s face grew, and Sherlock huffed out a laugh.
A smile pulled at Sherlock’s lips, and he ripped the wrapping paper at the edges before removing the lid. The contents gave him pause and his brow furrowed in confusion.
I don’t even know. This chapter is a mess. I am so sorry XD
“Oh God.”
One day he tries to drown it out with his violin, but the notes are off, discordant, wrong. What he once had now eludes him, and the loss cuts him deeper than he’d ever thought. He puts the instrument down, and he doesn't reach for it again.
“Sherlock!”
John hummed along with the radio as he brewed his morning tea, head swaying slightly with the tune.
“When did you first start loving bees?” he asked curiously.
“Ridiculous?” John looked at him, trying not to laugh at the over-dramatics. “Really?”
side with Mummy when I wanted to put a beehive on our roof to study, but…”
“His clothes say it all,” Sherlock replied, slightly exasperated. He stood and moved aside, gesturing. “Look at his suit. Really look. It’s quality, but it’s grey, plain, nothing special. Does ‘nothing special’ strike you as the kind of thing a man with little money would splurge on? No, but he would have had to; he’d be unable to wear anything with stripes or checks to his job due to their tendency to shift and ripple on television screens. The Moiré pattern at work. And his tie.” He switched his attention to the tailored accessory.
“No wait!
How was he to deduce a thing if he couldn’t find any of the facts?
“And if you wouldn’t mind, Sherlock…” John offered his hand. “I would love to dance with you.”
“It’s not for you,” John retorted, grinning.
“So everything you’ve been telling me about bees, everything you’ve been correcting her on, you learned all that as a child?”

"You came back to me..." John murmurs after a moment, voice hoarse and quiet. “…thank you for coming back to me."
Two years away, and he's still alone.
“In primary school?”
He's lost his fondness for cigarettes.
He hadn't realized how much he'd missed the cases.

…except…tickets to the nutcracker at the London Coliseum! Opening night wouldn’t be until February, but he was sure having the tickets in hand counted. Close to the stage, in the center of the venue…it was perfect.

He felt Sherlock inhale shakily. "Now let it out, love..." He whispered, head bowed against Sherlock's. And as Sherlock did, John did as well, his warm breath filtering across Sherlock's neck. And John felt Sherlock relax. Just a bit.
“Better that than have you near a laptop.” Sherlock’s deep voice was laced with humour. “God only knows what you’ll title this one.”
“You’re only supposed to put three in…” his voice rumbled softly through the words.
It wasn’t under the tree. It wasn’t anywhere in their room nor in the one upstairs (he’d looked). Under his skull, hidden in the cupboard, between the sofa cushions - he’d searched everywhere.
“It could have gone up in smoke, you know,” he remarked as John returned. “I could have burned it.”
“A murder on the first snow of the season,” Lestrade sighed, stopping next to John and surveying the scene with a grim and slightly disappointed expression.
"Take a breath for me," he said softly.
John's touch makes him flinch away. John's voice, soft and steady, slowly pulls him back. It tells him where they are, how they'd met, what they'd had for breakfast that morning. It tells him to focus on the feel of the sheets beneath him, to breathe in, to breathe out. It filters through the cacophony in his head and tells him he's safe, they're safe, that he's in London, that he’s home, over and again, until recognition hits and it draws him back.
He sighed. He’d solved serial murders, locked door mysteries, anything and most everything the Yard could throw at him. So why couldn’t he deduce what to get for the person that he knew the best and cared for the most?
fair, if only for the fact that he was…well…himself. But John hadn’t even put a box out this year.
“I was thinking…” John paused for effect, looking sidelong at his friend. “
“I hope you don’t think I’ll be wearing this,” he remarked wryly, taking the leather collar from its box and looking it over.
Sherlock walked back to the body and crouched once more, gesturing to the deceased man’s hands. “His finger nails are manicured, well taken care of - you would expect so with a profession in the media - but they’re chewed to the quick. Obviously he had something to be nervous about. The broadcast? Perhaps. First day on a new job. But he’s not new to the industry - there’s no reason it would cause him that much stress. A person, then. One he was acquainted with.  He knew this was coming.”
…except…oh! A jumper! That jumper. Right there. Did society deem it ok to give someone a jumper on Christmas without it featuring ugly reindeer or garish colours? Irrelevant. This one was gorgeous. A deep burgundy with cabling down the front and a shawl collar, soft with a decent weight…John needed this. And he would never get it for himself. It was perfect.
“We are the Followers of the Mark. We claim the right of  retribution. The lost one will pay his debt to us with his blood.  Give him to us or we will destroy this  building and the city surrounding it.”
John raised his head and saluted then followed in Sherlock’s  footsteps. Judging by the shouting he was already causing trouble.
The End.
Mycroft sniffed. “Don’t be silly  John. Everyone left for the reception as soon as they saw where this  was going. No doubt the majority of them are already three sheets to  the wind.”
Sherlock straightened his cuffs and  grabbed John’s hand pulling him away from Mycroft and Greg. “We’ll  meet you there.”
Sherlock’s smile was small and  smug. “I never had any doubt.”
“Hey look that wasn’t all me! You think your mother was  always easy to live with? She had a mouth on her like …”
“They aren’t magic John.” Sherlock said as he nestled one of  the buds into his ear and offered the other to John. “They’re rather … alive.”
“Greg,” John hissed, “no  amount of this bubbly crap is going to fix – dear gods this is  good.”
“Oh.” John didn’t quite know what to say to that.
“I knew it.” Lloyd sounded smug and pleased as he beamed at  his son.
John advanced, his bones grinding, his  muscles wrenching and bulging as he stalked forward. His form  wavered, straining, twisting itself into something new. By the time  he breached Lloyd’s space he towered over him, a beautiful and  deadly combination of man and predator.
There was silence in the temple.  Sherlock looked to John who shrugged, lips quirking into a grin. “You  would know better than me. He’s your brother.”
“Don’t think you’re getting  out of standing up there too,” Greg announced from beside him, his  smug grin turning gleeful at the look of horror on John’s face. “We  need another body to balance things out and I thought it might be  better to spring it on you at the last minute. Figured it would help  diminish the flight risk.”
“Did it work?” His throat was tight and dry and the words  grated on their way out but Sherlock managed a weak grin as John rolled his  eyes and helped him to his feet.
“Ain’t that right Followers of the blah, blah, yada, yada?”  Lloyd crouched over his son as if trying to shield him from the trio’s gaze.  “You got me now. Leave the rest of these yahoos alone and I’ll come with you  nice and quiet like.”
“You’re welcome.” John’s voice was entirely too satisfied as  he worked on the trusses.
Before John could answer he stumbled  into Sherlock as a loud crack sounded and the temple floor gave a  sharp jerk. The air turned several degrees colder as Mycroft returned  his umbrella to the crook of his arm and smiled pleasantly as he  turned to face the congregation.
The light filtering  through the stained glass windows of the temple was stunning. It  bathed the cool, stone interior in a rainbow of rich color, painting  the enormous archways in brilliant hues. John’s hand was clamped  around Sherlock’s wrist, dragging him into the sanctuary. Before  them stood rows of empty pews, and at the end an altar covered in  fresh flowers.
John returned from his thoughts to  find Sherlock staring at him from the rumpled sheets, his gaze keen  and heavy lidded.
John could swear he felt the touch  of the tip of an umbrella on his shoulder as if the blade of a sword  had bestowed knighthood upon him but when he raised his head Mycroft  had not moved. Greg’s face held a look of dawning realization mixed  with resignation. But he graced John with a smile as he inched even  closer to Mycroft’s side.
“A pleasure to see  you as well, John,” Mycroft’s voice echoed dryly from behind  them. “So lovely you can both be a part of our joyous day.”
“Sh! God damn it that hurt.” Lestrade worked himself to a  sitting position and clutched his head between shaking hands.
Sherlock huffed. “I cannot believe you would choose Mycroft.  I refuse to believe anyone would choose Mycroft.”
John let go and stepped back his mouth set in a grim line. “If  she wasn’t human what was she then?”
“No.”
Thank you so much to all of you who read and bookmarked and commented on this fic and sent me lovely words of encouragement to continue it. I never had the intention to abandon it but real life took an unexpected turn last year and family issues forced me to step away for a bit. I've had this chapter sitting on my hard drive half written for months and it feels so good to finally be able to post it for you. I hope you enjoy it!
Lloyd dug his fingers in deep as John struggled to pull away.  “Sorry Johnny but it’s either you or me and trust me it’s better if it’s you.”
“Well then,” a voice rang out  from the altar where the high priest was now sitting, the toes of his  bony white feet twitching as he swung his legs back and forth, “As  the designated emissary of the Old Ones on this plane, I deem the  requirements fulfilled and the bonding complete and sanctioned. We  shall assume the continued silence of the assembled representatives  of all the houses of fey indicate your acceptance of and allegiance  to the new king. Are there any objections?”
The treads quaked as Mycroft climbed after the fox at a deliberate  and unhurried pace. He hummed and twirled his umbrella as he half shifted into  his dragon form. Mycroft’s skin glittered with a dusting of scarlet scales and  shining gold claws slipped from his fingertips. Horns curled through his ginger  hair and smoke billowed with every measured breath.
“Gentlemen, and I’m using the term loosely here, we really  should probably think about leaving before the two dragons upstairs tear apart  half of London.”
“Cease your rambling!” Sherlock rumbled in frustration. “You  will tell us where John is or I’ll…”
John snarled.
Sherlock sighed and raised an  eyebrow in his brother’s direction. “Do you want them standing  upright at this ridiculous ceremony or doing an interpretive dance?”
“What did you do to him?!” He shouted at the Followers of  the Mark who climbed to their feet and stood watching them.
He threw back his golden head and roared as the jaguar’s  claws pierced his skin and ripped the tattoo from its site. Ignoring the ragged  gash that was already healing he transformed fully and pounced at the same time  the wolverine leaped from the other side.
The fox tossed his head back to make sure Mycroft was watching  then leapt against one of the station’s emergency exits shoving down on the  handle with a fisted paw. His small body swung as the door opened with a crash  and he was flung into the air where he curved gracefully and made a perfect  landing on all four feet. He paused once to sniff then sped up the stairs towards  the roof.
He wondered how his life had come to this. His younger years  were spent as an unassuming human. He’d gone to school, played rugby, trained  as a doctor and ended up drafted into the officer corps of the British Royal  Army on the eve of the Sere War.
John snarled over his shoulder as he  was surrounded by minions and pushed into a curtained cubicle. He was  twisted and turned, helpless to their machinations as he swiftly  found himself standing only in his boxers. “Sherlock! Greg?  Mycroft!! I swear on my spotted, furry ass I will murder you all in  your sleep!”
“I hope they channel Grandmother’s ghost.”
“Yes Sherlock?” John gasped.
“We will take you both.”
“You. Hurt. Him.” The words were  slurred between his protruding fangs.
John tilted his head up at Sherlock and grinned. “Did you  just compliment Mycroft?”
Lloyd shuddered. “Now Johnny boy that’s low. I never meant  to hurt your mother …”
Lloyd rubbed the back of his neck looking sheepish. “She  didn’t tell me too much about herself or maybe … maybe I didn’t ask. I know she  came from a line hunted almost to extinction and that she had many sisters once  but they are all gone now.”
Lestrade emitted a pointed cough. “I’m so glad you approve  of the killer’s methods Sherlock. Perhaps you’d like to tell me how he  infiltrated a fifth degree shield of power? Our own mages haven’t been able to  so much as punch a pinhole through the thing. ”
Mycroft raised an eyebrow and unfurled lengthening wings. “Sometimes  dear Gregory even I have to admit size is everything.” He reared his head back  and roared, reaching out with huge claws and tearing a set of double doors  right off their shrieking hinges.
“I hate these guys,” Lestrade said pointing at the red robed  figures.
John sighed. Sherlock had been repeating this same phrase  for days, every time he had a moment to think about it. He swatted his brand  new – flatmate? Lover? Dragon? – whatever he was – on the head with a folded  newspaper. “Enough! It worked didn’t it?”
Lestrade look confused. “Old man? Wait. Are you …?”
“You wouldn’t have any evidence if it weren’t for me  Lestrade,” Sherlock pointed out.
“Johnny …”
Greg laughed. “Well then we’d best  get a move on. We wouldn’t want to keep our devoted fans waiting.”
He staggered back as a sharp backlash sent sparks of pain  shooting up his arm. His vision went gray as rough hands hauled him down and he  was wrapped in strong arms.
“What?”
Lloyd opened his eyes to find fierce blue ones staring right  back at him. He sighed. “Morning John.”
John flinched and Sherlock bumped his shoulder and flicked  the switch on the microphone. “Don’t you think it more than a coincidence that  John’s long lost father happened to find the one place in London John and I  were almost certain to show up?”
The mark on John’s arm burned and  he pinched his lips to hide his grimace of pain.
“No.”
John looked away. “Not all of us can rely on fey tricks to  get us out of trouble.”
“What are you doing?” John hissed as Lloyd’s forearm was  bared. An intricate tattoo glowed softly against his skin. The deep blue lines  passed over and wove around each other forming an endless knot with no  discernible beginning or end.
“There,” he said, “Now we finally  have something in common. We are both marked men.”
