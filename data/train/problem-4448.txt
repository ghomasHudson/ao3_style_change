The second the door shut Claire whirled on him. “Did you tell him yet?” She demanded practically vibrating in excitement. Cas shushed her with one hand as he peered at the door, making sure her voice hadn’t carried.
The second the two stepped into the main room Cas was swept up into a hug, his feet barely brushing the floor. Sam’s bright apple smell enveloped him in a content bubble and he couldn’t help the smile from blooming on his face. “Hello, Sam. I trust all has been well?” The tall alpha rumbled out his agreement as he spun them in a half circle. Cas could pick up the second Sam’s nose twitched and his scent grew curious as he scented the air around Cas. “Don’t say anything.” He whispered quickly, eyes glancing up at Dean who’d just released Eileen with a wide grin.
Christmas, Dean decided, wasn’t actually so bad anymore. He wasn’t sure if it was the fact that they weren’t constantly moving around and could settle in one place for the holiday. Or if it was because they weren’t constantly fighting for their lives anymore or trying to stop another apocalypse. Or if it was because the bright smell of cloves and honey and sunlight after a storm permeated the air around him.
As Cas picked up his cocoa and took a large sip, eyes nervously on Dean’s face, waiting for his reaction before quickly flitting away. There was a slight rustle as he slipped the wrapping paper off, then cardboard coming apart, then… silence. One beat. Two. Then the wobbly sound of photo paper moving against itself.
Shit. Shit shit shit. Dean shot up from his half laying down position and instantly all thoughts of sleep vanished.
Cas barely had time to open his mouth before there was a loud ruckus outside the house. A rumbling engine cut off. Loud, deep laughter. The crack of beer cans opening. He felt his heart leap from his chest as realization hit him. It was the patrol. They were back. Dean was back. He watched Wes’s lip curl back in disgust before he was roughly shoved away. His back hit the wall with a thud. The second his hand released Cas’s neck the door opened.
He was right there and so willing to give Dean all the comfort and hope he needed. But he couldn't do it. He couldn't do this. Not to Cas.
He was almost afraid the walkie talkie would snap in half with the force of the hold he had on it. He didn’t care if he broke it though. He didn’t care that his fingers were starting to ache. He didn’t care that his hands were shaking.
With a heavy heart he dragged himself to the outpatient lobby and handed the reception desk the vaccine order. The blonde studied it for a long moment, her brows drawn together in confusion before she glanced back up at him. “The 21 vaccine? I didn’t think we were administering that here yet.” Castiel shrugged and looked away, they weren’t.
He felt sick. He found a pair of still soft sleep pants that Cas loved and gently pulled them over sticky legs. He’d have to help him clean up when Cas finally wakes up. For now though, he had to get them out of here. He had no doubt the camp won’t be very welcoming to them when they find Wes’s body. No matter what the reason was, they would always put their own before Cas.
He felt Cas shift ever so slightly closer to his side before he murmured, “Because I still have you.” Dean let him move a hand to rest over top of his own. “Why does the 23rd haunt you, Bee?” Dean huffed and rolled his eyes at the nickname as he turned one hand over to tangle their fingers together. It was too close. Too close, too close, too close but Dean couldn't help it. He wanted and needed and Cas was
It was barely a whisper and there was something… off about the way he said it. Then the line went staticy again and Dean swore under his breath.
Cas gave him everything. His energy, his wings, his Grace, his life. His love. His devotion. And what did Dean give him back? A slap to the face. He took all that love and threw it back in Cas’s face because he was too ashamed and afraid to hold it too close. He brought his hands up to cover Cas’s before he slowly pulled them down and took a step back. “You’re right.” Cas gave him a sad smile even as Dean watched his face crumple.
Grabbing the beaten up electronic he jabbed the button on the side to make the sound stop. Belatedly he hoped Chuck hadn’t heard the noise. He knew the other had no qualms hosting the camp leader, but he wasn’t so sure he’d appreciate being woken up. Again.
“Well duh.” Dean said in exaggeration, rolling his eyes for extra effect. “How else would there be presents here for you otherwise?” Jack’s face lit up at that and he all but scrambled from the room leaving behind a trail of cinnamon and rain.
Letting himself smile for the first time in days Dean whispered back, “Hey, Cas.” Cas looked around their surroundings and his eyes narrowed as his frown deepened. There seemed to be a thought fighting to get through and Dean braced himself. His hand came up to rest against the one now resting on his shoulder and let their fingers twine together. He felt the second Cas remembered what happened.
He continued to sit there staring at the floor long after the line had gone dead, Gabriel told him he had to go but would call him before Castiel’s flight leaves the next day. The realization still made his head spin. He was leaving tomorrow. He looked around at the mostly boxed up room with vacant eyes. He was leaving the home he’d known for the past 10 years tomorrow. He was leaving, and he wasn’t coming back.
“Finish that sentence and you can stay outside tonight.” Cas cut in sharply, eyes narrowing as he forcibly moved Dean’s face to look at him again. “It was what you meant. It’s always what you mean.” There was a bitter note to his voice that made Dean flush in shame. It hurt. It hurt a lot, because he knew it was the truth. It was the truth and Dean hated himself for it.
There was static on the other end of the walkie talkie and Dean wanted to throw the damn thing at the wall. It was the middle of the night. What on Earth could be so important that Cas needed to buzz him at that instant?
The sharp sound of a hand connecting with skin cut through the night air. Dean’s mouth dropped open as he brought his hand up to press against his stinging cheek. Blinking rapidly he leveled a disbelieving look at Cas.
“Dean?” Cas’s voice was quiet behind him and the hunter sighed. Poking at the dying embers he shuffled over just enough for Cas to sit beside him if he wanted.
Dean didn’t say anything for a long moment and then, “Sometimes.” His voice was distant as he watched the two omegas laugh quietly as Claire plopped down beside Cas, her feet instantly coming up to rest on his lap. “Though it’s usually when he’s in heat and begging me to--”
Without opening his eyes he whispered, “It’s fine, Dean. I’m fine. It was nothing.” It was the worst lie Dean had ever heard and they both knew it. He let it slide though because the haunted look in Cas’s eyes told him to. Told him he didn’t want to deal with it. Leaning forward Dean pressed a soft kiss to the corner of his mouth and sighed. With a slight nod he pulled back and moved to stand up. They’d have to talk about it eventually.
“Figure that out all on your own, dipshit?” Dean snapped dryly, his eyes grew cold and sharp with his words. Defensive. He stared at the way Dean folded his arms over his chest and squared his stance. Protective. At least some things haven’t changed then. “Was it the gold bleeding through the blue in his eyes all day that gave it away? Or I don’t know,” he waved a dismissive hand in the air around them, “maybe the disgustingly strong citrus smell.”
His grip on the door frame tightened. He shouldn’t have been there. It had to be a breach of trust or something right? Cas had allowed him to stay in his, their?, cabin but that gave him no right to spy on them— right? But it was… it was himself wasn’t it? Didn’t that mean he was actually allowed? God it made his head hurt and the sickly sweet citrus and dried rose petal scent saturating the tiny house was only making him nauseous.
“At least you don’t have to worry about pregnancy issues from it?” Hannah grinned as she popped the top off her water bottle and took a long swig but said nothing. Setting it back down, her expression grew serious, “Look, Cas, if it’s really that big of a problem just tell them you can’t do it. They can’t force you to go.” Except they could. They could cut his funding. They could transfer his patients. They could guilt trip him.
Looking back at his laptop again Castiel scowled and jabbed at the backspace again. Groaning he dropped his head back and met Dean’s frown with one of his own. “I don’t know what I’m doing.” Cas huffed, knowing his scent was giving away his barely covered frustration. His roommate’s frown cracked first as he rolled his eyes.
Christmas, Dean decided, wasn’t actually so bad anymore. He has officially decided it was because of the bright smell of cloves and honey and vanilla wrapped in sunlight after a storm.
Dean sighed into the skin of Cas’s shoulder. “I know… I just worry.” Cas nodded in understanding. He’d go. They both knew it but there was still an edge.
The following days and weeks and months were saturated with desperation and fear and it had made Cas nauseous. He’d been doted on like a lover. Like he was something more. Like he mattered to the hunter. He’d promised to help him. To stay by his side, if only Cas would try.
His vision went red the second he opened the hut door. Wes stood over Cas’s broken and naked form. He was just zipping up his pants, and Dean didn’t hesitate. The gunshots rang through the dark without another thought. Wes let out an ear splitting scream and crumbled to the floor, hands flying to the bullet wound in his leg. He jerked his head back to stare, wide eyed at Dean. “You-- You shot me. You turned on your own kind for him? Why?”
As Jack pulled out the red pants covered in fries, Claire handed Castiel an almost identical box. Cas frowned, his face still burning at Dean’s comment, at the box in his hands then glanced between the two, “You planned this.” Dean shrugged, smirk firmly in place as Cas opened the box and pulled out dark blue pants covered in soda cups, the straws each a rainbow of colors. “Did you pick them out?” He asked Claire tentatively, alarm raising as the two alphas looked at each other with matching smirks.
Of course he knew every one of the women who’d left the hospital took with them a diagnosis that they were barren. COVID-20 is what they were calling it. A reaction from the vaccine. They’d all been tested, the mothers and fathers, and they all came back the same. He’d been the one to run the tests. He’d been the one to hold their hands and tell them. He’d been the one to break their hearts.
He pushed it as close to the fire as he dared, letting it warm up before he went back to Baby where Cas was still in the backseat. With almost reverent hands he tucked Cas into the blankets, smoothing them down to fit snug against his body. Threading his fingers through dark fringe Dean sighed, “I’m sorry, Cas.”
And the leader of the group was standing in their house. He was frowning down at a large iridescent black feather in his hand. Cas froze the second Wes looked up and caught his gaze. “Ah. There you are,
It hurt like a punch to the gut. Just the way Dean had said it. Disgusting. Even the Dean of this time couldn’t stomach the smell. “Oh but wait, maybe you’re actually referring to the fact he refuses to let me claim him?” There was a burning smell radiating off of Dean in waves. Burnt burnt rubber and sour apples and something vaguely resembling sulfur. It made him gag just as the sickly sweet clementine.
“Ugh, Daaad.” She whined and crossed her arms over her chest, “What are you waiting on? For him to smell it first?”
Cas was silent beside him for the longest time and then, “Sam wouldn’t want this to haunt you.” Dean stiffened and his fist clenched around the stick. Yeah. Sam. “You can’t keep doing this. Remembering is one thing, but Dean. You’re obsessing. You’re letting your memories take over and drown you.”
It was an expression he knew all too well. It was disgusted and hurt and shame and immeasurable want. It was an ugly thing he’d seen in the mirror every time he’d had to push Castiel away. “I may be you, but I’m not a mind reader. There’s too much shit that could be referring to right now.”
“What are you still doing out here?” It was a simple enough question to pull him back to reality. He knew Cas meant nothing by it, that he couldn’t possibly know. How could he when Dean never said anything? How could he when Dean refused to let him in. Refused to let him close enough to understand the weight of his own thoughts. Yet at the same time, the question still picked at a scabbing wound mercilessly. What was he doing out here? What did he gain by stewing over this every year? What more could he hope to understand.
Which was why, hidden away in the branches of their Christmas tree was a little black box with a little silver ring inside. “I think if you move them around anymore, the paper will rip and you’ll ruin Christmas.” He said with a slowly widening smile. Cas blinked over his shoulder at him owlishly before he frowned down at the gift in his hands.
From the couch Cas ‘tutted’, “Language.” Claire rolled her eyes and stuck her tongue out at Cas before turning back to Jack and giving him a hug. The cheeseburger pants grasped tightly in her hands as she rubbed the back of his head affectionately.
“Dr. Novak. Thank you so much for agreeing to meet with me.” Naomi greeted him pleasantly as he entered her office. He nodded once in greeting, knowing it would be pointless to mention the fact that she had all but threatened termination if he missed it. As soon as he sat at the long table a file folder was pushed across to him. C. J. Novak stared up at him in blocky black letters and Castiel frowned at it before looking back up to Naomi.
.” The only thing keeping Dean from ripping his throat out right then and there was the terrified look Cas shot him.
“Christmas is about family, Cas, and every year it reminds me that my family is gone. Every year it hits me, again and again that Sammy is gone. That mom and dad are gone. That my whole god damn family is gone.” He sucked in a ragged breath, yanked his hand away from Cas’s and then choked out, “So yeah, it is a fucking curse. Every Christmas I’m cursed to remember I’m fucking alone.” It felt like a knife twisting in his heart. He'd rather hurt him this way though. He'd rather hurt Cas now, and keep him here.
The Covid-20 mutation born from the initial vaccine neutralized the affects, but caused infertility. Humanity suffered as populations dwindled. Women had trouble getting pregnant, and those that could rarely carried to full-term. Those that did were the result of medical intervention. Those babies born, were different. This is where our story begins; with the man mutated Covid-21.
He turned away then. Walked back to the tiny couch and sat down, head in his hands. He didn’t understand. From what he’d gathered from others, the two regularly spent the nights together. Spent Cas’ heats together. Dean’s ruts together. Why weren’t they mates though? Why did Cas shy away when Dean so clearly tried? They both wanted, that much was obvious. So why the fuck were they like this? Whatever had happened in this future, they were clearly closer than where they were in 2009. They were clearly mates. Why the fuck weren’t they
He knew the offer would be accepted before Cas even realized he was moving. “What, Cas?” He asked, once the other was seated beside him. The space between their bodies simultaneously too much and not enough. Dean wondered when this rift happened. When did they let themselves drift apart like this?
Finally he pulled it away and Cas let out the long breath he had been holding and scrambled back closer toward Dean. “Relax, Winchester, it’s all harmless fun. Right
The lady narrowed her eyes at him and demanded to speak to his superior. She was an American citizen and she had rights and they couldn’t make her follow their sheep ways. At that point Castiel just… didn’t care anymore. Blinking slowly, he pursed his lips, knowing she would be able to see it in the hard lines around his eyes anyway. “Look, ma’am, honestly, I don’t care if you want to wear it or not. I don’t care if you believe it’s a hoax. I really don’t, but this is a hospital.” He gestured vaguely to the waiting room behind himself as if she didn’t seem to understand, “And as such you’re required to wear it. So please.”
“You say that as if you’re not able to smell me from literally a mile away.” Castiel deadpanned, raising his gaze to level an unamused stare at Dean. The alpha rolled his eyes and waved a hand back and forth as if to say ‘tomato’ ‘tomahto’. “I’m just saying, I’m not the only player in this. ”
Pushing away from his, no, it was no longer his, locker Castiel took the seat across from her. Instantly he propped his chin on his hand and deadpanned, “Oh yes. I’m being forced to leave my entire life behind, my friends, my family, everyone I know, to go to some backwater town where weird babies are being born but that’s all fine, because I get to be a guinea pig for a new shot. A shot, mind you, that may or may not be the cause of these weird birth defects to begin with.” One raised eyebrow and a tap on the papers in front of him then he sighed, “Sounds like a wonderful trade.”
The transfer documents stared back at him. “Your expertise in the maternity ward is needed.” Naomi said bitterly as she resumed tapping her pen on the file. “In the past week, Lawrence General Hospital has had 5 babies born. Happy, healthy babies.”
The small sound was enough to make the warmth pressed against him jerk awake as well. In the next second there were hands pressed against his cheeks, forcing his head back to look up. Frantic green eyes looked back and he felt his brows draw together in confusion.
In a desperate attempt to rebuild, the new virus was given under the guise of a vaccine. It’s effects however were not what anyone expected. The new classifications started to make themselves known; Alpha, Beta, and Omega. The Alpha genes were the first to present. Those who took to it were stronger, faster--
came through he was shocked to hear the almost sad sound to it. Nodding slowly he agreed just as soft and that was the end of it. Left to his own thoughts Cas wished things could have been different. Wished his family had all stayed together. He wished that for once everything went to the plan he’d once had for his future.
“I know you didn’t, Angel. I know you didn’t. I saw them on the floor. I’m so proud of you.” Dean whispered almost reverently into his hair as he combed his fingers through it. “So proud of you.”
Swinging over the back of the couch to land on the cushion next to Castiel, the alpha tapped his pointer finger against his nose. “It can’t be that hard. All they want is your personal experience, Cas.” That gained him another groan in response. With a stifled laugh Dean propped his feet up on the coffee table and folded his arms over his chest. “Is this really causing you that much trouble?”
“Well, time for conversation is done. It’s time for food.” With that he turned on his heel and stalked away toward the table currently being set with food by Jack and Claire. Dean shot his brother a long suffering look that was only mildly put off by soft pine. They’d talk about it again later. He knew that, but for now he followed his omega toward the rest of their family.
Dropping the hand holding the paper work, he sighed and let his head hit the locker. “How is this my life?”
Dean rolled his eyes as Cas started typing away again. “It’s a personal account, Cas, it doesn’t need to have all the scientific information. They’re probably only expecting you to give them basic change information. Like how and when your sense of smell changed. How your physicality changed and when you… what’s the word they’re using now?, presented?” He waggled his eyebrows slightly and Cas rolled his eyes with a scoff. His cheeks flushed and the honey tint to his scent grew stronger though, causing Dean to grin wider.
“You’re right.” He repeated as he dropped Cas’s hands and took another step back. Clenching his jaw he met blue eyes briefly before turning on his heel and stalking away toward their cabin. It was a stupid thing to do. He should have stayed. Should have talked about it. He should have fixed whatever broken thing had settled between them. Yet at the same time he knew Cas would forgive him. He always forgave him, and Dean would continue to push and push and push.
He kept watch throughout the night, sitting with his back against the sofa nearest Cas’s head, and his knees drawn up to his chest. He must have fallen asleep at some point because the next thing he became aware of was long fingers trailing over his ear and down his neck. Looking back his gaze met sleep disoriented blue and he exhaled sharply. “Hello, Dean.” Cas croaked, frowning at the dryness in his throat.
“What happened.” Dean demanded quietly, thumbs running over the bags under his eyes. “Are you alright? Where did he get the feather from, Cas?” Shaking his head to attempt to clear it Cas gulped and closed his eyes. With a shaking hand he reached up to press it against Dean’s chest, right over his heart.
Sitting on the end of the bed Cas smiled to himself before saying softly, “I think I’ll take you up on the offer, Gabe. It’s been so long— too long.” A beat and Castiel could practically feel Gabriel’s happiness radiating through the phone. “I’ve missed you.”
“Shut your face before I take your shit back.” Dean wagged a threatening finger at Claire who snickered back. Turning back to his mate he huffed, but he smiled again anyway, “I love you, Cas. You know I do, and I’m happy to be your mate. Always.” Castiel bit  his bottom lip as his eyes sparkled with flecks of brilliant gold amongst ocean blue. “But I’d be even happier if you’d be my husband.”
Flinging the door open Dean took off down the path that led to his and Cas’s shared cabin. Pressing the walkie talkie to his lips he pressed the button to override the other line.
Nodding to the file still in his hands she continued, voice clipped as she flipped through the pages. “Of the 28 babies born this past year 23 have been in your care. 56 post COVID-19 patients of yours have been discharged with a clean bill of health.” Castiel opened the file and stared at the names and numbers. He wasn’t quite sure where she was going with this but at least it didn’t sound like he was getting fired. The last page is what finally caught his attention.
“Have you previously tested positive for COVID-19?” Cas frowned. Why would they need that information now? He’d already been vaccinated for it. They hadn’t even asked then, so why— “Dr. Novak?”
, as his counter part bit down on Cas’ shoulder. As Cas whined and scratched at his back. He shouldn’t be watching this. But he did. He watched himself run his tongue over the bite before moving higher up to suck dark marks over Cas’ mating gland. He watched Cas squirm away panting. He watched Cas wiggle to make his Dean’s knot slip in and he tipped his head back in ecstasy. He watched disappointment cloud his own face and the apple scent grew sour.
“No, but you’re the one they’re interested in, sweetheart. Anyway enough of my story will be told in tandem with yours.” Dean teased lightly. Pursing his lips he reached over and plucked the laptop out of Castiel’s grasp, an idea forming. “How about this. You talk, I type, and when needed I’ll include my side of the events, ya?” As Cas opened his mouth to protest Dean held up a hand, eyebrows raised over red tinted irises. “None of that.”
He tried to ignore the bright red coating Cas’s pale thighs. Brilliant flower petals against fresh snow. He couldn’t. He saw the tears hit the ground before it registered they were even falling. He saw them mix with the blood,
Unfortunately, the two usually came hand in hand. His fingers trembled as Cas folded them over the pills and let out a shaky sigh. Closing his eyes he tipped his hand over and dumped them on the floor, the almost empty bottle following with a muted clack. The truth of it all was, he was tired.
There was a disgusted sneer on his face, and he left the knife protruding from Wes’s neck as he scooped Cas up into his arms. The former Angel was out cold and Dean tried his best to keep from waking him as he pulled a soft sweater over his bruised torso. He ignored the red staining the floor boards. He ignored the red smears across his arms and hands and legs.
. Thought I could have anyone, and no one was good enough for me. It’s funny that the one person we want doesn’t want us anymore, isn’t it?” There was a jagged edge to his words. It cut along his nerves and flayed his senses. It was an old hurt. One he didn’t want to know how long it’d been there.
“It’s too flowery.” Castiel jumped slightly at the sudden gruff voice. Eyes wide, he glanced over his shoulder at where Dean was leaning over the back of the couch to look at what he had been writing. The blond had a frown on his face as he skimmed over the previous paragraph. “I know you were trying to veer away from text book and all. But now you’re making it sound like the beginning of some trashy romance novel.”
“Thought you were at Lizzie’s.” He murmured, voice dipping off slightly because he was still so tired. Why was he so tired? Dean’s right hand slipped to cup the back of his head as he pulled Cas forward to tuck his head underneath his chin.
Sighing, he tipped his head to the side and pressed his cheek against the crown of Cas’s head. He did this. He caused this distress and disenchantment in the once mighty warrior. He wasn’t strong enough to say yes then, so now he wasn’t strong enough to save Cas. Turning his head, Dean pressed his lips to smoke scented hair and just breathed. He let the strong smell of leaf litter, and camp smoke and weed wash over him. He mourned the loss of ozone and morning rain. Of honey and peppermint.
The world grew still around them and Dean finally looked over at his companion. Cas was no longer watching him or the fire. Instead he was staring at the long scar across the back of one hand where it disappeared up his sleeve. His expression was distant and his voice thick when he finally spoke again. “No.” He looked up to meet Dean’s eye then, “No, it wasn’t.”
“It’s different because this is still hurting you. Every year you think about it and it hurts you.” Dean could feel Cas’s gaze on him but he refused to look over. Instead he watched the embers glow and pop. Eating away at the charred wood like a disease. “It’s a curse on your very soul and I ca—“
“I killed him.” Dean muttered, tone matter of fact and blunt. His grip on Cas’s hand tightened, thumb smoothing over his palm reassuringly. I don’t regret it at all. He fucking hurt you and I just… I lost it. I killed him, Cas.” The watery sound of Cas breathing mixed with the crackle from the fireplace. Neither of them spoke again. Neither of them had to.
Something in his clipped and distant tone must have clicked with her because she quickly typed something out, stamped his vaccine record and handed it back.
“Well, when you’re that good people start to notice.” Hannah teased as she came into the breakroom and flopped down at the small table. She took her mask off and dropped it beside her water bottle as Cas turned his head to look at her. She shrugged and pulled a ‘what can you do’ look at his frustrated groan. “But hey, this means you get the new vaccine right?”
“He doesn’t understand.” Cas stopped beside him as they both stared at the door. The smell wasn’t as strong anymore with his heat sated for the time being but his nose still wrinkled in distaste. He could see Cas’ lips quirk up and he let shame color his scent. “It’s okay. I’m used to it by now. A product of the times I’m afraid.” At that he couldn’t help but looking over, brows raised in confusion. Gold eyes slowly faded back to blue as he finally met Dean’s gaze.
But it was required in Kansas, as Naomi had so kindly reminded him as she handed him the vaccine order. It was required for him to travel there, to live there. It wasn’t that he disagreed with the mandate, God knows he agreed that everyone should be vaccinated. There was just something about the new one that still didn’t sit right with him and he would have liked to study it more first. “I have to have it.” Because a mandate was put out before actual tests were run. Because they decided to use entire states as the test subjects. And he was unfortunately about to be their newest guinea pig.
Instead he walked away. He walked away as the hitch in Cas’s breathing rang through the frozen air. He walked away because that’s all he could do. He didn’t deserve the kind of loyalty Cas bestowed on him. He didn’t deserve it because he couldn’t bring himself to give it back. Because if he gave it back, he wouldn't be able to stop. If he gave it back, Cas would get hurt. Instead he walked away. Even when he knew it hurt the fallen Angel every time.
Sam scoffed with a smile. “She’s pregnant, Dean, you know that, of course she’s large.” The expression turned fond and the apple scent around them sweetened. “Things are going really well. Just hit six months and the little bugger is super active.” The almost longing look on Dean’s face made Sam’s heartache. His brother had always been the more pup oriented of the two. Always talking about wanting to settle down and raise a family. “Have you and Cas talked about… you know… having pups?”
All things considered, the first COVID vaccine hurt a lot worse. The initial sting and burn wasn’t as bad at least. “So how long till my arm starts really hurting?” He muttered, rubbing gently over the bandaid she’d just smoothed out.
“Dean, you have to go.” Cas muttered one night two weeks later. Thomas had approached them earlier that evening telling Dean they were headed out at daybreak and would appreciate his help. Dean had tried to refuse but Thomas just leveled him with an imploring look and told him to think about it. Without a single look at Cas he left again.
“I can’t call you family because then you’ll leave me too… and I… I don’t think I could stay alive without you, Angel.”
Over and over, patient after patient. Seeing it here, typed out, made his heart sink. Sure, those 56 mothers walked away with a ‘clean bill of health’ but they had lost their babies. They had lost their ability to try again. “It wasn’t my fault.” He muttered softly, fingertips brushing over the last column of words. Sterile sterile sterile. Over and over. It wasn’t his fault. It wasn’t.
They had only been officially mated for a few months. Cas had just started his pre-heat mood swings and finally demanded Dean either bite him and claim his ass or he’ll go find an alpha who would. Who was Dean to turn down such a romantic request. Now they proudly wore each other's bite and Dean— well Dean had plans.
Castiel realized Annis was a dirty liar when half an hour later he was downing an unrecommended amount of pain medicine as his arm felt like it was on fire and had been struck by lightning all at once. Thank God this vaccine only had one dose.
When Castiel first decided to go to medical school he thought that maybe he’d be able to do something. To help change the world as it were. He thought that it’d be research and studies and tests. What it really was, was running on two hours of sleep, in the middle of a double shift, trying to convince middle aged Nancy to keep her mask over her nose while inside the hospital. It was a lot of paperwork and stupid questions and insisting that no, the piece of lace over your mouth does not count as a proper face covering, and no you can’t come inside if you don’t switch to the approved disposable one offered.
Cas gestured to his body with one sweep of his hand, “Now even Dean can’t stand to be around me for longer than necessary to settle my heat waves.” He pressed his thumb into a darkening bruise on his thigh, expression unreadable. Bile rose in the back of his throat as he forced himself to sit beside him. As he forced himself to grab his wrist and pull up his sleeve. Distress burned the air around him as Cas ripped his arm away with a low snarl.
Now though? With the frozen air drifting through the off kilter door and the echoing howl of the wind Cas let himself think of it. Of Dean leaving him behind. Of Dean crawling into someone else’s bed, giving them the love Cas so desperately craved. The thought made him sick.
Cas felt his heart crack open at the sound. “Say it again?” He begged softly, hoping Dean understood what he actually meant because he wasn’t sure he’d be able to voice it. He let his eyes fall shut as he felt Dean nod above him.
The look was all he needed to know before he was wishing the floor would open up and swallow him whole. Sam and Eileen cackled on the love seat and Castiel shot them a glare. “You are all terrible people.” Sam shrugged one shoulder as he wheezed through his laughter, Eileen patting his back while stifling her own giggles.
Why did he give up so easily? Did his future self just not care enough to pursue it? He knew he had some issues but really? It didn’t make any sense it didn’t— “You know it’s rude to watch without consent, even if the world has gone to shit.” Dean jerked his head up and met his counterpart’s empty gaze. There was something lurking in those dull green eyes that made his stomach churn.
So that was that. The end of his double found him staring blankly at his now empty locker and signed transfer papers in his hands. He wasn’t quite sure how to feel just yet. Sure, this was a huge step forward for his career but at the same time this was his entire life they were uprooting. He was being forced to move hundreds of miles away to a place he’s never been to. To start a job he wasn’t sure he was capable of doing.
The wind was picking up again by the time he reached Cas’s limp form. His eyes were closed, and his skin was bright red and icy, “Cas? Cas, please— Cas you gotta—“ He cut himself off as he hauled the former Angel into his arms and cradled him to his chest. “It’s okay, Angel. It’s okay, I’ve got you. I’m here now.”
Truth be told that had been Castiel’s biggest fear thus far. That Dean would smell it before he had a chance to tell him. He’d managed smothering the change so far but he knew it was just a matter of time. “I’ll be telling him tonight.” He said with a soft smile and happiness rolled off him in waves. “When we do presents.”
With eyes frozen on the shaking hands pressing the rag to his collarbone Dean whispered, “It’s not pity, Castiel, it’s regret.” Never before had he been so open and honest. Never before had he let himself, but in that moment he couldn’t hold back if he wanted too. “It’s regret that we let this happen to you. It’s regret that I didn’t stop it. It’s regret that you can’t see how much I love you.” And Cas… Cas whined pathetically before sliding to the floor, shoulders slumping in defeat. It hurt seeing him like this. Seeing a warrior of God so broken and beaten. Seeing an Angel on his knees bloody and bruised and lost.
Dean had been out on a patrol with Steven, Thomas and Stephanie the day it happened. Maggy had told Cas to take the day off, and he didn’t think twice about it. He’d decided a week ago to clean up his and Dean’s hut and that had been the perfect opportunity. And then he got home.
He shouldn’t have gone. He shouldn’t have, but he did and now… Now Cas was hurt. They’d just gotten back and there was a tension in the camp. A tension that radiated from every face that refused to look him in the eye. Tension that bubbled over when Wes didn’t show up at the debriefing.
“Oh of course we know that, Dr. Novak. No one is blaming you for this unfortunate side effect. On the contrary, I want to congratulate you, on behalf of the hospital, for your excellent service. You saved many of those women’s lives. It’s the fact that all of these women have had the vaccine that makes this information relevant.” At that Cas jerked his head up, eyes wide in confusion. Naomi however was no longer looking at him. Instead she was pulling a paper out of the back of the folder. “Now if you please, the last page.”
Cas couldn’t sleep. It was cold and the wind made all of the window panes creak. And he was lonely. He knew it was stupid, it was his own fault Dean wasn’t there. He told the other man he didn’t want to see him, and Dean, being the ever considerate leader, had stormed out. Yelling about how he’ll just go warm Lizzie or Amanda or Nathan’s bed instead.
At the time Cas had been too angry and worked up to care. They’d just returned from a scouting mission. A mission that Dean refused to listen to Cas’s advice to turn back and regroup.  A mission that left three dead and more injured.
The almost hopeful tinge to his voice made Cas’ heartache. Why had they gone so long without speaking again?
He was tired of this stupid power grab. He was tired of seeing who could push the other further. He was tired, and cold, and lonely.
It was mumbled out and Cas frowned in frustration. Why was he so damn tired still? He needed to talk to Dean. He needed him to hear it he needed—
The line took a moment to disconnect and in that split second Dean heard it. The sound of pills shaking in a bottle.
“It was a mating leave, Cas. Not a vacation, and after the holidays we’ll be right back at it.” He pointed a warning finger at them both, Cas raised an eyebrow and Claire snickered behind on hand. “Now. I’m going to go make sure the other one hasn’t opened anything yet.” With that he swept from the room, grumbling about ‘cheeky omegas’ and ‘nosy brat alphas.’
He could see Annis frown under her mask as she tapped her pen on the counter. “Just standard questions we have to ask now.” A slight shrug and then she was smiling again, “Pregnant or nursing?” She teased, eyes light as she signed the bottom of the paper and passed it to him to sign off on as well.
“Come on now man, that one’s mine.” Dean teased as he came over and pulled Sam into a bear hug. Sam rolled his eyes but pat him on the back anyway after letting Cas slip away to greet Eileen.
“Enough about me.” Dean said in embarrassment, “How are you and Eileen doing? It’s been a while since we’ve gotten together.” He looked over the dark haired woman where she now sat beside Castiel in front of the tree, her hands resting lightly over her protruding stomach. “She’s looking quite… large.”
Cas had— well, Cas had not been welcomed so easily. But Maggy took him under her wing. Had given him work when the leader refused to make him part of the patrol. Dean had been on edge about the decision for weeks after, but Cas brushed it off. They were jumpy, sure, but they couldn’t have known about his fallen Angel status. They had probably just taken a look at his bloodshot eyes and decided him worthless.
Happy honey and cloves flooded the room instantly as Dean took another two steps forward before falling to one knee in front of where Castiel was still perched on the couch. “I know you know what this is and what’s going on… so do I still have to say it?” Cas nodded quickly, voice catching in his throat.
The smell of satisfied alpha washed over them both as Dean turned his gaze back on his brother. “It’s been amazing, Sammy. Like. Seriously,” His eyes jumped to where Cas and Eileen were now excitedly talking to Jack. The young beta was showing them something on his phone and they couldn’t hear what exactly they were talking about but it was clearly entertaining. From the other side of the room Claire was poking around with a CD player, her tongue poking out of the side of her mouth in concentration. “I’m happy, man.”
There was a soft ding as the doors slid open on the maternity ward. Cas stepped out and up to the decontamination tent in front of the buzzer door. Scanning his credentials he stepped through the UV light and let the harsh chemical smell wash over himself. Wrinkling his nose at the sting of the disinfectant he slipped a new pair of gloves on. It was a hassle these days, but it was necessary. They weren’t distributing the new vaccine yet. They weren’t required too, and though they have some on hand, they were explicitly told not to administer it. So no one had received it, not even the hospital staff. As such, without the extra security, he was still a liability.
It was like walking on eggshells around them. The tension could be felt through the whole camp. There was a storm coming, everyone could feel it.
The man’s face was drawn back in hurt and frustration and Dean could see his hands shaking in his lap. “Shut up.” Cas growled finally, “Shut the fuck up, Winchester. Yeah, they’re gone. Okay. I’m not going to sugar coat it because you’re a fucking big boy. They’re gone, but you’re not fucking alone.” He was though. He was and it was all his fault. Because if he wasn't, then it meant someone else would get hurt. And that someone else always seemed to be Cas.
And Dean just held him tighter. Breathed him in longer. Brushed his thumb across his cheek like he was something precious to behold. “I love you, Castiel.” There was something in the way he murmured the words. In the way he let Cas’s full name roll off his tongue like he still deserved the angelic designation. Like he used too, before Cas fell. Before he became human.
Shrugging he shoved the stick into the dying fire again and muttered, “It’s the 23rd.” As if that could explain it all. As if that told the former Angel why the night haunted his dreams and memories for the past 3 years. As if that could make the hurt disappear.
Dean nodded approvingly as he eyeballed the bright pants, “That they do.” He turned slightly toward Cas and nudged his side, “You and Jack need a pair now. I’m thinking fries for the kid,” Jack’s face lit up as Dean tossed him a box he had at his side. Not breaking eye contact with his mate he smiled, “Great minds think alike, ya?” Dropping his voice lower he muttered, “Soda’s for you, my little juice box.” Cheeks instantly burning Cas looked away from him, wide eyed and mouth gone dry.
It still hurt to leave knowing he wouldn’t see her again though. Knowing that this time next week he’d be in a new city, in a new hospital with new coworkers. A new life. There was an unpleasant churning in his stomach at that thought. He would once again be the new guy. The outcast who didn’t belong.
See being mated, they didn’t have to technically get married. They were already together, till death do them part and all the jazz because as Cas had mentioned many times before, Angels mated for life. Even little Graceless, earthbound Omegas, but Dean wasn’t an Angel. Though he did believe in mating for life, he just— had other customs he wanted as well.
“Chuck’s?” But that wasn’t right. Dean had left him. He’d broken his promise and went to someone else. He’d… hadn’t he? Wasn’t that how he’d justified the— fuck. No wonder that frantic look was so familiar. Dean thought he’d taken them again. He thought-- “Didn’t do it.”
“Just having a little chat.” Then he was sauntering out the door with a careless wave of his hand. Once the door clicked back into place Dean was across the room and dropped to his knees beside Cas. His hands flew to his cheeks and forced Cas to look up at him.
“It’ll be just a moment, Dr. Novak. I hope the transfer goes smoothly and you get settled in quickly enough.” He didn’t even bother with a fake smile. She wouldn’t be able to see it and it wasn’t like his eyes were hiding anything.
It didn’t matter though. No matter how many precautions they took. No matter how they limited access to the floor. In the past ten months, their usual number of pregnancies barely reached a third of what it once was. Of those that were able to conceive, few of the babies born had survived, and not without major complications. When examined the mothers were devastated to learn they were all but barren. Blame was placed on the hospital at first. Then tensions rose when other areas started reporting the same information.
Once he was in the elevator Cas let out a long breath and slumped against the wall, his hands shoved into his lab coat pockets. He was so ready to go home. Go home, drink a nice big glass of limoncello spiked tea and go the fuck to bed for the next fourteen hours. First he had to get through this ‘emergency meeting’ with Naomi though. He really hoped it wasn’t another budget cut. He really, really hoped not.
.” He spat, “When Cas, your Castiel, asks you to claim him? And he will, ask you, beg you,” He leveled him with an almost heartbreaking glare, his muddy eyes clouded with some memory only he was privy too, “Fucking do it. Don’t fucking hesitate. Don’t say the time isn’t right. Don’t say you fucking
About an hour later Dean heard the door open and shut again with a quiet click. He didn’t bother looking up from his spot on the bed as the soft footsteps grew closer. He merely set the worn photograph down on the side table and pat the mattress beside himself. Cas sunk into his side in an instant and the smell of weed stung his senses.
Content Omega was back and the Alpha in Dean preened at being the cause of it. “Now come on. Help me finish up cooking before Sam and Eileen get here.”
Taking in heaving breaths Cas glared at the floor between them as Wes stood up straighter. In the doorway Dean’s eyes narrowed, the happy grin slipped away instantly. “What’s going on here then?” Flashing the hunter a condescending smile, Wes stepped over and clapped him on the shoulder. Dean glanced at it briefly before sweeping his eyes back over to where Cas was slumped against the wall. A quick look over him and he seemed unharmed, if not a little rumpled. Then his eyes fell to the broken feather about two feet away and his blood ran cold.
Castiel sits upright, slender fingers reaching inside the bands of Dean’s pants and boxers to gently push them down over his ass and down  his bow legs, cock springing free from its constraints. Cas throws them haphazardly over his shoulder before settling on his belly in between Dean’s knees.
Cas ducks his head. “It was an accident, I assure you,” and Dean can’t help but feel a little bad for the guy.
Sam smiles and nods once. “Yeah,” he says with a small chuckle. Because he knows. Of course he knows.
“Whoa, hey, all right. Just relax. Dean?” He faintly feels Sam’s hand cover his, trying to shake him out of his trance. But it doesn’t work, and he’s suddenly aware of the blood roaring in his ears, his heart racing, and the quickening pace of his breathing, but oxygen isn’t getting into his lungs, and he can’t hear anything anymore and he’s staring down the rabbit hole again.
“Seriously though, just tell it like it happened? They’re just trying to get an accurate timeline of the changes. What we have is something they haven’t seen yet.” Beside him Cas tapped idly at his keyboard, eyes narrowed at the screen in thought. Dean could feel the waves of irritation wafting off of him and continued before the other could speak, “And before you complain about it, they specifically asked for the Omega’s account since your senses are what changed more.”
“I’ve been working on my Master’s for a while.  It’s been a few years, but I’m working full-time, so…” Dean scratched at the back of his head.
With Cas and Blueberry, it had been love at first sight.  Dean was sure that only the threat of their surprisingly competent HR department was the only thing that kept some of his coworkers—Zachariah, mostly—from making fun of him, a grown and outwardly stereotypically-masculine man, the first time they saw Blueberry on camera.  To be fair, Dean himself would have never guessed that he would one day share his apartment with a pet rabbit.  However, the dual force of Sam and his seven-year-old niece Sadie’s puppy eyes after Sadie had turned out to be allergic to her birthday present had been too much for even Dean’s curmudgeonly facade.  With only a token protest and much grumping, Dean had become Blueberry’s human.
And he was one of the only people in the world who could do that for him.  And dammit, Cas deserved to be happy and comfortable in his own skin.  He was kind, passionate, caring...
and get a damn pride flag to hang from his fire escape, while Benny, Jo, Charlie, Ash, Garth, and Victor would immediately begin cashing in on their bets (because no, contrary to popular belief, Dean was not stupid, and he knew full well that his friends had been betting on his sexuality for years).  Bobby and Ellen, who had practically been his parents since he was nine years old, would probably roll their eyes and grumble something along the lines of “good for you, princess,” and then slip him an extra slice of pie and hug him just a tad too long to be entirely fluffy-feelings-free.
it.  Ever state was documented, every system behavior confirmed, making Dean’s job on the software development side of things that much easier.  And Castiel himself, relaxed and confident, was a sight to behold - azure eyes sparkling, broad shoulders straight, hand gestures both decisive and elegant.  Dean’s breath regularly caught while watching Castiel on days like this, the knowledge that he was on camera the only deterrent to the goofy smile that kept creeping onto his face.
3)  Just because there’s snow on the roof doesn’t mean there isn’t a fire in the furnace.  And finally,
Dean’s eyes had been on Castiel’s mouth, but they now rose to meet his eyes once more.  Their gazes locked, and—and years may have gone by outside their sphere of awareness, the apocalypse may have finally come to pass, and neither would have noticed.  Castiel could have remained drifting in a jade sea for eons.  Neither seemed inclined to move, just quietly basking in the warmth of each other’s eyes.
“Benny, you remember what I said, right?  No matter where I am or what time it is, you call me and I’ll come.”  Benny gave a choked laugh and gulped at his coffee, wincing at the burn.
Benny was a stress-cleaner.  Andrea had once joked that if Benny and Dean were both upset at the same time, it meant no household chores for her for a week as long as she invited Dean over; Benny would dust and mop and polish and scrub to his heart’s content, while Dean would stress-cook his way through a week’s worth of multi-course meals and ten different kinds of pie.
It was small work asking Pops for the rest of the day off.  Bobby Singer knew his kids, and he knew full well that Dean wouldn’t just ditch work for no reason -- he had raised him better than that after all.  Dean’s pale face, hand still clutched around his phone, had been all the reason he needed to bestow a “well, go on then, idjit,” upon his eldest and see him off.  That boy needed to stop working weekends, anyway.
A couple things -- one, since this story takes place in current times, and Dean is 27 years old (I'm changing that in previous chapters as well, since I had put him as 26, before) I'm messing with birth years a bit.  Dean was born in 1990, Sam in 1994, and Jo in 1995.  Sound good?  Okay.
“I’m an accountant,” Castiel was saying, with a little self-deprecating laugh.  “Not the most glamorous job, I know, but I like numbers and patterns and such, and I like helping people manage their businesses.”
man who was now asking if Dean was feeling better now and did he think the bacon turned out alright?  Dean gave a stuttered reply that yes, he was better now and the bacon was delicious, thank you, and Castiel’s answering smile, rather than setting Dean on edge, instead coaxed out another tentative smile of his own.
, his brain chirruped unhelpfully) bedsheets and escaping through the window.  Further inspection, however, left him feeling rather like a idiot (
Sam had taken Jack to town that day, because “he needs to meet people his own age” (“He’s nine weeks old, Sammy!”  “You know what I mean!”).  Dean and Castiel had been left to tend to the house.  Castiel had been on his hands and knees, attempting to remove a stubborn stain from the living room carpet and wishing he still had the power to
And that had been that.  Dean had gotten a Bachelor’s Degree in business management, which he had put to work at Bobby’s garage.  And hell, he loved working as a mechanic, he really did, but…he didn’t want to do it every day for the rest of his life.  It had been two years before he had realized that Gordon’s
The internalized homophobia was a bit more difficult to crack.  From what Castiel had been able to deduce over the years, John Winchester had had a very specific idea of how his children should behave.  Castiel assumed that Dean was wary of what John’s opinion of his sexuality might have been, although Sam had privately confided that he was fairly certain that John wouldn’t have cared one way or the other as long as Dean could still kill monsters and protect his little brother.  Nevertheless, Dean had picked up a convoluted impression of masculinity from his father that seemed to exude heteronormativity like a strong odor.  Castiel found it absurd that so many humans seemed to associate a certain brand of masculinity with heterosexuality, but he acknowledged the power of such enforced assumptions on an individual’s outlook and self-identity.
It had been settled before Dean had even extended his spontaneous offer of friendship.  One look at Cas’s sad-teddy-bear-face when he’d mentioned leaving and that had been it.
that sent Dean right back into the outright giggles that he had been attempting, purple-faced, to curtail.
A hand on his left shoulder had him looking back up again at Cas’s soft, understanding expression.  “It’s okay, Dean.”  He said quietly.  “You don’t have to tell me.”
, but it was faint, as if being shouted over a long distance.  The rest of Dean’s brain, including his – ahem – downstairs brain, was content to bask in the aroma and delectable sizzle of bacon, the adorable (
When a very confused Jack (an embarrassed and smug Sam on his heels) asked them what they were doing half an hour later, they still had not moved from the floor.
Dean frowned again.  Sam would never know, because Dean was never going to tell him, and Cas was never going to tell him, because Sam and Cas would never meet, just like Jo and Cas would never meet, because Dean was never going to see Cas again.  He quickly finished his drink and set the glass down on the table.
, he nearly missed the fact that there were two sets of clothes scattered throughout the bedroom – after all, he was too busy puzzling out how exactly his boxer-briefs had ended up dangling from a lampshade in the corner.  Once his brain caught up, he stumbled to a halt, one leg still hanging out of last night’s jeans, to the realization that
“I’m pissed at them both, yeah, but we had already agreed to go our separate ways.  We grew apart, and it’s shitty as hell, but that’s what it is, and we’re better for it.”  Benny drew a hand down his face and sighed, the fire seeming to drain from his demeanor all at once.  “That don’t make it any easier, mind.  I mean, my ex-girlfriend wants my stepdad?  My stepdad went after my ex?  What the fuck is this, Dr. Sexy?”  Dean bristled at the jab, but remained silent.  This wasn’t the time or place.
“No, no!  I like it.”  Castiel looked thoughtful.  “My older brothers call me ‘Cassie,’ and I never thought it suited me much.”  Dean looked him over.
All right, let's go!  Now up:  more Dean backstory! (after this, a chapter from Cas's POV, and then things will FINALLY start to move forward!)
and floppy-haired, gangly-limbed hugs.  His friends, of course, had clapped him on the back, done a few celebratory shots, and promptly informed him that he showed up for Game Night when he had homework to be doing, they would all collectively kick his ass.
Dean made his way past the living room, clinging to the walls in a likely futile attempt to make himself less conspicuous.  So focused was he on his virtually nonexistent stealth tactics that he failed to notice the low, slightly off-key humming until he glanced through the door on his left…
Dean smiled again at Blueberry.  “Let’s get you some hay, Miss Blueberry, yes?  And a sandwich for me, and—”
The man hadn’t moved yet, apparently still frozen in surprise.  Now that the initial shock had worn off, Dean examined the not-quite stranger’s face.  Dark stubble dotted an angular jaw and slightly cleft chin.  Those stunning eyes that had held Dean rooted to the spot sat above high, sculpted cheekbones, a narrow, slightly aquiline nose, and plush, chapped lips.  A tongue peeked out to wet the bottom lip, and then Dean watched, fascinated, as a wide, gummy smile slowly crept onto the man’s face, eyes crinkling, his entire being exuding warmth.  It was, Dean thought faintly, like watching day break over a deep, vibrant sea.
“There’s my girl!  There’s my Blueberry!” cooed Cas through the camera.  Dean’s heart gave a little flutter that had nothing to do with how Blueberry was now stretching up on her hind legs to nibble at his face.  He scritched his sweet girl behind the ears as she nuzzled him, all the while melting under Castiel’s besotted gaze.
A quick peek into the bathroom revealed no hints about his host’s whereabouts, and after quickly using the facilities himself, Dean slowly and carefully finished dressing as silently as he could manage, cursing himself under his breath when he knocked over a wicker laundry basket.  Because his suburban, bee-keeping, gay mystery lover had a
“I’m not…” Cas paused.  “I’m not very good at buddy stuff, Dean.  My only ‘buddies’ are my siblings, and only because I’ve known them long enough to not be too awkward around them. Otherwise, I'm...”  He crossed him arms slightly, an almost defensive gesture.  Dean squinted.
“I’ve never had coconut water, but if you think it could gank this hangover, I’d be willing to try it.”
Poor Benny.  He (and a lot of Dean and Cas's friends and family, actually) have long roads ahead of them.  This is a primarily Destiel fic, but there's more going on there, too. XD
Which made Dean’s current predicament difficult to explain.  He definitely wouldn't have gone home with a guy if he'd been sober -- he was firmly in the closet and in the closet he would stay, thankyouverymuch. No need to get mixed up with society’s homophobic bullshit when he liked women just as well as men.  It was simpler to allow his bisexuality to express itself through an unhealthy obsession with Dr. Sexy, and reserve dating and sex for women.
Dean parked outside Benny’s condo and approached cautiously, unsure of what he would find.  He had extracted a promise from Benny, back at rehab --
“Brother…”  Dean pulled him into a hug, and Benny buried his face in Dean’s shoulder.  He didn’t cry.
I'M SO SORRY, GUYS!  Life has been crazy, and it's about to get crazier, so don't expect regular updates.  Still, I hope you enjoy this chapter!  We're back to Dean's POV, with no Cas :(   HOWEVER, we do see Dean and Benny having the friendship they freaking deserved.
Castiel had to be intelligent as well as kind and considerate and in possession of quirky salt-and-pepper shakers and
The man’s rumbling voice cut through Dean’s examination of his placemat.  “I’m just going to make some scrambled eggs.  It’s the fastest way I know how to make them, and we’d best get some food in you quickly.  The bacon’s just about done, too.”
.  After that fiasco with Gordon…but he didn’t want to think about that now.  Too much ugliness, too many memories…not to mention the stereotypes.  Dean knew that there was nothing wrong with being effeminate, for both men and women, but back during his tentative foray out of the closet, he had been flabbergasted by the assumptions made by strangers about his hobbies, personality, and even preferred sex positions.
In the book, the children being whipped with the tagliatelle grande had insisted that the sensation was indeed a “wet slap” and not a “sting” -- a dull
"Prototypes have been uploaded to the shared folder, along with all specs, agile release prioritization, and original requirements documentation.  All that remains now is to log a ticket."
When he opened his eyes, however, Dean received another shock – while he had been collecting himself, the man had advanced another few feet and was now standing about half a step in front of him, brilliant blue eyes now peering closely into Dean’s own.  Dean yelped and stumbled backwards, and he would have collided with the doorframe had the man’s right hand not shot out to grip his left arm, just below the shoulder.

No surprises, no last-minute edge cases, no major feasibility issues.  Handoff meetings at this company had an unfortunate tendency to uncover nasty surprises, although that typically wasn't due to any failing on Castiel's part. Zachariah, the product-manager-who-thought-he-was-a-
“Are you sure you are well?  You seem a bit disoriented.”  The man frowned slightly, studying Dean’s face as if he meant to derive the secrets of the universe from the patterns in Dean’s freckles.  He then tilted his head slightly in a display of altogether too much cuteness for someone already so sexy.  Fuck, Dean was so screwed.
Which was how, after his biological father’s latest in a series of sporadic visits to assuage his guilt for dumping Sam and Dean with Bobby and Ellen’s seventeen years ago, Dean had found himself drinking alone, before Castiel had found him.

At first, Ellen and Bobby, while listening in to these storytime sessions, had worried that the pessimistic nature of these books would sink Dean further into his own head.  However, after a time, it seemed as if they had done the opposite.  The lesson Dean had seemed to be taking from the trials of the Baudelaires was that
He had been right; Dean was feeling a little better.  He supposed that the sugar in the orange juice had done the trick, remembering Ellen once mentioning something about sugar being good for shock.  He was still hungover, for certain, but the blue-gaze-induced fuzziness and general what-the-fuckery had cleared up considerably.
In all the time Castiel had spent human, he had suffered numerous indignities that would make his siblings’ grace quiver with disgust – urination and defecation, of course, were the first and most obvious instances that sprung to mind, but Castiel had been far more inconvenienced by such numerous additional annoyances as the way his sweaty thighs stuck together on hot days, the itch that formed at the base of his oily hair after too many days without a shower, and the smell the emanated from under his arms after half a day without washing or deodorant.  These phenomena plagued Castiel far worse than any bathroom activities, because (with a few notable exceptions that had involved eating what expired foods he could find in various dumpsters while homeless) he had at least SOME control over the latter – with the former, it was a constant battle to maintain composure despite the involuntary, uncontrollable responses of his all-too-human body.
After their father had dumped Sam and Dean with Bobby and his (at the time) new wife, Ellen, and stepdaughter, Jo, Dean had done his very, very best to prove that he could be good, that he could take care of Sammy, so that his Dad would be proud of him when he came back.  He had never even taken seconds at meals unless explicitly offered, no matter how his eyes lingered on the serving dish, and had instead insisted that Sammy and Jo (of whom he was quickly becoming just as fiercely protective) take what they needed.

read, but taking so much time for himself had left him uneasy, even when both he and his siblings were all being well taken care of, courtesy of Bobby and Ellen.  Thus, he had sat with five-year-old Sam and four-year-old Jo, reading aloud to them for hours of the Baudelaires’ misfortunes.
Perhaps they had still had some growing to do; with everything surrounding Benny’s drinking and rehab and Andrea getting her feet under her after grad school and getting a job, their individual growth seemed to have been put on hold.  Once Benny had successfully completed rehab and Andrea and settled in with her new job...well...Dean didn’t know.  Perhaps they just didn’t fit like they used to.
Now, fifteen minutes later, Castiel was still perched delicately on the carpet, glaring at Dean, who was seated cross-legged before him, attempting to yet again reign in his snickers.  So it had gone for the entire fifteen minutes, since every new

Dean winced as his knees hit the back of the seat in front of him.  He despised riding the bus.  It was too cramped, too smelly, too full of half-awake strangers...stil, better to ride the busthen have discovered that he had driven the Impala drunk last night.  He perched at the edge of his seat, squished uncomfortably against the window to make room for the older woman sitting beside him.  He sighed quietly, not wanting to appear rude or irritated; it wasn’t
“How do you like your eggs?” he intoned in the same deep, gravelly voice that Dean hazily remembered whispering filth into his ear the night before.
“You just said you were craving a drink.  I’m not leaving you alone like this.”  A corner of Benny’s mouth twitched up, but there was no humor in it.
In that moment, Dean wanted nothing more than to pull Cas in for a hug.  He quickly tamped down on that sudden, inexplicable urge and instead cleared his throat again, and said, “we don’t have to do anything special, Cas.  Just more of this,” he gestured vaguely between them, “just minus the…you know…”
“Before or after I called?”  Dean forced himself to maintain his outward calm.  Andrea wasn’t Benny’s rock anymore -- that meant that Dean had to be.
.  Great, so the one guy who managed to circumvent Dean’s self-imposed closed-for-assfucking embargo also apparently had his life together enough that he went around buying things like
As you may know, these days I only ever post one-shots MAYBE once or twice in as many years.  Life is not conducive to me committing to and writing an entire long fic right now, much as I wish I could.  But I will leave what I have up.
“What do I always do?  Told him to stuff it and got shitfaced.” Dean snapped, then mentally slapped himself.  “Sorry.”
Unbidden, a fuzzy memory from the night before of Cas holding him down as he slowly fucked into him drifted to the forefront of his mind.  Dean felt heat rising to his face and shifted a bit, smiling apologetically when he jostled the woman beside him.  He knew why that particular memory had surfaced at that particular moment -- very few people were large enough to manhandle Dean the way he liked, so it was small wonder that thoughts of his size had triggered such a memory.  He didn’t consider himself to be very much into BDSM, but he liked the sensation of being covered, of having someone else’s weight on top of him, of being held and caressed and solid, safe, secure…okay,
Together, they breathed, allowing their chests to rise and fall against each other.  Castiel, still running his fingers through Dean’s hair, wondered at this very human need to interrupt such a pleasurable activity for something as essential as breathing.  Not that it was unpleasant to lie here beneath his love.
in favor of generously sprinkling his eggs with pepper from the chicken-shaped shaker.  All previous thoughts of escaping were swept away by Castiel’s enthusiasm and the admittedly fantastic meal.  Instead, Dean found himself chatting amiably with his very male drunken hookup over eggs and bacon.  The easy chatter almost felt
While Cas fetched him some coconut water, Dean glanced down at his bare feet.  Breakfast was pretty much over now, and he would have to go soon.  Somehow, he wasn’t surprised to find that he didn’t want to leave.
But when he peeked up at Castiel, now setting down a plateful of bacon and eggs on the little woven placemat before him, what he blurted out instead was:
He took a deep breath, allowing his eyes to briefly flutter shut to give a momentary respite from staring at the angel before him.  It was like looking into the sun, he absently mused, and Dean was almost worried that his eyes would burn out if he looked for too long.  He shook his head quickly, deciding firmly that it was too damn early for metaphors, then winced as the throbbing intensified with the jerky movement.
Benny dug around in his cupboards for mugs while Dean set the coffeemaker to work, all while grumbling about “fancy-ass hippy machines.”  At least Benny used his own coffee beans, and not that crap in the little plastic cups.
to eat as much as they wanted, that Dean had begun to shyly request seconds (and later, thirds) at dinner.  The way Dean’s eyes had bugged out during that conversation, however, had said quite enough about had John had raised his boys -- or rather, how Dean had raised Sam, at the cost of his own welfare.  Bobby and Ellen had confessed their worries and their suspicions to each other later that night, after the children were put to bed, and they had both decided that what Dean needed was to get out of his own head for a bit.
Technically, he knew that these had been bad experiences and were likely not indicative of the world at large, but it was too damn exhausting to deal with even the possibility of all that judgment and fucked up gender roles crap when he could just bury, suppress, and otherwise shove down his sexuality.  He could wear his sexy panties in the privacy of his own home and drool over the stars of crap medical dramas, and no one was the wiser.
“Look, Cas, I had a great time, but I really do have to go now.”  Cas’s face fell so quickly it would have been comical, if Dean hadn’t felt so guilty.  “Not that I want to,” because he really didn’t, “but, um…I can’t…”
Castiel’s pinched brows had now turned upwards, lips parted in concern.  Dean dragged a hand down his face.

became a tradition in the Singer-Harvelle-Winchester household.  Every time a new book came out, Dean would read it aloud, long after it was socially acceptable to snuggle with one’s siblings.  No matter how on-the-outs they were (and Sam and Jo’s constant bickering ensured that that happened at least once a week), they would pile together without fail to hear Dean read about the increasingly miserable lives of the Baudelaire children.
Human nature being what it is, every society has developed multitudinous ways to express the unique sentiment of Proverb.  Four well-known instances are:
Dean allowed his eyes to fall shut.  The breath he had been reserving to call for help, should Benny need it, now escaped harshly.  He had known it would happen, but…
The man was still humming in a low gravelly voice, barely audible over the sizzle of the bacon (and really, how had Dean not smelled that coming down the hall?!) swinging his hips in a happy little dance to the tune, and Dean found himself watching him sway, mesmerized.  Some part of his brain was still clamoring that he needed to
“Even if she’s got shit taste in men.”  Dean cuffed Benny’s ear with the hand not currently wiping coffee off the kitchen table.
Lastly, this might not be the most appropriate place for it, but all my love goes to the victims of Hurricane Maria and the Las Vegas Shooting.  I am outraged on the behalf of everyone who has been affected by these events, and ashamed of our government for its responses to both.

“Yeah, you’re much more of a ‘Cas’ than a ‘Cassie.’”  Cas blushed under Dean’s scrutiny and handed over the Excedrin.
“Mm-hm.  Feeling better now?”  Dean paused, surveying the kitchen, allowing memories of this morning drift to the forefront of his mind.
Castiel lost his precarious balance with the force of the hiccup, pulling Dean down in a tangle of limbs and startled yelps.  The unruly heap settled with a series of grunts that eventually tapered off into oppressive silence and physical discomfort.
No matter how dangerous, terrifying, or absurd the adventures ofthet three heroes, they always managed to save each other by relying on their own skills and taking care of their siblings, even if it meant making increasingly morally ambiguous choices in the name of love.  Dean had even begun to draw parallels between his own family and the Baudelaire siblings by the time he was twelve, with himself as Violet, the eldest, most mechanically-minded sibling (he was already showing promise as a mechanic under Bobby’s tutelage), Sam as Klaus, the middle child and brilliant bookworm, and Jo as Sunny, the baby of the family and the “biter” (Jo didn't bite, but at seven years old, she was a year into karate training and had begun to show a worrisome level of interest in her mother's knives).
Also...it is with great sadness that I have learnt that my family will be traveling in August, and I cannot participate in GISHWHES.  Please, if you are gishing, gish a good gish for me.
Lips, hot and sweet, pressed gently against Castiel’s.  He, too, allowed his eyes to fall shut before moving against Dean, slotting their lips together in a soft caress.  Slowly, slowly, they moved together, the kiss building in passion as it became increasingly clear that neither was about to withdraw.  Dean’s hands gently cupped Castiel’s face for the second time that day, the lightness of his touch belying the thirst with which he sucked at Castiel’s bottom lip and licked at the seam of his mouth.  Castiel lifted his arms from the floor and clutched one arm around Dean’s shoulders and dug the other into his hair with a fervor that elicited a gasp and a moan from the man above him.  Castiel nibbled lightly at Dean’s lips and sighed against him in bliss.  Again and again, their lips chased each other, each press seeming to hum,

It hadn’t been until Bobby had sat him down privately, one night after dinner, and gently explained to him that
Dean was vacillating alarming between falling even closer into Castiel’s orbit and withdrawing as if in fear of reproach.  Castiel’s resurrection had been a whirlwind of tears, hugs, and
“And I’ll deal with that like a big boy!  Yeah, it fuckin’ sucks.  But she didn’t cheat, and she didn’t lie, and she was honest the whole time, and she’s
They had both frozen.  Castiel had paled even further, while Dean’s jaw had dropped, and he had slowly lifted his hands from where they rested on Cas’s face.
Dean’s throat unexpectedly tightened at this unchecked show of support from a complete stranger.  True, had had played Genital Tetris with this stranger last night, but Castiel didn’t know anything about Dean, and yet he still seemed to wholeheartedly believe in him.  Dean stared down at his plate, biting his lip.
Dean, with all the experience afforded by his twenty-seven years, was more-or-less familiar with many such Universal Rules.  They shaped his perspective, acting as measurements along the edge of his moral compass, immutable, indisputable, unshakable.  Four such rules were:
“You’re covered in grease, brother, a little snot ain’t gonna make no difference.” Benny muttered into his chest.  Dean huffed a laugh, and Benny gave a watery chuckle and began extricating his arms from where they’d wormed their way around Dean’s waist.  Dean stepped back and carried their mugs to the sink before rooting around for a washcloth to mop up their spilled coffee.
Dean was secure in his masculinity; he had no problem with certain shades of pink in moderation, he cooed over puppies and babies, and a few lonely stay-at-home nights ago, he had discretely bought a few pairs of satiny, lacy panties that were carefully folded, wrapped in an old sweatshirt, and buried under a pile of dirty socks at the back of his closet.  What he couldn’t stand was being pigeonholed.  Yeah, he liked men.  Yeah, he liked bottoming and wearing panties.  Yeah, he loved being called “good boy” and having his hair petted and his cheeks kissed and…but anyway, it was irritating that anyone with any kind of inkling about his preferences assumed that he would speak with a lisp and have an entirely incomprehensible infatuation with glitter.  The raised brows and judgmental stares he had received once he revealed himself to be a loud, brash mechanic with a give ‘em hell attitude and
Now that I have a better idea of where I'm going with this, I've added in Jo's name where appropriate.
The next day, Ellen had approached Dean immediately after breakfast and told him to put on something nicer than his usual playclothes and meet her out by the car.  Dean, intrigued and slightly wary, had dressed himself in the new clothes that Bobby had bought for them the day after they had arrived and bundled himself down to the garage.  The ride to Downtown Lawrence had been filled with worry, which had immediately dispelled into confusion when they had pulled into the parking lot of the Lawrence Public Library.  From there, Ellen had ushered a subdued Dean into the building and parked him in the Children’s Section with firm orders to pick something.
He severed that line of thought before he scandalized the lady beside him with an inappropriate boner.  Because who popped a boner on a
Benny sighed and rubbed the back of his neck, dropping his gaze back down to the table.  Dean took the opportunity rake his eyes over the tear tracks that were now drying over his friend’s face, and is chest tightened.  He reached across the table to grip Benny’s arm.
Guess what?  You guys convinced me!  Thank you all for so much support and so many lovely comments and kudos!  I'm getting back into creative writing!  Throw a party!!
Dean crinkled his nose.  “Exactly.  I mean, I’ve still got issues, but if Ma and Pops hadn’t taken us in--”  He was cut off by the sound of Benny’s hand slapping the table and a stream of caustic French.
Eventually, they were forced apart by the need for air, and they panted lightly, their breath colliding between them in little bursts.  Castiel’s lips curved up lazily, while Dean’s eyes were warm above him, crinkling at the corners in a sweet smile.  Castiel lifted a hand and brushed Dean’s hair from his forehead, and Dean nuzzled into the touch and kissed his palm.
Benny sighed.  “It’s just cathartic, you know?  She got me through so much...I’d probably have died of alcohol poisoning by now, the way I was going, if you two hadn’t been there…” he shuddered.  “She’s a good person, Dean.  Just because we weren’t right for each other don’t make her evil.”
Benny’s lips twitched in a bitter facsimile of a smile.  “Andrea and I haven’t been in love for months, brother.  Everything that happened, we talked it through.”  A tremor appeared in his voice, and Dean’s heart ached.  “We did right by each other by letting each other go, and I jus’ wish…” his voice broke, “I jus’ wish it didn’t have to hurt this much--” his shoulders began shaking and his face crumpled.
Castiel, in all his previous experiences as a human, had somehow managed to avoid the peculiar, ubiquitous, and downright
Dean didn’t have to please John anymore.  He didn’t have to be Sammy’s parent and make sure he got fed, because that wasn’t a fifteen-year-old’s job.  He didn’t have to be some hypermasculine child-soldier, hiding the fact that he liked baking and the color pink for fear of his father’s disgust.  He had the best baby sister in the world (although he’d never tell her so), and he was about to start high school with no fear of moving three weeks in.  Dean had a family, and a home, and love, and that would never change.
be him, given I had to do half his job in addition to my own.”  He straightened up and leaned over his laptop on one elbow.  His smirk softened to a smaller, warm smile.  Dean rarely saw that smile emerge in group settings, but quarantine became just a bit less lonely every time Cas sent it his way.
“Dean, that’s wonderful!  What are you studying?”  And damn if Castiel didn’t look genuinely curious.
“I was in rather terrible shape when I woke this morning.  I had a bit of an upset stomach, but I didn’t want to wake you, so I used the bathroom in the hall.  Would you pass the pepper?  It’s the chicken-shaped one.”
There are rules, and there are Rules, profound truths that none can dispute, yet everyone has seen ripped to shreds at least once.  No one truly knows where they came from, and no one understands what to do when one such Rule is broken immediately before them.  Numbering amongst such brittle, ubiquitous rules are:
.  Dean had snorted despite himself and taken the book down.  A crease had appeared between his eyes at the absurdity of the summary on the back cover, before he had decided that he might as well, and brought it over for approval.  Ellen had raised her brows a bit at the pessimistic title, but had agreed to put the book on her card.
Not that Dean thought that his friends and family wouldn’t be supportive – far from it.  Sammy would in all likelihood pull out the puppy eyes and try to talk about
Obviously, he had not told Sam and Jo about this last rule.  As far as his little brother was concerned, there were only Three Cardinal Rules, and Dean was determined that it stay that way.  His siblings did NOT need to know that Dean wasn’t exactly a Kinsey 0.
Castiel had dropped the scrub brush at the first hitched squeak in a near panic and clutched at his throat, convinced that he was experiencing some serious respiratory malfunction.  Dean, who had burst through the doorway to find Castiel on the floor, clutching at his throat, had flown across the room and taken Castiel’s face into his hands, breathing his name in terror, before—
“Hey.”  Benny flicked his eyes up, looking suddenly exhausted.  “Go get washed up and I’ll make you dinner, okay?”
happening?” Castiel had asked tremulously.  Dean had stared at him in awe, his hands shaking with leftover adrenaline.  His face, which had gone pale in his panic, was now flushed with relief.
As soon as they were the only ones remaining on the call, Cas let out a whoop and collapsed back in his chair, laughing with his hands thrown above his head in overexaggerated relief.  The position revealed the usually half-obscured poster in the background -
Dean winced as the triple-pop of the Slack notification sounded again, signaling the fifth ignored message from Cas.
“Okay, okay!  Sorry, shutting up now!”  Dean wiped the tears from his eyes, and sighed, gazing across the scant two feet of space between them, the merriment still present in his eyes.
Dean’s senses were assaulted by an avalanche of the sights, sounds, and smells as his preoccupation with
“This isn’t funny, Dean!”  Castiel growled menacingly, only to punctuate his declaration with another squeaking
Castiel started, perhaps at the unexpected forcefulness in Dean’s tone, and relaxed again with a sheepish grin.
moment had hit him.  He had been in the middle of Carmelita Spats’s dance recital, and Sam and Jo had been snorting their amusement as Dean had punctuated Carmelita’s off-pitch caterwauling by sloppily blowing raspberries, intending to replicate the “wet slap” of the “tagliatelle grande.”  Dean had been giggling between raspberries as well, but the three of them had simultaneously given up on containing their laughter had all collapsed all in a heap, breathless with laughter and with tears streaming down their faces.  That was when it had happened.
“Shut up, you know I don’t care about that crap.  You try growing up with Jo as your little sister and making it out un-neutered with a ‘girl stuff is gross’ attitude.  ‘Sides, Sheriff Mills?  Biggest chick-flick fan I’ve ever met, and it don’t make her any less scary than my Ma.  You need a chick-flick moment, we’ll have a fucking chick-flick moment, and screw everyone else.”
clicked into place after five years of quietly, subconsciously nursing the desperate hope that Dad would deem his children worthy, and coming back for them.
Now that I have a better idea of where I'm going with this, I've added in Jo's name where appropriate.
The drive to Benny’s was a blur.  Benny and Andrea had been “taking a break” for four months now, and Dean wasn’t even sure how it had happened.  Andrea...Andrea had been Benny’s rock while he was getting sober.  She had visited him in rehab, she and Dean had coordinated his homecoming and subsequent re-entry into society, everyone in their friend group had admired her drive...and somewhere, in the midst of it all they had just...drifted.  It had been so subtle that no one outside of Benny and Andrea themselves had even noticed it until it had become obvious how much they had both changed.
Not his sexuality, though.  He wasn’t quite ready to make that knowledge public just yet.  Not after what happened last time.  But going back for his Master’s…well, he could handle that.
Shaking himself, he continued making his way through the house, wincing at the light pouring in through the artfully furnished living room and spotting the front door – and his shoes – in relief.  Now, the final stretch.
Uncertainty had begun to erode the edges of the man’s smile, and he now set the tongs down and took a step forward, a crease appearing between his eyes as he gazed at Dean with concern.  “Are you all right?”
A tentative hand on his had him looking back up into worried blue eyes.  “Did I upset you?” Castiel asked softly.  Dean grimaced and quickly shook his head.
Dean’s eyes snapped up to lock on a startled electric blue gaze, all previous contentedness forgotten as every fear and insecurity came tumbling back with a roar.  Rule Number Four was dying a screaming death, and yet he found himself unable to move, pinned under the scrutiny of those terrifyingly beautiful eyes.  He was dimly aware of the heat rising to his cheeks, and he yanked his gaze downward, revealing a yet more acres of toned, unfairly beautiful skin.  He blushed harder, and looked back up.
So one night, he had approached Bobby after closing the garage and had hesitantly, after much prompting from the old curmudgeon, whispered his aspirations.  From there, Bobby and Ellen had practically kicked his ass into the GRE testing room, and now, here he was, taking classes at KU and working full-time at Bobby’s to pay for it.  Sammy, of course, had been delighted, and Dean had been subjected to a night of puppy eyes and
“But you’re so…” Dean thought back to Cas’s effortless grace as he moved around the kitchen, the easy way he made conversation smiled across the breakfast table and cared for Dean while he suffered from the effects of last night’s drinking…the way he had skillfully manhandled Dean the night before until he was screaming, begging…
, with a Calvin Klein label peeping out from the back.  He was well-muscled, but not overly so, like the juiceheads that had occasionally hit on Dean in his younger, prettier days.  The man’s skin was tanned, with light freckles here and there, and his neck, which was bent over the stove, was long and graceful.  His black hair spoke of a wild romp in the sheets, and Dean found himself grinning proudly at the knowledge that
Cas tilted his head, as though he were considering Dean’s proposal carefully. He paused, then slowly nodded as a small smile crept back onto his face. God, Dean hadn't realized how much he had missed that smile until it had returned, settling back into the fine lines around Cas's eyes and rounding out his sharp features.
Sam had been elated to follow Dean’s lead and start referring to Ellen and Bobby as “Ma” and “Pops,” while Jo (sticking to Mommy and Daddy) had knocked them both over the head and had proclaimed, to their amusement, that it was “about damn time!”  Which, of course, had led to a lecture from Ellen about swearing -- Ellen didn't have a problem with swearing herself, but she would be damned if her children used curse words before they could understand their meanings or implications.
It hit him then, though, that between one forkful of eggs and the next, Dean had completely forgotten to be awkward.  Again, he held his tongue not wanting to be the jerk that wiped the smile from Castiel’s face, and
Back when he was with Gordon…well, the man had laughed when Dean had confessed that he had been thinking about switching majors to get a teaching certificate during his undergrad.
the damned thing off, while Dean had fussed about in the kitchen.  That had been fifteen minutes ago.
“Let’s get you inside, okay?”  Benny nodded against Dean’s shoulder and pulled back to arm’s length.
Castiel’s body jolted below Dean’s, destabilizing Dean’s perch over Castiel and causing his arms to collapse further down, bringing his face ever closer.
“Nah, man, that’s cool.  I wouldn’t have the patience to crunch numbers all day, so I bet you must be pretty smart if you can.”  And Dean meant it, too, because
Dean quickly pushed their mugs out of the way and shimmied around the table to wrap his arms around his friend as the first sobs broke free.  They stayed in that position until the tears died away, Dean rocking Benny and making soothing noises, just as he had for Sam and Jo, growing up.  Benny wouldn’t let him curse Andrea out loud, and Dean knew she didn’t deserve it, but he wanted to rage against
“Well then,” Cas laughed, leaning forward conspiratorially and dropping his voice to a whisper, “we must ensure that Sam never knows.”
As far as Dean knew, Benny hadn’t had a drink in two years, but from the way he had sounded on the phone…
Cas returned with a glass of refrigerated coconut water, which he placed into Dean’s hand before stepping back to watch, expectantly.  This was more comfortable than Dean might have expected; after a morning spent under Cas’s scrutiny, Dean found that he was oddly comfortable under his unwavering gaze.  It was less like being examined, as he had initially thought, and more like being watched over, as a guardian angel might.  It was with considerably less self-consciousness, then, that Dean popped two Excedrin tablets into his mouth and took a tentative sip of the coconut water.  He swallowed, then frowned down at the glass.
“No, it’s…it’s different, but not bad.  Sweet.”  Dean took another, larger sip.  “I kinda like it.”  Cas sighed in relief, and Dean glanced over at him fondly.
was he so comfortable around Dean, then?  What exactly had happened at that bar?  Dean assumed that they had talked for at least a little while before making the the oh-so-smart decision to
And from there, it was a lost cause.  Somehow, Dean managed to forget his trepidation and his hangover and the fact that
“It’s been months, Dean.”  Benny avoided Dean’s eyes in favor of picking at a splinter along the edge of the table.  Dean absently made plans to buy sandpaper, but refocused on the matter at hand when Benny started picking at his nails.
would increase a progressively more irritated Castiel’s resemblance to a grumpy kitten, which in turn would send Dean into yet another fit of near hysterics.
The man squinted again, then chuckled.  “You don’t recall my name because I never gave it to you.  We were a bit preoccupied at the time.”  A quirk of the eyebrow.  “Nor did you give me yours, although I was hoping to have that honor now?”  Almost shyly, the man glanced down at the eggs, and flicked his eyes back up with a quirk of his mouth. “I’m Castiel.”
Finally settled at the kitchen table, Dean watched warily as Benny stirred four spoons of sugar into his coffee.  Wisely, he withheld his comments.  That was, in until Benny dropped his spoon and swore gratingly in French.
Dean grinned down at Blueberry.  “Oh, we will.”  He met Cas’s fond eyes once more as he reached to disconnect the call.  “Bye Cas, love you.”  He hung up.
Dean slowly released a breath, its heat searing across Castiel’s skin and ruffling his hair.  Castiel, still holding his breath, lifted his head slightly from the floor, eyes falling away from Dean’s and settling on his lips…and he waited.  His offer hovered silently between them; now it was for Dean to decide whether this would be their turning point.
Also, I've kind of had a love affair with coconut water ever since it cut my migraine recovery time in half.
Cocooned between them, quite worn out, Dean had sleepily asked if he could start referring to the two of them as his parents.  Not “Mom” and “Dad,” since those monikers would forever be associated with Mary and John Winchester, but “Ma” and “Pops,” perhaps?
As an angel, Castiel was a being of faith; as a human, that had not changed.  His faith in his Father had been replaced by faith in his friends, while his faith in the Host had been surmounted by faith in his own abilities and moral direction.  Castiel knew that his relationship with the elder Winchester was teetering on the brink, and he was content to wait for the inevitable.  His love for Dean would sustain him until Dean had resolved his inner turmoil and was ready to reciprocate wholeheartedly.
Castiel hesitantly opened eyes, then yelped and turned his head just in time to avoid being elbowed in the face as Dean’s arm crashed to the floor, leaving Dean’s face suspended a mere five inches above Castiel’s.
A smile slipped its way around Dean’s defenses before he could lock in his poker face.  “Yeah, I guess so.”
“Victoryyyy!” Dean crowed as Cas spun slowly in his desk chair from the leftover momentum, arms still akimbo and smiling broadly.
Sam was irritated, Castiel knew.  Late at night, after reading Jack’s bedtime story and tucking him in with a kiss to the forehead, he would hear the brothers’ voices drifting up, Sam’s tone so clear that Castiel could easily picture its accompanying facial expression.  He was fairly certain Dean called it “bitchface,” but he wasn’t quite sure why.  Nevertheless, various phrases would float up the stairs as Castiel crossed the hall back to his bedroom every night, phrases like “another chance,” “know he feels the same,” and “don’t care that he’s a guy.”
Dean waved a dismissive hand.  “Yeah, yeah.  Anyway, from there, it was all ‘got a great gig at the garage,’ ‘too immature for this,’ and my personal favorite, ‘would you even know what to do with a bunch of kids?’  As if I wasn’t Sammy’s primary caregiver until I was
Dean’s new tears of exaltation and relief had mingled with the tears of laugher already streaked down his face, his raucous crowing devolving into sobs.  Sam and Jo, upon noticing the change, had become alarmed, Jo dashing off to find their parents, while Sam had practically draped himself across Dean’s shaking back in an attempt to soothe his brother.  Ellen and Bobby had practically flown up to the house at Jo’s shrieks of “GUYS HELP DEAN’S CRYING FOR NO REASON!!” and had sandwiched Dean in between them, holding him tight.  Piece by piece, they had pried Dean’s realization out of him, Dean apologizing profusely for not seeing it sooner and Bobby just barely managing to bite back the
Sam hadn’t understood much of the book’s dark humor at the time, although he had become very quiet when the Baudelaires’ parents had perished in the fire.  Dean had almost stopped reading at that point, but he had just
beenabout, anyway?  According to Cas, he was debilitatingly awkward around people he didn’t know very well, which included just about everyone in the world except for his siblings.  Why the
Firmly closing his mind to the possibility that he and his one-night stand had inadvertently broken into the wrong house (
I always intended to come back and finish this, but it's now been three years and I have to mark it on indefinite hiatus, because while I sill want to keep going on this one, it is so fucking unfair to string you all along.  I'm so sorry if I've given you false hope in the past three years.  That was never my intent.
Now having slightly regained his bearings, he glanced about the kitchen again, no less flabbergasted by this turn of events, but more capable of coherent thought.  He took in the cherry cabinets and stainless steel appliances, impressed despite himself at the granite countertops and hardwood floors.  More interesting, however, were the details; a much-loved set of recipe books in the corner by the toaster, the well-worn floral potholders suspended on a hook by the side of the fridge, and the antique-looking table that he was now seated at with a little salt-and-pepper shaker set in the shape of a cow and a chicken, surrounded by little woven placemats.
Cas smiled self-deprecatingly.  “Perhaps because we’ve already seen each other drunk and naked, but I’ve rather forgotten to be nervous and awkward around you.  Perhaps we skipped past it all while drunk.”  He glanced up and Dean from under his eyelashes.  “It seems that you put me quite at ease.”
They managed to get the last pies in the oven as they heard the bunker door open. Instantly loud arguing was heard and Dean shot Cas an amused smirk. “There is no way anyone could go to every house in a single night to deliver presents. Magic reindeer or not.” Claire growled with an eye roll as she sauntered  into the kitchen. Jack followed hot on her heels and a wide smile on his face.
Three years ago, the world started changing. A plague of the body and mind was discovered in China. A disease that started like a flu and morphed into something more. Something that would alter the course of history forever. Covid-19 killed many, over a third of the population wiped from existence.
Rolling his eyes Dean walked up behind him and circled his arms around his mates waist. Propping his chin on Castiel’s shoulder he pressed a soft kiss to his mating bite before peppering more kisses up the side of his neck and up to his temple. “Everything will be, Angel. You worry too much.”
It should be a heavenly smell, that much he knew from his own timeline. From his own Castiel. He’d caught a whiff of Castiel in pre-heat once before and it had been the best thing he’d ever smelled. The light touch of rose water mixing with vibrant clementines, and fresh rain. This? This just smelt wrong. Too strong. Too sweet. He wondered how his counterpart could stand being so close to it. How he could handle rubbing against the source. He felt sick at the very thought. That he could ever dislike the way Cas smelled.
Then Dean was raising to his feet and grabbing something hidden away in the uppermost branches of their tree. He cleared his throat and all eyes around the room snapped up to him. First on the box in his hand, then to his content smile and crinkled eyes and the rainbow lights haloing his blonde hair. Jack’s head tilted in confusion as Claire choked on her cocoa, eyes widening.
Looking up Dean, Cas pressed a hand against his mating bite. “You are distressed. Why are you distressed?” Turning to the younger Winchester he frowned, “What did you do?” Sam put his hands up and shook his head with a laugh.
Pivoting his body, Cas grabbed Dean’s cheeks and forced him to look him in the eye. He couldn't do it. He wouldn't do it. “You do this. Every year. You seclude yourself. You pull away, you push me aside when I try to help. What the hell am I then? If not your family, what the hell am I? You say you’re cursed to be alone every Christmas? Well whose fucking fault is that, Dean?” He pressed their foreheads together and let out a shaky puff of air, “I’m right fucking here.”
Popping the top off he dumped four on to his palm and stared at them. It’d been so long. He’d done so well, weaning himself off of them. For Dean. Always for Dean. His close brush with death one night on an accidental overdose made the tension between Dean and him snap.
“Oh ew, Dean! No, don’t even. I don’t need to know that.” Dean gave him a wolfish grin and waggled his eyebrows but the effect was lost when his scent dampened. “Mating habits aside,” He groaned, face twisting in disgust, “Have you talked about it while both of you are lucid?” Dean only shrugged and Sam pursed his lips, one eyebrow raised, “Why not, Dean?”
Then he was gone. The front door banging shut and leaving his parting words hanging in the air. It was suffocating. The realization that he hated the him that just walked out. The him who could hurt Cas like that but still try to make it right without really trying. He hated it almost as much as the burning rose petals surrounding him.
“All 5 babies were born with pointed ears.” Castiel dropped the papers and stared at her in shocked confusion. Naomi set the folder down with a sigh and folded her hands on top of it. There was a frustrated glint in her eyes. “2 males were born with red eyes. 2 females were born with the usual blue. 1 male was born with gold. Within 3 days after birth, their ears have morphed into a normal state. All eye color faded to their natural color within the first hour of being born.”
People blamed the vaccine next. The one that was supposed to help stop the spread. The one that was supposed to stop people from dying and it did. People weren’t dying from covid-19 anymore… they just also weren’t being born. Statements had been released that there was no correlation between the vaccine and the sudden sterilization of many. Statements that Castiel knew weren’t quite true, but he couldn’t prove it either. Statements that quite frankly, terrified him.
He wasn’t the best company anymore. He knew it, of course he knew it. He just thought that Dean understood him better than that. He thought they had reached an agreement. He thought— but apparently not.
He longed for the time he could press his nose into soft brown hair and smell home. “I can’t call you family, Cas.” He muttered after a moment of silence. Cas remained still and quiet where he was curled into his side. Dean wondered vaguely if Cas was too stoned to even register he was speaking. To his own disgust he hoped that was the case. Cas didn’t need to know. It’d only hurt him more. It’d only hurt them both more. That was after all, the curse Dean was forced to carry.
“That’s your pup, Dean.” The cocoa was dangerously close to tipping but neither of them noticed as the scent of joyous alpha saturated the air. “Merry Christmas.”
Dean watched Cas shake his head in exasperation before he picked up Dean and Sam’s mugs. He passed Sam his on the way past, the younger Winchester took it with a soft thank you. Pausing briefly by the tree Castiel picked up a small thin box that everyone had noticed, but hadn’t mentioned. Stopping beside Dean’s chair he held out the cup in one hand and the box in the other. Dean furrowed his brows when Castiel’s scent turned apprehensive and he quickly turned away to go back to the kitchen.
“Fuck.” Dean huffed, voice wavering to match his trembling hands. “Fuck.” He repeated louder and Cas almost wished he could see Dean’s expression but he was held firm, tucked up close to Dean’s neck. “Fuck, baby, no. I wasn’t— I didn’t— I went to Chuck’s.”
Reaching over the bed, Cas dug around under the mattress blindly. If Dean was allowed to break their promise, then so was he. If Dean was allowed to go sleep around again, Cas was allowed his Vicodin. His hand made contact with the small pill bottle and he smiled ruefully.
“My flight will get in at 7:45… are you sure you’ll be able to pick me up?” Castiel worried his bottom lip between his teeth as he folded the last of his shirts (the ones going with him on the flight at least) and shoved them into his suitcase. The answering cackle from the other end of the line was almost instant.
“Tori.” Dean growled out slowly, eyes taking inventory of everyone. Two people were missing. Wes and… “Where’s Cas.” The woman looked away, eyes downcast and so so
The smell of content, happy omega, the smell of his content, happy omega. Cas was once again rearranging the small pile of gifts under their tree. The rainbow lights reflected soft smears of color in his dark hair. The blues and yellows bringing out his eyes, the reds and greens stained his cheeks and nose. Dean couldn’t help the happy rumble in his chest at the sight.
It took 3 days for Cas to wake up again. On the first day Dean had gotten him into the Impala and just drove. Wanting to put as many states between them and that settlement as possible. In the early morning of the second day he’d found an abandoned country home with a working fireplace and a usable well. After getting a fire going he’d scavenged together enough blankets to form a sort of nest on the threadbare couch.
. Dean’s stomach dropped and his throat went dry. Without another word he tore from the building. How could he have been so fucking stupid. Why didn’t he go check on Cas the moment they got back?
What could be so damn important that he’d call on Dean not even hours after their spat. Silence met him and he could feel his anger mounting. So he’d incessantly buzzed Dean, in the middle of the night, just to ghost him again? Who the fuck did Cas think he was? He was done with these games. He was sick and tired of the bullshit.
Dean flashed him a bright grin, “And I hate it when you flash those pretty golds at me, yet you still do. Now. From the beginning? Come on, Cas, it isn’t rocket science.” Cas reached over and flicked his forehead with a scowl. Dean ducked away quickly with a shit eating grin before gesturing to him to get on with it. “And don’t make it trashy.” He teased, nudging at Castiel’s leg with his big toe.
Wes took three strides forward and grabbed the front of Cas’s shirt, yanking him forward. Wes was a good half a foot taller than him and Cas tried to pull back as far as he could. Brown eyes narrowed in anger and he growled out, “What’s an Angel doing Earthside? Give me one reason I shouldn’t kill you right now.” His fingers twisted the shirt and his other came up to wrap around Cas’s throat.
The continued beeping from beside his head had Dean scowling. Cracking his eyes open he glanced out the window, aside from the bright snow building up on the glass it was still dark. The beeping continued and he groaned as he pushed the blanket down enough to reach over to the side table.
Laying back on his bare bed he stared at the ceiling, the ache in his arm traveling down to his fingertips.
“Because,” he choked out, still pointedly refusing to look at Dean. “When do we ever get what we want?”
It was too much. Too personal. Too intimate. He couldn’t look away for long though. Cas’ breathy whines begged him to look. To watch. To
Dean took a few measured steps forward, his eyes narrowing and his lips thinning out. Slipping the large knife from its place on his hip he growled out, “Because, he’s
“Too many failed attempts to keep my scent covered.” Cas shrugged slightly, pulling the oversized Henley sleeves, one Dean vaguely recognized as his own, further over his hands. “When the virus first broke out Dean realized my scent attracted too much attention, being unmated and all it was just doing what it was meant to.” He sat on the threadbare couch and stared at the shut door, lips pursed into a frown. “We tried medication, suppressants, scent marking,” A forced grin was shot his way and a self deprecating, “Nothing worked. It just morphed and tainted itself and now--”
“You are under the assumption they will arrive before Jack and Claire.” Cas shot back with raised brows, an amused smile playing across his lips. “At least your brother and his wife will help cook… your children will not.” True, Jack was always more than happy to help, however, they’d all agreed long ago that he was never allowed in the kitchen. And Claire, well, Claire just didn’t like to help.
At that he stormed past, shoulders pulled forward and into his chest as he narrowed his eyes toward the floor. Somewhere behind the closed door they both heard the boards creak. They both felt the shift in the air. They both smelled the distressed omega seeping through. “Just… Dean, you have to claim him. Give him what he wants because he fucking deserved it.” He looked over his shoulder and the red was all but gone and there was a distinct shine in his green eyes. “He deserves so much more than what I gave him and now he won’t let me. Give your Castiel the love I withheld from mine.”
“No, Cas. Stay. Stay with me.” And he reaches up to brush his thumb along the stubble of the angel’s jaw. His heart hammers when Cas leans into it.
Cas groans and throws his head back with a grimace as he lets Dean guide him to the dance floor. “‘Got-dead’ party? Seriously?”
Cas’s mouth is like silk against Dean, and Dean reaches one arm down to wrap around Castiel’s waist, a moan escaping him as Cas reaches up to tug the short hairs on Dean’s scalp.
“So fucking beautiful,” Dean murmurs as he licks a hot line up Cas’s stomach and chest, grazing over aching nipples before devouring his mouth. Cas’s hands grip both sides of his face as Dean grinds low against him again and again, cock to cock.
Dean smiles a small, wolffish thing before turning to walk deeper into the bedroom, and Cas stays rooted to the spot.
Dean tips back in his seat, almost like he’s been sucker punched, and scrubs a hand over his face. “Jesus, Cas.”
Cas’s eyes stare back into his, but they flicker back and forth between Dean and Jack. It’s a tic, Dean knows, that he does when he’s nervous.
So Dean breathes slowly, in and out, as Cas continues to work at the stubborn muscles. When it starts to feel bruised, Cas reaches one hand to grasp Dean’s outstretched elbow, the other resting on Dean’s bare hip. Cas leans closer against Dean’s back until he’s flush against it.
Something occurs to Dean then, and he lifts his head to meet Cas’s eyes. His hands travel up Cas’s arms until they rest on his shoulders.
Cas turns his head to meet Dean’s eyes, and it’s tilted at an angle. Dean’s breath stutters in his chest because the dark blue of Castiel’s sweater makes his eyes pop so that the blues look like marbles. The crease between Cas’s eyes deepens as he furrows his brow.
“I know it’s not reciprocated,” he says with the barest hint of sadness that somehow sounds more like reassurance, “and it’s okay, Dean. It really is. You don’t need to feel obligated. You don’t need to feel guilty. I’m at peace. I’m conten—”
When he goes to his room later that night, the wings gleam mockingly in the glow of the lamp on his bedside table. As if the guitar knows.
He keeps walking until he rounds the corner, and he stands in front of the door. He can’t bring himself to look at it, so he focuses his eyes on his boots instead. But he knows.
Dean sighs heavily and wraps the arm draped over Castiel’s chest a little tighter, interlocks his fingers with Cas’s over his abdomen. Cas kisses his crown as Dean strokes his thumb over Cas’s, feather-light.
“Yes.” But it’s a little breathy, a small crack in Castiel’s chassis. He’s nervous too, Dean knows, and it makes Cas even more endearing than he already was.
“Hi, Dean,” she says, and he squeezes her tight before letting her go. He makes sure she’s looking at him before speaking again.
Cas’s mouth spreads into a small smile, and Dean turns to lead him inside. The bedroom is bathed in a soft glow from the lamp on his bedside table, and he reaches around Cas’s shoulder to shut the door behind them. He lets his hand brush against Cas’s back, and he grins at the shiver it elicits in response.
“And I know you can’t see it,” Cas murmurs gently. “But I want to help you see it. Every day. I want to love you through all of it. For there is nobody else in this world for me but you.”
The intimate consonance of lips and tongue has him reeling; Cas’s tongue flicks and swirls so expertly and effortlessly against Dean’s own, it’s like he was always meant to be there. Dean can’t hold back the moan that rips from his throat.
yeah,” he shouts with a slap to the table, wine bottles and glasses clattering. “I love this song. C’mon Cas, you’re dancin’ with me.” He stands and reaches for Cas with an outstretched hand.
And it’s the best Cas can do in that moment. He regrets it almost instantly, because it sounds like bullshit, even to him. So he tries to deflect, to end this conversation before it begins. He rises from his seat and takes both of their scotch glasses in hand.
When he steps down into the kitchen, he notices how Dean’s footsteps don’t follow his over the threshold. He puts both glasses down on the counter as he reaches for the bottle of Macallan 12 in the cupboard. He unscrews the cap and begins pouring.
The stiffness melts into a pliant congruity; Dean’s lips are wet and salty from the moisture on his face, Cas’s soft and dry and taking. The heady juxtaposition of it makes Dean draw Cas even closer.
“When Lucifer ki—” he drops his gaze then, because now his voice is too thick and his eyes are too flooded and he can’t see a goddamn thing. The tears fall directly to the ground without a blink. When he looks up again, tears keep spilling, but he clears his throat and keeps his voice steady. “I tried to get Billie to take me. I had nothin’ left.”
It’s that same gravel voice, the same cerulean blue stare, the same friggin’ coat without a speck of black goo on it. The trepidation is tangible in the space between them.
“You okay?” Dean questions, eyes narrowed and lips pulled taut in a straight line. He feels his Adam’s apple bob as he swallows and wets his lips. “I mean, did the Empty —”
Cas gives a rueful smile. “I think the other angels knew long before I did. Naomi certainly knew. She saw that you were the only obstacle in her mission to fully brainwash me to her side.”
It’s all the assurance Cas needs, because then his hands are gently digging into the flesh of taut muscles.
He feels everything so much more intensely now. And he hates it, particularly in moments like these. Because he doesn’t want to feel insecure, he doesn’t want Dean to feel guilty, he doesn’t want to rock the boat.
Cas nods, and his heart begins to hammer under Dean’s locked gaze. He feels like he should step back in the interest of
.” And he’s chanting it over and over like a mantra until his body finally gives in, breaking down into sobs.
“It’s always been you,” he says, all sandpaper and gravel and thick with tears. He lightly hits Cas’s chest just above his heart.
“Check it out,” Dean says, striding over to where the guitar is sitting on the floor leaning against one of the walls. He wraps a hand gingerly around the neck, his other hand coming to grip against the back.
Contentedness blooms in his belly, warming his insides until he feels like his body is humming. Everybody he has ever loved and lost in one room.
Dean lifts his head to gaze upon the lake in front of him. The kaleidoscope of the sunset’s colors are reflecting on the surface now, the sun’s final rays dancing on the water.
Dean shifts minutely, dipping his chin slightly to move away for air; but not before he sucks Cas’s bottom lip between his own, gently nipping with his teeth. Claiming.
Sometimes he’ll watch online tutorials, and sometimes he’ll just pluck away at the strings in different variations. He remembers the basics from that summer at Sonny’s — which string belongs to which chord, how to tune and how to change the strings when they get flimsy.
Dean tilts forward so that his arms rest on his knees, and gives Cas’s hand a gentle squeeze. When Cas looks up to the stars again, the flames are reflected in shining blue pools.
The existential dread settles around him like an oppressive blackness, squeezing and crushing his bones and liquifying his limbs. Every muscle in his body aches, and his chest protests with every labored breath, anxiety and panic radiating from his front to his back like a carousel, and it feels like a vice crushing him: a sharp, hot pain.
“Here, hold this there.” Sam’s moving Dean’s other hand, bag of veggies plopping on the table, to force him to press the ice cube into his skin until he’s lucid enough to do it himself.
,” Dean whimpers into Cas’s mouth before pressing his lips to his ear. “Please,” and he chokes on a sob because he needs; needs Cas like nothing he’s ever known.
Cas tries to stifle a whimper as Dean’s tongue flicks languidly against his own, mapping the peaks and valleys of his mouth. His heart aches,
When Dean dies on a Thursday in November, Cas is there to welcome him at the proverbial pearly gates.
The knot releases with a resounding pop. Dean blows out a breath in relief as he rolls his shoulder back and forth.
He hears Sam snort fondly from across the room. Dean lifts his head and gives a look, like Sam is the weirdest dude in the world.
He walks across the room until the wall is inches from his face. He places the guitar gingerly on the ground, the neck with the wings and headstock resting against where the Empty had swallowed everything inside of him whole.
“You can touch me, y’know,” he murmurs as he meets Cas’s eyes. His fingers caress the nape of Cas’s neck. “I mean...if you want. I ain’t gonna break.”
The wings on the fretboard gleam in the light of the flames. Cas straightens in his seat, arms resting on his thighs.
“Sit with your back against the headboard,” Dean commands, and when Cas gets situated, Dean settles between Cas’s legs, eyeing his flushed, curved arousal.
Cas cranes his neck back from the sheer bliss of having Dean buried deep inside of him, before bending to rest his forehead against Dean’s chest. He peppers open-mouthed kisses to the sweat slicked skin, marking a trail from the top of Dean’s rib cage, up his sternum, to the column of his neck. Cas’s tongue licks a hot line from the crook of Dean’s neck to his earlobe as he begins to rock in harmony with Dean’s thrusts.
He keeps his voice eerily steady and even, sighing heavily as he lifts his chin to look at the ceiling again. “I didn’t blame you then, and I don’t blame you now. It wasn’t like I didn’t deserve it.”
,” Dean groans and lets his neck go slack as Cas works.  His fingers are heaven, and he can feel the crunching underneath them.
Once her footsteps have faded down the hall, Dean turns to open the freezer. “Ice” of course means a bag of frozen veggies, and Sam walks to the sink to soak a washcloth from the cupboard under cold water.
“She made copies of you in Heaven. Hundreds. Maybe thousands. And she forced me to kill every single one of them to condition me to kill you.” Cas doesn’t flinch as tears roll down his face. Doesn’t make a move to swipe them away.
There’s a twinge in Dean’s gut as he gazes into Cas’s eyes. They look sad bordered on pained, as if he's waiting to hear bad news that he knows is coming.
He ducks his head, almost shy, and glances up at him through his eyelashes. “Castiel,” he greets with pressed lips, eyes gleaming.
“Cas?” Dean croaks out in a barely audible sound. The angel blinks and gives the smallest, almost indecipherable of nods, almost like he’s afraid to move.
Rufus is there too with Aretha at one end of the bar, Johnnie Walker Blue in hand. Dean doesn’t think he’s ever seen the man smile the way he is right now, so earnestly and genuine.
“You’re stiff,” he deduces. “Sit down. Let me,” and he leads Dean to his bed so he can sit perpendicular to the mattress. Cas slides in behind him on his knees, hands snaking to graze Dean’s sides, pulling up the hem of his shirt over his head. He tosses it to the hamper in the corner and runs his hands up Dean’s arms before placing them at the slope of his shoulders.
