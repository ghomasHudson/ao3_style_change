'What the fuck, Dean? Don't be an ass. She's my sister, I have to go. Is this about Thanksgiving? Because you know that wasn't my idea - '
“There! Got it. Take the second left, then an immediate right. Then we just drive down that road for a few minutes.”
Three days later, Cas was in the kitchen attempting to make breakfast when Dean walked in, yawning. 'What's cookin' good-lookin'?'
Their voices were low, so Sam pretended he didn't hear, and when Cas called out a loud, 'Merry Christmas!' Sam stuck his head around the door. Dean went back to the kitchen with his arms full of plastic containers and brightly-packaged food.
“And Dean.”
'Now I'm just hungry.'
Cas sighs and starts the car. 'I ignored his advice. And my parents' advice. Which he resented. Resents. I should have listened to them, they were right. But you know what it's like when you're young and stupid.'
“Yes, you did.”
When Sam returned thirty minutes later, Dean sat behind the fridge, access panel unscrewed, cleaning dust from between the blades of the compressor fan.
'You said something was your fault.'
While Sam was gone, the afternoon stretched closer and closer toward evening. Dean put some of Sam's weird green dog treats into the rubbery ball with holes that Sam said was “important for Bones' mental stimulation” and rolled it into the living room to keep Bones out of his way. Back in his room, he slid the scissors through the tape on a cardboard box. He unpacked it item by item; his headphones, a large CD wallet, a few * ahem * adult magazines, and a few photo frames. He placed each frame delicately around his mattress, which was lying on the floor, seeing as the moving van with the bed frames wouldn't arrive until the next day. One photo was of him and Sam taken a couple years ago on Sam's birthday, one was the two of them with Bobby when they were kids, and one was a family portrait with John, Mary, young Dean, and baby Sam. John and Mary looked exhausted but genuinely happy, and Dean was looking at Sam, amused, as if Sam had just done something interesting.
'Well aren't you a vision,' Dean quips.
“Fu – heck no. Well, not unless you call trekking around the county an adventure. I just want to get to know my home a bit better. It's shocking what you miss with walls in the way.”
It clicked. Sam had seen the book about Morse code on Dean's bedside table. Sam smiled, imagining his brother as a spy or a secret agent. It dawned on him that his brother had thoughts that he didn't share with Sam, that he had important things to say (or that he couldn't say, at least out loud). Sam wondered what the world looked like to Dean, and for the first time realized that although he and Dean had the same experiences, for the most part, they lived different lives. He never imagined Dean seeing things in the world that Sam didn't see, thinking things that he didn't say out loud, having reactions that were different from Sam's. Sam didn't think all of this in words, didn't even really identify it, it all just swept over him as a feeling of wonder and he felt as if his eyes had been opened. He saw Dean, really saw him. Dean looked happy, so Sam went back to his bed, floating on the strange realization and feeling surreal.
Dean nodded enthusiastically and grabbed the rocket ship he had been building, indicating all the bent parts. It was a twisted mess of wild imagination.
She was curled on the sofa in a plain white dress. He thought she was asleep until he saw that her eyes were open and fixed on him. He stared, wondering if she was dead, but then she blinked and whimpered.
Cas brightened. “Yes, actually, I think he wants to talk recipes tonight before we go.”
Dean scoffed. 'I don't need tarot cards to hit on people. I was going to ask you to dinner anyway.' Cas felt his face go beet-red. Stupid blushing skin. Why wouldn't his blood ever let him play it cool? Dean was looking at him beseechingly. 'I swear I'm not making this up. Look.' He got up, crossed over to the bookshelf, and pulled down an old dusty book called 'Basic Tarot.' He riffled through the pages as Cas sat there with his heart pounding, then handed the book over. Cas looked down at the page. There was a black and white picture of that card. 'Ace of Cups,' it said, 'indicative of new emotional beginnings, especially concerning romantic relationships. If you asked about pregnancy, motherhood could be imminent. This card indicates falling in love, fruitfulness, psychic ability, and compassion.' Cas stopped reading and gaped up at Dean, who, Cas was shocked to see, was also blushing. It made his freckles stand out. Cas looked back down at the cards. 'What about that last one, after the ace of cups?'
Cas, thoroughly bamboozled, cocked his head. 'What? Why would I think that?'
Cas flung his arms up. 'Oh, what? Are you throwing some kind of tantrum? What are you, five?' It was as if the last half of the year melted away, as if Cas had just slammed the front door, as if they had never finished fighting.
'What are you waiting for?' Crowley hissed, and Dean nearly jumped out of his skin.
'Why not? He's a pretty nice guy. He's funny. You seemed to like him. When was the last time, Dean?'
Sam went upstairs to his room, wondering what Dean meant, leaving Dean and Cas to fold origami animals out of the wrapping paper and laugh at each other's failed attempts. He moved his books aside on the bookshelf and reached to the back. His fingers brushed the smooth paper and he fished out Dean's present. Uncle Bobby had given Sam this amulet a few months ago and told him it was really special, so Sam wanted Dean to have it.
'Perfect time of year for it, Dean. Please tell me you'll be making your pumpkin pie muffins for this shindig.'
“Third option: dog burgers.”
'Because the cover said 'The Hunt: How to Get Your Man' and I thought it might be helpful advice for hunting. It was not what I expected.' Dean dropped his head into his hands and stifled a groan. He couldn't believe they were having this conversation. 'It was still very educational.'
Dean smiles. 'Yes,
'You can count on it. Have a safe flight, Dean. See you in a few weeks.'
A shadow crossed Cas' face. 'Not today, Sam.'
Dean shrugged. 'He's alright. He's upset about Christmas. He doesn't understand that you have to leave.'
Jo looks back and forth between them. Dean wants very much to listen to Cas, and he's really too tired to pretend otherwise in front of Jo.
“So nice to finally meet you in person,” Sam said as he shook her hand.
That night he couldn't sleep. His dad's snoring from the other room, usually so comforting, now kept him awake. His sheets were too wrinkled, his blanket too heavy, the pillow too flat. He thrashed around trying to get comfortable, trying to empty his mind. He wished Cas were staying over like he did most nights. It was easier for Dean to sleep with the lullaby of Cas' breathing and the occasional soft sound as Cas turned over in his sleeping bag. He wanted to fall asleep in the living room like he usually did when Cas was over. He wanted Cas near him. He wanted the sound of Cas' voice. He wanted to be able to lean over against Cas. The thought shocked him. He and Cas touched all the time, but it was mostly horsing around. Surprised with himself, he thought about touching Cas. Imagined how it would feel. Imagined Cas resting his head on Dean's shoulder, unruly black hair against Dean's neck. He felt wide awake, his brain jittery with mindless, senseless energy. What was he thinking? Cas was his best friend. Dean's imagination was pushing boundaries, and Dean, uneasy, wished it would shut up and let him sleep.
“Cas!”
'Yes. If you can sit STILL for long enough.'
'Absolutely not. I don't wish to put you out, Dean.'
'Uh. Yes, actually. And I didn't expect you to have decent taste in books.'
He remembered the sun shining through the leaves. The shouts of children. The feeling of the chalk dry and flaking in his hand. The urge to scribble out his thoughts in shapes and colors.
Cas extended a hand. 'That's me.'
'Besides,' said Anna, reappearing at the table with her change, 'isn't it relevant to your project?'
Cas looked down to scribble in his sketchbook. Dean shivered. The cold had seeped into his blanket and his skin felt the chill. Cas held up his sketchbook page.
'Oh my god.' Cas burst out laughing. 'Oh my god. Your tarot cards just hit on me FOR YOU.'
Cas' face darkened. His eyes glittered in the dark. He pulled his arm back and smashed his fist into the side of Dean's face.
Jo and Charlie wandered off to pick the grass that grew up through the fences, and Bobby and Ellen trailed after them.
Sam sniffed the air. 'Something burning?'
Eventually, Cas' parents stood to leave, and Cas walked them to their car. They went slowly so they could talk a little in the peace and quiet.
“With you in a sec!”
'That's our number. You tell your brother we love him, and you tell him to call me if he's ever in troub- if he ever needs anything. Same goes for you, alright?' Uncle Bobby stared at Sam searchingly.
“Sammy, just let the man eat some breakfast in peace. He's fine.”
'Can you blame 'em? When I was their age I would've been bored stiff staring at animals in cages.'
No further comment. Ooookay then. Dean puts down his bag of flour and wipes his hands on his apron. 'Come on, the stuff you'll need is over here.' He leads Castiel around the counters, past Jo washing berries and Kevin already starting on the shortcrust. The smell of pie is in the air, it's Dean's favourite menu. Life is good. He turns around to ask Castiel some kind of boring small-talk question and Castiel flinches.
'What are
'Whose room is this?'
Sorry this one is so short, even shorter than the others! It's not really a chapter, it just needed its own space.
Dean was terrified. He didn't want to hear it. Something was balanced precariously between them, so he leaned in toward Cas. He tipped the balance just enough for gravity to take hold. A slow listing that gained momentum. Cas' eyes widened. Just before Dean's lips touched Cas', he stopped. He couldn't do it. He was a complete coward. But he couldn't make himself step away either. Instead, he rested his forehead against Cas'. Surrender. A primal challenge. Cas fell into Dean's orbit like he belonged there and pressed his lips to Dean's.
Sam huffed. Dean saw a glimmer of something in Sam's eyes. 'Alright. What do you want to do?'
The night before the big blowout, Dean had a dream. It was extraordinarily ordinary. Dean was making grilled cheese. He had three sandwiches under the grill, and just as he wondered why there was an extra, he heard Cas' voice behind him. He turned and saw Sam and Cas and, between them, the space they left for Dean. Their plates clean and waiting. Their expressions patient. His heart ached.
Dean managed to look delighted and embarrassed at the same time. Cas' heart fluttered.
Dean froze. His mind went blank. 'Out. At a friend's.'
One day, Sam was staring out the window in his math class when his attention was caught by a distant movement by the high school. Was that Dean by the bleachers? He squinted. It was. And...were there people underneath the stands? Sam thought he could make out two silhouettes: a tall one with dark hair and a shorter one with long blonde hair. He watched as Dean made his way to them. Something sparked in the air. A lighter, Sam realized. He looked at the clock, confused. It wasn't a break time. Dean must be cutting class.
Relief.
'Alright. Hey, look, Cas' house has those moving reindeer.' Dean pointed at the lawn next door, which was covered in decorations; reindeer, Santa, a sled, even a few elves. 'They really went all out, huh?' Dean looked amused, but Sam felt a little sad. Their own house was so dark next to the gaudy display next door. He was jealous, even if he knew the lit-up Santa was a bit cheesy. 'You okay?' Dean asked, concern in his voice. Sam hated making Dean worry.
“Look, Sammy, whatever you're trying to say, come out and say it.”
'Hm?'
Bobby shakes Cas' hand. 'So, you're the new man in Dean's life.'
Dean sat in the living room in front of the TV with clenched fists. John mumbled something about Mary and tossed in his sleep. That was when Dean finally snapped. He needed open air, needed to turn his skull inside out and scrub it clean. He nabbed a smallish bottle of whiskey from the kitchen and shrugged on his leather jacket. Fuck it. His dad would be so hungover tomorrow he wouldn't remember, would think that he had polished off the half-size bottle himself.
“Gabe! What happened to 'no more one night stands?' You said you wanted something serious and - ”
'Hm. Could be a cat burglar slash serial killer.' Dean popped the toast and started buttering it.
Dean doesn't argue. If he's honest with himself, he really doesn't want Cas to change his mind, even if Cas is sleep-deprived. 'That'd be great. Are you feeling alright?'
Sam darted past the moving van, up the porch steps, and into the house in front of Cas. He slipped through to the living room and pointed Cas upstairs to Dean's room. Cas braced himself and walked up the stairs. Sam didn't blame him. He didn't envy anyone who had to approach Dean in the mood he was in without armor and a cattle prod. He waited, tense, until he hard a soft knock, then muffled voices. He couldn't help it, he was curious. He crept up the stairs and stood at the door to his room, where he could hear.
Cas fell asleep in the bluish glow to exaggerated screams and grotesque squelching on a low volume. Dean smiled as he listened to Cas' steady breathing. He found his own breaths slowing to match and eventually sleep rolled over him.
'I think we may need to turn left somewhere up here.'
Then, one hot Sunday morning near the end of June, when Dean was out somewhere, Cas and his family came back. From his window, Sam saw the car pull up and he watched with bated breath as Cas emerged. As soon as he saw Cas, Sam dissolved with relief. Cas' dad walked out and wrapped them in awkward hugs, then picked up a suitcase and led them all inside.
It was Meg's turn. She stalked back over from the sound system and bent down to spin the can, aluminum clattering against the concrete floor. She finished her beer as it slowly spun to a stop, pointing at Alastair, who grimaced and struggled to his feet. He followed Meg's swinging leather-clad hips out of the room to whooping and wolf-whistles.
Dean, still red in the face, took a huge sip of coffee and choked, coughing.
Dean turns on some lights and joins them in the kitchen. Jo is unpacking vegetables, stock cubes, pasta, and chicken from her bags, and Cas is rooting around through Dean's cupboards.
'Daddy, look!' Sam pointed to Dean and Castiel, already at the first exhibit. 'C'mon, Jo! C'mon, Charlie!' Three sets of chubby toddler legs went into maximum overdrive.
'Now remember. Wearing these is not optional. I will be hugely offended if I don't see you and Sam in blinking lights and bright colors.'
'Alright.' He waves his hand and turns to go, but not before he sees Jo raise her eyebrows in a mix of approval and disbelief. Cas has already turned back to the cupboard. Dean grabs a knitted blanket from the back of his armchair and curls up on the couch. He listens to the sounds in the kitchen, a soothing low hum of voices and movement. He hears a clatter and smiles to himself at the thought of Cas and Jo putting all of his kitchenware away in the wrong places. He dozes off and doesn't dream.
Dean raised his eyebrows and did just that. When he was down to his boxers, Bela artlessly stripped off her bra and underwear and slid Dean's boxers down off his hips. He stared at her bold nudity, the smudge of dark hair between her legs, the lines on her skin from her jeans, her bare shoulders. Something about her directness and apathy sang to a deep-down part of Dean. A high, clear melody drifting from the atmosphere. And part of him howled back. He had never actually had sex before, had only gone as far as second base with Amanda Heckerling in the back of his car, but it felt as natural as breathing to lay on his back and pull Bela down on top of him. Her long blonde hair fell over them like a curtain. It smelled like artificial fruit and plastic flowers and air freshener. Her skin was much softer than Dean had expected and he traced a few faint freckles just below her neck. For a moment, Dean thought she was going to kiss him, but she veered off sideways instead and ripped the condom wrapper open with her teeth. Dean was hard already. He didn't protest as she rolled the condom down over him.
Cas cleared his throat. 'Spot on.'
Cas points at a nearby overpass. He heads up the steps and Dean follows. His boots clang on the metal slats. When they reach the top the wind swirls around them and the dark landscape rises up in the distance, cut by streaming lines of headlights. Dean's head clears.
The story spread through the three schools over the course of the day. Apparently, someone had blown up a toilet with a cherry bomb. Everyone wanted to know how someone could have smuggled it into the high school in the first place. Rumors flew and, though most were nonsense, they all had one thing in common: It had to do with Fergus Crowley. Everyone knew he had cleaned out an abandoned unlicensed firework factory a couple months ago. When Sam got home, Dean's face was flushed and excited. Sam's stomach sank.
'Not so much,' Dean says uncomfortably. 'So you're a student too? Are you in law?'
'No sir. Cas brought it over because he wanted to spend Christmas with us.'
In the forest surrounding Birch Ridge, night fell softly, as if tip-toeing through a stranger's house. Darkness spread slowly up through thick hoary trunks until it reached the canopy just in time to see the sun slip over the horizon. An owl called out; long, low, questioning. In the darkest part of the forest where the trees were impassably dense, two bright eyes with slit pupils opened and gleamed. A creature uncoiled and stretched, as black as the night surrounding it, almost indistinguishable in the dark.
'Yeah. Yeah, sorry, Cas. What?'
Moment by moment, he dragged himself forward until he reached the bedroom door. He reached out weakly and pressed the door, which swung outward slowly enough to be silent, revealing a truly ghastly sight. One of the girls, Anael, was lying naked in the centre of the next room. She appeared to be fast asleep. Castiel's mind, confused, latched on to small details in a desperate bid to make sense of what he saw. Goosebumps covered her arms and legs. Her red hair was splayed out over the ground. His head swam, and he realised that the flickering light was caused by dozens of candles lining the room. His eyes fought to stay open, but it felt as if they were  being forcefully pulled down. Tall robed figures were circling her, chanting, as one hooded figure knelt down before her. With an electric surge of horror, Castiel saw a knife glint in the firelight. He tried to scream, tried to warn her, but all that escaped his leaden throat was a moan of horror. The robed figures turned in sharp unison to face him, and he blacked out.
Dean, Crowley, and Bela planned their 4th of July anti-party. It was decided that they would use the dynamite to blow up Cas' shed. Not too close to the house. As much as Crowley liked to watch things burn, he was smart. He didn't want to hurt anyone and risk being caught. Dean wondered uneasily if the threat of being found out was the only thing holding Crowley back from more extreme ideas. He thought of burnt skin, muffled yelling, and secluded places in the woods. He shivered in the sunshine. As their plans developed, the contents of the shed rose through the murk of Dean's conscience; he assumed Cas had gone back to using it as a studio and a storehouse for all his paintings and drawings. Crowley and Bela made sure Dean agreed to be the one to light the fuses.
Dean tried not to think about the angel digging through his stack of Voluptuous Asian Lovelies mags. He kept them tucked away in a drawer, of course, but for years he'd just found it easier to assume Cas knew everything about him, inside and out, including his preferred porn-stash locations. That way he wasn't unpleasantly surprised when Cas cut right to the bone with some of his more vocal observations.
'New love.'
'Uh...thanks?'
“I'll bring you a croissant, they're almost done. And you're getting a chocolate one. Don't argue.”
The latch clicked and Dean jumped as the door to the shed swung open. Cas stood just inside, arms crossed, expression blankly furious. Dean stared at him, feeling like he'd been plunged into freezing water. It was the first time he'd seen Cas properly since the fight. He looked different. He was taller, bigger. His hair was more unruly, his eyes harder. Dean sucked in a breath.
'Probably the same, but with pie.'
“I would love to.' He hugged her back with one arm. 'Bye, Mrs. McGuirk.”
Cas stared at him. Was there a card that meant
'Come on then, Winchester.' Dean swallowed and tried not to choke as he got up and followed her out into the darkened hall. Bela took his hand and led him past a messy laundry room, a closed door, and a small living room before they came to an empty bedroom. It definitely wasn't Crowley's. It looked like the room of a pre-teen girl. Dean looked around with apprehension as Bela closed the door.
Cas prompted him. 'And? What does that mean?'
He stared around the kitchen as if expecting to see an open fire that could explain why there was a layer of ash on one of his houseplants. Nothing. The dark unhappiness of the plant called to him, so he took a steadying breath and closed his eyes. The pot was smooth and heavy. The leaves brushed his hands. He focused on the knot of twisted pain he could feel in the soil and imagined his hands gently and steadily untangling it, even as his hands in reality simply held the pot. He swayed where he stood. After a minute or two the wrong feeling ebbed and he opened his eyes. The spider plant was a healthy bright green and the soil was dark and ash-less once again. There was nothing left behind to even suggest a disturbance. Except...Castiel looked at the grey smudge on his fingers.
Cas' jaw jutted out stubbornly. 'Do your worst.'
Cas' heart inexplicably plummets. He is dizzy and sickly sad all at once. Sam leaves the room pointedly, with a face that looks purposefully blank. Dean looks up and catches Cas' eye. Surprise registers on his face. Cas feels the need to escape pressing in on him. It feels the way it used to feel when he could hear a cacophany of other angels' voices all clamouring in his head. “Ah.”
Cas threw both of his hands up. 'Laugh it up, Winchester. Gabe got some for you and Sam, too, and he's forcing us all to wear them.'
'Absolutely not.'
'W – aren't you tired? You did just get off a flight straight - .'
“Uhh, okay, Peter Venkman, did you get slimed or something? See the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man?”
Dean was trying not to think about Cas. He was trying not to think about the texture of Cas' hair. He was trying not to think of the freckle just beneath Cas' collarbone. He was trying not to think about Cas' scent – an indefinable hot-skin laundry-detergent musky tangled-hair smell that'd been worn into half of Dean's pillowcases by then. All evening on Thanksgiving, as John drank steadily and the TV filled the house with tinny artificial noise, Dean thought about not thinking about Cas, which just escalated into frustration until John was passed out on the couch and Dean was grinding his teeth and attempting to use laser vision to see through the walls in order to know what Cas was doing.
Sam and Jess stopped talking when they heard the front door open and close, then Dean's footsteps on the stairs. Sam jumped out to the landing.
Sam waited impatiently all day to see if Cas would come over and say hi, then waited impatiently all evening for Dean to get home so he could tell him the news. Cas didn't come over. Sam figured he was probably busy unpacking. And Dean didn't come home. But Sam was too pleased to let the wait bother him. He microwaved leftovers for dinner and called Jess instead. He felt lighter than air.
'She had to go home, so I said I'd stay and make sure you were alright. She told me to force-feed you if necessary.'
Dean felt something waiting in his lungs. He opened his mouth again and his feelings converged and coalesced into a quiet, 'okay.' Cas beamed, and Dean was still happy when Sammy woke up twenty minutes later.
Sam was woken at night by faint flashing lights. The first night it happened, he was confused. Flashes of yellow light spattered his walls. The light wasn't very bright, but then it was answered by a light flashing into Sam's eyes from next door. Must be Cas' room, Sam thought. Bewildered, he looked out the window. His breath fogged up the glass, but he could just see Dean's window lighting up through the mist. If he craned, he could see Dean's face out of the corner of his eye. Sam couldn't see Dean properly but no one could mistake the air of happiness around him.
'Winchester!'
'So why am I holding this then?' Dean stared at the plant - its small shiny leaves, its unapologetically colorful flowers, the black-as-tar dirt it was potted in – then back at Cas.
'Are those sirens?'
(See the end of the chapter for
'Ughh. What.'
'No, not at all. My phone's upstairs somewhere. You want a hand with those?'
Dean steps outside and takes a deep breath. The early morning air is fresh and sharp in his lungs. The cold always makes him feel clean, inside and out. The mostly-bare trees sparkle with frost, and the ground is a shining carpet of ice over gold and red leaves. The sky is a clear canvas stretched above him, hardly a cloud in sight. He spends a minute just staring, watching his breath become steam, before Sam lumbers out, blowing into his cupped hands.
'Hello?' Anna called out. The sound of running water echoed down the hall and a door opened, disgorging a tall man who was drying his hands on a towel.
'Help you?' he drawls. He has dirt under his fingernails.
He was awake now, but groggy. He recalled raised voices. Dean and Dad. They must have fought. But who had left? He shoved the covers back and got out of bed, walked down the hall to find out what had happened. The bathroom light was on and Dean was standing in front of the mirror in his boxers. So Dad must have left. Sam wasn't worried, he knew Dad would come back to say goodbye and check in before leaving again on another job. What was Dean doing, though? Sam sucked in a breath when he saw the fresh purple bruises on Dean's neck and collarbone. He balked. Dad couldn't have done that. Dean was examining them. He pressed his fingertips onto the bruises, grimaced. It made Sam feel sore in sympathy. It must have hurt, but that didn't stop Dean. Dean pressed them, hissed in pain and clenched his hands into fists. He stared at his reflection, then held his left arm with his right. Sam watched in utter bewilderment as Dean dug his nails into his arm hard enough to puncture. Dean gasped and let go. Sam saw the red crescents blooming on the map of Dean's skin and his compass suddenly demagnetized. He didn't know what to do.
Cas looked at him searchingly. So Dean took a deep breath and said it without saying it.
Dean looks at his arms. NOT YOUR FAULT. ACCIDENTS HAPPEN. He looks up at Cas. Cas, who just saw Dean having a complete full-on out-of-control panic attack. Cas, who just saw a version of Dean that is not Dean. Cas, who is rearing back to hit him again.
Cas is woken up by the sound of the front door swinging shut. One of the boys must have gone out for something. He yawns and lifts his arms straight up, stares at them. He clenches his hands into fists and then relaxes them, watching his tendons appear and disappear. Long lines of flesh. Pale curving roads. He bends his elbows a little, then straightens them, rotates his arms clockwise, counter-clockwise. He is mesmerised by the different interlocking pieces, the curves and dips, the thought of bones beneath it all, connected but kept from touching by cartilage. He pictures all of his bones floating free from one another. This vivid visual is interrupted by his brain clicking into gear and reminding him of last night. The drinking, the laughing, the pile of chocolates wrapped in pink foil, the drunken game of charades that made the three of them laugh hard enough to cry. He had unwrapped the Valentine's Day chocolates for Sam and Dean, had smoothed out all the pieces of pink foil. Cas eventually gets out of bed and wanders to the main room. Sam follows not long after and pours them both coffee.
'That's great.' Finally, a hint of a smile.
'Shakespeare did say “Our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners.”' Cas chimes in.
Crowley leaned into Dean's face and blew twin plumes of smoke from his nose. 'What's the matter, you still harboring a soft spot? I can see your yellow belly from here. Dean Winchester, too afraid?' Bela's accompanying laugh was hard and cruel.
She didn't answer, just squeezed her eyes shut and curled even tighter. That was when he saw the stain:
'They're all goofing off, must just be a fire drill.'
And that's why Sam gives him bitchface #4 (Dude. Seriously?) across the paperwork spread over Bobby's kitchen table. 'Dean, can't you put it on silent? This is important.' Dean takes a sip of his beer and ignores Sam in favour of reading Cas' text.
He rolled over, letting pockets of chilly air in under the quilt, and looked out at the sunrise. The peaceful morning rippled through the glass. He inhaled deeply in the vain hope that filling himself with cold air would magically equalize his temperature and make getting out of bed less of a trial. After several minutes of deep breathing and battling the pull of queasy drowsiness, he gritted his teeth. He knew he couldn't put it off much longer; the last time he'd slept in, Inias had laid out the coin trays in the till backward and Castiel had spent the day fumbling and giving people incorrect change, his hand moving by muscle memory. He was a creature of habit by nature or nurture and his routine was his lifeline. Each scheduled day, in fact, formed a net of lifelines that worked to hold him up and give him something to cling to. And part of his routine was getting up early.
Jess patted his arm. 'Give it time. It won't happen overnight.' She was right, of course. Sam was so impatient he could hardly stand it. 'Hey,' Jess continued. 'Do you want to come over to my house for dinner tonight?'
“But Castiel,” Inias quipped through a huge grin, “Aren't you happy to have such honest and straightforward friends?”
'Cleaning crew?' says Kevin. 'Heard he came here from Toronto.'
Dean laughed. 'Must have been a dream, Sammy, I went to sleep right after you did.'
“Of course. Is it a new recipe?” Castiel was often Jimmy's guinea pig when it came to new pastries.
'Take it easy, Yosemite Sam. What's the rush?'
Someone slaps him again. Another huge breath. Dean is in a closet. There is a mop. Dean looks at the mop. Dean's lungs seem to gain control. His breathing slows. There are shelves. Dean breathes. His father is Castiel, kneeling on the floor of the closet. Dean is on his knees with his arms wrapped around himself. The door is ajar. Cas is staring at him. He stares back. Reality returns.
'Dean, I have to tell you something.'
'As a responsible citizen I'm all in favour of bribery but, uh, you don't have to. Happy to help.'
Dean closed the door behind him as quietly as he could. He did it out of habit even though he knew he didn't have to: Dad had taken off on another job and Sammy was at Jessica's house for the 4th of July BBQ. If Dean hadn't been feeling so apprehensive, he would have smiled about it. Jess' family had practically adopted Sam after last year's Thanksgiving and any fool could see that the two were ass-over-teakettle in puppy love with each other.
'You're welcome.' Cas surprises Dean with his quicksand grin. Immediate and stunning and wide-open with joy. Dean feels like he's lighting up from the inside, feels like he's back in the night that he and Sam went to that field on the fourth of July and lit fireworks and sparklers. They had waved them, trailing sparks, trailing smoke, their hopes crashing behind them, their laughter drowned out by small explosions that couldn't quite reach the stars.
As Sam was walking out the door, Dean grabbed the loop on Sam's backpack and literally pulled him up short.
'Hmph. Eat your cake.'
'Do you actually believe in all this?'
1995 – 1996
Cas nodded, feeling excited. “Don't keep me in suspense.”
you're sure?'
Dean feels a blush creeping up the back of his neck. He clears his throat and looks up. 'What?' He can't keep the defensive note from his voice. Bobby abruptly turns and busies himself with the dishes. Sam bites back a smile. 'You also need a list of your costs and an estimate for when it all will have paid for itself and can start making money. That means research.'
'That's the spirit. Ditch the backpack.'
'Hey, believe it or not, I actually like this stuff.'
Dean draped an arm over his face dramatically. “Where do you find the energy? Have fun.”
Dean, amused, got the distinct feeling that he and Sam were being set up on some sort of play date with a grown-ass man. After Hyun-Sook was gone, he and Sam spent the rest of the morning and part of the afternoon hauling the contents of the trailer inside. Of course Sam had brought every single one of his health food cookbooks, and stacked them all right in the middle of the kitchen counter. As the two of them were moving Dean's memory foam mattress in, Sam huffed, “So what do you think?”
Sam hastily stuck his phone back in his pocket and walked around the car to let Bones out. “Uh...yeah, it wasn't too bad.” Bones hopped out of the car and shook himself, then ran to sniff at Hyun-Sook's feet.
Dean feigned half-hearted interest as he looked toward Cas, who had turned away from them. 'Looks like. And also, shut up.'
'Max. From The Grinch?'
Happy, the next one hummed.
“Would I ever!” Inias pulled out a raspberry turnover and bit into it with his usual enthusiasm. He made a noise of absolute satisfaction and washed the bite down with his coffee.
'Challenge accepted! I am going to deconstruct the hell out of this, big sister.'
Sam was silent for a moment, then said, “I have this feeling about it.”
“I told your brothers you would be just fine, but they didn't seem to believe me,” he tells Cas.
Amelia made a large T sign with her hands and raised her eyebrows questioningly at Cas, to which he nodded. She left to make a pot of tea and Claire came back into the room, hauling a bird book that looked as if it weighed more than her. She plonked it laboriously in his lap and started flipping through the pages, chatting animatedly.
Dean glances once around the kitchen and is just reaching for the light switches when Cas walks in, heading for the door. He looks terrible; he's hunched, walking like a zombie, and his eyes are bloodshot. Dean's hand hits the switch before that registers and Cas yelps. Oops, shit. He turns the lights back on.
Dean shrugs. 'It seems unnecessary to me, too. People have their standards, I guess, and never seem to realize how much work goes into keeping them up. How much waste.' He's surprised at the bitterness in his voice, and it looks like Castiel is too. 'That's why I prefer smaller restaurants. Big hotel kitchen? It's fine, but I always feel bad when we have to throw out entire pallets of uneaten bread and stuff like that.' Castiel is looking at him, really looking at him. There's a pause, and Dean's face starts to feel uncomfortably hot.
Anna tugged at her hair and sat down in the comfy-looking chair by the door. 'You two go on inside, I'll wait here.'
'Anytime. Dean. Get these away from me or I will burst.' Sam leans back, holding his stomach.
John patted his breast pocket reassuringly. 'Got it right here. Don't you worry. I'm sure we're all going to have a great time. Right, Sammy?'
Cas paused. 'I would eat an entire cake.' Dean laughed. 'And then I would puke it up and eat another one.'
He wakes up in a hospital bed. He can tell from the smell and the squeaking of shoes. The pillowcase crinkles as he moves his head. His chest hurts when he breathes, as if he's inhaling fire. His left hand is uncomfortably warm. He tries to lift it to his face to see what's wrong with it but it won't move. In a fright, he tries again, harder, and his eyes fly open. He's lying in a blue hospital bed and has just ripped his hand out of a startled Dean's and hit himself in the face. A nurse is standing behind Dean with his lips pinched shut, red in the face, shoulders shaking with suppressed laughter.
Cas' eyes landed on the box of explosives on the floor. His jaw dropped, and something broke through his anger. 'Are you KIDDING me? What the hell were you going to do with that, exactly, Dean?'
'Who's It? Who got caught?'
'Anything for you, Cas.' Dean hides the small truth behind insouciance.
Cas gaped at him. 'Punch you?'
It felt like a bruise, like a razor, like a drive-by. Dean tasted blood. Cas crushed his mouth. It hurt, but even though Cas was the one with a cut lip, he didn't stop. Dean let out a small giving-up sound and then pushed back, tried to suffocate himself with Cas, tried to fill his arms with as much of Cas as he could hold on to. He didn't know how it had happened – he was  wrapped around Cas, eyes closed. His whole body was pinned against the wall by hard lines and bony hips.
'Huh?' Dean shakes himself out of the daydream and realizes he's been staring at Cas' bitten lips, and is half-hard in his jeans.
'I brought it today, it's in my locker.'
“Excuse you?” Dean's voice has gone from thoughtful to bristling.
He froze, felt tears of...anger? Fear? stream down his face, then forced his legs to walk to her. He leaned down and lifted her, supporting her weight as he walked her back to the children's room, the stain
'See, Sam? You just need practice.' Jess gives him a shove.
SMALL
Castiel smiled and took a deep breath of the warm air, surreptitiously checking on the peace lilies in the windows and the potted rubber tree. He had grown them all in his greenhouse at work and liked to see them thriving, even if Jimmy called him a helicopter mom and Gabe told him he had to cut the apron strings. Speak of the devil. Gabe emerged from the back with a bottle of hazelnut syrup.
Cas looks like he's suppressing a smile. 'Jo and I made you chicken soup with pasta and garlic bread. Well, Jo did most of it. I helped. And it's late.'
'There, see. Was he honest?'
Dean was too tired to reply. He reached down and pulled the condom off carefully, tied a knot in the end, and looked around for a bin. He tried not to notice Bela's rather clammy skin pressing into his, the smell of pheromonal sweat, his absurd rush of self-consciousness at being naked. He wished he were somewhere else. Anywhere else.
'Depends on what you're drowning in. Chocolate I could do.' Dean grins and Jo laughs, tossing her hair back. Dean loves bantering with Jo, it reminds him of Sam. But Jo isn't Sam, and Dean can't completely let loose with her, always has to keep a thin screen between them, even if it's only to reassure himself that he isn't encouraging her. This crush of hers will dissipate, given time. Dean is sure of that, he dated enough women in college to recognize Jo's type. She's sweet, charming, and much too good for Dean. Fragile deep down, though she doesn't act like it.
'Shut up, you mutant, how do you even function in the morning? Coffee.'
Cas cocks his head. 'Suit yourself. Are you sure it's okay if I try some?'
'Jesus, she's a piece of work, isn't she?' Cas doesn't answer and Dean turns to look over his shoulder. 'Hey.' Castiel's head is hanging down. 'Hey, what's wrong? Don't let her get to you, she's horrible to everyone. They call her Adolf Hester behind her back.' Cas lets out a laugh that sounds more like a sound of pain and Dean stops. He turns around completely to face Castiel. 'Cas. Hey,' he says again, and stops. He doesn't really know what to do. Castiel's eyes are glazed and he won't look at Dean. He's breathing too quickly. Dean feels a little overwhelmed. Everything's falling apart today. He needs to get this tray in before the guests start complaining, but something tells him this is more important. 'Wait here.' he says. 'I'll be back in a second.'
They used to sit in the grove of spruce trees in the crisp cold air, wrapped in their coats, booklet of dots and dashes open in front of them. Benny sometimes joined them, but he always got bored and wandered off to try to skateboard with Michael and Gabriel and the older kids. The skate park and the playground were only about 20 feet away, so Dean was able to keep an eye on Sammy while he and Cas tapped out letters and tried to memorize them. From then on, just the word 'code' made Dean recall the fragrance of spruce mingled with the metallic smell of freezing air and the sight of Cas' thin fingers tapping the ground.
John sighed again - a defeated sound. 'I know. I'm sorry about Christmas. You understand, don't you? This job's all I got.'
She patted him on the arm and leaned in for a hug. “Say no more. We both know Gabe talks a blue streak. I'll see you around soon enough, Young Novak, you can come for a drive with me in the R.V. when you have some free time.”
'Oh.' A man. Dean's heart leaps and stutters. He had wondered about Cas. It was a relief to know, but his happiness is short-lived. The look on Cas' face is like hurricane shutters, locked basements, acrid fear. 'That bad?'
At that, Dean felt...not uneasy, exactly...but confused. “I just knew it, I guess. Hey, what took you so long?”
“Cas!” Sam comes over and drops a number of styrofoam takeout boxes onto the bedside table. “Are you alright? What did they say?” He directs this last to Dean.
Castiel
“I like it here.” Dean wiped the sweat from his face with his sleeve. “Couple of repairs and it should be ship-shape.”
'What the hell, Sam?' Dean sighed. There was no venom in it, he was simply confused.
'Ten seconds.'
Dean put on a hugely offended expression and sat down, slouching in the chair. Cas smirked and began sketching with a pencil.
Bobby smiled. 'Yeah, me too.'
'We have one more stop to make,' Dean said, and a few minutes later they pulled up at a house that Sam didn't recognize. The downstairs lights were all on and Sam could tell there was a party going on; the driveway and the street out front were covered with parked cars.
here!'
He wakes up with a low, hoarse shout.
“This is unusual, isn't it?” It's not rhetorical. Some human customs still throw Cas for a loop.
“Dean. Think about it. When was the last time you saw him
And with that, Sam pulled Cas into the living room. By the time Dean came back in with cereal, bowls, milk, and spoons, Sam had opened the tin of cookies and he and Cas were sorting the presents by name. The shadow was almost gone from Cas' face.
Dean felt heat pour through him, dispelling the ice in his composure. 'It wasn't my idea. But I can't say I don't agree with it.' He glared at Cas.
Gabe smiled a sweet smile that fooled no one. “Nope. I have immunity. I'm the oldest.” He followed Jimmy into the kitchen and Castiel took the opportunity to hastily shove a few bills into the tip jar. He repositioned the jar so that it wasn't visible from the till. He knew his brothers wouldn't accept it, so he tucked money in the tip jar as often as he could. He jumped when Gabe's voice echoed out from the other room. “Cassie, ask me how my date went!”
Dean flashed him a thumbs-up, then stood, pointed to his open window, and waved to Cas. Cas waved back and turned off his light.
“What do you mean? He looks like Cas.”
'Pure unadulterated lust with no strings attached? Charming.'
Cas squirmed. 'Yeah.'
Ah. Dean supposed that made sense. 'So you looked at the mags and – what? Decided you were a Cosmo girl? Why - ' he shuddered ' - Cosmo?'
Dean clears his throat again and tries to stand. Cas grabs his arm and keeps him from rising. It's just as well, Dean doesn't think his legs could hold him. 'You look worried, Cas.' Dean tries to smile.
'Can't wait. Princess or not I'll whoop your ass.' Jo disappears laughing into the kitchen, pulling on her apron. Castiel catches up to Dean, but doesn't meet Dean's eyes.
Cas cleared his throat. 'Nope. I haven't talked to him since Thanksgiving.'
They all pile into the car, clambering over and around boxes and bags. The trip is mercifully short: Dean managed to find a coffee shop slash bistro just 20 minutes away from his place that was closing down. With his savings and a small loan from the bank (courtesy of his Sam-written business plan), he was able to make a down payment and still have enough left to fix it up and get it running. It's a sweet little gig, too. It was already fitted with a proper kitchen when Dean bought it, so all it needed was a little tweaking and redecorating. Dean thinks the redecorating was his favourite part. He, Cas, Jo, Chuck, and Kevin all spent days painting, moving furniture, hanging art on the walls, and setting up the sound system. There was a lot of laughter, a lot of food, and a lot of paint fighting (Dean has significantly fewer wearable shirts now). He's proud of the place, he can't help it. It just needs a few more finishing touches and it will be ready for the grand opening this afternoon. Dean is going to spend all morning baking what he couldn't make yesterday while Sam, Bobby, Jess, and Cas hang the rest of the art and decorate a bit for the opening.
Sam was skeptical. What was Dean thinking? 'Dean, I have to go. You're only allowed to miss three days of summer school.'
'It's my Christmas present to me!' Gabe chimed, and dashed off to get Dean's, leaving a trail of cookie crumbs.
'Where the hell have you been, Dean? It's 1 a.m. on a school night.'
'Dude, don't – do that thing you do.'
Suddenly, as it had the other day with Bela, Dean's world flipped. He'd felt the tinfoil-on-fillings shock as Cas had said the word 'kissing' but out of nowhere he recognized it as a mixture of happiness and anticipation. Dean was tired of fighting, tired of holding himself behind bars that he couldn't even remember putting up. Cas was right. So Dean cut him off. 'It's my fault. I...Cas, I was a dick to you, and I'm sorry.' There. He'd said it. He resisted the urge to bury his head in the sand or set himself on fire. He had no idea what he was doing now. But it felt right.
“Yes, sort of. It's a special one.”
'What, Sam? Stop looking at me like that.'
They started walking toward the door. Cas looked back at Dean. 'I'll pay you back with dinner. Seven, right?'
'Yes, a magazine, Ford Prefect. A little porn would probably be good for you. Or teach yourself to knit. Learn about cars. Just...figure it out. We'll be back in three days.'
Cas nods and Dean knows that Cas knows that Dean doesn't want to talk about it. 'I was supposed to be off at seven, but one of the girls needed help finishing off her corridor. I think I've bleached off a layer of skin or two.' Cas looks at his hands. 'I was just leaving and...it smells delicious in here. Did I interrupt you?' He ends without voicing the implied question, and Dean answers.
They both stop and turn sideways at the same time and laugh. Castiel looks surprised with himself, and Dean motions for him to squeeze by. Dean presses himself against the wall as Cas – hell with it, he can be Cas from now on – edges past him. There is a brief moment that lasts forever when Cas is directly in front of Dean: They're facing each other, inches apart, and Cas looks at him. Dean stops breathing and in an instant he's floored. Ozone. Chemical rush. Lightning. Then Cas looks away and nods his thanks, continues down the corridor, and Dean stands there, dumbfounded, reeling. Did he just - ?
? 'I guess not. It was hard to concentrate.'
After that, everyone scrambled around sticking the fireworks in the ground in a ragged line. Jess raced Sam to see who could line theirs up the quickest. When they were done Dean made Sam and Jess stand back and he, Cas, and Benny waited by the fireworks with their lighters. Benny stared at his watch.
Now they were driving his baby hours across the country ahead of the moving van to spend their first night in the house they had put a down payment on with John's life insurance, so Dean was stressed, to say the least. Bones did not help the situation. Dean wasn't all that fond of dogs, and absolutely detested having animals in the car, but Sam loved him and Dean loved Sam. They had been sharing a crappy apartment when Sam had been in college and Dean had been working at Bobby's, and they had long since learned to co-exist. It was cheaper for them to buy a house together than it was to rent separately, and they planned on selling the place after a few years and making enough that they could get their own places.
Sam was rewarded with a rare Cas-style smile; brief, wide, genuine. 'No, it's for you! What did you get in it?'
His father's eyes are blue. Blue? ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.
'Cas, man, that's just creepy. What smells so good? What time is it?'
'Did I offend you? Or something?'
'You're crazy.' Dean sat up and rubbed his eyes. Sam could see him struggling not to be grumpy, and because it was Christmas morning and Sam was hyper, that seemed pretty funny. 'Merry Christmas, Sammy.'
They were in the middle of signaling as they usually did when several things happened at once. Dean was focusing on writing down the letters that Cas was sending (W-H-A-T-D-O-Y-O-U-G) when Cas jumped up. The suddenness made Dean flinch. Cas' door flew open and Dean saw a flurry of red hair as Anna closed it quickly and leaned against it. Her mouth was moving, her eyes were fixed on Castiel. Cas pressed his back against the window, the wrinkles and shapes of his clothes becoming two-dimensional on the glass. Dean could see him shaking his head. No. Cas reached over to turn on his light and Dean heard, faintly, through glass, someone pounding on Cas' bedroom door. Light spilled from the lamp and flooded the room, seeped out the window, made Dean squint. Anna flung herself onto Cas' bed with her hands over her ears and Cas crossed to her, touched her shoulder. Dean saw that his eyes were wide and scared. Cas moved to pull Anna's hands away from her ears but she shoved him, hard, sent him sprawling back against the window. Dean heard the thump and winced again. Dean was frozen, watching Cas' parents get through the door. He saw Cas move again. He looked. Cas was facing him. Cas shook his head, mouthed something – no or sorry – was Cas even looking at him? - and twitched the curtains closed.
'Cas, you sexy bastard.'
Cas looked at him and Dean thought he saw a brief hint of relief. 'Me too.'
'Dad came home last night, Dean! He brought all this stuff. Your stocking is there.' Dean raised his eyebrows at that and cast a swift glance at his door. 'He's gone again already though.'
'So you've said. Should I call someone?'
'Do you want me to?'
“What I always do. What's the big deal?” Dean's voice has increased in volume.
Jimmy rolled his eyes and drifted back to the kitchen, talking to Cas over his shoulder as he went. “Come by later, we can talk recipes!”
'Exactly. Glassblowing is just a slower version of the process. It gives you more control. Some might argue that less control makes for more interesting pieces. Frozen lightning is beautiful, but I prefer usefulness to aesthetic.'
'Dean? What is it?'
Cas nodded. 'Yes. Apparently it's a digestive stimulant.'
Crowley's place was on the other side of the tracks and no, that wasn't just an expression. Crowley technically lived in the next neighborhood over, even though he was only a few streets away across the ancient train tracks. He lived in a duplex in a row of duplexes with small bricked-over lawns out front. Weeds grew up at the corners of the houses, and one of Crowley's upstairs windows was completely covered with that ugly brown packing tape. Dean had no idea why. The place was small, so everyone mostly hung out in Crowley's garage. It seemed to be a sort of open house 24/7. At any given time, a strange mish-mash of people could be found there playing music, drawing on the walls with permanent markers, making out, experimenting with cheap tattoo guns, selling dodgy pills with little clip-art pictures of palm trees on them, or buying dodgy pills with little clip-art pictures of palm trees on them.
Dean fixes them some dinner, and Jo says, in between mouthfuls of egg-yolk-coated pasta, 'Why don't you just stay here tonight, if you're going to come back at six anyway? The sofa pulls out.'
The dream hangs over Dean and his hands won't stop shaking. He goes to work early and ends up burning the morning's breakfast pastries.
Dean puts a styrofoam box in front of Cas and hands one to Sam. “Dig in.”
'What should I do while you're gone?' he'd asked, stony-faced, arms hanging uselessly by his sides.
'Knew I kept you around for a reason.'
There was a renewed peal of laughter from the doorway and Sam clutched at his ribs. Thinking of Cas reading Cosmo was like imagining Genghis Khan at a tea party. Dean wasn't sure if Cas was even capable of embarrassment, but he didn't want to risk offending him, so he swallowed his laughter. 'Cas, what's going on with you? With the bear and the Snickers and saying weird stuff?'
Dean smirks and picks up his sandwich. 'Yeah, totally. Who wouldn't want to earn their callouses scrubbing taps?'
Dean looked up. 'I didn't know you could draw like this, Cas.'
Uncle Bobby opened the front door and walked out into the headlights. Sam watched him approach, light settling into a halo around him. A million questions swirled and sparked in his head, but he could only manage to ask one out loud. 'How soon?'
Castiel gagged, the taste of ash heavy on his tongue. Just a dream, he told himself firmly. It's not real. He forced himself to lie still, to loosen each of his muscles one by one, to relax into the comfort of his bed. The tension unwound. The taste faded. His room swam into clearer focus. He concentrated on the familiar wallpaper and bright wooden furniture. The smell of home, the patterns of early morning sunlight on the walls that he could have traced with his eyes closed. All of the sensations as integral to his mornings as waking itself. Deep breaths. Don't worry about inhaling smoke. There is no fire.
'Hi,' Dean smiles. 'I was just thinking. If you wanted, I could have a word with Naomi, and try to get her to reassign you to one of the other attendants. One that doesn't resemble a dictator. She owes me one for working all those last-minute double shifts.'
'What are you two, the freaking Spanish inquisition? Don't you have work to do? Get!'
His thoughts were interrupted by Inias' voice. “Castiel? Are you in here?”
, Cas?!'
. 'Thanks for helping me with all this stuff, Benny.'
'It's for you. I thought that it would be useful.'
Sam strode in, a bag in his hand that smelled fantastic. “What's wrong with it?”
'Cas brought it over.'
“Dean?”
He remembered fireworks painting the sky, a map of friendship, the sizzle and fizz and explosion of sparks. The singed grass. The warmth of a hand in his, the fingers tapping out a secret. Joy.
The carpet scraped his palms as he pushed himself up and looked over at the new kid.
'I brought some.... Could I...? It's Anna. ...parents.'
'Thank you for the cake. It was amazing. Do you...want to take it back? There's no way I could eat it all.'
'I'm happy for him. He's on his own, making something of his life.'
Cas' eyebrows shot up so fast he was surprised he didn't sprain something. 'Are you hitting on me with tarot cards?'
Dean realizes that he's staring at Cas, leaning in closer, and he snaps back to himself, pulls back. He clears his throat. Cas looks back down at the cake and takes another bite. His eyes mist over. They sit in silence for a few moments.
But while Benny understood Dean's confusion, only Cas really understood Dean's loneliness. Dean's life at Sonny's was so remote and distant from Dean's life with Sam and their dad that the two parts of Dean might as well have been on separate planets. Dean felt as isolated from his family as Cas felt from his. Anna, after a brief time at home, was in Larned State again, Gabriel was busy preparing to leave for college, and Cas had never been that close to Michael.
'Michael has a strange sense of justice.' Cas hands Dean the cake to hold on his lap.
'Only just. The movers can get the furnaces, but we can take in the smaller stuff.'
I'm telling you dude. Two werewolves. One bullet. That was
Jack...yeah. Good move, sending him off to Jody’s. If dad found out about what happened with mom...he wouldn’t take it well.

Oh, I, well. I may have exaggerated. Or lied.
All better!
No...no we can’t do that...we tell him and then...then...
But look, we just don’t have enough to go on to do anything else. If dad’s away from us,the angels can’t use him against us.
Thank you, Dean.
Castiel, he said that John Winchester was not a good man, and not a good father. But, why would a parent hurt their children?

We could ask him to leave.

I don’t need to be protected, okay? I want to help!
Yes. But Sam and Dean, they weren’t as lucky as you were. We never let your father get you, you’ve always had us here for you. Sam and Dean...it was just them and John for a long time. It has left them...damaged.
Lay off Cas, dad. What’s your problem with him, anyways?
Rumors?
And text Cas when you get there!
Yeah. That was heaven!
Yeah. Right. I mean, mom sure as hell didn’t.
You've gotta stop avoiding him, man.
So Sam and Dean, they had a bad father, too.
I...I think so.
But Sam and Dean said they didn’t want to send him back.
Yeah. I do. I kill monsters.
Yeah, you’re a feminist like that.

You heard what I said.
