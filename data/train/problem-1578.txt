He grabbed a startled Sherlock and dragged him into a  clumsy embrace, and held him tight until he felt in control of his vocal  chords.
Contrary to expectations, this simple - perhaps too simple - expression of gratitude etches sorrow into the lines around those beloved blue eyes.
A frown still mars Sherlock's brow at the thought of John having to bear the brunt of their friends' initial anger. He finds himself wanting to apologize in advance, too, but Dr. Hughes has taught John - and John has been teaching Sherlock - to replace as many apologies as possible with expressions of gratitude instead. Something to do with skewed perceptions of self worth, and creating more positive and healthful conversations, per the therapist.
There are more anecdotes about early interactions as the two men clear the table and do the washing up; Mary laughing at John over a paper cup of admittedly terrible office coffee, Mary introducing John to different sandwich shops and making him try all her favorites, Mary challenging John to find her a satisfactory Massaman in return for discovering that he does in fact like miso egg yolk aioli on chicken and cheese toasties.
By  mutual and silent agreement, the intimacy experiment was kept private.  John didn’t presume outside the flat or when they had visitors, and he  didn’t notice Sherlock angling for anything during those times either.  But when it was just the two of them at Baker Street, Sherlock circled  him like a touch-starved cat trying to pretend aloofness, and John  indulged in going into all-out Infatuated New Boyfriend mode.
"Outlines for an autobiography?" he hesitantly but lightheartedly prompts, once the silence stretches out a bit.
"You were going to propose, but you didn't. And now you're here, with me." There's more confidence in his voice than he actually has in his heart, and he gives himself away in the way he clutches a bit tighter at the folds of John's vest.
A simple phrase, but loaded, for them. The breath catches in Sherlock's throat and his face must do something rather alarming, because in the next moment John is rushing to recant.
"The kisses will keep, but the groceries won't. Come and help me, and then I'll tell you where your microscope's hidden, and you can have all the kisses you want."
Sherlock picks up the file left on the coffee table and scowls in disgust to find that it's a security problem for him to solve for the government after all, rather than a file on John. Now that he's begun to read it, however, his curiosity demands that he finish consuming the information laid out before him.
"Think of it this way," Marcus says calmly, which just makes John all the more irritable. When you throw a stone into a pond, you want to at least see a splash and get some ripples. Marcus Hughes is just...oobleck.
Wonderful, clever, surprising John Watson, taking his role as Sherlock's enrichment team so very seriously. Wanting to provide the caged consulting detective with something to play with, since they can't go out into the world yet to chase down criminals.
waiting," John eventually clarifies, picking the primary conversational thread back up. "But not for a way out. I was thinking your list of requests probably has orgasms on it somewhere, and we'd get 'round to it whenever you were ready to ask for them."
"Hm, shall I read to you out of my old textbooks, then?" John snickers. "Take you on a fascinating tour of the carpals?"
“Will  this do for now?” he asked, faux-nonchalant, and aggressively forced  himself into the corner that John was still half-occupying.
"It's been...good," Sherlock continues, trying to form his feelings into thoughts. "With just the two of us." And he doesn't want to lose it, or even lose sight of it. Dilute it, or diminish it in any way. He wants some parts of his old life back, certainly, but by no means all of it. Not the loneliness he can now admit to, or the jealousy and the fears he'd refused to acknowledge.

1. John lacks meaningful relationships in his life, and would like to change this. (Yes, even if the thing with Sherlock doesn't pan out.)
"Seems a good mix of the two of you," John murmurs while looking at the picture again, missing the near identical looks of surprise from Geoffrey's brothers.
Sherlock is surprised at how light they are before realizing he's expecting physical weight equal to the emotional impact they contain. The impulse to hold them carefully collides with the desire to crush them tight, and both get tangled up in a sudden urge to literally consume them. In this shaken-up state, Sherlock trusts himself not one bit to speak clearly and coherently, but he cannot say
"Tell me about her?" he asks, and John's relieved smile puts a better glow in his chest than the Earl Grey.
He doesn't know if the vision will ever be brought to life, but it's a pleasant method of self-discipline.
Simple confusion morphs into a slightly more wary concern on John's face, and when it seems like he's got mired in a mental muck of not knowing what to say next, Sherlock decides that a bit more verbal prompting may well be in order.
"I also want to apologize, not just say that I grieve for your sake. I want you to know that I never stopped regretting that one of the last things I said to you was that you were a machine. I hope you knew even then that I didn't mean it and never believed it. A robot would never endure what you have to keep its friends safe. A sociopath wouldn't
"The forecast calls for rain again, tonight," Mycroft mentions. "Do be sure to wrap up well, if you decide to nip out for some takeaway or a brief walk through the park."
John admits with some sheepishness that she'd set the pace and he'd done nothing but go along with it all. He'd only really realized the scope of their relationship when she'd asked him to pick the restaurant for their three month anniversary.
“He’s infuriating,” John continues, grinning idiotically despite himself. It’s fine; her office has blackout curtains and top of the line soundproofing, and he pays her well to keep his secrets.
“I did no such thing,” Sherlock snapped. “Donovan asked me where ‘the boyfriend’ was. You are, among other things, a boyfriend, as you are - most unfortunately - in a romantic relationship with a self-styled ‘cat walker and fit-finder extraordinaire’. I never claimed that you were
“And DON’T pretend you don’t know who I’m talking about!” John added, flicking one finger loose from around his mobile so that he could stab the air with it.
Sherlock utters a noise that was meant to be a succinct interrogative phrase but ends up sounding more like a three inch tall goose honking. It makes a wisp of a smile appear on John's face, so, not a complete loss.
Almost everyone has roots. Those without even that bare minimum requirement tend to end up with various ICD-10 codes slapped on to them like safety labels. Beyond that, there are no hard and fast rules that a person's bloom must abide by.
cards - have moved from the coffee table to the couch, misaligned edges just visible beyond the curve of John's hip.
John will gleefully commit all sorts of crimes, but he is still an honorable man. He may not always behave in accordance with the law, but he consistently acts in defense of what is
“You’d be terrible at it anyway; I can hardly get you alongside for a case without you wandering off to make eyes at the primary suspect’s younger sister.”
-  he was left to offer intimacies on his own terms and timing. Mostly it  was letting himself give in to all the little impulses he’d been  strangling down prior to being given carte blanche on expressions of  affection; touching Sherlock every time they neared each other, dropping  little kisses good morning and good night and to mark all the moments  of eye contact in between, and cuddling Sherlock into a halfway decent  sleep schedule once the detective began invading his bed.
In a contradictory fit, Sherlock finds himself seized with the urge to ask for something absolutely outrageous, just to see how far and wide John's "whatever" stretches. (Let's move to France tomorrow; we'll grow lavender and keep bees and raise chickens, and you have to kiss me good morning and good night every day until one of us dies of old age. I'll gather honey and learn to make scones, and if I get stroppy you can make me eggy toast and thus remind me that you are to be appreciated.) With a frown and huff, he forces himself to take the self-prescribed smallest of small steps, promising himself more if only he'll be patient.
"Yeah, yeah of course." John puts action to word and sweeps them off the table to deposit them in Sherlock's waiting palm.
"I have to thank you for...well, everything else, too. I don't believe it's an exaggeration to say that you saved my life the night I returned, and I've no doubts that you did so over and over again in the weeks following. Your dedication to my well-being is...beyond words."
"Well, if you ask me," she says (and John decidedly has not nor ever would have), "you just need a little more confidence."
The conversation seems to be over for now, as John then digs up the remote for the telly from behind a couch cushion. There are a thousand and one things Sherlock wants to say, but he is well and truly wrung out, and finishing his cuppa seems to be about the only thing he has strength for. Perhaps, if his luck holds, he'll wake up to renewed energy, a fried egg, and the chance to talk with a friend.
Only in the literal sense, of course, what with Sherlock's still shaky state of health and John's insistence upon a glacial pace when it comes to advancing in their physical intimacies. Sherlock had pouted a bit when John had trotted
John's eyebrows knit together a bit, and Sherlock realizes he's used some rather unflattering adjectives there, and that is probably A Bit Not Good when one is discussing romantic love with the person that one is in romantic love with.
And then Greg tucks the notebook into a jacket pocket, folds his hands atop the table, and raises an eyebrow at his boss.
He also gets to see John close his eyes and struggle to even out his breathing. Their foreheads touch, or John will nuzzle into his collarbone or hair, like he wants to increase contact even as he dials back the tension. The kisses often resume, but they're quick and sweet, or smacking and silly. Sometimes they'll tease John's self-control again, and other times they'll move on to other things.
"It didn't last forever," John says, which honestly is not as reassuring as he probably meant it to be. Sherlock knows how the mind can make time seem to drag on and draw out. Now does not seem the time for an apology, however. A novice he may be when it comes to emotion and empathy, but knows enough to understand that sometimes, confessions and contriteness are purely for the benefit of the sinner, and harm more than heal the one already wounded.
He shakes his head as emphatically as he can within the grip of John's hands, strangles out a "No" before choking on all the rest of it. He can't find words for how wrong this explanation is, how it simply does not fit into the fabric of the universe no matter which way one turns it. John lifts his head up, blinks a bit as he moves back and looks at him. They're staring at each other from a handspan away, gazes drifting to trace the lines of pain that must be etched on each other's faces but always flitting back to lock eyes.
“I am keenly aware,” Sherlock sniffed, turning away again, but this time with a bit of his usual haughty air.
Sherlock is less cooperative, for one. The consulting detective seems to want to slip right back into the life he'd abandoned over a year ago, as if his time as a fugitive and felon had been nothing more than another one of his disguises, easily slipped off once he's done with it. Everyone around them relies on Sherlock's personal account of his time away and accepts his reassurances that he's only lost a bit of ground due to a nasty fever, but John was there; if not on scene, at least for some of the aftermath.
He thinks about the mirror, and looking into it, and then turns back to thoughts of simple pleasures previously taken for granted.
"Did you buy exercise equipment?" He mentally begs for the answer to be in the negative, or if affirmative, to be solely for John's own use.
Seconds tick by, and he doesn't bound outside, crying out for John to come along, to hurry, to keep up. Two years in purgatory and two months in paradise, and suddenly he's faced with an unguarded door through which to walk, and an unexpected uncertainty about what awaits him on the other side.
But there will be time for all that. Right now, he just wants to sit a little while longer on the sofa with John, ignored by absolutely everyone else, taking advantage of a rest well-earned and sorely needed.
"Maybe you ought to keep hidden away at first," John chuckles, apparently having envisioned similar scenarios. "I'll lure her upstairs with tea and talk, and then you can pop out when I've got her occupied with a jaffa cake or something else nice and soft, in case she's in a throwing mood."
Small things at first; clothes, shoes, books, toys. One day Mycroft's minions crowd into the flat to set up new furnishings in the upstairs bedroom. John doesn't comment; just silently packs up the collapsible cot.
(...though, how exactly do you mean, when you say you love me? As a friend? Like the brother you don't have, or a brother in arms? Or like your sister; also an addict and a pain in your arse? If we have to sit close together, will you cross your arms, or put one of them around my shoulders? Or can we hide our tangled fingers together in the space between our thighs? Would you rest your hand on my knee and let me cover it with mine? Would you hold my hand outside the flat, where people could see? Huddled in a dark alley, chasing after a kidnapper, walking through the park? Would you sit with me at Angelo's with a candle on the table and a ring box in your hand?)
"I'm not ready," he clarifies, small voiced and shamefaced. Where had John found the courage to read his beautiful note aloud? Sherlock cannot even bring himself to talk about it without squirming. "The...the note is finished, but I..."
“Why did Greg just text me congratulating me on 'you two finally getting your heads out of your arses’?!” he demanded, brandishing his phone like an accusation.
Sherlock blinks, glances at his notecards still lying in the other man's palms as if to make sure that he had in fact given them to him, and then has to think.
"They don't, at least not in the way you're clumsily implying. My work and methods are interesting, and John's enough of an arsehole himself that my personality doesn't put him off, is all. We get on quite well, really."
John had no speeches  planned, he’d not dreamed of this moment. But he couldn’t have fought  his way through all the battlefields of his life without instinct, and  it served him just as well in peacetime as it did in war. He knew what  Sherlock was asking, and knew what Sherlock needed to hear.
Sherlock sips, flinches at the cool water, winces when he finally remembers how to swallow. He’s feeling so much better (healthier, cleaner, not teetering so close to the brink of death) than he ought to but this doesn’t mean any part of him feels
Once the last bulleted item is attested to, Mycroft has him review the rota of agents - MI5 and MI6 and even some CIA - sent out to worm their way into those organizations that remain, and monitor those that may arise in the future. Sherlock has a few questions, but in the end, no protests. There are strands left of Moriarty's web that would be unwise to dismiss, and potentially more dangerous are the gaps where nothing remains but a memory. There are always those who see such expanses of burned and salted ground and consider it an opportunity rather than a warning.
Sherlock is suddenly breathless and wanting all over again, and finds boldness hiding underneath desire.
He attacks the largest box first, and finds it crammed full of small-ish tubes and jars and tubs. Curiosity well and truly piqued now, Sherlock picks up the first item to catch his eye and gives it a cursory examination. He picks up a cello-wrapped three-pack of squeeze bottles next. He sets both back down hastily and grabs a jar, turning it in his hands to check the label. That done, he sets the container gingerly back down and casts a somewhat wary eye over the contents of the box as a whole.
S: Such a scam. They only use a tiny bit of the organic material in the "seed" to start the crystal. I would cremate you and then compact your ashes. You'd probably produce about three liters. That would be enough to make a box or bowl if I encased you in resin, and that's much more useful a memento mori.
He has a great deal to sort through and arrange in his Mind Palace, and knows that he won't be able to resist a bit of awestruck review and replay as he does so. In John's arms is as good a place as any to be while he works. In point of fact, he cannot think of a better.
Once he's patted dry and deodorized and his dressings deemed intact, Sherlock laboriously climbs into pants and pyjamas and lets John wrap him in a robe and two pairs of socks as well. He begins perspiring a bit, but decides it's better than risking a chill or muscle cramps.
Sherlock stared at the  laxative commercial currently on-screen as if solving a locked-vault  quintuple murder depended on it. The silence from his couchmate was  unnerving, but soon enough John snorted and settled against his  shoulder.
Apologies in advance; it may take me a bit to get the next chapter posted. I'm writing three chapters at once, in a way, and if I scrap a bit in chapter 11, I end up having to re-write a good bit of chapter 9, interconnected as they're turning out to be. To avoid post-posting edits, I'm going to wait until chapter 11 is at least fleshed out in a satisfactory manner before posting chapter 9.
"I don't know," is as good as he can come up with, in the end. Psychiatrists and psychologists and therapists of all types have had him under their care but never did him much good that he can recall. Then again, Sherlock had been bribed, coerced, and threatened into most of those appointments; there had been a distinct lack of engagement and effort on his end, to put it mildly.
“If they were all equally effective I was simply going to mix them all together for the second round of experiments,” Sherlock continues, “which would have been to test for the lowest effective volume against the usual dosage administered in assault cases.”
"Obvious," Sherlock replies - some habits die hard indeed - and then he's off, pointing out all the details that've been acquired since he woke up and found himself reinstated at Baker Street. At first he only explains what he's deduced from John's hair and socks and abducted from the dust and placement of certain books and what-nots in his bedroom, plus some supplemental notes from this morning's foray into the bath and living room. An inference about utensils, however, segues into the quality of chicken breast - and the one egg - he's been served during his recuperation so far, and that in turn leads to his declaration that Mycroft is in charge of the shopping.
Before  the man could throw anything more than a glare at him, John sidled up,  slipped a hand around his flatmate’s waist, and dropped an apologetic  smooch onto one shoulder.
"Married to your work, you said, and I was already...I mean we'd just met but...it stung, more than it should've. So I always made sure I responded first after that, whenever anyone mistook us for more than friends. Always jumped to make it clear that we weren't. I didn't want to have to hear it again, d'you see?"
I’m so sorry. I didn’t  know what it was like to really lose someone who was so much of my life.  But I know now and I know it’s too late and you’re so angry but John
by picking up the notecards, they circle his wrists instead. Beneath their interlocked arms, the cards are now pinned down and most of the writing covered. The emotional time bomb hasn't been disarmed, exactly, but Sherlock finds he can breathe much easier now, and gathers enough courage to look up.
But John is always there, nearly constantly in contact as he instructs and guides. Calloused hands adjust Sherlock's limbs, steady his hips, and modify his stances. Sherlock strains to maintain poses for as long  as he can for the sole purpose of not losing contact with the warm palm cupping his elbow or the fingertips pressing into the small of his back, and is rewarded for his efforts with kisses dropped to the nearest bit of skin; cheek, bicep, shoulderblade. Once in a while, his stomach.
, but surely John has seen enough of Sherlock's body to take a decent guess at his measurements, no matter where he falls on the "show or grow" scale?
Sherlock sets about beginning the positive reinforcement straight away, by treating the both of them to a long, drawn-out kiss tasting of butter and honey and lazy afternoons.
(Sentiment, but this is not grit in the guts of his microscope; he is being crushed under a truckload of gravel. Oh John, John,
John kisses back immediately. Of course he does. It doesn't even take Sherlock by surprise anymore, that his affection is reciprocated, and his desire met and matched with enthusiasm. He doesn't have to remind himself that he can kiss, and touch, and let his smiles stretch as fond and wide as he wants. Blunt fingernails scratch their way up his back as John tries to draw him closer though they're already plastered to each other, and Sherlock thinks up dozens of new experiments on the spot.
A tiny thrill of vindication sparks briefly, but there are too many what-ifs and regrets over time and opportunities wasted to want to breathe any life into it.
Sherlock takes stock both physically and mentally - his emotional status is pushed hastily aside for now, too tangled and messy to sort out at a moment's notice - while raising himself up to a less spinally taxing position. John is perched near him; no longer pressed close, but not so far away as he'd been directly after the shower, either.
Decades of near-constant isolation, both externally enforced and self-imposed, and then he finally meets someone who jolts him awake and makes him feel alive enough to want
I apologize,” he  rushed to say. “I apologize. I’m truly, truly sorry, I am. I shouldn’t  have said…well, any of it. You know me, you know me so well. I get angry  and just blurt out all sorts of horrid things, and you know I don’t  really mean it, yeah? It’s no excuse and I’ll do my best to watch my  words from now on, but you have to know that they were just words, just  angry noises. Don’t take any of it to heart, please.”
And so he slips into the country quietly, unofficially, only contacting Mycroft to demand 24 hours and John's location. His brother texts back with a time, the name of a restaurant, and a warning.
John is feeling rather good about all the amazing progress they're making, which is of course when Marcus claps his hands together with a smile and says,
"Well done! That's Mycroft out of our hair for a few weeks at least. Do shed that ridiculous get-up John. I'll make tea."
Some are sparkling, like sinking into a warm bubble bath and watching the foam rise up around one's body. Smiles and grins and outright laughs.
They have an extended snuggle session that turns into a light doze, and are startled into wakefulness and giggles by someone's stomach giving a startlingly loud growl. They both deny ownership of the noise but agree that preparing and then eating lunch together would be an acceptable passtime, and then begin unfolding themselves from the chair.
"Still a two," Sherlock replies, glad of an easy question. "Nociceptive, except for my shoulder, but even there I feel improved. I have fewer flare-ups, even though there's no improvement in my range of motion."
The soothing press of one hand trapped between John's forearm and palm. "Just absolutely brilliant."
Some things have changed. They only have to dodge CCTV cameras (and sometimes the Met), because John no longer has a security detail. He also doesn't have to miss out on any interesting cases for work, which is good. This gives the two men many more opportunities to get on each other's nerves, which is not as good. John still storms out sometimes, but he's getting better at checking his temper before it can master him, and Sherlock has learned to keep his mouth shut and give his companion a minute when he grinds out from behind clenched teeth that he needs one.
The doctor leans over to pick up the med kit on the floor before standing, and with a soft breath of relief, Sherlock begins squirming out of his garment. Just a routine check, then. He deliberately tries not to suss out the reason for the stern look upon the other man's face, not wanting to risk irritating his physician with inattention.
"What? No?" John follows his gaze and then brightens. "Oh, fantastic! These are for you, too. Why don't you go ahead and open them all up while I sort out the groceries."
He straightens up a bit and looks up into those cherished blue eyes, reddened now with regret. His own are stinging, and he'd be hard pressed to determine whether it's from remorse for what he's done, or gratitude that they've survived it.
Definitely clever, Sherlock thinks, as he settles himself into the leather armchair. Mary had clearly seen John's passivity and lack of engagement, so to speak, and taken steps to shore up the relationship. Initiates a three month anniversary celebration to kill two birds with one stone; not only is John suddenly aware of the actual date they'd become a couple, he'll feel the need to reciprocate by planning their six month do.
Sherlock deflates a bit, but then rallies as he determines that there is yet a simple and effective way to salvage this situation.
Nothing. He knocked as politely as he knew how; an apology for the angry pounding he’d dealt the door earlier.
"Er...not done?" John amends, confused by the mangled vocable. "Which is completely fine; it took me weeks to put my--"
Greg mulls this over. He's well aware that his boss has been attempting to woo Sherlock Holmes into his arms, and failing that, at least into his bed. Getting repeatedly turned down flat over hasn't exactly done wonders for John Watson's mood and manner, but still, Greg approves of this budding...
John’s  stubborn, crossed-arm, scowling squat outside of Sherlock’s bedroom  door lasted only eight minutes. Embarrassment over his part in their  argument and this admittedly childish strategy of his - his best  friend’s bratty behavior being no proper excuse - smoothed his frown out  into merely a somewhat worried expression. Shifting so that he was more  perpendicular to the door, he listened to the ongoing silence with a  prickle of concern.
"You're welcome to try now," Sherlock suggests, not quite confident enough to try adding bedroom eyes or dropping his voice to a more seductive register. He's shammed it before for cases, but it is an entirely different endeavor when one adds real emotion to the mix. That he is brave enough to flirt at all, even, is only thanks to John proving over and again that his self-control is enough to keep desire in check.
Instead of letting him have the last word, John snatched up the argument and stomped right after him. The twists and turns of this conversation were a bit beyond him, but he remembered one thing at least; Sherlock was wrong and he was right.
John is up again, looking at his phone briefly before pocketing it. There are footsteps coming up, measured and unhurried and
It  was a perfectly reasonable thing to say, and had nothing to do with the  smoldering coal of jealousy that took up residence in his gullet when  he imagined Sherlock slouched in Lestrade’s chair or even worse his lap,  or sprawled out over his desk like a decadent--
“Not very long at all, I’m afraid.” Sherlock then dissolves into an extended giggle fit, then straightens up in surprise once he realizes what he’s doing. “Oh, mine just kicked in.”
John takes a freezing cold shower to wake himself up while forcing himself through twenty sets of a breathing exercise to calm himself down, apologizes to a wide-eyed housekeeping staffmember when he finds her already sweeping up the aftermath of his temper tantrum, and then calls Dr. Hughes.
Instead of answering, Sherlock shakes loose everything he can and quickly scrapes up the little white stars, transferring them to John's palm.
up, maybe have a fried egg with his toast and tea, or a roast drumstick or two instead of shredded chicken in his rice and broth, sit in his chair and actually use the loo.
“Feed me honey toast.” (Though that might have just been Sherlock being Sherlock, and not part of the experiment.)
Sherlock’s  hands were already bloodless-tight around his cup, and now they  squeaked even tighter. John thought he could hear the molecules grinding  together and becoming something new.
"And how do your talents intersect with his interests?" Mycroft continues, prompting an impatient sigh from his younger brother. As if Sherlock is so dim-witted that he'd fall prey to someone - other than Mycroft - wishing to use him for his knowledge or connections.
Case in point; Sherlock refuses to be John's only "real" relationship, and instead of telling the brunet to get stuffed, John invites his head of security to his primary residence for a five course meal, probably just so that he can say he had someone over for dinner.
Sometimes Sherlock glances at them, clenches his jaw and wants to get it over with. Mostly he looks anywhere but, and is grateful for the reprieve. Today has been exhausting and wonderful and he doesn't dare hope for any additional miracles. Having dinner together, watching a movie while sitting companionably close on the old couch, and then curling up in bed to hope for a dreamless sleep is the height of his ambitions for the remainder of the evening.
“The neuralizers, John! They’ll nebulize every date rape drug, but when mixed together and then drinked all together, they act like a drug too. Like a…a…sheep in wolf’s wool. But I’m a genius, so there’s hardly any ill effects! It’s a clean, non-addictive high, John! I’m
John seems to be able to focus so well on a single good that he is blinded to any faults scattered around it. Despite awkwardly rebuffed flirtations and cut-off explanations and not half-eaten plates, John clutches his useless cane and declares a willingness to go back to Angelo's, and soon. And despite Donovan and Anderson and Mycroft, John bats away the rapidly unfurling bloom now crowding into his field of vision, grins up at Sherlock, and takes the room upstairs.
"May I have them?" he asks on impulse, "To keep, I mean." It's sentimentality at its most puerile. He can practically hear Mycroft's eyebrow twitching, almost feel that scornful gaze heavy upon his neck. This is one step above asking John to nip down to the local florist's for rose petals to be pressed and dried and used as a fragrant lining for the teak keepsake box that the notecards will be enthroned in.
They're disguising themselves as workpersons here to effect some extensive rennovations or repairs, judging from the noise they're making. Perhaps the mold problem in C was falsely exaggerated. In addition to providing security, they're sneaking in the shopping and whatever other supplies you request disguised as equipment and building materials. Heavy footsteps come up the stairs, then go down, quicker and lighter. Ah, and they're also sneaking out the rubbish for you. Their presence also explains the continued use of electricity and water despite Mrs. Hudson being absent, should anyone be inspired to pull utility bills.
"My job is helping people improve their mental and emotional wellness. And it's a hard slog, trying to help patients who are dragged kicking and screaming into my office by a parent or partner or what have you. If
"Oh. Er...well, ta for that." The frown lines melted away into pleased surprise. With a much softened tone and a rueful smile, John repeated his request for assistance. "Help me with this bloody-minded bow tie?"
Several times since that night at the gallery, Sherlock has found himself wondering at the speed and ease with which they've become friends. Or as close to friends as two such broken men can ever become. Their jagged edges are cracked in just the right shapes to fit fairly well together. It's good, what they have right now. John is busy with work and Sherlock is busy with The Work. They spend enough time apart that they're generally happy to see each other when they can, and if tempers flare, there's nothing stopping John from storming out before the sparks can lead to scorched earth.
"Figured you deserved more," John replies easily. He's got one arm draped across the back of the sofa, and his body is angled toward Sherlock. He looks inviting. He looks content. Sherlock suddenly wants nothing more than to lean forward, curl into him and climb onto his lap and begin claiming the promised kisses, but there are entirely too many faux workmen still milling about in the background.
, of course it's good; it's wonderful and perfect and a miracle but like all miracles it's more than mere mortal frame was designed to handle. Sherlock's next breath escapes as a strangled sob and John - healer, protector,
"The anger's not the problem, John. The anger's natural. You don't eat; you get hungry. You remember mistreatment; you get angry. You have to decide if you want to use your time and energy wishing you could change things that've already happened, or if you'd like to be more productive with the time you have left on this planet."
The choice of materials upon which to experiment is a bit unexpected, but then again, Sherlock could hardly expect John to think of texting the agents downstairs with requests for human organs.
The next delivery of supplies is brought up by Mycroft's minions as usual, but not just to the landing. Sherlock perks up from his slouch on the sofa, eagerly latching on to the new data sources as they set boxes and bags down in the living room or kitchen, depending on whether they're carrying groceries or non-kitchen related supplies. The first item to be delivered is a bright pink gift bag, handed off to John and then carried over to the sofa with a grin.
. It may be the worst tragedy the UK has ever witnessed. It may also be the only thing stopping Sherlock from dropping dead of shock (92%) and joy (8%) right there on the couch.
have done something (terrible? wonderful?) to John, and it keeps taking Sherlock's breath away. Instead of knee-jerk reactions and emotion-fueled decisions, there are carefully considered, measured responses being given him that Sherlock feels in no way deserving of.
"Was afraid you'd destroy the flat," John mused. He stroked the crook of Sherlock's elbow, and hummed thoughtfully at the shiver it produced. "Looks like you were lonesome, not sulky."
John giggles while gesturing grandly at the many scattered components of future experiments waiting to be designed.
"No change from this morning. The pain is still at a two, and I was careful not to overextend my shoulder..." He trails off as he notices John shake his head. Had he misunderstood the question somehow?
"A bit? Actually, yes," he answers in some surprise, then crinkles his eyebrows together at John. And? What of it? Are you not going to read my cards?
"Let me phrase it a different way," Dr. Hughes says, still smiling that calm, serene, yoga and Xanax smile. "What does it matter?"
Sherlock finds that he needs a moment to re-orient his mindset. He's been two years away and then for several weeks, either unconscious or trying very hard not to think of John (John John
"Keep talking," he says (orders, demands, begs), and the roughness in his voice and the sudden scratch of his fingers down Sherlock's back has the brunet gasping and arching into the biting kisses being laid along his collarbone. "I'll be able to take care of at least one more request in a few minutes."
"Call first next time," John retorts, keeping the gun in his hand for just long enough to make it plain that when he finally does tuck it into the back of his jeans, he's not doing it because Mycroft says to. Sherlock doesn't bother hiding his grin.
"Do you have any more?" he asks, glancing up and then craning his neck to look over at the desk. "They come in packs of a hundred, don't they? Could I? Would you mind, if I...? Would it be an appropriate method? This is not my forte either, as you well know, and as you said yourself, I need to say everything that I need to say."
“Git,”  John muttered, and then wiped a hand down his face. “Right, well, if  you’re open to suggestions, I’d say you won’t get the results you want  from
"No, don't pout," John chides, giving his arms a squeeze and then - regrettably - pulling away. "I don't know, honestly. I might still be riding the high of realizing you're alive, and come home again, especially now with you out of bed and all. But don't worry; I'm sure that as soon as you start leaving entrails all about the flat again I'll be right back to shouting at you for it."
.  And it makes me feel alive too, just being by your side. But I also  love watching you when you’re calm. When you’ve got your head laid down  in my lap and your top and bottom lashes meet ‘cause you’ve got your  eyes just barely open. When you’re sleeping next to me, not even  dreaming yet and every bit of you is still. Peaceful. I love that you  trust me so much. I love that I can make you feel safe.”
This answer satisfies Mycroft, though it hadn't done so with John. Sherlock had rebuffed all the eager executive's overtures, and had soon needed to issue an outright rejection, stating that he enjoyed John's company but that he declined the dubious honor of being John's first foray into romance sans ulterior motives. It would be doomed to fail, and what was more, he had absolutely refused to begin a relationship in which
Sherlock lets his curls run wild, an oddity among age mates who censure old fashioned notions of modesty, chastity, and prudence. Locks are cut short or plaited neatly to better show off the vines sprouting near hairlines whenever a new connection is formed. Unnatural tints are applied so leaves and tendrils show up better, and elaborate combs and hair sticks are arranged to support precious buds and blossoms. Sherlock will part his curls to reveal thready vines and leaves like bottle shards, if proving his humanity becomes necessary, but the tiny white stars are ruthlessly culled whenever he finds them.
Mycroft rather looks like John's suggested that the government functionary pop out of a cake whilst wearing a spangly sash that reads "Sherlock's alive!".
John sucks in a breath and sighs it out again, quick and shallow. It's hot against the hand that Sherlock stupidly still has pressed against the other man's lips, obviously impeding said man's ability to actually answer the question being put to him, but Sherlock is frozen solid, or stupid. And then John - clever John, adaptable John, master tactician Captain J. H. Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers - finds a way around the obstruction.
As I read through the file that Mycroft gave me, my feelings of betrayal changed to understanding and regret and gratitude. I still wish that you could have found a way to take me along so that I could have helped you, or that you'd at least read me into your plan so that I could have been spared some of the pain, but I understand your reasons for doing what you did. It is what it is, and I can accept it now.
"John? What's wrong?" Sherlock keeps to the same whisper being used, though the room seems devoid of danger.
"Of course you are dear, all children are," Mrs. Hudson says placidly, and this makes the executive sputter.
Sherlock is hunting and being hunted, and in all the world, John is his only bolthole. The dead man slips from one disguise to another, a harried university student in plain sight one day and a jaded sex worker lurking in shadows the next, living on caffeine and nicotine and quick bites that won't require too much bloodflow to digest, sometimes sleeping but never, ever resting. Not unless there is someone he trusts to watch over him.
“Gladly!” John snapped right back, and stomped both feet as he wrenched his way out the bedroom door, thundered up to his own room, and only stopped himself from kicking his bed in exasperation by recalling x-rays he’d seen of toes with multiple fractures.
“Oh, okay. Well, which home-made date rape drug did we just knock back? We’ll just drink the matching neutralizer right away. A difference in which one is ingested first shouldn’t…” He trails off as he catches sight of the uncomfortable wince.
Except he wakes up in hospital, and John only looks more and more confused, and alarmed, and afraid with each question Sherlock asks.
“John,  I–” Shaky, shaken, barely held together. John was unable bear to hear  Sherlock Fucking Holmes reduced to such wet-kitten vulnerability, and  him the proximate cause.
“Forget it! Look, what are the possible negative effects of drinking all of the neutralizers at once?”
With no words, he offers physical comfort instead, poor though it may be in comparison to the pain he wishes he could assuage.
They even have the blessing of a professional. John - shuffling, sheepish, scowling and stubborn - shows Sherlock a few texts from a "Marcus" in his phone as they peck away at a platter of sandwiches.
DVD Commentary: This chapter didn't exist at first, but then the author's notes for chapter 8 got so long and detailed that I ended up clipping them out and turning them into an epilogue of sorts. I actually like that I'm ending the story with John being unemployed, what with his job being unable to make him happy, but then being sacrificed to help Sherlock, and then basically being cast aside once it had served its purpose. It sort of rounds the story out, I think~
"What do you mean why?! I'm the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company; people are constantly throwing themselves in my path to kiss my arse, and here I am, looking around and hoping someone'll come and be my friend like some snotty year one just transferred in!"
In addition to the teams marching in and out of the ground floor, Mycroft has apparently authorized John to be in contact with a new therapist. What's even more surprising to Sherlock is the use John's made of this resource.
The pause stretches out so far as to be taken as an answer, and sturdy hands begin to press the cards back down and withdraw, spurring the body to action even if the mind is lacking in perfect resolve and readiness.
He cut off his retroactively embarrassing rambling and  glanced up, only to find that his frown had transferred itself to  Sherlock’s brow. But instead of scathing sarcasm at all this romantic  dribble, John merely got a shrug.
John returns almost immediately, but now his hands are busy with the bits of paper from the desk, tapping them into a neat stack, re-ordering this card and that, and giving Sherlock a rather shamefaced grin.
"Amazing." Sherlock blurted out the ending to his sentence and then shut his mouth so hastily that he nearly clipped the end of his tongue clean off.
John's gone from unburdening himself to burning himself at the stake, so Sherlock wants to draw this session to a close. Or at least to redirect all this blame to where it belongs. Gone is his comfortable sense of security, the hubris that accompanies unexpected happiness; he recalls what sent John stumbling into Mary's arms in the first place, and is suitably chastened.
“I don’t…what?” the blond asked plaintively, too worn down or worked up to put in the effort to translate Holmes into English.
“Anyone with tits and a heartbeat!” Sherlock sneered, and then shouldered rather rudely by on his way to his bedroom.
"My only boundary is your well being," John says, voice and gaze and hands steadier now. "I won't let you do drugs or run off again without me, but anything else, you can ask me. Never mind what you think my 'nature' is, all right?"
He settles for dipping his head to give John's shoulder a slow, soft nudge, like a cat nuzzling in for a bit of scent-marking.
"If you're not buried all the way in your Mind Palace, you fidget when you're thinking something through. You hum and twiddle your fingers and tap your feet and all sorts of things. You've been drumming on my ribs for a bit now."
Catching his breath is a bit of a struggle, but a pleasant one; the mental equivalent of a runner's high, perhaps. After such a period of inactivity his stamina is nil, but finding that he can still accomplish a quick deductive dash in fine form - and most importantly, put that admiring grin on John's face - is a joy.
Kisses are new and exciting, but hugs are rare enough and nothing to sneeze at either, so Sherlock settles into the embrace quite contentedly. John has him firmly about the shoulders with one hand carefully smoothing over the bandages hidden underneath layers of fabric. Sherlock is tired but wired, achy but blissful, mentally and emotionally overwhelmed. He lays his head on John's and idly watches a bedraggled 007 have a short-lived confrontation in an abandoned church.
(Any feedback or suggestions? How was the kiss, on a scale of zero to one hundred, and please explain your rating. What can I do better next time? There
Lucidity returns much more slowly than unconsciousness had overtaken him. Sleep, now that it has him at a disadvantage, seems to be taking every opportunity possible to drag him under and hold him down, and releases him with reluctance at times as if in complaint at not having had him for long enough yet. He's not entirely an unwilling hostage, at that. His body is heavy, as if his blood and bones have been replaced with buckshot and lead piping, and the signals his brain is receiving are soothing things like
I get solids?" he asks, honestly curious. His teeth feel loose in his jaw, and the broth is a bloom of warmth in his belly, reminding him that there are other creature comforts to be had. He's been rough on his transport these past few years (all his adult life, to be perfectly honest). Showing it a little gratitude and care for once might not come amiss.
“If you’re going to waste your attention on this mindless  show, you may as well engage your hands in something useful and pet my  hair.”
"Not very. This tea will keep me satisfied for now, and I'm more likely to need a nap than a snack afterwards. Reluctant as I am to admit it, that shower exhausted me."
"Thank you," John interrupts, in a tone that's expressing "shut up Sherlock" much more than actual gratitude. (He's missed even that.) "And no you're not. This is fine, Sherlock. More than."
DVD Commentary: Marcus Hughes is my omc from "A Doctor in the House". He's not really based on anyone; I just wanted to add another "MH" to the BBC Sherlock mix. XD
It was  heady, it was dizzying, it made John feel powerful,  humble, eternal, and small all at the same time, to have Sherlock so  focused on him. All of his being distilled down to this one want,  waiting for this gift that John wanted to bestow.
"Oh, er...ta," John replies, not sure what to make of this seeming non sequitur. He drops back onto the cushions and turns wide eyes over to Sherlock.
Sherlock is a changed man, and John is not the only friend who deserves better from him going forward.
John in a frumpy jumper and exasperated smile tended to put a tingly-fuzzy glow in Sherlock's chest. John in full evening dress and a scowl triggered an acute myocardial infarction. Or at least, there was something making Sherlock want to collapse. To his knees. Right in front of the inverted V of the white waistcoat, where dangled a gold Saint Luke medal at the end of a matching watch chain.
...bringing box after box after box into the living room. The smaller ones seem fairly light, but others are set down with significant thuds. The boxes are too numerous to be accounted for by a sudden need to spring clean, too heavy to contain only new linens or clothes, and too square and generic to be replacement laptops and what-not. After the last of the security team departs the first floor, Sherlock speaks up.
"Charming," Mycroft sighs. "I can see how you've managed to capture Mister Watson's gaze despite the glitterati littering his empire."
Here he stops, and sets down the pen. He rubs his hand, surprised to find that he's gone on somewhat of a sentimental spree toward the end, spending less time carefully composing and instead, letting the ink put form to the message as it welled up and out of his heart.
“Yes!” Sherlock nods eagerly, happy that John has thought ahead to the proper conclusions. “The alcohol industry will stop at
35. Spread honey on a piece of bread and toast it lightly, then spread butter and more honey on it and toast it a little bit more, then spread a little more butter and honey on the toast and toast it one last time, and then refrain from commenting on my A1C levels as I eat it
to let himself get so caught up in the idyllic isolation of Baker Street that he'd forget why he was confined to these quarters in the first place.
In BBC Sherlock, Mycroft and Molly would have been risking their safety, careers, and reputations to assist Sherlock, and so in this AU, John puts the same things on the line. And he's utterly devoted and faithful, too. The women John supposedly shags in back rooms and the men John supposedly pays to blow him in the back of his sedan are all Sherlock in disguise, using the cover of casual sex to interact with John without raising suspicion in anyone who might be watching, whether it's John's men or Moriarty's. He may be a bit immature when it comes to communicating emotions, but he is a soldier and a c-suite executive; he is the best of the best when it comes to keeping secrets, staying calm under fire, focusing on objectives to the exclusion of all else, and all the other things Sherlock needs in a partner for a deep cover long term operation.
The mundane is used to give junior agents something to cut their teeth on, and the important is used to give their seniors something to subtly brag about. When the crown wishes a task to be carried out quietly, there are tried and true teams to call upon, and when the government wishes to keep certain actions from the crown, there is a little black book to consult. And sometimes, when there can be no ripples after a deed is done - no payments shuffled about, no records expunged - Mycroft visits his little brother.
And so they fall into a new routine, unmarred by any (real) bickering, not soured by any (sustained) complaints of boredom. John moves into physical therapist mode, becomes a devout student of massage therapy and exercise routines specific to injury recovery, and playfully announces "enrichment time!" whenever he chivvies Sherlock out of bed or his seat to do careful laps around the flat or an hour of yoga in the living room. If Sherlock is feeling particularly unmotivated to move, the enrichment team is treated to a few growls or hisses, or perhaps a quick swipe of one paw.
"This is a restaurant," the psychologist continues, gesturing at his office. "You're a customer. I'm your server, and I'm happy to take your order and bring it to you. I can even recommend dishes for you, if you tell me what you're in the mood for. But I can't tell you what to order, and I'm definitely not going to cut your food for you or hand feed you."
He bonked his head once against the wood,  trying to find the right words to unlock the door, trying to find the  right salve for the injuries he’d so unforgivably inflicted.
He was, sadly, accosted in the doorway. John didn't seem to know what to do with Sherlock's elbow once he'd grabbed it, however, and the clothes-thief attempted to wiggle away.
He’d  nurtured - clung to - dreams of returning to their old life; their  domestic routines, their oddly compatible and complimentary ways.  Sherlock measuring trust in how wary John was of the cups of tea and  coffee he made, and John - based on the self-satisfied smiles -  measuring it by how many bites of food and hours of sleep he could  cajole Sherlock into. He’d banked on there being a blow-up upon his  return from the dead of course; something explosive and emotional but  also over quickly. Like a quick summer storm; fast and furious but also  refreshing when it was done with.
Sherlock nods, then listens and fidgets, more delighted than he thought possible at this very simple next step in his recovery. The offer of a proper wash seems like a door thrown open; just a few feet of space in and of itself but promising an entire world more. If he can get up - with assistance - and take a shower, that means no more round-the-clock bedrest. No more bedpans, no more getting rolled this way and that to avoid bedsores, no more being manipulated through endless repetitions of passive exercises and getting wiped down with as little interaction as if he was still unconscious.
The doors to the liquor cabinet - more like a liquor showcase, really - open while John messages the kitchen to provide nibbles, and Colin solemnly declares John "an archangel among men" when he's given permission to crack open the 50 year old Highland Park single malt. Half an hour later, upon seeing the indoor pool for the first time, Tom drops to one knee, presses his roast beef toastie to his heart, and proposes marriage.
Dr. Hughes, as always, does not have a quick, simple answer. But John is used to this by now, and moreover, can now admit that his psychologist's methods are effective. He strangles down his impatience as best he can and stays on the line, telling himself over and over that Sherlock isn't going to keel over from one more missed meal or nap while John sorts himself out.
“No...in  fact I don’t think that’s even in my top three, come to think of it.  Trust, admiration, and affection. Attraction would be important if I was  just looking to get off. But for intimacy? No, I need to feel  comfortable with a person.”
) in a tropical clime, only to have an afternoon stroll interrupted by a blizzard. The sun is blotted out, snow slaps and stings at his exposed skin, a shrieking wind blinds and deafens him, and he is left grasping frantically for something, anything that makes sense amidst this unexpected turn of events.
Sherlock eagerly dives in under John's fond gaze, unboxing his new phone and case. Both are a sleek, shiny black as suspected - John and his unconscious bias wouldn't have actually ordered Sherlock a hot pink phone - but the engraving on the case brings him to a halt.
.) "Thinking back to my reaction to that first cup of broth you gave me, I believe I'll proceed with caution. I've been daydreaming of a well-fried egg, in point of fact, with just a bit of salt sprinkled over the whites."
“We got into it right there with flutes of champagne still in our hands, and he’s giving as good as he gets only he looks like he’s having
Swabs, nitrile gloves, finger cots, and one lighted magnifier buried under all the other packets and boxes.
, Sherlock! You'd go see a doctor if you broke your leg; why shouldn't you see a therapist for your PTSD?"
work and methods are hardly worth mentioning, however. There's little of interest in his file, so I must admit to being at a loss as to why you'd allow him so close, either as a target or talent."
Sherlock gets a little tangled up attempting to puzzle out this facial expression, but then notices the good doctor shaking his finger at him. Ah, he’s being chastised. Sherlock is sad about this, and hangs his head.
Watson prefers Mozart to Brahms, and puffed rice crackers to yogurt melties. Scrapbooks start filling the bookcases.
Ever the proper host, John tips himself off the sofa and makes to walk him to the door, but he's waved off. Mycroft does pause in the doorway for a moment, turning to give them both a considering look.
“And when you’re well, we can talk about everything else…” John falters here, just for a moment, but only needs one deep breath to recover. “We can talk about what happened. The things you did to keep us safe. And everything else that we are to each other.”
"Am I now?" he asks, and pretends to fall upon Sherlock like a wild animal, all growls and nips, startling a laugh out of him that seems even louder for its unexpectedness. They tussle a bit, giggling and shushing each other, mindful of Mycroft's minions below them, and eventually sort the tangle of limbs and pillows and sheet-wrinkles out so that they're both comfortable.
The greater part of the conference ends up being anti-climactically simple and straightforward, as if even Mycroft has decided that careful civility will be his best approach while Captain Watson is on duty, and a quick escape his surest bet for continued good health.
Sherlock can only blink. He’s in no shape to argue. Probably couldn’t even get any of the words out. John adjusts a pillow and pulls the coverlet up higher, and then pins Sherlock to the bed with a glare.
This, right here, is an excellent example of the extraordinary kindness of John Watson. He likes to start his stories from the beginning, plod his way through the events in chronological order, and put the denoument at the end where it naturally belongs. But he spoils this tale by beginning at the end, to save his audience from any unnecessary anxiety.
"I still am, you know," John forges on. "Your friend, I mean. Thought it didn't need saying but maybe I should've done. I'm not...I'm not here just because you need a doctor. I'm..." A helpless shrug and sigh, and then,
"Sherlock," John replies patiently, some amusement even tugging at the corners of his mouth. "I've been keeping you all to myself for weeks now, and I haven't made a single attempt to let any of our friends know that you're alive. If I were them I'd knock me flat."
thrown at me for my ability to get tables - but that I was welcome to join him at a crime scene instead, if I promised not to ask too many stupid questions. Said my knowledge of firearms and corporate espionage might come in handy solving a murder. He consults with the police off the books, apparently.”
–and then you are going to pass back out. When you wake up, we’ll see if you can handle some broth, and then we’ll start your recovery in earnest. We can talk more after you’re stronger.”
That first night, after only giving a brief summary and the opening paragraph, John ends up falling asleep first, still wrapped up in and around Sherlock and hardly loosening his grip even as he slumbers. The next morning it's obvious that he's uncertain how to continue, but that the subject is never far from his mind. It's in the quick, cautious glances that turn into hesitant smiles or distracting kisses, and the flutter and clench of his left hand.
“Er...top three, or all I  can think of?” John asked, curiosity engaged as to what sort of case the  consulting detective was considering taking on.
"Little things," he continued, gaze drifting this way and  that as he reviewed memories. "A cuddle while watching telly or enjoying  a fire on a cold night. The moments where you give into the impulse to  reach over and hold hands for a second, or push away a bit of hair from  their face. Looking forward to a kiss hello or goodbye and being sure of  getting it. Or hell, a quick kiss for no reason at all. Just the  comfort of knowing you can,  y’know?"
They curl around each other, nosing and nudging into each other's curves and concavities, two puzzle pieces determined to lock together despite being mismatched. John takes his pulse and smells his hair and takes wet, tasting kisses from his neck, and Sherlock holds fast and lets him.
"The night I returned," he says, quiet and calm. A soft touch seems appropriate for the late hour and tender topic. "I found you at The Landmark. Table for two, you hadn't ordered yet, not even wine. A bottle blonde in a lavender silk gown, beadwork in a leaf pattern. Earrings to go with the dress, but a ring she wore every day. Easy, confident, not a first date by any means. But you were tense, nervous; this was a special occasion of which the outcome was uncertain, not a celebration. And you had a small jewelry box in the inner pocket of your coat."
The first step is for Mrs. Hudson to be recalled to Baker Street, of course. This merely requires an email to be sent, informing her that the rennovations at 221 are complete and that her travel arrangements are attached.
"Can't get this bloody thing tied, and I'm afraid it'll get wrinkly if I try too many times," John groused, flapping the bit of white fabric that was presumably his bow tie as he stomped across the floor. He stopped a few feet away from his flatmate and scowled even further at Sherlock's silent staring.
Sherlock finished his edits to the numbers in John's contact list and looked up. And then dropped the phone.
He's more than half-afraid that they'll soon fumble their way into an awkward dance of "are you sure" and "if you want" and similarly excruciating hesitations masquerading as courtesies, but John breaks the silence with a non-sequitur instead.
"Why didn't you say something?" John asks, attempting to smooth down the mess he's made. A futile endeavor.
"And on that note, good afternoon, gentlemen," Mycroft abruptly announces, gathering his brolly and briefcase and dignity about him as he stands.
Sherlock hurries, careful when he's not thinking and sloppy when he remembers that they're all dead now. He takes a cab to save his body from being jostled on the tube, and slips in through the kitchens of the Landmark to avoid any unpleasantries about his lack of reservation.
Sherlock disregards the warning entirely; he's too impatient for his reward. So many days and nights and injuries he's had to endure, and the terrible, terrible decisions he's had to make. Surely he's allowed this; just one moment and the hope of the hours to come, a chance to see John again, to hear his voice, watch the play of light over his skin and glinting in his eyes, to take new measurements of his laugh lines and stubble and the little divot on his finger where the pen presses hardest.
Sherlock wakes sometime before dawn and crawls out of bed, sleep-warm and soft. He melts onto the floor and slumps against his partner in crime, all mussed-up curls and bare skin impressed with sheet wrinkles, naked in every way and seemingly not yet conscious enough to be bothered by it. John turns his face into the scratchy tangle of bedhead and breathes deep. For one minute, no one is watching the door.
Happily, some of the prescribed therapies and soothing treatments are already well under way. They are together again, as close as they ever were before, and even closer now with all the intimacy of confessions and conversations and cuddles.
John does spend a great deal of time "working on his frown lines" in Dr. Hughes's office, but as it's a thoughtful, productive silence, the psychiatrist allows it.
“Here, let’s get you sat up a bit and I’ll get you some water. Your mouth’s probably all cotton and crust.” John is competent and calm, supporting him this way and that and tucking extra pillows behind his back (prickle of stitches, the dullness of thick dressings and the pull of adhesive tape, an unpleasant tightness and itching from wounds already closed and drying). John flicks the IV line, taps thoughtfully at the monitor, and then sits on the edge of the bed, leaning over to pick up a glass that’s sitting ready on the bedside table.
"After you jumped, I was heartbroken. And when you returned, after the first shock was over I felt betrayed. When I realized that you've been alive all along, I jumped to conclusions, and they couldn't have been more wrong. Although I'd have given anything for you not to have suffered so badly, in a way I'm glad you were so out of it at first. It spared you my initial reactions, and me the shame I would have felt later on, when I found out the truth.
John turns the list into a new project, getting the security team downstairs to procure him a recipe box for the archival of it. Sherlock's reply-to-a-reply-to-a-note is secured with an elastic band and given a place of honor at the front. After a moment of thought, Sherlock puts John's reply-to-a-note in there as well. They find a place for the box on a shelf in the (their?) bedroom, after some strategizing over where it is least likely to be blown up, accidentally knocked into a fire, shot, or splashed with chemicals.
Sherlock sits back with a sigh and surveys the messy sprawl of notecards with tired, slightly sweaty satisfaction. He hasn't moved from the couch but it was still exertion of a sort, and he's not exactly in top form. Take it all in all, his note feels more solid than not, however, especially given the fact that this is his first foray as an adult into uttermost honesty and emotional vulnerability. He's congratulating himself quite heartily on this bold essay into uncharted territory when the muted snap of a laptop being shut startles him out of his reverie.
of command - and obeyed, though it takes another split second to register that what John had said was,
"Here is fine. I want to stay just like this, and have you talk to me until I fall asleep. Probably very rudely, right in the middle of a sentence."
John winces at how rapidly this nothing situation has escalated into a potential MI5 action (because Sherlock has revealed what background checks could not, which is that Mycroft is the creepy shadow behind the throne) and texts back before Big Brother can put a kill order out on him. Seconds later, he's ringing his assistant and telling him to send 'round the car immediately, and have a big cheerful bouquet waiting in it, plus one of those fancy tea hampers from Fortnum & Mason. Sherlock may turn up his nose at gifts, but Mrs. Hudson will hopefully be open to bribery, provided it's blatant enough.
and loves him in every single terrible, specious, dull, and irrational way that he's ever scoffed at before.
Standing just outside the tub, John gets to work on every bit of Sherlock that can't be easily reached, which ends up being most of him. Even the short walk from bed to bath has taken its toll, and the exercises he's been participating in have kept him limber but not done anything toward regaining muscle tone. Sherlock finds that he can wash his arms, torso, groin, and upper thighs - with small breaks in which to rest - but that getting a foot up to scrub at will take too much exertion.
Though he’d seemed a bit taken aback to be confronted in his own room, Sherlock sprang back into triumphant offense at this.
John turns in his seat, craning his neck at the commotion near the kitchens. There hasn't been a crash or scuffle, but there's something in the sudden flurry of voices that's raised his hackles. Mary calls his name, but he ignores her for the moment, narrowing his eyes at the way the diners nearest the hallway are exclaiming and gesturing. The manager fast-walks over with a sort of angry elegance, but then startles and whirls around, nearly tripping over his own feet.
"Mycroft had me under guard, and I wasn't in a mood to leave your bedside for more than a trip to the loo in any case, so it was all over the phone," John continues. "I waited until she'd signed the NDA, too, which probably makes me even more of a bastard, but I wasn't willing to risk your safety for anything. I tried to make it quick, but it turned into a series of long, drawn-out calls where we just kept going in circles."
I have made spekkoek (aka lapis legit or thousand layer cake) a few times before, mainly for bragging rights. It is a marathon baking project that should only be attempted by people with strong backs. You take two bowls of batter (it's like 90% butter and egg and just a smidgen of sugar and flour to hold it together) and color one with tons of cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, and other spices. Then you take a brush and paint on one layer of plain batter thin enough to read a newspaper through and broil it for three minutes. Once it's baked, you butter it and paint on a layer of dark batter, then broil THAT for three minutes. Rinse and repeat for eternity, or until you have depleted your supply of batter or your will to live.
Sherlock  stood in the hallway, a cello-wrapped twelve pack of Sterlings in one  hand and a cautious, wide-eyed look framed by windblown curls.
He becomes aware of his legs again when they buckle, and remembers the caning when he fetches up clumsily against the wall. The pain of burst stitches gives him some clarity, and he manages to shake his head when a staffmember stops in concern, asking...asking something. It must be in English but for some reason Sherlock can't parse it. He slides inelegantly down to the floor and tries to deduce the reason for a sudden shriek. He thinks that's the sort of thing he used to be interested in.
Fade is a natural product of bloom, and it shouldn't hurt, except that Sherlock exerts such tight control over his affections that they rebel against him in their own way. The vines are thin and the foliage unobtrusive, but the roots run thick and deep and snarling. The more petals he rips away, the more his skull aches.
right now, so on auto-pilot he began steering them out of the kitchen  and over to the sofa, as if location had been the problem. As if sitting  instead of standing would fix everything. Could fix anything. Could  help at all.
“Sherlock,  can we talk? That is to say…can I apologize?” John asked through the  door. He gnawed on his lip a while, and when he still heard absolutely  nothing, began feeling sharp pinpricks of fear. What had he done? And  how badly had he done it?
"You don't have to use past tense," Sherlock finds himself saying, superiority making him magnanimous. "I understand that it's not something you can just shut off, like gas and electric."
It just reminded me of when I'd got back from Afghanistan; everything was miserable and hopeless and then suddenly there's this stranger looking into me and offering...I don't know. Life, I guess."
"Mm, no." Sherlock ponders topics while John pretends to be disappointed. He's not got much practice at this playfulness, and quickly gives up on formulating a funny suggestion. Asking himself what things he truly wishes to find out next about his John yields better - or at least more numerous - results.
“Sorry, sweetheart,” he murmured into silky-soft fabric. “You just caught me off guard, is all. I’m not unwilling.”
. He stares so long that John's discomfort turns to concern. And then he yelps as Sherlock suddenly comes back to life and begins raking his hands through his hair, nearly headbutting his concerned physician.
And with that fact acknowledged, the question that has been haunting Sherlock goes from a dread-soaked spectral shade to a mere lump of laundry to be ignored or attended to as the whim might take him, with no more importance either way.
Finally…a single nod, and then Sherlock’s face remained dropped low. Another tear pinged softly off the glass.
John laughs and calls him a git, and all Sherlock can do is try to keep this ridiculous amount of happiness in his chest from causing him to explode. It's the relief of recaptured joys, gratitude for homesickness being soothed, and pure and simple affection making the sight and sound of John laughing happily such a great treasure as to make the last two years worthwhile.
"Your father is dead, John. He no longer has the power to influence you. Stop wearing a hand puppet and punching yourself in the face with it."
bedroom now?) John grins down at him, fond and amused and perhaps a smidgen proud at this daring invitation.
, damn it, and I also know it  all means that you’ve got this…this…beyond-belief capacity to feel  things and out of all the people in the world I should have known better  than to ever even
Ah. He must have needed a moment in which to process, which he why he so rudely interrupted John by practically sticking his fingers into the man's mouth, like pacifying a fussing infant with a dummy. The time gained, however, is wasted. His brain has experienced a processing error and gone offline. Disconnected. Crashed. He's not even sure if he's feeling anything other than overwhelmed. All systems down.
Sherlock stared, then shut his mouth when he realized it had dropped open. (His transport was getting quite unruly.)
"It'll still be the two of us," John says, nothing of mockery or teasing in his tone. He gives Sherlock's shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "At the core, at least. Always you and me. You can get London and puzzle-solving and all of that back without giving up what we've already got here. So no matter what else happens, no matter what gets...I don't know, blown up or scraped away or lost, you'll always have this. I'll be with you, at your side and on it. You have my word."
John settles into the other end of the couch - the better to keep an eye on him, perhaps - dragging the afghan down with his free hand and flipping a corner over Sherlock's legs. The already well-wrapped patient draws breath to protest that he'll be roasted, but then John shakes out the rest of the blanket over his own knees. There's still plenty of space separating them, but somehow it strikes Sherlock as intimate, this sharing a blanket between them, and he lets the air out of his lungs in a cooling breath over his tea instead.
They're doctor and patient and nothing else for now, and it's both excruciatingly painful and a profound relief. Establishing such restrictive boundaries highlights everything they've lost (everything he sacrificed, hoping to save it) but also makes it very clear where the safe zones are between them. With everything they've not yet had a chance to say to each other, it's actually reassuring to live between buffers and bumpers and rules for once, unwary of triggering an accusation or acrimonious reproach.
Will it be here waiting for him when he returns? Or will it have faded, dimmed; something not quantifiable and yet unarguably real gone missing, once they were not present to sustain it? Perhaps it will even prove to have only been a way-stop along a linear path that he cannot double back on, a dance they cannot fall back into once they lose the rhythm.
The cost of such a two year mission as he's just completed and somehow managed to survive. It seems he's been set back to factory defaults, capable of only the minimum necessities of living.
"I'm not Dr. Dunaway. I'm not going to take your money forever just to watch you work on your frown lines."
"You've been dining intravenously, Sherlock, and living on God only knows what before that. I could've given you a stale communion wafer and your mouth would've watered."
," John insists, emphasizing this with clenched fists and piercing eye contact. "Physician, friend, bodyguard, assistant, cook; whatever you need, Sherlock."
"I thought you might have been waiting for our confinement to end before you persued certain levels of physical intimacy, so that you'd...have an escape route, so to speak, if you...well, if you found that you wanted one."
My apologies for the delay in getting this chapter up. I deleted and rewrote it so many times that at times I had to stop and re-read previous chapters to remind myself where I'd been going with all this. *headdesk*
Mrs. Hudson minds their daughter so they can indulge in gnocchi and wine. John takes his hand at Angelo's, kisses him in the park, and when he's got Sherlock pinned to the bed, whispers,
“Oh,”  Sherlock said, disappointed. “Right, of course, that would be…” Silly,  stupid, insufficient. He waved away the sting of rejection and then  pulled his shoulders back, determined to do what he could.
giving the oft-times self-destructive detective everything that he asked for. To shout and fight and storm because Sherlock was worth the effort and exertion and exhaustion.
There are parts of the list that John cannot do aught about until Mycroft releases them from lockdown and recalls Mrs. Hudson from her vacation, but Sherlock goes ahead and relays them anyway.
(Ah. Decisions made on the downslope of a two-year suicide mission by a malnourished torture victim riddled with infection and PTSD are, apparently, not the the most reliable.)
He feels in real danger of a myocardial infarction at the first four words (what's her name?), but the time frame John gives his lie (??) lets him breathe again.
Sherlock  sniffed haughtily and looked down at him for a moment before examining  the tear-away tab on the cellophane as if it was the most striking and  singular advancement in technology that the century had to offer.
Definitely not cleaning supplies. Sherlock sets his new phone down and follows John off the couch and toward the small hill of brown cardboard.
, Sherlock, and then you apparently decided that the best way to come back from the dead was to interrupt one of my dates as if you’d only been gone two hours. Not to mention you were held together with not much more than willpower and some manky catgut, and half out of your mind with a fever.”
An inquiring hum and a quirk of his eyebrows does just as well as a proper query, thankfully, and John hesitates before answering, carefully casual.
,  Sherlock fell straight down between one breath and the next, down to  his knees and with John’s palms catching at elbow and forearm, gentling  him the remainder of the way, bringing him to rest between John’s legs,  staring breathlessly up and repeating his request with beseeching gaze  because his voice had failed at the same time as his legs.
"I'll want your feedback on my teaching techniques," John teases, voice grown a bit rough. "I want to keep accurate notes, after all."
“What–  what–” John gasped, looking at the door as if currently missing facts  would be magically posted there and then looking back at his magically  appearing flatmate. “How–”
“Pub  nights are indeed of no interest to me. I have no objection to your  continuing to attend such things with Lestrade or Stamford. But perhaps  it has fallen within your observations that I will in fact deign to eat  dinner and watch a movie so long as it is in your company.”
"Does the list have orgasms on it?" John is grinning cheekily now and stroking a line down Sherlock's neck that leaves all sorts of delicious shivers in its wake.
Sherlock can imagine, and does, and feels his heart break all over again even at this simple description of the grief he'd plunged John into. He realizes he's crushing the man's fingers when he's given a jostling cuddle and firm kiss atop his head.
My brain is chockablock with Colin, Tom, and Dan all flirting outrageously with Sherlock while Greg laughs and John growls and gets all possessively handsy. I have zero regrets.
Sherlock winds down partly because he's just about done, and partly because he's gone a little hoarse.
Visual focus at this close range is impossible, of course, but can see well enough to notice when John slowly blinks his eyes open. His own are darting back and forth, he knows, especially keen when laugh lines deepen as John smiles. He can feel the man's lips thin and go taught against his own, and the warm puff of a suppressed laugh.
" Sherlock exclaims, drawing back and glancing down, as if one might have sprouted in the last minute. He tries to imagine various styles of upper lip hair and fails utterly at finding anything suitable.
Details whirl around him and Sherlock can actually hear the rustle-roar of them for once, like leaves tossed in the wind. His eyes take in the sight of John's hair and shoulders and suit and gestures and knees and tapping left shoe. There's a woman seated across from him but she's only a blur; all Sherlock can focus on is the ring box in John's jacket pocket, interior, right side.
“This  nature documentary.  We can switch to archaeology after this is over, of course. But we’ve  got about twenty minutes before the food arrives, and the kettle will  take a bit as well. I want to use this time to determine the optimal  positioning for our post-meal cuddling, and I’ll need some feedback on  my hair-petting technique as well.”
The fever was from a ragged knife wound that Sherlock hadn't been able to reach well enough to stitch. He'd closed it with duct tape and collapsed in John's hotel room a week later. About the only silver lining to that whole incident was that John vomiting all over himself when he'd peeled back the tape had really sold the influenza story he'd told his security detail, allowing him to hide away in his hotel room for a few days and tend to the dying detective.
“Oh, the usual,” John waves off. “Had him tracked down and looked into, then I invited him to dinner. He
His part is done, however, and project Pompilid finally, finally closed. Any actions that arise from the ashes will be for other agents, administrators, or allies to take care of. He signs and dates a last line, closes the folder over the pages, and slides it all across the coffee table to his brother with a sort of shaky relief. He's known that the mission was over, has been revelling and rejoicing and rolling around in it like a dog who's found something delightfully smelly, and yet he finds that he was missing this little bit of closure after all.
He hangs about Baker Street, helping Sherlock unpack and re-clutter the flat. Mrs. Hudson creaks her way upstairs at least once per day with some excess of baked goods of which John always forces Sherlock to eat a proper share. The blond also takes it upon himself to order meals in at appropriate times, as he cannot cook worth a damn and Sherlock refuses to even try. John can't easily forget the way the other man wolfed down food whenever they managed to meet up at hotels, and how it wasn't enough to keep him from wearing thin. Sherlock has always been on the slim side, but in the past year he's turned the corner of underfed and begun heading toward gaunt.
"She wasn't you, but it was just so much worse this time; I knew I wasn't going to run into you in the morgue. I suddenly felt like if I didn't take this opportunity to move on, I never would. I'd just drown."
Sarah's blossoms were few enough to begin with, and they're simply left behind on the pillow one morning. The spotty brunette's blooms disappear during a crowded Tube ride. The one with the nose doesn't last long enough for Sherlock to properly tally the pale peach flowers speckling John's hair. Jeanette brings forth a rather alarming array of blossoms in a darker hue than most, but when she leaves, not all of them fall.
Self-flagellation accomplishes nothing useful, so Sherlock only allows himself one remorseful grind of his teeth at his unthinking selfishness, and repeats his gentle prodding of last night over breakfast.
"I love, am in love with, and desire you as well," he blurts. "And 'kiss me' was number one on my list."
Now that he's awoken again, Sherlock wants to stay that way, but just as John predicted (ordered, yes Doctor, yes
John hums again, a delightfully soothing and contented sound that Sherlock can feel in his skull and fingertips and just to the left of his sternum.
He contents himself with merely getting a bit more comfortable, fluffing the pillows he's squashed into stiffness and doing some careful stretches. Once settled, he finds himself easily entertained with the glimpses he gets of the other man cooking. The peep of the electric kettle, clinks and clatters of sturdy china, and the tantalizing crackle-spit-hiss of an egg cracked into a hot pan; it's a soothing concerto of home comforts, with John the soloist humming away in the spotlight.
fine. More than, in fact. You’re my best friend and a literal  life-saver and just…I don’t know what I’d do without you, Sherlock.  Really. And thank you, by the way, for the offer. For worrying. For  wanting to help.” John swiped a hand down his face, sighing into his  palm.
John  cut himself off and retreated beneath his arm again with a frustrated  grumble-groan that sounded like “dust doodles and pee-pees”.
One of John's last acts as CEO is to order Greg Lestrade to personally pick him up from the airport after a last minute trip to Germany. The head of security waits at the gate with "WATSON" neatly printed on cardstock because appearances matter, and the fact that he and John know what the other looks like doesn't. When John walks out of the aerobridge knocking shoulders and laughing with Sherlock Holmes, Greg doesn't drop the sign, because he is a god damned professional, but it's a near thing. Once the soon to be ex-CEO slides into the back seat of the company car, however, Greg reaches in after him, punches the man on the shoulder, and declares that he's owed an explanation and some more Glenfiddich. He gets a rude gesture and a recommendation that he fuck off, but as his boss is still grinning, Greg is pretty sure he won't be fired.
The yoga, in particular, ensnares Sherlock in a complicated love/hate relationship. Something touted as soothing and meditative has no business turning out to be so arduous. He's always sweating profusely ten minutes into the session, and every pose that he wobbles and flails and falls out of only reminds him of how badly worn and weakened his body is.
"And you? The metaphor begins to break down a bit, but at the risk of flogging it to death, I believe
Sherlock breathes out, simultaneously discovering that he'd been holding his breath as well as holding himself in readiness for...something. But John's pottering away happily in the kitchen now, humming and clattering about and most importantly not pinning Sherlock in place with a fond, steady, seeking gaze. Released and relaxing, Sherlock sighs and sinks back into the cushions, and in similar fashion his mind drifts down through layers of memories newly made.
"Three months later and I've got a table booked at the Landmark and a ring in my coat pocket," John says, and the lopsided smiles have melted away now, leaving behind tight lines of remorse etched 'round his mouth. "She was the best thing to happen to me since I lost you. And it wasn't just gratitude; I did love her, at least as much as I could. I wanted to make her happy."
“Took them four days just to stabilize you, and then as soon as you’d gain any ground you’d piss it away with escape attempts while screaming in German or something. I sedated you just a hair shy of coma and later checked you out AMA to bring you home. Mycroft wanted to set you up in some private hospital but I just flipped him two and reminded him that he wasn’t your official next of kin anymore.”
It comes on him like a realization at a crime scene or while poring over a case file; the puzzle pieces suddenly
The silence resettles in the pocket of air between them. The lines of John's face have smoothed back out into a soft, sober wonder. Slightly sad, and Sherlock wonders if it's because he's remembering Sherlock's blood on the wall, or of someone else he's lost. He's not got enough data to be jealous, so he tells himself that the little prickle he feels is concern for John's sorrow.
I have been aware of your older brother's interest in Agent Halstead for months, being the hacker whom he ultimately hired to uncover her whereabouts as well as intelligence on whether she had been turned or merely compromised. I knew that overstepping the authority he'd granted to me would be followed by severe repercussions, so I made sure to gather what information I could on his probable next steps even before I arranged for Agent Halstead to be transferred, mis-labeled, lost, and eventually smuggled into my guest room. I expected the MI6 agents, but while I usually don't suffer from any false modesty, I hadn't realized that either I or Agent Halstead presented a great enough threat that Mycroft Holmes would bother sending in his little brother.
As if this little ritual serves to transfer somnolence from one man to another, Sherlock eventually stirs and stands and starts pulling his layers back on, and John lurches up and onto the mattress. He wraps himself in expensive sheets and watches Sherlock pick up his gun or knife or taser or shard of glass half-wrapped with packing tape. Sherlock pauses by the dresser, picking up a wad of cash and any other supplies he's requested.
At John's inquiring quirk of the eyebrows and expectant smile, Sherlock pats his midriff and lets out a satisfied sigh.
There's a red morocco leather case under the floorboards of Sherlock's bedroom in which he's put away his addictions; the tourniquet and syringe, an old mobile with his dealer's number in it. John is small, but he won't fit in it - at least not without a great deal of processing - which worries Sherlock a little. (The metaphor, not the murder.)
The toast is unbuttered and there's little enough salt on the egg resting atop it that Sherlock could probably count the crystals if he could be arsed to wait a minute, but the first bite is still a religious experience. Once he's sunk his teeth into it, he has to close his eyes and stop everything - even chewing - to let a wave of gratitude wash over him.
His appetite comes to life with a slavering roar, and during the first few bites he's actually plotting up ways to ransack the kitchen later for a tin of beans or a packet of crisps. He slows down after devouring the yolk, however, and the last two bites cost him some effort. Sherlock sets down his crumby plate with regretful relief, content for now and utterly disinterested in anything more to eat. Even his cup of tea looks too heavy and far away to bother with, and he lets it remain on the tray.
Thank you to everyone for your patience, and especially to everyone who sent me kind words of encouragement as I struggled with this chapter. I re-read and re-arranged and re-wrote this chapter so often that I've lost all objectivity toward it (if indeed, I ever had any to begin with when it comes to my own writing) and have no idea whether it's better or worse than before. But it is finished, at least, and I'm going to call that a win. Thank you again for sticking with me.
"I'd gone back to work and at some point Mary'd been hired on as a nurse," John continues. "I honestly don't know when. And I must've spoken to her here and there, you know, good morning and thank you and what not, because when I finally lifted my head back up and looked around, there she was, smiling at me like she'd been waiting for me to get a joke.
. Having stripped off his top, Sherlock is quite naked now. The bedding keeps his legs warm and he's got vests and lap blankets for his upper body. With no visitors except for one man, and that one needing frequent access to all the damaged bits of him, pyjama bottoms and pants have been a needless luxury and a nuisance more than anything. And if he sometimes wishes to cover up a bit more, for even the illusion of privacy and dignity, well, he's gotten out of the habit of asking for things and expecting that he'll get them.
When he shuts the doors to his Mind Palace and opens his eyes, it's with an unexpected weariness, as if the work he'd done had made use of his muscles as well as his memory. He's actually tempted to let his eyelids slip shut again so that he can resume napping, but John is sitting by the bed, forearms resting on his knees, hands clasped, and steely blue eyes fixed on Sherlock's face.
"I need to tell you something," John murmurs, and he closes his eyes and leans forward, knocking his forehead into Sherlock's.
This admission puts John in much the same state, and Sherlock regrets the loss of eye contact as the other man coughs and rubs at his neck, as if it's a muscle twinge that's bothering him instead of embarrassment. It's more a reflex than a retreat, however, and soon enough John's gaze is fixed on him again, steady and sure. The brave soldier.
“I crawled out the window three seconds  after I locked myself in,” Sherlock explained. “Have you been talking  to my door this whole time?”
"No, take them." Sherlock thrusts the little stack of cardstock into John's hands, pushy and insistent. "They're ready, even if I'm not, and I'm already taking the coward's way out by having you read them instead of--"
John has to rush upstairs to grab a pair of shoes, because while most of his clothes have migrated into their shared bedroom, he hasn't had occasion for outdoors wear in some time. After he thunders back down the stairs, Sherlock sends him back upstairs with a laugh because he's forgotten a jacket, and then goes back to digging through cardboard boxes for a pair of trainers. The Belstaff is bypassed with some regret; it's comfortable and comforting, but all too familiar. He shrugs himself into a hooded windcheater instead, and then scoops up two scarves before heading back down the hallway.
"Anything would be an improvement over your usual attire," Sherlock snarked. The lack of any actual sass was deafening, and he could see it in the way John's mouth twitched.
Discussing the details of how Sherlock is to be publicly resurrected is where the discussion threatens to assume a distinctly pear-like shape. The basic strategy that Mycroft introduces is received well enough; private conversations with their chosen inner circle first, either all at once or in quick succession to avoid whispers and leaks, and then a press conference to alert the rest of the world. Once that is accomplished, the two men may freely venture out as they wish.
The consulting detective learns to stop himself at the initial observation and the theory (read: the instinctive emotional reaction born of uncertainty and deeply rooted self-confidence issues) that his mind comes up with, and - humbly acknowledging his own shortcomings - consult the subject matter expert.
It's like a reverse imprinting; he's apparently been categorized as an abandoned chick in need of warmth and feeding, and nothing manages to dissuade the woman from settling over him like a broody hen. She clucks over the messes Sherlock makes and throws her hands up at John for wearing such nice clothes within the blast radius of the oft-times explosive and/or corrosive experiments being run in the kitchen. Chocolate digestives begin sharing space with gooey cakes on the tea tray after she discovers that John's not got as sweet a tooth as Sherlock. And whenever said tenant runs off without telling John where or when or why, she brews tea and settles in with the abandoned CEO to see if the distractible detective will return before the pot is empty.
"My clever detective," John says, and uses the scarf to pull Sherlock in for a quick kiss before heading out onto the landing and down the stairs to the ground floor. Sherlock is close behind him, fondly looking at wallpaper and railings and a creaky armchair he hasn't seen in years, except in dreams. There's an agent posted at the front who gives them a brief nod before disappearing into 221A.
"Why are you so calm and collected?" he complains, then lets his face crinkle up into a moue as John only chuckles at him. It was a serious question; the man's serenity strikes him as nearly preternatural.
It seems a momentous question, and Sherlock's sat up and wide-eyed and holding his breath, but John only quirks one eyebrow at him.
He'd pegged John as starved for touch and honest affection from the very first, and needing to be shocked awake with a bit of excitement and adventure. Having been in a pique from growing bored of needling the Met, Sherlock had latched onto John Watson as an interesting new specimen to examine. He hadn't looked forward to much more than another evening successfully spent sober.
John's free hand comes up to pat Sherlock's, then adjusts the placement of their hands slightly so that they're directly over his heart. Pretense, apparently, is unnecessary.
John frowned  at the book he was no longer reading as he parsed the question a few  times over. And then he looked up and frowned at Sherlock, who was  curled up in his chair and nonchalantly thumbing through his phone as he  waited for John to concoct an answer.
His desperation for a proper washing-up has calmed but not abated, and it helps to have that to focus on as John steadies him, slips an arm around his bare waist, presses up against him from shoulder to hip to knee, manacles a wrist in his own warm hand, and insists on a slow, steady pace that allows them the maximum margin of safety as Sherlock makes his way to the tub. He's really not so weak and wobbly as to make all this caution necessary, but John is in no mood to take chances, it seems, and Sherlock doesn't dare to protest lest he be turned around and sent back to bed instead.
I had your official file and your unofficial one, and I'd pieced together even more from Google. But with all this, you still got past my defenses, and tricked Agent Halstead into breaking cover. Even after realizing that we'd revealed our vulnerabilities, I found it hard to re-categorize my darling new friend Shezza as a threat to our safety and freedom, possibly our lives. On the other hand, I'm a hacker. Destroying what I have to in order to protect what I need to is nothing new. I pride myself on being pragmatic.
He propped his chin on  one hand and wondered how long he’d have to wait before it would be  excusable to slip some ice cubes past Sherlock’s collar, then frowned  and straightened up as Sherlock…welled up and overflowed. It wasn’t  anything as energetic as crying; there were no sobs, no hiccups, no wild  gestures. But huge tears tumbled one after the other over Sherlock’s  cheeks, racing down his face and blobbing off his chin, fast as rain.
What  few brain cells were still functional made an effort and rallied  together to scrounge through the mind palace for whatever they could  find of Best Man Duties, focusing on tasks that could be accomplished  with enough time and money and effort. Those were assets that he was  certain of. He wasn’t ready to calculate whether or not he would have  the heart to go through with it all.
"Not...ready," Sherlock strangles out, opting for a hasty half-truth served with a side of misdirection. Even this little dishonesty sits uncomfortably in his chest, however. The habit of simple honesty has had time enough to sink in, and on top of this, John's wondrous, precious, miraculous note seems to lie heavy on his lap now, judging him severely for repaying the gift with such a craven spirit.
This is...this is intolerable, that John Watson should have ever felt this way even once, that Sherlock had perhaps had a hand in making him feel small or unworthy. He wants to destroy everyone who ever dared to sneer down their noses at this man and also abase himself at John's feet to offer worship.
He returns to 221B with takeaway, an apology, and a request to be allowed back in, and stays stubbornly on the sidewalk like some overcautious vampire until Mrs. Hudson manages to henpeck her tenant downstairs. Sherlock accepts the boxes of food and leaves the door open as he swans back to the first floor. When John cautiously follows, he's given a choice of beer or tea, and rather ungraciously told to text Sherlock Dr. Hughes's number if he must. An olive branch is still an olive branch even if it's missing some leaves from being thrown in one's face, and John is smart enough to be satisfied with the peace offering, such as it is.
Later that night, he drinks a light dinner and lays himself out on a couch because his bed is too empty and cold, and hopes Dr. Hughes is good at his job.
“I am anything but fine in this situation,”  Sherlock replied with some scorn, but was interrupted before he could  get into any explanation or exposition.
"I meant physically," John continues, with one hand spidering down Sherlock's ribs, sneaking under his shirt, and tracing some very distracting circles on the bare skin underneath. "You almost threw me off a couple of times, there."
According to John, Mary is a capable, no-nonsense nurse, organized and efficient, and the best in the office at handling difficult patients. John praises her cleverness and chuckles over the way she can chivvy people around like a trained sheepdog while still making them think they're being petted and coddled. Sherlock listens, chin propped while the remnants of egg and toast cool and congeal on his plate, and tries to hear what's not being said as well.
Sherlock Holmes may pride himself on never making guesses when it comes to the Work, but in emotional matters, he's far lazier. (Uncertain, unpracticed, and afraid.) And so naturally, he ends up making a rookie mistake;  gathering unfamiliar data, assuming he understands what it means, and then theorizing before the data set is anywhere near complete. He fills in knowledge gaps with deductive reasoning, and that might work if he were trying to posit a theory that could be applied to a generic cross-section of Londoners. But when trying to figure out one particular John H. Watson and how the man relates to one W. Sherlock S. Holmes, it's a modus operandi that's very much doomed to failure.
The front door opens on a fixed schedule in the morning and at night, with a pattern of comings and going throughout the day meant to seem random. Based on footfalls, there are three, possibly four rotating teams of four agents each occupying 221A and C. Mycroft must have sent Mrs. Hudson away on some pretense; if she was aware of my return, no force on earth or pain of hip could have kept her from marching up here to scold me and make a fuss. In fact, other than you and Mycroft, the only people who know of my return are some Landmark staff and NHS workers who've no doubt been forced to sign draconian non-disclosure agreements. Well, and the agents installed downstairs.
...and he’d just made a bet with his flatmate that he could make it through six months of an exclusive, committed, romantic relationship with him without a single incident of wandering eyes or heart.
Sherlock shrugs and nibbles stubbornly at another biscuit even though his pleasure in them has waned. The Holmes brothers do not speak of emotional matters, only cerebral, and this conversation is edging close to uncomfortable territories.
Sherlock nods. Wonders what the protocol is for asking for another kiss. Is it like a formal meal, where you subtly signal a desire for seconds by clearing your plate instead of leaving one bite behind? Or is it more along the lines of supper parties, where the families take turns extending invitations?
He deliberately does not tell anyone that the new man on the team is a Fortune Global 500 member, because the whole point of this exercise is to see if John Watson can become a real boy if treated like one.
Sherlock has insulted John in almost every way possible. Lineage, career, achievements, stature...nothing is sacred. But John still stays, and John still blooms for him.
I deal in facts and figures, codes and calculations. I can be cut off and chased until I have no choice but to go to ground. Agent Halstead is magnificent with her guns and grenades, her strategies and sweet talk, but as has been proven, is not invulnerable. Mycroft Holmes was the first to understand that together, we would become more than the sum of our parts. Agent Halstead is a beast. I am a cryptid. Together, we can become legend.
"Ah, one of those," John nods, still smiling but visibly settling in for a serious, solemn talk. This is not the first time Sherlock's emotionally tangental thoughts have been put to collaborative peer review.
"She was making a joke about celebrating 'satisfactory first quarter results' or something like that and checking out restaurants online, thank God," John recalls. "I'm just stood there trying to get my mouth to close. I knew we were dating, but not...I just hadn't thought about it at all, I guess. It woke me up a bit, I think. Shamed me into trying harder to pick myself back up and really move on, not just put myself into her hands and let her do all the work."
with that disinhibition is still undecided. It could be anything from tearing off John's shirt and marking him with a bite, to blurting out a proposal of marriage and matching tattoos. Whatever it ends up being, he's sure it'll be mortifying.
“Oh,  fine.” Sherlock adopted a facetiously earnest expression, doe eyes and  all, with his hands clasped under his chin and bony elbows propped onto  his knees. “I want a proper kiss, so I can feel like a real boy.”
John clears his throat, straightens up a bit, sniffs, scratches at his eye, and does all the things that a British man does when trying to play off strong emotion as merely a touch of hay fever. Across the sofa, Sherlock is nearly crawling out of his own skin, bursting with questions, unable to trust his own voice to ask any of them, and terrified of what the answers might be.
John, bless him, understands all this disjointed babble, and Sherlock is soon equipped with a pen, some blank index cards, and the Royal Horticultural Society's A to Z Encyclopedia of Garden Plants to use as an impromptu writing desk. But writing with John
“Not anything,” Sherlock muttered, frowning and looking away now, fiddling with the cigarettes in his hand.
"Did I get anything wrong?" he asks, trying to hustle the moment along and get back to the main question.
Step two involves John being snuck out of Baker Street, disguised as part of the security team, so that he can 'return' from Scotland and pay a visit to Mrs. Hudson, and thus be officially established at Baker Street.
ever since we met, and maybe you know and maybe you don't. Maybe you don't even care; I don't know, but I want to be done with it."
It's not the dreaded, dizzying, terrifying moment he'd once feared it would be. He trusts his knowledge of John - his observations and the reasonings built upon them, all the evidence and yes, now, his
The serious part of the meeting seems to be over, and the conversation continues in this vein; John and Sherlock indulging in silliness while Mycroft acts the part of dour chaperone, subtly egging them on. The quick spikes of anger and offense from a few minutes before make the descent into childish antics all the sweeter, and Sherlock finds himself giggling freely, uncaring of any mental movies his older brother may be recording. Though despite the shenanigans, they do in fact manage to come up with a workable plan for revealing Sherlock's resurrection to their chosen few.
Sherlock hummed contemplatively and  John thumbed through his book, trying to pick up the dropped thread of  the plot until interrupted by another question.
John is looking over his shoulder, teetering like he's about to fall forward again and continue on his quest for a quick supper. But at this simple expression of gratitude he turns back and smiles, then makes aborted little movements like he wants to both go and cook dinner but also return to the couch, and keeps making up his mind differently every half-second.
“I  want to help you,” Sherlock explained, trying to break his thoughts  into bite-sized pieces. “Who can I be - what sort of company do you need  - to make things better? You don’t need a consulting detective or rogue  scientist just now; you don’t need
the reasons? Er…Jesus this sounds stupid but…basically I’m asking if you’re in love with me. Um. At all.”
“Mycroft showed up just as you were wheeled into surgery. He gave me a file and power of attorney over you. I gave him a black eye.”
It's the rough, tremulous tone of the voice more than anything else that has Sherlock actively fighting his way out of somnolence. He rouses with a quick inhale and glances around the room, but nothing seems out of place. The remains of dinner are drying out on the table and the telly is still on, explosions rocking the scene but the volume down low. None of Mycroft's babysitter-bodyguards are present. John is still on the couch, not half out of his seat with his gun in one hand. (
"Oh spare me the ardent flames of your new religion, John. I've no need of your precious Dr. Hughes or any of his ilk."
John snorts and then gives the older man an impatient jerk of the chin, wanting him to get on with the update.
Two years of Sherlock's life have been condensed into a sheaf of papers, neatly tucked away in an official looking folder that the older Holmes produces from a spotless briefcase. The list of objectives that one brother has achieved and that the other has recently had confirmed is neatly laid out in bulleted lists, and Sherlock pens his initials next to each task. There are sub-bullets in the form of checkboxes under each organization, place, or person's name, and he leaves tick marks where appropriate.
He hadn't ever thought that it would be some cutting remark made to the woman that would make the array of sunset-hued flowers curl shut and begin drooping.
"Hold on a mo'," he says hastily, and heaves himself off the couch, to Sherlock's chagrin. He curls his fingers tight atop the blanket, the almost-touch prickling along the backs of his hands.
“I  wasn’t offering tea or jam,” Sherlock clarified. “Though if you’d  wished it I would have conjured some up. I suppose I should have said…
“Because of course people wouldn’t be able to simply quaff a full dose of each neutralizer all at onceJohn
He is much better now at communicating his wishes in clear and simple words. John seems to take great delight in fulfilling these wishes, which helps, of course. Apparently all Sherlock needed was the proper motivation.
John rolls away, lies on his back facing straight up to the ceiling, but he also tugs Sherlock along with him and tucks the detective neatly into his shoulder. Settling in for a talk, then, and not any sort of avoidance technique. Sherlock wriggles closer and throws a leg over two delightfully sturdy thighs for comfort, and places one hand with artful casualness over John's chest, half for affection's sake and half for data gathering.
"I admire your dedication to scientific accuracy," Sherlock murmurs, delighting in the playfulness and certainty of being loved that keeps this banter from becoming anything like torment. "Ninety-eight, too. Frottage. Against the wall. Specifically me against the wall, and you all over me. And then we did a bit of one-eleven and one-twelve, which was more of the same only in different positions, and concluded with one-fourteen, which was the one where I asked if we could take turns bringing each other off with our hands."
