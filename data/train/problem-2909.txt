It started off normally. Jack took a huge piece, and two slices of garlic toast. Sam took a bit less. He liked lasagna, but it was a lot of carbs and cheese for someone who took so much care with his health. Cas took a very small slice, to be nice, as usual, and a piece of toast. He started by picking the toast apart, eating the outside and leaving the soft inside bread. But halfway through, he stopped being fastidious and took an actual bite of the toast. “This is very good, Dean,” he said, his mouth full.
“Yes, thanks,” Cas replied, and grabbed another slice. He hesitated, then grabbed the last one as well. He ate them both quickly, in three big bites, then leaned his elbow on the table and began licking his fingers, his eyes half shut. Dean couldn’t stop watching him, although he wasn’t laughing. Instead, he was just fascinated.
What the fuck? What a couple of assholes they were. They fought monsters, they fought demons and the devil himself. They were both willing to die - had in fact actually died - for the people they cared about. But when it came time to say some words, like “I like you” or “I would like to stay in the vicinity of you” or “I want to fucking kiss you on the mouth” suddenly it was some kind of insurmountable obstacle.

The tablet is free and Dean is struggling trying to keep Cas from killing him, Cas is trying to keep himself from killing Dean, he doesn’t want to, but he isn’t in control. His body isn’t his own for the first time since he was resurrected without Jimmy. He’s Heaven’s vessel, he understands for the first time with complete clarity why Jimmy didn’t want to say “yes” again. He understands that being the body Heaven acts through isn’t as wonderful as they had made it sound. His body doesn’t belong to him and it’s going to be used to kill Dean.
She was glad that Dean gave the blade to Cas after he took care of Cain, but she was still worried about him and what could happen so when Sam got Rowena and Charlie working on decoding the Book of the Damned she wanted in. She wanted her dad back and unburdened by the first curse. She managed to help buffer between Charlie and Rowena and keep Rowena from annoying Charlie into leaving, and they got it figured out. Breaking the curse was hard, and she didn’t envy Rowena’s sacrifice to do it. Hearing that it worked was music to her ears, she was so happy that she hugged Rowena and removed her chains before heading out with Charlie and Cas to get back to the bunker to see Sam and Dean when they got back.
“Aww. Now that’s just mean. But this wasn't my idea. It was Crowley's. And it's just another reason I want to stab him in the face.”
Most of the dreams about hunts gone and people not saved would be bad but wouldn’t hurt like the others did. Experiences she’d lived through were less awful than some of her other nightmares with one exception. Her father staring her down with black eyes and chasing her was horrifying. Seeing him as a demon had shaken her to her core, it made her question her ability to be good, and had made her feel unsafe in her home. Her dad tried to kill her because he’d been twisted so badly by the mark, she knew it wasn’t really him but that didn’t make the experience any better. There were hallways she still power-walked through if she had to go down them. She couldn’t stop the thought of being trapped and running from her dad, someone she’d always felt safe around even from their first meeting despite his gun, and the sheer terror she’d felt that day was something she never wanted to feel again. Seeing him like that made her realize that no matter what they all had evil in their souls deep down and it could be twisted and brought to the surface. She dreamt not only of running endlessly from her demonic dad through the bunker but also of herself with black eyes and hurting people. She knew she could never become a demon herself but her brain would twist her deepest fears into something it could easily show to her in her sleep and make her realize just how easily she could become a real monster, to become something that deserved to be killed. Those kinds of dreams would leave her shaken and she’d wake up gasping. Those were usually the days she’d pull in, not leave her room unless she had to, she’d spend the day with only her fairy lights on because the idea of having to see her reflection in detail was not going to happen. She’d often just curl up in the chair she had in her room and pile on blankets trying to ground herself. She was glad that both Sam and Dean understood wanting to be alone on really bad days and that they wouldn’t push her to come out after she told them she wanted to be alone, they’d just make sure to knock and leave a plate outside her door with food when they’d make themselves something so she wouldn’t go hungry.
“I don’t know Ems, but I need a shower before we even think about going elsewhere. Let's find a motel and regroup,” Dean answered as he tossed his shovel into the trunk.

She could tell that part of him leaving was him trying to protect her from himself, which meant that he was still her dad under all of it. And she managed to figure out Crowley was with him fairly early on, and she could needle him into giving her at least basic answers on how Dean was. But she wanted her dad back, and she wanted him human again.
Before she could respond and ask what the Men of Letters were or what kinds of powers she had, Sam and Dean came back to the table. They got up to date with what Henry knew about Abaddon and were as confused about what the Men of Letters were as Emma had been. He convinced them to drive four hours to what was now a comic book shop to try and show them what they were apparently legacies to only to find that the old chapter house was completely gone. A bit of googling sent them further out on their chase to a cemetery in search of the grave of Albert Magnus.
“It’s nice to see you as well,” he didn’t seem to meet her gaze, looking away and towards the demon as soon as she came into view.
As Dean blinked, getting accustomed to the lack of blood and swelling in his face Cas gave a feeble “I’m sorry,” and flew away, unable to handle the fact that he had hurt Dean the way he had. Unable to voice his feelings, only able to hold onto the need to protect the tablet and took solace in his ability to treat that as a mission and focus on that and not what he’d done or what Dean had said. He had only said it to keep Cas from killing him and Cas knew that, but it didn’t explain why it hurt so badly.
When she told him flat out she was sent to kill him he could have sworn the floor dropped about a foot below his feet. It was one thing to figure it out and another to hear it. The world seemed to buzz around him and echoed in his head were his father’s last words that he had to “save him, nothing else matters, if you can’t then you’ll have to kill him.” How was he in this position again? Why did the universe put him in a position to potentially have to kill his kids over and over. How does it keep happening? As he got control over his internal panic he decided that he was gonna save her like he saved Sam and that was all there was to it. There’s no way he could kill his kid, so he has to do his damndest to save her or die trying. Pulling out his gun was muscle memory and not a conscious decision after she pulled her blade to try and kill him.
“Apparently so, though that feels strange. John was only four the last time I saw him, it’s odd to think so much time has gone by, that he has a granddaughter your age.”
The second Dean opened the door he knew it was his daughter on the other side. He could see both himself and Lydia in her as soon as he laid eyes on her. Knowing it was her didn’t change the fact that it seemed odd how old she was already, he’d seen how big she was a day or so ago but seeing her all grown up still hurt somehow. He didn’t really know if she’d want to be around him much but he felt like he’d completely missed out on her childhood. Looking at her and seeing how vulnerable and like him, she looked it solidified that he couldn’t hurt her even if she tried to hurt him.
Dean was worried about Sam and the trials, and had trouble letting Emma out of his sight for too long. Wrapping her body up was something he’d never be able to forget, and he was right about the nightmares. Emma could tell why he was bothered and just kept trying to come up with small stuff they could do together to try and help and to convince him she was okay and was going to stay that way. She took it upon herself to invite Charlie over to try and help by giving Dean someone he could talk to that would be able to read him and pull the truth out and let him be vulnerable when he wouldn’t let himself. That helped a bit, but only time would let him process what he’d had to do in that alley and the fact that Emma had gone to Purgatory, that he’d sent her there after witnessing the horrors there himself. Charlie ended up sticking around the bunker for a bit after saying goodbye to her mother, which was good for both her and the Winchesters.
Crowley had shown up wanting the tablet right as it came free of the stone, he was barred from the building by the sigils they had placed and threw a few verbal barbs at both Sam and Meg before pulling out an angel blade. Meg told Sam and Emma to go get Cas and Dean, but Emma was a Winchester, stubbornness was in their blood. She pulled her own blade and stood with Meg. The two fought side by side and made for a hell of a team. Meg was using her powers, as diminished as they were from a year of captivity and torture, to get Crowley’s attention and Emma was swooping in to land blows that utilized her increased strength. She never got a chance to land a deadly blow but got some cuts in and they managed to get a decent hit to his shoulder with Meg’s blade right as Sam and Dean came tearing out of the warehouse. Crowley was just distracted enough by it that they had a chance to get away from him and into the Impala to make their escape and head back to the bunker.
The Born Again Identity. Boy howdy, Emma gets to meet Cas and Meg yay, only Cas isn't aware he's Cas for like 90% of it, Dean is trying his best to keep Meg away from her because he doesn't trust her still, and she's obviously making Dean got Busy jokes because she's Meg and she's a demon, it's her brand.
A single tear made its way down his cheek as he tried to find some way to convince her there was another way when he couldn’t come up with one. Could he do this, could he kill his daughter to let her save her uncle? Would he be able to live with it even if she came back safely, could he outrun the nightmares he was sure to have of her dying at his hand? He already had nightmares of her dying, of him killing her that first night, of her dying on any number of hunts. Could he add another knowing that this one would be real, that he couldn’t just check her room at night when he woke up to reassure himself she’s okay when her being alive wouldn’t mean this didn’t happen.
His gaze flicked towards the wrist she’d flashed him earlier to gain his sympathy, she could practically smell her own burnt flesh again as he looked. She looked at him again and set her blade down. “Okay,” she took a deep breath, “okay so what do we do now?”
“Aren’t you a little short to be a stormtrooper?” Meg quipped facing Dean, and then turned her gaze to Emma and held her bound hands up “hey squirt, wanna help a girl out?”
Emma finally interjected, knowing they weren't actually getting anywhere and that direct accusations from a neutral party could help. "You gave Lucifer the mark when you guys sealed up your sister right? Didn't you have some understanding of what that would do? Isn't it your fault he's like this? I mean I read the books, when he was facing Michael in Stull he did say something about you wanting an adversary, was he right about all that?"
By the time they got to asking him why he was asking for John and let slip they were related, Abaddon was coming through the portal and flinging them against the wall to get to Henry. Stabbing her with the demon blade got her attention and annoyance but gave them just enough time to get to the car and drive off. Sam let Emma have the front seat rather than let her sit next to a man they knew nothing about other than he was asking for John, and well, considering John’s track record with other hunters there was a good chance he probably wasn’t terribly fond of him.
Having her family there helps, and having them be happy with her as she is is great but sometimes it’s just hard knowing how different she is from everyone else. She definitely ends up calling Garth later and talks for like an hour with him and he helps a lot
With some time it gets a little easier to see Emma, to see her inhuman granddaughter who looks almost her age. It took some short visits, hunts together as a family before she could see that they both fit into the family. What really made her starts to accept her and that her existence didn't mean her boys had fully grown beyond her was after a fight of all things. She could see herself in her, their fighting styles were similar, Emma wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty either, to go in with a blade instead of a gun and dominate. She was a Campbell as much as a Winchester and she was proud to be related to her.
Of course, once they dug up the grave- without any help from Henry at that- it turned out that the stiff in the grave didn’t match the headstone and they were stuck going off to find someone living under that identity.
Benny got there as quickly as he could and it was hard to ask him to do it, but they did and Emma could see on his face that he wasn’t sure if he would come back. She made him promise her he’d come back, that he’d come back to them because otherwise she’d go in after him. Her determination in that statement gave him a bit of a chuckle, he hugged them both and Dean cut off his head. Both Dean and Emma felt their hearts drop into their stomachs as Benny’s head fell from his shoulders but they knew they could bring him back, that Sam would bring him back. They carefully put his body in the trunk and climbed into the car to make their trip to Maine to wait for them when they came out of the portal.
After a little bit Dean realized that other than the few small interactions she’d had with him as a ghost Emma really didn’t know much about Bobby so he started telling her some stories of weeks they’d spent with him over the years. Some simple things like working on cars, or Bobby teaching him how to make his first meatloaf, and others were the things like how he was the first person he went to after coming back from Hell, that he was the first person to treat him kindly in forty long years. He hated thinking about how much time Bobby had now spent in Hell, he just hoped he was stronger than he had been and hadn’t broken so easily. He knew Bobby would smack him and call him an idjit for thinking he’d broken easily when he’d lasted as many decades as he had but he still hated the fact that he’d broken at all and couldn’t stand the thought of Bobby doing what he had. He had to believe that Bobby was better and somehow avoided the worst of Hell because they didn’t need him to break as quickly and that there was hope that he’d never been in the positions Dean had.

Sam and Dean were looking at the model in the basement that the demons had built up to try and find the crypt while Meg, Cas, and Emma were upstairs. In the living room Meg was drinking and Cas was bandaging her up while Emma was searching some of the bedrooms to see if she could find Meg appropriate clothes so she could get out of the ones she was wearing. The sheer amount of blood dried and crusted onto Meg’s clothes meant they could probably stand on their own. She was able to find something she thought would be acceptable and brought them down only to find Cas and Meg doing their weird staring and flirting thing. Meg got changed after making some semi-filthy parting remarks to Cas that made Emma wish she had taken longer to find the clothes.
Kudos and Comments mean a lot, feel free to come talk to me about it on tumblr too. I'm Scarecrowmax on there too.
She's glad to have Sam back but feels bad that Cas had to take on his crazy because she wanted to get to know him better, and she wants to get to know Meg better too, maybe it's a side effect of descending from an all-female race but she wants more female friends damn it.
She’s really happy Claire gets cured because she knows that’s what she wants but, at the same time she’s got this weight in her chest because how is it fair that Claire can be cured from being a monster while Emma has to carry it forever? Emma didn’t ask for it either and she can’t drink something and not have to worry about control and holding onto her human side when she gets angry instead of going full Amazon and decimating someone
I feel like Sam and Emma would actually be decently similar, and he’d be there for her when she worries that her Amazon side is more dominant, because I’m sure she’s got days where her powers are more obvious and all, and he’s used to those kinds of feelings. After all, he’s the boy with the demon blood, he knows what it’s like to be looked at as something different, it’s not an exact thing but it’s enough that he can emphasize.
Trying to do family therapy with Lucifer and God just felt ridiculous, how do you help them get past all their shit also, how can you possibly fix millennia of abandonment/daddy issues? Lucifer was just throwing barbs and trying to get attention and an apology for the cage and everything else but Chuck wouldn't do it.
you’re so right. They absolutely meditate together, Emma initially gets into it because she likes the feeling of the waves against the houseboat and finds that helps but then it’s just a habit and she likes it. Also she gets Sam into it and helps center him on what’s real and actually there
Sam was doing the second trial and Dean couldn’t go with him. Not that he was itching to go back to hell, the opposite really, but the fact that Sam was going and he couldn’t go with him and keep him safe had him all out of sorts. Emma was nervous too, she didn’t know that much about Hell as neither Sam nor Dean would talk much about it, but she knew enough to know that Sam shouldn’t have to go back and that he was in a lot of danger. The two of them were just trying to stay positive and not think of the million and one things that could go wrong for Sam.
They got her out of the bathroom and onto one of the shitty couches in the living space and she explained what was going on. Demons were searching for Lucifer’s crypts in order to find an angel tablet. Now that was interesting and potentially helpful. After Meg got them up to speed on the basics they moved back to the house with the now dead demon in the kitchen.
She was supposed to have been there for it all. From patching scraped knees to dancing at their weddings. She was supposed to have been able to watch her boys grow up. Watch them fall in love, go to college, to be there for Dean to announce she was gonna be a grandmother, to keep him from panicking when Emma was born, and to hold her baby granddaughter. But instead, she missed it all, she missed it all and her boys are older than she is, and the only way she'll ever be older than them again is if she outlives them. Of course with them being hunters that's a distinct possibility. She might have to watch her boys die doing something she swore to herself they never would. Something she tried so hard to distance herself from. And she knows it’s her fault.  She made that deal with the yellow eyed demon and her death got John into the life.
Going through the old archives of random stuff the men of letters had collected was a mixed bag, you got something called a spear of destiny (cool name but what the hell does it do?) and old porn in the same box.Why would you think to store those together? Emma let out a sigh of relief when Sam said there were a string of suspicious deaths and they should check them out. She’d had enough of the Men of Letters’ odd sorting system for the day.
Emma somehow always managed to wake up right as they were pulling up to the bunker, every time about 3 minutes out she always stirred. As she woke she realized what she was wrapped up in. Dean had told her why he kept it in the trunk, told her it didn’t fit him quite right anymore, but he didn’t want to get rid of it, she knew the importance. She clutched it tight around herself and flashed her dad a smile when he looked over, she knew he hadn’t worn it in years, but she swore she could almost smell his aftershave and that mild smokey smell that seemed to cling to most of their jackets from salt and burns on it still. It smelled like comfort and home. She decided that if he was willing to wrap her up in it while she slept then it was going to be hers now. She slipped it on properly as she got out of the car, grabbed her stuff out of the trunk, and headed to her room. She didn’t see it but Dean smiled as she walked away confident as could be in the old jacket. He was so proud of her and so honored that she wanted to be like him. She’d stolen all his old jewelry awhile ago, and he’d gotten her a thick leather band to fully cover the brand the amazons put on her wrist within a week of meeting her. She was the best part of his life and he was so damn proud of her. If she wanted to be like him then just maybe he wasn’t quite as bad as he thought he was at times.
Instead, he leaned on the fireplace mantle and crossed his ankles. He was wearing loose pants and a snug henley that highlighted the muscles he worked so hard at. He looked at Rowena, and Cas decided to try and help his friends out a bit.
Finally, he could stall no more. He sat on the bed and rubbed the back of his neck. Cas gingerly sat down on the end of the bed, perched like he was ready to bolt at the slightest provocation.
Dean tried not to move, he honestly did, but his tongue disagreed and kinda slid along Cas’ finger, definitely not licking him, just, you know, sliding a bit. On accident.
Dean’s hand clenched randomly on his cock as he focused all his attention on where Cas was fucking him, all pretense discarded. He could feel his orgasm building with each stroke, partly elicited by what Cas was doing, but mostly caused by the fact that this was
Jack had leftover popcorn, which he offered to Dean, who took it and listened while Jack talked at length about the animated movie they’d gone to. After a while, Cas redirected him to bed, leaving the three of them in the kitchen.
“Dean, I’m sorry. I’ve been pushing your buttons a bit lately because I was a little bit annoyed about… the lasagna. I wanted to get you back, but I didn’t want to push it so far that you got mad. But I don’t want to go. I don’t want to feel like I have no other choice.”
Dean felt the corner of his mouth quirk up. Cas’ eyes crinkled, and a moment later, they were both grinning at each other. He was still a sticky mess, but it felt fucking amazing.
Cas pulled himself up onto his elbows and Dean reached between their bodies to wrap his hands around their cocks. He looked down to watch, mesmerized by the view, the feel of them sliding together. He could barely hold on. Cas was doing most of the work, and when he looked up, he saw that Cas was not looking down between them. He was looking right into Dean’s eyes.
Sam came into the living room, but he didn’t smile. He just looked a little disappointed when he saw that there wasn’t any room left on the couch.
He called out for Sam and Dean, but there was no answer. He made his way to the dorms. The lights were dim, and he had spent enough time here over the years to realize he was alone. He made his way to his room.
Dean moved away from the car and turned to face Cas in order to try and see better. The wings were long, at least six feet each, and ragged, with burned and bare patches, and spots with obviously missing feathers, but they were definitely real. And unlike in the kitchen, where they were confined by space and tucked away as quickly as they had appeared, this time Cas stretched them out to either side, spreading the damaged feathers out like fingers, before raising them up above his head, the tips reaching nearly twice his height.
He clicked on the item, then added it to the cart, plus two more just to be safe, then, thank Chuck, the payment information was already there. Confirm order… ok. Good. Done. He stood up shakily. Definitely time for bed.
Because she knew him, she saw right away the sadness he’d been able to hide from others. She could sense it, and she almost brought him to tears as she took his face in her hands and smiled at him. “Oh sweety,” she said. “You miss him, don’t you.”
A moment later, Rowena came out of her room at the same time as Cas came out of his. “Oops, wrong room,” she giggled.
Eight hours on the road, however, left him a little less energetic. He drove past a few motels on his way into town, but he saw no sign of the Impala, so he stopped at a diner to grab a meal. There were newspapers by the front counter, so he took one of those as well, hoping to see a headline that might indicate what the boys had come here to hunt.
Dean stood outside the adjoining door to the right hand room and took a deep breath, getting up his nerve. He could do this. He knocked gently on the door.
life. He could imagine it now, the look on Dean’s face. He knew he’d be welcomed, he still heard Dean’s prayers, and he knew now in a way he never had before, that his feelings flowed both ways.
“I still want to examine you again, just to be certain.” Cas helped Dean out of his jacket and led him over to the bed, directing him to sit. He turned on the light and leaned in close to Dean’s face. Dean could smell him, a kind of familiar fresh-air-and-ozone scent that Dean thought should be sold as fabric softener because if he could wash his sheets in it, he would seriously never get out of bed. He almost moaned.
“I’m fine. I feel… a bit embarrassed about my reaction, I suppose. And maybe a bit more relaxed than usual, but I’m fine. I should go help Jack in the kitchen.” He turned and left the room.
Sam picked it up right away, and was confidently doing blue runs by the second day and was already talking about getting his own skis. Castiel was skeptical at first, but he picked it up easily, saying it was the closest he’d come to flying since he lost his wings. Despite that, he spent most of the weekend on the bunny hill with Dean.
Dean jumped as Rowena spoke right behind him. He hadn’t even heard her follow him up the stairs. “Brilliant! My room is right next to yours!” She walked past him and entered the room on the right. Sam was right behind her on the stairs, lugging all her luggage with him.
Cas thought about it for a moment. He tried to see it from Dean’s point of view. If he could watch Dean’s eyes glaze over, see him moan and…
This guy really was perceptive. Dean shook his head. “No,” he said. “My interests lie… elsewhere.” He imagined Cas hearing this conversation and felt his face heat up. He was so distracted that he didn’t even notice Guy sidle closer.
After Sam and Dean realized what he was up to and caught the news of the dead comic book shop worker on the police scanner they split up so Sam could find the man who was supposed to be buried in the graveyard and Dean could stop Henry. Emma stayed with Dean, she felt like she had convinced him to do it by accident and wanted to fix it. Dean told her it wasn’t her fault when she voiced that but she wasn’t convinced.
Emma wears Dean’s old ring, which was originally Mary’s wedding ring, and Mary came back wearing it too. The duplication of it is weird to her, seeing this girl, supposedly her granddaughter, wearing the most important piece of jewelry she ever owned like it’s nothing. Like it’s just a random accessory, not as the commitment to getting out of the life that Mary always thought of it as. This girl, not even human, wears the ring Mary always viewed as her path out of hunting. She was living proof that Mary couldn’t keep her boys safe and away from the life and she was wearing her ring. It was a punch to the gut.
She’d never seen her dad do something like what he did to Randy and the other guys threatening Claire, but as scary as that was she also knew that if someone had threatened her he’d probably do something similar mark or no mark. She was starting to think it was a matter of time before he lost all ability to reign himself in in a fight.
Other nights she dreams of her own death, either on hunts or by being shot the first time she met her father. In the ones she dies in the motel in Seattle either Dean shoots her because she attacked him or Sam would shoot her after he charged into the room because he didn’t realize she meant no harm. And the ones where Sam kills her are almost worse because if Dean killed her for attacking at least she’d deserve it, but Sam did almost kill her because he didn’t realize. And there’s still days he pulls his gun quickly and she has to suppress a flinch because she remembers being on the other side of it. In those dreams, she can almost feel the bullet ripping through her and she feels the floor when she drops. In some of the ones she dies at her uncle’s hand, her dad would cross the room and come to hold her as she died. She’d see the tears in his eyes, feel the way his chest heaves as he pulls her into his arms, and she’d hear Sam drop his gun in the distance as he realized what he did. Those were usually the days she’d wake with tears on her cheeks and a weight in her chest.
Other times though her mind decided to play through the possibilities of what could happen to her after she died instead of focusing on how it would happen. She knew she was going to Purgatory after she died, no ifs ands or buts about it. It was the only afterlife available to her and she knew that she’d probably be hunted even worse than her father had been when he was there because she had turned on her own kind. Not only was she a Winchester but she was also a monster who hunted other monsters. She’d face the wrath of everyone she put down and probably everyone the rest of her family had. And it was doubtful she’d have a whole lotta luck avoiding them or making alliances with others. Her old tribe would undoubtedly shun her for loving her father instead of killing him. There were times where she would wake up and wonder if her mother would hate her for not being a proper Amazon. Lydia had given her the necklace before turning her over, so maybe she would care about her and would help her in death.
“Yeah but I get a vote too,” Emma smiled at Meg, “you helped us, it’s not like you’re in the running for Hell’s most evil this year. And besides, as far as it goes I think we’ve got more of a salt stockpile than anyone, so if we need to we can ward rooms from you pretty easily.”
He pulled her in for a hug, kissed her on the forehead, told her that he loved her and expected her back, and sent her to Purgatory. He fell to his knees and let out a sob. He let himself have a minute before getting up, wiping off his face, and getting her into the trunk. He did his best to not break down further but tears streamed down his face the whole time. He climbed into Baby and started the drive up to Maine.

She appreciates Rowena so much for trying to help, they’re friends and she trusts her with bringing back her dad’s memory. Emma is absolutely the one to drive Baby to the witches' place to get Dean and Rowena there because she knows her dad would never let Rowena drive, or adjust the seat enough for her to reach the peddles because Dean would never be able to get in to fix it. She also leaves him in the car to go fight the bastards that did that to him because of course she does and helps Rowena get to the book to reverse the spell
She only felt more off-kilter when Lucifer arrived wearing Cas, if there was any way she could kill him without hurting Cas she would, she hated seeing Cas used like that. She knew he had to have been completely tricked by him. And she could see how Sam flinched any time Lucifer got near him, her dad had told her the basics and she knew not to ask Sam but she wished she knew just what he'd done to her uncle so she didn't risk making it worse when he was dealing with the memories of it all.

After a little bit Dean realized that other than the few small interactions she’d had with him as a ghost Emma really didn’t know much about Bobby so he started telling her some stories of weeks they’d spent with him over the years. Some simple things like working on cars, or Bobby teaching him how to make his first meatloaf, and others were the things like how he was the first person he went to after coming back from Hell, that he was the first person to treat him kindly in forty long years. He hated thinking about how much time Bobby had now spent in Hell, he just hoped he was stronger than he had been and hadn’t broken so easily. He knew Bobby would smack him and call him an idjit for thinking he’d broken easily when he’d lasted as many decades as he had but he still hated the fact that he’d broken at all and couldn’t stand the thought of Bobby doing what he had. He had to believe that Bobby was better and somehow avoided the worst of Hell because they didn’t need him to break as quickly and that there was hope that he’d never been in the positions Dean had.
So Mary goes on even more hunts and maybe they hear that the BMoL have taken down the tribe that Emma hails from, Lydia is dead and Emma has super conflicted feelings about that because she hasn’t seen her mother since she gave her the locket and handed her over but that’s still her mom ya know? So Emma is super conflicted, and Dean is trying so hard to comfort her because if he knows anything it’s what it feels like to lose a parent that loved you but also didn’t treat you right, but he’s also dealing with the anger he has over finding out Mary was a part of it. Because he doesn’t care about the Amazons just how it affects Emma and his little girl hurts over this, and how could her grandmother cause her this kinda pain? Did Mary actually know going in? It’s a mess.
Also, I think Emma totally carries like an almost ridiculous number of weapons on her at all times bc she’s a warrior and a Winchester so, yeah def packing an angel blade and is better off than a lot of the hunters there
The other three Winchesters rounded on Henry, crouching down around him as he bled out. They got to share a few final words, he told them that he was proud of them and that as long as there were Winchesters alive there was hope and died.
Kudos and comments are very appreciated. If you wanna see something in particular lemme know, and if you wanna follow me on Tumblr I'm Scarecrowmax on there too.
Dean enjoyed repairing the car with Emma, it felt like some of the most normal of their father-daughter bonding days they’d had. A lot of the little things about working on the car with her reminded him of time he’d spent with Bobby working on and learning about various cars. It made him realize just how many of his happy childhood memories were centered around working on cars in the yard with him. He was even more grateful for all the days of being a normal kid that Bobby gave to him and Sam, and that he had shown him how a dad should be.
Emma has nightmares, almost impossible to avoid in their line of work, but sometimes it felt like she had nothing but nightmares. They came in all types, reliving hunts, failing to save people by inches, dreams of who she might have been, dreams of her own death, endless possibilities of what would happen when she got to Purgatory, and the occasional one about her father as a demon- what he would have done if he’d caught her in the bunker during the cure process.
Like it had been when they met Adam for the first time, or rather the ghoul wearing his face, Dean was hesitant to believe they were related and Sam was happy to accept it once a few facts were verified. Emma was slightly skeptical but at the same time excited, she’d never met anyone related to her besides Sam and Dean. She found herself looking at him and searching for a resemblance, they had similar jawlines, he did look a bit like Sam when it came to their cheekbones, and he and her dad had similar noses too.
It all went to shit again when her dad offered to be the vessel for a soul based bomb to kill Amara. She wanted to scream, couldn’t things be okay for five friggin minutes? Did she have to lose him again? After everything, she knew he blamed himself for her being let out but Emma also blamed herself. She was the one who had pushed Sam to try and find a way to get rid of the mark because she was scared. She was just as culpable as him and if there was any way he'd let her do it she'd be the one going for Amara. Even Crowley and Rowena could tell how much it hurt her to see her dad offering himself up like it was nothing. Charlie, Benny, and Meg weren't there to talk sense into Dean, Sam understood his guilt and was willing to let him do it, Rowena didn't care enough about him to stop him, and Crowley wasn't going to stop him either he just put his hand on Emma's shoulder and gave it a squeeze. If only Cas would just tell him not to do it, Cas could convince him to stop but he didn't say anything. He didn't stop him this time and she felt like her world was ending.
Cas was incredibly sketchy during the interrogation, going so far as to kill the demon before they’d gotten all the information she had and flying off. They were now stuck playing catch-up and that was never a good position to be in, especially for a hunter. They got to the hotel she’d divulged their hostage was at just in time to see light flashing from one of the windows, a tell tale sign that Cas was getting his smiting on. The three Winchesters raced up and arrived in time to witness Cas taking out the last demon. When they opened the bathroom door they saw none other than a surprisingly blonde Meg sitting on the floor chained up.
But also I think he’d be the one to help her more with school stuff because Dean is smart but he’s not built for academic setting learning and studying and Sam is. So she and him have study bonding times because she’s absolutely registered for school with fake documents, and is going to the local school in Lebanon for high school during like s8 because they want her to be able to have some kind of normal and make friends. Also, she and Kevin are pals, not related but important that you know this.
When they pulled into a diner after getting away Henry finally told them why he wanted John, that he was Dean and Sam’s grandfather.
That simple statement said it all, he loved her before he even knew for sure she was his. He was her dad, always would be, and would never kill her. Even at his worst, his most demonic, he didn’t do it. Chuck was wrong and she just had to hold onto that, her existence defied God’s knowledge and she was good with that.
"It never woulda gone differently kiddo, you're my kid and I love you okay. Always have, always will. Loved you since the moment I saw you in your crib."
A response to the ask "for your series on Emma coming back please talk about her and Sam!! I wanna know what you think their dynamic is" on Tumblr
Come talk to me on Tumblr or let me know what you think in the comments here. I'm Scarecrowmax on there too, and if you want to leave a comment here or send an ask on there you can gimme a topic to talk about in the AU.
So I think with Magda’s trauma around everything supernatural and her psychic powers I think she’d be much more hesitant around Emma if she knows from the get-go, but if Emma helps save her then she’d probably connect hard. And I think Emma would push to have Magda stay with them for a little while at least to get her powers under control (okay I just want to save her but it’s my au) so Magda moves in. And Sam is really into the whole teaching the new gen of psychic kids because he knows how scary it is, and Emma helps keep her calm and focused because that was big for her learning to control her powers. And Sam is a good teacher because by now he’s had a good bit of practice helping with Emma’s school stuff, ASL, and general hunting crap and also is drawing on what he remembers about his own powers.
Chuck huffed annoyed, "How could I have known that? I'd never done anything like that, I can only foresee things to a degree based on past knowledge. I just have more knowledge than other people and can see it that way. Definitely didn't foresee you though, would've thought that would go differently."
“Listen, I understand that this is not your idea of a happy ending, okay, and that – that you're disappointed that me and Sam are mouth-breathing hunters. But you know what? We stopped the Apocalypse.”
Okay, so there are 2 versions I've written for Taxi Driver, there's this one a more canon adjacent version and one where there's a major difference. That version will be the next chapter.
This is her first experience with angels and until he gets his smiting on she's fairly unimpressed. Meg seems kinda cool to her though, and since she isn't judging the whole Amazon thing Emma can be a little more open about it which she appreciates. Unfortunately, her time with them is so limited with the way Cas takes on the worst of Sam's Lucifer issues and Meg staying.
Against his own will he’s raising his blade up, Dean is on his knees covered in blood from the blows Cas rained on him.
And with that Cas takes back control, fully aware of the horrors his hands were responsible for he stared down at Dean letting his blade fall from his hand. He picked up the tablet and as it began glowing brightly he cradled Dean’s cheek in his hand hoping Dean could feel his apology with the grace he sent flowing through him to heal him. He could barely stomach what he had just been made to do.
The jacket dwarfed her smaller frame, she looked so much smaller tucked up under it, it almost reminded him of how Sammy looked wrapped up under it when they were younger. He could remember a time not long after he got the jacket from their dad where they were moving again after John wrapped up a hunt. It was a winter night and he laid the jacket on Sam like a blanket while he snoozed in the back seat so he wouldn’t get too cold.
Sam came back with a soul in either arm and deposited Benny’s back before releasing Bobby’s. It almost felt like a third funeral for the man, though it felt fitting to do as much for him as it felt like he had done so much more for them in his life. During the release Benny had a hand on one of Emma’s shoulders and Dean had his hand on Benny as if to be sure he was really back, to reassure himself that he hadn’t killed one of the best friends he’d ever had for good. Crowley and Naomi interfered but Bobby’s soul made it to Heaven as it was supposed to and the three of them got Sam home safe. Benny left the next day to get his truck and camper but came back after because he was worried about Sam and also realized Dean needed him to stick around for at least a little while, he needed to know Benny was safe and wasn’t going to just leave him and he was happy to do so. They did some movie nights, and Charlie coming to visit not long after was a blessing in disguise even though they worked that djinn case during her visit. Charlie stuck around the bunker for a bit after saying goodbye to her mother, which was good for both her and the Winchesters.
Dean let her in on what was going on while Emmanuel was saying goodbye to Daphne so she knows roughly who he is and why Dean seems so heartbroken that he isn't recognized.
With how much of their time was always wrapped up in cases or healing from getting beat up on a case he was glad that he could give her some more normal and happy memories. The two of them worked around each other under the hood well together, he’d taught her a bit about the Impala when she’d shown some interest around a year ago, and sometimes she’d just hang out with him while he tinkered; they’d listen to music and he’d explain what he was doing sometimes so she knew he liked having her there with him.
But even going human again didn’t remove the mark and its influence on Dean. And it got worse after that, almost like it had tasted the corruption it could wreak in his body and seemed like it wanted to do it again and make it stick this time. He was more violent in fights, he was more irritable, and thinking about his promise to Emma was one of the only things he could do to try and pull himself back and take back control from the mark.

After Emma got behind the wheel, he showed her how to adjust the mirrors, seat, and how to grip the wheel for the best control. She was hesitant, a bit nervous about the power of a car, but during that first lesson she only swiped a curb once with the wheel as she turned. Dean let her know it was fine, she hadn’t done any damage and to just be a bit more careful. He was careful to not convey his own nervousness because he knew that wouldn’t help. He refused to raise his voice during the lesson, A) it wouldn’t help, and B) it was part of the pact he’d made with himself after finding out about Emma, even before she showed she wasn’t going to kill him he decided that he had to be better than his dad whenever he could be. Overall she did really well and was clearly much more confident by the end of the lesson. Since they were already there and she seemed okay he had her try and park a few times, one time for every circle of the lot. Not very good the first few times, very much in the middle of two spaces the first time, angled all to hell the next, but after a half a dozen she was doing alright, and he had her try and park near curbs and in the crappy small spaces partially taken up by the concrete planters. She got to being consistently good and they swapped seats so Dean could drive them back for the day to keep her from being overwhelmed on her first lesson by having to drive around other cars.
Emma finally interjected, “It’ll still happen, Heaven and Hell wanted it to. They’d do it still and there’d be nobody around to stop it. You could end the world by doing this, you get that right? I mean you’re fine gambling with our lives because it’s three people and they wouldn’t really be dying right, but it’s billions of people on the line if you screw this up. Michael and Lucifer would have decimated the planet if it weren’t for Dad and Uncle Sam, are you willing to risk all of them? Your son could end up being one of the people you’d let die by changing things, and his death would be on you this time. So what’s it gonna be?”
Meg of course decided she wanted more information and once Dean had gone inside with Cas brought up to Sam that she’d “spent time in that walking corpse of yours” as an attempt to get him to spill, unfortunately for her it didn’t get her anything but Emma’s attention. She hadn’t known Meg had possessed Sam before. And Meg didn’t realize just how much Sam had changed since that occurrence, she didn’t know him like she thought she did, and Sam wasn’t going to tell a demon (especially one who had actively worked with Lucifer in the past) any of his problems.
Taxi Driver rewrite with Emma, this one is more or less in line with canon with some minor adjustments.
He tries so hard though, Winchesters don’t give up on family, or at least the good parts of the family don’t. So because he realizes she doesn’t want to talk they learn ASL together. He learned a bit at Stanford but is rusty as hell, and she’s learning from the ground up. It’s rough but after a bit they get pretty good, he’s been reading some books on trauma to try and help her because well Lore is Lore right? And that helps him too. After a few months she starts talking a bit, mostly though she still relies on the ASL they’ve learned, and starts signing as she speaks, a habit she never fully drops and she appreciates once they run into Eileen.

Emma hated having Chuck in the bunker, God or not he was annoying and disruptive to the flow of their lives. Plus he never seemed to wash his own dishes and she was half tempted to break his stupid #1 Dad mug over his head. #1 Deadbeat maybe, but #1 Dad he is not, she had only met a few angels for any length of time but she knew enough that he'd royally screwed the lot of them up in one way or another. Cas absolutely felt abandoned by him and would get the same kind of look on his face at times when God was brought up as Dean did when her grandfather was brought up and that told her enough right there. She'd read John's journal and if God was anything like John, then well, a mug would be the least he'd be owed. The main thing that kept her from doing it was the fact that he said he could help them with Amara, and getting rid of her was too important to ruin their chance on that.
Him responding to whatever it was that her dad and uncle had said made her chuckle, they really thought that him leaving the room would keep him from hearing them? He’s an angel, they’re kinda known for being able to hear people.
Dean reached for his gun, which he didn’t have, but before he could do anything, Cas had walked over to the leviathan, only instead of smiting him, he just stood close to him and announced, “Everyone, this is Guy, our ski instructor.”
Castiel visited Claire, stayed a while with Jody, drove out to Bobby’s old place. Claire was happy to see him. She said she was going to marry Kaia, and she wanted him to be there. Castiel agreed.
Mary had fun for a bit, but she got bored quickly. When she spotted some snowboarders, she suddenly wanted to try that instead. Guy was offended, but he helped her exchange her equipment anyway. He drew the line at instructing her, though. In the end, a bunch of teenagers took her under their wing, and by Sunday afternoon she was trying out the rails in the feature park.
Dean smirked, and looked at Cas, whose ears turned a little red. “Maybe not everything out of our systems. I’d be up for round two. How about you, Cas?”
“Well, she said she heard it from Cas.” Sam hung his head in shame. Rowena glared at him, but she had to admit he was kind of cute, his long hair in his eyes, towering more than a foot over her. Not that she would give him the satisfaction of forgiving him this easily.
The next morning was a little awkward, but Guy turned out to be an exemplary instructor, and everyone had a great time.
Dean felt his face heat up and his heart start to race. Maybe he hadn’t missed his chance after all. “Uh, yeah.” He cleared his throat and opened the door to his room. He tilted his head, one eyebrow lifted, a silent question. Cas nodded and walked past him into the room.
Sam felt bad for Dean. He’d been pining for Cas at least since Purgatory, and Sam had known about it for ages. But Sam was also certain that as an angel, Cas wasn’t capable of those feelings. He loved Cas, but he knew he would break Dean’s heart, and he wasn’t sure Dean would be able to deal with that kind of rejection.
Whatever she was watching right now, however, was not soothing. She had connected a speaker and was watching it at a deafening volume.
Sam started, jumping to his feet, machete in hand. His arm was raised, but he lowered it a moment later in confusion. “Cas?” he said. His voice sounded broken.
Guy greeted Sam and then turned to Dean, fixing him with a smile that still reminded Dean a little too much of Dick Roman for his own peace of mind. “Enchanté,” he murmured. “I was just in the kitchen putting the supplies away. I have a menu planned for you all today.” He listed some fancy dishes he was planning to make.
After lunch on a day between hunts, he told her what the plan was and drove the car out to an abandoned parking lot so she wouldn’t have to worry about other cars. He’d learned that the hard way with Sam and it wasn’t an experience he wanted to recreate. Telling a kid to back a car up and get out of a crowded motel parking lot into traffic had been asking for trouble and he was lucky he’d been able to fix the damage and convince the guy not to make anything of it. They’d been too close to getting the cops called on them that day and that woulda just been the start of the problem. Not happening again even if most of those issues were well behind them. He’d make the experience better for Emma than it had been for him and Sam at the bare minimum.

Unfortunately the suspicious deaths were the fault of a group of demons in the town who were digging around. If they could stop it then the town would be fine again. Cas’s sudden arrival was a nice surprise to the Winchesters, though he was acting odd and kind of awkward even for him. But they put it to the back of their minds when he started talking about searching for the other half of the demon tablet and Lucifer’s crypts. Emma opted to head to the kitchen with him when he went to interrogate the demon they had trapped in there.
Dean was right, It took a few months to get it back in shape, only a few of the parts had gone bad from sitting around for as long as it had. The biggest problem they ran into was finding replacement parts that weren’t ridiculously priced because while they weren’t exactly hurting for money with the cards Charlie set up, some old habits die hard. They were even able to find a new stereo for it that would let her play tapes or, to Dean’s exasperation, hook up the iPod Sam had gotten her when Dean was in Purgatory.
They found him and got him back to the bunker but that was really just step one. From there they had to cure him, they’d decided it would probably be safest to outsource the blood instead of using Sam’s for the injections, but there was still a question of if that would work or if you could cure a demon made the way Dean was. And then when he got out of the restraints during the curing process.
Before Henry had a chance to answer and Dean had a chance to do more than look at her proudly, Abaddon called to trade Sam for Henry and the key he had as she had apprehended him at Larry’s home. Henry tried to finish the spell to change things anyway but Dean knocked him out and put him in the car in order to get his brother back.
“Cas. Cas. Please,” he reached up towards Cas, towards the man about to kill him, and begs “I know you're in there. I know you can hear me. Cas…”
“I don’t have a choice.” The tremor in her voice betrayed her, she wasn’t a killer and she didn’t want to kill him. She wanted to be accepted and to have her mission completed, but not to have to do it herself.
“It’s okay Dad, I can do this. Let me do this.” She was her father’s daughter, willing to die to save those she loved and stubborn to a fault. She’d made up her mind and was going to do it even if she had to do it herself.
Emma is nearly as happy as Dean and Jack when Cas comes back because he's family to her too. And Cas gives her a big hug right after he hugs Jack, and she tells him they missed him during it but then after they let go she slugs his arm and tells him not to do that again.

He had no clue what it would look like once they popped the hood but the body was in good shape, no visible rust or dents that they’d have to fix, and hopefully, that meant there wouldn’t be too much to do. He figured most of it would be showing her the serious upkeep stuff he hadn’t had a chance to show her on the Impala yet with a few parts getting replaced.
His voice broke as he pleads with him, “it's me. We're family. Please, we need you. I need you. Don’t do this Cas,” he breathed in as deeply as his lungs would allow before an “I love you,” passed his lips with the blood that flowed from his mouth. Streams of blood dripped down his face as he proclaimed his love to Cas for the first time and he couldn’t help but remember that first time Cas had beaten him like this. He had almost said yes to Michael and Cas told him he had given up everything for him. And now Dean, once again bloody, was in the position to give up everything they had worked for just for Cas. He’d give him the tablet if that’s what it took just as long as he was his Cas again.
Also, this was actually fairly based on my own experiences learning to drive, and yes I did swipe a curb with my wheel while turning in an empty parking lot on my first time out. Emma is much more confident than I was early on and I very much condensed her learning because I didn't want to figure out timelines or anything and them doing a little every day for a couple months like I did doesn't really make sense in terms of the show so Emma's a prodigy. I mean they had Jack learn in like 10 minutes right? I haven’t gotten there yet but why not her too?
“You always have a choice Emma, you can put that down and you can get out. I won’t make you kill anybody, okay? That’s what family is supposed to be,” he stepped towards her carefully not wanting to startle her, “it's supposed to be people who care about you and what you want, not people who tell you to kill. If you put that down I promise you won’t have to worry about them again, I’ll make sure of it. You told me what they did to you, and I wouldn’t do that to you ever, you’d be as safe with me as I can make it. I may be a hunter but I’ll never make you hunt. Not a day in your life if you don’t want to.”
He's less talkative than he used to be and Emma starts teaching him the asl she and Sam learned, especially since she hasn't dropped it and still has quiet days. He takes longer to get used to it but he's pretty good at picking up visual patterns (see the blood splatter symbol he notices in 1x16) and can do at least the most basic signs after a short while. Like coffee, not having people audibly talking is a big help in his grumpy bear morning moments.

But when they find Jack it's easier for them to talk to him and understand him. And for Emma to empathize with him because she too grew up rapidly and had to suddenly understand the world around her. Dealing with the fact that the people who saw her as the age she looked expected her to. She almost immediately declares herself his big sister and once she does that Dean can't say anything. He can hate that Cas got killed but he can see it wasn't Jack, and seeing just how much Emma and Jack relate to each other makes it so he couldn't hate him if he wanted to.
The lodge had three rooms on the main floor, and three more upstairs, with a rail looking down into the living room. Cas thought about it for a moment, and then decided to take the one on the left, upstairs. Dean followed him up the stairs, pausing at the doorway. Cas took the bag back and set it on the nightstand. Dean looked into the room and noticed the door leading to the next room over. “What a coincidence! My room is right next door!”
“I don’t know, man. It was like a prank, I guess. Like how Sammy and I sometimes play jokes on each other. It doesn’t last long, or hurt you, so I kind of thought it was harmless. But yeah.” he looked at the floor and rubbed the back of his neck. “I didn’t really see it as like I was drugging you, without permission. Oh, shit, man, I’m so sorry.”
He wasn’t sure what he could do about it either, short of starting a fight with Cas. Jerking off certainly didn’t help. He could go to town to see if he could get laid, maybe, but that hadn’t appealed to him in so long he couldn’t even remember how long it had been. At least a year.
Dean was losing his mind as Cas slowly worked his way around, his fingers digging deliciously into his waist, his hips, and his thighs, then back again, avoiding his ass completely. His cock, impossibly hard, was leaking into the bedding, and he pushed back against Cas’ hands, not only to release the pressure on his aching dick, but also to encourage Cas to maybe, possibly, narrow down his focus to a somewhat smaller range.
“Well, if it makes you feel better he never met me. He uh, he died when dad was 27. And I’m not as old as I look, I was born last year. I’m an Amazon,” she was worried he wouldn’t take that last bit well, though she knew she’d be able to take him if she had to.
Dean was giving him shit for not being there for John and if Sam’s clenched jaw was any indication Dean wasn’t really yelling at Henry for not being there for John. He was yelling at John over his lost childhood, the years of being left in a motel room without enough money to last, over parenting his little brother, over every event that left him terrified that he wouldn’t be a good dad. Sam leaves the room to talk him down a few minutes after he stormed out, leaving Emma and Henry together again.
Cas dies, Jack is born, and Dean is shattered. But this time around he can't hate Jack the way he did in canon because he knows that not all monsters are really monsters and he's known this for years now. Yeah Jack is biologically Satan's kid and so Dean's wary as hell but his golden eyes don't only make them think of Lucifer these days. They're so similar to the ones that Emma flashes when she gets mad at them for being overprotective, when she's in a mood, and when she gets in a fight. Flashing golden eyes also means family now.
Henry was mid-spell when they arrived, Dean was trying to talk him down but he didn’t want to listen. He felt he knew best and that he could change the past for the better, even willing to bargain with the existence of the three Winchesters who weren’t yet born in his time.
Saying goodbye was the hardest thing she'd ever done, and him joking about what kind of funeral he wanted was too much.
So when Claire gets bitten by the werewolf Emma is absolutely at her side the whole time, she understands the fear of being a real monster and what could happen if she loses control so she’s trying to help keep Claire calm and assuring her she’ll be okay and pull through and that she can choose not to be evil and that she’ll help her adjust
“That you are, Sammy,” Dean laughed. “Seriously, though. Rowena? I mean, sure she’s hot, but she’s also kinda witchy.”
It was uncertain, but not as much as the first one. Dean didn’t think Cas was going to bolt, at least. Dean’s hands started off at his sides, but it wasn’t long until he was lifting them, sliding them under Cas’ coat, and hooking his thumbs into Cas’ belt loops.
“Well, uh… I think it was... maybe… how you got all into it and happy? I don’t know. I actually don’t really know how I thought it was funny at all. It was… interesting, though, I guess, how you got all… uhh…” Dean looked at him helplessly.
He ran the cloth over his face and tried to cool down, while he attempted to will his body into submission. He should probably stop. But the truth was, Dean usually put a stop to any inappropriate touching long before it got to this point, and Castiel wasn’t entirely sure he wanted to stop before Dean made him. Besides. Dean had to know that he wasn’t truly ill.
And that is why Dean was digging through Sam’s herb cupboard in the middle of the night. It didn’t take long. The three baggies were sealed in a mason jar in the cupboard along with a million other things. Sam hadn’t even bothered to hide the stuff. He’d even labeled it, with a sticker that read “False Ironwort”
He glanced at Cas and frowned. He had taken the packet out of his pocket and was twiddling it between his fingers, absently bringing it up to his nose every once in a while. Irritation flared in him. He got to his feet, running his hands through his hair in frustration. Cas jumped at the sudden movement. “Dean?” he inquired.
Sam, of course, was trying to study up on some kind of lore something something, and so when the haunted gas station in New Mexico came up, Dean tagged Cas in to help. Then it turned out to be werewolves
He was freezing, lying in the pitch black on a cold floor, and for a moment, he thought he was in the Empty again. But it took only a moment to realize he was actually able to feel the floor beneath his fingertips, cold concrete, and as his eyes adjusted, he realized it wasn’t as dark as he thought. A sliver of light came from what looked to be a door left ajar.
Once inside, Cas grabbed Dean by his shirt and spun him around, shoving him up against the door. Dean let out an Oof that turned into a moan. Cas was
“Maybe, Dean. But right now, I feel like you’re too far away.” He tugged Dean to his feet. “Let’s go to bed,” he said.
Sam wanted to tell him he shouldn’t be sending his information out to random companies, but before he could say anything, Jack burst out gleefully, “I won! I won!”
He didn’t know who leaned forward first, but it just kind of happened. Like gravity. They were standing there, then they were standing closer together. Then, he blinked, and they were nose to nose. Cas’ breath fanned over Dean’s face, once, twice, then they kissed.
Cas frowned, looking at his hand as though he just noticed he was holding it. He flushed a little and deposited it back into his pocket. “Not particularly, Dean.” He set his book down and stood up, taking the two steps needed to be within arms reach of Dean. He tilted his head to the side, his eyes narrowed. “Are you feeling all right?”
“I won a one weekend rental of a deluxe private ski lodge, complete with lessons from a former Olympic champion!”
“Me too. When I saw you licking that angel-nip off your hand, I wanted to put that shit on myself just so I could hear you make that sound up close.”
Cas groaned and covered his face. “It probably wouldn’t have been so bad, if it had just been in private, instead of in front of everyone.”
Sam stopped at the post office in Lebanon on his way home, breathing a sigh of relief when he saw the parcel from the rare herb website. Perfect. He’d summon this ghost, perform the ritual, then banish it. Easy peasy.
They gave Dean a hunter’s funeral, but there was nobody there but Sam and Castiel, and a dog that Sam said belonged to Dean.
Maybe if he had something to punch. He wondered for a minute if they had a punching bag down in the gym, but he hardly ever went there. But physical activity might just help. Maybe that’s why Sam went running all the time. Working off the blue balls.
He saw the blood on the floor before he made his way past the last stall, and a quick glance around revealed a beheaded corpse. Vampires then. He paused, listening. There was no noise, no sound of a fight, or voices. Nothing but…
“Really, I didn’t know they were still around. The Men of Letters have never found anything to suggest that they were, what sorts of powers do you have?” Henry lit up, ever the academic he wanted to know as much as possible about everything. It was why he’d been so drawn to the Men of Letters in the first place. The latter half of her statement captivated him enough that he chose not to think about how long his boy had been dead. Thinking of that was anguishing enough without thinking of how he could have died while his boys were fairly young.
When he started stalking around the bunker like he was going to kill her and Sam she was terrified of her father for the first time and understood that this was why he’d left, he didn’t want to risk hurting them. When Cas arrived and restrained him she sent him a prayer of gratitude because she couldn’t make the words come out. They still had to get him back into the chair so they could finish the cure, and Emma was so worried it wouldn’t work that she just sat on the floor of the dungeon with her arms around her knees staring at him as Sam worked. Once the cure worked and Dean was let loose again she hesitated for a second before hugging him harder than she ever had before while whispering into his shoulder how happy she was he was back and that he can’t ever do that to her again. He gripped her back just as tight and cried apologies into her hair for scaring her, and that he’d never let that happen again.
She and Sam got Kevin out of Crowley's hands a little while ago, he's back with mama Tran and both are warded and in a different state than they used to live in as safe as they can be in the world they live in. So the first few post-purgatory hunts are different but more normal. Dean introduces Emma and Benny, Sam chose to hang back not entirely sure about Benny but willing to let it lie. She and Benny get on like a house on fire, partially because he just gets her and takes who she is at face value and isn't wary of her, and partially because she knows she protected her dad when no one else could and she's so grateful to have Dean back. Also, he shows her and Dean how to cook some stuff on his lil camp stove he's got with his shitty camper bc love is food and food is love and Benny wants her to like him and this is my au and I say it happens.
