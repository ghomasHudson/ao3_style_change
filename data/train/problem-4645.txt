Dean looks ready to snap but Benny ignores Dean’s temper tantrum and kisses Castiel’s cheek. “If you wanna get together later, let me know. Have a good night, Cas.”
Dean tells Castiel that he really changed their lives and Castiel shakes his head and smiles, "no, they changed mine." He sees Dean glance at him, looking at him like the sun is shining out of his body. "Anyone could be nice. It doesn't take a lot. I learned so much from them and all I had to do was share a room with my brother. They really did it all."
Sam asks, “Aaron?”
Meg rubs Castiel’s arm, “so you stayed together all summer? God, I wish I had known you then. Maybe I could have helped.”
When Dean gets back from his last class, Cas is asleep on his bed with a book covering half of his face. He startles up when Dean comes over to move the book off his lips. “Dean?”
Claire waves goodbye and Mr. Winchester, through a mouth full of sandwich, says, “and don’t sweat the gaydar thing. I think you are just fine.”
He loved Dean. Loves him. Things would have been easy and Cas wouldn’t feel this heartbreak if only Dean had come out. But it’s never that simple. Cas understands that. But God does he wish things could have resolved.
Dean sees Anna making out with his childhood date, Lisa. He watches as a group of guys stand around the girls cheering. It definitely used to make Dean feel aroused but now he just feels bad looking at stuff like this. Because it’s not real and it’s definitely a show.
Dean wants to smash their mouths together, but he'll try to keep the public safe right now. "So?"
“So fucking hot.” Dean exclaims.
Dean would feel mortified if anyone he loved ever had to sit through his montage of Castiel and him aging together, but he sees Castiel and feels warm. He rubs his eye before anyone sees and excuses himself. It’s one thing to see a cute picture of toddlers having fun on a playdate. It’s innocent and perfect. But it’s another thing when Dean has to see how the photos change and how different Dean starts to look at his friend. How he goes from innocence and friendship to a look of love. And Dean can’t pretend that he’s going to fall in love with anyone else because he’s completely gone on Castiel.
Castiel doesn’t want to make it awkward. Charlie is such a sociable person that he feels comfortable around her. Not in the slightest bit worried she’d laugh him out of the office. “I was dating a boy.” She makes an ‘ooh’ noise and he laughs. “Was. He uh- he was closeted. Still is. We met last school year and we hit it off. And then I broke up with him."
Cas could go on forever. But when Dean's phone goes off with the song "heat of the moment," it sort of kills his mood. Dean rolls his eyes, "ugh shit. Sorry Cas. It's Sam."
Alex eyes the door and continues whispering just in case either of the teachers walk in. “Mr. Lafitte just asked why she was asking about it and she said she wanted to check the answer from the source before voting. She even said her friends all thought it was Mr. W and Ms. Bradbury screwing. Fucking stupid! She’s gonna ruin it all.”
Dean makes it to the shower before Cas.
Dean wants to defend his ego. But everything that second feels like it's piecing together. He's not gay, he's bi. He can still like women. He isn't being required to choose a side in what sexual fantasy he chooses to have. He always figured it was split between hetero and homo. Castiel laughs again and pats him on the shoulder, “glad I could help inform you.”
Castiel snorts, “I don’t ask for you to share. You just man-whore yourself so much it’s not hard to miss these stories.” He knows Dean doesn’t actually think Cas thinks that so he smiles when Dean cracks up. “But fine. I’ve known him for a long time and he’s been figuring out who he is and I blew him at the bowling alley. And then we fucked in his truck. Happy?”
Alex snorts, “that’s not what it's called. It’s just a beard.”
Castiel is out of breath from booking it behind Dean, trying to catch up. His hair is even more of a disgruntled mess then it was at the beginning of the day. Gabriel looks between Castiel and Dean and rolls his eyes. "I can see Cassy really helped you feel better Dean."
Besides the small changes, no one looking at the two would ever know something was wrong. Conversations flowed and they had no awkwardness in how they spoke about one another. It was just the small things like Dean scooting away from him or how he’d pull away when their fingers brushed while passing each other different food. It was in the way that Dean wouldn’t meet Castiel’s eyes for long.
Krissy gives a thumbs up and Claire gives her best sneaky smile. Lunch it is.
Sam throws his hands up, “Thank God! About time one of you said it.” Dean would ask Sam what he meant if the signs weren’t so obvious.
“Cas, can you just let me in!” Dean rattles the door as his fist meets the wood.
The bus ride back seemed to drag on forever. Maybe it was just because Dean and Castiel both felt equal holes in their chest. Someway, it could turn out to be the one that got away. What if a week from now Castiel can't go out? What if Dean in the next few days realizes he would rather date someone else? And vice versa.
“Please just... I need a moment.” His father storms out of the room and Mary glares at the doorway he left from.
Cas is stunned. He feels like he’s dreaming. No way is Dean telling him this. Castiel punches his own arm hard and Dean stares at him in shock. “Cas, what the hell?” He looks offended, “you don’t gotta hurt yourself here. Jeez. You said you wouldn’t be weird and act all sorry for me.”
Castiel lets his hips jerk and he sets them to a quicker pace. Dean feels the waves underneath slowly rock the boat back and forth. And if that's not one of the hottest things (besides Cas) then he doesn't know what would be.
The door swings open to Castiel who wipes his eyes. “There’s nothing left to say, Dean! We can’t keep doing this to each other.”
Emma grabs Claire’s hand and squeals, “we’re going to be sisters!”
Anna and Lisa link arms and give Dean a wave and giggle as Cas comes over. Cas notices Dean’s wearing the sweater he bought for him. He feels a warmth spread over his body but doesn’t want to have his hopes be held up. “Dean what’s going on? Are you okay?”
Claire laughs and Emma lets out a small “ohhh.” Dean shrugs and looks to his side at Castiel. Claire giggles again and pokes Castiel’s shoulder from the back seat. “So you are dating?”
Dean bites his lip and shrugs. “Well at least dad. And well…”
Dean lets John give him a hug and he holds his dad back. The hug is relatively short and John wipes his eyes off fast after but Dean understands. He thought John would scream at him, ignore it and pretend it never happened, or kick him out of the house. He thought of every possible bad reaction; even the ones he deep down knew would never happen, because that’s how he felt about himself. Hiding every part of himself that brought him joy did not do well for his well-being.
Cas doesn’t seem to understand and Dean makes their hands entwine. “Meg didn't say anything. I mean, we talked but she was keeping it in. I told Anna and Lisa. And ah Cassie. Told them they could tell whoever and you know how talkative they are.”
Mary doesn’t let Dean get off the hook too fast though. She scolds Dean in the kitchen and asks why Castiel rushed upstairs crying. Dean has never been one to lie to his mom. But he attempts to bury some pieces of this story from her. He tells her that Cole told everyone to play the game, spin the bottle. He tells her Cassie got jealous because Dean kissed someone else. He tells her that Castiel got overwhelmed. Mary gives him a sad look and sighs.
Dean tries to make him feel better but he doesn’t have the words to reassure Aaron. Aaron gives Dean a sad half smile and kisses his cheek. “I called a cab. It’s going to take me to the bus station.” Dean tells him he’ll pay for his travel and Aaron lets him, “for what it’s worth- you’re an amazing guy. And Cas would be the luckiest man on Earth to have you. Take care, Dean.”
Claire and Alex chose a strawberry and chocolate ice cream sandwich. Emma wanted a cup of dip n dots, Krissy chose a frozen lemonade cup, and Castiel, indeed,  got a drumstick cone. Dean would rather be hit in the groin than have to watch Castiel's tongue work, what could only be wonders, in the middle of the group.
Cas glares, “no.” He watches his friend bat his eyes and he doesn’t fold. “Balthazar, no.” He glances over at his other friend who hummed a noise at Balthazar’s downright moronic question. “God. Tell him he’s ridiculous, Meg!”
The car ride to the Winchesters was even worse. Cas and Balthazar sat in the back and Cas kept meeting Dean's eyes in the rear view mirror. Dean drove with Aaron up front. Which felt weird because that seat has been reserved for Cas and his brother Sammy for years. Aaron dressed up, nice slacks paired with a button up. While Dean was wearing jeans and an old band t-shirt. Cas wore a long sweater dress. Which is frustrating the hell out of Dean to be honest. Balthazar at least dressed down like Dean had. And although Dean’s in similar clothing, he still feels resent towards Balthazar for not even trying to get put together to meet the family.
Dean groans, feeling his erection rub against Castiel and he pulls his boxers down quickly, letting them fall to his ankles. He then lifts Castiel's ass upwards from the hood, pulling them down his thighs.
The car ride back to the apartment was agony. Cas palmed at Dean’s cock the ride back, whispering how badly he wanted Dean to fuck him. How badly Cas wanted to ride him until one or even both of them cried. Dean’s pants are fully tented before they’re even close to home.
He watches Castiel's eyes gaze over his entire face and he nearly breaks. If he doesn't kiss him, he's a goner.
Dean pries and Cas explains, “Alfie said I cheated on him because I got a lap dance. And I said I didn’t know he considered that cheating and so I said sorry and he made this dramatic scene about me being a slut and wanting to fuck any guy I saw,” Dean is genuinely surprised because the guy is such a nerdy shy dude. Didn’t seem the type. “So I told him he was just mad that I didn’t want to fuck him fifty times today and he stormed off angry. Doubt he thinks we’d be dating still.”
Dean claps his hands, "four. Yeah four is totally manageable."
“It was me, sir.”
Dean wears a button up and black slacks. He’s not as fashionable as Cas but he thinks he pulls off the look well despite that. He knows Cas likes everything Dean wears. He can see how Cas looks at him when he’s lounging around wearing an old band shirt and it’s the exact same as when Dean’s more dressed up.
Dean blankly states, “I think I like Cas.” He feels shocked by his realization but also feels like he’s finally gotten something off his shoulders that he didn’t know he was even carrying.
Dean looks at Claire and Emma, "actually Emma's my kid. Claire lives with Cas."
Dean slowly works Castiel's length into his mouth almost entirely and then begins to let his head bob. The tugs in his hair make him only more encouraged.
He’s never felt great when he overhears people talking about him. He will always think it’s unpleasant before he even knows what the topic is.
Castiel shakes his head and she snorts. “Kay just wanted to make that clear.” She let’s Cas choose a seat and then she plops herself onto the fluffy bean bag chair on the ground. “Floors all yours, Castiel.”
“I really screwed it up with him, dad. I don’t know what to do…”
As much as Dean doesn’t want to ruin the guy's chances with whatever girl he found here, he decides he 100% needs to find him so he can rip him a new one for ignoring him as of late.
Dean laughs, "ha ha. Funny. No, I don't know many kids. But I treat her like my own child though. I'll give anyone hell who messes with her."
Alastair looks at Castiel's dress, "why is the fag wearing a dress?" Dean doesn't know what that word means in that sentence, nor does Castiel, but the manner he speaks it with makes his stomach turn. The only time he's heard that word is when uncle Bobby was smoking on the porch and asked John for a fag. Is he saying Castiel is a cigarette? That's quite an odd statement.
Before Dean can finish, Castiel's arms wrap around Dean's neck, “I love you, too. The moment I saw you I felt lost. I don't care if we've been together for two weeks- I already know I love you.” Castiel smiles with watery eyes, “I was scared to tell you that. I thought you'd laugh and tell me I was just a fling or something.”
John scoffs, “what makes you think that?” By the look Dean gives him John folds and smirks, “I once wrote Mary a poem. Read it in front of all of her friends. They all made fun of me and it was probably the worst poem ever written. But obviously she liked it enough to stick it out.” Dean and John share a few more looks and then John asks Dean about going inside and asking Mary if they want to order lunch that he can go pick up.
Castiel slowly slides in the rest of his fingers farther and holds waiting for Dean to give him the go on sign. Which mainly consists of Dean trying to hold back desperate sharp hisses. “Don't be a tease, Cas. Come on, yo're not going to break me.”
“I promise.” Cas answers, yet feels terrified. He needs to see Dean say it. He needs to see Dean look him in the eye and say that he’s not interested. That Castiel being in love with him is pushing him away. He needs to see this so Cas can stop hoping in the back of his mind that anything could ever come of the two. “Can you please just look at me?”
Castiel twines his hands into Deans and shakes Charlie's hand followed with a small curtsy, “it's nice to meet you. I'm Castiel.” Charlie raises her eyebrow at Dean and looks between the two of them.
Dean finds Cas and Charlie. Charlie is too busy talking to one of the female bartenders and Cas is sitting on one of the sofas by the bar. “Hi, Dean.” Dean plops down next to Cas on drunk legs and lays his head on Castiel’s shoulder.
Castiel wipes the tears from his face, looking at his best friend stare down the older boy. Dean isn’t going to let anyone make Cas look so upset. Ever. Over his dead body.
Dean scoots out after him and rolls his eyes at the group. "You just lost the coolest member."
Somehow his parents; John typically, was never bothered by Sam’s ‘feminine side’ (John's words, not Deans). He was always able to cry. And when Sam wanted Polly Pockets for his birthday they didn’t blink. But when Dean asked for a Bratz Doll or a Barbie Dream House- John had a look of despair. Dean knew then that he didn’t want to make his dad look like that again. So he asked for GI Joe’s and Western movies and switched his Halloween dresses and tiaras for superhero capes and army jackets.
Dean moans through each cheesy bite and keeps thanking Cas for his sacrifice. Going off Castiel’s smiles- he at least doesn’t feel like a complete dick from keeping Cas from a good meal. Despite how healthy it looks- Castiel looks content and that’s what matters.
When he thinks about that, Dean mentally hits himself for that one. It's not like he asked him on a date, there's no reason this man would feel rejected.
Cas laughs and recalls Dean and his first time meeting.
Castiel grins and stands up, hugging Claire and kissing her head. "I'll be right back out. I'll rinse off quick." Claire nods and strolls over to the pantry, pulling out a bowl and cereal.
Their teacher walks in, smiling wide like nothing happened and greets all the students with his typical charming smile. “How’s everyone’s day going?” No one says anything. The entire class is holding their breath. Obviously, the news traveled fast- that Becky can’t keep her mouth shut. “Well my day has been… let’s just say it’s been an awakening.” He smirks, “did you guys know, I’m currently romantically seeing Mr. Lafitte?” He yells out, “hey, Benny! Wanna come explain to the kiddos our love story?” Benny strolls in and pulls him into a side hug, he’s trying his best to bat his eyes but his lip twitches from holding in a laugh. Dean grins. “Let’s talk about teachers. Something about teachers that a lot of us don’t realize is that we actually have our own lives outside of school. Crazy right?” He brushes shoulders with Benny and goes on, “so, as a lot of you are unaware, Benny has been married to my good friend Lisa for seven years. But obviously, what we,” he points out between Benny and himself, “what we have, it was too real. Marriages be damned!”
Claire blushes. She uses air quotes and says “totz in love.”
junior year college.
Claire bites her lip, “oh god. What if Mr. W finds out it was us? We were the ones who asked her to vote originally. She said she didn’t want to participate so we moved on but… oh god. She can’t keep a secret.”
Dean quickly paces to the bathroom and let's the sink water drizzle in a small stream and he quickly cleans his face off and he swishes a cup full of Castiel's mouth wash. He would like to think he's doing Cas a favor here. Luckily, he can handle high amounts of liquor and not be completely gross the next day.
Ash shrugs and says that he thinks he went upstairs.
Dean rubs his forehead, grabbing the salt and pepper shakers from the stoves ledge. "Sure thing, bud." He can tell Emma notices his annoyance when she looks down at her food and starts to hum. "I'm fine, really. I love when you stay over here. I just get mad when your mom does this. You should just live over here and when she doesn't cancel her weeks and has a clear schedule, she can get you." Emma shovels her eggs into her mouth.
Castiel panics when Dean gives him the keys to the boat. “I'm not leaving without you, so either you come with me now and have some fun or we go back to the beach and I'm not going to give out any kisses.” Dean licks his lips bringing them closer to Castiel's mouth, “come on, Cas. The Cabin Boy doesn't want to be alone.”
Dean huffs, “damn. And I thought dating a dude would be easier than a girl.”
Castiel smirks and starts strolling off to meet up with the group.
Emma groans, as flattening her hair on her head. "Dad, we need to leave. If we're late, the bus is leaving without us."
Dean gleefully states, “uh, have you seen her? She’s probably the prettiest girl in our grade. Duh.”
It’s not like Cas and Dean weren’t physical. They loved holding each other in hugs and slept in the same beds for their whole childhood and much of their early adulthood, still. They held hands on occasion and constantly would find a way to stand as close as possible to the other. But nothing has ever been like this. Dean’s never been so purposeful in gripping Castiel’s hips or squeezing his ass. Cas has never been so breathless from grinding his groin against Dean’s and he’s definitely never sucked on Dean’s throat like his life depended on the act itself.
Despite his hesitation to try either- he gives in when Cas bats his eyes at Dean. And if Dean couldn’t say no before- the eyeliner is adding far more inabilities to refuse anything Cas asks him. Even when they order- Dean tries his best to not look off put.
Claire goes to the GSA table and Max and Stacy are blushing and holding hands. They both look at each other and say their opinion. They agree that they are totz in love and happily write their responses down. Eliot; after a long battle of asking questions and thinking of scenarios, also chooses the same.
That night they didn’t want to stop holding each other. Ever. But after Dean’s eighth missed call, the two groaned, pulling away. Mary and Naomi both made calls to Dean. When Dean called Mary back, the two were together over his FaceTime call and they sang happy birthday to him. Dean felt bad for ignoring so many of their calls but not for long. Naomi gave Dean a curious look and then Mary caught on quickly. “Where’s Cas?”
Castiel wakes up to his boyfriend clinging to his chest and letting snores out. Cas tries to stretch as quietly and slowly as possible so he doesn’t wake him up. He looks over to Crowley's bed and sees that the Brit is already up and out. The guy sleeps like a rock and then gets up early every morning, it’s strange, really.
Mary must have filled John in because he sees Dean and murmurs a sorry towards him. When Dean shrugs, John pats him on the shoulder and sighs. Not saying any more.
“Hey!” He hears a loud but comforting voice sneak up. A man in a long tan trench coat rushes towards him. Is this a moment he should be running, because come on, trench coats are sketchy as hell. “Oh- sorry. I hope I didn't frighten you. My name is Castiel, I was driving by and felt bad. You looked really cold.”
Instead of letting guilt take his entire mind and body, he decides to reach out to someone. The school’s student run GSA (Gay Straight Alliance) has to have answers for him. Some kind of opinion on the situation. Maybe they’ll be mad and tell him he made the worst mistake. Or maybe they’ll help him heal.
A good ten minutes rolls by and the door creaks. "Dean, are you okay? Are you sick?" Castiel knocks on the closed stall door. Thankful he knows it's Dean because no one else is in the bathroom but the two of them.
“And remember, I’m forgiving you for this one.” Claire smiles and turns and walks the other way.
Things get way more complicated when Hannah spins and the bottle lands on Cassie. Hannah and Cassie laugh and Amara steps in to say Hannah can just spin again. But Cole, always Cole, stops them. “No the rules are pretty straight forward.”
John smiles, “I know I have a lot to learn about you, Dean, but I know you’re never one to just give up on something because it’s too hard.”
Claire mumbles, "it'd be better if we just ate alone so we can all talk." Castiel laughs and pats her on the head. "Sorry," she whispers.
Dean grins, pulling on the condom and coating it with a hand full of lube. "I'm kind of rusty-" Dean laughs, kissing Castiel's chest. Castiel shakes his head, buckling his hips up.
Dean orgasms and feels his own come filling up inside his boyfriend. He listens for Castiel’s scream as his hand and the sheets underneath them are coated with Castiel’s spunk.
Castiel lays down in the front open area of the boat. Although this boat may not be too big, it is roomy enough for the two. Dean's knee slots between Castiel's thighs and he feels fingernails squeeze against his shoulders bringing his down. “This is beautiful,” Cas pants.
The bus takes off shortly after. Castiel feels excited for something. What it is, he's not sure. Is it the fact that Claire hasn't broken into tears once today? Is it the enjoyable memories of past museum trips he's been on? Or is it even the man sitting next to him who makes him feel tingly in all the right places. Castiel groans softly when he feels Dean's hand grip onto his thigh.
Dean shrugs, "Emma do you want to go?" Emma's face says it all. She hugs her arms around Dean and then springs off, hugging Alex and Krissy.
Dean laughs through a mouthful, "I'm an Aquarius. I do like long walks on the beach."
Castiel stares at his bowlegs, quickening in pace as he follows his daughter. At least he's not the only man here. That's refreshing. He's never had a child of his own so he's never had to think about the annoying qualities of the PTA moms gossip- until today. What concern is it to them if this women, Charlie, is engaged to another women? Apparently responding with, "that's amazing," isn't the response they were hoping for.
So when Cas announced to his family that he would not have a plus one- no one tried to push for an answer. Dean, obviously, heard all about it and threatened to go beat up the guy if he came near Cas again.
Dean feels his belly run warm and he grips his hands into Castiel's hips.
Dean gasps, “Dude, you’re not a virgin anymore?”
She doesn’t answer but she puts her arms out in ask of hugging and Cas gives in and let’s her squeal into the hug.
Dean laughs and brings his hands back to the side of his chair, "don't get me going on that. I'm the world's proudest brother and I don't want to bore you half to death about him." Dean can't help but smile. His little brother has that affect; sure he can be a bitch, but Dean wouldn't know what to do if he ever lost him. "Are you close with your family?"
Between the saliva and precome, Cas is able to fuck into Dean slowly. Dean, ever the brat, tells Cas he’s not so sure he’ll be able to come again. Which only drives Cas to fuck harder. He pounds Dean against the wall and brackets his body and takes his time running his hands up and down Dean’s sides and reaching between the wall and Dean's front to grip Dean’s dick to jerk as his come pumps into his boyfriend.
"Oh don't worry, I am." Cas watches Dean’s face fluster over. His freckles are intriguing. Castiel took a art class last week, he worked with splatter paint. And no matter how beautiful everyone's work turned out, they are nothing compared to the small dots on this man's face.
Cas bites his lip and gulps. “Eventually though… It just bothered me. I’d see girls try and flirt with him and even though he didn’t do it back it felt wrong. He didn’t tell anyone he was dating me; or dating anyone for that matter, or that he loved someone already. He’d just let it happen. We started arguing more. Our biggest fight was when I asked him if he’d want to meet my family. He didn’t say no but his answer definitely wasn’t yes. He got all weird so I asked him when he’d be comfortable telling people. I told him I wanted to tell my family and friends and he said it was too risky since Sam could find out online. We didn’t talk for a week but he made it up to me. Said he’d tell his parents over spring break and I was happy again. And then back from break, he said he couldn’t do it. But I felt bad for him and tried to understand and wait but… Meg. It kills me. I can’t kiss him or hold his hand in public. I can’t tell the girls who hang all over him that he’s taken. It just got to me and I couldn’t do it.”
Dean laughs to himself and sits outside the door for another few minutes before he knocks again. This time a different voice answers and Dean feels his stomach drop inside his body. “Shit. Benny, we should just stop.”
He doesn't realize how long he has spent on thinking about Claire, until she's fully dressed in front of him. Hair pulled out of her face in a tight braid. She's wearing a long sleeve black t shirt and a pair of blue jeans. "You going to get ready?"
After visiting a few houses, the boys walk back down to the sidewalk and find Mary at the curb chatting with another woman, Ruby, who's holding her son. "Oh! Here, Sammy can share his wagon. You shouldn't have to carry him all night!"
With her, he sees him. Dean doesn’t look scared or embarrassed or upset. When Lisa notices Anna, she interrupts Dean and points his face in Castiel’s direction. His face lights up and Cas can’t help but smile. What the hell is happening?
Castiel gives in and hurries past Dean onto the boat. “Did they tell you how to drive this thing?” Dean quickly runs to follow him.
Dean thinks he's in control. Everything happening is because Castiel is following his lead. But he knows he is terribly wrong when Castiel slides his cold hands under the hem of Dean's shirt. Slowly rubbing his way up his chest. Dean feels his knees wobble and Castiel takes his moment to bring one leg around Dean's torso. So that's how this is going to be.
Castiel pokes at Dean and notices his changed expression and tilts his head. “And where did you go off to? Find yourself a gal to dance? Because I hate to break it to you, but there’s a good chance she was just hoping for the cash.”
Mr. Milton makes a joke that leaves Mr. Winchester cackling and swatting at his arm, “oh you get outta here, man. Shoo now.” Mr. Winchester turns back to the class and claps his hands loudly. “Before being rudely interrupted for expo markers;” he yells loud enough for Mr. Milton to hear on his way out, “we were going to start our presentations. Claire, Alex, Krissy? Get on up here and blow me away with some Audre Lorde research.”
His mother and father were strict, but also kind. They wanted to help people. Castiel and Jimmy were their only kids, but they took in several people off of the streets and gave them a home. That's admirable.
Castiel lets out a heavy breath and smiles through his tears. “Inias was my boyfriend. We broke up.”
But as I said, I do not know details of your relationship. So do as you want with that advice. And honestly, he might feel betrayed and hurt. But what happens next could be good for him. He may stay closed off for some time, but I think having the experience and knowing how great it could be- it’ll help him in the long run.”
Cas laughs with Dean and states, “well Meg probably broke up with me, too.”
The boy's sick smile curves up. His voice is deep and reminds Dean of something called a ‘hick.’ Which he only knows of because of the baseball game Mary took them to. His southern drawl laughs, "I don't need to do anything, freak." Dean frowns and grabs Castiel's hand. No way is he arguing with this older boy about candy. Besides, they’ve been to enough houses by now. Castiel can share his.
“Aaron?” Dean looks up at the guy.
Dean stretches Castiel open with wet fingers, taking his time to slide in farther, trying to do it as gently as he can. Castiel moans when Dean's finger scratches against his prostate. "Dean!" Castiel's hair is a sloppy mess, falling in front of his eyes. "Dean," Castiel chants again.
Mary looks confused by the terms but nods along. “Did you really think we would care?”
Cas starts rummaging through his dresser, pulling out random articles of clothing and handing them to Dean. “Please. Whatever I miss, I’ll come give them to you, by your door.” Even with Dean clenching his clumped clothing ball he doesn’t move. They stare at each other for what feels like years but is probably only seconds. “You have to go, Dean. Now. You’re killing me… plea-" Cas begs. He closes his eyes to avoid looking at Dean’s heartbroken face for a second longer.
Castiel slowly walks over to Dean, so he's standing in front of him. "Give me a hint."
Castiel raises his voice a note higher and claps his hands together loudly. "Hey, Claire, do you think you could go rally up the rest of the Fantastic Four for me?" Claire stares at Cas and nods, she blocks the sun from her eyes, trying to spot out the others.
He watches Meg as she focuses on another guy zoning in on her. She winks at the two boys and waves to them, pulling away from their three way dance and greeting the new guy.
Krissy shakes her head. “Nah- don’t think so. I think Mr. Lafitte is gay, though.”
The moans from Dean are like a religious experience. Church bells could never sound as pleasing as the chimes Dean can make. His eyes remind him of playing outside in the spring. They are as bright as stars at night, but the green is warm and welcoming. When new fresh grass begins to grow, the shades must transfer into his eyes. His mouth's shape is plump. Castiel loves his mouth and every last wonder Dean could do with it. And his freckles. The Galaxy that is splattered across his face is intriguing. He could spend days counting each freckle. And maybe one day he will be able to.
Castiel is still thankful for Dean’s ask one day before his date about what clothes made him look best. Sure, Dean wasn’t dressing for Cas, but Cas got to tell his best friend some of the clothes that make him in the image of every wet dream Cas has ever had.
Dean almost laughs at that. "No wife. Definitely not. Never been married. And I'm not seeing anyone."
Dean doesn’t want to go back to his dorm room and mope about Cas while being alone. He’s trying to start new. Rebuild his self worth so he can have enough courage to get Castiel back in his life. He knows Cas deserves a loving, patient and present boyfriend. And he is so close to gaining the confidence back in being present for him. This time in the right way. Being able to show him off to his friends and meet Castiels. Be able to spend holidays with each other’s families. Hold his hand when they go walking on campus and not purposefully leave a gap between them so no one suspects him.
Dean laughs along with Cas and they talk about Dean’s blowjob experience some more before Cas motions for Dean to join him in bed so they can get actual sleep.
Cas looks taken back and squints, “are you really asking me why I’d have sex with someone I didn’t like? Really? You- of all people.” Castiel’s expressions turn from embarrassed and unsure to a look of fury Dean hardly ever sees. “You fuck some new girl every other week, Dean! But God forbid I sleep with someone who I actually like being around. It’s not like I’m swimming in options of guys willing to fuck another guy! Benny’s an easy choice because he’s already my friend and we both aren’t interested like that. I can screw and be screwed by whoever I choose! You don’t have a say over that!” He throws his hands up when Dean tries to interrupt. “Just stop. I do everything for you, Dean! I always come when you call. You’re always the first person I’d run to. But I can’t fucking run to you for this! I would have- if I ever thought I could, but we both know that’s never going to happen!”
Dean watches Castiel's face, obviously worried that Dean won't agree. He is Castiel’s first best friend. Dean is his only friend. What's he going to do if Dean says no? Dean ruffles Castiel's dark hair and looks at his best friend’s bed head mess. "Yes, now he is."
The whole room is far quieter than Dean would have liked. Cassie squeezes her hand out of Dean’s grip and excuses herself. Maybe he should chase after her to the bathroom, but he doesn't. He can’t stop looking at Cas. Thankfully Hannah and Amara run after Cassie and the five boys are left sitting in a circle.
Max laughs, “thinking about your ex as you rebound? It’s ok. I get it… not the most rewarding of experiences, but obviously I can’t compare right now.” Cas nods sadly and wipes a tear that he didn’t know was even there. “What’d the jerk do? If you need me to make him jealous, let me know. I’ll just leave out the part about you screaming his name.”
Dean laughs, “I have more to offer than just fixing cars and being a man! And I don’t care who all I can offer that to, because I don’t care about any of them. I love him, dad. I’m sorry this is such a surprise.”
Castiel steps closer to Dean and puts his hand on his shoulder, "Dean, if something's wrong you can tell me. I need to know if you need help with anything or who to even go to to get that help."
Dean laughs nervously and pats Emma's head, "I'll be back, I'm going to get a drink of water from the fountain." Thankfully Cas doesn't mind staying back letting the girls continue eating alongside him.
Their friends arrive before the party starts in full swing. Benny showed up first. And it made Dean happy because Benny is one of the few friends he has that Cas also genuinely gets along with. The three of them are laughing as they play air hockey until Inias and Cole show up relatively close together. Cas breaks to talk with Inias and eat snacks, so Cole takes over Castiel’s place at the air hockey table.
He’s going on and on. Which halts Dean’s thoughts. Now that Dean thinks of it, he’s done most of the talking tonight. He stops mid sentence and shakes his head, “jeez, I don’t want to be the only one talking up a storm. Stop me at any point, man. I don’t mean to,”
Krissy crosses her arms, "he won't let me get the tiger." She pouts her lip hoping for a sympathy vote. Castiel squats down onto the ground in front of her and waves Dean away with the other three.
Dean feels like his heart is snapping and he grabs Castiel’s hands as he tries to run back into the bathroom and hide. “I’m sorry. Cas, wait.”
Castiel purrs “Dean Winchester,” until he gets a confident feeling of his name. “Castiel Novak.”
Cas laughs at her bubbly outbursts and introduces himself with the same identifiers to describe himself. She holds her hand up in what Cas recognizes as the Vulcan Salute (something Dean has done often enough around him). “I actually came here to talk to someone? Confide in them? I don’t really know what you guys do… so maybe this is dumb?”
Castiel looks at his bow legs that quickly make their way to the bathroom in the back.
Castiel coughs and walks over moving the pictures into a box. “No. Meg and I split up a couple years ago. We met in college and she was my first of a lot of things. But it was all wrong.” Castiel looks at the picture another time and looks like he's going to be sick. “I'm gay. It just wasn't fair to her.”
Dean pulls a pair of grey sweat pants over a pair of bright orange boxer briefs. “Hey. I was thinking- maybe you and I could get something to eat today. If you want.”
Maybe Dean saw his real emotions that crept through Castiel’s expression. Now Dean’s acting weird because he knows how Cas feels. Is he trying to let him down softly? Cas finishes rinsing his hair and body and then gets out of the shower.
Dean snorts and brushes his palm against Castiel's cheek. “We just had sex and you didn't need it then.” Dean traces his fingertips over Castiel's mouth, “but for you, I'd do anything. It's Winchester. You?”
Their high school years were over and Dean spent the summer working at his Grandpa Campbell’s hunting and outdoor gear store and Cas spent his working at a movie theatre. And he totally didn’t let Dean in for free every time. No way.
Alex and Claire both look at one another and roll their eyes, “yeah, how would you know, Krissy?” Krissy laughs and watches as Mr. Winchester pulls out a package of expo markers, handing Mr. Milton another one.
Cas pulls back. Wait, what?
It's not like Dean wanted to spend his day with a bunch of whiny immature fourth graders. He didn't want to go out with a ton of the class moms on chaperone. He has no need to hear the ramblings of all of their rumors about the other parents failing marriages. But when your one night stand turns into a child, it doesn't matter what you want. Because the kid will turn out to be everything and the only thing you need.
Cas tries to remember his own reaction to seeing those photos. He doesn’t know how he looked in the moment, but he does remember thinking about how he wished Dean and he had better timing. How he wished throughout everything they went through, that they had a chance. Because Dean would always be Castiel’s first kiss and crush and love.
"Dean. Oh god. Dean. Dean," he hears chanting from the room next door. Soft grunts of sexual bliss fill Dean's mind and he feels his dick twitch in his jeans. Would Castiel be having sex with a guy named Dean. Maybe it's just a coincidence. But Dean's a light enough sleeper to hear a door open and close. From what he recalls, no one else came or left this house. Maybe Castiel wants this as much as Dean does and didn't know how to ask. He's having to get himself off. As pleasing as that sounds visually to Dean, it also makes him feel motive. Castiel can't be jerking off calling his name and then be repulsed if Dean walks in.
Dean panics and sees Castiel facing a taller boy with dirty blonde hair. Dean looks at Mary in panic, still walking ahead, chatting, and instead goes to run and get Castiel back. When Dean catches up to him, he sees tears in the corners of Castiel's eyes. "What's wrong, Cas?" Dean says grabbing his hand.
Shit.
Castiel moans rutting up against Dean and Dean lets Castiel grip his nails into his shoulder blades. Dean looks down at Cas, "fuck. The lube is all inside." Castiel frowns, nipping against Dean's neck. Dean kisses Castiel's forehead and backs up. "Wait, hold up."
Cas doesn’t answer and Dean scoffs, “you just gonna ignore me? Real mature.”
He pulls out of Cassie's hold. “It was actually a gift. From my boyfriend. Well, ex boyfriend. But yeah.” He looks away from Cassie’s annoyed expression, “Sorry Lis, kinda want to hold onto this one. Hoping he might take me back.”
Emma points to Alex and smirks, "dad I'm going to go to. Alex was telling me about her pet iguana." Dean grins at Cas and points.
It’s not actually that bad. It’s not like Cas is disrespectful of their shared space and the guy isn’t always sleeping over. But every time Castiel’s phone rings Dean gets sick to his stomach. It’s always Balthazar this and that. Dean’s over it.
Dean feels like he's a ticking bomb. Castiel’s scruff looks so nice in the dim room. “You- you have nice eyes,” Dean stammers.
Meg sets them down and swats Balthazar’s hand when he goes to dive in for a shot. “Hey- you get one. The rest are for Clarence and I to get shit faced. We do not have dates to impress.” She earns herself a glare but Balthazar throws back a shot regardless and smiles as he waves to a woman walking up to them with a tall man next to her.
Claire looks shocked, “what was I?”
“I guess I’ll act like one if I’m being fucked like one.” He laughs and swats what Dean can only imagine is Benny’s own flesh. What part? He doesn’t want to know. “Come on, I promised Dean I’d be back downstairs by midnight so we can celebrate.”
Cas laughs. Maybe that wasn’t the right choice but he can’t hold it back. His laugh doesn’t stop for a good minute and Dean looks ready to fucking sob and that’s when it hits Cas. Dean was being honest and he’s not having some weird fever dream. Cas grabs Dean's hands and pulls on him so Dean will glance back up at Cas.
After he came, he doesn't pull out at first. He lays his head down onto Dean's chest and let's Dean suck onto his neck.
Cas only invited one of his most recent friends, Inias. Said he didn’t need to ask anyone since Dean was already going to be there, but he’d still invite someone just so his mom wouldn’t lecture him about branching out and socializing.
Dean is taken back and his mouth moves like a fish out of water. John pats his shoulder and sighs. “It wasn’t a surprise. I just tried to change you.” He actually looks like he has sorrow in his eyes, “when you were six, you and the neighbor boy with that mullet would hold hands and I asked you why you held hands and you said he was your husband. I can’t remember his name.”
Krissy clenches her jaw. "My mom is dead." Fuck. Castiel sees her eyes glass over with a sheet of water.
Dean blurts, “I got a blowjob.”
Charlie struts over and winks at Dean, “is that him?” Dean licks his lip and nods, not once letting his eye contact with Cas fade until he is standing by his side.
Dean coughs, “Cas, I have to hit the road again today. I don't want to leave you, but I have a job. I have to go back eventually.”
Dean should care that he’s sobbing in the driveway with all his neighbors around to see out their front windows. But he doesn’t. Mary walks him into the house as Sam launches himself at Dean. Despite the giant being in his sophomore year, he’s never stopped being affectionate with Dean.
The rest of their sophomore year passed quickly. Dean and Cas barely leave each other’s sides. Not like it was much different than before they got together, but Jo did mention on a constant occasion that “you two make me want to vomit from how cute you are.” While Charlie would just happily watch and tell them how happy she was to finally see them together.
“Sorry about that. What can I help you with?”
It’s not a long lasting kiss but he can feel the passion behind it. Cas looks at Dean and smiles and the two don’t talk about it on their way back home.
Meg smiles along and Cas keeps going, knowing she’d stop him if any questions came up. “We’d do all of our projects together and I started studying in his room because his roommate was always out. By the end of the semester I was at his dorm and his roommate said he had to go to the library for a few hours and invited us, but Dean said ‘no thanks,’ and as soon as the guy left he just gave me this look. I don’t know how to describe it but it was… I felt special. And he kissed me. Said he wanted to do it from the first time he saw me.
“Look, I didn’t realize how painful I made it for him. I thought he was content with what we had and I know I’m a prick for thinking that. But I was scared. And yeah, I didn’t know what my family would do and it freaked me out- but I also didn’t want to admit it to myself. I admitted to myself that I loved him and that I was in love with a man and that I wanted a future with him. But I still felt scared. Because I didn’t know myself. I was scared of myself. If I admitted it to other people… I didn’t know how to be myself anymore because I thought everything I grew up doing was all I had. But I realize I’m more than stupid expectations. The things I liked when I was ten could change and the things others told me to like- I didn’t have to. I get it now and I know it’s like, a little too late. But I’m trying.”
Castiel looks mortified. As if two consenting adults should feel ashamed of this. Dean slowly rubs himself against Castiel's erection and nods, letting him know he is okay with this. With all of it.
"Deano!" Gabriel yells with cupped hands. All of the girls are oblivious to the surroundings. They're all pointing at the creepy lungs encased in a sealed glass display. "Feeling better?"
Dean watches Castiel’s confidence and can’t help taking his time to follow behind Cas as he gets a good look at his boyfriend. “Fuck yeah,” he whispers in response to no one in particular.
Home never felt so exciting and peaceful until he found it with in Dean. “I would love to Dean.”
Castiel sips more of his water, "that's really sweet. I wouldn't of pegged you to be a family man." He watches Dean's eyes glass over with fear. Maybe sadness. Maybe both. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say something wrong."
When Claire starts pacing away, Dean pats Emma's back, "you can go on and help too."
Cas sits down over Dean’s waist and plays with his nipples. Dean rolls his hips upwards trying to meet skin.
Mary quickly steps in and picks up Sam from the ground. "No, Dean, skirts are for anyone.” Dean doesn’t look convinced so she goes on, “Some girls feel happy because it makes them feel cute. But there’s some girls who would rather not wear them. The same goes for boys- you all can wear them if you want. Besides, don't you think Cas looks cute?"
When they walk out Dean grins at Cas. "You bought her the fucking tiger didn't you?" Castiel bites his lip and hides the bag behind his back.
Krissy nods her head "as long as I call to the house."
Castiel jumps back from the running stamped of children and Dean laughs at him.
Castiel goes along with the joke but it’s definitely not his stylist assistance that makes the girls (and boys) swoon over him. Deans just the perfect balance of kind, funny, smart, nerdy, creative, sporty and hot. So hot.
Castiel’s favorite game to play is monster hunters. Dean and he have been playing this game since they first heard about ghosts in first grade and they ran with the idea. Eventually, they added other spooky creatures and Cas even declared himself as an 'Angel of the Lord.' Dean laughed super hard at him for that line but it never fails to make Castiel happy.
Dean grabs a bag of pasta from the cupboard and waves it at Cas. "Spaghetti, sound good? I make a mean sauce."
When they get up to their floor, they walk past a group of girls who wave blushing at them. But neither pay any of them attention while Cas slams Dean against the front of their door. Dean’s fumbling with the keys and gasping as Cas rocks his body against Dean’s ass. “I’ll tie you up and tease you until you’re screaming if you don’t get this damn door open.”
It's a weird feeling to watch your own father dedicate his life to his other family. Not once did he come see Dean's teachers or watch his cheer competitions. But that's not what bothered him, what truly did was seeing Sammy's face drop into a frown every time it was game day and their dad forgot to drive over. Those moments cut like blades. That's when Dean decided to never let Sam go a day without praise. Either it be, "good job Sam! You went to the potty," or "I'm so proud of you. Get your schoolwork done. You could go far enough- maybe even go to Stanford." Which he indeed did.
Having that talk definitely gave him a new perspective and he can’t see girls making out as something erotic. Because Charlie’s right. And then he wondered if Cas ever felt like that with girls staring at him and his different dates.
Castiel's tongue works in different motions and different depths. When Dean relaxes to a certain motion, Castiel picks up the pace to hear more lusting moans erupt out of this man. Dean's cock is stiff against his chest, yet he nearly forgot its twitching want until Castiel reaches a hand up and begins to stroke him.
In a few tries, he reaches the bottom and rests his nose against Castiel's skin. He palms his hands over Castiel's balls and listens to the choir of Castiel's moans. “Dean- I need to-”
Dean looks pained by the idea of moving before Cas states, “maybe I’ll let you ride me tomorrow morning.” Although it intrigues Dean he still grunts not moving. “Or maybe I’ll try tying you to the headboard and eating you out until you beg.” Dean sits up at that and Cas smirks, “but only good boys deserve that. So I guess I’ll go shower on my lonesome…”
Cas let’s Dean into the bathroom and explains the kiss with Meg and how he felt. Dean listens and responds, “well it was probably her. Maybe she sucks at kissing. You did fine with me, so it can’t be your fault.” Cas feels a bit of pride knowing his kiss with Dean didn’t make Dean feel this strong sickness like he had shared with Meg.
Castiel smiles, "take it away Winchester."
Dean makes a joke; even as he’s a trembling mess, asking if Cas forgot what to do with his dick and Cas takes no time in proving Dean wrong. So wrong. Cas sucks Dean’s cock so confidently. Doesn’t show any sign of second guess as he deep throats around Dean’s length and uses his other hand to reach around to Dean’s ass, which he fingers open as continuing to bring Dean to the edge with his mouth.
Before Dean begins, he sucks Castiel's thighs. Tens of bruises are forming into shades of red and purple. Castiel is a canvas and Dean's mouth is the paintbrush.
He has thoughts swimming in his head but snaps back out of it when he hears Cas all but scream through his orgasm.
Dean nods, “what one were you?”
Dean rests his tongue against Castiel's, tasting a linger of orange juice and honey toast. “Cas-” Dean smiles into a soft grunt when he feels Castiel's finger travel to his waistband pulling his pants with a strong tug. His dick twitches in his underwear, until Castiel yanks them down to his knees. Dean wraps one arm onto his shoulder and palms his free hand against the front of Castiel's jeans. Castiel smirks and rolls off of Dean, stretching his body and unbuckling his belt.
If anyone truly saw Dean this last month, he wonders what they would see. Because he doesn’t understand how anyone would think he was anything but empty.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel goes into a lecture about how 'sex is not just penetration. Hand jobs, fellatio, fingering and cunniligus all count.'
Cas starts to fuck back against Dean automatically. And Dean wants to give his boyfriend everything he wants. He fucks back twice as hard and Castiel’s body crumbles underneath. His elbows dropping fast so he’s no longer on all fours, but he ass is in the air for Dean to fuck.
Castiel shakes his head. “Just stop making it harder, Dean, please. I love you, I just can’t do this. It’s hurting me. You are hurting me.”
He hears someone at the door, knocking and banging his hands up and down the door. He hears Alfie mumble in his sleep and he whispers, “I’ll be back,” to him. He opens the door, standing in his underwear to Dean holding a miniature bumble bee cake with the words “happy bee-day.” Cas pulls Dean into his room and hugs him, after putting the cake down on his desk.
When they’re all totally invested in their silent dinner, John speaks out. “Tell us about how school is going.”
Before he finishes Meg says “I know. I won’t say anything.”
So instead Dean gets to his room and meets his roommate, a shy guy, Aaron. And Cas meets his assigned roommate. He happens to be roomed with an arrogant British guy named Fergus. Who wants to go by ‘Crowley,’ like it’s so much better than Fergus.
Crazy feelings got me reeling
She blushes and shrugs, “I mean… I was wondering if you’d like to? And to go with me to the dance? As my boyfriend.”
Dean whispers along with Cas, “3… 2… 1…”
Castiel swallows down a handful of dry Cheerios and a glass of tap water. He stretches out on the short couch in the tiny front room. He really needs to head back over to Jimmy and Amelia's old place. Sell a few things to save up for a real house. Somewhere where he can support Claire. A grubby old apartment isn't a fit for a growing kid.
"Dad! Do you see how big that bone is!" Emma is nearly screeching from the opposite side of the dinosaur exhibit. All three girls run after her and Dean puts a check mark next to dinosaur exhibit. So far they've only gone to three sections of the museum. Dinosaurs, mythical creatures, and rocks. Which, Dean isn't complaining. They really are cool.
“You know how you girls were at Jody’s last night? Well, Castiel came over and we had a sleepover. We watched movies, ate food, did some fun stuff. I shared my pajamas.” Which none of that was a lie. They did eat and watch a movie. And they defiantly did some fun stuff.
Castiel positions himself to the right angle so it is both comfortable for Dean and him. He slowly sinks into Dean. Now it's not only Dean who is a whining mess. “Dean. Dean you are- oh Dean.”
Old Dean would have been embarrassed. He reminds himself that the new Dean doesn’t have to feel shame over things he loves. “Hey, don’t knock on Taylor. She’s incredible.”
Before the door is fully opened, Dean is already undoing his pants and raising his arms up so Cas can get his shirt off of him. He stands there in his underwear as the door slams behind them and Cas at least has the sense to lock the door once they’re in.
Claire runs over when she turns around to see the two. "You have to look at this! It looks so gross!" She tugs at Castiel's arms and he quickly follows behind her so his arm isn't ripped off.
Dean laughs and shakes his head, "I-uh-" he smiles again. "My little brother, Sam, he and Gabe are dating. I like teasing him about it." Dean licks his tongue over his lips, "I'm not a complete jerk, sorry if that came off that way. It's just a family thing. Do you have-"
Dean doesn’t try to correct Aaron in thinking he came here to meet a guy. Doesn’t say no when Aaron asks to dance. And doesn’t say no when Aaron asks if Dean wants to go to the bathroom.
He and Cassie are holding hands and he tries to argue against the game with, 'well some of us actually have a relationship,' but Cole somehow convinces everyone to sit down despite that.
Dean looks between his parents and brother and lowers his voice to respond. “I uh- I like women still, I just like men more. Maybe. Or at least I loved Cas more.”
Dean looks at his father in the doorway and shrugs, standing to meet him. John walks to the garage. John went to bed early after last night's dinner and hasn’t whispered a single word in Dean’s direction until now. And it’s about a fucking car? Of course. Fix a car and remind me you’re still a man. Typical. Dean scoffs at his own thoughts. Despite it all, he follows his dad out.
Everything seems to be going smoothly until the girls show up. Cassie, Amara, and Hannah walk down the stairs and Cassie immediately goes in to kiss Dean. Cole gives him some whoops and smacks Dean’s shoulder for his PDA. Hannah and Amara; Cassie's friends, are quiet but they both try to talk some with Benny and Cole as Dean and Cassie are busy getting back to making out sloppily to the side.
“They’re both straight. I heard them both talking about wanting to get together with Ms. Bradbury.”
Emma and Alex have grown closer also. They have evolved from the iguana talk and now Emma won't stop nagging Dean by yanking onto his jacket sleeve. "Dad! We need to get a pet!" Hell no. Dean raises his eyebrow and shakes his head.
Krissy and Claire start tugging onto his coat asking him if he could hurry up. That's when he blurts out, "I could lick that." Staring at Cas has left him speechless. Dean has no other choice than to stumble his words and point at the ice cream cooler. "Yeah, girls, how about getting some cones?" He realizes the red creeping up Castiel's neck and he smiles. The two watch the girl's race over to line up and Castiel laughs, whispering closer to Dean's ear, "I could go for a giant cone." Dean coughs loudly and feels his eyes widen.
Dean wipes the tears leaking into the corners of Castiel's crows feet. “I hope those are happy tears,” Castiel nods quickly and laughs trying to wrap his head around the reality of this. Dean loves him as much as Cas loves Dean. “I love you, you angel. My angel.”
"Mom loves me." Emma scrunches her nose and sticks her tongue out at Dean. "You're just jealous she has a boyfriend." Emma grins as Dean shakes his head. "You know, if you asked her out on a date, she wouldn't have to have a boyfriend."
Both Ruby and Mary can tell the boys are sad and Mary gives Ruby the ‘look.’ Mary tries to distract the kids with something else and states, “I think we should go home. We have some leftover cookie dough. And I really really need help making them into cookies.”
Dean moans but Cas answers, “yes sir.”
Before Cas realizes what Dean said or what he meant, he sees Dean storm over to where Meg, Lisa, Charlie and Jo are huddled. By the look of it, Lisa said yes and Dean looked back at Cas to give him a thumbs up before waving him over.
In his panic, she puts her face close to his and puckers. Castiel gulps again and pecks her lips and pulls off immediately. She looks ecstatic and whispers, “I love you.”
Cas feels scared. He doesn’t want Dean to leave him. If he’s already freaked out by an idea of Castiel’s love- what would he do when he actually knows.
Castiel and Dean are holding pillow cases in their hands. Mary walks in the front, pulling Sam behind her. She looks back often to make sure Cas and Dean haven't wandered off and to make sure Sam is still okay in the wagon and not trying to climb out. At each curb she wheels them to the side and lifts Sam out, telling Dean to grab his hand and go to the door. She makes sure to remind them of their manners every stop.
Meg nods in concern to Dean's promise but with a hint of hope behind her eyes. “You need to tell your family. Friends. Anyone. Cas might take you back with that speech but I won’t let him.”
Dean is cheering and acting like it’s the best news he’s ever heard and Cas feels entirely calm to this idea. Even as Meg asked him he didn’t feel all too excited. “You should have told me! Dude that’s incredible. I can’t believe you got a girlfriend before me!”
Dean wants to kiss him. Everything inside him is bursting with happiness and excitement. "Tonight?"
(See the end of the chapter for
The phone call to Aaron was awkward as hell. Dean called and asked him if he’d like to be his date to his family's Thanksgiving. He explained that Cas was bringing a date home and his parents asked and he felt obligated to ask someone. Even stressed it enough and told Aaron they weren’t dating because of this- but that he wanted the guy there as a friend. Aaron was ecstatic about the whole deal and probably read too much into the situation, again, but Dean tried his best to lay it out plain and simple.
“Fine.”
Claire sits up quickly and her face pales. “What happened? Do you know what he said?”
When they meet with the other groups of parents, Gabriel scribbles a checkmark next to all of the kids names. He claps his hands together when each of the kids are accounted for. "Guys- go get a tray from the counter and get in line by the back. They're going to give your food out."
Dean frowns at Castiel’s reaction and keeps going; maybe in hope that the more he talks, the more he puts off Castiel’s repulsed response.
Dean doesn’t want to be a creeper and stare the whole time as he gets a lap dance so he wanders off and sits at the bar. He asks for a few shots and slams each back. He feels sufficiently on his way to a good level of drunk and a guy sits down next to him, giving him a drink with a cute umbrella sticking out of it.
Castiel reaches his hands across the table and he holds them in a grip onto Dean's. "I am so sorry. You have your brother, right?" He watches a spark in Dean's mood and he grips back to Castiel's hands.
Dean’s been a crying mess as this last month has proved and he figured he’d be crying now, but instead he feels speechless. He feels like his body lost twenty pounds in the matter of minutes. He feels light. He thinks about his friendship with Ash and the other boys he’s met. How things he forgot or missed could have told him so much about himself. Dean could hardly admit his love of men to himself. And now he has three of the most important people in his life on his side.
The two argued at Castiel’s home for hours and Naomi called Dean’s parents to alert them of their boy's fight. After both boys parents talked them down, and tried to make their own child see the other side of it, the boys made up and Cas gave Dean his final answer of where he wanted to go. With Dean.
He sees an old playboy peeking out from under his bed and rolls his eyes at it. Before he realizes what he’s doing, he shreds the magazine in half and starts tearing at every page until there’s a hill of shredded puzzle pieces. Sam walks in and looks in horror at Dean’s work and gasps. “Dude, what did this girl do?” Dean laughs because if not he’ll scream. He would’ve had the same reaction if it were him looking at anyone else- even though he wouldn’t have said it out loud. But Sam’s not that perceptive to emotions that aren’t his and his crushes right now. High school brain has to be real.
The plan was pretty simple. Cas and Dean would talk to some people and Cas would have some drinks. Dean was hoping to chat with his on and off again ex girlfriend, Anna. Hoping to get a New Years kiss from it. Castiel told Dean he was making a mistake with that one, but when Dean brought up who Castiel’s mystery date was, Cas dropped the subject and changed the topic back to how Dean plans to get Anna back. Again.
Castiel pulls away, nearly breathless and Dean smirks at him, "wow."
When Cas tried to ask Sam about it, Sam just gave him cryptic answers like, “don’t ask stupid questions,” or “you would know if you just let yourself see it.”
Cas climbs off of Dean and climbs onto all fours. “You gonna fuck me?”
Meg looks like she questions herself and her own wording but says, “you broke Cas and I want to ask why. Why couldn't you just… do it for him. He doesn’t think he deserved you or was good enough to make you choose him. And it’s shit to watch as a friend because that guy would give his life for you. And I only just found out the reason for his obnoxious constant happiness this week when I had to see him break down.”
A good few hours creep by before the two of them move a muscle. Dean shifts a lot, telling Castiel he hopes the next time will be have a more comfortable aftermath, because currently his ass feels beat. Castiel drains Deans complaints with gasping breaths as he latches his lips onto Dean's neck yet again.
Dean can’t resist speaking his mind right now. Everything feels like a personal attack. “I tried to be good and like girls and beer and cars and want to talk about fighting, sports, and classic rock but it’s just not me.” He glowers at his father, “and ok, sure, I like some of those things but it’s not all I am. I like cooking, having fruity mixers and riding bikes, I like reality tv and listening to pop music. I really like the color pink and I think I actually look great in it. I hate fighting and I hate going on our hunting trips. I think the animals are cute. When you took me shooting and I shot a rabbit, I hid in the bathroom that night and cried. And I know you don’t want me to have emotions and act girly- but I’m all of these things, okay? I don’t want to keep saying I hate all of these things and acting like I don’t care about them. Me loving a boy shouldn’t make you so disappointed. I know it’s a big surprise but,”
Her eyes widen and she hugs Dean. “I’m so happy for you! Holy shit why didn’t you tell us to just fuck off? Or why didn’t your boyfriend? Jesus, who is it? I need to give them a gift basket.”
Castiel backs himself up to the end of the couch and he grabs Dean's legs, throwing them over his shoulder. Castiel's hands cup Dean's thighs and ass, slowly opening Dean up in front of his face. Deans neglected cock is killing him. He needs to be touched. But when he feels Castiel's mouth so close to his tightening hole, he nearly comes thinking about it.
Dean wants to vomit. But instead of food coming up, words fill his throat and spill out his mouth. “I’m not ever going to find another girl like them because I was dating a boy!” His own words shock him and he pulls back into himself.
Dean feels his heart racing and he can feel breaths of air hit against his face. "Just some guy."
Claire has opened up quite a lot. She and Krissy are locked arm in arm. She's persuaded Krissy to join in on the laughter over Dean's age. Which, yes, he realizes he isn't an old man. But God do children like to point out the facts that he has small creases by his eyes. And that all of his classic lines are way too old for them to understand. Which Castiel laughs softly at each time. Dean at least feels some accomplishment.
Dean raises his hand again and the waiter comes over, “would you two like to try-”
Except for the one time that the two never speak of. The time when Cas left from classes forty minutes earlier than usual and walked in on Dean fucking himself on a pink glittery dildo. The two compared their schedules and wrote them down on a board after that. And promised the other that if they were ever coming back early that they would call and knock before entering their shared space.
He tries to dodge by a guy kicking a soccer ball but trips and slides forward. He feels arms grab him in reaction and pull him up. He blinks at the guy who saved him from falling on his ass and laughs at the awkwardness of the meeting. Max laughs at him and lets him gain balance. “Where are you heading so fast?”
Cas stares at Dean on the verge of tears and Dean sighs. “I’m sorry. I don’t know why I’m upset. Just… hearing you and seeing… I don’t know what to say. You’re right. You can do whatever you want.”
They’re in the middle of breaking into the Leviathan's corporate building when the curly haired brunette waves at Cas. She then blows him a kiss. Dean gasps at Cas. “Dude, what was that!”
They make it to their reservation on time. After Dean scolded Cas to keep his hands to himself when they were in the car, because clearly Cas wanted Dean to ruin their plans with how grabby he was. Which would usually be a dream- but honestly, Dean wants Cas to have something this nice. Their dates; while always extremely fun, have never been so fancy and dammit the guy deserves this.
Gabriel sees Castiel and Claire and smiles. "Hi, you must be Castiel. A face for the name at last." Cas nods at that. Gabriel reaches into his pocket and gives Claire a jolly rancher. "How you holding up kiddo?" Claire shrugs and takes the candy, slowly unwrapping it. "We're going to have a fun day. Don't you worry Claire."
Dean mopes upstairs for a good chunk of time. Apparently it's been an hour because he hears the yell from Mary for the boys to come down to eat. Sam leaves his room first and races his way down the stairs. Dean goes to the bathroom to wash his face off and pat it dry before he starts his descent.
“This is never about you being enough. You are enough. I’m sure he’s just as torn now. But you had to take care of yourself. I know you’re not better off now, but you also wouldn’t have been better off staying. Maybe he'll realize all of this and maybe he won’t. But you’ll get through. I’m always right here.”
Cas looks at the time and stands. Giving a small wave to his friends as he grabs a book from his bag so he can slump himself into a desk and suffer his way through his next lecture. Suffer his way through an hour and a half of not meeting Dean’s eye in class.
A loud grunt echoes over the two of them and Castiel and Dean look up to a dirty blonde man in a tight plaid shirt, "Castiel? What are you doing?" Castiel and Dean exchange glances and Castiel mouths out, "oh."
He strolls down the block and hugs himself to find warmth in the wind. The one day he leaves his leather at the house and goes out, nearly naked, in a black AC/DC T-shirt. “Son of a bitch,” he whispers to the wind nipping at his skin.
“We could do even better.”
“Anyways, I didn’t even know about it until today, but I’ve been secretly in love with all of them and we’ve all been in very real and long term relationships with one another. Ain’t that crazy?” No one dares to even blink as the four teachers stare at them all. After what feels like hours; but is truly only seconds, a girl in class, Maggie, raises her hand and stammers.
The check takes a few minutes to arrive and the entire time the two men are staring at each other not talking. Honestly if anyone else saw them and how they were staring, they could probably infer what was happening. Maybe not that one had a plug shoved up inside themselves and that the other was bouncing his leg just to feel some friction for his hidden erection. But anyone watching would definitely know the two were hot for each other.
Dean nods and laughs. “I’m… I just have to change. I’m gonna go out.”
Lisa looks between Bela and Cassie. “Clueless this one.” She looks back at Dean with her big smile and sparkling deep eyes. But these eyes don’t do a single thing for Dean. He misses blue. He misses getting lost in his eyes. Only his. “The song. What did you think?”
Dean’s anger makes Cas draw back and he bites his lip. Dean’s glaring at Benny and Benny is taking none of his shit. “He wasn’t a virgin. Maybe to that specifically- but he wasn’t. You just don’t usually have to hear it.”
Dean squirts more lube onto his fingers and fits two fingers inside Cas easily. He rocks his fingers until Cas is fucking back on his hand and he pulls out. “God. You’re fucking sexy.”
He needs to tell Dean. Get it out there so the two can go back to normal and Cas can get this off his chest and have a friend again.
Castiel twists the keys and the motor races to a slow stop. He set the suits on the chair when the two first boarded, and he slugs himself to them. He throws his shirt off over his head and folds it into a pile with the rest of his clothes. Dean whistles when Castiel stands in the nude. “Shut up,” Cas laughs, stepping into his suit. But when Dean follows, Castiel has the same reaction.
Castiel's long fingers land on Dean's shoulders, “then come home with me. I have a couch or a small guest room if you'd prefer. I can drop you off at your car tomorrow.” Dean wants to follow this man back to his car and taste his tongue. But he's not gay, so that'd be inappropriate. “I insist. It won't be too warm in your car and you'll just use up all of your gas if you leave it on all morning.”
Dean rolls himself out of bed and reaches for Castiel's hand. "Can I shower with you, Cas?" Castiel gets up and pulls Dean along with him.
Castiel shoves Dean hand away and arches his back so he can give Dean a peek at his ass as his mouth swallows down his cock. Castiel only has to bob up and down his shaft a few times until he feels Dean harden. Dean loses all thoughts and squeezes his balled fists onto the couch cushion. Dean groans when Castiel licks one last stripe up his cock and circles the rim of his tip in one quick motion. “Cas, don't just stop!” Dean feels his lower stomach grumble a hot build up. His dick is raging to be touched in any way.
Castiel rubs his hand down Dean's shoulder to his wrist, keeping strong eye contact while he makes Dean's arm hair raise. "Not yet."
Dean pulls his body back up and he takes a few more breaths coming down from his blissful release. “You really tired me out there, Cas. You should do that more often.” He feels his cheeks rush with red blush when Castiel chuckles against his chest. “I'll do better the next time for you, but for now can I just give you a blowjob? My mind feels too fucked to work right now.” Castiel rolls his body up so hes sitting in the far end cushion.
It’s actually pretty freeing to have this all figured out. Cas had it all figured out even younger than himself. Dean wonders how he would be now if he had, too. Would Dean and Cas actually have dated? Would they have broken up weeks in and never spoken again? Would they still be together now if only he had known himself better? Dean ponders those thoughts but he has to shoo them away before it gets to him.
Gabriel grabs out wrinkled paper from his pockets and grins, "looks like you two are teaming up for the day. You'll have Claire, Emma, Alex, and Krissy."
Dean backs up, breathless, gaping at Castiel's tight tan stomach and sharp hip bones. The man could cut someone with those. And hell yes does Dean want to find out if that's possible. He drops his own pants, kicking his ankles out from them. He spins Castiel around, bending his back down against the hood of the Impala.
Charlie helps Dean throw a birthday party for their friend. Dean wanted to go mini golfing or travel to the beach but Charlie went over his plans and made fake ID’s with the help of her tech friend, Dorothy, so they could go to a gay strip club. When Dean tried to argue against the idea she just tsked and said, “Dude, Cas would love a stripper. Why are you trying to keep him from the strippers?” She winks and says, “there’s guys and girlssss!”
Castiel laughs and wipes his eyes, "considering this is a child, your child's, field trip, I would have to agree. But hey, they'll learn about that some time later. It happens. Thankfully it was just me walking in and not a kid."
Cas knocks on the door that’s half closed and Dean laughs, “get your hot ass in here already.”
It’s not until Cas doesn’t answer Dean’s question that he turns to see Castiel dropped his bag behind them at the last house. Dean sees Castiel quickly walk away from them, so Dean calls Mary's name. "One minute, Dean."
Castiel erupts into laughter and lays his head into his hands. “Bi-sexual. It means you're attracted to both male and female. Did you not know that was a sexuality too?”
When the two finally have to strength to pull away and get up on their feet, Dean heads to the guest room promising he will return after he grabs his phone and keys. Castiel struts out to the living room in fresh clothes. A pair of blue jeans, a maroon jacket, and tan boots. “You ready now?” Castiel tosses Dean's dirty clothes to him and hooks his hand with Deans until they reach the car outside.
He groans to himself and scowls at his friend. “Fine. I’ll go.” Before either has time to look too happy about this agreement he finishes, “but Meg you have to go with. And I’m not dating the friend of your date. I may not even try to be polite.”
Dean stands up, lifting Castiel into a sitting position. He brushes the side of his mouth with his finger, and then sucks it into his mouth. Dean dabs again at his lip, and smiles. He rolls his finger over Castiel's lips and kisses him. "So fucking good."
Not bothering to look, Dean signs the receipt and pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket for the tip. He quickly gets up and grabs Castiel’s hand to follow.
“Dean, I swear, I only told Meg. I didn’t mean for this to happen. Are you really okay?” Cas looks around and sees a few people looking at them and he tries to step back. Maybe Dean can just tell everyone it was a joke and it can go back to normal for him.
Benny speaks out first because Cas looks like he’s going to pass out. “It was my fault. I just didn’t want anyone to know yet.” He pulls away from Cas. “It’s not a big deal or anything, Dean. But I’m sorry I didn’t tell you.”
Cas blushes. “Yeah, please.” The two start walking and immediately Dean takes Castiel’s hand.
Inias kisses Amara.
"You're delusion, Winchester. Of course not."
Dean laughs and agrees. “I promise you, I’m getting better. I want to be someone who makes him proud. And even if he won’t have me back… I’ll make myself keep proving myself to him everyday.”
Cas breathes heavily and nods. “I think it was good.”
The rest of the night she and her friends clump together off to the side and whisper amongst themselves. Cole joins the girls when he realizes Benny is not going to contribute to his gossip and gay bashing game.
Castiel kisses Dean quickly again and unhooks his legs, sliding down from his hold. "Race you."
Dean and he lazily kiss until the position gets uncomfortable. Even then, they reposition with shared laughter and continue. Even as Dean and he hear Dean’s ringtone going off to alert his calls, they don't move from this moment. The world can wait. They’ve waited too long.
Dean lights up at the name and nods. He recognizes the girl from the photos Cas has in the dorm and from his recants of stories of his group. “Hi Meg.”
Gabriel rolls his eyes and walks over, "where's Lydia? I do far more enjoy her presence than yours, Deano."
When Dean has stood up and adjusted his spot several times, the rest of the parents and Gabriel climb up onto the bus getting seats. Gabriel yells out over the kids, telling them the museum has offered to put together lunches for students. He goes over the importance of the buddy system. And how the adults need to check in by noon.
Dean feels sorry for Castiel. But hearing he is single makes him happier than before. Him being gay is also a plus. Not that he's interested in Cas.
Dean whistles, "wow you weren't kidding when you said extensive." He laughs softly, "so are you the oldest, middle, or youngest?"
Cas leaves to walk Inias upstairs and out to the car. But the rest of them stay and wait for the girls to get back. Just as Dean’s about to actually move and find the missing guests, the three come back in and Cassie sits down on the couch away from Dean. Dean moves to her and whispers to her if he can do anything and she glares. He kisses her forehead and she pulls back. “What’s that?”
Benny goes to find Cas and sees him and Dean’s little brother playing together, so he asks to join and the three of them play UNO. Thankfully Dean can see a smile back on Castiel’s face and he feels relief.
Meg gasps and twines her fingers through his hair. She pulls out her phone with her free hand and Cas hears the faint sound of the text delivering and she stands. “We’re going to get out of here and you’re going to talk to me about Dean. Winchester, right?”
The two had their bags and boxes packed up and each family made the three hour drive to bring the boys to the dorms. Dean wanted badly for him and Cas to be roommates but Cas argued that with, “we’re going to be in the same building, Dean. I don’t want our friendship to end just because you or I leave a sock out.” Which Dean could understand. Even though he believes they’re better than petty fights over clutter.
Dean crawls over the top of him and trails kisses down the side of his neck to his hip. Castiel's cock is so close to bursting a load of come. Dean licks his lips and scoots himself backwards until he's in a good angel to suck the tip of his penis into his mouth. "Oh- Dean! Dean- Ah that feels so good," Castiel cries out. His fingers lace into his short locks of hair and he tugs, pulling Dean's mouth farther down his shaft.
Sam frowns. “Well mom said to let you know we’ll have dinner in an hour. When dad gets home. She said you can leave back to your room when you’re finished but you have to eat with us. Ok?” Dean nods and Sam nods back to him. “For what it’s worth, whoever it was, they don’t deserve you.”
Dean grins, “I also thought it was in common interest that I tell you I just can’t seem to keep away from Ms. Bradbury. I don’t know what drew me in… her lack of availability for dating or her raging lesbianism. But fuck! We make each other so happy.”
Dean and he sit on the bathroom tile for a while until he cuts in to say that the dance is almost over anyways and they could go wait outside for Castiel’s mom. Cas has never felt so relieved.
“That was the best sex of my life.” Cas mumbles. Trying to roll onto his side next to Dean.
When Dean starts begging in higher pitches, Cas pulls off and jerks Dean’s cock so it splashes come over his chin. Dean is still finding his breath as Cas stands and spins Dean around, pining his stomach to the wall as he’s grabbing his own pants and yanking them down enough to free his own throbbing erection.
Castiel lays his hand on Dean's shoulder and smiles. "Thank you." He pulls his hand back down to his side and back ups when he hears Claire, Emma, and the other girls come racing back over. Claire isn't smiling, but she isn't frowning either, and that's an accomplishment. "You want to get on the bus, Claire?" Claire nods and tugs at Castiel's sleeve.
Castiel shrugs, "I would've thought that reason was you admired my nice ass, but I'll take it."
Cas chokes on his own voice and whispers, “yeah?”
Castiel's voice hums along to the song and Dean smiles, letting the voice of an angel be the only thing he listens to.
Despite his fears, he lets his mom drop him off at the school and leave him there. He immediately meets up with Dean there. Dean complains about needing to pee before they meet their girlfriends so Cas awkwardly follows him. He doesn’t want to meet up with the girls completely alone. Dean pees and then looks at Cas while he’s washing his hands. “It’ll be fine, Cas. I can feel your panic from over here.”
Dean looks down at Castiel's order. Thank god. Whatever this meal is- it looks like a ham and cheese sandwich and that is far more in Dean’s comfort of eating.
"Yeah, I will. I'm getting tired too. Goodnight, Cas." Dammit. Dean can't remember if he has called him by his full name yet and he just slipped out a nickname. He could up chuck a good amount of liquor just thinking about it. But his worries are all flooded away when he sees a hidden grin and rosy cheeks. "Goodnight, Dean."
Castiel looks pissed but responds, “great.” He rolls his eyes and gets up, “I’m not going to be nice to him.”
Castiel was in his last class of the day when he overheard a girl whisper, “that’s totally him. That’s the Cas.”
He sees Castiel’s confused side glance and then waits for the call to end before addressing further. He asks Dean who he wanted to bring and before Dean thinks it through he shouts, “gonna invite Aaron.”
Dean laughs and chugs Emma's glass of untouched apple juice. "Fine, fine. Let's get a move on."
Dean can't get himself to face Cas. "Was just thinking about someone. Guess I got carried away?"
As much as Dean never wants this feeling to end, he knows his body can't handle much more. At least for now. So he takes Castiel in his hand, jerking his hand over Castiel’s cock as he pounds behind him. “Cas, Cas. Cas, I love you, fuck. I love you so much,”
Mary walks over to the door behind John and hugs Naomi. “Cas looks adorable.” She grins at her neighbor-turned-friend, "John will be at home passing out candy when I take the boys trick or treating. Would it be okay if Castiel spent the night after? It may make it a little easier for you. And I know Dean would love having him," Mary says hopeful.
Dean looks up and his eyes bulge. Why is a man sitting across from him? Does he know him? "Yeah- nice to meet you," he says. He watches the corners of Castiel's mouth turn up and he relaxes. Okay, sure, maybe Dean doesn't know why this man is sitting here, but a part of him is glad. He is a sight.
The dinner itself was good. If not a bit awkward. Mary and Naomi led most of the questions. They included the guests to their best efforts as also asking their sons how they were doing. John would interrupt a few of Dean and Castiel’s recants of stories to bring up an old memory of the two and by the end of dinner, Sam all but ran to grab one of their scrapbooks. Although Sam had some appearances, the entire thing is mostly Dean and Cas. Everything from the boys butt naked running around one of their houses, to pictures of Dean and Cas cuddled together in bed, to pictures of their awkward holiday parties and group photos from school. There’s even two pages of Cas and Dean holding hands and dancing around the house. And it’d be cute if they were kids- but the photo dates to their junior year of high school.
Cas sits up faster than Dean has ever seen Cas move and his friend doesn’t blink. “Are you kidding me? Who! Wait. What the hell, Dean, you’re straight.” He looks flabbergasted and Dean chuckles. “This isn’t funny! Since when did you- you like boys now?”
“Stop, oh my god! They aren’t in love!” Alex says, smiling at Claire, despite her quiet outburst coming across as angry.
They both have lunch together with their family members and then say bye to their parents. Mary and Naomi are both crying messes and talking about how “our boys don’t need us anymore,” which makes Dean snort because he’s going to need his mom for so much more now. They both hug their moms again and then let their parents and Sammy leave with a few words of departure.
He hears the bed creak in the other room and a low yawn. He tries to focus on anything other than turning to see Claire once again with a distraught face. This girl has gone through too much already and he can't stand to see her look so cold. And he knows there's nothing he can do to fix it.
A guy in Dean’s bio class, Victor, shouts Dean over to watch but he pretends to miss it and quickly walks out to find some other friends. So much for getting back with Anna.
When he gets back to Castiel's door he debates if he should really go in or not. What if Castiel would be mad? But when he hears another moan he feels his cock harden farther. Castiel doesn't have the right to get both of them hard and not let him deliver. Dean takes a breath and pushes the door open.
Cas tries to think of movies he’s seen that showed good kisses. He’s unsure what makes each one feel better than another and he looks at Dean cautiously. “Can we practice before we leave? I don’t want to screw it up.” Dean looks like Cas asked a terrible question and Cas retreats. “We don’t have to. I just thought since we were friends that we could practice so it’s not bad for them. It was stupid.”
Alastair's smile is still smug across his face and he winks, "sure, we’ll see, kiddos. Y’know you and your boyfriend need to calm down and respect the rules of older kid authority."
On the way out of the restaurant Castiel and Dean both link hands, "so where to? Do you have anywhere in mind?" Castiel asks.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas laughs and playfully shoves Dean. “You cried. Don’t think I didn’t notice.”
“Are you kidding? Watch his eyes, Alex. They’re totally focusing on his lips every other two seconds.” Claire points discreetly and turns back to facing her friends.
When they pull into the parking structure, Dean slams Baby into her spot and hauls ass out of the car. Remembering; thankfully, to lock her before they slink into the elevator.
The hour long drive contained of Dean singing to lines from some of his favorites. Castiel admired most of his music, to be honest,  Castiel thinks he should really start listening to it more often. When Dean asked Castiel for what his music taste was, he flipped it to the radio. "I like a bit of everything." Dean groaned when Taylor Swift started blasting from his speakers.
Dean kisses Amara, again.
And as they climb into bed that night, they don’t bring it up. Dean just scoots closer to Cas than normal and whispers, “goodnight, Cas.”
Castiel and Dean spend the next half an hour cuddling on the couch. Neither had enough energy or desire to put clothes back on. The cool air in the house did motivate them to lay a blanket down over the two of them. It brought more warmth and comfort as they laid back and talked. Talked about everything important that came to the top of their heads.
Dean stands up. They look at each other with exhaustion and Dean whispers “don’t do this.”
Cas looks in shock and blinks at Dean. Like it’ll all change if he blinks hard enough. “Obviously I told some other people. Told Benny and Garth. And Aaron. Hah- you were so right about that one. And talked to Balthazar. He warned me that he was going to kick yours and my asses after we figured it all out for leaving him in the dark.”
Don't you fight"
Cas nods, “oh, okay. Well Meg asked me to ask you. I told her I wanted you to go to the dance with us, so she said that.”
Her face is tomato paste red, “I don’t know. I just thought if you and Mr. Milton were in love than that meant I had good gaydar and I could be a real gay, y'know? I don’t know... that’s stupid. But gay people can sense that sorta thing- but I guess I’m not a good enough one. I mean I can’t even tell if my own friend likes girls. I think I just wished-“ she stops short. “I just let this idea get out of control and… I’m sorry. I didn’t mean for people to spread rumors. I didn’t think anyone besides the kids would hear about it. But even then… I should’ve known better.” She tries to fake a smile but it looks shaky.
Claire turns around, trying to comb her now messy hair with her fingers. She looks up at him to complain but instead she looks at Dean and back at Cas. "What's that?" She points at the not so hidden hickey on Castiel's adams apple. The three other girls all look up from the glass to Claire pointing at Cas.
Dean told Castiel about his work at the garage. His dad's friend, practically Dean's uncle, gave him a job. But Dean's been winding up some parts and pieces for the shop. And Castiel told Dean about working at a pet shop. Since his apartments lease won't let him get a pet, Castiel thought it'd be best to work at a shop. He explained to Dean how he is trying to get bees added to the pet list. Apparently making honey is one of his passions.
Because Dean’s too drunk to handle seeing Aaron at the dorms tonight he asks if he can crash on Castiel’s floor. Castiel says he can come over.
Castiel relaxes and slowly sucks deep bruises into Dean's collarbone. Creating a red and purple color palette. He loves hearing every moment of hitched breath, soft whispers, and small pleads. “I need you, Cas,” Dean whispers.
“Dad! You’re late!” Emma says running to the door when the two knock. Dean ruffles her hair, “sorry bud. You and Claire just get in the car, okay?”
Hell. They both have a night off. It looks like the big man gave them their wish. Or maybe not God. Considering their wish was to spend a not so innocent night together. None the less, they both owe a big thanks to whomever set this up. Dean winks at Cas as soon as the girls walk away with Alex's mom. "So Cas- were both free tonight."
Dean looks back up at Cas and feels his eyes filling with tears. He’s not sure why the hell he feels like his world is tipping but it sucks. The feeling is worse than any stomach ache. And he’s not quite sure why he’s so upset by this- but he is. Cas hardly talks about the boys he hooks up with and when he does- Dean just feels proud for him. But hearing Cas moan in ways that Dean would never know of hurts. Cas is his best friend. If anyone deserves to hear that, it’s him.
"You know why." Castiel shakes his head. "Come on then, I'll start, tell me about your travel. I know you've gone a bunch of places."
Clearly not the answer wanted because John sighs loudly and his stern voice goes, “Dean,” Mary grips his fathers hand in warning and John sighs again. “I’m being kind, Mary. But our son is fine. It’s not going to be his first heartbreak. What was so special about this girl anyways? You can find a new girl eventually. You’re a young smart man, Dean. You’ll be able to move on.”
God does he feel nauseous. Fuck. If he’s going to get through this night he’s going to need a shit ton of tequila to numb it out. He rolls his eyes and reaches for a shot. Meg went all out for him. There’s at least 10 shots on the tray still and he chuckles thinking about how much credit Meg gives him for drinking. Despite knowing his body could handle it- he doesn’t want to black out later so he starts with throwing back five. He passes one to Meg and another one to Max. “Go for it. I’m not going to have them all.”
He hear's Castiel's voice wash back into his focus and he coughs, "yeah?"
Dean doesn’t cry during sex. Never has before. But his eyes are filled with tears and he can feel them rolling off his face and dripping down Castiel’s back. Castiel must feel it too because he responds in broken moans, “Dean, always love you, love you always.”
Dean grasps onto Castiel's hand and pulls him close. “Please don’t do this. I don’t care about any of them- they know that! I tell them I’m not looking. You have to know this, Cas! I know it’s hard, I just need more time,” he sponges his sleeve over the snot on Castiel’s face. “Please, Angel. You’re everything.”
He pulls the back of the thong to the side, so he can slide the plug out. He kisses Castiel’s ass as he hears him gasp, feeling the silicone thickness taken away. “Dean, please,”
It's been two weeks since the two first met and Dean can feel his heart race with any thought of Castiel. He can't recall a time anyone made him feel this much love. Maybe his first love, Cassie, but even then he didn't have the automatic feeling that everything would be fine in the long run. He hoped for that, but never thought it could. With Cas, it's a different story. He talks to Dean about all of the things he loves. He even mentions trivial facts in a normal conversation. That makes Dean heart flip. He could listen to Castiel talk about testing makeup on monkeys and never want Castiel to stop (and yes, he infact did just that). Intellectually, Castiel fuels Dean's thoughts. He brings ideas into it, that Dean can't imagine of thinking about in his spare time. Emotionally, he gives Dean more than enough love and kindness. When Dean feels moments of sadness, Cas knows how to make him feel better. And of course, sexually, Dean has never felt better. He isn't sleeping around- he is making love.
“We were in the same second semester Statistics and Research class, last school year. The tables were two to a seat and he sat next to me. We literally didn’t speak to each other unless the professor asked us to.” He laughs remembering, “and then I got my quiz back. I failed, big time. And he laughed at me! But said I’d do better next time. That was the first honest conversation we had. And then the next class he came in and actually asked how I was doing. It was a whole shift and we started talking a lot.”
Dean wants to hug this woman. She's put up with him the entire time. Offered him a ride when it's already too early for most normal people to be up. “No, but thank you. And thanks for not kicking me out. Sorry if I was any trouble.”
Dean licks his lip and blushes, "this is a date?" He watches as the blue eyed wonder rolls his eyes with a nod. "Well I'm flattered then," Dean replies, hoping this goes very well. No one is ever this direct.
Alex ponders her statement, “I mean... I don’t know. But she could be.”
Dean doesn't feel his body shift forward. All he knows is that his hand is now cupping Castiel's side with one hand. And his opposite hand is slowly wrapping its way around him for a hug. He watches Castiel's pupils dilate and he feels him jump under his touch. Shit. Dean can't get himself to form words, all he can do is pull back from the hug and stare at Cas.
“Dean. Dean, I’ve… I’ve loved you from the start. It was always you.” He sees Dean’s pupils dilate as he looks at Castiel’s lips growing into a smile. “I love you, Dean. God, I love you so much. Always.”
“What!” Cas answers, before he realizes his tone. He tries again, “what?”
A few cars are racing down the street. A young couple is walking, holding hands and swinging themselves in a rhythm against each others sides. Dean wants to go get in baby and take her home, but he also does not want to drive drunk. Sure he isn't very drunk anymore, but he still has a pounding in his head that makes his eyes feel drowsy. And he also does not want to drive all the way home and have to listen to Charlie and whatever girl she is with, getting cozy up in the room next to his. Maybe he can just sleep out in the lot he parked at. How bad could that be?
Charlie tsks at his words and waves him over. “Dude come sit with me. We can hang in my office. You can always come to gossip about your crushes and ex’s and talk about your sex life and ask questions. And nerd out, obviously.” She laughs and finger guns at Aaron, “but if you have any specific sex questions I’m going to point you to this fella here.”
Cas giggles and holds Dean’s hand. “It counts.” He kisses their joint hands, “if it makes you feel better, I kinda did too.”
4th grade!
Castiel blushes and sucks his bottom lip into his mouth, "you know, I kind of liked that. And I also like hearing about your brother, he seems very nice."
"Can we not even make it into the house?" Dean laughs feeling Castiel's fingers trace the rim of his jeans.
Mary claps her hands together, smiling at her boys. Dean pulls at his costume that is tight around his neck and John zips the back of Sammy's brown onesie. He places a mask over his eyes and watches Sammy's face light up as he giggles. "Here, quick, let me get a picture of my cute boys," Mary admires, taking out her camera. She snaps several before the doorbell rings.
Dean clings into Sam's hug and Sam quickly reads the room and looks to his mom for answers and direction. Mary tells Dean she and Sam will bring his things up in a while, but Dean's free to lay down in bed or on the couch in the meantime. Because “you must be tired from driving,” despite it being only an hour drive.
Dean steps closer and rests his hand on Castiel's waist. "I've been living my whole life thinking I couldn't be with a man because I liked women. Thank you- so much."
Alex snaps Claire out of her spiraling panic as she slumps into her chair and groans. “Did you hear? Becky fucking Rosen was blabbing about the poll to Mr. Lafitte. She seriously said, ‘they’re only friends right? I thought it would be you coupled with Mr. Winchester.”
Castiel raises his eyebrow, "so what?"
He’s jogging past groups of people laying out in the grass or working on their studies and even playing frisbee or kicking a ball around.
Dean, still holding Cas, trails his lips from Castiel's mouth, down the side of his neck. Sucking against his tan skin. Feeling electrify shoot through him every time Castiel groans into Dean's hair. He smiles when Castiel's hands grip tighter into his shoulders. He feels Castiel's legs bump up and down his waist as he hits his sweet spot.
Castiel’s eyes widen and he stares in panic at Dean. And Dean can only look the same way back. Cole snickers and elbows Benny as if to ask, 'you seeing this?'
Castiel grins, "yes, it would look so."
They miss three tables at the end of lunch but have over 40 casted votes.
Dean can’t even try laughing. If only he could just love Aaron. It'd be simple. “Cas. I love Cas, Sam.”
Dean huffs, “yeah, what was your vote?”
Dean sees Castiel's eyes flicker up to him. He blushes in front of him and jumps into the song right on time, this time louder- yet still soft in desire.
The annoyance of sharing a room with Castiel doesn’t hit him until Dean finds Cas in bed with some guy. Cas talked a lot about meeting someone and described their relationship as “we just help each other with classes and then occasionally have sex. It’s not a big deal.”
When Cas explained how important it was that he see his family for the holiday, Balthazar complained that, “Cassie, it’s only your mom. The Winchesters aren’t even your family.”
Mary laughs, “oh honey, we would never kill Cas.” She looks at him with a far different look. Cas stands off to the side and blows her a kiss when John looks away and she chuckles. Dean is scoffing but Cas just pulls him along, “I’ll make sure he takes care of the car.”
Castiel chokes on his tongue and Dean grins, “only if your uncle will take me.”
He’s typing a paper for his creative writing class when he feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around and faces a girl in all black and leather. “Dean is it? Hi, I’m a friend of Castiels.”
Claire shrugs, "no. I want to go to school. Dad always said it was important to-" her voice trails off and her eyes glass over with tears. "Anyways." She quickly turns around and marches to the bathroom.
Castiel is at the closet door, shedding off layers of jackets. Dean feels a lump get stuck in his neck. Dammit, this man has nice shoulders even with clothes still on. He makes himself look away from the man and he glances at a table of wedding pictures. “Where's the wife? She going to mind me staying here?”
Cas laughs at Dean’s giddiness and agrees. “Yes, I think it will be a grand time.”
Besides Sam no longer trick or treating, they all continue on their trick or treat walk as normal. Mary and Ruby continue chatting it up. Sneaking small glances at the boys, but obviously growing less worried the farther they go because the kids are all happy.
“Ca- Cas. Why are you doing that? It feels- really good. God Cas. Cas.” If Castiel had only done just this, Dean could have came without being touched in any other way. But when he feels Castiel's fingers pull out he nearly loses his mind. Castiel is still sucking against Dean's chest as he fiddles for the lube next to them. Castiel sits up and grins, slicking his cock. “You sure, you want this still Dean?”
They got me raising steam
Balthazar smiles and claps loudly. Meg tries to argue about her appearance being needed but Balthazar shushes her into silence.
Castiel can't help but blush. Dean has that affect.
She looks to be calculating her next thoughts. “I do think this could be a learned experience, though. If you meet someone who starts the relationship in fear and withdrawal, I would step back. People in the closet deserve the love and support they need, but it’s not our job to change ourselves to do it. Be a friend first and foremost. Help them see how exciting and powerful it is to be true to yourself. If it’s not labeled, they won’t retreat in panic of the unknown. Instead they see a friend and can find admiration for who you are and eventually, hopefully, for who they are. It can be more inspiring.
“You dick!” Cas pinches Balthazar’s arm and feels the boy’s body tremble in surprise. “You said you were going on a date! Why are we at the fucking club!”
Dean was annoyed by Castiel’s hesitation but finally talked him into rooming with him because, “Cas I practically live with you anyways. I promise not to throw my stuff all over. I don’t need another Aaron in my life though so please…”
Dean carries the conversation as if nothing happened. Castiel's arm is there for support and that's it. "I was once unbuckled when my dad took me out to the grocery store, the cop who stopped us sure was pissed off. But no, load an entire class of kids onto a seat buckle less bus, and call it safe." That awards Dean with one of Castiel's soft smiles.
Sam laughs, "whatever, jerk. Goodbye."
Dean smiles and scoots under the blanket. “Yeah.”
Welcome to the year of school we all hated... 8th grade!
Dean wants to wrap his arms around Castiel. Any time he talks about his brother, he can't help but feel terrible. If anything happened to Sammy, Dean would be a wreck. Instead Dean stretches his shoulders out, "man, all me and my brother did was listen to our Walkman and put spoons in each others mouths when one fell asleep."
Castiel smirks, "who? Your wife? Girlfriend?"
As much as he tries to think about anything but Dean’s new smiles and strange behavior- he can’t. It’s not like Dean is hiding a dumb secret. Cas would have already figured it out. He tries to think of the last time Dean acted normal around him and he remembers the Thanksgiving disaster. Aaron left and then Dean and Sam hid upstairs. Dean never did tell him why Aaron left. Why he really left.
Since Dean can remember, his family and the two Novak’s have had their annual week-of Christmas party together. Castiel’s mom and he come over to decorate their house and then they invite other families from school and work to attend. This year, his parents and Naomi gave the boys permission to invite a few friends each from school. Dean gave his invites to his friends Benny and Cole and also invited his girlfriend Cassie and her best friends Hannah and Amara.
“Dean, I need to do some work on the car, think you can help?” The gruff voice asks.
When Cas comes out, Dean does have to do a double take. Because Cas definitely got a new outfit. He’s wearing a black jumpsuit. The pants hug his ass beautifully and Dean could drool staring. The top half is a sheer long sleeve with a sharp v neck and puffier shoulders. He looks like a walking wet dream. It doesn’t help that Cas left his hair shaggy. And hold on? Eyeliner? Deans not going to get through this dinner.
Max kisses Cas’s cheek. “For what it’s worth, he’s an idiot for not showing you off to every last person.” Cas realizes he’s still standing with his pants around his low thighs and pulls them up and zips close. He opens the lock behind them and apologizes again.
The other man was set back and he tilts his head. "Wow. I thought this was going to be a complete sham of a date, but you're actually way better than I thought you'd be. So far."
During lunch the three girls spend the first eight minutes scarfing down as much food as they can, so they can carry out their mission. They make it to nearly every table before lunch is over. They write down each student's name so they don’t face getting multiples from the same person. Josephine and Aiden are the first to record responses. Krissy spins her hair on her fingers while talking to Aiden, who agrees they are just friends. He argues that Mr. Milton is definitely gay but there is no way Mr. W is anything but straight. Josephine rolls her eyes and fist bumps Claire because, “their chemistry alone can answer this question.”
Dean grins, brushing his hand through Castiel's head of hair. Castiel pulls out from Dean, rolling onto his back. “You are so great Dean,” Castiel says softly. He wants to roll onto his side and stare at Dean; counting his freckles, but instead he continues to lay flat, looking up. “I like you, Dean Winchester.”
“I don't want to swim, what if there's a giant shark down there.” Dean groans, holding his hands over his belly.
Meg tries her best to hold it back but she hums out a giggle. “Dude I was so confused with the sweater. Cas made you seem so manly and to find you wearing this was quite a shock, to be fair.”
Cas laughs at Dean’s intrigue, “don’t think you’d want the details.”
Castiel grunts trying to stretch out his legs once he's on the ground. "You seemed like you were going to be sick. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. And also because Gabriel said the groups had another hour left before we get back to the bus." Castiel yawns loud enough for Dean to hear. "Gabriel said he would meet us in the human body exhibit. He said the girls would be fine with him until you're better."
Castiel huffs and shakes his head staring into Dean's eyes. He kisses Dean again, this time gentler.
Living with Cas has been a dream compared to Dean’s last semester. Honestly, he’s confused why Cas had such an issue with it in the first place. The two have been having sleepovers every other few days since they were four years old. Cas even lived at the Winchester house for three months once when Naomi had to travel out of the country. Rooming at college has not been awful and Dean has been extra careful so Cas doesn’t have a reason to think otherwise.
After Cas is back from the coffee-turned-dinner with Charlie, he comes back to the apartment and notices his package on the table. Dean walks out from their bedroom and glances, “what’d ya order?”
"Hello! It's good to see you, John." He is met with Castiel's mother who is patting Castiel inside. "Sorry about his costume. The kid refuses to wear anything else right now. He's going through a dress phase."
“I know I don’t deserve to have your respect, but I hope you can understand why I did this. I wanted you to have the best life, Dean. That’s all I ever wanted for my boys. And I’m sorry I fucked things up so much for you to get here.” John is surprisingly the one who’s in tears. Dean hasn’t seen his father cry since he was ten and they went to their family friends, William Harvelle's, funeral.
John gives Dean the impalas keys with a stern look, “be safe.” Dean tries to assure his dad and Mary interrupts, “don’t worry John, he knows he will never see sunshine again if he ruins that car.” Dean looks taken back and his mom gives him an even more serious look.
"I thought- I just- you said you'd be wearing plaid. We were supposed to meet here at 2 and the only person here was-" Castiel feels beyond embarrassed. Why did his friend have to set him up on a blind date? He's never been a fan of this and he's only been on one blind date before this. "I'm sorry. I- uh-" Castiel looks at Dean, "I didn't realize- I didn't even ask your name to make sure-"
When Dean suggests he pull over so they can fuck in the back seat, Cas looks willing to take up the offer. But he groans, “no, we have to…” he gasps when Dean goes over a bump in the road and the plug slams farther. “fuck! Dean, get us home. Want to show you the surprise.”
“Dean, what do you think?”
When Castiel combs his fingers into his hair, Dean knows he has to give Castiel what he wants. Cas is a hair puller. And as much as Dean loves it, he still feels exhaust from Castiel's part, and knows that hard tugs on his head will only make him more breathless and winded.
Alastair shrugs, "no ma'am, just talking to these cute kids."
Dean cuts her off, “thank you. Lovely meal, we’d love the check.”
Dean takes a few moments before he allows himself to pull out. His body can’t hold itself up any longer and he rolls onto his side next to Cas, who lays ass up, head buried in the pillow.
Dean tries to hold back the biggest grin but fails and shrugs. “Well Sammy will probably be obsessed with you at first but I’m hoping he doesn’t idolize you forever. My mom is basically planning our future wedding in her head. So like, if you really don't want this will you at least call her and tell her so she could have a heads up. And uh, my dad is okay. He kinda feels like shit for ‘changing me’ but he also kept going on about being young and finding someone. Which I think I finally got through to him at the end about having already found my person.”
Dean rolls his eyes but relents.
Dean points at the door, "would you like to get lunch to go and we can leave somewhere? Anywhere."
Meg shrugs, “I’m always on your side. You know that.” Cas smirks at Balthazar but Meg sighs, “but... I think maybe he’s right? Just about socializing. You’ve turned into a hermit, Clarence. I mean- this is; what? The third time I’ve seen you in the past month?” She frowns, “I’m just worried about you. And I don’t know what to do. I’m not one for this touchy-feely crap. I could’ve killed the guy by now if you just told me the name of the sorry bastard who hurt you, though.”
Cas bows his head in response and frowns. “No one can know, Meg. He’s not- we didn’t,”
Life went on as normal. Cas and Dean bouncing back and forth between each other’s houses. Their parents took them; and Sam to college tours and they helped each other fill out forms and write their admission papers. Dean and Cas both got into the same three schools so they decided from there what they wanted to do. Castiel got accepted into a more prestigious private school out of state that Dean kept trying to talk him into going to.
But Mr.Winchester, I really want that tiger." Dean rubs his forehead. Why did he decide to load the kids up with ice cream? Oh right, maybe he shouldn't share his sexual fantasies out loud. Dean is going to start yelling.
Alastair blocks their way again and smiles. "Listen up boys, you're going to go collect some candy for me and then you're going to meet me back here and hand it over. You got it?"
Castiel was the only name on the will. Every belonging was left in his name, even their kid. But he's not going to bring her back to that house. Not now at least. She has said she doesn't want to step a foot in there again. Now it's all the matter of getting himself to go over there during an off day.
Claire takes the hint and gets up as Mr. Milton walks in and pulls up a chair to the side of Mr. Winchester’s desk.
Claire talks to Max a lot. And Max always talks about how she knew Stacy was gay when they first talked. She said she knows if most people are based on observation. Claire was so sure that her observations were spot on. But now Ms. Bradbury might not be a lesbian; like assumed, and her favorite dorky English teacher is not smitten over Mr. Milton the art teacher. She must have been way off.
“John!” Mary scolds and John just looks at Dean for a moment and back to her.
He creeps closer and rubs his hand over Castiel's causing a quick breath. Castiel's eyes spawn open and Dean feels worried. He could've stepped over a boundary. "Sorry- I just thought, maybe... You could use some help. I can leave." He watches Castiel's eyes narrow down on him. Castiel's long fingers wrap around Dean's wrist and he pulls him in lightly.
Well… maybe a few times. Maybe when Dean saw Benny and Cas together in high school he was jealous. Ok, extremely jealous. And maybe when Alfie and Cas would make out in the room he was in he’d white knuckle the desk and wish Alfie would disappear.
Dean didn't mean to include a mystery person into conversation with his nagging brother. But it just slipped out. "Shut up." Dean feels Castiel's eyes still staring at him. "Gotta go Sammy, I'll tell Gabe to keep it in his pants when he heads back to your place tonight."
The next four hours he feels beyond tipsy. This lady is going to get the greatest money she has ever gotten in her life.
When their families are gone and the two give an acceptable time between for the chances a family member comes back for a forgotten item- they’re on each other. Their curtains aren’t set up, and there’s stacks of boxes surrounding them but they don’t care. Cas picks Dean up and presses his back against the wall as he kisses him over and over until Dean’s begging him to stop teasing him.
Another guy overhears the other student’s conversation and looks. He smiles and waves at Cas. Weird. He then turns to his friend and smirks, “damn, Winchester knows how to choose them. He’s totally hot. That’d be worth changing teams.”
Castiel and he go to Dean's bedroom upstairs and Cas takes a pillow and drops it on the floor. Dean’s curious to what Castiel is doing and Cas just looks away and curls up on top of the rug and asks for Dean to throw him a blanket down.
Cas wipes a few trails of water off his cheeks and sighs, “I really tried but I don’t want to keep fighting him over coming out. I also don’t want to be the jerk who forced him to. I just wanted him to want me. Enough to tell others and choose me. But I couldn’t- and I can’t feel normal now. Because he didn’t do anything wrong and I don’t feel like we should be apart. I just wasn’t enough for him to-” Meg coughs and cuts him off.
“Sleeping beauty still out? It’s nine.”
Dean shushes, “that wasn’t crying,”
Dean doesn’t complain though and he sulks into his bedroom.
Dean laughs and wipes his forehead on the way to the car. Even though the girls are inside the car and the windows are still up Dean whispers, “Cas- we should do this again. Next friday?” Castiel winks lowering into the seat.
The picnic was a surprise for Dean and he hugged Cas for a short second before putting space between them.
He slowly sucks the tip into his mouth. Licking his tongue over it, tasting the salty drizzle leak. “You're so good Cas,” Dean says in between a breath. He starts to bob his mouth until he reaches closer and closer to the bottom. He feels Castiel's nails burrow into his shoulders, pulling himself closer to Dean.
John interrupts his long; not easily followed rant, “Dean. I’m sorry.”
Cas doesn’t even care at this point. The alcohol clearing his head.
"I'm sorry; I feel really bad, but I can't do this. I have a different manner to attend to right now. It means a lot that you came out, but I don't know if this would work out." He watches for a reaction but instead he gets a blank stare. "I am truly sorry."
When Castiel bends over onto the ground to tie Alex's shoes, Dean spots the small back of Castiel's skin where his shirt rolled up. His back, from what it looks like, has lean muscles gliding over his soft tanned skin. Dean begun dozing off, thinking about sinking his tongue into Castiel's rear, licking him open.
Sophomore year, Thanksgiving  :)
Cas feels overwhelmed and startles himself by his own loud reply. Dean wipes Castiel's eye and whispers closer, “I love you, Angel.” He kisses his lips over Castiel's. They share a quick kiss, a desperate one, and one pure from the relief.
Dean feels his stomach roll inside him and he tries to act happy for Cas when their moms are yelling their responses of ‘yes’ and ‘of course.’ Mary asks if Dean has anyone special that would like to join and he shrugs, “yeah, actually.” Lie. Total bullshit.
“What about you? You married?” Dean bites his lip, “I don't have a wife.” Castiel's eyes look dark and luring, “that's not what I asked, but okay.” Dean remains in a constant stare with Castiel, until Cas breaks away grabbing a water bottle from the counter. His throat bobs. His adam's apple rolls with each swallow. God, how can he make everything look so lustful?
Castiel rest his head on top of Dean's, hugging his arms around Dean's shoulders, fucking himself into his mouth faster.
Cas piped up from the spot next to Dean and he joined Dean over his FaceTime. Maybe it was Castiel’s wild hair or how Dean’s lips looked swollen- but Mary and Naomi both smirked to each other before asking, “any news?”
“Don’t ask stupid questions, Cas.”
Dean moans as he slowly rocks himself into Cas. Castiel's entrance is wet and hot. Dean moans Castiel's name, loosing all knowledge of every other word in existence but Castiel's name.
Max doesn’t look overly invested but also gives him a contemplated gaze. “I mean what I heard was that ‘Dean Winchester is totally gay and he’s in love with Castiel.’ I guess that could be an outing, though. Good luck finding him.”
Cas and Dean hang out for the first couple hours and then by eleven they part ways so Dean can go find Anna to woo, and Cas can go find his mystery man.
Dean laughs and he grabs Castiel's hand, “I would hope. Considering we just fucked on a boat. I'm glad I'm not just a nice ass for you.” Dean rubs his thumb over Castiel's knuckles.
Castiel turns around stopping at Dean's car door, "my place or yours?"
Cas pulls him closer and kisses his neck and gasps as he feels him unzipping his pants. “Eager?” The other boy hums and continues getting his and Castiel’s pants loosened so they can get to the good stuff. “You look pretty good yourself.”
Dean rubs his wet cock and pushes into Cas slowly. The thong string pulled to the side.
"Emma, what do we say?" The green eyed man stops a few feet away from Castiel and stares down. Emma smirks and shrugs. "Emma, you're old enough to know what I mean. I told you to stop running. Say you're sorry."
Castiel giggles, “well it’s not like there’s too many boys to choose from. But um… yeah. This one guy and I have been messing around lately.”
Dean understands Castiel's warning and his mouth is filled with load of hot come. Castiel remains resting on top of Dean's head, arms draped around him as if Dean is his only hope. Dean swallows and licks a line off of misfired come from Castiel's lower chest.
Thankfully the four girls all choose seats in a row. Dean and Cas squeeze into the seat behind Alex and Emma. Cas makes sure to keep a close eye on Claire who's in the row ahead of the others.
Dean moans against Castiel's cock and that sends him to the edge. Castiel's eyes scrunch and his converts up, his dick sliding from Dean's mouth. His hot load of come plasters to the side of Dean's mouth. "Shit. Fuck, sorry Dean," Castiel pants.
Thinking about Dean was enough to push him to the edge. "Dean I need to-" Dean rolls back over bringing Castiel along over him and he grins, "it's okay. I want to feel it. I need to feel this Cas, I want you to come in me." Castiel nods and moans, closing the space between Dean's mouth and his.
Maybe it was a mistake to mix boys and girls for the party. Because things start getting frustrating about the same time they arrive. And it just gets worse when Dean goes to toss the empty coke jug into the trash bag.
Cas is definitely drunk. For a while he was tipsy but the alcohol is seeping into his body and making him giddy. He watches his hookup throw back a shot at the pong table and the two meet eyes and he goes to excuse himself from the game. Everyone boos but the guy just brushes them off and Cas starts walking to the stairs in hopes that he won’t be far behind.
Cas let’s Dean wipe his sleeve over his face and let’s his body be pulled into a hug. “Can we leave? I’m such a dick and I don’t want to see Benny right now. I’ll talk to him later but I can’t right now. I’m so sorry. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
“You’re an idiot. I love it.”
Dean signals his hand up but Cas grabs it from across the table and pulls it down so they're holding hands across from one another. “Come on, if something is wrong we can-”
Castiel keeps to himself and Dean grumbles, “whatever dude. Cole was just being a dick. It’s not like he was saying anything true.”
"Where’s the boyfriend?”
Dean is so close to that confidence but he wants to be able to prove it to Cas without hesitation.
Aaron tells Dean that he and a friend came here and they were calling him in need of a ride back to their house so he leaves Dean but kisses him and whispers, “I’ll see later tonight.”
Cas smiles. Her personality obviously made for this job. She comes over to shake his hand and pulls out a basket behind the desk. “Come on, Aaron. Newbies always get a button,” she jokes.
Mary glares at the doorway again; like John is just going to walk back in and see her look of anger. “Dean, your dad was raised in a very poor home. He grew up in really bad areas and didn’t have the same luxury of quality education.” She sighs, “I’m not excusing his reactions but that’s why. Your father and I talked before we had kids about this stuff, too. I didn’t want to go into having a family with him knowing we had far opposing ideas of raising children.” She continues and smiles at her sons, “despite how it may seem, John and I actually both found common ground in how we’d go about it if our children did ever tell us they were gay.”
The bus ride is the same usual delight of uneasy shaking and bumps. Almost forcing Dean to spring over the seat when they hit a pothole.
Dean pulls out his wallet and hands over a handful of cash. How come icecream is so expensive? They better have gotten the ingredients from the other side of the world.
“Cas. I missed you.”
Sam holds the boy's sticky hand while he goes to town on the sucker. Dean finds out from Sammy's yelling, that the kids name is Gabriel. And yes, he definitely likes his sweets.
She looks between Castiel and Dean and grins, "okay. Sorry, I just thought. Well if they can, I can take them with me right now. I was planning on ordering a few pizzas today for dinner. And I'm sure Alex will have pajamas for them to wear."
Gabriel laughs, "yeah. You tools are capable." He goes to walk off to announce to the other parents. Dean shouts, "say hi to Sam for me!" That instantly gets a quick eye roll and Gabriel rubbing his hands down his face. Abruptly flipping Dean off in the least noticeable fashion.
"Fuck," Dean rubs his hands over Castiel's chest, "how the hell are you so beautiful?" Castiel pants, hooking his ankles around Dean's torso. He slides his hands down, pulling Dean's underwear down a few inches hoping Dean gets the memo.
Cas kept seeing Benny until the end of the school year. He just made sure to be places that Dean would never see them. And it was fine. Dean and Benny started talking again. And Dean didn’t threaten Benny too much when he broke things off with Cas for another guy.
Castiel slowly inserts another finger and holds still again. “Dean, I can't hurt you. I could very easily tear something.” Dean snorts a laugh and pulls on Castiel's arm.
Cas interrupts, “Dean, I’ve been with guys before. Just because Benny and I… y’know… it doesn’t…”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas doesn’t know how long he waits it out hiding in the bathroom but eventually he hears Dean knock on his stall. “Hey Cas, Meg said you ran off? You ok?”
Dean blushes, "so girls, when I was sick, Cas had to help me. When he walked up behind me though, I ugh, jumped. I- um, I hit him in the throat. Yeah, that works." Dean laughs, "so hitting him left a bruise. Like they do."
Castiel doesn’t react when Meg dumps herself back into the chair beside him. “Saw you just staring off over here. Figured you needed to be checked on. I saw you leave with Max,” she wiggles her eyebrows. Castiel’s sigh breaks into yet another sob and she straightens up quickly. “What did he do? Where is he?”
Sam gets the same process of introductions of Aaron and Balthazar. He pulls Dean into a hug and whispers next to Dean’s ear, “you both are fucking idiots, still.” Before Dean can ask what he meant his brother leaves to help John grab two twin sized air mattresses from the basement.
Castiel blushes and shakes his head, “Dean we need someone to actually drive the boat. Some Captain I would be, to let the both of us die tragically.”
“Are you… Balthazar? Did I say that right?” He nods enthusiastically and she blushes, “it’s so nice to meet you. I’m Alicia. This is my brother, Max.”
Dean's mouth falls open, "where have you been all of my life? Yes, I love them."
He notices the one guy, Aaron, sitting at the front desk. Cas used to joke with Dean about Aaron. He was absolutely convinced Aaron had a crush on Dean. He knew from the way Aaron would interrupt whatever girl was speaking to Dean and try to interest him in a conversation between the two of them. He knew when Aaron invited Dean to dinner with him, to which Dean responded that he had plans but Aaron could join him and his friends the next weekend.
Cas feels a ping of sadness that she left him; just like someone else, but he’s not thinking of that right now. Instead he faces Max and holds his waist as he starts up dancing again. Max is happy for the turn of events and starts to grind down harder.
Dean stares at the remaining two family members and cringes. “You guys don’t care?”
Apparently it’s hard to have a giant gay panic attack when his alcohol is making everything feel fun and fuzzy. Even as Aaron is on his knees in front of Dean, Dean doesn’t care. It’s just a man. Nothing scary. Dean groans when Aaron takes him into his mouth and he gasps watching down at Aaron who’s feeling himself through his own jeans.
Cas wonders on that one. “I’m not really sure. I think I’m ok. I’m still heartbroken. But I think I’m also relieved. Not about being apart from him… never that. But I don’t know? Feels like I can breathe and say and do things without wondering if it’s going to make someone retreat from me.” He feels guilt for having those thoughts, too, but it’s helping to say them all out loud so he can stop carrying them inside. “I’m okay, Charlie.”
He finds Jo and Charlie; who are recently together, dancing in the crowded dining room and Dean feels bad for interrupting a moment like that so he tries to find someone else.
When he leaves the bathroom he stumbles back to the line of tables behind the open dance floor and waits for his friends. He knows; hopes, they’ll find him here because it’s the same table they started at. And the only reason he could tell the exact table is because of the glowing green palm tree light in the center.
