“He should be allowed to take all the time he needs,” he said.  “I need to be the one to wait him out.  He’ll fight it, but he needs the reassurance that I’m still here for him, that my relationship with him has not altered.”
John’s eyes flicked open, and he turned to Sherlock with an expression of amusement.
He’d been doing the washing up they’d left sitting in the sink from breakfast, needing to occupy his mind and his hands.
“They’re going to be okay,” Greg said.  “We may be grizzled Daddies, but we’re on their side.
“Oh, is your
Sherlock’s eyebrows furrowed as he looked over at his little brother.  Bunny didn’t look any different than he usually did.  He wasn’t wearing girl clothes, like he sometimes did at night when he put on nightgowns or his Little Mermaid nightshirt, and his mannerisms weren’t any different than what Sherlock was used to.  He just seemed like regular old little Bunny.
Mycroft told him he was a good boy.  “We don’t throw things, because we might hurt someone,” he explained.  “There are better ways to deal with our feelings than to act out.”
“Cruelty does not suit you, Sherlock,” he said, unable to keep his voice from slipping into something more paternal.
?” John could not help but ask sarcastically. “Never.”
It was clear the boy needed some comfort at the moment, and Mycroft knew he must be uncomfortable considering he had wet himself roughly twenty-five minutes ago.  But the boy was afraid, and Mycroft did not want to jar him by forcing him out from under the desk before he was ready.
“Thank you, Sherlock,” John said, reaching for the man's hand.  “Unfortunately, I'm not sure it’s as simple as you understanding or supporting my choices.  My, ah...my new identification seemed to trigger something in Mycroft.  A very real worry about how to introduce the topic to you.  Greg was prepared to take me away to Baker Street for the night.”
“I don’t want you to do that,” he said.
“His skin is ice cold but he’s been sweating and says he’s warm,” Daddy said, lifting Bunny back into his arms and handing him Willa the rabbit.  “I think he may have a low-grade fever.”
“Uncle Greg needs a bit of a break,” he said, placing his hands against his lower back as he stretched against the tightness there.  “I’m going to go help Grandma get dessert ready.”
“Of course,” Sherlock said, not bothering to look up from his mobile, fingers typing quickly.
“But the words you used today were unfair and very painful,” he said.
“That’s enough, Ma,” Greg said, eyebrows raised as he chuckled at her brazenness.
“After breakfast, kid,” Papa said, and Sherlock, frustrated, pushed himself away from the table until his chair was leaning backwards, then released so that it fell back into place with a thump against the tile floor.
Mycroft hummed his agreement.
“Two.”
“I know this is hard, Bun,” Papa said as he rocked him back and forth where he stood.
Sherlock shook his head, which he'd rested against his raised knees before closing his eyes.  Mycroft sighed, then reached across his brother to find the seatbelt himself.
It was amazing how much Greg had learned about Mycroft from seeing him care for his brother and John Watson.  There was a softness to him not apparent to those he interacted with on a daily basis, an understanding of the world of his brother that spoke to nothing but unconditional, ever-growing love.  If it hadn’t been for Mycroft’s astute observations, his clear understanding of the thoughts and desires of the boys--with the rare exception of his shortcomings regarding John’s princess desires--the entire weekend would have more than likely disintegrated into chaos and an emotional turmoil they may not have been able to overcome.
This chapter was tricky for me to write, but I think I'm okay with the results! :)  A bit of angst on Sherlock's part, but mostly just cute fluff as Mycroft (and then Greg) show up to care for their boys.
It was a gray day, cloudy and cold even for London in December, and Sherlock pulled his coat tight around him as he hugged his knees.  Mycroft blasted the heat, knowing his brother would become moodier if he were uncomfortable and hoping the man might settle into sleep once the shock of being pulled from a warm bed and out into a cold car had been driven from his bones.
“What has you the most confused?” Mycroft asked.  “It’s for the best if we begin there.”
It was the same configuration John and Mycroft sat in when they were discussing John’s ageplay needs or concerns (Mycroft had insisted, even as John assured him he didn’t need his own set of parameters), and at least John felt a bit better knowing that it truly had been Mycroft who had sanctioned this, not Sherlock.  Only Mycroft would know to tell Greg where he should sit to make John feel the most comfortable about expressing his feelings.  Here was Mycroft, helping from afar.  John sighed, but sat in his regular spot on the far side of the table.
Greg did not mention his hope that, should John stay, they could ease the Doctor back down into some semblance of headspace.  It was clear John had been pulled rather abruptly out of headspace, and Greg knew he himself hadn't exactly helped in that area.
I'm going to call this the last chapter of Little John and Uncle Greg so I'm not left with the same problems going forward and will be forced to updated Weekend and then just move forward from there.  If you catch any other issues with Weekend that no longer fit/make sense now that Chapter 4 of this story is up, PLEASE don't hesitate to let me know--I think I caught everything in the second edit, but I'm sure there are a few things that I missed!
He paused in undressing Greg only to trail his tongue and lips along the man’s stomach, sending the Detective Inspector into stifled laughter when his most ticklish spots were found.  They were breathless even before they were naked, hands roving and bodies pressing against each other, thrusting in desperate need.
“I don’t want it,” Sherlock said.  But his voice was quiet; he knew Mycroft meant what he’d said, nevermind Sherlock’s guilty conscience.
“John?” He asked, voice probing and now a bit confused, likely having registered the fact that a grown man was carrying around a plush toy.  “Everything alright?”
They were driving a moment later, then in and out of the car as they chased leads that Greg mumbled information about in snippets.  John attempted to be useful.  He took notes and asked questions when it seemed appropriate, hoping to help Greg process and brainstorm.  But he was exhausted after the tumultuous night of nightmares and panic attacks, half-distracted and, after two hours, beginning to count down the time until they could be back home.  John could no longer deny that he hadn’t truly been ready to follow Greg to the crime scene; alone in the car with Greg, he could feel the facade of strength and toughness slipping.  He would never admit it out loud, but he wanted to be small.
Now, however, Mycroft wasn’t so sure Sherlock would last that long.  There was an edginess to Sherlock that he’d seen far too often, an edginess that meant Sherlock was already fighting headspace.
Greg hurriedly checked each of the surrounding aisles, calling John’s name with as much nonchalance as he could.  He didn’t need overbearing store employees to swarm down on him asking if he’d lost a child, because he wasn’t sure how he would even answer such an inquiry, and he didn’t want to scare John in case the boy was worried he’d be in trouble.  Both boys knew they were never to wander off when they were little and not in a safe space.
“Cold, huh?” Mycroft asked, peering down at his half-naked form.
Sherlock hummed and took a moment to contemplate John’s question.
Sherlock had absolutely no intention of letting Papa out of his sight anytime soon.  He latched onto Papa’s hand when the man helped him to his feet, and pressed against his side as they made their way to the hallway loo, where Papa set about running a bath.
“Should we change the baby into something more comfortable?” Greg whispered, but Mycroft shook his head.
But the boy was not in the aisle.
There was pain in Mycroft’s expression, but he glanced across the kitchen towards the table, where Sherlock sat mumbling to himself happily and scribbling looping lines in crayon inside a dinosaur coloring book.
John knew Greg couldn't invite himself and John back to his brother's house prematurely.  Even so, he felt his patience waning.  He’d been good all day; he’d waited out in the cold for hours and then he’d been big and polite and had done nothing but smile as he met too many new people and watched Greg’s nieces and nephews play and climb on
“Pacifier?” Mycroft said over Bunny’s head as he caught Greg’s eye, barely more than a mouthing of words, and Greg, nodding, carried Sherlock into the kitchen where he knew there was a package of new pacifiers in the cabinet.  Bunny’s favorite pacifiers were upstairs, but it was perhaps best that he get the kid a new one, as Bunny tended to favor one or the other of his stand-bys depending on gender.  Greg found a white pacifier with green stars on it, what looked to be the least gendered in the package, and carried it back to the living room.
John shook his head.  “Says it’s for girls,” John mumbled, cheeks pinking.
“Is that what you want, baby?”
“Oh, sweetheart, you’re no trouble at all.  Everyone needs a good cry now and then, yeah?”
But Lestrade was seated in Sherlock’s arm chair, watching a football game on the telly.  And when John swung the door open, Lestrade turned to glance at him, his face warm and inviting, and some of John’s irk slipped away.
“John, listen to me,” Mycroft said, reaching across the table to pat John’s hand as a way to get his full attention.  “I know you'll think my words childish, but it really was just an accident.  It isn't the end of the world.  And it definitely didn't make you a bad kid.  It actually just made you a kid, which you were at the time.”
“You were in headspace,” Mycroft reminded him, wishing the man would not beat himself up so consistently.  “You made so much progress today.  I wish you wouldn’t blame yourself for something that happened while you were young.”
Mycroft sighed.
Once hair had been washed and the boys were done playing, Mycroft wrapped them in oversized towels and brought them to Sherlock’s bedroom, the room they shared when in headspace.  The boys shared Sherlock’s bed, but each had their own twin-sized comforter covered in childish patterns: Sherlock had a dinosaur comforter and John had chosen butterflies, which Sherlock teased for being too girly until Mycroft threatened to take away his dinosaur quilt.  Mycroft had recently ordered a new comforter for John, a Harry Potter pattern which he thought, now that they had begun to read the books, John might even prefer over his butterflies.
John set his face as he stared at Mycroft.  It was sometimes easy to forget that Mycroft could be just as smug about his own innovations of thought as Sherlock.  The man seemed to sense the judgment in John’s gaze, and set his tone of voice back to sincerity.
“Come here, brave boy,” he said, sitting on the end of the bed and opening his arms so that Bunny could scramble into his lap.  A bit of urine hadn’t hurt either of them in the past, and, even if it had, at the moment Bunny could not think twice about cuddling as close as possible to Daddy.  “I’ve got you, baby. It’s alright.  Daddy’s here.”
“He had an accident,” Sherlock mumbled after some time, voice quiet and shy.
“You're smarter than you look sometimes,” he said.
Greg scoffed, a bit taken aback by the weight in Mycroft’s voice.  Everyone had family members they’d rather not remember, memories wrought with pain and suffering.  It didn’t mean a lifetime of deep, dark secrets must be maintained.
Bunny breathed a quiet laugh, and Greg carded his fingers through the boy’s hair.  It was longer than usual given the relentless pace of cases that had kept him and Sherlock from anything not crime-related for quite some time.
But John could not waste energy deducing what may or may not be true.  He had a sleepy boy to take care of, one who had earned himself a great many more bedtime stories than was reasonable.
He’d come to determine that the best course of action was to let Sherlock’s deductions--however off-base or scattered--become truth.
"Do you remember when we were kids and you went to science camp for the summer and, when you came back, you had a pen pal from Australia?" Sherlock asked.  "Some science nerd you'd grown attached to during the weeks you were pretending to be enthused by examining astrological patterns?"
“You used your Papa Greg voice on him.”
Greg hugged him back, and he soon had a content boy by his side once more.  They wandered through the food section to pick up what Mycroft had requested, spent some time in the toy section where Bunny finally decided on two toys for Sherlock: a dinosaur baby book for while he was feeling little and a new pirate-ship Lego set for when he was feeling like a big boy again.  Bunny was amazed to hear that his nightgown did not count as his surprise, and quickly picked out a paper doll set for himself that he’d been lusting after while wandering to find the right toys for Sherlock.  Greg knew they wouldn’t make it out of the toy section with only three toys, and he couldn’t help but place the soft, floppy bunny plush that John kept gravitating towards into the cart along with a red, long-necked dinosaur plush toy that Bunny said would be a perfect friend for Sherlock’s current dinosaur, Dimitri.
Greg stood and then lifted Sherlock into his arms.  It was nice to be carried, but it made Sherlock think about how often Mycroft lifted John because he was easier to carry, and that made Sherlock sadder.  He lay his head against Greg’s shoulder and suddenly just wanted to sleep.
“Ballet instructor.”
“Not a baby,” he insisted, pressing himself against his Daddy, who was running his fingers along his spine.
“‘M sorry, Daddy,” Bunny said, looking down in shame.   “Didn’t mean to.”
“Bun, jammies are not an option outside of the house,” Mycroft said.  “Besides, it’s too warm outside for long sleeves, silly goose.”
“When did it start?” Sherlock asked.
“Want Mycroft,” John said.
“B-but what ab-about S-Santa?” the boy managed, Mycroft grateful he’d had so much practice deciphering tearful concerns with Sherlock but feeling a stab of guilt over what he’d said to the boy about fibbing.  How could he have misread the situation so egregiously?
“Look at my picture, Daddy,” Bunny called as Papa and Daddy crossed over towards the table with refreshed mugs of tea.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow towards John.
“No nap,” he said half-heartedly.  “Not a baby.”
Sherlock glared, then turned and retreated into his bedroom.
“You’re wet,” he said, surprised when his fingers brushed Sherlock’s pull-up before the consulting detective could shift his hips away.  “When did that happen?  Greg made us pee before bed.”
Mycroft waited until John glanced up at him.
Mycroft caught John’s eye from where the doctor sat updating his blog across the living room.
“You’re a bunny, you’re a bunny, you’re my bunny,” John whispered to himself the way Mycroft sometimes had to when John got extra upset and could not keep himself from a panic attack without comfort and reassurance.
“That’s it,” Mycroft said, changing lanes and taking the next exit.
“But what if I feel like a boy again tomorrow?” Bunny was pulling at his bottom lip, clearly nervous.
Greg assumed Sherlock had not done much washing up, so he found a washcloth and began bathing the boy, making quick work of it and choosing to forego washing his hair.
Sherlock glanced up at Mycroft with his eyebrows furrowed, taking his thumb out of his mouth.
“Everything okay, Bun?” Mycroft asked as the kid pressed themself close, and Bunny nodded, slipping a thumb into their mouth.
One night, years ago, he’d come home from rugby practice to find his father’s hand around his mother’s throat.  John had shouted and clawed as his father pushed her against the wall, hand teasing against her windpipe until he finally let her go and, turning swiftly, back-handed John across the face in anger.

“I'm going to put a call in to Donovan,” Greg said, slipping his hand into his pocket for his mobile.  “Get Anderson and the forensics team out here."
John’s anger was seething as he did what he could to wrestle out of Greg’s grasp on his shoulders, but he found himself unable to respond to Greg’s anger with his own.  He merely glared at the man, conscious of his heightened adrenaline dying down as Donovan calmed Anderson and set the others back to work in the motel room.
, Greg texted a moment later.
“Rules,” Sherlock mumbled, referring to Mycroft’s rule of a pull-up after an accident.
John was speaking honestly.  Despite the harrowing events of the morning and afternoon, the day had ended on a comforting note.  He felt content, pleased to know they still had a full day and a half at the lake house, that he could be little again whenever he chose.
They had finished a case three days before--triple homicide, hospital janitor--and Sherlock had since not been able to feel anything but aimlessness and a loss of purpose.  John had been doing all he could to distract Sherlock.  The trip to the pubs last night had been the last of his numerous attempts.  Sherlock went along with John’s plans because he knew John was simply trying to help, because he wanted John to feel the usefulness and sense of purpose that was sorely lacking from Sherlock’s own mindset.  But John’s distractions were only momentary bandages, and Sherlock could not help but feel the stab of frustration.   Without his phone to help him scroll through for potential cases, Sherlock could not help but feel the desire for drugs and solitude in some grimy drug den eating away at him.
His brother hadn’t bothered to yank down his underwear, but the cotton briefs did nothing to protect against Mycroft’s heavy hand.  He writhed on Mycroft’s lap, feeling tears spill over onto his cheeks as he struggled against the welcomed pain.  For a brief few minutes, he was outside of his mind, nothing but pain and remorse and the promise of eventual comfort.
“Okay, Daddy,” he said, reaching once more for his beloved mermaids.  “But I’m a boy right now, okay?”
“If it’s alright with you, I’ll stay in Sherlock’s room in case he’s still in headspace when he wakes up.  I’m not sure you’re quite prepared for little Sherlock on your own.”
“That’s how it works with us," Mycroft said. "And that’s just fine by me.”
"John," Sherlock said, almost begging.  "I'll explain later.  Please."
Mycroft took another sip of coffee--he generally preferred tea, but coffee provided him with a bit more stabilization, something Greg knew--and stood from his chair.  He leaned across the table to kiss Greg.
“I’ll finish up here as soon as I can and meet you at yours,” Greg said, for which Mycroft was grateful.  “And, Mycroft, I wouldn’t be surprised if I just happen to find the boys already tucked into their beds when I get home.”
John smiled sideways at Sherlock’s joke.
Greg had grown quite close to Sherlock, had begun to understand the man’s younger self just about as well as anyone.  But this was a family matter, and it had the potential to impact Sherlock’s adult state of mind just as greatly as his younger.  Only Mycroft had the full subset of knowledge necessary to anticipate the myriad ways Sherlock may be affected.  He needed to be alone.
Mycroft ran his hand slowly against Sherlock’s bum, soothing the reddened skin as he always had after he’d spanked Sherlock as a child.
Papa and Daddy shared a look as Daddy placed Bunny in his seat next to Sherlock and pushed his chair closer to the table.  Papa had made blueberry pancakes, and he kissed Bunny on the side of the head as he put a Lion King plate of them down in front of him.
“Those things don’t matter, love,” Mycroft said, cupping Sherlock’s cheek when the boy leaned back to look up at him.  “You’re a special boy no matter what, and I love you always, no matter your behavior or the state of your trousers.”
“Sherlock,” he warned, suddenly sober and serious.
“He didn’t want to be there,” Mycroft said.  “I forced him even though he asked for us to go home.”
"Sherlock?" It was John, glancing up from where he sat in the living room with a newspaper spread in front of him.  The local news was on John’s laptop, volume playing softly, and a broadcaster was speaking of Sherlock's most recently solved case, which was just beginning to develop within the media.  "Where the hell have you been?"
“He thought we might all find some time to spend together next week,” Sherlock continued.
It had been a rather trying day, and now that he had aged up, John felt nothing but tired and confused, angry at himself for actions he had never fully thought through.
They sat in comfortable silence, John feeling himself dozing, content in the shared warmth of Sherlock’s bed as he watched the stars from the rotating night light move slowly along the ceiling.  Eventually, they shifted beneath the sheets and blankets, John pressing himself against Sherlock’s back, spooning him.  His face was pressed against the back of Sherlock’s neck, and the man’s curls smelled like the baby shampoo Greg used on them when they were small.  John let his hands lazily wander, hoping to soothe his insomniac boyfriend into a semblance of relaxation.
“Like Sherlock on long car rides?” John asked.
“No,” he shrugged.  “I can just tell.  Right, Bunny?”
John snorted a laugh, then caught Greg’s chuckling, and they laughed until they were breathless as Greg once more took hold of his elbow to lead him inside.
“But I don’t want to make Sherlock sad, Papa,” Bunny said.
“What do you want?” Sherlock asked when his eyes found the Bunny’s cowering form in the doorway.
“I was afraid you wouldn’t want to…” John hesitated.  “To be my caregiver, anymore.  So I’ve been stifling it when I catch myself.  But we’ve had such a stressful few days, what with Sherlock finding out about the Daddy/Bunny development.  And I’ve been more worried and nervous than I think I even realized--trying to process these thoughts and the idea of being more open around Sherlock.”
“Of course you do,” Sherlock said nonchalantly.
Let me know what you'd like to see as the weekend at the lake progresses for these guys--I definitely use ideas left in the comments in the chapters and stories.  The super sweet Sandrina gave me the idea of jealous little Sherlock (thanks, Sandrina!), which happened to fit really well when I was wondering how Sherlock would find out that Mycroft has become John's Daddy.  And there are many other ideas you guys have given me that are bouncing around in my mind and will be incorporated when I find the right way to do so in the course of the narrative :)
“Stick out your tongue,” he said.
He balled up the sheets and carried them to the hallway bathroom, where he placed them into the washing machine and began the wash cycle.
Sherlock had turned back to cartoons after accepting the pacifier and his stuffed alligator, both of which Mycroft had held out to him sometime during their conversation with Bunny.  His alligator had been given to him as a consolation for Mycroft taking away Dmitri the dinosaur, who had gotten a bit worse for wear during Sherlock's messy eating.   Sherlock stopped his whining only when Mycroft assured him Dmitri would be back in no time, and he returned his attention to the telly.  But his focus was pulled away once more when Bunny next spoke.
“He was only nineteen the first time,” Mycroft explained, “struggling to live away from home, to fit in at university where he stood out for his pedantic speeches in class and withdrawn nature in the dorm rooms.
“And then all the animals like the frog mommies and daddies catch diseases and pass them on to their babies,” Sherlock nearly shouted in his glee at being able to explain what he knew.  “And their babies and the fish are all failing and dying earlier than they’re supposed to.  And Mycroft, Bunny wants you to feed him.  And can we go see the frogs in the lake tomorrow?”
Mycroft paused when he saw his brother crouched to the floor of the kitchen, attempting to hide.  He squatted down onto his haunches so he was eye-level with the man.
He dropped the glass to the floor and stepped around to the other side of the bedroom.  He couldn’t face Mycroft.  Mycroft would take responsibility for Sherlock’s actions, would struggle to hide his disappointment and then blame himself.  He would think he’d failed Sherlock.
Mycroft tsked him, and guided him to stand in front of Bunny, who glanced up at him with nothing but hurt in his eyes.  Even Papa Greg looked upset.  It made Sherlock feel like crying again.  Usually, Mycroft or Greg helped Sherlock process his thoughts, helped him plan what he needed to say in an apology.  But he could see that Mycroft needed Sherlock to do this one on his own, that it was only by honestly processing his feelings that he would be forgiven.
“Sorry,” he mumbled, suddenly awkward.  He slid from Mycroft’s lap and dragged himself closer to the head of the bed, careful to avoid the dark wet patch of the sheets.  “Didn’t mean to wake you.”
Sherlock’s cheeks reddened once more, and he shook his head.
And then he was yelling, grasping at the puzzle before John could stop him from destroying the work he'd done.  He threw handfuls of puzzle pieces across the room, tearing pieces from where they had, moments before, sat snugly, interlocked in an organized pattern.
“That day, at the office.  He called his assistant in for some asinine task, just to keep me in check,” Sherlock continued.  “It was a power play, a way to show me he had ways of controlling my behavior."
“Close your eyes, little one,” Greg said when he caught Bunny in a yawn.  “It’s past your nap time and it’s been a long morning.  You could use the rest.”
“Papa?” He said into the darkness as he sniffled.  “Daddy?”
“Thank god they’re asleep,” he said in a whisper once they’d made sure the light in the hallway loo was on for the kids and had closed themselves in Mycroft’s bedroom.
Sherlock blinked down at the Bunny, who was still pressed against his chest, then huffed and turned away from him, pulling the sheet up and over his head.  It was as if Sherlock had forgotten he was supposed to be angry until Bunny had reminded him of the fact.
He was in so much trouble.
He stood and let Bunny cry, and, as Bunny wailed, he realized his tears were eventually driven not by sadness, but by relief.  He had been waiting for so long to dress like a princess and to tell his Daddy that he wanted to have accidents and be potty trained, maybe even longer than even Bunny had realized.  And now his Daddy knew his secrets, and it was all going to be okay.
Mycroft could not help but allow the boy a bit of comfort.  He reached his arms around the boy, who pressed his face against his shoulder with a sniffle.
“No, baby,” Mycroft said, unable to keep from calling Bunny his baby when he was looking at him with such adorable innocence.  “They’re for Sherlock.”
“I’ll be back soon, princess,” Papa called over Bunny’s tears, reaching down to squeeze his shoulder in a makeshift goodbye, which only made Bunny cry more loudly.
He wouldn’t be surprised if Bunny didn’t talk to him ever again.
“Bunny, we can’t help you unless you’re honest with us,” Uncle Greg told him.
He could feel his control over his bladder slipping despite the fact that he was kneading at his crotch, and gasped into the pillow when he thought he may have leaked into the thick diaper.  But he ignored the threat of an accident, sniffled, and turned his face towards Papa, making tentative eye contact.
Mycroft shushed John, telling him everything would be okay.
Mycroft stripped him of the nightshirt when he complied, tossing the soiled garment into the laundry hamper before turning back to John, who could not keep from shifting where he stood as he waited for Mycroft's next instructions.  He was very conscious of that fact that he was naked except for the wet cartoon briefs clinging to his hips.
“It’s just that...well, adulthood is such a practice in the masking of old wounds,” Greg said, putting the thought into words for the first time.  “It can be nice to exist in a world where it isn’t shameful to deal in vulnerability.”
“Think the kid’s okay upstairs?” Greg asked as he refilled Mycroft’s tea cup.  They had finished a conversation about their schedules for the upcoming week, and Greg’s thoughts had expectedly shifted to Sherlock.  “He’s been struggling all day.”
There was no answer when Mycroft knocked, at least none that he could hear through the closed door, and so there was nothing to do but open the door and peer into the room.  Mycroft heard John’s sniffling immediately, could see the man hunched fully beneath the sheet on his bed.  His wet clothing had been left in a trail on the floor, as if he pulled items off one by one until he reached the safety and comfort of his bed.
Sherlock knew what Mycroft was trying to do.  He knew his brother used to get him to list the elements as a way of calming Sherlock’s mind.  The memories were there, in his mind palace: Mycroft rubbing his back and asking him to list the periodic table when they were kids after Sherlock had been woken up by a nightmare.  Sherlock thought about stating once again that he wasn't a little kid, but he was warm and comfortable with the Bunny leaning up against him, and he didn’t feel like he should wake up his little brother just to gain himself some more attention.  Besides, he did feel little at the moment, and, in the safety of the car with his little brother and his Mycroft and his Uncle Greg, that was okay.  So he closed his eyes and began listing the elements one by one until Mycroft called him a smart boy and he fell fast asleep.
Greg sighed.  He  wished he’d hugged the Bunny tighter; wished he hadn’t let the little one out of his sight.  But John would cling staunchly to adulthood for as long as he felt that Sherlock was in danger.  He retained a constant need to place his boyfriend before himself, and that was not a burden John was about to pass off to others.
“Ready to go downstairs?” he asked when Bunny was calmed.  “You, my little one, have a sticker to put on your chart and a movie to choose.”
“Good boy,” Mycroft said, patting John’s thigh to signal to him that he needed to get up from the bed so that they could get started.
Sherlock caught sight of what Mycroft was holding, and shook his head, glaring.
Thanks for your suggestions after the previous chapter--I'll keep them in mind!
“I love you too, brother mine,” Mycroft said when he’d finished.
The kid nearly smiled, sniffling as he reached for the colorful cup.
“I’ll explain when we have a moment,” Mycroft said, turning off the faucet and drying his hands on a dishtowel.  “It’s a rather delicate situation, although arguably one which I should have anticipated, given the direction things have been going with John.  I was ignoring the inevitability, ignorantly assuming we’d have more time."
“He’s afraid,” Sherlock said as Mycroft cleared John’s breakfast dishes beside him and began cleaning up the scattered bits of egg from the carpet.
John had not often imagined what Sherlock must have been like at uni, but the amount of challenges such a situation must have posed for Sherlock now seemed nearly insurmountable.
Sherlock knew as soon as Mycroft’s expression changed that he was in big trouble.  A part of him toyed with the idea of staying put in the office, of throwing a fit until Mycroft was forced to hang up the phone and deal with him instead of the boring people on the phone.  But there was another part of him that remembered the conversations Mycroft had long-ago had with him, back when it was just the two of them ageplaying, when Mycroft explained that there were times Sherlock couldn’t be selfish because there were other people counting on Mycroft’s help.
“You’re going?” he asked.  “After all that?”
Sherlock rushed over to John, who was quickly enveloped in a tight hug and kissed sloppily on the cheek.  John giggled; Sherlock rarely showed as much compassion or affection as John would have liked, so he hugged him back tightly and did not pull away until Sherlock kissed him one more time on the cheek and then returned to skipping around the room.
After a quick check to ensure Sherlock was content in front of the telly for the time being, he’d been forced to retreat into his office to argue with not one but two insubordinate government figureheads.  It was necessary to speak with them before he could even begin the task of putting out the figurative fires the secret service member had started with what Mycroft would ensure was the man's career-ending breach of protocol.  It was a high-stakes situation, but Mycroft would be lying if he said he didn’t enjoy the adrenaline rush.  Damage control of the highest degree was how he had moved into his position of power years ago; he thrived under the challenge.
“Do you want to tell me what’s been going on today, kiddo?” Mycroft asked, pulling the desk chair aside and crouching in front of the boy.
"Left my phone in the car," Greg said.  "You alright for a moment?”
But even Mycroft’s forward nature did not seem to shake John’s resolve to take care of his soiled briefs himself.  The man cleared his throat as he blushed at the mention of his accident, but held up a hand to signal that he did not need Mycroft to come any closer.
Bunny whimpered when a loud clap of thunder and the howling of the wind added to the fearful reverberations of a nightmare even too intense for adults.  What had been only light rain when the boys had fallen asleep had become a thunderstorm, one close-by judging by the sound of the thunder and the short gaps of time between booms and lightning.  Bunny was frightened.
Thank you for your comments and kudos, as always--you're all truly the best at encouraging and inspiring.
“Let’s drop it, alright?” John asked, pulling his mobile from his coat pocket to keep from having to look at Greg.  “I’d like to just forget it.”
“Hi, little bun,” Greg said, smiling as he brushed the hair from the boy’s face and held his dropped pacifier to his lips once more.  “Go back to sleep, love.  Christmas tomorrow.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"There we go," she said, pulling the blanket up to rest beneath his chin.  "No need for tears, right?"
But Mycroft continued until Sherlock had been spanked twenty times.  The detective was a snivelling mess when his brother was finished with him, heart pounding and hair mussed from where his head had thrashed against the car seat.
He was unsure how much longer he could wait out the rising panic, unsure if he could remain stoic and strong among the lingering images of death and chaos.  He had been huddled alone with his worst thoughts for hours, and it suddenly became too much all at once.  John could not breathe.  Rationally, he knew he had worked himself inadvertently into a panic attack, but practically, he felt that he was about to die.
"Damn," he said, voice causing Sherlock distress.  "These are too deep.  I'll have to take you to hospital."
After the night Greg babysat, John had been the one, following Mycroft's insistence that he needed to come to terms with this part of himself, to explain to Greg what he got from wetting himself, how he felt and how he wanted to continue the practice.  Greg had assured John, just as Mycroft had, that it was all fine.  But, if they were honest with themselves, both Mycroft and Greg were still attempting to decipher exactly what it meant that John wanted to explore wetting, exactly where the man's head was at, and exactly how they could best help John and meet his needs.  John’s accident in his pull-up that afternoon would not help matters; it had simply left Mycroft, and, he assumed, John, with more questions than before.
Mycroft and Greg had long since stopped suggesting to Sherlock that he play with the toys they had packed or color in the coloring books they had brought specifically for the car ride.  Their well-meant enthusiasm for what Sherlock could only see that morning as inane children’s toys and books had been met with swearing and eye rolls, and they did not want to risk waking the bunny.
The boy sat to pee, and Greg took the opportunity to strip him of his wet clothing, taking them to the sink to rinse.  He would hang the clothes in the guest room to dry and keep from having to ask his brother about a load of laundry, which he knew John would never allow him to do for fear of being found out.
“Can you tell me what happened today between you and Anderson, kiddo?” Greg asked, voice gentle as he rested his elbows on his knees to lean forward.
“Dr. Watson, could you come here, please?”
I'm going to go through and respond to comments (I've gotten so far behind--I apologize), but please know that I really appreciate everyone reading!
Mycroft sighed, beginning to piece together a tentative outline of events based on the snippets of Greg’s texts he’d caught while scrolling, the state of Sherlock’s bedroom, and a bathroom strewn with shrugged off clothes and bath toys.  He owed both Sherlock and Greg not only an explanation, but also, he was beginning to understand, an apology.
His brother nodded once more.  There was a moment when Greg worried he wouldn’t say anything else, that the conversation would be ended as it stood, a door pulled opened but left ignored, cold air streaming into a once-warm home.  But his brother shook his head and leaned back in his chair once more, a bit incredulous as he next spoke.
“I’m fine,” Mycroft said before reaching for the computer mouse.  “Ready for things to go back to normal once the holidays are finished.”
“What do you mean?” he asked.
“We don’t keep secrets in this household, Sherlock,” John said, a statement his now regressed boyfriend would heed in a way the adult Sherlock never could.  Truthfulness and lack of secrecy was an additional rule added by John, one that Mycroft would never have thought to include in the original arrangement between himself and Sherlock.
“You’re a good man, you know that?” he said.  “The kids are lucky to have you.”
“You’re not as aged up as you’d like to believe right now, Sherlock,” Greg said from the front seat.  “And even if you were currently adult, your behavior is unacceptable.”
“But Uncle Greg’s not anyone's brother,” Sherlock said, eyebrows furrowed.
“Eat up,” Greg said with a wink and a squeeze to his shoulder as he set a glass of bourbon before Mycroft and took his seat at the table across from him.  He began eating from his own plate of food.  “It’s too bad he’ll be aging up soon.  I was going to stop by tomorrow for some antics before I head into the station.”
"Sherlock?"
Mycroft’s presence and his permission for Sherlock to suck his thumb helped a bit, but Sherlock had slept fitfully, and the vulnerable feeling persisted into the early morning hours, when he was woken by Mycroft far too early, thighs cold and wet.
“Is that right, hon?” Mycroft asked, cutting up Bunny’s food into even smaller pieces than Greg already had and trying to get John to take hold of his superhero fork.
Bunny looked distressed, and once again hid his face in his hands with a whine.
John breathed in the chill quietude for a moment, then pulled his phone from his trouser pocket.  Harry’s mobile went straight to voicemail.
It was a relief when John was alone in the car with Greg.  Greg had guided him to the backseat, buckled him in, and swung around to the boot of the car before returning at John’s door with Willa.  John was amazed by how comforted and small he felt as soon as he had her in his arms.
Most of what had materialized that day seemed a passing fever dream now that his mind was free of the parameters of littlespace.  Since when did he act such a brat while little, ignoring anyone else’s needs except his own?  He had pushed Sherlock.  He had purposefully peed himself on the carpet.  He had told Mycroft he wasn’t a boy.  A frustrated blush crept to his cheeks as he stalked away from Mycroft’s stoop, shoving his hands into the pockets of his jacket and walking quickly, purposefully, needing to get away from Mycroft’s, needing space.
“I think maybe I’ll take a step back from the ageplay for a while,” John said once Sherlock had finished gloating.
“Goodbye, loves,” he said in a rush, going down the line to kiss Mycroft on the lips and then Sherlock’s head as he had Bunny’s.  “Myc, text me if you need anything.”
Sherlock could sense that Bunny needed comfort in the moment, so he held his stuffed alligator--which had been in his arm along with his dinosaur--towards his brother.  Bunny took it with gratitude, hugging it close, and Mycroft patted Sherlock again on the thigh to signal a job well done.  Sherlock did his best to accept the praise, fighting against the desire to squirm out of Mycroft’s lap.  He needed to focus on what felt nice, not on what the voice in his brain told him was needy behavior.
John breathed a laugh, surprised as always by Sherlock's antics, then ran a hand along the back of his neck.
“Papa told me to come sleep with you because Bunny was yelling,” he explained at last.
“Sherlock, buddy?” The voice called again.  “Come out here, sweetheart.”
“Oh, shush,” their mother said, hitting Mycroft softly on the arm with her dishcloth.  “Let your old parents enjoy their nostalgia, won’t you?  At least we're not insisting on reading you
It was strange to be in the space where Greg and his brothers had been children, where they’d raced and practiced footie and played at firefighters.  There was a wooded area about ten meters from the back porch, and John trekked through the rising snow, somehow knowing Greg would have gone exploring in the woods as a child and wanting to see all that had made Greg his caring, self-assured, quick-to-laugh self.
Hi lovelies! You're all the best, and your comments definitely inspired me to get this chapter finished sooner than planned!  I don't like leaving the boys (and all of you) without resolution!
“I couldn’t hold it,” Sherlock breathed when, at last, John could no longer feel a strong stream beneath his hand.  It was something Sherlock may have said in headspace after an accident.  Except, now, Sherlock was not shame-faced and small.  He was breathlessly excited, voice husky and rather prideful.
They drove in relative silence, Greg anticipating what he would say both to fill Mycroft in and to preempt the lecture the man would give him about taking John to the crime scene when he was so clearly not in the correct headspace.  He would take Mycroft’s chastising with a grain of salt and shift the man’s focus to the kids.  It was essential that they get to the bottom of what had been bothering John at the crime scene, of what had plagued him enough that he’d fought with Anderson, dropped into headspace, and then felt the need to wet his pants in the backseat rather than use the rest stop loo.
“Sherlock, he cares for you more than anything,” John said, hoping to temper the animosity in Sherlock’s voice.
John rolled his eyes and stood to pull Sherlock into a hug which Sherlock stood to accept but did not reciprocate.  Sherlock was not finished making his point, and the detective began speaking the moment John released him from the hug.
He crossed to the bed and took a seat on the end, then glanced over to Sherlock, who was clearly unsure of himself and still standing by the doorway.  It was clear an aged-up John was the last person he had expected to be entering his room after his outburst.
“Going to sleep, now,” he said.
“Good job being polite, sweetheart,” Mycroft praised when the little bunny asked politely for a refill of juice, holding out his sippy cup.
Mycroft had a fleeting thought that he should root through John’s closet to see if he could find the boy a pacifier, but he rationalized that, if the boy were truly feeling five years old, the thumb was a bit more apt, and he stayed put.  It was early enough that light was beginning to fill the room from the window he had forgotten to pull the shade back down over, and Sherlock was peaceful and quiet at last, nearly asleep already.
“It’s a coping mechanism,” he explained, and then, because he knew his brother was intent on sussing out Greg’s role in all of it: “It’s, ah, it’s nice to feel needed in that way.”
“You have to be a big boy for a few minutes,” Mycroft was reiterating as he attempted to close the office door between them, craning his neck to glance towards the ringing phone on the desk behind him.  “I’m dealing with people who do not like to wait, buddy.”
“He put you in time out for a really long time, you say?” Mycroft asked, eyebrow raised.
“Let’s take you for a quick wee, Bun,” Greg said, squatting down to be at the boy’s level where he sat hunched on the backseat.  He raised his arms towards the kid.  “Come with Papa.”
“Bun? What’s wrong, baby?” It was Daddy, suddenly in the doorway and flicking on the overhead light before hurrying towards the bed at the center of the room.
There was a cathartic release in the tantrum that had the initial effect of spurring him on, prodding him to expel the pent-up emotion he had been harboring all morning, and the later effect, once his body tired and his head began to ache from crying, of dropping him into an exhausted, pitiful sobbing, curled on the linoleum floor, vision blurred from tears.
Mycroft couldn’t help but breathe a relieved sigh.  The boy had seen Greg shopping for diapers, and had assumed they were for him, which had come as a blow to his self-confidence.  It was all just a silly misunderstanding.
Sherlock shook his head.
Bunny draped his blanket over his shoulders, careful to keep her as far away from his wet pajamas as possible while still keeping her warm fleecy side close against the back of his neck.
The words were not easy for Mycroft to say.  As much as he knew the dangers of Eurus, the idea of replacing her, the strain of having had to obliterate her from his associations with Sherlock, was trying.  He was not a man preoccupied with outwards shows of affection, but, somewhere, he did still care for Eurus.  Somewhere, he mourned the loss of their siblinghood.
Sending bunny kisses!
“I know, baby,” he said, voice quiet in the still dimly lit room.  “It’s no fun being sick.”
"Sherlock, I...do you want me to help you out of your wet things?"
Bunny shrugged, pulling at his bottom lip.
Bunny shrugged, pulling at their bottom lip.
John did not prolong the conversation.  He took the phone from his ear and, with a quick, “Yeah, alright,” hung up, hearing the girl give a pathetic “Happy Christmas” through the speaker before they disconnected.
Greg wouldn’t have had it any other way.  After the ordeals of the morning, there was nothing he wanted more than to know that Sherlock and John were safe in his arms, comfortable and cared-for, if only for the moment.
“I’ll get really big again, Myc,” he said quietly, staring at his knees.
Mycroft nodded.
“Bunny had a nightmare,” the boy said around the thumb in his mouth, curling up beside Mycroft and letting his head fall into his lap.
In the end, the decision was almost taken out of Sherlock’s hands.  With a yelp he felt himself lose a spurt of urine into the waiting pull-up.  He hunched over and pressed his hands between his legs to stop himself, but his face was flushed and his mind soothed by the slight indiscretion.  He wanted to lose himself completely; he needed the release.  It seemed that, once again, Mycroft had known what Sherlock needed before he even had known himself.
Mycroft straightened the sheets and comforter as he waited for his brother.  He kept himself from glancing at the clock.  He and Greg had cleared their schedule for the folloiwng day, which meant he would not be required to be at the office early, but he still wasn’t keen to keep a timed record of the amount of sleep he was losing.
Mycroft inadvertently slammed his shoulder into the door of 221b while attempting to enter, not used to the deadbolt being slid into place.  He had a few passing moments where he attempted to ascertain why the door would be locked, but quickly ignored his hypotheses in favor of getting to his Bunny.
“Hafta wee,” he finally admitted, voice loud and desperate.
“Daddy, too?” she asked, and Papa’s response was immediate.
“Fine,” he said.  “I want fish and I want puppies.”
“Is there anything on your mind, bud?” Mycroft asked.
Sherlock remained stoic while John patched him up, barely registering the sting of the disinfectant.
Among the mass of guests, Greg was been cheerful and light-hearted, clearly warmed by so many reunions with those he loved and who loved him.  Alone with John, he remained bright-eyed, but his tone had become serious.
It had been a bit of a gamble on Sherlock’s part, using baby-talk while they were anything but.  But Sherlock had a hunch John’s praise kink resided in the lack of approval he had received as a child, and given that most sexual desires were based on impulses from childhood, it was unsurprising that John moaned loudly enough at the comment, frotting against Sherlock’s hand involuntarily as he climaxed and came over the wet sheets, that Sherlock was compelled to shut him up with a kiss, worried Mrs. Hudson might complain.  He filed away the reaction, vowing to explore more in good time.
Mycroft shook his head without hesitation.  He did not want John to feel as if his desires were wrong or undesirable.  The man had clearly been torn up by these emotions for some time now.  He had contemplated confronting the man about these issues many times, but knew that, when it came to John, the man would only be able to process on his own terms.  Mycroft would not have been able to force him to talk if he hadn’t been ready.
Mycroft told Sherlock to spit out his toothpaste, and he did, then climbed into Mycroft’s arms, refusing to do anything else besides be put to bed.  He dozed through his final diaper change of the night--he’d been pretending to be smaller than he was; it only made sense that he’d use his diaper when he felt the need during the movie--and then settled into the blue and green bedroom, Bunny already asleep in the cot beside him.
“Okay.  We’re going to get started now.  I won’t leave you.”
Bunny dissolved into giggles and flushed cheeks, and the joy in his eyes as he looked at Mycroft was almost enough to make him doubt his inclination to stifle this aspect of the boy’s personality.  He vowed to  sit down with Greg and hear him out on the issue, to set a plan in place about how they would proceed.
“I did not,” Greg said, attempting to laugh off the accusation.
“What’s he on about then?” Mycroft asked over the sound of Sherlock’s shrieks.
It's been far too long since I've updated, and this was written fairly quickly (read: unedited--hope there aren't too too many typos!), but please enjoy!  Sending love to you all and thanking you for your kudos and comments.
Greg reached to cup a hand around the back of John’s head, grounding him and letting the kid know he was there for him.
He instructed the boy to take off his pants and wet pull-up while he retrieved some wipes from the bathroom, and after a quick clean-up and a few more words of encouragement, Mycroft had the boy over his knee.
“Of course, baby,” he said, massaging shampoo into the boy’s scalp.  “You’ll always be Papa and Daddy’s princess.  Whether you’re feeling like a boy or a girl.”
“You’d rather wet yourself than come inside to use the toilet?”
Bunny sniffled but nodded, unbuckling his seat belt and leaning across the center console until his head was resting on Greg’s chest.
It was when Bunny’s eyebrows furrowed in honest confusion as he glanced down to his lap before reaching to press against the soggy material between his thighs that Mycroft realized the boy truly hadn’t realized he was wet.  He’d assumed the boy had simply wet his pull-up by choice, deciding to watch the film rather than miss a key moment by going potty.  Almost as soon as they’d arrived at Mycroft’s, Sherlock had stood in the kitchen and peed into his pants, clearly uninterested in putting in the effort it would take to walk the few steps to the loo and using wetting as a way to settle further down into age.  Mycroft had assumed Bunny was of the same mindset, and now felt heartless for teasing the boy, no matter how good-natured it may have been.
Papa poked his head through the open doorway of Bunny’s bedroom while Mycroft was helping him step into his new underwear.  They were reinforced with extra fabric at the crotch--training pants, something Bunny would have argued against if he weren’t so happy with the ladybug pattern.
“Lunch, Sherlock,” John called, placing a plate of grilled cheese--crusts trimmed--next to a bowl of tomato soup at Sherlock’s spot at the table.
“Good,” Mycroft said, praising Sherlock’s honesty.
“I had an interesting conversation with Mycroft, today,” Sherlock had said a week ago, flinging himself into his armchair after barrelling into the previously quiet flat and shrugging off his coat, which he tossed onto John’s empty chair.
"You," he said.  "You."
Mycroft sighed.
The day before had been such a wonderful mix of cuddles and pacifiers and diapers and back rubs that Sherlock had been upset to see it end.  It had been quite some time since Sherlock had sunk that low, and he had gone to bed content, with fewer worries than he’d had in months, contemplating the idea that, although he had started the transition to an older boy, he may just let himself off the hook by allowing himself to go back down to being extra little for one more day.
“Now be a good little Bunny and hop along to Lestrade so I can talk to Mycroft,” Sherlock said with an eyebrow raised, eyes distant once more.
“Wearing a purple pull-up doesn’t make you a girl,” Mycroft said.  “You need sleep and you’re lucky I’m not putting you in the corner for peeing your pants when you know better.  Now, come here.”
“I don’t know, buddy,” Mycroft said, and it was quite possibly the most honest thing he’d said all day.
“What do the voices tell you and Papa?” the boy asked.
“Because it’s alright if...if you’re not.  That couldn’t have been easy to deal, especially for a child.”
"The salient point, John," he said, "is that he was not concerned her presence would unhinge me in any way at the time.”
He was not holding Bunny close or rubbing his back or stroking his hair the way Mycroft would have, but the sound of his voice rumbling in his chest against Bunny’s ear and the familiar comfort of their routine of sleeping next to each other was comforting.
John walked far, for hours, and found himself not back at Baker Street, but at the pub around the corner from the flat.  It was late-afternoon and thus the pub was quiet, only two other patrons besides the employees in the restaurant, regulars already deep into their pints.  John ordered an early dinner despite his lack of hunger so as not to group himself in with the local drunks when he ordered a pint himself.
This chapter is much longer than expected.  I thought about breaking it into two chapters, but the two parts build on each other so I eventually decided to keep them as one.  Hopefully it's all enjoyable!  This chapter is a mix of angst and comfort/cuteness and we've got a little wetting thrown in there for fun!  Thanks for those of you who have sent ideas about this story and please continue to do so--the boys have the lake house for an entire long weekend, and the narrative right now only goes through Friday afternoon, so there's lots more we can explore.
Bunny shifted, uncomfortable in the wet pull-up and too emotionally spent to argue with what Sherlock said.  He wanted Mycroft to clean him up and take him away so it could be just the two of them.  He wanted his lion and his blanket and his pacifier, and he felt tears falling again when he remembered his lion was still up in the attic and his blanket had needed to be washed.
John had blinked awake in the seat beside Sherlock as soon as the tantrum began.  He was now staring wide-eyed at Sherlock, pacifier bobbing up and down in his mouth as he sucked nervously, his lion clutched to his chest.
“I want it,” he whined, and Greg hugged him close.  He knew how attached the boy had gotten to his pacifiers, and he suddenly thanked his lucky stars that he would never have to actually wean the boy from a pacifier the way he would with a biologically young child.
"I promise I'll be there as soon as I can, kiddo," Mycroft said, sympathy in his voice.
Sherlock was in the living room in a second, pulling out the new toys Papa and Bunny had picked out at the store the day before, which included his new lego set.
“I’m not a baby,” Sherlock said, loudly, teeth gritted in one final attempt to prove his own resolve stronger than his brother’s.  “I won’t take a nap like the crybaby.”
There had to be diaper cream somewhere in Mycroft’s collection of toiletries; given his history of age play with Sherlock, it only made sense.  He was starting to think perhaps Mycroft kept the rash cream in the master bath when he came across a half-empty tube towards the back of the cabinet.  He smiled at Sherlock in relief, rash cream in hand.  Here was one problem he could solve.
Mycroft hung up the phone and immediately stood from his chair to cross towards Sherlock.
When Mycroft next spoke, it was to address Sherlock, not Bunny, so Bunny turned his face back into Mycroft's neck.
There was a moment where both Uncle Greg and Sherlock assessed John’s current wardrobe.  He was wearing his second favorite pair of pajamas.  They were not quite as babyish as his bunny pajamas--his favorite--but they were yellow and green and covered in lions like his favorite stuffed animal.  They were certainly not unobtrusive.
John smirked, rolled his eyes at Mycroft's insistence on tucking him in.  “Of course.”
“He’d started wetting the bed again, something we thought he’d outgrown when he was twelve except for his periodic slip-ups here and there."
Mycroft smiled down at him, obviously understanding that it was something Bunny wanted as well.
Mycroft drummed his fingers against the edge of his rocks glass.  Greg got out of his chair and crossed to the man, stepping close and wrapping an arm around his waist from behind.  He was no longer able to ignore the worry--perhaps the fear--hidden behind Mycroft’s eyes.
“Get some rest,” Mycroft said as he closed the door to the bedroom.  “I’ll be just downstairs if you need anything.”
He found his kid in the farthest aisle of the toy section, surrounded by super hero action figures and plastic army men, toys Bunny generally steered far clear of.
“Mycroft
Bunny beamed up at him, obviously relieved that he really could be a boy and a princess and a mermaid like Ariel.
“Won’t be able to tell if I’m big,” he said, voice little more than a whisper in Mycroft’s ear.
But Sherlock was not responding to his conjectures, no longer listening.  The consulting detective was deep in thought, already in the midst of his mind palace.
He patted Bunny on the leg to signal that he needed him to stand up, then led him to the green desk beside the bureau, gesturing for the kid to sit.  Trusting that Mycroft had stocked the kids’ desks when he’d first set up the rooms for their little selves, he rummaged in the drawers until he found a pad of paper and a ladybug pencil, which Bunny gasped at, clearly unaware that such a colorfully fun item had been inside his desk all along.
“I’ll stop at the next service station,” Mycroft said when he noticed the way Sherlock’s kicking of the footwell was accompanied by a tell-tale fidgeting.
By the time he stood from the bench to lift his bag, Greg was out of the car and already jumping the steps to meet him on the platform.  He immediately wrapped his arms around John, who, despite having spent the last hour and a half amping himself up towards being big, collapsed into Greg’s embrace.
“I am a big boy,” Sherlock huffed, and Mycroft only hummed noncommittally.
Greg disliked spanking the boys, but he knew even Bunny’s inevitable puppy-dog eyes and tearful apologies would more than likely not be enough to convince Mycroft that wandering away in the store did not warrant a spanking.
John cleared his throat and stood from the table.
Greg’s mum was paused at the entrance to the room, a stack of plates carried in front of her and a dishtowel flung over her shoulder.  John sat up straight, letting his knees fall as his feet dropped to the floor.  He blinked his eyes rapidly in an attempt to keep them from looking watery.
He ran a finger along his bottom lip, trying to make himself feel young enough to want to suck his thumb.  He’d refused comfort from both his Daddy and Papa after his spanking--closing himself in the bedroom closet and refusing to come out until they’d threatened a second spanking--but, as he struggled to age back down, he regretted that he hadn’t allowed their offered care.  A bit of coddling may have been just what he needed to settle him back down.
John breathed a laugh and kissed Sherlock once more, grateful to have the man back in his arms, grateful for the way in which his guilt had settled, at least for the moment.
“Sherlock, can we talk?” Greg asked through the crack in the doorway.  He had to bite his tongue against the nicknames--bud, buddy, kid, champ--that were desperate to be spoken as a means of comfort and coddling.  Sherlock is not little, Greg told himself.  He needed to shift his tactics.
They certainly hadn’t made it easy.  Bunny thought for the first time that maybe even Daddies got a bit overwhelmed from time to time, especially if they didn't have their Papas to help.  He glanced towards Sherlock, who looked small and nervous, then took his Peter Rabbit pacifier out of his mouth.
“Saturday morning cartoons?” Greg asked as he wandered into the kitchen and took a full plate from Mycroft, eyebrow raised.
Greg smiled and, reaching into the shopping bags he’d earlier dropped off by the sliding glass doors, pulled out the plush bunny John had seemed instantly attached to at the store.  He yanked the tag from the fuzzy ear, then tossed the toy across the table.  Mycroft caught it.  Greg reached in again and found the Little Mermaid nightgown, which he also passed over to Mycroft.
“Uncle Greg is heading to the store to pick up a few things,” he said once Sherlock was free of the horrible washcloth.  “He thought you might like to go with him, Bunny.”
Bunny sniffled again, then giggled when Greg gently tickled their side, nodding that they were ready.  Greg hefted Sherlock onto his hip once more--allowing him to keep the plastic frog in order to prevent a strop--and took Bunny’s hand to guide them downstairs to the living room.  Greg could see that Mycroft was impatient, that he thought Greg had taken far too much time with the kids to make watching a movie before bedtime even marginally feasible, but Greg somehow communicated through a look that he was sorry and that there were circumstances out of his control, and Mycroft settled.
"John, tell him..."
“I think your brother is just a bit too little right now to apologize, Bun,” Daddy said, relenting and guiding the bottle back to Sherlock’s lips.  “Can you be a big boy and wait a little while for an apology?”
“Get some sleep, my little princess,” he whispered, and Bunny nodded, nuzzling up against Sherlock, who was sleeping peacefully.
“If you need--” Greg started.
Mycroft sighed and looked at Uncle Greg, this time with his eyebrows raised.
“John,” Mycroft said,  “It may not be apparent, but I gain as much from ageplay as does Sherlock.  And it seems to me I’d very much enjoy caring for you.”
John seemed to relax a bit at Sherlock’s nickname, which Sherlock indeed had used in order to tell the man it was alright for him to stay small.
Sherlock nodded.  His thumb slipped back into his mouth as he yawned and lay his head down on the pillow.  He reached up with his free hand to continue to trace the lines of the mermaid's fins.
“Couldn’t get the knot undone in time,” he said.  “I went in my pants by accident, but then I couldn’t tell because I didn't want anyone to know I put on a pull-up.”
When he turned the corner and stepped into the kitchen, he knew immediately that Sherlock--sitting still with his elbows on the table, fingers steepled before him--was deep in thought.  There would be no point in disturbing him before he’d worked out the current chain of contemplation, so Mycroft pulled out a chair and settled down to wait.  John hovered in the doorway, clearly attempting to keep his distance.
“He’ll be just next door, little one,” Mycroft said as he smiled down at him.  “And Uncle Greg and I will be just across from you in our bedroom.”
“I don't want to be tied up, Sherlock,” Bunny whined before breaking down into a sneezing fit once more.  He rubbed his nose against his shoulder because his hands were tied behind him.
As Sherlock prattled on about the Blue whale--Phylum: Chordata, Class: Mammalia, Order: Cetacea--Bunny tried not to shift too much on the bed.  He yawned, ready to fall asleep in the familiar comfort of Sherlock’s shared space.  But there was a pressure low in his tummy, distracting him.
“Love you, kiddo,” he said.
There was no use trying to text back.  If he was going to put things right, he needed to read John’s facial expressions, his body language.  He needed to see the man and reassure him in a way that he wasn’t able to from afar.
But Papa only reached forward to brush the hair from his forehead and tell him that the medicine would kick in to make him feel better soon, then pushed himself from the table to answer his mobile when it rang.
Bunny took Sherlock’s hand and squeezed it.  Sherlock turned and smiled gratefully; John’s goodness shone through even when the man was in headspace in the same way that Sherlock knew his selfishness and irrationality shone through when he himself sunk down.  He wished he were better behaved, wished he didn’t feel such a blinding desire to act out and strop.
Bunny started when Sherlock was spanked, and Greg shushed him, helping him step into his swim trunks and tying the drawstring around his waist.
“Uncle Greg is mean,” is what Bunny said, repeating what he had mumbled a moment before.  His cheeks flushed, as if he were nervous about his words.
“Ponies, Daddy!” he said, tugging on his Daddy’s sleeve with a smile.
Sherlock settled almost the moment he was in Greg’s arms.  Distress still played around the corners of his eyes, but he was, miraculously, no longer in danger of tears.  Greg took the pacifier from the boy’s hand and, after Sherlock made his way through a rather gaping yawn, offered it to the boy, who took it into his mouth eagerly.
“Verbal answer, please,” Mycroft prompted.
Mycroft’s voice was even and gentle.
Bunny could feel his reddened cheeks, but he could also feel the haziness of his mind, a serene pleasure that came from knowing his biggest worry at the moment was how he was going to find a clean pair of pants.  His adult thoughts were floating somewhere in another time and place, but it was a time and place that had little to do with the kid he was with Papa, Daddy, and Sherlock.
“I’m alright, I’ll--”
at their parents’, who was Mycroft to stand in his way?  He had made assumptions for Sherlock and had dictated how he was to behave, and that was not his place when Sherlock was out of headspace.
This version of Bunny had her own opinions and ideas, was excited by the prospect of sharing them loudly and of taking things into her own hands in order to see them come to fruition.  This version of Bunny wasn’t about to let others call all the shots, and Sherlock realized with a jolt of cold fear that he was no longer in control.
“Just a quick one,” he said, using a stern voice to ensure Sherlock knew not to argue back.
.  The roles had never been so fully reversed as they were now, and although Sherlock more than enjoyed John's dominant streak when it emerged, he was intrigued by the way in which he'd been able to settle John down into submission, had been content and aroused watching John squirm.
“Sherlock, Mycroft cares for you very much,” Papa said, and Sherlock already knew that.  He didn’t need a reminder of that fact at the moment, didn’t need Papa emphasizing just how much Sherlock had screwed up.
Greg knew he would need to get to the bottom of the situation, but standing in the toy aisle of a store, in earshot of strangers, was not exactly the ideal place to do so, particularly given John’s tendency towards moodiness when hungry, and the fit he had thrown earlier that morning.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft warned.  Sherlock reluctantly showed his face once more and removed his thumb from his mouth, wiping his eyes against his forearm.  He could not help but glance towards John every few moments; it was clear he was distressed that the man was there.
“Silly Daddy, silly Daddy,” he chanted in a sing-song, letting Greg help him wash his hands.  “Silly Uncle Greg.  Silly Sherlock.”
“But you know it’s against the rules to use your fists instead of your words,” Greg admonished, knowing he needed to turn to the task at hand no matter how much he was dreading it.
“Good boy,” he said, “you’re still dry,” and Sherlock blushed so hard he could feel his face warming.  His bladder had been full for some time now, and the need to pee combined with his brother's praise was almost enough to slam him down into a young headspace right then.  But he pulled himself back up; he wasn't ready just yet.
And, as Sherlock was carried upstairs to be cleaned up and dressed in a diaper and his most comfortable pajamas, he felt the plaguing guilt shifting away.  For the moment, all was strong hands and stuffed animals and the prospect of being fed a warm meal, and Sherlock was bundled up, content.
Sherlock sat up and crossed his arms.
“The Bunny doesn't look too good,” Greg said with concern in his voice, glancing across the room at John, who was not playing but sat hugging his lion to him and sucking on his pacifier as he watched Sherlock build with Legos.
When John blinked awake on the cot in Sherlock’s bedroom, he was in a transition space between big and little.
Bunny nodded and hid his face against Willa the rabbit, who hadn't been out of Bunny's arms for more than a moment since they'd left the car.
“It was obviously never sold!” Sherlock said to the mobile.  “Opportunistic brother-in-law taking advantage of his sister’s predisposition for half-witted men.”
“It was just an accident, and accidents happen to everyone.  I’m not mad and Uncle Greg isn’t mad.”
Sherlock stumbled against a fold in the floor rug as Mycroft dragged him across the bedroom and shoved him unceremoniously into the corner.  He could see Bunny--no, John--watching from the doorway, but Sherlock registered little above the haze of contented relief he felt under Mycroft’s authority.
“I need you to know that I care greatly for you,” Mycroft continued.  “My relationship with John and even being Bunny's Daddy will never change that.”
And so it was dressed in a pull-up and colorful bunny pajamas that John emerged from his bedroom, climbed downstairs, and crossed the living room to find Mycroft waiting for him in the kitchen, a cup of tea and a sippy cup of orange juice placed in front of John’s side of the table.  Mycroft had obviously prepared for more than one scenario.
Attempted lightheartedness, a ploy used to shift the tone away from misbehavior and anger.  Sherlock had experienced it first-hand from his brother.  It didn’t work on him, and Sherlock could see that, although it had worked to keep Bunny from getting upset in the past, it would not work on the bunny now.
“I went along with his offers to buy me what I wanted, and I really did believe for a moment that it would all be okay.”
"Your brother is on his way." John said, speaking softer, somehow picking up on Sherlock's vulnerability at the moment.  John may have been daft at solving crimes, but he could read human emotion better than most, and for that he was grateful.  "Mycroft told me to make sure you haven't hurt yourself.  Are you hurt, bud?"
It was only once the car was slowing down that he glanced up to see they had pulled off the main road and into the far corner of a mostly-empty parking lot.  Papa was turning off the car and getting out of the front seat to sit with Bunny in the back, gathering him into his lap and telling him it would be okay.
Sherlock figured this had probably been a plan of Mycroft’s all along.  Sherlock was used to Mycroft trying to teach him new things while he was little; his brother was always attempting to use littlespace to broaden his horizons.  It had actually been on a short trip away from the city years and years ago that Mycroft had first gotten Sherlock out of the house while in headspace.  They had gone to the grocery store, and Mycroft had been so supportive and discreet that after that trip Sherlock had been progressively more comfortable being little in public.
Mycroft nodded with a gentle laugh.
Sherlock knew he’d been a brat, that he’d acted out and made the morning unpleasant for his parents and frustratingly difficult for Mycroft.  But he couldn’t help it; everything felt like it was far too much.  He wished he could be small, that his mind would stop racing with everything he’d done wrong over the course of the trip home.
Sherlock put his thumb into his mouth.
John lost count after his fourth pint, both of the number of beers he’d had and of the hour of the day.  The bar was perpetually dark and dingy no matter the time, but it must have been getting on towards evening as when John next looked up he found it had grown quite crowded, men and women laughing and flirting at scattered tables and all along the bar.  The change in atmosphere increased his loneliness, and he was suddenly filled with a short-tempered anger when, some time later, one of a group of passing blokes knocked against him.
Sherlock could not take his eyes off of his boyfriend; there was such a wild beauty in John in the moment he lost control.  His pupils were blown and his breath ragged; John was uninhibitedly helpless and so, so needy.
Warnings for spanking and wetting.  Thanks for kudos/comments!
“Ah,” Mycroft said, unsure why he hadn’t realized Sherlock’s calling John “baby” was actually another of his self-preservation skills, another way to keep himself young.  He realized now that Sherlock never used John’s name when they were ageplaying, and it was Sherlock who had begun the nickname John-John.
“Bunny shouldn’t listen to the mean voices,” Sherlock said, and Mycroft smiled.
Greg reached to pat John on the knee, then shifted gears and drove off, beginning to narrate the expected weather conditions and explain next steps: quick stop at a loo, on to Greg’s parent’s house for Christmas Eve supper, then to Greg’s older brother’s house to spend the night before heading back to London after lunch on Christmas Day, home by Christmas night and the Boxing Day football matches. After a morning of following schedules and solving problems, it was comforting to know that Greg was in control, that John didn’t have to make decisions for a while.
Mycroft closed his eyes and sighed, and, when he next spoke, Greg could breathe again.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft said.
“And that’s when this...arrangement began?” John asked, unsure how to begin the conversation of what he had witnessed that night.
John’s breath caught in his throat as he felt the urine hot and soaking against first his fingertips and then, as he shifted to tuck his hand farther between Sherlock thighs, against his palm and even his wrist.  He was desperate for Sherlock’s piss, pressing himself hard against Sherlock who was already pressed tight against the end of the booth.
“I’m looking for earthworms,” Sherlock said.
“I’m not an imbecile, Dr. Watson.  If there’s anything I know how to do, it’s care for Sherlock.”
“I’m not,” Sherlock argued with a whine, twisting himself farther away from Mycroft and hiding his face against the window so Mycroft would not have been able to see thumb-sucking even if it were happening.
“It’s wrong,” John said.  “Liking that.”
It was no wonder.  The boy had thrown a fit all through breakfast, and hadn’t eaten more than two bites all told.  It was still mid-morning, but Greg was sure the boy would no longer scoff at the prospect of breakfast.
Let me know what you'd like to see next!  I'm also thinking about possibly just doing a few Johnlock slash one-offs that are not necessarily ageplay based but would take place in this same world (you'll have a hint of what may be featured in them if you read through to the end of this chapter), so let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.
“Sherlock,” he said, nodding goodbye to the man across the room.  “John.”
John forced himself out from under the blankets, then placed the plush dog beside the pillow he’d been using.
They sat in stillness for a moment, Bunny simply reveling in the memory of the dream and the feeling of being cuddled by her Papa.  She had woken up to a dry pull-up, which was a relief after the night before, and she felt comfortable and in control of herself and her emotions for perhaps the first time all day, happy to know she had both her Daddy and her Papa back to take care of her and Sherlock.
Bunny obeyed as they pulled out of the driveway, running fingers along the velvety soft underside of one of Willa’s floppy ears and listening to the soft notes of Christmas music Papa found on the radio.
“Tell your brother,” Mycroft said, and Sherlock turned back towards Bunny and Papa Greg.  Bunny had stopped crying, and was blinking up at Sherlock, trying to understand.
“Milk or juice?” John asked over his shoulder, one hand on the door of the fridge.
“Papa?” Bunny asked, holding onto Greg’s hand and absently tracing lines in his palm, eyes downcast.
“‘s okay,” Bunny said, clearly not convinced that Greg had been at fault.
“You’re mean! I’m the biggest!” Sherlock called, but he sniffled and sat on the stool facing the wall, mumbling that he was a big boy who didn’t have accidents.  Lestrade caught Mycroft’s raised eyebrow and smirked at the boy’s blatant lie.
“Sherlock Holmes, what is the meaning of this?” he asked, storming into the room and yanking Sherlock from the bed by the arm.  “Wetting yourself like an uncivilized urchin.”
“I, um...I...I hadda accident,” Sherlock said, voice small and timid, as if the kid were on the verge of tears.
“You’re going to regret that little stunt tomorrow,” Mycroft said when Uncle Greg entered the kitchen, but his eyes were bright, and Sherlock knew his Mycroft wasn’t angry.
“Ah, I...I’m fine!” he called, and then, when Greg reached to turn the door handle:  “Don’t come in!”
John’s sort of self-harm generally involved massive hangovers and nameless faces in any number of indistinguishable bedrooms instead of sharp objects, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t familiar with the type of demeaning self-talk that plagued Sherlock on his darkest days.  They were both men tormented by their pasts, often struggling to keep their heads above water.  Age regression helped, but that didn’t mean they weren’t still challenged by persistent, underlying thoughts of their own worthlessness.
“Sherlock?” Greg asked.  “Are you okay, kiddo? What do you need?”
“Tell big brother what’s wrong,” Mycroft prodded, brushing tangled curls out of Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock nodded, then drew his legs up beneath him on the bed as he turned to face John.
“I’m sorry, Myc,” Greg said as soon as the bunny rounded the corner into the bathroom.  “I’m so fucking sorry.  I screwed up.”
“Time to wake up, sleepy-head,” Greg whispered.
“I’m not a princess,” he said, knuckling his eyes but unable to keep his voice steady in the midst of his crying.  “Don't call me that, anymore.”
Mycroft had very much wanted to forbid John from leaving, had wanted to explain that the man was far too fragile at the moment to process his own emotions, let alone the emotions inherent within a visit to a crime scene.  But he knew he needed to allow John to make his own decisions when he was in an adult headspace, no matter how shaky that headspace may be.  It was a tenant of John and Sherlock’s trust in them, that they would be allowed their own decisions while adult, and Mycroft and Greg had always been careful to respect both John and Sherlock as adults when they professed to be so.  No matter how close to headspace John may be, he was currently in an adult mindset, and thus he had to be allowed to make his own decisions.  Mycroft just hoped Greg would be nearby later, when John would inevitably need a bit of looking after.
“Just…” John stood too quickly and had to close his eyes against the dizziness and the nausea.  “Give it to me, Sherlock.  You’re not going to eat any more of it.”
Mycroft did not look convinced.
Mycroft said nothing as he began to spank Sherlock, thwacking his hand heavily against the soaking wet fabric of Sherlock’s rear.  There was real emotion behind Mycroft’s actions; Sherlock could tell that his brother had been truly angered by his behavior.  The boy could not help but cry, and in the overstimulation of fear and pain and neediness and gratefulness, he felt another burst of urine wet his pants, his bladder fully emptying over Mycroft’s knees.
Greg knocked on the door to ask if everything was alright, obviously having heard the commotion, and Mycroft called that they were just fine as he rubbed John’s hand and told him he was a good boy.
Also, I'm writing Weekend at the Lake as we go, but I do have a few other stories in this universe that are already written.  Should I post one or two of those now, even though they take place a bit later in the progression of the universe, or should I hold off and continue to post everything chronologically so it doesn't get confusing?  Let me know!
“Not hungry,” he mumbled.  “The idiocy of humanity has turned me off food forever.”
John’s eyes were red-rimmed and the boy had been sucking his thumb even as they walked into the flat.  Mycroft stood, seeing immediately that something was wrong.
When they were kids, Sherlock had idolized Mycroft.  His big brother was smarter and more self-assured than anyone he had ever met, even more so than their parents and Sherlock’s teachers.  Sherlock wanted to be in his older brother’s reassuring and regimented presence at all times.  As they had grown up, part of Sherlock still longed to be by his brother's side.  The world had always been confusing and frustrating; if Mycroft couldn’t set it right, no one could.
His voice was small when he next spoke, caught on the edge of tears.
“Do you want to take him with you?” Greg asked, nodding towards the beat-up old toy.  “I’m not sure where he came from, exactly.  But I’m sure he won’t be missed.”
“Can you tell Bunny I don’t want her to stop being a girl?” he asked.  “Can you tell her I want her to be what she feels and not give in to the bad thoughts that tell her to stay a boy, but I want her to be a quiet girl because I like quiet girls better?”
“How much longer?” Sherlock asked, stretching his body to tense all of his muscles and then flopping back onto the seat with a groan when he was met with silence.
“It’s fine, Mycroft,” he said at last, unable to put into words the vast array of emotions he was feeling.
It was when they were roughly fifteen minutes from Mycroft’s that Greg’s mobile began to vibrate.  He glanced into the rear-view to ensure the kid was still asleep, then silenced the phone as he glanced at the caller ID.  Sherlock.  He could see he'd missed a call from the boy, earlier, too.
They found John and Sherlock asleep in Sherlock’s bed.  Sherlock’s head was on John’s shoulder and John’s thumb was tucked into his mouth.  Although they certainly both looked young at the moment, it was likely only Sherlock had been young when they’d gone to bed: while Sherlock was dressed in a ragged pair of dinosaur pajamas--a too-small pair that were some of the first items of clothing Mycroft had purchased when he’d begun ageplay with a barely nineteen-year-old Sherlock--John was still dressed in his jeans and sweater.
Greg pulled into the parking lot at the big-box store, mentally reviewing the list of items Mycroft had asked him to get.  Bunny sat in the back seat, humming along to the children’s radio station that Sherlock never let them listen to without putting up a fight.  When he glanced in the rear-view mirror, he saw Bunny bouncing along to the music, mouthing the words as he scribbled into his mermaid coloring book.  It had been close to a forty-five minute drive, but the boy had behaved himself the entire time, the opposite of the defiant kid he’d been earlier that morning.
Mycroft sighed.
“Do you love Uncle Greg?”
I have minimal first-hand experience with questions of gender identity beyond my own proclivity towards opposite-gender items/interests while ageplaying, so please feel free to reach out/comment if there is anything you feel to be inauthentic/incomplete/inaccurate or unfairly stereotypical about what Bunny is going through in this chapter.  I'd love to hear from any of you who have been through this first-hand and can give pointers or advice for approaching the topic both realistically and with sensitivity in this and future chapters.
“Can you come out from under the blankets for me?” Mycroft asked.  “You must be very warm.”
"I'll be there as soon as I can," Mycroft said at last, and John felt relief, felt grateful that Sherlock had a brother who had always taken care of him, no questions asked.  "Don't make him talk if he doesn't want to.  And check to see that he hasn't hurt himself."
When Greg nodded, Mycroft turned away and noticed the little Bunny entering the kitchen.  He was rubbing his eyes--still tired, then.  Mycroft and Greg had decided to skip an afternoon nap for the boys given that they had slept in the car, but now Mycroft was second guessing that decision in regards to his sleepy little bunny.
John shook his head.  His adult mind was stubborn; it always won out after the memories of war returned.
He wasn't sure Sherlock would be able to uphold his promise, particularly if he was feeling jealous of the attention Bunny may be perceived to be receiving as a girl, but it was a start.
“You can’t honestly be saying you don’t think Sherlock can handle knowing the truth?”
I hope you all are doing wonderfully and enjoying the holiday season.  I can’t wait for the snow to come (whenever that will be) and am excited for a bit of a break from the everyday while I celebrate the holidays!
“Good,” Sherlock grinned, settling his thigh beneath John’s crotch as he stepped closer and continued to tickle relentlessly.
“Would it kill you to tell your mother you're leaving for three hours?” an older woman said, pushing her way through the men and playfully hitting Greg on the chest with a dish towel.  She immediately softened, reaching to cup his jawline, smiling as he towered over her.  “At least you're in time for dinner,” she said.
Greg seemed to understand immediately what had happened.  He paused the movie and glanced down to where John knew there would be a wet spot surrounding him.
“You’re going to regret this,” he warned in a whisper, but Greg only stepped close again to Mycroft and kissed him.
“The kid wet the bed,” Greg began, sifting through the events of the evening until he had parsed it down to only the most relevant details.  “When he came to get you, he saw John asleep next to you, which upset him.  I calmed him down, but I slipped up when I was getting him to sleep again.  When he asked why John was in our room I told him...I told him the bunny just wanted his daddy.”
“Sherlock,” Mycroft demanded, now closer to the space where Bunny was scrambling to his feet.  “Come here.”
John sighed, resting his arms on the table.
He watched while Sherlock yanked each item of clothing from the trunk and began sorting through the treasure trove of costumes.  It was best for Bunny to sit back and watch for the time being; letting Sherlock determine the rules of the first game generally kept the little detective the most content.  Besides, Bunny himself felt well settled in his littleness and cozy inside while the rain fell outside.  It didn’t seem such a bad thing to let others make his decisions for the time being.
“Bunny has decided that, sometimes, he wants to be a girl,” Mycroft explained.  “And sometimes, he wants to be a boy.”
“Can we talk when you’re finished?” Greg asked, calm but definitive.
“Then there’s nothing wrong about taking enjoyment from this,” Mycroft said.  “What does it make you feel?”
“At least tell him about the boy,” Greg said.  “His friend.  Leave out your sister if you really think it’s for his own good, but don’t let him go on thinking all he lost was a dog.”
He leaned into his Daddy and nodded.
John snorted a laugh and rolled over to pull Sherlock back down to the bed by the neck of his t-shirt.  He gave him a sloppy kiss on the side of his mouth.
“Sherlock wants to talk to you,” he said to Mycroft, who nodded as if taking marching orders.
“But he is a baby!” Sherlock gaped.  “Only babies pee in their pants!”
“Maybe Mrs. Hudson’s in the market for an age regressor?”
P.S. Remember when I said this story wasn't going to be angsty? ;p I didn't even make it two chapters without little Sherlock pulling us into angst!  Hopefully you all don't mind <3
“I’ll call him ‘bunny,’ instead.” Sherlock said, eyes closing.
“I, ah...she said she’s not feeling well.  Said maybe you can get together for New Year?”
“You can have one of my princess ones, if you want,” Bunny said, sincere and heartbreakingly kind.
He could tell by the damp patch on the boy’s pants that they did not have much time, and he helped the boy re-situate himself atop the folded blanket.  He toyed with the idea of having the boy take off his pants to spare them as well, but they were already wet, and if the boy was indeed looking to wet himself as some sort of comfort regimen, past experiences made it likely that wetting his clothes was a part of that plan.
John whined.  “Big boy,” he said.
“‘Kay, Uncle Greg,” Bunny said, climbing out of bed and trailing his stuffed lion behind him by the paw as he walked out of the bedroom and into the hallway.
Because he knew they were alone in the house, that Greg would not be back with John for at least another two hours given the drive and the shopping time, Mycroft began to sing.  Mycroft only half-remembered the lyrics of the old lullaby, and hummed the melody whenever he came to a section of words he’d long ago forgotten.  But he had never found anything quite as effective at calming his brother, and Sherlock never seemed to mind that the song was a hodgepodge of remembered words and Mycroft’s improvisation.
He found the baby blanket on the floor beside the head of Bunny’s bed, thankfully dry and free of any spilled medication.  Bunny took it into his arms with a smile when Greg returned it to him and kissed him on the forehead.
Mycroft was relieved when he could see that John was feeling bolstered by Mycroft’s rational explanations, more sure of himself and less unmoored.  Even so, Mycroft knew they had not yet gotten to the heart of the issue.
“Quiet,” Mycroft said, smirking through his ragged breath as he bodily turned Greg over and, propping himself up with hands beside each of Greg’s shoulders, bent to kiss him.  “You’ll wake the kids.”
Sherlock was leaning over Bunny’s side of the bed a moment later, reaching a long arm down to pinch Bunny hard on the forearm where the sleeve of his nightgown had ridden up to expose skin.  The sudden jolt of pain had Bunny screaming and then sobbing, and he clamped a hand over the pinched skin and scurried under the bed to protect himself from Sherlock’s reaching fingers.
“I think Mycroft would murder me if I brought home any more Christmas presents,” he said with a raised eyebrow.  “He’s not a proponent of what he calls my ‘spoiling the kids.’”
“John wet my bed,” he said by way of deflecting the curious gazes away from himself.  “I’m sure he could use some help cleaning up, Greg.”
“We’ll have to tell Daddy just how well-prepared you were, won’t we?  Daddy admires forward thinking more than just about anyone, doesn’t he?”
“Say goodbye to the lake house until next time, babies,” Mycroft prompted from the driver’s seat, having promised to do the first shift of driving until they stopped for dinner.
After a moment of well-intentioned snogging, Sherlock seemed to realize that John hadn’t gotten off, and he got the energy to pull at John’s upper body until John was settled above him, knees on either side of Sherlock’s hips.
“Is John-John still big?” Sherlock asked, balancing himself on Papa’s shoulders as the man, seated on the edge of the bathtub, leaned to help him step out of his wet trousers.
Greg awoke to the clattering of pots and pans from down in the kitchen.  He stretched, allowing himself to take up more of the mattress than he had all night when he had been attempting to make room for the boys between him and Mycroft.  His arm fell into a cold wet spot on the sheets, and he sat up, registering for the first time that Sherlock and Mycroft were absent, and must be the culprits making noise down in the kitchen.  Sherlock must have wet the bed, and Mycroft must either have had an upset Sherlock to distract, or must not have wanted to disturb them, and thus had not yet changed the sheets.
“Wear this,” Sherlock said, holding out his coat.
“Yes!” Sherlock said, emphatic and argumentative.  “I don’t feel good.”
“Didn’t want to go potty,” Bunny mumbled, and Greg gently guided the kid’s stuffed friend away from his face.  “Was mad at Daddy.”
Sherlock blinked up at his brother and sighed.  There was a part of him still desperate to express his distress to his brother, a part of him ready to pout until Mycroft took him in his lap to comfort him.  But John was expecting him to hold an adult conversation with Mycroft.  If John were there, he would encourage him to talk with Mycroft about his feelings of betrayal.  He would tell him he should explain to Mycroft his fears of being left out.  He would prod him to apologize for aligning himself with Greg just to make Mycroft jealous.
“Finish your pee and get dressed,” he said, knowing that if Sherlock had fully emptied his bladder, he would have wet his pants and the bed as well as the pull-up.  “Then meet me back in the bedroom and we’ll talk.”
The overgrown child had curled himself in an armchair for the majority of the day, arms crossed over his chest as he mumbled derogatory comments under his breath.  Each time one parent or the other took an action Sherlock classified as inane--their father tuning the radio to a station playing Christmas carols,  their mother setting out cheese and crackers on Christmas platters, both of them answering phone calls from Aunts and Uncles and family friends requesting updates on Mycroft and Sherlock--the man rolled his eyes and breathed insulting comments.  Eventually, it was only Mycroft’s pointed glares, which hinted at threats of spankings and exceedingly long time-outs once they were out of sight of their parents, that kept him from voicing his vitriolic comments.
“You don't have to play his games,” Mycroft told him, and John laughed through his nose.
For now, they had all had a tough day, and Mycroft suspected all of his boys could go for some macaroni and cheese and dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets.
Sherlock woke with a gasp, unsure of where he was.  He felt tears coming as he lifted his thumb to his mouth, but he felt Bunny asleep in the bed next to him, pressed close, and he remembered Mycroft had put him down for a nap in the big bed.  Sherlock sniffed, no longer feeling the need for tears.
“Fine,” John said.
“It doesn't to me,” Greg said.  “It takes a brave Bunny to get through a day as tough as today.”
Mycroft could not help but smile at Greg, who was looking at him just as knowingly.   John’s voice was young and nervous.  If there had been any question regarding John’s state of mind when they’d arrived at Baker Street, it had now been answered.
It was easy enough to find a pair of clean briefs in Sherlock's top drawer, even if he did have to dig beneath what he could only assume to be a mold experiment of some kind to find them.  The pajamas were a bit more difficult.  Sherlock generally slept in cotton pajama trousers and nothing else; it was only once John had yanked out the second drawer entirely that he found the aforementioned pajamas, pressed against the back of the bureau.  John pulled them from their hiding place.  They were blue and red striped cotton pajamas, soft elastic at the wrists and ankles, a trait often seen on children's pajamas.
Mycroft felt pleased, content that, albeit with Sherlock’s help, John had asked for what he needed and he had been able to give him exactly that.
Sherlock was fumbling with the hem of his pajama shirt as he stepped tentatively into the bathroom.  His hair was wet, combed back from his face; Greg must have given Sherlock a bath in the master bathroom down the hall.  He smirked at Greg’s genius.  Sherlock had not particularly needed a bath, but he would have needed comfort and support after the timeout Greg had undoubtedly put him in, something Sherlock never accepted easily.  The bath would have not only kept Sherlock in one space while allowing Greg the time to hold the conversation he needed to have with the mischief-maker, but would have given Sherlock an excuse to accept touch, would have allowed Sherlock to be taken care of so as to distract him from any self-abasement which may have settled in.  Mycroft doubted if he would have thought of it, but he could see now that it had been the perfect option.
“Daddy?” the boy asked, blinking blearily up at Mycroft.
(I promise I'll try to get a new ficlet up in the next day or two, even if it's a short one!).
“Now if only we had a plan for Sherlock’s dark days,” Greg sighed, clearly thinking of the melancholy that sometimes plagued the consulting detective, the dark thoughts which had led to the day’s self-harm.
John shrugged and yawned.
“You know, when I was your age, I wanted to be a firefighter,” Greg said, wanting to validate Bunny’s young mindset while distracting John from what he guessed were triggering thoughts circling his mind.
“---Sherlock,” John said as he broke into a smile, feeling affection for the man despite needing Sherlock to stop, knowing the man would continue delving further into John’s past and psychological hang-ups if he were not forced to pause his train of thought.  “Sherlock, that’s enough.”
Mycroft must have been sleeping deeply to not have been woken by John’s nightmare.  It was rare that John’s post-traumatic stress emerged while he was young, but it wasn’t unheard of.  The man’s dreams were forceful and gruesome; Greg must have either wanted to spare Sherlock from watching while John was calmed, or spare John the audience.
“It was wrong of you to tease your brother today.  As the big brother, it’s your job to protect those who are littler than you, especially your brother.  You didn’t protect John today by teasing him, did you?”
“Okay, no problem.  Let me get your suitcase, and we’ll head inside to the loo so you can finish up, okay?”
Bunny keened in the back of his throat as the smell of his accident reached him, and a moment later he felt the pull-up leaking, trickling out of the left leg hole to run down his thigh and his calf until it began puddling around his foot on the hardwood floor.  He continued to pee, unable to stop, suddenly helpless against the rush of liquid streaming through the too-full pull-up and falling to patter onto the floor.
Sherlock whined again, but pulled his thumb from his mouth.
They fell into each other as they clutched their stomachs, overcome by the hilarity of the situation and unable to breathe from the intensity of their laughing fit.  After long minutes caught up in laughter, they lay back snickering until they were breathing shallowly, catching their breath and moaning with the pain of their sore stomach muscles.
“This isn’t about your status as authority figure right now, love,” Greg said as he reached to squeeze Mycroft’s shoulder.  “We need to figure out what’s going on in that little head of his.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes at his relentless brother, who just would not give up.  He had half a mind to leave the couch and tell his brother once more to leave him alone, but Sherlock was tired, his nose was running and his head ached to the point that he was beginning to think he really was coming down with a cold, and it was far easier to pull Dimitri to his chest and bury his head back into the blankets on Mycroft’s lap.
“I think someone could use a bath this morning,” he said.  “We’ll get you all nice and clean and dressed in something comfy before we take you down for some breakfast.  How does that sound?”
He shifted farther down towards the ground, spreading his knees until the fabric of his undies was right against the carpet, and, with a breath and a suck on his sippy cup, fingers wrapped around the warm plastic, he let himself begin to pee.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock said, unable to keep a break out of his voice.
Sherlock felt his cheeks go pink at his parents’ tones.  He glanced at Mycroft, nervous he’d done something to clue their parents in to his burgeoning headspace, nervous that they were speaking to them like children because they’d figured out that that was exactly what Sherlock was feeling like at the moment, but Mycroft shook his head, silently reassuring Sherlock.
Bunny got shy, and he shrugged as he began running his fingers along the ear of his new bunny rabbit.  He wanted to tell his Daddy about wetting his pants, that it made him feel young and cared for, that he wanted to wear pull-ups all the time and be little enough to need reminders and pull-up checks and maybe even a sticker chart.  But the words were hard.
A part of him considered unzipping his jeans and pissing against the side of the house.  But there were too many others around, and his jeans were already dripping; he may as well suck it up and piss himself like a man.  He kept his head high and his stance strong, feeling the warmth stream down the inside of first one leg, and then the other, nearly an entire day’s worth of piss soaking into his clothing.
John recalled nights he was put to bed little, when he would lie in bed and imagine playing with dolls, when he imagined himself a little princesses.
"Won't be mean like the voices," he mumbled, eyes half-lidded.
“How about this?” Greg asked, pulling the boy gently away from his chest in order to look him in the eye.  “If you can be a big boy all day and not use a pacifier or suck your thumb, you can have your paci back for storytime and bedtime.  Does that sound okay?”
When Sherlock, in a fit of anger, accuses John of being littler than him, the doctor should simply laugh off the comment and move on.  But Mycroft can't help but notice the way in which the man is affected by Sherlock's statement, so much so that Mycroft wonders if John isn't harboring a desire to be little himself.
for ficlets and one-shots!
“You’re mean,” Sherlock mumbled, but at least he was already young enough to leave it there.
“Yeah,” he mumbled, tipping back the dregs of his third pint before pushing the empty glass across the bar towards her.  “Thanks.”
“Get cleaned up and get some sleep now, love.  I expect to see a well rested boy when I get back tomorrow, okay?”
“Don't talk with your mouth full, Sherlock,” Greg chuckled as he shared an amused look with Mycroft.  Mycroft was glad to see his brother eating hungrily after not eating anything more substantial than ice cream for lunch.  He reached to take the pacifier from John’s mouth, wanting both of his boys to get something good into them before the end of the night.  John whined a bit but did not give Mycroft too much of a fight when the pacifier was taken away.
It was unclear exactly what had brought about John’s foray into fighting with Anderson.  He’d seen the effects of the man’s temper a time or two, knew John certainly had moments where he gave into the seething anger he often felt and thus resorted to violence.  It was, gratefully, a personality trait that plagued adult John often and their mild-mannered Bunny rather infrequently, but it was nevertheless a part of the make-up of John Watson, fits of rage looming like his PTSD-nightmares and Sherlock’s tendency towards self-harm.  Greg wanted so badly to save his kids from the pain they felt, from the thoughts that drew them towards unhealthy and destructive coping mechanisms, but, at the moment, all he could do was assure John that he was loved, and get him home to where he would feel safe.
“The man will be dealt with, of course,” Mycroft was saying, voice self-important and pompous, like the bad guy from when Bunny was old enough for Papa to agree to let them watch Aladdin.  “No one would imagine he’d retain his job after such an incident.”
“Mycroft!” Sherlock called as he burst into the flat.  He rushed to the kitchen table where Mycroft was sitting, and held up a plush alligator, making the alligator growl a hello to Mycroft.  Mycroft assumed the alligator had been the closest thing the gift shop had had to a dinosaur.
"How old are they?" he asked.
“Try to get some sleep,” was all Mycroft said.
“Sorry, buddy,” Greg said, and Sherlock could see him shaking his head.  “You heard the rules before we left: no technology this weekend unless it’s supervised and on my or your brother’s timeline.”
“I don’t exactly know why I like those things,” John said, feeling plagued by the awkwardness that often came when he had to rationalize Bunny behavior while adult.  “I guess, on some level, I’ve wanted them ever since I first started slipping into headspace.  The identification wasn’t as strong initially, but, looking back, I can see it was there even before I started asking for things.”
John could see that Mycroft sensed his shift in mindset immediately.
“Can you tell me why you were mad, sweetheart?” Greg asked.  "Papa's just trying to understand."
“He’s not in the best of spaces, right now,” Mycroft said.  “We’ll need to be gentle with him today.”
“Night, Daddy,” he said around a yawn.
John sighed, choosing to focus on relief rather than the fictitious concerns spiraling in his mind or the half-formed anger he felt when he thought about how far she had made him come before bailing.
“For Sherlock?” he said, his face an adorable picture of confusion.
“Once upon a time,” he began, already forming some half-brained idea about a reindeer flying a boy to a winter wonderland.
Lestrade had said he would let John take the lead, had said he just wanted John to be comfortable.  The case and subsequent stress of being little without Mycroft and Sherlock had pushed him lower in headspace than usual, and he was feeling particularly vulnerable.  Also, the last time he had seen Uncle Greg when he was little, they had gone to the zoo and John had wet his pants.  He hadn’t had any accidents since--he was still working out his thoughts about the issue--but he was suddenly frightened that he might.  And what would Uncle Greg think if he wet again?  He’d think he was a useless baby.
“What do you say?” Greg teased, “Should we invite him over for a bedtime story?”
“I didn’t have any spare clothes for him, so I just bought some sweatpants at the zoo shop and changed him into one of Sherlock’s spare pull-ups for under them,” Lestrade explained.
It was with relief that he placed his key into the lock of 221b Baker Street and dragged himself up the staircase to the flat.  He walked carefully, then stumbled on the top step and had to reach out to clasp the bannister in order to steady himself.  He paused, hoping the noise hadn’t drawn the attention of Mrs. Hudson.  He had definitely had one too many.
“You should never have to go through that alone, kid,” he said.
“When they’re small,” his brother repeated.
The boys had been dozing for what Sherlock felt could have been five minutes or half an hour when they heard footsteps trudging up the wooden staircase and towards the bedroom.  Sherlock could still feel the same tendrils of sadness and nervousness he’d felt since waking up that morning clouding his thoughts, but there was also a lightness to the moment.  With Bunny beside him and the benefit of a good, restful nap, he began to feel as if he may be able to start pulling himself out of the darkness.
Sherlock twisted his head a bit until he could look at Mycroft, who despite his teasing tone looked warm, eager to help.  Sherlock was surprised Mycroft had not yet mentioned Sherlock’s teasing of Bunny, or the way he had pushed him off of the bed.  But he wasn’t about to be the first one to bring up his own naughtiness.
“Is he a girl, now?” Sherlock asked, repeating his earlier question.
“Papa!” Bunny called, rushing out of the bathroom in nothing more than the towel wrapped around his shoulders.
“Bunny?  Are you okay, lad?” Mycroft had noticed something was off, was glancing up at John, who stood frozen in the middle of the room.
Mycroft was watching Sherlock from behind the kitchen counter, a mug of tea in his hand.  He nodded towards Sherlock when he caught his eye.
It was a bit ironic that Sherlock, despite being the less experienced of the two, almost always took on the dominant personality in their sex life.  Nevertheless, the dynamic worked for the two of them, and John had to admit it wasn’t exactly a stretch to find himself settling back to take orders from Sherlock.
Oh my goodness, loves--I'm so sorry it's been such a long time since I've updated.  I've had quite a busy few weeks (moving, finishing up one contract job and starting another), and I've only had scattered amounts of short bursts of time to work on this chapter (I even wrote a bit of this chapter the subway yesterday, which I almost never do!).
John cleared his throat and sat up in bed.
“I have an idea, ‘Lockie,” Mycroft said, moving the boy the slightest distance away from him by lifting him from the armpits.  He wanted to be able to look Sherlock in the eye.  “Why don’t we go sit outside? You can listen to the frogs and toads and tell me which ones make which sounds.”
“Of course, good boy,” Greg said, stepping over to flush the toilet.  “But let’s put on a pull-up so that you’re all ready for bed before the movie, okay?”
The kid seemed to take in their surroundings slowly once he glanced up from his mobile, as if just realizing they’d pulled off the highway.
“I won’t do it, Mycroft,” Greg said, shaking his head.  “Not without John consenting.”
He rooted through the cardboard box which held the options he had for video games.  Mycroft didn’t allow violence, which limited his options for entertaining video games, but after once being caught playing a war game, he knew better than to push his luck.  There were a few Mycroft-approved options he knew would keep his attention, and he was in search of one particular game he had been close to beating the last time he'd played.  He felt his irritation growing when he couldn't find what he was looking for, an irritation which suddenly made him feel close to tears.  He blinked furiously and upended the entire box of games in a last-ditch effort to keep himself from succumbing to the weepiness which had been threatening all morning.
There was a bit of relief that Sherlock was in his bedroom as an adult; Greg felt slightly less panic over not being with the boy.  That said, adult Sherlock had a very specific way of dealing with emotional pain which was, perhaps, more cause for concern, and Greg knew he was in for a night of post-duty outside the door of the blue and green bedroom.  It wasn’t hard to imagine that Sherlock would attempt to leave the lake house.  It also wasn't hard to imagine that he may try to harm himself, and Greg was exceedingly glad that he and Mycroft had done a sweep of the house when they arrived to baby-proof each of the rooms.  He could not think of anything in Sherlock's room that could be used for self-harm.
Sherlock felt the breath catch in his throat.
Mycroft said goodnight and John was too tired to feel ashamed when Greg led him into the bathroom, stripped him, scrubbed him down with wipes, dressed him in one of Sherlock’s pull-ups and a fresh pair of pajamas, and tucked him into bed.
“Daddy?”
“We’ll get you some aspirin once we’re settled in the car, Bun, and then maybe you’ll be able to take a bit of a morning nap.  Do you have what you need?”
But as he sat beneath the twinkling string lights that Greg had hung in the kitchen (and in every other room of the main floor, and on the banister up to the second floor, and in the bushes out front), watching the smiling faces of his kids dressed in matching pajamas and the knowing glances of his contented boyfriend in his ridiculous old Santa hat, he began to understand.  For the first time, he was spending Christmas with a family who understood and valued him for exactly who he was, a family he could care for and who had forced him to open himself up to their love.
They wouldn’t fool Mycroft, who would know what a line of four plasters meant, but they would hide the cuts, and maybe, if Bunny was small enough, he could be convinced Sherlock had just gotten an owie.
“Please, My?” Sherlock pleaded, grabbing onto Mycroft’s arm.  “Please! I promise I’ll be a good boy from now on and I’ll pay attention to Bunny’s needs like a big brother is apposed to!”
I'm working on responding to all of your comments, but I'm about to head out for a bit, so it may be later tonight or tomorrow!  I promise to get to them all asap because I truly value all of your wonderful comments!
Just three days ago, Sherlock he had wet himself at the kitchen table while attempting to determine the chemical compound in a soil sample.  John had been preparing dinner, and when he heard the sound of liquid pattering against the linoleum he turned to find a red-faced Sherlock mumbling too quickly for John to decipher as he backed away from the kitchen and retreated to his bedroom.
Mycroft’s plans to keep a close eye on Sherlock had been well-intentioned.  The boy had been cycling through emotions since being woken up by Bunny’s nightmare the night before, and Mycroft knew it was essential that he be there to keep his brother settled comfortably in headspace and to keep an eye on the dark thoughts the boy struggled with on days he was feeling depressed and lost.
Now the entire ordeal was in danger of being brought to light, and Mycroft was unsure Sherlock was prepared to go through the stress of it all a second time.
“Mycroft?” Sherlock asked as Mycroft reached to run his fingers through his brother’s hair, head leaned against the headboard and eyes slippling closed.
as we send you off to bed.”
He let the kid cry as long as he needed to, providing assurances that everything was okay, and eventually the boy’s tears had died down to sniffles.  Bunny looked up at Mycroft as he knuckled at red-rimmed eyes, having tuckered himself out.
John seemed lost in thought, but he nodded.
“He’ll keep you safe from monsters,” Sherlock said.
“That’s also why we need to discuss what you're hiding from me right now.”
Greg nodded.  “Right,” he said.  “Call me if you need anything.”
John hesitated for only a moment before he nodded and reached forward to take it in his mouth.  It had an instant calming effect, and he finally felt like he would be able to stop crying.  Greg continued to rub his back and rock him back and forth.  They settled into John’s armchair and John grounded himself by holding onto the fabric as he sucked hard on his pacifier and pulled his new blanket tighter around his shoulders.  The contact from Greg’s arms around his torso, and the strong bulk John could feel as he lay against him, settled him further.
This is the last chapter for A Trip to the Zoo, but I have more stories of the boys written that I'll add to the series soon.  Let me know if you have any requests for little Sherlock or little John shenanigans that I can write once those chapters are uploaded.  Thanks, loves, for reading!
“So I gotta let her tell me what to do?” Sherlock asked, shocked.
“Alright, hun,” Mycroft smiled, guiding John from the bedroom with a hand on his shoulder.  “Let’s go to the lake, okay?”
Greg nodded, and John was relieved he was following the boundaries John was working so hard to set, at least for the moment.  It had been an emotionally charged morning, and an emotionally charged few days in the lead-up to the holidays.  John fumbled his phone out of his pocket to plug it into the car charger, then let his head fall back against the seat as Greg pulled out of the service station.  He just needed to make it until after lunch on Christmas Day, and then he would be more than happy to let Greg baby him to his heart’s content.
“I don’t need any help!” Sherlock called as he bounded to the dresser and yanked out the bottom drawer, where they kept the boys’ little clothes.  He tore through to find a pair of sweatpants and a dinosaur t-shirt.
Bunny nodded.
“What do you mean, buddy?” he asked when Sherlock’s breathing had begun to return to normal.
“Papa?" he said, voice whiny.  "I have to go.”
“My room!” He said when he’d come across a blue child’s room with a green bedspread over the twin bed.
Bunny had certainly peed himself before, but he’d never done it after announcing what he was about to do.  Usually, he waited until he couldn’t hold it anymore, and didn’t fight too hard against having an accident if he was feeling in the mood to be wet and little.  This was different.  He had to pee, but not badly enough to cause an accident just yet.  He would be peeing in his pull-up on purpose.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft said, in a warning voice.  Apparently there was a limit to his brother’s patience, even in a do-over situation.  Mycroft may have been rewinding to fix the circumstances surrounding Sherlock learning of the new Bunny and Mycroft dynamic, but Sherlock was also expected to re-do his reaction to the telling.
“He’s wet,” he said quietly to Sherlock when Bunny was distracted by crying into his shoulder.  “When did he have an accident?”
Mycroft untangled himself from the kiddo and stood to hold his hands out to the boy.
“Very good, buddy,” Mycroft said, and Sherlock smiled.
Greg messed up and got shampoo in John’s eyes, but John did his best not to whine or cry.  He knew it was only an accident, and he had been moving around to grab a plastic mermaid that had slipped out of his hand while Uncle Greg had been rinsing the shampoo out of his hair, so it was partly his own fault.  Greg told him he was a brave boy for not crying, which made John feel good.
Sherlock shrugged, but there was defiance in his eyes when he looked up.  He was definitely fully adult again, and reveling in mischief.
“There’s nothing to be scared of, love,” he said.  “Little boys use their pull-ups all the time.”
“It’s for anyone who likes it,” he said, and Bunny looked up at him as if gauging how truthful the statement really was before glancing back towards the row of clothing.
And with that, the detective gasped and turned his eyes down to his thighs, where a stream of urine was quickly darkening his trousers, pulsing down his thighs.   He whimpered, one hand squeezing his crotch in a futile attempt at stopping the flow.  But it was too late; his eyes closed and cheeks reddened in shame as Sherlock braced himself against the wall and wet his pants.  His clothing was dark, but the warm flood pushed through his underwear and into his jeans, and the spread of urine puddling on the floor would be hard to miss.  John watched, eyes wide, as Sherlock--holding back his coat to keep it from getting soiled--stood helplessly, peeing in his pants.  The urine splattered against the hardwood floor.
“Good boy,” Greg said, and John could not help but melt under the praise.
“Can you talk to me, buddy?” Greg asked, voice gentle.  “Can you tell me what’s wrong?”
Bunny glanced up at Sherlock, who nodded.  He knew John (and, thus, Bunny) always needed to pee when he woke after sleeping, and as much as Sherlock wanted to keep Bunny close in order to prevent his own spanking--Both John and Bunny disliked when Sherlock was spanked, so Mycroft and Greg made sure to do it out of sight of the younger boy whenever possible--he certainly did not want to be the one to cause Bunny any trouble getting to the loo.  He had already manipulated the man into a pull-up; he didn’t want to cause him an accident, too.
“I had to go potty,” Sherlock explained as Mycroft’s back was turned to him.  "I couldn't hold it."
Bunny turned his face against his Daddy’s chest, shy now that Sherlock had condemned what Bunny had begun to find exciting.
Sherlock nodded, and Greg offered him a hand as he led him to Bunny’s room.
“I'm sorry I spilled the beans on that one, kid,” Greg said, scrubbing a hand over his face.  “Mycroft and Bunny were going to tell you, when the time was right.”
“He deserves a second spanking,” Mycroft said, voice low when he confronted Greg outside the bathroom door.
“Can I talk to her?” he asked, clearly eager to set things right.  “I don’t want her to be sad and never play with me again.”
“Sit down, love,” Greg said from his place seated on the bed in the master bedroom.
“I’m here for you,” Mycroft said, taking a step towards John.  “Whether adult or child, you deserve to know that there are people who care for you, that you are worthy of care.”
“You have until the count of three, Sherlock,” Mycroft said.  “One.”
“You don’t have to take a nap,” Mycroft said off-hand.  “Just rest your eyes.  Why don’t you see if you can tell me all the elements on the periodic table?”
“I fear I’ve damaged something between us,” he said, and John shook his head.
Happy Holidays and a happy start to the Christmas weekend for those of you who celebrate!
It was Bunny who spoke first, however, gasping and running towards Sherlock with the pile of brightly-colored and sparkling stickers.
“You did so well,” Sherlock said, knowing just what John needed and just how to get him there.  “Good boy.  Held it just like a big boy.”
“Nothing broken,” Greg explained.
“Just an accident, kiddo,” Greg told him, voice as bright as always.  “Nothing we can’t fix up.”
“First, I need to apologize to you, Bun,” he said.  “It wasn’t right of me to bring you to the crime scene when you clearly weren’t ready to be there.”
“Just for a few minutes,” Mycroft said.  He helped John to stand and pulled up his underwear and pajama pants for him, then instructed John to flush the toilet and wash his hands.
“Poor kid,” Greg said, bringing the vegetables to the sink to wash them.  “It can't be easy to not even always understand your own feelings about something so emotionally taxing.”
John hung up, then dug his raw hands into the deep pockets of Greg’s jacket.  There were too many differing images to choose from--Harry drunk and crying, Harry drunk and laughing as she danced from room to room, Harry drunk and angry, casting bitter quips to anyone who attempted to calm her.  He was relieved when his phone pinged with a text message.
“That’s right, smart boy.”
“Pretty,” he said by way of explaining his shows of affection when he pulled away at last.
I hope you are all doing well--sending bunny kisses!
“Who?” John asked when Mycroft remained silent, surveying Sherlock as he waited for the man to speak further.  He needed to understand the boundaries of Sherlock’s insight before potentially letting on more than he needed to.
“I’m sorry I wasn’t here when you woke up, ‘Lock,” he said, voice soft.  “I know that must have been frustrating, especially since Papa told you I would be.”
Thank you all as always for you wonderfully sweet and endearing comments.  I'm so happy to have been able to bring you all some comfort and hopefully happiness with this series, and I hope you'll all continue on in the journey with these little kiddos in the new year.  A special thank you to SimiTheTrickster, who helped me put a name to what Bunny is going through--gender fluidity--and was kind enough to share a little bit about their own journey which helped me in this chapter and is sure to help in future chapters as well!
Bunny hummed a mm-hmm and nodded, watching the telly screen closely.  Mycroft hoped for all of their sakes that the ice-skating penguins or jelly-bean eating rat would make a reappearance and ease the heaviness for a time.  He worried they may have tears on their hands if they continued down the path of cackling ghosts.
“Don’t feel good,” he said.
The Bunny whimpered and brought his knees up to his chest.  He couldn’t help but place one of his hands between his legs to press.
“Sherlock?” Mycroft asked, raising his voice from the other room, expectant.
Mycroft’s doubtful glance caused a sudden streak of defiance, and Sherlock, in an attempt to prove himself big, stuffed an entire chicken nugget into his mouth.  His brother sighed the way he did when Sherlock was proving even more difficult than usual.
And, until recently, he had also had John.
“Have a nice holiday, sir,” one of the train workers said as John stepped onto the platform.
“And yet, you did not.”
John could sense Greg’s hesitance as the Detective Inspector listened to Donovan continue to explain whatever pressing matter had led her to call.  Greg and Mycroft both struggled to leave John and Sherlock when the boys were young, but they held high-profile positions; sometimes it couldn’t be helped.
John knocked Sherlock's shoulder with his own, then leaned over to shut his boyfriend up with a kiss.  After the stress of the day, there was a wonderful familiarity in knowing they had nothing to worry about but allowing their heartrates to get back to normal so they could get some sleep.
He dropped the empty container onto the wet spot on the carpet, tossed a box of tissues from the bedside table towards the spill to make it look as if he’d been trying to clean up, then stumbled towards the doorway, twisting to unlock the door.  He stepped back as Papa immediately opened the door.
“Lock, I understand that you feel the need to be young right now” Mycroft said, eyes down as he carefully stripped the next band aid of its paper backing.  “And it’s okay that you take some time.”
Bunny nodded, hopped off of the stool Papa had found when they’d first arrived at the lake house, and hurried into the living room.  He was ready to see what Sherlock had built with his legos, maybe even help him or ask him to build a house for his rabbit.  But as he passed Sherlock--in the midst of a complicated lego structure with precisely organized colors and sizes--he noticed his brother refused to even make eye contact with him, his eyes shaded by his hair as he leaned over his structure, so Bunny resigned himself to a morning of playing by himself.
John rubbed a hand along the back of his neck.
But Sherlock only shrugged, and returned to his game.
Mycroft sighed.  He knew Sherlock had been desperate, but he hadn’t guessed the kid had already wet himself.  Mycroft’s plan for indifference clearly needed to be amended.  He moved to wrap an arm around Sherlock’s hunched shoulders.
John turned off the telly and grabbed his coat, following Sherlock out of the flat and over to their neighborhood pub
“Ooh, I’m terrified,” Sherlock spat with snark and sarcasm in his voice.  “What are you going to do, spank me?”
feel safe last night,” the boy said after a moment, voice just loud enough for Mycroft to hear.
John nodded and then lay his head against Mycroft’s shoulder, his toy hugged beneath his arm.
“I need to say ‘goodnight’ to ‘Lock.”
Greg sighed and patted Sherlock’s head.  The man had turned away from him, and had pulled the blankets up over his eyes.
“Can you come pick me up?” he mumbled, because the words were hard.
Mycroft continued speaking.
“Do you want to keep wearing your pink and purple pull-ups that Uncle Greg bought?”
John blushed, then nodded.  He knew Mycroft was waiting for him to go on, waiting for him to set the pace of the conversation.
“I’m not eating,” he said, pushing the pirate plate Papa had set down at his place away from him.  “And I don’t need a baby plate.”
Greg leaned over and pressed his lips to the man’s temple.
By the time the boys had been slathered in far more sunscreen than was necessary, Sherlock was on the verge of a tantrum and Bunny on the verge of tears from the worry that Sherlock would misbehave and be sent to timeout.  But as soon as Greg and Mycroft released them to the backyard, both boys racing each other to the waterfront, the mood was lifted.  Sherlock seemed to forget that he had been very close to losing his opportunity to swim, and Bunny found instant contentment when Sherlock took his hand as they raced down the hill towards the water.
Bunny was looking up at him with hope for the first time all day, and Mycroft could not help but smile at the man’s innocence in headspace.
“If I couldn’t be little, then I didn’t want Bunny to be a princess,” he said, and Mycroft nodded.
Bunny didn’t like feeling so far away from his Daddy.  Part of him knew it was his fault, that all he had to do was tell his Daddy he wanted to be cuddled too or about the doubts sifting through his mind that he was maybe a girl today, and then his Daddy would take him into his arms.  But the part of him that felt angry that his Daddy hadn’t figured it out for himself, the part of him that wondered if Daddy would still love him as a girl, told him the words would be too hard, that there was potentially too much to lose.  So he stayed quiet.
“Uncle Greg!” no fewer than three nieces and nephews called, rushing to Greg to be lifted or tickled or to have their hair tousled.
“You’re alright, string bean,” Mycroft said at long last.  “I’ve got you.”
“What’s up, bud?” Papa asked once he’d finished his conversation with Mycroft to find that Sherlock was studying him.  “Do I have food on my face like the little Bunny?”
“Doing alright?” Greg asked when they’d pulled to a stop at a gas station off the highway.
He knew Greg was repeating the question because he’d yet to receive a truthful answer, but Mycroft still wasn’t ready to admit just how on edge he’d been feeling since spending time away from London for the holidays, and he wasn’t about to crush Greg’s cheery excitement by explaining that he was not exactly up for an onslaught of additional holiday activities.  The man was donning a Santa hat and pajamas that matched the boys, for goodness’ sake.  If Mycroft was anything, he was a man who was skilled at ignoring emotion, so he simply forced a smile and nodded, turning back to the movie, which he had to admit, was more well-done than he’d anticipated.  For a children’s movie, the film was particularly true to Dickens’s original.
“Is that really what you want, kiddo?” Mycroft asked.
Mycroft’s discipline followed by a morning bath had done Sherlock well.  The boy had shifted into his baseline age of seven, and settled nicely in front of the telly to watch cartoons, surrounded by his plush alligator and dinosaur and the half-completed pirate ship he’d been building out of legos.  Sherlock even allowed Mycroft to periodically feed him bits of toast and jam for breakfast as the boy, searching for the right legos, crawled around on the blanket that had been spread out for him across the living room floor.
“Only fifteen, My, please,” he said, feeling his eyes watering from the pain.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft warned in his sternest voice.
Suggestions are welcome--hope you're all doing well :)
He reached for the cardboard folder that his paper dolls had come in, feeling a bit more confident after his chat with Papa that there was nothing wrong with wanting to play with them.  But when he flipped open the top flap and turned the envelope over, it was not paper dolls and paper clothes that fell out onto the living room carpet, but small pieces of cardstock, irregular and torn.
“Sherlock, can I help you color in the map?” Bunny tried, his voice a bit louder as he knelt next to Sherlock.
Mycroft made a sound of approval and crossed to the bathroom to look for the childish cartoon band aids before taking a seat next to his regressed brother in the kitchen.  Sherlock picked at the taupe-colored band aids plastered onto his injured hand.
“Hey, you’re okay,” Sherlock said, crouching down in front of him.  “Bad dream?”
Mycroft turned back to his current preoccupation, who was fidgeting in the corner.  He still needed to punish Sherlock, both to account for his misbehavior and for the sake of the man’s mental state.  But the long time-out had already done wonders to soothe the boy’s mind.  Mycroft knew he had a small window of opportunity to get to the bottom of Sherlock’s current negative thoughts before the boy--either settling back to his troublemaking seven-year-old self or sinking down to his neediest and youngest self--would not be able to accurately express his emotions.
Hope you're all well--sending you love and bunny kisses!
Daddy paused and turned back towards him, and it was clear he was a bit surprised by the request.  After all, Bunny hadn’t wanted to take off his night shirt for even a moment the day before.
