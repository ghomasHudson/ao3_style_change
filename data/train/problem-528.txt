Once they arrived at his flat. Greg went upstairs to his bedroom and came back with some pajama bottoms and a T-shirt.
“Don’t bullshit me Sherlock. I know what these cases mean to you and I will take them away if you don’t stop this.”
“For one...” he continued, rolling his hips again “I would be so hard anymore. Let me say thank you.”  he rasped out seductively.
John felt his face get hotter and hotter as each moment scattered around in his brain, attempting to put together what he saw.
The room suddenly felt too small and he couldn't stop his hand from shaking. Beads of sweat started collecting on his forehead.
But he also knows that She wouldn’t want it any other way. She’s one of the few people Greg knows Sherlock loves.
But he knew John couldn’t carry Sherlock up the stairs and to his room by himself and Mrs. Hudson has her hip…
Ran over to the door to try and open it but it was locked. He starting banging desperately on it, hoping Mrs. Hudson was in.
“If you can go out and do whatever you want and slag around with any pair of breast that bat their eyes at you then I can do whatever
“I’m sorry Sherlock, really I am. But I can’t let you back on a crime scene if you are going to show up in that state.”
“Go and get some sleep. Make sure you keep the bucket next to you. Please remember to use it. I can’t stress that enough. Now go and lay down.”
He was wearing dirty sweatpants with a shirt that looked even dirtier.  Thrown over that was his black coat. It looked out of place with his shabby clothes underneath.
“She left. A week ago.” Greg said drily.” I know you already knew that. Do you want to stay or not?” already feeling exhausted by this kid and started regretting his offer.
Johns stare turned into a harsh glare as anger started to boil up inside of him. Nose flaring. His hands clenching and unclenching in his lap.
Lestrade looks him over. “Look. You need to move from that area if you’re ever going to stay clean Sherlock. There’s too much temptation there.”
Yes. he was originally opposed to staying with Lestrade and getting clean but a large part of him was so tired of it all and wanted to give it up.
After a while he said “Won’t your wife have something to say about some junkie sleeping on your sofa?”
“Sherlock. You are here because I care about you and because I think you could be really great.” Lestrade said, looking down at him sincerely. “I don’t need you to thank me.  Don’t confuse my kindness for anything else. Don’t come into my bed again.”
He also had a strong urge to say something and remind him, with the slight hope that it would pull Sherlock off of Greg.
They stood shifting there for a moment with Sherlock between them with his head hanging low. His eyes were little slits. They had to hurry before his legs gave out.
He walked away into the kitchen and came back with a few bottles of water and set those on the coffee table.
Sherlock declined each offer of food but then picked up an eggroll and picked at it with his teeth. Eating small morsel at a time.
For the first time Greg is actually terrified of what he might do. It suddenly occurred to him that john is a very dangerous man.
The cold water felt good in his hands and then on his face as he splashed himself over and over again.
“I just thought we could have some fun during our time together.” He grinned sinfully and wiggled his hips, brushing against Greg’s groin.
“I just meant to clean up until the drugs are out of your system so you can start working with us again. That is all.”
He opts to stay silent. He didn’t know what to say to something like that and he doesn’t think he even has the energy to conjure up bitter retort.
“Oh, really now?” he purrs and bends his neck to place his face on Lestrade’s shoulder and starts twisting his body into him
When Lestrade appeared at the bottom of the steps. He had fresh pajamas in his hands and extra blankets and a pillow.
“You really are insane.” He chuckled. “Sherlock, I brought you here to help you, How would I be helping you if I was also fucking you while you had drugs in your system and going through withdrawals?"
After three full weeks of living together, when Sherlock seemed to reach the peak of whatever ailed him, he just… disappeared. For the next few days, without any warning in John’s direction, Sherlock was simply gone. He left his keys on the table, and while there was no sign of a struggle or hasty retreat, John couldn’t help but worry.
Sally guffawed, flapping her hand at her stomach as if she couldn’t breathe. “Angry? For a rejected shag? God, no. It’s not like I was in love with the man, it’s only that I can’t have sex with anyone I’m directly in command of when we’re in the ship. I just thought I might as well give it a shot down here, considering.”
Rosie sleeps through the whole cab ride, and Sherlock stares. John can feel his eyes on his cheek like a physical thing, and he stubbornly refuses to call him out on it or, god forbid, meet his gaze. The air is thick with things unspoken, and John’s head is filled to the brink with questions unasked.
It’s quiet. Past the heater, John can hear the barely-there susurrus of snowflakes settling onto the ground in mounds, even through the window. A car passes, slow and careful atop the unpredictable frost, and John relates to it on a personal level. He hesitates. “Last night. Or this morning, rather. I’m sorry I couldn’t… well. I got scared.”
John wanted to say something more, but he chose otherwise, closing his mouth with a click in his jaw. After a long moment, though, he couldn’t resist. “Is your… employer coming, then?”
Well, Sherlock did. John, underestimating the drop as well as the stiffness of his bad leg after four hours of disuse, hit the pavement wrong and nearly crumpled to the concrete. But then Sherlock was there, a cool arm wrapped around his waist to steady him before his knees could make contact.
ME: No, no. Well, of course, as a pregnancy hasn’t naturally been conceived in nearly a year, but nothing currently.
he was, in the beginning. Four months in, the brilliance and rush of the chase dimmed until it was lackluster. A year in, he was dreading every next location, every new identity. The men and women that he’d killed weighed on him, scarred him alongside the deep cuts and lashes that decorated his back. But there was a motivator, at least.
“But you are, aren’t you?” He could feel Lestrade watching him, weighing his next words carefully. “So not just flatmates, then.”
A pause, and then John was pushing him out of the crowd, guiding Sherlock around tables and chairs and people until he hit a wall. It was dark away from the dance floor, and surprisingly empty, relatively speaking. John’s hands were creeping up to his neck.
Sherlock jolts and blinks back to the present, as if he were halfway across London and just found himself in this bar, right now, plucked and dropped from the sky. His jaw works around invisible words, and he hurriedly takes a giant step back until they’re a respectable distance apart, eyes wide and disorientated and utterly… lost.  John hates the space between them, almost as much as he hates himself.
“How many vampires do you know?” He took a long drag, blowing it out to mingle with London’s exhaust. “It’s not like it’ll kill me, now.”
She hummed after that, but then her patient asked her a question, and they both got drawn into their work. He felt her eyes on him all morning. When the drive officially ended, just before three, John went ahead and clocked out before she could ambush him. At the flat, Sherlock was gone, and didn’t show back up until it had become nighttime.
“Still at the old bakery. She’s living up to her name, I can tell you that. But I’m sure you can tell.” He patted at his stomach, earning a chuckle from John. “We’re expecting our second, actually. Our first is twenty-seven months.”
It was like he was addicted, a niggling in his bones that called for action. For a dying soldier in his hands, for something to sew and wrap and
John realized that his eyes weren’t just adjusting to the darkness, but that the first hints of dawn were beginning to lighten up the sky. He pushed himself up into sitting position, grunting at the tender spot at his side where Sherlock had shoved him. The chill was aching at his shoulder and thigh, but he’d be damned if he was letting his limp return. Ever since he got to the ICAM, the change in scenery had made it dormant.
When she glanced up, her smile dropped. Not entirely, but with the barest tensing of her shoulders, it turned into something more ingenuine. Pasted on. A barely-there shiver racked down her body, and if she had hackles, they’d be positively raised. Her eyes didn't meet his, not exactly. John took an involuntary step back. Jesus Christ, what did Sherlock
Sherlock checked his watch, and with a noise of irritation he slid his phone into his inside pocket and stood. “No time, we need to leave.” He held the door open for John, who nodded slightly as he passed.
Mrs. Hudson gave both of them a curious glance, before letting out a gasp to totter into the kitchen and finish what Sherlock started amidst the sound of spattering bacon. The pair didn’t move.
Though the man was still facing straight ahead, John swore he felt his eyes on him. “And boyfriends?”
“Exactly,” she snorts, straightening the collar of Rosie’s holiday dress. His daughter seems positively delighted to be in the arms of a stranger, and he’s not in a hurry to ruin that, even if the stranger is a woman he used to rank high on his (admittedly metaphorical) DNR list. After a beat, Sally clears her throat.
ME: You answered accordingly to a direct question that obviously strays from a predictable phrase. I’m impressed. Perhaps you’re not merely an amateur program.
And then Sherlock’s face shatters, so wonderful and horrible all at once, and John’s nose is squashed against his neck when his arms pull him back and tighten, elbows hooked around his shoulders and chest shaking in quiet sobs. John goes willingly and wraps his arms around Sherlock’s waist, murmuring words into his skin that he couldn’t remember if he tried. They’re broken, John knows, and all that’s left for them is to shudder together through the pulsing waves and try not to drown.
Mycroft sighed, expression unsurprised. “You would,” he agreed. “That’s where you differ from the good doctor, it seems.”
The cemetery was quaint, in a word, a family of moss-draped oaks bathing the land in a greenish hue. The late afternoon was sharp with a dry wind flying over the moors. The gravestones were in no particular order nor structure, and as far as John could tell, there has been no new additions since the last time he visited. It took much too long to find his father’s slab.
ME: I knew I’d hit the bottom eventually. Just remember not to compare yourself to humans, most of them are idiots. You are making remarkable progress towards your understanding, however. It took approximately two-hundred words longer than yesterday until you couldn’t understand me  enough to form a response.
Thirteen was studying him openly, brown eyes darting around his face as he tried to see if John had some sort of ulterior motive. When nothing was forthcoming, the boy nodded. “That’s fine,” he said simply.
On the elliptical, John was just reaching his third mile when Sherlock appeared, leaning across from him at the helm of his machine. He was winded, cheeks flushed and curls plastered handsomely against his forehead. But his attention was utterly enraptured elsewhere, eyes trained somewhere over John’s right shoulder.
Every Monday he’d ask his schedule for the week, which labs he’d be assigned to and who he’d be assisting. Every Monday she’d glance at that blasted post-it note on her desk, and every Monday she’d purse her lips and read off names that definitely didn’t sound like the one they were both awaiting to hear.
John hoarsed, arms moving on their own accord to curl around Sherlock’s waist and pull them impossibly together. He buried his face into the curve of Sherlock’s neck. “You...”
“Fruity,” John complained, though he went back to drink the remaining few drops like Sherlock had instructed all those bars ago. Sherlock was frankly mesmerized by the line of John’s throat as he swallowed. He pulled out his phone to type in the data, but realized it was dead. With a purse of his lips, he stuffed the information halfheartedly into his Mind Palace to log in later.
Sherlock tilt his head back, so the words are spoken against John’s mouth. “As long as you’ll have me,” he murmurs.
A breath. And then, ever so slowly, John lifted up his own hand so that it pressed against Sherlock’s through the glass. He liked to imagine that he could feel the man’s warmth against his palm.
Sherlock flicked his eyes back to John, and the graveness in his expression made his face seem uncomfortably gaunt. “You have my word,” he said seriously, “that going outside of the dome and taking my readings is something that I need to do. If the data I take from my body and the environment proves my hypothesis… millions of lives and future lives here on Earth can be saved.”
John wasn’t able to make it to the morning block, so he arrived to the second one. After lunch, he was just finishing his stretching when Sherlock ghosted at his side. John couldn’t help but blink up at him in surprise. “You’re actually here.”
alternatives. I’ve heard of a family in America who feeds purely on animal blood, though the practice is rare. While it’s enough to survive off of, it’s really not enough to thrive.”
John hummed through a smile, body slid all the way down until only his head was propped against the door, chin to his chest. “Yes,” he decided.
It wasn’t his place, either, but he couldn’t stop thinking of the possibility and Sherlock's prolonged absence. Maybe all that John’s been noticing was a relapse, and Sherlock has to leave every few weeks to get a fix? It’s not unheard of, though the symptoms and time frame were a bit off.
John felt guilty that he had to ask, as if John would say no. But that’s when he remembered something, his happiness starting to fade. “Are you sure you don’t have plans instead?” He questioned.
They pulled into a line of buildings with a proper parking lot, not at Canary Wharf but somewhere smaller and strung up with lights. Sherlock parked directly in front of the foremost one, a sort of Asian restaurant, and John furrowed his brows. “Why aren’t we at home?”
John makes a mental promise to punch Mycroft in the nose the next time he sees him. As it is, he nudges the detective as he strums, the rhythm aimless and vague, now. “I’ve been thinking,” he says, ignoring Sherlock’s snort. “About what you said, a few months back. If we had met whenever we were younger. I think that… I would’ve liked you. Even if you were a git, like whenever we first met, because we’re still together years later. Somehow. Er, point is. I don’t think there’s a certain age we could’ve met at, or a certain place, or even a certain circumstance that wouldn’t have eventually brought us right here. Where we… are supposed to be.”
He pursed his lips when he couldn’t find the words, but the other man carried on just fine. “Mycroft, please. And you were in medical school for eight years, though you dropped out just before graduation due to a familial emergency.” John clenched his left fist in alarm. “It says in my files that you were top of your class each year there, and you made a near-perfect score on the finals you did manage to take. That’s enough to be going off of now, don’t you think?”
“Look. why don’t you come and stay at my place while you get cleaned up? Then you can look for a better place to live.”
“Yes. But you showed up high. I want you to work on these cases with us Sherlock. But I can’t allow you to do it high. I warned you.”
Lestrade seemed to understand that Sherlock wasn’t really in the mood for talking and just left him alone.
Greg looked at him and saw vulnerability in his eyes and his youth. He knew what taking this away from him would do to him. He would probably find him in an alley dead from an overdose within the week.
John is aware that sometimes Sherlock doesn’t realize that he’s not in a room and figures that maybe the drugs had the reverse affect.
“What are you carrying on about? I solved the case for you.” Sherlock glared at Lestrade with his glassy eyes.
“Oh, my Detective!” Sherlock purred. Sliding his hand down Lestrade’s pajamas and grazing his cock, which was partially hard.
Sherlock nervously moved around the room settling on the couch, drinking some water and then throwing the blanket over himself.
He turned around briefly to look inside the car and quickly turned back. They haven't moved. John is still staring at him but Sherlock eyes are now closed. Greg hoped they can get him upstairs to his bed before he says anything else.
The nurse winks at John, throws a glance at Sherlock and leaves. Sherlock glares at her as she walks away.
He plops himself down into the chair and puts the pillow behind his head while reclining the chair back.
Now, they were in John’s bathroom readying for the Galactic Gala, as it was cheekily called. It was an enormous event thrown for the residents of the ICAM (as the twenty thousand or so people had all dedicated themselves to everything regarding the Intrepid), and broadcasted around the world for each sector to officially see the crew and learn more about the terrifyingly close launch date. It was a very formal thing, John had soon realized when the tuxedo had appeared in his wardrobe. Luckily Sherlock had swarmed into his room ten minutes ago, perfectly dressed, as if he could sense John’s cluelessness and immediately remedy it.
“One would,” John sighed. “I’m just- well, I can’t be the only medical school drop out that they’re interested in.”
“‘Rache’ is German for revenge,” a man in scrubs said in a nasal voice from the crime scene’s doorway. He must be Anderson. “Perhaps she committed suicide
John’s mind was reeling. “That doesn’t make any sense,” he said. “The virus wasn’t created, it emerged naturally. What is it that we find in our blood, then, if it doesn’t exist?”
Sherlock stormed away, all legs and cheekbones. John, after the initial shock and rushed apologies, had to practically jog to catch up. Which was a lot tougher with a cane.
“At least you warned me about the violin playing,” he says carefully. Might as well push everything out to the open. “You didn’t know about the anger problems, the unexpected baby crying at all hours of the night, the wife who tried to murder you…”
make sure to tip off the universities Benjamin applied to, to just where he got his applications from.”
” Sherlock suddenly blurted, emphatically, as if the objection had come from the baser of his being. He tried to mask the emotion in his eyes, turning his head to stare off into the dining room once more, but he didn’t succeed. “It’s a bit too late for that, wouldn’t you say? Though…” he huffed. “Living together has certainly been immensely difficult.”
The rail was simple enough to latch onto as it began slow, and there were several notches on the exterior that they could grab. Surprisingly, no one noticed the two men darting onto the magnetic track and hopping on the back of a train, which really said something about how much the general public observed at five in the morning.
It takes a few moments for Sherlock to realize that his arms are curled around nothing, but when he does, he rushes back to the present with a whoosh of air. He looks at his hands dumbly, then John’s arms, and his eyes are absolutely lost. “I…”
The hand disappeared. “Oh, sorry,” John commented, eyes slightly hazy when he looked over. Then his gaze fell to Sherlock’s mouth. “My mistake,” he muttered, wetting his lips before turning back to Lestrade.
He starts up strumming, knee gently bopping to an invisible metronome. It’s a bit rough, but a guitar can get away with any woody sounds, unlike the violin. His fingers on the fretboard are, frankly, mesmerizing. The chords aren’t basic anymore, something more personable and evocative, flush with an unfamiliar feeling, broad without any specific notes to carry on a melody. His lips are pressed together, eyes mirthful, as if trying to hide a smile. Coy. It takes John much too long to recognize the music.
“It’s 05:30,” he said. “We need to hurry and get out of here before sunrise. It’s already beginning to lighten up.”
He could ask. He could turn Sherlock around and demand him to tell him what happened, to scold him for not showing John before, for not feeling as though he could confide such a secret in him.
Sherlock helped him up, hands steady around his waist. “You’re asking me that?” He bit out in a gruff voice. He almost seemed angry. “I should have never brought you out here.”
“No,” John replies truthfully. He leans over it to look out the window, to where Molly and Rosie are crossing the street. “Painless?”
John nearly stumbled, which would be much worse when the person couldn’t walk well to begin with. “No! Not possible, that’s – god, that’s older than me!” He studied him with even more fervor, trying to find any sign of middle-age. Nothing obvious came to surface. “What’s your secret? Only eating organic, taking the stairs, ground-up rhino tusk in your smoothie?”
Mary waved away the question, finishing her tea. Iced tea. When John warned that Mary had unexpectedly began craving the dreaded beverage, Sherlock made sure to keep it stocked at all times. “No, he got it. He just texted me, should only be a few minutes. But this gives me time to talk to you about something.”
just to drop his aggressive ‘not-gay’ mantra and give into his attraction. Where every heated look, every touch, every moment of tension was immediately disregarded depending on sobriety. Was John the sort of person that could feel attraction on a whim? Where he could see Sherlock just as another bloke until he decided he was good for another shag, and then he was ‘beautiful’ and ‘brilliant’?
And that’s when Molly squeaks. She widens her eyes and stiffens in her seat, as if she’d just solved the equation that’s been on her whiteboard for years. She starts blinking quickly in a very Sherlockian fashion, so much so that John has to trail off in worry.
The computer hummed as it worked, and when the results loaded, one of the links caught his eye. ‘How to know if you are a vampire’. It sounded fake, rudimentary, but that’s all John had at the moment. He quickly scanned through the list.
Okay, just let the record show that, no matter how bad it looks from the outside, John Watson was not a right bastard.
Sherlock’s lips twisted. “On the contrary, John, blood is my entire reason of existence.” Despite the worrying statement, he shook John’s grip off to dab at the scrape. “Just because I’m a vampire doesn’t mean I’ve no self-control.”
Sector 2 took up a series of land, once called the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Western Europe. There used to be some separation by water, but in these days with such a harsh sun, the land was fully connected by rails over deep, dry chasms. Water could only be found in the more isolated parts of the planet, away from civilization.
“Only a few seconds,” the redhead piped up. John had always been bad at names. “D’you remember who hit you?”
A whiff of familiar fragrance, and then the men restraining John were ripped away, like a giant hand from the sky had plucked them up and off. With pure military instinct, John dove forward and immediately disarmed the knife-wielder with a jab to the wrist, kicking out his legs from beneath him. He pressed his foot hard against the man’s throat.
Before this new reality, Earth was roughly 71% covered in water. Closing halfway through the third millennium, the number had dropped to 35%. The decline was only becoming more rapid with time. Where John lived was in the northern parts of the Sector where there used to be a ‘coast’, as relics were still being found from a more water-centric time, buried beneath the dried-up seabeds. Now, there wasn’t even a glisten of the liquid as far as John could see, only the gradual decline of the land into sand-crusted canyons.
"Okay... that's at least doable," John said slowly, nodding his head. "Wait - there are some chasms just outside. I remember seeing them when arriving here the first day, something about the dehydration of the receding ocean drying up the coast. It's rocky and kilometers deep, isn't it?"
Sherlock rubbed at the swelling around the cut lightly with his bare hands, his skin just as good as an icepack. John sighed in relief. Sherlock seemed to notice, as he didn’t stop the gentle contact. “Cut and dry, my kind should primarily live off of human blood to sustain at the peak of our abilities. A body a week is roughly what a vampire can live off of comfortably. Now, there
John’s eyes lit up. “No!” He replied triumphantly, face looking as if he was trying to damndest to control another fit of giggles. He struggled to push himself back up from the floor.
No, John wasn’t going to lose this. Not a chance. Thinking on the fly, he reached out his free hand to grab Mary’s and squeeze, fingers threading through hers. He kept the franticness out of his face and words. “Please,” he asked, letting a smile curve his lips. “I’d love to hear it, regardless.”
The ground dropped beneath him, buckling his knees and throwing him forward. The vibrations were thunderous, the sounds like crashing drums and striking cymbals as the avalanche dragged down his torso. “Sherlock!” He screamed, managing to lock his fingers onto the stationary cliffside closest to him and latch on for dear life. His feet hit nothing but the ragged wall in front of him; he risked a glance down, and the void had made a reappearance beneath him.
When he straightened, Sherlock was looking his way. The volume of the song they were listening to lowered. “I can make the trip in less than four hours, I’d bet,” he said conversationally.
It hurt. And then John muttered “Sherlock,” in such a small breathy voice, and the pain gave way into a much more startling hurt that pricked at the corners of his eyes. John began to move, and Sherlock lost himself.
“I’ve entrusted my brother in your care for the better part of a decade,” he says finally. His voice is wry, the closest to humor as he’ll ever get. “I would hate for you to have nothing to show for it.”
The ground was cakey, and what looked dusty was just a fine layer of film that stuck to his fingers when he touched it. There didn’t seem to be any excess dirt that could be transferred to the vial. Nothing came off even when he scraped his thumbnail against the rough ground, and only minimal dirt puffed up if he roughly shuffled his feet against the earth. That would have to be good enough. After a few minutes of kicking and scooping with the vial, there was only about a centimeter of dirt at the bottom of the palm-wide length. Clammy sweat was running down his temples at the exertion. He sighed, his breath puffing in the cool air.
John didn’t know if it was a good idea, but he was going to say it anyway. “When I first saw you,” he said, “I thought you looked very familiar, almost as if we’ve met before. I don’t know where, or how, but… A name came to mind. Is ‘RJ’ alright? Can I call you that?”
A moment of quiet, and then the voice was almost gentle. “Because I need to determine if you’re worth the effort or not.”
“John Watson,” a female voice greeted as he arrived to the directed room. This woman was definitely an AI, John noted uneasily, with pretty features and the trademark impassive eyes. “I’m Anthea, assistant to the First Officer of the DSE Intrepid. Would you like to take a seat?”
regret this. He takes in a great big breath to clear his head, then releases it, and finds that it didn’t help in the slightest. “... Sure.”
John noticed, himself, and made to pull back. “No,” he protested in self-reprimanding. “I’m sorry, that’s… I’m not here for…”
,” John says, purposefully ignoring that little tidbit, “I was in med school, you were in your last year of secondary, presumably. Just wondering, is all. If we had met then.”
ME: We haven’t yet even perfected animal cloning. It may be a few years yet until human cloning is widespread, and even then it’s not without its dangers.
Sherlock skidded to a stop, looking around frantically despite his blindness, trying to get a read on sound alone. There was a cacophony of sound, out of tune. Dissonant. Fortissimo.
John sighed under his breath, shifting in his seat as he struggled to find the words he wanted to say. “I… well, it’s really not the best idea, is it? I mean, there’s a reason we aren’t supposed to go outside. It’s too dangerous.”
They sound like a married couple, John realizes with a jolt. It wipes the smile from his face, but Sherlock doesn’t even notice, head ducked to watch himself finger out the correct patterns. John feels his heart throb once, painfully. It should be more bittersweet than it really is, should remind him of the domesticity he’d had with his dead wife with a much harsher potency. It doesn’t. It’s been happening for months, after all; the only difference is how long it took for him to notice. Warmth fills his abdomen, like a jug of sunlight spilling over and topping him up.
His brain keeps trying to add on an asterisk with a (3x) noted at the bottom, but he pretends he can’t hear it.
“That’s a banjo, Rosamund,” Sherlock corrects, squinting at the label on the violin strings in his other hand. Anything vaguely round is a ball in Rosie’s book. John shuffles up behind them, dropping a kiss to his daughter’s head and peeking at the box in Sherlock’s hand with a frown.
John grumbled something in response, but pocketed the card anyway. Clouds were quickly rolling in, covering up the sun until the sunlight was merely diffused. Upon finding a parking spot and switching gears to park, the pair opened their doors in unison and slid to the ground.
“John, I’ll meet you back at the hotel tonight,” Sherlock murmured, eyes never leaving Mary. It was almost a surrender. “Mary, nice to meet you.”
“Sounds like a plan.” It was so domestic, this scene they were in, that John felt himself wanting to drop a kiss atop the man’s head. He didn’t, but it was a close thing. “Well, I’m off.”
When Rosie notices him standing in the doorway, she shimmies down the sofa to toddle excitedly over to him. “Da!” She cries, pushing herself against John’s shins with her arms reaching up expectantly. John laughs and swings her up, pressing a kiss to her cheek.
ME: This ‘Baskerville’ program is nothing more than what has been done before. You’re programmed to learn, which is to take input and generate output. There’s no understanding, only randomized generating to simulate unpredictability and mental advancement. You’re a simple machine. You will never be able to
The rail to Quincy Street was six minutes long, despite the near-100 kilometer distance. Though John had grown up with nothing less, the fact of today’s technology never fell short of amazing him whenever it could.
ME: It’s either this or the impending World War III. At least the news hasn’t set off any nuclear bombs, as of yet. With hope, this could be the turning point the governments need towards worldwide peace and cooperation to find a solution.
John nodded. “And you?” He said, unwilling to let the conversation go right away. “What’s your ‘type’?”
silver, a metallic almost-white color that had the same depth as a storm, shades of grays swirling almost amber towards the pupil. From a distance, you’d hardly be able to tell where the sclera ended and the iris began. John couldn't break their gaze.
“Because of you,” John murmured back, not technically dishonest. “What are you doing? We have, what, an hour until wake up? Two until launch?”
Crime scenes and prying DIs behind them, they walked. Sherlock still didn’t meet John's eyes, but he couldn’t stop the smile of his own, small and endlessly fond. “In all my years, I’ve never had my heart broken before.” He huffed to himself. “I don’t think I could survive it.”
The head engineer pursed his lips. “I would’ve heard if there was any sort of accident, doctor,” he said slowly. “Are you positive?”
At first, Sherlock didn’t notice, armchair pointed towards the telly and face propped in his hand. He had never been one to watch television, but here he was, eyes glazed over in insomnia as a ‘Captain Kirk’ manned the bridge of a highly illogical ship with negligible science backing its ‘warp speed’ factor. John had liked this show, he remembered.
“I’d bet,” came a voice from somewhere above. “You’re supposed to dodge when you see a rugby ball comin’ your way, coach.”
“John, look!” he exclaims, holding up a cherry wood tobacco pipe with a long, elegant stem. On its bowl is a carving that depicts a ship lost at sea. John levels him with wry, narrowed eyes.
John watched Sherlock’s face downturn, like the cast of a shadow. His lips tensed, and his brows slanted sharply over narrowed eyes. He looked completely different, yet utterly familiar.
Sherlock was completely in his element, practically molded into his leather seat with one hand propped on the wheel in, truthfully, the most relaxed pose John’s ever seen him in. He was rare in this human casualness, both in body language and fashion. He wore dark jeans and a thin v-neck, long sleeves pushed up to his elbows and neckline cutting just below the hollow of his throat. The burgundy color was fetching, John noticed, though there were few colors that Sherlock wouldn’t look good in. Troubled, John stripped himself of his jumper to the gray tee underneath, much too hot despite the air-conditioning. He leaned over the console to throw it on the backseat.
The silence was comfortable, free of pitying glances towards his cane. John had nearly forgotten that Mike was there until he spoke back up.
Thirteen’s face was downturned towards the ship, but John spotted a small smile. “It will,” he admitted. “I’m not done yet.”
“Nicely put,” replied Mycroft. “One would be a fool to ignore a formal invitation from Sector A, wouldn’t one?”
Sherlock pursed his lips, a barely-there dimple flashing beside his mouth worriedly. “You shouldn’t, you know. Trust me.”
“I got it… years ago,” John said carefully, his breath nearly back. “I know it’s ugly. It doesn’t bother me… too much anymore.”
John meant to say something more, but Sherlock was already deep within the recesses of his mind. There’d be no getting him back for a while more, so John retired for the night.
“Oh, really?” Sherlock asked sarcastically, rolling his eyes at the stupidity. At least John had realized the error of his words right after speaking them, so there was
“Hm. I asked for three.” He finally glanced her way and offered her a grin half-hidden by the mask, so spontaneously dazzling that the poor girl never stood a chance. “Is there any way you can stretch it?”
sparring, but he nodded along all the same, though still puzzled. “Okay, yes. And you’re trying to leave because…”
Sherlock was caught off-guard for a moment, surprised that John didn’t question more about the earlier incident, but he recovered rather quickly. “Oh, John, I thought you’d never ask.” And then John’s favorite grin slid on Sherlock’s face, the crooked one that nudged his eyes and made him look so achingly
There was a corner booth at the very end, nestled against the wall and under a lonely hanging light. The table was so small that their knees knocked together beneath it, but John wasn’t going to object. “I’ll have a coke,” he told the waitress.
“Wait a second,” Harry interrupted, finishing off her cup of juice during one of her visits. John, in his own determined way, refused to stock alcohol in his flat. “So you’re saying you didn’t do anything? Didn’t give him a dirty look, shag his girl, nothing?”
“Oh, okay,” Thomas said simply, tension draining from his shoulders. That had to be a massive perk when it came to dealing with men; for the most part, they didn’t feel the need to pry. An uncomfortable rock sat in John’s stomach, and he had to level his breathing.
There were a few tense minutes of silence, ones where John refrained to look around and find Sherlock for support. Before he could plan to leave, though, Thirteen (RJ) gave out a sound of joy. “Done!” He announced, setting the Intrepid model carefully on the floor between them. He glanced back up at John. “Would you like to try it?”
John tried to follow, calling out Sherlock’s name and pulling on his shoes with halfhearted tugs, but it was no use. When he stumbled out into the night air, roads at a lull and streetlamps flickering, it was to emptiness. If John hadn’t known this bloody man for coming on six years, he might’ve run around greater London to find him, but he knew that Sherlock was probably going to one of his boltholes to hide away for the night. John was supposed to work tomorrow; at that point, he’d sneak his way back. Proceeding to horribly avoid John for the coming weeks, almost definitely.
Sherlock turned, slowly, and met John’s eyes. He looked almost scared for the splittest of seconds, before painting his face carefully blank. “No,” he said lightly, not breaking their stare. The animosity was dimmed, but still smoldering beneath his eyes. “Thank you, Sarah.”
Sherlock scoots over some more. John slides next to him, and finds himself having to sit closer to support the body of the instrument in a way that isn’t uncomfortable. They’re pressed along their arms and thighs, Sherlock’s other hand on the fretboard, and they’re very purposefully avoiding direct eye-contact, the heat stifling between their clothes and buzzing as if they’d been set on vibrate. Rosie’s tottering around the sitting room, paying them no mind.
Sherlock didn’t mention the subject change, though he definitely noticed it. He glanced up from the screen with confusion at the words. “Who?”
He let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. “That was reckless, Sherlock. You could have died.
But by the third night, John eating alone in the dining hall at 21:00, the character himself made a reappearance.
“We both know that’s true,” his brother complied, “as much as you are now learning that it’s not very easily ignored.”
Sherlock cocked his head, closer to the glass than John had thought. His own elbow was similarly braced, hand cupped at the back of his neck. “What do you mean?”
Afterwards, Sherlock tugged on his pants and kept his back to John, careful to hide his wet eyes and ruddy cheeks.
So John left for the ship ten minutes before call time, dressed in the last t-shirt he would be able to wear outside of sleeping for quite a while. He had a bundle of anticipation in his gut, utterly excited to see the spaceship as if he was a little kid. He’d have his nose pressed up against the glass very soon at this rate.
“Sherlock!” He shouted over the rising volume of the ship. God, Sherlock was further down than he thought. “Try not to breathe very much!”
John clenched his left fist, though not out of anger, and felt the slight tremor it held. He definitely couldn’t go back to his doctoring ways, not in this state. “That’s… actually perfect, Mike. I’d love to be back in Bart’s, even if it’s just cleaning beakers and yelling at students for snogging in the corners.” Oh, how the tables have turned. Mike smiled.
John doesn’t put up any pretenses. He quotes, almost conversationally, “‘It certainly did the trick’.”
John blinked, pursing his lips in both thought and slight confusion. He shook his head, more to clear it than anything. He was going, though, wasn’t he? A demand masked as an invitation from the most powerful collection of people on Earth.
. The college likes to hold one to welcome any incoming students for the next semester, and they, erm, like to invite the workers as well.” She tried for a smile, but it was more of a grimace. “Sherlock never likes to go, but I didn’t know if you felt the same way…”
Sherlock’s asleep. He’s sprawled out on his stomach, ankles hanging off one side and face smashed against the other. One of his arms is curled underneath him, while the other extends past the arm of the sofa, like he’s reaching for something beyond them both. It doesn’t look comfortable for anyone, let alone a 40 year old man, but his face is completely relaxed and his breathing is even. The leather shines from the condensation.
“Because,” he says, eyes boring through John’s and tendering the barest amount, “Between the both of us, I’m the brain. That leaves you the heart, and you never fail to do something kind for someone else. You’re more heart than I am brain. That’s why, ‘obviously’.”
Hard arms reached up to wrap around John’s shoulders, tugging him into a surprising and dreadfully intimate embrace. Sherlock’s breath was shallow and hot against John’s neck, fingers hooking into his jumper. John couldn’t help the sound he let out, small and airy.
John felt the chip buzz to life, and he couldn’t help a wince at the sensitivity. “I really hate this thing,” John grumbled.
In the following days, Sherlock became scarce as quickly as he had first appeared. After their initial spar, with an excuse of further experiments he needed to tend to, he faded back into the crowd, and then from the training facility itself. John found himself thinking after the man when he failed to come the next morning; after all, they were partners now, weren’t they? And wasn’t John somehow part of a plan, now, one that seemed of utmost importance while being explained? Surely Sherlock wouldn’t skip out on training, now that he knew he had someone waiting for him. However, for the rest of the day, there was no sign of him.
Rosie’s fussing, so John pulls out a toy cell phone he had gotten inside one of the stores. Instead of pressing the light-up buttons, it goes right into her mouth. “I’m going to give you the presents I bought, as per your not-deduction.”
“Doubtful. Maybe you should stop arguing with a wall, perhaps that’s how the attention is being drawn.”
Sherlock had rendered him speechless. There should be a medal for that, somewhere. Had Mary ever rendered him speechless? At that thought, Sherlock sobered and realized what exactly was happening. It was his
And then the fifth time, almost exactly four weeks ago. John found that he wasn’t upset that Molly knew, only that she was angry. At
Before he could leave, he felt a hand brush his arm. It was as quick as a breath, and John already felt the goosebumps arise from the chill.
John throws down the newspaper with a sigh, twining his fingers together instead and staring him down. “Am I what, Sherlock?”
Day fades, lovers twine, and in the morning, lips press to bare skin as warm as sunlight. Eyes open. And somewhere, far away, a clock is chiming midnight and Sherlock makes good of their New Year’s promise every day of the year.
“The summer solstice banquet! It’s next Friday, and it’s always a lot of fun. I was hoping that we could go together.” Her smile was warm, so unlike Molly’s awkward invitation. Regardless, John felt that same discomfort.
“No,” they said simultaneously, both blinking at him. John eyed them both for a brief moment, almost suspiciously.
“To the hull. The engine room.” There was a doorway, but Sherlock motioned John off to the side so it wouldn’t sense them and automatically slide open. He met John’s eyes steadily. “I need you to cover me to the center of the hull, where the landing thrusters are being prepared. From there, on the right wall there’s an exit and a cleansing station as well for the engineers. I can use that for coming back aboard.”
Sherlock’s brows furrowed in a way that had no right being so adorable. “What the bloody hell does that have-“
With a scream, she collapsed and began convulsing in the grass, and John could only watch in fright, cold dread dripping into his stomach like syrup. He
Another AI. John tried to control his distaste. He wasn’t inherently racist, after all, but this was different, wasn’t it? John didn’t exactly have a pleasant history with the kind. The man sat at the chair across from him gracefully, hooking his umbrella around the arm of his chair. His eyes were vacant of anything other than calculation, a tell-tale sign of being made of wires, and his movements were far too measured.
“I got a report about a severed finger in the hull. I don’t understand how you haven’t heard about it, a severed finger would result in quite a bit of blood.”
“Sherlock?” John questioned, feeling alarmed. With his adrenaline having lowered considerably, the various aches around his body were making themselves known.
“Sh’lock! I’m home!” John yelled from the doorway, even though Sherlock was currently in his armchair typing from John’s laptop. He glanced up, and in one sweep he was able to deduce that not only was John
“You were paired with them on the first day. Since you weren’t here, though, I’ll assign you to…” His eyes darted along the crowd of people, searching the different faces with an increasingly tight brow. “Sector 2 isn’t here yet, as per usual. You’re from Sector 2, yeah? Have you met your representative yet?”
Sherlock set down his cup, only breaking his stare to lift a jam-slathered slice of toast to his mouth. “You shouldn’t let him bother you. You’re not the one he’s after.”
“I found it,” Sherlock called from further back in the small clearing. He was cleaning off the lichens from the stone with his elbow, sleeves bunched at the bicep. John limped his way over, careful on the slick ground beneath his feet.
– ahem, I mean the pleasant smell of it. Horrid for its potency. It’s driving me utterly mad, but it makes me feel… it makes
“What blood type are you?” John asked that morning, a whim of a question. He was sipping a coffee, his drink of choice after a sleepless night; recently, a near daily occurrence.
He turned his head, only to find Sherlock holding one of the men in midair with just a hand at his throat. His eyes were as wild as his unruly hair, the latter looking as if he’d been pulling at it with restless fists, and his teeth were bared dangerously, like some sort of wild animal. His feet, for whatever reason, were filthy and bare.
He does, his nimble fingers flipping the fabric. He hums at the sight of Leonard Nimoy, hand raised in the Vulcan salute with ‘Illogical’ typed in bright red boldface.
“Only a few chords at the shop, against my will.” He pulls out a guitar pick from thin air, apparently, and runs it along the strings in a gentle strum. “G major,” he murmurs.
Sherlock turns his head and nods John towards the table, where there’s already tea brewing and applesauce ready on the highchair. John sets Rosie all up with a bib and a spoon, and lets her go wild.
“I killed her!” John shouted over the thunder, closer than before but still much too far. “She tried to... I killed her.” He stepped closer. Sherlock had no way of knowing that John was precisely the length of an arm away, his sense of sound in such a loud atmosphere touchy at best, but he could
And then there was the sex. But that was eleven months, one week, and six days ago; he was sure John had forgotten about it, really. Sherlock sure had, of course.
saved myself, not wait around for some poncy git with a hero complex to hold my hand.” He crossed his arms. “I’m not
Sherlock shifted the car into park and met John’s eyes, the picture of innocence. “Because we’re here instead.” At John’s unamused stare, he continued, wary. “You haven’t eaten since we were in Stansex, and I have on good authority that human beings require food to survive. Hence, dinner.”
They banter back and forth for a bit. John tries to stop thinking about Sherlock in love, of clumsily learning chords for an unseen figure perched on his bed, of stuttering and blushing and tripping over his feet and holding out a hand to hold another in his own. Of intimate nights in the dark, of movie theaters, of playful laughs and touches, of pulling another to his chest and letting the same be done to him, and of loving with all of his great big heart with a passion that he’s purged for the past twenty-odd years. John tries to stop thinking about it all. He’s wholly unsuccessful, to the surprise of no one.
Questions raced around his skull, but John only voiced one. “Why are you helping me escape the men you hired to kill me?”
John tried to concentrate on his running, but the focus in his friend’s eyes was just too intriguing. “What is it?”
What was he playing at? “A… vampire?” And then John saw him flinch, slightly, and he registered the gaping space between them and Sherlock’s hesitancy all at once. “Wait a minute… are you walking on eggshells?”
“Yes,” he said in a fine voice, blinking owlishly at John. It was easy to forget that the boy was an AI, his face reserved but eyes unabashed in the emotions they could portray. He was, despite talks of intelligence and responsibility, simply a child, after all.
“Hook your right arm around it, like that. Here,” Sherlock hands him a pick. “And then… right. Just start strumming, I suppose. Not too hard or it’ll sound harsh.”
They say nothing more, but also make no move to continue on their way, and it’s awkward. John swaps their glasses and takes a sip of eggnog in a move to look more casual than he feels, but it just ends up awfully intimate. “You throw a good party,” he says after a beat.
“I’ll get you some clothes,” Sherlock finally said, eyes careful on John for any sort of reaction. He just nodded. With tight lips, Sherlock ducked into his room for a cotton tee, pyjama bottoms and a spare dressing gown. John didn’t have any clothes left behind at 221B, having used his spare set after getting caught in the sewers during one of the last cases they were together on. One month and three days ago.
Ignoring that last comment, John touched the car’s hood with the palm of his hand, somewhat in a fit of stalling. The color was so black that it felt as though he would sink into it if he leaned far forward enough. “And what is the ICAM?”
With a wince John sat up in his chair, not even bothering to tame the disarray he knew his hair was in. He sluggishly tapped in an order for coffee and the greasiest thing he could find on the digital menu at the table. “Never. But it’s all fine. Anyway, before you were saying something about… Mary?”
The guitar Sherlock’s bought is beautiful, really, even to someone who’s never had much of an interest. It’s currently propped up against the left window, mirroring the violin’s corner to the right, and the mid-morning light catches the dust in the air that drifts against its glossy veneer. The wood is a reddish color just between light and dark, and is riddled with knots as though it were carved directly from a tree trunk. John brushes his hand over the first fret’s line, not hard enough to make a sound but enough to feel the strings give.
The snow makes it look lighter outside than it is, but John closes his eyes anyway, hoping sleep envelopes him eventually. Later in the morning, they’ll talk it out, they always do, and they’ll be back to normal. Maybe something more, if Sherlock still wants it. Maybe not.
Sector 2 was dedicated to Biomedical Research. Whoever the representative was, they would (in simple terms) be able to find out if humanity could survive and retain fertility in a new, virus-free environment. As John climbed up into the ring, all he could think about was just how smart this representative must be, if he continues disobedient behavior and yet is
Hands were behind him, untucking his white button-up. He missed the protection his Belstaff brought him. “Not since uni,” he confessed over the music.
Sherlock ran a troubled hand through his hair, tugging at the curls. The man truly was the master of mood swings, but that much wasn’t new. “Your… theory has merit. Like I said earlier, I keep forgetting that you’re much more observant than others of your disability…” - John supposed that that meant his humanity - “... and I suppose I’ve been slacking off over the years.” He sounded much older than he was, like a tired god roaming the thousand-year memories that spanned across his mind. John took a chance.
It was difficult to confuse Sherlock Holmes in matters that weren’t about the inner workings of John Watson. Yet, when John glanced to his side, Sherlock’s face inches away, it was to a drawn brow and quick-blinking eyes.
One of the blond brothers pointed to the sky, where digital numbers as big as a house flashed against the glass. The sun, dim by the dome’s UV protection, was gradually lowering in its path. John always forgot about the convenient information at the clear ceiling of the sports complex, whether it be the time or weather, or even just the current game scores. 18:41, the numbers read. “Right, then, let’s call it a day,” said John. “See you guys on Thursday.”
John was spinning. Through the doorway, he could see flashes of an aggressive sort of pink, worn by the woman face-down on the floor. The corpse. Serial adulterer? Suitcase? Sherlock could be making this all up, for all John knew, but damn if he didn’t believe him regardless (if he could figure out what ‘it’ he was believing). Lestrade must believe him, too, if he kept bringing him back to antagonize the NSY and call everyone idiots. John knew first-hand Sherlock was too extraordinary to stay away from, even while being a complete and utter-
did he care that much? Memories came spilling in with such force, unwanted and full of remembered heat.
“Well, aren’t you in for a treat,” Lestrade said, though he didn’t have the same good nature as earlier. He continued to browse the crowd thoughtfully, lips pursed. “He’ll show up eventually. Unfortunately, I can’t discipline him for any sort of misbehavior, that goes straight to my First Officer. For now, just…” He waved his hand away distractedly, his smile tight. “Log yourself into one of the stations and use the simulation for practice. I’ll send him your way when he decides to grace us with his presence.”
“No, the files I’ve read are confusing. They talk in code most of the time. I’ve been reading the energy numbers, and it just didn’t make sense.”
“Please, Sherlock. I insist.” He cracked a smile, something crooked and handsome even from where John stood, half behind a corner. “Could you do a favor for me, then?”
His eyes don’t open. John can feel his voice through his chest, where his palms are still connected.
“Nope,” Sherlock said without apology, popping the ‘p’. “I’m sure a certain captain will be awaiting us for a proper scolding the moment we arrive. I’ll let you handle him.”
“Well. Yes, I have. Just the once, though. Barely even that.” Why was John backtracking? He had nothing to be ashamed for. “He’s the one that told me I was coming onto the ship, after all. Reiterating Sector A, though, but still.” John looked at him with his own eyes thoughtfully narrowed. “Is that a problem?”
John insisted, maneuvering his flat keys with his phone and cane, groceries hooked around one elbow.
Sherlock jolted, as if run through with an electrical current. His defenses dropped in horror and guilt, neck tendons jerking, and John nearly regretted saying it. But it was true. The car accident John could admit was ambiguous, even though Sherlock had antagonized him enough to make him storm out of the flat and into the street, but what happened tonight was cut-and-dry. Sherlock’s brother had tried to kill him. Sherlock slumped into his seat, all of the energy rushing right out of him and leaving him defeated. “You’re absolutely right, John. I apologize.”
I always thought you were getting calls from an overbearing ex-girlfriend, desperate to get you to visit.”
He watched him from between his fingers. “At this point, I don’t have a choice anymore. You’ve been much more observant than I had previously thought.”
Nearing the end as they collected the parts back together (including an ear that had flown halfway across the room), John expected a number of things. Another body, perhaps, or orders to follow him back down to Chem Lab 4 to help with even more experiments. Hopefully a dismissal.
“I trust you,” John said quickly, without thinking. He didn’t need thought to have his answer. “I just don’t trust the other drivers.”
He eats toast over the sink and drinks as much water as he can handle. It’s as quiet as London can be, this late, and the buzz of it calms his nerves. He isn’t sure why he’s anxious in the first place. When he’s done eating, he leans against the edge of the counter and sighs.
closest friend, and he’s not sure he’ll ever let that go. He hesitates, then sets his glass on the floor so he can lean forward on his knees.
John rolled his eyes, and then turned around to study the bay. Beneath the window where Dimmock and co. had their noses pressed against the glass, there was a control table. Beneath
“Oh, hardly. Only the parts you couldn’t reach.” Sherlock takes back his eggnog to have a drink, but instead just uses it to hide his smirk.
“I am, though not in the last few years. I spent some time in Afghanistan, an army doctor, and I originally trained at Bart’s. After getting shot in the shoulder, I was invalided. I decided to come back where I at least recognize the streets.”
It’s an unsure thing, after all of this when John draws himself back to the present, if he’ll drift to sleep or cry his eyes out.
As the sun lowered in the sky, it set its shine directly against the windshield. Though the glass was tinted heavily enough, John nevertheless lowered his billfold to keep the glare from his eyes. Sherlock practically glowed in the dim light, so pale and opaque like he was soaking up the sunshine like a moon. He offered his sunglasses, but John declined.
Mary didn’t have a car, and Sherlock took the jeep, so everyone packed into Gillian’s minivan to head down to Red Lake.
Sherlock’s lips twisted, but it was more sheepish than anything else. “It was an experiment on you, to see how far I could push you. Surprisingly far, all things considered.”
measured, and his body was never quite relaxed. It was an odd observation, but John just knew that the sight of it didn’t
He hadn’t brought his keys or his phone with him. His gun was… somewhere. He vaguely remembered storing it back into his room after he returned from Devon, so at least the illegal weapon wasn’t strewn on the couch in plain, no-warrant-needed sight. Point being, the walk was entirely spontaneous, and he almost chastised himself for being so single-minded. His bare feet were blistering against his shoes, but that was the least of his problems.
John groaned, though his voice was gravelled and he had to force it from his chest. His head throbbed tremendously. He opened his eyes to the blue of the high ceiling, the projected clouds moving sluggishly across the arc. “That hurt,” he muttered.
Molly opened and closed her mouth, schooling herself into something more professional with a lasting glance towards John. But he had slid out without a word, Baker street in mind and curses just on the tip of his tongue.
“I’ll leave you to it, then,” Mycroft said softly, and the line went dead in a fit of kindness. Sherlock lowered the phone to the desk, and shrugged on his dressing gown over his pyjamas.
“Oh,” John replied, in his infinite eloquence. The grip on his cane clenched and unclenched. “Should I…?”
It seemed as though Sherlock’s secrets went far beyond London, possibly even into the villages west of Dartmoor. The signs pointed, oddly enough, to the town John's father was buried in. But that was impossible, it had to be. "While we're there," Sherlock said quietly, "Call me William Scott."
At that, Sherlock looked up with a frown. He ran his eyes over Sarah’s frame, rapid, as if he could study the reason for her visit right out of her cardigan. When he zeroed in on the post-it, he relaxed. “Where is it?”
God, but it’s been years. Sherlock bit and slid his way into John’s mouth with vague familiarity of his movements, following John down to press him into the mattress. John, despite his not inconsiderable state of mind, was pleasantly skillful as he used his tongue, one hand threaded through Sherlock’s curls and the other kneading at his arse.
John jerked his head and looked at Sherlock. But Sherlock wasn’t looking at him. He was practically resting his head on Greg’s left shoulder now. His face turned sideways and towards Greg’s neck.
“You gave me such a fright Inspector. Beating down the door like that. You’ll give an old woman like me a heart attack.”
Now that Sherlock was in bed, he really needed some time to process everything that just happened. The new information regarding Greg and Sherlock.
He’s an annoying shit and has got a smart mouth but he’s brilliant when he’s not high and working on a case.
Greg was holding one of Sherlock’s arm around his shoulder attempting to hold up him up so they could walk him out the door. He refused to sit and be pushed in the provided wheelchair.
John felt really uneasy with this line of conversation and for some reason he was really uncomfortable with how close Sherlock was to Greg.
Well, as comfortable as he could be. The drugs were starting to wear off and he started to feel the nagging in his brain. The craving.
“Are you just going to stand there and stare at me because its kind of creepy” he says looking at sherlock with a grin.
“So sorry Mrs. Hudson. It’s Sherlock..." he said apologetically, pointing behind him with his thumb.
Greg was damned if he had to go back and ask John or Sherlock for the key. He’d just make a run for it.
“I have bolt locks on the doors and bars on the windows, in case you think of sneaking out. I’ll check on you throughout the night.”
After changing and cleaning himself up he walks back out into the living room to find Lestrade laying on the recliner with his eyes closed.
“Try and eat something. I know you don’t feel like it but you need to put something else in your body.”
John’s heart jumped and squeezed at the gesture. He’s never seen Sherlock do something so …intimate…with anyone.
The door to Lestrade’s room was open. The man was sprawled out on his back with his cover half on the floor.
The smell from the Chinese food had filled the room and it made his mouth water but his stomach turn.
John noticed Greg wince. His body tensed. As if he saw a blow coming and was bracing himself for it.
“Oh, I’m just going to sleep right here in the recliner, if that’s alright with you. Thought we could keep each other company”
“The nurse at the hospital wants to have sex with him.” He lets out a huge sigh. “He will probably have sex with her.”
