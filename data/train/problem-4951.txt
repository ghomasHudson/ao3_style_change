"Who do think I am?" Pepper smiled, her eyes traveling from his toes to head, "Look at you, you can't be like this, Tony."
"If you were here," Steve dared to speak out loud his mind, "Probably you were telling me how foolish I am for this Nomad appearance".
He even didn't see Obadiah's perfidious plan. From one day to another, he was in the streets, without money or someone to help him. Tony's thirsty gained force and his mind told him that being a bugler wasn't a bad idea, after all, he could drink all day. So far away from the hurtful thought of lost Captain America trust and his friendship when he insisted on work with the government when HYDRA already infected it with his agents and attacks. Or the memory of his bright smiles, those blue eyes opening so big when they saw it the new technology that Tony created for him. Someone who could saw through him and not only try to pretend.
Tony ran out of the workshop, singing an old melody. Steve rolled his eyes, smiling at the lovely model with two hand-knitted dolls joined with a red thread. A little Nomad and a little Ironman. Steve giggled; he knew the scene very well. When they realized who was their Soulmate. When Steve returned as Captain America and to the Avengers when Tony came back as Ironman and to his life. A new one in the new world where he woke up. He narrowed his eyes at the name in the red thread, the Stark's touch at the model.
It was like the old times fighting the bad guys between jokes and their coordination as one. Maybe Nomad felt tears in his eyes, maybe Ironman felt his helmet wet for tears. They trapped HYDRA's heads with Falcon assistance, leaving the best part for the last. Red Skull was escaping again. Ironman made a hand sign to Nomad who nodded and ran towards him, using the push of those metallic hands as a trampoline to jump in the air and fell on Red Skull with a thud. A knife appeared but a cannon blast kicked it.
"I got you. I got you. You have to come back, Tony. Rhodey almost got killed for being Ironman in Asia. Please, let me…"
Maybe he suspected it when things started to go weird in SHIELD, but he trusted Ironman's words. Not everybody could be a moron. Common sense said the golden Avenger. But Ironman disappeared when Steve needed him the most, once HYDRA destroyed his trust in the government. When Captain America asked for help from his best friend, he founded himself alone against something that was cracking his decision about the shield and the uniform. Those old ghost coming from the past whispering the words what made him felt vulnerable, lost.
"Of course, dear, you say once that your armor and you were the same. Don't let Stane make you think otherwise."
There was a little chance that his search finally came at its end. As Nomad, Steve allowed himself to smile with the slight hope of having his Soulmate so close and so far at the same time. But if he could try, maybe his reward will be the last piece that his life needed so much. His ideas stopped at once when he saw Falcon in the roofs, hurt, and tied on the ground. One day, Ironman told him that they will never leave their identities as heroes because they were born in them, raised in them and no one else could fit their tracks in the same way as them. A flower can't replace another flower even if it's exactly at the other, precisely because it is something else, whispered Ironman while he was looking at a newspaper with the picture of the Avengers fighting HYDRA.
Years passed and Steve never saw the famous Soulmate Red Thread. He believed that Peggy could do that magic, but nothing happened. He was frozen and met Sharon Carter with his disappointment appearing again. Not because she wasn't worthy. Sharon proved to be the best companion and fighter that Steve could imagine. They understood very well and she always was a cheerleader for him in doubt times.
"You're my lighthouse, Cap", Ironman tightened his shoulder, and Steve swore that he almost felt so calm and relaxed, "Without you, I'll be lost as well."
The things with the Nomad identity worked more or less well, but he wasn't satisfied at all, something was missing and Steve soon realized that it was Ironman advice and jokes with the intention of open his eyes into a new concept or made him understand a problem since another point of view. Nomad was a free agent and that was perfect for a while, now with the shadows of HYDRA, Steve needed help, companion, and support from someone smart, cocky and protected with a metallic armor. He thought many nights on came back to the Avengers and asked them for help to convince Ironman to return at their side… at his side. Meanwhile, he was a new hero of the street called Nomad, Steve saw in the news that his former friend was in Asia, fighting a strange man. That made him smile. Ironman was a hero like him, they could never leave their duties as protectors of the Earth.
"Two sides of the same coin," Tony whispered to himself bitterly, "As always. I need whiskey now… I need to forget and find Gretl, damm."
That's why he decided to drop the title and left his identity as Captain America. Steve couldn't handle his disappointment after the Secret Empire incident and the loss of his beloved friend Ironman in one single punch of life.
Steve remembered very well the day when Ironman was talking with him in a balcony in the Avenger's Mansion after a mission. Steve was disappointed with himself because he felt that he wasn't fit in the new world with new values and new technology. Then Ironman put a hand on his shoulder and told him that Captain America was the most important thing in the world because he was the mainstay of everything, especially in the modern times when everybody could get lost.
And while he was jumping, kicking, or being a hound searching for Viper's tracks, he noticed that his efforts had a lack of spark, meaning, fuel… At first, Steve thought it was his imagination. Sitting on a corner watching the people on the streets walked from one side to another whispering about how odd was Captain America nowadays -they didn't know his identity but they could sense that the man using the uniform wasn't the same when he was with the Avengers-, he felt empty on his heart. More than Sharon's absence, more than the shield or the uniform, more than the Avengers themselves. Except for one, the same who was flying over Shanghai fighting ghosts.
He shut up and walked backward when he noticed that he was talking about Ironman. What if…? He shook his head. No. No. It was only the habit of being with the golden Avenger all the time. Steve saw Redwing flying alone again and frowned. Something was wrong, Redwing never flew like that without Falcon at its side. He looked around; the young hero wasn't near. The bird disappeared from his sight, so Steve decided to follow him, and once more, he stopped on the edge of the roof with the strange feeling about Ironman. Arnie founded his Red Thread and his mate was another man. Nomad straightened up and jump down to the alley, with his heart racing.
He remembered those old times in the Army when all the soldiers learned to sew and have their uniforms always presentable. So, he put his imagination on the lead, and besides, Steve thought in what Ironman could think of his decision while he chose the dark blue fabric and the golden gloves. He got excited with the idea of making his suit, including a cape, smiling on the image of Ironman telling him the cons of using a cape while fighting the injustice and crime in Nueva York. Steve stopped for a moment when he realized that he was giving to Shellhead to much time in his mind.
"Yes, I already told him that was a bad idea. Not because he isn't prepared for the uniform, but the risks."
Clint smiled sadly at Tony. "There's only one thing you can do. You have to love them. That's it. You cannot hover over them all day everyday, so that's all you can do. You show them you love them, and you tell them as much as you can, so there's no doubt in their mind." Clint preached.
Peter nodded, “Papa” - he said pointing to Steve - “Daddy” - he patted Tony’s arm that was wrapped around his waist - “unca Brwuce” he said finally.
Before anyone could answer, they heard a small whimper. Looking down at the only one in the room that would be making a sound… Peter.
"Stevie wake up" Tony said lightly kissing his way down Steve's neck. Steve's eyes fluttered open and he smiled. "Hi honey" he murmured kissing back a little harder. "As much as I would like this to continue this we have one not so little problem" Tony quipped gesturing to the small sleeping boy between them. Steve sighed dramatically but he still smiled when he looked at his adorable son's sleeping form. "Alright I'll carry him to his room" Steve suggested while he lifted Peter into his arms like a small child. Peter stirred a little but he stayed asleep. Once Steve got to Peter's room he laid Peter down and tucked the blanket his chin. Steve bent down and placed a kiss on Peter's temple. Steve turned to leave but Peter grabbed his hand. "Petey go back to bed baby" Steve coed. "K, I love you papa" Peter mumbled into his pillow. Steve kissed his temple again then left, as he was shutting the door he peaked back in at Peter and smiled, he hadn't called Steve papa since he was little. He was still his little boy and when he slept he looked even younger than usual, Steve wanted to know what was on Peter's mind but he also didn't want to push, so he would just have to wait and hope that Peter would tell him himself.
Flash stood in his place still in shock by the confrontation. Tony slipped the bag on to his shoulder, grabbed both Ned and Peter by their upper arms and then proceed to drag the boys out of the school. Tony said a goodbye to Ned and pushed Peter into the passenger seat. He slipped into the driver's seat and they made their way back to the tower. Tony's grip on the wheel had his knuckles turning white, he refused to say a word. Peter looked nervously to his father and began his explanation, "Da-"
Later in the evening after Tony (very dramatically, in Peters opinion) retold what happened to Steve, Tony sat in his lab thinking over his emotions. Tony wanted, no NEEDED to punch that ass of a child 'Flash'. First off, who in their right mind names their child Flash, like what the hell kind of name is that. Obviously he would never tell Steve that he wanted to punch a child but he REALLY wanted to hit that kid. "You know who would help me? Clint! He's a family man, he will understand" Tony exclaimed out loud to no one in particular.
“Jar, I don’t know how long our kids gonna be like this and we have essentially nothing for him. So you better start making a list now.”
Showered and changed Peter and his fathers headed to the car. The short trip there was filled with the friendly bickering between his dads over nothing and everything, music, who drives better, what Tony or should not eat (pops is worried to much greasy food is bad for dads heart). Once they got there Peter slide in the booth across from his dads, it was almost comical how large his pops looked in this small booth. They waitress came over and took their orders, just as they were getting settled Peter felt a similar pang in the back of his head. "I um have to go to the um bathroom" Peter said to his fathers, he grabbed his backpack and scooted out of the both. "Ok Pete, but if your food comes before your back I wont promise your frys will be all there" Tony joked. When he got to the washroom Peter checked the stalls then locked the door, he stripped and pulled on his costume. Just as he pulled his mask his spider hearing picked up the bells on the diner, that's when the commotion started. "EVERYONE ON THE GROUND BEFORE WE START SHOOTING!" an unknown voice bellowed, Peter knew exactly what was going on, someone was trying to rob the diner. Why can't I just have a semi-normal day Peter thought. He unlocked the door and hopped onto the ceiling, he crawled down the hallway and peeked around the corner to get a better handle on the situation. Three gunmen, all equipped with handguns knifes tucked at their hips, Peter chuckled to himself 'rookies' he thought. He webbed two of the three guns and hopped to the floor, "Now boys didn't your parents ever teach you not to steal?" he quipped. The last gunman raised his gun seemingly not shocked anymore, He shot and Peter easily dogged the bullet, flipping over the counter Peter webbed the gun out of his hand and to the ceiling like the first two. Now they were mad knifes were in the hands of all the robbers and not surprisingly they lunged for spiderman, he jumped over them sending two of the men into each other but the smarter of the three stopped short. He punched Peter in the stomach before he could dodge sending him tumbling backwards over a table, "Now now" he said jokingly "Violence is not always the answer" cautioned Peter. This only aggravated the assailant more, this really wouldn't have been that big of a deal if Peter hadn't turned his back on the other two, his senses pinged and Peter jumped to the right the knife nicking just below his ribs. "OKAY Now that was rude" Peter yelped, kicking one in the face hard enough to knock him out, he did the same to the other two as their energy seemingly ran out.
Peter, Natasha, and Clint trained for 2 and a half hours, it was harder for Peter than he thought. He was still new at his powers and he couldn't hurt his aunt and uncle, Aunt Nat kept yelling at him to stop pulling his hits but if he didn't he wouldn't be surprised if he actually hurt them. "Okay Pete I think that's enough for today" Clint yelled from across the gym, Natasha dropped her fist inches away from Peters face. Peter dropped to the floor his back hit the mat first with a loud thump. He was caked in sweat not really used to this much hand to hand combat. Now don't get him wrong Peter had no problem protecting himself from robbers and muggers but he could relay on his webs and spider powers then and unless he wanted to out himself to his family that was not going to work. He heard footsteps come up behind him and he pushed himself up to his elbows, "That was some nice work Baby boy" his dad said. "NOT A BABY" Peter attempted "But thanks", "Your always our baby" Pops coed. "Yeah yeah whatever you say" Peter panted holding his hand up for someone to help him stand. Instead pops grabbed Peter from his armpits and hefted him over his shoulder, "NO WAY, THIS IS RIDICULOUS. LET ME DOWN!" Peter yelped trying wiggle out of Steve's grasp. Steve only laughed, "Steve leave the boy alone" Tony joked kissing peter on his head. Steve put him down "go get dressed, we can go to that diner you like a few blocks away" Steve requested, Peter glared at them then turned on his heel and headed to the change room.
Later that night when the sun had set and the food had been eaten, Clint scooped Peter into a hug before he left for his floor and said, "You're a great kid Pete. Never forget that. I love you." Then he kissed the top of his head and entered the elevator.
Natasha who stood behind the Captain made faces at the toddler in attempt to lighten the child's spirits. He didn’t even acknowledge her.
After about 3 hours of battling (they were there for more time but that was before Peter had arrived) everyone was dirty, tired, and somewhat wounded but no one was in any kind of critical condition. Peter was at least thankful for that, he was always worried about the safety of the only family he had left.
He coughed hard when he entered the thick cloud, and after a few seconds the dust had basically gone but they could still not see Peter.
Everyone gave a sound in affirmation and headed to the area that they had been told to meet at earlier. Peter being the furthest away had chosen to walk instead of swing because ‘they could wait.’ … maybe he was more annoyed than he thought.
Steve quickly lifted the child but it was in vain, Peter had already realised what he had done and began to wail in embarrassment. Tony stood up and Steve rocked the child in his arms.
I know it took slightly long for this chapter to come and I am sorry to say it will probably take till the end of this month to upload again. Exams are coming up but after that I have essentially a whole week off so you might luck out with 2 chapters :p I hope you enjoyed!!
Tony just stared at Clint for awhile like he just told him the secrets of the universe. "Tony" Clint whispered as he waved his hand in front of Tony's face.
It was a cry. Not one they had heard on the few nights Peter had a nightmare, but a baby. They adults were shocked but after seconds sprung into action and began combing the ground and surrounding area in search of the source of the sound. Tony and Steve stayed where they had last seen Peter and soon stumbled upon what looked to be Peters suit.
He could practically see uncle Clints eye role, “No spider-kid, you get that citizen out of harm's way and I’ll handle the big dude. You heard what Cap said”
Peter sat back into the couch, he was between his dad's during their weekly movie night. This week was special, all the team was joining this week. Aunt Natasha and Uncle Clint sat on the floor with their backs against the couch. Uncle Bruce sat on a grey chair to the side of the couch, Vision and Wanda sat on the old beanie bag chair. "This movie will be briefly interrupted by the following announcement" a monotone voice said. "Citizens are being held at gun point in Manhattans largest bank. We advise Citizens near the location to stay indoors until the crisis can be resolved". His dad sprang to his feet "Ok time to suit up" Tony declared. Everyone moved quickly except for Steve, "Peter will you be ok?" he asked concerned. "Pops I'm 15 I'll be ok. Just go save some people" Peter insisted. As soon as Peter thought they had left he ran to his room and pulled on his suit and jumped out his window and onto the neighboring building. Minutes later he arrived at the scene, he called out to tony " Hey da... Stark do you want a hand?". Iron man blasted one of the perps into the back wall and looked up just to see spiderman shoot a web wrapping up another man. "Spidey glad you showed up. Took you long enough" He yelled over the shooting. An hour later with the criminals loaded up into the back of the police van the avengers, minus spiderman began their trip back to the tower.
Clint looked up at him and his face softened, "Tony I just mean that it's really cute that you are acting like a dad. It's weird, you never show this side to me" Clint attempted to explain.
Steve left Peter to get ready and Peter took his leave to get dressed as well. When he came back to the living room his dads were both seated at the couch with coffee and the newspaper, Peter chuckled to himself because although they were both reading the newspaper his pops was reading a physical one and his dad had one on his tablet. They both looked up and smiled, "Hey underoos ready to go?" his dad asked setting down is coffee cup, "where are we going?" questioned Peter. "We thought it would be fun to go to the shield and do some training. You used to like that when you were younger and we haven't seen Phil in ages." Steve stated. This peeked Peter's interests, they used to teach him some easy defense moves when the first adopted him as he was the son of Tony and Steve Rogers-Stark and he was pretty small for his age. "Okay go grab some extra clothes and we'll leave when you come back." Steve said. Peter rushed back to him room excited by the prospect of working on his moves, he stuffed some basketball shorts and a t-shirt into his backpack but not before he put his suit in, just in case he told himself. He grabbed his phone from his side table and made his way back to his dads.
They brought the small child, supposedly Peter back to the tower. Normally they would help SHIELD cleanup but they had bigger (well smaller really) issues they had to deal with. Peter was a really cute whatever his age but Steve and Tony had only adopted him when he was in the later years of his childhood and all photos of him as a young child were nonexistent.
"We did, but I can explain. I didn't want you and pops to worry. You are already worried about spiderman, there's no need to worry you guys more about a silly school bully" Peter revealed.
Steve had been talking to his husband, Tony’s back facing the western sector of the city when Steve had set his sights on his son who had emerged from one of the alleyways. He was about to turn back to Tony knowing his son was safe when in the corner of his eye he saw something big move.
Tony wondered out loud. He decided he would wait 5 more minutes and then head inside to check what was taking his son so long. 5 minutes passed and Tony started to get antsy, so he made his way in quick steps up to the school. Tony was THE Tony Stark so he knew every and all information on Peters school, this information included where Peters locker and classes were. As Tony made his way to Peters locker he heard the incessant squeak of teenage voices, Tony instantly recognized Peters and then Ned's. He heard another voice but he couldn't tell who it was. Tony stopped dead in his tracks, his fists clenched at his side when he got close enough to hear the young boys conversation, "...Faggots, that's what they are. I don't know how people can look up to your faggot parents, are you gay like them? You getting lucky with your boyfriend Ned here?" the unknown boy taunted.
Peter had listened silently as his family battled tooth and nail with these aliens whose motive was still unknown. He had seen one of them make a beeline to a citizen who had their back turned as they made their way out of the city, and he was about to intervene but his father's words echoed in his head.
He heard a few soft chuckles which only fueled his annoyance. He thought they were getting over this. He wouldn’t be their ‘baby’ forever, actually correction technically he never WAS a baby around them. They adopted him when he was a little bit older and so they tended to baby him as a result of the years they missed. He understood but it was so annoying.
Peter hadn’t stopped crying the whole ride home, Tony had wrapped him up in his suit jacket that he had on under his armour, but it was neither warm nor comfortable for a young baby. They Avengers had piled into a large SUV, Tony cradling the babe and Steve driving. Every couple of minutes Steve looked over at his husband and son with concern. Tony always called Steve a mother hen but this was a new circumstance so Steve felt his concern was justified. They arrived at the tower and quickly unloaded into the elevator, Tony handed Peter off to Steve while ordering JARVIS to run a full diagnostic check on the boy. Peter just kept sobbing into Steve’s neck.
Steve shared with Ironman the same bitter about the Red String. Shellhead -as Steve named him- stopped in the search of his Soulmate after so many years of trying and later, with the Avengers adventures, he simply thought that being a hero was something more important that got a mater. Even they joked about started a club of Soulmate Losers and gave some talks on the weekends as if such a thing could happen in their lives as Avengers. Steve loved Ironman laughs, his point of view, sometimes harsh, sometimes very realistic and true. More than once, he wished to ask Ironman to remove his helmet and saw the man inside the armor. To give him for the first time a good hug and told him how grateful he was for everything.
There was a little chance that he overreacted at Captain America's words, and that made Tony think in how deep in his heart was the man. He even cared more for the old soldier than his own life -and choices by the way-, giving more weight at those words than his own beliefs. But that was because he founded out that Cap had something that Tony didn't, that optimism, will, and values to face the problems and the punches of life. The kind type that made his heart meltdown like ice cream and felt for a short time that he was a good man, a good hero.
"It's funny how easily somebody can disappear from your life even if the person left marks on your soul."
Steve frown, trying to reach the helmet but Ironman slapped his hand not with force, seemed more like if he was trying to escape but his feet didn't obey him. He was aware that they were Soulmates. Steve smiled at him, understanding what was going on.
Of course, he didn't blame anyone for his alcoholism. That demon only belonged to him. In the whiskey, his shattered dreams vanished as the ice twisting in the glass. Maybe he was a fool for had trust in his mother's idea about finding his mate and reach the forbidden happiness. Maybe Howard was right and the Soulmate was reserved for extraordinary people, the one who made better the world. Like Captain America, for instance. Tony offered to him search for his other half even if his mate already died. To give him that gift distracted the genius from important issues as HYDRA compromised SHIELD and the government in a blink. He felt that it was his fault.
The voice of the yellow Avenger made his heart skipped a beat, smiling and frowning in a blink, running inside the warehouse. His read thread tensed; his Soulmate was almost in front of his eyes. When Nomad reached the fight, all his doubts about the identity of his mate were resolved. The beautiful red thread was connected to the Arc Reactor of Ironman. And Ironman saw it too because he missed a shot to turn around and looked at him. A brief moment where they finally understand what they had been missing all this time.
"OK Flash that's enough, there's no need to bring Ned into this. Ned and I just want to leave, my dads waiting outside. So can I have my bag back now?" Peter said, as he stepped between the two boys is hands raised in surrender.
Tony went his separate way when he got to their floor. He stopped by his and Steve’s room to change clothes, and then made his way to the kitchen to see what he could feed the young child. When he realized that the only thing he could give him was some milk and plain pasta, he called out to JARVIS.
The Avengers quickly ran to Peters aid hoping for the best but they really had no clue because of the thick dust that had upturned once Peter was hit.
The shield building was smaller then he remembered but then again the last time he was here he was 10. They turned a corner and because he had his head in his phone he came face to face with a mans chest. Peter looked up quickly to apologize and smiled when he say who it was, "Uncle Phil!" he exclaimed. Phil smiled back down at him and wrapped him up in a hug kissing the top of his head in the process, "Hey Pete, how are you?" he asked. "I'm great dads are taking me to the training room and it's going to be so fun. Do you wanna come watch?" Peter said stumbling through his answer. Phil smiled and again "I can't right now, I actually have to have a discussion with your dads, but when we finish I'll come watch them with you" Agent Phil offered. Peter nodded and looked towards his dads, "Go ahead Pete we'll come meet you there" Tony said pushing Peter forward. Peter turned the corner but his curious nature took over and he paused wondering what uncle Phil needed to talk to them about. "Stark, Rogers how are you?" Phil offered the awkwardness lingering in the air, "Phil cut the crap, whats up?" Tony pushed. "Okay follow me to my office. We need to have a discussion about a certain young vigilante" Phil said his voice getting quieter as they walked further away.
When they arrived home the rest of the avengers were seated in their living room, "Ladies and gentleman the family that can never stay out of trouble, The Stark-Rogers" Clint uttered looking not at all amused. The avengers stood and welcomed the family into their own apartment, "Well it looks like were ordering supper for for more than three" Tony quipped, everyone rolled their eyes a chorus of "always the dramatic Stark" and "Oh my God" flooded through. "I'm going to go get changed" Peter lied, well really it was only a half lie he WAS going to get changed but the more pressing matter was the cut he received at the dinner. Peter had thought the cut was small but with the adrenaline gone Peter could feel the steady pulse of pain shooting through his side, when he got upstairs we grabbed a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt he stole from his pops and headed to the washroom to look at his wound. Peter stripped from his shirt and sat at the edge of the tub, the cut had not started to heal and the paper towel from the diner washroom had not really done him any good. With a first aid kit in hand Peter cleaned and bandaged up his wound, he changed quickly not wanting to miss anymore family time and headed back to the kitchen.
Peter didn’t know why but his spidey sense had not alerted him of the danger until mere seconds before it hit him. He turned in time to see the beam heading straight toward his chest.
Tony looked over at his son, "Peter you are the strongest person I know, and you ARE Spider-man. I love you but you cannot handle everything one your own, that includes a school bully because guess what? Your a kid and sometimes kids need help" Tony insisted.
“Okay, we can deal with that, but what’s our game plan? He can’t stay like this forever” Steve questioned.
That sounded heavenly to Peter. He was a little disappointed that his fathers had him on such a tight leash but he was glad that they had at least let him join.
Tony looked at Clint like he had gone insane. "Well of course I'm acting like a dad. I AM A DAD" Tony claimed.
"Well that's good. Now we best be going shouldn't we Petey" Tony responded, at the same time he held out his hand and as excepted Flashed placed the strap of Peters backpack in it.
“Ummmmm FYI Hawkeye theres an aliene headed to a citizen on your 6 about to attack a innocent. I'll handle the citizen and you can take the alien. - he took a breath as if he was finished but then he thought of something - UNLESS of course you are extremely busy and want spiderman to handle it!” Peter suggested
“Okay Brucie bear I need you to come check Pete out in medical. Everyone else can head to debrief” ordered Tony
"Peter what the actual HELL" Tony threatened. Everyone stood around Peter and just stared, mouths open, arms limp at their sides, "TONY" Steve scolded with not really any meaning. "No Steve, no. Our little boy suddenly got FUCKING spider powers, decided he wanted to be a vigilante, and ran around the city in spandex, SPANDEX STEVE. And for however long this has been going on he hasn't told us" Tony ranted. A tear slide down Peters cheek, he swiped at it with the back of his hand, he was not going to cry he told himself, this was his fault he made his bed so now he has to lay in it. Peter had to bit his lip to keep in the wall of tears building in his eyes when he looked at his pops and saw his glazed over expression. Uncle Bruce saw it to, "Peter? Lets go to the med wing and I'll stitch you up" Bruce coerced, he grabbed Peters hand and gently tugged, "But..." Peter whispered. Natasha bent forward and whispered into Peters ear "I think your pops needs a little time". She grabbed Peters other hand and he followed Bruce, Natasha, Vision, and Wanda to the elevator, Peter looked to his uncle Clint only to see him jump into the vents above. The doors closed and Peter saw his dad grab his pops waist and pull him into a hug.
After asking a few more questions about whether Peter remembered what happened (he didn’t), if he knew where he was (he did), and other questions that could give them a better idea of the situation.
"Shut up Flash. Peters parents are the best people ever, and there's nothing wrong with being gay" Ned defended.
The corners of Tony's mouth down turned into a frown and he turned to face Flash who had pulled away. "Now I know you were NOT going to punch my precious son" Tony questioned.
At 11:00 Peter entered the lobby of Stark towers, now back in his normal clothes and his suit hidden at the bottom of his backpack he headed into the elevator. "Good evening Master Peter. What floor?" Jarvis asked "Too the main floor please" he requested. Patrol had been pretty uneventful, a few thieves, a couple robbers and one break an enter but during the B&E the criminal managed to get a few good punches on Peters face. Just before the doors open Peter pulled his hood tighter and he tugged his baseball hat down.
The fathers nodded and made their way to their floor hushing the child all the way. When they got their Steve brought peter to his bedroom. He grabbed one of Peters pairs on boxers and a sweater, then entered his ensuite to wash him up.
Peter woke late Saturday morning around 10 to the smell of something burning. Not at all alarmed because when you live with a bunch of overgrow children you get used to this stuff, so he took his time to dress and head to the kitchen.
Peter took to action quickly, he stuck (no pun intended) to his job pretty well. There was surprisingly, or not, quite a few citizens still in direct danger. Peter didn’t understand it but instead of running away people seemed to be videotaping the events. He thought it was idiotic but who knew. He was a 16 year old kid running around in what was basically advanced pajamas fighting aliens.
He webbed them to the wall and told the cashier to call the police, He swung out the door and onto the neighboring building ducking through the backdoor Peter quickly and quietly made his way back to the washroom. As quick as he possibly could he changed and made his way back to his dads, he slammed into his pops large chest and gasped, "Peter oh thank goodness your okay. Three idiots just tried to rob the diner and your stubborn father wanted to call for his suit" Steve said grabbing Peters face checking for any injury's. "I'm ok I was in the washroom the whole time" Peter complained, he looked around pretending to scoop out the scene, "WOW! it looks like spiderman was here" he questioned hoping not to sound too cocky. "Yeah the idiot almost got himself stabbed because of his stupid little quips" Tony said seemingly popping out from nowhere. "Oh don't be mean Tony, he reminds me of you a little" Steve commented lips pulled into a smile, Tony shoved Steve a little and pulled Peter into a half hug. "Now that our evening was ruined why don't we go home and just order in" Tony suggested way to dramatically, Peter and Steve rolled their eyes and laughed. On their way out Steve pulled Peter into a quick hugged, he tensed first because Steve's hip hit Peter's chest right on his new cut, his pops bent down and whispered into his ear "I'm really glad your ok pet", Peter smiled but it didn't reach his eyes.
“Peter seems in perfect health!” - Bruce informed the concerned parents - “however I think we should address the slightly bigger issue”
Peter woke at a normal time Sunday morning his wounds full healed. He turned toward his clock and checked the time, half past 6, so pops should be coming home from his run soon. Peter made his way to the washroom, he locked the door and turned on the tap splashing cold water on his face in hopes of that waking him up. He did his "business" and went to the kitchen to make himself some breakfast, he pulled up a stool and ate his cereal in silence. Before he even turned around Peter could hear the elevator doors open. "Hey Petey what are you doing up this early? It's Sunday" Steve joked. "I wake up this early on most weekdays pop" Peter replied. " Well I'm going to get dressed and wake your dad up then maybe we can all go out today" he suggested. "Sure pops just tell me where were going k" said Peter.
Peter wanted to hear what they were saying about his alter ego but if he didn't show up at the gym soon someone would surely raise the alarm. So Peter made his way to the gym, he pushed the heavy doors open and his senses were bombarded by the smell of sweat and blood. The smell was a bit of a shock however it's one hes become accustomed to, he felt a tingling feeling at the base of his skull so he stepped to the left and avoided a nerf arrow to the head. "Uncle Clint what the heck man" Peter joked. He turned around and was meet by his uncle Clint's shell shocked face, his mouth opened and closed multiple like he wanted to say something "How, how did you dodge my arrow? I NEVER miss... EVER" he gasped. OMG Peter thought, he couldn't just let it him, how could he be so stupid. Peter ducked his head and then looked at his uncle again who had seemed to still be trying to pull himself together. "I um heard it?" Peter said unsure if Clint would fall for it. A smile spread across Clint's face, "Of course you did!" Clint said looking much more relaxed. He grabbed Peter's shoulder and pulled him into a hug, Peter was still small enough that his eyes only came up to his uncle's chin, his stubble brushing against peters forehead when he kissed the top of his nephews head. "OK not a baby here, no need for all the hugs and kisses" Peter grumbled, this only pushed Clint to kiss and hug Peter more. Not wanting to offended his uncle to much Peter gave in and snaked his arms around his uncles chest.
Tony walked over to Clint and clapped him on his shoulder. "Thanks man. That meant a lot to me." Tony thanked him.
Peter nodded but before he could attempt a verbal response, his bladder gave out. The men really should have known that a child that young still needed diapers but it hadn’t really been their top priority and none of them had dealt directly with young children. A wet spot spread across the fabris Peter was wrapped in, and Tony’s thighs.
Peters cries slowed but did not halt completely, he sniffled and nuzzled his small head into the crook of Steves neck. Both Tony and Steve’s hearts broke, this poor baby, their son, was in pain and they didn’t know why. They didn’t even know if it was cries of pain or just from the fact that he was a quarter the size he was that morning. They arrived at medical and Bruce asked Steve to set the boy down on the table. Hearing this the boys tears start up again, “Peter, Pete, uncle Bruce can’t help you if he can’t look at you” Steve whispered in peters ear. He laid his hand on Peters back, only to realize just how small the boy was. Steves hand covered almost all of the boys back. It was slightly disconcerting and Steve made a promise to himself right then that he would get his son back to normal as soon as possible.
The small group followed his lead and JARVIS dropped each one off on their own  floor, leaving Bruce, Steve, Tony, and Peter to make their way up to medical on their own.
"Peter! Are you okay?" Clint asked getting off Peter quickly, "yeah I'm good I was just surprised" Peter said. "No that was not a surprised gasp that, was a pain gasp. We all know the difference very well" Steve warned, Peter stood trying to get away but to no avail, "IS THAT BLOOD" Natasha demanded. Peter grasped his side and looked, the blood was just starting to seep through "UMMMMMM no" Peter tried, "Yes that is" Bruce said his eyes looking a little green. They all stood around Peter and he bounced on his heals looking at the floor not wanting to make eye contact with anyone, "Peter shirt off now and explain" his pops demanded using his captain voice. Peter knew he couldn't disagree that voice meant business, there's no coming back from this he thought, so Peter pulled off his shirt and tried to rake through his brain to find an plausible excuse. "I was skateboarding the other day and fell, I must have landed on something sharp cause i started bleeding. I didn't tell you guys because it was stupid and I cleaned it myself" Peter explained, "This looks like its from today Peter not 'the other day'. What ACTUALLY happened?" Bruce pushed. Peter looked around the room his eyes eventually landing on his aunt Natasha's, she looked back at him for a moment then something sparked, "Peter" she bit out "Are you spiderman?" she questioned. His head was throbbing panic bubbling into his chest, "PETER ANSWER HER!" Tony warned his voice reaching an almost yell, "yes" Peter whispered closing his eyes wishing this was all just a dream. "WHAT!" everyone yelled, Peter covered his ears this much yelling was not ok for his senses.
On closer inspection they discovered that the cry had come from the lump located under the crumpled, smoking suit. Surprised Tony stepped forward and pulled the costume away.
So Tony grabbed his Starkphone from the workbench and dialed up Clint. "Hey Hawkass" Tony joked into the phone.
Clint looked at him for a few seconds anger flashed in his eyes, then his lips curled into a smile and he broke out in laughter. "Oh My God Tony, you are such a father." Clint gasped out in between his laughter.
"Peter your dads love you more then anything, the day they brought you home I have never seen them look so happy" Bruce assured. "Peter your Uncle Bruce is right. We love you we would never 'give' you back" Tony interrupted, Peters head whipped up from where he stood, "I'm sorry daddy, I'm sorry papa I didn't mean to hurt you guys, please don't give me back" Peter begged tears streaming down his face, Natasha, Vision, Bruce, and Wanda stepped into the elevator leaving the small family to their moment. Steve picked Peter up and Peter wrapped his arms around his neck and his legs around waist, "I'm sorry papa, I'm sorry" Peter cried. "Peter please look at" Tony begged, he gripped Peter's chin so that he could look him in his eyes "I love you, WE love you. We would never ever give you away. We were just worried about you, our little boy running around the city getting himself hurt" Steve reassured. "Re-re-really" Peter mumbled, "Yes my little boy" Tony coed. "I'm not a little boy" Peter argued, "Would you like to say that to the rest of you" Tony joked, Peter tucked his head between his pops chin and shoulder. "Now lets go back upstairs and you can explain however this happened to us okay" Steve said, Peter just nodded snuggling into his father more, "OH and Peter" Tony added, "Yeah dad?" Peter answered, "Your grounded... Forever".
As 6 o'clock rolled around Peter felt the vibration of his Stark phone in his hidden pocket. He sat down on the edge of a random building and answered the call, "Hello" he said pulling his mask just above his mouth. "PETER, where are you? You were suppose to be home at 5:30" his dad scolded through the phone. "Dad I told Pop that i'll be home later. I'm still at Ned's house" he lied. "Well next time make sure you tell HIM to tell ME" Tony answered. Peter heard shuffling from the other said of the phone, and he heard his pops voice, "Tony it's not my fault he likes me better" Steve joked. "Okay bye dad's i'll see you in a bit" Peter said quickly into his phone.
Ironman was back to business, leaving the read thread flying with him for later. Tony's heart was beating hard as his cannons roaring in the air before shooting.
"And you taught me my value as a man, my friend," Steve put his hand on the gauntlet, wishing he could remove the metal and touch the real hand.
The next thing Tony saw was the famous Nomad breaking in the warehouse with Falcon. He didn't bother the help, but the read thread connecting with the heart of Nomad in that strong -familiar- chest. Nomad noticed too and for a few seconds that last an eternity, both looked each other with the read thread tensed in the wait for a mutual touch.
"I think you could guess who I am, after all, we just fought together. You knew my moves as I knew yours. But if you can't imagine it, let me tell you. I am Captain America."
The first time Tony saw his red thread was in the train station just when he was watching the railways as if these long steel lines could tell him where Gretl was. The funny thing was that he wasn't thinking in that woman but Captain America. How much he missed him too now that his street friend was gone. At the instant, a red thread appeared in front of his eyes, sprouting from his heart and continued far away from the railways to nowhere. A beautiful bright red thread that Tony reached out to touch, ignoring the crown around, at the eyes of the people he was touching the air. He was touching an impossible dream coming true and letting him know that, indeed, he possessed a red thread, a Soulmate.
When the whiskey was run out from his body, Tony thought in Captain America, how would be if he trusted instead on him when Cap's intuition was telling him that they were inside a web, HYDRA's web. The man always trusted in Ironman's decision even when it involved risks or the critics of other Avengers. Tony thought that he could do the same for once. Show him that their friendship was bulletproof. He could be with the super-soldier right now, chatting and drinking some coffee in the Avenger's mansion.
He counted the seconds that Ironman took to remove his helmet with trembling hands. Steve wanted to say something to encourage him but he remained quiet to respect the fact that Ironman was about to reveal his identity. Instead, he offered a warm smile, playing nervously with the mask in his hands. Steve's eyes open big when he discovered who was the yellow Avenger.
The next thing he knew was Steve's arms holding him tight, with a low laugh that sound more like a sob. Now his red thread was shining because they were together.
Falcon raised from the ground a newspaper picture of Ironman, stained with blood, marked with a huge X as a promise of being the next target. Red Skull thought that he murdered the real Captain America and now was after Ironman…
With a last look at the two knitted dolls, Steven nodded, taking Tony's hand and leaving the workshop.
He went out, searching for the opportunity that appeared and let him prove his movements against the bad men, saving the day. He felt good, free, and strong. Until that instant, Steve didn't know how much he liked being a hero despise of the troubles and the deception in the past days. The press talked about him as the new hero of the streets and with a little help, he will be a new Avenger if he could find Ironman hideout. He wished to hear what could say about that new look. The jokes and maybe, just maybe convinced him of return to the team.
Falcon called SHIELD, they took the prisoners and left the two heroes alone in the warehouse. The red thread was still there, waiting for the final touch between them. Steve couldn't believe it and, at the same time, it made sense. Ironman always supported him, shared time with him. Believe in him in a way that Steve never felt. But now, he needed to see who was behind the mask. Heard the real voice of the man who taught him how to live in the new world and gave him a hope to live.
The wind blew the red thread, like hair floating in the water. Steve forgot his current situation, only thinking about the shocking fact that he was watching his red thread, the one which connected to his Soulmate. If the red thread was there, that meant only a thing: his mate, his Soulmate was near. He sat to breathe and calm himself, with a hand on his chest, feeling his beating heart. He had a Soulmate. Steve smiled, raising his head to the bright sky with joy. That moment was broken when Redwing appeared and shrieked, flying in circles waiting for Nomad to follow it. Steve jumped from his seat, touching the red thread -a ghostly sensation- before ran behind the falcon.
Peter didn’t answer verbally but held up three fingers in response. All of the adults gasped slightly by this, they knew that he was young, and logically they also knew that he was around that age but having it said conclusively was a shock.
“Okay everyone, nice work! The perimeter is being secured just incase but we believe that the threat has been neutralized. Shield will be here soon for clean up. I say we head home and order some take out!” Tony said.
"NOPE we are not doing this, your pop's and I had this discussion with you. 'No Secrets' that's what we said right?" Tony demanded his voice rising just a little.
Hoping no one was in the kitchen Peter quietly made his way to his bedroom down the hall. "Peter!" challenged Tony. "Get back here, NOW". Peter turned on his heal and made his way back to the kitchen. "Hey dad. Whats up?" mumbled peter. "Steve look who's here" Tony yelled to Steve who Peter assumed was in one of the rooms down the hall. Peter sat on a bar stool waiting for Steve. "Peter take your hood off please and the hat" Tony added. "Pete why were you so late. We were worried" said Steve hugging Peter from behind, then moving to stand beside Tony. Tony finally got a good look at Peters face " Pete what happened to your face!" he exclaimed. Tony gripped Peters chin and moved his head from side to side. "It's nothing dad's. It's not a big deal. I just fell off my skateboard" Peter said attempting to explain. "I knew you were going to get hurt on that thing" Steve complained. Peter hopped of the bar stool and tried to make a dash for his room while is dads were preoccupied discussing the dangers of skateboarding. "You don't actually think you can get away that easy?" his pops questioned. " No captain, of course not" he retorted, saluting is father. "Don't use that tone with your pops" Tony demanded. "Peter we're just worried about you. You've been coming home late, covered in bruises and cuts. Whats been going on with you?" Steve coed. "I promise I'm great, really dads. I have been a little clumsy on my board, and I've been hanging out with Ned, we're building a new death star" Peter said. "You know you can tell us anything, right peter?" asked Tony. "I do, I really do dad. I'm just tired right know so, I'm going to go to bed. I love you both" Peter explained. "Love you too" they said in unison.
‘Hey Pete, I hate to ask you this but we are really struggling downtown Brooklyn. Have Happy drive you down, we really need an extra hand and Thor is off world still. Love you - Dad’
“Da-da-daddy!” the child had cried and then proceeded to lift his arms up, hands making a grabby motion towards Tony.
He had a pinch expression on his face, which was slightly red. His small eyebrows were squished together, and his lips pursed.
After concluding this questioning Bruce came to a conclusion, “So here’s what we know. Peter’s 3, he appears to be healthy, slightly small for the average size of a child that age. He knows the most basic information about his life but is lacking in knowledge of recent events and slightly less important information on things such as, his actual age, school, and specific things like birthdays, holidays, ‘identity’s’.”
Underneath the red and blue suit was a small child, maybe 2 or 3 with beautiful brown eyes that were wet and red rimmed, and a mop of curly brown hair. Steve gasped in shock when the child called out once more before bursting into another bout of tears.
Peter sat at the back of his eighth period class and stared at the clock wishing for the time to go by faster. "Ok students the bell will be ringing soon. Remember to get your test signed and show me Monday morning" Mr Davis said. The bell rang and Peter sprinted for the door, dodging students in the hallway as he made it out the front doors.
Tony sat outside of Midtown high school in a sleek black Mercedes, the windows were tinted but everyone knew who was in there, the licence plate said IRONMANZ. It was 20 minutes after the bell and Peter had yet to leave the building. "Where is he? He always gets out suspiciously early."
Peter Was ecstatic at the beginning of the day, he had had a good nights rest and his pops made him his favourite breakfast. At school Flash was oddly silent and he had only gotten one ‘Penis Parker.’ Peter guessed this may have been a result of his pops appearance at the field trip.
That man smiled at him. "It's okay, I'm afraid too, but… look at the red thread. There isn't a mistake here."
Silence came again, but this time, Tony moved forward and kissed Steve, leaving him blinking and smiling.
Tony took a deep breath, thinking about how fast he could fly from that situation before removed his helmet with trembling hands. Steve offered a warm smile, playing nervously with his mask in his hands. Tony was looking at the ground, shaking a little. He raised his head to let Steve saw his face, a stunned one.
Only silence was between them because Tony couldn't speak. He was ready to accept that a stranger was his Soulmate when such stranger was the same man who invaded his dreams, hopes, and days. Steve spoke again, worried.
"You're not Captain America", She said once when Nomad stopped her in the bank, "You can't defeat me, my only match was Captain America but without his partner, he's nothing as well."
After good bath, shaving, and new clothes with some food in his stomach, Tony recovered his armor once Rhodey gave him after a hard talk about leaving his duty as an Avenger. Feel the metal against his skin and fly over the city brought to Tony the good memories before answered an emergency call. It came from the Avengers; the police just detected an attempt in a building where a masked man held hostages threatening the police with a bomb. A work for Ironman. Tony knew that he couldn't let it pass, Gretl's search had to wait as his red thread.
"I can't live without fighting the injustice or just let pass the bad things", Steve told to Falcon, "I'm sure that Ironman neither. And he taught me how the world could be without someone protecting it."
In the television, he heard about the missing of Tony Stark, CEO of Stark Industries, apparently after problems with some demands and frauds. No one was sure, but now the former millionaire and genius were lost and the company was in Obadiah Stane's hands. Steve frowned, he didn't know what to feel about that because Tony Stark was something, he always reserved his opinion of him at Ironman's presence. He guessed that now Shellhead disappeared, that millionaire lost his way and stuck in troubles. He shrugged and continued with his work.
Steve felt dry his throat, with tears in his eyes at the sight of the innocent boy who wanted to maintain alive the dream of what represented for him, Captain America. The fault? In Falcon's version was Red Skull who returned from the dead to claim vengeance against Steve. In Rogers' version, it was completely his fault. He never should leave the uniform. He knelt, bowing his head to the body of the young officer trying to offer a sincere apology. Too much enthusiasm and little reason. Nomad was a good intention but Captain America was a weight that Steve only could bear. He took the shield, looking at his reflection on the surface.
Tony blame himself for the Secret Empire incident, if he wasn't so busy trying to drink some of that damm whiskey, he could avoid a few things like having SHIELD compromised or lost Captain America trust in the government and on him. And now, he was looking desperately for another drink since Obadiah left him in the streets, no one would help him because he was Tony Stark. The man who didn't care for the others and live as he wanted without regrets.
When he reached the corner of a roof in the building next to where the hostages were, he saw his read thread once more. Tony opened big his eyes.
Mission accomplished. SHIELD came to collect the prisoners, giving thanks to both men. Falcon smiled and walk out of the warehouse saying something about Redwing hungry. Just a pretext to leave them alone. Now it was time to face his Soulmate.
His overthinking mind was already jumping into conclusions, Tony imagined his Soulmate as one of those villains and forever doomed because he couldn't harm his mate even if was his enemy. With such bad thoughts, he prepared his armor, ready to fly and surprise the band. Ironman didn't hesitate, breaking a wall and pushing the first green uniforms he saw. He kicked heads while he descended with elegance to face the leader of those snakes.
Everybody knows the story, but at some point, they heard about it for the first time in their lives. To Steve Rogers, he was in a dinner with her mother, months after his father Joseph passed away. They were in silence, eating slowly the few carrots and beans that meant to be the main dish. Sarah raised her head and smiled at him, one hand caressing his short blond hair.
Peter HATED that nickname, he was not a child! He was practically an adult. “Not a kid” the young boy muttered under his breath.
Peter Rogers-Stark headed towards the back ally of a pizzeria a few blocks away, he dumped his back pack and civilian clothes in an empty dumpster. Dressed in his spiderman suit Peter climbed up the side of the building to begin his patrol.
Flash scoffed in his face then stepped forward into Peter's space. He grabbed Peter by the front of his shirt and pushed him into the lockers, he raised his fist to punch Peter. Tony was not going to let that happen, no one was going to hurt his baby. So Tony quickly made his way toward the boys, Ned saw him and smiled. He stood a foot taller than the boy and grabbed him by the elbow to stop the punch. Flash's head whipped around, his eyes quickly widened as he realized who was holding him back. Flash was not the only one surprised. Peters jaw dropped but he quickly closed it and stuttered out a few words, "D-d-d-dad!"
