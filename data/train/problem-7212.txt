Right after that, Steve’s expression fell. There wasn’t another word to describe it, he just downright broke. Tony didn’t think he’s ever seen so many expressions, so much hurt out in the open, not on Steve’s face at least.
He must have fallen asleep over the plans for the new arrows, because the next thing he knows is that he was being shaken awake by familiar hands on his shoulders.
Steve.
Was it possible, considering that he couldn’t love anyway? He’d be disappointed for sure, but it wasn’t as if he would feel any different then he did now, would he?
It probably should be.
He didn’t go out; he didn’t pick anybody up. He had no explanation as to why. He had a theory but he didn’t want to think about that so he went with ‘no explanation’. The warmth be damned.
He turned around looking at Tony, smiling brightly. ”Hey, you okay?” He asked, concerned.
soon, that is. Steve was changing him and he didn’t want to go as far as to say that he’ll actually be normal soon, but
Tony nodded mockingly and put on his smile he usually saved for the press.
Tony looked him up and down and then nodded slightly. “Yeah.”
Tony just put his hands back on both of Steve’s cheeks and kept the eye contact, the first real smile in months playing around his lips.
He tried to listen to his surroundings; he was probably the little medic room right next to the labs, which was usually used for post—missions check ups. As far as he could tell, there was no other person here: no breathing next to him or any other indicator that he had company. He tried to open his eyes, which was harder than he thought it would be. He felt as if his eyelids were glued shut.
I also posted the first chapter of another fic, it's post: Infinity War, check it out and let me know what you think :)
Tony, I can help. Or I can
. He had literally been pressed on pause and came back to not knowing what had been going on, nothing but one little video clip and team that was just acting one
. He had never wasted a second thought about his bed room, he had given some architect a shit ton of money to make her take care of that and then never even looked at anything in the room twice.
Tony aimed for anger, because if there was something he could do, it was piss people off. He just wanted to see Rogers be something other than sad. That there were other approaches to achieve that, was something that didn’t occur to him. Or maybe it did but he really didn’t want to listen to it, because fuck Rogers, that’s why.
Let me know what you think!
Who’d known he’d miss that, once he was able to do so.
“I don’t know.”
”This is not what’s inappropriate about all this,” he answered and walked out without another glance in Tony’s direction.
Peter reached him, pulling on his pant leg, there was nearly no strength behind it, but Tony really thought for a second that it could throw him over. He caught himself before it could happen, though, trying to think of ways to treat a child. What was he supposed to say? What was he supposed to do?
He really wished this thought wouldn’t have the impact it did on him. He didn’t want to have anything to prove but right now, he was sure he had to.
Tony wished Steve would stop looking more sad than he felt. He hated that he knew that it was his fault that he was wearing that expression.
. But he had been an ass, to himself and everybody around him because how couldn’t he be.
He dropped his hand and shook Steve softly, who just pulled his eyebrows down and murmured unhappily in his sleep.
So he tried to smile, but not too often. Eat with the team, but not more often then before. He tried to look as if he didn’t constantly gag while eating his one potato. He tried to act like his head wasn’t shouting at him that he’s
to know that.
And it really shouldn’t have surprised him so much, he knew it deep down already, somewhere in his subconscious but it really did. He should have been more careful, shouldn’t just have ignored the obvious signs. His body couldn’t take or heal injuries as fast as it used to.
Steve probably doesn’t know what he’d bargained for, though.
Tall Blonde seemed to get that he was serious. He also seemed to hate to realize that Tony wasn’t joking just now. He just paled even further and then sucked in a deep breath of air, seemingly trying to gather all of his calmness, trying his best not to freak out, right here with Tony.
Steve only shook his head and continued. ”His name is Peter Stark Rogers. Born May 3rd 2014.”
to die. So attend our group dinners again and let us help you out of this.”
could he hide something like that? —
He looked at the construction in front of him and felt —
“It’s okay to just watch out for yourself right now. But I appreciate that you don’t and look out for little Pete, too. He had been missing his Daddy really badly.”
”No, seriously, I get it, you got this whole tall and blonde with baby blues going on, I get why I’d hit that.” Rogers took in a sharp breath and looked up from a little shirt with dinosaurs printed on it. Tony counted it as win.
Tony nodded a few times, not really knowing what to do now. What was protocol now? What was he supposed to do?
“It’s not, Tony. We both know it.” Sad thing was, that Steve sounded just as convinced as Tony. Like he had not a single doubt that Tony had kept him around because he was
The man then turned around, walking down the hallway. ”Petey, come on, we’ll have a fun day! We can go to the animal shelter and pet the doggies.”
Tony shook his head and stopped in the doorway for a second.
”It’s fine, Cap.”
It was as if his amusement just fell from his face.
He felt quite
people. His father had moved earth and every damn planet to make sure that nobody would know how his son was
”I can tell you how to?”
Steve had told him so often that he could just ask when he had questions. Had always assured him that he was not alone, never will be again. Tony had seen it as threat when he had first heard it, because
He wanted to never let go and promise the kid the world.
(It never rains in Southern California is still a BANGER btw and is curing my depression hi hello)
”Okay will do,” Tony answered for no other reason than that he was confused and maybe exactly as much of an asshole as Steve presumed.
sugar wouldn’t help with his problems. He didn’t put it into his coffee for this reason either, but he still lay the two cubes back into their container. He began to work on some new arrows for Clint without thinking about the forgotten cubes again.
Steve looked concerned again, as if he didn’t really know what reaction would be justified so he just settled for looking uneasy.
He couldn’t. And he didn’t. He did, however, spend the next weeks lying around drunk before noon, babbling to Jarvis and trying not to think about anything. It was harder than he’d thought, though. But he got it, most of the time. Mostly in the nights he couldn’t remember in the morning.
After 4 more months, bless Steve’s patient soul, Tony was convinced that he could. Grow seeds, that is, or more like grow emotions just like that. Or one, to be exact. Well, he had collected his fair share of emotions, none feeling quite as good as the tiny bit of happiness he had received so many months ago.
Sure enough, the first thing he saw when he walked into the kitchen was Clint on the counter, coffee pot in one hand and petting Lucky, who had his front paws next to Clint, with the other. Steve stood in front of the stove and scrambled eggs, smiling as if it was just downright the best leisure activity to make breakfast for others.
After he figured out how the hell to be a father.
Tall Blonde’s smile dimmed like a damn energy saving bulb and Tony really couldn’t figure out
“I’d love to.”
was the whole problem. And he was so tired of people defending Steve as if they had been there.
When Howard yelled at him again, pushed him around like he was just a little inconvenience in his perfect life; when reporter followed him everywhere he went, taking pictures of him doing what every teen does and than obsessively trying to use it against his perfect-son image; when he got pushed around by the people in his school, who were way older than him and so much stronger; he had food. It was his.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, Nat,” Tony eventually answered to which she only raised an eyebrow.
”Rainbow!” Peter exclaimed and Tony drank his whole cup of coffee in one go. He couldn’t do that. Children were just so — children.
He ignored that this thought felt wrong. He couldn’t say how but it felt weirdly bad to think about that.
“Steven, stop feeding Pizza Dog,” Clint huffed out through a mouth full of coffee, ”He’s spoiled enough as it is.”
it, Rhodes. You all might not believe me, but I swear I did.”
- Nick
”Thank you for —” Steve cleared his throat, clearly not knowing if he should finish his sentence. Then apparently deciding to do it, not much of a surprise to Tony. Steve always said about everything he thought. He wasn’t afraid to say the hard things. There was a bravery behind it that Tony envied, not that he’d ever admit that to anyone. ”Staying sober. It couldn’t have been easy, but I am glad that you did it.”
”Papa!” The boy exclaimed and began to pounce again to which Tony startled out a cough again, before raising his head quickly, relief
But not right now. Because Tony felt raw and defenseless and they all just gaped at him, as if he’d performed open heart surgery naked. But his home was ripped out of his hands, and it all lead to this in an awfully twisted way and Tony just couldn’t do that right now, because everything inside him yelled at him to just
”Not a word, jerk,” Steve hissed when Bucky was also about to laugh at it, after he had send Peter to his room, to unpack his backpack again.
He showed him half an apple and pointed to the seeds. “You see these? Those are the things people feel. Deep inside of them, but they can be made visible, right? And you, little one.”
Then again this had never been about Clint really, he was just on Steve’s side, and then Clint was angry because he was in prison and that was that about that. But now that that was all over he and Clint could share their normal laughter again, which was quite refreshing really.
And he was really trying his best.
”In my defense, I’m actually only half way kidding,” Steve said teasingly. Tony could not express how surprised he was. ”Last time you had questions, you asked me to show you my magic dick.”
”I know okay, I do,” Rogers rushed to say, as if he didn’t want to take the chance that Tony would verbally agree too. Tony wondered if that would have made Rogers cry then. Maybe. He looked about ready to.
The whole world was a sad place and he was trapped in the middle of it.
He felt like he should cry. He felt like he would soon anyhow because this memory was so little, but it was so precious, so important, that Tony didn’t really know how to contain all of his emotions right now.
It might also have been the first time in his life that he felt unconditional love for somebody.
“But I am in pain. My whole body is in pain, I am telling you, something is — something is wrong.”
He was far too gone to even say something right away, because he knew whatever he’d say, it would change his whole life. So he stood there and stared right into the headlights without moving a limb.
Tony looked up from his books and turned his head to face Rhodey, who was lying on the couch, legs hanging lazily over the edge.
“I don’t mean to hurt you, Tony, but think this through, okay? You don’t know if it is love that you feel or just joy.” Well, Steve certainly sounded like he was sure that it
He didn’t want to think about why it filled him with warmth instead of dread.
Peter didn’t say anything for a long while, but then he just nodded softly. ”But when he feels better, he will read in the dinosaur voices again, yes?”
Tony sputtered, stopped moving for a second, looking closely at Steve, trying to see if he was kidding. His expression was serious without any hint of amusement. Yeah, sounded about right.
He didn’t stop. Or did he?
”Daddy!” He yelled out, before getting up on his wobbly
”I know you didn’t ask for the accident, Tony,” Rogers said remorseful, as if he had just done something wrong. ”I’m sorry.”
Tony nearly rolled his eyes in the back of his head, when he heard the righteous voice,
And he didn’t know if any one of them could ever look past that and forget about it.
He might never earn Steve’s trust back.
Tony liked that look on him, too.
There seemed no end to his tears. He had never felt this helpless in his life. And people felt this
He turned around, looking at Steve, who had raised his eyebrows questionably.
Steve obviously decided to let go the second lie today too.
”Of course. Is everything okay? Did something happen?”
They sat some more in weird silence, neither really knowing what to say or do. Rogers sure looked convinced, though, to figure this whole thing out on his own. He just sat there as if he was reassessing what he needed to do now.
”Sorry that I wasn’t around today but the doctor said that you should have time to get to know your new home by yourself,” Steve held on to his belt buckle with both of his hands. It looked obscene, as if he was trying to lead Tony’s attention to his crotch, but without realizing it.
off his chest and Tony could finally take the deep breath he had needed so desperately.
Weird, Tony had taken him as someone who was always ready to fight.
Steve chuckled low, getting up to put their plates into the dishwasher, before closing it with a hit with his hip. ”Yeah, maybe a little bit. But he’s got your brains, Tony. He’s really smart.”
. Rhodey looked at him with a sad expression.
. He was in control over his body and his mind, so it won't be no problem. He ate so little, because he
Rogers’s eyes snapped to him and then he held eye contact, not planning on ever breaking it.
“You look and smell like shit.”
“I don’t know,” he tried again, staring back at the wall, counting how many pictures of the woman in front of him, together with smiling children, hung there.
It worked either way. But Tony got bored fast, Rogers’s pants weren’t exactly tight so all Tony could do was guess at best.
if he hadn’t been doomed from the start.
“Ain’t that just true.”
“J?” He looked up to the celling, waiting for his suspicion to be confirmed.
Steve still looked a bit bewildered, before he exhaled a long breath and shot Tony a grateful, tired half smile. ”Thank you, Tony.”
Steve turned to walk out of the door after a few seconds of silence, looking as if he had expected it.
Tony interrupted him, before he could make up an excuse as if Tony was
so he got pulled out of all of his classes and home schooled instead.
Tony has always loved a challenge and if that was the only thing he really could hold on to, who was gonna stop him?
Yeah, no, Peter didn’t look too convinced. He crossed his thin arms over his chest and chewed on his bottom lip. ”But — but you said I’d see Daddy again today! You said if I was behaving good with Uncle Bucky yesterday, I could play with Daddy again!”
When he looked back up to Rogers from where he had shortly broken the eye contact and stared at the hardwood floors, he could see it all. He didn’t know what he was feeling when he watched seemingly all his maybe-soon-anger drop out of Rogers, when the sadness took over his whole body again. Sadness sprinkled with resignation. But he had this faint look in his eyes, this strange determination that showed Tony that whatever he was about to say took a lot of courage.
“No, it succeeded. You’re sad, Tony.”
"You idiot, I couldn't care less if you can fight. This is about
Tony caught himself being actually disappointed when Steve sent
”After the park we’ll practice reading, though!” Steve shouted after him, only getting a little grumble in response.
. He was the boy’s father. He could take him away and finally give Tony the silence he graved ever since waking up. ”Daddy is awake! Look, he woke up!”
“What else could I possibly be talking about?” Tony didn’t make much of an effort to keep the hurt out of his voice. He didn’t think Steve would mock him like this but he had gotten many things wrong in the past.
”Aren’t I just lucky,” Tony stood up and leaned against his worktable, ”What’s up?”
”You won’t see him less, Munchkin. Not really. He will still be here, but he needs to figure his head out.”
Yeah, that sounded more like him than anything else he had seen of his 'present' life in the past few days.
Rogers didn’t take it.
Rogers crossed his arms over his chest, Tony was the last one to complain about seeing his biceps so on display. Yeah, he could really see Rogers and him together. In maybe one one-nightstand. Maybe, possibly, an ongoing booty — call, perhaps, yes. But marriage? Yeah, still no.
Tony went for the easiest solution, he turned on his heel and was about to lock himself in his bedroom. He didn’t even get as far as two steps in the direction of his safe place by the time Natasha grabbed him by his arm.
He didn’t know. He had no idea what had happened.
”Yeah, I just had a memory sneak up on me and knock me out,” Tony said, placing his glass on the table.
Steve nodded at him, obviously understanding the silent request to leave the workshop. He left looking more lost then ever. But everything Tony could think of was the fact that Steve didn’t deny that he deserved better all long.
Also, they were barely friends, why did she even
He broke a brown coffee cup 5 minutes later and threw that plan out of the window.
Looking back, that moment may have been the moment when everything went to hell. Or well, became more
Tony shook his head over and over again, standing up and walked past Rhodey, who looked weirdly out of place but with so much conviction in it, that Tony nearly huffed again.
His coffee.
Steve left the sentence unfinished, closing it with a little 'Please', as if it was a period. As if he didn’t need to say more, Tony would get it on his own.
Tony settled down on the couch, back against the arm rest and pulled a blanket over his legs, tablet in his arms. He actually really just wanted to look at some files, maybe find the one about the toy spider and see if Peter and he could get to work on it soon.
Bucky laid his hand over his heart in shock and gasped, fake. ”You wouldn’t dare, Rogers.”
“Fair point.” Tony looked the machine in front of him up and down. It looked like he’d just thrown tubes around and hoped, but this could actually be it. This could be the way for him, to finally fit in. To be what his father always wanted him to be. To
The only other person, who came to him - one time - was Rhodey, sitting in a wheelchair looking him disapprovingly up and down before making a teasing comment about them being hospital buddies and laughed with Tony together. It was so relaxing to finally laugh a bit again, to know that Rhodes
“I know that it’s confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I’m an emotionless, modest genius, like a superhero.”
His project for that night was to throw all the alcohol, backup alcohol and backup-backup alcohol out until his workshop was free from any of it. Hopefully he could go back to work, not missing pointless drinking once.
Tony didn’t want to know. Well, he
He couldn’t believe what just happened. Couldn’t believe that his approach had been to  do nothing.
I hope you enjoyed it!! I love, love, love to read your comments, they always make me smile 🥺
Just - Tony,” he didn't bother to turn around to face Steven; he threw one glance over his shoulder and then focused on the elevator doors that slid open and promised the privacy he craved, ”Don’t starve yourself in my name.”
Rogers didn’t seem to think that this was the end, though. He looked devastated but ready to try anything humanly possible to turn this whole thing around. Tony didn’t think that they’d find a way, but he kept his mouth shut, leaving Rogers to reach that conclusion on his own.
He felt more sick than he had before. How? How could he have gone from
Hey! Can you believe how fast I uploaded here again? Me neither!! But here I am anyway hi hello sdhfhd
Peter looked after his father till he walked out of his field of vision and then settled back against Tony more comfortably, sighing happily.
”Okay, stop that,” Tony called out, walking a few steps closer to the couch, from which Rogers only looked up at him questioningly. ”You look like a damsel in distress, Rogers, Jesus.”
But then Tony remembered the bright smile the man had shot his way when he had first woken up. A smile so bright, Tony couldn’t even picture it on Rogers anymore. He had this sadness to him now, that any smile would look out of place. Tony would find the thought sad, but he really couldn’t deal with someone else’s misery in addition to his own now, too.
, he really needed to drink something before his vocal cords attempted suicide.
”Not a chance, Rogers, not a chance,” he answered, biting into his own PB&J.
”He likes it better even though it’s not the fastest?” Tony asked in faux shock, hearing Steve chuckle deeply from where he still sat in the kitchen. When Tony turned his head to look at him, Steve just continued to smile slightly at him, nodding with so much gratitude that Tony felt as if he had to tell him that he didn’t just do it for him.
this was more. He just
- it was more than personal with him. Steve meant the world to him: he trusted him, he
. Rhodey was easy company. Having his back for sure, didn’t complain about Tony bringing people with him; but always looking with something like — like
— this was a no no — topic for Tony. Because he might be able to forgive Clint and Sam and even Bucky, because his real self deserved forgiving, but
Steve immediately shot around, obviously militarily trained to be on full alert, but also obviously without laying his pencil down first, which ended in a big black line straight through his picture, “Dammit, Bucky,” he shouted before he closed his mouth with an audible sound, flexing his jaw.
”I just wanted to check in, we haven’t talked in quite a while.”
Tony began to sound desperate, because he needed Steve to get that. He was not worth it.
”Yeah, Stark, thanks.” Clint nodded at him and gave Tony a friendly pat on the shoulder. This little touch made Tony freeze in order to suppress a flinch; just for a tiny second before he plastered his trained bright smile onto his face, even though it felt weirdly heavy too, as if his skin didn’t quite fit anymore. So here he was, trying to look unconcerned, like this wasn’t killing him inside.
Tony startled so hard, his heart beat way too fast for the next 10 minutes.
The man laughed again and hold his right hand to Tony.
Tony wasn’t stupid, he knew that he hadn’t been at fault
The message was obvious. One wrong move and Steve would attack.
He always kept the memories of her close, while his father’s faded away. He had only been angry with Tony, there was nothing he could do about it, even if he wanted to.
“Takes one to know one.” Tony shot back, hoping to avoid the conversation about all
Tall Blonde and him.
Tony shook his head breaking the heavy eye contact. This guy really needed to start to stop looking at Tony like he was already working on plans from A over to B all the way to Z. Calculating how to best attack to get the best outcome. Tony didn’t like it. He only knew this guy for about 3 hours now and he was already sick of him trying to fix things. As far as Tony was concerned he just needed a break right now. He didn’t want to work on plans to fix him, he just wanted to be left alone.
Rogers’s lips twisted in something that could be a smile if it wasn’t filled with so much pain. So, so much that Tony swore he could feel it, too.
”No problem,” Tony answered, uncomfortable. He didn’t really know what he should say now, it was weird. Standing here, in the middle of the night in the dimly lit kitchen after he had all but fled out of the house. ”Thanks for waiting up, I guess?”
But it wasn’t.
”Good thing that Uncle Bucky always encourages that, Petey. Really big thanks, Buck,” he said teasing, before reaching on top of the kitchen counter, putting a coffee pot in front of Tony.
good food to try to substitute for everything he’s lost.
He went up to the wooden door, feeling happy to see Steve again. Who’d have known that feeling can be this
, at least.”
He didn’t know when exactly both their views changed. They’ve been out of college for a long time, Rhodey went to the military, where he could die and Tony guessed was the reason why Rhodey’s mother always cried, when seeing him again and letting him go.
The problem with that was that Tony had no idea what he even wanted to ask. There were so many things he just couldn’t understand.
“Jesus.”
Steve looked at Bucky, who sighed and pulled Steve into a tight hug. ”Everything will be okay, Stevie, you hear me? It’s a good sign. I’ll take Petey to eat ice cream and tell him the best ways to annoy you, yes?”
“Steve is my roommate,” Bucky told him before stepping to the side, “Second door on the left, make sure to knock, or you’ll startle this punk and he’ll mess up his drawing and pout all week long. Been there, done that, barely survived. Losing my arm was less painful.” He shrugged and then grinned mischievously.
The silence pulled around them like a cloak. Taking presence like a third person in the room.
Steve’s shoulders dropped together with his half smile in a terribly devastated way. He looked defeated and also as if he had just been caught. As if he was embarrassed of his own reactions.
Peter groaned again and then walked to his room, pouting.
Oh, how he wanted to tell her. All his thoughts or just an
broken to be ever repaired again and oddly resigned about it.
What does fear feel like?” He closed his eyes and rested his head on Rhodey’s lap, waiting for his friend to order his thoughts.
”We’ll make it in cool colors!” He babbled away, while Tony tried to keep up with him. ”Red, maybe. How awesome would that be?”
He couldn’t add that to this pain, too. He had already known that Steve didn’t feel the same way about him. It was why he had never said anything about it before. But actually knowing it was still something completely different. Now he had the proof he never wanted.
know what you’re missing. Other people can make you miss it, though. If you never knew that the sky was blue, you’d never assume it was, ergo you wouldn’t try and change anything.
Tony just had this bitter sweet taste in his mouth.
Rhodes wrinkled his nose and took another sip out of his beer bottle.
He should have known, though, that his life just wasn’t that way. His life never made steps forward without throwing him back at least twice as many steps. Or sometimes even whole decades back.
Yet, Rogers left looking like he had just lost the thing that made his earth spin.
Hit. Sunken. And hell did Steve hit the mark. Tony felt agony, he felt like his heart was deliberately missing a few beats, while he starred at Steve in disbelieve.
Jesus, he hoped they were. He loved his house there. And it was also big enough to be able to avoid Rogers and his kid till they got the message that Tony was different now, was as he used to be, was who he was meant to be.
It was awesome.
”Daddy?” He said again and Tony really didn’t need to hear a kid call him that. He was many things and admittedly 'Asshole' also made it on the list, but 'Father' didn’t. He had been careful, at least when it came to that.
”I have nightmares.”
He got hit with a warm feeling, deep inside of him, lightening his world up and making his eyes tear up in — pure
The truth is — I am emotionless.”
. Look at someone and thinking
He didn’t know if he could find the words to explain to Steve how wrong he was, so he said nothing.
”Well, you sure did fly right into my arms now didn’t you, Wingman.”
Tony scratched his forehead and then caressed over his goatee. ”Huh,” he said slowly and calculated. ”I really don’t see myself as the kind of guy who just stayed with one person. And you’re sure I didn’t cheat?”
Not only the color, though, more like everything.
Tony didn’t believe that he would ever find a person he had trusted enough to tell them all about his father, but apparently he had.
(I am so busy rn, it's not even funny anymore -- but I have like the whole story already written (I actually wrote it literally 7 months ago fsddhfdsj hi)
Hell, there was a time, when the only thing that could possibly keep him alive could also kill him at any given moment; but looking at Steve was far worse than any of that.
Asking him if he was
So gently as if everything about Tony was
“Do I need to stay?” It wasn’t a demand. It didn’t sound annoyed either. It sounded genuinely concerned as if Steve would jump at the chance to do whatever it took to help Tony.
That night, Tony sat alone in his workshop and, for the first time in months, the glass full of scotch felt wrong in his hands. He just looked at it, turned it in his hand, watched how the bright light from the celling changed its color to a soft gold, but he couldn’t bring himself to drink it. He’d stopped drinking, back when he was still together with Steve; it’d been a hard fight, they both had to work so hard to keep his alcoholism under control, but they did it. But after Steve’s shield nearly killed him, he didn’t see a point in stopping with alcohol anymore. It’s not like anyone cared anyway.
When Bucky left the kitchen, it was as if he had taken all the things that had blocked out the tension with him.
”What were you playing with, Peter?” Tony asked, his voice sounding weirdly thin and freaked out, but Peter only giggled and took Tony’s hand, dragging him over to the couch, where he pointed him to sit down, already holding a bright red car directly in front of his eyes.
Rogers ruffled his son’s hair and filled orange juice in his cup, giving it to Peter who extended his hands greedily.
Tony sounded a lot less tired and broken than he thought he would. In fact, he sounded rather strong, as if telling Steve to leave his workshop wasn’t one of the things he never thought he’d need to do.
Funny enough, he felt mostly numb afterwards. Not like he did before, when he just didn’t feel anything more like — he could feel
eyes lit up with excitement and he shuffled a bit on Roger’s lap, to get a better look of Tony. ”Then you can read to me again! Papa and Uncle Bucky don’t get the dinosaur voices right.”
, pop the question. He couldn’t believe that, so he just wouldn’t accept it. Denial was one of his stronger trades, always had been.
His new life had him reading to a child in dinosaur voices in it.
“Yeah, okay, yeah.”
So Tony just swallowed all his feelings down, ignoring the burning inside of him and closed his expression off again.
Tony’s eyes shined bright in challenge.
Even though he still had trouble telling what was really happening and what of all this mess was actually reality and what was not, one thing was certain. Steve Rogers knew about his feelings for him. And if Tony was good at one thing then it was avoiding things that really needed to be addressed.
“All different, I guess.”
He was so many different pieces at ones and none of them quite fit anymore.
But Tony
Tony cringed away slightly and just starred at the kid as if it was an experiment gone wrong.
and he took it as the best sign there was.
”Jarvis, no,” his voice sounded husky and small.
They sat together in silence for a while longer, till Tony scratched himself behind his ear and turned his attention back to Rhodes.
“I thought you had found out somehow and it used it against me.” Steve hunched over a bit, his crossed arms slowly slipping back to his sides, his shoulders hanging, “I am sorry.”
Tony looked at Steve like he had been caught doing something illegal, not just trying to leave his own house.
“I am feeling a bit sad, you have obvious been through your fair share of bullshit. I am also angry at whoever trained you to fear asking questions.” He took another sip of his beer, before he pulled a grimace and looked him up and down.
, right there on his torso.
He really did not. His heart was not the problem, though. It never has been.
Rogers was about to pick up the next shirt but then dropped his hands to his sides instead, turning to look at Tony with a tiredness that just a father could muster. ”Let you see what?”
He just didn’t think about it. He was a genius, it would take him less than a minute to figure out what was happening to him, so he just pushed it away. He just really wanted to pretend for a little while longer that everything was normal; that he didn’t skip more meals than attend, that his nightmares weren’t becoming more frequent and his panic attacks weren’t getting worse, that he wasn’t always on the edge of a breakdown and that he wasn’t just holding everything together with much coffee and willpower made out of steel.
“Yeah, sure.” Steve raised an eyebrow and walked one step closer to him, “Because you never knew anything else. I’m right, aren’t I? You never felt one positive thing in your life, did you?”
on him, he felt like a prisoner more often then not.
He wanted to tell her that he couldn’t even tell if that was worse than the voice whispering. Because that voice just reminded him that he had been awake through all of it, he had obviously tried to fight it and now he couldn’t remember any of that. It had just erased his memory and even though it was coming back, who said that this was the only thing this demon took from him? What if it was still inside of him, just hiding? Or still making decisions while leaving him feeling like he was in charge?
“I don’t know,” Tony took a shuttering breath, feeling how his mask slipped off of his face, “I can’t tell if those dreams are just dreams. I’m back, Steve. I am back in my head but not in control. Not even riding shotgun; I’m locked in the trunk and all I can do it watch.”
Tony didn’t know why he was the one who had to hide how annoyed he was with the whole thing right now. He was trying to provoke Rogers a little, but his way of being easy to tease and simultaneously too calm to show a reaction just seemed wrong and unfair.
He came up empty. Not only ring and child wise, but completely. He couldn’t recall if he had even gone home with anyone. The last thing he could remember was Rhodey picking him up the morning after a party. But he wasn’t at Rhodey’s either, that much he was sure of. And Rhodey also didn’t have a child, or he had a lot of explaining to do.
Tony got wasted for the second time in years that night and woke up just how he passed out:
Tony didn’t even bother with trying to sleep anymore. If it overwhelms him than so be it, he’ll get his two hours until he wakes up, bathed in sweat, unheard screams on his lips; but he never laid down to sleep anymore. It would end up with nightmares anyway.
With that he walked to the elevator as quickly as he could without it being considered running, not that Natasha even tried to go after him. She had always seemed to watch him, she’d always been there when he was in the common rooms, always there not really saying anything about it really, but observing. Tony had no illusion that she needed to ask or talk to get all the info she wanted; he never felt more exposed, raw, and stripped down in his life.
And for a few seconds he was under water again, he forgot how to breath, all the air got pressed out of his lungs and he had the urge to lay his hands over the arc reactor — which he forgot wasn’t in his chest anymore — to not give Steve any chance to take this as well. And that might be the most hurtful thing of it all, Tony was really convinced that Steve was capable of doing so. Steve made Tony feel the urge to protect something that wasn’t there, but was considered as his greatest weakness, so Steve couldn’t take that from him too. Tony swallowed dryly and focused on Steve’s nose instead of his eyes. Nobody could tell a difference, but it was easier for Tony this way. It never hurt that much to look in somebody’s eyes before.
his damn issue was. Before he could even answer, though, did the boy chime in, putting his chin on the man’s shoulder and then pointing at Tony with a strangely familiar smug expression.
The constant heavy feeling everywhere in his body wouldn’t go away. Seeing Rhodes, the one friend he could always count on, working his ass off to walk again hurt so much, he couldn’t put it into words. Everything felt numb and cold, but also hurtful and he couldn’t think of anything that could make him feel better and less like a shell of himself.
him. Well, it
This whole welcoming back thing turned out worse than he had hoped for, but better than he expected.
He had a whole new sight on things now: Steve fell for him when he was still like that.
”His lip wobbled, Steven, if I had bought a dog, it would have been justified.”
Tony thought he might faint.
“Huh?” Rhodes only threw one gaze over his shoulder and went back to focus on two of the books.
If Steve felt for him what Tony felt for Steve, he’d stay, right? Then again, it was probably better this way anyway. Steve deserved everything and well, Tony didn’t even scratch the surface of that.
Steve had had this kind of doubt in their relationship.
Tony was about done with all of this when he saw Peter’s bottom lip wobble, before big tears rolled down his cheeks. ”But Papa promised!” He sobbed and Tony just stood there, not really knowing what was expected of him right now.
Steve nodded understanding, before shooting him a little smile and then follow their impatient son out of the door.
”He was planned.” He looked mildly offended, as if Tony doubting that it was apparently his, apparently planned child, was the most insulting thing.
“Are you asking me out?”
Because they knew. He was more unarmed than ever, he never
“Oh, so you can be trusted to know what you feel when you’ve been able to feel for 27 years and everybody beyond that just can’t?” It was part of an honest question, even. Tony really wanted to know, but mostly did he just want to convince Steve that he could do
”Steve!” He exclaimed while already jumping from the bed, ignoring the dizzy feeling in his head. Making his way to the kitchen, his thoughts were spinning around, making him want to throw up.
it would be one hell of a deal, but this went far deeper.
Clint only nodded and looked him up and down, before shaking Lucky awake and then standing up when his dog moved his head away from his leg.
His son.
“You know how fucked you’d be if you were able to feel frustration?” Rhodey asked behind him, while he studied Tony’s cars.
He looked up and met her eyes right across the table. He didn’t flinch per se but it was
”What?” Tony asked again, beginning to worry. Steve looked as if he had lost something precious, something irreplaceable and Tony really couldn’t tell what he needed to do to make it all better again.
The man leaned against the door frame now and looked him up and down.
He ended up putting the ring on the chain of the tags and put both of it around his neck again, ignoring the feeling as if he was being choked by the sheer weight of them.
Yeah, no. He didn’t want to know about his past — future self and his beach afternoons with child and husband. He just wanted to throw a big
Tony’s teeth began to click together, as the shivering grew. He had wondered how long he had to stay, because he only wanted to go home. And when he finally did come home, he just threw their stuff out. He didn’t have anything of his parents left, because he hadn’t cared, but now he felt as if the only thing that could make the heaviness of his bones go away, was to smell his mother’s sharp perfume only one more time. It had always made his nose itch, but now he’d give his life for it.
Until he passed out.
be best for everyone, especially the kid, when they just accept that Tony couldn’t be that person anymore. The family father he apparently has been.
Tony added 'Too Easy For Others To Read' to things he hated about himself. He was new to the emotion thing, but he thought that he got better with hiding what he felt. Apparently not. But then he closed his eyes, took a deep breath and lets his expression shift and he smiles, like he did for the cameras, like his father had always told him to. And whatever misery he had been feeling was pushed down, as it had never even been there in the  first place.
”Daddy!”
Deep down Tony knew that this was bullshit, that they would listen and try to help, but for him it was just yet another weakness. Another thing that made him vulnerable. His bones were probably as easy to break as a dry stick.
For a tiny second he wished that he could just make it stop. Press a button and transmit all those information bits out of his brain God knows where. That would be selfish, though. Now that he knew how much all those people suffered, how could he let that happen?
”No, it’s — I don’t,” Steve paused. The silence was weighed down with every minute they’ve spent as a team, as friends
Steve knew. Steve knew about how he felt and he never said anything. He hadn’t come to Tony about it, never seek the talk. He knew and he ignored it.
Well, if life was fair, he’d be healthy and happy in his workshop right now. But life wasn’t fair and some things can’t be avoided.
https://archiveofourown.org/works/16730871/chapters/39244470
Tony was about way too tired to deal with that now . Whatever it was that made Steve even more miserable just now, he’d have to figure it alone.
to the machine prototype in the corner of the workshop.
but he didn’t care that it did, because
“I am just fine, Mr. Rogers, thank you.”
”Tony, I never meant to hurt — ” Steve interrupted himself before Tony could, probably realizing just how much nonsense he was saying, but that was just a theory.
Tony blinked in a total of 26 times before he walked directly into Steve’s personal space and looked him right in the eyes.
And everybody knew it.
(See the end of the chapter for
just now watched his whole world falling apart.
His voice sounded so tiny and broken that Tony was about to fight heaven and earth if it meant making all the pain go away.
He was six when his parents seemed to catch up some more. He didn’t. He never knew anything else. He did not understand why everybody was shouting and why his Mom was crying, while his Dad yelled at him to just
Rogers only looked at the tags in his hand as if he just recognized them as something he has connected a bunch of memories to, but now didn’t know anymore how it fit in all of these.
”Exquisitely handled, Sir,” Jarvis commented, to which Tony just flipped him off in the nearest camera.
answered slowly, sounding far away.
He hadn’t heard many explanations about emotions in his life. Mostly because people didn’t find the words or time, didn’t have the patience. Nobody really told him anything but Rhodey anyway, so he just — he felt like running more often than not. He didn’t get it. He only got that emotions hurt and you can’t make it stop, it’s always there, so why were people so obsessed with it anyway?
And maybe he never should have stopped.
”What do you think?” Tony threw his hands in the air, before grinning smugly. ”Your dick, of course. It has to be like
Peter just looked as if Tony had lost his mind. ”Yes?”
Rogers shushed the kid, petting over his hair. Tony still didn’t think that he should be here for that. It felt weirdly intimate, as if it was inappropriate of him to watch it. He stayed seated though, for no reason he could put into words.
How long  have I been out?”
“You look really sick. You sure you’re alright?” Clint asked first thing after a few seconds of uncomfortable silence in which Tony just leaned against the counter and was quiet.
He stared blankly at the door of his bedroom. He didn’t doubt that it hadn’t been real. But at the same time he just hung onto the hope that it had been. Because there was no other explanation to it why Steve hadn’t said anything about it but that he just wanted to forget it. And Tony couldn’t even think about that right now. He was in a burning pain ever since he got back to himself after Doctor Strange had pulled it away from Tony’s body.
Once Tony was alone again he closed his eyes and tried to make out how good his chances would be to just walk out of here. He could Jarvis to not tell Bruce, but he didn’t trust himself to have enough energy to even
Tony laughed, just a little sound. It made the whole scene seem a lot more domestic. ”I stand to my word.”
Tony had thought getting his first memory back would be something big. Marvellous. Too great to even be able to fully understand. The truth was, though, he sat at the breakfast table, watching Peter spilling the milk from cereal everywhere and then from a second to the next he saw it. A clear image right in front of him.
”Yes,” Tony answered, not letting any of his thoughts show. Even rolling his eyes at Steve’s back for good measure. ”I told you, I’m fine. It was a good sign, honestly. I might be able to remember even more soon!”
“And since when exactly do you care, huh? Now that you got everything you wanted, I am worth a second thought again? You’re
Peter looked from his father over to Tony, who had just discovered his finger nails as the most interesting thing in the world. He looked up in time though, to throw a raised eyebrow in the kid’s direction.
”I am sorry, Tony. I know I hurt you.”
What if Steve expected more from him now? It wasn’t like he was cured or anything, he still was the exact same person he’d been before. He could feel some things and some just not and he doubted that it would change. He didn’t have any scientific explanation for how this whole love thing even happened yet, but he still was sure that this had been an 'one in never again’ kinda thing. Like he could
Natasha looked at him with a thoughtful expression, her right eyebrow raised and her front teeth buried in her bottom lip. Barnes next to her had his eyes on the floor, everything about him screamed guilt and he didn’t seem as if he was willing to fight. He just looked devastated and so, so tired. Tony felt a tiny bit empathy. He had more time to think about everything, and found that he didn’t hate James, even though he surely should.
”Nah,” he answered, looking at Steve with what he hoped were honest and open eyes. ”I wanted to look through my files some more.”
“Okay, smart ass. So when you get startled and feel your heart bounding in your chest, your blood running, pulsing loud in your ears? It’s like that, but stronger. A bit harder to get over.”
There was none of the usual sadness in Steve’s eyes anymore. Tony’d be proud that he finally did it, getting the sadness away, if the new expression didn’t feel like it was slowly peeling his skin off of his bones.
”Good morning, Bruce,” he tried an easy grin that failed gloriously, “Legolas.”
to understand my point of view? Do you have to make everything so complicated ?”
you, Tony.”
Tony couldn’t think of anything else to say, that was it. Steve had drawn a line and Tony understood it, he really did. But right here he felt moments away from collapsing to his knees, he had lost the this, this
It seemed like this really could be a good day. He had made another step forward.
Tony was about to shake his head and take the offered hand, when the sunlight got caught on something on his left hand and gleamed in a soft gold.
Tony clenched his glass-free hand into a fist and exhaled sharply. He would not care, just like Rogers wouldn’t. They’ve been over for
“He is six, it will be fine.” His father told his wife over and over again, while she took a few steps from Tony, looking like she didn’t believe it for a second.
Somewhere far away he could hear Jarvis talking to him, but Tony couldn’t do much more than look in the vague direction of  one camera.
Jesus.
He could hear the child talking outside fast and then turned his attention back to the father, who still looked like he was ready to fight his way out of this room. Funny, Tony didn’t even know why he was here to begin with.
- Nick ♥️
“Well, think about it, you people smile when you’re happy. You literally show your teeth when you are pleased by something.”
He still didn’t get it. He asked Jarvis to tell him every detail from his way to get there again, but this didn’t mean that he had to get it.
And he had no idea what to do with that.
But at least the team became more easy around each other, even though Tony tried to keep his distance and never let any deep—feelings talk happen. Steve tried to talk to him again, more than once, but Tony was good at finding ways to escape any conversation.
“So sometimes people think of spiders and nearly get a heart attack?”
”Peter?” Steve called out, voice husky, before he looked around the kitchen confused, till his eyes landed on Tony.
Rhodey drowned half of his cup of coffee in one go, before he stopped all together. As if he just froze in the middle of existing, till his mouth fell open in realization.
When they all finished up with their food, Peter was already bouncing up and down on his chair in excitement, eyes big and amazed.
. That he didn’t really know how to do so, but that he will, for their sake. He knew that his best always fell short, but he could try, at least. All he needed was
He said it again and again until he forgot the silence that was pressing down on him.
Was his back aching from the strange angle he had to be in, in order to work on one of his cars? Maybe. Was his stomach rumbling, wanting food? Probably. Were exactly six fingers bloody and hurting? Definitely.
“Ha, Ha. I wish I could, but there is just no way,
Tony shrugged his silence off and turned the tag another time, reading out loud: ”Captain. Captain Steven Grant Rogers.”
Steve nodded, saying nothing, seemingly waiting for Tony to go ahead and ask what he wanted to know.
Tony smiled brightly,
. What he wasn’t though was a father. Or a husband.
Same with Sam, but a bit icier, as if they were only on the edge between gentle teasing and ripping each other’s heads off. But that could be because he didn’t know him as well and still didn’t really know exactly
Tony nodded quickly, focusing back to his tablet.
Steve straightened his shoulders and looked down at him with sad eyes, like he looked right through Tony’s attended humor and didn’t like what he saw. Funny, neither did Tony.
What do you do when you’re afraid? He looked down at his shaking hands and tried to think rationally but he really couldn’t. There just was so
“Well, I guess you don’t
“Sorry, I didn’t know you
. Seriously, you should be thanking me in five languages and praising me in songs all at once for not kicking your lazy ass out on the streets.”
Yeah, that was about as much as Tony could take.
Peter, though, didn’t look at him. He looked at his legs and then got up, running out of the workshop, sobbing.
. Because he really was. Fixing things had been
Maybe even with so much force that he could have won a stuffed animal or two.
But he felt okay. Like he had all the time on earth to find the proof he needed so badly. Sadly the world never did wait for someone and so he found himself standing opposite of Steve who looked
Tony,” Rogers said slowly, dragging his name out, as if it was way more than just two syllables. ”There is a line. You’re overstepping it.”
“Barton, if you plan on drinking all the coffee, you have to
“Which one is it, huh?”
”Is there something you need, Tony?” Rogers asked, sounding tired. Tony wondered how this man even managed to keep his sad pout on when he was as tired as he sounded.
”Eight,” he said proudly, holding eight fingers up. Tony just blinked at him. ”Papa and I counted eight doggies!”
With so much wonder and happiness.
It was hard for him to answer the question as to
“No, I am serious. You deserve all your happiness for yourself.”
"I don’t need to prove anything to you,” he said pouty, crossing his arms over his chest.
— god forbid, 3 Hail Marys for his poor soul, blah blah blah— was the end of his future career at Stark Industries.
He tried to go on with his life. Sometime he did okay at that, laughed when he was supposed to, polite to his employees and friends, but when he came home, he felt like he was breaking.
Peter giggled and sat down in his lap, landing against his chest, holding a book out for Steve.
Steve locked eyes with him, reading all of Tony’s questions he couldn’t say out loud as if they were written on his forehead.
Tony sighed and snipped to get the boy’s attention, who to his credit turned around in an instance and then smiled again, as if seeing Tony was something great and exciting.
Tony fled out of the kitchen, the last thing he saw was Rogers picking the crying kid up and beginning to rub over his back, trying to soothe him, talking in a soft voice to the distressed child.
Tony huffed one time, of course was it his fault. Who else was to blame, really.
Bucky raised his arm in surrender, but an easy smile stayed on his lips. ”I wasn’t about to say anything. Just wanted to keep you from thanking me for not buying a dog. It really was a close one.”
The irony was even bigger in that one, in hindsight.
“Yeah,” he says, his gaze slightly past Steve, “I don’t think either one of us believes that anymore.”
He could see them try their hardest to not double check him when he walked into a room and really, they didn’t seem that bothered by it anymore, things like that just happened. But he felt different. He hadn’t been mind controlled, he hadn’t been
”Fathers leave,” Tony answered harshly, about finished with it all. ”No reason to be a pussy about it.”
“Jarvis,” his voice sounded as if he’d just eaten sandpaper for months; he swallowed dryly 3 times and licked over his lips, ignoring his booming headache and took a deep breath, ”For goodness’ sake, turn the sun down.”
”I would give it to you,” Rogers stated, crossing his arms.
Barnes, and
When he got to the living room though, he halted in the doorway, staring at the scene before him. Peter was crying in Steve’s arm, who kneeled to be on the kid’s height.
When he looked back at Steve, his expression was so deeply understanding that Tony felt exposed, for some reason. It was as if Steve just looked right through him, his masks and defences; he might as well be analysing Tony’s bone structure by now. He had people undress him with their eyes with less effort.
for once.
Steve looked after his son and then rubbed his hand through his hair, taking another shuttering breath before getting up, not walking closer to Tony. He looked at his hand though, as if he wanted to grab it. He looked defeated and as if ready to give anything right now to stop whatever
so there’s that.”
“Na, Kleiner, what do you feel in your heart, when you see your mother being sad? Are you feeling sad then, too?”
that much.
He felt like all he could do right now was hand the fire a glass of gasoline. He had no idea how to answer the kid’s question.
He just wanted to be left alone and drink something that cost more than most people’s monthly rent.
”I’m sorry, Pete,” Steve said slowly, crossing his hands in front of the child’s belly, hugging him to his chest and burring his nose in the boy’s hair, closing his eyes for a second. ”Daddy isn’t feeling so good right now, but he will come back home with us tomorrow.”
Well, famous last words.
The ring felt warm in his hand. Little and smooth, but when he looked closely he could see little scratches on it. He must have always been wearing it, without even so much as taking it off to work in the lab. Strange thought. Him being so gone for a person that he’d wear a reminder of that forever.
Yeah, well, he had always been bad at that.
”Spiders,” Tony repeated, ”Your favourite animals are spiders because they were printed on your snuggles.”
Steve nodded as answer in a downright heartbreaking manner. “I don’t expect anything from you, Tony. You are in the middle of recovering and I didn’t want to make it harder on you. Like the others didn’t too. You hurt them.”
”Ay, ay, Captain.”
“Good observation.” Tony grinned at him, to which he got a mocking, raised eyebrow as an answer.
In the end there was always just him. He wasn’t supposed to have nice things. He didn’t deserve them.
much better!” He giggled, holding onto his uncle’s long hair.
Tony couldn’t believe that he actually had this conversation with his husband right now. That was what you get for being brave, apparently.
Tall Blonde gritted his teeth and then settled back to the heavy eye contact. There was more than just blue to his eyes, it was as if they were trying to communicate with him. Begging him for something and Tony was really too tired for anything but straight out explanations. He looked away.
It all came raining down on him. His mother’s tears. Oh, help him god,
”Just please don’t just disappear from Peter’s life. I know you don’t owe me anything and I know that you don’t care about me,” he repeated that last part and still made Tony feel like he was gonna be sick. He didn’t know why those words make him feel like he needed to disagree.
Clint, Steve and his always following shadow Bucky looked down on the floor instantly, Natasha just raised an unimpressed eyebrow and Sam eyed him up and down and then inhaled sharply, whispering
Tony only nodded shorty, not knowing how such a little word could break his heart this much.
Even Tony couldn’t bite back the grin that broke his resting sarcastic, challenging mask; while Clint had to hold onto the table, trying to get some air in his lungs between his loud, breathless laughter.
Seeing it so exposed out in the open made him want to take it back. Take it back, burry it deep, make sure nobody could ever see it again. Would ever know it existed in the first place.
Tony didn’t pay any attention to him, though, all he could think of was the one little image that had rushed through his thoughts. It was just so unreal.
to get it, Tony knew the truth. He’s seen it in Steve’s eyes.
”Don’t.” Rogers’s voice was strained as if he had to take all his trained strength to keep himself from reacting poorly. Tony dropped his hand with the chain and raised an eyebrow at him.
Tony smirked even though it felt like his face was cracking in half. Steve shook his head again and seemed completely baffled by Tony saying that.
Tony nodded and his head in his hands, trying to breath and find a clear thought. All he saw over and over again was Clint’s pained expression.
“I always wanted to know, but nobody ever took the time to explain it to me. You seem like you would.”
“Am I like — a good Dad?” He had to know. He might be ready to try again, or for the first time but at first he had to know that he had at least a slight chance of doing right with the kid. If Peter told him no to this question he’d leave, he was sure of it. He might be many things but he would not stand for that.
“Stop it, Tony,” well now,
When he walked into the kitchen the next morning, it was silent so he hoped for the best and then nearly choked to death on his own spit when tall, dark hair, one arm —
Tony figured that the thing that annoyed him most was that Rogers seemed ready to be angry. He seemed ready to argue. But he was holding back, hiding everything behind this clam and heartbroken mask and Tony could just explode in frustration.
It took him a while to get down from that high, but when he finally did, he began to wonder. The happiness was still pooling inside of him, making him feel easy and light, throwing a shadow of all the darkness that had found it’s way deep inside of him all those months ago.
”What?”
It was a good look on him.
Peter, who pulled his eyebrows down and cocked his head. ”You don’t want to be my Dad?”
"Tony, you look thinner.”
”But Uncle Bucky said I could go see Daddy!” The kid pouted, crossing his little arms over his chest. He really looked a lot like his father.
“You are in the tower.” He always was. This was always how it started. He began to fight against the arms around him, pressing his eyes closed, wishing he had to energy to cover his ears. Everything was so loud around him.
The press after that was hell.
He stared at the mess in front of him, gaping like he couldn’t believe what just happened, and he really couldn’t. He couldn’t grasp anything right now, really.
It was his mistake, really.  He was a
flinch when he heard a loud whistle from the counter behind him.
Tony shrugged the words off as if they didn’t mean the world to him. Knowing Steve, he probably saw
going back to his drawing , understanding that Tony needed to do this in privacy. Or semi - privacy. Well, whatever it was, Tony appreciated it even though he was horrified.
Well, not yes per se, he lived in the ‘adult world'
There had to be a moment he couldn’t pinpoint, when he started to look at butter but then decided to eat his piece of bread just like it was, because he couldn’t help himself but feel really uneasy just looking at it; but he couldn’t recall when it was. It must’ve been months since his coffee turned blacker, long enough for it to not even taste bitter for him anymore.
”Tony, ever thought that there was a reason he didn’t? Because that’s the point, he
underneath his breath.
"No, no!
”Of course you aren’t,” Steve repeated, sounding just about as broken as his face looked.
for goodness’ sake, this should be easy for him.
Rhodey grinned and sank down on the couch obviously agreeing with him to just let it go.
He couldn’t help but wonder if that meant that Rogers was falling out of love with him.
The one thing he’d forever be thinking about when asked what he’d change if he could travel time.
Steve’s features turned concerned again when he laid his hands on top of Tony’s, closing his eyes.
“Well, you certainly do a great expression of someone who does.”
This here was Rogers’s and his second chance, though. And they had fucked it up. Life would lead in a different direction from here. No doubt, if this had been the first time they had met, they would have ended up as not even friends. Just passing strangers.
his finger nails digging in his palms,
“So Cap leaving me behind to
2 Inches.
The subject turned to face the door flinching so quickly his whole spine made a cracking sound.
Well, he had met Tony while he was still like that and hadn’t pulled the biggest U-Turn in his life. He had stayed.
, Tin Hat, we’re just trying to help you
but he was head over heels gone for Steve. This wasn’t not
anymore.
“And that’s not your fault. I am not blaming you.”
That was easier thought than done, though. He had no idea how to be a father. He didn’t know what to do with the kid.
In hindsight, Tony should have begged Steve to come with them.
The man flinched out of his haze and then turned to his kid, kissing his forehead before settling him down on the floor and crouching in front of him. Tony was about to ask if they needed privacy before realizing that this was ridiculous.
close to it. He banged the door open without knocking, wanting to be over and done with it before the hopefulness faded away.
He tried to find his best options, maybe crack another joke, see if he could get any reaction out of Rogers. Anything but his sad frown.
“No.” It wasn’t loud or harsh, but certainly with had a sharp warning to it, leaving no room for discussion.
Steve was not about to forgive and forget shit. Steve was in for blood. No matter where he’d have to draw it.

“Would your answer be yes?”
Something to hold onto.
A sharp pain went right through his whole body, made him shake more and let more tears spill from his eyes, into his mouth. Who’d have thought that you could taste sadness, salty and bitter.
Tony left the statement unanswered, not quite believing that somehow, some time there had been a version of him, who put child safety seats in his cars, calculated to always be able to have a good view on a child.
Tony threw one last look over his shoulder, nodding slightly. Steve relaxed so visibly that Tony wondered how his body could have ever held all this tension in.
Then he just let out a huff of air, letting his shoulders fall and his head with them. That was it. Yeah, he had said that. And maybe he should’ve just stayed with this truth instead of trying to fit in a 'forever' before everything turns to shit, when he couldn’t even get a year.
They were married for fuck’s sake !
Steve flexed his jaw and then nodded, his expression not slipping once. ”Down the hall, third door on your left.”
It always began with him walking though the tower. It wasn’t unusual, he lived here after all, but it still felt weirdly empty. As if somebody had taken all the life out of it. Though it looked the same, it felt completely foreign at the same time. As if somebody had taken every small detail of what made this tower to his home and changed it.
Tony laid his feet back on Rhodey’s lab, with a little more force than necessary, but his friend didn’t even as much as flinch.
“People have apple seeds, apparently and I don’t. I can’t feel.” He lulled, grinning toothily, too tired of hiding who he really was.
for eye contact with the 4 year old. Tony felt oddly out of place, watching them interact so fluently, obviously having a routine when it came to talking about important stuff.
His head still won’t really grasp it, it still gave him a terrified taste in the back of his mouth, but maybe this time he could really try.
”You were nervous for days around me,” Steve said, looking at his hands that were lying in his lap, private smile so heavy on his lips as if it’d never leave. ”I thought I had done something wrong. I actually brought you flowers to apologize for not having realized that I did something wrong and obviously for what I actually did.”
He didn’t know. He didn’t know what he was supposed to answer, he was tired and his father smiled at him coldly, as if he was about to throw the tantrum his parents wanted Tony to throw so badly.
Tony looked up and right into Rhodes’ eyes, who seemed purely concerned.
”What?” Tony asked back, feeling way too tired to actually figure Roger’s shit out right now.
he couldn’t bring himself to do anything more than just stare. He felt so
Not that he’d show Rogers that. The game was on.
And just like he had predicted, he didn’t feel any better. He just felt way worse. He couldn’t even feel his headache; he just felt unbelievably numb and there was nothing that could pull him out of this.
Rogers looked up from the chain and then nodded in Tony’s direction lightly, as if he had needed further proof that those tags did belong to him.
Steve scratched the back of his head, and the only thing that kept Tony from saying
But he now knew that it felt like having a tiny heater against his chest when holding the kid. Also that Peter was so light and fit so comfortably in his arms, something in him couldn’t stop screaming that he didn’t want him to grow up further. He was perfect just the way he was right now. He also knew now that Peter’s shampoo smelled like strawberries and that he had a problem in pronouncing the letter R.
Tony huffed again, not knowing why he felt so insulted by those words. Maybe because he had subconsciously always thought that he already was better than that, but never thinking about why. This put him on the spot. But the last thing Tony would consider doing right now was agreeing with Rogers. ”Dear,” he answered instead awfully sweet, hiding that the words had hit him like a sucker punch. ”I have literally no idea who you are.”
Rogers had this little smile again, definitely remembering back to something that made him happy. Then the moment was gone and he looked sad again, probably realizing that this memory wasn’t worth much since the only other person who should remember it too, didn’t anymore.
Tony raised an amused eyebrow and looked up at Steve, who ruffled through his hair and then sat down next to Tony, keeping a respectful distance.
He grumbled and sat up to look over the back of the sofa to see what had woken him, coming face to face with a wide grinning Peter.
Hell, his parents were dead. There was no chance for him to do
He was in
He really should begin to think things through more thoroughly.
was just rich coming from
Now it was Tony’s turn to laugh slightly, actually able to picture that. Steve grinned at him when he saw him laughing. ”You weren’t, in fact,” Steve continued, now also looking at the coffee table. ”But right there was a black velvet box, open with the gold band inside. So of course, I ran over to look at it and you were running after me, all but tackling me to the ground still in your apron, telling me that I saw nothing.”
(See the end of the chapter for
”No, I —”
”Will you read my nighty night story again today?”
Tony leaned back in his chair, feeling like he now saw everything in a different light and angle than before. ”Isn’t he a bit young to be reading?”
Tony nodded, feeling like he was in shock. ”Yes. I — yeah.”
Tony groaned and raised his glass to his lips, it was definitely neither his first nor his last drink for this night. Because it sucked, all of it. He was alone in his big house and all he could think of was
Until he remembered who he had been before he hadn’t been himself. Until he knew again who he was without the help of Steve Rogers.
”Darling, like I said.” Tony tried to cross his arms over his chest, realizing too late that he couldn’t move his right one and ended up in some weird half hug with only his left arm, that he then just played off as if it was exactly what he wanted to do. ”No. I’m always careful with these things. Condoms and all.”
”He is sick now, Pete. Remember, he was in the hospital?” Rogers was so patient while Tony was about ready to get up and wait till the kid grew up and got enough common sense to put the pieces together himself.
”Do you two need a room together, king’s bed, mirror above it? Can be arranged.”
Doubt filled Tony. He needed Steve to know just what he walked into once more because he couldn’t go through this again
Rhodey began to smile too, showing Tony all his teeth and for the first time Tony
Tony couldn’t help but smile a little and then reaching for the cup - which in fact stood on the little table next to him - while trying not to whine in pain. Hell, Bruce could’ve at least put him on the good drugs.
Steve stopped talking for a few seconds in which the silence threatened to suffocate Tony, who yet had to see his holograms and Jarvis having anything to do with anything; so he just cocked his head and waited for Steve to finish his speech.
She gave him a smile that made him want to count the pictures again.
”How long we’ve been a thing? 7 years you said?”
Steve nodded, seeming really crushed about it all. Tony suppressed that hint of compassion that threatened to bloom inside of him.
Nobody, not Howard, no bullies, and especially no reporters could tell him what to eat and when. Hell, they didn’t even think of it, which made it ever so easy for Tony to focus on his food intake rather than that he’s about to skip another grade, as if his fellow students weren’t already centuries older; or that his father was pressuring him with far too much work for a company for
Steve only raised an eyebrow at him and then shot him a stern glare. ”One more word and that was the last you’ve seen of him.”
”It’s not that easy, kid.”
He didn’t want to be alone with SR. He didn’t even want to be near him. He was still convinced that this guy couldn’t be real.
Because the sad truth was, that Steve looked like he believed it, alright.He looked devastated, as if he had no problem picturing Tony cheating on him like that.
Bucky didn’t sound rude or harsh, more like he just wanted to protect his best friend without causing further damage. Joke’s on him though, Tony doubted that anything could make him feel worse than he had those past few weeks.
“It worked, huh? You got one hell of a smile, much better than the one you tried to convince me that you were fine with.”
close. Her green eyes sparkled, she seemed relaxed and comfortable but there wasn’t her little not-smile going on. She just looked him up and down as if in thought and then slapped Clint’s hand away from where he was trying to steal a piece of her pizza, without as much as breaking eye contact.
He had never actually seen an adult with one of his prosthetics as it was a fairly new project. It had worked well on children so Stark Industries began to build some for everybody. He felt happy about that too, now. The man had his left hand wrapped around a cup of coffee, so it seemed to work just fine.
And Tony really was okay, most of the time. And yes, that was a plain lie.
He chose to ignore this dawning and went to the door instead to pick up Steve on time.
Tony actually
That was a wedding ring on his finger.
is absolutely, totally, without any doubt,
In that moment Tony thought that he could actually see why he had married that man.
Fear was not like being startled but worse. Well, it was in some way, but the second Tony took the head piece off and looked around he was weighted down by it all. He practically fell out of his chair and mustered the work shop as if he’d never seen it before.
”Holy

would anyone share this feeling, instead of keeping all of it to himself?
All of your comments to the last chapter were so nice, I'm still smiling about them! I'm sorry I didn't answer, I'm really running on like 0 free time right now, but please know that I appreciated them all.
”I don’t know what to tell you, Buck,” he heard Steve say, sounding panicked and spooked. ”One second we were eating breakfast and the next he passed out.”
“Don’t say that, it’s not true. You are you, period. There is no real or fake you, there is just
Yes, he might not deserve this life and had cheated his way in. But man, he was ready to fight anybody who’d come and try to take it from him, now.
“And what will happen to you?”
“Hey, I am more of a gentleman then any of y’all living here.” Sam smirked back teasingly, seemingly not realizing just
”Hey! I do the dinosaur voices just right,”
”It’s okay,” he said, not really knowing what to do.
expression. He just looked bewildered and really, really done with Tony.
instead of lying around and hating everything, especially myself. You’re the first thing I think of in the morning, and the last thing on my mind as I close my eyes at night. You are the only thing I don’t just
Steve lived in a little apartment complex just outside of the center of the city. Tony looked around and made sure he locked his car, twice.
Tony shook his head,
"I know that you don’t care about me, okay. But you are the love of my life and I look at you and see him and then you open your mouth and — ”
He just saw the weird angle, the blood on his fingers and how much time had passed since he last ate, but there was no other indicator. It was as if his whole body was on standby mode and Tony really didn’t care. Anything was better than feeling the constant aching pain deep inside of him. If his only way out of this suffering was not to feel at all, than yeah okay.
”Watch it!” He exclaimed, trying to stop Peter from walking around on his crotch. Tony was focused from keeping Peter from hurting him, but he swore he could hear a low chuckle from Steve’s end of the couch.
. It was a nightmare on earth, but he had been him. He had made his decisions, he was awake and in control and he had been there.
”I didn’t buy anything!” Bucky defended himself, an amused smile on his lips. ”I made us leave in a hurry before doing something you’d kick my ass for.”
, so why should Tony care what he’d think of him. He’d
Steve hummed and turned around, throwing a piece of egg to Lucky, who swallowed it whole.
the others lived with him after all, but he didn’t have anyone who he really trusted but Rhodes, who suffered through enough as it was. But Bruce was familiar, he hadn’t turned on Tony and it was just so comforting to know that at least one person in this tower was a true friend.
Even though he couldn’t really place where this memory was taking him in the matter of finding himself.
”You really are an asshole.”
Tony shrugged it off, but Steve shook his head determined. ”You really aren’t. But —” Steve swallowed, looking at Tony like he wanted to make sure that Tony’d stay to listen to every word. ”But you’re my husband. At least for me you are. And I know right now you’d do about anything, lash out and try to hurt people, but please.”
And also Tony knew that in his fridge was nothing but a very questionable slice of cheese, a half jar of pickles, a crumpled mustard tube, and a mysterious Tupperware container. So why even try to find something he had no urge to eat anyway.
The “I’m fine” came as easy to Tony's lips as his screams when he woke up every night.
He had no doubt that Steve would come and find him later.
They ate while talking in easy chatter, Peter mostly talking about what he wanted his spider to do, even though both Tony and Steve agreed to draw a line at laser shooting eyes.
Steve threw away the paper towels and settled back on the table and began to cut the pork on Peter’s plate into little pieces. ”Married life is fun,” he deadpanned, before tapping on the tip of Peter’s nose. The kid screwed up his nose and then took the fork out of his father’s hand, eating messily.
”Yeah, yeah, don’t pop a blood vessel I get it, genius, remember?” He added before Rogers could. ”So I gave my sperm and your sister got our baby?”
deep and there was no help, and all he could think of was that he was still getting worse. Soon his skin will be so transparent that it’d be obvious to everybody just how
He then reached out, taking Peter out of his uncle's arms and putting him on his chair.
Rhodey stuck to a silent answer, just shaking his head like he was just barely holding back from shaking Tony.
He would make this boy happy and even if it cost him everything.
Steve reached across the table, lying his hand on Tony’s forearm, for the first time his sad expression had a hint of relief in it. It could be happiness, but there was this knit in his eyebrows, that Tony knew to read as the devastation that it was.
He stopped it though, when Steve shot him a look that nearly made Tony jump up and clean, too.
of love
Steve laid his head back, following Bucky into the kitchen, Tony walking right behind him, not quite as successful from keeping himself from laughing as he had been before. ”Bucky —” Steve sighed, filling another glass with water and gave it to Tony without asking.
“You’re not blacking out on me, are you?” Clint walked a few steps closer but kept his respectful distance, not coming too close to Tony.
”Look, Daddy! I drew a doggy on your arm!”
If asked, Tony couldn’t have said what the story had been about. Nothing. He didn’t know a word of it.
”No, actually,” Tony sounded so distant, even he himself was impressed by just how good he could act this cold, as if his heart wasn’t shatter into yet more pieces, ”Sometimes team mates don’t tell each other things. Like how they really feel, who killed their parents, y’know, it’s fun.”
either, so why were the others allowed to not care for him, but he himself wasn’t? He just ate half an apple today — even though Bruce now supervised anything he did and took blood samples every other
Tony clicked with his tongue and snapped his head back up to get back to the heavy eye contact they always seemed to have. ”Does this mean that you know you’re not that good in bed or —? You look just fine, give off the right energy, but who knows. What is it? Coming too early? Only one who ever finishes? Wait, are you like really small?”
Tony shrugged and then they just stared at each other again.
Then again being sad really began to make him question his sanity. He didn’t want to leave his bed, he cried a lot, he wished he could call Steve but couldn’t and he just felt tired all the time.
“You — Tony, you are
“You looked like a broken man.”
looked back up and then got up slowly, walking closer to Tony, expression open and determined. ”I was born on the July 4th, 1984.”

leaned closer to his father, holding his balance on one of his broad shoulders. ”Uncle Bucky is right outside of the door, with Uncle Sam. Can you stay with Bucky and tell Sam to get Uncle Rhoy to come in here, immediately, with a doctor?”
Peter looked a little less annoyed, but still placed the plate in the washer louder than strictly necessary.
Also he had definitely touched Steve in way more intimate places more often than his past — future self cared to count. He could touch this man’s shoulder without crossing too many boundaries.
Anything.
Bruce stood in the middle of the doorway, while Clint leaned against the doorframe. Both looked super tired, as if they hadn’t slept since Tony was placed here, but why
Sometimes, when he wasn’t panicking about this, he felt like he couldn’t thank his past self enough for the family he had gotten him.
Tony began to like this look really much.
But he won’t have this forever. Because even when he knew he felt it, there was no way of making Steve believe it. But then again it was

Steve smiled at him in a downright heartbreaking way, ”Bucky made me feel like I was back home and I was so blinded by the feeling, that I didn’t see that the only home I have, the only home I
Busted.
Tony shook his head and wrapped up his plans for the new arm; he couldn’t focus anymore anyway. He walked slowly to his coffee machine, rubbing his temples and tried hard to not think about anything anymore, it just distracted him too much.
And now well, that was a motivation to all but rip his eyes open, clenching them together again instantly when the sun light hit him.

but he didn’t have the energy to

“You need a break, Tony. I’ll bring you to your bedroom, okay?”
”Daddy, we don’t stand up before everybody finished eating!” Peter exclaimed, pushing his spoon back in his bowl roughly, spilling milk over.
After he was finished he just looked miserable, and Tony couldn’t help himself but feel the empathy he had tried to suppress ever since Steve had entered the lab. Despite his best efforts, it grew and grew and there it was: making him want to hug the other man, but also shout at him forever, for throwing their whole relationship away just like that, as if it meant nothing to him.
”Ugh, fuck,” Tony muttered, when the kid’s spilled apple juice reached his side of the table before Rogers could clean it up.
Peter frowned at that, kicking his legs impatiently under the table. ”Not fair.”
He had given everyone the chance to open their eyes and see that he wasn’t the best fit for this life and nobody had, so now he’d take it.
Steve’ face pulled into that expression that definitely meant that he was about to say something sappy, but before he could, Peter interrupted him, obviously bored.
Tony didn’t want to learn that, though. He still had the little hope that he’d just wake up tomorrow and be 27 again, Rogers and child not in his life.
”Is that what you picture to get off? Me getting fucked and still begging? I don’t want to ruin your fantasy, but
Tony tried to hold on to the warmth in Steve’s voice, something that has always given him more comfort than he was willing to admit. He nodded again, even though he wanted to yell. Wanted to tell Steve that the last thing he needed was sleep, because he couldn’t remember the last time when sleep had actually brought him peace.
Because it was true. He is, was, and always had been totally prepared to give Steve everything he needed to be happy.
up a little. The tension in the room doubled without any effort.
He could feel Steve’s eyes on him, could see how he looked at him with his best impersonation of a fish out of water, until he apparently got his thoughts back in order and just nodded a few times before speaking up again.
The only reason Tony’s jaw didn’t hit the floor, hell,
“Think we can work through that?”
, because everything before that hadn’t really been Candyland either. But that might be the key moment when his life went from shitty to even shittier; when he went from bad to worse and everything just became darker than it had been before.
Tony smiled slightly at him, nodded another time, knowing very well that he’d break the promise the second Steve left his room.

He felt as if he needed to call his suit instantly to defend himself, just in case Steve decided to
just how badly he fucked up. He was very well aware of it, thank you very much, he didn’t need anybody to yell at him.
“Most definitively not.” He deadpanned and turned his bottle in his hands.
Rhodes turned to him and shook his head, looking in no way surprised. “Just stick to the cards, man.”
”Romanov,” he said her name slowly, let it hang in the air between them for a bit, “If you don’t have anything to say about your new uniform, then get the hell out of my workshop.”
Bottom-line in any case, he couldn’t let anyone come too close to him. Any of his relationships was doomed to fail, exhibit A was this whole thing right here.
Tony didn’t want to think too hard about why that might be.
The man just pulled up one corner of his mouth and then nodded down, bringing Tony’s attention to the dog tags on his neck.
Steve gave him a teary smile. ”Sorry,” he said, wiping over his eyes. ”I don’t mean to make this uncomfortable for you, it’s just —” He ended his sentence with an open gesture that had no meaning at all, but gave Tony the feeling as if he understood.
thin he was under the sweaters and plaid shirts he never seemed to take off nowadays. Tony let his eyes close, his teeth clench and his breath stuck in his lung. She knew. Of course she did. He could feel even more panic raising in him, his heart beating fast inside his chest - still or yet again he couldn’t tell. All he knew was that he’d been found out.

Or maybe he should, but couldn’t?
He aimed for the most casual tone the next time he saw Rogers, which was way earlier than he’d have liked, unsurprisingly. He had to live with them, his
I hope you have a nice day!
”Okay, damn,” Tony said, annoyance clear in his voice, even if he didn’t want it. He wanted his emotions just as hidden because what Rogers could do, he could do twice as good. He was sure of it. He had to smile for cameras ever since he was 5 fucking years old, he could convince a stranger that he didn’t feel utterly annoyed by his misery.
Tony leaned against the counter next to Steve, looking at his profile. ”What was the last thing we built together?”
Tony wanted to yell at him to knock it off but got interrupted by the door opening slowly.
How he actually fell into a relationship with Steve was a mystery to him, but he could feel the warm happiness bobble inside of him whenever he thought about it.
Tony stopped and just opened his mouth a little bit in disbelieve. ”In the what now?”
was making things complicated ?
Maybe that made it sadder, even. Because Tony had actually really just wanted to try. He wanted to do something good.
“Jarvis? Is somebody upstairs right now?” Tony had struggled with it. Problems he would never admit to the others - it would only worry them and they’d see it as invitation to mother hen him — but he was scared. There was no other word to describe it then. He was downright, deep in his bones, afraid of being alone in the common rooms of the tower. He has too much struggle to tell what was real and what wasn’t as it was right now, and he didn’t want to risk it.
meet. No matter how hard he would try, he could never live up to it.
He didn’t want to analyse the fact that it was totally because he had hated himself for anything he did, before. But now he had a purpose. He had plans about doing good things. And he was insulted when people thought he was the biggest asshole on earth.
Yeah, he would be the first one to admit that he had dropped the ball on this one.
This kid would grow up to hate Tony and have like major daddy issues and the only one who seemed to realise that right now was he himself.

Tony looked him up and down. He was handsome, yes, but not so much so, that Tony could imagine to giving up his party life and settle down with him.
Tony ripped his eyes open, staring at the wall opposite to his bed.

It took him a few minutes to look back at Tony, with bright eyes. “Daddy?” He asked, a grin spreading on his little face.
College was weird. So many people,
Rogers didn’t take the tags, though. He just stared at them and back up at Tony as if he was just trying to unsee something and failing completely. His posture, though, was as studied as you could imagine from a
This blank began to fill, though. Every night his nightmares started the same way.

And he could totally live with that, he just felt the urge to prove to himself that he could do what he wanted to do. This wasn’t an illness, this was just him being reckless, and he needed to show himself that because he felt that little seed of doubt in the back of his head, shouting at him that he should search for Bruce and tell him that something is incredibly wrong. It was just so surreal, he was
Steve’s smile looked easy, like he was born with it on his lips. Tony crumpled tiredly.
He didn’t shake Steve’s hand off, it felt heavy and warm and gave Tony a thing to hold onto that he needed so much right now.
Steve looked at him, as if he didn’t know, didn’t understand that Tony would move the stars for him, should he ask.
He didn’t feel so forced to just magically be good at Dad stuff, because he was good at that. And Peter looked so happy, that for a second Tony really thought he could do it.
Tony didn’t really know how to act now. Being halfway his playboy self, but also totally not and with the few bits and pieces he had gotten back, he didn’t know anything anymore.
“Steve, I’m tired,” Tony sighed, suddenly feeling as if there wasn’t enough oxygen for both of them in his room.
Peter looked at him again, his eyes turning glassy. Tony was about to run out of the room right then. Rogers got up to his feet, picking the child up and holding him against his chest.
Tony bit hard on his bottom lip, until he tasted blood, but maybe that’s good. It would cover how pale his lips were, a fact he strongly ignored whenever he faced a mirror.
Tony had to actually keep himself from laughing sarcastically.
Tony cut himself off when Rhodey shoved his feet from his lab, laughing.
The kid raised his eyebrows at him, looking for a second as if Tony had lost his mind. The irony of that didn’t escape Tony. ”But my bed time is soon! We don’t have time to —” he put his little hand up to his chin, thinking for a second. ”Waste! We don’t have any time to waste, Daddy!”
Mostly, though, he was just really confused. Because he had no idea how to let go of the kid again. He was so giggly and happy and Tony just stared down to him and for the first time in his life , he got why people even had children.
Tony tensed up, clenching his teeth; how
While he read his way into the schematics of the toy spider, though, his mind always wandered back to the one thing he knew. The one memory he had gotten back.
”Mr. Stark?” The doctor said, coming closer and extending his arm. ”I am Dr. Harwich. You were in an accident, do you remember that?”
“You’re not Bucky.” Steve stood up from his desk, his hands smudged with traces of colored pens, which he got all over his blond hair when he ran his hand through it.
Tony pulled his shoulders up and tried to cringe away from the sound of the child on his chest, who immediately began to
When he woke up, the feeling was still there, making it so real.
he had never thought he’d want or have.
His hair was messy and his eyes glassy but still on full alert.
Tony shook his head about himself right after this thought, he couldn’t believe he was a father of the kid as well.
Tony scoffed mockingly.
He had never felt more alone in his life.
”Divorce papers,” Rogers explained and hell, he might look mostly horrified, but his eyes were swimming in so much sadness that Tony wondered how he could even contain all of it.
to answer to all the heavy stuff that Steve said so easily.
Rhodey sighed and just continued to look down at Tony, like he was ready to pull him out of whatever misery he had driven himself into, with his own two hands.
. ”He was sleeping in your arms, maybe half a year old. He was clenching a spider blanket to him.”
His hand began to shake even more when the food was 3 inches away from his mouth, his whole body was shivering too badly to blame the cold and Tony couldn’t help but clenched his teeth together so harshly that his jaw made a cracking sound. Come
Tony had no doubt, Rogers’s voice didn’t leave any room for it. He sounded determined and honest, in a way too heavy an answer for a supposed joke. ”Jesus, it was a joke, Rogers, lose that righteous frown.”
He needed air, the walls were so close from a second to the next, capturing him. He felt if he didn’t run now, he’d never get the chance again.
The logical part of his brain knew that this wasn’t possible and he didn’t have to fear for the others to see the black hole inside of him, but he couldn’t shake the constant need to
Before he could tell that to the kid, though, the door opened and a tall blonde man came in, eyes tired with dark circles around them, but a smile so bright on his lips that Tony was about to close his eyes again.
I finally graduated and now have a lot more time to write thus here I am with a new chapter. I also finally found a Beta reader, so suggest thanks to you <3
”All of it,” Steve took another deep breath that seemed as if he just breathed in all the oxygen in the workshop, “The people, my friends, the smell, everything is
He was ready to try and for that he actually needed to do more than just cuddle. He guessed. He had no idea what the hell he was doing.
”Papa! I want to see Lucky,” he said excitedly, pulling his father’s sleeve, who looked down at his son like it was the first time he’s seen him.
Tony himself took over Stark industries, building prosthetics for children and adults. He would be manufacturing weapons, but Pepper, his red headed assistant who didn’t care whether he loved or hated her or did literally nothing of those two or in between for that matter, told him that he had a leak. Innocent people had died because of that.
He hummed making breakfast that morning. Rhodey looked at him with suspicion, his eyes clenched together.
Tony couldn’t help himself but picture Roger’s disappointed face. How Steve would furrow his eyebrows and clench his jaw, while his whole charisma screamed 'Why would you do that' and Tony would —
It was true. He had no idea.
Tony didn’t know if he was ready to hear it, but Rogers was already putting his brave face, uncrossing his arms and rubbed through his hair, before taking a deep breath and facing Tony full on again.
”Listen, dear, I have no idea what you want from me,” Tony bit out, trying to not feel threatened but failing. He was in some hospital, obviously injured and there was no one but a man and a kid. He tried to swallow his panic down, trying to tell himself that he was unreasonable, there was no need to be afraid right now.
Tony didn’t even dare to
Tony was not his husband anymore. He had said it himself, he wasn’t, not in any way that mattered. He was a stranger wearing his husband’s face, as if he had any right to.
”I would sign them all, if that is what you wanted. I won’t take a penny of your money, I know you are worried about it. But I promise, I will make it all easy for you, just —” Rogers broke at the last syllable and Tony really couldn’t say why he was so sure that there were many terrible things he had to see in his life, but this man crying would take the cake, for sure.
Rhodey sat up in a fast motion and turned to fix Tony with a serious glance, to which he just raised an eyebrow.
It wasn’t true. He loved Peter. Dearly so.
I've already got like 4000-5000 words for the final chapter, so you won't have to wait for the happy ending for too long. (And a tiny, little bit more angst. Really, just a biiiiit more --)
Before he could open any files, though, his hand hovered over the google icon. He actually was curious about his life. There must be a shit ton of articles about how he changed from a playboy to a family man. So much history in that.
But before he could say anything to redirect where this conversation was going — making it to go on the safe road and not drive full speed against a wall, maybe — Peter spoke up.
my drawing so much, that you came right here for more.”
He decided to let it drop and find out what it was about this guy that made him marry him later.
“My experiences.” Rhodey sounded suspicious, looking right through Tony’s agenda, but not knowing where it led exactly.
“Well, hell of a way to just Band-aid it,” he answered with a crooked grin, trying to look like nothing had changed, like this wasn’t killing him inside.
? Tony looked up in the sky once more before knocking.
Tony cleared his throat, and tried to look over this guy’s shoulder, to try to get a hint if he was in the right place.
He realised that they didn’t just have a routine when it came to the important stuff. They had a well played routine for everything and apparently
When he stood in front of about 25 reporters, he tried to understand why he still was hiding. His father had worked hard to keep it all under covers, but he was literally 8 foot deep under the surface of the earth now, he didn’t have a say in anything anymore.
”Slow down, Pete,” Rogers said softly, looking up at the man and then picked the boy up from the floor, sitting back down with him on his lap. The kid was squirming though, reaching out to Tony who was already looking for a panic button again.
He heard that sentence more often than anything else for the next few months when his parents always fought, while he looked blankly past them, too disinterested to hear what theories his mother had now.
Steve smiled wistfully, looking down at the wedding band that was still on his ring finger. Tony hadn’t even realized that he’d never taken it off but it made sense.
This means that his relationship with Steve was kind of nonexistent, if not strained. It was worse than that with Sam, but not as strained as with Natasha.
He didn’t pay much attention to anything for the next day. He was comfortable in his workshop, drinking a green smoothie to get his blood running and to hone his focus on new wings for Wilson, until every wire looked the same and his eyes weren’t able to really focus anymore.
Tony had never heard a more dry, deadpanned and done statement in his life. Yet, it was not what he wanted. Also, frankly, he was actually interested. Not in his dick, really, but what reason this marriage had. He just couldn’t see it. He was more than confused and nobody could tell him how it all came down to that.
what he meant. But Tony really didn’t.
”No,” Rogers answered slowly, grabbing Tony’s duffle bag with one arm, offering his free hand to help Tony get up. Tony pushed it out of the way and got up on his own, his side and broken arm hurting at the movement, but he was way too proud to take help. ”We’re in the Stark tower. We live in the penthouse.”
How he could go further from that, because this kid in his arms, scrunching up his nose when he stumbled over a complicated word and rolling his eyes when his Papa told him to read it again and again till he didn’t have problems with it anymore, was his kid.
There was certainly a right thing to say right now and Tony would give another decade of his life to know what it was.
“I really don’t mean to and I really tried to give this a shot, Tony, but —”
It has been a while but to make up for it, this is a really long chapter and it has a lot of fluff
Saying shit that made Tony feel warm inside as if he had any right to make him feel that way.
He studied the drawn dog on his cast instead, looking how the kid had drawn over the rims when coloring it red and golden.
Then it hit him. Connecting dots has always been his strong suit.
”No, you listen, no dog, Bucky! Bucky, you survived war, you won't die when Pete looks at you sad. — What yeah, I know you won’t die of this.”
Tony settled with his side against the backrest, never stopping facing Steve. ”Okay,” he cleared his throat, ”Okay.”
flinch when Steve spoke up, he was just really taken aback. He did such a great job in avoiding any conversation with him, that he didn’t even think about deleting Steve’s overwrite codes for the workshop.
Which was probably also why he hadn’t checked with Jarvis if somebody was awake at 5 am when he went to get coffee.
Tony walked over to the coffee pot and filled his cup, ready to make a run for it after finishing his statement, because it needed to be said, “But me not eating dinner with you all is not?”
Rogers only sighed, turning to walk to the couch rubbing over his forehead. Tony couldn’t believe that a man as big as him could look that little.
Steve nodded and then raised an eyebrow at Bucky. ”Did he cry?”
Let’s face it, he’d never stood a chance in hell anyway, and that Steve would team up with Bucky, even though he’d been together with Tony for years, shouldn’t have been a surprise. And it wasn’t really. Everybody eventually turned on him.
”I’m here to bring you home,” Rogers said, his voice had a low undertone of challenge, as if he dared Tony to tell him not to call it
”Please,” Rogers answered, the word had a weight to it that made it seem impossibly heavy and important. Tony was about to make a cheap line about begging, before biting his lip and nodding.
”I’m not surprised.” Tony took the offered blue car and took a closer look at it. It looked like a damn mini van.
What the fuck was that?

Steve smiled again and then carefully laid one hand over Tony’s on his shoulder. Tony didn’t flinch back from the touch, not knowing why and not caring either.
But he failed Steve.
He ended up laying one hand on his shoulder awkwardly.
Because whether or not it was a
When he opened his eyes after a few hours of everything but relaxing sleep he felt a bit numb. He could feel sadness pulsing though his veins, knew it was there, waiting for the moment to break out again, but he was okay right now. Emotions were nothing but brain waves, he told himself, if there is nothing to be sad about I don’t have to be sad, till I forget about it all together.
“No, you can keep that one,” Tony looked it up and down once more and then frowned, “But you can certainly go by my workshop some time soon, I got a few updates for you.”
So he had no other choice but to lay there and think about how badly he
Steve might have given him up just like that but that didn’t mean that Tony’s feelings for him just ended. Admittedly they should’ve died, but his relationship with Steve had been by far his most precious thing. He really did try, okay.
Yeah, he could be okay living like that forever. He

He instinctually laid his arms around the kid, keeping him from falling right off the couch.
He had the same little dimples as the boy, Tony realized, just a bit deeper. He also had the same excited expression, which didn’t have to be genetic but was still freaking Tony out.
He needed to hide it, somehow, until he figured out
Tony did sleep a few hours, having weird dreams about him and Rogers, outside with the kid. It was a far cry from a nightmare but it didn’t fell like it wasn't one either. It just reminded him of one thing, that he had forgotten what apparently had been the most important thing in his life. And as hard as he tried, he just couldn’t see it. That wasn’t him. He wasn’t made to care so deeply for somebody that he’d give up everything he was for them. It wasn’t what he wanted to be.
