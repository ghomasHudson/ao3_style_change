accidentally phasing the “b” out of their bromance.
He wasn't exactly sure what book he was looking for, so he just grabbed a random one off the shelf and inhaled deeply, the smell of new and old books filling his nose. With a soft smile, he hurried back to his chair.
Dean muttered something into the carpet.
His liver would forgive him, right? (He doubted it.)
Sam squinted at her. “Can you help me to my room, Sam?” She said through gritted teeth, disappointed the sasquatch hadn’t caught her drift. Sam still looked confused. Charlie pasted a wide smile on as she craned her neck to an uncomfortable looking angle towards the hallway. “Dean, can you make some food? I’m starving.” She finally sighed, defeated.
Cas tuned out the rest of the announcement over the radio in favor of looking at the darkened houses outside his window. (Who would want to listen to a PSA about running children over, anyway?) Cas wanted desperately to speak to Dean alone, but the hunter wouldn’t allow it.
“Heya,” a voice said from beneath the cover of a shadow. Dean angled himself toward it, approaching whoever it belonged to like they were a rabid animal.
Charlie snickered. "Look, his pupils are practically turning into little hearts just staring at it!" She pursed her lips and her body began to shake with stifled laughter. "That's what she-he-they said!" She let out a snort, then slapped one hand on the table as she threw her head back with an obnoxious laugh.
hey yall sorry this is a wee bit later than usual but I just spent 12 hours at the softball field and couldn’t catch a break to post. but here it is; enjoy :))
Alastair laughed. “I don’t think that sign can tell us what to do, huh, Luke?” The car sped through the deserted intersection, and Dean could see the extra dirt being kicked up behind them.
“Clothes,” Castiel said with a snap, like an epiphany had struck. “Clothes off and let’s get you warmed up, Dean.”
“I do not!” Dean huffed, dropping into his chair and crossing his arms. Sam’s other two points were convincing enough and he hated it when Sam was right.
“Whatcha working on, sunshine?” Dean asked, trying to steal a glance of Cas’ work. Cas covered the paper with a hand.
leave a comment? please?
“Is that not something that you guys say?” Cas questioned, raising an eyebrow at Dean in a challenge. Dean shifted uncomfortably under the intensity of that eyebrow.

“Uh, okay?” Dean said, treading carefully, because while Cas may be a little powered down right now, Dean wouldn’t put it past him to asphyxiate Dean with a pillow or something if Cas didn’t like his answer.
Dean sighed and grabbed Castiel’s arm, hauling him up until he was standing.
She looked up at him, liquid brown eyes blinking rapidly. “It’s so big.” He nodded in agreement. She shook her head and looked down at her bowl of oatmeal. Dean distantly thought she should be eating more, to gain strength and weight to lose in the arena. “It’s too much.”
Oh. That
Castiel shook his head and finished tying the cord around Sam’s ankle before grabbing the discarded sock that was his own gag just a few days ago.
As the opening notes to the
With a flap of wings, Cas was gone.
Castiel seemed to hesitate for a moment before he walked over to the door and closed it. He then took his pants off, and Dean looked away. He focused on the bleak outline of the ceiling instead of the beautiful man changing next to him.
Eileen was trying valiantly not to laugh by slurping some more soup as Sam collapsed back into his chair like the defeated moose-puppy hybrid he was.
“-And she’s the lady of the house, I think we should do it.” Sam took another drink of his protein shake in fake contemplation. “Come to think of it, this is Cas’ first official Christmas with us too, we might as well go all out. Besides, Charlie already brought all the ornaments and stuff, so why not?”
He got Sam into clean, relatively nice clothes and haphazardly dressed himself in his best outfit as well.
The two tributes were forced to turn around towards the crowd gathered at the train station and wave, as if they were excited to go, excited to see their families for the last time.
Alastair let out a cackle. Dean let out a chuckle to keep from punching something (or, preferably, some

“This is Dean.”

the tears came.
“Well, now I’m scared.” Sam chuckled, trying to lighten the mood. (It didn’t work.)
John looked at his songs and shrugged. “You two stay with the boy.”
He swiftly stuck his foot out in front of the man’s feet, tripping him up, before catching him and smoothly laying him down on his back so he didn’t hurt himself any more.
Cas beamed and then looked slyly at Dean. “We might as well do that again. You know, just in case the curse isn’t really broken.”
The edges of his vision suddenly started swimming (
“Dude, did you hear? Taylor dropped a new album.” Dean said, turning the radio up and singing loudly and off key.
The only piece that even remotely resembled a weapon was about three inches long and jagged on one side.

“Goodnight, Dean,” Cas said, and he pressed a kiss to Dean’s forehead.

Dean flushed. “That is not the

in the rearview mirror. “Dean, I can’t move up anymore or my legs will be squished. So deal with it.”
“‘S almost eight, Cas,” Dean said quietly, and Castiel blinked.
“Hey, whoa, calm down,” someone said, and Castiel whipped his head around wildly, looking for the origin of the voice.
Cas offered, and Charis snapped her fingers.
“Tisiphone, ready the water,” Aphrodite instructed, ignoring Cas. She pulled a basket of rose petals from seemingly nowhere and began to scatter them unceremoniously around the room, making a small circle around where Cas and Melissa stood, still hand in hand.
“Going somewhere?” Dean asked flippantly, jogging backwards in front of the man so he was facing him. The man’s nose twitched and he lengthened his stride just enough to trip Dean up.
Cas was swaying in a tight circle with Laurel to the beat, and Laurel’s hands were placed firmly on Cas’ ass.
He cut himself off when his throat closed up as he glanced over his shoulder. The sun was slanting through the slats in the blinds, and he could see the dust particles floating lazily towards the floor, their paths set by gravity.
When Dean ducked back into the car, he looked over at Cas, who was facing away from him and looking out his window. Dean turned, defeated, to his own window.
Cas glanced at him before asking Sam “What do you suggest we do until then?”
Dean just really didn’t know when to shut up, did he?
"Holy crap, did I fall asleep on your textbook?" The stranger said, looking more uncomfortable than he had the entire time Castiel had seen him. Castiel raised his eyebrows and shoulders in tandem, the sides of his lips pulling up in the slightest. "Shoot, I'm sorry, it's just studying is exhausting and I had just finished my shift at work-"
Sam looked at Dean like he had spontaneously sprouted horns. “Dude, what the hell?”
(sorry it’s so late)
Lisa shivered, pulling Dean into a hug. “Oh, Dean. Do you think he’ll-” She trailed off delicately, not wanting to put voice to the realities of daily life as an omega.
“They told the bloody police, so now we’re gonna have the cops on our ass. I don’t think we should do it.”

need to be turned into an actual prince with a crown or something.
Dean lay on his bed, staring at the water-stained ceiling above him, paralyzed by fear.
“Are you cold, Dean?” Cas asked, and before Dean could answer, Dean felt something warm around his shoulders. He looked down and realized he was wearing the angel’s trademark trench coat.
Dean's eyes widened, and Cas’ jaw dropped.
After a short scramble for clothes in which neither of the two managed to meet the other’s eyes, they reconvened with Ellen and Lisa in the same car they’d dined in the previous day.
The omegas looked at him curiously; surely they had to know what Dean and Lisa were doing there. Castiel stepped up behind Dean as the alphas began to take an interest in them, too, and started to catcall.
Cas smiled sweetly, too sweetly. "I love you, Dean. I'll always love you." Dean looked up at the angel as his eyes lit up icy blue, the telltale sign of being stabbed with an angel blade. A speck of red appeared at the front of Cas’ wrinkled white button up, and it slowly grew until he was thoroughly soaked with blood.

And now the radio was deciding to crap out? No way. Like Castiel would Grand Theft Auto his way out of Kansas in this fucking pile of junk.

Even though he was dying, Dean could make a decent joke) with black, and Dean figured he had fought hard enough.
Perhaps Castiel had a business kink he wanted to make Dean take part in, though the clothes were too casual to be anything like that.
Dean glanced at Crowley as the man let out a poorly stifled laugh. “Would you boys be interested in some drinks?”
Castiel must’ve realized Dean was back in the room, because he sucked in a breath. Dean winced and crossed his arms over his stomach, subconsciously trying to protect himself.
“Jesus fucking Christ!” Dean cried, jumping and hitting his head on the top of the truck. “Luke, what the fuck?”
Castiel could hear his smile over the phone. “‘s my name, don’t wear it out.”
Cas had decided that that was something that happened when a song was catchy. He didn’t know why, but it was annoying as
Sam heard bouncing through the hallway, a lot clearer than he had heard it when Dean was singing. Sam curiously followed the sound, and he was led to the kitchen.
“Do you want to go back to Alastair?”
“Would you mind making a list of everywhere you’ve been since you’ve been in Miami?” Dean cut in.
He kept a couple first aid kits in a hidden drawer in his closet, for all the times when John had beat him.
Blue eyes stared back at him, blinking. Why the fuck was Castiel so
Crowley checked his watch, unimpressed by John’s orders. “We have about three hours, John. We should get some sleep.”
Dean rolled his eyes, but his cheeks were painted red in the slanted sunlight from the blinds. “If you really expect me to say ‘Castiel’ everytime I want to talk to you, you are so wrong.”
Cas was tired.
Dean frowned. “What are you doing? Go inside!”
Dean pursed his lips for a second, looking meaningfully into Castiel’s eyes. Castiel stared  straight back unabashedly, losing himself in the perfect spheres of moss green studying him like he was something worth seeing.
Sam nodded absently, licking his finger to turn the page (a habit Dean had told him was really old-man like, but it saved Sam from paper cuts, okay?).
The song changed, some bells and piano notes floating through the speakers.
When they arrived at their destination (a street in town), Charlie put the car in park and turned around in her seat. “Listen, guys, I’m sorry for dragging you guys through Christmas crap the past couple of days-“ she held up a hand to silence protests from Sam and Cas “-but I really want you guys to enjoy this, okay? It’s Christmas Eve, and I hope you guys can forgive me.”

Despite what the hunter may think, everything Cas had ever done was to protect
“I don’t- I don’t see why we have to be all subservient now. What are they going to do, punish us?” He laughed, hysteric, the whirlwind stress of the day catching up with him.

Cas looked down at his plate. “I would need to sleep a couple of hours, eat, socialize and, um- feel the need for sexual release.”
“We were wondering what you managed to find on the bar? Or just on the case in general?” Cas asked, leaning over towards Dean’s side of Baby. He was practically resting his head on Dean’s shoulder, and for some reason the thought sent shivers down Dean’s spine.
Sam and Cas watched until her vibrant red hair was nowhere to be seen, then began to wander along one of the sides of the walkway.

He smirked.

"Suck it, Winchester!" Charlie said from behind Dean, so he turned around and threw himself at her, tackling her into the couch. He straddled her waist with his legs and began to tickle her mercilessly, tightening his grip on her when she began to wiggle and gasp for air.
And great, now Dean had to carry this dead weight all the way back to the car.
Castiel’s eyes went wide, and Dean was sure he’d never seen anyone convey so much emotion with their

"Shhh, Baby, don't listen to them." Dean said as he opened the driver's side door. He turned back to the other occupants in the car and rolled his eyes. "C’mon, let’s get this over with."
Dean had taken a sip of water and nearly choked. Cas smiled at Ambrosia. “We were both sent undercover with some absolute
Sam turned to face Castiel fully. “Are your parents like...rich or somethin’?” He asked, his head tilted so his hair was hanging haphazardly to one side.
“Jerk,” Sam replied automatically. Castiel watched this whole interaction feigning disinterest, though his eyes looked wildly amused. “Let me at least go grab you some ice and some bandages and some-“
“-with someone else,” Sam finished. Dean could hear the tilted head in his voice. “Why would that be a problem? You guys aren’t even together for real.”
“They just wanted to ask me some questions, is all, dear,” Charis said, laughing like Harold had just said the funniest thing in the world.
He sniffed it.
That hadn’t gone over well. The uprising, composed of omegas and sympathetic betas, who made up most of the population, had been crushed, and the Games had been instituted to remind omegas that they were lesser. That their job was to serve alphas and betas. That they shouldn’t try to rise above their station.
Christmastime was usually treated like every other holiday time. Cases during the holiday season were few and far between. Cas would sit with Sam and read in the library for a little while before sulking off when Dean left to do God knows what in his room, and Sam just sat quietly, pretending to be oblivious to the sexual tension that was so thick it would giggle in the face of a chainsaw murderer. Charlie was usually off somewhere with Dorothy enjoying their adventures, but this year was different. This year, Dorothy was in Oz and Charlie wasn't, so Sam invited her to the bunker.

close to being a growl) and crossed his arms to give them something to do other than throttling his brother. He sat down next to the angel, placing a bowl of popcorn in between his and Cas’ leg to keep a comfortable,
The tree Cas and Dean had picked out was eleven feet, seven and a half inches. The trunk was gnarled, burn marks lapping at the lower branches like tattoos. The needles had been falling off consistently since they had put it in the back of the truck, but the group had elected to ignore it. It was a beautifully ugly tree, complete with scars from troubling times, but once it had some ornaments on it, it would be breathtaking.
Dean gave Cas a high five, and a cloud of powder rose up from where their hands met. If Cas held on for a little bit longer than he needed to, Dean was the only one that noticed.
It was at the precise moment that Dean was starting to drunkenly say something about the fact that Cas had neglected to use pronouns to describe his date that Grace stumbled into the booth and pretty much onto Dean.
“Dean,” he said on a sigh, and Dean froze, because no one had ever said his name like
“Yeah, but where’s the fun in that? This is all about
Sam nodded. “Yeah. Dean, I- come back? Please?”
Dean smiled as he looked into the bag. One of the bees was smiling back at him. “Yeah, yeah I think he will.”
Cas squinted at each of them. "Who are we talking about and why would they say-"
“There’s only one bed?!”
Dean shuffled in, looking everywhere but Cas, who had just gotten out of the shower. (Even though he didn’t need it anymore, he still enjoyed doing everyday human things.) Cas looked down at his bare chest, and blushed at his current state of undress. He grabbed a blue shirt and held it up to himself.
Speaking of which, he pulled off into a parking lot of a dingy motel. He was about to cry, or crash Baby (which was unacceptable under any circumstances), or...
Dean snorted. “Nice to hear from you too, Sammy.”
"Where do we begin, Dean?"

he sang, dancing around his room as he read a book written in Enochian.
P.S. I have never been ice skating, so this was mostly my imagination. Sorry if it wasn’t quite like ice skating is in real life :p
“Mom, what the hell?” Castiel demanded, sitting up and rubbing his eyes, leaning forward in between the seats.
as he got into the back seat, laying down and groping blindly on the floor for the blanket he knew he kept there for emergencies. It was scratchy and old, but it would work well enough to block out the sunlight.

“And that’s why they call ya Lucifer, Luke,” Alastair muttered, turning into the strip mall parking lot.
He then remembered that as a human he had
would Dean be just another statistic floating down a river or lying face down in a ditch.

Sam was waiting for them to go inside first, and Dean let Castiel be their human shield to get into the kitchen.

Dean assumed the ones skimpily dressed were the omegas, and as the train slowed to a stop he began to dread what was coming next on the itinerary, according to Ellen: meeting their stylist.
"Fine, but you totally ruined my badass Regina George moment. Thanks a lot for that." Charlie huffed as she put her car in reverse and parked it back by a small clearing. Sam punched Dean on the arm, and Dean was actually surprised by the amount of force behind the punch.
Castiel looked amused at that. “I thought you said there wasn’t a book on kidnapping etiquette?”
Dean isn’t sure why, but he looked away too, bringing his gaze down to his thumbs that were twiddling restlessly on the table.
, and ‘feelings’ had never been something he was good at.
and when he colored the eyes of his drawing with a dark then light green colored pencil, Dean realized who it was.
Sam nodded and began reading the profile.
Wait.
Dean’s eyes softened with understanding. “I’m doing okay, man,” he said, dropping his hand from Cas’ chin in favor of hesitantly grabbing his hand.
“This is Dean.”
"Dean, I'm going to lose my balance if you keep doing that.” Cas said, looking at his feet sternly, as if staring at them threateningly enough would keep them from slipping.
. Charlie hummed happily in response, grabbing a large Hello Kitty duffle bag from the trunk.
“You see Cas?” Sam asked, his voice low to avoid anybody overhearing.
Dean? You can barely read, barely write-“
my spotify is wayward_sherlock, I have all the chapter songs! (it’ll kinda spoil the last few titles, but oh well *shrugs*)
The amount of pain that those few words caused should not have been possible. Dean doubled over, tears welling up, because he was
signs that someone was there, but when he didn’t see any, he started running down the long driveway, towards the road.
“Good morning,” Dean said pleasantly, holding a tray in his hands that had something on it and closing the door with his foot. Cas sat up and rubbed his eyes, and when he moved his hands, he saw that Dean was shaking with laughter.
Dean’s phone vibrated again but he ignored it.
Cas was still humming that

“Jesus H. Christ, Cas, never sneak up on a man when he’s cooking.” Dean said, slashing the air a couple times as if he were a pirate and his spatula was a sword. He turned back to slide some bacon onto Charlie’s plate. “What do you think about getting a Christmas tree?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, your plan is working so far, Charlie, so I wouldn’t doubt it.” Sam replied, sparing a glance at the other two passengers in the car. Dean sang along to the music, and even Cas hummed along to the words, looking at the elder Winchester with a small smile playing on his lips. “I think this calls for some celebratory eggnog when we get home, yeah?”
Dean looked at Baby in confusion. “But, Baby, you’re a car. It can’t be you.” Dean looked out the windshield in thought, considering the pros and cons of being soulmates with a car.
but that was such a very
“Okay,” he whispered, guiding Lisa toward her bathroom and turning the shower on before pulling her down to sit right next to the stream of water. “The noise should cover us. We can talk here.”
Cas nodded, then smiled. “After breakfast, of course.”
“I apologize, Dean, but if we really were a couple, I wouldn’t let you sit on the beach with a beautiful woman alone.” Cas said, leaning his head onto Dean’s shoulder.
When he turned back around, Dean was still smiling at him.

towards Charlie.
Sam, Dean, and Charlie all turned their heads towards Cas in tandem, like a trio of psycho kids in a horror movie.
Then he sobered up, suddenly concerned. “Are you okay? Do you need help? Are you somewhere safe? How’d you get this number?”
Below him was not a red-headed woman. Below him was a dark haired angel.

required actual drawing skills, which none of them had except Cas. Cas drew magnificently well, his pictures detailed and shaded perfectly within the small time frame the game allowed for. Cas slapped Sam’s hand in victory after Charlie groaned in frustration and dropped her forehead to the table when Dean chucked a pencil across the room and ripped an awful drawing of a dog into pieces.
“I do not sleep, Dean, Sam is right,” Cas said, and Dean shot him a look. “And the view from our balcony is gorgeous-“
“Ooookay, well, rule three is that we don’t get carried away with the

Cas frowned and looked out the window.
Cas had seen enough movies to know what happens in the backseat of a car.
“What-what school do you go to?” Castiel asked, copying what Sam was doing but keeping his eyes opened so he could see any threats.
“Who’s Alastair?”
Dean wanted to argue. He wanted to, so bad, but his mouth said “okay” as he was lifted from the fetal position and into Castiel’s surprisingly strong arms. His eyes began to close again, panic subsiding slowly, and sleep drew him back into its clutches.
don’t be afraid to leave a comment ;)
” Dean mumbled, clutching a coffee cup and wrapped in a soft grey blanket. Charlie nodded and took those games off the table.
"Charles, up and at 'em. Let's get you to bed." Dean said softly.
When Sam turned around to look at his brother, Dean frowned and looked out his window.
Castiel sighed and put down his book as he looked out the window and settled a hand under his chin. He felt vaguely like a Disney princess, and it made him feel silly, but Dean would’ve joked he

“Stay here,” Naomi instructed, leaning down from outside the car with one hand on the roof. Castiel rolled his eyes. “If I find out you left, there will be consequences.”
Cas shifted. “
Dean tried not to think about who had placed the towel, or about who could be watching him right then as he dried himself off.
“‘S nothin’,” Sam said, allowing a toothy grin to shine on his features. “You’re just the same age as Dean, ‘s all. I’m glad he’s making new friends.”
Dean turned around towards the music as he heard someone let out a whoop, and his face contorted from mild confusion to fury to pure jealousy.

Sam cried, wiping his tongue desperately as he searched the room frantically for something,
The alpha startled, and Dean immediately regretted his decision. He began to sink to his knees in defeat, fully expecting to be manhandled to the alpha’s liking, when Castiel’s eyes landed on him.
Dean sighed. Was that

“Cas?” Castiel asked, raising an eyebrow and cocking his head.
The parking lot was empty when Dean pulled in, which he found a little odd, considering it was ten o’clock on a Friday night
The pajama pants in front of them were a deep blue with little cartoon bees all over. The bees had dots coming from behind them to signify that they were flying.
Sam nodded. “That sounds more like it.”
a Disney princess, and Castiel would’ve laughed.
Dean pouted at Sam, hoping he would change his mind and sit next to Cas on the love seat (heh) and let Dean sit in his favorite recliner (it had a cup holder for his drinks).
Dean’s hands flew up to his mouth as he tried to stop himself from singing.
Dean followed her down the narrow hall until they reached the car where Lisa was staying. Dean noticed that her room wasn’t nearly as sumptuous as the one he and Castiel were staying in, and figured that his room had probably been there for the alpha. If Castiel hadn’t stepped in, Dean would be in quarters similar to Lisa.
Dean punched the stranger in the face, and the man was out cold before he even knew what hit him.
Lisa looked over her shoulder, her hair flicking water droplets into Dean’s face. “Won’t your alpha be m-“
Why was the alpha reluctant to leave Dean?
When they each said their good nights after some more singing, dancing, and whiskey (the two former coming mostly from Charlie and Dean, the latter consumed in copious amounts by the elder Winchester alone), Dean laid awake in his bed contemplating exactly

, like a prince actually, and anyone who thinks you don’t belong is out of their mind.” Cas seemed content with his pep talk, because he gave a little nod (more to himself than to Dean, it seemed), opened the passenger side door and got out.
Oh, what a sap. Dean blushed anyways.
Some crazy specific nightmare where his dad wanted to demand a ransom for the kid Dean had accidentally kidnapped because he just so happened to be the step-child of a renowned writer who had infinitely more money than Dean could even dream about?
Dean threw his arms around Cas, which was awkward since Dean’s legs were straight and Cas’ were crossed, but it was a perfect hug nevertheless.
A finger gently poked his face and Dean flinched away, hitting his head on the door. “Fuck,” he spat out, opening his eyes.
“Just tell me what you have,” Dean snapped, just about done with his brother (and this case in general).
I would just like to say that I LOVE domestic Team Free Will.
Becky had long blonde hair, and she was whipping it every which way as she told Dean a different life story for the third time since her first drink.
Castiel sat up, painfully aware of the dried jizz in his pants, but not fully comprehending why it was there. “Dean?” He asked quietly, his voice sounding like it had been put through a grater.
“You don’t even
Dean asked, dumbfounded and still recovering from his not-so-near-death experience (eating could be very dangerous). “And how did you know who Watson is?”
Her name was Becky, and
He flicked his glance over to Cas one last time, memorizing everything he could about
Dean allowed himself a moment to compose himself, and during that moment, he decided it was alright if he appreciated the pure perfection of Cas’ ass (that’s where Laurel’s hands were, after all).
“Dean, what the hell?” Sam asked as he approached his brother. “Did you really have to do that?”
Cas sniffled again, crying for a whole different reason now. “No, no, stop! That was supposed to make you feel better,” Dean said, frantically rubbing his whole hand up and down Cas’ arm in an attempt to stop the tears. “C’mon, Cas, you know I’m no good at this stuff.”
His lungs filled up with water, and he could feel it sloshing around inside his chest as he took another choking breath of liquid, throat making a small gurgling sound.
Cas looked up at Dean with bloodshot eyes, the red only serving to make the azure in his eyes pop. He took a shuddering breath.
Dean smiled at her, and she blushed, high on her cheeks. “What’s your name?”
Cas rolled his eyes and grabbed Dean’s hand, causing Dean to spazz out for a minute.
Dean sighed. “Fucking Sammy,” he whispered, before shoving Castiel out of the way so he could stand up. “Where’d he put the rope?”
“Anything to add, sunshine?”
Dean smiled, and Cas smiled back, bright and lighting up Dean’s day. The hunger in his eyes couldn’t be mistaken, though, and it was time they did something about all this unresolved sexual tension.
Dean nodded even though Sam couldn’t see him and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Okay, so?”
Dean appreciated it more than he could possibly begin to put into words.
Suddenly a hand shot up from the spectators area. “I’m his alpha!” Someone shouted, and Lisa nudged Dean with her shoulder.
As soon as Castiel closed the door, he turned the water on to disguise any sounds he would make. He gently turned the lock on the door and breathed a sigh of relief, allowing himself a moment of peace.
Dean cursed himself for killing the Cas that was laughing a few moments ago because he couldn’t wrap his head around the fact that Cas would have a date.
Dean nodded, then set down his knife and fork. “I’ll go talk to her,” he said quietly, and stood up, buttoning his jacket.
title is from the song by Poison, there is mild consensual sexual content here
also...there are only two chapters left...Christmas Eve and Christmas Day...I can try to stick to my every other day schedule and post the next chapter on Wednesday and the final chapter on Friday, or I can post them both Wednesday...let me know what you guys prefer!!
Naomi was about to say some (undoubtedly unwitty) retort when Castiel rolled the window back up.
He flinched and let out a slurred curse as a raindrop plopped on his head. Dean looked up, and suddenly the sky looked like a time lapse had taken place, the stars twirling and spinning lazily in a circle. Dean pinched his eyes closed, and when he opened them again, he got pummeled in the eye with a fat drop of water, like the sky was crying with laughter at his clumsiness.
Thank you all for every single comment, kudos, and read! You guys gave me motivation for this story, and I’m incredibly thankful to have had so much support for my first chapter fic! Love you all<3
“I need to-“ Dean started, before glancing at the window again. Gold was peeking in through the shutters now, and before long, the world would be filled with sunlight and Alastair would wake up from his drunken sleep and look for Dean and Dean wouldn’t be there and he would wonder where Dean was and then he’d get his cop buddies to start a search for him and then they’d find him and then bad, bad things would happen and -
“I’m...not sure I understand,” Cas admitted, standing up so he could face Dean better. The hunter’s face was a nice shade of pink, like he was just getting over a sunburn. The color on his chin made his freckles stand out even more, and Cas could spend millenia counting them-
Dean heard a mix between a squeak and a wheeze from behind him, and he turned around to see Castiel staring at him with wide eyes. “Dean,” Castiel breathed, blinking rapidly, and Dean felt the urge to cover up.
“It seems I am,” Cas replied, and he downed the rest of his beer. Dean won’t admit it, but he watched in pure awe at the way Cas’ Adam’s apple moved while he chugged his beer.
Sam was giving him puppy dog eyes, and Castiel almost,
Dean was not ready for this. Not at
Dean nodded and turned on his heel. “Let me know if you think of anything,” he called over his shoulder. Then he stopped in Cas’ doorway. “I think Sam is gonna give you a pop culture lesson while I’m away and he wants you to meet him in the Dean-cave.”
Dean blinked, looked up. He was on the floor, staring blankly into Castiel’s worried eyes. “I need to go,” he repeated, not quite sure how many times he had said it, but knowing all the same that it was true.
Cas nodded, although Dean was already gone.
flashed through Dean’s mind. Maybe this alpha was one of the rare good ones. Then the smile was gone, replaced with one of sadness. “I always thought you were a beta, if I’m being completely honest.”
Laurel winked as conspicuously as a woman over the age of sixty possibly could, and Cas blushed furiously.
Of all the goddamn things he could do, he
Castiel’s breath hitched, and this time Dean
Charlie bowed her legs comically, slouched her back, and brought her hands under her armpits.
thank you all for the support!! we’re almost there! <3
Damn. Castiel was
Dean sighed and leaned next to him, studying at the moon. “He’d be too wasted to drive anyways.”
That prayer came out gayer (heh) than he’d meant it to. Dean shifted his eyes to his brother and was glad he had said the prayer in his head and not out loud.
Dean coughed as he struggled to make his lungs work properly again. Castiel gently patted him on the back. Sam rolled his eyes.
Dean started, because Cas hadn’t been behind him a minute ago when he had opened his laptop, but now there he was, and he was demanding that Dean teach him how to drive.
"Whatever, I'm getting out of here." Dean said, grabbing a knife from a nearby table. “The only way to get out of a djinn dream is to kill yourself, right?” He waved the knife around animatedly, before plunging it into his stomach with a grunt, eyes closed. He was expecting to wake up in the bar they had entered earlier, but when he opened his eyes, Sam was looking at him with concern.
Ouch. Maybe she wasn’t drunk enough not to care about Dean’s lack of suave.
“What can I start you gentlemen off with today?” A man in a tuxedo similar to Dean’s asked, his unruly hair making Dean feel better about his own appearance.
Dean grinned over his shoulder and then let go of Cas’ hand, his fingers skimming over Baby’s paint as he walked around her with a childlike awe that Cas didn’t see nearly enough.
“Oh, Dean!” Lisa sobbed as soon as the door closed, and Dean caught her as her knees gave out.
Sam bristled, shaking Castiel’s hands off his head but still sitting back down on the bed with him.
He grabbed a pristine white towel from the marble counter, and almost moaned at how good it felt on his rough hands. It was the softest towel he had ever felt in his entire life, and it was warm like someone had just dried it.
Dean dropped Cas’ ever-widening gaze in favor of his shoes. He could hear Sam walking up behind them, slowly, but surely. Dean mentally stage whispered at Sam that if he
Cas blushed, the tips of his ears turning an embarrassing shade of red as he pushed off of Dean’s chest to right himself. He looked up into the hunter’s eyes, so warm and welcoming in contrast to the weather around them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel hummed in content, and was tilting his head a little bit to deepen the kiss when Dean pulled away suddenly.
Dean smiled a little bit as he got under the covers and laid on his side, facing Cas. “Just kinda...lay like this, I guess. I’ll turn my light off, you turn yours off, so it’ll be dark, and then you close your eyes and just kinda let your mind go.” Dean sat up and reached over to turn his lamp off, and suddenly the room was plunged into darkness, the only light coming from the moon through their thin curtains.
“Well, if you would respond to my texts-“ Sam started, snark dripping on his voice.
“Where did
“Sam, what makes you think we can afford this?” Dean asked, scrolling through the restaurant’s website.
“Yeah, well, they don’t know what they’re missing,” Dean said, more to himself than to Cas, but
Plus, deflecting was a Dean Winchester personality trait.
Laurel led Cas across the room to an open space next to a table clear of everything but a record player.
Dean heard a switch flip, then blinked a few times in the bright light that suddenly engulfed the room. As soon as his eyes adjusted, they widened in surprise.
Dean wasn’t quite sure what to do. He knew he was supposed to kneel, or offer himself up for sex to an alpha, and he especially didn’t want to piss off one who could keep him alive in the arena later on, but he really didn’t want to. Instead of doing something that could lead to embarrassment or nudity, Dean cleared his throat.
“Hello, Sam,” Cas said, his voice bubbling with laughter.
He hummed along to the radio as he drove effortlessly to nowhere in particular.
before he sat back up. “You and Dean are just too damn competitive for that.”
Castiel groaned as he woke up, turning his head away from the light slanting in through the open doorway. He pulled a pillow over his face and breathed in the comforting smell of Dean,
Sam sighed and sat back in his chair, sure he had met this person somewhere.
“Hmm, not bad, not bad. I like this one,” the man said, walking a circle around Lisa and nodding. Dean felt the urge to punch the man and protect Lisa from the Capitol people that reminded him of fruit flies on a rotten banana, but then the man was circling Dean with sparkling eyes. “But I like this one too.”
The next time the chorus came around, Dean made sure to non-suspiciously point at Charlie or Sam, the latter still putting his hands over his ears in an (ineffective) effort to block out Dean’s singing. Charlie just went along with it, jumping on the table with Dean and doing a jig with him, happier than Dean had seen her in a long time. Cas just stood there, his toe tapping on the floor as he watched Dean with a gaze that could only be described as tender.
“Thank you, Dean.”
i’m sorry. in advance. our Cassie baby has a smol panic attack, just a heads up. <3
yup, this is a short chapter. the next couple will be short, but don’t worry, there’s reasons
realized that the gold looked like a
“I’m Charis Parks,” the woman said, shaking both Dean and Cas’ hands in turn. “So nice to finally meet you, agents, but may I ask, what is this about?”
Dean’s mind backtracked and he replayed what his brother said. “What do you mean Cas would absolutely love fake dating me?”
Sam’s eyes widened and he shook his head. “No, he
“Cas, we gotta get up, sunshine,” Dean said, wiggling a little bit to get out from Cas’ arm, and he had no idea that frowns could be adorable until a sleepy Cas proved him wrong. “C’mon, sweetheart.”
“Spit it out, Cas,” Dean said, increasingly on guard.
Charlie clasped her hands together. “Well, I think we all know what a good Christmas tree looks like, hmm?” She ignored the fact that Cas raised his hand, like he had a question. (He did, indeed. Cas had no idea what a good Christmas tree looked like, but he supposed he would find out soon enough.) “Sam and I will look on the left side of the road, Dean, you and Cas can look on the right. Meet back here in an hour. Okay? Okay!”
“Fuck, Cas, don’t scare me like that!” Dean said from the floor.
There, on a cream colored tag hanging off of the green bow, was one word written in beautifully familiar handwriting.
“Yes, please,” Dean said under his breath, and Cas hit his arm.
“Hello, Sam,” Castiel said politely, and Sam looked him up and down before closing the door behind him.
It was cooler in the bathroom; the world outside was still in that cold phase between winter and spring, the ground still partially frozen and the rolling clouds enough to dissuade unmotivated people (see: Castiel) from going outside. There must be a window somewhere…
Cas nodded at Sam’s sudden realization. “He seemed to take particularly well to the woman we talked to at the restaurant last night. Do you think he’s with her?”
Dean only realized he was still holding the angel’s hand when the latter’s grip tightened.
Dean realized what he said before Castiel did. Dean’s cheeks turned a brilliant shade of red as he slowly backed away from Castiel. “Oh.”
“Just water will do, thanks,” Cas said, and he subtly shifted his barstool closer to Dean’s until their thighs were touching. Dean’s heart nearly jumped out of his chest, but that was just due to the fact that Ambrosia had turned back around.
“That’s an order, son!” John yelled, throwing the bottle across the room. It broke against the wall, the shattering of glass a violent sound compared to the low hum of the TV. Dean hoped the bottle was empty, because whiskey would be a bitch to get out of the carpet and glass shards were already hard enough to clean up. “You fucking kidnapped him, he’s your responsibility!”
Dean pumped his fist. “I. Hate. Shopping!” He looked at Cas (again). “You’re a lifesaver.”
“That’s not what I mean, and you know it.” Dean’s voice came out harder than he meant it to, like a mother scolding her blubbering child. He softened it a bit before continuing. “Where’d you go, Cas? Where’d the djinn take you? Because no offense, but you look like shit.”
there will be a second fic to this series 😁
“See ya later, Castiel,” Sam threw over his shoulder before he slipped out the door.
Dean hadn’t looked at him like Castiel, the fallen angel, the angel who had killed thousands, the angel who fell in love with a human. Dean had looked at him like
Dean had an internal struggle that had him looking constipated for a moment before he flipped Sam the bird.
Four minutes and fifty three seconds later, Dean and Cas stepped onto the ice, both with death grips on their walkers.
not the one who won't even try something new, Dean-o." Charlie pointed out as a kid no older than seven stepped onto the ice. "Look at that little dude over there. He's skating with a walker thing, but at least he's
that’s right y’all, my beta and I have made the decision:
Once he was done, Dean sat back on his ass and sighed. He knuckled the sleep out of his eyes -and some…
Melissa seemed to understand, because she offered them both a wave and slipped out of the room.
just as he had suspected, John’s snoring was audible over the loud humming of the television.
Sam laughed. He had the nerve to
Just as Castiel was opening his textbook, a whirlwind sat down across from him. He looked up to see a man about his age with a lopsided grin pasted on his face, green eyes shimmering at Castiel. Castiel felt his cheeks growing warm, and immediately stumbled to his feet to grab another textbo-well, to get out of making small talk with a beautiful stranger he had never seen before. (Castiel was not known for his social skills; in fact, he was known for his lack thereof.)
Hey guys, wayward_sherlock here :) apologizes for the late chapter, this week has been crazy. this fic should be updated weekly(ish). enjoy!
Sam shook his head. “I don’t know man, I guess it’ll just hit you.” Charlie snickered.
Was that...jealousy he was feeling? It couldn’t be.
Yeah, well, this is one of my favorites so far. So please enjoy:))
"I'll paint you, Dean." Dean tried to ignore the fact that the way Cas said his name sent shivers down his spine. Dean nodded, taking a nervous step back, before turning to find the paint.
“Our reservation should be under Barnes,” Dean said, slipping his phone back into his pocket, and the man typed on a keyboard (even the way he typed pissed Dean off).
“Speaking of which,” Lisa was getting her tenacious spirit back after the initial shock of the reaping, “We need a plan. Let’s head to my room and talk.”
He woke John up and led him, unresisting, out into the street. Sam followed, face pale and drawn.
Castiel fumbled for words, his hand burning hot on Dean’s shoulder. “I - I mean - not like that, I just -“
“I already finished my Christmas shopping, so most of this stuff can be from you, ‘kay?” Charlie whispered to Dean as they approached the Impala.
"Dean made chocolate chip, Andes mint, peanut butter, and sugar cookies, and he's making bisco-" Cas squinted at Dean's phone "-bisco...cheetos?"
we’re almost to the end!! you guys are amazing for sticking with this fic for this long!! <3
Castiel ignored him, fumbling with the latch on the window. Cold was radiating off of the glass, and all Castiel had on was his dress slacks, dress shoes, and his bandages from the night before.
Good thing too, ‘cause if John was right, Dean was dumber than a box of rocks and wasn’t going to go anywhere in life anyways.
bad days he considers just-
Dean and Castiel have a very… interesting… situation
“District twelve, I give you your tributes for the seventy fifth Hunger Games!” Ellen said, the fearful cheer in her voice the only thing giving away that she, too, was a victim of the Games.
“It’s all right, Dean,” Cas said softly once they got comfortable, Cas laying on his back and Dean curled up into his side, legs tangled together like they had done this before.
Cas’ eyelids fluttered closed in response to Dean weaving his fingers through a particularly sensitive patch of hair and he murmured “You look lovely when you sleep. So at ease.”
"Oh shut up, Sam, just keep your balance!" Charlie called over her shoulder at the abnormally large man who was gripping the side of the ice skating rink with knuckles that matched the color of the ice.
, the bunker's own game and movie room. As he walked through the threshold, about to say something about how dark it was in the room, he was hit in the face with something.
Castiel stayed against the wall. “Or somethin’. My dad’s a writer and my mom’s an executive at a law firm.”
He looked up when Dean approached, and when Dean sat down on the corner of the bed, Cas sat up until all that was covering his more human parts were the white sheets and his underwear.
“Hmm?”
Was Castiel in lo-
The woman looked at the pictures, before she sighed. “I’ve seen ‘em, don’t remember where though.”
John settled back down into the couch, apparently done with the conversation, as he turned the volume on the TV up to an unreasonable level.
, out of all the omegas in Eden that Dean was going to be one of the ones to get reaped.
Sam sighed, done with the obliviousness. “You look great, Dean.”
It was all Sam’s fault.
Oh, and they were right by the window, so they had a beautiful view of the sunset on the ocean.
that’s all, folks.
Cas squinted at Sam. “The love of their li-“
His face needed to be in tip-top shape for Cas, anyways. (Maybe they’d actually get their clothes off this time!)
The thing was ancient. Its A/C was one wrong speed bump away from blasting air hotter than Satan’s asshole on a summer’s day, it’s engine sounded like a grandpa about to hack up a lung, and from the outside, it was such an ugly yellow color that it looked like a banana on the verge of going bad.
“No. I refuse.”
Dean mumbled, and something like defiance flashed in those eyes before Castiel turned forward and focused on walking up the two creaky steps that led up to an even creakier wrap-around porch.
Dean barely refrained from grabbing the gun that was digging into his lower back when he reached for his wallet in his back pocket. This kid had no idea who he was dealing with. (Besides, Dean wasn’t
Sam whimpered quietly, and Castiel gritted his teeth to keep from becoming
Cas nodded. “She used an ancient Greek memory spell on me, and tried to drown Dean.”
“Okay, lady, I’ve put up with a lot of bullshit in my day, but that’s one step too far over the line,” Dean interrupted before either Cas or the Melissa girl could reply. “First of all, my friend Cas here is an angel of the Lord, and therefore a wavelength of celestial intent, and
And rang some more.
Crowley waltzed into the room with his arms full of empty bottles. “Forty five minutes to midnight, John,” he said pleasantly, dropping the bottles into a trash can and then wiping his hands together as if he had just completed a horribly dirty job. “Let’s get going, boys.”
Dean turned to her, confused. “How did you kno-“
Dean sighed, and planted a kiss on the top of Cas’ head as the same old couple from earlier passed by them, hand in hand. “I know you’re lying, Cas,” Dean murmured, and Cas turned his head into Dean’s chest. “I was just trying to get some information, you don’t need to worry, I wouldn’t fake cheat on you.”
“I think murdering your friends is not a viable option, Dean.” Cas said, just the slightest hint of sarcasm painting his voice. Dean turned around in surprise, staring slack-jawed at the angel for a minute before regaining his composure and smirking.
“Hmm?”
The train doors began to close, and the last face Dean saw before he was trapped in his impending doom was the stoic face of his father, watching with a thousand yard stare.
Cas hummed in response, and Dean could feel the vibrations through Cas’ chest.
Dean laid back down, facing Cas, and pulled the blankets up to his chin. He closed his eyes.
"Charles!" Dean barked from outside a dressing room curtain. "I'm not getting any younger out here!"
Dean was no angel, though. And he did have dreams of Cas making those sounds.
“Goodnight, Cas,” Dean whispered, and even though every instinct was telling him to
Gabriel waved the house phone -a phone Castiel hadn’t even known they still
“Dean, it’s me,” Sam said, and Dean opened one eye to get a look at his brother. “Cas knocked you out, tied me up, and ran.”
He twisted his hand to try to cut the rope binding his hands together, but there was a chance that,
Sam sniffled and walked forward, his arms falling to his sides and revealing what he had been trying to hide.
. That didn’t sound any better.
Castiel heard John snort. “Our guest, my ass. You fucking kidnapped the guy, he ain’t no guest, boy.”
Alastair snorted and turned towards Dean. “Get in the car, let’s go get your ride.”
distance between them.
The mall was two stories tall, shops lining either side of the open walkway. There were vendors in the middle of the walkway, selling toys and electronics to passersby. And the
“Aha!” Sam said, pointing at a page in the book. Dean and Cas looked at him expectantly. “It says here that a witch can cast a spell that whenever the person it is casted upon or their soulmate begins to sing, the other will pick up where they left off.”
“We never know when someone could be watching, Dean,” Cas whispered, and he glanced up to the camera on the ceiling of the elevator.
Dean toppled off the bed, onto Cas, and smashed their lips together, all with a huge grin on his face.
And now Dean was gone, taking Cas’ heart with him, leaving him with a gaping hole in his chest.
Dean’s cheeks flushed red, and he coughed forcefully. “Yeah, well, it reminds me of us, right? A little mangled, broken here and there, but still growing strong.” Cas beamed at the tree, and Dean couldn’t help but notice how adorable his angel looked.
“I can’t believe I’ve been outed,” Dean chuckled, and he paused for a moment before apparently deciding to place a light kiss on the top of Cas’ head. Cas could hear Dean’s heartbeat increase with the proximity and could feel his own heartbeat thumping in his chest.
Somehow, as indigo started bleeding into the sky, Dean ended up laying down in the front seat with his head on Cas’ lap, staring up at the angel’s face as he drove.
“So you want us to copy their schedules?” Dean asked, turning the TV off and getting up.
Charlie sighed dreamily when he sauntered back over to her, his knuckles white from clutching the velvety string of his bag. “Dean, Cas is going to love them!”
Castiel looked over at Dean sheepishly, a knowing look glinting in his eye. “Well, you better get used to it.”
Damn, Cas was a good actor. Dean was going to have to remember to give him some kudos when they got out of this bar.
Castiel must be really scared to be shivering like that.
Dean gasped, then immediately averted his eyes to his own project when Cas looked over at him.
also: Sorry is amazing :))
Cas looked down at his hands. “A dating app,” he glanced up and when he saw Dean was staring at him like he just sprouted another head, he looked away again. “I-I promise I was careful. I didn’t use my real name or anything, I mean obviously, but you know what I-“
look like
Cas looked at what Sam was holding in his hands. “Yeah, I think he will, but you said-“
It was only a matter of time before Dean found out who he had matched with, anyway. Might as well let him do it on his own.
. “It looks like a damn dog, Charlie! I don’t care what you say!” He yelled back, banging a fist on the table. Cas and Sam exchanged a glance.
(See the end of the chapter for
It made him feel sick.
First of all, thank each and every one of you for all the kudos and comments! You guys have made finals bearable:)
Charlie leaned back and belly laughed, her chest vibrating as her laughs echoed through the tree surrounding them. "Okay, okay." She wiped a tear from her eye. "We should probably
with another hunter.”
“Well, funny story-“
“What is it?” Dean whipped his head around, but all he could see outside the windows was pitch black and the two cylinders of light in front reaching out into the dark.
The woman smiled in contemplation. “I think I’d like that.”
Maybe he
Eew. It tasted like backwash.
“Castiel? Who are you talking to?”
Sam pointed the phone towards the bunker ceiling and Dean heard some badly-stifled laughter from the other end. “Damn it, Sammy, this isn’t funny!”
Cas blushed, and Dean seemed to shake himself out of...whatever
Dean scoffed. “Like some dumbass monster is gonna be watching the security feed.”
The mug stayed in one piece, and Castiel’s knuckles hurt from where he had banged them on the floor.
He was paying for it now.
Dean tried to hide a smile and failed miserably. “Still less of a mouthful than your real name,
Cas loved nature.
"Sam! Merry Christmas!" The woman hugged Sam tightly, speaking directly into his chest, as he was a full foot taller than her.
he was. Normally, pretty was something he would use to describe girls, but
Sam groaned. "Seriously, Charlie, what are you, in middle school?" Dean just laughed and gave her a high five.
He really liked Dean, too. It was more than just lust (though, the kinda-not-really-sex that they had had earlier was flat out
Dean was cut off from his rant rather rudely when Tisiphone shoved a white hand towel into his mouth. “The mouth on this one,” she sighed, before motioning for Aphrodite to continue.
huge thanks again to my fantasmagorical beta, IAmSorry__sendmeaprompt. you are wonderful and I love you!! <33
“What was the name of the person you matched with?”
Cas smirked, and took a bite of a fry. “I have my ways.”
Sam sang suddenly. He just about fainted.
of all people in the kitchen." Dean turned to Cas. "No offense, man." Cas shrugged.
"Oh shush, Cas, you guys'll be fine. Sam and I are just gonna put up some lights outside, so if anything catches on fire or explodes, we'll be right here." Charlie said, edging towards the kitchen door. She didn’t have to say
Sam popped the trunk to find some frivolous wrapping paper staring back at him. "Charlie, you really just had to spring for the most obnoxious wrapping paper you could find, didn't you?"
This was so wrong.
Sam nodded, and gave a little salute, before he seemed to remember something. “Hey, Dean, as I was saying before, what’s going on with yo-“
Cas nodded, his head moving up and down like he was a bobble head.
“I’ll try a muffin, Cas. What’s on here, a glaze?” Sam questioned as he grabbed a muffin and studied it. “Whatever it is, I’m sure it’s delicious.”
Cas leaned towards Dean to whisper in his ear at the same time Dean leaned towards Cas to whisper in his ear.
Dean was saved from trying to respond when there was a rapping at the door and Ellen poked her head in, eyeing them carefully. “Are you two decent?” she asked and, upon receiving two sheepish nods, continued with “We’re about to enter the Capitol. It’s time to get up!”
"Dean! That's perfect! You should totally get it for him!"
“What did you find,
“I do hope you’ve learned your lesson,” Aphrodite said, snapping her fingers.
Sam shook his head. “My brother’s an emotionally constipated idiot, but are you sure he heard you?”
“Can you cross-reference the cause of death with the myrtle and the rose petals? Maybe it doesn’t have anything to do with the people they left the bar with,” Dean suggested, and Sam rolled his eyes.
“I burnt the first batch,” she explained, placing the steaming bowl in front of Sam. “But I got the second batch just right.”
She pulled a piece of paper out of the pile and studied it, before looking up to the ceiling in thought.
when she saw Dean and Cas talking.
Not for Dean. The Games were never

He glanced at the phone one more time before he realized he had missed a bullet point.
(Dean had groaned, Sam had laughed, and Cas had squinted at each of them in turn because he “didn’t understand that reference.”)
Luke smirked. “What about Dean-o and Sammy?”
Castiel looked around at the empty kitchen.
Dean shuffled through the kitchen, wincing as Castiel kicked some old take-out boxes out of his way.
The woman smiled at Dean and suddenly he understood. “A girl’s gotta eat. And if that hubbie you have yourself wasn’t so intimidating, I’d ask if you were interested in my services.” She leaned forward and placed a hand on Dean’s knee.
and you know it.” Charlie said.
A melody played out when the door closed behind them. It sounded like a couple of tinkling bells, and it floated on the air for a moment before a woman’s head popped out from a door in the back.
As soon as Laurel had said something about dancing and then made cougar eyes at Cas, Dean had gotten up and taken off for the bathroom.
thank you all for the support <3 it means more than you know
She unfolded it, and everyone in the square held their breath.
just sounds like an awful game, does nobody remember what happened the first time Eve was given an apple?” Cas continued, and Charlie put her hand up.
“Hey, man?” Dean said over the bar, and the bartender turned. “Make it three shots.”
It was only a matter of
Dean clenched a fist next to his leg, where his friends couldn’t see. “Yeah, asshat, you’ve spent enough time in the garage to know that that’s the only reason my old man keeps me around.”
taking Baby, though. I don’t want her to get scratched.” Charlie nodded enthusiastically while swallowing her pancake.
“I’m his alpha,” he repeated, breathless, and Dean blinked at him, stunned. He glanced at Lisa and realized she shared his expression.
His phone started ringing, blasting out
“Dean,” he replied, barely a word caught on the breeze, but Castiel must have caught it.
“Dean, we have to go,” Sam said, bouncing from one foot to the other anxiously. “Like, now.”
Sam sighed as he wrapped the string of a sweatshirt hoodie around his pointer finger. “It’s a Christmas thing, man. People buy multiple gifts for the love of their lives to show how much they appreciate them.” Sam stopped, and looked at Cas with wide eyes as all the color drained from his face.
“Yes, exactly. And we need to present a united front, too. Our competitors are less likely to try to pick us off in the arena if they know we’re gonna be taking care of each other.” Dean hoped so, at least. If it had been alphas in the Games, they would try to take down a loyal group as fast as possible, but he was hoping that his fellow omegas weren’t quite that foolhardy.
"I think we have to face our fears, Sammy." Dean said quietly, before turning to Cas.
Dean nodded and turned on the radio. Some random song came on and Dean winced. “If this is the moment I meet my soulmate, I do
to get the taste out of his mouth.
One side of Dean’s mouth pulled up as he looked at Cas before settling back against the head of the bed, allowing Cas his position back. “There are some times, like right now for instance, when everyone needs to be held,” Dean explained, rubbing his thumb up and down Cas’ bicep, sending shivers through his body. “I just enjoy being held most of the time. Makes up for when I was a kid.”
After
About halfway through his book, Castiel's eyes began to hurt. Staring at the plain black and white of the textbook was growing exceedingly monotonous, and he was just about to turn through his book for a diagram, that one he needed for cla-
Dean sighed audibly from outside. “You were smooth before, but that was just disgusting.”
The lunch was a splendid spread of all sorts of foods Dean had only ever dreamed about, on golden plates, with crystal goblets. If the train was this luxurious, what must the Capitol be like? Dean poked at something that appeared to be a pickled quail egg, wondering if the turmoil in his stomach would allow him to eat.
before. Ever. So this was going to be interesting.
; any time Castiel saw Dean’s green eyes, his smattering of freckles, his, quite frankly,
Dean suddenly was met with the memory of Cas, curled up in a ball, mumbling something to himself as Dean grabbed him a shirt.
Dean pressed his lips into a thin line before climbing on top of Castiel again, and Castiel whimpered.”And you know that if I let you go, you won’t get far. The only way I can protect Sam is by doing what that
Lisa nodded. “How do we do that?” Dean glanced around the room, then leaned forward to whisper in her ear. “I think if we turn all the lights off, anything recording will glow red. My dad told me that once, after he- well. Anyway.” And with that, he stood up and shut off the lights. The room was pitch black.
