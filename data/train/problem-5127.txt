Dean grins. Time to get this party started.
“Move, move—“
Castiel swallows. He had seen something, that much was true. A flash of gold behind Dean, as he stood before him in that old building.
“And I like her.”
“Do you really think that?” Dean asks quietly.
“Yes.”
Whatever home he might have found on the trail, Dean knows he’ll never be happy without his brother by his side. Despite their differences and the strange stilted relationship they’ve had in past few years, they’re family. Dean doesn’t leave family behind.
Time phases out of his awareness. There's only Dean. Castiel clutches at his arms, his shoulders, his head—Dean’s soft hair beneath his hand, all twisted up in his fingers. Castiel presses back against the bed beneath him, letting out a soft sound every time Dean rocks his hips forward, lighting him up from the inside out, sending fire through his veins.
Their instructor, an overly cheery man named Garth, waves from his board.
Dean grits his teeth, wheeling back around and grabbing his glass.
“And I’m sure you don’t want Emmanuel to hear about this,” Dean says lowly. “Hear he makes a pretty picture when he’s mad. Gets mighty righteous.”
“The Marshal has been assigned by the governor to personally track down Emmanuel, citing his excellent history of service and record with violent outlaws. He is to bring the outlaw to the county seat, dead or alive.”
Anna looks down, stunned.
“Alright, come on. Out to the garden with you. Leave the dancing behind for a little while.”
“Anna,” Dean whispers. “What—”
Joshua’s voice is the same as he remembers it, soft and gentle. He had been like a second father to Castiel, taking care of him when his real father slipped out during the night, when he disappeared for weeks—returning with scratches on his arms and a deadness in his eyes.
His gaze wanders over the shop, over the other various quiet patrons sipping their own coffee or reading, and then to the bulletin board near the door. The poster of Castiel’s cat is front and center, slightly wrinkled and faded from age, but the proclamation and the rules beneath it are unchanged as ever. Dean scowls again, and turns away.
Then the heat shoots through him. A slow burning pain that doesn’t affect his physical body, no—but it eats at his grace, a dark atmosphere of hate and evil that instinctively makes him want to curl up into a ball, to flash away in a blaze of wings.
The next thing he knows, the world is upside down.
“Tease,” Dean murmurs back.
Dean doesn’t hesitate. He jumps, landing on a few unfortunate citizens who got too close. One tries to do something about it, but Castiel decks him with a single punch. He holds out his hand, and Dean grasps it, Castiel pulling him up.
“Go to hell,” she snarls.
“I’m sorry,” she says. “He’s not usually like this.”
"Small no name town in the south of Colorado," Dean says. He places his hand down and tosses a couple bills into the pot. "Nowhere, you might say."
It’s like his skin is cracking, black spiderweb like marks running up his wrists and digging into his veins—
“Please forgive me,” he whispers. “I just hope you can forgive me.”
He was trying to see a way out, but with every passing day, with every report of another unexplained disaster, of another string of crazy deaths, Castiel felt his spine tighten another notch.
,” he begs. “Cas—
“Well, Sheriff.” Emmanuel turns, eyes flashing dangerously. “Thought I’d take that bet.”
“Gadreel? That’s a mouthful.”
Gabriel eyes him suspiciously.
Sam looks over the crumpled bills in his hands, then tucks them away, looking around. Ruby claimed Teller County wasn’t a huge draw for thieves and the like, but you could never be too careful.
Castiel sucks in a breath.
Sam unfolds the bottom of the page, two words printed in dark bold.
“What?” She says challengingly. “You don’t think I can?”
Cat spends most evenings with Dean now. It’s always the same. Dean leaves the back door open, and the cat will come and go as he pleases. He’ll keep Dean company in the greenhouse, in the front of the store, or as he does chores around the house. Dean finds himself talking more and more freely to the cat, about everything and nothing. He doesn’t really have too many friends outside of Charlie, who already knows everything about him, and Sam—who Dean loves, but barely sees, since he lives so far away. More than once, Dean decides he’s crazy that his best confidante is now furry and four-legged, even voicing this opinion aloud to Cat. Cat always answers him with a consoling meow and purrs, bumping Dean’s hand for an ear scratch.
Because he’s tired. Castiel’s so damn tired. Of the apocalypse, of this life, of everyday waking up and knowing it could be the last morning he ever sees. And the only things keeping him sane—Dean, and Anna, they were slowly pulling away from him, they felt farther and farther with each day, and Castiel didn’t have excuses anymore. Excuses for the irrational anger he felt building, always simmering underneath his skin, a constant reminder—the anger that scared him to death, because he didn’t know what would happen if it ever got the better of him.
“Where is Anna Remington?”
The door opens behind him.
Dean looks back at the menu, nodding hard.
Eileen looks up from her book, peering across the patio and to the hotel doors.
Dean grins.
“I love you,” he says. “Oh god, I love you, too.”
That gets his attention. The sheriff suddenly faces Castiel, sputtering in furious shock.
“No idea. Folks talking about it being Clay Allison and his gang. I don’t believe it.” Elkins snorts pompously, drawing out a pipe from his pocket. “But ain’t nobody left alive who saw it, ‘cept them Chinese, but that don’t do no good.”
“Still,” Sam says scathingly. “Would have been nice to know.”
“I had expected better of you,” she says, her voice trembling.
As the feast began, Dean had been lively, practically leaping from the table every time a new guest was announced and ushered through the doors. But as soon as Dean saw the new arrival, his face would fall, quick as the blow of a sword.
Anna spreads her hands.
“It’s not that, it’s—“
He nods gravely.
Dean can almost hear him, rough and sharp in his head.
“Of course, Red,” he says, winking at her.
Dean swallows. He turns back to the stitches, his fingers shaking a little.
“You shouldn’t even really be hunting anymore.”
What is he talking about?
Eileen, noooooooo!
He doesn’t know who he’s praying to. God, Sam...even—
“Good luck out there, Sheriff,” Anna says. She turns her horse’s head off to a sloping trail, leading up into the hills, starting off at a slow walk. With one last glance back, Gabriel follows.
“Do it again.”
Dean continues to glare, but after a moment, extends his arms, holding his hands out. The outlaw takes Dean's arm, surprisingly gentle, and unlocks the cuffs, tucking them away in his pocket. Dean briefly entertains the idea of throwing a punch and trying to escape, then discards it. He’s too damn tired.
“Not yet, anyway.”
“It’s hard to fly through the woods,” she says, almost to herself. “The trees are too thick.” She glances over her shoulder. “Now that we’re human, they’ll find me soon.”
The two of them bring the dishes to the table, and they all dig in, their friends happily talking and joking around them as they fill up their plates. Dean ends up opposite Cas, and he can’t help but drink in his fill, sneaking glances at him when he’s not looking, engrossed in conversation with Alicia on his right. But despite Dean's newfound lightness, it's undercut with a creeping melancholy.
Castiel trails off helplessly. The principal is merely staring at him.
“It’s a—a spell. You can’t—you have to go—”
Gabriel turns, so his back is to Dean, and glares at both them, making a rather rude gesture with his left hand.
Dean quiets, those eyes on him again. Castiel draws in a shuddering breath.
He quickly slices down his arm, and Dean immediately freaks.
“Don’t do that dewy eyes thing again. I nearly burst out laughing last time.”
“Well, I guess that means it’s not a mistake,” Dean snickers.
The light fades, and Dean relaxes, his shoulders settling. Castiel realizes his mouth is open and quickly closes it.
“Unless it's not scheduled,” Emmanuel says. His cool eyes track the coach's trail, a gloved hand pushing back his long black coat, resting on his pistol.
"Soon, all will be as it should be," she says softly. "You will return to Heaven. Anna will be ours. And Castiel will be dead."
“Charlie Bradbury, you are
“Look,” Castiel says, through his teeth. “The people I kill deserve their vengeance. The law ain’t doing the job, and God sure as hell isn’t, either. You think those fancy lawmen want the word to get out that an outlaw’s been doin’ it for them?”
“FYI, still can help with that—”
Castiel sits up, trying to drag him back in.
“This is goddamn different,” Dean says stubbornly, squeezing his eyes shut.
“No,” he answers quietly.
“Dean,” Charlie says, swinging her hand and spilling half of her champagne. Alicia rolls her eyes, grabbing Charlie’s arm and supporting it over her shoulders. “I need him for pictures.”
“Oh. Yes.” Castiel shifts. “He….comes and goes as he pleases.”
Dean points a finger at all of them, sounding ridiculously like a scolding mother.
Castiel holds his breath.
He's going to deny it until his dying day, because Charlie would never let him hear the end of it—but she's right. That basically over the past few weeks Dean's practice sessions had devolved to him mooning over the guy next door.
“So you think that’s the solution? Keep on going behind his back?”
Then his eyes fall back to the lakeside, and he sees Castiel.
Every lie slips from her lips smooth as silk, pure as poison.
Sam shakes his head, bringing the damp rag up to his face again. He inspects the damage in a small looking glass that’s sitting on the desk. His nose has stopped bleeding, but there’s a large bruise purpling under his left eye.
But instead of feeling faint, he feels…invigorated.
“Cas.”
“Dean—“
Anna and Gabe whip around, staring at him. Dean’s mouth drops open.
also, thank you so much for being so patient. This chapter made me want to rip my hair out and chuck my laptop out the window.
Dean hits hard stone, stumbling as he lands, his hands coming down hard to break the fall. There’s a moment where it’s quiet, where everything’s frozen—
Cas misinterprets Dean’s expression, continuing.
Anna stares at him for a moment, but then she nods, dropping her gaze.
He hunches over, gasping for breath.
“What’s wrong? Did the spell not work?”
Dean will stay just long enough to attend the funeral, but then he’ll be gone, the flutter of his wings echoing around them, one last time.
Cat stops for a moment, just looking at him—then darts forward, rubbing its head briefly against Dean’s hand.
warnings: past character death
“Try opening your eyes this time,” Castiel says, wading closer. “The water’s perfectly clear, you’ll see.”
Castiel beckons Dean back towards his workspace, and this—oh. This is what Dean was expecting.
Anna disarms a few with two quick shots, before jumping down from her horse, knocking them out cold. Gabriel grabs the end of the driver’s shotgun, hitting another square in the nose—yanking the gun from his hands. He pulls the man to his knees, puts the rifle to his neck, and essentially pulls the man into a headlock with the barrel of his own gun. It's all over in a matter of seconds.
“Really?”
Dean silently moves up next to him, watching the rapture on Castiel’s face.
Castiel wrenches the car back in between the yellow lines, panting.
“I mean, um. I’ll uh, tell him what you said.”
Castiel shakes himself, pulling his gaze from the water, turning back to Dean.
nice.”
Then Dean shakes his head.
The water is pleasantly cool, a relief against his heated skin. He's up to his waist, yet it feels like a soothing bath, calming him. The clear light washes over them like a sheet of silver, the lake the purest glass, droplets of water hanging like diamonds on Castiel’s skin, shining in the moonlight.
Castiel quickly shakes his head.
,” he rushes out. “He’s been telling that story for years, but it
Dean grabs his hand, shaking his head.
But the damage is done. The others have already disappeared with Dean—vanished into thin air. Castiel whirls, but he sees nothing.
Dean frowns.
<no, no problem
“Sam?” he whispers. “Charlie?”
Gabe jumps up, beckoning to the other two.
“All you’ve done is lied,” he seethes, hissing in her face. “You lied, and your angel lied, and now? I’m going home.”
With an almighty crash, their blades meet, dark choking black against poisonous white.
He cannot seem to shake his strange encounter all day. He’s restless, fidgeting through his lessons with Bobby, distracted during the midday meal with his brother.
They both fall silent, mutely staring at the table in front of them. When Anna speaks again, her voice is cautious.
“I don’t know.”
Castiel can barely contain his triumphant smirk, Dean’s cheeks flushed to an inviting shade of red.
"Will you?
Dean stands and Sam follows him out to the porch, just as Garth reaches them, huffing and out of breath.
Sam is struggling to sit up, his face tightening in pain.
“Shit,” he breathes.
“No, no,
He breaks the loose grip on his wrists and starts to sit up, pushing at Dean's shoulders.
So he just does it. Castiel’s hands find Dean's face and he kisses him, pressing their lips together with a sudden fierceness—and for all his hesitant words before, Dean doesn’t hold back now. He lets out a soft noise and falls into the kiss, wrapping his arms around Castiel. He moves gently, opening up under Castiel’s touch, but not letting him take control—never pushing too hard, never too fast. If anything, it’s infuriating—always pulling back just when Castiel wants more.
They're here. They're finally here.
He walks past Dean, inclining his head.
“Stay out of this.”
“You always say that joke and it’s never funny.”
He slides his hand across to the other side of the bed, finding it cold and empty.
Dean stares at him, not comprehending.
He runs his hands through his hair, taking a deep breath in.
Castiel breathes hard, frozen under those wild eyes.
“Touchy, touchy,” it whispers.
“Any word on Eileen?” Max asks, leaning back in his chair.
Her hand freezes on the doorknob, and she throws a glare back at him, her lips curled in a sneer.
Castiel’s mouth goes dry.
The man snarls.
Castiel reels, leaning back.
For a moment, Ketch just stares at him coldly. Then his face splits into a sly smile, his eyes cruel and calculating.
He flusters, his mind utterly blank.
“You know…I didn’t want to believe it.”
“Cas―”
The inn has been cleared out of everyone, except Emmanuel’s inner circle. Ellen stands in front of the bar, filling glasses as soon as they’re empty. Bobby is nursing a glass of rye in the corner, watching the room with owlish eyes. Anna throws the two brothers a murderous look as they enter, standing quickly and stalking off towards Emmanuel’s bedroom, where presumably Gabriel is still keeping watch. Dean sighs, pulling back a chair across from Bobby.
“What?” He asks indignantly. Castiel raises an eyebrow.
“Well, uh, uh—” he stutters, renewing his search vigorously. “You know—how—”
Sam kicks him under the table, and Dean snaps up.
She shells out the extra, wincing at the large sum. Boss ain’t going to be too happy with her, but he’ll just have to deal with it.
“What do you want from me?” He asks. Ruby raises an eyebrow.
“You’re him,” the woman in the middle says. “The human.”
“Get inside,” Castiel growls out, yanking his six shooter and scrambling into position to aim.
He pinwheels helplessly, shouting at the top of his lungs.
Now it’s well past noon, and they’ve gotten no closer to deciding on a plan then when they woke this morning. Dean takes his hat off, holding it loosely as he drags one hand through his hair and over his neck. His nape is raw and hot from the sun, tingling as he runs his fingers over the skin. His wrists have healed, but he keeps the linen in place to prevent the manacles from opening the wounds again.
Dean doesn’t dare to breathe. Castiel has gone deathly pale.
Dean shifts his bag, smiling.
it takes almost all of Dean’s strength to hold him down.
“Dean.”
“Now we have the wealth of choice.”
“No problem.”
Dean gawks at him, trying to figure out what the hell Cas is playing at, when he says the next words.
"Whatever."
Anna.
“Mornin’, sunshine.”
“Really?” Dean crosses his arms. “What’d she want?”
The man turns.
“Anna—“
—but he doesn’t look like much. An older man, with a scraggly beard and a crisp pristine button up shirt. But despite his appearance, Anna can feel his power, radiating off him in waves. It’s almost as if it’s calling to her.
Charlie rolls her eyes patiently, and pushes herself up to check on the oven.
He looks back at the bed.
“But―”
Pain blossoms underneath Castiel's right eye, and his head hits the floor behind him, his eye throbbing. Luke hisses in his face.
Anna stands, gripping at the pendant around her neck.
Dean lets the poster drop to the floor, turning his attention back to the Marshal.
Luke pauses, sharp eyes missing nothing.
“Even if you were human…I’d..." Castiel shrugs. "I'd rather have you here."
And as the night continues, with every disappointment, Dean grows more sullen, his words colder, his tone sharper. At this point, he’s merely going through the motions.
Dean looks shocked for a moment, his hand dropping. Then he shakes his head.
“Emmanuel!” A voice thunders.
It’s his third tattoo, since the initial one Cas inked on his chest, but he’s still not quite used to the sensation of the needle moving over his skin.
“I thought they were lying,” he rasps. “I thought my little birds were mistaken when they came and whispered in my ear.”
“Going somewhere, little brother?” Michael hisses.
“Not at all,” he says, his gaze perfect and bright. “I would much rather be with you.”
Emmanuel cuts him half his pot and they begin again. Doesn't take Dean long to catch onto the game. He's never claimed to have more smarts than the next man, but he notices things—that Meg's quick witticisms and fast bets are usually a cover for a poor hand, and while Emmanuel plays methodically and reserved—he has moments of ruthless attack where Dean is left with no money and not quite sure how it happened. They switch over to stud sometime past midnight, which Dean fares slightly better at. It's his deal, and he passes out the cards, the three of them gathering up their hands.
Castiel feels something strange as Dean’s eyes settle on him. It’s not like the frenzied strip that had preceded most of their times together. This is something altogether more intimate. More holy.
"Talk about what?"
He’s the one that initiates the kiss this time, hard, desperate, but so achingly familiar—and then finally,
Bela scrambles after her weapon, but Dean hits her, sending her flying, and she crashes into the wall. He’s there in an instant—seizing her roughly and slamming her to the floor.
He reaches out a tentative hand.
“You’re talking to a man who spends his days as a swan,” he murmurs. “What is crazy?”
Castiel clenches his newly healed hand, trying to restrain his anger.
He sees Anna’s horrified eyes flick from Naomi back to him, and Castiel can’t stand it.
Sam throws up his hands and disappears. Castiel's control on his anger snaps.
Cas freezes in his tracks.
“Cas, we might live in a church, but you’re not
Dean freezes. He fights against the flare of pain that had seared through him at the sound of his name, instead focusing on his anger. He hardens.
“Don’t make me lose you,” he whispers. “Not again.”
The sharp tug of pain in his side helps him a little, and Castiel manages to find his voice.
He holds up his hands, and walks slowly out of the tent. There’s maybe six or seven of them, a couple holding rifles. The one in the middle has one trained right on him.
“Because, we’re, um. We’re kinda, uh, d-dating.”
“Yeah, we’re really going to have to work on all that sacrilegious talk,” Dean says, tsking. Castiel whips his head around.
Castiel whirls.
He exhales slowly, then reaches towards the passenger’s seat. A strange combination to an outsider’s eyes, to be sure—a six-pack and an old leather jacket. Castiel gathers them up, his hand lingering on the sleeve. It gives softly under his hand, still shiny from the last time he cleaned it. He folds it over his arm, taking comfort in its warm weight as he walks up to the barn. He takes a deep breath, and pushes open the door.
“Did you say
“Pull up a chair, love, don’t be shy. Hat, coat, it always gets so stuffy downstairs—” She waves a hand, vaguely indicating the corner of the room. “Em, darling, glasses and bottle in that cabinet. There, you remember.”
He stops at the lip, the boundary of where Charlie’s shield protected them, his chest heaving.
The same place Morgan and his men described.
Dean laughs, but he doesn’t stop.
“And mine,” Sam adds, picking up a bottle opener and eyeing it critically. Gabriel snatches it back from him, plopping it back on the counter.
“I don’t know….three weeks seems pretty fast.”
“Love, huh?”
Sam grabs Anna’s outstretched hand and they’re gone. Bela hunches in the corner, the fiery prison reflected in her eyes.
Gabriel lifts a hand, starts ticking a list off on his fingers.
He shrugs.
Dean is gone.
“You’re angry,” Dean says softly. Castiel scoffs.
“The thorn in Heaven’s side,” he says, tightening his fingers. “The dead man who wouldn’t stay dead.”
“Benny and Desmond,” Alicia says. “Who else?”
“No.” Castiel steps closer. “Does it bother you?”
“I’m going to bed.”
He can sense his soul—it’s human, human and whole—not tainted by black or a wisp of demon smoke, but Dean wants to hurt him. He wants him to burn, he wants to watch his light explode and die, crumbling under the white-hot fury of his grace.
Because it ain't spn without baby ;)
Castiel can’t blame him. Ain’t no easy thing to lose your freedom like that. But they were running low on funds, and the man had practically dropped himself in their laps.
“Guess so.”
“Just shut it, alright!”
Castiel doesn’t return it. He doesn’t take his eyes off the road, shoving Dean’s legs off the leather. Dean sputters indignantly.
“Then your suit’s going to be ready by Friday, and we’re all set.”
“Hello, Castiel.”
,” Dean specifies, stuttering a little on the name. “He's an outlaw. It's true. But the stories, what they say about him—it ain't the full truth.”
“Still don’t understand why he’s got to meet us somewhere else,” she says, after a minute. “He’s my guardian, right? He knows where I am at all times—isn’t that part of the job description?”
“But it’s just fine for you?”
He digs out the vacuum cleaner from the closet. They have the goddawful thing for no discernible reason, as neither of them ever fucking vacuums. Castiel pops out the filter, intending to stick the ring box there.
“It was smart,” she says. Dean blinks, looking at her warily.
Castiel sees and opening and lunges for it, but drops his arm in the process—and that’s when Dean grabs him, deftly knocking him to the floor and pressing the blade against his side.
Mutely, Dean nods.
The outlaw purses his lips, but turns away without a word.
Dean exhales.
Dean gapes at him. Cas gives Charlie a wink, disappearing into the back room.
Benny scowls.
Sam stays still for a few moments more. Then he exhales, pulling back his sleeves.
Over and over again, from an abusive stepfather. A close call with a busy street. A strange man with a dark car. Then, her sudden entrance into a dangerous new life. I was conflicted when I found out, that her father was the sort of man who knew about the creatures that haunted the dark—and not only that—he hunted them. I did not wish her to be blind, but I wanted her safe. And as she got older, she was allowed on the more dangerous hunts, her family always marveling at her luck. Monsters taken out just in time, every shot, slice, stab—missing her by inches.
“Castiel isn’t around, is he?” She asks.
Anna clenches the arms of the chair, desperately praying in her head.
Dean looks at him for a moment. He doesn’t want to talk to this outlaw, he doesn’t want to know anything about him. Because if Dean does start talkin' to him, he might start understandin’ him. And that sounds like a dangerous prospect.
“We tried to play nice, Castiel.”
“With any luck, they’ll be speechless,” Charlie says.
Castiel can’t speak. Sam mistakes that for an answer, smiling softly.
“I, um. Came to return this.”
"Hey, you."
“Can you help him?” Ruby asks quietly. “Please. For me.”
Then he dives.
“And I might’ve been procrastinating, because I have
“Yup. One and only. Big man upstairs,” he says, pointing skywards.
Castiel takes a few steps forward, but Dean jerks back, dragging Sam backward, shielding him with his own body.
“We should get one to go.”
He shrugs, gesturing around.
“Cas, I—“
Balthazar wags a finger.
“What? Giving up so easily?”
"I'm gonna say something I've wanted to say to you for a very long time."
Dean looks down at the floor again, sticking his hands in his pockets. Mary sighs.
“Yeah,” Dean echoes. “Wow.”
>charlie says you go out quite frequently
Dean’s grin slides off his face.
, Anna!” Castiel shouts, slamming his hand against the wall.
“You don’t love me.”
After another exhausting half hour, they finally make it up the hill, and even though Dean’s calves are burning and he’s covered in bug bites from head to toe and sweating an undignified amount―the sight before them is amazingly beautiful.
Castiel drops his hand, glaring.
, 6:00 p.m., the empty warehouse on Washington and Pike Street,” she murmurs, snapping the briefcase shut. Castiel panics, crawling forward.
Winchester stares at him, a maddened glare that makes Castiel feel strangely smug.
Ruby’s jaw tightens almost imperceptibly. She shakes her head.
Dean reaches for Castiel's side, then pulls back, not wanting to hurt him. Last he saw Castiel, he was bleeding out in an inn miles from here. Dean wasn’t sure if he’d ever see him again.
“You. You make me happy.”
Dean’s snarl dies in his throat. His arms shake as he struggles to keep himself up, barely able to grit out his words.
“Meg,” she says, red lips curving into a smile.
But despite all his scoldings, when Dean slides a hand to his back, Castiel willingly leans in, settling into his arms and closing his eyes. Dean seems to have regained a little bit of his senses, and he runs cool fingers down his chest, his stomach, wrapping around Castiel’s still aching cock, stroking him gently. Castiel sucks in a breath and ducks his head, trembling.
“You better hurry.”
"Seriously, though, Charlie." He glances back at the store behind them, squinting a little at the starch saccharine lights. "Why are you working here?"
“Or maybe I’m getting old.” He laughs. “Millennia starting to take their toll.”
time,” Gabriel says, and Dean can practically hear him waggling his eyebrows. “And an
Dean promptly vacuums up his own food, and starts throwing shifty looks at Castiel’s. Finally he leans over and blatantly steals a chunk of potato from Castiel’s plate, popping it into his mouth.
“Why can’t I write it, or can’t you just come back to the church—“
He looks up, and Castiel meets his eyes.
There’s a soul in front of him, twisting and shrieking in pain as he lays into it, again and again and again—
Her eyes briefly flick to that endless white, then back to blue.
Castiel whips his head around so fast he’s lucky he doesn’t break something.
Dean’s already ridded himself of his shirt, struggling with his pants as Cas reaches down and pulls his t-shirt over his head, like Dean’s very own gift from god, baring his tanned skin and every inch of those beautiful tattoos.
“That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you,” Charlie says urgently. “I hurt Abaddon pretty bad, and I thought it would’ve stopped her for longer, but she recovered faster than I did—”
She leaves him a couple days later. Castiel drowns himself in a bottle of Jack Daniels and falls into bed.
He lunges forward. Castiel barely evades him, and when Gordon lashes out, Castiel brings up his blade for the counter just in time—
“Was gonna tell you—follow the breadcrumbs, all the way back home—“ it growls, low and deep. "But now—"
Dean doesn’t remember falling asleep, but he’s rudely awakened, a sharp clang against his bars.
“It is Sunday.”
Castiel crawls forward, his heart twisting in frightened panic.
Lying under that same tree months later, he looks up to the sky, taking her hand.
“Okay, what is
“He’ll have to be. Without a Daughton marriage to secure the line—“
Gabriel grins.
Sam doesn’t appear too abashed—Dean sneaks a quick peek through the slats—in fact he looks smug. The bastard.
“Yep,” Gabriel says.
Castiel pushes at Dean's knees and leans back down, settling his head in Dean’s lap.
“Cas,” Gabe breathes. “What the hell is that?”
“Of course it’s worth it."
Sam is standing in his doorway, fidgeting anxiously, fingers tugging at the edges of his new doublet.
Sam makes a slight noise under his breath, and Bela turns, watching him shrewdly.
He makes eye contact with Cas and promptly trips over the end table.
“Oh wow,” the woman says. “I’ve never heard of something like that.”
He pushes himself up, taking a few moments to steady himself before starting at a run forward, pulling his pistol. The train jerks and rattles underneath his feet, threatening to pitch him from the train—but Castiel runs low, keeping balance as he leaps the gap from the second car to the first. The engineer is oblivious to any danger, until there's a Colt .45 pressed against the back of his skull.
“Alright. That’s how you want to play this?”
Then he kisses him. He kisses him breathless, kisses and kisses him until a passing car honks, the people inside whooping. They break apart, Cas still clinging to the front of Dean’s shirt.
“You really had me going for a minute,” he mutters, wiping his eyes.
Dean holds up his hands.
“Nothing,” Dean mutters.
One last proposal.
“I don’t want to fucking see you right now.”
She lifts his chin, that smile dark and vicious.
“Don’t see you doing any better.”
“Dude. Gabe." Charlie wraps her arms around his waist, hugging him tightly. “It’s incredible.”
Most of Dean's and his family's time has been spent getting all their belongings carted in and rearranged, the three of them trying to adapt to the new castle—but his mother had been running herself ragged, trying to get her sons settled while also dealing with her new many responsibilities. Dean knows she’s been trying her hardest to make them feel at home here, in this new land, but still—Dean can’t help the gnawing feeling of dread in his stomach.
Nothing but a crater, barely more than a smoking pile of ash.
( ˘ ³˘)♥
“Oh, really?”
“Pretty words,” Eileen sneers. “I’m sure you say that to all your girlfriends.”
Cas is breathing raggedly against Dean’s cheek, just as affected as he is.
Castiel closes his eyes, combing his fingers through his hair—messily shaking it out, not caring as the wind picks up, whipping his clothes and biting into his skin.
“Fine.”
Balthazar narrows his eyes, but stays put. He watches shiftily as Castiel grabs a rag from the table, wrapping it around his forearm. Dean is still glaring.
A lie, a soft word.
He finally manages it, with difficulty. The woman watches the entire time, unimpressed, but doesn’t lift a finger to help him. Once he’s ahorse, she turns away, trotting after the other two. For a brief moment, Dean considers it. Turn his horse, and set off for the hills, see how far he can get before—
“That’s gotta be—what.” Charlie shrugs. “Third time this month?”
“Don’t ‘what’ me. Just wanna know what’s got you acting like a complete space cadet.”
Dean spins him like it's nothing, twisting Castiel’s arm and driving his own blade to press against his stomach.
Castiel gasps, trying to see him, one last time.
The passcode is no trouble, and then Ketch pulls up a certain phone number, quickly inputting it into his own phone. He types something out, quickly, then knocks back the rest of his drink.
,” Sam adds. “He looks younger.”
He chokes, gripping at her sleeve.
Cas shrugs.
She grabs her arm and places a palm on Naomi’s forehead, point of contact with the angel’s grace flaring and burning like the sun.
Dean sighs, gesturing at the mess of paper and ink in front of him.
“I think I just gave Sam ammunition to tease you for the next several years.”
“Telling
To his surprise, Butler has dismounted, and is now making a beeline back for the foothills.
Anna smiles.
Raphael leers at her. Anna curls her hands into fists, rage simmering in her blood.
“Just like always,” Anna says flatly. Gabe looks up.
Bobby avoids his eyes.
“Foolish child,” he screeches. “Give it up.”
“But you know how this ends, brother.”
“And….I guess….if you still
“So? Doesn’t mean I can’t appreciate a good dental plan.”
“See?” He says. “I know things.”
He stares at it, panting.
“Tasha,” Castiel repeats. He lays a hand on the arm of the chair, just shy of her own.
He paddles closer, gesturing exaggeratedly as he explains.
“They want to, so.”
“Amulet to hide you,” she explains hastily. “And Sam’s putting up the last of the warding. We have to make sure Dean can’t get in.”
She takes in the sight of Dean, his hands clenched over his wound. His eyes are locked on Castiel’s.
“Then promise me you won’t go looking for it.”
something about a local election, but down in the corner—
“Sorry, just―”
Sam looks at Eileen, and she nods at him. Sam smiles.
“No problem.”
"Damn,” he hears her say, watching as Cas walks carefully back to Sam, beers in hand. “I’d like to get on that.”
“He’s right though, Cas,” she says, after a moment, running a rag over the metal until it shines. “We should try and figure out what the hell he’s talking about. I don’t know about you, but I’d like to know how I’m going to save the world.”
“Before what?” He asks suspiciously.
They stand still opposite each other, neither willing to move.
Dean’s jaw clenches, his fingers digging into Castiel’s arm.
Dean frowns.
Despite himself, Dean’s impressed with Charlie’s choice of location and the whole setup. He’s all for free booze and good food, but he’s never really seen the point of weddings. Just big and expensive and half the people who get up to the altar are gonna find themselves hating each other anyway. It’s a con, really. Waste of time and money.
When he finishes, he slowly draws his hands back. Dean takes a deep breath.
Anna explains quickly, pulling her gun and popping out the cylinder, eyeing the bullets inside.
Castiel clears his throat.
“Looks like you boys’re popular,” he says. Dean huffs, pushing himself up from the ground, dusting off his breeches.
“Gabriel,” she pleads. “Gabe.”
The place where Sam had fallen is now overrun with demons, and they’re quickly fighting their way towards him. To where the altar is set up.
Cas huffs, deciding to shuck off the coat entirely.
Her voice drops low.
He hangs a right, and Anna sits up beside him, her eyes narrowed. The back of Castiel’s neck prickles.
He just grabs his shirt and pulls him in.
He shrugs, panting.
“And I have a colleague that I connected with at my last expo,” Cas says, happily, tucking the book away. “So I’m planning on going to observe her doing some traditional tattoos.”
water pressure—lathering up the shampoo. He takes a moment to indulge, massaging it into his scalp, trying to alleviate his headache. He groans, sinking his head forward to rinse.
Then they’re gone, and just like that, Bobby is out of Dean's life, leaving him. Again.
He stumbles forward, fitting an arrow to his bow.
Dean rocks up against him so sharply Castiel gasps, seizing his shoulders.
—you don’t—“
His eyes have glazed over, like he’s reciting a memorized passage of text.
Dean smiles.
The angel clasps his hands behind his back, staring him down.
He wakes up.
“Relax,” comes a low voice, right next to his ear. Dean freezes, his hands gripping his thighs.
He tightens his grip and the chain digs into Castiel’s neck, leaving him gasping.
“Uriel—wait,” Ruby chokes out. “Wait.”
just let us talk to you—“
“Goodnight," he says.
Dean can’t move.
No, really. Why is Dean here? They don’t have any leads on Alastair, there's no pressing hunt…but here Dean is, in his room, just…because?
Dean scrubs a hand over his face, a low growl of frustration in his throat.
“Ooh,” he says, wincing. “Might be sore tomorrow.”
Dean frowns, turning Chevre’s head to face them.
He swallows, breathing out slowly.
Sam, even to someone as drunk as Cas is right now.
Anna seizes the nearest one, black, wrapped in leather, and flips it open, scanning the pages.
“It’s not safe here,” he says haltingly. “There could be more demons, angels, who knows, on their way now—“
~Drumroll~ the moment you've all been waiting for!
Sam rolls his eyes at his brother, but acquiesces.
“Cas,” Dean chokes out. “Don’t—“
“Hold on,” Benny says, but his tone no longer has the sure confidence of before. “Ain't no one agreed yet.”
to die—that’s what the demons had planned all along. Open the portal, release all those twisted things—but also one of the old beings, older than time itself—and now it was walking free, amongst the humans, bent on killing them all.
“What’s that, boy?” Bobby asks distractedly, squinting at his map.
He peers at Castiel, patting him on the head.
Castiel laughs too, nudging Dean slightly with his shoulder.
Crap.
“You have caused me nothing but pain,” she hisses. “I would have let you live. But there is no room for abominations in my new world.”
Balthazar shakes his head slowly.
“You goddamn son of a bitch—”
He pulls another arrow from the quiver, his fingers brushing through the delicate feathers of the fletching.
He cuts off, pressing a hand to his face.
“You should have.”
Castiel takes a deep breath. He should tell him. Sam could probably figure out something.
—Fuck—“
“Oh! Yeah.” Dean looks around. The clock on the wall reads 11:48. Shit.
And that’s what does it.
“Oh thank god,” he says, turning at the sound of the door opening. “I was going—”
“It was a nice one.” He laughs. “You’re getting too good at this.”
His instincts have never been wrong before.
Castiel closes his eyes, processing.
Cat blinks, in a way Dean can’t help but think of as smug.
“Hey.”
Balthazar’s laughter dies as he takes in Castiel’s reaction, and his expression quickly twists into one of concern.
“You’re better than a pillow.”
“You don’t know how much I love you—“
“You think I give a damn about that?” He asks shakily. His other hand comes up to caress Castiel’s face, touching him everywhere, like he’s trying to call back distant memories, cataloguing every scar, every hair, every breath and thought.
“Who the hell are you?” He asks.
“You Daniel Elkins?” Sam asks, indicating the sign. The man opens the door a fraction wider.
Naomi clears her throat from behind them, not-so-subtly encouraging him to move it along. Sam smiles and gives Castiel a small little salute, moving away.
“If you really think you can do it.”
Dean slides his hands up Castiel’s thighs, his lips slightly parted, hot eyes fixed on Castiel’s. He slips a hand down to curve around Dean’s jaw, and he turns into the touch, lips grazing his fingers.
“That is the only type of hunting I do, sir.”
Dean’s throat goes dry. For all the money they just stole, Dean ain’t got a cent on him.
Dean flops onto his back, staring up at the starry expanse of night above him. Dinner was the last of cans of stew they’d bought off a woman in a house in the middle of the desert. The bruising on Dean's face had healed enough that she didn’t ask questions—but Dean suspects she wouldn't have anyway, 'specially after Emmanuel tipped a healthy number of coins into her palm. Now it twists queasily in Dean's stomach, threatening to make a reappearance.
, ‘as in those in a romantic relationship’,” Dean parrots back at him. “Seriously. Why?”
“Nothing.” He shrugs. “Just want to ask you a couple questions is all.”
“It's a coach,” he says.
Castiel calms himself, and looks around the corner again. He can't see Sam's face, only the tight draw of his shoulders, the blade still in his hand.
“You ain’t puttin’ that on me,” he bellows, yanking at Dean and Anna’s hands. “No damn way—”
He nearly turns away, nearly tears himself away from the power and the fear. He crumbles before it, digging his fingers into the ground, knuckles tearing against the concrete, bright red blooming forth.
“You are forgiven. Incredibly. Thank you, oh—oh my god, I can’t wait.”
Castiel looks up. Dean’s eyes are worried.
“It’s true,” he mutters. “He was here. And he was riding with Emmanuel.”
Then he sits back, wincing. He turns his head to the side, eyes closing briefly, jaw tightening.
“What the hell, Cas? I told you I didn’t want to see him—”
“Cas—“ comes the anguished cry, and Castiel nearly stumbles—but he can’t stop now, no,
“Shit, I’m sorry—“
“She’s been waiting long enough.”
“What the hell happened?” He breathes.
Later, when Cas is collapsed on top of him, dark hair tucked under his chin, the reality of everything finally hits Dean. The silver ring is cool against his heated skin, where Cas’s hand rests over his heart, a reminder that this is real, this happened, this is really happening.
Castiel laughs.
They both shrug.
Balthazar glances up, a scornful expression of confusion on his face.
“Why?”
“Oh. More woods. How different.”
His arms are shaking, and he’s gasping for breath.
Sacred.
“You got a hunter with a couple extra shots of juice—only makes our job easier.”
Dean starts ticking off statistics on his fingers.
Instead he places a hand on Castiel’s back, handing him the glass.
Sometimes they’ll both be on the couch, on opposite ends, of course—because even if Cat will let Dean pet him now, he’s never let Dean hold him—and Dean will talk about his fears, about seeing his mom when he dreams, how he’s worried he and Sam will drift apart, and that while he doesn’t mind being alone, he does worry about being lonely.
“Come on.”
“Then we’ll deal with it then,” Anna says sharply. “We’ve had enough trouble.”
He’s going to die. Here and now. With Luke Morgan’s sneering face above him.
“And you're mad if you think I'm leaving you to fight this alone.”
“Yeah?”
“Wh…what?”
“And you would have gone over into unholy territory,” she whispers.
Ketch grins, sharp and poisonous.
“We’ll never make that mistake again.”
“What do you mean, where am I?”
Castiel pulls up slightly, and Dean almost whines.
Sam grabs the girl’s wrists, pulling her off him.
Sam pauses, breathing in hard.
“While you’re at it, find someone for Cas, too,” Eileen says. “He could use some excitement in his life.”
his mind screams.
Gabriel narrows his eyes. Anna is watching them, her expression still murderous.
“What?” Dean says, shutting the cupboard. “I’m making dinner.”
He turns back to her simpering smile, and his body pulses with anger.
“I almost forgot—got something to show you.” Benny sets down the bottle of whiskey, reaching into his coat pocket. He withdraws a folded piece of paper, sliding it across the bar to Gabriel.
“You sure you want to do this?” He asks, lilting his voice in an imitation of Dean from yesterday.
“What are you doing?”
“Like what?”
Dean opens his palm, showing him a beautiful golden ring. Castiel stares down at it, unable to move. Dean takes Castiel’s hand.
The first one goes down not-so-easily, Cas wincing at the taste. But because he doesn’t do anything half-assed, he takes two more.
Dean holds his breath, realizing just how close they are in this moment. How Emmanuel moved into Dean’s space without so much as a protest from Dean, and the implicit trust in that action, that Dean—the man Emmanuel kept hostage for nearly a month—won’t shove him off this cliff, end their little dance once and for all.
She looks back at her strange shepherd, gathering her courage.
Anna squints at him. Castiel feels stupid.
Anna is choking, a dribble of blood at the corner of her mouth. She weakly covers the wound in her stomach, struggling to sit up.
“Would you fuck me if I was sober?” He whispers.
Ruby stills.
“I guess Dean can take a night off from running for his life and join us. Hope you’ve, uh…”
Alicia drapes an arm around Charlie’s shoulder, looking around at their assembled group. Sam and Eileen are talking lowly, and Dean and Cas are holding hands, whispering in each other’s ears.
Max speaks, of course, as Alicia’s best man. Alicia’s mom, Tasha, gets up too and says a few words. Gabriel even has his own chance at the mike.
“I will,” Emmanuel says quietly.
Emmanuel places his hands flat on the table, eyes narrowed.
Alastair grabs her, wrenching her away, and they spar again, blades flashing as they dance around each other, powerful blows ringing through their ears.
“Yeah, be there soon, Sammy,” Dean answered in a low voice, never taking his eyes off Castiel.
Ruby stops.
“Hi,” he says breathlessly.
“Dean, what are we doing?”
Charlie sits back, huffing. Dean crosses his arms.
He turns, heading straight for the tables set along the side of the hall. None of the guests dare approach him—but then again—Benny is no guest.
“We went to the place where Bobby said, to take care of those bodies,” the man says, shaking his head. “They were waiting for us.”
Castiel whirls, hackles raising.
Castiel is Dean’s plus one to the wedding whose invitation they never saw again.
“Anna—you don’t think—“
“Just because the rest of you would burn water,” he mumbles.
Dean looks up, biting his tongue.
“Cherry?”
Dean appears out of nowhere—he grabs Castiel's wrists and drags him in.
Castiel darts his eyes back and forth, looking for a way out. He doesn’t see one.
“I want this with you,” he says. “How long will it take you to believe it?”
Sam gives him a look, then reaches over, taking Jess’s hand.
“Who?”
Night falls, utterly and completely, a thick blanket of darkness that falls over the gardens, bringing the chill with it. Most of the crowd begin to depart, going back to the castle or leaving for the village. Yet Dean still sits melancholy, away from the others, moody and preoccupied. None dare speak to him until Benny approaches, and suggests they go hunting. Dean immediately perks up.
“You know the drill,” Mills says, ignoring Castiel’s suddenly stony expression. “Park yourself outside the restaurant. Go in when he does, see if we can’t catch him in the act.”
Castiel breathes in sharply in spite of himself, tipping his head back and baring his throat to Dean’s wandering mouth.
Ragged dark shapes rush past him, oblivious to his presence. He crawls forward, choking for breath. There’s a hazy ring of fire in front of him, someone shouting his name—
“A couple—”
“What is it?”
He takes a deep swig, swallowing quickly.
“You do know it’s incredibly poisonous?”
He knows better than to ask Cas to marry him on money night, he’s not suicidal―but the talk with Benny has emboldened him.
“Sam,” Meg finishes, standing. “See, Emmanuel’s a friend around these parts.” Her eyes dart to the door and back. “I’ll be able to find someone to lead you to his trail, no problem.”
“Don’t touch me,” he hisses.
Dean turns, explaining fast.
Dean jerks the towel away from his face, scowling at his reflection.
Castiel drops to her side and tries to haul him up, but he’s unconscious. Anna gets a hand around Dean’s waist, supporting him from the other side, and they start running, fast as they can to the exit. The smoke is thicker now, and Castiel can barely breathe—but the adrenaline spurs him on, and the three of them spill out the door, panting as they scramble away from the burning building.
“Please.”
“I ain’t never leaving this town,” he mutters.
The ivory grips catch the light, sparkling brilliantly. Dean was starting to wonder if he’d ever see it again.
She looks just like she did the day that Castiel told her monsters were real.
“It’s because it was real, Cas.”
He grins at both of them, before starting off on his prepared speech.
She looks at him, her dark body blurring slightly in the candlelight.
“Right,” he whispers, but he’s not sure if it's true.
Castiel chokes on his laugh, pressing a hand to his head.
Dean chuckles.
“You son of a bitch, you son of a bitch—”
They’re quiet for a moment.
anymore—”
“Well, howdy there, Sheriff.”
Castiel repeats the motion and Dean clutches to him, panting hard.
“So."
Charlie hikes up her skirt, waving the paper in her hand.
“I’m going to grab my laptop,” he says, standing. “And then we’ll figure this out.”
“It’ll work, yes, but—“
Dean steels himself.
“Tell me, Mr. Donley,” he continues. “Why’re they now buried in the dirt while you’re still living and breathing in front of me?”
“I run. On occasion.”
She turns, adjusting her tiara that says ‘Bride-to-be’.
“What do you suggest we do?”
But Castiel doesn’t notice.
“Okay?” She prompts again.
He straightens, glancing over to where Sam is hunched against the wall, panting for breath.
Castiel moves gracefully in his arms, his eyes just as concentrated on the crowd as they are on Dean.
He grabs Gabriel’s hand, clapping him on the arm.
Gabriel stops stuffing his face with mini lemon tarts, quirking up an eyebrow.
Castiel doesn’t let him finish. He quickly pulls away from the angel laughing hysterically in the parking lot.
“What?” Castiel asks.
Castiel smiles, rubbing the back of his neck. Anna’s laughter is infectious.
Sam smiles, and Dean speaks up.
But it didn’t matter. Bobby left anyway, paying a seedy man the last of his coins to let Dean and Sam sleep in his attic for a few weeks. The man kicked them out after four days. Despite all Dean’s protests—that he would exchange lodging for work, that they would sleep in the barn if they had to—but the man was hard and grown, and Dean was sixteen and nowhere near his match.
“Why isn’t Dean with you?”
The man outside gets impatient.
The boy’s eyes widen, and he shakes his head.
“Took off,” Gabe says. “Something Cas said, I think.”
They don’t appear.
The black cat twitches its ears.
Neither of them really want to break the embrace, indulging in this selfish moment of comfort. It’s Anna who finally slips from his arms, turning her back so he can’t see her wipe her eyes. He quickly looks away, heavily sitting down on the old couch.
Castiel seizes them, his mind in shock.
Castiel sets his lips in a thin line. The man is endlessly infuriating.
Castiel surprises him by kicking back and breaking sharply out of the hold, dropping down and pulling his ankle. Dean crashes to the floor, his back slamming into the dust. They wrestle, their free hands shoving and gripping as each tries to overpower the other.
He turns and spits into the dirt.
"Promise me you'll get out of this," Dean whispers. "Please. Just take your sister, and go. Don’t try to save me.”
He jerks his head towards Sam.
With great difficulty, Dean resists, tapping at Cas’s wrist.
"You do not know this man. I believe you are the one following me."
“You still don’t get it, do you,” she says slowly, stepping closer. “Castiel—this is
They must have been seeing something different.
“What happened?” He whispers.
“Just like that?”
Castiel whirls.
So now, as they bump shoulders on their way to the tiny shop, Dean is sweating, and it’s not because of the sweltering Kansas heat.
“Whaddya think?” He asks, his eyes twinkling.
Castiel stares at her, blinking in shock. Naomi slowly shakes her head.
Dean’s only conscious of Cas grabbing the lapels of his shirt before he’s kissing him.
“You remember this place, don’t you, Castiel?”
“Oh my god,” she groans.
Dean groans and buries his face into his pillow.
“You’re an idiot,” he mutters, closing his eyes. Dean laughs softly, leaning forward to touch Castiel’s forehead with his own. Dean's hand drifts slowly over Castiel's chest, brushing over the edges of the red scar. Castiel shivers.
“Oh good, we’re agreed,” Dean says. “Why don’t you drop me back home?”
“Sam?” Anna asks swiftly.
say he wasn’t here alone. Perhaps he is a thief, ready to lure Dean into a trap. But after a moment of debate, Dean realizes he has no other choice. He really is lost. Damn his curiosity.
“I’m sorry, Cas,” he whispers. “I wish I could be here every night to make them go away.”
He stills, breathing hard. Dean is watching him, his lips slightly parted, his gaze dark.
“Tell her to get in line."
It slowly looks down at the blade, then lifts up a hand, removing Castiel’s knife and letting it clatter to the floor.
“Don’t you
“No,” she whispers. “You’re dead. I killed you.”
“The hell you will—“
Castiel heads back to his room, Anna and Dean’s bickering following him down the hall. He drops his bag on his bed, heading over to the closet and sliding back the door. The weather's getting colder, and he has to dig for the object of his search, an old motorcycle jacket of his father’s. He shoves aside a couple shirts, an FBI suit or two, and—
Castiel doesn’t answer, he just runs. Dean appears in front of him, a hand outstretched—
“How did you find this out?” Sam asks.
trust you again.”
He unhooks his pistol from his belt, and Caleb does the same. They walk to the front door, unlocking it without so much as a backward glance. Gabriel hisses.
Then she starts off down the road, toward the few ramshackle buildings that make up the so-called town. Sam sighs, and follows.
Anna’s face has turned to stone. She’s motionless, fingers white on her gunstock.
Naomi stops, her fingers twitching.
Emmanuel turns his horse, looking at Dean for a moment, just long enough that Dean feels his heart start to beat a little faster.
“You’re an asshole,” Dean tells him.
The man’s voice is deeper than Dean expected, and his words even more so.
Dean presses harder on top of him, and Castiel arches, letting Dean push him up against the window. The sharp edge of the door handle digs into Castiel’s back, but he can’t bring himself to care.
Castiel straightens, indicating the petals.
From: Dean
She begins to pull her long red hair out of its plait, sighing. Despite her youth, she's taken to the trail remarkably well, but she definitely isn’t above complainin’ when the time comes.
“To save you.”
“C’mon, Cas,” he whispers. “C’mon.”
“Who’d have thought Las Vegas would get cold at night?”
“What are you doing?”
“No,” Abby says quickly. “I wasn’t—”
She looks Dean over, something in her grin turning feral. Dean's neck prickles.
Castiel looks at the blade in his hand. Shit. Going toe to toe with an angel.
Michael’s voice is a rasping hiss, his clicking teeth pointed and sharp. His eyes are still human—but unnaturally round, unblinking, yellow and cruel.
He lets out a slow breath.
There’s no way. She couldn’t send them to the principal’s office—Dean would take literally any other punishment.
“It’s almost like you don’t trust me,” Ruby retorts.
He follows Gabriel through a door that’s almost hanging off its hinges, pausing as they step inside, their eyes adjusting to the dim light.
Castiel’s panting, pulling so hard at his hair he thinks that if Dean were human, he’d be screaming in pain—but Dean isn’t fucking human. He’s a machine, ruthless as he yanks Castiel’s hips down closer, digging bruises into his skin as he licks him up and down, not even stopping to take a breath.
She lets out a bitter laugh, flopping down on the bed.
“Mmhmm.”
“Cas,” he gasps against his throat. “I want you so bad, I love you so much—“
They move slowly around each other, neither speaking, neither daring to make any sudden moves. Alastair inclines his head slightly.
“And you won’t sacrifice your humanity for anything,” he whispers.
“Dean, listen—whatever he told you, it’s not what you think—”
Dean swallows, meeting his eyes.
“Yeah, but
Tasha’s eyes widen, and Castiel can’t help but notice she abruptly withdraws her hand.
Abaddon pauses.
“Your—your name is Anna Grace Milton—“ Castiel stutters out. “You were born in 1987, you came to live with us when you were five—“
The machine beeps and Cas sighs, running a hand through his hair. He pulls a mug down from the cabinets and pours himself a hot steaming cup, hearing the front door slam as Max and Alicia return from the casino. Their babble of voices is joined by Eileen in the hall. Cas sighs, trying to tune them out as he pulls the milk from the fridge, ready to make his escape with his coffee, so he can sit and think, ruminate some more on Dean’s weird behavior.
“Why don’t you get us some more drinks, my friend?” Ketch claps him on the shoulder. “Thank you so much.”
There’s a great big collective sigh from Sam and Gabriel. Charlie raises an eyebrow.
“Redid the whole thing myself,” he says quietly.
“Look—will you—”
“What the hell is that?”
“Can I help you?”
“Game?” She asks, raising an eyebrow. Castiel flares.
“It is Dean, isn’t it?”
Castiel looks up, frowning.
Emmanuel laughs too, and scoops up some bills towards him.
“He said I was Charlie’s
“It wasn't your fault,” he says softly. Emmanuel's hands clench, but he still remains silent. Dean takes a deep breath.
“I’ll see you rotting back in Hell if it’s the last thing I do.”
he had missed her—
"No. No friggin' way."
“Young little thing,” Michael continues. “Easy to take in, I bet.”
“He’s with me.”
“We’re going after these sons of bitches.”
“Mmph—what’re you—”
For a moment, Cas doesn’t move. Then he wordlessly pulls something from his coat pocket.
She’s losing control, shaking in her rage as she hits him again.
“You asshole.”
Anna rushes to support him, waving off Sam.
She walks forward, heels clicking against the cool concrete.
“I like my coat,” Cas says defensively.
“Now...for you to
Dean’s suddenly struck by a fit of coughing that wracks his whole body. Castiel holds him until he stops shaking, and when he finally goes still, there’s blood on his lips.
Castiel cuts him off, his voice rising.
“Then make sure it doesn’t go on the transcript,” Dean says under his breath. But Cas is looking at him, surprised.
“Could have a lot of fun with this body,” she breathes.
Castiel sighs, his long fingers twisting together.
He glances at Castiel again, regarding him with a sort of disinterested amusement.
Dean watches her, a strange expression on his face.
Emmanuel’s eyes are open, rolling wildly in their sockets.
Dean feels his knees buckle, and it’s a miracle he manages to stay upright.
She slowly passes a palm over his skin, healing his cuts. He wordlessly lets her.
The angel is wringing his hands, his eyes squeezed shut.
Castiel swallows.
“I know.”
Dean exhales.
“It was foolish and rash. I don’t know what you’re planning now…”
Sam seizes Castiel and they disappear, just as something is blasted away, burnt to a cinder at their heels.
Castiel lowers his eyes, and takes a deep breath, evaluating.
Cas makes a herculean but ultimately failed attempt to suppress his eyeroll.
Castiel shoves back and steels himself, shakily stepping out of the darkness into the doorway. Anna and Gabriel are sitting at the kitchen table, faces tired and drawn.
“I’m a sucker for meet-cute stories,” she says, winking. Castiel frowns.
Castiel jerks up, and Anna stands too, her face pale.
She can’t feel anything anymore.
The angel shrugs.
Sam dips his head, staring at the golden liquid swirling in his glass.
“Perhaps you will,” he says, smiling up at her.
“Hey, screw you,” the guy says good-naturedly. “I just moved here and all this apartment stuff is confusing.”
“Charged with several counts of assault, theft, and murder. And perhaps the most grievous, the murder of this county’s Marshal.”
“These are fucking
“Promise, Cas,” she orders, eyes hard.
Anna’s been in to check on him. He groans, burying his face in his pillow.
Cas is growing hard too, Dean can feel him pressing insistently against the curve of his hip, but he’s making no moves besides kissing him thoroughly, narrowing the world down to the point shared between their lips.
“I still don’t believe you exist,” he says dismissively, crossing his arms. Dean merely raises an eyebrow.
Then an Italian place, just outside of Detroit. Entire meal waived, plus bonus calzones at the end.
Dean looks like he wants to say something else, but he doesn’t. Instead, he swings his legs over to the edge of the bed and gingerly stands, testing his weight before straightening. Castiel watches as he crosses to the wall. He seems a little better.
Dean whips around, nearly knocking his coffee off the counter.
“See, I’ve never actually resurrected anyone before. Wanna make sure I got everything right.”
“Oh my god,” he mutters, trying to will the blood away from his cheeks.
beets?”)—and sets about making his world-famous homemade spaghetti sauce. He’s stirring the ground beef in when there’s soft footsteps behind him.
The principal pinches the bridge of her nose, shaking her head.
Castiel’s fist slams into its nose. The demon cries out in pain—and Castiel rips it from its chair, slamming it to the ground, his vision hazed over red.
Yet, still—I remained faithful. I obeyed even as I stayed on Earth. I spoke to no one, never revealed my presence. I operated under the belief that I was protecting my charge.
“Deal.”
Castiel scrambles back, clutching the book to him, as if that could provide some measure of protection.
She stops herself, exhaling slowly.
“I’m, uh—the guy who watches the horses.”
“Ain’t that a bitch.”
“No, no, Dean, it was me—“ Castiel says, shaking his head.
But he abruptly halts, hovering just over his skin. Castiel realizes he’s waiting for his permission, and he nods, once.
“I always said swans were my favorite,” he says softly.
Dean frowns, squinting at him.
“Humans don’t live forever,” Sam says softly.
“Dean,” Castiel repeats, smiling. “Nice to finally meet you.”
Dean lets adrenaline carry him through the rest of the fight. They hit two more, and at some point Gabriel appears, his coat ripped and half his face covered in soot. He has something in his hands, something long and thin with a fuse at the end.
“I’m sorry.”
“Is it Cas?”
Sam turns to Luke, glaring down at him.
Anna clenches the amulet in her fist, motionless.
“Better ambush point,” she says. “You can see the east end of the valley from the second floor, and we’ll have the higher ground.”
“What?” Castiel says distractedly.
“C’mon,” he says, grabbing Castiel's hand.
Dean squints.
“Anybody seen Eileen?”
“Now,” he whispers. “I think I’ll watch you die.”
He scoffs, grabbing his drink.
“Key to the stables in in the blacksmith’s forge,” he mutters. “Back staircase.
Then his knees buckle. He falls against Castiel, head dropping limply to his shoulder.
She’s standing in the doorway, taking in the sight of her brother, laid out on the bed. Castiel’s hand is hanging limply above his face, where just seconds ago it had been twisting into Dean’s hair.
“You kidding? You were my best mechanic, back in the day,” Andrea says, tearing her eyes away from her computer screen. “And offer’s still open, if you want it.”
"No," she breathes. "This is not your fault. It's mine."
“Sand,” Cas says in disgust, spitting water. He sits up, wincing. “
Sam was still for a moment. Then he walked over, peering at the lines of text. Gabriel gestured.
From where Dean’s standing, however, it’s a great view. Castiel is nothing more but an outline in the shallow water, lit by moonlight. He’s up to about his waist, hiding his nakedness, staring upwards at the pale stars. Waves wash slowly against his sides, his fingers just touching the surface of the water.
“It’s...it’s because—”
Dean opens his mouth, then furiously closes it again, huffing loudly.
“They told me about you,” it hisses lowly. “Hell’s very own VIP. I should have known.”
“And an apple pie. To go. Please.”
“You had your chance, Dean,” she says softly.
“Look, you’re starting to piss me off.”
His face goes serious, and Castiel raises an eyebrow.
“Shut up,” Cas says, but he’s grinning. “I mean coming here. I know it wasn’t first on your list.”
Balthazar looks at him curiously for a moment, then laughs, setting down his glass.
The angel whirls, looking around irritably for the interruption. But when he sees her, he abruptly stills.
“I think you know,” he grits out, thumbing the catch.
“We can’t stay on Earth any longer. We’ve put it off as long as we can—“
Butler jerks back, yanking the horse to a stop. Dean shoots past him—and he curses, pulling hard on his horse’s reins. She makes an indignant sound, tossing her head, but turns, putting Butler back in Dean’s sights.
He flinches when Anna touches his shoulder.
“I’m sorry.”
Dean shoots a glance over at Castiel.
He lets go of Dean’s hand for a moment to rummage for the book in his bag, then coaxes him into looking at a few pictures. Dean has to admit, it does look pretty freakin’ awesome. It’d be way cooler to take a boat like that to get to Hawaii than this stupid plane.
Dean takes a deep breath.
“Yeah,” she says, pulling something from inside her coat. “All eight thousand.”
The room is warm and Cat is soft, and Dean allows himself to be lulled into drowsiness—letting his eyes slip closed.
Through the smoke, the fog and the pain, Castiel hears her plead.
Abadddon’s blade.
Zeke clears his throat.
“What do I know about sex? I’m a married man.”
“Come next month, I will be your king,” Dean says stiffly.
His cell buzzes with a reply. He grins.
“Aforementioned groom. My brother. Signs me up for random shit as a prank.”
“You're not serious. Nothing?”
He takes another sip, swilling the liquid around in his glass.
Castiel hums appreciatively, getting lost in the slick slide of his mouth. He fumbles for Dean’s belt, impatient now.
“Help me with these, would ya?”
Dean’s fingers tighten on his cheeks, and he takes a deep shuddering breath. Then, without warning, he looks up.
“Thanks,” he says quietly.
“No—I don’t, really," Dean says quickly, almost pleading. "We’re not very high up on the totem pole. We’re sent to watch and protect. Information comes later.”
“You’re in—“
Castiel frowns, but lets it go, and follows Dean out into the sunlight of the yard.
“Look.”
“And yet you’re so ready to believe everything else,” Emmanuel says idly.
“Your majesty,” she says, lifting her head. Her husband follows suit, murmuring his greetings. Both their voices are lilting and sharp, the accent of Daughton just different enough to be jarring.
He chews at his lip, looking around.
"Look. You stay here, keep watch, okay? I gotta give the manager the deposit."
Dean clears his throat.
He can’t help but stare at the hole the knife left in the black t-shirt. There’s no blood leaking from the wound, no sign that it fazed him at all.
He looks up, that soft smile returning.
“We already made one,” Sam mutters, just audible. Eileen smacks his arm.
Bobby huffs.
She glances back to the burly man behind the bar, matching his scowl with a teasing grin.
Dean nearly deflates in relief.
"The asswhupping her cronies gave me last time would really beg to differ, Sam."
"It was you, wasn't it?" He asks. Castiel is quiet.
They’re quiet for a moment before Castiel remembers, and he sits up abruptly, tugging at his hand.
“Hold him.”
Dean’s patient enough to answer some of his questions, the typical hunter things—of course Zeke asks about angels’ weaknesses—and Dean answers as truthfully as he can, tactfully being vague about everything else. Eventually Dean starts to shift in his seat (Anna expects it has something to do with him finishing his last burrito), and stands, politely excusing the pair of them and grabbing Anna’s arm, disappearing before Zeke has a chance to respond.
“We danced all night,” Mary says. “No one expected him to pay me any mind, stranger as I was.”
He takes in great gasping breaths, choked by the sobs, unlodged, sticking in his throat, threatening to drag him under. He sees Charlie disappear, then come back to his side, placing a hand on his back. She holds out the crumpled picture, like an offering.
“Don’t—“
He struggles to fit his arrow to bow as the owl—the man descends on him, claws open and sharp.
He turns suddenly, back to his palomino. He mounts quickly, bringing his horse’s head around, passing Dean, one last time.
He lowers the rag, letting it dangle loosely between his fingers. Ruby’s dark eyes watch him, unreadable.
“I mean, sometimes you gotta blow off some steam,” she says, completely serious. “Gabriel agrees with me. You’re wound up too tight, dude. I mean, shit—when I’m on a solo hunt—“
It stares back, unseeing.
Castiel absentmindedly fiddles with his knife, digging the tip into the wood of the table. He’s barely paying attention to what he’s doing, pressing too hard—and the wood splinters, his hand slipping and the blade clattering to the floor.
Cas replies.
“You try my patience.”
Dean gives him a sheepish grin.
Castiel gestures acidly.
Dean winces.
Castiel clenches his fists. Anna draws back slightly, watching him.
Castiel snorts.
“Um…”
“I need blood,” he snaps.
He wordlessly picks up the bag and walks out the front door, slamming it behind him.
Several heads turn at the yell—but he’s moving too fast. Dean backs up, but Bartholomew is in his space in a second, shoving him back. Benny stands quickly, but Dean holds up a hand, stopping him.
“Deal.”
Cas drapes his arm over Dean, slowly stroking over his arm as they sit there.
“C’mon, dude. You may pretend to hate him, but you laugh at his jokes as much as I do.”
She puts her hands to her ears, squeezing her eyes shut.
“You sure we’ll find something?” Sam asks.
She doesn’t respond, her breath shallow, her face pale.
Castiel doesn’t know what to say. That’s not a sensation he’s used to feeling.
After they got back, Instead of sleeping, Dean had been mostly replaying that moment outside the club, over and over in his mind. Cas’s cheeks, pinkened by the cold. There had been a lock of unruly hair just by his ear. Dean had wanted to brush it back—
She stills, eyes widening in horror.
Sam doesn’t move from where Castiel’s pushed him. His eyes are unfocused, fixed on the ground. He’s barely breathing.
Cas scowls sourly.
“I’m tracking Emmanuel, too.”
, leaving the castle every single night. You know it’s not safe, you
With one last look at the sleeping man in the bed, he disappears.
“Little bit of angel proofing,” Dean says. “Not the best, but it’ll do in a pinch.”
He rubs Dean's arm, gently curling around his wrist and taking his hand. Dean squeezes back, rubbing his thumb softly over Castiel's skin.
Dean gives a little salute, before pulling open the door to the fridge, very rudely raiding it while Zeke just gapes at him. His eyes light up, and he pulls out a couple frozen burritos from the freezer, snapping his fingers to instantly heat them up.
Dean has many ideas about what a witch’s house might look like. Castiel’s fits none of them.
Dean is fighting off the angels, taking on all three of them—his blade flashing in the dim light. It’s an incredible display of power—all four of them huge and terrible as they fight, shaking the building around them.
“It’ll be like nothing has changed. In the best possible way.”
“Well, statistically, you’re much more likely to die in a car or from just being a pedestrian than from flying on an airplane,” he says, turning the page. “The chances of a commercial plane crashing are about one in five million.”
“Ma’am,” Dean says respectfully, tipping his hat to the older woman. She glances at him, giving Dean a curt nod before her husband places an arm around her, quickly ushering her inside into the general store.
,” Castiel snarls.
Cas all but collapses on top of him, nuzzling into his neck and Dean smiles, brushing the sweaty dark hair back from Cas's forehead. His hand keeps working, stroking Dean even as he softens, until Dean’s coming too, adding to the mess on their bellies.
But then Castiel saw Dean’s reaction, and how completely flustered he was during the ride home. And Dean only gets that way when he’s confronted with something he desperately wants.
He sees Benny and Sam exchange a brief look, but thankfully, they don’t question him. Instead they murmur their assent, and then start off at a slight canter around the edge of the lake.
“Shouldn't be too hard.”
“As do I,” Sam says instantly. Benny gives them both a knowing look.
Alastair’s face flickers with a brief moment of doubt. He may be prideful, but he’s not stupid—they both could kill each other in an instant—whether by blade or power or portal. He believes in his divine mission, but his death was never part of the bargain. If they stay here, they’ll both get sucked in.
And then there's nothing to it but to wait.
“Castiel,” he says breathlessly. “Hi.”
“Ohh—oh. I see.”
“You think I know?” Dean shoots back. “We’re in the best place, I mean, he can’t really go anywhere without us knowing, if we stick right next to him—”
The golden-haired one, shorter, more wiry—Dean could beat him easy. He hasn’t shown any impressive feats of strength so far, and Dean is sure he could take him in a one-on-one fight.
Dean balks, but suddenly Castiel’s hand is around his waist, and Dean is frozen.
“An angel…could have gotten…in…”
“Be a hypocrite if I said it was.”
Dean doesn’t even lift his head. He knows it’s the jailer, standing there with that stupid look on his face, holding whatever plate of slop they’ve decided to feed him this morning.
Castiel nods, his heart leaping at having an excuse to talk to the man again.
Gabriel looks to where he’s pointing and rolls his eyes.
“To see my family,” Dean snarls, wrenching it open.
A low zipping hum rings through the air, signaling someone just walked through the front door. A handy proximity charm Sam rigged up, seeing as Dean is the sole employee of his tiny little shop, and stubbornly has no one managing the register.
“I’m sure,” she says.
He’s still for a moment, just breathing. Then he opens his eyes, looking Heavenward.
“And their fighting always seemed like flirting anyway.”
He pauses, grinning wickedly.
“What?” He shudders out.
“Sorry,” he breathes again.
And if the occasion does call for it, an easy hunt in the area, a couple of demons coming a knocking—Castiel will take care of it. But usually he decides it’s too far away to be worth the trouble, and sends one of the hunters now on his list of contacts out to take care of it. They always annoyingly enthusiastically agree.
The bed dips as Dean slides in beside him, hesitant fingers touching his cheek. Castiel can’t look at him.
Emmanuel is riding directly toward them, unmistakable, even from this distance. Gabriel and Anna watch his approach silently, Anna’s hands clenched into fists.
“Gabe, I’m...I’m so sorry—”
“Dean," he whispers.
Dean rolls his eyes.
Alastair says nothing for a moment, Alastair's pale eyes roaming over her face. Then his lip curls.
Dean shrugs.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says softly, smiling.
Zeke gets the keys in the ignition, turning up the A.C.
After a moment, Benny huffs, throwing his rag on the bar.
“Better see who it is,” he says awkwardly.
Anna lets out a nervous burst of a laugh, tugging at his collar.
“Dean.”
“Dean,” he whispers. “Is it—“
Sam looks around, and curses under his breath.
“Mother, you know I can’t stand these court girls.” He rises, holding the case.
“Anna," Emmanuel says sharply.
Cas rolls his eyes.
Dean’s fingers tighten involuntarily, and Castiel looks up, frowning. Dean's face is a storm of emotions Castiel can’t quite make out.
Then she jerks her head.
He closes one eye, taking careful aim, when Sam speaks.
“Dean,” he breathes again. He doesn’t care if its impossible, he doesn’t care if it's insanity, he just—
Dean huffs and turns over, away from the warmth of the fire and the outlaw’s judgmental eyes. Emmanuel doesn’t try to engage him in conversation again, and somewhere between breaths, Dean slips off to sleep.
“It doesn’t have to be,” Dean says, desperate.
Dean frowns.
Dean seizes his cheeks and kisses him.
“Yeah. ‘There are things even angels can’t heal.’” He laughs bitterly. “Fuckin’ pagan gods, man.”
“And?”
“You go with him.”
Charlie smiles, laying a hand on his arm.
“I’m fine, Sam, get off.”
“Do me a favor, tell those fancy folk I headed up to the inn,” Frank says.
“Just saying.”
“Em,” Dean murmurs. He reaches downward, wanting to feel him too, wanting to feel both of them sliding together. But it’s been too long, so long since he’s done this with another man, and he’s having trouble keeping his head straight.
“Follow the breadcrumbs,” he mutters. “You got a sick sense of humor, you know that?”
“Oh, get over here.”
“Okay, fine, you believe him. Good for you.” He snaps. “I’m just having a hard time getting on this…soul train you seem so eager to jump on.”
Dean yanks himself off the bed. Castiel props himself up on trembling arms, breathing hard.
“What are you talking about? Sam—“
, Cas.”
Castiel looks to Eileen. She plants her hands on the table, glaring.
Dean creeps closer, staying low and out of sight. He’s not sure why he’s being so careful—after all, he’s a free man now. But old habits die hard, and Dean suspects Meg’s inn attracts all sorts.
“Mmmm,” Cas whispers, kissing down his shoulder. “I like it when you’re all oily.”
Dean tenses up, ready to sling back whatever insult Cas manages to throw his way—but surprisingly, he doesn’t say a word. He instead turns back to Sam and Eileen, watching how they’re curled around each other, watching as Eileen giggles and leans in, pressing a kiss to Sam’s cheek.
“No…”
“That ain’t something, is it?”
“Maybe I will have to kill you after all,” he hisses.
“No,” he yells, holding his hands up. “Don’t shoot, don’t shoot—”
Castiel wants to retch. A host for an angel. Like some sort of twisted puppet.
He slips his hand beneath fabric to touch Castiel’s skin. Castiel’s breath hitches as Dean's hands brush over his side.
Anna bites her lip.
Castiel freezes.
“I just need you to look at something.”
Pam had stuck around for a while, refusing to leave, sitting in their kitchen muttering curses. Sam kept himself busy, making them both some bitter coffee that sat untouched as they waited. And waited.
He hikes up his bag on his shoulder, and pulls open the door, third one on the right—
Dean sits too, feeling Cas’s stare drilling a hole in his head. Yes, he knows that can’t very well discuss their next move with their target in earshot. Brady looks pretty engrossed with his date for now, but you never know.
Dean shares a quick look with Sam, and they almost laugh.
“Well.”
It’s the same girl from the wanted poster Ruby showed him. The girl who matches the description of every person they’ve asked from here to Creede.
Anna fishes out a key from somewhere, and the two of them pull open the great church doors, the morning sunlight flooding the altar room.
Tasha doesn’t respond, but her eyes say everything. Castiel continues.
“Got it. Don’t run away,” Dean says sharply.
“I think a little conversation is in order,” she says, in a commanding voice. “I’ll take the skinny one first. Tie him up.”
He does not move. Castiel watches this small child, innocent, unknowing, still grasping at Castiel’s hair. He has no idea.
Sam stills, hiccuping.
When Castiel doesn’t, Dean rolls his eyes.
“No, it’s just―”
Her eyes narrow.
Dean glances at him.
"Bite me."
“Well, we’ve already done like half of these,” Cas says matter-of-factly.
Zeke tosses his own cap onto the counter, huffing out a long breath.
“You put on a good face for dinner, and I’ll definitely make it up to you afterwards.”
“Well, we are.”
“A demon named Balthazar has a different theory,” he sneers. “He says Abaddon’s just using you.”
Castiel’s lost track of the time, but it has to be past midnight. Most people have paired off into their own little corners, them and Sam and Jess the few lone holdouts still on the dance floor. Benny and Andrea left some time ago, and Castiel saw Becky drag an unprotesting Ash into a shady corner about half an hour earlier. Dean’s playlist is still pumping through the Roadhouse’s sound system, and Dean twirls Castiel back and forth, the fairy lights around them turning into a beautiful distorted blur.
Sam glances over, reluctantly tearing his eyes away from the young woman he met tonight, a wonderful girl by the name of Jessica.
Sam clears his throat. Now to see if he can save his brother.
Castiel falls back onto the couch, and sets the small velvet box on the table in front of him, staring at it. Now that he has the ring, the idea of proposing feels more and more real.
“Not while I’m here, Dean of Winchester,” Castiel says softly. “I will always protect you.”
“Cas—“
The woman answers with a strange sound, and Dean responds—and then they’re off, happily babbling away in a language Castiel vaguely recognizes as Enochian.
The sheriff nods, without any questions or challenges. He heads up the path Emmanuel indicated, disappearing into the twisting valley of rock. Gabriel glances at Emmanuel.
“I rode with him.”
“Blasphemy!” Dean reproaches cheerfully.
“Just do it, Gabe,” Emmanuel says impatiently. “Besides.”
Dean thrusts inside him in one smooth motion—and Castiel cuts off with an aborted gasp, expecting it to hurt like a bitch.
“Bye, Sam. Love you.”
“Both a couple of dumbasses, huh,” he murmurs, reaching up to brush a few errant strands of hair away from Cas’s forehead. Cas huffs, rolling his eyes.
Sam starts off, with Charlie and the Banes following him, frowning and whispering.
“You wanna know when I got possessed by your stupid angel?”
“Sam, I love you, but you’re a fucking terrible actor.” He glances back at his phone. “And Charlie running off all shady, it’s almost as if―”
>One of the men staying with you. The tall one.
Dean’s hands find his face, his voice frantic.
“No, that’s—”
“You asshole.”
Dean’s blood.
She chews her lip, watching him. But her shoulders soften, and she’s nodding.
Castiel’s hand rests lightly on Dean’s shoulder, his thumb just on the inside of his arm.
“That's not a guarantee, though. What about Dean?”
“Yes,” he says. “When the moon is high. I will try my new bow.”
“He’s not—in the graveyard—either,” he pants, one hand clamped over his side.
“How is that possible—”
“Clear out, Winchester, next car or off."
“Love you, future brother-in-law,” she says, “But it’s almost midnight so….bye.”
“Fuck—I don’t know—I really don’t know.”
Dean slows. Castiel clasps his hands around the back of his neck, shaking his head.
Dean hits the ground, kneeling into a crouch, his wings folding back around him and fading into nothing. It’s quiet.
Emmanuel has the gall to look genuinely affronted.
Dean looks up at him.
Castiel breaks from his mouth, panting, his breaths turning into sighs as Dean kisses down his neck, pulling him closer. He’s burning under his skin, just needing to touch him.
“The god who put your aunt and uncle in the hospital.”
Dean seems to take that as permission, and sits, legs hanging over the edge of the deck, next to Castiel.
“Yeah. So?”
“We gotta jump,” he grits out.
“I know.”
“Anna, Gabriel, hold on to Sam,” Charlie barks, moving in front of Sam, as he struggles to keep his grip on Castiel. Anna and Gabriel are frozen, and Sam whips his head around, yelling at them.
Castiel let out a small derisive sound.
“Nah. Been laying low at Benny’s. We'd been thinking about moving on, but then—” She turns, smiling at Dean. “Your friend Winchester here convinced us to rob a train.”
He opens his eyes.
“Let’s just
Gabriel grins, flashing said teeth at him.
Dean hops off the horse, still trying to maintain the illusion that his wrists are bound, and sits without comment, still staying stubbornly silent. The man and girl exchange a look, but hand him a plate.
“Well, yeah. That’s why I wanted to stop by. Grab my wallet,” Sam says, strangely stilted.
got something wrong, because they swore you did—”
Castiel had tried to apologize again as he was leaving, but Anna just slammed the door in his face. So he's in a pretty foul mood, definitely not helped by the morning traffic. His temper is already running hot these days, and on top of everything else, he's goddamn starving.
“That’s a shame,” Emmanuel says. “Looks like you found it.”
Dean stares at her, completely confused.
“Well.” Castiel reaches out to touch his cheek. “Me neither.”
But Sam is insistent.
Castiel remembers him saying.
He starts to walk forward, but Anna backs away from him, shaking her head.
“Well, come on now. That won’t do.”
“—So excuse me for not wanting to sit through that,” Dean finishes, grumbling a little.
Dean does something particularly unbelievable with his tongue and Castiel bolts upright, biting down on his knuckles. He rakes his other hand through Dean’s hair, finding the back of his scalp and gripping tight. Dean growls and only takes him deeper, scraping his nails against his skin.
“Not a word.”
Castiel clutches him tighter, pressing soft kisses into his neck as he speeds the motion of his hips, settling into a pace that has Dean writhing in his arms, his voice harsh and loud through gritted teeth. His whole body envelops and sinks with him, swallowing him whole, and Castiel can’t see anything else. There’s only Dean.
Dean rolls his eyes, but relents, and Cas tugs up the hem of his shirt, eyeing him critically. Dean taps his fingers against the wheel, leg bouncing up and down.
“Gotta move on from banks sometime, huh?”
“High emotional distress—“ Dean gives him a look. “Seriously?”
“…whining about.”
“Why did you send Anna and Gabe on ahead?” He asks.
“No, mother—” Dean takes her hand, squeezing it briefly. “I’m fine. Really.”
Castiel’s mind whirls.
“Why?” He sasses back. “‘Cause it’s so damn busy here?”
’s why the house has been so clean.”
“And us? Where are we going?”
Dean’s eyes slide closed, but Castiel can feel him desperately trying to form words, whispering
Despite the sudden loss of confidence of his friends, Hull has a furious look on his face.
“It’s a maze,” she says, her tone condescending. “Every curve is a possible lookout point—”
She helps him to his feet, shaking her head.
“Sounded like it was pretty urgent.”
“What?”
“Cops’ll be here any minute,” he snaps, grabbing his bag and roughly shoving his stuff in, his hands shaking.
“Theirs,” she finally repeats.
“Sam?” He whispers. “Sam Winchester?”
. Did that hurt? I just wanted to check—I didn’t know—“
He turns to the three of them, holding up his hands.
“Nah,” Dean answered quietly.
the cloud rumbled softly.
The trail is mostly dirt and sand for a couple miles, but once he hits the rockier parts Dean is forced to slow. The moon lights the way, but there are clouds—when they cover her up, it gets black as pitch. Dean curses, but he’s unwilling to push his horse any faster—it’s not worth the risk. If she throws a shoe on an upturned rock, then Dean will be stuck out here—and Butler will get away. Better to take it slow and steady, and ride hard when the sun comes up. Besides, the thief is probably dealing with the same thing, and Dean doubts he’s as skilled of a horseman. He had the look about him. Soft, East Coast, probably hasn’t been in the West too long. Hence the stealing.
Cas blows a breath out his nose, chuckling.
She trails off, simpering. Bobby just raises an eyebrow.
“I never said that—”
“Fuck you, I was gonna go to Comic Con next week,” she retorts.
Dean’s breath washes over him, and Castiel flinches. There’s a strange buzzing underneath his skin, but it doesn’t feel like fear. He knows that this is a creature that could rip him apart, destroy him in a flash of light, but Castiel feels no fear. Only exhilaration.
“Your funeral.”
He turns the heat up high, pausing when he hears a noise.
“Oh, wait—“
“Oh, please. Like I’d waste that effort on you.”
“What?” Dean growls, but his eyes are dancing.
Alive.
“Your jaw starts giving you stabbing pains every minute, you might change your mind.”
“Yeah,” Sam says. “When has he ever looked this happy?”
Cas blinks.
He wipes his face, blinking drops out of his eyes.
Dean watches them, his throat dry. He ain’t exactly looking forward to being held captive by these outlaws again—it’s just one fire to another.
“No,” Sam says sharply, glaring at Dean. “We need to talk.”
Dean rolls forward again and starts pressing kisses down the line of his neck, murmuring softly.
“Not soon enough,” Dean whispers, green eyes watery and pained. “I—“
Fighting the urge to retch, Sam squats down, keeping the cloth over his nose. He takes a closer look at the hand, just exposed in the dirt.
Dean clears his throat, awkwardly glancing around.
"And this is...your brother?" The woman asks, turning her pale eyes over to Sam, who immediately flushes, and drops his gaze. Dean resists the urge to groan.
He seems so genuinely taken aback, that Dean relaxes slightly. He knows he’s not like the men his mother warned him about.
He may be afraid, but Sam is standing tall, facing his oldest enemy. His left hand begins to glow, burning white hot with his grace.
Abaddon’s eyes flash with something that could be called fear, before it’s gone, and she’s hard as iron, hissing back at him.
He bends down low, the chestnut’s hooves flying, past the sign for the town of Ridgeville.
Castiel gasps, his lungs suddenly burning and working again.
now, the walls around them starting to tremble, shutters banging furiously.
following him?” Sam asks, narrowing his eyes.
“Wanna come?”
“Dunno.” He shrugs. “Never had food before.”
“Fuck that,” Dean snarls. “I don’t know what you did to trick her—”
“I mean, I’m not lying—”
Six days.
He had been goddamn lucky.
“Not what you expected?”
“Guess...guess Castiel’s got better aim than I thought,” he whispers.
“I—I have to talk to you.”
She does not answer for a moment, but when she does, her voice is clear, unafraid.
Sam tightens his hands on the reins, sinking forward.
Dean flushes, his face growing hot. Castiel blushes too, but he doesn’t correct himself.
Cas bites his lip.
“Wow. It really has been a long time.”
Dean ignores Castiel’s furious tone and leans an elbow on the windowsill, scratching his head.
Dean stills.
He clenches his fist instead.
I didn’t think you were going to do it so soon!”
Castiel’s eyes are closed, his fingers digging into the back of Dean’s neck.
The man does not look at him, instead making his way masterfully over the uneven ground.
Castiel opens his mouth, an argument on the tip of his tongue.
Cat ignores him, nuzzling in closer. Dean huffs.
“Probably.”
“Mine,” the girl named Jo says. “Anna came to live with us after those bastards killed her pa.”

When he recovers, he looks up. She’s not looking at him, inspecting her fingernails. Castiel coughs, trying to stand.
, Cas, Jesus.”
“Get him,” he says.
The door to Hell, open once again.
A rider, coming over the hill, blended into darkness by the sun silhouetted behind him. He rides up swiftly, and comes to a halt, cold black shadow falling over Dean.
They fall silent. Anna rolls one of the bullets in between her fingers, thinking hard.
The short one’s standing at the trough, watering the horses, and Dean stands, wiping his brow of sweat.
Dean rolls his eyes, but Charlie is already moving to come sit next to him, swiping through the camera roll on her phone.
“Dean, what the
Seriously, what was up with Eileen?
“Hey—”
Emmanuel looks down, clenching and opening one hand.
The next one is a bit more lucrative. She surfaces with a shitton of folded papers, and purses her lips as she flicks through it.
“I know, you think we are strange,” Hannah starts. “But we have more freedom than most could ever hope to have.”
“Back car,” he says, already disinterested and turning away.
They continue like that for Dean doesn’t know how long, but it’s Cas who comes first, his hips stuttering to a halt as he chokes out Dean’s name, Dean clinging to his shoulders, urging him there with gentle words and soft touches.
Ketch rolls his glass around in his hand, glancing around at the assembled partygoers.
Emmanuel comes up, wiping his face.
Alicia tucks a lock of Charlie’s hair behind her ear, leaning forward to give her a kiss.
“Why didn’t she trust me?” Sam whispers.
“Dean?”
Some of the men take a step back, faces sliding from confident to uneasy in a heartbeat.
“Thanks, Cas.”
The sheriff, Winchester, looks around them, his gaze fixing on the rubber-coated canvas above him. His eyes narrow.
She purses her lips, glancing across the room.
“Curious…human attachments.”
sense.”
He strips too, until he’s down to his black undershirt, taking a couple experimental pivots. The floor is nice, the dust helping with the traction.
“I dunno, man.” The bed creaks as Sam sits, leaning back against it. “I’m a little hungover. I’m gonna need this lunch to get over it.”
Castiel curls his lip.
Silence. Dean rolls his eyes.
Dean quickly holds up his hands, shaking his head.
“Yeah. I figured.”
“Now come on. Give me a tour, would you?”
“Shit, shit—”
He leans in, lowering his voice.
Castiel freezes.
“Dean—“
Dean refuses to look at him.
“Ready to order?”
Maybe she wasn’t feeling great after the bachelorette party last night. That must be it.
Abaddon is still, for a moment—then turns her hand slightly, looking down. The faint light catches the edge of the black blade, her fingers tapping the edge.
He forces Dean’s head up, making him meet his eyes.
“Cas,” he breathes. “I—I didn’t know, I didn’t feel her—“
Up ahead, he hears the shouts, the commotion as the outlaws start entering the train.
“You just…” He swallows.
Dean cautiously peeks around the desk, trying to catch a glimpse. It’s the same older woman who accosted him earlier. She glances around, disgruntled to discover Bobby is the only one in the room. She reluctantly addresses him.
But the only way Dean would leave is if he thought Castiel wanted him to go.
Castiel swallows, pulling back his newly-bandaged hands. He leans back in his chair, his voice hollow.
She spreads her hands.
Sam steps up onto the porch and into the blissful coolness of the jail. It’s far bigger than their one back in Creede, and most of the cells are full. One of the prisoners tracks Sam with his eyes as he walks to the furthest cell down on the right. There’s a man lying on the cot there, his back facing Sam.
“What are you doing here?”
Murmurs, whispers, all of them melt away as they both break out into the misty air of the graveyard, and Castiel quickly makes his way through the twisting labyrinthine passages between the graves, his shoulders set.
Her smile drops. She brings up her own sharp silver blade—but Dean twists away from her at the last second, knocking her back. The air around him is suddenly filled with a bright light, and Castiel rolls away from it, curling into himself.
Castiel lets out a bark of a laugh, rubbing his knuckles. Of course,
“Thanks.”
Castiel listens, laughing and smiling as fireflies lazily loop around them, buzzing in the late summer air.
“Triple homicide seem normal to you?”
Almost.
Dean pales.
(See the end of the chapter for
“She stays longer and longer every time,” Gabriel teases.
She grabs his hand.
Who definitely does not live in Castiel’s apartment.
“Gabriel…”
“Come on,” Charlie says softly. “Let me take you home.”
“Now,” she says, deadly quiet. “Let’s try this again.”
“You fucking
Dean holds his gaze, hoping that it comes off as commanding, despite the fact that he's sitting on the floor. He senses the challenge there, but a kind of stubborn integrity—a quality that the others at court severely lack. Something in Dean relaxes.
Bela turns to him, her voice cold.
He gets back home that night with Dean’s phone number in his pocket, an angry voicemail from Gabe—
“W-what?” He stutters out.
He ignores him. Castiel feels a rising knot of panic in his throat.
“If you miss your flight, not my problem,” Sam says loudly.
“Sam—“
Castiel wants to shove her off. He wants everything to disappear. He wants the whole world to reel and die and rip apart because that’s what it feels like now—like he’s being torn into, heart ripped out of his chest, skin left raw and bleeding.
Dean grips his arm, his voice weak.
“What is going on?” Says a sharp voice.
He can see now, there’s a gash in his side, blood and grace leaking out of it—
“For Alastair."
Okay.
“We should not be speaking to him,” Raphael suddenly snaps. “Our business is ours alone.”
“Well, look at that,” he says, finishing his tie and clapping Sam on the back. “We do clean up nice.”
Dean responds with a bashful smile, one hand twisting nervously into the hem of his shirt.
And if not, can I be forgiven?
“I can hit a can at fifty paces,” Dean says shakily.
"And I suppose I have to thank you," he says softly.
Sam paces anxiously. Dean is crouched down low, twisting his blade into the dirt. He doesn't blink. Just stares straight ahead, turning the blade slowly, over and over in his fingers.
“No—“
Cas kisses him again, a mischievous look in his eye.
“I remember,” he breathes. “I remember you—“
Castiel thought for a moment.
“You’re right. We—we have to go,” he hears himself say.
Dean is panting, and he grabs for all he’s worth, one hand gripping Emmanuel’s sleeve. He makes the mistake of looking down, the dizzying fall below making his head spin.
“I know, but—“
“It’s…it’s okay.”
Castiel fumbles, hands finding Dean’s cheeks. He can’t, he can’t open his eyes, because if he does, if he does—he’s not sure he’s going to make it.
"I'm sorry," he grits out. "I was too late, I couldn't—"
Castiel stands back, staring at the paint on the wall. He can only hope it'll be enough.
“You with me?” He yells.
He’s not really sure what to do. Dean is putting the room back together, darting about unsteadily as he gathers his clothes, pulling on his jeans, not looking at him.
The demon sneers.
He tosses the bullet back to Anna, and she barely catches it in time, blinking down at the silver in her palm. Castiel bites his lip, trying not to laugh.
They barely make it off the dance floor before Cas is stripping Dean of his jacket. They see a corner where they recognize Sam and Gabriel’s coats already abandoned, and both of theirs join the pile.
Dean didn’t think a place could be so
Dean’s turn now, and he smoothes the ash over Castiel’s arms, his chest, over the sigils inked in his skin.
“You wouldn’t like this anyway,” Dean says, brandishing the box. “Cats don’t eat pasta.”
Sam spills the metal tools from the pot, waiting a few more agonizing minutes until they're cool enough to touch. He grabs one of them, something that looks ancient, battered, and even after boiling, covered in what Dean hopes is rust stains.
“This book is old, though, I might even…”
His phone vibrates in his pocket and he pulls it out, seeing an incoming FaceTime from Sam. He grins and swipes it open, Sam's face filling the screen.
“Don’t make me hurt you,” he snarls.
“I am,” Dean snaps.
Something slams onto the desk right by his head, and he nearly jumps out of his skin.
“My name is Dean,” he says, smiling softly. “My family and I inherited this kingdom—“
Then he kicks.
He really shouldn’t be this irritating, because Castiel has always prided himself on being non-confrontational, but something about Dean really gets under his skin. Though…it seems like everything is getting under his skin lately. Seriously, since—
“This place is a dump,” he says, sounding bored. “These people are insufferable, this music is too loud, and this—” He lifts his drink, looking at it scornfully before throwing it back on the bar. “Is atrocious.”
Sam turns, indicating the cadets behind them.
When they appear in the middle of the library, Sam nearly smites them both.
Dean’s skin sears white-hot, his eyes lost in a silver haze.
Not here. Anywhere but here.
He’s short, and Castiel straightens up a bit when he sees him. He might be an angel, but at least Castiel had the height advantage.
“Cassie,” he says slowly. “What’s going on?”
Morgan takes a stuttering breath, those pale eyes glazing over.
“Wow, we really were gone on each other.”
“No, no—no.”
Dean hums slightly to himself as he sets up by the stove, getting everything ready for dinner.
“Happy hands are….hungry hands?” He says, his voice turning up at the end. Dean winces.
Alastair whips his blade around, moving towards Castiel.
“Aw, cheer up, Prince. I’m sure you’ll soon find your lady love.”
“Dean, I mean it.” Charlie glares. “Seriously.”
Dean roars in fury, ripping the bow from his back.
“Go to hell,” Castiel snaps, pushing past him towards the door.
“I’m sorry,” he whispers.
After a moment, he grabs the picture and tucks it into his wallet.
“I don’t care.”
He sighs.
“You explained it perfectly that night,” he breathes. “You’ll always choose your precious angels over us—no wonder you wanted to keep me away from them, you fucking selfish piece of shit—“
The angel continues to stare at him, emotion and conflict running across his face.
He stops, and Sam frowns.
Dean blinks at the bubbling surface of the water for a moment, goggling. He can't be serious.
But Ellen places a hand on Anna’s arm, her eyes on Emmanuel.
“Brother,” he mutters.
“She’ll probably beat you to it, Cas,” Gabriel says. “Ain’t he cute when he’s all murder-y?”
Dean sucks at his neck, just the barest hint of teeth reaching out to scrape at Castiel’s collarbone, breathing heavy against his skin. His smell is all tangled up in his nose, deep earth and wet moonlight hissing in his ears as Dean touches him.
Gabriel snaps.
Castiel blows out his breath, turning away. There’s a black fog at the corners of his vision, and it’s threatening to spread, but he beats it back. Focusing on the rhythm helps.
Castiel crosses his arms.
Bela releases her, stumbling back. Lilith is frozen, a small gasp escaping her lips as Anna recoils, yanking the blade from her body.
But now—he can’t, in good conscience, ride off and leave Emmanuel defenseless and in the dark about the posse on his tail. Dean’s a part of this now, too.
“Hello, Anna,” he says curtly. “Castiel.”
“All you had to do was ask him to come in,” He snaps at himself. “Not that damn hard, you idiot.”
“I can’t, Cas, dammit.”
Yet even as he stands here, taking in the beauty around him, his thoughts return to his impending marriage.
“You okay?”
Dean nods, even though he’s not sure he understands. He feels fine—good, actually—no. Better than good. He can feel the aftereffects from Castiel’s spell, but underneath there’s something new, a strange
She looks down, her fingers nervously spreading over the cotton. Castiel feels something like bile, rising in his throat, and he wants to retch.
“What?”
“That can’t be legal.”
The room remains silent and empty, except for his breath, picking up as the seconds drag by.
you—“
As if he could. Dean knows if their places were switched, Dean would have done anything, would've turned every town upside down in the search for his brother. He can't have expected Sam to do anything less.
Thankfully, Anna doesn’t push it. She just sighs, finishing off the bandages with a last piece of tape. Castiel sits up, twisting experimentally. They’re near perfect, tight and solid, with almost military-like precision.
“Did you?” Cas asks.
Castiel finally breaks out, into the air, into the darkness of the graveyard. His father is buried here, they just buried him not thirty minutes ago, but Castiel can’t go there. He can’t look at the upturned ground, the fresh dirt covering his body, the coffin that he knows lies below that six feet of earth.
“I think it’s…it’s a place where you have every good memory,” Anna continues, her voice soft. “Everything you want to relive. Everything you want to keep alive.”
“Hey,” Anna says stiffly back.
“No, Sam—listen.”
There’s a dangerous sort of hunger burning in Dean's eyes—raw and possessive, and Castiel is almost terrified, to have all that power concentrated on him. Dean quickly straddles him, rocking up into another hard kiss, and Castiel clutches at his shoulders, his arms, instinctively grinding up against him. Dean
It’s dark.
But Castiel can’t move. Dean chews his lip for a moment, his tone hesitant.
Castiel silently agrees.
“Dean, I love you, but I told you I’m not dressing up as Dr. Sexy.”
“Cas!”
“Lucky for you,” she snarls. “Hope it stays, otherwise you’re gonna lose some fingers.”
“If you want him to die,” Sam grits out. “That’s a lead bullet. We leave it in there, it’ll kill him sooner or later.”
The woman is petite, her dress elegant, but not extravagant. She approaches the dais where Dean and his family stand, and Dean feels the back of his neck prickle.
Sam steps forward, turning his palms up.
Castiel throws himself forward, wrenching the knife up, swinging it at her side—he knew it had been a demon, but her,
“And we lost her,” Emmanuel says haughtily. “So it worked.”
“Think he’ll survive?”
“Are you—are you serious?” Dean gapes at him, his mouth hanging open. “Cas, I thought you were in danger—“
Dean purses his lips, glancing around.
“Can you say something?” She says quietly. “Please?”
“Shut up, we are not listening to Alternative hipster crap the whole way.”
"Cas."
Raphael presses his lips together, sighing heavily.
He turns away, purposefully ignoring the cat as he digs through his cupboards for what he needs. Behind him, the cat meows plaintively.
She places a hand on Castiel’s arm, then looks over at her eldest.
“Dance with me,” Dean says breathlessly.
“I ain’t paranoid.”
He slowly steps up behind her, clearing his throat.
“I’ve known you almost your whole life, Cas.”
Dean clutches at his side, struggling to keep up with Cas.
But Dean. He’s taken Cas’s words and mixed in some of his own, and created something entirely unique. He’s funny, and heartfelt, simultaneously joyous and incredibly sincere, and Cas finds himself falling in love with every word.
“Hell, no.”
“Is that why you haven’t told everybody?” He asks, squinting at Dean.
Dean looks down, his shoulders slumping.
Dean spits in his face. Janklow snarls, knife momentarily lowering as he wipes at his eyes.
He pulls a bandanna from his pocket, pressing it to his mouth. It helps a little, but the stench is making his eyes water.
“I mean, he’s smart,” Max says.
Dean brightens a little, perking up in his chair. The principal stands, crossing over to the file cabinet over in the corner.
“No one’s ever figured it out,” she says quietly.
“Because that’s the only reason I kept you around, isn’t it?” Castiel snarls. “Because I thought you could help, but you couldn’t—you’re
“And a ball so soon!” she simpers, her smile wide. “When do you come of age, dear boy?”
“The red, I think,” she says.
The outlaw continues staring, those cool eyes unreadable.
Sam shakily tells them about what happened in the club the night before, his breath halting and ragged.
“Drop the gun, Gabe,” Dean orders. He can feel Emmanuel staring at him, horror on his face.
“Please,” Dean begs.
She doesn't blink, her eyes never leaving his.
He slowly lowers his hand, looking up into the face he tried two years to forget.
Anna gives him that glare, but he can see the smile behind it, fighting to break through.
“Sleep?” There’s a hint of humor in his voice.
“Dean, I swear to god.”
“You let her kill me,” she whispers, advancing on him. “You let me die.”
Dean sits up, taking his hands.
The girl tilts her head, looking at him.
That being said: If you are affected by MCD, I would strongly suggest you don't read on until the fic is completed. All tags still apply.
“―and I found a brewery that’s open on Tuesdays―and there’s also this gorgeous nature preserve on the island called the Limahuli Garden, I think? They have self-guided walking tours that are about three hours―”
“Oh, Castiel.”
Emmanuel and the sheriff are doing their bullshit staring thing again, sitting at the table and playing with the rest of the outlaws, but with the way they’re looking at each other, they might as well be the only two people at the table. Gabriel huffs, rubbing a hand over his face. Looks like they’re never getting rid of the man now.
She smiles, and Castiel floods with sudden dread. She raises a hand, and snaps her fingers.
“Boys and girls, we’re robbing us a train.”
“It’s our first night here. Figured we should make it memorable.”
Sam shrugs.
He’s absolutely miserable.
“We are LEAVING without you!” Alicia yells from the doorway.
He glares up at her.
. I just treated him like a human being.”
Dean continues to work at his side, his touch soft and light. Castiel tries again.
“To—to see someone you love die is a terrible thing,” he whispers.
“Apocalypse…I admit, the name is damning. But when we win—because we will win—it’ll be paradise. Why wouldn’t you want that?”
He’s unable to pursue it further, because at that moment, the blacksmith comes back. He seizes his son by the arm.
He hesitates for a second, then leans forward, gently shrugging Dean out of his jacket. He feels slightly dirty doing so, but it’s worth it when he sees Dean is unharmed. Castiel sighs. He sets the jacket on the table next to the bed, then returns to Dean’s side, threading their fingers together.
“Aw, Ellennnn―”
“Yes.”
“Well, then. I’ll be quick.”
He gets his arm around Dean’s waist again, urging him forward.
The man looks up, lips turning up in a half-smile.
Emmanuel’s gun slips from his grip, and his head drops to the ground, his hat falling off. Without it, he looks small, pale—red blood on his lips.
“Of course. Just don’t go projecting out of school again. I don’t want you getting in trouble on my account.”
Dean chokes on a breath, dropping his head.
Castiel is speechless. Anna’s hands are over her mouth.
She cuts off abruptly. Castiel feels a dark chill settle through him.
“Dammit—”
“Oh.”
“There were—there were three of ‘em. Or four—”
,” he snarls. “And then you—then there was you, and everything I knew, everything I thought I knew—“
“Okay, everyone smile—yes, perfect.”
“It's fine,” Dean says shortly. “Besides, I’m needed here.”
“It’s a common pastime. In Laurence,” he says shortly.
“I could say the same to you.”
He nods toward the table.
She’s dancing with a few other women, but he sees the way she’s giving looks to the men around her. Mick approaches quickly, taking her arm.
“Hmm.”
“And I’m just supposed to trust you?”
Benny stares back at the pair of them, looking over Castiel with a suspicious eye. Dean’s temper flares.
“Bullet full of holy oil.” She shoves another round in, grimacing. “One shot only, unfortunately. She’s gonna put herself back together soon, and when she does, she’s gonna be pissed—“
“Get out of the way,” she hisses.
“Hey, Benny.”
“Anna—”
“Um…excuse me.”
Eileen and Alicia lean in.
He stares at him, unable to move.
“Hey, why don’t we go wait for the others on the balcony? Sam, you got your wallet, right?”
“Look. I’ve known Cas for a long time. He’s my best friend.”
“C’mon, you cooked.” Dean reaches to take the plate from him, smiling. “It’s the least I can do.”
She holds up a hand, pleading. She turns back to Gabriel.
He pulls on his leather gloves, slowly, one at a time. The man in front of him is begging, babbling away about something.
The guy grins, and behind him, Castiel hears Michael scoff and storm off, the crowd booing him out.
“Dean!”
He clutches at his collar, vision blurring with tears.
“You see that man there?”
Castiel takes a bitter swallow of coffee, letting its scent sting his nostrils.
Sam shrugs.
“And what are
His yellow eyes fix on Dean, darkening in madness.
He looked up slowly, eyes unfocused.
“I think I prefer 'oblivious'."
Gabriel is still.
But Anna is strong, stronger than he could ever be, helping him move towards the angels, human shadows dragging behind them.
“Oh! I volunteer with a soup kitchen downtown!” The woman says, smiling wide. “What organization is it?”
Dean can’t think of how to respond to that. Castiel looks so broken, so defeated.
Dean can’t manage to return the gesture, staring dumbstruck at the priest as the Marshal leads him up to the noose, sneering.
Dean smiles.
“You were there and you were dead, but I couldn’t, I couldn’t—“
“Christ, Abby,” she mutters.
He looks up at the angel. Charlie is standing behind Sam, her face drawn. Gabriel pushes up his reading glasses, rubbing his eyes.
Dean stares, unable to move. He knows that hat.
“You know damn well you still can,” Crowley hisses back. He presses the blade harder against his throat.
Gabriel raises an eyebrow.
Jesus. You say one thing, and then your angel drops you into the stratosphere.
“Sam Winchester,” Luke says, sneering. “What an expected disappointment.”
“I don’t know, brother,” Benny says finally, sitting back. “Sounds like something you and this Castiel oughta discuss.”
They sniped at each other the whole way home, and Castiel could barely keep back his smile.
The lights shatter and Castiel falls back, gasping. Anna grabs his collar and they shield themselves from the falling glass just in time—clinging to each other as it clatters around them, the room shaking violently.
Castiel leans an elbow out the window.
He closes his eyes.
The man shakes his head quickly.
“Watch me,” Dean snarls back.
Dean yanks Castiel’s legs closer and hooks his arms around him, turning instead to mark up his skin, sucking rough red splotches on the inside of his thighs, those strong hard hands pinning his hips to the bed. Castiel shudders, choking back a moan.
“Charlie—we have to go, we have to save him—“
There's a scuffle of noise behind him—and Castiel jerks around to see Anna, fighting against another demon, who's holding her fast, a knife to her throat. Relief floods through Castiel briefly before Naomi twists her own knife, digging it into his skin. Castiel draws in a sharp breath, biting down on his lip.
Gabriel throws his keys on the table, shucking his dripping coat, speaking furiously.
Oh no.
Meg takes another sip, red lips never leaving a stain on the porcelain. “But I’ve been hearing too many whispers. A rider, alone, but nosy. Been stopping in every backwards waterstop here to Utah, asking questions about you. His name ain’t connected to Morgan’s so far, but…”
Alastair shrieks in pain, falling back. Castiel cries out too, dropping to his knees, releasing the blade. The attack had sent a throbbing pain shooting up his arm, and he cradles it to his chest, unable to breathe.
“Hey, deadweights. Let’s go,” Anna says, cutting through the moment.
He pulls on the front of Dean’s shirt for a quick kiss, before Gabe answers and Cas has to respond.
“Hey,” Dean protests weakly.
His father has crept away silently, like a ghost.
“Gym,” he says, the exact same time Cas says “Farmer’s market.”
Dean scowls, crossing his arms. Mary smiles, a teasing tone in her voice.
“Just fucking kiss me, Cas.”
At the first close of a hand around his cock, Dean hitches forward, breathing in sharply. Castiel kisses him through it, hand slowly moving up and down until Dean is nearly crying out, muffling his sounds and groans against Castiel’s lips.
Castiel’s eyes snap back to the creature in front of him.
Potion bottles of every size, scrolls littered with ancient-looking words, and a stack of spellbooks piled so high, they almost brush the ceiling. Dean seats himself in a squashy armchair by the books, wincing when the stack teeters dangerously.
They establish a new normal. Anna still calls the church home, even though more often than not she’s usually away. Castiel is on his own most days, Anna halfway across the country, on another hunt, another lead. Sometimes she goes off solo, but sometimes she joins up with other hunters. Zeke, mostly. Castiel has learned to not expect her most nights, and to instead feel joy when he sees her car parked in the driveway in the morning.
The city is brightly lit, decorated to celebrate the upcoming holiday, the celebration of the birth of Christ. Obviously, things got a little lost over the years. The infant known as Joshua, and later Jesus, was not born in December as the stories said, but July. And there had been only two men in attendance, both of whom were
“Your mother is worried sick,” he says eventually, but his eyes are on Dean.
They all nod in agreement, tentative smiles breaking out. Dean has a growing suspicion that they have not spoken to someone outside their group in quite some time.
“Tell me of your day,” he says, smiling.
“Whaddya say, Cas?” He glances at Dean, a sly twinkle in his eye. “You got room for a doctor on your team?”
Castiel pauses.
“If you’re looking for food, go begging somewhere else.”
It’s not his fault, of course it isn’t, but Dean’s guilt hangs heavy in his every move, every word, every breath, and nothing Castiel says makes it better.
A dark pool of blood.
Cas scowls, straightening in indignation—and smacks his head on the underside of the counter.
“Did you get a nap?” He asks, slurring a little.
Castiel grips him back, fighting the choked feeling in his throat. He shakes his head, laughing shakily.
Movement to his right catches his eye, and he sees Cas, marching determinedly up to the pre-poured champagne flutes. Dean turns, smiling, but Cas ignores him in favor of grabbing a flute and downing it in one go. Cas sets it down, and immediately reaches for another.
Castiel tries to ignore the feeling of Dean’s head against his chest, his labored breathing as he closes his eyes. They're too close, this is too close.
“You shouldn’t have taken down the warding,” he snarls, working at the red lines.
He hunches over, shaking as he struggles against the feeling, wanting to make it last.
, remember?”
“We’ll stick ‘em in the back, babe.”
“Anna—“
“Bill?”
He’s been drowning for months, but he’s only just realized it. Right before he’s pulled under the water.
Sam swings himself off his horse, cursing in frustration.
Above him, Sam’s blood spattered face, his mouth moving with unheard words.
But then he speaks.
“No. We gonna do this, we have to lay down some ground rules.”
“It’s April,” she says carefully.
Then he knelt, reached out, and touched his cheek.
“No, Cas. Don’t—“
"Cas," he chokes. "I—"
Eileen snorts, reaching for her drink.
Dean nods, and nods. Sam’s mouth is starting to twitch.
Crowley picks up the blade, laughing quietly.
“You just get more and more interesting, my friend.”
"Just keeping watch," Dean says cheerfully.
Beside him, Anna shrinks back, but Castiel is frozen, staring at him in shock.
A hole that apparently his father thought could be filled with this
Dean awakes, eager and refreshed the next morning. He dresses quickly, impatient. This time he will explore the forest fully, comb it over for any sign of life.
Eileen freezes, and turns fully to face him.
Is it possible?
Sam struggles to keep Dean upright—but Dean throws him off, his gaze murderous. Lilith chuckles.
“And I was ready to follow her to the ends of the earth. She came to me, came to so many of us, speaking of love and family and protecting the earth…I thought she meant you. Humans.”
“Looks like I will have to kill you after all."
“Take me.”
“I can't beat you," he pants. "You’re too damn fast.”
The green light swirling around him crackles, and Dean watches, fascinated.
Sent:
“Just try to keep your knees bent, and your center of gravity low. Don’t forget to adjust your feet once you stand!”
With a slash of his talons, he severs the chain and the ring goes flying, landing in the soft dirt. Castiel yells, making a grab for it.
“Hell isn’t the only place with experts in torture,” Sam says bitterly. Castiel grips the edge of the table.
The other two turn their heads sharply.
“Of course.”
Meg catches on first, and laughs, light and silvery.
,” he snarls again. “And I would do anything to escape this—you may have been to Hell, but I have lived it, every day! These humans are
Then his eyes dance, a slow smirk curling his lips.
“You’re hurt,” he says, frowning.
There are only a handful of souls left in the world that I can trust. And I still can’t guarantee their safety. Not even my own.
“Cas, you don’t have to—“
“Driver picks the music, dick.”
Castiel swallows. Sam is looking at him curiously.
But he runs.
Sam’s dirt-streaked face melts in relief, tugging her up.
The cart rolls to a stop, and Dean lifts his head. The man they named as Morgan's successor steps up, throwing open the wooden door, beckoning to him. His deputy’s behind him, keeping his shotgun trained on Dean. Dean huffs, stepping down into the muck. The deputy prods him in the back, snarling.
“Cas—“
Castiel whimpers and screams against Sam, clawing at him.
“Please.”
“I don’t know what has been troubling you, but for the sake of your mother, for the sake of tonight—“
“Probably in a ditch somewhere,” Cas says idly, turning over his cone, sizing up where to take his next bite. Because of course Cas is one of those weirdos that
“You don’t know who I am?”
Cas flips to the front of his book, and there’s Dean, over and over again, his eyes, his face, his lips. Some even of him naked, sleeping.
He doesn’t hear the explosion of noise that follows. He doesn’t hear the whoops and the cheer and the applause. All Castiel is aware of right now is that he is kissing an extremely hot stranger, an extremely hot and
