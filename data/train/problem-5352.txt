It was strange, after all this time, feeling his mind slow down. It was almost as if time itself was putting on the brakes, allowing him to truly feel the world around him. Because Tony was exhausted, and it seeped so deeply into his bones that his usual restlessness blew away with the wind, leaving him almost unsettlingly still.
Tony remembers the time when Steve promised to be there. He wonders how delusional he must have been to have seen love in those eyes.
In what seemed like no time at all, Happy pulled into an underground parking lot somewhere in Queens. He drove down to the lowest floor, and parked the car in the furthest corner. A few spaces over stood a Harley-Davidson Softail Breakout and an Audi R8.
“C’mon J, don’t torture our favourite agent. Put the engine on, he can drive.” Tony grinned as the engine started and Coulson scowled but took it in his stride. As they pulled out of the car park, Tony activated the holographic screen and keyboard that only works for him. As they drove, he quickly glitched out all the security cameras as they drove past them, leaving the four of them entirely untraceable. SHIELD however, that was tougher.
Eventually, his joints started complaining about the rough treatment and even the large expanse of his workshop made him jittery and painfully claustrophobic. Tony found himself in the lift to the common room, suddenly achingly desperate for some form of human interaction.
Steve saw Happy snicker out of the corner of his eye, and he smiled. He and Bucky had grown particularly fond of the man, as he always quietly disliked the boss, and looked out for the two agents.
The call cuts out, and everyone in the car is looking at him like he’s grown a second head. Tony sighs, figuring he’ll have to explain himself. “My father and Fury’s father were… allies is probably the most accurate. We’ve known each other since long before he was president, before I was Iron Man even. We have our differences, but we see eye-to-eye-to-eyepatch on more things than you’d imagine. And he owes me anyway, but that’s a whole other story.”
The ceremony was huge, and swarming with the kind of men Obie would refer to as ‘Iron Mongers’. War profiteers, people who rose up from the ashes after World War Three in the early 2400s. Tony was quite used to being lumped together with these morons, but he knew what he and Rhodey were doing for the United Empire of America was far greater than anything their counterparts’ pathetic minds could come up with.
"Whatcha think this one's gonna be?" Bucky piped up, wearing a weary grin. "Chinese military base? Iranian terrorist group?"
"I'm telling you! It could happen! Maybe he'd like me? Like, I know he's a blonde super-hunk but like-"
“Whatever, whatever, I’m assuming you didn’t answer this highly encrypted call with JARVIS’ warnings in the room full of agents?” At Darcy’s affronted
Hammer slammed his hand on the desk, cutting off the rest of his sentence. "Shut up, Barnes. Question me again and I'll have you shot."
"What the actual fuck?!" He exclaimed, giving Hammer a dirty yet still shocked look. "This is me! My actual, legitimate name. What shit are you on, buddy?"
“Nah, the boss-man’s right. We’re the best damn STRIKE team, and Stark ain’t so bad.” Barton grinned, the easy insubordination clearly written into his DNA.
“I think it’s a good idea.” Coulson said plainly, and the room quietened down immediately. “If this mission downed Mar- Hill, then it’s going to need some extra power. I volunteer Delta Squad to take this operation, and I am requesting that we’re joined by Iron Man.”
Without the luxury of read receipts, Tony went to bed troubled that night, silently begging the universe to give him a break for once in his life.
"Still on their summer holiday. Only got a week left until the kids show up, then it's back to insanity." Clint sighed. "Wait, that's not a good advertisement. Shit. Like, the kids here are great! Super smart and stuff, just a real handful. Not too many of 'em though."
The last time that she joined him under the stars was- well. Tony still hasn't quite found a word for the way that she, with brutal efficiency, told him that their relationship just wasn't that kind of love. He had dropped the glass off the edge of the balcony.
“Tony I like your idea, but the best fighter bots are powered by your father’s arc reactor. They take up the entirety of the inside of the bot.” Rhodey sighs wistfully.
SHIELD was located just outside of Queens, a stone's throw away from a neighborhood called Little Neck. The building itself was sleek and modern, coming across more like one of the CIA's training facilities than a boarding school. It's surrounded by large grounds, they stretch far and look pleasant, but there's a tall wall bordering the area. There's one gate, seemingly automated, that's the only way in and out of the grounds.
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have mentioned it. Forget I said anything, really." Steve has his eyes on the ground, and he looks like a kicked puppy.
"Damn shame- I mean, sure. Cool- uh- leave your stuff in the reception, you can come and get it after the tour." She just about managed to string the sentence together, and seemed to be slightly proud that she managed it. The two men obliged, tucking their cases by Darcy's desk, and proceeded to follow Clint and Darcy in through the large glass doors that separated the reception from a large entrance hall.
"Sounds good to me." Steve smiled, "C'mon Buck." As he was walking back to the bike, he noticed his oldest friend throw a wink at the enthusiastic man - Clint, was it? - and hoped to God that neither of them would get too attached. Because Steve was already feeling
“And it seems you’re Anthony, Mr Stark.” There was a ghost of a smile on his face, despite the perpetually cold tone.
“Sure, give me a couple minutes. Plug it into the dash at the side there, and J will run the programs.” Tony saw the progress bar pop up, and he flicked the box over to the side for Barton to keep an eye on.
"That's what I thought, boys." He smirked. "I know it's, perhaps, a bit unorthodox. But when anyone searches you up, all they'll ever find is glowing reviews and Instagram holiday snaps. So calm down, hm?"
Tony quickly cuts off that train of thought, forcing it back into the darkest corner of his mind, refusing to face reality. He returns his attention to the computer, to the document full of false starts and cliché concepts.
Words that once flowed smoothly like clockwork ground to a bitter halt, depriving Tony of his last healthy outlet. Thinking nothing of it in the haze, he tucked his notebook away and reached for the whiskey.
"Ah, of course. You boys have always brought a certain... charm to the business, yes. Speaking of, I have your next assignment here. Isn't it exciting?"
This is the point in the story where Pepper truly made a place for herself in Tony's heart. She swept him up in her life like a suited tornado, keeping him sane. Even when he wanted to wring Cap by the neck, she calmed him down and made him see some semblance of sense. And, as a byproduct, made him try even harder for the woman he truly didn't deserve.
When Tony was satisfied, he folded the page in half and tucked it into the locked drawer of the desk.
“The second red flag was the mission itself. It was listed as medium-priority, risk level five out of ten. Should’ve been easy, especially with an experienced team like Beta. And yet, Pierce was saying this is a top-priority mission.” Coulson was driving them through backroads now and Tony was quite pleased to have less security cameras to deal with glitching out.
Steve hopped back on the bike and followed Bucky round to the car park, where they chose spaces a little further away so that they could park next to each other (because they're both total saps).
However, this is a curious thing to do when you're meant to be yourself, so Steve finds himself at a loss slightly. He decided, for the first time, that there's not much more to create than a backstory. If he makes himself too much like someone else, it could kill the act, seeing as everyone at the school has access to his actual social media accounts. Equally, not enough character and he could seem unprofessional.
Coulson shifts in his seat, and turns to face him. “He always said there was only one other person who called him that.”
"Jerk." Steve cut in, "Actually, he squealed like a child on Christmas day and applied immediately."
"Tony." Steve's serious tone shuts him up immediately. "You move so fast and you burn so brightly. Almost everything you do is on a whim so meticulous that it looks like it was planned a decade ago."
Steve's first thought was dedicated to the sheer scale of the building. It was very obvious how expensive this school was, if the large grounds and even larger presence hadn't already convinced you. It had a very industrial feel, seeming quite lifeless and- cold?
"Either this is a typo, or you're revealing our identities to a school for special snowflakes." Bucky snarled, conveniently forgetting Steve's warning.
He sat down on the ground next to Tony, and the two sat in a semi-comfortable silence for a few minutes.
There was Yinsen, a saviour before he even spoke a word to Tony. He knows he owes his life to the man, and that debt shall remain unfulfilled until the day he himself drops. Tony tries to believe that death was truly what his companion wanted.
Then, at 3am, whilst running on fumes and no sleep whatsoever, Tony had the breakthrough that he knew would put SI right back at the top. He phoned his best friend Rhodey as soon as he had enough of a concept in his mind.
"As you know, you're undercover as well, yourselves, to teach at SHIELD. Your exact mission details will be sent through once you're settled, but I can grace you both with some extra information now! You need to gain the trust of all the staff who work there, become part of the family. Beneath people like you and me I know, but needs must. Once you're accepted into their little team, you gotta start sneaking around after dark, you boys know the drill. Find out everything about Tony Stark. I'm counting on at least one of you to develop a close relationship with him, both for the usefulness and the satisfaction of breaking his pathetic little heart- anyway. Trust nobody, agents. Hammer out."
“This car’s now more secure than Fort fucking Knox. What’s happening, Coulson?” Tony questioned, tugging off his tie and chucking it into the footwell.
Bucky patted the steering wheel and got out of the Audi, popping the trunk on the way. Steve grabbed his battered leather suitcase, and dropped the black one on the ground.
Steve and Bucky propped the device up on the roof of the Audi and pressed play. It buffered for a few seconds and started playing.
"Sure Tony, whatever you say. If you can prove that's a genuine condition, I'll consider changing my mind."
Alpha Team is headed up (befittingly) by Brock Rumlow, a cocksure bastard whose team consists of a slimy asshole called Jack Rollins and some other goons who Rumlow seems to treat as disposable.
"The very man! I have some... let's say personal experience with Stark, and he never seemed a good man, y'know? But I uncovered some fun secrets whilst doing some digging for something else. Seems like he's hiding something."
After a few minutes of small talk, President Fury stepped onstage, and everyone fell silent. Not so much out of respect- out of fear. In the war, Fury’s father was president, and he was the one who created the Empire. Thanks to him, his son was now in charge of almost the entire world. (The European Union, the UK and Russia managed to escape the Empire’s rule. Everyone else is now governed by President Fury.)
Time stops. Tony loses all the courage he had just moments ago, and scrambles to think of a way to cover his ass, to stop himself from making the mother of all confessions. He can't think of anything, too distracted by the man in front of him. "Nothing really," He says quickly, "just rambling. Sorry to cut the welcome back party short Cap, but I have some work to be getting on with. See you around, yeah? Yeah, around."
Steve fought the urge to roll his eyes and instead did as requested, giving the man a firm handshake. Bucky just sat down and glared, and both men took secret delight in how their boss twitched slightly at being so blatantly ignored.
Tony hadn't noticed how much he missed Steve despite everything. Hearing his voice was almost too much, but the last thing he would ever do is hang up.
With a foot on the pedal and a quick flick of the wheel, Steve and Bucky watch as Hammer Tower fades into the skyline as they drive out of the city.
Tony is about to reply with something witty, but then the call to Darcy connects. “Tony? What’s up?”
. Every other time when the supersoldier chases after Tony and his reckless moves in battle. Had Tony somehow managed to entirely overlook the possibility that Steve… wanted him too?
He and Bucky had been best friends ever since they were 8 years old, when Steve got into a fight with some older boys. They'd been pulling on this brunette's pigtails, and he'd stepped in to try and stop them. It worked... mostly. They left the girl alone, but only so they could turn their attention to Steve and start beating him to a pulp. Bucky had stepped in, telling them "pick on someone your own size!" and proceeding to (somehow) beat up the biggest guy. The others ran for it, leaving Steve on the ground with a bloody nose and mouth agape at the boy who'd actually stuck up for him.
He reread what he wrote with a more critical eye, reshaping the raw emotions into palatable English, harshly critiquing his rusty wording.
They walked back round to the front, where Clint and Darcy were engaged in very animated conversation.
He leaned in close to Clint’s ear, whispering something before kissing him roughly on the lips, hand bunched up in the other man’s shirt. Clint seemed to melt, clasping his hands around Coulson’s neck. After a few (extremely long) seconds they pulled apart, both men having the audacity not to look remotely embarrassed.
The night after the Battle of New York was the first of many under the stars. He sat out on the balcony, windows blown out behind him, a glass of brandy on the ground next to him.
Rhodey was smiling proudly like a good soldier should, sitting up straight in his uniform with all his medals on display. Tony however was not a military man- he was slumped down in his chair in an expensive suit, wearing the sunglasses that projected a hidden screen onto the lenses. He was watching Ghostbusters, because he’s always believed that films went downhill after 2100.
were they a lovely sight. He mentally upgraded Steve from 'companions' to 'eye candy with a side of friendship'.
Steve read, re-read and re-re-read the page. After the fourth re-read, he started questioning his eyes. After the fifth, he sorely needed to question Hammer.
Steve, unbeknownst to Tony, was stroking over the words of his poem, having copied it out as soon as he received it. "What is lost, as you said yourself, can be rediscovered. What love we had can make it, Tony." He paused, before adding;
One in the morning is, in Steve's opinion, the most unreasonable time to be called into a meeting. Unfortunately, the boss is not a man you want to argue with, so he stood grumbling outside the elevator. Luckily, his oldest friend Bucky was also summoned, so they could complain about it together.
He followed Clint and Darcy as they turned left, walking down the corridor. Bucky was at his side, pulling at the glove he put on to hide the metal arm.
The reporters erupted into shouts and flashes of cameras, and Tony grabbed his glasses and stalked off, Pepper effectively crowd-controlling behind him.
"You're thinking too hard, that's my job. Try not to give yourself an aneurysm, Cap, we need you and your fifty stars on the team."
Tony, despite his current pessimism, hates bad endings. His life seems to deal him those cards constantly and unrepentantly, ending everything painfully and pairing them with beginnings that were so beautiful he couldn't bear to ignore them.
That was 47 days ago. Now, whenever he thinks of the midnight balcony, all he sees is the shattered remains of the crystalline glass 40 floors below- and the shattered remains of his trust in love.
Also, I'm so sorry it took me so long to update. Lockdown did a number on me, but I'm looking forward to getting back to writing this. I can't believe that one chapter got 50 kudos!!
"My thoughts exactly! But, alas, we're not here to investigate the whole institution, or not at first glance. Who knows what could transpire? But no, I want you to focus on one specific target. Turn the page, boys."
Steve raises one eyebrow, and the genius immediately cuts himself off. “Let me finish,” he says, fond exasperation colouring his tone, “no, because I refuse to jump into this headfirst, as much as I may want to. You said it very eloquently yourself, you’re coming out of a relationship and it’s
The noise in the room escalated and escalated until there was a loud whine of a repulsor and the sound of shattering glass. It was Rhodey, arm raised menacingly with a thunderous expression on his face. He’d smashed a window to get everyone’s attention. “The next person who raises their voice at Tony Stark will get a blast to the head.”
Tony jumped, not expecting the company, although he probably should've been. He turned his head, shooting his teammate a scathing glare.
“Well, after your press conference I was tasked by Miss Potts to gauge the media response. Many major media outlets were quoting your father when he said “Stark men are made of iron”. Perhaps this could translate into a name?”
"Looking out on the city you should know like the back of your hand, and seeing a whole new world of inconceivable differences."
Deciding that settled that, the four of them drove back to Stark Tower with a newfound friendly banter, interspersed with mission planning and Darcy’s confirmation that she’s fabricated their time in Coulson’s office, then cut the cameras in the time it would’ve taken them to leave. She hung up with a cheerful goodbye just as the car drove into the underground parking lot of the Tower.
He built new bridges, he made loose threads into exquisite tapestries, and the team had never seen such an altruistic, kind-hearted Tony Stark. But he never before had felt so disconnected from the world. Pepper had been his rock, his anchor, his everything. And despite gaining such deep connections with the people around him, he still felt as though he was trapped behind a wall of crystalline glass, looking in.
"Yes! There we go Rogers, just had to jog the old memory, it seems? Fantastic. Well, my personal findings suggest that one of the staff members in this school is an... important ene-uh, target. Well go ahead boys, open your briefings. And look alive Barnes! This is exciting stuff!"
"I bet." Tony paused. "For what it's worth, I hope it, uh, gets easier. And other sympathetic things I should probably be saying, pretend I said them."
The tower itself was a monument to the conceited nature of their boss. Hidden in plain sight, he played with two very different roles, switching between them like a moody child, (which also happens to be an apt definition for the man) and seemingly loving how he deceives the world.
Steve laughed at the deputy's antics; he just found him so easy to get on with. Steve found himself wondering if the job will be a bit easier than he'd thought, if everyone is this relaxed.
He wasn't sure if that was the right word, he sure hoped it wasn't, but there wasn't really any evidence of students.
Tony Stark is one of the richest men in the world. His phone contacts stretch from Aniston to Zuckerberg, with hundreds in-between. And yet, when the stars shine in the sky and the sun hides below the horizon, he feels like the loneliest man in the known world.
“We’re trying to make our way through all the coffee-shops in New York to find the ultimate caffeine-rich experience. Tasha tags along too, sometimes.”
"Director Fury." Steve was clearly unimpressed, and his raised eyebrow had even Tony feeling like a scolded child.
The decades passed and it was almost as if the recent events revived the poetic voice in him; maybe two wrongs do make a right.
Pierce looked at Tony and Rhodey, as if begging them to disagree. Rhodey simply shrugged, and Tony got up to go and stand behind Team Delta, closing the faceplate to end the conversation. Rumlow looked like he was about to protest, but Coulson got up out of his seat, his subordinates following his lead.
"Do try not to worry sir, you neglected to give me the capacity to be offended, therefore I am unaffected by your choice of threat."
"They didn't really think this through," Steve complained, "how exactly do you put a suitcase on a bike?"
Pierce glared at him. “You asked me who died. I told you, Agent Hill is dead. You need to come in for debriefing.”
The two men exit the tower, and head straight for the sleek black car parked directly in front of the door. Steve grabs Bucky's suitcase, and along with his, throws it in the trunk. He strolls casually along to the left back door, and hops in.
Steve took a moment and looked him in the eyes. Sometimes they do this; he can see straight into the inventor's soul if he looks hard enough.
“JARVIS! You’re a genius. Y’know, cause I made you. Throw it back in their face and call it the Iron Man project.”
Until 47 days ago, one of Tony's favourite things to do was to sit out on the balcony at the dead of night. In the city that never sleeps, he could watch the world be busy without him as he nursed a glass of something aged and expensive. Occasionally Pepper would join him, and the gentle consistency of the traffic noise combined with the moonlight encouraged them to open up to each other.
These circumstances are what made losing Steve so jarring. Somehow, Tony had convinced himself that his boyfriend loved him and would never leave him behind, but... it turns out even Captain America was a bastard.
Steve was about to continue reminding him, but the elevator chose that moment to arrive. They both stepped in, and hit the button for the top floor of the tower.
Tony Stark is many things. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. He’s a great inventor, a suave businessman, a brilliant lover and he definitely considers himself a superhero. But the one thing Tony isn’t is a soldier. That’s why he was hesitant to join up with the military, but he knew working with them would probably be the right thing to do. Also, SI now has all the military contracts that don’t involve weapons. Pretty good for business.
For the first few days after the breakup, he shut himself in his workshop and worked. And worked, and worked, and kept working until his brain shut down and he collapsed on the floor, passing out for a few hours before he woke up jarred and disoriented. And then he repeated, working his way through a lifetime's supply of liquors.
“Don’t,” Tony snarled. “Don’t assume shit, Maria is one of the most competent agents in this entire joint. She’d be insulted by the mere
Friendship is reading in a comfortable silence with Bruce, or learning to play video games with Clint (he is yet to win a single game of Mariokart against the archer).
"Well boys, I'd say that we're done here, yes? I really want to go and eat what the chef prepared now, so I'll let you out of here." Hammer said, showing off more than necessary. "Car comes to pick you up at 2pm tomorrow. Be there or be fired. Bye for now." He abruptly stood up and left the room, leaving the two men sat, slightly dazed, in front of his desk.
After the ceremony that he (barely) survived, he was pulled aside by Secretary Pierce. This was fairly surprising for Tony; the two men have a history of getting into pissing contests over the pettiest of things.
The meme was a yellow dog in a room on fire, sat at a table with a mug. There was a speech bubble saying 'This is fine.'
That same bleak night Pepper packed up and left, jetting off to run the business in Malibu, leaving Tony alone in the expanse of the penthouse. Only when she'd gone did Tony realise just how desolate the cold, sleek space was. He'd grown used to the gentle feminine touches, but they had all been hastily grabbed and thrown into the hangar of the jet. It was almost like she'd never walked through his door, never walked into his heart.
The fourth and fifth people not yelling at him were Bruce and Darcy, but that was less out of agreement and more to do with the fact that they were engrossed in a computer screen.
"And who's fault is that, Mr Just-Once-I-Swear, one day I'll stop doing your shitty paperwork." Darcy looked pleased at her retort, as this time Clint was sulking.
“We’ll be going to my office now,” Coulson said to the room (and in subtle reply to Tony), “I’ll pull up the files on this mission, debrief my team and be en-route in approximately two hours.”
"So what's the plan, Cap? You gonna lay out a plan of attack to get into bed with me?" Tony grins, a smile which turns dazzling when Steve shakes his head fondly.
“Rhodey, I have an idea, an incredible one I think, and I need you to listen to me.” He took a deep breath, before launching into a long explanation. “Our world is so full of machines and non-human technology that we’re overflowing with it, and yet they’ll never be as effective as humans
One day, he thinks it was a Sunday, Peter came into the tower unexpectedly and, well. It wasn't a pretty sight, as Tony was (impressively) both drunk and hungover.
There was a moment of awkward silence, before Steve chuckled dryly. "Apologies Justin, I think that was a terrible attempt at humour."
Unfortunately, the blonde couldn't think of any of the better ideas Bucky was referring to. Steve has always stood by his love for motorbikes, but occasionally they can be entirely inconvenient. Such as now, when he had a vintage leather suitcase full of vital possessions.
Clint's smile somehow got even wider, and he high-fived Darcy. "You guys are gonna fit in so well, it'll be like you've always been here. Oh, right, you should park up round the side of the building and grab your cases. Then you-"
It had been a long time since Tony had smoked like this. Sure, he enjoyed a cigarette now and then, but he kicked the habit in his early twenties.
There was a tan biker jacket and a shiny black helmet placed neatly on the seat of the bike, both inevitably tailored to his measurements exactly.
“Make this an Iron Man mission. I’m with Team Delta currently in one of my cars, and Coulson doesn’t know it but he’s currently being autopiloted to Stark Tower.” He receives a glare from the man, and a resigned sigh before he took his hands of the wheel and sat back. “I need to do this with my technology, and I can’t have SHIELD involved if we’re going to figure out what he’s hiding. Tell Pierce I phoned you for a second opinion, or whatever, just make it happen so Agent Lewis can stop hacking Coulson’s office.”
At this point, Bucky burst into Steve's living room, flapping a sheet of paper with vicious anger. "What the actual fuck is this shit, Steve? We gotta bring our own documents 'nd everything!" Steve blinked twice, and picked up the list. Sure enough, it included their own proof of identity.
Tony lost his train of thought whilst worrying about coffee spillages in his ventilation shaft. He shook his head and tried to remember what he was saying. "Anyway, almost all of Avengers funding comes from my bank account. Surely I get a say if I'm gonna throw my money at you. Right?"
Pierce nodded and walked off, crowd parting for him. Tony truly rues the day Fury made Pierce the head of security for the Empire, the fucker just won’t leave him alone. With a silent prayer that SHIELD intel is incorrect for once, Tony parts the crowds himself to go and get his best friend, who was currently mingling with some generals and higher-ups of the military.
Clint laughed at the quickly forming pout on the receptionist's face. "Aw, don't be down. You'll find someone, it just takes time. Although I guess you don't have much of that."
"Well, time to face the prick." Bucky said, as the elevator came to a halt. Composing himself, Steve straightened his posture and stepped out of the lift, Bucky following closely behind.
So, it's the first chapter of the first fic. Thanks for botherin' with my antics, if ya think it's worth somethin' drop me some sweet kudos at the end. I'm thirsty for all of ya validation.
"Pepper, she and I… no. We. We were- strange? Together. I loved her with every fibre of my body, but…" He tails off, trying to find the words to continue. "But."
“Agent Maria Hill has always been the best of us,” Pierce began, and Tony was struggling to stop himself from clunking his head on the table. He’s always hated the man’s speeches. Regrettably, Pierce continued talking despite Tony’s internal objections. “and she is truly an integral member of this organisation. This is why I sent her on this mission that has sadly taken a turn for the worst.” He paused, probably just to be dramatic. “Due to her exceptional skill level, we know that even in her darkest hour she manages to contact us. Therefore, thanks to her impeccable track record, we have to assume she’s dead.”
“If we ignore pointless metaphors,” Romanoff spoke for the first time since she got in the car, “Clint has a point. Pierce is being shady, and the way he was looking for an excuse not to send the best STRIKE team and the tin can shows us he’s trying to cover something up.”
Pretty much all of the above parties were yelling at him, Rollins looked ready to hurt his fists on the Iron Man suit again, Ross was spitting over his paperwork in anger. But when he looked closer, he saw Team Delta in the corner, and they were decidedly not shouting. Coulson was looking at him blankly, a small glimpse of grief in how he was tightly gripping Barton’s wrist. Barton himself was looking a bit sick, and he was holding on to his superior like he’d keel over if he ever let go. And then there was Romanoff, who somehow was able to tell when she had his attention, who just shook her head once sharply. Tony released the faceplate to look right at her, tilting his head to the side slightly to ask for an explanation. She simply mouthed “You asked the right question.”
He shucked his suit jacket and shirt, leaving him in his slacks and undershirt, one of the ones with a space cut out for the arc reactor. Clint did a double take when he saw him.
On the first page was a short explanation of the school and its (public) aims. According to the document, SHIELD was a school for kids with a high intelligence, but that made some bad decisions.
He grabbed Coulson’s arm, and pointed at the sleek black Audi near the back of the lot, tapping a couple buttons on his highly customised top-of-the-range StarkWatch. The headlights flashed, signalling that it was unlocked. The man hesitated, before locking his own car back up again and heading quickly for the Audi.
“Their dedication, courage and fearless natures are why I am proud to award both Tony Stark and James Rhodes with a unique award, created just for them.”
Steve picked himself up off the concrete, wincing at a stab of pain in his shoulder. His eyes raised to meet the taller boy.
Darcy stepped forward, broadcasting perplexed happiness in every single mannerism. "Wait wait wait, you guys know each other? That's so cool!"
Steve covertly googled it, just to avoid the inevitable rant it would lead to if neither of them knew what Hammer was talking about.
Steve nodded, swinging a leg over the side of the Harley. He turned the key and gave the bike a couple of revs; Bucky took this as a signal that he was ready to go, so he pulled out of the parking lot with more speed than was strictly necessary. Steve smiled fondly and followed suit, feeling the bike lurch forward.
"Uh, yep! Definitely. That's what we're doing. Right now. And that's what we're talking about. Yep." Darcy dug herself further into a hole with every word, and Clint didn't even have the decency to look embarrassed by the conversation.
Bucky burst out laughing. "Something tells me we're gonna fit in here just fine, Stevie. We can all be disasters together."
Before Steve can say another word, the flustered billionaire is rushing towards the elevator, asking JARVIS to take him to the workshop and lock it down.
Before he can spiral even further into mania, the lift doors open to reveal Steve Rogers in an extremely well-fitted suit.
“Hey J, what do you reckon we should call this project?” He called out, directing his gaze towards the ceiling as if expecting his AI to appear in a corporeal form.
A few seconds later, he realises that this may be a terrible idea. What does he do? What does he say? Is he ready for this?
“Damned if I know. Pierce sent me as a side-piece to Delta to finish the mission she apparently died on and try to retrieve Hill’s body, but here’s the thing; he has no concrete evidence she died, and he was trying to stop us from being the ones to go.”
"Killing me with poetry." Steve mutters, but he spoke too close to the microphone and Tony smiles a small, hopeful smile.
"Hi- Hey. Steve. You good? Cause I'm good. One hundred and ten percent good, no, twenty." He starts rambling, not trusting himself to leave any silence.
"So, my two best men! For you, I have the best mission the CIA could possibly give you." Hammer proclaimed, luckily not noticing the look the two friends shared at this. "Your mission is based off of my personal intel and tenacity, so you know it's gonna be good, right? Right? This is a real fun one."
He's always loved motorbikes. The freedom that comes with them, the way you become one with the machine and road. Feeling the harsh wind against his body, pushing aside all his anxieties and worries, feeling them blow far away. Steve sometimes imagines them lying on the roadside, left behind and unimportant. Unfortunately, the busy streets of Queens are miles away from the ethereality of dusty highways at twilight. Snapping himself out of it, Steve focuses on Bucky's Audi in front of him, making sure he stays close enough that nobody tries to push in between them.
“Finally, my third red flag was how quick the Director was to call Hill’s death. His explanation was-“
The drive up to the school was uneventful, save a couple of traffic jams and some frustrated beeping from Bucky. (Since becoming an agent, his road rage has slowly got worse as nothing he ever does could revoke his license. Steve has never worked out whether he's actually angry or finds it funny to fake being angry.)
After that, Tony drank less, which was good. Unfortunately, he also decided that a good replacement for his poisonous drink was something toxic to inhale instead.
“Huh.” He says eloquently, “Um. Interest, yes. Oh fuck it, hey Steve, can I be your boyfriend despite my current emotional instability? ‘Cause I really want to kiss you.”
Sometimes Tony tries bargaining with the universe, asking the sun to stay high in the sky, begging even. But the universe does not make bargains, and so every night as the moon makes its appearance, he curses the sunset and brightens the lights.
Tony had somehow managed to drag him into a hallway to the side, next to a door that read “employees only”. He kissed Steve again and turned the vibrator back on, amping it straight up to the middle setting.
Bruce sighed, opening up his first aid kit to pull out a few things he needed to get to work fixing Tony’s cuts. “This might sting a little.”
Finally they had relented after offering the team very strict instructions on what needed to be done for the billionaire.
“Why haven’t you turned into the green monster?” Tony questioned the doctor in earnest. “I want to see what he looks like. I bet he’s huuuuge.”
Steve let the silence take over as he thought, unsure of the answer even though he’d thought of it plenty of times before. Steve shifted when Tony’s hand ran down his back, from shoulder to the dip in his back, and took a deep breath. “Probably not,” he admitted. “I don’t think that life is one we were meant to have together. I’ll always love her, but I can’t spend my life wondering ‘what if’. Brooklyn is my world. There are things here that I’m not willing to give up and there are things there that she’s not willing to give up either. This is where life brought us both. It’s where we’re meant to be for whatever reason.”
Steve pocketed the taser with a huff. “Just the once.” He surveyed the room one last time before gesturing for Bucky to follow him down another hallway. “We should do another sweep of the place, Tony has to b—“
He stared at Steve for a moment longer before looking at Pepper once more. “I think Obie is involved. I obviously don’t have the proof and I hate that I’m having to think this way, but I think he’s involved. For all I know he was involved in the plane crash too. It’s just a little too convenient that my plane went down after I told Obie my intentions for the company. I have to lay low for awhile. I’m sure I won’t be able to go unnoticed for too long, but I need your help. I need you to find anything you can. Anything at all, Pepper. Look through company spendings, emails, anything you can get your hands on. I hate putting this on you, but you’re one of the few people I think I can fully trust.”
Tony grabbed the box of tissues from the nightstand to wipe up his mess as Steve removed his condom and tied it before throwing it into the waste basket. Once finished he pulled Tony against him and wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist.
A smile quirked Steve’s lips. “You weren’t letting me into the workshop through the door so I used magic.”
High school was almost over. Just one more semester and they'd be away from these idiots forever. She might not be best buds with Steve, but they were still friends and he was the last person to deserve scorn from anyone else in that god forsaken school.
“Tony, you were supposed to be on a plane to Japan! I’ve got shareholders breathing down my neck because you missed this meeting, which I might remind you, is the one that was rescheduled because you were in the hospital for the first one.”
Tony balled his hands into fists at his sides, eyes coming up only to narrow at Steve. “Because I asked you to! Because I paid you to.”
“You’re doing so good,” Tony whispered into Steve’s ear before nibbling on his earlobe. “So good for me, baby.”
Steve grabbed Tony’s arm. “I’ll go. You…just get somewhere safe, Tony. We’ll handle the rest. You’re not—“
Tony eventually did open his eyes and loudly protested when medical tried to take him away. He held on tightly to Steve’s hand. He had protested weakly and demanded to be sent home because he wasn’t going to wake up in a hospital on Christmas morning.
Steve slammed his body back around the corner and pressed the com to his ear. “Bucky. I need you to meet me. Coordinates coming your way. The rest of you move in as soon as possible. Stark is still in the wind, find him.”
He dispensed the beers to his own bandmates and drank up. The first thing he noticed, which sadly wasn’t Tony, was the fact that their lead singer was, in fact, sporting a plastic Viking helmet much to the amusement of pretty much everyone in the room with them. He was also stunned to hear the guy address the audience in a fashion that did not sync up with the lingo of today. If there was anyone Steve could ever bond with over feeling out of place, it was this guy, but he seemed to enjoy audience reactions to it.
Except maybe Thor. He was from another realm, so he was a stranger too. Natasha and Clint. Once upon a time they had well-hidden secrets. They had each other and perhaps they were all the other needed. He still wasn’t sure how to classify their relationship. Banner, of course, had his own unique monster to deal with. Alone.
Tony’s glad he picked the dark spot to dance because Steve isn’t holding it together as well as he was wanting to. The genius was proud though. He rocks his hips a bit harder, adding the pressure against Steve’s cock he knows the blond is seeking and it isn’t long before the soldier is practically shaking in his arms, high on the sensations, a fine sheen of sweat covering his body that leaves his shirt clinging to his muscles in all the right places.
“You. Are. Unbelievable,” Pepper bit out. “This entire time, Tony. All this time you were out with the mafia or whatever they call themselves you never thought to pick up a phone and say, ‘hey, I’m not dead?’”
“I love you too, old timer.” Tony was smiling. It was the first time either of them had said it and they apparently couldn’t say that part without a little bit of snark thrown in there.
Steve tilted his head a bit. “It’s not a good idea to trust someone so quickly, especially considering where he just came from.”
“Romanoff, Barnes, Barton and Banner you’ve already at least met once or twice.” Steve jerked his head towards a bigger blond. “This is Thor,” and then pointed at a dark skinned, smiling man who had a falcon of all creatures resting on his shoulders, “and this is Sam Wilson.” They’ll be working with Bucky to gather intel on the warehouse you were kept in. Any and all information you have on where you were kept should be noted and passed on to these three. Romanoff and Barton will handle gathering information on Stane and his connection with HYDRA and Schmidt.”
So he was back and he wanted to date Tony, but he wanted to move slow. He was still old-fashioned that way and Tony was oddly all right with it. So he’d have to wait awhile for the sex to happen. Big deal.
Rhodey rolled his eyes. “Yeah right. If you think you’re getting out of that lecture once this is all said and done, then you have another thing coming.” Rhodey held up his hand when Tony moved to interject. “Ah ah, later. Now, tell us how we can help end this as soon as possible.”
And it was at that moment that Loki suddenly appeared in front of them. Natasha stood up straight and glowered at him. Bruce and Clint found themselves easing toward the path that existed between Loki and Tony at the moment. Steve clenched his jaw.
Steve laughed softly and pulled Tony into a kiss before the man could keep talking. Tony would most likely never admit that he screamed like a teenage girl on the inside. He was going to take what he could get so he responded to the kiss almost immediately. Maybe he lived in a world where Steve Rogers wouldn’t get tired of him, wouldn’t leave him, but he was too scared to actually hope for that. Living in the moment was what this was about. Perhaps it’d take him somewhere great, as long as Steve was with him.
“Anthony Stark, you son of a bitch! You don’t call, you don’t write, you…” he stopped. “I’m not hugging you.” He looked at the man behind his best friend and raised his eyebrows. “Hi. James Rhodes. Everyone just calls me Rhodey.” He held his hand out for Steve who shook it firmly with a confused smile.
They’d gone down this road frequently and they always fought afterwards. They always fought anyway, but those intimate moments hadn’t helped much. They were good. Always good. Tony never wanted to let it be known that he was the one who wanted more from Steve though. He knew what he was and where he stood, but he’d stopped trying to deny to himself that Steve had stopped being a booty call for him and had become someone he craved and someone he wanted to wake up with every morning. He wasn’t sure Steve even really liked him all that much but he was going to take what he could get as long as he could.
The blonde did laugh at this and reached out to ruffle Tony’s hair without even thinking about it. “Yes, I know. You’re very smart.”
Tony stood up then, a yawn he’d been suppressing finally forcing its way out. “Well that’s my cue. Night.” And he walked out without another word.
The door was open and Tony was waiting patiently at the piano, but he was standing against the side of it rather than sitting down. He had his arms crossed and an excited smile on his face. Steve returned the smile and set his guitar against the wall.
He looked up at Steve, surprised to see how genuine his smile was. “Yeah. Of course.” He smiled. “Anytime, Cap.”
Steve groaned, pinched the bridge of his nose and shut his eyes. When he opened them his gaze caught on the Newspaper in the center of the table, untouched and brimming with information Steve could probably use. Also, maybe he had time for a quick game of Sudoku in the back.
“Great. I’m stranded on Gilligan’s Island,” he muttered under his breath. “At least there’s a hammock.”
Pepper’s breathing was controlled but heavy as she hugged Tony, her eyes puffy and cheeks splotchy with color. She pushed him back after a few moments; her hands on Tony’s shoulders as she took in his face in silence before nodding and smiling, satisfied with what she saw.
Steve’s eye caught on the little rectangular green screen in the center of the bots chest when it briefly paused near a wall. “Sergeant Nuts-N-Bolts,” he read aloud, sounding the words out before mouthing them quietly to himself.
The next few weeks went by and Steve’s moodiness level increased by 100 percent. His teammates had tried to engage him in conversation on several occasions, but his temperament was everywhere and no one no longer knew what to expect from him. Most interactions occurred when he instigated them.
Tony pushed the papers away until they were scattered. “He’s been trying to make me a part of a war I didn’t even know existed. God—these emails alone— and I did nothing.“
Tony groaned against Steve’s lips and he immediately began working the soldier’s pants open, hand finding its way down to Steve’s super soldier member. He chuckled after thinking of that and Steve nipped at his bottom lip, stroking up and down the genius’ shaft. He slid his thumb over the slit teasing out a drop of precum and rubbing it over the cock head. Tony nipped at Steve’s lip this time as he worked his hand down the soldier’s shaft, squeezing a little harder as he got closer to the base. His hand stuttered. Steve had managed to use his other hand to work his pants down further before it too joined the party, cupping at his balls, rolling them in his warm palm. Then his hand inched down, back behind the balls rubbing at the stretch of skin just before Tony’s hole. Tony clenched, his whole body shivering with pleasure then stuttering as it tried to both thrust up and back onto Steve’s hand.
Tony eventually pulled away to catch his breath, a look of discomfort flitting across his face and then it was gone a split second later. “How do you feel about a New Years wedding?”
And then it was time to eat. Praise Odin. Tony could only hope this moment of utter humiliation (seriously, emotions were not his thing, okay?) would be forgotten or at least put away for the time being.
Steve spoke from behind him, quiet but determined. “Tony, we need to go. The building…” and Tony hadn’t noticed before but the structure did seem to shaking just the slightest bit, smoke still visible out of the windows. The fire was moving down from the top floors.
Tony whistled low and impressed, elbowed Rhodey in the side. “He’s like every action movie star you’ve ever seen, right? Got our very own Captain America walking about.”
“I’ve got some business to take care of. Is there anything you need, Steve the genie?” The irony of that question didn’t go over Tony’s head.
Another teacher, Clint Barton, nodded at the television. “They’re still looking but they haven’t found a body, so I think he’s still alive.”
Steve looked away, shaking his head. “I can see your point.” He roughly poked the ketchup with his fries. “It’s not like you have friends here that might want to see you or anything. I don’t see any reason for you to stay at all. Not when you can go surround yourself with smarter people who can actually keep up with you.”
Once all the children were seated, Mister Steve smiled and Tony sighed. This just wasn’t fair. Maybe he was going to be a lame storyteller and maybe he was a jerk because really, he was far too attractive to be a really good person as well.
Tony hurried to help Pepper to the door and handing her a thumb drive, “You have two now. Find a computer, it doesn’t matter where, and upload everything.”
Tony had not tried to contact Steve once though and Steve was sure he’d lost him forever. He did not want that to hurt as much as it did, but knowing that Tony had an actual career outside of The Avengers and knowing that Tony was well-known and that he was a prodigy...well Steve just didn’t see how he’d held Tony’s interest even as long as he had. Tony was on a level of intelligence that placed him out in the stratosphere, living high above those who were just average. Maybe average was the wrong word. Everyone had their strengths and their weaknesses, it just seemed that Tony’s strengths far outweighed his weaknesses and it left Steve feeling like he would never be able to keep up with him, or that Tony would get bored with him fast and move on to someone else.
“Do you really want me to sit here and wax poetic about you for the rest of the night or do you want me to show you?” Steve arched an eyebrow.
Tony tossed his good arm over his face while the other was held close to his chest in what wasn’t the most comfortable position possible. Tony shuffled and huffed, engaged in a game of kick the covers until they rested somewhere between the edge of the bed and the floor. It wasn’t long until he found himself pulling them back up and suddenly it wasn’t as comfortable a bed as he thought. The cushioning was too soft, suffocating really, the blankets too warm and then not warm enough, and his pillow seemed to sink into itself until Tony’s neck felt ready to snap at its odd angle.
Steve rolled his eyes. “I never tried to sell you on this lifestyle, Buck. You followed me cluckin’ around like a mother hen.”
“You know—“ the brunet said, voice careful, like he was afraid to ruin whatever moment they were having, “you can call me Tony more often. I mean, it sounds good coming from your mouth.”
“I am an old man. I know I was stuck in that bottle for years. I don’t know how long, but past the point of what is considered normal for human life, I think.”
He pulled away from the kiss eventually and rested his forehead against Steve’s. “What have you been up to today?”
Natasha was sifting through the decorations littering the floor. “Someone else is in charge of hanging the lights. I’ll end up strangling someone with them if they become too knotted up in the process.”
Steve crossed his arms over his chest and quietly positioned himself against the wall. Yeah he was most definitely over their silly fight.
Tony picked himself up from Steve’s lap and then held out a hand for the blond, pulling him up and kissing him hard before leading him toward the bathroom so they could attempt to clean up. Steve was silent as they made their way in and didn’t speak again until they were both washing their hands off.
Steve sighed and closed up his sketchbook, putting it in his bag. “I don’t care. I don’t. Hammer is an asshole for outing me to the whole school, but that’s not even the problem. It’s not like I’m ashamed, but I guess it still hurts to hear what everyone thinks they are whispering behind my back.”
Tony had always assumed that he’d go out in a great act of heroism for the world to see. Sort of like when he flew that nuke into space and it was broadcast on every single channel. He was Iron Man and it was risky so he knew what he was getting into and there was always the possibility that he wouldn’t make it home alive the next time. He was okay with that though. Not to the point that he actually
Steve smiled against Tony’s lips as he let out as involuntary moan. “Fuck.” Tony panted as he felt Steve’s searching fingers slide back and slide across his hole. Steve gave Tony’s lips one last kiss before sliding down his body, he let his breath gust over the head of Tony’s shaft before taking it into his mouth.
Steve quickly put the jacket on and shoved the flyer into his pocket. “Are you sure you don’t need me tonight?”
“What about The Avengers? Your schedule is so booked that it’s a wonder you have any time to do it now.”
“I’m so glad your sense of humor has decided to come back at this very moment. I was starting to forget that you’re a huge smartass.”
Tony lifted an eyebrow in amusement as he watched the kid slowly pull himself up from the ground and dropped his hand. “I’m sure you can, but it doesn’t hurt to get some help anyway. I’m Tony Stark.”
As the footsteps got louder, Steve’s finger got closer to the trigger, prepared to pull it until he made out a familiar glint of metal. He sighed quietly; it was just Bucky. He lowered his weapon and spoke lowly once Bucky was in range. “What have you got?”
The blonde followed Tony out of the room and down the halls until they reached what Natasha called the science dungeon, a project they’d originally intended for Bruce but had done just as nicely for Tony. When they arrived, Tony got right down to brass tacks, explaining everything using words that Steve could follow or stopping to explain when he couldn’t. He circled Steve, instructing him to open up various compartments and watching patiently as Steve took a look around inside of the bot. Overall, it was a very enlightening and informative lesson, one where Steve actually found himself enjoying the other man's presence.
Natasha and Clint made their way silently into the shadows, leaving the others to wait for the all clear.
“Good.” He stopped what he was doing to give Steve his attention. “Is something else bothering you?”
Natasha returned his iPod to him and nodded her head forward to let him know his answer was on the screen.
Steve made the last few steps so that he was close enough to place a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “But you didn’t. You were stronger than them, better than them. You escaped and you made your way here all on your own, Stark. That’s something only a small few can accomplish.” Steve squeezed once and let his hand fall. “You have more friends in your corner than you think-- Pepper, Rhodey, us – all we want is to keep you safe. That’s what we’re in this for now, not what you can make us, but for you.”
Bucky shook his head. “I don’t know if that’s a good idea. No one really appreciated being sniped with paint pellets that one time.”
Case in point, this weeks sensational article was all about the possibility of Tony Stark’s alleged trip to Afghanistan where he and his company were testing their weapons on small towns when Stark wasn’t busy entertaining his latest conquest between the sheets, who was rumored to be the wife of a man killed during one of Stark's latest rounds of testing.
“I think you should be asking yourself what Tony doesn’t know about you, Steve.” That was Bucky. “I’m willing to bet he doesn’t know half as much about the rest of us as a group than he knows about you alone.”
“Just let me find you something else to wear befor--” Tony sighed. “You have got to stop doing that.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Big deal. I wanted to go with you. I was just giving you a hard time because I didn’t want to seem too eager to spend time with you.” Wait he just said that out loud. Oh no.
Steve looked down, pawing at the back of his neck. “Not right now,” he murmured. “I need some sleep.”
Steve groaned tiredly into his palm, only looking up once he heard a knocking at his still closed office door.
Steve rubbed at the back of his neck and looked at a spot somewhere to the left of Tony’s head. “What I guess I…” He let out a hard breath, muttering to himself. “Come on, Rogers. Get it together.”
He didn’t fill Tony in a whole lot on what he’d done and Tony had been fine with that. He knew Steve needed his privacy and Tony spent a lot of time trying to make sure he didn’t hound Steve for a date. If he wasn’t ready he wasn’t ready. And if he changed his mind, Tony didn’t really want to think of that possibility either.
Steve looked with wide eyes between the building, still standing in most places but destroyed completely in others, and Tony who was smiling, a small thing but still there, up at the building. Steve settled on just staring, astonished, at Tony after a moment of useless gaping.
Steve’s head rose slowly, a faint noise making its way toward him. It sounded like...whirring of some sort. Possibly a remote control car like the ones he’d seen kids play with up and down the streets, or the ones he’d seen Clint and Thor racing up and down the hallways despite his warnings. Steve narrowed his eyes toward where the noise was coming from, he’d fallen over enough of those cars to last a lifetime and wasn’t in the mood for a repeat performance. Lord only knows the two of them wouldn’t clean up after themselves.
He felt the soldier nod, but it wasn’t very confident and Tony felt helpless. He couldn’t stand the thought of Steve reliving a nightmare, worrying that he was going to miss another 70 years of his life again. He, instead, did the only thing he could think of and slid his hand to the back of Steve’s neck, pressing a kiss to his lips. Very cold lips. He felt like this would be a good place to start.
The kids listened intently after that, enamored by Mister Steve’s very excellent storytelling skills. Tony couldn’t make himself stop listening too. The blond was telling it very well. He’d allowed the children to get a little silly during the wild rumpus because the wild things did. Before long he reached the end of the story and shut the book with another bright smile. The children and parents clapped and then Mister Steve engaged them in a small discussion about the story.
Steve snorted as he turned off the car. “Please, Tony. I don’t take dates home with me on the first date.”
“Steve’s been through a lot, Stark. He’s lost a lot of people. Don’t be another person he ends up losing.” Clint continued to play.
Thor spoke quietly from his seat. “We must be swift with our actions, survivors would only greaten the chance for regrouping. While I am loathe to take the lives of others, even in this business, there is much at stake if we allow these men to walk away with their wits about them.”
Tony wordlessly handed it over and watched while Steve tried to figure his way around a highly advanced Starkphone. He finally found the contacts and added his number to it before shooting a text to his own phone from it so he could program Tony’s into his.
“Still alive,” several voices called out all at once. Steve nodded even though nobody was around to see it.
“Four shovel talks is just a little overboard. I feel like I’m going to mess things up even worse than I normally do.”
A mutter. “Great.” He cleared his throat and set the blowtorch down, replacing it with a hammer. “Let’s do this.”
Tony blinked, a slow smile forming on his lips. Suddenly it was clear. And easier than he expected it to be. “I love you, Steve.”
Steve shut Tony up with a kiss. A kiss that was naughty and rather promising of things to come. Unless Steve was a huge tease. God he really hoped not.
Steve searched his brain for what to say. “Of course you can come, but...well, we can’t take you to your parents. We’re going to Stark Tower though. Do you want to see it?”
Tony loved his son with all his heart, but there were days he longed for more sleep. His mother had left him on Tony’s figurative doorstep (actually the lobby at the front desk while the receptionist wasn’t looking) with a note stating that she couldn’t afford to care for the child because she didn’t have the time, that his name was Peter and provided a birth certificate as well. He got a paternity test and then confronted Peter’s mother after it was proven that Peter was his and their conversation did not go well to say the least. She was busy trying to pursue her own career in something or another and thought Tony would be better off raising the child himself since he was a billionaire and had the money to do so. Forget that he was running a large company and worked his ass off to earn what he had.
He saluted and turned to walk toward the limo, pausing briefly to turn around and blow Steve a kiss.
Steve let out a long sigh. “I don’t know how it happened. I kept telling myself that I’d tell you tomorrow and tomorrow happened and I convinced myself to put it off until the next day. Look, it’s fine that you don’t feel the same way, it’s why I never said anything. Like I said, friendship. Don’t want to lose that.”
“We’ll be dancing out there, pressed so close to each other while the plug pounds against your prostate. No one will even know that you’re being fucked while we’re surrounded. No one will pay attention to the way you’re going to hump my leg until you’re coming in your pants and gasping desperately. They won’t know that you’re going to end up coming more than once and that you’re going to be such a good boy the entire time. Does that sound good to you?”
What occurred next was...not normal by any means. The bottle vibrated before a blue smoke began to billow out, followed by a man. A man who was man sized. Tony jumped back almost a foot and gaped. This man was just sitting in midair, his arms crossed and a smile on his face.
Bucky slapped his hand to his chest, right over his heart. “That hurt, bro. I thought we had something special.”
After a long moment of silence in which Tony was sure he could have caught flies in his mouth because of how far his jaw had dropped, he picked up the remnants of what little dignity he had left. “I can give you a list of fifty reasons why I’m the worst person for you to be with.”
Sam cut in before Steve had a chance to respond. “I’ve got eyes on Rumlow.” He sounded almost excited, pent up on the chance to get revenge after their last confrontation left both men injured. “Now this is what I’m talking about. Time to show our buddy ol’ Crossbones what the Falcon is made of.”
Tony couldn’t take his eyes off this guy who he assumed was Mister Steve. He was really...hunky. Blond hair, bright blue eyes and built like a superhero, but he was dressed like a grandfather which sort of added to Mister Steve’s attractiveness.
“Great. I really appreciate it.” He stopped when he was at the bottom of the stairs. “Oh and, Stark? I’ll do more than taser you to death.”
“Okay, so if you fought over something stupid, then why aren’t you doing something about it instead of sitting around doing nothing?”
Steve rolled his eyes. “I told you it was something stupid. We both overreacted to something, said things we shouldn’t have said. I fucked it up even worse by accidentally telling his father about him being in a band in the first place.”
Tony glanced back at Steve for just a second before looking at Rhodey. He brought one hand town to touch his thigh until Rhodey put his attention back on him, smiling softly until Rhodey’s mistrustful look dissipated, leaving nothing but unmistakable worry. Tony patted his thigh once more before pulling away, placing his hand back on the table. “Yes and no. A little yes.” Rhodey raised a concerned brow and Tony conceded, spreading his hands flat. “Okay, mostly yes. I’m fine though. Steve—they’re okay. Just—Don’t worry about me. I’m perfectly fine. Better than.”
Pepper’s face fell to confusion even as Rhodey’s clouded over with anger. Rhodey’s hand twitched at his side, as if he wanted to reach out to Tony but couldn’t. “Yeah,” he said, voice clipped. “We’ve got them labeled as possible domestic terrorists back at the base. They’ve got a lot of shady shit going on but we haven’t been able to nail them with anything concrete just yet.”
Steve continued to stroke lazily milking Tony’s cock until the last drop dribbled out and his body shivered with the oversensitivity. He fell once again, landing next to Tony, kissing him again.
Tony’s brow furrowed. “Is it just me or is there something off about him? I mean I obviously don’t know him very well at all, but he’s struggling with something.”
“You haven’t exactly proven it otherwise. You live in a huge house. You’ve never had to fight to get to where you are today! Compared to everyone in the world who has to work to survive, you have it incredibly easy! You don’t even realize it! You’re just a rich spoiled brat who wants to make sure you can fit in with us by talking about how hard it is for you, how you’re struggling with the amazing skill you were given and how hard must it be to have everything handed to you when there are people out there who would kill to make a small percentage of what you’ve already got! You don’t even think about this!”
Tony huffed. “I don’t have to do anything. This is a stupid Christmas tradition and I don’t like it when a piece of foliage dictates whether or not I should kiss someone.”
The child gave Clint a glare that erased all doubt that they were looking at Tony Stark. Fury looked down at Tony for a moment. “Our best guess is that Loki got to him before he even attacked the city. He seems to have no actual memory of his time as an adult, so he will not recognize any of you.”
“Sometimes when I go to sleep at night, I’m back at the train, watching Bucky fall off. But sometimes it’s you or Natasha or Clint or anyone else I care about. And you all have the same fate as Bucky. All of you. I can’t do anything to save you from that.”
Tony smirked, obviously overhearing. “Kinky. Though, it might make things a little harder when you need me to answer your questions.”
Steve studied Tony’s face for a moment as he thought this over. “I don’t think I will, but even if I do it’s because no one is flawless. That doesn’t necessarily mean I’d stop liking you.”
Steve was with him every step of the way, determined that if someone was going to work on Bucky while he was in one of his most vulnerable states, then he was going to be there to make sure nobody tried to pull anything over on his oldest friend. And, yeah, he’d gone in expecting it from the infamous Tony Stark, but about 4 appointments in, Steve finally figured he didn’t have much to worry about at all. At least not when it came to Stark screwing over Bucky. No, his attention was placed elsewhere, about 80% focused on Bucky’s new arm and the other 20% focused on flirting endlessly with Steve.
For awhile all that existed between them was heavy breathing, both unable to move. Finally Tony managed to roll off because he didn’t think either of them would enjoy being stuck to each other. Once he felt like he wouldn’t collapse upon moving, he walked into the bathroom, returning moments later with a wash cloth, wiping them both clean.
“I’m sure they’re just swell, Tony.” He sat up as he remembered the rest of the team was in the room still and they were all watching Tony and Steve intently. “So, who wants to go home?”
Steve watched as the others left, Bucky placing his arm around Natasha’s shoulders, a kiss to her temple and a suggestion of relaxing for a bit as they made their way out of the room.
In hindsight, Tony probably should have worded that a bit differently. Steve was excited to learn there was a zoo so he dragged Tony through all of it, and he was almost certain that Steve had been communicating with half the animals there. Was that a genie thing?
Natasha smiled. “I was surprised by how easy he got off the hook on that one. Pepper usually accepts no excuses. She must have been pretty scared.”
Steve leans his head back until it’s against Tony’s and whimpers. “God, yes,” he moans, placing a hand over the one Tony has on his clothed cock and presses it even harder against the hardness. “Please,” he begs.
Tony nodded, laughing a little. “Or something.” He might be persuaded to get used to this. You know, one day.
It wasn’t often Steve came across someone who enjoyed some of the older tunes. He knew better than to judge a book by its cover because despite being in a grunge band, Steve favored the older generations. He favored music that came from the 20s, 30s, 40s in ways he could never manage to feel for most of what he heard today. Maybe he was just a silly romantic, but he had always felt like he’d connected more with that era than any other.
This time it’s Steve who’s smirking as Tony finds himself becoming an incoherent mess. Steve’s fingers tightening slightly as his fist slides up to the head and loosens as they sink back down. Tony could barely hold himself up any longer and let his head fall onto Steve’s neck, panting and groaning into it. He knew he wasn’t going to last much longer, especially when his own hip started to thrust back and forth, adding to the mounting pleasure Steve’s thick fingers were giving him. He’s boneless now, and shivering in pleasure, and there’s no way he’ll last. And god it's so good.
The pleasant feeling only double, triple, quadrupled when Tony placed his hand over top of Steve’s where it rested on the gear shift. “Really, Steve. Thank you.” Steve’s mouth went dry, any words he’d hoped to say falling away faster than he could keep up with.
“I’m so sorry, Steve!” His voice was broken. “I’m sorry. I’m not...I don’t deserve you. I’m not good enough...I made a mistake and I don’t know why you aren’t disgusted with me.”
“Living dangerously then. If you don’t make me best man then I won’t speak to you for at least six months.”
Tony’s mouth snapped shut and he gave Steve a quick look that he hoped was subtle but still read as SHUT UP RIGHT NOW. Steve lifted his eyebrows but didn’t say another word.
Tony actually blushed a little but answered as if it was plainly obvious. “Because you’re a hero. That’s why.”
Bruce began scribbling furiously at the pages. “What about here?” He gestured at another stack of papers. “If I change that then it would alter—“
Pepper just nodded as she stared at Steve, taking her seat again. “That really helps the outfit make so much more sense. Tony!” She lightly backhanded his arm. “I thought you picked up a hooker or something!”
Pepper gripped Tony’s hand as Rhodey’s hand squeezed Tony’s shoulder. “We expect him back in one piece, Captain. Don’t make us regret leaving him in your care for the time being.”
Steve covered his mouth with his palm to hide the smile that broke out on his face at both the teasing and the wounded look Tony shot at both his friends.
“Didn’t you hear me?” Tony asked slowly as if speaking to someone who was very stupid or slow. “Besides, this is your fault!”
Pepper and Tony turned their attention to Steve. They’d forgotten he was there and hearing everything they were saying.
Steve sighed and sat back, leaning against the chair he was sitting in and crossing his arms over his chest. “I’m not moping.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Okay. I’ve never had a decent relationship with anyone in my life. I’m good at scaring people away. I’m selfish and…”
“I’ve got eyes on Stane,” he whispered breathlessly into his comm, pulling out his gun and ducking behind the desk when a SWAT team went barreling past him. “He’s got a woman with him, strawberry blonde hair, fair skin. She’s Tony’s PA. I’m going after them, Barton, Wilson, get up high and make sure no one is exiting the building that shouldn’t be. The rest of you, continue to help keep everything contained.”
They were both smiling, just lightly swaying with each other while strangers came and went. The next thing he knew, Tony was kissing him, holding onto him like he would never let go. Steve was more than okay with that though. He sort of understood the feeling.
Tony scoffed, his face contorting. “Now just one damn second, Steve! Where is this even coming from? Everyone should have been able to guess that this whole rock band thing was just a thing, a phase. I have no intention of actually sticking with it. I have to grow up at some point!”
Steve must have been down too because there was no movement. There was just Obadiah standing up with a shit eating grin on his face.
They both stared at each other for a bit longer than necessary, faces just inches apart when Peter let out a whoop and found himself surrounded by a large pile of books from Steve and Tony. That was among the many many gifts Peter had also received from Natasha and Pepper and Happy and Clint and Bruce and Thor.
He got as far as swiping the screen before he heard heavy feet racing down the hall. “Steve!” Steve turned in time to see Clint barreling through the door, face red with exertion. “We’re moving out, come on!”
“You kicked him? Why the hell would you kick him?” Clint hollered, looking more scandalized than Steve thought the admission warranted
Tony was flipping through the pages and stopping on the ones that were finished. He smiled wide and held up the sketchbook and Steve had to avoid facepalming. He’d gone home after double date night with Bucky and sketched Tony as he’d seen him playing the piano from memory and now he felt like a dumbass for even forgetting the drawing was in there. He was definitely blushing now and waited for the smart ass remark he was sure would come next.
“He came back to town several hours before Loki returned. I can only assume this is why it did not seem to bother you that he was not present for the battle.”
The redhead had to free both her hands to massage her temples. “Tony, I don’t have the patience to deal with another drug incident. What did you take this time?” she asked with the wariness of someone who has dealt with moments like these more than she cared to.
Tony was grinning from ear to ear and didn’t stop until he heard Pepper clear her throat. She and Happy were waiting for him to get into the car so they could get back to the hotel. She had informed the attendees of his exit citing that he had to get an early start in the morning. Not a lie considering he had a plane to catch, but maybe not as early as he wanted them to believe.
Tony didn't look up from the word search he was playing. Steve had gotten him into doing them and Tony found he enjoyed doing them as long as he timed himself. "Yeah?"
Tony shrugged away from Steve and covered his face with his hands. “I do and can we not talk about it?”
They were playing some kind of game and after today, Steve was determined more than ever to be the team coming out on top.
When Tony finally did get there, his mouth dropped open in silent awe. There was no shock that he was the subject of the drawing, but the emotions that seemed to be put behind it made his heart flutter. He realized that Steve already knew, and that it didn’t matter if he wasn’t able to vocalize it.
The genius quirked an eyebrow and pocketed the thumb drive. “Okay. Call them to assemble or whatever it is you do and I’ll get things set up.”
Steve wrapped an arm around Tony’s shoulders and hugged him. “I think it’s perfect the way it is, Tony. I can’t build anything like that.”
Steve grinned. “As you wish.” He pulled his fingers out and Tony moaned sadly at the loss, but Steve quickly rolled the condom down his own cock, and letting it rest against Tony’s hole. He leaned down to kiss Tony just as he began to push his way in slowly. One of Tony’s hands cupped Steve’s neck, pulling him down for a harder kiss. Once Steve was all the way in, he stopped, pulling away from Tony’s lips to pant against his neck.
He felt so much guilt over all of this that he didn’t even think he deserved to try and offer up any sort of explanation to Steve. He didn’t even know what he’d try to say to him.
As far as first kisses go, it was a little more on the desperate side than the romantic side, but it was everything Steve wanted at that moment.
“Hey,” Bucky chimed in, pointing a finger at the genius with his good hand. “I can still throttle you with this hand, punk.”
Tony realized he’d put his foot in his mouth when Steve flinched. “Joking. It was a joke. You know what a joke is. I hope you know what a joke is. Considering you’ve got the whole smart ass angle going for you, I can only assume you know very well what a joke is. So are you ready to go or are we going to keep standing here?”
As the team (minus Tony naturally) sat down for their debriefing at S.H.I.E.L.D. after another surprise visit from Loki, Steve eyed Fury as the director paced back and forth before deciding to address the team. If anyone else thought this behavior was strange, no one said anything.
While Tony sat in the back room staring at the piano and waiting he began composing a new piece in his mind. He wasn’t sure where it was coming from or what even brought it on, but he knew he would have to write it quickly so he could perform it at his next concerto. He loved to make sure he always added something new and different to the mix. He loved it even more when his father had no idea what Tony was going to do. He might not enjoy the yelling. He knew Howard knew they were great pieces, but Howard absolutely hated not knowing what Tony was going to do at all times. He liked surprises and new discoveries and Howard just wanted to make sure Tony continued to maintain the integrity of the Stark name.
Steve obeys Tony’s order, hips moving over Tony’s thigh as he dances. Tony slowly slides his hands over Steve’s back, down to his waist, and then to his ass where he gives a few encouraging squeezes that he knows jostles the plug inside of him. He doesn’t miss the way a flush starts to creep up Steve’s neck or the way his movements against Tony’s leg become more erratic.
Steve held up his hand in a halting motion, “Let me get this out first and then you can speak, I promise.” Tony nodded and Steve took a deep breath and then—promptly fell silent.
“A few HYDRA goons, no sign of Schmidt. We didn’t engage, stayed in the shadows when we could. As far as we can tell, no one noticed our presence. They had a skeleton crew out there, making repairs rather than abandoning their location. The ratio of unaware civilians to HYDRA henchmen was unclear though. It could be that they are all aware of who they are working for or that none of them are.” Bucky looked thoughtful. “Next time we visit we’ll need to tear it down so that former operations can’t be picked back up.”
A moment later J.A.R.V.I.S. replied. “He is currently speaking with Captain Rogers. He says he will visit with you afterwards.”
Tony rolled his eyes to the ceiling, away from the site at his feet, at the injured but alive man who had meant so much to him growing up. He sighed; here he was, decked out in an assortment of homemade gadgets and he couldn’t even bring himself to use them, even when he knew the other man wouldn’t hesitate to use them on him.
Steve turned his head and stared out the window, trying and just barely managing to keep an impassive face as Tony told Rhodey and Pepper everything that was happening—everything that was going to happen in the future. He tried to remind himself that he was trusting Tony, even if that included trusting Rhodey and Pepper as well.
Obadiah rolled his eyes, as if he didn’t have a care in the world. “Why do you think he’s dead, boy?”
Steve wrinkled his nose in disgust and turned the page with a little more force than was particularly necessary. It was just, he wondered what it was like, to be as young as Tony and living smack dab in the middle of the media’s lime light.
Tony nudged Obadiah a bit roughly with his foot until the other man opened his eyes and narrowed them at him. “You had my family killed. You used me to further your cause until you decided I wasn’t playing well with others, had me tortured in an attempt to gain information all because you were….desperate? Money hungry?”
Dum Dum found him in the back while he was spiking his hair up a bit more. He used an ungodly amount of product to achieve this look so he was going to make sure he got his money’s worth. He’d taken care of his eye liner right away because that was probably his least favorite part. He’d poked himself in the eye more than enough times. He was wearing his usual torn vest and on both arms were his spiked bracelets, which he actually kind of liked and sometimes (only sometimes) thought about wearing more often. The spiked collar he could live without but it definitely helped with the image. He looked over when Dum Dum stepped in front of the mirror to give his moustache a twist and positioned his bowler cap just right. He insisted that it was punk rock after he added some spikes to it, but he refused to perform without it. That was Dum Dum in a nutshell. He cared little about fitting in and was ready to perform after having at least four beers. At least his drum solos were always top notch.
“That reminder was for me,” Steve said darkly. “One last thing. If you see Red Skull, take him out, no questions, no warnings.”
Rhodey clapped Tony on the shoulder and shook him gently. “You’re alive, Tony. And here with us. If you think we’re just going to let you run off on your own and get involved with who knows what, then you don’t know us as well as I thought you did. You’re in this, so now we’re in this.”
“I cannot say that I would know for certain, sir, but according to these files it appears that he would have been working closely for your father during this time. Your father was involved in a project known as Project: Rebirth, and Steve was their test subject. There are pictures if you are interested for the sake of comparison.”
He still really wanted to tear Tony a new one for coming out in the first place, but he also sort of wanted to hold onto the other man for dear life because, good lord, how were they both okay? Tony was alive and mostly unharmed and if he wasn’t sure that his own shoulder was out of place, he’d shake the genius until he Tony agreed to just listen. For once. Tony was going to be the absolute death of him, Steve decided as he took the other man’s shoulders in his hands, breathing heavily, shakily, one way or the other, this man was going to kill him.
Steve didn’t want to know what that meant. Luckily Tony arrived at the door just a moment later, obviously nervous. “Come in. Sorry that these heathens didn’t think to do so.”
Steve blinked and Tony removed his fingers from the blond’s lips. Steve licked them where they’d been pinched together and then smiled. “So are you saying that wouldn’t have worked if Clint or Natasha had asked you?”
He set his phone down and sat up, stumbling toward the bathroom to take a shower. The warm water felt nice and helped clear his head a little.
Tony smiles. “I bet you’d be so happy for people to know how much you love having things shoved up your ass. If they knew what a slut you are for my cock.”
Tony just continued to talk. Apparently this was something he has always enjoyed doing. “He said that you have a special serum that made you strong and that it can’t be made again, but I think he is mean and he doesn’t listen to me anyway. I told him I could be like you anyway and he said that would never happen.”
Steve watched him as he stopped in front of one of Steve’s bookcases that lined the walls. Tony pulled out Steve’s worn copy of the The Hobbit with a raised brow as he flipped carefully through the pages. “You know,” Tony said, apropos to nothing, “I used to think Pepper was the one for me.” Tony set the book carefully back in its place and trailed his way over to Steve’s desk until he could prop himself up on the edge. “I wanted—I thought I wanted the kind of life that everyone dreams about. She’s always seemed so self assured and put together and balanced. I wanted that, I wanted whatever it was that made her that way to rub off on me somehow. Lord knows how I got her to go out with me once let alone date me for as long as she did. I don’t blame her for not staying. I mean, she never really left, she’s still one of my best friends, but I don’t blame her for ending our relationship. I’m the genius but I’m also selfish. I would have held on until I ruined us. She was smart enough to pull away while we could still hold on to what made us and us to begin with.”
The bike is one that good ol' cap actually used in the films, & the Audi is a marvel classic. Also, if you haven't noticed, I'm British, so trying to write with American English is gonna mess me up a lil bit. Please let me know if I used the wrong word somewhere, anywhere in this car crash of a fic.
Tony’s eyes snap up to meet Steve’s. Now he’s never really been one for highly-charged eye contact, but those gorgeous blue eyes have always secretly been his undoing. He struggles to find something appropriate to say, but the Stark name has rarely been associated with sensible.
A month after the war ended in 2435, Howard flew out into the Arctic circle with a miniature atom bomb attached to his chest and blew himself up, leaving only an old-fashioned letter to his wife and son behind. He’d disabled the AI on that particular bomb.
, he barrelled on. “I need you to make it look like the four of us are in Coulson’s office as soon as possible. Like, now. And five minutes ago.”
Rhodey stood up quickly, walking upright and proud. Tony was less quick off the mark, and he winked at the cameras on the way up to the stage. He thinks he saw a woman swoon at the back.
Tony, at that moment, decided he was entirely done with this. “Has anyone found the body of Maria Hill and called it?” He looked at Rumlow expectantly.
“So I make it smaller,” Tony replies flippantly, “I’ve been meaning to do that lately. Guess it just got bumped up the priority list then? I’ll let you know when I’ve built a suit, bye Rhodey!”
"Oh, Steve!" Tony mock-gasps, one hand hovering in front of his mouth, the other clutching his chest. "I would be so honoured! I am so looking forward to being escorted by my knight in shining-"
Steve raised one eyebrow at the tone of the confused woman- despite the walls, this place already seemed too friendly for it to be his mission. He definitely didn't mind though, and from the loud chuckles coming from the Audi it seems that Bucky didn't mind either.
"The Arm!" Hammer cried. "How is it? That arm is my baby, I worked on it personally you know. Top of the range Hammer tech. You feelin' it?"
"I'll prove it. JARVIS, start looking for some studies that vaguely resemble this. Steve, great chat, let me know when that date is my great warrior knight!"
Figuring it wasn’t a good idea to sit in a car in his armour, Tony tapped the reactor and let the suit slide back into its casing, leaving him in the Armani number he wore at the ceremony.
Now Steve was genuinely surprised, and you could almost see the shock dancing in his eyes as he took in the open honesty. "You should. It's- uh, not like it was your couple thing. Unless it is now, because that's fine."
"That shan't be necessary," JARVIS replies, entirely unfazed by the threat of eternal paperwork. "I would merely like to inform you that Captain Rogers has returned from Brussels."
"Exhilarating." Bucky deadpanned. "Whatever you have planned better not be water, if this thing rusts again-"
This seemed to appease the man, who stood up abruptly and headed for a filing cabinet at the other side of the room, muttering something about how he "designed it better than he would've".
Steve raises an eyebrow. "Are you done?" Tony looks away, slightly embarrassed at being called out. "Am I missing something, Tony? I was expecting to find you moping, or shut up in the lab with the suits."
He and Steve had started off rocky, but after their original testosterone-fuelled arguments, they calmed down and became tentative friends. This was considered a minor (major) miracle at the time, due to Tony's astute lack of giving a fuck about his social life. They developed an easy, amicable friendship built on hope and necessity.
Tony huffed, unsure whether to be arrogantly offended or actually hurt. "Fine. Sure. You win, whatever." He stormed off, refusing to allow the hurt to show on his face.
His eyes fought back tears, and he lost a fair amount of his composure. Maybe he was being dramatic, but never before had he felt such… anguish. But anguish turned to anger and before he knew it, Tony had picked up the frame and hurled it across the room, where it hit the ground loudly and smashed the glass. A ruby rolled along the wood and ended up back at his feet. He kicked at it with a growl, and barely even registered the shocked stares from his teammates.
When his parents died, he felt the violent roar of grief, simultaneously overwhelming his mind and numbing his emotions to the point where he was so changed that he couldn't do it anymore.
"I love y- you too," Tony said, voice small and stuttering slightly. All his residual anger was fading hearing from the man he loved speak to him again. "We really lost, Steve. Can we really continue the story of us? When all I have left is the ashes of what we were?"
Tony’s neck snapped upwards, and he looked up to see Rhodey staring at him with an unreadable expression- somewhere between concern, fondness and annoyance.
All he can think about now is that perhaps this is his chance at happiness. After losing so much, maybe he finally gets to
Steve noted the comment from Clint; apparently their target gives out nicknames liberally. "And I'm Steve Rogers. Sorry about him, he's-"
Steve hated seeing his oldest friend trodden on like this. Unfortunately, it's in the job description, so he couldn't do anything other than send a reassuring smile Bucky's way.
Tony followed him outside to their seats, which were front and centre and surrounded by security guards. He huffed at that, he’s 47 and still surrounded by people who think they can defend him better than he can himself.
undermining Hill’s death.” Rollins, Sitwell and a few other slimy agents were nodding and making noises of agreement.
Steve is left standing on the balcony, faintly concerned about the future of kissing,Tony is wondering what statistics he can twist to get his mouth back on Steve's and JARVIS is pleased that his creator is no longer facing the world alone.
Tony smirked as the wall at the back of the lot slid open to reveal his personal parking spaces- all fifty of them. Almost all of them were full, with cars of all different colours and types filling the spots. The car pulled into an empty space and the doors opened- Tony ushered everyone out of the car and through another secret entrance in the east wall. The door took them straight into his workshop, where Tony was quietly proud of Delta’s reaction to his space.
Up until that day, Tony's life had been like endurance racing- 24 Hours of LeMons, full-on with minimal rest and a complete disregard for the time of day. But then aliens showed up, shit went down and Tony was so exhausted that he could do nothing but stop.
Steve wore a navy suit with a white shirt, unbuttoned at the top. He decided that if he could get away with not wearing a tie, it'd considerably improve the mission.
"Well don't ya go complaining Rogers, we get gorgeous rides and an easy assignment. Who irished up Hammer's coffee?"
Tony was usually stuck with the idiots thanks to his father, Howard Stark. He made the Stark name known with advanced AI weaponry- they were pretty much bombs with a conscience. A weapon that would ask you if you were sure before you set it off made the people pushing the button sleep better at night, so he made a fortune in easing heavy consciences.
“Yep! All good. The crowds and the company reminded me of old times, that’s all.” He grinned up at his best friend, who rolled his eyes and dragged him up off the bar stool.
“When I took charge of Stark Industries, I gained access to a letter from my father. He spoke of his work with AI weaponry, and I have a new insight on them.” He took his sunglasses off, emulating a heart-to-heart conversation with his body language. “My father was many things, but emotional wasn’t one of them. Despite this, he ended his own life because he couldn’t handle the guilt, describing the creation of his bombs as carrying his own coffin to the tomb.”
"Come to mock me, Rogers?" Tony snapped, convinced that the soft tone of voice was to make fun of him.
Steve tried not to blush like a tomato at the concept, and Bucky stifled a laugh, smirking at how his best friend turned bright red despite his obvious efforts not to.
Steve hesitated, and said "As much as I hate the boss, he probably knows what he's doing. Pains me to say, but we gotta just trust him."
Tony watches him take a moment to think about it; to compose himself and muster up the correct words. He straightens up and smiles softly.
Here we are again. Surprised I managed to stop procrastinatin' long enough to write it. Anyway, here it is.
Tony did some quick thinking to appease the frowns. “Don’t wait up! Feel free to empty the bar, it’s on me.” Smiling a winning smile, he walked away, dragging Rhodes behind him.
Pierce nodded, and Team Delta started to walk out. Tony fist-bumped Rhodey on the way out, who chuckled and said goodbye through their private comm.
When Rhodey got up to leave, he placed one hand on Tony's shoulder and said "Don't break yourself over this."
All it took was an old photograph, tucked behind the others on the shelf in the common room. Natasha had been describing, in great detail, an old mission with Clint, when she asked Tony to get the photo in the red frame, far left. He got up and moved to the shelf, allowing himself a small smile at the memories, and- what?
From the moment he read that line, Tony knew what he had to do, and he was willing to fight a thousand soldiers to do it.
Tony remembers that day well, he was only twelve years old, and his mother Maria was sobbing over his father’s desk. He wasn’t allowed to read the letter at the time. However, his mother passed when he was seventeen, dying of an overdose and a broken heart. The very day she died, Tony broke down the locked door of his father’s office, now covered in a thick sheet of dust, and read the letter.
He gestured that Coulson was welcome to drive, and slid in the back with Barton after Romanoff glared her way into shotgun.
Just as quickly as he arrived, he left the room gripping a now fairly crumpled list. Steve watched him go with a gentle smile, before turning his attention to packing his belongings into a case that was slightly friendlier than the stark black one sat ominously on his coffee table.
“Sure, I’ll get some old footage on there. What’s happening?” She sounded fairly panicked now, but there was also frantic typing in the background.
“Congratulations, gentlemen. You both greatly deserve this honour.” President Fury almost smiled, and Tony was glad his glasses had cameras in, maybe he would leak a photo of the almost-smile tonight.
"Well probably, but there ain't much to be done. Unless you got a single, better idea? 'Cause I'm all for keeping this assignment."
The changeover point is only about twenty minutes away from the tower, and he knows that he has to be completely in character by the time he's out of the car. Sparing a glance to Bucky, he notices him doing a similar thing, blanking his emotions and creating the character.
someone. And Steve really wants to keep Tony. Unfortunately, he just ran out of the room and locked himself in his workshop.
"-You get to come on our tour! Super exclusive, highly practiced and not at all overhyped tour. Yep." Darcy said, ignoring the joking scowl on the deputy's face at being interrupted.
“Right, so what if we made a… shell? A suit of armour almost, but with all the capabilities of our best fighter bots? Repulsors and flight and everything, but with a human mind inside to maximise effect. They’d be expensive, difficult and downright ostentatious, but if that doesn’t describe me then I don’t have a damn clue what does.”
Team Beta is run by the possibly late Maria Hill, Tony’s second-favourite team leader. Beta squad has two field operatives, brothers. Their codenames are Thor and Loki; they refuse to go by anything else. There’s also an astrophysicist computer whiz named Darcy, who is an excellent science bro.
Steve seemingly decided that the best way to shut him up is to kiss him, pressing his lips firmly against Tony's.
“We are- well, we were. I made some executive decisions. Director sent me and Delta out on a mission.”
Steve, the paper informed him, had a placement as art teacher at the school. He smiled a little at this; he'd been looking to indulge his old hobby recently.
to hurt.” He pulls Tony into a warm hug. “I want you. But I also want to be more than a lovelorn rebound.”
“Tones, are you okay? You were totally out of it then, staring into your drink like it’ll save the world for you.” He raised one eyebrow accusingly.
Promise they'll meet in the next chapter, but if I don't just post what I've got it'll be another month.
STRIKE Team Delta is absolutely Tony’s favourite, hands down. It’s as if Phil Coulson had taken the two most difficult recruits in SHIELD, thrown them in a blender then jumped in behind them. Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton, otherwise known as Black Widow and Hawkeye, are an unstoppable duo with excellent banter. She never loses a fight (unless she wants to), he never misses a shot and Coulson writes paperwork the length of War and Peace. It works well, and Tony always agrees to any mission with Delta.
Smiling half-heartedly, Tony slumps down on the couch with a glass of bourbon, staring out of the window.
The pair spent almost two hours in a comfortable silence, the only sounds from the traffic below and the occasional click of the lighter.
“I was checking the file details, and I noticed that there was a lot of encrypted folders- first red flag. I downloaded them to my Bluetooth USB, Stark, can you get these open?”
there’s time, you can search for a trail on Hill. Or, the more likely reality, recover her body so she receives the proper send-off she deserves.”
After that, Tony barricaded himself in his workshop for weeks, creating prototypes for drones and robots and non-weaponised AIs that he trashed again and again because they weren’t cutting-edge enough to bear the Stark name.
It was if someone had ripped open a faucet, everything that wouldn't type poured out onto the page. The poem was a mess, a formless chunk of angry, brutal, beautiful sentences that expressed everything he wanted it to.
“Please-“ Coulson starts, but Tony hushes him. “That won’t be necessary. Whilst Agent was talking, I was figuring out logistics of this. If everyone here is agreeable, this is going to be upgraded to an Iron Man mission, with STRIKE Team Delta listed as backup. This way, we can take my own tech, and do it our way. I have a favour to call in with the President, and I’ll get him to step in and change it.”
Before Tony could respond indignantly, Peter took the phone back and said he was heading into the lab to work on the web formula. Waving him off, Tony sat back into the chair holding his glass of whiskey contemplatively.
.) He handed the tablet to Steve, with a video queued up to play. This was almost certainly Hammer's video pep talk, with extra information he forgot to put in their files and various half-empty threats.
“Of course, Sir. Hello again Agent Coulson, Agent Romanoff and Agent Barton. It’s a pleasure to see you once more.” JARVIS flicked a red light on the dashboard to signify a complete shutdown of external communications. He also took the liberty of tinting all the windows, then mirroring them.
“Yes, I’ve just changed the security footage. I’m assuming you want me to cause a base-wide camera failure in two hours’ time? You have to get back in to take a jet to the mission.”
Tony's eyes snap up, refocusing on the skyline out of the window. Does he really want to pursue one of his friends, a teammate? Can his heart really handle it? The obvious answer to many would be a harsh no, but he has never been a man with finite love. He just very rarely finds someone worth giving any to. Yet on the other hand-
"What? You haven't? Man, where have you been? SHIELD is one of the most prestigious, well-known schools on the face of the earth. No?"
“What makes you think he’ll listen to you? Pierce is practically his second eye.” Romanoff is glaring at him through the rear mirror.
Steve came to him, again. That has to mean something. Tony turns to face him, unsure but determined.
"Funny story actually, Stevie and I have spent, what, our entire lives trying to get jobs at the same place. Sad, huh?" Bucky joked, "But anyways, he saw the job vacancies and called me up all excited, so I couldn't go letting him down."
Rolling the window down, Bucky said "I should go in front, I got the address in the nav. You cool to tail me?"
Over the course of the next few weeks, he spends his waking hours around the team, much to their obvious surprise- they were much more accustomed to his absence.
“-Absolute bullshit, sir,” Barton cut in, “it was as flimsy as the bikinis of the models Stark sleeps with.”
“Pierce! Well, this is certainly surprising. Who died to make you come talk to me?” He grinned, paparazzi smile in full force.
"I'm sorry, I must be reading this wrong. Was that you questioning my authority? Because honey, that's not how this works." Hammer snapped. "This mission is easily the most important of your careers. I need your best acting skills, so what's better than not having to act at all?"
Tonight, he does something different- he goes out to watch the sunset. It's 7:43 pm, and the autumn breeze chills his skin as the cool air of night seeps in. He'd never taken the time to watch the sun sink below the cityscape before, preferring to take solace in the comfort of the night. And, he thinks to himself, he wouldn't be out here tonight without the gentle prompt from his gentle friend.
