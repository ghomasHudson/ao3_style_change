So long story short, Mick agreed. Last night, he saw Ketch hauling a blonde man into the tent, handcuffed with a bruised jaw. He recognised him from the few details Dean had shared with him. Because Jody Mills from the first heist said Adam Milligan was involved and Sam Winchester apparently tried to interrogate him but failed, Dean confirmed that Adam was part of their team and that he was working on the outside. He told Mick that on the off-chance Adam got caught, he was trusting Mick to protect him.
Dean is, admittedly, good for his brother, Gabriel realizes. He can see it on his face. He’s happier, he’s trying to quit smoking, he’s cutting down on drinking as much as he can, his temper isn’t so harsh nowadays.
Castiel frowns but looks up at the ceiling so the makeup artist can redo his eyeliner. "So what? You know me. I'm not interested and with..."
What he knows about vault security in America is that they don't cover thermal lances or explosives, or they're at least not one of the main testing points for vaults. Either way, Dean intended to have Berlin and some great blacksmiths weld a hole and build an interconnection antechamber on the 14-ton vault door within the sixteen minutes it takes to fill up. Without opening the door, one of them will go through the chamber and come out the other end to weld the tube to the vault. They'll have to use the remaining time from the sixteen minutes after construction. It's risky, but Dean is sure they can do it. Once it's welded, the gold will be free to grab.
, I'm so scared," Vegas grins, dropping the phones into the bag in Angeles's hands. "Don't be a tease."
“What you do outside the prison’s your business,” Dean says, but he wears a smile. “Thank you, Michael.”
Meg’s plan, loosely based on the one she used for her own break out, went like this — an inmate drove the van so she simply knocked the original driver off their duty with unscrupulous means and took over. While the guards got out to get the ad-seg inmates, she got out, put a brick on the gas and jumped out. They’d chased the van thinking she was driving it away when in reality, she was halfway through the thick of trees near the solitary block. By the time they realised the van had no driver, she was already gone.
Cas nods, adding nervously, “Of course. I wanted to make it up to you, so I made a reservation for you and Pax tonight at 8 for Bouley. It has an 80’s aesthetic to it and I remember you wearing a Led Zeppelin shirt once. I thought you might like the retro setting.”
Roadhouse was great, Ellen said the meal was on her. I think Jo took a photo of us but I don't care. Cas's dad was in the cinema we were in so I took him to watch the sunset at the park instead. He
And Castiel listens. Dean often finds himself rambling for way longer than he intends to, and his hands move animatedly when he talks (which has led to people staring at his hands while in conversation with him) but Castiel says nothing, lets him talk until he's run out of words to say, and then he offers his input.
“No!” Gabriel denies, offended. “I just thought we should get to know all the big guns here so we know who to avoid. While you were away, I found out Asmodeus is the go-to guy if you wanted stuff snuck in. I think he and Alastair work together for the drug supply but I also think Alastair’s in cahoots with one of the COs. My bet’s Lilith.”
Near the property of the house that Kansas taught his heist classes on, there is a lake that the robbers liked going dipping in sometimes. Meg knew that Kansas and Angeles often went on their own and that Salem, Paris and Rome liked to cool down there after a long class. It's a nice area; a clear lake that's still most days and soft grass that tickles your feet.
Once he comes in through the elevator, switching coffee cups with Dean, he starts, "Be prepared, I'll have the run-through at 12:30 today." Dean nods, checking that he already has it in the schedule as a woman runs up to him, handing him a coat from the upcoming fall collection. Cas passes it back to her, telling her how to improve on it, and turns back to Dean. "Chuck Shurley will be coming, so you either pick him up from the lobby or have Lisa Braeden send him up."
"So, what? Hannah's jealous of me?" Dean almost laughs. He ruined everything with Cas last week, what the hell would she have to be jealous of?
Sam is the praying type. Dean’s never tried except for the one time when Sam drank himself half-blind a week after Jess died and Dean prayed to God to help his brother because he doesn’t know how to.
"Good. Get ready, we'll be there soon. Salem will have the alarms down in ten minutes so Jack Kline's class can enter. Go in in ten," Kansas orders. With a hum of acknowledgement, London hangs up and turns to Vegas, holding up ten fingers. When ten minutes pass, Vegas and London start heading towards the bank's entrance, praying to God that Salem has the alarms turned off by now.
"Do it yourself. Take the phone," Dean says incredulously when he sees Chuck shrink back. "I thought you wanted the phone. Now that you have to take it yourself, you don't want it?" When Chuck doesn't make a move to grab it, Dean shoves it into his pocket with a roll of his eyes. He hated people who won't do anything themselves.
She doesn’t wait for Ruby to return the statement, hanging up and standing. Hannah takes out their earbuds, confused. “What?”
"Commander Cas," Gabriel says jokingly, lifting his newly curated diamond up to the thin light overhead.
Charlie raises her hand, waving it excitedly, and she asks, "What's the most embarrassing thing to happen to you since you became a designer? You're always so professional. You had to have had a time where you cracked."
"Good, that's good," Sam replies, leaning in his chair. At least the hostages are alright. "Can you give me a name? It's weird talking to a nameless voice."
When Cas enters the office for the first time that day, he’s dressed in full Fendi wear; A slim-fit gabardine blazer with asymmetric collars and flap pockets. Half of it is black and the other half is brown cavalry twill. He wears a white patterned silk shirt underneath and matching brown pants. Dean himself is in Vivienne Westwood. He bought more, just because Cas likes it when he wears Westwood. This has got to be a new level of whipped for Dean, he’s expanding his closet for the guy. Not that he wouldn’t do it anyway, but buying a brand specifically for him.
Castiel walks in right then, dressed in a single-breasted tailored jacket in serge wool gabardine with a peaked lapel, leather trims, and one silver button, a dégradé lamé-striped polo shirt, cropped mid-rise skinny jeans, D-ring pin-buckle belt, and Marius Oxford shoes. It’s completely black, with very nice silver and grey detailing on each item. It looks sharp and very good on Castiel’s body.
"First of all, thank you for coming tonight," Castiel opens. "Yesterday, it was a big step towards a better world for all of us. I am beyond happy about what happened. I know all of us here have been waiting for this for years. Some are more enthusiastic than others." Charlie whoops loudly, causing some dispersed laughter. "I think I speak for all of us when I say we are all proud to be here today."
Meg finally looks at Sam with discomfort on her face, an expression that asks if they should stop Cas now. Sam steps forward as Cas continues, "I don’t feel anything anymore. So they can come and get me." He shoots another time and both Meg and Sam know that the next shot won't be a blank. "But leave Kansas alone."
?” That gets Gabriel sitting up and Anael startles at the sudden sound, not having known that Gabriel was there. She flips him off. “Dude, I did not know that.”
"We're not gonna force you. If you wanna skip out then go ahead. We can find someone else," Dean assures. He can tell she didn't want to go again, not after what they lost the first time. Even Cas didn't want to go. Even himself.
"Yeah, he's fine, just a graze. Stuck him with guard duty for now though," the man says. From where she's standing, Toni can't get a good look at his face, only the back of his head. Since Kansas's voice on the calls to the tent has voice modification, she can't tell if this is Kansas or a random Dalí. "I'll check in with you later, alright?"
. He’s almost entirely covered in light now. As the darkness of the Empty slowly gets brighter because of Dean, there is a high whining noise like when angels speak. Dean’s body begins to CRACK, but he SMILES TEARFULLY...
Dean tries to adjust to his new environment. Last he'd been awake, he heard glass shattering and saw a masked Dalí on the ground as Cas explained that Detroit has been shot. He'd stirred a little when Eileen was wheeling him down the hallway and now he's so fucking alive after that stab in his gunshot.
In the car ride to the restaurant — which isn't that far away from the NOVAK building, but Castiel took the car for privacy reasons — Dean shows Castiel the ending. Castiel mutters about how he has to show it to Gabriel the next time he sees him and Dean responds by writing it down in his planner which makes both of them laugh. Dean likes Castiel's laugh; it bubbles out of him and it is sunny, and Dean likes hearing it.
Castiel looks around with his rifle raised. With so many escaped hostages, he couldn't risk being uncareful. He checks behind himself again -- nobody down the hall. He twists back to enter the boiler room. Glancing around, it's empty, and Balthazar lays on the ground, blood pooling around his head. Castiel almost drops his rifle when he falls to his knees next to him. "Rome!
Missouri is rendered speechless by Abaddon's confession and the camera shakes in Dede's arms. Crowley decides that it's time to move her to the final part of the interview -- the caskets. This time, only Crowley, Dean, Sam, Missouri and Dede enter. Castiel remains outside while Dorothy and Meg stayed behind to watch Abaddon. The two wooden makeshift caskets rested on the desks, covered with names painted on the side.
The reason why he was nervous was that Cas likes to confide in him about his feelings for Dean. He's been in love with Dean for years which is still such a strange idea to Sam no matter how used he was to Cas waxing poetic about his brother. Apparently, back when Dean had gone to Hell for 40 years, his soul and body were damaged so horribly that Cas had to reconstruct him, atom by atom. Every freckle, every strand of hair, Cas had painstakingly restored with careful hands. Which was fine, because he knew how to build people back up.
Cas leans back enough so that they can look at each other, giving Dean a look so suggestive that it put every other lover he ever had to shame. "Then show me."
Dean doesn’t see Cas again until five minutes before the show starts. Dean has the models queued up while Gabriel and his cosmetics team do final touch-ups to their makeup and he, Bess, and Balthazar make sure the outfits look as perfect as possible.
Dean heads off to the cafeteria to have lunch after getting the polaroids and scarves and after he has texted Ed Zeddmore to leave a printed copy of the analytics on his desk before 2 PM that day. Ed responds half an hour after the text with a photo of the papers on Dean’s table, so he can rest easy knowing he’d completed all the tasks Castiel has given him so far. He texts Charlie to ask if she can come to meet him for lunch but she’s busy in Los Angeles trying to sort out stock with a branch of Enfants Riches Déprimés. Dean didn’t even know she was in Los Angeles.
Dean says, eyes dropping to Meg's gun, "Angeles didn't even want us to hand him to the police. We already said we'd give Rome the funeral he should have once we were out of here. And you are wasting a lot of time doing this when Abaddon is still around. If you want to leave, I can't and won't stop you, but you'll have to go with Dallas to speed up work on the tunnel. You can take your share of whatever money and gold we have by now and go once the tunnel's done, I'll tell Windom not to stop you. So you can leave, or you can stay."
"We're not giving them a surgeon. Tell him that his precious Los Angeles can bleed out. That's how criminals pay their debts," Zachariah says, looking coldly at the phone in Sam's hand before stalking off. Sam stares after him in disbelief and when nobody else in the tent says anything, he wonders how he has been so blind for so long.
While Cas leaves early for the Emmy’s, Dean makes a different trip. Gabriel and Crowley wanted to try the food at a little café that Pamela discovered, a small place named Guidry’s Cajun Café. Pamela said it was delicious, and after bringing Missouri, Kevin and a few other friends, Dean, Gabriel, and Crowley were sold. They order some of the dishes Pamela specified to be her favourites, trusting her taste, and when the food is brought over, Dean does a double-take at the server.
“Maybe start with apologising,” Sam suggests. “Then, I don’t know, you could just overdo everything. Get ahead of his requests.”
Gabriel nods along and he sighs, taking a bite out of a french fry. "Alright... You look kinda sick. If you are, you should have just cancelled on me or something."
Gabriel explains, waving the food around on his fork as if it isn’t the most disgusting thing he’s ever seen, “He’s in for running scams. Easy stuff.” He suddenly widens his eyes as if recalling something and leans across the table conspiratorially, “He says Ishim’s in for a
Pamela replies, “You get used to it eventually. Listen, Dean. I would love to talk more since you sound really fun, but I have like ten other calls to make. God, I can’t wait for you to take this job. Enjoy your pasta.”
She’d visited Champs-Elysées, smiling at the memory of how Cas had robbed this place before. Clearly, it had time to recover from the loss incurred by Cas, and it looks as if he’d never gotten his hands on their treasure.
"Unfortunately. We couldn't get enough money for the school fees, so I learned fashion myself," Castiel says, a sad smile on his face. "At least God blessed me with good enough luck that I worked at a boutique that the fashion director for Vogue at the time liked and she gave me the start I needed."
"I'm not a fool, Winchester. Otherwise, I'd be a circus clown instead of a designer," Bela says, moving closer to Dean. She smiles, deliberately insufferable. Dean draws in a deep breath. She asks, "Are you trying to impress me?"
"I'm surprised Meg got to Naomi before you," Castiel says. Maybe his attempt at a joke to ease the tension but it falls a little flat.
Cas sits up to look down at Dean, fully in view. His dark hair is messy, cheeks rosy, and a smile so beautiful that it strikes Dean like lightning. "Move in with me. You're always over anyway and I have space."
Cas tells him to shut up and is about to go back into the foundry when Dean grabs his hand, pulling him back in to kiss him. Dean cradles Cas's face in his hands as Cas presses back against him, opening his mouth over his. For a second, it doesn't feel like they're waiting for gold to turn to paper or waiting for the police to arrive. It feels like they're in their little house in Palermo and he wished he could stop time there.
Meg gazes at him, bewildered, but provides no answer. Salem pushes open the door and Meg shoves him into the room.
Sam blinks himself awake and groans, his hand coming up and pulling away to be dipped in crimson. He comes to his bearings, mumbling, a little out of it, "She got away, I'm sorry."
Dean sighs and closes the door behind him before leaning against it. "If we get some basics down, it'll be fine. We grew up together, man. This shouldn't be too hard. I'll start, alright? First one's easy: no banging anyone until we switch back. This is my body."
“Charlie already invited me. I’ll see you guys then,” Dean nods, trying to smile even though Kevin’s tale spooked him out. Kevin grins and pats him on the back once in encouragement before he leaves for the elevator once again to return to level 6.
Dean presses the ‘open’ button and a redhead runs in. Dean eyes her outfit. It’s entirely Chanel; a black wool crepe coat, cotton navy and white blouse, black crepe de chine and black satin and strass sandals. She looks good, it makes her red hair stand out. He recognizes her, though.
Sam and Eileen meet Dean in Charlie's office since Dean texted them where to find him. Charlie's office had calming energy to it, featuring Sci-Fi figurines and merchandise as well as a whole bunch of photos of her and her friends. Two of them are of her and Dean, one with Dorothy getting crêpes together and another of her and Dean in a photo booth with wacky stickers and superhero-themed props.
And it has never been about deserving; it's about believing, hoping, wanting. And God, he wanted Castiel so bad.
“Nah, don’t worry about it. I can clean it up later,” Gabriel dismisses, unlocking the doors. “Hop in. Sammy, up here with me. Dean-o, you sit in the back with Cas.” Cas kicks Gabriel’s seat from behind and the elder Novak laughs while Sam shrugs, getting into the passenger seat. Dean slides in next to Cas in the backseat. “Why were you two walking in the rain anyway?
In the tent, Sam groans loudly when he sees the gun Angeles has, "They have a browning machine gun. Tell them to fall back."
Cas is dressed in full Givenchy; a coat and skinny pants, both in the same technical iridescent cotton. Wing low sneakers in white leather and a matching plain white v-neck from what Dean thinks is probably a cheap retail shop. Dean returns, “Givenchy’s great on you but I miss your Prada coat.”
Cas pauses, touching Dean's hand gently to stop him from writing as he reconsiders. He remedies, "Call Crowley, invite him to dinner with me and Bela tomorrow. Tell Dick Roman that I'll see him at 7 tonight. If he's not free, tell him I'll take it to court. Bring up the interns." Cas lets Dean's hand go and leaves his office to wait for the interns in the conference room and Dean walks to the elevator, shooting Crowley a text to tell him about the change in plans. Crowley replies with a simple 'OK', so Dean leaves it at that. On the way down, he manages to call Bela and resolves to call Metatron after he's brought the interns to Cas.
When they close the door behind them, Dean instantly leads Cas over to the small tank in his room. It's obviously pretty cheap as it is small, and Dean points out each snail as he says, "Clarence, Chevy, and Bee, your other dad is here."
The heist was going smoothly. Abaddon and the four other security guards are tied up in another room, where Dallas can keep an eye on them. If everything stays on track, today will be productive: work on the escape route, the false escape route, gold melting and money printing will begin. The machinery for the gold will probably take two hours to construct since they are professionals. Fifty-two ingots, four hundred kilograms out of a grand total of ninety thousand, melted per hour, and then sixteen million dollars per hour with London...
“Of course, because caffeine at night is always a good idea,” Castiel says sarcastically, but he’s already reaching for his Valentino coat. “Let’s go. I know this 24-hour café down the street.”
Castiel himself is dressed in the same clothes he’ll be wearing to the first day of New York Fashion Week -- a mostly cashmere silk classic fit outfit consisting of a cargo pocket detail trench coat, an English fit jersey tailored blazer and pants, jersey shirt and a classic cut jersey tie, the outfit a monochromatic range of greys. He looks wildly sexy if Dean wanted to be honest.
." Sam gives Dean a look that, while it would look fine on Sam's face, looks weird as hell with Dean's features. Maybe he's just not used to seeing himself in the flesh. "Not each other."
Dean is hesitant to reply with the line he toed earlier on but eventually answers, “He acted weird all evening.”
Kelly writes down his progress for her notes, looking up proudly at him. "Are you ready to tell me, then?"
Pan over to THE SHADOW, still masquerading as Meg Masters, sits at its throne with a SMILE, listening to Castiel’s regrets with its eyes closed.
"Nobody said anything about being in love. Are you?" Balthazar smirks, making Castiel throw a book vaguely in his direction. Balthazar dodges and laughs again. "Alright, alright. I'm done."
Dean hiccups particularly loudly and Cas bursts out laughing as if it’s the funniest thing he has ever heard, and it’s ridiculous because it’s just a hiccup, but Cas might be the cutest person Dean has ever met, laughing over a fucking
“I’m sorry for implying that it’s your fault. It’s not, you didn’t do anything,” Dean continues and at this point, his brain is telling him to stop talking, that he’s going on for too long now, but his mouth won’t shut up. “Pax is nice and all but he’s not...”
“You can pry him from my cold, dead hands,” Cas jokes. “But yes, excellent show, Dean.” Dean thanks them and notices Sam talking to Gadreel, a camera looped around his neck. Cas seems to see them at the same time and sends Dean a shrug. Bela decides to bring Eileen and Jo to meet Anna, and Crowley finds himself some company with a writer from Bullet magazine.
Dean rolls his eyes, “Yeah, yeah.” His eyes light up with triumph and he lifts his passport, grinning victoriously. “Found it.”
"His coffee order is insane," Sam mumbles, following Dean into the NOVAK lobby with Eileen by his side. "Seriously, who needs a coffee order that specific?"
"He sends his apologies, he couldn't make it. He's busy, as I'm sure you are right now as well," Castiel replies. "Right, Nurse?"
“The agent he shot at the Factory three years ago, Bevell,” Rowena explains. “They caught him for her murder.”
Dean shoots her a fake annoyed look, “Just a kiss, nothing more, you dirty bastard.” Charlie gives him a shit-eating grin and Dean continues, shaking his head, “We were both a little tipsy and then it kind of happened. I don’t know if I should ask him about it because maybe he regrets it or he doesn’t even remember it.”
“Despite all that,” Anael says. “I really do respect you, Kansas. It was an honour to be a Dalí with you.”
“You look good,” Dean grins, already feeling so much more at ease now that he’s seeing Cas. A part of him was concerned but his happiness in seeing Cas outweighed his being upset about it. “When I heard you were here… not gonna lie, I was unsure about it but I am so glad to see you.”
"Yeah, they're already in there. I just came out here to see Charlie before I lose her in a crowd," Dean says. "My other brother and his boyfriend are here too, Cas gave me the green light to invite them."
“Dude, your first awards show, though,” Sam redirects the conversation. “Eileen’s all excited about it. Who are you gonna meet.”
This was a gift. This time I’ve gotten with Dean, my family, my friends, this world. This life. It was all a gift.
"Oh, Dean. Poor, poor Dean," Sam teases, his grin wide and entertained. "Are you gonna ask him out?"
“Why the f—“ Castiel cuts himself off, sighing loudly. “Tell Duma to get the collection here in the next five minutes or she’s out.” Gadreel quickly runs off to call Duma and Dean hangs back awkwardly. He’s in a bad mood. “Winchester.”
“Of course, Dean,” she smiles, sweet and full of pride. “You let me know if you need help with anything.”
“To be honest,” Michael begins, taking the Star Wars bandaids and putting it into Adam’s hand. “I saw you just now and you’re probably the most interesting person I’ve seen the past week. I’m only in Detroit for a few days more but I’d really like to get coffee with you before I’m gone if you’ll oblige me.”
Dean raises his eyebrows, realization dawning on his face. "Lunch with Kelly." Cas nods and Dean just smiles, "I'm so damn proud of you, Cas. Are you free tonight?"
me?" Bela turns so that she is looking in the same direction as Castiel. She points at Hannah, looking at the computer to overview the photographs. "Call her name and watch her melt."
When he and Castiel were getting ready to leave for London, Dean Winchester tells him, “Cas is trying to quit smoking and he’s been chewing gum to keep himself busy. Try stocking up on gum and keep an eye out. If he tries to get into alcohol, try your best. Help me look out for him.”
"Because you can't risk looking petty," Rowena chastises but it's without malice. "You can bring Dean but you should go. What's the worst that can happen?"
At least five cars with FBI agents pouring out of them. So much for Roman's wish of good luck. "Fuck."
Michael says, “If I find out that you reported Dean or Adam, or any of us, to Bartholomew or Roman, I won’t be so kind.”
Kelly raises her eyes from her clipboard, raising her eyebrows slightly, “The thing you were working on telling me?”
“Of course, yeah,” Dean says, stepping aside to make way for him. He can’t help but notice that Cas is wearing Prada, like how Dean wore Westwood. He wondered if it’s for the same reasons — Dean wore it because he knows Cas likes when he does. Did Cas wear Prada because he thought Dean liked him in the brand? The thought sends tingles up Dean’s spine, even though it seemed pretty mild in the wide scheme of things.
Sam raises his hands and then lowers them back onto the counter as if saying ‘the jig is up’. “Well, yeah. Cas and I talk a lot.”
Of course, not even five minutes after the sound show, Dean returns to the governor's office to get a call from Sam who demands, "What the hell are you doing in there?"
“That’s right. Why does it bother you?” Cas repeats, finding footing in his side of the argument. “You second-guess everything that happens in your relationship, you get too anxious about what other people think about you two — I know you well enough by now. I can see that your relationship hasn’t moved an inch since it started. Maybe you don’t want it to move forward. You barely talk about him with me and you have talked openly about your personal life." He finally closes the space between them again. “Don’t ask me why it bothers me so much when my personal assistant clearly has issues of his own. Sort it out before you slip up in the job, Winchester.”
Dean did have one last favour left but he had a feeling he’d need it for something. His intuition was rarely wrong. Panic about his first kill begins to seep into his nerves and he schools his face into something more neutral, forcing himself into the Kansas persona.
Angeles shakes his head, sitting up, "I'll wait until you have the medical kit since they found Jack. Get the glass out after we make them think we're fucked." Dean nods and slides a hand under Angeles's arms to help him up but releases him once he's sure he's fine on his own. Granted, two pieces of glass isn't a fatal injury, but Dean cared about his team, even if he didn't know their real names. Dean and Angeles make their way to the main hall where all the hostages are now assembled, blindfolds put over their eyes. Berlin stands next to a brunet teenage boy and Dean smiles -- that's Jack Kline. They all push their masks up into their hair so their faces are now revealed. Paris is now in regular clothing, assimilated into the crowd. She will keep an eye to make sure none of them tries to be a hero.
“I... don’t really care,” Dean shrugs. “You know, I’ve got everyone I need right here. You guys, Cas, my friends. I’m set.”
"Listen," Dean suddenly turns to face Angeles. "I want you to be my second-in-command when we're in the bank."
it here. Best job ever," Cassie laughs. She looks down at her watch and asks, "Your taxi is coming in a few, so I think I'll leave you two here." She takes out a post-it from her bag and scribbles on it before passing it to Dean. "Here's my current number. You should text me sometime, Dean. I missed being your friend."
“Congratulations,” Cas says, deadpan, and Dean breaks out with a laugh, surprisingly easy. Cas’s gravelly voice is soothing over the phone, and Dean’s anger dissipates bit by bit until he’s in a much better mood by the time Cas wishes him good night and Dean tells Sam a joke about John and his awful jeans.
easy. He doesn't even apologise if he eats the last cookie." Michael rolls his eyes, but he takes one of Adam's hands into his own and runs a thumb over his knuckles wordlessly. Adam smiles easily and adds, "Thanks for hearing him out, Dean."
Laughing, Dean says, “Michael Winchester doesn’t even sound that good anyway. Michael Milligan’s better.” Michael hums in agreement and, after a moment of consideration, Dean asks, “What was it before this anyway?”
"Vegas, you have one hour to get her to cooperate. Have fun," Dean says simply, leaving the office with the rest and leaving Meg alone with Abaddon.
Dean pulls his most dramatic offended look and gasps, "Castiel Novak! How could you?" Cas graces him with a flat look that just makes Dean laugh again. "Anyway, I'm serious. Let's look for those snails. Do you keep any of them?"
He would be lying if he said he didn't check himself out when he tried on the clothes Castiel chose. He admittedly looks sexy and he wonders if Castiel thinks he does too since he gave him the pieces. And then he wonders why that even matters to him.
“She housed you in France instead of reporting you, Anael. She hid you from Interpol when they were looking for anyone involved in the Dalí heists,” Naomi says, her voice irritatingly smooth. “Even you have to know that’s illegal.”
“Wait, what does he need help with?” Adam pushes. Not that he doesn’t trust Dean, but Adam really isn’t all that jazzed about the idea of Michael going on another heist with Dean, especially when Michael got shot and Adam got beaten up by cops the last time. “Michael, please tell me.”
Castiel's glare deepens as he says, "She killed Rome. I'm going whether you want me to or not." Dean stares at him but Castiel's eyes are steel, unwavering. "And besides, I'll still be alone here, won't I?"
One thing about Pax is he’s good at reading social cues, so it’s no surprise he picks up on Cas not liking him very much. He glances at Dean, unsure, and says, “I have to go, Joey wanted to grab lunch before we meet Gadreel. Dean, I’ll see you later?”
Once the last of the hostages are taken by the paramedics, the SWAT team starts to move in on them. Dean opens his fist and they begin shooting, only aiming above heads, at shields, or at the legs so as to avoid fatal injury. They've lost enough public favour. At least their riot gear is protective enough against their bullets.
"I get that," Dean grins, pulling away from her hug. Cas had told the employees that whoever wanted to attend the party could come into work in the evening and that he was giving everyone the day off. Most of the employees decided to come to the party except for some whose workloads were either too much for one day away or they wanted to celebrate somewhere else.
Salem puts the glasses back in the plastic tray and Meg brings it back to the surgeons and Sam. Sam puts the false glasses back on, having to keep up the ruse, and Meg barely stifles a laugh at his poor act. Castiel brings them to the lobby where Chuck is laid out on a gurney. "Kansas says you have one hour. Will that be sufficient?"
Well, I can’t write forever, even if I wish I could. So, I’ll be stopping here. This is it, then. End of the love story, but not our love.
Dean pulls out a packet of torn out pages from his sketchbook, explaining, “I did some designs for Fashion Week and thought I could maybe submit them. If you don’t want to take them, it’s cool. I know I’m not a designer for NOVAK but I thought I could just give it a shot.”
Castiel starts to panic, feeling his injury come undone under Abaddon's other hand and he desperately tries to shove Abaddon off of him. She's stronger than him in this state and he can't shout, his throat feeling dry. His lungs grasp frantically for air and he tries to reach for the gun on the other side of the pillow.
"Thank you," Eileen says, eyes widened in surprise as she opens the box to reveal a beautiful navy blue Oscar de la Renta gold chain-embroidered cocktail dress. Missouri originally planned to pass him a pink and orange ombré silk chiffon wrap dress (also Oscar de la Renta) but decided that the cocktail one was better. Eileen hugs him and runs off to put it on and Sam smiles, watching her go.
"You made a collection with me, it’s only right that you become your own label," Cas says, putting Dean's pens into the box and looking up at him. "Dean Winchester, you are now a designer for your own name."
“He said he won’t say anything,” Dean assures before he turns to Michael. “Dude, you were like Terminator or something. Are you okay?”
"Collateral damage," Naomi dismisses. "Think about it. One or two hostages down, but we could also get one or two robbers down too. Don't you like the odds?" Ketch did like the odds. It's also why he doesn't last very long with a precinct each time. But he's not fired because he gets results, no matter how questionable the method.
"It will happen. After yesterday, every news outlet will want to get the chance to interview us. This is gonna do
Castiel won't stop looking at him and Michael is more than certain that Dean asked him to watch him. He didn't need to have a babysitter, he knew running out without a plan would be detrimental to the heist but he can't help the sense of urgency that seized in him when Dean told them that Adam had been arrested last night.
Dean and Benny stand, firing at the approaching SWAT members as Crowley dashes out of the area and back to the safes. Once he's gone, they duck behind a tall crate and continue shooting. When Crowley doesn't return after three minutes, Dean shouts, "Go back and get out of here! I'll cover you!"
"Good. You shouldn't take that shit," Michael says. While Michael tells him about how dads can be pretty fucking stupid sometimes and that Dean was right, he feels like a little brother and it's... not the worst feeling. He gets why Sam eases up a lot more in stressful situations when he's around. He gets it.
Not even five minutes after Adam's, Dean gets a call from Sam. He picks up and greets, "Hey, Inspector. What can I do for you?"
Crowbar in hand, Dean approaches the office door and looks in. His heart instantly drops when he sees Lilith pull Adam into a chokehold. Military training kicks in and Lilith moves quick, reacting to Adam hitting her with his elbow by cutting him with her scalpel.
“Can we take five?” Pax asks and Duma gives him a thumbs-up, going over to the computer to check on the photos she’s taken. Pax walks over to Dean and pecks him on the lips, “Hey, Dean.”
Meg stares at him, her victory tasting bitter in her mouth at Dean's lacklustre response to it, and she rolls her eyes. "You make it so hard to lord something over you." She crosses her arms and leans against the closed door. "What's the problem?"
Jack goes on a borderline-tearful speech about how he's alright and that "one of the robbers, Angeles, he's taking care of me so I haven't been hurt at all". Angeles had a good heart, even though some debated it was made of stone with how outwardly emotionless he seemed to be sometimes. Meg knew different, she knew Angeles had a heart that felt too much. Most of the time, the people who felt the most, they came off blank to everyone else. Not her.
Dean frowns in confusion though he does stand to move to the mirror in Cas's room. "What are you talking about?" He looks at his reflection and when he sees his green eyes, he understands. "Oh."
"Got sarcastic with dad," Dean mumbles. "He was mad that I was out studying with Cas because he didn't sign off on it or something. I said that if he didn't want me to study then I could just fail my exams, and now he's pissed." It's kind of surprising how easy it is to talk to Michael. Maybe because he has a similar vibe to Cas, the same steadiness in the way they carry themselves and their blue stares.
Anael has tried her best to keep low by doing her shifts, minding her business. Sticking close to Hannah does help — they’re a pretty relaxing presence to be around — though she can’t help but feel envious that Michael got to leave. Adam insisted on staying so he can watch over them as he’d apparently promised Michael, which means his watchful eyes are really over just Gabriel.
“I was going to collect the skirts after lunch but I ran late...” Dean trails off, his voice pathetically growing progressively quiet with every word.
Dean gives him a breezy grin, picturing Cas in his mind's eye. "Yeah, you know, he's headstrong, knows what he wants, knows how to handle shit. Humour's dry sometimes but he sure rocks it. Dripping in fashion labels every time I see him but you know it's never about how much it cost, he genuinely loves the clothes. Looks damn sexy in his Prada coat, not gonna lie." Benny chuckles at that, which just spurs Dean on, "And when he's not being all scary cold commander, he's kind. Doesn't show it often to most people, but he's got this softer side that I wish I could see all the time."
Dallas scoffs loudly, kicking his feet up on the table as he asks, looking around at the others, "Can we really get two billion?"
She turns to him and taps the point of his nose with a perfectly manicured finger. “You worry too much. I say you should buy him a nice dinner and take him out. Even better, you could cook something. I remember your pasta was really good, you can cook him dinner, right?”
Dean snaps, “Because if you were gonna be some boring dad to Adam, then why the hell couldn’t you have been that for
The day, thankfully, remains relatively empty since most designers are too busy adding finishing touches to Emmy Award orders to have many errands left to run. Cas leaves a little earlier to get a change of clothes after a day at work and Dean goes home after him.
Hannah squints at them and answers, gesturing for the makeup artists to get to work, "I think we could redo your lipstick and eyeshadow, but Castiel is good."
"Because this society lives only to serve the rich, and we're tired of being fed scraps," Crowley answers, voice leaving no room for lack of confidence. "Aren't you tired of the wealthy getting wealthier and the poor staying as such? Have you never wondered where the money goes? This is just a liquidity injection, going to people who need the money more." The statement had come from Dean himself and Crowley thought it was a good enough answer to recycle.
At some point, Cas finds a recreated Chanel jacket in his closet. The cut isn’t perfect, but Cas gives it a rest because honestly, for someone as young as Dean was at the time, it’s good enough. At least, he assumes Dean was very young when he made it.
The robbers start their quickened pace of shooting as Angeles runs to the back, finding the machine gun. He pushes it to the front of the big hole in the wall, lifting the tarp off the Browning machine gun and aiming it. Angeles shouts, "Dallas, Berlin, get the sheet back up when they start falling back! Ready?" The two of them get over the barricade and grab each side of the fallen sheet, nodding to him. Angeles begins firing the machine gun and they hear the SWAT team yelling that it's a machine gun and to fall back.
Abaddon replies, "I have conditions." Dean tells her to name it and she starts, "First of all, I want to know you're all there. Say your names. Real name, city name, I don't care." They each say their names -- apparently, the fear of death at Abaddon's hands outshines their want to stay anonymous, because every single one of them says their real name, forgetting the cities, even Dean himself. Abaddon continues, clearly pleased, "Second, weapons down. And Dean opens the door for me."
"Well, Verbal was the only one who wasn't shown getting arrested at the start, so he let himself get arrested to tell all this," Cas says slowly like he's thinking about it even then. "And his name is 'Verbal' because he talks too much, and he's got a Turkish mom, German dad..." Cas takes out his phone and does a quick search before nodding to himself. "In a mix of that, could somewhat mean King Blabbermouth."
Cas gives him an unimpressed gaze. "You've been working here for almost a year and you never found out who ran the Paris branch? Tell me who runs the one in London."
I have atrium septum defect. I have an operation to fix it in October. I don't have a specific date yet, but it'll be around there.
While Sam tells him about Eileen, Adam tells him about Michael. Dean honestly thought someone like Adam would go for a guy a little less quiet but maybe he likes the whole tall, dark, and mysterious vibe. To each their own. And hey, maybe Michael isn't as brooding as Dean thinks he is.
It's one of Dean's best memories. Back when Mary was still there, and Sam had been oblivious to everything poisonous in the world, and John hadn't left them behind. Back when things were different and good.
"And it worked. God, you should have seen their faces, man. I wish I could have taken a picture," Sam grins. "I don't know where they even picked these lawyers up, they're practically kids. They were gonna shit their pants, I swear. Cas scared the hell out of them."
For Dean's sanity, he sent Meg down to the safes with Dallas to work on the tunnel. After her close-cut game of Russian Roulette, Dean's not that jazzed about having her hang around him, at least for a few hours, so he thought assigning her to the vaults was a better idea. She didn't complain and went off with Dallas. Without knowing about any secret rooms in the blueprints of the bank, Dean didn't know where to begin looking for someone who knew where said secret rooms are hidden, so he decides that the only way to move is forward -- sending everyone back to their duties and asking Adam to watch the footage and call him if he sees her. Adam promises not to leave his post so that's settled, and he resigns himself to watching Angeles in case Abaddon somehow sneaks in.
"Do you know how he felt?" Castiel suddenly raises his pistol at Chuck and Kansas quickly grabs his wrist, angling the gun away.
, I’ll come over for dinner,” Cas chuckles, running a hand over the surface of Dean’s desk. “I’ll go home to switch into something less high fashion and you can text me your address. I’ll be there at 8, is that alright?”
Kansas agrees to the release of Jack Kline under the condition that an unarmed officer claims him from the entrance. Jody volunteers and Sam watches as she jogs up the steps of the Bank of America as four Dalís with rifles stand guard, one of them bringing forward Jack. He's dressed in the same red coveralls as everyone else obviously, and he looks genuinely fine. Maybe a little stressed out from all the artillery inside and outside the bank, but otherwise fine.
Dean nods, smiling, “I think you’d be a fine business owner.” Michael offers him a grateful look, and then Dean clears his throat and says, “I have a favour to ask of you.”
“I don’t know,” Dean answers, shrugging as he leans against the doorway. “Cas found out about me dating Pax today.”
Of course, it's no surprise that Angeles took Jack Kline into his personal protection. He made sure he had enough to eat and was well taken care of. Maybe it's on orders by Kansas to protect one of their two biggest chess pieces, but nobody's pampering the governor and Angeles seems to be
Gabriel's already ordered a cheeseburger for Dean by the time he manages to make himself look halfway alive. He probably shouldn't meet Gabriel while he has a fever but he's sure Gabe will rain even worse hell on him if he skips out on this lunch.
Dean settles next to Cas on the hood and says, pointing to the earplugs, "You should put these in right about now." Cas obeys, putting them in his ears and giving Dean a thumbs up when he can't hear Dean anymore. Sam sits on Cas's other side, legs kicking excitedly in anticipation.
“I said a lot of things three years ago,” Michael replies, pressing his hand to his eyes as he begins to sober up.
“Oh yes, I was saving that one to pass to Charlie later,” Castiel notes, taking it off of the rack. “Alright, and this coat for when you don’t want to wear that tuxedo.” He hands Dean a tan-coloured coat from NOVAK. “This one, we never used it. It didn’t match the other things in that collection so I stored it here.”
Adam had grown fond of all the robbers during the one year Dean assembled them to prepare for the heist. So when he wasn't there to warn Balthazar about Abaddon's release and got visuals cut out when Bela died, he'd been distraught. He never got to say goodbye.
“No,” Michael answers, looking down the hallway at inmates walking by. “I came by to tell you that Anael will be collecting your father in a bit from the bus. I think she already told you that he’s in the same block as you. What are you going to do about that?”
That’s the first time Anael kissed Ruby, and the first time Anael ever felt happiness without crime.
The line is picked up very quickly, expectedly, and Jack starts saying shakily, "My name is Jack Kline, I am the son of President Rooney. I'm a hostage in the Bank of America..." There is a lot of noise from the tent, and he's sure they're scrambling to either drop the call before someone else picks up the signal and makes a headline out of it or to figure out what to do before the SWAT team breaks in. Jack continues reading, "Every hostage is fine. They've given us food and water, and there are no casualties. The governor is okay."
“Worse than double homicide?” Dean repeats. “Kid, you have seen some shit if you think murder isn’t that bad.” Alfie laughs and Dean doesn’t know if that’s unsettling or annoying.
“Anyone ever told you you talk too much?” Nathaniel suddenly asks, turning to stare at Gabriel with complete annoyance. Dean looks between them, already beginning to try and size up the guards, and Nathaniel says, “I don’t know what shitty ass prison you were at before where the COs were your fucking friends, but that ain’t here. Here, you’re our bitches. I don’t joke around with pieces of shit. Get in your fucking cell before I give you a shot.”
“Shit,” Cas mutters, running a hand through his hair. It messes it up further and only adds to his worrying outlook. “Dean, go.”
He doesn't find much; there's still some people milling around watching the Factory despite the time and of course the police are still discussing among themselves on what to do. Gilda just waltzing into the Factory was a damn miracle. Adam wasn't sure how long they could have held their ground if they didn't have someone of national value in there with them especially with people like Naomi and Ketch heading the negotiation.
“Called Bradley Cooper and Margot Robbie’s agents, everyone’s informed and I’m gonna book the flights for LA,” Dean says. “Otherwise, it’s all done.”
“So that’s why Adam got all scared?” She asks. Michael nods wordlessly — there’s no need for any more elaboration or explanation. It’s obvious Gabriel also came because of this problem. Since Gabriel and Michael were in prison together as cellmates, it makes sense that Gabriel would be concerned enough to join the break-out mission. “Does Dean know?”
Dad refused to give me dinner yesterday because I didn't come home before 6 (I was distracted texting Cas and missed the bus) so Crowley got me to sneak out my window and took me out to eat with his mom. I love Rowena, man. She's awesome. And Dad's dinner sounded like crap anyway, he just heated up leftover pizza from last night. Leftovers are good, don't get me wrong, but it could be better...
"Hey, John fucked you up royally. You get to act like this," Sam insists, folding his arms across the back of the chair as he sits on it backwards. "He's just being a dick and you and Cas are not at fault at all." Sam's phone chooses right then to ring and he gives Dean an apologetic look before pulling it out of his pocket to see who it is. Normally, Sam would turn his phone off but in the case of pressing clients, he couldn't. He frowns when he reads the caller ID and says, "John's on the phone."
"Shut up," Dean mutters, entering the library and crossing the room to get to the shelf with the spellbooks. "Let's just find that stupid spell."
Dean knows it's not personal, but it still aches in his chest as he and Cas finally make it into the cab and take off. He doesn't voice it, but it doesn't mean it didn't hurt.
The phone rings in the police tent and Ketch shushes everyone loudly, pointing at an IT girl to accept the call and record it, try to reverse engineer the inevitable voice modulation.
“No, you don’t.” Adam frowns, unconvinced. “I’ll come back here. Since I’m an employee, nobody will be hunting me down if I leave. You just stay here and wait for me.”
“Less than three weeks?” Cas echoes absently, and Dean sits down heavily on the armrest next to Cas.
The bug goes silent after that and Naomi instantly turns towards Ketch, saying, "We'll invade at 2. They'll be at their weakest, everything would be packed up, they'll be trying to organise."
Meg had wanted to pay Castiel's office a visit to ask his opinion on a custom design for Najwa Nimri, a white dress. Instead, she finds out about Hester Garrison and her intentions to get Cas kicked out of his own company. Meg had to force herself not to laugh out loud. NOVAK has Cas's name slapped across it and she wants to take charge? Does she think Cas's employee's loyalties belong to NOVAK or to Castiel and does she really think they would listen to her? Did she even figure out what to do once Cas was out of the business?
"I'm not letting my brother go in without me." That had been Sam's very simple explanation, and it was that that convinced Adam to go along.
"I --" Dean's coughs cut him off and Cas watches, horrified, as Dean's blurry eyes stare at his bloodied hand before mumbling almost incoherently, "I don’t have gloves."
Dean and Meg carefully make their way down the hallways of the bank, almost back-to-back in the way they move as they check every room with rifles raised. Even with the problem of Abaddon running loose in the bank, his mind is only on Angeles downstairs. He ends up almost hitting a pillar, deep in thought and concern, and Meg's gaze snaps towards him, "We need to focus."
Clothes are in better shape than Dean's -- less frayed edges -- but they have some stains. An effort has been made to wash it with the moderately paler denim around the stains but it's been soiled too often. Alcohol isn't recreational for him, it's a habit.
"The only thing we can do is be sure if you're right or wrong on that but your intuition has never failed me," Castiel ponders.
Sam ignites a match and drops it into the bowl. A bright beacon of light SHOOTS upwards from the bowl. Right then, the bowls BREAK APART and the beacon cuts off.
Sam stands and says to Zachariah, "They never meant to escape. They wanted to stay in the bank. Think about it, they left the money at the entrance. If they intended to leave and got caught, they would have still taken the cash with them. They let it fly off into the wind and went back inside. They're confident. If they weren't, they'd have tried to run already. You were ready to send in SWAT yesterday and they're still in there." Zachariah ponders over Sam's rushed explanation as he adds, "They have the president's son and the governor of the bank, plus sixty-five other hostages. They have fucking state secrets in that building. They're
Ash explains, putting down his laptop so he can sign as he talks, "A 35-metre deep elevator shaft that'll take us to an antechamber with a retractable drawbridge. Don't have to worry about what it'll trigger. As far as the system knows, we didn't break-in, so we're fine. Let's move to the second door. Rowena, can you get the styrofoam boards and tape?"
Michael and Adam were able to get Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve off from work to celebrate with Dean, Sam and Eileen. Dean could tell they felt bad that Cas wasn’t there but it was for the best. Adam was excited for his first Christmas with Sam and Dean and got them fairly expensive presents; a Nanoleaf Rhythm device that lights up to the beat of the music you’re playing and a costly bottle of Cabernet Shiraz 2017. That purchase has Adam going on a rant about how it’s absurd that there are bottles of wine over $100,000, and Dean thinking about how Cas would have appreciated the good wine.
“Maybe it is,” Cas returns a teasing grin of his own. It feels good to joke like this with each other.
building and breathes in deeply. It’s like the start of a new adventure, as cliché as it sounds. He feels like fashion school is paying off — and yeah, maybe being a personal assistant doesn’t have much to do with fashion, but Dean has a plan. He’s going to build up a good rapport with Castiel Novak and when the time is right, he’ll show him his portfolio and hopefully, he’ll be promoted to a
“If I have to hear the word 'rocky' one more time...” Kevin says from behind them, sitting in the empty space next to Dean with his own bowl of ramen. “So happy to see you, Charlie.”
Dean considers it. Maybe Cas should stay, he had a leader quality to him and could handle the hostages in his absence. He was his former second-in-command for a reason. Or he could sort out the diamonds with Detroit.
"I'm afraid I know as much as you do," Mick says regrettably. "I don't know who they shot but my best guess is it's your brother."
Dean can’t say he didn’t deserve it — it’d be a lie, at least to Dean. Maybe Cas would argue and say Dean didn’t have a choice sometimes and that he did what he could with what he had, has always tried to save everyone, but Dean didn’t feel the same.
When the summer runway show comes round, Cas finds ways to keep his mind off of smoking. He gets other ways of distraction and finds that chewing gum keeps him occupied. It helps that Dean himself promised to cut off smoking completely too.
"The thing about us getting an apartment after college," Dean shrugs. "It's pretty far, but we could do it, right?"
While waiting for five minutes to pass, Dean turns to Cas and nods to the doorway so they can talk in the corridor alone. Cas raises an eyebrow but follows him out. Once they're out of Crowley's earshot, Dean says, hushed, "Seven days. We'll be out of here in seven days, okay? Just one week. Don't be mad."
Castiel and Bela reported Hannah to Vogue and because she didn't do any real damage, she had only been issued a warning which was fine with both of them. Hannah seemed pretty harmless in general if only a little misguided. Castiel thought that since she didn't end up ruining his and Dean's careers, she should probably be allowed the chance to be set on the right path.
The Impala stops and the four of them get out of the car. Sam and Dean set up the spell as per the instructions Michael wrote for them.
"I know you won't. The other thing is the cease and desist, you know, get him to cancel the collection, not sell or loan the pieces. Get him and Chuck to pay for using your work uncredited," Sam says. "Plagiarism's big but I don't think anyone involved wants to take this to court. I don't think you do either."
“You’re not wrong.” Dean chuckles a little at that before sobering up. “I know I’ll love Cas the same whether he does kill her or not because honestly if the roles were reversed, I’d probably kill her too. The problem is that I’m not sure how well I will be able to keep the cops off our scent if anyone’s blood is spilt.”
“Someone doesn’t like you? Sounds fake to me,” Dean says. Cas casts a soft smile his way and Dean feels butterflies in his chest, in the most disgusting cliché way. “He doesn’t know what he’s on about. At least this Michael dude’s got brains.”
I want to make him a god. Once he is free of his sinful flesh can he begin the path towards enlightenment. He will take care of us.
“But don’t mistake this for kindness,” Anael says. “It’s purely out of obligation. Thank you for everything you’ve done for all of us the past few years but the moment we part ways tomorrow, I don’t want to see any of you ever again.”
Sam nods absently, asking, “Dean, can I talk to you?” Dean follows him a few feet away from Eileen, Jo, Ellen, and Bobby, and Sam starts, “I feel so bad.”
When the truck starts moving, Cas opens up the book Michael gave him before the heist started to a random page. “Alright, everyone. Showtime.”
“That’s true,” Anna admits just as Anael catches something on the cameras. She leans closer to get a better look.
He found two diamond anvil cells in the basement of the Diamonds Factory while making sure there are no hostages hiding there. He brings them upstairs and shows the anvils to Dean and Detroit. “We can make our own diamonds.”
What makes things a little tougher is the FBI agent walking around. She knew Crowley from the first heist and was unsuccessfully interrogating him. She knew Dean and Adam’s face as well and if she chanced upon either of them then the “game” is over.
Bela is dressed looking classy as always, wearing a coat that looks like an ordinary trench coat on the outside, but Bela is obviously excited about it. She says, raising one end of the coat, "Look under! Thierry Mugler's coat is just wonderful." Underneath it is an explosion of colourful firework-like patterns. It's beautiful under the streetlights in the dark. Charlie loses her mind about it, gushing about how she wants to get the coat too, and then Crowley and her go into the building, leaving Bela and Dean outside alone.
A shot of them all standing at the map table, Sam and Adam on opposite sides and Dean at the head of it. The three brothers.
“Look, if he does find out, then I’ll claim full responsibility,” Dean bargains. “I’m the one who said we should keep it from him. I want to protect Adam as much as you do. That includes making sure he never sees the inside of a jail cell. We’re on the same side here.”
Dinner is short when it happens. Dean makes them the fastest food he can make — pancakes. Cas chastises Dean for feeding them pancakes for dinner, but there's no real venom behind it and he ends up eating five of them with so much syrup that Dean has to stop him before he goes crazy on it. Dean insists on lighting candles to "set the mood", and Cas blows them out every time he relights them.
