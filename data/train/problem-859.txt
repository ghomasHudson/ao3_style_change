His fingers move more delicately than they ever have -- except for the possible exception of the first time he held Rosie -- as he grips the hem of Sherlock’s T-shirt between two fingers, and when he nods his head slowly, curls bobbing with the movement, John tugs off the shirt as gently as he can.
“Why have I been making those noises?” And here is where Sherlock swallows and his eyes burn with something fiercer and angrier than his previous painful kindness. “Take a guess,” he says. “You’re smart enough to be able to figure it out. It’s not from my torture scars, which are long-since healed, if a bit agitated and poorly formed. I’ve done little in the way of physical activity in these recent weeks -- I’ve been too busy getting high and wallowing in nightmares to do anything so strenuous as that. Tell me, John, what hurt me?”
John’s almost overwhelmed with the inexplicable urge to touch them all, these marks. To slide the silk dressing robe from his shoulders, absorb the smells from the pale gray T-shirt, and kiss the pinkish-purple radiating warmth of the scars he could only imagine. He got those protecting me, he thinks.
He sighs before John can make any such move, any raw emotions being swept away by a mask of annoyance.“What do you want, John? What was so important I must be removed from what is sure to be proved far more important tasks?”
She scoffs at him again and sits up straighter in her seat, eyes intent on his.“You’re talking about him like he’s a daft little puppy or something. Sherlock is a grown man, and I’m given to believe that he’s a pretty smart one, too. He can make his own choices. If he thinks what you’ve done is unforgivable, he’ll make that call. Not you.”
“Get married? Kiss? Declare your undying love? Have sex in an alley? Anything really. Just as long as you two finally removed your heads from your arses and got together, really. Which you still haven’t done, by the way! The pool’s ginormous now; you’ve no idea how much money some people are set to win by this. Ridiculous really.”
Sherlock’s eyes are shining with something beyond tears, beyond the emotion of the moment. The worry line around his eyes have melted away and he looks younger than he has in years.
Sherlock slid his arms back and around to grip John's wrists, fingers pressed delicately to his thrumming pulse point. "John..." he said softly, lingering panic streaking through his words, his eyes. "Are you alright?"
“Okay, here it is: Talk to the man. Give him something from the heart. I know that sounds like some Hollywood bullshit, but by God that crap works. If you want to show that man he’s loved, do it. Don’t nammy about it. Give him something to hold onto when he doubts your feelings, to show that you’re constant and devoted and that you’re not budging an inch from his side, even
“There are-- there are scars, down my back, and along my sides. A few inside me, I believe. And a-- a broken rib that didn’t heal in quite the way it was supposed to have. Among other things.”
Sherlock blinked at him and wondered at how John felt so much and he hadn't known. Love and caring, despite what John seemed to believe, were not completely foreign ideas. In fact, Sherlock noticed, they weren't really foreign at all. More like they had been locked away in a far closet and left to shrivel and be forgotten, and John (and perhaps the bullet) was (were) the key(s).
There are tears in Sherlock’s eyes that he’s not bothering to hide anymore. “I could never kill you, John. Even at the expense of my own life. You know that.”
John's face was so anguished. Each breath he took now was gasping and fought for. Tears, even, were tucked into the corners of his eyes.
And so John tells her his plight, his lack of gift-ness and the fear of this previously undiscovered bottomless well of feelings. Saying it out loud makes him feel silly, but it’s nice to talk about this with someone, even if he’s never even had this discussion with himself before.
The words rattled around his ears as Sherlock finally took in the room. Kneeling beside him was John. Surrounding them and the steady hum of panic was the unsuspectingly ordinary London flat in which dwelled their most recent Greatest-Threat--Newest-Foe, and wrapped around his belly was a rigidly tied white cloth decorated with large plumes of red.
Sherlock makes another little noise as he shifts to reach the pickle jar left on the counter, and John’s guilty curiosity is insatiable once more. What are these noises? “Hey, Sherlock,” he calls, too loudly in the pleasant silence.
“She, actually. Figured you would like the name Hamish either way,” John smirks. “She’s an Irish Water Spaniel, and she’s hypoallergenic. I'm given to believe that she's hardworking and attentive, inquisitive and brave. Affectionate with those she loves.” John smiles hugely, more in love with this man than
And it had to be just the right amount of subtle, too, because John had never actually said anything about any of these feelings, never acted upon them or even mentioned them. How do
“No, but it could very easily become my thing,” John winks. This flirting feels so natural, so casual, John isn’t sure how he hadn’t picked it up before.
The smile dims, though, as he ducks his head down to place a kiss on a cigarette burn that looks about two years old. He can’t get over how much pain Sherlock’s been through for him, to keep him safe, and all for what? A self-righteous best friend who can barely even admit -- a beating and  two fucking years later -- that he appreciates what Sherlock did and might be willing to reciprocate. And what if Sherlock got over any kind of...romantic, feelings he’d ever had for John?
John can’t focus for the rest of his shift. His head is filled with vague ideas, none of them worthy of his best friend, and his clients leave his office with unsatisfied hesitation.
The mention of Mary brings Sherlock back to himself, and he pushes himself away from John with as much force as his addled body can muster. Oh, he's really done it this time. Now that John can see he's alright and will eventually recover, he'll go home to his doting, pregnant wife and never speak to him again.
John snorts a little and continues bustling around the kitchen. “Then what was the point of asking, you arse?”
John clears his throat and reaches for a random gift. His brain is stuck on the one he left behind in his room. He should probably go get it out… But the surprise is so sweet that he decides to save it for the end.
Sherlock moves over to the fridge once the water’s been set to boil and roots around in the back. The experiments have, blessedly, been designated to the bottom drawer except for special circumstances, and even then they are labeled and sectioned off from the rest of the food.
Lab equipment would be right up Sherlock’s alley, but it feels too impersonal to John, and besides, where would he get it now? He could just wrap a bow on a beaker he already has, or let him keep the mug of his that Sherlock had commandeered for experiments upon John’s return to 221B. No, no, Sherlock would see right through that! Besides, he could do better. No go.
John’s grin splits apart his face until he can barely push his lips together to kiss the other man’s vertebrae. “That is quite a long time.”
John perks up and instantly forgets his anger. Before he can ask, Sherlock holds up his hand and looks at him with intensely dark blue eyes. “John…” he says. “Whatever I tell you, you must understand that absolutely none of it was your fault.”
No, no, he didn’t forget; he’s been putting it off. Every time he tried thinking about a gift for his flatmate, he could immediately see that the task was insurmountable, so complex that he simply decided to work on other gifts first. When he thought about what he wanted to give him, he quickly knew he was out of his depth.
Part of Sherlock was touched that John (a living, breathing John at that, a real one) was so affected by his death, but a larger part only felt concern. Feeling grief so intensely surely was no good for his health...
“Do you not feel comfortable enough with me to be yourself?” he asks, and again there is a pause where all Sherlock can do is stare at him, owlishly. “You’ve never been afraid to be an arse around me, and I’ve always been okay with it because not only did you have your limits it also meant that you were settling in around me, that you saw me as a friend.”
if there were dinosaur alien monsters trying to tear you apart. Tell him that you want him to be part of your family, and that you want to be part of his.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and murmured, "'S unnecessary," then strengthened his voice to say, "Come here."
“I’ve got something for you, John....I’m not sure how well you’ll like it. If you don’t, I can fix it…”
That’s probably as close to a resolution as this conversation is going to get and it answers none of John’s questions, but it’s also almost a compliment so he won’t push any further. Sherlock thinks he’s a mystery, and that’s got to make him special.
They pull away with a soft smack, and John is enraptured by the sight of Sherlock’s lips reddened by kisses. Unable to resist, John presses a dozen more across the other man’s face, smooching the tip of his nose, the high cheekbones, his high brow, the soft skin of his blushing red cheeks.”It’s a Christmas miracle…” John murmurs against his lips with a smile.
Sherlock scoffs lightly, but without his usual bite. “So you want to kiss it better, is that what this is?”
He’ll be happy, now, fucking ecstatic, that Sherlock is letting him kiss his shoulders and his scars, is letting him see something so intensely private that this could be on par with sex in that mad genius’s mind. He’ll take what he can get, like a dog begging for scraps, because that’s honestly more than he deserves. He’d never realized what a good man Sherlock was, so noble and ridiculously forgiving.
These are not best friend feelings. These are far bigger and scarier than he could have ever imagined, far more joyous than he ever dared hope -- or possibly more catastrophic than he ever could have feared.
Together, they go through Rosie’s presents (of which there are far too many). They discover that she has a particular fondness for the solar system mobile Sherlock bought her, the Curious George books, and the colorful building blocks made of soft, doughy wood. John can already tell she’s going to be just as creative and smart and explosively curious as her surrogate father (how would Sherlock feel about being her father?).
Sherlock remained impassive but his mind was buzzing with the familiar excitement the prospect of an interesting case always provoked.
What I look like, John thought, but he didn’t say it aloud. Was it a date? Or was SH as lonely as he appeared to be, looking for comradeship and nothing else? After all, sharing a meal, even with a stranger, didn’t commit him to anything. God knows he could use a new friend.
“First of all, you didn’t ruin everything, okay? Granted, neither Sherlock nor I thought you would be here tonight…”
John finally broke the silence, saying in a husky voice “If I tell you I’m hungry and not for food, do you…?”
Him and Detective Inspector Lestrade were going to have a long talk about the precise meaning of personal matters.
“Welcome to the queer side bro, we’ve got rainbow cookies! Get this fine ass of yours ready for your man, boy, he won’t know what hit him!”
Should he wait? Should he go? Has he been a fool to believe Sherlock, to let him go so far under his skin John wasn’t even sure he could remove everything that has occurred between them?
He has intended it as a playful question, something they could both use to carry on flirting and getting into each other’s pants. But Sherlock didn’t look like he has got the memo. Instead, he was considering John with a serious look.
“What were you waiting for to pick this room? I don’t know about you, but I don’t really fancy sleeping outside at this time of the year!”
She shook his head, her fingers unconsciously checking that no stray lock of hair has escaped from her hijab, before replying “I just wanted to know if you were still interested in the next workshop on Sunday with the Elfrida society?”
Lips parted, soft wonder written on his features, as if he couldn’t believe that they were still holding hands.
The rest of his sentence was suddenly muffled under John’s mouth. He has pulled Sherlock down, standing on the balls of his feet, and he was kissing him. Kissing him with a fervour Sherlock hasn’t expected, which ignited deep in him something fierce.
“Mister Smith, would you please go outside? It would be very unpleasant if Mrs Hudson would come back and catch us unawares…”
During these first months, he eagerly followed the trail left by his brother through Belgium, France, Austria and then Eastern Europe.
He should definitely have waited for their flat’s intimacy before provoking Sherlock into answering him. But Sherlock seemed to be a roll, his deep voice echoing in the whole carriage.
The story would have ended there, with this unexpected acknowledgement of what they were for each other, if no other feeling has come into play.
He has grown up, for fuck’s sake, he wasn’t the same cowardly silent teen he has been when Harry and him were still living together under their parent’s roof! Why should he care about people like Helen, Dave or anyone else really thought about Harry? Hasn’t he decided to get out of this fucking closet and accepting what he was? Hasn’t he texted Sherlock earlier, practically begging him to agree to a date with him?
Don’t do this, he told himself. You’re stronger than this, you can resist him for a while, at least.
John looked up at him so quickly Sherlock heard the audible snap in his neck. He looked completely thunderstruck.
Molly, who seemed constantly afraid of speaking aloud yet didn’t hesitate to pull Sherlock a peg or two when he was too obnoxious.
“She’s the author of several legislative projects directed against "propaganda of homosexuality" including the infamous Russian LGBT propaganda law,” he resumed, observing closely John.
He has chickened out at the last moment and judging from the look Sherlock was giving him, he has noticed it.
And then he has remembered how his companion hasn’t hesitated to jump on the suspect’s back, pushing him to the ground.
“But I want to,” Sherlock blurted, making up his mind on the spot. He took a deep breath before carrying on. “I should tell you the night when Lestrade had to arrest me while I was dressed up as… Well, you can say as a woman.”
Sherlock didn't manage to completely smother his smile. It was a thing of unexpected beauty, like the moon coming out from under the clouds and blessing them with its silvery light. John stared at him, completely enthralled.

“And I keep telling you, that’s Sherlock we’re talking about,” Greg thwarted him with ease. “A true genius, but not when feelings are concerned. That’s uncharted territory for him, you’ll have to guide him through it…”
How he would conceal his embarrassment and hurt behind his coldest veneer, how Gregory would react, maybe willing to reach out at first – a pitiful attempt at “no hard feelings between us” – before realizing that it was no use.
His first impulse was to follow him in the stairs and ask him why he was behaving in such a manner – of course, he hasn’t forgotten anything in this damned lobby, a child of five would have seen through this pitiful excuse! – but, for once in his life, Sherlock showed restraint.
“I’m sorry, Sir, for this incident. But it’s nearly time for the gentlemen to rotate seats, so I’m sure you may already move on to the next person…”
He clenched his hands into fists. No doubt it would be very hard to do so. In fact, in comparison with this, his recovery time after he has been shot in Afghanistan and demobbed afterwards would look like a walk in the park.
Molly has realized afterwards it has been the final nail in the coffin of her impossible infatuation.
How pathetic, he thought. How perfectly inadequate. He had to try again, to try better, he couldn't just say that and expect...
“You see, my family has always been very well-versed in the fine arts. My mother is teaching history of art at la Sorbonne university and my father… (She turned her palms upwards, as if she could encompass the whole house) I’ve inherited from him my admiration for Renaissance works and a certain taste for the mysteries… which are clearly abounding as far as Da Vinci is concerned!”
He remained motionless for a while, taking deep breaths, the only noise troubling the deep silence of his flat.
Friends taking advantage of her when she was at university – “Thanks for the notes, Mol, you’re a peach!” before forgetting her when they were going out.
Before he could rally, John pinned him down, sitting up until he could put a knee on the man’s lower back and holding his hands together in a strong grip.
He only heard a whimper before Sherlock raised his head, a dejected expression written all over his face. Despite his self-confidence and his very conviction that Sherlock wasn’t regretting their near kiss, John swallowed hard.
He bit his tongue. It would have been useless to retort that no bed would be large enough to accommodate the three of them – Sherlock, John and the cumbersome, bordering-on-maddening crush John got on his flatmate/friend/fucking crazy genius I can’t live without (all of three mentions being perfectly applicable, thank you very much).
He didn’t miss the startled look in Mycroft’s eyes or the light flush spreading across on his cheekbones. However, it didn’t last. Mycroft’s whole face hardened and his voice grew progressively colder as he replied in the tone he undoubtedly intended when he had the misfortune of coming across persons as cheeky and foolish as Greg at this moment.
A lanky 27-year-old man, who has ditched uni in his first year and discovered drugs shortly afterwards.
They didn’t run very far, Sherlock abruptly stopping as soon as he found that after a few yards, a part of the Clos Lucé’s external wall wasn’t as high as the others. He looked up at the barrier, putting his hand on the brick.
He let the young man slip out of his grasp, rushing after his one decisive asset. To his amazement, the stranger didn’t try to steal it from him. Instead he stood up, waiting for John to get his hand on the gun again before saying “I’ll give you one more clue, then. He said it might be necessary.”
He blindly obeyed, his mind addled by such a surge of lust he has never known before. Luckily for him, he only had to take a few steps forward to find the nearest wall. He leant against it, laying his head on his forearm while his right hand found his cock.
“It’s too much, isn’t it?” he stresses too earnestly. “I’ve overstepped. I’m sorry, John, I really am--”
The blogger settles down by the tree and places his daughter in his lap. “Where’ve you been hiding these gifts, Sherlock? Surely you didn’t just buy them.”
The smoggy hands became a little less smoggy, and they came in front of him and stroked his sharp palms away from his face.
Just then, John hears something moving around on the street outside. It sounds like jingle bells, but no one on this block was so cliche as to be playing Santa, and Sherlock had scared away carolers and the Salvation Army years ago. Who would be out so early on Christmas?
John and Rosie play by the tree as Sherlock ducks into the kitchen to make a pot of hot chocolate. The older man is tempted to ask if Sherlock would like to change into his pajamas, but he keeps his mouth shut once he glimpses how the red button down tugs across his chest. If Sherlock’s comfortable in that, who is John to persuade him otherwise?
Tears soften John’s focus on the gift in front of him and the box in his lap. Sherlock really has outdone himself. It’s a shadowbox, one crafted out of thick cherry wood and polished glass. Inside is a picture of Mary and him (and Sherlock) on their wedding day, smiling widely at one another. There are pressed flowers from her bouquet, a strip of lace from her wedding gown, a necklace she wore. These are the pieces of their life together, the happy, bright cameos that only ache with remembrance and not with betrayal.
Some of the bruises are swollen -- those ones definitely from John’s fists -- and his lower ribs seem just the tiniest bit off-center, like one or two had broken and not healed correctly. There are light pink circles dotting his shoulder blades that look like cigarette burns, long and thin lines that could be the mark of a knife, the knotted skin of Mary’s bullet wound clotting on his left side.  All of this and so much more until the patches of smooth, unaltered skin are sparse and starved for space.
Sherlock said there were scars, numerous and healed and creative, but there is a fine difference between hearing that sort of thing and actually seeing the remnants of torture on one’s best friend. The detective looks at John thoughtfully for a moment, assessing whether or not John’s about to freak out again, and comfortably settles back against the bed once he’s certain the other man won’t do anything rash.
“Sherlock, it’s not a kindness hiding your hurt from me!” John shouts, and it feels like he’s made some sort of admission, a pivotal confession though he’s not sure why he would ever want to hide these feelings. “I...I worry about you.”
This is said with far less mirth than before, the corners of his mouth dropping down as he fills two mugs and drops the necessary sweeteners into each. Sherlock moves with the automation that only comes from memorization and routine, dropping and stirring and floating as if John had never left 221B.
John tightened, then clomped forward one notch. His frustrations and fears were stewing (Sherlock saw it in his stance) and beginning to froth over.
"You're alright? So you're a dream, then. The God or whoever's in charge here must be very kind to have given you to me... Or maybe it's a form of punishment?" Sherlock was quiet for a moment, thoughtful. he gently, slowly, removed his hands from John's wrists, dragging his fingers reluctantly. "I apologize for my episode, New John. I thought the other John had died." He looked up, the chaos in his eyes neatly packed away and replaced with a cool indifference (the kind that had become his signature countenance). "Are there murders here?"
Pain welled up in him, dull at first, and gradually became searing and sharp. At some point it became difficult to differentiate the problems of pain and the actual hole in his stomach. The pain had created a wound of its own.
John opens the paper around the box with careful, reverent fingers and slides the gift into his lap gently.
A sob split in the wake of Sherlock's confession. He smiled brightly, regardless of his scarlet teeth, for he needed no more. The weight of his words was lifted. Whispering, Sherlock pressed a kiss to John's palm with the words, "Thank you for my last deduction, love." Then, he stepped back into the voices and happily let himself drown.
The detective’s face looks stricken, and his hands curl with the pain of an invisible blow. He blinks rapidly to dull the sudden brightness in his eyes. “Get out,” he says, but John’s feet are layered with concrete and he can’t move.
He turns to observe John once more after he’s gotten the pickle jar in his arms. It looks like he put in a physical effort to avoid making that grunt again, which is so startling John’s almost bursting with the need to interrogate. He holds himself back, though, because watching Sherlock close up again is in no way an acceptable consequence of obtaining answers. John’s willing to ask, to attempt to sate his curiosity and see if Sherlock is willing to be open like that, but if his satisfaction comes at the price of Sherlock’s comfort -- or, heaven forbid, their friendship -- he would never bring up the subject again for as long as he could.
“Ach, who cares about semantics when I’m living with a beautiful mad man who jumps off buildings and leaves kidneys in the fridge? As far as I care, I’m Sherlocksexual. I am grovel-at-Sherlock’s-feet-until-I-die-sexual.”
"-erlock!" a different, familiar voice cried. There! There was where he had heard the panic, that familiar, desperate voice. Was it John's? Why should John be so terrified, so caughtout and frightened?
John sighs and presses a firm kiss against the knot of Mary’s bullet. If he ever gets a chance to do this again (and he prays to God that he does) he’s going to lavish attention to that spot until the scar cosmically stops existing -- or at least the pain from it does. Something tells John that Sherlock is already halfway there, without his help. “You have forgiven me too easily, Sherlock. I can’t say I’m not ridiculously grateful -- I am, doggedly so -- but I-- I don’t want to put any sort of pressure on you. It frightens me, how easily I could ruin everything again.”
“I know you do, John,” he says, and he closes his eyes against the softness of his own voice. “I don’t...I don’t want you to worry any more than you have to. You- you have a daughter, for chrissake, I should be the least of your concerns.” He wipes his hand down his face and some kind of resolve twists and hardens his face. “No. I don’t think this is a good idea. I’m sorry, but I cannot, in good conscience, burden you with my problems when I have given you enough of your own.” He looks sullenly at his sandwich, like he’s completely lost his appetite.
“Yes. The scars out here and the scars up here.” He bends down slowly, gently, giving Sherlock plenty of time to push him away, before he presses a soft kiss against the salty skin of the detective’s forehead.
John lifts up and lets Sherlock roll over, his curls falling back from his face to reveal his stunning eyes. “That’s much better,” he murmurs. Sherlock tugs on John’s thighs so that he’s sitting on him again. John’s fascinated with how comfortably he fits in Sherlock’s lap.
“Please,” they say at the same time. Sherlock continues, barely even acknowledging they had spoken together. “We’ll still be friends, if that’s what you’re worried about. I find it very hard to let you go, even for a few hours.”
“Yeah, you could say that. I want them to feel like someone special, but I think I’ve messed it all up. I...I’ve hurt them quite a lot this year, and I can’t even remember how much I hurt them in the past… I need this Christmas to go well, but I’m worried I haven’t done enough. Gosh, I don’t think I’ve done anything at all, I’ve been so scared of starting.”
“I didn’t want to tell you, John, and this is exactly why!” Sherlock shouts back, slowly than he should be able. “I can see what you’re doing, that little spiral of self-doubt you’re throwing yourself into. I’m not angry at you, and I never was, you absolute fool! Your guilt is unwarranted and undeserved! I don’t need your pity, and I do not want it!!”
John chuckles and nuzzles his face into Sherlock’s neck. He never in a million years would have guessed that this man was so thoughtful, so caring as to build him a keepsake of his late wife. He’s this close to abandoning his inhibitions and kissing him square on those delightful cupid bows of his. But first he has to explain himself, has to show Sherlock that he can be just as caring and thoughtful and vulnerable.
Beeping. Individual pips, two beats apart. Sterile smell -- hospital? Unexplained freedom concerning transport below the waist -- hospital gown. Eugh.
Despite the evidence, Sherlock refused to believe this result was an effect of him, of his impending perishment, or the lake of blood flushing out of him. People didn't feel like that for him, didn't care like that. Surely something else had occurred while he had been otherwise occupied? Certainly John's cry was merely his answer to glancing Sherlock in this state, if anything at all related to Sherlock.
“I know I’ve hurt you before, and I’m terrified that I’ll hurt you again. Rosie and I...We’ll always be with you. I will never leave you again. Rosie already thinks of you like another father, and I..If you want to, I’d like you to be her other father. But that’s-- that’s a discussion for another day. Hopefully soon, I’ll say. For right now, though, I just want you to know, that I will never, ever leave you. And, as a symbol of this commitment:”
John starts slowly making the sandwiches, careful to layer Sherlock’s in the precise strata that always pleased him. Bread, five slices of lunch meat ham, three pickles, two more slices of ham, spurt of mustard, bread. He puts it on one of their less-than-nice plates, adds a full pickle and some crisps, and goes over to the table where he is now sat, reading an online article about the effect of gallium dust on gold necklaces. The detective is wearing glasses on the very edge of his nose and a tiny bit of gray shines on the sides of his ears, only visible in this direct light under the lamp.
The detective gets upset then, his face clouding over with thunderstorms. “That is exactly why I have not told you. I can’t live in this place having you blame yourself for things you had no control over, things you didn’t even know were happening! I cannot allow your guilt and especially not your pity! They are incredibly useless to me and I have put you through enough to allow you this kindness.”
"They brought you back here, and I texted Mary that I wouldn't be coming home. You haven't woken up since that awful woman's flat."
The detective turns away from John and back to his laptop and absentmindedly nibbles through his sandwich. The conversation is, effectively, over.
“Not that, you pervert! I just meant you. He loves you, you bloody bastard, for reasons I can’t understand. He’ll love whatever you give him, because it’s from you. More than anything, he
John sits in his misery for only a few more moments before squeezing Sherlock’s hands and drying his face. He picks up the tube of ointment again once they’ve settled back on the bed, John straddling the back of Sherlock’s thighs as the detective lies comfortably on his stomach, and gestures vaguely to Sherlock’s body. “Can I...Can I?”
John reaches the top of Sherlock’s back and he starts trickling kisses down his neck, nibbling on his ear, the hollow below the lobe, teething at the delightful mole on the back of his neck.
He made another face, one that was more from annoyance than embarrassment or pain. “Mycroft said I’d stopped doing that.”
The genius -- who already has tears pouring down his face -- gasps and rushes forward to cradle the snuffling puppy. He hands Rosie to John as he smothers the baby dog with kisses.
John blushes and kisses the skin just above the waistband of his pajama bottoms before moving upward again. He whispers into Sherlock’s neck, “If you’d like it to be.”
The thought sent a shocking, explosive jolt of anguish to his heart, and he bolted straight up. No. Nonononono!!! He'd left because he knew John was safe! He shouldn't be here with him; he shouldn't be dead!
But this isn’t about him, as much as he wishes he could proclaim his burgeoning feelings at the top of his lungs and then make love to this beautiful man he held in his arms while erasing all the pain and hurt and scars from his brilliant mind. That can wait until Sherlock has healed on his own, has healed enough to be able to make a thoroughly conscious decision when it comes to getting involved with him. Anything at this stage would feel too manipulative on John’s part, so soon after abusing Sherlock both mentally and physically, however obliviously or unintentionally.
“I can’t...I can’t trust that, Sarah, as much as I want to. And even if that is true, I’ve hurt him so many times, who’s to say I won’t hurt him again? Won’t accidentally leave him behind and lose him forever? I don’t want to be responsible for ruining him.”
Who. John feels the answer wash over him in a wave of black sludge. There isn’t a what, and there’s not even a question of who. He knows who did this.
“Christ, Sherlock, what I did to you was inexcusable!” he shouts and stands from his seat with an explosive scrape of his chair. He starts pacing, wanting to tear out large chunks from his hair and set them on fire in his stomach, choking to death on his own burning body. “I could have-- should have-- stopped after that first punch. You were down and you weren’t going to hurt anyone, but I kept going. I didn’t want to stop. A bloody serial killer thought I’d done enough to you before I did, and I’m your best friend.”
“Look,” John says, and he’s breathing heavily but he has to get this out before Sherlock closes up for good. “If you don’t want to tell me, that’s fine. You’re not obligated to. But don’t bottle up for my sake.”
John wants to tell him that he’s the exact same way but he knows that that’s likely what Sherlock is expecting from him and he decidedly doesn’t want to live up to any of Sherlock’s meager expectations for him right now. Especially not the ones of him leaving the detective now when he’s never needed to stay more.
Two voices shouted out at Sherlock's violent awakening. One, Sherlock, for a jab sharp as fire strangled the breath from him. His fingers grasped his stomach tightly, head forced on his knees as he panted for breath, sweaty hair sticking to his bare legs like seaweed.
"John," he began, "I'm not that g-good withhh...emotions." Sherlock's hand fumbled and gripped John's. "B-ut with-th you... I feeeel- nice. I-ye fe-el l-love. For- you. I...love- you."
“Well after everything I’ve done I should hope so,” Sherlock says jokingly, but with a twinkle in his eye that makes John think Sherlock is about weep (hopefully with joy). “What happened to being ‘not gay’?”
John picks up Rosie and places her on the ground beside their Christmas tree. Sherlock peddles by the door and bounces from foot to foot. His discomfort is momentary, as John comes over and takes the gifts from his arms with an enchanted smile, dusting the snow from his flatmate’s curls and pressing his hand to the genius’s cool cheek.
“Yes, of course you, John! And I--” he takes a deep breath, actively removing the anger from his mind. “I don’t blame you for it. You were-- you were angry and grieving and you thought I had killed your wife and you were stopping me from killing someone else, so I don’t blame you.”
And John knows, if he leaves now Sherlock will never open up to him again, never trust him or look at him the same way ever again. And that is-- that is unacceptable in so many unspeakable ways, he’s dizzy with it.
John is taken back to Buckingham Palace and a beautiful marble man wearing a white sheet, the fabric slipping down his sculpted shoulder blades and stopping just short of what was sure to be a rounded bottom… The skin had been smooth then, smooth and unblemished except for a delightful smattering of pale freckles and stretch marks and a mole or two.
“I thought it was socially appropriate to be polite to people? Expected, even.  And almost all forms of communication involve making noises, so congratulations for that observation.” Sherlock’s agitation begins to infect his voice, screwing up the skin of his forehead like a cloth. “For years, all I hear is that I am arrogant and rude and a horrible person but as soon as I acknowledge this and start to change people ask me what’s wrong!” Sherlock struggles with the lid of the pickle jar, frustration making his grip slip.
The other shout came louder, once more, alarmed as he cried out the black-haired man's name. Hasty hands, smoggy and unclear, tore and pried and pulled Sherlock's arms from himself.
"Please, Sherlock, please tell me this is another magic trick? Tell me you've just got to go away for a little while without anyone bothering you? And then you'll come back when you're done, right? You'll come back to me?"
“Bullshit!” John snaps, and he has to take a few deep breaths before he’s calm enough to not yell. “You deserved none of what I did to you, and I ought to be crawling for your forgiveness right about two months ago.”
“Yes. Yes to whatever you were meaning to say. You, Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade would have been killed if I had failed to convincingly commit suicide. And that, before all other things, was the most unacceptable. I had planned to spend a few months at most dismantling Moriarty’s web, but it was much larger than I’d anticipated -- and, unfortunately, more dangerous. That’s where I got most of these scars. A knife wound from Ukraine. A broken hand in Brazil. They tried to scalp me in Crimea. Tried to bleach my fingers, once, in Canada. Cigarette burns, from everywhere. Whip lashes from Serbia. That was the last leg of operations I had to take down. There were others, but...”
John smiles again, and this time it’s purer, lighter. Sherlock may not have admitted to any sort of lasting romantic feelings, but he did sort of admit to a something and that was all he could ever ask for.
And when he finally sees what’s there beneath that shirt, the pain starts anew in a fresh, terrifying wave.
And John tries to hold it back, but after this incredibly torrential night he can’t stop the blindingly bright way his face smiles. He’s fucking beaming, so glad that Sherlock has finally, finally let him in, to stay. Maybe John had already been in Sherlock’s heart in some capacity, but whatever position he’d been in had caused the other man so much pain -- and now, John could rest comfortably, knowing that Sherlock knew he would never again do anything to hurt him. Not even if it meant losing his life. Sherlock had done everything humanly possible to protect Sherlock, and now it was John’s turn.
“Get out, John, and don’t try to text me. I’ll text you. Please, just go.” Sherlock points with and long, pale arm and his head tucked into his own chest, and his voice is as soft a plea as he’s ever heard.
Beneath the glare of his shiny tears, John's eyes pleaded with hope. Sherlock desperately wanted to allow him that, to let John live in a perpetual kind of possibility. To let John believe that he was coming back.
"You passed out about half a minute before the paramedics arrived. Should've seen me, too; I was acting like a chicken with a missing head. Anyways, after a little maneuvering, we all got you set up in the ambulance. They hooked you up and after awhile told me you were-- that you didn't---"
Books on wild, inexplicable sciences like agrostology (the study of grass) or oology (the study of eggs) would be appreciated, but perhaps a bit too tedious. Would Sherlock even read them? If he did, would he just delete them? John wanted to get him something really special for him this year, something he’d cherish.
The detective moves his head from where it’d been relaxed, cheek to the soft covers of the bed with his eyes closed trustingly, and turns to look over his shoulder at John. “Can you what?”
But out of all the gifts he’s collected over the months, he forgot about the most important person: Sherlock.
He smiles, a small thing, and tosses his hair away from the corners of his glasses. “Of course I do.”
“You seriously thought no one had picked up on you two? With all your eye-fucking and teenage drama? Please. I’ve been in on a pool for years now.”
The unemotional consulting detective (and there's only one of those) finally realized for himself a truth that had always shown on the surface where everyone but John and himself could see. Sherlock couldn't believe how long it had taken for him to deduce it.
As true as that still was, he barely deserved to be in the same room as Sherlock now, let alone be his best friend or anything more.
Suddenly all the tension drains out of his shoulders like an unspooling ball of thread. Sherlock drops back into his chair with trademark drama flaring up his curls and buries his face in his hands. They scrub across his cheeks and pull at his eyes, tangle the hairs of his eyebrows. “You’re exhausting.”
“Then why do you want me to go now?” Now, when he wants to, needs to stay more than he ever has before? Now, when he can feel his chest physically ache with the idea of being separated from this man?
“Then don’t ever let it come to that! Don’t you dare, put your hands on me like that, ever. Don’t you dare make me hurt you, ever! That’s the most selfish thing you’ve ever asked of me. I’ve died for you, three times, I’ve ran and leaped and killed and burned and cried for you, fuck, I even planned your fucking wedding, but I will not do that!”
Silence blankets the room, and John kisses every bit of Sherlock’s skin he can reach before rubbing the ointment into the kisses. “Does this feel alright?”
“How long is ‘quite some time’?” he asks, nuzzling his cheek into Sherlock’s shoulder and then dragging his lips along the curve of a shoulder blade.
Of all the possibilities John had considered when it came to Sherlock’s time away, somehow this had always escaped him. This idea that he had left for a reason, one that expanded further than his rift with Moriarty and the work and some misguided concept of adventure and heroism and individuality. He didn’t do any of that without regard for John; he did it for John.
John’s only just starting to understand the depth of these feelings and he can’t bear the thought of having already lost Sherlock’s heart to his own stupidity. Dear God, what if Sherlock found someone else and he had to help plan their wedding? Now he fully understands why Sherlock had added that to the list of painful things he’d done for John -- if he ever had to plan Sherlock’s wedding to another man, another person, he’d fucking wilt away like a weed that’s been doused with poison, it would hurt so much.
“Because what? Because you got scared? That’s the point of being vulnerable, Sherlock. The brave part comes when you let me stay and you talk to me.”
Sarah laughs at the same time she squints at him, seeing much farther into John than he wanted her to. “Yeah, I suppose you’re right. Guess we’ve all made a mess of it.”
John eyes him curiously, unsure if Sherlock is pulling his leg or really asking. The idea that he might not remember makes something inexplicable hurt inside his chest. “You know the answer to that, don’t you?”
And Sherlock's tongue swells up with his doubts, his fears, his objections. But when John leans down to kiss him, all of his misgivings are lovingly tucked away into the corners of his mouth, where they'll be brought up later when they're both less emotional and they've both been kissed silly and Sherlock can sit up in bed to more properly kiss John once he's been fully convinced that John is telling him the truth.
Sherlock smiles softly, confusion lingering in the corners of his face but fading fast. “I’ll let you believe whatever you want to, John.”
What a gruesome experience for his poor love to endure. John didn't deserve such trauma, after so much of the stuff already plaguing the rest of his life. It seemed to Sherlock all that he could do was bring sorrow and suffering to those he loved.
John. There was the distinct smell of his companion in the room, a hospital room by his estimation, as well as Mary's perfume. Mary was here; John, too. Why was Mary here too? Visiting her husband? Was John here being treated? He'd been safe... When he'd died, John had no wounds. He was fine. ...Was he no longer? Had something happened?
John may love him, and God knows that Sherlock loves John, but love is a pale motivator in the face of Sherlock's collection of demons and depressions and demands.
A scabbed voice, something's voice, someone's voice, sobbed as he firmly pressed the flailing, fighting Sherlock into his sheets, "Stop, Sherlock, please, you're going to hurt yourself. You need -- you need to stop, you're making it worse! Stop it, stop hurting yourself; I can't bear to see you in any more pain. Stop it, STOP IT RIGHT NOW."
As he watched Sherlock struggle with the burden of his thinly veiled care for him, John's eyes filled out with glass and his hands yet again reached for the other man's. "Oh, Sherlock. What are you on about? Both of us are alive! You haven't died, and neither have I."
The push he gives isn’t really that hard, but it’s enough to make Sherlock jolt out of his head with a terrible grunt. He didn’t used to do that, either. In the past he was always only ever annoyed that he’d been brought out before he was ready. But just then, he’d made a sound, a guttural thing that rang more like a hurt animal than an annoyed detective.
He already has presents for almost everyone: a delightful china teapot with rose etchings and a set of “subtle” cannabis-shaped earrings for Mrs Hudson, a football biography for Greg, a gag bow and arrow for Mike (strange request, but John has noticed a distinct increase of red hearts in the man’s home…), wayy too many toys for Rosie.
He looks back up at John with silver eyes, a sharpness to his squint that is only magnified through the glasses. “Do I know you?”
“You don’t need to thank me for my saying that you’re my best friend. You’ve earned that honesty and far more than that.”
“No, I mean -- are you alright? You’ve been so- polite recently, to me. And whenever we are around other people. And-- you’ve been making noises.”
“I don’t have to tell you anything! I’m obligated to my privacy, aren’t I? Just like the rest of the free world.”
Where does he even start? Now, on Christmas Eve, when all the shops are closed and mail delivery would scoff in your face if you so much as asked for a postage stamp?
By the time John has looked at it too long, taken in every little detail Sherlock has attentively laid into the shadowbox, he’s openly weeping and the detective is warily wrapping an arm around his shoulder at the same time as he picks up Rosie. She’s startled and a little upset by her father’s tears, but calms down as she’s enveloped by the two men who love her most in the world.
Within the recesses of his mind, he knew that John wasn't dead. But the sheer possibility of it was apparently enough here, in the afterlife (or on drugs -- perhaps he really was having an overdose and was having oversensitive reactions to his surroundings and emotions?).
His hands still stroked Sherlock's arms, and he smiled a little as he tenderly said, "Hello. Thanks for joining me -- you're a bit late and all...But better late than never, right...?" He laughed a little, nervous and with new scars in his voice.
The puppy has dark brown and curly fur with crystal blue eyes -- rather reminiscent of her new owner. She’s absolutely as sweet as can be, and John is already smitten. He can tell that Sherlock is, too.
Sherlock was confused. He'd fallen into the voices. He'd told John his secret; he'd drowned in his blood and pain --
There was an approximate nineteen percent chance of survival, and Sherlock could feel it slipping out of his hands. He had to say his piece now, or he would die trying.
His reassurances didn't stop himself from weeping with delirious grief -- not even long enough for him to collect his thoughts or his breath.
“I can hear you thinking, John,” the devil murmurs, looking softly into John’s eyes. “You think I’m too forgiving. That I’m a surprisingly good person. I can assure you, it’s really only something that happens around you. I am far less forgiving to others, and I do make an effort around you to be...better.”
“Sherlock, I’m sure I’ll love it. Especially coming from you. How could I not love anything to do with you?”
The genius ducks his head and squeezes John and Rosie a little closer. “I got most of it from your flat. Some of these things were left behind here at 221B. Others I simply..found. The pictures from your wedding I got from Lestrade, since the camera was impounded. I may have gotten some of it with the help of Mycroft…”
He glares at her, reluctant to let this go but needing some reassurance. “You know I’m not gonna let this go, right?”
She’s silent, now, thoughtful, as though holding John’s words in her head and judging their weight. “It’s Sherlock, isn’t it.”
“Can I...Can I kiss you?” He doesn’t lean towards his lips, carefully leaning back from his skin but still letting his fingers ghost soothingly over Sherlock’s hips.
His days at the clinic as of late have kept him busy, and his nights with Sherlock (sleuthing, as much as he wishes they were up late for other reasons) have kept him up, and through it all, he’s desperately lost track of the time, and now it’s suddenly, completely without warning, Christmas Eve.
"Shh," he cooed, desperate fright and pain still marring his speech. "I'm sorry for yelling. You just need to calm down, Sherlock. You just need to survive for me."
The detective looks up from the laptop to see John’s intrigued little smirk. Sherlock squirms a little, obviously a little embarrassed by the glasses but he’s not so proud or vain to try to hide them now that John has seen them. He pushes them farther up his nose and clears his throat lightly. “Thank you, John.”
Sherlock looks at him calculatingly, obviously trying to decide just how honest and revealing to be. He takes a shallow sip of his cooled tea and purses his lips before responding, “It was during my two years away. The scene at St. Bart’s had to be carefully orchestrated, if I were to emerge alive. The enacted plan was the same as the original, in most parts. You and the others were to think I had died so that I could go about my business without interruption. Again, I had no idea it would affect you so, my absence. But Moriarty threw in something at the last minute, something I had not anticipated.
"Despite what you may have erroneously believed, your death certificate was never issued, as proved by Dr Watson's unstinting research." He smiled wryly. "I do have some personal experience in social resurrection, and I offer my help in returning you to society."
Holmes regarded him with caution. “I do hope that you realise that you there are no secrets between the good doctor and myself. I have perfect and utter trust in him, and he in me.”
"Thank you for your time," he said as they left the dining room. "It has been most refreshing and reassuring to bring the presence of such youthful drive and intelligence."
Fosset took a breath before continuing. “Sherlock and I know each other through the trials and tribulations better known as surviving the English public school, although we have not seen each other for over twenty years. I had to leave without notice when my father’s business affairs declined in such a way that I was unable to continue my education. After he died at his own hand, my mother remarried and i found myself with a stepfather willing to extend the protection of his name and fortune to myself and my younger sister, which went some way to alleviate the public shame of being the son of a bankrupt suicide. This involved the completion of my studies at another (if slightly less prestigious school than Harrow) and then on to Oxford. He was a good-hearted man who in particular treated my mother with great kindness. His generosity was also extended to my sister, who was similarly enabled to complete her education, albeit one which ended at the schoolroom door rather than the lecture hall. His only stipulation was that all traces and connections to our previous life and of my father were swept away and never mentioned again.
The aftermath of the Felderson case, which resulted in the absolute pardon of Miss O'Bryan, was not entirely without its problems. Felderson had put up a significant fight once he realised that his demise was imminent. He was ultimately the worse for such an action, but not before he had done his damnedest to add Holmes to his death toll.
"Although she gives the distinct impression of having lived a very different life before her marriage."
Holmes grabbed his shoulder. "No. Remember what I said last night. If we step in, they will only wait so we have gone to attack once more, perhaps with even greater force." He turned so that he had caught the entirety of Watson's attention. "Bullies only back down when their force is pushed back against them. I know the standing back goes against every ounce of your soul, but this is not our fight alone."
Their train approached Barnet. Fosset remained fixed in his seat. “Come on, Victor,” Holmes offered his hand. “Take me to the Vicarage, and allow me to find a solution amongst these tangled ends.”
Watson’s temporary abandonment of Holmes allowed him the opportunity to prepare 221b for Holmes’ return. He disposed of the rotting experiments cluttering the workbench while Mrs Hudson changed the bedlinens and laid out fresh towels. She was grateful for his help, but recognised his need for fresh air, and sent him on an errand.
Watson calmed a little. "I wouldn't have returned to live in this house if I was, but I fear for your reputation. The world is an increasingly cruel place, especially after the Wilde case."
Holmes guided him into the church via the side door and pulled him down into a pew. “Keep your eyes on the far wall, just beneath the middle window.”
"Come in." The door opened to reveal Dr McLelland. "May ask you whether you have had any thoughts to share with me?"
Watson remained outwardly stoic, even though his sympathy was clear. “You will return to Baker Street when and only when physicians other than myself deem you fit to leave.” His smile had a regretful tinge. “I am of the opinion that perhaps you will be discharged to my sole care in the very near future, providing that all the conditions of such a release are met.” He leaned in closer to Holmes, as it to inspect the bruising on his skull. His lips were perhaps an inch from Holmes’ ear. “To lose you now would fracture me.”
Holmes cast a quick glance towards Watson, who threw it straight back at him. “My leg is quite fine, Sir Worry Wort.” He turned to Dr McLelland, who was trying to school her amusement.”War wound, which occasionally bothers me from time to time..”
The angle of the mantle mirror allowed Watson the first clues as to their mysterious visitor.A ladies’ cape and hat had found a temporary  registry on the coat stand.  A tall woman of slenderly muscled build, soberly but stylishly dressed in an outfit of charcoal grey, sat at the dining table, where coffee and toast was set for three. Holmes caught his gaze and his eyes lit up.
It did appear that those reading the sciences  were the ones coming under the most pressure; of all of the  academic disciplines, the sciences seemed to be the most securely guarded by the arrogant and ill-informed. He had not had the opportunity to speak to those students due to the timing of their lectures, but Dr McLelland assured them that they would return for Evensong in the college chapel.
Watson came down the stairs, a bag in each hand. He put them down the Holmes's feet, then held out his hand Dr McLelland took it gratefully.
“Leave your things here. “He unfolded a large sheet of brown paper on the floor. “I will dispose of them for you. Run a bath and make whatever use you require of the facilities. The water is hot and almost unlimited. Everything you might require is here. Dr Watson is also on hand if you require his services.”
"And you will succeed." He brought his  hands together "A plan is forming in my mind. I believe by this time tomorrow this whole situation will have been resolved."
The return to Baker Street was an uneventful one, taken in an a cab driven by Wiggins. They stopped once, at a modest gentleman’s outfitters off New Oxford Street. Mrs Hudson chose to ignore their arrival. Holmes ushered their guest upstairs and into their bathroom.
"Slowly my memory returned," Lovellan continued. "But when I reached my former lodgings, I found them locked and empty. I stumbled into the church, more dead than alive. My eyes fell on the plaque erected by the parish, and I wished that I had never returned, and that the waves had claimed me. I slunk into the shadows, exhausted and broken. Then I saw Amelia and the extent of her grief, and the guilt ripped me apart. She was perhaps twenty yards away from me, but in my current state it might have been a distance of a thousand miles. I was reduced to nothing- just a homeless wretch who had lost all that he had once valued."
She nodded, without taking up eyes off the arrivals. "I prefer to be a  visible presence when they return, the better to beware of any unpleasantness that might have followed them on the way back."
Fosset nodded. “You remain the cleverest soul I have ever had the opportunity to encounter, and I am sure that you will be able to unearth the truth behind this sorry tale. For once my faith is of little use; I need your rational viewpoint so that I can ensure my sister has the greatest opportunity to recover herself as far as she is able.”
Holmes waited until the railway carriage was empty before he spoke. “You have failed to tell all that you know, Victor.” Fosset looked up at the use of his Christian name. “Remember I know you of old, and can spot omission as quickly as fabrication.”
Watson turned his head to hide his grin, pretending to strengthen the pillows on the chaise. He waited until he heard the latch click behind her before  his arms encircled Holmes. He leant into Watson’s shoulder with a sigh as his lips found a home on his cheek.
"Whatever your past actions, understand that your secret is locked inside me and it will not be permitted to escape."
As expected, St Barts relinquished its bodily hold on Holmes later that afternoon, albeit on the strictest of conditions, focusing on the fact that he strayed not further than the confines of his rooms for at least the next day, extending to the possibility of sedate walks after that.
“Sir, Sir, are you quite alright? I did not mean to startle you, but that seemed a close call.” Watson spun around. A handsome man, perhaps just touching forty, stared down at him by the advantage of two of three inches. He was dressed in unremitting black, save for the band of clerical purity at his neck.
Watson watched as Holmes put a guiding hand on the man's arm. "Come now. You are Lazarus, and not the prodigal son. There are two people in there who are desperate to reclaim your acquaintance. They have waited long enough." His eyes glowed with encouragement. "I know how terrifying it is to return as if from the dead, but love and genuine regard will always find the means to override any obstacle if hope allows them to grow."
Holmes raised the edge of his pyjama jacket. "See? No disturbance to the wound. Now settle yourself." He pushed Watson onto the softest section of the mattress and fitted himself comfortably behind. "Mrs Hudson won't be in to disturb us with breakfast before nine. Now sleep."
“There is a genuine concern that the grief of losing the future for which she so longed with Lovellan has stolen her rationality and that there is very little that can be done beyond her removal to a more suitable therapeutic environment.” He swallowed as if to make the idea more palatable. “She was the brightest light in my life before this tragedy unfolded, and while it rips at my heart to see her so changed and in so much distress, I am increasingly convinced that the current situation cannot continue.”
Of all the cases they took on that year, Watson's mind kept wandering back to the wretch they had found huddled next to the desecrated plaque, and the resulting resurrection of a decent man. His notes were never formally written up into the casebook. In such a place, only two clippings remained, both from the Barnet and Whetstone Chronicle. The record of a quiet family wedding in early May, followed by the christening of William Hamish Lovellan in December, just before the year turned.
"Your sympathy is both notable and admirable. I have sent a message to Whetstone, and they will be expecting us between about eleven and noon."
Fosset’s relief was palpable. “I cannot express sufficient thanks for your engagement in this matter. Grief is a monster which has the ability to destroy the most balanced of souls. I have to believe there are other avenues to be explored before I am forced to entrust my dear Amelia to the care of others, no matter how caring and professional.”
Hoolmes acknowledged his admission, before his expression shifted a little. “But what of the connection which your sister shared with Lovellan? Your description of the grief which continues to threaten her seems to have struck much deeper than anyone could have expected.”
His life hung in this peculiar balance for five days. Watson refused to leave him during this time, other than to collect items from their rooms at Baker Street and to keep a fretting Mrs Hudson informed of the changing circumstances. He dozed in a purloined chair by the bedside and endeared himself to the nursing staff by attending to as much of Holmes' care as he could, thus lessening their load by one.
Later, once Miss Fosset had recovered herself, they gathered in the modest parlour whilst Lovellan recounted the tale of his misfortune and return. The train which had crashed into the sea after the track was pulverised by a vicious spring storm. Being washed up on a beach further up the coast, lacking everything but the clothes on his back and a few coins in his pocket. His mind feeling as blank as though it had been washed by the waves. The label in his coat which suggested a London origin. How his journey began, funded by begging and the charity found in churches along the way.
“It was not your fault.” Holmes‘ voice seemed to temper the man’s fear and self loathing. “Assumptions were made without appropriate evidence. Now come with us and all will be solved. There’s a warm bath, a clean bed, good food and new clothes waiting for you if you come with us now.
Watson began snuffling in  his sleep. Holmes aches to slip into the next room and fit himself against his body, but held back, far too aware of the dangers of discovery, even in such an apparent haven as the College. Discretion was their greatest defence. There would be time enough for  open affection when they returned  to  Baker Street.
Holmes’ hands travelled down his ribs and and in his waistcoat pocket. He encountered the neat card and liberated it from its silken lair. “And what is this?” he asked, waving it in front of Watson’s face.
The college was buzzing with the returning students. Dr McLelland took on the air of a  commanding officer counting her forces back as he returned from a sortie. "All well?" asked Holmes in an undertone.
A smile danced acrossHolmes's face. "But of  course. May I speak to the whole community of the chapel before the chaperones depart. I promise I will not keep long."
"Down you go, dear heart." Watson allowed himself to be toppled onto the nearest of the twin beds. Holmes gently relieved him of his shoes, and draped the quilt over him. He pressed a  kiss to his brow then settled into the attached sitting room. His mind span with possible scenarios and their likely outcomes. He knew that it was only happenstance that prevented the harassment of the Radegund students and staff degenerating into lasting harm. Action would have to be taken soon, possibly within the day.
“Amelia was throwing herself against the window casement as if intending to burst through it. It took almost all my strength to enfold her safely in my arms and guide her to her bed. Her eyes remained fixed and unseeing, and she kept repeating “He did not die, he is not dead, why does he not come?” over and over. This did not cease until a doctor was summoned to sedate her.”
"At this point, nothing. There are many members of your sex who have had to take radical turns from their expected paths in order to endure and thrive amongst cruelties of our society. I believe that Mrs Holtz may well be one of them."
“How I forget myself,” he exclaimed. “Please sit down,” gesturing to Fosset. ”I understand that you met Dr Watson yesterday in my absence.”
Watson returned the kiss. “By taking me out of that Strand hovel and repurposing me for your own ends. That remains reward enough for me.”
He moved the dressing gown aside and Watson saw how the jagged welts on his leg looked as though it had been attacked by an unseen monster. There was more evidence of healing than putrefaction, but when Watson gently palpated the area, his fingers encountered evidence of an unwelcome heat.
“I will accompany you to Whetstone while Dr Watson completes some research here,” announced Holmes. “If you could excuse us for a moment?” Fosset nodded mutely as they went into the hallway.
“I am doubtful that he will be able to.“ He looked at the mug of soup from Watson. “It would have been better for all if you had not found me. I am not deserving of such support.”
He laid his hands flat on John’s back – the same proprietary, sensual touch that John has already experienced in the club.
That would teach him to be nice to bloody weirdos, he thinks. “What a cheek!” he muttered to the empty room. He has barely put the phone down that it gave out a flurry of sounds.
He looked up at his flat’s ceiling, as if, by some kind of miracle, some divine inspiration could come to him.
She gently attempted to extricate herself from Sherlock’s embrace. An attempt which was completely foiled with her friend’s persistence in clinging to her. Joan shivered when she felt through the thin fabric of her T-shirt Sherlock’s nails grazing her skin.
The rest was lost in his throat when the train moved off again with a rush. John found himself being jostled directly towards Sherlock. He caught hold of the backrest just in time to stop himself from colliding with his friend.
It burst forth from her mouth before Irene could think of it. She felt herself flushing while Molly stared at her wide-eyed.
“I remember Mycroft offering me once a book describing every achievement of his for my seventh birthday,” Sherlock added. “One of the best gifts I’ve ever received.”
All their hopes, their pet peeves, what they wanted (or not) to find in a life or one-night partner… and nothing has aroused her suspicion.
“I can’t wait any longer,” he growled, nuzzling Sherlock’s pale neck where a hickey of respectable size was already showing. “I had to have you.”
He looked everywhere, combing through every paper, emptying the wastebasket even if he knew he didn’t get rid of it that way.
He would never forget his life with Sherlock, but maybe, as time went by, he could let it fade into the background.
Such a beautiful sight, he mused, as Sherlock’s gaze widened, looking back and forth between John’s face and the box.
“You’ve never heard of… No, never mind, don’t answer that”, John replied with a little smile before launching into a short explanation of the bestselling novel’s plot.
They were curious, but they weren’t nosey, trying to pry into his personal life. No one asked him if he was married or if he would like to have children. No one tried to win him over at all costs to join the volunteer team. When he left the tea hut, as they called the premises intended for informal meetings, where the kettle always seemed to be put on, John felt comfortable, genially replying to the cheery round of “Goodbye!” and “See you soon”.
There was too much for Joan – she reached out, drawing Sherlock close to her, hugging her with all her might and to hell with boundaries and personal space. Besides, Sherlock’s embrace turned out to be as fierce as her own. As if now that she had Joan in her arms, she wouldn’t ever let her go.
He was brought back to reality by John’s worried voice, allowing himself the pleasure to gaze down at this man. Sherlock always had a fondness for blue eyes and combined with his nice, regular features, it was no wonder he has been drawn to him.
“You better pray being put under lock and key. Otherwise, I’ll find you and make you regret ever thinking of assaulting women.”
“No one has asked for your opinion, Gerald,” Sherlock has cut him off. “Now are we free to go or do you really want to spend your Friday evening with us?”
“Is that so, my dear?” Mrs Dubusson cooed to the child, who was piteously sniffing. “Don’t worry, little one, Mummy’ll come up very soon.” She then planted a kiss on her wife’s cheek.
He let out a great guffaw, which was readily followed by others. Several passers-by turned round to stare at him, but for once John didn’t really care. His amusement was intensified when he caught Sherlock repressing a smile, concealing his face in the collar of his coat.
Sherlock felt his heart lurch in his chest. Were they talking about him? He racked his brains, trying to pinpoint exactly what might have been construed as offensive behaviour. Offensive enough for John to call him like that. And it hurt, especially after what they’ve almost shared in this very room, but who else… ?
voice pouring out comforting words, the only lifeline in the dark to which John hangs on with all his strength – “I’ve got you, John, I’ve got you and I won’t let you go. Not this time. I’m here, John. I’m here for you.”
Goading him into replying and doing so, entering the mysterious little game SH was trying to establish between them.
John found himself disrobed in a handful of seconds, Sherlock throwing his shirt off the bed before lowering himself onto John, holding up his weight on his hands. John didn’t waste time, draping his arms around Sherlock’s neck, pulling him down, moaning when he felt the first skin-on-skin contact.
No, Sherlock would stay as she always was in front of a potential client – aloof and attentive at the same time, her green gaze unwaveringly fixed on the man in front of her.
It was completely different than when he was playing his beloved violin. During his youth, he always considered music a harsh mistress – not one who tolerated his beginner’s mistake with a lenient smile.
The flirty grins sent his way received nothing more than a polite “Thanks but no thanks” smile in return.
They stood there, simply looking at each other, their breaths slowly mingling until Sherlock’s hushed voice broke the silence.
What was the meaning of all this? Was John relaxing a little bit his obstinate “Not gay!” stance because they were abroad and thus not likely to be spotted by one of their Londonian acquaintances? It must be it.
“First, gentlemen, thank you for coming so swiftly here,” she said, pouring each of them a glass of wine – because apparently you couldn’t visit the Loire valley without tasting the regional products. Sherlock has only shrugged when she has offered, ignoring the fondly exasperated gaze John directed at him.
Sherlock was always taking for granted the fact that John would stay with him no matter what. It was high time that John disabused him of this notion.
Shoving him against the ground one last time, John stood up under the befuddled stare of the Yarders. He had only eyes for Sherlock, who, judging from his discreet smirk, has heard – or deduced – what he has just said to his prisoner.
She smothered a grin behind her list. Looking at people hitting on Sherlock who, for all his earlier experience, didn’t know how to deal with amorous advances, especially when he would like to reciprocate them, never ceased to be funny.
For sole answer, John moved his hips in a slow, sensuous roll. He let out a loud groan when he felt the hard, rigid line of Sherlock’s cock, still imprisoned in his impeccably ironed trousers, against the small of his back.
“Sherlock!” he called in vain. The man didn’t even hesitate, going on his way upstairs, certainly intending to disappear once he was in the street.
Good old Greg, always ready for a visit at his favourite pub – as well as trying to nudge John back into the dating game, hoping without a doubt to live vicariously through him, since he and his latest girlfriend were back together.
He couldn’t decide, torn between the delicious hand on his cock, stroking the underside vein, teasing his balls and the increasing pressure on his anus.
He didn’t expect this. A community garden? His landlady rolled her eyes, as if he was a pupil being deliberately obtuse.
He drew back just enough to lick John’s slick, swollen lips with teasing touches. He leaned in a bit more, nipping the soft skin of his neck, smothering a groan when John moaned and tilted his head up to leave him better access.
At the same time, Sherlock’s free hand resumed his exploration of John’s chest, which has barely started in the cab. This time, there wasn’t any need of caution or restraint. He was boldly touching John, pinching his nipples, caressing his sides, before dropping on his waistband.
John could practically hear “I thought we were friends!” in a whining voice. He tried not to show his amusement.
Unable to endure any longer the silence between them, Sherlock opened his mouth but, as if he had read his mind, John beat him to it.
Mycroft didn’t trust him. He didn’t consider Sherlock strong enough to stay clean. A belief which incensed him and undermined him at the same time. True, he hasn’t been the model child his mother hoped he will be, but everyone made mistakes, after all.
Checkmate. He couldn’t think of anything to reply. Without any doubt because Sherlock was right. Out of the corner of his eye he noticed Martha and Harold toning it down their bickering and glancing at them curiously.
Fortunately Sherlock has been there, dashing after their man. Molly has helped her standing up before taking care of the young woman, who was already suffering from the first effects of the drug.
Startled, John turned around. Dave, who has jumped at the chance at retiring early after thirty-five years spent working for the British railway, as he has explained to John at length weeks ago, kindly smiled at him before limping closer to him.
Poshy was already walking past Ross, obviously considering the matter settled once and for all, when the owner suddenly put his big, rough-looking hand on the handle of the umbrella the other was carrying with him. John nearly laughed when he saw Poshy’s absolutely dismayed look at what he surely considered as an unforgivable crime.
on the other side of the Loire river, standing tall and proud above the water and lit up with all kinds of Christmassy ornaments.
He stared at his pint of mead – Ross’ brand new product, as advertised on the chalk board. “A fresh intriguing taste to celebrate the spring!”, the bartender has added. John wasn’t really in the mood to drink to the weather warming up again, but he hasn’t protested when Ross has offered.
Sitting in his armchair in front of the fire, John knew he couldn’t go on like this. He was already becoming mad, nearly drowning in his bloody bath because he couldn’t stop dreaming, couldn’t stop living in the past.
He could do this. He was a survivor – he has proven it to himself enough times to know it to be true.
“Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock went on, punctuating each word with a delicate kiss on every part of John’s face he could reach. “65 years old. Baker extraordinaire, Aston Martin driver and like a second mother to me.”
was an incident by the way, unlike what Mrs Hudson assumed. But she didn’t believe me and she even obliged me to go to the hairdresser…”
– that, in his situation, any other guy – or woman for that matter – would have reacted differently. They wouldn’t have followed Sherlock, they wouldn’t even have set foot inside the building. They would have recoiled in front of this madman covered in blood, hiding their feelings with more or less discretion before fleeing, blocking his number afterwards on their phone and forgetting this whole disaster of a date.
To disguise his lack of composure, he pretended to rummage in his pockets for a tissue. He didn’t know if Hussein was fooled by this, but he didn’t make any remark about it, patiently waiting for John before resuming the visit. John was pathetically grateful to him for it.
Truth was, he has forgotten that anyone could see him as someone to be relied upon. Especially after the incident with Nurse Idiot, three weeks ago.
A fierce blush bloomed across John’s cheeks. To think that until today, he has never been interested in public sex. And now he has almost been caught red-handed.
“But it would a be shame,” Sherlock went on, punctuating each word with a nip of his teeth and a soothing kiss afterwards, “not to hear whatever dreams you might have about me…”
She became aware she was staring at Sherlock’s plump mouth and managed to look away, swallowing heavily.
The question startled Holmes out of his thoughts and he looked mildly affronted for a moment, before remembering his manners and presented a more reasonable version of himself. “As you wish,” he replied, with an odd light in his eye. “Some topics are better discussed between professionals.” He swept out, ensuring that the door closed with an audible click.
Watson held out his hand. ”I am a doctor. I will see to it that you receive the assistance you require, but you cannot stay here and continue as you are now. We have the means and the will to set your world back on its axis.”
Watson busied himself with repacking his medical kit. "Rational to an extent, but bewildered as to how or why he should accept our assistance. He should recover from his physical injuries, but his nerves are quite another matter. He harbours great uncertainties about what the future might hold, and if I were in his shoes, I would be in a similar frame of mind."
"Middlemiss, Blondel, Howlett, and Horgan. All Trinity men, all fervently opposed  to the advancement of women students, especially those whose intelligence far outstripped their own. . The college has rescinded their membership and will fully support whatever civil prosecutions arise."
Watson sighed. "I will take your unfounded doubts as nothing more than the wanderings of an exhausted soul, and nothing more."
“Amelia fell into a mute panic from which she could not be reduced. I made desperate enquiries on her behalf, only to discover that our beloved Lovellan had been on that train, much to the distress of those who loved him. A memorial service was held once it was confirmed that there could be no hope for his return, in place of the much looked-for wedding. Amelia withdrew even further into herself, almost never leaving her room or even her bed. She grew increasingly pale and listless, and I truly feared that I would lose her.” The room hummed with an unspoken sympathy.
9 a.m. – that’s tomorrow morning by the way – whatever is contained in the box will be automatically destroyed.”
John didn’t let the great prat finish. He took Sherlock’s large hands between his own – a simple gesture which was enough to silence his friend though – and looked up directly at him. Sherlock was frowning, having already overcome his surprise at John’s reaction.
Lestrade didn’t get the opportunity to reply. With a final venomous look, Sally removed her bulletproof vest before turning on her heel and striding away to join the rest of the team, gathered around the van where the “Copper Killer” was currently locked in.
Did they watch him crumble in front of Sherlock’s grave? Did they witness his moments of quiet despair, when he couldn’t find any motivation to carry on with his life, relying instead on the force of habit and the support of his few friends?
Unfortunately, apart from the exciting opening of the box, the rest of the investigation didn’t turn out to be successful. The smaller case which has been hidden inside contained nothing but ashy powder and Mrs Dubusson wisely decided to send it to a private lab first rather than examining themselves. There was just no way to know if what Serge has sent to her revealed itself to be a threat to her and her family or if it was included in a prank intended to hurt her in her expertise about Da Vinci and her self-esteem.
What has motivated him to break in John Watson’s flat has been the certainty that Sherlock, if he were still alive, would be unable to leave his only friend alone. During the years they have lived together at Baker Street, Mycroft had many opportunities to observe the dynamics between these two.
“That’s… good. Fine. I’m…happy for him,” he blurted out, his daring deflating now that he knew Mister Curls was “doing fine on his own”.
Pouring all the love which has been hidden until today in every gesture, every whisper, every whimper.
He knew this display was only for the benefit of Mister Curls – or whatever his name was – but it didn’t stop John from getting even more annoyed.
It slowly got better. Eyes shining a little bit brighter, laughter echoing louder within the walls. Lestrade calling you, Mycroft meddling as always and Hudders watching both of you with a familiar twinkle in her eyes.
Sherlock didn’t seem to have got this specific memo though – when she felt Joan drawing a little away, she held her tighter and opening her mouth, licked the seam of Joan’s lips. At the same time, her hands dropped lower until reaching Joan’s plush bottom and cupping it in her large palms.
It didn’t mean it was easy to resist the temptation to lean in and to take what Sherlock seems to offer so freely to him. With the vivid flush spreading across his cheekbones, his eyes darkened with want and this lush mouth whose softness John still could feel against his skin, he looked like the very picture of desire, ready to be kissed and debauched. He swallowed hard before whispering in a rough voice.
He awkwardly patted her knee – any kind of physical contact has recently become quite unbearable to him – and said “Your sister comes tonight, does she? And in the meantime, you can rely on Mrs Turner next door…”
At the time he first asked for her help, she didn’t think of the price she would have to pay afterwards. Silly of her, really, but all she saw was the fact that for once, he hasn’t asked first John, Lestrade or even Mrs Hudson. No – he has turned to her.
“After all the girlfriends you have brought round to our flat, trying to demonstrate in a very obvious way the heterosexuality you never had…”
“Ladies and gentlemen, the second round of our great Dating Game is about to begin! Please take your seats…”
Kissing that mouth, tasting him like a fine wine before forgetting his last traces of restraint and devouring him.
Once again, Mycroft’s cheeks became tinged with red. A sight which sent Greg’s mind into the gutter, this time.
Fortunately, the street was well-lit as well as quite deserted – the ideal conditions for catching their suspect. The man has no chance to shake them off. As they were steadily gaining ground on him, John sensed the victory was near. And when his target intuitively slowed down as he ran into a busier road, John decided to take a chance. He put on a burst of speed, jumped on the suspect’s back and tackled him to the ground.
He got back on his feet, trying to ignore – with mixed results – his landlady who was currently wearing a pout worthy of a sulky four-year-old. He could sympathize with her – as far as he was able to feel something these days.
For all their bickering and their attempts at outdoing the other, the two of them were thick as thieves, almost living in each other’s pocket. Back when they all were at university, you couldn’t see one without catching sight of the other.
The light, on the year’s last day, was shyly rising, casting a grey hue on Mycroft’s tired face. He delicately rubbed his eyes with his forefinger, wondering for the hundredth time why he has remained here, slumped back in this completely uncomfortable sofa while a perfectly appropriate bed was waiting for him in his flat.
He wanted to devour Sherlock. Devouring him whole, feeling his naked skin against his, hearing him moan, scream and beg, contemplating his lithe body glistening with sweat and spunk –
Heart jumping into triple time at this idea, he emptied his cup of tea in one gulp before rushing into the bathroom.
“You know,” he said, standing up again, his voice sounding quite nonchalant to his ears, “only three brands are currently marketing this type of safe. Two of them are American and as far as I know, they didn’t put any logo or whatsoever on their products…”
“Hurry up,” John growled. He couldn’t stop himself from rolling his hips and gasped when he felt Sherlock’s hands stroking the bare skin of his legs.
He could already feel the aching muscles getting warm and relaxed again. He lazily stretched out his arm to grasp the glass of red wine waiting for him on the nearest shelf. The slightly bitter tang of alcohol on his tongue, mixed with an unexpected fruity sweetness, reminded him of his first night at Angelo’s, when…
Tongue dancing against Sherlock’s, exploring the sweetness of this mouth he has so often dreamed of, teeth pulling delicately Sherlock’s lower lip, John tried to pour in this kiss everything he has ever felt for the crazy guy he was holding so strongly in his arms.
She turned round, removing her coat before hanging it on the peg. She was moving slowly, with none of her usual grace or energy. Joan stared at her, bile rising in her throat, an anguished knot forming in her chest. She swallowed several times before asking
Hearing this, she felt a new surge of anger but she brought it down enough to reply “I will carry on holding my tongue.”
“I know,” Greg whispered, his gaze focused on Mycroft. “I didn’t forget. Nor have I forgotten what I’ve offered you then.”
The truth was – he was becoming truly tempted to reply to those texts. He has succeeded in ignoring the first ones - “[Didn’t know this experiment could result in this] with a pic so gruesome it has nearly turned John off his dinner – but now it just seemed rude not to answer.
It was a clear night and John enjoyed it, walking back to 221b after having said goodbye to Greg. However, what the DI has confided it in his care made him feel ill at ease. To his shame he found himself jumping at shadows, his imagination playing havoc with his nerves. He berated himself for being so easily freaked out – it didn’t bode well for the nightmares which still haunted him at night. Nevertheless he gave a sigh of relief when he closed behind him his flat’s door. His gaze immediately focused on the wooden car he has found in the mailbox and left on the coffee table after Mrs Hudson’s departure.
Who knew that this unusual mix was enough to make him want to fall down on his knees and offer comfort and affection to the one man who boldly professed he didn’t need it and – even worse – despised it entirely?
When they finally stopped, faces red and tears in their eyes, chortling over the last traces of their mirth, John has never felt so light.
Sherlock kept one of John’s hands in his, refusing to let it go, and was rewarded with a bright smile. It felt wonderful to finally be allowed all these little gestures, displays of affection he wasn’t even aware he has longed to do.
“Brilliant,” he whispered before dashing to the tea hut, where he knew a plan of the whole garden was pinned up on the wall.
Was it so far-fetched to imagine they would also take this opportunity to settle some old scores left as a legacy by their former boss? That they would find a way to silence definitely the last witness of the deadly battle between Sherlock and Moriarty? John wouldn’t be there to tell the tale of Sherlock’s last stroke of brilliance, resulting in the suicide of his enemy on St Bart’s roof.
Sherlock draping himself over him with a proprietary air, his nimble fingers exploring the valleys and ridges of his body, finding the space where John’s shirt has ridden up. His fingertips grazed the bare, sweaty skin of John’s back.
Then the intruder took flight. John swore and ran after him. He didn’t bother to call out to him, he knew it was pointless. He focused instead on gaining speed, gradually reducing the distance between him and his target until he could pounce on him.
Of course, the day after, Sherlock has loudly denied having ever accepted such a ludicrous offer. Unfortunately for him – and John – Greg has thought of everything.
John frowned. He supposed Mycroft could have pulled this trick on him… but why? After Sherlock’s death, he hasn’t heard of Mycroft anymore and anyway this kind of cryptic message – if it was really one – wasn’t like him.
Her hand on the door’s handle, she remained motionless, eyes closed. Fighting the urge to rush into their flat and to kick the intruder between his legs until his balls were nothing else than a mere souvenir.
Someone slapped him hard on his shoulder and John gritted his teeth, hiding his displeasure at this gesture behind a friendly grin – Paul, this bastard, didn’t really know his strength!
Despite her being breathless, she laughed. A hysterical sound, which was hurting her even though she couldn’t resist its lure.
Instead of being reassured, Molly looked away, a worried frown still on her face. It wouldn’t do at all, Irene thought. She caught Molly’s hand in hers, ignoring the thrill running through her veins at this touch.
“Thank you, Angelo, that’ll be all,” Sherlock said before whispering, as if he was telling a great secret, “It was delicious.”
As always, meeting this clear gaze, much too knowing for his own taste made John’s insides twist and flip in a now very familiar dance. He tried to hide it behind a little smile.
Sherlock’s jealousy reared its ugly head when he glimpsed the smile John typically kept for the women he found attractive blooming on his lips. He fought the impulse to look away and he was rewarded for this effort when the woman, who has introduced herself as Mrs Sylvie Dubusson, only gave a polite nod in answer to John’s greeting.
Sherlock gritted his teeth, barely refraining from pointing out – in an extremely acerbic voice – how this statement hasn’t turned out to be true. Lestrade, always the peacemaker, shot him a glance, no doubt begging him mentally to shut up for once, before turning to his colleague.
Without a care for Sherlock’s personal space, her companion came between them both, his hand outstretched.
Despite his annoyance, John couldn’t stop himself from snorting. Nutty AND impatient. This SH was strongly reminding him of bratty new recruits, when they have just arrived in the barracks, excitement and thirst for action boiling up in their veins until they were sent on the field. A familiar sadness welled up within him, but John managed to chase it off. He wasn’t old enough to turn into a sentimental codger, after all.
John doesn’t let him finish. He turns round, straddling his friend – his lover, his mind whispers – and finally gives free rein to every one of his instincts regarding Sherlock.
Before he could think about it though, he heard soft footsteps getting closer to him. It was way too early to believe it was one of the volunteers. His heartbeat quickened, he crouched down, ready to spring out of his hideout and pounce on his prey. Finally, his wait was over!
Sherlock kissed him. Mouth warm and pliant against his, lips tasting, a hint of a tongue before letting him go.
The sharp thrill of the office phone cut her off and Mycroft couldn’t help groaning as Anthea answered with a swift “Yes?”
officials or briefing Lestrade. Molly has contributed when needed. She has kept an eye on the young woman until the emergency services have finally appeared.
“Exactly what it means, Sir,” she slowly said, her tone making John gritting his teeth. “We only have one room left.” (She shrugged, glancing back at the computer screen.) “You’re lucky, as we’re usually full at this moment, as the end of the year festivities are in full swing…”
It was the straw which broke through the last of his defences. Before he could think about it, he heard himself growling
John didn’t even try to repress the long shiver running through him. He had nothing more to hide after all. He has totally surrendered himself to Sherlock’s touch.
Sherlock shrugged, a nonchalant attitude which was immediately contradicted by the rosy hint on his cheekbones.
“Calm down, Greg, I promise it’s nothing of this kind,” John cut him off, rolling his eyes while at the same time he couldn’t stop the amused grin blooming on his lips. He supposed Greg has a point, though, considering his common past with Sherlock.
A shrill sound echoed suddenly in the room. Sherlock felt John’s sharp intake of breath by his side, but didn’t dare looking at him.
The combination of pale eyes, narrowed at this moment in a piercing and calculating gaze, dark hair cut very short, which emphasizes even more Sherlock’s angular face, full lips pursed in a defensive frown shouldn’t really work, but somehow it did.
The man who emerged from the bathroom in Holmes’ least-favoured dressing gown bore little resemblance to the beggar they had transported from Whetstone. The restorative heat of the bath had straightened his back and uncrabbed his hands. His hair and beard were and soft, albeit lacking in a certain level of tidiness.
“Lovellan undertook to a journey to Devon to visit an old friend about a month before the wedding. Amelia saw him off at the station, expecting that the separation would only be for at most a week. But he never came back.” He took a long draught of his coffee before continuing. “The day he was due to return was full of storms in the south west, to the point that the railway line near Dawlish was ripped apart by the elements.
Holmes smiled at the memory. "Once happily, once less so, but all concerned continue to live and thrive, which is better than living in the shadow of unremitting regret."
"She has had a far wider education than the average clergy wife – indeed, it would not surprise me to discover that she came from  minor gentry or similar. Not to the bad, I must reassure you, for she is quite devoted in her role and is amongst friends here – but she carries a sense of mystery about her, perhaps to do with her widowing, which apparently occurred just over two years ago."
“It was given to me by a quick-thinking clergyman, whose actions saved me from a runaway cart earlier today. He claims to have a case for you.”
Fosset frowned. “But if this was a suspicion, then why did the doctor who was called say nothing of this? I know that he was most thorough in his questioning of her.”
Watson turned to Holmes, who was staring out of the sitting room window. “Holmes, could you leave us for a few moments so that I can conduct a consultation? “
"An intriguing answer, ma'am. Our paths have crossed before, perhaps a little more than two years ago?"
The detective scoffs and hooks his coat and scarf by the door. John swallows deeply. As always, the man is dressed impeccably. Somehow his outfit is festive even as it remains antithetical to the holiday pajamas John and Rosie are dressed in. The slacks are perfectly form fitting so as to show off his perfectly rounded bottom. A wonderful Christmas present, John swoons.
((And in his heart, maybe even something more than that -- which honestly only made his actions against the other man ten times more despicable.))
“I don’t deserve your pity either,” he murmurs so softly that John can’t actually hear it without piecing together the scattered syllables.
But then Sherlock bursts through the door. His hair is dusted with snow and there is a lovely red blush high on his cheeks. The Belstaff hangs dishevelled off his shoulders, and the scarf is haphazardly draped around his neck and one end touches the floor. He stares at John in surprise, and a touch of embarrassment slackens his mouth.
That was perhaps a bit too far. Sherlock goes silent, mouth gaping like a fish, and forces the box into John’s hands without making eye contact. The older man smiles at the lovely blush filling the younger man’s cheeks.
“Oh, Rosie,” he sighs, placing the bottle in her chubby hands. “Do you know where your daft godfather is?”
He sits silently for an endless few moments, letting the kiss dry on his forehead as he thinks. “What exactly will these kisses mean to you, John? Are they being administered by a practicing doctor or a concerned friend?” Or--? John thinks.
Once John’s grabbed the gift and got it to stay in one place, dammit, he looks right at Sherlock and starts his speech.
John goes over to his side of the table -- which, if he were a braver man, would be the seat directly beside Sherlock’s but is currently at the other end -- and begins to eat on his sandwich as well. The silence isn’t uncomfortable on Sherlock’s end, as he clearly has delved back into his own world and doesn’t mind John’s presence, but John can’t help himself from feeling a little strange.
“Well, you do have quite a lot to make up to me. Let’s see if forever is long enough to get it all done.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes in return but, remarkably, makes no protest. He rises from his seat with another little grunt, one that’s just too forceful to be only from heaving himself from the chair, but John doesn’t say anything about it and neither does Sherlock.
"You will survive this, Sherlock," he said curtly, "We will both get out of this place with beating hearts, you and I both, hear? You won't be leaving again, not me."
But he wanted to die. He had wanted so badly to die and would have rather been murdered in one go with a bullet through his Godforsaken brain. But only one thing mattered now, the only thing that ever really mattered to Sherlock Holmes, and he couldn't bear to leave him the way things were likely to end.
Sherlock looked up, the drug of his heartbreak finally releasing him. The man in front of him was blonde, sturdy, familiar. Then, the fear inside of him morphed into solid fact. This man, the one who had begged him to stop digging his fingers into his skin, the one who cooed and soothed him.
Sherlock purses his lips and unconsciously rolls his shoulders, which only makes his lips purse tighter. “When have I been making these noises?”
After every piece of absolute shit they’d been through, after all John had put him through, he had to give him something wonderful, something that would express just how much John valued him, respected him, was irreversibly smitten with him.
And John is struck by the dopey look on the other man’s face. Now’s the time, he thinks. There are a few more presents to go, but there’s never been a better time for his gift.
“We do. A ham sandwich would be lovely, John, thank you. Is there anything you would like with your sandwich?”
But you do. I would do anything for you if you just said the word, John realizes, and the realization knocks the wind out of him.
And here he was, with a bullet snug in his gut and the (--married, actually...well, he was going to die anyways, so at least it wouldn't be a long affair.) man he loved on the verge of self-destruction. A question wafted through the air, and it was one he was afraid to answer. But he could never deny his blogger. Except when it came to little things like getting milk. (Obviously.)
The hard lines in John's face contracted and released from their as he finally stepped over and once again kneeled by Sherlock's side. He pressed his hands firmly against the white cloth while he was at it.
“Says Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the man who can tell everything about a person from a single glance, the man who makes the thought of privacy a thing of the past.”
That shouldn’t come as so much of a surprise to John, but it does. It really does. It annoys him, frustrates him, infuriates him. “I never did like Mycroft beating me in things. Knowing things before I did.”
He wants to kiss it, kiss it all. The scars, the smooth patches. His arching shoulder blades, the dipping lines of his abdomen, his collarbone, the knob of his neck, the bowl of his spine, the vertebrae, his shoulders, his arms, his fingertips. His lips gravitate toward the skin splayed out in front of him, but he holds himself back. He can’t do anything, anything, without asking him first, never again.
"Oh, love..." John says, tugging the other man's hand back into his own and tucking Sherlock back into his chest. "You silly man. How could you think I would go back to her? After everything that's just happened, after everything you've told me..."
“Sherlock....” John wants to offer him a sandwich, an apology, tea. Something to relieve the pressure inside his chest, something to make that sad little ghost on Sherlock’s face go away.
“I want you to be part of my family, Lock. You are already, actually, but I’ve noticed that you don’t seem to think so. I want to show you how much you mean to me, how much you-- you’ve always meant to me.” His voice is cracking on the ginormous emotions crowding his throat,  but he needs to get through this.
John doesn’t notice anything outright unusual. Posture a little strained, as though something is pinching him. Fingers steepled stiffly over his plush lips. (He would not dwell on the fact that he’d thought of those lips as ‘plush’.) His eyelids stretched thinly over the rapidly moving pools beneath them. If this man were in any way an ordinary person (which John was starting to suspect more and more), he would hazard to say he looked a upset and unhappy, as though trapped in a nightmare.
Fosset started at the use of his Christian name. He looked at the man standing awkwardly next to Watson and blinked.
A floorboard creaked about his head. His gaze flashed towards it. "How is Amelia? I feel I have done her a grievous wrong."
The confident step of a  rested soul made them both turn around. "Solved it already,Holmes? Anything you wish to share?"
She forced him to the ground and pressed the point into his shoulder. He tried to swerve away only to find his path blocked by several students. She leaned down into his face. "Not so funny now are you? It wouldn't take much for me to finish you off. She edged the umbrella point closer to the softness of his throat. "Even the strongest man has his weak spots…"
"I am not sure of this, sir. I do not feel that I would be welcome here. I am at best a bounder and at least a liar."
They strode out of the crisp autumn and into the hansom cab  that awaited them. Watson settled back in the seat as they drove off, but Holmes kept his eyes on the college gates. Mrs Holtz stood by the cycle shed. He acknowledged her with a tip of his hat. She mirrored the  gesture with a smile that held a thousand secrets.
“And then, about three weeks ago, she rediscovered a fraction of her herself, and went into the church. I found her in a pew adjacent to Lovellan’s memorial plaque. She had been sitting there in odd contemplation for some time when the parish ladies came in to refresh the altar flowers. They invited her to join them, which she did, albeit still as a muted shade of whom she had been.”
Holmes twisted the card into the light and examined it, before placing it on the occasional table. “Interesting. Describe him for me.”
Holmes was a brooding spectre on the window seat of  their room. "Come to bed," commanded Watson. "You've achieved as much can be done tonight."
" At the very stroke of three  o'clock. Be prepared for anything and everything, and all will be well. “
The resulting stab wound was not particularly severe; in fact, it was the savage blow to his head which proved the source of greatest concern.
