"God that must be it," Steve groaned, clamping his eyes shut in annoyance. "I've been trying to figure out where the little shit found liquor. He must've snuck out after we went to bed."
Harley nodded, shoving his face into the soft fur of the dog, pulling the blanket up around his shivering shoulders. "M' sorry. Please dont be mad."
‘Lmfao I wasn’t expecting you to be up this late Boy-Wonder’ Steve rolled his eyes, ‘Y do u think he was being a dick tho?’
Steve had known Peter for longer than Steve had known his own biological son, Steve thought of Peter as his own child and at this point couldn’t imagine leaving his family behind. Tony took Harley in as his own instantly upon meeting the boy but Peter had come first in everything in Tony’s life up to this point and that wouldn’t change anytime soon. Nobody - especially Steve - could fault him for that.
Steve huffed a short laugh, "Alright. I'll see if I can find someone. What do I do in the meantime though?"
"Yeah shes just acting kinda slow and shes making a little web tunnel n' that usually means they're gonna go into burmation soon. If she doesnt eat the silkworms I can probably just keep them and breed them for when she wakes up."
"Dad!" Peter leapt into his father's arms, Tony hugged his boy closely as he hung on like a koala bear. "I missed you so so much! Can we go get gelato now?"
"Alright, just swallow it like a pill. By the time we get to my house you should be feeling it." Flash seemed almost giddy. Did he already take something? His pupils didnt look blown or anything but he definatly wasnt acting normal. Maybe he was drunk?
"Dad please, I promise I'll be home early tomorrow! I'm really wanting to make friends here." The blond glared defiantly at his father, his tone nearing whiney.
Harley sighed, opening his palm toward the other boy who grinned victoriously, depositing a little smiley face into the outstretched hand.
"Well Flash is a dick. So are his friends." Happy replied, being familiar with the name by now. "Steve likes you, I dont see why his kid wouldnt."
Steve suppressed a smirk, "All valid points, most of which would have been avoided if you didnt sneak out. You know I have no problem with you drinking as long as it's at home so why did you go after I told you not to?"
Peter strided into his AP chem class, taking an empty seat towards the back of the room with his friend following close behind.
He laid the boy down in the teens own bed, grabbing the stuffed dog at the end of his bed and pushing it into his arms. He wiped his kids sweaty forehead with his palm and carded his fingers through the boy's sweat soaked hair. "We can talk about this in the morning kiddo. Try to get some sleep. The garbage can is right next to your bed."
“Not really. Everyone seems pretty off-put, I’m sure at a school like this everyone has been together since like preschool.” Harley laid back on the couch, laughing to himself, “Actually there was this one kid. He had this weird preppy name and he was like six it was so weird. Being that young in a school like this he’s gotta be a kiss-ass.”
"Harley wait! I'm sorry I didnt mean it, I swear to god its just- the drugs and stuff I promise. I'm not like that." The other boy rushed out, grabbing onto Harleys shoulder who only ripped away in response.
"Kid don't even start, I get it. I'd be floored if my dad pulled this crap. I think Tony probably just- just didnt realize how much it meant to you." The man was scripting out an angry text to the kids dad to send once they got home. He pulled into the lot and turned back to face the kid, "now what do you want? I'll let you get add ins if you promise not to tell your dad we stopped here."
“You’re my Peachy Keener though, I can’t just not call you that. I’ve got 14 years of embarrassment to catch up on.” Steve replied unbothered, pulling into the driveway and parking the car before turning to look at his son. “Be nice okay? You don’t need to be happy, you’re allowed to feel stressed out but it’s not fair to project your feelings onto other people. Try to give him a chance, I know you love Tony even if you won’t admit it and Peter is just like Tony in all the good ways.”
Its one thing to sneak out, sure. But taking random not-candy from a kid he just met while sneaking out? Sure hes smoked pot before, drank a little, but that was with the friends he grew up with, freinds he'd take a bullet for and knew would do the same for him.
Ned smirked, "C'mon dude you'll be fine. You know you're your dads top priority." He gently shoved his younger friend.
"Okay class, my name is Mr. Sage and I will be your American history teacher this year. Anyone in this school will tell you that I don't take any nonsense and I expect that to be respected." The older male took the time to make eye contact with each student individually, most definalty an intimidation tactic. Harley found himself squaring his shoulders and staring back defiantly. "Now, I want to go around the room for everyone to introduce themselves." The whole classroom groaned, causing the teacher to squawk in outrage of the ignoring of his expectations seconds before.
Steve nodded, "Alright. Good talk. I dont think this needs to be discussed any further then. Finish up and go get ready for bed, you can either clean your room tonight or tomorrow morning but its gotta get cleaned up before we leave to Tony's house."
“Harley Keen Rogers im losing my patience here bud,” His father rubbed the bridge of his nose between his fingers, leaning his head against his almost-fourteen year olds locked bedroom door. “I’m not letting you miss your first day. End of story. I’ll drag your butt kicking and screaming if you make me.”
Harley yawned, stretching his arms above his head and flexing his back as he stood up from his lunch table. The line had dissipated enough that he felt he could grab food now without much of a wait so he entered the canteen, taking in the smells of the food on the warmers laying along the perimeter of the octagonal room. He went up to a cooler, grabbing a chicken breast sandwich wrapped in saran wrap and a coke zero before taking his spot in line.
Harley felt himself trembling though he couldn't explain why if his life depended on it. "I'll see you Monday- I- I have to go." He said without turning back.
The boy took the phone and entered in his contact, confidently raising the phone to take a picture of himself for it before handing it back.
"Alright that's it, come here!" Tony flung the paper onto the counter and charged his son who squealed in return, he picked the boy up and threw him onto the couch, tickling his son until he was red in the face, worries pushed to the back of his mind.
“Come on, we have like forty-five minutes to get back before I have to put the facial masks in the fridge. Now when I think about it, we actually don’t have the time to eat, maybe takeaway?”
"Uhhh..." Steve hesitated. It was too soon for this talk and he had to move around the topic delicately. "At a bar."
"Nothing!" Tony chirped, smiling brightly. Steve narrowed his eyes but smiled back in the end. Someone was in a good mood.
“Oh, babe,” Steve said warmly, wrapping hands around his boyfriend and holding him close. He didn’t know much about Tony’s past and the life he had before he became Red Velvet, but something had to go wrong seeing how much he was emotionally involved. And Steve couldn’t be happier - he had a loving and caring boyfriend and an understanding and supportive mother. He feared so much he couldn’t have both and yet, it was happening.
Tony giggled again, clearly delighted with Steve being so handsy. "Okay," he agreed, plopping down on the covers again, "the last one before breakfast! Aaah!" Tony squeaked, when Steve sunk down right after him, trying to unwrap his fiancé from the tiny bathrobe, just like one unwraps a present, all accompanied by Tony's excited laughter, Steve's hungry growling, and the melody of '
“Hmmm,” Steve hummed in understanding, waiting for Tony to continue, but he didn’t say anything more. Tony had no problems with voicing out his needs on his site, but face to face with Steve, he was fumbling and struggling for words. Anonymity gave him a sense of control which was being stripped away from him, layer by layer. Maybe with time, Tony would open more, and it was on Steve’s side to nurture that vulnerable mindset until Tony would feel strong enough and confident to voice out his true needs.
"You're always beautiful to me," Steve said honestly, meaning every word. He was seeing the same Tony was, but in contrary to Tony, Steve appreciated every change. It made Tony real and tangible and warm, and Steve didn't want a frozen perfection, almost unnatural. The day Steve had found his first grey hair among blonde ones, they both had celebrated, Steve maybe a bit more than Tony, relieved that even if it happened slower, he was aging. He didn't want to live forever and he certainly didn't want to live without Tony and it gave him hope that he won't have to. Just losing the serum was a different story. A one that had danger written all over it.
"Well, in that case, I might as well carry it to our bedroom," Steve said, turning around and taking the first step, deeply enjoying the outraged screech his husband made. It was pretty simple - Figaro had his scrunchie to play with and Steve had his Tony. And like all games, this one also had to come to an end, and Tony was put down and the couch got back in its place. And if Tony still wanted to kick Steve out of the bedroom for his mischief, convincing him not to do so, was another story.
Red Velvet tilted her head to the side, looking at Steve in a soft way. “I guess you were not the only one who wanted this meeting to happen.”
Feeling a nervous twist in his stomach, Tony peeked into the bedroom, just to feel if the situation was as bad as he feared. Steve was on the bed, forehead creased in thought, and was looking at the space in front of him until he spotted Tony from the corner of his eyes.
"Stop talking," Steve ordered. Tony's eyes became even wider at the commanding tone and he stared at his husband, blinking in confusion.
Steve felt his face blushing and looked at his shoes in panic. He had no clue how to explain this all.
"Ah, ma! One more thing!" Steve interrupted this time, taking a step forward and standing next to his boyfriend. He took a deep breath and smiled, wrapping an arm around Tony's shoulders. "Ma, this is Tony - my boyfriend."
"I see them!" Steve called, firing back in the direction from where the attack came. He saw Bucky's mud splashed face, ducking behind some trees, Sam following, a grin shining on mud covered face. Paintball war was one of Steve and Sam's favorite past times, so it seemed a good idea to invite their friends over for a match.
Steve laughed, wrestling Tony down and pinning his hands once again. If Tony was already getting this worked up, there was no way Steve would back up.
Sarah laughed embarrassedly, something Steve inherited from her. "So, you noticed, huh?" she asked back, looking down at her knees with a small smile. "I am just trying something new."
Tiberius just smiled in a more wicked way, enjoying the show. "Maybe later. And maybe this time I will give you to Hammer to play with. I recall he had a good time with you. Right, Hammer?"
"It is good to see you, Sam," Sarah smiled, feeling at ease after meeting someone familiar. "How is your bakery doing?"
“H-hey!” Steve giggled when Tony rubbed his stubble over the tender skin on his neck. It was a bit prickly, even if Tony used a special blend of oils to keep his facial hair smooth and healthy, but Steve’s neck was also really sensitive and soon laughter started pouring out of him. “Toohohony!”
“I know what that means,” Steve said, looking around the room. It was spacious with a carpet, a sofa, a vanity station, and a huge closet. Red was the main color in the room, but everything was toned enough to not be obnoxious. “So, are you…?” he asked, not finding words to finish. In fact, it wasn’t his business and he felt that he was already pushing Red Velvet too much today and barging into her life.
"What! Oh My God! Are you for real, Steve that's incredibly amazing. Maybe, one day you could paint me, I'd love to see how beautiful I look. You truly are one talented prince."
Steve couldn't help but thought how Tony was a stunningly attractive, charismatic man. The man's charm was drawing him in.
It had made Steve felt weak and powerless, he hated it. No one should be in a state like this, they deserved far more, they deserved happiness.
"Maybe Stark's just in my mind? Since every where I go, Stark's name is always mentioned." Steve sighed.
Steve got inside the car. "Did you just get of Stark's car? Or was I just hallucinating things?" Clint asked.
That tingling feeling was back, Steve swallowed down his throbbing heart. He couldn't let his heart get in between him and Tony. No, he'd never risk that.
He knocked on the little boy's room and entered. The boy was asleep. Tony walked over to the bedside and placed the things he bought on the table.
Until a sudden knock on the door interrupted him. He looked up and saw Bucky leaning against the door, hands folded across. "You seem to be really into that book, Stevie."
Tony's eyes widened, he never thought someone like Steve would cry 'cause of him. Tony felt gutted, all he wanted was pull Steve into a hug and comfort him.
Tony struggled to break free, even though he knew it was pointless. "Please, stop Steve." Tony pleaded, he was scared.
"If you leave now, we probably won't see you for another decade. Our sons just became friends, we should give them more time to play withe each other." Steve's father looked at Steve and smiled.
Tony stared at him blankly, he pushed the helmet Steve's way. "You're the who's riding the bike in front, so it's important that you  wear the helmet. Forget about me, I don't need it."
Tony let out a chuckle. "Hell yes! You do have a mirror, right? I mean, have you seen how you look?"
Steve couldn't do anything but watch, as Tony's body dropped hard to the ground taking the life force out of him. Tony couldn't breathe, he felt a sharp pain across his whole body, it hurt so bad. He couldn't move nor see, all he saw was the darkness that was slowly devouring him bit by bit.
Bucky covered his mouth. "Shush!" Whilst using his other hand to indicate the shush sign with his index finger on his lips.
"Tony knew I always wanted a kid and he knew that if I stayed with him I would never have that. He said there was someone out there who would love me then him. I believed that utterly nonsense, not even for a second. I left so I could give him time to think through." Steve explained, his voice sounded so broken.
"The boy, has a poor health and an extremely weak body. He needs to be in full mediations at all times." The doctor stated.
Steve gaped at Tony, he looked really pissed off. Tony Stark was a busy man, the fact that he even took his time to spend it with Steve. So, without arguing Steve nodded and wore the helmet. "Crystal Clear." He replied. "And by the way, Stark. I'm three years older then you."
The sudden knock on the door made him lose focus from the painting into the reality. "Come in." He called out, not worrying about the fact that it might seem a little too weird having countless of painting of Tony Stark in his room.
"Are you trying to escape from me too, Boo?" Steve asked with a dangerous tone to his voice. He couldn't help himself from teasing the man.
Just when Bucky thought their mission was going smoothly, then this happened. Life truly was cruel; it was the bitter truth.
"Why can't you just stay in the palace with me, you can also be home schooled with me."  Steve tried his best to somehow convince Tony to stay. Judging by Tony's expression Steve already knew the answers to it and he didn't like it.
If only he knew. But that was impossible cause there were way too many gaps. He'd never been able to figure Natasha out; she was always a mystery. But, there was something about her that drew him. Every times he's near her, he always gets this tingly feeling.
Steve pressed his body against Tony really tight. "Are fucking kidding me?" Steve shouted, his eyes were full of anger and betrayal.
"No, J.A.R.V.I.S don't. Pepper! It's not my blood. I swear, I'm perfectly fine" Tony reassured Pepper.
Bucky took a deep breath, he managed to calm himself down, he tried focusing on what was around him. Maybe, this was his only way out?
Tony got out the car and hugged his dad tight and then his mom, "I'll miss you guys. I love you and be safe, mom and dad." His parents kissed him goodbye and went, leaving Tony alongside the royal family.
Tony felt sympathetic toward the little boy, he hoped that the boy would get better. He's only a kid, he should out playing with other kids, instead he's in the hospital with a lot of health issues. If only Tony could help him, maybe there's a way for him to help the boy.
"Aren't you going to show me your bed chamber, my young prince?" Tony asked, lifting his right eyebrow.
Steve noticed how Tony clutched his bathrobe when he was speaking. Whatever he was hiding , Tony clearly didn't want Steve to know or see it. He was totally okay with Tony having the bathrobe on during the intercourse. He respected Tony's privacy, but deep down he was worried about him.
"Oh My God! Steve, you actually are. Wait, are you those people, who do it with the person they love? That's freaking adorable, Steve." Tony gently ruffled Steve's hair.
After an hour or so, Steve had woken up in a hospital bed. His mum was beside him. Bucky was sitting on the couch.
The next morning, Tony had woken up, with a really bad hangover. He let out a deep groan as his head throbbed in pain. With the tip of his finger, he gently massaged his forehead. Not that it helped his headache, but it sure felt nice.
He'd seen this look before, years ago. He knew that look. Oh God! Tony was afraid of him. Steve's eyes widened in shock. No, this was not the time to be panicking, Steve. He pushed his thoughts to the side and focused on Tony.
Tony burst into laughter. "Is that what's troubling you? More like you'd be the one in trouble, along with me. A month ago, I was suspended for 2 weeks, for accidentally blowing up the science lab.
It was already midnight and Steve still had his dim lights on. He leaned against his bed frame, his eyes were fixed on the book he was reading. The chapter he was in pretty much summarized the incident that happened just fews hours to Steve.
Why was he so happy when he heard about what Natasha said about him to Tony. Bucky couldn't help but smile, he seemed more content.
Steve gaped at Bucky. Why did Bucky, all of sudden bring that topic? Why was he so eager to change the topic about Tony? Steve mind was full questions.
"Well that house didn't have that much security. I didn't see any CCTV. He was drunk, plus he doesn't remember"
They both headed out of hospital and went near the car. Just before, Tony got inside his car. He saw a gift store on the opposite side of the street.
Steve looked at the door, but there was no one there. He tried his best not to look disappointed. Not that he was fooling anyone, especially himself.
"God damn it, that's what we're trying to do, Stark." Nick Fury growled. "Just how many times are you gonna risk your life? Believe it or not, but there are hell of a lot of people who care about you, Stark."
Steve had seen this beautiful smile, when he'd first met Tony months ago. He could remember that night so vividly in his mind. It was one of those exquisite memories, which Steve could never forget.
Just a second ago, Tony seemed so happy but then in 0.1 seconds later Tony stomped his way out in anger.
"I know you can hear me, just please open your eyes." Tony pleaded. "I can't stand watching you suffer, just tell me you're okay."
Steve sighed out in relief, the man's attention seemed to be elsewhere, that's why he hadn't caught sight of Steve at all. Even though, he had hid in the most obvious place.
The sky cried, that night. The lightning contrasted with the darkness of the night. The sudden booming noise of the thunder was in synced with Steve's heart beat, like it wanted to escape from his chest. The heavy rain poured down, it was as if someone was pouring a bucket full of water on them.
"Shit, how could I have not guessed that. Obviously, a rich guy would only could afford to pay for that expensive treatment." Bucky let out a deep sigh.
Tony put his hands in the air, surrendered himself, he shook his head. "Okay, fine! Look guys, I'll be honest, so what if I find Steve attractive? He is fucking hot as fuck and not just cause his blond. He has beautiful blue eyes and I kinda got lost in those eyes for a few seconds; that's how pretty his eyes were. His deep voice matched his perfect looks and those broad shoulders, fucking hell. His body's so sexy. I'm not exaggerating at all, but even a straight guy like me would fall for him. Not that I like him or anything, especially not in romantic way. So don't you dare to jump into conclusions. I admit I find Steve really attractive, but that's all and nothing more." Tony said, he was trying catch his breath. Tony couldn't even believe the most of the things he just said.
"Stark is too God damn stubborn, Romanoff. He's selflessness is what's going to kill him and knowing that I can't just stand there doing nothing." Steve overheard Nick talking to Natasha, while he walking out of the room.
How did Steve end up here? The last thing he remembered was passing out on Tony's lap. Was Tony the one who brought him here? But, where exactly was he anyway?
Steve happily grabbed the sunscreen from his bag and squirted a whole heap into his hand before realising he hadn’t thought this through. He was going to have to touch Tony. He was going to have to touch Tony all over. And while the thought of that was both torture and bliss, it really wasn’t going to help with Operation Don’t Get a Boner. Still, he squared his shoulders. He could do this.
“No, I don’t think he’s aware.” She rolled her eyes. “For someone with such a big heart, he has the emotional intelligence of a hedgehog.”
” Tony eyed the open doorway murderously. He pinched the bridge of his nose. “God, you’re like a walking meme, Rogers.”
“Pepper,” Steve said gently. “Tony is in trouble. He wouldn’t blame you for revealing something if you thought it would help us find him.”
“Pardon?” Sometimes Steve had trouble telling which of Tony’s odd sayings were common and he would be expected to know, and which were ridiculously eccentric even by modern standards.
Tony sighed. He definitely couldn’t avoid his teammate’s enthusiastic clutches forever. Looks like Tony’s Tanning Time was over. Eventually (once he’d cooled off), they convinced him to join them. And they also ended up breaking the ball. And the net. And the pool. But Tony was fairly certain he could fix the last one before the owner noticed. Who knew? Perhaps he’d even improve it.
Steve didn’t let Tony get another word in edgewise. He was too busy kissing him. Tony’s brain might have short-circuited there for a moment. He had Steve’s lips on his and one of Steve’s large, warm hands cupping his face, and oh – yep, oh boy – Steve’s tongue brushing inquisitively against his own. Tony melted. For a long moment, he let himself enjoy this. Then he pulled back.
?” Not that that was going to do much against Captain America. Still, he struggled against his bounds for a minute, furious despite the weak-ass attempt. They’d tried to burn his Steve alive.
where what had him exhausted. Thankfully, the team seemed to buy it. The problem was, the turbulence wasn’t getting any better. Tony closed his eyes as he was tossed around in his seat. He couldn’t help but imagine the headlines:
She bared her teeth at him. “Don’t think we’re not going to talk about the fact that you’ve been sick and didn’t tell us Tony.”
And of course, the others, who had scooted in to hear, started laughing. Or rather, Clint and Thor were laughing (actually, Thor’s laugh was loud enough to alarm their fellow passengers. A mother across the aisle was giving him a very dirty look while her two tiny tots looked on in awe). Natasha was smirking and Bruce was kindly hiding a smile. Yep, definitely his favourite.
“And just what is that smug look for, Mr Star-Spangled Man With a Plan?” Tony demanded, stepping into Steve’s space to poke him in the chest.
However, when Steve opened the door, even he fought a wince. It was small, dingy, dirty, and most importantly, there was only one bed. Some days Tony wondered if someone up there hated him. If so, it was probably his father. He surveyed the room in silence for a moment before grabbing a few things from his duffel and disappearing into the bathroom.
He tossed the wipes into the bin and lifted his head high. “I know. Because I don’t know what I’m going to do if we don’t.” He straightened up. “Okay Avengers, let’s brainstorm ideas. I want the name of every enemy Tony has who’s on our blacklist, any villain we’ve faced recently who might have the motive or opportunity to do this.”
“Okay, nope, nope that’s enough. We can leave that right there. I’ve had enough let-down speeches to know when to give up on them. Cap.” Tony stared him straight in the face. “I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry. I don’t know what I was thinking telling you any of that, but it was inappropriate and misguided, and it will never happen again.”
“You know what,” Nat said silkily, because of course she’d be the first to cotton on to his discomfort, “I think we should leave these two alone a moment. I think they have some things to discuss.”
Tony gave an exaggerated sigh. “And here I was hoping that this would be like the filler episode where the fire-nation teens bond over traumatising an island of vacationers through the power of teen angst and firepower.”
Tony snorted. “Probably Zuko. Exiled fire-nation prince who starts out a villain but who ends up joining the cause to help the Avatar save the world.”
By the time Tony had finished chewing the little bird brain out for taking advantage of Steve’s lack of twenty-first century know-how, the rest of the team had congregated outside Steve and Tony’s room, ready for a day of tourist-ing. (God help Miami). Steve didn’t seem bothered by Clint’s prank, and decided to keep the shirt on. Which was painful for Tony, primarily because even with it on he was still more stunning than every California model Tony had ever met. At least he’d left the socks ‘n sandals combo at home. Thank God for small mercies.
He finished clearing the main floor, leaving a trail of unconscious and pitifully groaning criminals in his wake. “You think I’m bad,” he muttered. “Good luck dealing with the American health system.” He joined Natasha and Bruce downstairs. They’d only cleared the main room and so he went further down the darkened hallway, checking empty room after empty room. Until he found one that wasn’t empty. Until he found one with-
Okay, now Steve was slightly more concerned. He sent a group text saying he was going to look for Tony and Nat messaged back that she and Bruce would check the local hospitals, and Clint and Thor said they’d check out the beach and local malls. Steve started with the bar they’d gone to the other night. God it would be terrible if Tony had relapsed, but right now he just wanted to find him. Nothing could be more terrible than the sinking feeling in his gut the longer he went without hearing from him. It was that slow slide that your body picked up on before your brain. Because you knew something was wrong, you could feel it in your bones, but at the start you could convince yourself that nothing awful had happened, that there was a perfectly good explanation for all of this. But the longer it went on the more that feeling rose to the forefront of your hind-brain and insisted you took notice. That this wasn’t just a bad feeling you could shake off, oh no. Something
Arrow laughed friendly. “Yeah, and you take plenty of time to cover your back rolls. See you on stage!”
“Hello everyone!” Red Velvet greeted the crown, smiling softly and charming. Her blue eyes scanned the crowd, which she could see perfectly thanks to the small lit lamps on every table. “I can see some new faces,” she greeted the newcomers with positive energy, getting an overwhelming cheer in return as she waved and sent kisses. “And—” she continued, her eyes stopping on Steve’s and Sam’s table for two seconds longer than on everyone else, “— some familiar faces.”
The song ended on a sad note and Steve was back again, together with the crowd and clapping with everyone else. His mind cooled down and he felt that he could think more rationally, yet when Red Velvet smiled gratefully at the audience, his heart did that weird flip-flop thing he heard about only from the movies.
Friday didn't answer. Steve let out a long breath, trying not to think too much about it. He trusted Friday. He trusted Tony. He didn't like that Friday was so secretive and that Tony had sneaked away, but it couldn't be anything too horrible.
Tony didn't remember the last time when he was so afraid. He wasn't so afraid, even when Tiberius once had brought a knife to one of their 'dates', much to Killian’s and Hammer’s amusement and Tony’s terror, threatening to carve his initials on Tony’s skin, just to leave a reminder of who he belonged to. Just one of the many stories Tony had to share when it came to his ‘boyfriend’.
“Ma, what are you doing here?” Steve asked, suddenly very aware that he was in a cosmetic shop and that he didn’t belong here, while his mom did.
“A drag queen? Yeah, he knows. We had this talk when I once wanted to wear an orange dress and he tried to talk me out of it. The whole joke is that, that he looks great in orange, just doesn’t know it,” Tony laughed, making sure that the road behind them was clear before he drove out of the parking and into the street.
“I am fine,” Tony said, not meaning it, his voice coming out squeaky. “Can we - excuse me, I have to go,” Tony rambled out, sending a sorry look in Pepper’s direction and trying to walk out of the conference room as calmly as possible. It felt like the whole world was spinning around him, making him feel nauseous. Tony stumbled to the window and pressed his face against the cool glass, trying to soothe his heated skin and get his thoughts back in order.
“It will be better if we drizzle some honey on it, trust me,” Steve said, standing up, “you have honey?”
"You are not eating with me?" Steve asked, taking a fork and easily cutting through into the fluffy pancakes.
"Yhm. You stood out for me when no one else did. All this time, Stone made me feel like if I wasn't worth anything and I was not worth saving. And then you came and… I guess that seeing you being able to sacrifice so much for me while practically not knowing me, gave me the strength to believe that if I can be worth something to you, maybe I am not so useless," Tony said, smiling sadly and looking at his shoes.
Red Velvet made a sympathetic sound and walked to Steve's side, pulling his head down to press to her chest. "You are getting all emotional, baby."
"Um, hi," Steve blinked, not knowing who Latrice was and why was calling Tony so early. Then he realized, that it probably was a stage name and Latrice was one of Red Velvet's sisters. Mr. Blue Velvet and Miss Red Velvet's, as they were dubbed in the Olive yesterday, engagement was no secret, photos from the event already going around on social media.
for inspiration! Steve's outfit is the outfit Chris Evans had on during Oscar Gala in 2019, if you are wondering.
"You are being a little cold towards me lately, Tony," Tiberius seethed, cupping Tony's jaw with one hand and forcing bruising kisses on his lips. There was laughter ringing in Tony's ear, undoubtedly Aldrich and Hammer enjoying the show. "Do I need to fix your attitude, again?" he asked, not liking the way Tony was looking at him. Angry and disgusted. Maybe at school he had to hold back, but in the dark space under the bleachers, he could show his true feelings. "Answer me!"
"Uhmm…" Tony just looked back at Sarah, unsure how to react. Subtly, he turned to Steve, looking for help and Steve had to hold back to not start laughing at his boyfriend's panic.
"You have a private chauffeur who drives you to school, right?" he asked Tony, and the brunet confirmed with a nod. The chauffeur didn't pick him up after school, as it was well known that Tony spent afternoons with his 'boyfriend'. Steve felt sick just from thinking about this. "After the last lesson wait for me in your class. If I won't be able to make it for some reason, Bucky will come for you. Never leave school alone."
"I didn't, my mom did," Steve explained with a shrug, but Tootsie didn't even listen to him, just ranted away.
“That’s Thor. He is Loki’s older brother. Stepbrother. It is funny to watch them bicker, but they are very effective.”
"Dude, seriously?" Steve asked, blankly. Sam was also wearing a hairnet, although he kept his hair in a buzz cut.
"What the hell is that?!" Steve shrilled, pointing a shaking finger at the bathtub. In the water, in soap suds, was floating an ominous mass of black hair, tangling and curling around each other, the bottom of the bathtub almost entirely covered.
Steve froze, his brain registering the words, breaking them apart and putting together again. Break in. Black pumps. Him.
"Stop what?" Tony asked innocently, pressing the long stripe of material to Steve's back and smoothing over the sticky substance. Oh God, it almost started.
The girl jutted her left hip forward and shook her head full of curly hair. Sharp eyebrows, long eyelashes, big lips colored with an electric blue lipstick giving that special pop to the look and tight black dress made from lace. Not the most extravagant look Steve had seen on a drag queen, but there was something hypnotic about it.
"No amount of makeup will help that face," Tootsie grumbled out, teasing her friend, and Lady Mint snorted so hard, the prosecco came out through her nose and more laughter followed.
“Well, under all that makeup there is a regular person inside,” Sam smiled a bit too obvious when Steve sent him a dry look, “someone once told me that. Can’t remember who. Sounds dumb anyway.”
Steve gritted his teeth. He threw on a brave face and trotted after Tony, holding in his hand the shopping basket.
The guy smiled. It was a wider smile than the one he used to see on Red Velvet’s face, showing some laugh lines. Maybe that’s why Red Velvet’s smile was subtler.
"It is just -" Steve rubbed his forehead more vigorously. "I have something to do, but I don't want to mess it up and lose what I already have. I don't know if I am doing the right thing here."
“Sure,” Tony finally said and motioned for Steve to follow him. “Just don’t write down all of my tricks, some things should remain a mystery.”
The mall was crowded as usual on the weekends and Steve was surprised that they ended in the mall anyway. He expected that Tony would take him to some small shop, outside the city, where they could have all the privacy they wanted. But how it turned out, he misunderstood Tony’s offer completely.
"I can't believe, you sold our cat," Steve said in a heavy voice, eyebrows drew together and jaws clenched angrily. This wasn't right.
"What the-" Steve focused his eyes and saw Tony looming over him, a satisfied smile spread over his boyfriend's lips. Steve continued to massage his brow, not understanding what just happened and why he was insulted as the first thing after wakening up. "Tony, what the fuck-"
The second time Steve woke up was not so long after the first time, maybe around 30 minutes later from the first one, and was much more abrupt. Steve smelled smoke. He sat up on the bed straight away, eyes darting around and trying to spot the flickering flame, his mind racing to get to Tony and get him out and alarm the other Avengers.
"Oh, honey!" Sarah greeted Tony in a compassionate voice, arms wrapped around the shocked brunet in a comforting manner. Tony kept still and after a moment of hesitation, very timidly returned the hug, sending beaming Steve confused looks.
"Oh, right. Steve, this is my partner, Rhodey," Tony introduced and Steve's mouth dropped open again.
Tony moved quietly, tiding around and brushing off the leaves from the headstone. He picked up a withered bouquet of brownish flowers from the center and put fresh ones in their place. What surprised Steve, was when Tony quickly looked around, left and right, and took a cigar from the inside of his coat and put underneath the flowers. Gifts for his parents.
Nourishing serum for the night. Moisturizer for the day with jojoba oil. A shampoo bar, thing Steve didn’t even know that existed, that smelled like berries. It was just the beginning and the basket was filling up, as Tony was going from stand to stand, choosing his favorites, sometimes turning to Steve and asking him to smell things. Soon every scent started to mingle into a one, aromatic ball of perfume and he felt a beginning of a headache.
"No can do, Cap," Tony teased, using Steve's nickname playfully, just as if to show that Steve might be the Captain of the Avengers team, but Tony was the one in charge right now. "You fell in love with me being loud," Tony hummed, putting one leg over Steve's hips and moving to the center. "You married me being loud," he continued to list, leaning in closer, hands braced on the covers on each side of Steve's head, their lips almost touching. "And you fuck me loud," Tony whispered hotly, pressing his lips over Steve's, initiating another kiss, one that Steve could feel deep in his throat and sending a nice tingle down his body.
Even the outrageous amount of makeup couldn’t hide the pink blush on Red Velvet’s face and Steve smiled moving back and giving his lady — his man — some space to get undressed and ready to go.
"Ma, did you mean Tony?" he asked, wiping his mouth with his sleeve which earned him another stern look.
That calmed down Steve a little bit. The minutes before the show started were always killing him. “Thanks, Arrow,” he answered, of course knowing the waitress’ name. He knew all names of the employees of the Olive.
Steve's mouth opened and he kept looking at the screen, long after the commercial was gone. He really felt proud of Tony. And he felt stupid, for crossing out this idea so quickly. He should had known that Tony had some sort of plan.
Steve put down the basket and took the two lipsticks, turning more to the light. For the inexperienced eye, both lipsticks seemed red. Steve saw the subtle differences. One was a bold, cherry color, the other a deep, rosy red. One was matt finish, the other sparkly finish.
"Steve. Where the hell are you?" Tony asked, growing more and more worried. He heard enough of heartbreaking coming out stories and he would never live it down if Steve would become one of them.
"Don't worry, dear, if I didn't want people to look at me, I wouldn't dress the way I do," Mint said, fixing her hair and making it even puffier. It brought attention to her nails, long and painted with mint color nail polish with some crystals at the tips. "I met your son once at Red's apartment. You have a very charming son, Mrs. Rogers."
"Tadaaah!" Sarah exclaimed playfully, putting in front of Steve a perfect slice of a perfect apple pie. "Hope you still like it."
"It's great," Steve said enthusiastically, although he felt that nothing could top good ol' double chocolate chip cookies. "Is Mama here?"
Steve laughed. “Maybe.” Truth to be told, he wouldn’t mind another home spa evening with his boyfriend. They both could use some pampering and some calm moments only to themselves.
“Okay!” Steve called, way too enthusiastic than he planned to and left some bills on the table, gaining on the brunet, his heart pounding with excitement.
"Hah!" Tony shivered when Steve's hands moved to his back and pulled him closer, hands reaching down and resting on the round butt cheeks. "Oh? What are you planning?" Tony asked with a smile, and Steve didn't answer, just grinned back and let his hands do the talking.
Steve had to contain himself to not jump up from the couch and yell out in happiness. Instead, his smile grew bigger, finally feeling at ease with himself. Everything was out, no more secrets and his mom accepted all and each of them. It was an amazing feeling.
“Oh,” Steve said, nodding in understanding. “It is fine,” there wasn’t anything else he could say to that.
Tony sniffled, taking a moment to answer. He was taught to live in secret and hide who he was. Maybe he had his own unresolved coming out issues. And as much as he loved being with Steve and enjoyed his conversations with Sarah, bringing them together would lead to topics Tony was trying to avoid. He didn’t want to mess up Steve’s life, but he slowly realized that he was afraid of what Sarah would think of him. He already once disappointed one parental figure, he couldn’t do it for the second time. He was a coward.
“Actually,” Tony hesitated, rubbing at his shorter goatee. The skin itched a little bit after hours of being covered in latex. “I was thinking that maybe tonight I will take you to my place? Maybe we could spend the weekend together,” he added, suddenly sounding shy.
"Hey, so want to go to my place and eat what my mom made?" Steve asked in a playful tone after the kiss ended.
Steve sighed dramatically. He liked to think that Tony belonged only to him, but Red Velvet had many sisters that clearly wanted to congratulate her and be a part of the big day. What kind of fiancé Steve would be if he denied Tony that?
"Hi, honey! Did you miss me already?" Tony asked in a flirty tone, waiting for a reply that didn't come. "Uh… hello? Steve?" Tony tried again. There was some uneven breath on the other side, and before Tony could panic, Steve finally spoke in a hollow voice.
"You know you love me," Tony said sounding too cheerful and spreading more of the sugar paste on Steve's broad back.
One cleaning and few pills of Claritin later, they ended on the couch, Steve's head settled on Tony's lap, as he still felt a bit fuzzy. Tony put some movie on, but Steve didn't pay attention, going over what just happened.
Steve rubbed his face. It was almost as if Tony had planned to let his guilt consume him and ignore the topic.
Slowly, Tony started to smile, Sarah's words getting into him and soothing him. It was a good beginning.
"Hey," Tony protested, sliding hand into his jacket and searching for his pack, finding empty space.
"Honey… Come on, let's go. Please," Tony reached his hand for Steve's cold one, and gently tugged him over and together, step by step, they walked back into the building and back to Tony's apartment.
“I was just so confused, I don’t know when I even found myself outside your building. I think I just got overwhelmed with it all.”
Third - Steve considered himself not an interesting person. He didn’t have Tony’s charisma, who, of course, had the biggest social media following ever, Thor’s flair, which made his Youtube channel where he tasted food sent to him from all over the world by his viewers a huge success or Clint’s humor, whose Internet activity limited to commenting on funny animal photos and home videos and people loved him. Even Bruce, seemingly even more awkward and distant when it came to dealing with a privacy-invading crowd, was doing great, kindling the interest of young kids in science with a series of easy to repeat experiments at home and railing about the importance of protecting and preserving the environment. Even Natasha didn’t have a problem, her social media accounts full of useful self-defense tips for everyone who needed to feel safer. Steve just couldn’t find anything in himself he would like to share with the world. He liked to keep his art private, his relationship private, and his whole life private.
"How come you can look but I can't?" Steve asked in a faked hurt voice and Tony laughed, closing the door.
"You are the multitalented one," he pointed out to Arrow, meaning her talent for designing clothes and nearly circus acts on stage, and Arrow held her chin proudly, "you are the funny one," he turned to Lady Mint, "and you are the pretty one," Steve ended on Red and then turned to Tootsie. "And that makes you-?"
The rest of the evening was relatively calm. Peter changed into his normal clothes and came back just in time when the pizza arrived, and Tony trusted the teenagers to chose a good horror movie and later he had to admit, that it was quite decent. Maybe it wasn't the date night Tony and Steve had in mind, neither the Halloween party Peter wanted, but spending time together like that was nice too.
“What?” Steve asked, not being one to complain, but his arm started to hurt. Maybe he should have taken two baskets.
Red shrugged, standing up and going to her vanity station. "He has some… weird vibe around him. Like if being an owner of a bakery is something he doesn't want to do."
"Sure, will drop to your place after I settle things at work," Tony said, taking a pack of cigarettes out of the inside pocket in his jacket and put one in his mouth.
The place was getting crowded and more lively, as more drag queens started to appear. Tony's friend showed up next, boy name Bruce, drag queen name Lady Mint, who worked downtown and was a type of drag queen Tony referred to as a comedy queen, meaning exaggerated makeup and a witty, observant sense of humor. Bruce as a person seemed like a nice guy, a bit distant and in his own world, but Steve could picture that drag brought out a new side in him. Arrow showed fashionably late, carrying a stack of fashion magazines and fabric samples, the most invested into the costume design world of all queens.
Tony doubled with laughter, when Steve closed the door, a wet towel slapped across his face. Judging by the laughter coming from the other side, it had to be Bucky who had shrieked, while Sam's was howling.
The elevator stopped on their floor and Tony and Steve went out, hearing familiar voices. Two laughs and... a booming, stern voice, belonging to their son.
"You were kinda loud today," Steve said, on a similar note to Tony's earlier comment, stating a fact.
"Nu-uh. Your shoes, your problem," Steve said firmly, more than sure that he would break a leg minutes after putting the shoes one.
"What?" Steve smiled, lifting himself and leaning his back against the headrest. Tony, still in his night robe, was smiling with love at him, his face a bit tired, lit with the glow of the sunrise. Some claimed that no one looked good in orange, but Tony presented himself flawlessly, almost as some divine creature out of this world.
"Pleaaase?" Tony whined, putting his hands together in a pleading gesture, the pumps bumping into each other with a soft sound. "I need them for my nearest show and it will take ages before I break them in, with your shoe size it will just take a day-"
Steve smiled, remembering the song. It was mellow and more carefree than what usually Tony sang. Steve wouldn’t dare to say that it had a cheerful and subtle country note, but it reminded him a bit of that.
Sipping his drink, Steve listened to Tootsie, singing her rock songs and planning even more changes.
Reluctantly, Tony did so. There was still a blush on his face and Steve was sure, it wasn’t makeup this time. A whole lot of insecurities in the brown eyes. This was so much different from when Tony was Red Velvet. Poised and strong and confident. And Steve loved them both. He wanted to be there for Tony in his strongest moments and his most vulnerable. All the time.
Tony didn't react on time, feeling both of his hands being sharply twisted to the back. He screamed in pain and tears shone in his eyes.
“I made you something to warm you up,” Tony said gently, putting the mug down and pouring some of the hot liquid inside, the scent of ginger and spices and oranges filling the room. “Drink it slowly, it is very hot,” Tony waited for Steve to sit up before handing him the mug.
Steve started to crumble. Still, he didn't like that Tony made such a decision without him. "How long will all this be in sale?" he asked in a tired voice, pointing to the box.
ta-dam, the big reveal of Tony's drag mom! also, some more of my fav drag queens got a shout-out. Sam's drag name was created by roshytsunami.tumblr.com, thank you for following this story! and thank you,
“I don’t know,” Tony said quickly, sounding defensive. He didn’t mean to, but it was stranger than him. He didn’t want Steve to judge him, to think less of him, but… It was Steve. Steve who was always so understanding and didn’t laugh at him and did his best to keep Tony feel accepted. It won’t work if Steve would be the only one willing to share. “I guess,” Tony corrected himself, trying to be more open, “I like the trust in it. And closeness,” he said, tugging on Steve’s clothes and hiding more into his boyfriend, “and, uh, it feels good.”
"Uhhmm, before you go, could you help me with something?" Tony asked in a sultry voice, sitting up and smoothening hands over the covers in a slow, long move, until he was laying flat on his belly, legs crossed delicately in the ankles. Eyes having that helpless, pleading look that made Steve feel weak in the knees immediately. It was almost hypnotizing.
“Sure,” Steve nodded, feeling that they both would enjoy that. He sampled the fruit salad and scrunched his nose. “Needs some honey,” he stated, finding it not enough sweet.
“HIHIHIHI!” Tony giggled loudly, fireworks exploding under his eyelids. The attack was short and sweet, and after a few more seconds, Steve moved away, letting his laughing boyfriend curl in a trembling, heavy breathing ball.
And then Steve got on one knee in front of her and took a black velvet jewelry box out of his pocket.
"Oh good, you're here!" Red called, turning around for a second, just to see who it was. Steve had walked on Tony in the middle of his transformation, he already had a face full of makeup, except the lipstick, hair hidden under the cap and was changing his clothes, already tucked in and in pantyhose and clearly struggling with a bra. It wasn't the most glamorous part of being a drag queen, but the view of Tony's shapely legs in sheen pantyhose caused Steve's heart to do a little flip. "Can you clasp my bra?" Tony asked, turning his back to Steve, holding the strap in each hand.
"Get some sleep," Steve whispered, not wanting to disturb the sleepy silence and kissing Tony's forehead. "I will look after them."
It was when Steve finished his drink and put the empty mug away with a quiet sound on the nightstand table when Tony spoke.
"No, sir," Steve denied with a smile, moving his face to match Tony's, lips getting closer and closer. "And I gotta say, you clean up rather nicely," Steve said, meaning that it has been a while since Tony wore a suit, not for a formal event, not for a public speaking, but just for his husband.
"I am gonna cry. I know I will," Steve grew more and more nervous, pressed his palm over his eyes, and curled more in himself. "And stop that."
The fourth and final time when Steve woke up was after 6 am, when it finally became orangish outside from the slowly rising sun. It was the most pleasant of all four times, and he woke up to a sweet smell and a warm baritone singing a song.
“Not the point,” Tony answered in an offended voice, but still made his way to Steve and sat on his lap, straddling the soldier. He put his head on Steve’s shoulder, efficiently blocking the way to the documents, just like a very stubborn cat. Steve allowed that and leaned to the back and wrapped hands around his husband, putting them at the small of Tony’s back. It was so comforting and they both took a deep breath, feeling as if it was the first one today.
Red Velvet huffed a delicate laugh out. They would have to work on Steve's knowledge of drag. "Maybe later. I will see you in the audience," she said, placing a sticky kiss from her lipstick on Steve's forehead and walking out from the changing room.
"Can you hurry up, please?! The guys from the Xavier's School will be here any minute to pick up the cupcakes for their students!"
"It's all hand made," Tony said proudly, showing Steve that with a bit of skill, you could take off the suits, and after some brushing with palm, the fur on the plushie cat was standing all fluffy and tall, just like on real Figaro. Figaro watched curiously the whole process and pawed at Tony's wrist, demanding to be showed the thing, and nosed at the fake cat playfully.
Red just smiled and sipped her sparkling wine, hearing the collective thought exchange about her boyfriend. Except for Bucky's half-hearted remarks, everything was positive.
"My house is the closest, let's go there," Bucky offered, seemingly placated by Tony's lack of hostility. Steve nodded and started walking, guiding Tony.
A sound of soft paws on the carpet, made Tony look through his fingers. Figaro, with his tail straight up, marched into the baby room, going to the source of the commotion, which was Peter. Even from the distance, Tony could see that their cat was angry.
Steve smiled, wide and, finally he could admit that, in love. “The second date,” he corrected, kissing Red Velvet’s pale hand. “And dress or no dress, it is still you.”
“That’s an overstatement,” Red Velvet scoffed, “I had coffee— wait, where are you going?” she asked, not understanding why Steve moved away when everything started to be so good and close and intimate.
"Okay, you are in my bakery now, so you either stop being a smartass and I will let you have another roll, or you can get your stuff and go home, you have an evening show," Sam gave Bucky a choice.
"H-hey!" Tony protested, trying to wriggle away, laughter taking over him too quickly. "Nonono hahahaha STEVE!"
That was cute. All those shared tickle moments were cute, but Steve never thought that they could be… hot. And intimate. He looked back at the gif, at the way the tickled man arched and bucked, but was not able to escape the ticklish strokes delivered over his skin. What if Tony was the one tied and spread in the chair and Steve was the one standing behind, dotting his fingertips over the bare torso, having that sense of power and control, enjoying the ticklish tremble of the bothered skin. It became a tempting image in his head.
"Yes, Tony," Sarah confirmed, meaningfully sliding a napkin closer to her son. "I bumped into him some time ago, and I asked him some more about skincare because the facial mask he recommended worked so well. Since then we stay in touch," she said and Steve could only listen and force his mouth to stay shut. He didn't know that Tony kept in touch with his mom. "It was his idea for me to start applying some makeup again and he recommended me a really good beautician and manicurist. My friends started to notice the change too, they say I look ten years younger," she laughed warmly.
"I understand that. Kids don't want to disappoint their parents," Red said, and Steve looked up curiously because once again, he saw in Red more Tony. He couldn't ask what was going on, because Red continued to speak and it was big news. "Maybe except my daughter. She is a pain and proud of it."
"I will. Will see you tomorrow, okay?" Steve said, leaning in for a proper kiss. "Bye gu- girls!" he called in general direction of the gathering, hearing a collective bye in return.
"Show me," Tony demanded instead, pushing Steve's hands away and cupping his chin, eyes sharp and analyzing while he was looking at his face. "Oh, yeah, much better. That hair was driving me crazy. Although, you could use a little more plucking on the left side."
“Well, there was this one guy— but it doesn’t matter,” Tony waved him off, not wanting to dwell on the topic. “I need to get ready for the show. Later, Loki!” she said, taking Steve’s hand and walking with him along the corridor. Steve followed, still feeling the calculating look on his back.
This situation was more complicated. What was worse, there was no simple solution. No amount of training could prepare him for this.
“I think that’s a sign,” Steve hummed, sipping his drink with a satisfied smile. Sam tried to be discreet and looked in the bar area, but the girl was already occupied with serving more drinks. The show was almost starting and she had to serve everyone before, not to interrupt her sister.
Tony stood there, not knowing what just happened. Did Steve just walked out of his life for good? No! Tony never wanted that, never. After the break up, he wanted them to be just like before, he wanted his best friend back.
Oh God! Steve's heart was sure to die of these sudden shocks he received tonight. Steve couldn't describe how he felt, no one had ever complimented his eyes before, a smile formed on his face.
Tony slowly moved away from the hug, it looked like he had calmed down. He felt so much better, after lifting those off his shoulders.
Tony looked toward Bucky and winked. " Of course, you too Barnes." Tony went near Bucky and whispered something to him, making Bucky blush.
Tony took a deep breath, he didn't want to start an argument with Steve. He wanted to talk this through like grownups adults.
The good looking guy sighed in relief. "Thank God! I seriously didn't wanna fight against you. So, can you loosen the grip a little. It's a bit awkward being in this position, especially as a guy. If you know what I mean." He tried moving but it was no use.
He glanced at them for a few seconds. The moment his eyes laid on the guy, he immediately knew who it was from afar. Steve stood there frozen. He felt a sharp pain in his heart, it was as if someone had ripped his heart open.
"As an apology, would you like to have coffee with me. I-I mean you don't have to it, it's okay to refuse. But, I thought maybe we could start again. I don't want there to be any misunderstanding between us, I don't want to be in bad terms with you. I've admired you for so long, this all feel like a dream to me. So please let me make this up to."
By the time, they reached there. Happy was already waiting for them in the car. They both got inside the car."Happy, pass me the first Aid Box"
"I feel the same way. I'll never forget you, I promise." There was something about the way Steve said that, it was almost as if he truly meant it. But Tony knew it wasn't, the only person who wasn't ever going leave him was himself.
"Anthony’s here is building his own robot. Like father like son. Day by day, Anthony never fails to surprise me." Howard proudly informed them.
When the smaller opened his mouth, both of their tongues fought for dominance. It was as if they were eating each other. Steve couldn't ignore the man's moaning between the kiss, God! It sounded so fucking hot.
A sudden thought came into Tony's mind, he couldn't help but ask Steve. "So, Rogers. Why is it that you prefer to be out here with me, instead of your girlfriend?"
"Tell me everything from the start." Steve said, for some weird reason he wanted to know everything, that was related to Tony.
"I-I'm so sorry, Pepper. I love you. I'm sorry" Tony's voice trembled. He covered his face with both of his hands, as more tears were dripping down his cheeks.
"I've missed you too, Tony" Rhodey replied. Tony had met James Rhodes, but he's known as Rhodey at the M.I.T when he was fifteen. Since then they'd been best friends. It's been thirteen years already and it felt like he's known Rhodey for a lifetime.
"-Steve! Hellooo" Tony called, snapping his fingers in front Steve's face to get his attention on him. Thankfully, it worked.
The doctor was beside Steve, already started doing a full checkout on Steve, he monitored and did some test on him. After receiving the test results of Steve, the doctor turned toward the king and queen.
"Iaccidentlybrokeintohishouse" Steve muttered fast. Even he couldn't understand a word that came out of his mouth.
Now that Tony was in front him, he'll never let him off sight. Steve's eyes met with Tony's, Steve immediately saw his eyes, it was full of fear and trepidation.
But, Pepper didn't let go of his arm, she was shaking in fear. She had to save Tony, no matter what. "Tony! Stop joking around! This is serious, please." She pleaded desperately, her voice was weak, it was almost as if she was about to cry.
Tony placed his hand on Bucky's shoulders. "Well, Bucky. I think everyone knows that, except you and Nat." Tony replied, giving Bucky a slight pat at the back.
Bucky felt betrayed by his best friend Steve. "How could've not told me something so important" Bucky asked. God, he was very dramatic. "Steve, why didn't you tell us? How though? Where exactly did u meet the Billionaire Tony Stark. Stevie" Bucky questioned him. Well, you can't blame him for being this curious.
The door opened, a young boy was standing there. "Dad, you've been in your room for the whole day, is everything al- Holy smokes! That's Tony Stark." The boy's eyes were glued to the painting with a huge smile.
If only there was a way for Steve to protect Tony, then he would, even if it meant having to put his own life on the line.
Oh dear lord! How did I forget that Bucky knew me inside out. He can't hide anything from Bucky, Steve had to admit he was terrible at lying, he just wasn't good at hiding things.
Pepper couldn't even process the things she just heard. She never thought there would be a day, where Tony Stark would compliment a man.
He couldn't helped  but thought how fucking gorgeous Tony looked. His perfect trimmed beard and those soft swollen lips. Tony was flawlessly beautiful.
Steve licked Tony's lips and kissed him passionately. His tongue explored every part of Tony's mouth. He wanted more. But, he could never take advantage of Tony when his vulnerable.
Bucky's eyes grew bigger, the TV remote dropped on the floor with a clack noise. "WHAT!" Bucky shouted. "Are you talking about the guy who gave you a CPR? The guy who paid for everything?"
Tony bowed, he greeted the king and queen. He apologized for his rude behaviour, even though no one blamed him.
Steve felt his face heat up, God! He knew he was blushing, as he imagined doing it with Tony. Steve never felt this way about anyone, other then Tony.
Bucky's body was paralyzed, the enemy had spiked his drink. How was he this careless? No! He didn't want to die. He can't, not yet. He had so much to achieve in life, this just can't be the end.
"Really! Well, I love Iron Man. I can give you millions of reason why he's the best character." Steve smirked.
"No way, you actually caught everything in tape. I've got my first kiss captured in tape." Tony walked toward the butler and took the camera. He saved the recordings with a smile.
Steve's heart ached, the pain was unbearable. But, not because of the fresh wound on his hand. But because of the thought of Tony being with someone else other then him, was awfully painful.
Tony's and Steve's parents were in the courtyard, when they witnessed Tony fall. Everything happened so quick, in front of their eyes.
"Tony Stark's first debut with 'Don't Let Me Go' is out now, here's a preview of the song. " The lady announced in the radio.
"It's finall, Anthony is staying with us. I'm the king, my rules. Plus, the castle is fillied security guards. He'd be much safer here. "
C'mon Steve, think about how you're gonna respond to that. After a minute of thinking, Steve finally managed to come to an conclusion.
"Ah, c'mon Nat, don't be like that. I know you're jealous 'cause you're man is my fan, Tony Stark's. I'm very lovable, don't you think?" Tony asked.
"N-o, don't get me wrong, Steve. I'm not laughing at you." Tony chuckled. " I thought it was kinda cute, I didn't expect you to be this adorable. You're such a gentleman, ladies must go crazy for you."
"Ah, I do appreciate the compliment, Stark. Especially, when it's from you." Steve Spoke in a flirtatious way, not that Tony would notice or maybe Steve just sucked at flirting. Not that matters it anway, Steve just wanted to have a friendly conversation with Tony, that's all.
The whole world was wrong about Tony Stark. Steve was ashamed, he had also thought of that about Tony too. But, never has he felt this good about being this wrong.
Steve had never felt this sudden possessiveness over anyone. He mindlessly stepped out of where he hid and walked to Tony. It was scary how his body moved on it's own, like he didn't have control over his own body.
