“Uh-huh,” Tony held a loaf of whole wheat bread at shoulder level.  “Am I replacing the punching bag again?”
Tony’s fingers tapped against the cover of the journal.  “It’s fixed,” he said, and she looked pale in the low light of the fire.  “Or as fixed as it can be, without the stolen part.”
“Please stop reading the Post,” Tony said, popping the top off of his bottle with a church key.  He held it out to Steve.  “Need to-”
Steve choked on a laugh.  “It wasn't-”  He turned, looking down at Sam.  “I just-  I think about it sometimes.  About what it would be like to be ordinary, to be nobody in particular.”  He spread his hands.  “To be normal and be able to get married to whoever I wanted, without it being a damn thing, Sam.”
“Is it our turn to watch you?” Phil asked, considering the cooling racks of cookies.  “I thought you were coming over tomorrow.”
“I think that things have been better since he got here, don’t you?” Peter asked, and he was so earnest, he nearly radiated it.  Tony stopped walking, and so did he, just about tripping over his own feet as he turned to face Tony.  “I just-”  He tucked his hands in his pockets, his shoulders flexing in something like a shrug.  “I think it’s been better.”  He blinked at Tony.  “Don’t you?”
"And protects the dragon from the world," he agreed, his voice soft.  "And that's-"
DJ considered the beaker.  “Better than sheets,” he said at last.
Tony leaned back into his seat, his hands folded over his stomach.  “Hello, Chefs of New York.  You’re bad at your job.”
“No.”  The lie came easily to his lips.
Tony stared at the ceiling, praying for patience.  “We didn't have sex.”
Tony was already turning away, still shaking his head.  “It's not going to work,” he said, and the smile on his face looked like a mask.  His eyes canted up to meet Steve's.  “You tense up every time I get near you, there's no way anyone's going to be convinced that we're actually intimate, Steve.”  His eyes closed.  “It's not going to-”
And she was gone.
“There.”
“So that someone can get a kiss, if they want a kiss,” Carol said with a smile.  She threw her hands out.  “We’re here for kisses!”
She didn’t seem convinced, but she nodded.  “Things’ll seem better in the morning.”
Probably pretty bad.  He took a deep breath.  "I want it known that I object to this," he said, and he was proud of himself for how steady his voice was.  "This is inefficiency at its worst, and you're the one who-"
Tony pried open one eye.  A blurry mass of brown and white was terrifyingly close to his face.  “Oh,” Tony said.  “Good morning?”
Tony poked it with one finger.  “Why?”
Clint gave him a high five, and tossed his bag next to the couch before he dropped down next to Darcy.  His feet landed on the coffee table with an audible thump.  “Going to Vegas, huh?”
“I reckon it will,” Steve said.  “So.  Patrols.”
Obie looked down the length of his nose at him.  “I’ve brought two dozen men from the factory and the warehouses,” he said, his voice flat.  “They’ve been stationed at the gates and around the grounds.”
Steve shook his head.  “I’ll go,” he said.
“Is that better or worse than your Commanding Officer?” Tony asked, watching his noodles cook with a suspicious glare.
“You did seem really, really drunk,” Alison said.
"Because I'm the only person who'll put up with your maudlin self for more than a few hours at a time," Sam said, and he was grinning as he said it.  He bumped his shoulder against Steve's.  "And even though you are a little self-destructive-"
“It’s food the way that the Trix are food,” Harris told him.  “It’s legally defined as ‘food.’”
“You were the one to bring Rogers into this,” Tony pointed out.  “I neither asked for, nor approved-”
“Sit down before you fall down,” she said, shoving him towards one of the chairs.  He went, too tired, too broken to care.  “You know, one of these days, you’re going to figure out that deliberately alienating the people who are trying to help you, who are capable of helping you, is not the best move.”
Steve grabbed a couple of plates from the shelf, setting them down on the kitchen table.  He filled them with thick slices of bread and chunks of cheese, half a roasted potato, still warm from the peddler on the corner, and the sweet rolls that he'd intended for his breakfast in the morning.  While he waited for the tea to boil, he grabbed a salami from the shelf, unwrapping it just far enough to cut a few thick rounds.
“That’s rich, coming from the fella who helped himself to the contents of my pockets,” Steve pointed out..
Steve didn't look up from his sketchbook. “Out here.” He dragged the tip of his pencil across the page, barely noticing the mark he'd left behind.
Stark looked at the discarded jacket.  “Isn't that one of yours?” he asked, his hands in his pockets.
“Take him to the kitchen, Mrs. Parker’ll have something for him to eat,” Tony said, his pulse thudding in his ears.  “I’ll get the car.”
Steve took a deep breath.  “I’ll just bet,” he said.
Steve didn’t look up.  “Is that so?” he asked, and Tony could hear the smile in his voice.  “I’m going to have to ask to see your ticket, then.”
“Yeah, but the Protestants just don’t have suffering down to an art the way the Catholics do,” Tony mused.  Steve gave him a look, and Tony smiled.  “You know I’m right.”
Clint slapped a nametag on his chest, and Tony looked down at it.  “The One and Only,” he read aloud.  “Great, that’s-”
Strange opened his mouth.  Closed it.  “Last Sunday or next Sunday?” he asked.
Why she was driving.
“Smart enough to use everything they got from me, yes.”  Tony bounced the wrench against his thigh.  “Fuck.  Pep, I need you to pull all the contracts, everything, we paid so much attention to the weaponry, we covered our asses so well with the weaponry, but there's so much that could come back to bite us.”
“I'll get you a to-go box.”
“I've been the poster boy for things before,” Steve said. “It's not so bad.”
“No.”  Steve handed him the cup.  “Want some tea?”
Marcy's lips twitched.  “Good. That makes things a lot easier.”  She took a deep breath, her shoulders rising beneath the sleek, well-tailored fabric of her suitjacket.  “I'm here because this will affect StarkIndustries.  This is absolutely something that needs the intervention of a PR team, because if we don't want this to blow up in everyone's face, then we're going to need to start spinning it, and we need to do it now.”
“Go to sleep,” Steve whispered back.  He waited, quiet and still, as Tony slipped back into the embrace of sleep.  His body relaxed by stages, the tension going out of his shoulders, out of his arms and legs.  The tension went out of his face last, his eyelashes fluttering against his cheeks and his lips going lax.  The sun was fully up now, the golden light of dawn sliding over his skin, gilding him, making him look like the renaissance paintings that had so enthralled Steve as a child.
There were an unfamiliar truck in the driveway now, and as Steve approached the kitchen door, a delivery man came out, his cap tucked under his arm, a sweet roll in one hand and a steaming tin cup in the other.  He gave the guard a nod, gripping the bun in his teeth as he put his cap on.
"My-  What?  No, it's not-  Wait.  And how could I have done that?” Stark wrenched a hand free and gave a shove at Thor's shoulder.  “Dear God, put me down, you great lummox, I shall not be manhandled in my own house.”
“What you’re afraid of.”
“I'm hiding,” Aimsbridge told him. “I can't believe I got talked into this.”
DJ gave a pleased nod.  There was dirt on his forehead, on the side of his jaw, his fingers caked with soil.  His feet were bare, and he left small, damp dirty footprints behind him on the slate.
The boy straightened his threadbare vest, his chin coming up with a smirk. "A right businessman, that's what I am, and you oughta respect that."
“When do you not?” Tony said, but he was already plowing forward, through the crowd, through the showers of confetti, and Steve followed behind him, just glad to be along for the ride.
Jan leaned over her shoulder, stabbing at the remains of the cupcake with her fork.  Ignoring Carol’s attempts at fending her off, she tucked it in her mouth.  “It’s Key Lime.”
Tony threw his hands in the air.  “This company is going straight to hell.”
“Very fast,” Tony said, and he sounded proud
Steve took the cup from him.  “Sorry,” he said.  He reached out with his free hand, his fingers hovering over the bandage.  “Are you-  Did I-”
"You know you're not actually my body man right?" Tony asked him.  Which was a shame.  It was a crying shame. Of course, if he had Rogers dressing him every morning, and undressing him every night, he wouldn't last the month.  Shaking off that lovely thought, he gave Rogers a wry smile.  "Or my nurse maid."
She considered that, then stole a potato off of Hank's plate.  “Never,” she said, with a bright smile.
The image of Steve down in front of him on one knee morphed into one of just Steve on his knees, and both of those were unacceptable, both of those would haunt his dreams in ways he didn't even want to contemplate.  Tony squeezed his eyes shut, struggling to breathe.  “No, that's fine, that's-”  He was not a child.  He'd been in love before, and it hadn't worked out then, either.  He could handle this.  He had been handling this, for weeks, for months, for years.
"Stay?" Tony repeated, stalling for time.
“I mean, I haven’t decided what I’m doing, but for now, DJ is here and when I figure out what I’m doing, I’m sure I’ll let you know, but that’s something I have to decide on my own,” Tony said.  He scowled down at the empty spaces on the chessboard.  “Where the hell have the rooks gone?  Were they even here to begin with?”  He crouched down, peering under the billiard table.  “Do you see them?”
And Steve should’ve been dead a dozen times by now.  A dozen, fifty, a hundred times by now.  He’d stopped waiting for the other shoe to fall.  If it was coming, then by god, let it come.
Steve ignored her.  “Watch the East side fire escape.  Widow and I have the West windows.”
“You would’ve heard, if there was.” Steve sounded faintly amused, and Tony realized he was smiling down at his feet.
May nodded.  “I’ll make sure he doesn’t head upstairs,” she said, her voice serene.  “If you can-”
“I’m sure she’d cover for you,” Steve said, trying to keep a straight face through that lie.
His breath whispered out of him, a last silent prayer to some unknown deity, and folded himself down and around, putting the bulk of his shoulder, of his chest, of his body, between DJ and the next shot.
Rhodey raised a hand.  "I could, too.  And I'm more likely to do so." He gave Tony a smile that was almost sympathetic, but there was steel under it.  "Let's not."
Steve nodded.  “Don't know who'd be laughing more at the idea of me trying to handle a teenager,” he said.  “My ma, or Bucky.”
Stark gave him a look, then leaned over to grab the large roll of paper.  Muttering to himself, he spread it out over a nearby table, spreading them out as far as he could.  Without thinking, Steve picked up a pool cue from the rack, using it to weigh down one end of the plans.  Stark tossed back the rest of the coffee before using the empty cup to brace the other end.  “Thank you,” he mumbled, already distracted.  “Jarvis, can you hand me the-” His hand fumbled in mid-air, grabbing for something that wasn't there.  “The-  The thing.”
Outside of the car, the scenery flashed past, brief glimpses of rolling hills and strands of trees, houses peeking through the fog.  Tony rested his hand against the window, his fingers curled into a fist.  “Time we may not have.”
Steve snapped his fingers in an exaggerated gesture.  “Aw, shucks.  Golly gee, Mr. Stark, sir, I knew we were forgetting something.”
Tony tossed the phone aside.  “I'm stealing my fucking plant back,” he said, stalking past
The room was empty, but still warm from the remains of the fire still smoldering in the hearth.  Steve reached for the lamp on the side table, not sure if Tony had finished the repair work on the light fixture.  DJ peered over the top of the tabletop, his fingers stroking over the green velvet.  Smiling, Steve picked up a ball from the rack, rolling it across the table towards DJ.  DJ caught it, rolling it back and forth between his hands.
"But you clearly have such excellent taste in colors," Steve said, dusting his hands off on his hips.  "How could I possibly do this without you?"
“Secretly,” DJ agreed.
Steve glanced up to find her smiling at him, her dark eyes crinkled at the corners.  “There we go,” she said, leaning in, as if she was imparting a secret.  “And just like that, this dance just became a lot easier.”
“The Steve Rogers who belongs here, who is not you,” Tony said, in a rush.  “You don’t belong here.”
Someone laughed, and Tony was going to have that person thrown to the wolves, or maybe he’d just skip the middleman and do it himself.  “What happened?  Where-”  He sucked in a breath and immediately regretted it.  “Where am I?”
“Which is why I called her,” Marcy said.  “We need to get our ducks in a row before things get even more out of control than they already are.”  She leaned forward.  “Captain Rogers, I apologize for this, I know we've just met, but I'm going to need to be very blunt.”
“He comes and goes as he pleases,” Steve said.  The meal was a simple one, cold roast chicken, thick slices of bread with cheese, and a variety of pickled vegetables.  But he was grateful for every bite.
Steve looked up as Carol poked her head around the row of lockers.  “We all okay over here?” she asked, her hands braced on the ends of the towel around her neck.  “Need us to duck back out?”
“The staff probably thinks we just set off some sort of explosive device in the middle of their convention,” Darcy shot back as Clint lead the way to the parking garage.  “And I don’t really blame them for thinking that, God, we are not going to be able to go back there, are we?”
Down on the street, a massive, gleaming black car was waiting, the chrome glinting in the sunlight.  A tall, lanky black man in a neat, crisp suit was waiting next to it, his arms crossed over his broad chest.  As they approached, he straightened up, reaching for the handle of the back door.  He eyed Steve, his dark eyes sharp beneath heavy brows.  "This our escort?" he asked Miss Potts.
“Christmas,” Tony agreed as DJ gave him the box.  “Oh, is this for me?  Excellent.  I approve of your color choices.  Very nice.  Still not distracting me from breakfast.  We’re going to have breakfast.”
Steve nodded.  “That the last one?”
Steve watched them over the top of his book, smiling to himself as Peter ducked under the flapping kite, guarding his head with his free arm.  Just a few steps behind, DJ made a grab for the tail, his fingers managing to brush up against the string before it slipped out of reach again.  Peter made a hard turn, playing out the string, and the kite went crashing to the lawn.  DJ followed it, laughing as he collapsed onto the grass.
“King of Kites!” Stark declared, swinging his dowel wildly above his head.
"It has been a difficult morning, sir," Jarvis told him, opening the door to the bathroom.  “I shall ready your shaving kit.”
Sam slapped him on the back and immediately poured on the speed.  “Never going to happen.”
“I have an asbestos lined digestive system,” Clint said with a proud grin.
“Because it calls their attention down on you,” his mother said.  She took a sip from her spoon, her eyes narrowed.  “And no good comes of that.”
She braced a hand on her hip, her head tipped to the side.  “We are, which is why I know you have a big mouth.”
“I’ll pay you a hundred dollars,” Pepper said, and Peter stopped dead.
He leaned over to collect the blanket, and a small red notebook from the hearth.  “Have you even lit this fire since you were assigned this room?”
“Six months?” he asked, with a winning smile.  “A year, max.  Just enough time for me to hide in the workshop, have a nervous breakdown, and channel a great deal of sexual tension into revolutionizing at least one American industry.”
“Are we perhaps avoiding a difficult conversation with Mr. Stark?” she asked.
Steve huffed out a breath.  "You know, I figured you'd be high maintenance when you were sick, but this wasn't what I had in mind."
"I cannot believe that you-"
“If they were having sex in here I deserve to know!” Jess said, latching on to the side of the lockers.  “Because we were told WE couldn’t have sex in here, it’s not fair if Greer is bringing in her boytoys, this is just-”
Tony stared at him.  "That's stupid."
“We've offered him a place on the reserve roster,” Steve said.
He snorted.  “No, you haven’t.”
“What's to set up?” Tony asked.  “Steal a sheet from the laundry room, ask that damn cook of ours to wrap a few sandwiches in butcher paper, grab some bottles of soda from the icebox.  He can run around and you can, I don't know, what did my father do when we did this?”  he scrubbed a hand through his hair, trying to remember if his father had ever shown up for the picnics his mother had thrown on the back lawn from time to time.  “Read the newspaper?”
“She’s waiting for us at your place.  Let's go."
“You aren’t kidding.”  Gleeful, Jess flicked through the threads, her grin only getting bigger with each page.  “Oh.  My.  God.”
“No,” Jarvis said, and it was unusually blunt for him.
Tony set his cup back on its saucer.  “Yes,” he said, and that was freeing, all of it was freeing, he hated this room and he hated sitting here listening to the clock tick and waiting for something to happen, something that he couldn’t even define.  DJ grabbed his hand and Tony snagged the glass of juice before it ended up all over the carpet, which he also hated.  “Yes, we can.  Kitchen.  Let’s go.”
Jarvis nodded.  “Ah, is it?”
“That won’t be necessary.” Tony picked up the envelope, catching a glimpse of her understated name tag.  “Monique, is it?”
“You bled everywhere,” Pepper said, blunt about it.  “You owe Rhodey a new suit.”
“Nope,” Steve said.  He hooked a thumb over his shoulder.  “I’m going to go check the grounds.”
Tony leaned against the counter.  “I’m not good at patience,” he said.
Steve caught his wrist.  “Not in the middle of the damn lawn,” he said, as much for himself as for Tony, because Tony had a way of making him forget things.  Like where they were.  Or who he was.  Or what he was supposed to be doing.
Tony was standing in front of the hearth, a few pages held in one hand.  Jarvis was standing by the vestibule, his back ramrod straight, his face expressionless.
“It was-” Tony spread his hands wide.  “It was always your fault that he couldn't have a dog, May, that was one hundred percent on you.”
“Hi, welcome to Maaagicon!” the girl said.  “Did you pre-register?”
“Billy,” Steve started, just as Seamus said, “Oh, is she the reason why you're dressed all fancy?”
“Thank you, that’s terrifying to hear,” Tony said.  He looked at Harris.  “I blame you for this.”
“Festive eating contest?” Jess tried, and Greer was laughing into her folded arm and Carol was just grinning as she dug through the menu files.
Luke held out a hand.  “C'mon, then.”  His teeth flashed in a broad smile.  “I taught Danny to dance, I can teach you.”
“I would’ve disowned you if you had,” Darcy said.  “Waste of chocolate.  We would not have been able to be friends anymore.”  They followed the flow of people into the cafeteria.  She peered into the fridge case.  “Oooh, there’s fruit cup today!.”
DJ’s mouth worked, and he looked up at Steve.  “Too much noise,” he said.  His throat worked.  “Want to go.  Away.”
Shawn wrapped his arm around Drew’s shoulders.  “Let me rephrase,” he said, bright and chipper.  “Let’s get salads!”
“Okay, that’s…  That’s not the problem?”
Steve chuckled.  “I imagine so,” he said, as Jarvis moved away from the bed, Tony’s shoes dangling from his fingers.  He set the shoes down by the wardrobe, and continued on to the linen closet.  Steve lowered himself, sitting down on the edge of the bed, his fingers lingering on Tony’s hair.
Fury nodded.  “You know how it comes to this,” he said, leaning back in his chair, his hands folded against his stomach.  “You, more than anyone else in this room, knows how it comes to this.”
"Because he's going to do it anyway and it gives you something to complain about," Steve said.
“What, no dessert?” Pepper said.
"I have work to do," he said to Pepper, who rolled her eyes, her lips curled in an affectionate smile.
"I'm-" Fine, he wanted to say, but it was such an obvious lie that he didn't bother.
Steve laughed.  “I have to work with what I've got, Stark.”  He turned down the heat on the soup pot and wiped his hands on a dish towel.  “Seriously, though.  How're you feeling?”
"My reaction was similar but a bit more..."  Tony made a considering noise under his breath.  "Slightly more spicy."
“Know.” DJ dragged a stool away from the counter and boosted himself onto it.  “Working.”
Tony made a scoffing sound.  “Lacks protein, Steve.”  He ducked into the fridge again.  “We have turkey?  A couple of kinds of cheese, not much swiss left, though, I was looking forward to swiss.”  He leaned back, his eyebrows arching.  “Do you want the swiss?  Cause if you do-”
Bobbi’s head twitched in something like a nod.  “Right,” she said.  “What are the chances?”
Tony snapped his watch shut and returned it to his pocket.  “But yes.  He fixed it.”
“I know a diner-” Steve started.
“Hello,” DJ said, and the cat opened one golden-orange eye, considering him.  The tip of its tail snapped out and back, and it closed its eye again.
"You can bring those with you, and after lunch, I think I have something you might enjoy," Jarvis said, offering DJ his hand.  "Would you like to help Mrs. Parker and I?"
“It is Tuesday,” Wang said, walking past with his arms full of orchid plants.  The flowers swung on their spindly stalks, and an odd, discordant music floated behind them as he disappeared through the door on the other side of the hall.
“Yes,” Stephen said, with a wry smile.  “I saw him.  I spoke to him.  He’s about as happy about the situation as you are, but he’s fine.”
DJ smiled.  “I… Think it’s more natural?  Than the city?”
Steve’s hand fell away from Tony as he took a step back, as if the physical distance could end the conversation.  “No orphanage in the city’d let a single cop adopt a kid,” he said, his voice tight.
“I plan on ignoring them,” Tony said.  “Which takes some work, with Barton, and a lot of work with Thor, but-”  He nodded.  “Just you and me and a lot of background noise.”
“Is he-” Steve stopped, his throat working, and Tony glanced at Strange.
He broke into a run, legs chewing up the distance, taking the stairs two and three at a time.  In a matter of seconds, he was reaching out, catching Tony’s arm, and even that felt like an eternity.  “You shouldn’t be out here.”
Steve paused, confused, but the elderly lady next to him made a scoffing noise under her breath.  “It wouldn’t open,” she said, slamming her ladle against the side of the kettle.  She scowled up at Tony as she slapped the cover back in place.  “Too sunny today.  I need it to work.”
“You’re out late,” he said, shifting his bag higher on his shoulder, the comforting weight of the shield bouncing against his side.  “Everything all right?”
Rhodes gave him a wave.  “Remember, if you get lost, all roads lead back to the fountain in the square.  Eventually.”
“Yeah, I mean-” Franklin shrugged again, his shoulders hunching up around his ears.  “I guess.”
And then Tony was pulling free of his grasp, stumbling as he tried to find his footing.  Steve reached out, grabbing his shirt and pulling him back to his feet.  “Are you all right?”
Steve gave a little chuckle, and he leaned back, bracing his hands behind him on the bed.  “It’s stupid.”
“Oh, God,” Pepper said, snatching the page from his fingers.  “Will you please-”
He ducked his head, his lips ghosting over Steve's throat, and Steve made a sound that was straight out of his hottest dreams. “Now,” he whispered against Steve's jaw, “if you want to spend the next hour making out back here, that's just fine with me.” His eyes flicked up to meet Steve's. “Really. That's just fine.”
There was a plate of cookies on the table between them, next to the tea pot.  It hadn’t been there before.  Or maybe it had.  He didn’t remember.  There was a cookie on her saucer, next to her tea cup, and that definitely hadn’t been there before.
“As you might have guessed, Officer Rogers does not approve of this,”  Jarvis said.  “But as he’s had little success in convincing sir to remain safely under guard, he’s changed tactics and is now attempting to persuade sir that perhaps allowing DJ access to, well....”
“This particular caller is on the 'do not send to voice mail or you will regret it' list,” Jarvis said. He sounded tired. “Pick up the phone, sir.”
“I walked into that, didn't I?”
Steve pretended to consider that.  “Well, generally, ‘the side that isn’t against the wall’ is always going to be my favorite,” he admitted, and Tony ducked his head.  Steve smiled at him.  “I know you’re laughing.”
“Indeed,” Jarvis said, utterly unruffled.  “Officer Rogers, this is Mrs. Parker, the housekeeper.  Mrs. Parker, Officer Rogers.”
“And he's just your type,” Pepper said.
“We might’ve spilled a little,” Peter admitted.  He was almost as wet as DJ, dragging the mop behind him.  “Sorry, Aunt May.”
“I'll work on that,” Steve said, stroking his hair.  He could feel Tony's breath against the hollow of his navel, hot through the fabric of his shirt.  “What do you need?”
The customs officer stopped, his mouth drawing up in a tight little knot.  He stared at Tony over the top of his half-moon glasses, his eyes dark slits.  Then, he switched his basilisk gaze to Steve.  "Purpose of visit?" he repeated, the tip of his pen tapping out a quick, almost frantic, rhythm against the paper of his form.
“After last night's bath adventure, I think I'm clean enough,” Tony said, turning off the water and reaching for a towel.
Tony grinned, his head lolling to the side.  “Morning,” he said.  “In the morning.”  He fumbled at the waistband of his pants, and before Steve could stop him, he shoved his jeans down.  As he was sitting on them, it wasn't particularly effective.
She nodded.  "Yes."
He reached out, his fingers brushing DJ’s hair away from his eyes.  “Except when it’s you.”  He smiled.  “I want to understand you, and this-” He leaned back in his chair, gesturing at the table.  “I thought, maybe this would help.”
“Thank you.”
Tony took a deep breath, and put his phone away.  “The jet’s being fueled up and checked now, by the time we get to the airport, it’ll be ready to go.”  He pointed at Clint.  “Guess who’s driving.”
Tony bit back the urge to say something dark and angry and horrible.  "What are you doing out of bed?" he asked instead.  "You should be-"
“Yes,” DJ said, confident now.
“I mean, want a tail?  They have robotic ones that swing when you press a button, Harris is trying to figure out how they work, and-”
“I can’t even blame you,” Happy said.
As Steve watched, his pulse thudding in his ears, Tony reached out and tossed another log into the flames, shadows playing along the sharp planes of his face as he poked it into place.  He drew one leg up, leaning his forearm against the curve of his knee, and the fabric of the shirt shifted against his skin, dipping into the angle of his shoulder, the arch of his back.  He was beautiful and graceful and unearthly, untouched or untroubled by the cinders that floated past him like falling stars.
“She's good, but she's not that good,” Pepper said.  She sounded amused.  Tony took that as a positive sign.
DJ nodded, but his fingers no longer had a death grip on his shirt.  “Hate change.”
“You could choke one of them until he went unconscious,” Clint said.  Nat gave him a look.  “Well, you could.”
“I’ll take your word for it,” Bruce said.  “Can you hand me the-  Yes, that.”
“Yes, and we both know that he has never, since I turned him on, done what he was supposed to do.”  Tony watched as Dummy shoved stacks of boxes across the workshop floor into a corner, and then rolled towards the door.  “He’s not usually so…  Single minded.  And the team doesn’t usually work this hard to find him things to do.  So what the hell’s going on?”
“I’ll do my best,” he repeated back at her, just to make her laugh.  Because if she was laughing it couldn’t be that bad.  He held onto that, that warm and easy sound of her laughter.  “Just.”  He stopped.  “I’m fine.”
“Do the rest of us get any?” Tony asked.
DJ’s fingers plucked at the cap of the water bottle.  His eyes darted towards Harris.  “Can I borrow a shirt?” he asked, his voice soft.
Steve's eyes slid from one to the other, not really sure if he should be saying something.  “I should just-”
“Just…  Give us a minute?”
“Right,” Tony said, and he sounded resigned.  Steve bit his lip to keep from laughing.  “Wait.” His eyes slid in Steve’s direction.  “I got into the bath tub in my tux.”
Steve blinked at him.  “The doc?”
“DJ is more impressionable than I am,” Peter objected, dodging out of reach of DJ’s hands.
“Well, I walked over to the sidelines, and I got my phone out of my bag and I texted her, ‘I’m free on Tuesday,’ and I can see her, I can still see her, and she stops.  Pulls out her phone.  Looks at it.  Texts me back.” She nodded, her expression serious.  “And it was a single letter.  ‘K.’”
DJ gave him a look.  “You’re going to fight.  Otherwise, why can’t I listen?”
It wasn't much, just the smallest little rumble of sound.  It wasn't offensive.  It was almost cute.  But it sure as hell didn't come from him.
Tony waited.  There was nothing else forthcoming.  “No?” he repeated, his lips twitching.
“Get your own jar,” Clint said, but he handed it over anyway.  “And yeah.  He seems dedicated.  To what, who knows?  But something.”
“Ask him out,” Steve parroted.  “Make a move.  Tell him that I-”  He stopped, and struggled to smile.  “I might be in love with him.”
Ellen squinted down at her phone, her other arm wrapped around her bag. She hipchecked the front door of the lobby open, ducking around a few guys from the financial pages and nodding at John the security guy. He waved back.
Nebula didn’t look up from her design work.  “Yeah,” she said, her voice emotionless.  “That’s what we do here.  We’re a tattoo shop.  That’s what it says on the sign.”
Tony glanced up, struggling to make his eyes focus.  “Seems prudent,” he said, trying for a smile as Obie slipped into his office, closing his door behind him.  “Did Pepper-”
Tony’s face flushed.  “Get out,” he said.
The bottle rattled against the glass shelf of the fridge as he tossed it back in, grabbing a plastic bottle of water instead.  He kicked the fridge door shut.  “Look, we’re all dying, Pepper, and yeah, probably I’m doing it at a slightly faster pace than most of the people in New York, because, well, the super hero thing, but in my defense-”
“I love you, too, but I know your ‘time for a discussion’ face and it’s my least favorite face you make,” Tony pointed out.  “Can we just-”
"Well, it appears that assumptions were made about our mode of dress and our participating in the local festivities," Steve mused.  He stacked his hands behind his neck.  "And while I was trying to unravel the situation and get us a room with, you know, two beds, you found the hot tub and decided you were going to live there.  Then proceeded to climb in fully dressed."  Steve paused.  "At that point, moving you seemed like more trouble than it was really worth."
“I’d object, but…”
He surged to his feet.  “You can’t just make a meat based dish into a vegetarian one by taking out the meat.  You can’t make a gluten free dish by removing the wheat.  That’s, that’s like, taking a size two dress and thinking it’ll still look fine if you just, make it bigger.  It’s not going to look fine, it’s an insult to the designer, AND the person trying to wear the dress.”
Tony grinned.  “I really like your hair.”
Steve braced his sketchbook against his knee. “That sounds like the loneliest experience I can imagine,” he said. I mean, what's movies, what's the theater, other than finding the human heart of a story? To laugh at the same time as the fella next to you, to see a girl crying real tears over a pretend person?”
The staffer paused.  “Uh-”
"When did you start dating?"
“Hey, now,” Tony started, and Steve chuckled, his chest aching.
“Who invited you?” Jan asked, but Sam was already sprinting out of the kitchen, leaving a trail of coffee on the floor behind him.  Jan glared at the door.  “I suppose he can be trusted.”  Her eyes slid back to Steve as she collected her plate and cup from the table. “I take it Tony doesn't know you're down here asking about this?”
Before Steve could come up with anything else to say, the door to the lobby opened.  Steve glanced over as one of the security guards, a stout, broad shouldered woman with a no-nonsense scowl started towards them.  He straightened up, hoping to head her off.  "Morning," he said, with a smile.  "I've got this, thank you-"
“Everything's going to be fine!” he said, and he considered getting Phil on the comm, because it sounded so much more comforting when Phil said it.  It actually sounded believable when Phil said it.  “Callie.  Everything is going to be-”
“No, he doesn’t,” Happy laughed.  “But it’s funny to watch.”
DJ smiled.  “Yes.”
He slid out of the saddle, glad for the break, as short as it might be.  The street was a narrow little lane of narrow little shops, half of which seemed to be closed already.  He gave one dusty shop window a look.  Or maybe never opened anymore.
"Should've gone to the gym," Jan said with a smirk.  "But yes.  Everyone's got something."  She took the glasses out of Steve's hand and flipped them open.  "Tony spent his formative years at MIT.  He's got a thing for boys in glasses."  She slipped the glasses onto Steve's face.  "Ta-da!"
Carol licked the tines of the fork, her eyes canting up towards the ceiling as she considered that.  “Maybe?”
Steve froze, his chest going tight.  “Very few people hit their children once.”
“That's just the fried chicken talking,” Steve told her with a grin.  The waffle maker timer went off, and he straightened up.  “And as nice as you seem, I've got a boyfriend.”
“Oh my God,” Greer said.
“I missed seeing your eyes,” Steve said, which was true.
On the end of the bed, the cat stood and stretched, its back arching as it yawned.  Tony squinted at it.  “You have a cat?” he asked.
“What would I do with that?” he asked.  “I mean.”  He grinned.  “Can you imagine me getting a posy, Steve?”
“It's not your worst look,” Pepper said.  “Hat.”
“You need to get past the job title, fella, nobody does what they get paid for around here,” Happy said.
Harris stared at him.  “And…  A t-shirt helps?”
“Yes, of course.”  Strange smiled at him, and DJ smiled back.  “We have a visitor today, but I think-”
Steve paused, considering that.  The journey along the length of the countryside had been slow, almost random in the roads they had taken.  The others had let him choose the route, let him piece together what he could from fractured memories.
“That better not affect how you draw my six-pack,” Sam said.  He hooked a foot into the strap of Steve's bag.  “Wanna go hit something?”
“Oh?” Steve repeated.
Tony knew he was waiting for a reply.  “I know.” He forced the words out from lips that didn’t want to move.  He tried to smile.  “Thank you, sir.”
Jess looked down at the plate, and then back at Greer.  “I mean, it can’t hurt, can it?” she asked with a hopeful smile.  She gave the desserts a little wiggle.  “Chocolate makes everything better.”
“I absolutely did, and you drank half a cup of soap yesterday.”
Steve adjusted the tie. “It's perfect. Thank you.” He held out his hand. “Steve Rogers.”
"Not in the mood," she said, and Tony switched gears with the speed and precision of a Formula One driver.
Darcy took it from him with a gleeful chortle.  “Benito, you are a prince among men, you are a man of kindness and virtue, and your holiday bonus shall be obscene this year.”
“Yeah, but you can’t outflank everything,” Tony said.  He lifted one hand, and Jarvis, attuned to his every move, his every gesture, began building the holograms up again.  Light crested around his fingers like waves, forming itself into numbers, into words that barely made sense to Steve.  He’d feel bad about that, but he was pretty sure that they didn’t make sense to anyone other than Tony, a scientific shorthand that he shared with his AIs.  “Here’s a question for you.  Is the lighthouse useless, just because it can’t go out to sea to fetch the ship?”
DJ smiled back up at him.  “Hello, not-dad.”
There were still a few rose petals stuck in his hair, and Steve beckoned him closer.  “I booked the room with the passport and credit cards from a cover identity,” he said, as Tony stepped up next to him.  Steve slid his fingers through Tony's hair, coaxing the bruised petals free. “No one cares about Roger Grant and his inebriated spouse.”
“Not in the least, but if you had said we hadn’t, I would’ve cried.  Straight up cried,” Tony said.  He looked across the kitchen floor.  Bruce was still scrubbing away at his station.  “I think he’s sleep cleaning.  Is sleep cleaning a thing?  Like sleep walking but instead of wandering off, he’s just bleaching the hell out of a six inch square of his station.”
“And that’s just further proof that you have not read my file,” Phil told her with a wry smile.
A sigh.  “Do not be foolish.”  And something like the clearing of a throat that didn't exist.  “He needs you.”
-Seven Years Earlier-
“Hello,” Tony said, holding out a hand.  “Have we met?”
T’Challa started peeling the pear.  “Do not make me send you home in shame,” he said to Shuri, his voice teasing.  She stuck her tongue out at him, and, laughing, he went back to the fruit.  “I’m sure our mother told you what was expected of you.”
“And I’ve never been prouder of my spawn than I am at this exact moment,” Tony said.
Pepper's voice cut through it, cut through everything.  Pepper.  Calm and steady and real.  Pepper.  His head came up, and she was there, swimming through his vision, slowly coming into focus.  She was pale, her freckles bright on the white background of her skin, but she was steady, she was real.
He made a show of patting his pockets.  "I was assured that speculation about my love life would distract everyone from my actual output for at least six months, so I didn't bother-"
Clint considered that.  “No,” he said, shaking his head.  “I absolutely can't.”
He had no idea what was happening and that wasn’t new and that wasn’t something that even bothered him anymore.  Behind him, he heard Happy singing at the top of his lungs as he laid a man out with a haymaker of a right hook.  “Who’s next?” he howled, just as a man behind him pulled a gun from the pocket of his coat.
“Thaaaaaank you,” Shawn said.  He looked at Drew.  “Want a salad?”
“Good job,” Harris said, deadpan, and Drew nodded, taking that as his due.
“Well, kids that age have a hollow limb or two,” Steve said.
She smiled at them, her big dark eyes gleaming.  Tony was pretty sure there was glitter in her eyeshadow, along the long sweep of her lashes.  "You'll both be fine," she said, even as she gave them a critical once over.  They must've passed muster, because she gave a glance at her watch.  "The guests should be-"
DJ snagged his bag, shifting it up to his shoulder.  It settled into place, a familiar, comforting weight against his back.  “Lasagna’s good,” he offered.
“Oh, dammit,” Steve said, his stomach bottoming out.  Six missed calls.  All from the same number.  He scrambled for his own phone, Tony's tumbling back to the counter.  “Dammit, dammit, dammit.  The alarm.  Of course, that's why-”
Just a minor warning for a tough conversation about parenting, and some mind control in a non-harmful situation.
He took Tony’s hand.  “Promise me you’ll try to stay alive.”
All of a sudden, he was feeling very lucky indeed.
He gave Steve a faint, warm smile.  "We could, of course, make up a room for you in the servant's quarters.  However, that would not be available to occupy immediately, there is a great deal of cleaning and moving of furniture that would be required before that would-"
The sauce was a perfect balance of salty and sweet, the rich taste of the oil cutting the acidic tang of the tomatoes.  Tony let his eyes fall shut as he savored the taste, the notes of basil and oregano, garlic and onion.  His eyes drifted open, and he found Steve staring at him, his cheeks pink from the heat of the stove.  Tony licked his lips, and then, for good measure, reached out to run a finger along the back of the spoon.  "I'll set the table," he said, and tucked his finger into his mouth, sucking it clean with a grin.
One second.  Two.  Three.  Then, Peter said, “Ow?”
“Technically, I’d done that before you,” Steve admitted.  He go his pants zipped and didn’t bother to button them.  He looked up, and Tony was staring at him, his mouth hanging open.  “Peggy,” he said.  “Staff car.”
Greer gave him a wave, gesturing at the couch next to her, and Steve headed in her direction.  She took the paper towels from him, tossing them to Bruce, who looked like his mu shu pancake hadn’t been up to his appetite.  “Here,” Greer said, clearing the seat next to her.
Once upon a time, there was a prince, who was lost and forgotten.  Once upon a time, there was a prince who had forgotten.  Once upon a time, there was a prince, who was seeking his way back home.
Wanda looked up at him.  “Does he?” she asked, her eyebrows arching.  DJ nodded, and she smiled.  “Do you?”  Before he could say anything, she leaned forward, one hand coming up.  A flicker of ruby light curled around her fingertips, and DJ watched it, mesmerized.  Her lips moved, slowly, carefully.  “What are you?” she whispered, and the light filled DJ’s vision, blanking out the rest of the world.  “Down.  To your core.  What.  Are you?”
She arched an eyebrow at him.  “Do you think I would've come down here and said we couldn't do anything unless I'd already confirmed that with legal?” she asked, her voice tart, and Tony caught himself smiling.
Steve looked at it, sensing ruin, sensing chaos.  “But?”
“He’s fine,” Carol agreed with a grin.  “The armor took a beating, and so did his pride, but-”
DJ’s stomach bottomed out in an instant.
The doorknob turned before he could even reach for it, the door swinging open, just an inch or two, before creaking to a stop.  DJ peered through the crack of the door.  “Hello?” he called.  The single word echoed, rattling around the room in a way that made goosebumps break out along the length of his arms.  DJ’s fingers slid across the wood of the door.  It was strangely warm.
Tony sipped his coffee, trying not to think about how hot his face felt.  "Yes," he said.
Steve paused.  “I’m not sure that diners in Jersey are the hill I want to die on,” he mused.
Steve nodded.  “You aren’t what I expected,” he said.
His lips quirked up in a slight smile. "I got married," he said, his eyebrows arching. "That's about as public record as you can get. It was going to come out."
“That's brilliant,” Clint said.  He sounded stunned.  “I gotta try that.”
“Of course, sir.  My only concern is your well being and safety, not to mention your happiness,” Jarvis said, and if Tony could’ve gotten a hand free, he would’ve thrown a pillow at him.  “Do ring if you need more coffee, I should be happy to return with another pot once you’ve-”  His eyebrows rose and fell, a slight, puckish smile on his face.  “Handled your breakfast.”
“We have a small vermin problem at the moment,” Strange said, his voice brisk.
“Yes,” Tony said, biting off the word.  “Oh.”
The cat yawned, showing off a massive maw lined with sharp, white teeth.
"Then you will get no dessert," Jarvis said, his voice crisp.
“Wonderful,” Tony said.
Tony rocked back in his seat.  “So.  You guys.  You keep doing what you’re doing, we’re good.  You’ve got a hard job and ninety-nine percent of you are rocking it every step of the way, I’m proud of you, because, honestly?  Honestly?” He tossed a hand up in a half-shrug.  “Sometimes, you just have to go to Olive Garden.”
“It is Agent Coulson’s,” Jarvis said.  “Dummy is assisting him with some filing.”
“Not really, Tony, can you-”
Steve took a deep breath.  “We drink a lot of milk,” he said.
“FUCKERS,” he yelled.  “Looking down your nose at someone who wants you to change your so-called fucking art, but then, the moment you have to feed someone with a lift-threatening allergy, or a dietary requirement, and you’re just annoyed by the entire thing.  You’re just-”
“We didn’t give him alcohol,” Rhodey said into his fingers.
“So I can protect him.  I have the position and the power and the resources,” she said, her voice soft, barely above a whisper.  “Or I can speak out against this.  I can use all of that to protect the ones who aren't as lucky as he is.  Who don't have anyone to speak for them.  The most vulnerable ones, the ones they're going to come for first.”
“She said she was fine with it,” Clint said to Natasha.
He wanted coffee so bad he could cheerfully have killed someone.
Before he could follow, Jan reached out, bracing  a hand in the middle of Tony’s chest.  He paused, watching as Hank disappeared up the stairs.  Only when he disappeared through the door on top did Tony look back at Jan.  “What?” he asked, his head tipping forward.
“And she still loves you best,” Tony said.  “Just…  In case she brings that up.”
“Someone’s been listening to podcasts again,” Tony said,  he waved at DJ and waited for him to cut the connection before he turned to face Steve.  “Haven’t you?”
“Tony?” Bruce tapped his book against his leg.  “No.”
Steve ducked his head down, focusing on his cufflinks, and trying to get his heartbeat back under control.  "Luckily, that's not something I have to worry about," he said.
Darcy had procured a blanket from somewhere and was now curled into a comfortable looking fabric burrito.  “Let’s see it, Jane.  What’d you get?”
“I'm thinking a basic engraved one hundred pound linen stock,” she said.  “I like the texture, and anything more just makes it look like you're trying too hard, honestly.”
But by the time she'd turned her head, she'd found the gap between the workbenches empty.
“You're the worst,” he said, but she'd already hung up on him, which was fine, it was easier to get the last word if no one was listening any more.
He needed a drink.  A very strong one.
Tony looked at Jarvis, who was wiping the condensation from the pitcher of water.  “Your luck held,” he said, setting it down.  He arched an eyebrow at Tony.  “The same could not be said for your jacket.”
He opened one eye, displeased by the sound.  The side of his face was plastered up against the tile of the shower.  Which was horribly undignified, but in his defense, this thing had like six showerheads and he might end up drowning, but he was going to drown happy.
“Oh, thank you, always so sweet, you are,” Mrs. Parker said.  She paused, letting DJ drop the last few Marbles into the jar.  “Thank you, dear.”  She straightened up. “Peter, are you going down to the garden?  Why don't you take DJ with you.”
“Steve.”
Steve blinked slowly into full consciousness.  His head was throbbing, and for a second, he considered rolling back over and putting his pillow over his head.  But whoever was knocking on the door, they were polite, but persistent.  Steve got the feeling that they could outlast him.
Billy gestured at the orphanage.  “His office.  As far as I can tell, he ain’t moved.”
“Can we not discuss this?” Steve asked.  He was slumped on the couch, his head thrown back, one arm draped over his eyes.
“It’s Phil,” Natasha said, rubbing a hand up and down his back.
“Your phone's ringing again.”
Tony reached over, refilling Steve's cup from the pot before his own.  “Any idea what happened to my sunglasses?”
In the years he’d been gone, the city had stretched out across the landscape, houses and buildings and roads spreading out into what had been farmland.  There were still fields there, beyond the city walls, vast stretches of orchards and deep, ancient forest stretching away from the road.  Every turn in the road, he found himself looking for an old farmhouse, or a manor tucked back beyond the trees, well away from the flow of traffic.  And in some way, out of the flow of time as well.
Steve wasn't naked, either, but he was almost painfully attractive, all long limbs and broad shoulders and narrow hips.  His shirt was raked up around his chest, exposing the musculature of his stomach.
“You need a new job,” Fury told him.
He checked on DJ first, opening the connecting door between their rooms as quietly as he could manage.  The room was still and warm, and the curtains had been drawn back at the windows, letting moonlight spill across the floor.  DJ was sound asleep, curled in a ball against the headboard, his legs drawn up against his chest, one arm wrapped tight around his pillow.  His other hand was stretched out across the bed, his fingertips just brushing up against Furbro, sleeping in a furry pile next to his pillow. DJ didn't stir, even when the hinges of the door creaked, but the cat's head came up, one ear twitching.
Fury was considering the tray of sandwiches.  “Anyone eating this?” he asked, reaching for one.  He glanced around the table, waiting for each of them to shake their heads before he picked it up.  “Nothing but radio silence,” he said.  “Not pleased, but also not surprised.”
“Excellent, get right on that, but first.”  He strode across the room, his head up.  “Jarvis.  Can we run a scan here, because I think my entire team appears to have been replaced by pod people or life model decoys or-” He pointed at Bruce.  “Banner.  Really, I expected this from Cage and Danvers, but you?  You?”
“Yes,” Val said.  She tugged on her father’s hand.  “Let’s go see if I can figure out the rules to his card game without asking him!”
Another nod.  And then, carefully, “Right.”
Laughing, Steve flipped DJ’s hood over his head.  “On New York streets?  Your father would kill us both.”
“I mean, maybe so,” Happy said.  He sipped his tea.  “Don’t think so, though.  I think he’s gettin’ paranoid about how things are going at court.  Every time I drive him to the capitol, he’s tense as a scalded cat the whole way back.  And then, next thing you know, the Acolytes are down from the church again, building up the wards.”
Tony’s eyebrows arched.  “Considering how long it took them to realize that,” he mused, “then I have to question if they’ve actually been paying attention.”
Steve gave them both a generous serving of sauce and reached for the Parmesan cheese.  “It's bottled sauce and refrigerated pasta, Stark, it's not really anything special.”
Steve snagged his shield out of midair, swinging it back into place.  “Not now,” he gritted out, as he ducked under a punch, countering with a body blow to the solid center of the mobster’s mass.  He twisted, tossing the limp form aside, and turned to meet the next attack.
Tony gave him a look.  "That's your only problem with this movie?"
"Be fair," Tony said.  "Some of them are Clint."
Steve was still for an instant, looking at Tony and then the cup, and then back at Tony.  Tony just sat there, the cup extended to him.  He arched an eyebrow.  “Not to play on your sympathies,” he said, with a slight smile, “but this is my injured side, and it’s starting to remind me of that.”
“Did you wonder why DJ didn’t tell you that he was coming to Stephen for lessons?”
“Look at this.” Jesse held the camera out to Ellen. “He looks like he's been filibustering congress over health care for children for twelve hours. Exhausted and frustrated, but resolute. Stoic.”
“Understandable, sir, but your agreement with DJ was that eight am was an acceptable time for presents.  As such, he has been sitting beside the tree very patiently for the past two hours.”
Tony set the cat on the floor.  “I'd be better if I had some coffee,” he said, his tone wheedling.
“Janet,” Jessica and Luke said in perfect tandem.
Harris gave him a look.  “You sent him the wedding picture of Darcy and Clint, didn’t you?
The usher nodded.  “Yes, Mr. Stark.”  Seemingly happy to be given a task he could accomplish, the boy darted back out, letting the door shut softly behind him.
“Miss Van Dyne,” Jarvis announced from the door.
He wandered up the nearest aisle, studying the cases that lined the sparsely filled shelves.  “I thought we burned everything associated with this project,” he said, scowling at the names printed on the tags.  “I absolutely remember remember serving a burn notice on this.”  He yanked the nearest case off the shelf, and flipped it open.  “This looks distinctly unburnt.”
“Also you’re not driving,” Iron Man called after them, and Clint flipped him off without even looking back.  Iron Man chuckled.  “Yeah, that’s a Barton.  It’s comforting that some things never change.”  His head swung towards Tony.  “You want to give us a minute?”
Tony didn't have an answer for him.  And he was starting to suspect that was going to be a problem.
DJ leaned in, staying close to the stove, his arms folded and his hands tucked against his chest.  Steve moved around him, filling the kettle and setting it on top of the range.  "C'mon, I'll get you some bread and cheese."  DJ's eyes flicked in his direction, but he turned his attention back to the stove, never moving from his chosen spot.
“No alarms,” Steve told him.  He unbuckled Tony's seat belt and slipped an arm around his back.  “Here we go.”  He boosted Tony out, trying to set him on his feet, but Tony slumped against his chest, his face buried in Steve's shoulder.  Steve smoothed a hand over his hair.  “Yeah, I think you're going to be sleeping in tomorrow.”
Tony sighed.  “Not really,” he admitted, his eyes half hidden behind the dark sweep of his lashes.  “You’ve drawn everyone in the household except me.”
DJ leaned into his touch, his eyes fluttering shut.  “Thank,” he said, with a sweet little smile.  Steve smiled back at him, loving him so much that it was a physical ache.
"How much can I feed to the tiny disaster area?" Tony asked Jarvis, gesturing in DJ's direction.
“I know you don’t think that-”
“And I don’t want-” Shuri started, but Okoye was already sliding out of her saddle, sighing in relief as her feet hit the road.
“Yes, and when we find it, we'll hit it with our van,” Tony said, and this time, he was sure that was a laugh.  He smiled, some of the strain going out of his shoulders.  “What's the point of having a hobo van if you can't use it to run over all of your troubles?”
Steve had never envied a teenager as much in his life.  Partially for the pure joy on the kid's face, the complete embracing of who he was and what that meant, and partially because he could kiss Tony so easily, without even thinking about it.  Without having to consider what that meant, what Tony would think it meant.
With his toolbox in one hand and the bread Mrs. Arbogast had given him in the other, he considered the long trek back to the manor house.  It wasn’t particularly appealing, and it’d be safer to eat before he set foot back onto the main grounds.
“DJ is down with Mrs. Parker, having lunch,” Jarvis said.  “Your plans are beneath the table.  Your gloves are in your back pocket.”
“Oh,” Tony said, and Steve let his eyes close.  He was strangely at peace with whatever was going to happen now.  Whatever happened, whatever Tony was about to do, about to say, he was prepared for it.
“I used the app,” she said, deliberately vague, and when she chose to be vague, there was always a reason.  “Women don’t like ‘dying,’ Harris.”
“He does,” Happy said.  “Otherwise, you wouldn’t still be here.”  He pulled up to the gate, and an unfamiliar man appeared on the other side of the wrought iron bars.  Happy gave him a wave, and the man nodded, unlatching the gates.
“I don’t allow analog solutions in my vicinity, if you’re going to do that, you’re going to have to do it somewhere else, somewhere where I’m not,” he said.
Behind him, a stick snapped, and Bucky was on his feet, knife in his hand, so fast that Steve didn’t even see him move.  From the woods, Sam’s voice called.  “Just me.  Put it away.”
Rogers' cheeks were pink, but his expression was almost amused.  “There are three bullet holes in the walls of your office,” he said.
“Yeah, that can happen,” he said, his fingers closing around an emergency glowstick.  “Close your eyes, I want to see what we're working with here.”
She took it from him.  “It might as well have been a second skin and that shirt's not much better,” she said, frowning at his chest.  “Jarvis!”
“You may have a point on that one,” Tony said.  He scooped up the box.  “And none of it matters, Hank.  None of it matters because I fixed his watch, and sent him on his way.  We’ll never see him again.”  He gave Hank a bright smile.  “Just.  The way.  We want it.”
Trip leaned back in her chair, bracing one foot on the half open drawer as a slim form slipped past the blonde and into the lobby.  The man in the suit let the door swing shut.  “It’s nice,” he said, his voice encouraging, and the other person, clad in an oversized maroon sweatshirt and jeans, just nodded.
“We're sure,” Pepper said.
Tony stared at him, his eyes wide.  “You’re… Fast,” he said.  He glanced down to the street below, and back up at Steve. “You’re very fast.”
There was a rather large gauze pad taped firmly into place on the back of his shoulder.  He twisted his head to the side, squinting at the edges.  “Right,” he said, because the pain had quickly faded to just one more throbbing ache.  “Right.  I can’t…”  He scraped a hand over his face.  “Coffee.”
Steve slipped past him.  “Sir, I-”
“You'd think after this many years, you'd know what sarcasm sounds like.”  Tony snatched a towel from the rack.  “Call Rhodey, please.”
Steve stopped.  “And…  This is the problem,” he said.
Steve caught himself smiling.  "I had heard that."  He glanced at his watch out of the corner of his eye.  "You're late."
“Want to put money on that?  Because I’m willing to put money on it.”  Tony ducked under the counter, digging out his toolkit from behind a pile of ruined clockworks.  “Five’ll get you ten that the next time you see him, he’ll be in uniform, and that’s a whole other mess for us to deal with.”
“It wasn’t that bad,” Steve told her, trying not to smile.
He flipped it open, thumbing through the pages, his fingers  moving just as fast as his feet.   Something fell out, fluttering behind him, and he didn’t care, he didn’t care about any of it, he knew what he was looking for and that wasn’t it.  Emergency numbers and schedules and staff listings and floor hours.  Contacts with the hotel and the union and the city.  Copies of contracts and permission forms, the rules and lists of places to eat.
His head turned, and for an instant, he was lost, he was adrift, his weight shifting on legs that didn’t want to support him any longer.  His eyes closed.  “You’re not my ex,” he said, his voice aching.  “You’re not my mother, or my assistant, you’re not-” He forced his head up.  “You’re not ANYTHING. So get out.”
He turned towards the door.  “I’ll bring up breakfast soon.  Do try to get some rest while you can.  If we have any contact from the kidnappers, we will let you know.”
“I love that she thinks anything is going to help at this point,” Tony said to Rhodey, who cupped a hand over his mouth, trying to hide a smile.  But Tony knew him too well by this point to fall for it.  He flopped out on the couch, not caring about his shoes on the upholstery, and rubbed the bridge of his nose with stiff fingers.  “Pep.  Nothing other than an extended coma is going to help.”
Tony grinned down at his notes.  “You don't like ANY of my exes.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” May said.  “You’re not going to kill him, and neither is Mr. Jarvis, gun or no.”
“It’s not working,” Steve said.  “Buck-”  Bucky turned big, sad eyes in his direction, and anything Steve had been thinking of saying evaporated in an instant.  He sighed.  “Don’t cry.”
“And it turns out that your ‘emergency’ is a bunch of tailors, and no one was interested in listening to me when I told them that I didn’t need a suit and didn’t want a suit and this is-” He gestured at Tony with the bacon.  “What is this?”
Natasha didn’t move from the workshop doorway, one hand braced on the frame, her face set.  “What happened?” she repeated.
Tony's hand fell back to his side.  "Peter."
“Is that even possible?” Tony asked.
Tony gave him a look.  “Not helping,” he sing-songed, and shut the door.  He was fairly certain he heard Jarvis chuckling on the other side of the panel.  Rolling his eyes, he headed back to the bed, twirling the stem of the blossom between his fingers.
Tony shook his head.  “Anyone ever tell you that you’re an ass, Barton?”
“How did you FIND me?” Tony asked.
“That is the truest thing you've ever said, on so many levels,” Tony said.
“You appear to be having a breakdown, which is more Pepper's wheelhouse than mine, but, okay.”  Tony heard Rhodey take a seat, and he knew just where he was and what he was doing, because those kitchen chairs of his always creaked.  “Tony.  Did you have any sort of discussion?  Were you drunk, or-”
“Fair enough.” The young man smiled, and Steve’s mouth was dry, and he didn’t know why.  “This is Mr. Pym, the proprietor of this fine establishment,” he said, gesturing at the clockmaker, who didn’t acknowledge the comment.  “I’m Tony, his ever humble apprentice..” Pym let out a laugh that was almost a bark, and Tony smiled.  “And I’ll be fixing your watch today.”
Steve smiled into the kiss, leaning his chest into Tony’s hands.  “They do come off, you know”
Jess put the empty plate back in reach.  “I’m going to die,” she said.  “But I’m going to die happy.”  On the stool next to her, Carol was munching her way through a pile of rice and toppings, her eyes half closed. “Thank god I’m not paying for all this.”
“Dunno, I stopped reading after the title.”  Ellen leaned forward to pick up the printout.  “'A listing of SHIELD personnel which have gotten married in the last six months.'”  She stared at it for a long moment.  “Fury does not give a shit, does he?”
Tony slumped a little lower in his chair, rubbing his forehead.  “Clearly, you haven’t been reading my press clippings.”  His lips twisted in a wry smile.  “Or you’d know better.”
"I expected nothing less."  Tony grabbed his arm.  "Come on.  Let's find out where everyone's going."
Strange’s cape floated around his legs, refusing to settle, even after its master went still.  “Nothing,” he said, with a slight, strained smile.  “I’m sorry.  Clea is working in my stead even now, so we don’t lose ground.  But as of right now?”
"You are," Steve said.  It should not have been amusing, but somehow, it was.
“Then fuck ‘em,” Tony said with a grin. “Order yourself whatever the hell you want and put it on the company card, Pep.”
“He'll be there.  Tony-”
“Apparently the competent one, who knows how to check his voice mail,” the other Strange replied.
“It's cute that you think that,” Tony said, trying to shoo him away.  “Get off, he has information.  I want it.”
“I get it, it terrified me too, you know?”
“He doesn’t like me” Steve said. There was sad on his eyes and for a moment Sam could see the shadow of a different time and a different fear.
Well it last less that what Tony had hope.
“Tony?” all Steve’s fears were appearing
Ouh. He had all planned, a cheesy relationship and a big dramatic break up. Steve would acuse him to be too needy and vain and everybody will say that they see it coming
“Ouu, yes, I am just...” Steve tried “there is this thing, and about the, ham... maybe you are thinking about it”
“Well, everytime that we fight we ended destroying half of the Academy and achievement nothing”
“Why you would want this instead of something perfect?” Tony asked
“what?”
“kisses, sir?” sound the voice of the A.I.
“Excuse me?”
“What? A gift? That is not fair Captain, I am the billionare I should cover you on gifts”
“OH MY GOD LOOK THE TIME! IHadAProyectRunningInTheLab, better go. BYE SUNSHINE!”
“Do you need something?” Tony asked after an awkward silence.
Well maybe he had some problems.
“I don’t like to lie” Steve exclaim mad “but if we ever date for real I will never let you go”
A knock on the door.
“Sir, Mr Rogers is arrived. Do you want me to make him wait until you would be ready?” JARVIS voice sound over the speakers.
Steve’s blue eyes look at Tony’s and the genius felt it, he would not be able to hide nothing any more.
“Sir? Do you want me to provide assistant?” JARVIS asked.
“Oh you should be happy Steve” Bucky said dramatically  moving his arm over Steve’s shoulder “You are our lider, and you had found the most powerful feeling on the world, we are so proud of the blessing that the stars...”
“Do you…” Steve said trying to get himself courage, but on an instant Tony was on his arms.
“Thank you, this is…”
Steve hold Tony’s hand.
“Steve, Darling” Tony said “Just a moment, I get caught in the middle of things and I lose the time on stupid projects, I’m sorry, I’m…”
Bucky and Sam laughed when his face went red.
“What?”
Steve and Tony kept the fake dating. Even one of them had more problems lying that the other.
“Well, I don't blame you, Captain” America spoke “It looks like your new boyfriend had you ocupate”
“Well… but he agree, it is not a no”
So… the day of the dance, Tony was understandable nervous. Not, it wasn’t understandable. It was a nightmare. He change the suit two times, even when Steve and him had agree on them, he had clean his shoes and wash his hair and made a robot and trashed his room because he couldn’t find the cologne that Steve’s like it.
“It’s fine” Tony dismissed it “That is the reason why its work”
“I don't know that”
What Tony want? Steve wished he know.
“You better don’t be mean to me Cap, for now on people had to believe that I actually like you”
“Steve” The boy said friendly “Tony adores you, you two only need time. And that is exactly what you are going to had. Or not?”
The Cap looked at his so called boyfriend; Tony looks small hugging his arm, his smile was soft and his appearance perfectly produced for photographs; but in the deep of his eyes Steve could see the underlying anger.
He had lost himself on his own thoughts.
“What is going on?” Steve said firmly.
“It’s nothing” Tony said quickly “You just surprised me, Cap”
“Did you?”
“what?”
- this is fine- Steve kept repeated to himself. he has the right to enjoy the life sometimes isn’t he? Maybe Tony wasn’t complete lying, maybe if they continued doing this things Tony will get used to it, maybe they could be something real -be as clear as you can-
“I hate the suits”
“Hey, is everything okay?”  Steve asked waking Tony up from his thoughts.
Oh no.
“Tony”
Steve break the contact, and found the big brown eyes looking at him with stars inside them.
“We need to talk” Steve whispered on his ear.
There was a extended pause.
“Yes, I know I’m being cheese, and I know you hate been with me all the time; so, when you would yell at me after the dance everyone is going to believed our break up, Steven”
