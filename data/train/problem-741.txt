He whimpers and moans, moving his head to kiss him. “Feels good..” he blushes. “You can.. you can grind against me too..”
We have taken to crossing off the days on the calendar until you get home which also helps her know you’re coming back.
"I hope so.." Anthea smiles. She goes over to the table and shows him all the pieces of the veil they're working on fixing. "Hello, dear." Mrs. Hudson smiles at him as she sits at the table fixing the veil.
I'm sorry if you have been waiting for a new chapter of this fic since there will not be one coming. This is the end and I'm sorry.  Thank you so much for reading <3
Mel eases her fingers out and leans in, licking up her cunt. “Mm so wet.” She mumbles and presses her face deeper, sliding her tongue over and around her clit before pushing it into her.
“Whenever you’d like.” Sherlock nods and brings up the pictures, laughing as he looks at them before handing his phone to John.
Mycroft chuckles, softly. "It's been a very, *very* long time since anyone not related to me has wanted that." He murmured.
"I'm retired." George chuckles, rolling out from under the car. "This is what retired people do. Work." He grins cheekily and looks up at him.
Sherlock hums and sits in his chair, picking up his mug to warm his hands. “You’re good, Dr. Watson. Be sure to bill me for after hours.”
She gasps as she sinks all the way down onto his cock, just sitting on it letting the head press against her cervix.
"Well, if I had known, it might have been something we could have worked on earlier." John explains as he picks up his wine and takes a test sip.
He leans in to kiss him softly again. “Shall I take you back inside or do you want to have fun out here?”
Myropis nods. “Who with?” He asks as he steps forward and places Kia on the bed between all their bellies.
“I had a formal witch education. I was the top of each course. But then when I discovered I could make up my own spells and sigils it was like a whole new world.” Margaret smiles.
"Even better if you do step down that doesn't mean it has to be over. You can consult and lecture and advise. It's up to you, Crofty. You just need to find what makes you happiest."
He smiles and takes the feather off of him. He waits a moment and then twirls the feather over his nipple.
Sitting by one of the slot machines, just barely out of view of the security cameras, sits a black cat with grey eyes.
“Mycroft never did play around with such matters.” Magdala sighs. “You need the blood of the one who murdered her. Whoever wanted her dead. You need that blood for the ritual. A few drops on her collected ashes should be enough.” She nods and goes to one of her book shelves, pulling down texts.
Jean rolls over so he's on his back and Michael is on top of him. "Take me." He moans and begs breathlessly.
Dorian reaches down and sinks his fingers into Sherlock’s hair. “Suck my cock.” He smirks and pulls his head towards his trouser covered cock by his hair.
He whimpers softly, his body desperately trying to take an interest in Greg's words. "Nn.. Don' talk like that.. I can't come again.."
Sky moans as she gags hard, getting close to vomiting in his cock. ‘You’re going to make me make a mess in your cock.’ She whimpers, a puddle of her drippings under her.
"I think that would be best, yes." John and Greg follow as Sherlock and Mycroft go into the sitting room.
John nods. “One,” he says, poking Sherlock’s nose. “Two and three.” He adds, poking the left and right of Sherlock’s stomach. “You’re carrying twins.”
John scoffs at his own ridiculousness. “Well in fairness, you shot her back. I mean, technically you're even.” But despite himself, he glances back to make sure there’s no nurses nearby to tell him off, before he kicks off his shoes and crawls up onto the bed. Keeping a careful eye on Sherlock’s drip, and various wires attached to him, he wraps his arm over Sherlock’s stomach and sighs as he nudges his lips to Sherlocks neck and gives him a peck. “I never thought you’d be a cuddler, you know. Not until last night. I like it.”
"I warned you about getting attached," Mycroft drawls, "it can only lead to distraction and disappointment." He takes a breath before saying, "I'll let you know when it's done."
"Fish and chips?" Harry asks. When Joann nods she releases her hand. "John you and mum head back. I'll wait for my mates and we'll pick up food on our way. Take mum for a walk, we'll be there as soon as we can."
"This thing." She points to her head. "It makes me dangerous. When my mind sense I'm in extreme danger it overrides my control and protects me at all costs. When I escaped India I didn't just run away. My master wouldn't have let me leave. I.. I killed him.." She can't bring herself to look at him and just stares at her gloves hands.
John’s heart drops. He dreads that Sherlock is unhappy with what he sees. “I know. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said anything.” He drops his hand, sitting back slightly, suddenly regretting how much he’s said. “Being here at Baker Street, being your friend is more important than anything else. I… don’t need to… that is, if you forgive me for my faults, that is enough for me.” He can’t disguise the disappointment dripping from his voice, even though a part of him means it. He can let go of all the other feelings swirling inside of him so long as he can remain here with Sherlock, like it used to be.
"The couch is perfect for me. It doesn't get quiet so it's hard to sleep anywhere really." She shrugs.
Mycroft sighs. "I hate feeling out of control." He admitted. "Except.... except when I give over to you." He mused, thoughtfully.
Sky moans and nods the best she can as she sucks his cock. ‘Alright good. It was a lot for Brent today. Tell Michael to treat him gently. He’s had a rough life.’ She hums in his head, swallowing him down her throat.
He groans and arches, leaking steadily into his pants knowing he’s making a wet patch but he just can’t help himself.
Sky kisses his neck and jaw. "I'll be good. I'll be so good for you, Sir." She purrs as she strokes him over his trousers.
"Yes, Sherlock. God, yes. Anything you want.." John gets up to get lube. He comes back to find Sherlock writhing in his chair. "You gorgeously filthy little thing. How long have you wanted us to fuck in that chair?"
Sherlock gasps and gently runs his fingertips over the triangle, “it’s so beautiful. John, I love it.” He whispers, tears in his eyes.
She frowns and nods. "Lydia is going to be very cross with me.." She sighs as she holds a piece of the veil between her finger tips.
Sky stops for a second and goes left down a path instead of following them to the right. "Fuck.." She says softly, seeing a tiger coming down the path slowly.
"I told you no holding back from me. Never hold back." She nips at his jaw. "Want do you what?" She grids against him.
“I’m not going anywhere, you prat.” John chuckles softly. He knows that he should feel scared or maybe a bit apprehensive but it’s Sherlock.
Sherlock kisses him back. "Thank you, John.." He clutches his sheet as he sits up. "I think I'll go have a lie down while you're out."
She nods. 'I couldn't sleep last night. He couldn't either. We talked about some dark shit. Then we baked. I don't know how but we make it work.' She shrugs.
Also, with daily updates feel free to subscribe or just check here often. I wont be posting links daily on Twitter. I'm feeling exceptionally lazy. I'll probably post a link once a week or so, but beyond that, I'm old and tired. Save me a few copies and pastes please ;)
"Hate to burst your bubble, but you've always been the reason I've stayed. You've always been my reason. You're worth everything and more."
He bites and sucks on his throat as he strokes him. “Mm you’ve got such a nice big cock.” He groans as he squeezes him, having to use two hands to get his length.
Camille smiles sadly. “Are you happy, that he adopted you? A vampire, and not a human?” She asks softly. “You’re the first I’ve heard of a vampire adopting a human.” She explains. “If more vampires wish to do it, I would want to aid them.”
“Mm I know. You would have loved it.” She smirks and stands. “Maybe there’s a better way to work this off. How about we go out and you pick strangers off the street to fuck me?” She smirks.
Carol moans and arches against his face as she presses harder on his throat while Sherlock sucks his cock.
Mycroft stays silent, nodding to John slightly. He doesn't trust his voice at the moment, knowing that he will blow up at Sky if he speaks.
Sherlock thought for a moment. "I'll be there by mid morning. The train takes two hours." He said. He'd use the credit card he'd pilfered from Mycroft.
Sherlock blushes and moans loudly. "Oh Christ.." He whimpers and holds onto John as he rocks his hips. "Spank me when he comes up, John.."
“I’d think not since he’s going to land on her. Oh there they go.” Sherlock frowns, watching the man crumple onto his partner.
Nina bites her lip. “I ate as much as I could but I got to full. I couldn’t eat all of it. I’m sorry..”
John smiles. “Is there anything that can be given to her? In gratitude to what she does?” He asks. “I want to make sure that every ghost knows people think about them, will care for them.” He explains.
‘It’s okay, love. Everything is okay. I promise.’ Turk whispers in his head, knowing Sky would hear him.
"I.. I don't know.. I don't think so. I think you get attached to people that mean a lot to you. You have a connection with them and then get attached. Everyone's pace is different."
“No. Just never found anyone I liked enough to want to have sex with them. Or who liked me enough to stay to get to that point. Except you.” Sherlock whispered, his face nearly the colour of the brake lights on the road.
"Shit, I completely forgot it was this weekend. You're supposed to be with Sherlock this weekend." He scratched his chin as he tried to think, "I hope he doesn't mind that you've basically got plans for this weekend...you should call him and ask him to volunteer." It goes completely over his head that he might need to be a volunteer too.
“You’re going to have to do better than that. Go home, think about what you’ve done. Realise that most don’t get a lifeline like I’m giving you. So take it and run. Sherlock, John, take Greg home.” Camille orders, “I need to speak with Mycroft and Anthea.”
We've danced around this for years now. When I lost you, I nearly killed myself (not a phrase here. I stared down the barrel of my pistol more than once.) because I thought I'd never get a chance to tell you how I felt. Then Mary came along, and she... well, she gave me Rosie, if nothing else. Not wasted time, I suppose, Rosie is perfect and I wouldn't trade her for anything in the world.
"You've completely lost you mind. There's no way you could know anything about my glove. My glove is.. Oh god my glove is torn.." He looks at his glove with a slit in it.
“Yeah. Apparently Nina has never been to a zoo. They were worried about her ability though. They think it might be a little overwhelming for her to hear all those animals.”
“You are such a good boy. Now come for Daddy.” He snaps his hips over and over, ramming his prostate and leaving his cock untouched.
“If there’s anything you desperately want, then tell me, and I can change it up to the eighth month mark.” John explains.
“Oh yes.” Sky moans as she feels him stretching her cervix wider. “At this point the babies will just slip out.”
“What?” Sherlock mumbles, strewn out on his bed, with a needle still in his arm and his shirt sleeve pushed up. He thought he heard someone calling him but he knew he was alone. He is always alone. Alone protected him. It never left him. Especially not for some woman. A woman that got pregnant before they were even married.
Sherlock sighs and wraps his arms around Camille, after putting his drink down. “I’m so sorry, I- I always thought, in the... the stories, he loved humanity. He loved humans and Gods wanted to punish him for it.” Sherlock says sadly. “But I love you Sire.”
"I was worried you had forgotten about me.. and I.. I'm sorry about snapping at one of the guys you were with."
Sherlock blushes. "Thank you, sir. That's what I wanted.. I'm here for your pleasure.. You always feel so good when you're in my arse.. Make me feel so full.." He whimpers and squirms slightly as he feels John's come running down his leg.
He frowns and looks up. He doesn't want to talk now because he knows Sky will hear them. He also knows that she could hear his thoughts if she wanted to. He doesn't like it when she does it to him but she does anyway.
"Such a good little slut for me. Such a nice tight arse for my huge cock. Mm I'm going to fuck you till you scream my name. Till you're so full of my cum it doesn't stop pouring out of you." He growls and pounds into him, ramming his prostate over and over.
'We were fated to meet. He and I. I've known him since I was little. I could always hear him in my head even though I never met him.' She blushes.
A nurse comes in and puts Sky into a hospital gown, starting an IV before leaving. Sky hold out her broken hand to John. "He's one of Sebastian's men.." She mutters quietly.
Mycroft smirks and walks toward him. He pushes him over the table, pressing his erection against Greg's arse.
“Mmhmm. As much and as many times as you want.” She purrs and takes off her vest dropping it to the floor, her clothes soon following it.
John smiles softly and shrugs. “Mum took us to church every Sunday and then I came to do services since I was an altar boy. We hung out in churches a lot. Harry never liked it since she could see.. Things.” He hums.
“John.” John smiles. “I like that name. I think it suits what I look like don’t you?” He asks. He goes to the back of the cave and gets a large furry coat. “We can just talk for tonight, then tomorrow we’ll go to my home, the following night we’ll have to do our jobs.” He explains.
"Maybe because they aren't born into a world of submission?" John theorizes, glancing up from the papers to his mate. "Children learn from their parents actions as much as they do from spoken word. And good God, are you saying our children will be bolder and louder than
“I want whatever will make you happy. Going to let the girls get your pregnant?” Greg chuckles softly and rubs her flat belly.
Sky cries out and comes hard around him and the cucumber. Violet moans as Sky’s fist trembles inside her.
She nods. "There might be more but I can't sense it yet. Just two at the moment." She takes his hand and presses it to her belly, knowing he can feel the distinct energies.
Sky smiles and nuzzles him. "Mm hello, Death." Yuki smiles softly. "Life, busy as usual." Sky smiles softly. "It's a good thing you come for us all in the end." Yuki hums, their special coded greeting.
“Tell me more about that time. At the convention.” Crystal asks shyly, wanting to know more about their history.
“You are my child. And by extension so was he. But you had to protect yourself.” Camille rubs his leg.
"I would like to be informed of all tickle fights from now on so I may participate in them." Sherlock smiles and crawls into bed with Mycroft.
“That would be good. Hopefully Sherlock hasn’t hurt himself trying to get to Mycroft’s room.” John sighs.
He kisses his head and nuzzles him. He tilts Greg head up to look at him and he lean in, kissing him softly.
A few minutes after Sherlock leaves, a large, burly man slides into the compartment and sits next to John. He is bald, with tattoos covering his hands and neck. “His kind isn’t welcome.” He says to John with a deep, Romanian accent. “You have an hour to find a flight back and then we will kill him.”
Sherlock picks up John's wallet that is on the floor and brings it to him. He starts to eat his food, starving.
“And if I disagree with the judgements? If anyone does? Will we be punished for voicing those opinions?” Crystal looks to Camille.
"He so much more than that. Than an abuser." She bites her lip. "I'd even go as far as saying he's the antichrist." She laughs dryly.
He growls and rocks his hips, still inside her arse. "Mm, I wonder if you could take both of us in your cunt. Have us both pushed past your cervix."
Mycroft smiles and rolls off Magdala, he gets out of bed and goes upstairs to Sherlock’s room, wanting to check on him.
“Good. Now I want you to close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Nice and relaxing.” Greg smiles softly, pumping three fingers into themselves.
He blushes. “Want Daddy and Sir to use my mouth how they see fit. For whoever. Put a vibrator in my arse and leave the cage on so I can’t come.”
Greg smiles, taking Mycroft’s hand in his. He was a little nervous and very excited. This was a huge step for them, going away together and having so much one on one time.
He isn’t going to wear the hat, it didn’t suit his attire, and he needs to keep a low profile and dress according if he doesn’t want people snooping around his life and finding out his a vampire.
Mycroft hums, “that button there. You press it and it alerts one of my workers that you need assistance. They will come to find me and I will come to help you.” He says pointing to a small red button on the headboard.
Collin strokes him and licks the head of his cock. "Mm look at him. Look how badly he wants to taste you." John hums and adds another finger, moving them slowly.
“Harry hasn’t spoken to me since I asked her to leave Rosie’s third birthday when she showed up plastered.” Sherlock hums. “Best to stay away I think.”
Sherlock smiles all the way through customs. He had booked them seat in first class, so he puts their bags away above their heads before letting John sit down first. “Have you ever flown first class before?” He asks.
"So good, baby. It perfect." Bryan nips and sucks on her lips. "What the hell is going on here?" Cynthia asks as she walks into the cafe.
Sherlock smirks. “Did it to help pay my way through Uni. I still do it every now and then when I’m low on cash.”
“Oh John,” Sherlock calls, “when you get to the club. Keep your head down and say Mycroft’s name to everyone who comes within earshot.” He warns.
Sherlock sighs and nods. “I was using him for support.” He frowns. “Oi Brother.” Sherlock shouts. “I need you to help me get back to bed.”
Sherlock can feel the tips of his ears heating up again. "Jesus..." He breathes. Microscope slides weren't toys... but if he could feast upon different honeys drizzled over John's cock... his breathing hitches.
She moans loudly around Bryan's cock, feeling so full. She whimpers knowing John is watching her be used like a whore.
“The broach has been taken off you. And yes, Sherlock is going through your things to find anything else that could constitute as... hunting gear.” Mycroft explains calmly, he sits back down and and holds his glass in his long fingers.
Mycroft rubs Camille’s shoulder softly. “I’m sorry sire.” He says sadly. “Is there no way of getting your soul back? We have many humans that are willing to die for you as well as vampires and multiple resources.” He says softly.
"You smell a bit like Sherlock," John whispers, "They'll like you a lot more than they'll like her."
Sherlock exhales sharply before taking a deep breath in, he closes his eyes and think about the warm feeling he gets when he drinks from John, as if his body is glowing. It’s the only time he feels warm these days, and he will never forget it in a hurry.
Mycroft blushes and hesitates. "I.. I don't want you to wear a condom.. Please, John?" He signs, his face a bit hopeful and worried.
“Christ!” John yelps, not having expected the video. His phone slipped out of his hand as he hastily tried to close it and it landed right in his pint glass. “Oh for fuck sakes..” he pulls it out dripping wet but it doesn’t turn back on.
Greg's eyes widen, his fear showing through clearly. "You bastard!" He throws his coffee at him, spilling in onto his face and chest before running out of the cafe to go to the car in a panic. He finally sees Sky freaking out and Mycroft trying to remain calm for her. "He.. He took him, Myc.. Myc, I.."
"He made sure that they treated me fairly in the academy. He saved my arse on some occasions. He uh.. He also let me stay at his place after my last boyfriend.."
"What do you want, John? Do you want me to bow to your will? Do you want me to challenge you? Anything you want I'll give to you." He moans and ruts against him.
"Mm biological changes after a male Omega's pregnancy are not uncommon. Your whole body changes, the testosterone you naturally make all but vanishes during pregnancy. I can't imagine it was easy."
She smiles softly and cups his face. "You are perfect. And I love you so much." She kisses him softly. 'I denied the drinks because I'm pregnant. They saw you and nearly pissed themselves. Apologizing for trying to 'make a move on another man's pregnant wife'.'
He sighs and frowns. "I'm sorry.. I just... I hate it when you put yourself through things like this.."
“I mean if you haven’t been involved in at least one cult orgy you haven’t really lived.” Diōnē laughs.
Rosie and I both miss you. London misses you. We can’t wait until you get back. Of course, Rosie will remember you. You’re her father. There’s no way she wouldn’t remember you. I play her videos of you all the time so she can see you and hear your voice.
John braces himself for the chaos in the next room. When he enters he sees Harry and her beta daughter Jo (named after her mother) arguing about something. John just smiles at that. The other two girls, Alice and Genna, Omega and Alpha respectfully, are sitting at the table helping Joann frost the cake. Alice is a near spitting image of Harriot, while Genna has the Holmes's eyes and nose.  Mycroft raises an eyebrow at John, then looks towards the stairs.
“Yeah but there’s really none of my own things in it yet. Most of my stuff is stuck at my Dad’s house.” She shrugs and frowns a bit.
"Liar." Mycroft smiles. "I'm blotchy and red. How could anyone find that attractive?" He exhales, slowly.
John raised his eyebrows. "Oh, well. I apologise." He says, simply. "Shall we change the subject?" *Since you're obviously not comfortable with this line of questioning.* "You said you found me while researching your desires? What desires are those?" He smiled again, a free, easy smile that invited one to share their concerns.
“I’m here Anth. I’m here.” Mycroft whispers, thinking Anthea is waking up. He kisses her cheek softly. “I promised you once and I’ll promise you again. I’ll always be here for you.”
"Sure. I could take you when Sky gets back if you want to see her before we go." He nods handing Michael his coffee.
‘Mm. Sure. Bruce is already asleep.’ He chuckles softly as he picks up Bruce carefully and carries him to Peter’s room.
He groans and starts to thrust harder. "It tastes absolutely brilliant. Even better with my cum in it." He smirks, squeezing her tits and playing with her nipples.
"Hey.." Collin pulls him closer by his hips. "You are a grown man and you shouldn't feel like you need to hide. You don't owe anyone anything and if you tell someone something they should feel honored that you shared with them. You don't owe anyone anything at all."
She leans forward a bit so he can reach her back better. "You know being thrown through a window isn't as fun as the movies make it look.." She chuckles softly.
"You did too... you gave me three perfect pups." John smiles over at their children then laces his fingers through Sherlock's.
She nuzzles him and relax. "When you asked Lydia earlier about the uterus transplant, what did you mean?" She asks softly as she rubs warm sudsy hands over his body.
“Believe me, Kia and I will be to focused on making sure things go properly than to pay any attention to your love making.” Loral nods. “If you want we can wait. I can grow the babies you have now though.”
“I hope so.” Sherlock nods. “And you’re doing a good job. I know it doesn’t feel like it and you feel like you're drowning but you’re doing okay.” He says softly.
“You are. So good. My good boy.” She rinses him off and drys him after shutting off the shower. She kisses him softly and leads him to bed, never breaking the kiss.
“Can’t help it. Violet was spanking me with one of the spatulas. I could help but get wet.” She whimpers, his arse all marked up and red.
"Oh I know.." He coos and rubs his back. "Myc and Sherl can help this time and you can take next time. Okay, babe?" He kisses his head.
Dark rubs his cock against her cunt, letting the tip slip in. “Mm. We won’t knot you this time so the others can still use you.”
Greg checks on them all before going. He leaves a note on the table in case anyone wakes before he gets back.
“Sorry about the yelping. It was just a little shocking. It was really cool though.” He blushes a bit.
“No, but if Sherlock gets a little too snappy for your liking you could off him.” Mycroft snaps, slamming his hand on the table. “He is under my protection and I will do whatever I think for to keep him safe.”
"She's trying to take out the money from his insurance claim.." He sighs. "What? Yes I'm here. No no put a hold on the account! She can't take it out! Because then I can't fucking burry him!" Greg snaps into the phone.
“Sherlock.” John sighs. “It doesn’t matter when you ask me, I want to be turned. I want to be with your forever.”
" She tries to say in his tone. "Daddy always used to say you'd chase criminals till you died." She pauses, lip wobbling slightly, "you're-you're not dying are you?"
She gasps and whimpers as he fills her, wrapping her legs around him. “He needs siblings. Shouldn’t we do that to him? Give him so many little brothers and sisters?”
He dries off when he gets inside and pulls her close. "Mm, they look cute, don't they?" He smiles as he looks at Michael and Jean sleeping on the bed.
"You want us to fill your slutty cunt with our cum? Breed you, use you? Just Cecil and I? Or do you want to invite our new friends?" He smirks.
She moans like a slut and her eyes slip closed, feeling so good and so full, never wanting it to end.
"Look, your brother is a git, but I doubt he's that cruel." John laughs. "Besides, he's got Lestrade to sit on now."
Sherlock cries out, arching under him. He moans like a whore and fucks himself back against him. "Harder!!"
“I think you’d look sexy in scrubs.” Sherlock says and then blushes furiously, his brain having said it without him stopping himself.
Sherlock gets up and goes to John, pressing against his back. “It’s alright. We’ll solve this so no one has to endure it again.”
John moans and presses his face closer, licking more. He reaches between Sherlock's legs and strokes him a few times. John wants to relive some of the aching pressure building in him but not enough to make him come.
"So handsome.. I can try and give you anything you want. Anything you need. You just need to tell me.." Sky says quietly and kisses his back softly.
Udos lays down behind Sherlock, spooning him. His large, erect clothed cock presses into Sherlock’s arse as he cups his breasts with his hands. “You’re a good boy. You can come whenever you want. As many times as you want.”
“Have you ever been fucked before?” Sam nibbles. “Mm you know peter is really good as suckling.” Sky smirks. “Oh really?” Carol smirks.
“Mm yeah. He has a lovely mummy kink and he loves to suckle.” She smiles softly, running her fingers through his hair.
She smirks and ties his hands to the headboard, sinking down onto his cock. "Mm the dirtier things you say the faster I'll go." She smirks and rides him slowly.
Teddy climbs over Mycroft's lap to poke at Harry's stomach, then over to Anthea to do the same. She looks up at both women, then over to John. Pointing to them all she says "Baby, baby and baby." Then slides off the couch to go sit with her nose pressed against the telly.
John smiles and feels Sherlock grow heavy against him as he falls asleep. John decides to stay up on the bed till Sherlock's deeper in sleep. He's just going to shut his eyes for a second......
He moans as he looks down at him, his hips falling out of rhythm when Benny spanks him. "God, so good, Benny.." He mumbles as he thrusts his hips harder into his mouth.
John smiles softly and slowly unties Sherlock, gently rubbing Sherlock’s limbs and making sure he’s comfortable.
Sky gets off the table and pulls Greg into a hug. "You are not broken. You are so strong and so very brave. But sometimes the strongest bravest people need help and there is no shame in that.." She rubs his back with her gloved hand.
"I'm going to have a drink. Do you guys want anything?" Eli smiles, taking off his suit jacket and rolls up his shirt sleeves.
"Mm sleep is for the weak. I've been up all night making this." She types on his computer and a holographic projection of a man appears in the kitchen. "This is Moriarty's 'Tiger'." She gets up and walks around the projection. She smiles because her work is quite impressive and looks completely life like.
Mycroft chewed his lips, possibly drawing blood, though he could not taste it. "I... I love you, Gregory..." He said, testing the waters.
He groans. "Can't help that we liked cock more. Feels nice to be full of it. Especially Sherlock's. Though he likes to bottom more."
“It’s not my fault. You just smell so fucking good.” Greg tries to keep a grip on things but his voice comes out more like a whine.
Molly's bottom lip wobbled and her eyes filled with tears. "Thank you, guys..." She said in a trembling voice.
“No! It’s not. You’re here. No one is safe around you.” Greg snaps. “No one is safe around any of you.”
She smiles and kisses his thighs before standing. "Would you be terribly disappointed if I wanted to ride you for a bit first before I fuck you?" She unzips her skirt and lets it pool at her feet, revealing that she's not wearing any panties.
"I do what it takes to make this right But we got to stop before the regret After the war is won There’s always the next one I’ll do what it takes to make this right Maybe I’ll crash into you Maybe we would open up these wounds We’re only alive if we bruise So I lay down this armor I will surrender tonight Before we both lose this fight Take my defenses All my defenses I lay down this armor I lay down this armor I lay down this armor for you.." He kisses his head softly.
“Okay.” He smiles softly and gets into bed with him, cuddling him close. “You wanna pick?” He hands him the remote to a huge flat screen mounted to the wall with all the streaming services hooked up. “Just type in what you wanna watch and it’ll come up.” He kisses his head, holding him.
He blushes, his cock stirring. "Please, Daddy. I'd love that. I'd love to show all your friends what a good little whore I am."
"Let's fix that." He smirks and gets the clamps. There's three clamps all attached to a chain. "Two clamps for your nipples and one for your wet hard needy clit. Agreeable?"
Mycroft lays out his cards for Crystal to see. “Take something off then.” He says as he pours himself a shot and drinks it. “I don’t think Augustus will get much territory, he didn’t move when Camille came back. But I think she’ll want to praise Doctor Watson and his mother.”
“I’m fine.” Crystal nods and fills her glass again. “I can take your pain into myself and block it from you. It speed it up. Arguably it’s more painful but it’s for a shorter time.” She shrugs and starts drinking her third glass. She cuddles into Mycroft like it the most natural think in the world as he sits he in his lap.
“High ninety percent I’d imagine.” Sherlock snorts, walking with John. “You Umm.. look well. Watson said you were going to the hospital for an interview. How was it?”
"Mm if you want to get in my pants you don't have to sweet talk me first." She says but still blushes brightly.
Mel blushes and gets off her. She sits on her legs with her thighs spread, her nipples puffy and excited.
"Mm you already had Carol. I was beginning to feel left out." Greg smiles, licking his lips as he looks at his bulge.
Sherlock is so tight around him John's orgasm takes him by surprise. He yells some version of Sherlock's name. He gasps and presses his face into Sherlock's shoulder.
By the end of his work day, Anthea had booked them for a weekend stay at the Secret de Paris, had cleared a weekend for Mycroft and had reserved a table at a Michelin restaurant. He knew she'd been listening.
She cries out and comes hard suddenly as he marks her. "More! More! Keep going!" She begs needy, wanting him to use her.
Dark whines at the praise, getting into the position that Darius suggests, moaning as he’s able to thrust even deeper into her, easily pushing past her cervix.
“Mm yes baby?” Greg smirks and takes a strawberry, dipping it into the pool of Johns cum on his chest. He licks the cum off it and eats it. “Mm even better than whipped cream.”
Lydia walks them quietly passed other rooms closed off by large glass sliding doors. She stops in front of the last largest door and slides it open. Sherlock lays in bed under the coma. The side of his head is shaved and stitched. His whole head is wrapped in clean white gauze. John steps closer slowly and takes Sherlock's hand in his gloved one.
“Well, I suppose someone has to.” Joann teases gently but smiles. “My first grandpups. How exciting.” She hums happily. “Unless Harry has pups out there that we don’t know about.”
Sherlock whines softly. "So big..." He huffs. All he wants is for John to bottom out, but *oh god*... he bites his lip and leans forward to capture John's lips in a heated kiss.
John nods. “I know. He knows. We’re just going to wait for him to decide. I think at the minute he just wants to get away from you all, because of what happened to him.” He explains. “Which I completely understand.”
"That's part of what brought me back." John says with a small smile as they change directions down a less crowded path. "Seeing how much you've done...I can't tell you how sorry I am that I up and left. I should have talked to you and not just assumed you would do nothing to change."
Mycroft feels himself drifting off again, finding it a bit odd that he's been so tired lately. He pushes the thought away and lets himself slip away to sleep.
"Yours! All yours!" She cries out and pushes back trying to fuck herself in his fingers needing to be filled. She opens her legs wider letting he do whatever he wants. She kisses and licks the leaking head of his cock as it moves between her breasts. Her tits are so sensitive if he touched them she'd come so hard. She loves it when he plays with her breasts.
Sherlock listens intently, having missed conversations with another adult that didn’t turn to shouting matches or pitiful looks.
Sky curls up against him and presses her face to his chest. "'M sorry.." She mumbles into his chest.
Sherlock smiles and kisses Margaret’s cheek. Everyone is gathered in the living waiting for Margaret to arrive.
Tindo here: Posting this early, because I have my Johnson & Johnson covid shot tomorrow. Not sure how it'll affect me, as I'm allergic to most medicines. So just in case I need to stab myself with my epi-pen, here's the chapter early so I don't have to worry about that AND trying to breathe all in one day. ;)
“Of course.” Sherlock nods. “I’d still like to take her to the lab and the Yard. For educational purposes only. Nothing case related.”
He blushes and gasps, rocking his hips. "I-it feels different. I know it does. The way they talk about it, how it feels, how sensitive they get when they're pregnant. Maybe it's because they have cunts."
Sherlock nods. “We could fake it. Prosthetics for a bond mark.” He rubs his fingers through John’s hair.
“I was high. The whole point was not to feel.” Sherlock shrugs. “Oh you mean just now? Amazing.” He blushes brightly.
"Mm alright." Greg unclasps the collar and slips it around Mycroft's neck. He kisses him and refastens it. He runs his fingers over Mycroft's neck over the suck marks, pale skin, and collar. "You are just perfect." Greg kisses his softly.
“I think we should work on getting you to the point where you can be happy with the way things are, not needing things to be perfect or wanting more.”
Sherlock licks his lips as he leans in to kiss along the side of Steve’s cock, Cecil kissing along the other side.
"Let me know when Sherlock has been alerted. Tell him I'm not doing anything rash, that I'll be safe at home. I'm useless to them pregnant. They'd want an Omega able to bear their children. Jim made it clear he doesn't want me. I think he's hoping I'll call Sherlock again so he can track the call. Maybe?" John sighs and leans into his mother when she puts a hand on his back.
"Turn around. Turn around." He stands and turns Sherlock to face the wall. He kisses Sherlock's neck and slicks his own cock.
"Never thought I'd want to bond with anyone," Harry says with a nod while running her fingers over Antheas knuckles. "But, I can't say that anymore. I do want to. With both of you if you'd have me. I'm fine with things as they are, but I can't help wanting more."
He whimpers and arches. "I.. I wouldn't mind having kids with you.." His voice is quiet as he finishes, a bit scared of her answer.
"Mummy is... quite eccentric." He muses. "A world class mathematician, but ... rather flakey otherwise." He chuckled. "But also an astounding cook. Father... well, he's just happy to sit back and let Mummy feed him up."
“Sit on the toilet.” John states before sitting on his lap, “the closer I am to you the stronger I feel.” He explains as he pushes the needle into his arm with a hiss.
Greg opens the door for him when the car pulls up. He sits quietly next to him in the car as it sits idle on the street.
She hums and smiles. "Mm, well, we can try to play truth or dare. I think we're still okay enough to play."
"I don't want to see clothes on you until we need to go downstairs for dinner..." John says in a low voice. "Strip, then see if you can figure out how to get these maternity clothes off me."
Mycroft sighs a bit. Sherlock rolls his eyes and huffs out his response. "Really, John. I think you're being a bit ridiculous."
They reach the front doors, Greg smirking as he spots John. “How are you?” He asks, pulling John into a hug.
Sherlock wanted to argue but he was exhausted. “Fine… ” He knew that if he looked too upset, Mrs. Hudson would panic when she got back. He had to calm down and have a stiff upper lip.
Greg relaxes a bit into Mycroft reassuring presence. He nuzzles and kisses his neck affectionately trying to show him how much he loves him. Greg holds onto him forcing himself to relax further.
Greg kisses as James helps him stand, holding his wrist funny. “Apparently you two have been off the grid all morning. Mycroft, Sherlock, and John were in an accident on the way to the airport.” Sky frowns. “What?” Greg pales, letting out a strangled sound.
“Mm these boys don’t know how to handle their cocks. Just want to stick them in a hole and get off. Not my cup of tea.” He shrugs.
"Me and Sky are going to go shopping." Veronica says. "We are?" Sky asks. "Yup." Veronica smiles. "Alright." Sky laughs softly, shaking he head.
“This way.” Pythia leads Sherlock through the halls. “So how does it feel? Knowing you knocked up one of the most powerful witches to ever live.”
Mycroft smiles. “You’re doing so well. I’m so proud of you.” He says softly as he stroked his finger back and forth.
“Just a bit. She fell asleep before I could get you. I’m sure she’s up now if you want to fill her again. Just look how perfect William is.”
"Fuck, after I'm done with this, I want to fuck your wet cunt and then eat you out. Taste my cum mixed with your juices. God, you're always so wet for me. Like a god damn whore."
“I proposed? The way you like to spring things on me I’d have thought you would have.” John rolls his eyes and brings in the tea.
Mycroft takes his time to study John, to see if he’s telling the truth. He ignores John’s question, in favour of asking his own, “what were the folklore stories your mother told you?” He askes.
Greg gets up and pours Mycroft a cup of coffee the way he likes. He heads up stairs. "My... I-I've got you coffee.." He says enticingly.
“Hey, But you taught me that vampires are good.” John says nudging him. “I just need to teach Greg that.”
John's mouth water at the thought, each thrust from James making him leak more and more. "God yes.. won't be able to keep my cock in my trousers."
He sniffles and presses against him. He trembles, complete crumbling. He couldn't believe that someone would want him. He thinks that he's unattractive because of all the scars coving his body and his overbearing size.
John smiles and holds onto him tightly. “How are you feeling?” He asks. “Headaches, nausea, hungry?”
Sky watches the cab leave and finally takes a breath. "The cabbie.. Was thinking about me.. I didn't like it.. At all.." She looks at the ground because she can't bring herself to look at Sherlock.
Greg knocks on the door and Sherlock opens it. "I need a second to apologize to John." Greg says quietly to Sherlock. Sherlock nods and let's Greg in before leaving John and Greg alone shutting the door. "John.. I.. I'm sorry.. I didn't mean to.. To snap at you like that. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.."
“I think I’ll just let it keep filling you. You tell me when you think you’re full enough.” He smirks, rubbing Sherlock’s swelling belly.
Sherlock nods and leans in to scent John’s, his bulky bandages visible through his shirt, some streaked with red.
He grinds down against him with a gasp. "Greg.." He bucks his hips into his hand and soon spills over.
“I’ve talked to her a few times while the girls played. I’ll look into it.” Sherlock nods, knowing John knows he’ll have Mycroft do a full background check on the girl and her mother.
John pulls away. “I think we’re being watched, love. Let me introduce you to our family.” He says softly.
“She loves you, John. Of course she wants to be with you.” Sherlock frowns. “All of this is surface level. None of it matters. What matters is that you love her and you want her.”
Mycroft nods. “Thank you Crys. I love you so much.” He says softly. He spins them over and sits Crystal down in the chair, holding her close. “You’re amazing.”
"My, you and John need to comeback to Sherlock's room. Your mother told him about us thinking about raising a child and it sent him into a panic attack. Lydia had to sedate him. He's out right now.." He says sounding tired and a little broken.
She works her cunt around his cock as she runs her fingers through Greg and Riley’s hair. “Such Good babies.”
Mel whimpers and presses closer as she kisses Chloe back, their huge tits rubbing and pressing together in front Zack’s face.
"Look who got up before noon." John laughs, then nods to the children sitting, "They're reading about their soul mates now. It's a lot to take in, so try not to tease them too much today."
"It even squirts fake cum. Spared no expense." She purrs, laying out on the bed and spreads her legs. She rubs her clit, already wet and dripping.
"Yes because I'm just going to risk my job for two people who show up claiming to be from the government to divert trains for them! That's insane to say the least." The man sighs.
She pulls off and turns around. She sinks back down so he can watch her arse and his cock moving in and out of her.
He presses his nose to John’s belly again, trying to smell more. It smells like him and John and something new. Sweet. Fragile.
"My daughter used to have a stutter worse than yours. If held her hand and tell her those lines. It was just long enough to get her out of her head and realize that she didn't need to hold my hand to stop the stutter. She just had to be patient with herself. Which was very hard for an articulate six year old to do, mind." Turk smiles softly, letting go of Michael's hand, knowing his stutter would be better if not gone.
“She’s like a mother to me, but I don’t know if I’m like a son to her, ma’am.” Sherlock whispers as he drinks the glass of blood quickly. “I just... I don’t know what to do. I love John but every time we argue he just walks away and let’s time heal wounds. He doesn’t have time.” Sherlock whispers.
He moans and licks up her cum. Michael pulls him into a deep kiss as he pulls away from Sky, moaning as he tastes Benny and Sky's cum.
“Yes yes! Please!” She begs, her cunt throbbing around his cock practically sucking the cum from his balls up inside her womb. “Want it. Want all of it. I’ll do anything for it. Don’t you dare stop fucking me till I’m pushing your kids out. Don’t even stop then.”
Mycroft turns the water off and wraps a towel around himself and one around Greg, smiling softly. “You're beautiful."
"Do it. Stuff me full of more. I want to be so huge. So fucking full." She wraps her legs around him and pulls him in deep.
"Mm probably a bad idea," John groans, "not sure I can control myself if I start that. Let me just touch you for now. Put your hands on my back."
Would you use your water bill to dry the stain like me?" Sky sings. "Are you high enough without the Mary Jane like me?
John smiles and heads off to shower. Later, he comes out with a towel knotted around his waist as he makes his way to the stairs.
John groaned, and opened and closed his mouth, trying to create enough saliva to swallow properly on his own, or speak.
Mycroft nods. “All right.” He murmurs. “That sounds wonderful. I'll... Make arrangements." He smiles softly, a rare smile that reached his eyes, only for Greg.
She smiles and takes him over to the work out room. She wraps his hands and shows him how to hit the bag properly so he doesn't hurt himself. "Go at it." She smirks and holds the punching bag steady. "Feel free to curse and swear as well. It releases endorphins that make you feel great."
"Murder of a husband and wife. Children were asleep and didn't hear anything...neighbors didn't see or hear anything. Through an argument was reported earlier in the week..." Sherlock replied.
She holds him close and rubs his back. ‘It’s okay. You did a good job. You got him back here so we could help him. He’s gonna be okay.’
John chuckles and nods. “Mmhmm. He called earlier and said he’d pick you up for dinner. It’ll be the first time he’s seeing you since you got pregnant.”
Sherlock comes bounding down the stairs a moment later. He looked thinner than he had before they’d broken up, almost as thin as he was before John fed him up, and somehow paler as well. “Watson.” He scoops Rosie up and holds her close. “John.” He nods.
“Lydia Watson.” Sherlock smiles. “I heard that John used to live here when he was a small child, can you remember him?” He asks.
Sherlock beamed as he leads John out of The Diogenes. “Now where would you like to eat, Doctor Watson?” He asks.
Sherlock smirks around John’s cock and let’s it go, keeping the head in his mouth so John can fuck his face.
Margaret carefully rolled onto her back and holds an arm out for Lydia. “Come on sweetie, you can sleep with me. I missed you last night.”
Mycroft smiles and nods. "He is.. He cares deeply about everything he sets his mind to. He's going to make a brilliant father.."
"You don't need to stop. I want you with all of you. I never want you any different than you are. You never need to change for me. You never have to be alone."
“I’m fine now. When Diōnē is in child baring years is when I’ll start to deteriorate. Unless something g happens.” Pythia nods.
Diōnē hums. ‘I was here when I was the same age as your twins are now. There’s a spot in the garden, overlooking a lake, I like the view, but you won’t want to go outside without dressing better.’
Sky walks into her room, seeing all her loves getting dressed. "Mm don't you all look delicious." She purrs and closes the door behind her, still naked except for the necklace.
They pull out of him and James pushes a plug into him, twice as big as his last one. They all check their names off his back before pushing the maker into him as well.
“Yes,” John nods. “No new advancements in human rights, no new technological advancements, no new wars.”
"Do you want to touch anything before I cuff you?" She she gets wetter over his cock and plays with the cuffs in her hands.
He opens his eyes as his fangs slide out again slowly. Uncapping the syringe and quickly pushing it into John’s vein. Sherlock shuffled back away from John, before he bites him. He doesn’t want to make this weirder for John than it already is, but his blood smells intoxicating.
“Mm he’s been giving me dominion trouble. He handles the Russian people and lately he’s been having them screw with my America’s. I’m not happy about it.” Crystal hisses. “That’s clever. We get his blood and then burn him. I’m so glad to be rid of him. He’s never done anything but caused problems.”
Molly murmurs in her sleep, shifting towards Anthea, subconsciously knowing she was safe with her fiancee. "Thea..." She breathes, softly.
“Because I saw potential in you that I knew would never be realized if you stayed there.” Mycroft frowns. “Because I was the reason you were there in the first place..”
Sherlock whined to himself. Maybe he should just go into the bedroom with one of the toys he'd bought years ago. It wasn't as good as John, but it might help him work through his agitation.
“Camille is scary. She doesn’t likes ghosts. We don’t come out when she’s around. Is John’s mummy going to be okay?” Lydia frowns, worried.
Mycroft pulls out of George gently and moves back. He gets off Cecil's cock and turns around, kissing Cecil hard. "You've always taken such good care of me Daddy. I wanna take care of you." He mumbles against his lips and sinks down onto his cock, riding him slowly.
"Greg, relive some tension from Sherlock." John says. "H-hand or mouth, Sir?" Greg asks. "Mm hand over over his pants, for now." John says. "Yes, Sir." Greg nods. Greg palms Sherlock through his pants. He groans as he feels Sherlock's hot hard prick against his hand.
"Nothing you can give will take the even take the edge off. They don't give addicts narcotics, John." She pulls the sleeves of her hospital gown down a bit more over her old track marks self consciously.
She gives a small nod, little arms wrapping around his neck to keep her upright. "Will you tell daddy you want to see me? He doesn't listen to me. This is the first time he's let me see you and I've asked loads."
“At first I think we were looking for proof and we found that.” Sherlock nods to the papers. “Now we have to figure out what to do with it..”
Joann tugs John up gently and Louann brings a chair over for him. “You and Harry were at a birthday party for some friends on the same street Jeannie lives on. So I went to her house for dinner and he was there. I don’t know if he called her or she called him but he was there waiting for me. I.. I was so shocked. He said I looked even better than when I was younger and he could overlook the stretch marks from carrying pups. He said he forgave me for mating with your father.”
"God you sound like such a little cockslut. I should keep you in bed all day and use you over and over. My own personal cum dump. I'd fill you up over and over again. You'd like that wouldn't you? You'd beg for my cock buried deep in your tight arse." He growls and bites at his throat as he fucks him even harder.
“We’ll get you more soon. Let us get dressed and then we’ll get you on a leash in your other form and get you bred.”
“Lydia knows. Watson’s have been protectors of vampires for a very very long time. Her family was and she was also being taught to be one. That’s probably why she was so quick to help you.” Margaret smiles softly.
“Daddy!” Sky giggles happily and hops up into Mycroft’s arms as soon as he comes in the door. “Welcome home, Daddy.”
"Ah.. I actually was not allowed to go into work for a while because of a dispute with my superintendent. I've been working from home."
“Needy omega.” Sherlock chuckles and it would sound more convincing if his cock wasn’t leaking already. He holds John’s hips and sinks his cock into John, groaning. “Slick. So slick for me.”
'Let Daddy come down your throat, baby. So close. Want to fill your mouth with cum and then want you to stand and give Daddy his cum back. Let Daddy taste himself in your mouth.'
“We need to talk. Mother to mother.” Magdala flicks her wrist, opening Camille’s office door and walks in before closing it with another flick.
"Oh god yes!" John sobs and throws his head back. He trembles and tries to breathe. He just has to hang on for a bit long. He moans loudly. "Fuck me harder, Mike! Please! I want to be sore! I want to be so sore I can't fucking walk right for a mouth! Give it to me! Just fucking give it to me!" He cries out.
He bites his lip as he looks over her, his expression changing. He offers a small smile. "Thank you for being honest."
“You are good Morna. You’re so good.” They praise. “And I think you’re going to make everyone here as lustful as you.” They smile, as they watch the two Gods suckling from Morna slowly change shape.
“Yes well when he wakes up you can tell him and he can chew me out.” Greg hums. “Beggars can’t be choosers.”
He hums as he looks over her notes. “I think you may have something here if you widen your search range.”
“Some want to be the only ones with that feeling so they can control the masses and dangle true connection in front of their faces like a carrot on a string.” Mycroft dips a biscuit into his tea.
"She should be here any minute now." Rosie says, looking up at them. "Why don't you and papa get a coffee, it's going to be a long day. Gina's mom can keep an eye on us."
"Yes of course.." Greg nods trying to let everything sink in. "Mm there are a few other things as well. Like how Harry is in that rehab that Mycroft offered her." She smiles.
He smiles and drives them to his luxury flat. He holds Sherlock’s hand and leads him inside. “Make yourself at home.” He smiles and hangs their coats up.
Mycroft moans and swallows everything before pulling away, wiping politely at his face as if he had just eaten a biscuit and had his afternoon tea.
‘I’m gonna have Sherlock and Mycroft join you. Im sure they’d love the chance to knock up their mummy.’
"Oh, My. I told you that you're perfect for me. You're exactly what I need. Always. I'll always need you and want you. I know you'll try your best but I want you to know that I'm not going anywhere because right by your side is where I want to spend the rest of my days. I love you so much. So so much that it hurts when I'm away from you. So much that you're constantly on my mind. So don't think for a second, an instant that you are anything other then what I need." Greg kisses him as passionately as he can manage.
**Don’t know. I’ve never intentionally tried to seduce a woman unless their was a case on that I needed to do it for. Talk suggestively or something. You’re quite good a talking dirty.—SH**
Sherlock moans and lets his fangs slide out, rubbing them against Margaret’s clit but pressing his tongue against the sharpe end so he doesn’t cut her.
Mycroft nods and whispers back in her head. ‘I know. It’s my fault, I got carried away. I promise to be better to you next time.’ He blows her a kiss before leaving the room.
He never could say no to her when she gave him that look. Maybe it was because he was trying to compensate for everything he had put her through. With a sigh, he leaned back in his chair and set his utensils down, "Yes, alright." he relented, "You can call him while I'm doing the dishes." He pushed back from the table and collected the dishes taking them into the tiny kitchen that was attached.
“Start again with Sherlock or start your life over again without him? Because six months radio silence seems like a without him situation which makes this whole situation very confusing.” Mycroft says deadpan.
She blushes brighter and nods. “Should take me out to the barn to have them or else this whole room will be filled with puppies. The other female dogs will take care of them out there.” She mewls as they squirm, her belly huge and bloated.
He blushes and whimpers. “I.. n-no. Not yet. Want to be edged all day, even if we’re not in the bedroom.”
‘I told them to keep their distance and for them to contact me before they take action unless they deem it strictly necessary.’
Sherlock blushes, tipping his head back as he tries to remember. "I've had you two, Eli, George, Mycroft.. Jean, Benny.."
Mycroft appreciated the admission. "I don't need to tell you about my work. I fear you've figured out more than you really should have." He chuckled softly, as a knock rapped at the suite door. He stuttered slightly, but steeled himself against recognition, not it'd happen, but it was still something to consider. He cringed, slightly, still waiting for the other shoe to drop.
“I love you more. Oh god, two days ago I thought I’d never be able to say that to you ever again.” John laughs in relief.
"I would have more faith if I could feel what she's feeling! But I can't because she's blocked me out!" He whines. "I need to find her. Now." He goes back into the house.
John kisses Sherlock and Morna’s cheeks. “I going to speak with some others, are you two okay here by yourself?” He asks.
John whimpers, his mind racing. "I just want to be full of cum. In my arse, down my throat, anywhere. You could do anything to me, Daddy. Come on me, piss on me, spit on me, whatever you want. Same goes for inside me. You could fist me up to your elbow and I'll still beg for more."
“I mean yes partially but a large part of it is ritualistic.” Crystal smiles. “There are many forms of rituals. Some in spell form or some in sacrifice. Others in body worship hence the orgies.”
Sherlock wants to cry. "I can't do this again..." He whispers, voice breaking. He gets off the bed and flees the room.
"It a central hub. Thousands of people go in and out every. The trains flying over the track sound like a heart beat.." Sky bites her lip.
Sherlock nods. “All thank to you.” He smiles. “When we are about to die we can... sort of... talk through the link. That’s how... why... that why Abraham didn’t kill me.” He sighs.
Sherlock listens for John and once he’s sure John is gone, he breaks down into quiet sobs. He is deformed.
Mycroft moans in delight, he had never been close with anyone back on Earth, and now he has the most beautiful Goddess inside him. “Fuck!” He moans. “H- harder.” He begs.
Myropis smiles, clicking his fingers and the same leather, strappy costume and lead wraps around the two boys. He grabs the end of the leads and tugs hard on them. “Come on. Get up.” He orders.
"You need to tell us what you want, love." John pulls his hair a bit tighter and runs his hands over Sherlock's chest, rubbing his thumb over Sherlock's nipples. "Mm yes. What do you want, darling?" Collin rubs his hand over Sherlock's inner thighs and ghosts his hand over his crotch teasingly.
Sherlock puts on gloves and reaches into one of the heads mouth pulling out a piece of paper. "The game is on and the fun only just begun. Until next time." He hums as he reads the note.
“Oh, love, no. I wasn’t even thinking about that.” John holds him tight. “I’m sorry that you went through all of that. I’m sure none of it was pleasant. I’m guessing it’s also why you’re skiddish when people talk about sex.” He kisses his head softly and wipes his tears.
John presses closer to Mycroft. "You want us to fuck you through the mattress don't you? You want it hard and brutal so you can barely walk after. Don't you?" John growls in his ear.
She moans and rolls them over, turning his vibrator back on. "You're so handsome. So perfect." She praises as she looks down at him and slowly starts to ride him.
John makes it through half the movie before his eyes begin to get heavy from a mixture of the medicine, comfort, and a full stomach.
“If that’s the word.” Greg frowns. “I’m never going to leave this life now and I don’t trust anyone else, not yet. So I want to stay with you. I trust you Crystal.”
"But it goes against everything you Alphas have already put into law. For instance, it's illegal for an alpha to as much as pinch someone else's omega. So what if we pitch soulmates as that Omega instantly belonging to their soulmate?"
“I did.” Jason smiles and pulls a little box out of his draw and hands it to Sherlock. The key inside even has a little skull on it.
He eases a second finger into him and rocks his fingers slowly before taking them out, easing the plug into him.
Camille hums. ‘You know where to find me, when you’re ready. Just know that I wouldn’t have given you this assignment, otherwise, I’m not trying to get rid of you, I just know you’ll want to get as far away as Mycroft as you can.’
Greg takes a step back, letting her have some space, never thinking of vampires having human lives before they turned. “I won’t touch you. I may not trust you, but I won’t intentionally harm you, unless it’s self defence.” He sits back in a chair, giving Crystal space.
Sherlock tenses again as he hears that the tiles are giving. He keeps his eyes on John ready to race to him and carry him outside if the floor gives. He feels so anxious now, with the eyes of the Preist on his head, he has to force himself not to tap his foot with nervous energy.
John smirks. “Are you going to knead me, little slut? Massage every last drop of out me?” He thrusts into her hard over and over, biting a bruise into her soft neck.
"Afternoon. Zack is taking his mum up to sleep. She's tired from the flight. She'll be down for dinner." Sky smiles and sits next to Michael.
She lays on the couch and puts her head in his lap. She takes the metal ball out of her pocket and starts playing with it, fidgeting with the design.
“Really. Some of the people we have at home are doctors and nurses. Turk is a Doctor. Plus we have a medical ward in the mansion. Full of all kinds of medical equipment and things. It’s as safe as a real hospital.” Sky nods. “I’ve had 15 babies there so far.” She smiles.
John feels his body buzzing with the orgasm and the pure joy of having Sherlock in his arms. He can't stop kissing him, small pecks all over his face, returning to his lips a lot.
There was a knock at John's hotel door. "John! You ready to go to dinner?" The thick female Scottish accent called through the door. "Come on."
“Oh god no. It’s best to keep the lid on that cookie jar. There’s no witch alive strong enough to do it anyway. Well maybe me but I’d never. I’m a witch by birth. Not by choice. Like you.” Margaret sighs.
Sherlock smiles before frowning, “but Mycroft. When Camille was in my head, I asked her about powers, she said she could feel one growing, but that I don’t have one yet.”
As John said it he knew that was the reason for his sudden shift in mood. It was one thing for him and Sherlock to be out together without Percy. Another entirely to be home without both Gladstone and their boy. It made John's hind mind think that something was wrong, and the feeling stirred up the soldier in him.
He smirks and suck the spot on the nape of his neck again wanting to hear him make that sound again.
Greg smiles a bit. "Didn't you say something about one of your friends wanting to cook? I overheard you talking about it before."
He hums and walks away. "Oh.." He turns back to look at the waiter. "And it's probably not a good idea to give someone your number after you've been shown their taken. There's nothing that pisses me off more." He holds up the receipt with the waiters phone number.
We talked about how she’s getting to be a big girl and soon she’s going to be able to use the potty and wear big girl pants because nappies are for babies. Her little potty is in the bathroom. We haven’t been successful yet but she’s making attempts so that is positive.
"Mm I also like to be held down and fucked when I'm stressed but this was the better option at the moment." He smiles and takes a drag.
John nods enthusiastically, feeling exactly the same way as Camille. “Ma’am, if I may be so bold as to speak.” He says softly.
“Really?” Crystal smirks. “What do you like most, mm?” She runs her hands over her body, making him watch.
"Probably." He grunts as he finally hooks something that seems to be clogging it up. "Or just have a company come in and flush them." He wants to tell her to stop putting food down the drain because that tends to be the culprit but he knows she won't listen.
“There you are. Wondered where you went.” Greg smirks as he sees them. “Ah an outfit change.” He chuckles.
John looks to Sherlock and sighs. “Let me talk to Sherlock about it. Alone.” He says, wanting his mother to leave them.
“I’ll show you.” Sky puts Nina down and picks up Dawn. She sits in a rocking chair and has Nina sit in her lap. “You hold the baby like this in your arm and make sure they’re comfortable. Then you pull your shirt down so the baby can get to the nipple.” She explains as she goes through the steps. “Then you hold the baby closer and let them latch onto the nipple. And they pretty much do the rest. Sometimes they can be fussy but eventually they’ll suckle.” She hums as Dawn starts to eat.
John goes around slowly tying up Morna. “This is for your own good. You’ve always been too handsy, you move to much whilst I try to fuck you. You know it’s better this way.”
Also last chapter there was a comment that Asher doesn't have a middle name. He does, you just don't know it yet. It's in one of the next chapters coming up.
“Okay. I’ll go find Grandpa George.” She smiles and hands them the adoption cards. “Hang these in the doors where the their cards were.”
Sky snaps the box closed and hands it to Mycroft. "This would be better kept in your hands." She hums and slips the engagement ring on her finger that was around a syringe in the box. Her favorite drug of choice fills the needle and she gives it up willingly handing the box to Mycroft.
He frowns and shakes his head. “Other than the ones I got from Jim and you, I didn’t know there were more.”
Greg nods. "I can get orders of protection put in place for us, Sherlock, and John. If he comes around again he'll have to be arrested for violating them. It may slow him down a bit and it'll be on record."
"It's fine, love. It's a lot to handle. It's okay." Benny smiles softly and runs his back gently. "It's alright, love. Just relax." Jean kisses his head.
"Greg turn left." Sky says. "But that's the wrong way." Greg frowns. "Just do it please." She says and he does. A car two lanes over and six cars back changes lanes and follows them. "I know you saw that, Mycroft.." She hums and bites her lips.
"Mm you have such a nice arse." He squeezes and spreads his cheeks. "I want you to count them. I want you to count each slap." He slap his arse.
He smiles a bit and hesitates. "W-We were talking about h-how we m-m-may be falling for y-you.." his voice shakes as he talks, half from his stutter and half from his nervousness.
"Can I ask you something then?" John needs to know before he agrees to put in the work. "Do you want us to get back together or are you doing this because it's what Rosie wants?"
"Could do... but they'd need proof of a bond. Not sure how we'd get around that mountain of a detail." John nudges his nose along Sherlock's chest, "though... it isn't the worst idea. Quite possibly my best option. If I ended up in the A&E, that'll probably mean we were on a case, and you'd be by my side anyways. On hand for any paperwork.. so to speak."
“Want me to fill your womb and take the cock ring off you? Looks like your about to pop. Poor thing.”
“I know Sherlock, and we can, but I’m not strong enough to do that forever. If the other Gods were here then maybe.” John says sadly. “If they were here we could make you a God and be together forever.” He explains.
He moans loudly, rocking into his hand. “Yes, sir. Love being used. Fucked and filled and covered with cum. Love being a dirty whore.”
"Nothing seems broken. I think it's just a concussion." She frowns and feels hums making sure nothing's broken.
“Can’t you see that you started out on the wrong foot? You stole our children. You never listened to my no’s. My boundaries. How am I supposed to respect someone who doesn’t listen?” John sighs.
“Why heal me? What’s the point of it?” Crystal looks up at the woman who left her in silver shackles the day before.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. "Yes, well... I wasn't expecting to miss you as much as I am." He grinned. "I suppose I should pack a bag." He makes a face.
“Sure.” Darius nods and starts to follow him. “Uh boys. As much as I’m enjoying the show you probably need these.” Sky holds up some clothes.
"We should go to the club after dinner tonight." Sky says to Collin. "That's not a bad idea actually. What does everyone think about going to my club tonight?" Collin asks.
“Well that’s good I just… don’t want to hurt you.” John is stalling, he knows that, trying to gain some control and not get too carried away. But by god, it is hard not to.
When Rosie reaches them she's nearly out of breath but she's grinning, "I've been invited to a birthday party," she announces.
Sky cries out and whines as they fuck her, taking everything they give her and loving it. She leaks over Mycroft’s cock and down to George’s and Cecil’s, making a mess.
'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.' She tries to stop crying and to breathe normally but it's getting harder and harder.
John showered with military efficiency and shaved. He looked at himself in the mirror and put his shoulders back, giving a nod. He goes up to his room to get dressed. If he chose Sherlock’s suggestion that was just a coincidence.
John leans closer shifting Sherlock on his lap groaning as he moves over his cock. John sucks on Mycroft's neck marking him.
The pups wobble a bit as they make their way, tripping over themselves and each other. They’ve nearly tripled in size in just a few days.
"It's a bit like," he says around a bite, sending crumbs into the water. "Watching a really bad porno, where you just can't look away no matter how badly you want to. Like feeling every cell in your body turn to lava for days on end unless sexual gratification is met. It's always been bad for me, I was told they'd get easier once I was an adult... but.." He shrugs and meets Sherlock's gaze, unaware of just how weird it was to be having this conversation naked, in a tub, with an Alpha looming over him. "Too many years suppressing it, I guess, kind of ruined it for myself."
"Let's head back, and we can go for a walk in the garden. Mycroft said he'll join us for lunch. We'll need something other than every type of baked good for lunch though."
John is at Sherlock's side holding his hand and Mycroft is by his other side. Greg walks behind them watching. He takes out his phone and silences it before taking a few secret pictures of his three loves.
"You know the rules. I try to pin you down you try to pin me down for three second. If you're pinned down and want to forfeit slap the mat three times. Anything else you'd like to make a rule?" She rolls her shoulders.
He smiles softly and leans in to kiss him before sitting back, spreading his legs so Mycroft can have his cock. "Good boys make their Daddy feel good. Come make me feel good."
Camille calms, the cold not so freezing. “You are a good boy, William..” She says softly. “His name is Tyrannous. He gave tyrants through our history his name. He lives off chaos and suffering. Wherever their is war and death, that is where you’ll find him.” She sighs, loving all her children even if they betrayed her just like a real parent. “This country isn’t safe for our kind but there is one here that will give you shelter while the sun blazes. I think you already know who she is..”
Greg sprinkles cinnamon and sugar over the toast and sets the plate in front of Mycroft with the cup of tea.
"Oh good, Mycroft! We thought you wouldn't make it in time. Hurry up and come upstairs. I'm finally ready to bond."
"That's brilliant." Collin smiles and looks over at Mycroft and Sherlock asleep on the couch. Greg hums and opens another beer.
“A trained cockslut like her? She can take us and more.” John smirks. Violet blushes brightly and spreads her legs more.
Carol moans loudly and arches, feeling so full and stretched. “So so full.” She whimpers and rocks her hips a bit.
Sherlock looks back at Mycroft and glares. He hums and looks at a python that had just eaten, a large lump in his stomach. "Oh look, it's you, Myc."
[And what if one of us is feeling insecure but the other isn't? Would you tell me how you were feeling if I initiated or would you go along with it?]
Sally smiles and nods. “So you don’t consider the whole sleeping with Gregory thing a secret?” Her mother smirks and Sally blushes brightly.
John whimpers and his hard cock twitches sympathetically at the mention of being tied up. "I tried to be a good boy. I tried. I just forgot."
He kisses him back. John rolls a condom on and lubes himself up. He aligns his body with Sherlock's. "Ready?"
"Sherlock." John raises his eyebrows. "Do I have to ask Mrs Hudson to come in and bully you? Or god forbid you're scary brother."
“No. I’m fine. It’ll be gone by the time the day is out. Then I’ll have you do it again.” Sherlock smiles and kisses him softly. “Are you hungry? Let’s feed you.”
“How she pressed me against the wall? Or how she fucked me over her desk? Or how she woke me up this morning by eating me out until I came screaming into my pillows?” Violet whines. Sky smirks, loving to watch how desperate Violet gets.
Sky moans and presses her face to the bed. “So good. I love your cock. Feels so good. So perfect.” She whimpers as her cunt pulses around him, sucking him deeper.
“Yeah about that. The enchantment makes the castle change. So it’s a bit hard to keep track. The artwork moves hallways so you think you e been down a hallway before when you really haven’t. The hallways themselves seem to stretch on forever especially when your tired. Oh and if you don’t anchor yourself to a room you won’t be able to find it again unless you ask nicely.” Maggie smiles.
