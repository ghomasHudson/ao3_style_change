She huffed a laugh. “No. By ‘healer’ he means for everything that doesn’t require magical Healing. For that, Cas is our best Healer. I take care of everything else. We try to do what we can without calling on the Witches. Their energy is best put to other uses when mundane works will do.”
Dean stepped up and cupped the nape of his neck. “Hey. Didn’t expect to see you so soon. Everything okay?”
Cas arched a brow at him. “It takes little more effort to set up two bedrolls as one.” He didn’t listen to any further protestations, simply untying both bedrolls from the saddle and setting them up. The oiled canvas went down first, protecting the rest of the bedding from the moisture of the earth. Then he spread the rest of the bedding out.
Dean lifted his canteen to his lips and took a long swallow of water. His every instinct bade him to get up in their faces and challenge them, but… but they were part of this community, and letting them pick a fight with him wasn’t going to do him any favors. “You implying that I don’t know how to do my work as a Familiar?”
Well. Honestly, he’d known next to nothing about Dean, and hadn’t asked. Now he knew some things about his family, that he was close to them, that he missed them terribly. But he still knew nothing about what drew Dean to answer the advertisement and accept the position of Castiel’s Familiar.
“He’s in heat,” Sam says carefully, and he notices the way Other-Him’s eyes spark with curiosity, even as Other-Him seems to notice Sam’s cautious body language. He takes the tea off the stove, busying his hands as he continues the conversation he never thought he’d have to give. “It’s— we mentioned Dean was an Omega, right? They have… there’s an ‘innate instinct’, I guess, to reproduce with their— with their mates, twice a year. As society’s evolved, obviously, people don’t have kids that often, but it’s still stayed. Cas— he normally helps Dean through them, but…” Sam scoffs, shaking his head, and lets Other-Him finish the train of thought.
“You’re Billie,” he hedges, and judging by the appraising look she gives him, he’s right — then again, if he was wrong, that would mean the woman was an intruder and therefore he would’ve been dead before he could even have seen the scythe, but you win some, you lose some.
you guys get through the portal? Back here, at least, it took us… ages to figure out the portal to another world, and almost a year to get the grace of the spell.”
They gather in the War Room, and Other-Dean tosses Dean a beer, unscrewing the cap to Sam’s and sliding it across the table in what almost seemed to be an instinctual movement. Dean’s eyes linger on the naked neck of the bottle but says nothing, and Sam just picks it up after a moment, raising it in a quick thanks.
burrows in his chest. “Go to California, settle down, live your life. You don’t get involved in hunts at all. In fact, you barely leave your house. You guys have the easy job, Sam. You guys? You just need to
Other-Dean raises his eyebrows and Sam’s torn between being happy that Dean’s sleeping so he doesn’t have to hear the conversation and wishing Dean would wake up so Sam wouldn’t feel the absence of Other-Dean’s scent enveloping him, so he wouldn’t feel like Other-Dean was almost…
“No, I’m pretty sure Billie would want you guys to stay here, figure out what you guys did — look, Cas can just heal you guys, and if not, I mean, the bunker’s the safest place to be, y’know?”
Dean, something that once would’ve terrified Sam but now just registers at number 7 on the list of things to deal with (eyes flicking side to side,
In front of them, Other-Dean and Other-Sam freeze, and then they carefully look at each other and it’s weird as hell, seeing them communicate in glances and touches the way he and Dean do, but not being able to understand it because they
They pointedly walk past Other-Cas’s bedroom and find some other, empty one, and Sam decides not to mention the whiff of sulfur in the air as they pass by the bedroom — it would be too much, after their whirlwind of the last 48 hours. Dean practically collapses in the bed, rubbing his crotch against the sheets and closing his eyes. Sam hopes Dean either doesn’t realize or forgets Sam’s still there because no matter how close they are this isn’t exactly something he wants to see, and so he chews his lip and leaves, heading to the kitchen.
Dean about his and Other-Dean’s conversation and so he nudges Dean, flicking his eyes between Other-Dean and Other-Cas in code they’d perfected when they were practically two.
Personally, Sam finds it almost ironic that it’s Other-Dean telling Dean (telling himself?) to take better care of himself when he’s pretty sure he himself wouldn’t do it which brings up a pretty interesting psychological question that he doesn’t want to think about.
“Yeah,” Dean says after a short pause, and his voice is tense even as he starts going through his messages, checking that Charlie’s program is still working as he tries to find anything incriminating in his texts or Twitter.
Sam and Dean nod the affirmative, and normally they’d be fighting tooth and nail about getting treated like backup, but it seemed like even Dean knew that it wasn’t exactly smart to run in a weird-ass world with
“I… I think Cas is cheating on you.” Sam says it all at once, tumbling out of his mouth like he’s almost afraid of the reaction that it would cause. Dean pauses, fingers tensing before he lets go of the pen, letting it clatter to the desk. Sam’s voice breaks, and it takes Dean a moment to remember that while Sam and Cas might not be friends, Sam liked Cas the most out of all the guys Dean’s dated and this must’ve been hurting him as much as he expected it to hurt Dean.
Finally, Other-Him says, “If you’re looking for the lemon, it’s in the fridge.” Sam looks up and Other-Him purses his lips, gesturing vaguely to the stove. “Honey lemon tea, right? I used to— used to make it for Dean, when he was sick. He didn’t know it, but…” Other-Him shrugs, chuckling awkwardly.
“Sam won’t get why I’m letting you off the hook and then randomly break it off with you in the future, unless we purposely have someone catch you with Balthazar again.”
Sam looks up from the books he’d been pouring through, the clang of the bunker door closing punctuating the words. Back in their world (and wasn’t that a sentence he never thought he’d say?) they’d only used the bunker for a year or two before giving it over to Claire and Krissy when they moved out, but navigating the old controls again gave him nostalgia that he didn’t even have when he saw the Other-Them get in Baby.
Dean hated this, hated it with his whole being. Leaving himself this open, not holding anything back from Cas, meant that he could feel Cas’ terror. It was frankly amazing that the Witch could function at all, much less with the poise and competence he exhibited. “Ellen. I need an assistant. If you are busy with Rufus, please ask someone else to attend. Someone with a sturdy stomach.”
After a silence that started to stretch on too long, Castiel began to muse aloud. “The outpost isn’t so old that we have mature fruit trees. We have apples, but peaches might be difficult to obtain. Not impossible, perhaps, if someone is willing to send some canned. Or dried might be easier. Do reconstituted dried peaches work in peach cobbler? Even sugar is precious.” He considered further. “If sugar isn’t already on the list of things I am supposed to bring back with me, it can be added. If peach cobbler is important to you.”
Maybe some of that started with him. He wasn’t all that happy about it himself. So many things could be wrong. Sure he was the one being served up on a platter, but in the end he was still a conduit, feeding and filtering the power but not actually using it. On top of that, Amara had an interest in keeping him alive and functional.
“I will handle Gabriel, Dean. Let him rage against me.” Gabe wouldn't hurt Cas under any circumstances. He wasn't so sure that Dean would enjoy the same restraints, and if Gabe hurt Dean... Cas wasn't sure he'd be able to forgive his brother, no matter how much he loved him.
“Thank you, that sounds wonderful.” Donna was kind enough to indulge Cas’ fondness for honey. “These bags belong to Dean. If you would be so kind as to take this one?” He indicated one of the bags with a nod, even as he picked up the other. “The others can also come inside, aside from the items Garth has set aside. Those are the orders people sent with me and can be delivered directly to them. You have the list, Garth?”
Cas and Gabe had made camp by the time Dean returned. He dropped a Pronghorn at Gabe’s feet, then nibbled at his toes to clean them.
Dean wasn’t exactly surprised by the question. Most of the Witch circles in New Avalon knew the story, if not the entire eastern seaboard. Not as many associated Mary Campbell with John Winchester. His father wasn’t from a well-known Witch lineage. The Angelus Witches didn’t have any reason to take note of him.
“Yes, right. Of course.” Something they should have thought of before heading out, actually. But this was a new situation to navigate for them both. Castiel hitched Smoky to a nearby branch and moved enough away to find a clear bit of ground. He pulled a knife out of his belt and pushed his sleeve up enough to expose his wrist. Dean did the same.
Dean’s head dropped and he took in a deep breath. “I don’t think that. I know you care,” he said, his answer subdued.
“I agree about flying Familiars having certain advantages. My sister-in-law has a red-tailed hawk Shift form. When we went out to the northern wilds on a hunt, there were things she was very good at that I can’t do at all.”
The travel was slow going. Dean lead the way along the little-used trail, using all the advantages of his shift form. When it got too thick and overgrown, Cas used his magic to coax the heavy growth away from the path.
“Hey, I was doing just as much of the chanting as you were. This is what we both wanted, right? You aren’t upset?”
“Sure did.” Dean walked over to start making himself some tea. He wasn’t usually one for tea, but it had started to grow on him. The tea set was all delicate bone china that didn’t really seem to fit any of the residents of the house, white decorated with painted pink roses and delicate green leaves. The teapot sat on a crocheted white doily, remarkably clean given the general dustiness that seemed to surround Willow River. Clearly both the tea set and the doily were well-cared-for.
Cas nodded, managed a weak smile in return. “Yes. I ‘got this’.” He tugged his blanket more securely around himself, then strode off towards the pink and white striped house at the end of the pathway.
Dean watched as Ellen gently but firmly pressed Cas towards Bobby. Rufus was… there wasn’t much of anything that could be done for Rufus. Even Dean could recognize that. The most she was going to be able to do for him was make him comfortable.
He shook his head. “Nope. Never received an invitation, and if there’s one thing I learned early and well, it’s that you never, ever walk into a Witch’s private space without an invitation. Not if you value all your parts staying attached where they started out.”
“I could, but that wouldn’t be as much fun, would it.” He grinned and turned to the luggage pile, exchanging a few words and a coin with the coach driver while Castiel waited. He nodded towards the other passengers as well.
“We won’t get far in a week,” Cas answered as he considered it. “This is meant to be training so not going too far is smarter. I believe Charlie is getting restless as well.”
Cas blinked, unsure how seriously to take Dean’s suggestions. “Those all sound ridiculous,” he said. “I suppose I should be grateful that the settlement was already named before Gabriel and I arrived. He would have been quite enchanted by any of those suggestions. My brother… sometimes seems incapable of taking things seriously.”
Charlie wasn’t a big fan of horseback riding in people form. Gabe had a woven basket strapped to the saddle for her to jump up into and ride that way when she didn’t feel like running alongside any longer. She didn’t use that quite yet, though. She chose to range on out ahead of Gabe and Cas.
The difference between the east bank and the west bank of the river was startling. This was not just death, but an open seeping wound. Dean tightened his grip on Cas and took in a careful breath. It took every bit of strength in him not to fall ill.
“I have observed that about you.” Cas smiled fondly, “Do you need to shift? You seem to be better at it as a cat.”
The scythe reappears in Billie’s hand, and she looks at Sam expectantly, waiting for him to make the connection.
blind because he just quips, “Yeah, we do. Fucking jackass, but I gotta admit, hiding in a beta? Smart.”
He waits for a moment, because from the little he could see it seemed like sex was pretty taboo in this world (which was weird as hell), but… well, it would be awkward as hell if someone walked in Dean’s room meaning well.
He snorts. “You, according to us, have some plan? I don’t think you saved us just out of the goodness of your heart.”
“We talked to Cas, about the, uh, the ‘mating’ thing you guys brought up, and…” Other-Him stops squeezing the lemons and instead leans against the countertop with Sam, talking as they wait for the tea to steep. “Well, Cas’s— according to Cas, the only similarities he can find between your guys's… ‘genders’ and our world is that angels mate with bite marks, too, and so the working— the working theory is that in your world, Chuck decided it worked well on angels and so he gave it to the monkeys, and then the monkeys evolved, and in this world, it didn’t end up happening.”
Dean’s eyes go wide, and it’s obvious he’s figuring this out too, because his hands shake as he still pats himself down, going through his wallet and only finding empty Trojan wrappers. “Shit.”
“Sam picked you up this morning, right? Should make sense to him.” The fact that it’s going to be torture to get them to believe them is another matter, but it’s better than nothing.
He thinks he vaguely recognizes the weapon from the days of Apocalypse numero uno, back when the Horsemen were still in the playing field, which means…
“So…” Other-Dean breaks the silence, and the awkward moment isn’t forgotten as much as shuffled to the back of their heads as they all subconsciously lean forward, the universal ‘let’s figure this out’ stance. “What are we going to do with you— us?”
He thinks he took a wrong turn somewhere past the shooting range because now he’s next to the infirmary when he meant to go to the library and read up on angel anatomy, and suddenly there’s a very dangerous-looking woman standing in front of him and holding a scythe.
Chewing on his lip, Other-Dean grunts in affirmation, seeming not to notice the almost identical expression on Sam’s face. Sam gets up and puts the books away, closing up the page with the highly detailed anatomy of a human’s nose. He’s about to leave the room when he stops and looks at Other-Dean. “I know this is going to sound weird, but… what is Cas to— to you guys?”
from the Dean Sam knows. “What do you mean, ‘mated’?” He even uses the finger quotes, and Sam just blinks, turning to glance at Dean, whose scent is still tinged with sadness but now confusion. They only look at each other for a moment but that’s all they need, and suddenly the sort of amiable mood in the room is shattered, the four of them looking at the others with suspicion even though they
Dean’s spirits soared as he moved through the grasslands past the river. After yesterday’s storm everything felt fresh and clean. The ground was springy rather than hard, the scent of grass pleasant. Here and there he caught a flicker of movement from various prey. Being bonded with Cas meant that those flickers weren’t as distracting as when he was solo. That was different. On the whole, he found that he retained far more of his human intellect now, while losing none of the abilities of his shifted form. If anything those abilities were sharper. He could more easily sift through the various scents, his vision could focus farther and more sharply, he could hear better, and both his speed and endurance were enhanced.
Cas exhaled, nodded, and resumed. “I didn’t understand this until much later, but my family had either discovered or learned of a way to warp the bond between Witch and Familiar so that the balance was tilted strongly in favor of the Witch. I had little in common with Otto, and Otto… Otto hated the Angelus family. He hated
Traveling was slower than the day before as they wound around trees and up and down hills. By evening, they still had not reached the corrupted land that Dean could still sense to the southwest. The longer they went without reaching the source, the more concerned Dean grew. How strong was it, that he could sense it so far away?
something that smells that noxious?” Cas stepped inside, giving his eyes a moment to adjust to the darker interior. Gabe had the curtains drawn. The fire in the hearth was banked down to embers. The cauldron hanging from the tripod was the source of the haze. Cas coughted.
Dean could understand their frustration. As much as he and Cas were working on mastering working together, he wanted to be doing something more important, making a contribution. He wanted to go out on a scouting mission, not keep working on school exercises until he thought he’d scream or break something.
In the archway stood a woman dressed in deep black flowing robes, the kind worn by Witches hundreds of years ago. Her skin was pale but clear, her dark eyes piercing. Dark auburn hair cascaded over her shoulders. Her skirts moved faintly. She turned slightly until she was facing them.
“Frankly, the thought of being out in the wilds is exciting. And I don’t mind a rough lifestyle. My family has taken long hunting trips to the northern mountains a couple times a year. That life suits me far better than the city.”
Then there were the frequent attacks. Crows, foxes, deer… all with the black veining and black eyes, honed in on Dean. Once there was a wolverine. That one did some damage before Cas managed to destroy it.
He left the house before dawn, sparing a glance towards the small room where Dean slept. He could feel him through their bond. That steady presence was comforting, especially after the jangling feeling of losing Nora. After her death he hadn’t been himself. Small things set him on edge, made him upset. Once Charlie accidentally put salt in his coffee instead of sugar, and it was all he could do not to either snap at her or burst into tears.
His eyes shot open to find his field of vision taken up entirely by a pair of gold-flecked green eyes. “Dean.” His voice was hoarser, deeper than usual from disuse. He reached up, his fingers skimming the stubble along Dean’s jaw, finally burying his fingers in Dean’s hair. “You’re all right.” Touching Dean, knowing he was real, was well worth the burst of pain from reaching up.
He patted the pockets of his coat, felt the crinkle of paper in the inside upper pocket and pulled out the list. People knew that his reason for coming out here was to meet Dean, but the trip to civilization and the market was rare and difficult enough that combining it with purchasing supplies only made sense. He had limited space, unlike when anyone made the trip with full team and wagon. That generally happened only in high summer, after the spring rains were long gone and the terrain was harder and dryer.
“I’ve no control over what Cas does or doesn’t do. I’ll keep him safe, that’s the most I can offer,” he replied to Gabe.
Charlie’s eyes sparkled. Anything that Cas didn’t want Gabe to know was well worth knowing. Her sense of fairness made her answer honestly, however. “I will try to keep it from him. Things do slip through when we’re linked, though. You know that.”
Cas looked at him for a long moment, his expression strangely wistful. Then he shook his head. “Perhaps another time. Sometimes we have music. Donna has a lovely singing voice, and Max and Alicia play instruments. Max brought a guitar along with himself, and Alicia made herself a drum. They’re quite good. Perhaps it has something to do with being twins. I’ve heard that twins can have a kind of bond similar in many respects to that between a Witch and Familiar. I’ve meant to ask... “
“Big one, too,” Dean nodded. “Most of the bears around here we’ve come across, their tracks are not much wider than my own.”
She yipped, her eyes shining in amusement and pleasure. She batted at him with a delicate paw, her full, luxurious tail flipping up to curl over his neck.
Gabe tucked his hands in his pockets and rocked back on his heels. “Try not to let Cassie get reeled into any Angelus politics,” he told Dean.
* he asked Cas. As annoying as all of the strict training Cas had been insisting on was, it did have the benefit of solidifying their bond as much as possible at its current level.
“No, you don’t have to,” Gabe assured her, giving her a hand up to sit in front of him atop his horse. He wrapped his arms around her and hugged.
The door opened on its own, a cloud of green-purple haze escaping into the fresh air. “What are you doing?”
“CAS!” The door downstairs crashed open, and the shout was repeated. Charlie, it was Charlie, her voice higher and spiked with worry. “CAS! Get down here, there’s trouble coming! Riders coming back hurt!”
Dean moved around, looking at things, reaching for items but stopping before he actually picked them up. “Thought you invited me up here to get drunk and forget about that nightmare for a little while. Not start strategizing against it.”
As typical in the spring, there had been a lot of rain. The primitive roads west of the rail terminus were questionable under the best conditions; in the spring, they became muddy and even more difficult to travel. Castiel was not surprised when the stagecoach arrived some two days late. Really, two days was far better than he had allowed for. He waited on the boardwalk just outside the post office as the coach pulled in, caked in mud and laden with trunks piled atop the roof. The trunks were tied down with a net of ropes.
Dean pushed a book aside to give himself room to lean on the table and look down at the drawing. There was enough preservation magic imbued in the pages that the ink was still dark, but the writing was cramped and spidery. Dean snorted. “Way to be a cliché with the handwriting. Did Witches used to take classes on how to cause eye strain for future generations? What was it believed to contain, and what does it actually do?”
Roy and Walt exchanged glances, then headed off together at a distinctly faster pace than they’d arrived.
“Yesterday I’d been on the road for three days,” he pointed out. “Good morning, Charlie.” He smiled at her. The hug felt good, so good. Ordinarily he wasn’t touchy with people he barely knew, but somehow Charlie was different. Maybe it was the kinship of being the only two shifters here, or maybe it was just something inherently Charlie.
“Cassie! Looks like you made it safely with Tall, Not-So-Dark and Handsome.” He shoved his hands deep in his pockets and gave Dean a thorough once over. “Earlier than expected, too. I would have taken more time.”
“Just. Tell me more about this bear. How are you tracking it?” Cas took another bite of his lunch. Eating was important. Keeping his strength up could be crucial.
Cas sighed. “Yes. I understand.” He leaned forward to place a kiss on Dean’s mouth, soft, almost reverent. “I feel the same. We will do this. We must.”
The strategy session at the Saloon was loud and long, with high tensions and short tempers. Gabe had to pull everyone to order more than once with the crackle of energy. In the end, though, they emerged with a plan everyone more or less agreed to.
for them. The type of words that included juggling one of those balls of sparks he’s so fond of and letting it zap them now and then. Walt ended up with a nice hole with singed edges right in his seat.”
“Uh huh. Don’t think Jody and I can keep an eye on a calendar? Now git out of here. I think you’re on trench rotation this week.”
Two days later, the five Winchesters stood together on the train platform in New Avalon, along with Dean’s two trunks and the satchel he wore over his shoulder. Most of the contents of the trunks were things that he hoped would be useful on the frontier, not just for himself but for the community he would be joining. There was a box that Mr. Angelus had asked him to bring to his cousins, and then there were the luxury items Mary had packed for him.
“You’ve made a lot of progress with the resources you did have.” Dean squeezed his hand. “You, Gabe, Charlie and Nora are the reason none of the corrupted creatures we’ve come across have been people. “
“I’ve no desire to get dragged into anything to do with Michael or Lucifer,” Cas answered for himself. “With luck, Balthazar will be the only one to know I’m there.” He took his turn hugging Charlie. “We’ll be back this way soon enough. Neither one of us want to make the big city our home.”
“It’s Bobby and Rufus.” Charlie trembled, barely able to keep her emotions in check. “Bobby and Rufus. Ellen is getting the back room cots ready.”
Cas nodded. “Yes. Gabriel gets angry when he is worried, but now that he knows the two of us are both hale and healthy, he will gradually relax. Our news will give him a new focus, as well.”
“Oh, man.” Dean leaned forward, setting his mug down on the table. “How far have you gotten?” he asked Bobby, tone in a conspiratorial whisper. “Has Amos started courting Winnifred yet?”
“For me, too,” Charlie agreed. She stumbled over to pour herself a cup of coffee as well. “The basket is a lot more comfortable than sitting in a saddle all day long.”
He should be worrying about whether he was even going to make it back to Willow River. Not whether his bedding was going to get wet. Not like he even slept there any more, anyhow.
“Come on, let’s get you up to bed.” Dean practically carried Cas up the stairs. He wasn’t a light man, either.
Soon the Familiar joined him at the fire, back to his human form. “That felt fantastic. I almost didn’t want to change back.” He rolled his shoulders and stretched his legs out towards the fire.
“Then Gabe returned. He waylaid me when I was out in the gardens reading an old text on esoteric sigils and their meanings.”
“Poker, dealer’s choice on variant. Not much point wagering cold hard cash, so we have some chips that Garth carved for us. Sometimes other wagers.”
. Do you not remember what happened with the rabbit? How the fuck did you think you were going to be successful against a bear?”
They passed through a central yard ringed by buildings. One had a roughly painted sign hung from a roof overhanging a porch, labeled ‘The Saloon’. Dean chuckled to himself. He hadn’t seriously believed it was just called The Saloon. Holy hell.
“Probably be easier starting out with a bookshelf rather than a door.” He started to explain what it was he was doing, and why. The angles, the shims to square up the frame, why placing this section first was important.
was there, dressed in black, her dark red hair blowing in the wind. Artfully. She was beautiful, he couldn’t deny that.
As soon as they stepped into the saloon, Ellen came around from the back. Her hair was pulled back into a messy bun, and she looked hot, her face red and beads of perspiration dotting her hairline. “Morning, gentlemen. Get the door installed?”
“Too many, considering the short amount of time that Willow River has existed. Since Gabe and I have been here the deaths are fewer. Magic can cure the corruption if it hasn’t gone too far, and the charms we provide the scouts have aided in keeping them from getting tainted in the first place. Even so, this is a dangerous life. We’ve lost...” He looked up as he thought. “Nora, of course. Asa Fox, Bill Harvelle, Frank Devereaux, and Jim Baker since I’ve been here. Others before.”
“Dean Winchester.” Charlie’s gaze sharpened as she caught the scent of a tale. She bounced on the balls of her feet. “What happened out there? Nevermind, for now, about that bear and whatever else happened. Did you and Cas…?”
“In this world, I’d say it’s pretty gay,” Other-Dean retorts, and Other-Cas looks at Other-Dean, eyes dropping as he marginally moves away from Other-Dean. Sam can’t help but wince because Other-Dean’s reacting practically exactly like Dean had predicted and so he just shakes his head.
The silence is awkward, broken only by the distantly-approaching footsteps of whoever else was coming.
.” He stays silent and watches Dean close his eyes, taking in a breath. “You know what, fine, knock yourself out. Check out the library. I’m going to be in the kitchen.”
The room Dean was staying in, tucked away in a corner of the bunker, two storage rooms sandwiching it, was dusty and musty and perfect. While it may not have been the best — Sam quickly figured out that there weren’t even knots, let alone Alpha pads, anywhere near the bunker — it would (hopefully) be private enough for Dean, and the bathroom’s weren’t too far away. Still, going through heat without your mate when you
“I don’t know about you,” Cas finally begins, “but I think our current arrangement works just fine. I don’t think I’d like them thinking I’m a cheater, really, and I have no plans of trying to
There’s shuffling in the background, the sound of a few sobs, and it hits Sam that there’s someone in the infirmary. Currently. Listening to their whole conversation. Billie follows his eyes and chuckles — low, amused — but doesn’t say anything on that.
The little hope begins to shrivel up and die and Sam says; “Either you bring— you bring our world Castiel here, safe and healthy, or me and Dean? You’re going to be reaping two new souls very, very soon.”
Sam clicks his tongue in agreement, and Other-Them just shake their heads. “Look, whatever. This, this ‘mating glands’ or ‘scenting bands’ or whatever aren’t going to, like, mess anything up, right?” Other-Dean nods in approval when Sam and Dean both say the affirmative, and then he goes to leave, before freezing, staring at Dean’s neck.
Dean doesn’t know what to say, really, in the end, and instead he just lets out a shaky breath, massaging at his forehead as he tries to think of some kind of reason, some kind of excuse that would make sense.
. Besides, after this, we’ll have an entire half year to figure out how to get actual suppressants made.” Dean shakes his head and then forces a smile. “Besides, look at the bright side — if Chuck actually does kill the world, it’s not like I’m going to need them anyway.”
When he, finally, leaves the room, he can already feel plans writhing under his skin, he can already think of ten different ways to try and solve the whole ‘mated but not mated’ thing that don’t include death, and seven for the ‘heat and ruts without suppressants’ — unfortunately, all of the latter include some form of alcohol, which couldn’t be sustainable. But still, Sam’s busy. So it’s understandable that he loses track of where he’s going and bumps into her.
There’s silence on the other end and Dean frowns, saving the half-completed list of grades for his students, already anticipating the emails he’ll get and instead giving his full focus to Sam.
Of course, he doesn’t mean it, but he still stands his ground when Billie stares at him and then laughs — cold, shrill — and says, “My, my, look at you, standing your ground. Don’t worry, a suicide pact isn’t necessary. Just think of this as… my gift to you.” She winks, and then just before she raises her scythe, she says, “Oh, and by the way, make sure to tell Sam — the other Sam — what I’m doing. I think he’d like to know.”
“Yeah… didn’t, for a while there, but I think he’s sticking around this time…” Other-Dean trails off, lost in thought, before shaking his head. “Anyway, Sam ‘n’ them’ll arrive in a few minutes, and then we can talk about…” he waves his arm vaguely in the air, “…this.”
So he watches raptly Other-Them look at each other, trading glances before looking at Other-Cas. “Not sure if Billie would even let us, with her ‘rules’,” Other-Him finally mutters, and Other-Dean’s face pinches uncomfortably.
Dean nods to himself, massaging his forehead. “Same here. I can’t even begin to describe how insufferable they were before I told them about you.” There’s a muffled agreement, and Dean continues. “So what, you guys were ‘having a business meeting?’” It sounds ridiculous, even to him. “There’s literally no way I can spin it without them thinking I’m desperately trying to protect you or something.”
“I’m going to check out the books that… other-you mentioned, try to figure out what hellhole we landed in.” Dean gets up, shaking his head. “God that’s weird to say,” he murmurs, and Sam just looks at him out of the corner of his eye, trying to gauge what he should do. When Jess and Eileen had died Dean had been there for him, and now he wants to help Dean back. Still, Dean’s acting like nothing’s wrong, even going as far as seeming to consciously try to stifle his scent.
Other-Them look at them curiously even as Sam shoots Dean a worried look — if Other-Sam was as attuned to to his brother as Sam was, then Other-Them should’ve noticed the way Dean was sweating, how he was clenching and unclenching his right hand under the table, the only sign of pain that he would allow himself. Although Sam understood what Dean was saying, this time there were two of them — instead of normally pushing through like they normally would, maybe they could rest and let the
like Dean and Cas call and text regularly, Dean thinks the last time he’s actually reached out to Cas through his phone was almost six months ago. As far as Cas knows they’ve already hammered out the kinks in their plan for the wedding, so technically, there should be no reason for Dean to call him. Then again, there should’ve been no reason for Sam to call
Sam takes in a shaky breath, and then talks, voice tense. “Have you talked to Cas recently?” he begins, and Dean’s shackles immediately go up. It’s been almost five years since his and Cas’s weird arrangement got started in the first place, and of the very short list of people that know about it, Sam is not on it.
He wondered, too, about the people and how they related to each other. A year was a long time, and many of these people had been here longer. How many of them were here with partners? What were the rules about sex? If he found someone to indulge with, would Cas feel it through their bond? He stole a sidelong glance at Cas, feeling the back of his neck heat up.
Charlie bounded up to him and made to pounce on his back. Her discipline would improve once they were farther from Willow River, but for now any risks were small. Dean flattened at the last moment so that she sailed right over his back. It was but a moment to pin her to the ground, his massive paw covering nearly her entire rib cage. He rumbled at her in mock warning.
“We can leave some for scavengers, too, the parts that aren’t easily butchered.” Dean knew how to use most of an animal. He was taught that if you had to take a life, not to be wasteful. “Pelt is nice. Do you tan hides back at the settlement?”
Cas nodded. “I will help with the bags; they are more than a little heavy. We will also want to separate out the supplies before everyone arrives on the doorstep to claim what they requested.” His voice faded away as he headed out after Charlie.
“Ah. My invitation has finally been accepted,” she crooned. “You have come to me. Come closer, Dean. It is Dean, isn’t it?”
Why wasn't Cas awake yet? He should be awake by now. Maybe it was too much, too soon. He'd nearly exhausted his magical reserves in healing Bobby, and then pursued Dean long before he'd replenished himself. Dean swallowed hard against a surge of guilt. He should have stayed back in Willow River, rather than storming off after the bear. He should have realized Cas would never let him go alone. This was all his fault. If Cas didn't wake up soon... or ever?
Thinking of Sam made his heart ache. He missed his little brother. From the day he’d been born they were nearly inseparable, especially once it became clear that Sam was a Witch rather than a Familiar. He’d never admitted it anyone, but there were times he was disappointed he and Sam hadn’t chosen a permanent bond. They’d have been good together, but Sam? Sam was a romantic. He’d wanted the chance at a mated bond pairing, rather than a fraternal bond.
“Smoky?” Dean asked, accepting the rope and tugging the blue roan along out of the livery stable. Act calm, and eventually they would settle, figure out he wouldn’t harm them. “Don’t tell me the chestnut is named ‘Red?”
Eventually Dean got Sam in a headlock, holding it just long enough to confirm his victory before releasing him.
“I suppose... I suppose that should depend on my final objective, yes?” He looked at Dean questioningly. “The technique to obtaining brief physical gratification must surely be different than that used in service of a more permanent alliance.”
It’s obvious from the tone of voice that that wasn’t fun, but Sam has to admit, Dean has a point. It’s not like they have extra suppressants to help them out. Still—
Sam blinks at him and then puts a half-smile on his face, not sure how to respond to that. He isn’t quite sure what it means to be ‘sick’ but he’s guessing it’s similar to being in heat (or, God forbid, rut), so he shrugs and finds the lemons and begins grating them. A few moments later Other-Him awkwardly clears his throat and walks forward, reaching out to, presumably, help grating the lemons.
He says it nonchalantly but it’s obvious that it’s a loaded mine because no one says anything, almost holding their breath as a group and waiting for Other-Dean-and-Cas’s reactions. They don’t say anything, and then Other-Dean pauses, staring at Dean. “I’m not gay.”
“I suppose he thinks I’m cheating on you?” Cas snorts, and from the clatter in the background Dean thinks he’s at Benny’s restaurant for dinner or something. If it was two years ago he’d ask for Cas to put an order in for him but they’d tried the ‘actually dating’ thing and that had ended
On his way there he finds Other-Cas, apparently having slunk away from the library at some point during Sam’s conversation with himself, apparently coming from the dead end hallway that Dean’s room’s in. He’s tempted to stop and see what the hell happened, or break into a sprint and rush to find Dean, but Other-Cas gives him one look and nods soberly and Sam shakes his head. There’s no reason to get worked up.
There’s another silence, this one seeming to bear down on Dean too, and he finds himself gripping his pen tighter as he waits for the inevitable answer.
, Sam responds in a flick of his eyes, and then both of them look at each other with frustration while Other-Them pause and look back with furrowed eyebrows.
It’s obvious that Charlie is a sore subject and so Sam doesn’t bring her up, ignoring the way his own heart pangs at the fact that their own Charlie had chosen to stay behind in that world, spending her final moments with Kara by her side.
They get out, and it seems that Other-Them’ve talked something out because they’re no longer in the War Room, instead sorting through the bookshelves and pulling out books seemingly at random.
Sam nods, but the pit in his stomach only grows. He wasn’t sure how much Cas in this universe would affect Dean, but the best possible scenario would be nothing happening, which would almost be worse than Cas being dead in this world. “I’ll go wake up Dean.”
“What about— would our—'' Other-Him clears his throat before continuing, speaking the rest of the sentence in one breath. “I mean, we’d obviously have to check it with him, but— would our Cas — our world Cas, sorry — work to— to help?”
Other-Cas was squinting, eyes focusing on Dean and probably making it worse as he gave all his attention to him. Sam himself could only imagine what was going on with Dean—your mate, in another world or not, smelling unmated? Rejecting your scent bond? That was tantamount to saying no at the altar and then throwing acid on the mate’s face, according to people back in their world. Dean was already beginning to look sick, and Sam could only think it would get worse the longer they stayed there.
On his way there, he passes the library again, and this time he’s struck by the change in mood — Other-Dean and Other-Cas, while before easily stepping in the others’ ‘personal space’, are as far away from each other as possible, with Other-Dean seeming to have been staring at the same page in the textbook for the past ten minutes and Other-Cas sneaking glances at him. All in all, the tension in the air could be cut with a knife, and while Sam would normally get up in their business about it this isn’t his world so he just shoots them a look and glances at Other-Him, who’s staring at Other-Dean-and-Cas with narrowed eyes.
“Dean,” Charlie grabbed his attention. “Go back to the house. Cas is right. I’ll finish up here then join you at home.”
That’s when he and Rufus weren’t out scouting, of course. It seemed the average scouting trip lasted between five and seven days, depending on the objective. Jody Mills kept the less experienced scouts closer to hand, but Bobby and Rufus were their most experienced pair and usually took the longer trips. Jody enforced a week recovery between scouting trips.
“It’s bigger than it looks from here,” Gabe answered. “Big enough for a few small gardens inside, and some livestock. We get most of our food from fishing and hunting, but we’ve got a few chickens and pigs, even a couple milk cows, and then there are the stables for the horses, and an enclosure. Charlie’s really good at catching fish.” He directed an affectionate smile towards her. “We do some foraging. That’s less predictable, but we know where the good spots are.”
As long as they had that much time, Dean could afford to make the effort to give his belongings a thorough wash. He pulled clean clothes out of one of his trunks and got to work.
Cas took a moment before turning towards him and taking the pack. He sighed, ran his hand lightly over Dean’s head. Somehow it was easier to touch when Dean was a cat.
He dug his claws into the stone, hard enough that he was certain he was actually penetrating the surface, and tugged at the tendril linking him with Cas, giving him a quick warning before surrendering, opening himself completely to Amara — and to Cas.
Charlie glanced off towards Walt, who stood over near the Water gate, arms crossed and glaring at Dean. “I don’t know that’s such a great idea.”
Still he hesitated. He didn’t want to leave Cas alone. The rumble of hunger from his stomach is what finally convinced him. “Take good care of him for me, Charlie.”
“Here’s hoping we never have to repeat the experience, but any time, Dean.” She smiled at him, tinged with sorrow. “It was the very least I could do. Now. You go take care of this Witch of yours and don’t worry about a single other thing the rest of the night.” She pulled them both into a hug before turning around and leaving.
“I’ll shift, it won’t affect me the same. It will be better for our bond anyhow. You’re going to need all the help you can get.”
Dean waited patiently, only making a shallow cut along his left arm when Cas had finally done the same. Cas wrapped the fingers of his right hand around Dean's left wrist, holding it steady as he brought his own left wrist forward, pressing them together as he spoke the words of the first level binding incantation.
Dean nodded. “Easier that way.” He offered a small smile as he accepted a mug of coffee from Cas. He looked away again fairly quickly when Cas smiled back at him.
Times like that, Dean would just Shift. Cats weren’t fussy the same way. A bit of rough ground was nothing. Human skin bruised so easily. Charlie had done a decent job laying the bedrolls down, however, Dean didn’t have a single distraction to keep him from watching Cas.
Edging his hand lower, Dean’s fingertips just brushed against wiry curls when pounding at the door made him jump. “Fuck!” he exclaimed, jumping back.
“I was excited about the prospect, honestly. My studies were quite clear that being partnered with a Familiar was important for working the most interesting magic. I’d done some small partnering, with some of the Familiars associated with the Angelus family, but never the same person more than a handful of times.”
By the time Cas mounted up and rode through the gates, he was an hour behind Dean. He couldn’t sense whatever it was that Dean was tracking, but he could track Dean. He set Smoky southwest at a brisk pace, hoping to close the distance. Exhaustion pulled at him, but so far the adrenaline counteracted it. Pulling Bobby back from the brink of death was no small feat. Dean was a rock the entire time, having fed him a constant stream of magic. He had also been projecting a constant aura of worry and anger. Cas would have predicted this, if he hadn’t been so worn down he could barely put one foot in front of the other.
“We didn’t when you left,” Gabe corrected. “Added it while you were gone, on the back of the house. Can’t expect Dean to share with Charlie the way Nora did. People would get uptight about that.”
“I’m…” Cas cleared his throat, cheeks flushed. He was thankful that the bond was more muted when his Familiar was in human form; it allowed him to pretend Dean had no notion of what was going through his mind. The small quirk at the corner of Dean’s lips said quite clearly that Dean did have a notion. This was not the time to pursue that track, either way. “I’m fine.”
Cas reflexively hugged him back, spitting out a mouthful of dark hair. Garth handed him straight into Bess’ embrace, and from there he was passed around at a dizzying pace. He lost track of who was hugging him or clapping him on the shoulder with heartfelt words of welcome. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Dean likewise being passed from person to person. Ellen hugged him first, then smacked him upside the head. Cas vaguely heard something about ‘damn fool, racing off alone like that. Don’t care if you’re a cougar, still a stupid move.’
“Yeah,” Dean replied. “We sort of accidentally, sort of on purpose full-bonded. The temporary bond was blood and incantation, right? There was a little bit of accidental blood this time, other sorts of fluid exchanges, and a whole lot of chanting.”
Just as soon as it came it disappeared, the lights returning to their golden glow, and Sam still pauses, shaking his head and then walking to what he and Dean had figured was a guest bedroom. He almost knocks on the door before he realizes it was already open a smidge and walks inside, seeing Dean sit on the bed, staring at the wall.
take care of it. And if Other-Them had half the brain cells Dean and Sam already did, they would realize that too.
“Dude, no,” he says, sounding almost distracted. “they gotta figure it out for themselves or I'm gonna freak out. Him. That me.”
It doesn’t seem like Sam’s figured it out — on the contrary, he seems almost pitying, which is definitely not what Dean expected, compared to Charlie and Gabriel’s reactions. “What would be easier?” he prompts, chewing on his lip.
, Dean says with a swig of his beer, and he shoots Sam a cheesy wink that lets him pretend, for a second, that they’re back home and just doing another case for old time’s sake. “Yeah, we’re brothers, but that’s from our child designations. When we were both boys? And, by the way, what the hell’s a ‘male’?”
,” Other-Him says, and it looks like both the other Winchesters had problems with volume because it seemed to have come out much louder than he had intended.
“—you know what, this is going nowhere,” Other-Him interjects, and he stands up, continuing. “Dean and I need to go for something, but I guess this is… perfect, really. Just stay behind if Chuck decides to pop in and see what the Winchesters are up to in this episode. You guys cool with that?”
She looks him up and down, her eyes pausing on the virgin mating gland on his neck, before continuing just as Sam was about to try and leave. “Y’know, that little trick you and your brother pulled almost broke the wards here in the bunker — I was tempted to just get rid of you there and then before you guys called Chuck and rained hellfire down on us all.”
Dean’s phone’s ringing off the hook, and he has no fucking clue why. He loves Sam, but holy shit the amount of pre-wedding jitters he has around his upcoming nuptials almost makes Dean wonder if he should try and get him to a doctor’s appointment because he’s been to his fair share of weddings and can’t remember anyone being this nervous. Still, there’s almost nothing right now that should be cause for alarm, even for Sam — Dean's already confirmed like ten times that
Other-Dean finally clears his throat, leaning forward. “I’m guessing you guys know who Cas is? Jack’s… resting, and I figure from Sam you guys do have
“He’s an Alpha, I’m an Omega — that’s about as heteronormative as it gets. Believe me, I’m not gay either.” Dean snorts, but he’s staring down Other-Dean now, and Sam can’t help but notice how Other-Cas doesn’t say anything, just looking at Other-Dean with something almost like curiosity in his eyes.
“And you’re Sam Winchester,” she says, and her voice — low, careful — already puts him on edge. He shifts his stance, slightly, and ignores the whiff of sulfur in the air again — at this point, he’s wondering if he’s smelling his own scent, which would be both annoying and a useless side effect of the world he didn’t need.
Cas — what with Other-Dean and the rest of the fucking gender-less world, it was going to be a goddamned nightmare.
“You’re right, Sam, I do have a plan,” she says after a beat. “Here it is. You and Dean and Castiel? Your world Castiel, sorry.” She adds, and something twinkles in her eye when Sam’s heartbeat speeds up, when something all too close to
Dean—’s right, Dean and I’ll go, find some small town to hole up in while you guys… work things out with— with ‘Billie’.” Even as Sam gets up he can tell that Other-Them won’t let go so quickly, especially with the little they knew about the change in ‘genders’, and so he just watches with a sinking stomach as Other-Them exchange glances and stand up too — fighting would be idiotic at this point, so it’s practically already a loosing battle.
“Remember how I said I was mated?” Dean says, straightening his back and taking his weight away from the beam for a moment even though it must’ve been hell as the attention’s brought to him. “Yeah, I was mated to Cas. Our world Cas.”
Cas turned as quickly as he could, but not before he caught an eyeful of toned limbs, freckle-spangled shoulders, delicious musculature tapering down to—no. No, no, no.
Dean stirred, slowly waking up, feeling more well-rested than he had in… well, in recent memory. His cheek was pressed against Cas’ shoulder. He turned his head slightly to press a soft kiss against the warm skin, smiling to himself at the tiny pulse of contentment flowing back through the bond. “I could get used to this,” he murmured, barely audible.
“We are talking about the lightning, now, and not my theoretical nudity?” Cas asked. “More than likely, yes. Correctly interpreting it? Not so much. We need to return.”
into the earth to find and tie off the vein feeding the corruption, then searing it with a sudden blinding surge of pure energy.
Dean sprang to his feet and headed over to the base of the lookout tower. “Rockville courier?” Dean asked Pamela. She was one of their best shots, so got more time up in the tower than she would strictly prefer.
The land slowly morphed from tree-spotted grasslands to forested hills. They were forced to abandon the stream as terrain became more difficult to navigate. As the sun descended towards the horizon, Dean angled them back towards the stream and possible campsites.
A predatory smile crossed her lips, quickly controlled. She stepped forward, crouched down to his level. “Aren’t you a beauty. Look at those eyes. Beautiful.” She reached out, but her hand passed right through his head.
“You should expect a bit of a party tonight, to welcome you,” Gabe said. “We don’t get new people very often. Cassie coming back would be reason enough to gather tonight. Having fresh blood too? Definitely expect to see most of the population at the saloon tonight.”
Cas glanced to the side, biting his lower lip. “Dean. I hope that your expectations for Willow River are not too high,” he finally said. “It is very much a rough outpost. There are barely trails, let alone roads. The population is small, the inhabitants… rough around the edges.”
Dean rocked back on his heels and watched. He figured he was there mostly to hand items over. If Bobby needed help, he would tell him. “Surprised Gabe didn’t end up with a nail through the forehead.”
Cas gritted his teeth. “Right.” He waved his hand towards the bottle of whiskey. “Help yourself. Is there anyone here you would… want to be open to it?”
Dean nodded once, studying Cas’ face and paying attention to whatever emotions leaked through their bond. He didn’t know how Cas was going to take it. Being a Campbell wasn’t something he was ashamed of, exactly. Most of the time. He had serious disagreements with how Samuel Campbell went about his business, but go back a few generations farther and there were plenty of ancestors he could be proud to be descended from.
Gabe arched a brow, clearly surprised by the depth of Dean’s knowledge, but he didn’t argue that point. “Old sigils don’t prove a thing about this Witch being the source of the corruption. It’s a theory only.”
Cas reached over to smooth the furrow of worry between Dean’s brows away. Dean pushed into the touch, much like the cat he was just below the surface. “I am not upset. Rather the opposite, actually.” He picked up Dean’s hand and brushed a kiss against his knuckles. “Especially as we somehow managed not to rip our pants to shreds. You may be able to shift and walk back to camp with your dignity intact. I need pants at a bare minimum to achieve the same.”
Dean gripped the back of Cas’ neck and pulled him in for another open-mouthed kiss. They’d been so careful about touching each other to this point. Now there was no holding back.
Dean smiled at that. “Thanks, Cas.” He reached behind his neck and rubbed. “It wouldn’t even necessarily be them, you know? Samuel would just take the highest bidder, and that’s not the way it’s supposed to be. A Witch/Familiar partnership is supposed to be a
“Damn straight I am,” Dean agreed. He poked at the fire with a stick. “No point in stretching the truth about it, though. You’ll find the truth soon enough. And your ass has already hit the dirt, so there’s that.” He grinned.
He nodded. “Yes. The question is if she can control her desire for you.” His hand tightened around Dean’s.
Dean shuddered, his fur rippling from his neck back to the base of his tail. Cas felt the apprehension settle and shift into determination.
The wind shifted, bringing with it a new and different scent. Dean lifted his nose, flaring his nostrils. This smell was like nothing he’d ever encountered before. It had a sour tang to it, a sharpness that made him growl involuntarily, his tail twitching.
“New thing we learned this morning. Not even Ellen can stop Dean when he has his mind set on something. Donna is saddling Smoky for you, and Ellen is getting together some provisions for the road. We’re hoping you have better luck in turning him right back around, but preparing for the worst just in case.”
“Wouldn’t mind a couple departures,” Rufus commented, pointing with his chin in the direction of the waste trenches. “Sometimes I wonder why certain people stay.”
“Sainte Mireille is a good spot to disappear,” Charlie volunteered. “I thought so, anyhow. As long as you avoid the South Quarter.”
“Yeah, smart move. I would have been... well. Annoyed, to put it mildly. Whether or not I’d have been annoyed enough to head right back east, I don’t know. Probably not to New Avalon, but I might have chosen to disappear somewhere else entirely.”
“Drop them anywhere,” Bobby said as he stopped in front of the burlap curtain in front of Dean’s room and set his toolbox down. “Floor is rough enough no one is going to notice an extra ding or two.”
A lean-to? “What do you mean by a lean-to?” Dean asked, alarmed. It sounded like that’s where they expected him to live. Sure, Willow River was a rough settlement, but there were still buildings. Plenty of buildings. All over.
“How much did Cassie tell you on the trip?” Gabe asked as the group started on the way back towards the stockade.
In fairness, there were times that a Familiar could take advantage of an unsuspecting Witch as well. There were reasons that contracts were considered partnerships rather than servitude.
Dean stood up again, moved to the small window and looked outside. “This is kind of a weird conversation, isn’t it.” The trickle of emotion that usually flowed between them closed off. Cas looked up sharply. Dean was shutting him out?
He and Charlie were staying. There was still corruption to clean up after all, and neither of them were too interested in visiting New Avalon. Besides, Charlie was enjoying getting to know Ellen’s daughter Jo who had returned to the outpost to visit her mom.
Cas’ brows drew low at that. He stood abruptly and walked towards the horses. “We should be hitting the trail.”
Dean flashed her a smile. “Thank you.” Efficiency in the kill was important. His mother had spent a great deal of time and effort teaching him how to hunt the right way. Honoring prey meant killing swiftly, with as little suffering as possible.
“Politics and business don’t appeal to me any more than they did to my mother.” He failed to entirely suppress a shudder of distaste. “Look, Mr. Angelus, it seems it would be in both of our interests to cut through the posturing and get to the point. You’re right, I’m a Campbell through my mother, and my grandfather isn’t inclined to forget that. He’s been approached repeatedly by various Witches inquiring about the availability of Campbell Familiars for potential contracts or bonding, and he refuses to stop including my name when making partnership arrangements. He is becoming more and more insistent. The contractual terms on offer are quite lucrative.”
“Where did you even learn how to, city boy?” Gabe asked as he watched Dean work with easy confidence.
“Okay.” He intended to take that to heart. She was right; it was difficult not to be curious. Curiosity was alright, he supposed, so long as he didn’t act on it. There were so many things he was curious about. A lot of them centered around Castiel Angelus. Their lawyer cousin Balthazar hadn’t told him much about the circumstances that sent Cas and Gabe out to the frontier. Apparently he hadn’t told Cas and Gabe much about his own circumstances, either, which he had to reluctantly admire. Mr. Angelus the lawyer surely owed more allegiance to his own kin than he did to a random Familiar he happened to sign to a Witch/Familiar limited contract, sight unseen by the Witch.
And then Castiel felt it -- that little pulse and shimmer along the arcane thread connecting them, a surge of power on the astral plane, deeper and richer somehow than what Nora had exhibited. Castiel shivered at the visceral power rolling through him. When it finished passing through it left a subliminal hum behind.
Cas struggled with the idea of continuing on or returning for Gabe and Charlie. They have made it this far, what would be the harm in scouting this area they hadn’t explored before? Now that he felt more awake and aware, his curiosity was engaged.
“The coach wasn’t as late as I thought it might be,” Cas said. “Gabriel, Charlie… this is Dean Winchester. Dean, my brother, Gabriel Angelus, and his Familiar, Charlie Bradbury.”
Amara might want Dean, but there were no guarantees she wouldn’t take Charlie or Jess before she could get to him.
Life swiftly went back to normal after their return to Willow River. The supply run had been successful, so the community storage shed was full, and set to become more so after harvest. Taking care of winter prep between attacks by Amara was a challenge, but they made it work, somehow.
Cas had the very strong suspicion that this was the ‘extra wrong’ the two of them had been pursuing. This woman, whomever she was, trapped by Witches of the distant past. He stepped backwards slowly, pulling Dean along with him. Slowly enough, he hoped, that she would not notice and make another attempt to pull power from Dean. Cas suspected that Dean’s protective charm was the only thing that had prevented her from taking over the Familiar entirely.
