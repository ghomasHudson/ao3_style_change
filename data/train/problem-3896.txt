“It was not a fucking list, Sammy. It was a code. The only ingredient normally written was the sugar. And you know who would put sugar absolutely everywhere?” Dean asked
At lunch time, they were all desperate. Even Dean, who was basically trying to see the good in this situation, was starting to lose hope. He was the first one to slam his book on the table, and stand up.
Rowena listened, sipping whisky on a comfortable chair, right next to Dean. She did not speak, not even after he went quiet, looking for any reaction from the witch. But she didn’t give him any, she stayed silent and finished her whisky, taking her time. This behavior was driving Dean insane, he wanted her to say something, to comfort him, to tell him he was an idiot, anything really.
“Yeah, reading again. I can’t wait.” said Dean with a sarcastic tone.
The way he acted actually helped Jack a lot, and the blond boy just started smiling as they were talking about how it would go. Dean never had had his soul touched, but from what he heard, it was incredibly painful. Not that it would stop him anyway, he had been tortured in hell for four decades, had died multiple time, had been severely injured a few times… It was not pain he feared, it was his possible death, the possible failure they could come across. But once again, those concerns were drowned in the faith he put on Jack. He was Cas’ son, he could do anything if not more, and he knew that Jack would never hurt him on purpose, so he didn’t have to worry.
“No... I don’t think so... I don’t feel like I have my power, but... There is something, I don’t know what it is… But I can feel it now, there is something…”
After several hours, the Bunker was finally in sight. They were home, even though they would probably have to leave again in a few days, because they never stayed in the place long, it was good being there again. When they entered the place, Dean found it really strange not to be greeted by his dog, but he had decided to leave him at Jody’s place for a time, since they would probably have to do a lot of dumb and dangerous things, it was easier to have him in a safe place. And him being away had for other consequence to keep Claire safe too, because she would be too occupied taking care of the dog, and Dean was glad. They all wanted to involve less people possible, and not only because it could compromise their plan of surprising God with their fight back, but also because they wanted their friends to be safe.
“Can I kiss you again?”
“Of course, Clarence, I’m obviously here at this bar for no other reason than to solve your puzzles. You’re absolutely not wasting
Dean turns momentarily to lift a brow at Cas. “You’ve gotta say it,” he says.
Oh, Cas damn well knows the answer to that question. Smug bastard.
“I think I’ve known since I was about fifteen,” Cas says casually, as if this effortless lie and change in script wouldn’t make Dean do a double take.
“Dean and I are dating, and we’re in love,” he announces again clumsily, matching Dean’s hysterical loudness from earlier, “which I guess means you two are no longer...dating? But not because of you or your son. You’re both great, but Dean is gay.” He gestures his free hand at himself. “For me. What I mean to say is—”
Cas stares out the window, thinking of one person he wishes he deserved. Clearly, the universe disagreed otherwise he would be in a different body or Dean would be open to the idea of men. He rebukes himself for the thought immediately because what he has with Dean is already more than friendship. It’s profound. Cas is lucky that Dean offers him so much of himself to Cas as it is.
He kicks him gently on his shin. “I’m making you ratatouille. A salad isn’t going to sustain you but you still need to eat some vegetables.”
, we certainly did not work out the logistics of the lie, the timeframe of the pretence, or—”
Cas acts mock-offended as he takes the space next to Dean that Sam had previously occupied.
“Everybody and their mom knows.”
“You certainly do,” Cas reproaches, nudging Dean’s knee with his. “Now what do you want for dinner?”
“People realise it at different times all the time. People accept things at different speeds,” Dean retorts. Benny must have done something with his face then because Dean groans aloud. “I wasn’t talking about
“Benny. I’ve gotta tell you something, man.” Dean feels like he’s flying blind and he balls his free hand into a fist against his thigh to ground himself. He can hear the terror in his own voice, fracturing like splinters into the air.
He strides towards the couple with Cas step-by-step beside him.
of my time tonight, which I have allotted to picking up a guy.”
“Do you mind?”
Dean laughs.
“Come on, sunshine, just a little taste.”
It’s still gratifying. It’s still pretty damn marvellous actually. He can’t think of a time where his lips had ever grazed against stubble before, but it feels…good.
“Why the fuck are you going to a bar by yourself?” he snaps a little too aggressively.
Dean smirks, because Cas rolling his eyes is cute. Cas looking dryly exasperated in such a ‘Cas’ kind of way is always something that tugs at Dean’s heartstrings.
“Cas, stop acting like you’re my friggin’ wife.”
“Wha—?”
“Well, you’re going to have to get used to it,” says Cas, as casually as he can muster. “I’m watching movies at her place on Friday too.”
“Dean, please. Listen to me. It’s fine.”
He turns his head minutely and blinks. Meg is doddering from one foot to another like she’s hopping on coals. This is obviously very uncomfortable for her.
After dinner, the dinner which Dean keeps picking at until there’s only half a portion left and they end up just picking at the rest with their fingers and eating standing in the kitchen, they meander in a sleepy direction towards Dean’s bedroom.
“If you aren’t returning to that place again, perhaps you can go to Bobby’s after all. I’m sure he’ll take you in and protect you from your father,” Cas proposes, tentative. “It’s got to be better than living out of this car.”
“Okay,” he replies, frowning. “I’m sorry. You asked some questions and I thought it would be most efficient to give you the one answer that fits all. I never expected you to reciprocate.”
Charlie and Dean are quarrelling in Dean’s room. About Cas.
Dean feels his chest puff a bit with pride and quickly rebound with bewilderment. There’s a bounce of giddiness hopping inside him at Cas’ tentative credence in the plan, though it’s also directed at something
Cas’ heart clenches.
A list of Dean’s must-wear ‘protective gear’ is narrated to him while they eat their breakfast together. Dean remains adamant on bringing only himself and his tools like a normal human being to Cas’ chagrin.
Flustered, Cas wrestles with the door for a few seconds himself.
“You don’t really notice much,” Cas goes to point out in jest with a lopsided smile. “You’re about as perceptive as a blind eyeball.”
Cas hugs his knees to his chest, smiling uncontrollably.
“Why would you tell me?” Dean eventually yells, “Why the hell would you say this now? Now? We don’t have time to deal with something like this! We’ve not even dealt with the million other things going on with us before. And then there’s the world decaying all around us. There’s Sammy. Now it’s—it’s another thing now. The biggest fucking thing between us now, I’d say! Why would you say it? You know I can’t. We can’t. I’m not—I’m not—” Every part of his body, even his organs, feel like they’re trembling. “I’m not even fucking gay, Cas.”
Cas knows why.
“Sure. Okay.”
“I see where this is going and you need to stop—”
He gets perhaps three minutes of restful tranquility before his window flies open to disturb the peace.
“Did we really ever establish boundaries?” Dean asks. “What the fuck are we? Are we just gonna fuck and that’ll be it?”
“We started all of this so I would have a good excuse to break up with Lisa. Meg staving off Cas was also a good bonus. It just—it just spiralled. It’s all pretend.”
Cas goes to say something then pauses once his eyes land around the area of Dean’s crotch.
He chucks a set of his loungewear at Dean, and Dean, for the life of him, can’t come up with one good reason as to why Cas is being a little cold to him. He sluggishly dresses himself, his high from their intimate moment already shrivelling away.
“Do you want me to drop you home or at Gabe’s?” Dean asks glumly, reversing effortlessly out the parking lot with one hand on the wheel.
“Who the fuck puts onions in their pasta?”
“Hell, no!” Garth booms, smacking the table with gumption and bounding forwards like an excited puppy. “This is great! You two are awesome together!”
Dean shoulders past Cas and almost runs straight into Sam as he’s leaving the apartment, safety goggles and a water bottle and car keys in hand.
It’s more trivial annoyance than he’s felt in awhile during the drinking, the apathy, and the anger of the past few months. He relishes it a little.
“I’d share anything with you, Dean,” Cas says seriously, and they’re back to that impassioned piece of deep staring, the cheesy-ass Hallmark shit Sam doesn’t shut up about. Dean gets it now. There’s something very intimate about the way Cas looks at him, and in the way that Dean looks back until it gets too weird and he can’t anymore.
“What?” he says dumbly.
When Dean touches him, embraces him, cuddles into him, places a kiss by his temple or one on his jaw, he no longer quivers with want and desire. It’s with a bored roll of the eyes and a flirtatious
“Hey, look, I’m sorry, man. Okay? We good?” he asks awkwardly.
“I should…go.” He looks at Cas apologetically once before stumbling out the room.
Cas starts unbuttoning his way down until a sharp intake of breath from Dean stops him.
sake—”
He associates this kind of kiss with domesticity and husbands and honey, I’m home.
Bobby made a flyaway comment about it a few months later and Dean’s now been enlisted, along with Benny and a couple of other guys from the garage, to fix it in a week from now.
“I told her there’s nobody else I want to share my life with but you,” Cas continues faintly, “I told her that I’m in love with you.”
“We’re all the same age, don’t call us boys,” Cas snips cattily in a mood that only Dean would usually adopt.
“Dean,” Cas pleads as they round down the stairs.
“Excuse me?” Dean demands.
“We’re out of patties, and I’m making burgers tonight. Sam and Eileen got caught up in a storm yesterday, so they won’t be back until later this evening. We can all sit down, and—I dunno—have a family meal I guess.”
Castiel makes another irritated sound as he lifts himself up from the booth to sit upright. “Dean. I was talking about Dean. Dean isn’t—”
“Well,” Castiel huffs, “I think it may have been easier to get through to you if I were to participate in your favourite vernaculars.”
“Aren’t we?” Cas repeats, a little more hollowly this time.
“Um—yes—I…I’ll wait here. For you.”
“Actuallty, the primitive men of the Palaeolithic era were rather advanced for the age of creation they inhibited, and they began quite impressive stone tool developments for—”
Benny is shoved away for the second time as Dean propels through him. He looks barely bothered by the intrusion, only sapped and fatigued.
“Dean, are you alright?”
Now he regrets this entire night because he’s sobering up and his ears are perked, awaiting Dean’s response despite already knowing the answer to Benny’s question.
“Brother…” Benny says in the most empathetic timbre Cas has ever heard on the man, “if you won’t accept…if you can’t let yourself want anything more yet…you also can’t be acting like there is more. This is going to spiral into something fantastically stupid and that stupid thing is going to blow up in both your faces. It’s also just going to drag out an ache that won’t be pacifiable.”
“Is he...is going to...tell other people?”
The boy beams cheekily at Castiel and they swap their goods.
A round of cutlery clanks around the table. Garth knocks over his glass of water. Suddenly all eyes are pointed at him like they’re waiting for the punchline.
“Meh,” Dean shrugs. One hand remains on the steering wheel while the other blindly reaches for Cas’. It’s met instantly and Dean laces their fingers together.
“Looks and sounds a bit like I’m very much your type right now, buddy,” he adds hoarsely, overcompensating by just a little.
“Oh—um—you don’t have to—”
“It’s never going to click with anyone for me, is it?” Dean had muttered, biting at the skin of his thumb. Cas remembers this because he had stared too hard. “I’m not even sure what being in love feels like. The only person I—forget it. I’m happy, I’m happy, but shit—I’m gonna die alone.”
“Sartre chopped amphetamines,” Cas corrects with a hint of a smile, “but brownie points for knowing who he is.”
“A dad like mine, yeah.” Dean pauses then splutters. “Wait,
“It’s fine. I still have you.”
“Well, that makes you dafter than I pegged you for. That boy’s been pining for you since you were about yea high.” Bobby brings his straightened hand to his chest.
“Aw, Cas, I’m sure your cooking isn’t crap.”
don’t really notice much,” Dean counters belatedly. He murmurs this in a much lower pitch than they’d been talking in, sending gooseflesh up Cas’ arms and his eyes back up to meet Dean’s.
“If you’re sure...”
“You’re still here,” Sam says with some relief, getting closer to Cas and engulfing him into a hug. His hand pats Cas a couple times on the back before he releases him. Dean notices with some trouble that Sam’s hugs are a little different to Dean’s when it comes to Castiel, angel of the Lord. It’s very much less like he’s clutching on to oxygen, for breath, for life.
Properly, head over heels, very into his very straight best friend.
Involuntarily, Castiel’s eyes glue onto the boy and his pie. He’s still trembling ever so slightly even as he demolishes the monstrosity before him and his arm is prickled with goose-flesh.
“I’m leaving,” Charlie declares.
Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, it doesn’t seem to upset anyone. It makes them all crack into another set of tittering convulsions.
“You refused to move in with Cassie today so you could keep living with Cas. You broke up with your very serious girlfriend over Cas. Everything you do revolves around Cas.” Charlie’s voice drops to an octave so low that Cas has to strain to hear her. “This isn’t healthy, Dean. You’re leading him on.”
Today he understands. Today Castiel feels so done.
“You’re my ride,” Benny says slowly like he’s explaining basic multiplication to a eight-year-old. “I just went to the bathroom for a second. Were you just going to leave without me?”
” Cas says dryly.
Dean freezes.
“Cas, fine, okay, shut up. I said I was sorry for not listening to you earlier, alright? And coming up with this plan. And being...mean. I thought this would be a lot easier and we could just—I don’t know...go with the flow. I’m sorry I threw away your index cards.”
This is the moment that Cas’ chest caves with more want than he’s allowed himself to feel in almost a decade and also the same moment that a girl with dark brown curls in stilettos and leather trips over where he is sitting.
The looming doom is no longer the end of this pretend, but the end of the close quarters of their friendship. It’s dawned on Dean with a galvanising fear that Cas may be doing this with someone else in the near future. Perhaps not Meg, but definitely someone Dean cannot fit into the mould of.
Cas is hanging in the doorway, meagre and modest as he stares mutely at his entwined hands. They’re good-looking hands, if Dean’s ever really thought about any pair; strong-looking, dusted only lightly with dark hairs, and so tanned, like the rest of him.
Dean aches with want.
“Holy shit,” Dean laughs suddenly, taking Castiel aback. “Man, I haven’t slept for that long or that well—in—well…years.” He peeks at Castiel, eyes blurred from sleep and soft all the same. “Maybe you’re a good sleep aid. Nice—er…cuddle buddy or whatever.”
He looks up at Dean like a deer caught in headlights. “So...”
Cas levels Dean with a look that means last warning.
“I love you. You know this,” Cas says quietly.
Dean reddens somewhat too but he’s still smiling at Castiel. “Yeah. Castiel Winchester. Nice ring to it, huh?”
Castiel’s frustration briefly overleaps his caution with Dean’s troubled sexuality.
“I burned the pot, not the kitchen,” Cas retorts, “and at least I‘ve been stocking our fridge up with more than three items per monthly. I also am an excellent cook now that I have practiced,” he sniffs.
“Do not patronise me or my feelings. I know what I feel. Do you?” Castiel asks icily.
Cas smiles like he’s drunk now. Dean understands. His brain feels soapy and mushy, caught in the haziest fog of roses and fantasies come true.
Cas raises an eyebrow and drags his gaze from Dean’s face downwards along his body.
“You and Cas. More than friendship?”
“Can you…can you pass me my boxers please? They’re at the foot of the bed,” Cas says, rubbing a hand down his face.
“Understandably, I’d imagine it would be quite difficult to find any ornament with the name Castiel decorated on it,” Cas tacks on, lips quirked. “It is somewhat niche.”
He smiles back to Cas’ smile, though both of theirs are trembling.
Dean’s slumped posture straightens. His woozy face clears with bright worry.
Once the implicit confession has leaked through, he feels a grand weight slacken away from his entire corporeal body and mind.
?” Cas demands.
He kisses his cheek adoringly and, with meaning, because he can finally give Cas this admission, he confesses, “I love you. I’m so in love with you. We’ll figure it out together.”
“I’ll walk! You’re making me lose my goddamn mind, Dean!”
Cas’ breath hitches.
“Why wouldn’t ya kiss me?” he mumbles, hurt and confused. “I thought we—you know…”
remember if you have. It smells nice too. He uses this really great responsibly-sourced shampoo that don’t test on animals and stuff, ‘cause you know, he’s all about just…just being the greatest fucking guy. He cares about everything so damn much.”
“I’ll suck you up,” Dean goads to the disgusted groans of his adopted father and friends around the table. Benny goes as far as to chuck a french fry at his head.
“I don’t want it getting wet on our table, and turns out we don’t need it. We don’t mind sharing,” he explains with false cheer.
“Maybe I was trying to get lucky,” Dean responds with a waggle of his brows.
“Everyone’s gone, Dean,” he mutters. “Eileen, Bobby, Charlie, Donna...the whole world.”
but still, it’s someone. Now Sam and Eileen are riding off into the sunset too. I’m happy, man, I’m
Cas’ saliva sticks in his throat. “What—what are you doing?”
“Stop petting Sam like he’s some kind of zoo animal. You’re going to wake him up.”
“We didn’t even get paint,” Dean scowls, “we got stupid fucking chalks. They rub off in, like, a few seconds.”
He still hasn’t managed to control his palpitations when Benny’s voice drills through the crowd.
She bends over, kneels enticingly on the bed, and kisses him briefly before pulling back. Cas wipes his mouth with the back of his hand while she’s turned towards the door. She throws him one last look of lasciviousness prior to bouncing away on her kitten heels.
Cas makes a discomfited noise. “It’s Cas.”
Dean doesn’t reply. Castiel may be wrong, but a comment like that, he believes, requires at least some kind of response.
“Well, you should. You
“Cas?” Dean pesters between gritted teeth. “What were you doing in there with her?”
Dean nods mutely.
It’s his hands which cup Cas’ cheeks first, gentle and reassuring, perhaps a little questioning too.
“We can share,” Dean says shyly. “Can’t we?”
Benny freezes. “You think you what?”
Cas’ lips smack together and he chooses to stay quiet.
“Er—thanks?”
After their intimate romp in his bed—which Dean most
“Oh, Cas,” Sam says sympathetically. His hand clasps onto Cas’ shoulder. “We’re going to fight this together. Your falling, Chuck, everything else the world has to throw at us.” The way they touch also isn’t the same, Dean thinks.
Then Cas implodes on Dean like a cold douse of water over his head.
“What the fuck do you mean, and? I told him to get the fuck over it,” Dean replies angrily, offended that Sam would even need to ask.
, anyway. That’s something to celebrate, right, sunshine?”
“I do
Cas gasps. Dean moans.
Dean sulks, eyes fixed on the road ahead of him. His jaw twitches. “We can—we can turn around. I—I didn’t mean to—”
He dips his head, abashed. “And the chicken—and—and the pasta. Pretty much forgot all the ingredients, heh.”
“No, it doesn’t!” Dean shouts and immediately blanches. His mouth works itself open and shut on override while his thoughts tumble over one another in panic. “I mean yes—not—I don’t—no comment!”
“Jesus, Cas, don’t call it a handyman project—"
Castiel blanches.
“Heaven is dying, I believe…or the smudge of grace returned to me from Metatron is no longer viable to keep me strong. Whichever the case, I am falling. My powers, they…they’ve been fading, weakening. It’s likely I will become fully human soon.”
From his drink arriving to his burger’s demolition to forking at the dregs of his pie, Dean spends this time internally haranguing himself over his fight with Cas. He’s managed to convince himself that Cas will never talk to him again and that he’s going to die alone and that he was deluded to ever think even for a second that their friendship could turn into some big romantic gay love when his phone rings.
He proceeds to chew at his burger and fries ravenously, attacking it angrily like it had done something to him in his past life. Cas sits opposite him quietly, peacefully, sipping occasionally at his milkshake and humming to himself with pleasure each time.
“Nice,” Dean finishes numbly.
Dean can’t think of any excuse that is worth letting Cas go again. There’s no blockages now.
“I’m sorry,” he blurts, “I already forgot what I said, but I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you,” he worries.
When Dean returns, the air between them has changed.
“Don’t be so crude,” Castiel admonishes, starting to regret his impalpable interest in this green-eyed mud monkey.
Cas stares at Dean with absolutely no movement in his face.
“No,” Cas says gently, “it doesn’t because we’re here now. We just drove for over an hour to get some paint for my bauble. I think we’re very much past what happened that many years ago when you couldn’t even admit your feelings for me.”
“Oh my god, you dumbass.”
“Is that really what is bothering you? Because, okay, valid point, and thanks for reminding me of another snowball being thrown at this avalanching disaster, but—”
When she releases him, she kisses him on the cheek like it’s a goodbye. “I think a part of me always knew, Dean, and it’s—it’s okay. You don’t have to be sorry.”
His friend stirs beside him, wriggling closer, nuzzling into Dean’s neck. He is wedged between Dean’s right arm and his side, chin rested atop Dean’s collarbone with a hand splaying over Dean’s chest to prop himself up.
A muffled and surprised sound hums through where their lips touch. He deepens the grazing of their mouths. Cas responds with an enthusiasm that has Dean grinning into their kiss and eventually he’s grinning too widely to continue so vigorously so he inches back to pepper Cas’ jaw with small pecks. It’s a new and thrilling development up until Cas pulls away.
This boy’s parents, Castiel surmises with regret, likely felt the same or had forgotten. Neither options were nice to think about.
. It’s likely the copious amounts of alcohol we drank. I’m sobering up, but I feel as if I’ve consumed an entire liquor store and it’s not pleasant.”
“Dean, this was the same waitress you once offered we, as you say, tag-teamed. Do you not remember? Why are you suddenly upset now about her being flirtatious?”
Cas squints at the figure standing before him, trying to firm up his vision in the light-starved space.
The last two months of my life is titled the never-ending saga of ‘oh shit’, from friend drama to quitting my job to starting a new one to legit being in hospital for a week, but I'm so ready and excited to get back to writing fic again 😄
It is with unfamiliarity and clumsiness that he first approaches kissing someone with bristle and a distinctly masculine body.
Dean and Cas’ wild scramble of word babble overlap one another’s and only comes to a halt when Jack’s head stops swivelling between them both.
“I meant your reaction.”
When they reach the bunker again, Dean hands Castiel a gun and tells him to keep lookout. “I need to grab some extra cash as well. Just remembered we need to fill up Baby’s tank soon, might as well do it on this run. Where’d you leave your phone?”
He thinks of how nice it would be to lay in bed and watch a movie with Cas. How nice everything with Cas is when they're not fighting.
“Er—hey.”
“I guess not,” he quickly says. “I guess a diner’s a shit place for a first date.” He feels all sorts of stupid and ridiculous, acting like a jealous teenage boy over some harmless flirtation that Cas didn’t even actually respond to.
“Dean.” His name always falls so prettily off Cas’ lips. Pillowed lips he’d wanted to brush his to. His name sounds so cradled coming from them, said so carefully, with purpose and with reverence.
“You’re a liar,” he drawls, slurring worse now that he’s standing. His brain catches up to just how well and truly stewed in alcohol his body is. “You’re a fucking liar and you know it. You love me!” he shouts, steadfast in his conviction. He probably won't be so sure in the morning, but for now, he plows on because he can't accept anything else. “You can’t just—you can’t just stop that easily," he blathers on. It's more an argument with himself now, battling the part of his brain that's reminding him of all the reasons Cas should and probably has moved on.
“Didn’t want to walk in on anything. Not like the two of you could get pregnant.”
“Stop craning your neck. He said he’d be awhile. Why don’t you just sit here and talk to your old friend?” prods Benny. Though he can’t see him, Cas imagines him in detective-mode, taking a measured and thoughtful drink of his beer. “Why
“That guy sucked. I’m glad he’s working on Christmas Eve. What an asshole. Do you think he was so shitty because it was obvious we were a couple? Probably a homophobe.”
“What?” the boy bites back defensively, “stop laughing at me!”
“And you, you dull, indolent, plodding pile of goop, you want peace and quiet, I know that. I swear to you I will make your existence louder than the goddamn Big Bang once you take him. I’m trying to kill God right now. I think I‘m stupid and angry and stubborn enough to find a way to burst your eardrums,” Dean’s arrogant smirk wobbles through his tears, “He brought you to Billie. You have your vengeance. Kinda. Just—enough now. Please.”
John plops himself on the bed beside them next to a soundly asleep Sam, and Cas is so attuned to Dean that he knows his jaw is clenched right now with barely contained rage.
“So,” Dean starts, when it’s obvious no one else is going to risk saying something because they may burst out laughing. “We gonna talk about this or what?”
It seems to make it worse because now Dean’s casting his eyes upwards, and Castiel knows that he does this when he is trying not to spill tears.
“Well, then maybe you should mind your own business.” Dean’s voice goes cold. “You’ve also said enough for me to guess what you so
“Your scruff is scratching my neck,” Cas grunts grumpily.
Cas consents to Dean’s request, but does so while laughing at the ridiculous idea.
Dean boldly takes Cas’ hand and pulls him forward. “Come on.”
“I am sorry,” Dean says quietly, “for earlier. For…being weird about cuddling.”
“I don’t think I’ve told you as an adult how—um—great your eyes are,” he finds himself murmuring, unbidden. “I can’t believe I once said they looked like a dog’s.”
Dean paces slowly, menacingly, and very meaningfully towards his father who right now still towers over him.
He also doesn’t understand why Sam looks angry too now. “What the hell is wrong with you, Dean?”
“I’m here to take you home,” Dean murmurs next to his ear. Castiel smiles, and he’s sure it’s a goofy one because he’s too drunk to care. He’s too inebriated to quell his desire to be near Dean.
“If you hadn’t been so stubborn, so irrefutable in your—”
“Dean, are you having a stroke?” Cas asks very seriously.
They sag into their seats as Baby speeds off.
“Yes,” Dean and Cas reply together too quickly, too synchronously.
When Dean looks back to his saviour, Cas has his head tilted in the sweet, novice-human kind of way that reminds Dean of ten years previous. He’s looking at Dean with a mixture of curiosity and tenderness, something of the latter making him feel a dozen different kinds of uncomfortable.
Right. Of course.
“Dean’s mean,” Sam mumbles, looking anywhere but at them. The mood shifts instantly.
Cas can tell this confession is difficult for Dean and he resents himself for how he feels only bitterness instead of appreciation in this moment.
“Well, I know. I like Cas.”
“Alright. Cas.”
“I’ll see you at home. It’ll be fine.” He’s not sure if he’s convincing himself or Cas.
Cas can’t hear it—but after becoming so well-versed in this kind of interactive episode with their friends, he’s sure Benny sighs at this point.
Dean exhales his held breath, reassured and calmed within a moment. He closes his eyes for a brief second and relishes in the relief.
“What—” Dean feels genuinely ruffled. “What
“I’m sorry again, for, you know...” he mumbles, blinking away at tears, “being a dick. All the shitty things I said to you. How I lash out when I feel...not...wanted. I’m just shitty at feelings. It’s not you. You know that, right?”
On authority of Gabe, that’s something you think, not something to be spoken.
Come to think of it, she’s not even frowning anymore. She’s smiling at them carefully, not happy but not necessarily upset either.
Cas nods jerkily. Then, below his breath, “this was a bad idea,”
“Is there something on my face?” Cas asks cluelessly, dabbing around his mouth and frowning down at his clean hands.
“We’re better together,” Dean says quietly, “remember?” He offers Cas a small smile, a peace token. His heart hammers in his chest as he hopes against hope that Cas accepts it.
“Overkill, much?”
“Not without you.”
They finally look at each other in the eyes and Cas’ expression softens when he looks at Dean.
When Dean had parked, he saw those two persons on the other side of the road. They seemed to be lovers. He didn’t leave the car immediately, because he was watching them. They were saying goodbye to each other, and from what he could understand, one of them was going to die soon, because of an incurable disease, or something like that. He didn’t know why, but this scene, seeing two lovers saying goodbye to each other, crying, was hurting him so much. Dean never loved anyone enough to feel like his world was crushing all over him when he had to say goodbye. But right now, he was feeling the scene. He knew what they were feeling, he knew. He just knew, everything.
The video stopped, and Dean looked at the black screen for a minute. Next to him, Jack and Sam were already talking and making plans. If Jack was going to use his powers, they had to find a way to hide that from God. They still didn’t know how they were going to kill Chuck, but they knew that letting him know that Jack had his powers back probably wasn’t the best idea. They will have to play with the element of surprise during the finale battle. But how the fuck were they going to hide the power of a Nephilim to God himself? The guy basically knew everything that happened in the world, that was the thing with being God. And it’s not like they were able to find a place where He couldn’t see them, since they had to go to the place he was born, therefore, on Earth.
I don't really know if it requires a TW or a CW but, there is a description of a character enduring a huge pain, and it may require something, so here it is.
“Sam will stay far away, and I will be the one coming with you Jack.” Dean finally said, interrupting the conversation the boys were having.
And before they even had the time to say anything, God put his hands on Jack’s temples. The entire scene started glowing. Sam, Dean and Eileen had to protect their eyes, trying not to be blinding by the light that God was producing taking back all of his power from Jack. It wasn’t a lot, but it was still God power, the most dangerous and strong thing in the entire universe, and it seemed to be even more powerful than they expected, since he had the ability to hide it from the son of Lucifer himself, a son that had sucked up some of God power. Chuck was definitely stronger than they ever could had expected.
see you next week <3
They spent the rest of the day gathering all they needed for the spell, using all the knowledge Sam learned from Rowena. Even if Dean often mocked him for that, he had to admit that Sam’s skills in magic, as elementary as they were, had been useful in the past, and will be once again.
Dean and Sam looked at each other, the same idea in mind. They asked Jack and Eileen to stay here, took the tablet with them, and hurry up. They entered Hell, using the gate that Rowena created. Speaking of the devil, she was in the room where the portal was, reading a book. She raised her head, and Dean talked, before she even had the time to say hello, again.
Hey guys!
“How could he have missed power? He’s God, he’s supposed to be perfect?” Asked Sam.
“I don’t know. Maybe we can go to Hell, to ask Rowena and Kevin to change their research? We have Jack’s power back, it doesn’t matter anymore, does it? We could ask them to search a way to bring Cas back instead?” Dean asked.
I'm here with a new chapter, I hope you'll like it!!
One week ago, Dean and Sam were asking Kevin to try and find things about Nephilim’s power on the tablet. They only had news once, just him saying that the tablet did mention the existence of a hybrid between an angel and a human, but from what he was reading, the solution to give back a Nephilim his power wasn’t on the tablet. Somehow, it made sense. Nephilims were often more powerful than their angelic parent, and God had to predict that a son of an archangel could become even more powerful than himself, and therefore, did not put any information about how to make them more powerful on his Words. The Winchesters asked Kevin to concentrate more on the notes that Metatron added when he wrote The Word of God. The angel didn’t know anything about God’s plan or how unbearable it would be for him to be less powerful than a living thing, so his notes could be useful.
“Hello boys” cheerly said Rowena, sitting on the throne, stunning as always.
When they arrived at the bunker, Dean had finally fallen asleep, and he seemed to be ok. Sam didn’t want to wake him up, he didn’t know if he would be even able to fall asleep again if he did. So, Sam just let him sleep here, and went back to his room. There, he fell in his bed, watching the roof. He fell asleep, suddenly, without realizing, while he was thinking about the day he just spent, watching over his shoulder, as if something was about to jump on him from behind.
They all talked for another hour, until the Winchesters decided that if they didn’t go now, they would have to drive until late at night, and none of them wanted that. They had a rough couple of weeks, and they needed sleep as much as possible.
“We should start right now, Sam, God won’t sleep and take some time off. We have to hurry”
Jack could see everyone believing in him. Gabriel believed in him when he recorded this DVD. Dean and Sam believed in him when they decided to go, trusting him with their lives and the future of the universe without the slightest doubt. Castiel believed in him, before he was even born, when he didn’t have a soul, when nobody, including himself, believed in him anymore. Castiel did, and it was his memory that gave Jack the strength to smile at Dean when the hunter asked him if everything was ok, if he was ready.
Sam tried to make him change his mind, but not for long. He knew it would not really work, and if he had to be honest, he also wanted to do that with Cas, and he didn’t really have a voice when Jack and Dean decided to do something.
Take care of you, stay home, wear a mask and drink water !
“Guys. We have a big problem. Rowena acted so weird when I was in Hell. I’m pretty sure that Chuck is controlling her. And… if he really does… he knows that Jack has his powers back. And he knows that we’re trying to bring Cas back…” Dean said, hoping that his brother won’t be mad at him, for not realizing before he said everything to her.
“Bring him back.” It was the only thing that Dean have been able to say.
When they arrived at Rowena’s palace, they all sat in an empty room, just the four of them. The red hair women introduced herself, as Rowena McLeod, the queen of Hell, and a friend. Kevin was always suspicious vis-à-vis royalty in Hell, but with what he went through with Crowley, it was understandable.
What he didn’t expect was to find Rowena in the room right when he arrived. He was counting on the time he would have searching for her to calm down completely, but now, he was right in front of her, his breath still panting. The woman looked at him for a second, first surprised to see him here, surprise that quickly became a surprise to see him in this state. She didn’t know what to do, so she came closer and patted him on the shoulder, not comfortable around people feeling bad. Dean took a second to watch away, and locked his eyes on a portrait of Crowley on the wall. Seeing the demon made him calm down, because he had a judgmental face and Dean couldn’t bear appear “weak” in front of him. He has his pride, and being judged by Crowley was the thing he could not accept, even though the demon was dead.
“Dean,” he intones. “Please let me do this one thing for you tonight. I can’t be happy if you aren’t happy, and I know you won’t be happy letting Sam sleep in the backseat of a car when there’s a better option.”
Cas offers him a cracked smile which Dean returns with his best efforts.
“Sorry,” Sam mutters, looking right through Dean. “It’s real then.”
“Boyfriend?” he asks, voice slurred even contained in that one word. “What are you—” he hiccups, “talking about?”
Dread slinks forward.
Cas gapes at her.
They both stagger into bed more awkwardly than they’ve approached kissing.
“Why do
“Hey jerk, you owe me a drink.” Sam points, blurry-eyed, at the space in front of him. “Cas, Eileen wants a Strawberry Woo-woo.”
The boy laughs at him with a mouth full of what looks like cherry pie, crumbs and morsels of jam spewing everywhere. “You’re so fun to fuck with.”
Dean blushes, so does Cas, from what he can see out of the corner of his eye.
“Way more than friendship,” Dean splutters.
“Are you guys boyfriends?” questions a yawning Sam.
Dean laughs at him cruelly. “You know, I was working myself up to apologise to you for that stupid fucking thing I said, but maybe I was right. You always seem to have a way of making things go wrong.”
“Eileen’s gone to see her hunter friend for a couple of days. Helping out on a case. I should have just gone with her. I miss her.”
In a fit of desperation, he flees the scene, sans Cas, feeling feverish.
Cas looks flabbergasted. He opens his mouth, tilts his head, then shakes it. “I meant every word I said, Dean,” he murmurs softly, and he sounds like Cas again, the open-hearted, puppy-eyed, earnest man he had grown to be. “You are the bravest, exquisite, most stubbornly good man in the entire cosmos, but fuck, for such a clever person you can be so stupid at times.”
he’s having a difficult time remembering what was so bad about it.
Cas was once a far more serious boy who discerned his childhood as a series of carefully moderated and formulaic performances.
It’s quite distracting. He doesn’t hear his name being called until Eileen touches his forearm gently and tilts her head in direction of Sam.
Eileen winces at the animosity that’s entered the room along with Dean. He almost feels bad. Almost.
not what I’m getting at here!”
She moves to follow Sam, departing with a kind smile at Dean and Cas. She also leaves the room silently, without the fiddly explanations and awkwardness.
Cas cheeks flush with a fury ready to burn a thousand suns. Dean is so relieved that once his mouth opens, preparing to unleash a wicked rampage, his brother approaches them to interrupt.
Cas blushes. “Okay, Dean.”
“We’re always good, Dean.”
“So...” Cas ventures, looking far too collected. “That was strange.”
with me, Charlie! This is how we are. We’ve always been this way. You’ve not said anything until now, so let me ask you, why now?”
Dean bumps shoulders with him on purpose at the entranceway of the Roadhouse.
“Ouch.” He wipes sloppily at his mouth with the back of his hand. “I dare you. I’ll swap you a fistful of pie for your fleece. You wanted to give it to me so bad earlier, you freak of nature with your bleeding heart.”
She heaves a breath that looked heavy inside. “Okay. I...I believe you. Thank you for telling me first.” She grins at Dean. “We had a good run, didn’t we?”
“We’ll stay in touch? Maybe you can still hang out with Ben and I some time, bring...Cas?” She smiles now, a lot more warmly at Cas than she ever has.
He enjoys everything better with Cas. Physical intimacy, apparently, is now tremendously included.
“Batshit crazy?” Dean supplies.
“Of course I do,” Cas replies coolly. “It’s an odd situation.”
“We could paint Cas’ name onto one,” Eileen suggests. “That could be fun.”
“Didn’t what?”
Castiel almost doesn’t hear him. He also doesn’t understand what led to what Dean said. Had Castiel been saying something before? Everything is a little hazy and darkened and whirling right now.
“We made a deal,” the dark sludge hisses and it sounds like it’s reverberating from every wall in the room.
“I was talking about sex, Dean.”
Dean makes a sound that involuntarily came out as a giggle. “You’re more bothered about the boxers than my morning wood poking into yours?”
“We are way past like, my friend!” he continues, voice raising with every word. “We sailed straight past like a decade or so ago! You are not this stupid, Dean!”
Castiel has been quietly observing the boy for some time now.
This lasted for approximately an hour or so, up until a niggling thought started crawling around and burrowing a home inside his brain. Cas had watched as the glow emanating off of Dean took a nosedive. He had watched and he had frowned.
He looks up and flashes a gummy grin at Dean that makes his gut feel like it drops away from its holding place inside of him.
“If I am still awake when you finish, Dean Winchester, I will be back,” comes the ominous whistle of air.
“If you’re ever gonna cry over anyone, it better be me,” jokes Dean with a half-grin.
"This all sounds disastrous to me."
Religious studies,
“Dean—” Cas starts.
Cas shrugs. “I’ve always been content with just the being, not the having. I never needed Dean to reciprocate, I never expected anything, or needed it. He was always as straight as they come. I just want him to be happy.” Cas smiles at Dean like it wouldn’t make his heart bloom.
He doesn’t avert his eyes this time. “Cas, I’m sorry.”
“Why are you here?” he asks, swaying side to side from his sitting position. The bar is spinning again and he clenches his hands on the table’s edge to steady himself.
Cas’ head is slumped on Dean’s shoulder and he’s smacking his lips together like he wants to say something, then gives up along with his eyes as soon as they fall shut.
Castiel lets the butterflies turn soft in his belly. “Thank you, Dean. It has been nice cuddling you as well.”
“You could just use a sharpie—”
“Oh. Good morning, Dean.”
Their eyes still interlock, and something passes between them, something that feels like a promise of ‘later.’ A look, uncomplicated and in sync, much like the ones passed between Sam and Eileen that Dean had been so envious of.
“You’re sweating,” Sam says with furrowed brows and concern, “and—and staring at Cas like—” His words drop off sharply.
“You’re a fucking child,” Dean retorts, jumping on top of Cas, leg on either side, as he pretends to smother him with a pillow. Cas flails while Dean snickers his amusement. They end up rolling off onto the floor together with Dean pinned under Cas by his wrists.
“Me being upset about you dirtying up my ride with your filthy shoes? Can’t say I see the connection, sorry.”
“So…” he sways his shoulders back and forth expectantly, lips pursed, “that’s a yay over nay? We gonna fake bone and fake fall in love or what?”
“Hey, hey,” an unfamiliar voice nudges through Castiel’s sleepy brain. There’s also a hand shaking his shoulder as he fumbles his way back into a fuller consciousness.
According to a disgruntled Sam set against the backdrop of Maui’s sunset, Dean and Cas will be doing this until one of them dies — which, incidentally, is what Cas looks like he is wishing upon himself right now.
He sleeps.
“That’s not—” Dean stops himself short and rolls his eyes instead. He settles into Cas’ side, plucks his hand from Cas’, and uses that arm to wind around Cas’ shoulders instead.
“Are those my lucky boxers? They are! Dean! You know you’re allowed whichever one but that one!” he yells, scandalised. He also loosens one hand from around Dean’s wrist to smack him with a nearby pillow again.
“Dean? Where are we going to go? I don’t want to go back there if he’s just going to come back like that again in a couple of weeks.”
This one is a little shorter as we will definitely conclude at four, with the last chapter being mostly an epilogue of sorts, where I can tie up some loose ends and give you some fluff to soothe the angst.
“How disappointing,” Dean says into his pillow, face already plastered back onto it.
Thank you to my wonderful beta and friend @Seralina 🥺 This update would have likely taken months to post if it wasn’t for her. You’re the best gal anyone can dream of
“Dean doesn’t speak for me, but yes, April. You and I—so over.“
“On the bed?”
“Get some rest. We’ll talk more later,” Sam says, “You’re here permanently now, right?”
Dean’s sure his grin is bright enough to light a darkened forest.
“Dean, Dean,” Castiel hushes, placing a calming hand on his shoulder. “You’re spiralling again. I have my phone. We’re okay.”
“Cas, for fuck’s sake—”
What’s bothering him is how right it felt when Lisa had clasped their hands and assured them that this was allowed. What’s bothering him is how when Lisa talked about wanting a family, all he could think about was how he already had one and the man was standing next to him.
“You have feelings for me,” Dean says pitifully, "you love me platonically, sure, like you love Sammy, and maybe you’re attracted to me and that’s why you mash the two together and it equals as that kind of love in your head—”
Some kind of wall perishes inside Dean with those words.
“Catch?” Dean’s squeaks, then clears his throat and makes sure to deepen it. “What catch? There’s no catch.”
“You’re a fucking child. I’m going to smother you one day,” Cas grumbles, turning pointedly away from Dean, pulling all the covers with him.
Dean sniggers. “You’re so stupid.”
Cas responds with a very forced smile.
“What? You scared of sharing a bed with another guy? A minute ago you were fucking about with the idea of us being boyfriends,” Dean snickers.
“I believe my current occupancy of your bunker necessitates that I am, indeed, back.”
“A warm shower will help with that.” His touch disappears along with him, Dean feels suddenly empty, and then in quick succession a freshly laundered towel is thrown at his face. “Go shower then you can get in bed.”
“No, no, I…” He’s grabbed his keys and is halfway out the door when he pauses and takes a deep breath in preparation for the obscenely stupid thing he’s about to say. “I am. His boyfriend.” Dean feels his stomach flutter, and even though he feels a rising sickness along with it, he’s still smiling tentatively to himself when slides into Baby, revving her up.
“What, painting one stupid ornament?” Dean retorts, then his shoulders sink, “it wouldn’t even look the same as the rest of ours.”
It’s not what he wanted to say exactly.
“Sorry, not such a happy sleeper.”
Dean and Cas flinch towards each other.
“Dean?” Lisa says tentatively.
“Dean!” Another interruption that has Dean’s heart squirming in contorted anguish. This time it’s distinctly female and distinctly more terrifying than Sam’s.
Second would be Sam catching them in the act. Cliché, trope, wonderment of atrocity at its finest.
“Take it telling people didn’t go very well?” Cas ventures hesitantly.
Dean flips his hand so they can entwine their fingers.
He can see through the barrier and know with the same certainty he’s known all his life about his attraction to women, that he loves Cas and wants to kiss him. It feels okay now, so he smiles with the most relief he’s felt in a long time and drifts his face towards Cas.
“Are you experiencing feelings that are new? Am I suddenly something different to you now?” There is an element of fear is Cas’ voice that Dean is not used to. “Was I wrong to have thought our friendship was inviolable?”
“Dude! Watch where you’re sitting.”
Today has begun so normally and domestically that Dean is starting to grow in anxiety, waiting for the other shoe—or bomb—to drop.
“Who’s here?” he questions in a hushed whisper.
“You’re starting to sound like a broken record. Honestly, Dean, it’s—whatever. We dated for a few weeks. It hurts, sure, but it’s not like I’m going to cry about it.”
Cas waits a few minutes on the foot of his bed, tapping his fingers restlessly on his knees.
“I’m the stupidest guy you know, aren’t I?” Dean mutters, head lolling back with mental exhaustion.
“Come in for a hug, dumbass. I’m asking for a hug.”
Towards the path of success and righteousness.
“Alright. Thanks, then. Friend,” Dean says, amused. “Let’s go to a diner,” he announces, “Two dudes grocery shopping together is a little gay. I don’t judge, but that shit’s not really for me.”
“I don’t need to hear about you two bumping’ uglies.” Bobby waves a hand dismissively at Dean as he hops into his ride. “I’ll see you both for dinner some time next week, unless you decide to get hitched for real and forget to invite me again.”
Dean grins. “This feels like a dream, y’know. A really great one. One I’ve had a few times before, a little less crying, a little less clothes.”
Dean’s chest clenches with pain.
The door slams closed again as Dean and Cas pause to goggle at each other. They also scramble away from one another at record speed, so rapidly that Cas falls off the bed.
“What? What’s the problem? I don’t care, mom wouldn’t have cared, dad—well, maybe he would a bit, but he’s dead now so who cares? Who cares except you, Dean?” Sam needles, facing him once more, earnest. “It’s okay to be who you are. Even while the world is burning down around us. Let’s clutch at whatever happiness we can, right? What’s the point in punishing ourselves? God does it enough for us.”
Dean is back-pedalling with high speed from the pat-on-the-back cleverness of his plan. He also starts to war over what he was trying to win during this wrestle in the first place.
Thank you to anyone to took the time to read this or comment (even just to vent about anything completely unrelated such as the SPN ending 😂)
“Of—of course it does, I—”
“You played—” Sam hiccups, “—a mean joke again. You two. You two are not nice.”
? You talked about this to Charlie?”
“This was your idea,” Cas huffs, “and my apologies, but this isn’t exactly a normal situation for me either. I panicked.”
“Calling me sunshine all the time likely doesn’t discourage the narrative that we’re in love.”
“Wait, hang on a second,” Sam halts them with a hand that breaks them apart, making Dean whimper a little at the loss of Cas’ comforting touch. “You’re breaking up with her, aren’t you? At her place of work? Couldn’t you have just gone over to her apartment or ask her to yours? Dean, goddammit, I
Dean does a demented movement with his hand that was supposed to be a wave and ushers Cas along at sonic speed.
After they settle Sam and Eileen into Dean’s bed with the promise of collecting their Hybrid for them in the morning, Cas hops into the shower while Dean brushes his teeth and strips down into his boxers.
“I know what it means,” Dean replies, “it means he doesn’t like it so much when I do shit like this—”
Dean’s up in an instant, his breakfast forgotten, and he’s rifling through the cabinets, cans and bottles and jars clinking together as he shoves unwanted items aside. “Chicken and Mushroom any good? Or we have—what is this—plain tomato? Fucking Sam, I bet.” Dean makes an offended face at the latter option which he holds in his right hand, though he brings both over and sets them in front of Castiel to choose.
The microwave dings, and Dean leaves his chair like a bat out of hell to go retrieve the soup. He sets it in front of Castiel and still dodging his eyes, he says, “so you said you don’t remember much, but what do you—what do you remember?”
Dean laughs once Cas leaves. At least one of them will be.
“Dean, we’ll talk some more later, okay?”
“Oh.”
Oh, no.
Had Cas not seemed to physically enjoy it to an indisputable degree, Dean would potentially feel guiltier than he already does for taking advantage of the situation. He’s halfway to convincing himself that Cas is not that amenable a friend—no one could be—and that he must be appreciating this at least a sliver.
Charlie emphasises her point by slamming the door behind her. With as much fury and annoyance as Dean once did six years ago at Cas’ first girlfriend’s doorstep.
“Hey, I’m Dean, I’m a bit of a dick. Sorry, have we not met?” Dean snorts. “Makes what we’ve been doing together kinda shady, bit slutty.”
Dean's heart stutters. He doesn't think he'll be getting any sleep tonight.
“You are tremendously drunk,” Castiel says quietly, “I’m not going to take advantage of you in this state, and I believe that even if I let something like that happen, I would get punched the moment you became sober again.” Dean catches a glimpse of Cas from the side and sees him looking wry with amusement. “Seeing as I’m now pretty much human, I’m assuming that punch would hurt.”
“Then don’t be so crude.”
Instead, Dean’s stomach grumbles, he can’t say it, and Cas suggests they visit a diner as Sam and Eileen are still likely hiding out, avoiding Dean and Cas, waiting for them to sort their shit out.
“Ridiculous, yeah.” He smiles tightly at Cas. “Well, I’m glad we cleared that up.”
Cas reaches for his bicep and squeezes. He puts a quick kiss onto Dean’s cheek, and it calms him immediately. He finds himself struggling not to smile.
“Dean, I’m
“Dean.”
So yeah, I guess I did turn one chapter into 3 long ones and dragged out the angst far more than necessary. Does it help if I say sorry? Probably not.
Shit, this is just getting worse by the second. Dean wishes he hadn’t reacted to any of this in any way shape or form, because now Cas is observing him with a mixture of curiosity and amusement.
Dean shrugs and finds his spot next to Cas, far closer than acceptable for two buds. He’s too mentally exhausted to care at this point. “I’d rather sit next to you and do nothing than spend time with other people, doing stuff.”
he intones, “big brother all—all proper and deper-depra-deprecatory like his boyfriend Cast-eel.”
He doesn’t have more time.
(See the end of the chapter for
As he dresses, slowly and painfully, he grumbles a few more times and wracks his brain for any more embarrassing or life-ruining events that may have transpired last night. He’s surmised as much that Dean had likely carried him into bed, unclothed him, and tucked him under some sheets. Folded a towel for him. Looked after him.
“I was right though,” Dean calls, with Castiel’s foot halfway out the door. “You looked ridiculous last night. Baggy and…just—not right. Take something from my closet.”
Dean kind of resents his calm. “Why did you even let us come here? How could you even let me talk you into this? You’re supposed to be the smart one! The sane one! The rest of my life pretty much banks on you stopping me from doing and talking you into insane shit like this, Cas!”
“Benny has Andrea, Charlie’s got Dorothy, Garth’s got Bess, even Rowena’s got Ketch—I mean,
Castiel pats his hand reassuringly. “I have…fucked up a lot too. We all seem to have a habit of doing so, but all we can do now is strive to stop…or lessen it, at least. For what it’s worth, I appreciate the apology and I, of course, forgive you.”
“How many women have you paraded around me over the years?” Cas asks firmly. “How many have I had to watch you drool over and touch and kiss? Even Anna—”
Belatedly, they both realise they’re still locked in a far too intimate embrace. Both of Cas’ hands are tucked into Dean’s arm now. They’re standing closer than normal even for them. Their foreheads are almost touching and unconsciously, Dean’s eyes flicker to Cas’ lips. Not because he wants to—God—kiss him or anything. He’s just vividly aware that that must be what it must’ve looked like was about to happen. Because that’s what they had been trying to emulate. Yeah. Just Dean doesn’t remember them drifting closer together like this and the plan was only to stride in, arm in arm like a casual couple, not—
He’s so caught up in his anxious thoughts that Cas’ hand falling on his startles him.
Dean leaves his seat in one quick swoop upwards, falling onto the table with one palm to steady himself.
Dean throws his head back and groans. “What are you, five? I obviously didn’t mean that!” He groans again. “Shit. I’m sorry. I’m stressed.” He shuffles his feet towards Cas and tips at his chin so Cas looked at him. “Look, I am sorry. I got us into this and I’m taking it out on you. Not cool. We’ll say it’s a prank.”
I hope anyone that reads this can enjoy it and thank you for visiting my story! <3
“Fine,” Dean croaks.
The phone line clicks end and Dean sits in horror and wonder and hope. These feelings all escape in one quick flight once he consoles himself in that they’ve exchanged words of love before. It’s not new. It’s only new to Dean because he maybe, might actually, be a little bit in—
If he wanted, he could look. He could stare. It wouldn’t raise any unseemly suspicions. They’ve done much less and much more and Dean has seen him naked more times than he would care to think about. If he reimagined his memories, it would likely send him into a mild panic attack.
Cas thinks this is a good time to actually go to the bathroom now so he can retch up every inch of his mortification.
“What did you say to Eileen?”
“And Cas? You look at Cas like he hung the friggin’ moon. Don’t get me started on all the gazing you two do.”
“Even I think this is sickening,” Cas says wryly, “and we aren’t going to find paint,” he adds, frowning out the window.
Sam sighs dramatically. Dean turns dagger eyes onto him. “Something to say?”
“No, I mean,” Castiel stops faltering on his feet and Dean pauses with him, one arm still looped around Castiel’s waist to keep him vertical. Castiel also realises that one of his arms has found its way around Dean’s shoulder. Dean’s essentially carrying him out the bar. It’s nice. It feels nice to be taken care of like this, especially after being alone and miserable for so long.
Unbidden, the words soar out, cloaked thankfully in familiarity. “Love you.”
“I don’t sleep,” Cas reminds him dryly. “It’s as if you’ve not listened to me the last couple hundred times.”
The sound of clattering objects and crashing furniture accompanied by Dean cursing loudly jostles Cas into action.
“You alright there, Sammy?” Dean asks tentatively, squeezing Cas’ hand once before letting it go. He moves to sit by his brother.
“Do you want to call it off?” he asks gently.
“I’m not pouting. Maybe if you’d put that stupid brick of bore down for one goddamn second—”
“Why the hell do you own safety goggles?” Dean asks. “Wait, don’t answer that. I don’t want to hear it if it’s something kinky.”
His lips part, flummoxed, once he replays the rushed question that’s flooded out of
Dean grumbles his disappointment. He realises with even more distress that he didn’t even get to kiss Cas properly.
A beat of silence follows where all Cas does is stare back at him with a blank expression.
“We are friends, Dean,” Cas says seriously. His arm reaches out over the table, like he’s reaching for Dean, but he stops halfway there and pulls back. Dean wishes he hadn’t. Dean wishes he never fucking said anything about personal space at all.
“So you know how it feels to be towered over in size for a change,” Dean taunts as he chews noisily and merrily on Cas’ pretty damn delicious cookies.
“If we can’t find paint, then I’ll just do it in blood,” Dean continues on to joke morbidly. “Always happy to bleed for Castiel, Angel of the Lord.”
Benny opens his arms wide, his wingspan extending to the point where he’s almost whacking Dean in the face with his outspread hands.
She releases their hands and wipes a stray tear away. “Okay. Phew. That was a surprisingly short conclusion. I really thought I’d be a lot more immature about this when it finally happened. I’m sorry I never talked to you about this, Dean, never supported you, but well—shit, I’m sorry. I’ll see you both around.” She rushes away before Dean or Cas can say anything, before Dean can even tell her not to be sorry, that
“You’ve gotten very cutesy and sassy, y’know that? Very human.”
Finally.
Cas scoffs. “You always want to hear it when it’s something kinky. What’s changed?”
“Sam’s cereal is also in the pantry.”
His guilt has eaten up his concern for personal safety.
“Um—I’m just—the shower—” Cas gestures randomly backwards with his hand.
See you next week! I hope you had a great christmas <3
And suddenly, Jack could feel it. His power was here, he was complete again. He had to use all the willpower he had to stop touching Dean’s soul, leaving him fall on the ground, and he screamed to Sam. He did it, he stopped himself at the exact right moment, and he could still feel Dean’s life next to him, he was still alive.
Sam did not understand what Dean had just say. Castiel? Who or what was Castiel? They didn’t know anyone by that name. Why was Dean crying? He was going to ask him what the hell was happening, and why he was crying, and who was Castiel, when he froze. He heard a voice behind him, a voice that he knew too well.
“Dean. Please…” Sam said, suddenly hugging his brother to help him calm down. It took more than ten minutes, but he eventually stopped sobbing. Tears were still running on his cheeks, but his breathing was slow and controlled. Sam continued talking. “Dean, you have to talk to me, please. Tell me what is happening. I never, ever saw you like that. Every time someone mention Cas, you lock yourself up and almost stop talking, you only accept Jack to talk about him, and only when you’re sure that nobody can listen or watch you. And now, we mention him being dead, and you react like that? Dean, I was with you every time you had to grief. Every time. Mom, Dad, Charlie, Kevin, even Castiel himself. What is different now? Dean, what happened that night, exactly? Please tell me. I have to kno…” Sam was cut by Dean, still trying not to breakdown again.
Sam’s only response was an indistinct groan, that Dean took for a positive reaction, and he headed to the kitchen, to make coffee for his 6’4 brother. Dean felt strange. Some part of him wanted to translate the notes quickly as possible, since it could be a possible lead, but the other part wanted to forgot about that, to never understand what it means. This note gave Dean hope, making him believe that they could have actually find something useful, but maybe it wasn’t the case, maybe this scribble didn’t mean anything, maybe it was just some stuff a drunk man wrote there. And Dean didn’t want that. He wanted to find things, he wanted all of this to be over.
Dean did not wait for any of the two people in the room to answer before grabbing Baby’s key, and Miracle’s leash. He needed to be alone for a while, to calm down. He drove in silence, Miracle behind him, laying on a blanket on baby’s back seat. The sun started to rise, without Dean realizing it. He was driving for hours now, and he didn’t even know where he was. He finally parked Baby when he understood exactly where he was, and why did he come here. In front of him, proudly standing, was a barn that he knew very well. It was in this building that he first saw Castiel. He still remembered this day perfectly. Of course he did, how could he forgot this day, where he started believing in angels, because he didn’t have a choice anymore.
As you can see, I haven't post last week. I'll try to keep posting once every 2 weeks, but i won't promise I will, as I said during the last chapter, things are a bit complicated for me lately.
Dean was crying. He cried before, but, seeing him cry today, at this exact moment, for no apparent reasons? After they finally won their right to be happy and free ? No, it was definitely something he wasn’t expecting.
“Dean? Why am I here? You can make me come without me realizing? I didn’t know you had that power.”
In the other room, Sam was making sure everything was ready. His role in this operation was the easiest. The spell he had to cast was a really basic one, and he had done spells way more difficult with Rowena. The only hard part would be to cast it at the right time, but once again, it was more up to Jack, who will have to tell him when he would be ready. He feared more the after, the blast of power that will follow. They had no idea how to protect themselves from it, and they just had to pray that either Jack could control it or that it wouldn’t touch them. Well, no, they better not pray, it could make God understand what they were doing, and that would literally be the worst thing that could ever happen. Anyway, they had to hope everything was going to be ok. Because at the end of the day, it was all they had. Hope. They had nothing else, just each other and their faith.
When they settled their plan (find a way to bring back Cas, actually bring him back with them and then kill God himself), they went back in Baby. They were exhausted, but they didn’t have the time to sleep anyway. They already were going to “lose” time searching for Cas instead of fighting Chuck (this was, of course, not a loss of time for Dean nor Jack), and sleeping took too much time. Therefore, they would just sleep in the car, taking turn to drive. Although Jack could drive, Dean didn’t want him to do so while he and Sam were sleeping, and therefore, only Sam and him would drive. He didn’t trust a boy who drove two times in his life to be left alone behind Baby’s wheels. He accepted that Sam would, and it was already a big thing for him.
This conversation had made him feel better about his feeling, but at the same time, it made everything fall in front of them. God proved that they could never beat him. They tried with the second most powerful thing in the world, and even him had only been able to weaken him a little bit, and only because God let him. What will they do now? Jack didn’t have power anymore, and they didn’t have hope left. Everything was gone, and they will have to watch the world fall in front of them. They won’t ever be able to fight God. Everything they loved will be destroyed, and it was only their fault, it was because they wanted free will, because they wanted to beat destiny, they wanted to never have their lives decided ever again. They should have known that nothing ever worked for them, with everything that happened in their lives, they should have known. But they preferred to have hope, to try once again, and for what? For nothing. God always had what he wanted, why would it have changed now? They have been stubborn, and the entire universe will be paying the price for their behavior.
“Of course, Eileen. Stay safe, and come back quick.” Replied Sam.
“Maybe. But I failed. Again. And we will die. Because of me. Because I’m a failure.”
Sam did too. He was more hopeful than his brother, because he always was, but he understood how the green-eyed man was feeling, and he felt the same way. He was afraid, so afraid, that everything could go wrong in a second, but he felt at peace for a minute, with those persons who believed in them, without even knowing what they were doing. They believe in them, they believe they could do anything, no matter what, no matter how insane it looked like. Jody and the girls believed, and that was enough for the Winchesters to let go a little of their fear, and be peaceful.
Hey, I'm back with a new chapter, hoping that you will like it!
They had hope, and they had an explanation. That was more than they could have ever expected after this morning. There was no way God could expect them to have a beginning of a plan this fast. But they did. They will beat God, it was just a matter of time now. Jack had power, and they’ll find a way to make him gain enough of it to kill God. But he had to stay hidden, he had to keep his powers a secret for everyone. If God happened to learn about them, they would lose the war. Jack was their only plan, and he had to be a secret weapon. They were five to know about him, and it was already too much. Even their closest friends shouldn’t know. For everyone on this universe, Jack had to be considered as a powerless kid, a human.
“Jack, listen to me. When we were trying to kill God... You heard a conversation between Sam and me, and... You shouldn’t have heard it, I’m sorry.”
When Eileen came back to say goodbye, the group was already on the middle of their research. The hunter left the bunker, and they were alone, just the three of them. They often had been in the last 3 years, but it was the first time that Castiel was dead. The only time that happened was in the very beginning, when Jack was a new born. But the ambiance wasn’t the same anymore. Dean wasn’t mad at Jack, he didn’t hold him responsible. In fact, he was just happy to have the boy with him. They felt like a family, showing once again that family don’t end in blood, and it will never do. Nobody talked, they were all just reading, a pen in the end, in case they would have to take if they saw something that could help. But they didn’t find anything. Nevertheless, they didn’t stop believing this time, they didn’t lose hope. And every time Dean started feeling like he should just stop and accept his destiny, he could feel in his pocket the comforting touch of the mixtape, reminding him where his hope was, and that he was going to see him again soon.
“Take us to her. We’re the freaking Winchesters, we don’t take appointments.”
“Hello, Jack. I’m sure you’re surprised to see me, but see, I’m God. You’re just a 3 years old Nephilim, I really hope you didn’t think you could actually beat me? Really, you guys are disappointing. I thought you knew better, come on. You defeated Lucifer several times and he always did come back, but I should have stayed useless? You really underestimate me. I thought you were some of the best humans in the world, you could at least use the three braincells you have left, but I should have been wrong, maybe Castiel was the only one with a functional brain in your group.”
The red hair queen made every demon leave the room without any hesitation. She would never admit that, but the boys really did grew on her, and she understood why Fergus helped them so many time. Because now, she was the one helping them anytime. Winchester’s effect, it seemed to be.
“Why are certain words in capital letters?” he asked to his little brother.
“I have to go help him guys, I’m really sorry, but if you’re not in the game for the hunts, we need to all keep going and fight them for you.” She said.
Dean finally decided himself, and start running to Sam’s room, followed closely by a Jack, who wasn’t understanding anything happening, and a Miracle thinking that it’s time to play, since his owner was running. Dean entered Sam’s room without a knock, waking him suddenly.
And now, just like that, Jack was with them. He had been interrupted in a discussion with an angel, talking about how they should change heaven to make it a better place. The boy was standing in front of Dean, watching him in confusion.
Nonetheless, Dean was missing him so much. From time to time, he would turn his head next to him or behind him, expecting him to be here, watching the three of them with the softness in his eyes, the one he only had while he was watching Jack, or the Winchesters when they were not watching him. Dean expected him to be here, waiting for them to ask him to come closer and sit with them to watch the sun disappearing behind the mountains. Suddenly, Dean start talking. They had been silent since they sat here, but Dean felt the urge to talk, about Castiel, about their lives, about everything. Sam listened without a word, while Jack was asking a lot of questions, laughing when Dean was telling a funny story, smiling sadly when Dean was remembering one of those sad stories they had to go through during their lives. Dean had not talk that much about his life since forever, but it felt really good. And he get to talk about all those adventures he lived with Castiel, making him be here with them through the memories of him that the man Castiel loved the most had.
“For what? Seeing how much we failed? Realizing that we lost Castiel and that we didn’t even think of him in almost a month? That we didn’t even remembered his name? That God won, and that he’s definitely too powerful and that he tricked us? That we never will be able to be happy?” Dean burst out.
“Oh no Dean. Really? Because of the angel? You must be kidding me. Can’t you Winchester just do what you’re supposed to?”
“Cas—”
His breath tickles Dean’s jaw while his body balances lopsidedly above. It makes Dean squirm with giddiness, an interesting sensation that exhilarates his nerves. He hasn’t felt this boyish and unsettled since he was—well—a boy.
“But that’s only me projecting my own traits onto what my type is as opposed to what I’m actually attracted to, which I suppose, from experience, seems to be somewhat—”
“Um…” Dean gulps. “I didn’t mean…obviously not...that. I meant—I meant you didn’t tell me—”
“Why aren’t you angrier?” Dean challenges, jaw clenching.
“No, not yet. Perhaps today will be the day though,” Cas answers with wryness. “I must admit, of all the human things I did miss, sleeping is one of them. It’s nice to be able to…forget and rest for a period of time each day.”
“Certifiably insane,” Dean reminds him with a wolfish grin.
That one had hit too close to home. Dean was most definitely going to find someone else to cook with, to laugh with, to share intimate knowing looks with, and so many more adventures that Cas will not have a chance to partake in with him. Dean will find someone to settle down with and it won’t be Cas. Dean will move on and then it’ll just be Cas.
It’s the most innocent kiss he’s had since his first as a boy. He supposes it almost is like a first kiss. His first with someone he’s not allowed himself to want before, someone he didn’t realise he was allowed to have.
Both brothers snap up to attention to find Jack standing by Cas’ side, looking more together than the rest of them combined.
“Are you jealous?” Cas pokes at the issue outrightly. Do Not Speak Aloud, he knows it’s one of those thoughts, and yet Dean is throwing a brimming basket of hope in his face.
This fandom is literally all we have left of the ending Destiel were robbed of.
“Well, obviously, I’m gonna be the one that does it,” Dean responds, huffing, “now where do we keep the paint here?”
“No!” Dean roars. “Don’t you fucking come near him again.”
“I’ve been bunking off. They caught on. That’s why I’m on this stupid trip,” he glances at Castiel shiftily, “to make friends. Got about 1.5 at the moment—someone I bunk off school with and my pint-sized little brother.” He shrugs like it’s not a big deal, reaches into the rucksack tucked between his legs and flourishes out what looks like a full-sized pie.
They’re rowing like an old married couple before their relationship’s even really begun.
“—will be getting very tiresome.”
Dean squirms. It’s one of his favourite nicknames for Cas, and it’s starting to sound like the guy is starting to loathe the idea of how close they are…how familiar and chummy they can be to the point that a romance between them isn’t so implausible as they had thought. Dean isn’t ready to investigate deeper into why it stings so much.
It’s a real relaxing noise, and Dean resents it for the fact that it calms him somewhat. Then he resents himself for trying to hold onto his temper.
The amount of effort it took for him to perform that scoff doubles the brain pain and he groans loudly, dramatically, because he feels like being extra grouchy today. He supposes he fell asleep for the first time in a long time last night, but he’s not woken up feeling well-rested at all. He also feels physically disgusting, like he’s been dragged through mud and sweat and excrement. He needs a shower.
“Friday?” Dean echoes. “Friday’s our movie night.”
“Why now?” Sam asks quietly, but it’s so piercing that it interrupts Dean like a sharp needle has been run through his skin.
“Um...”
“No, I—I didn’t mean—sorry. I meant to say—um—yeah.” He exhales in the same second as an involuntary smile emerges and a pulse of butterflies flutter against the cavities of his chest.
“I really...I really love you,” Dean confesses as tenderly as he can, his heart racing. “I love you too, I mean.”
“Again, I don’t see how it’s any of your business,” Castiel says crossly, having returned to his walk back away from Dean, towards the steps, towards his room probably, anywhere but where Dean is, “but it’s a hunter Sam knows.”
“I have no idea what you were talking about either, but I’m gonna chance a guess that whatever it is, it’s about Dean.” She drops her head backwards and emits a loud groan as if her body was physically protesting her actions. “
real.”
“Um...Cas?”
“Why are you here?” he asks, swaying side to side from his sitting position. The bar is spinning again and he clenches his hands on the table’s edge to steady himself.
John’s sniggers resounds off their backs as they hurry outside into the bitter cold. Sam is set down, eleven and already too gangly and heavy for Cas to carry all the way to the car.
“No,” Cas answers, crossing his arms defiantly.
“And assbutt is my coinage.”
“If you’re talking about your alcohol consumption, then yes,” Sam agrees snootily, striding past Dean with his nose upturned like he’s the Queen of fucking England.
“He’s basically your boyfriend, but without the perks.”
“I know.” Dean bites the edge of his bottom lip. “Er—we’re good though?”
“Dean?”
“Until we find paint.”
Dean and Cas stare at the mug for a moment longer, then look at each other with mute horror.
Cas hesitates for another moment. He takes a deep breath, trying to clear his jumbled thoughts and feelings. He’s failing miserably in that task. Dean’s upper body is rising and falling at a much slower rate than Cas’ pulse is. He finds himself trying to slow it to the beat of his best friend’s inhales and exhales.
“I’ve seen you make out with a few girls, kissed your brother on the cheek, roughhoused with Benny, and cuddle with Rowena on occasion, Dean, but I have
“I did not want to do this in the first place.”
He gives a contented sigh and closes his eyes before answering, “I had read about something called liquid courage. I believed it would have—helped me be…courageous. In pursuing a partner. It seems all it gave me courage to do is maunder nonsensical musings to innocent—” another hiccup. He hates the involuntary myoclonic jerks that humans suffer. “bystanders,” he finishes.
“I said crêpe,” he enunciates with more force this time, face flushing with frustration. It lets Dean know he’s starting to get to him.
“Anything you want, Jack.”
“Like they own the place,” repeats Dean, rolling his eyes. He claps Cas on the shoulder, startling him into a posture that’s straighter than a post. “Come on, let’s get in the shower.”
“You are
His eyes wander towards Eileen, who’s stood up and is now pulling a face at Sam, and something like understanding seems to punch into Sam’s brain. Finally.
Castiel also then belatedly realises that it’s something he said that brought out this expression.
Cas’ deep laughter filters through his phone, warming his insides into goo. “Suck-up.”
He was hoping he could avoid any kind of conversational exchange altogether.
The victory feels a little less victorious than he’d imagined.
“I think it was because he was working on Christmas Eve,” Cas explains reasonably as he stuffs the packet of multicoloured chalks into his trench-coat pocket. “Don’t be mean.”
“Dean,” Cas says gently, “You always have time. Until you take your last breath, you have time to do anything. And me, you know I do…everything for you. I can wait, I can help, I’ve fallen, I’ve rebelled—”
“Then perhaps you should learn what it means,” says Benny.
“We will,” comes Jack’s firm intonation.
The one benefit of being a functional problematic-drinker, for Dean, is that his morning-afters mostly consist of weakness, fatigue, and thirst. Not so much memory loss.
thought. It sounds more like something I would say. Human husky. I like that.”
Cas is barely listening to what Benny is saying.
“I just—I—” Dean squirms, itching the back of his neck. “I don’t know! Maybe it’s because she stabbed you that one time? Why would you want to have sex—excuse me, lose your virginity to that? Why not—why not someone else?”
“It’s not even boxed!” Castiel cries in anguish. “That is outrageously unhygienic!”
“Fuck,” Dean cries, pulling at his hair. He misses Cas below him, pressed against him, lips attached. “Fuck!”
He drops the bacon and shakes his scorched fingertips. “Ow, hot! That’s so hot!”
Dean parries on by sealing his lips to Cas’ again, swallowing his protest.
Cas grins. He recollects the vague memory of Dean once calling him a human husky when they were children.
“Alright, when did this become an intervention?” he snaps, annoyed but barely invested in said annoyance because a lot of other concerns are spinning in the whirlpool of his brain.
that?”
“I think the kids these days are calling it bi or tri or pan or stove or whatever else you want to call it. I’ve seen you around girls. I don’t think you’re gay, but hey, whatever works for you, kid.”
“No, man. We’re never going back there. I’ll work extra hours at the garage. Hell, we’ll live out the car if we have to for a bit—but Sammy, I promise you, we’re going to be okay. You’re going to have the best damn life, Cas here’s gonna help you with your homework while I sort out a permanent place for us to live until you go off to college. I’ll—I’ll figure it out. I’m going to do everything to give you that. Alright, kid?”
“Habit,” mutters the pile of flannel and dirty jeans that’s rolling about more clumsily than a baby armadillo. Once Dean finds his footing, he stands imperiously over Cas only to give him a dirty look. “Was that April I just saw skipping out your door with her shirt inside out? Also, why are you not wearing a shirt?”
“This was
“We’re not—!” He lowers his voice and hisses, “we’re not banging!”
, you idiot. If you aren’t scared, it isn’t courage. There’s a lot of strength in vulnerability, you know.” She kicks him lightly on the shin with her heel for good measure. “Now will you please go out there and sort your shit out? Otherwise, I’m going to start charging you for this therapy session.”
“Cool.” Cool? Dean needs to get out of here right now. Instead, he blurts, “you know how to shave? I could…I could—”
!” he also exclaims.
“You’re thirty-two years old. You should know not to pick food up straight from the pan.” Cas scowls, taking Dean’s fingers into his hands and inspecting them with care. “Of course it’s going to be hot.”
Benny acquiesces, unbothered. “Is this about Cas?”
mouth.
“Lead the way, angel.”
“Cas, buddy, I’m sorry to inform you of this but you’re really not my type and I’m pretty sure I’m not yours either. We’re allowed to share a goddamn bed. It’s only weird if you make it weird. Now will you get the fuck in?”
“I remember when I first gazed at your soul,” Cas continues, lips lifting into a fond smile. His palm drifts from Dean’s arm towards his chest and he presses down on where Dean’s heart is, firmly but gently. It was getting very weird very quickly. Dean’s never felt so nauseous and delighted. “It glows. It’s beautiful. I wish I could still see it as clearly as I did then, even through the fire and sulphur and brimstone.”
“You shouldn’t drag Cas along on all your self-destructive schemes. He’s my friend too. I don’t want you breaking him, Dean.”
“Right. Well. You better get in the shower. You have to leave soon, don’t you? Make sure to text me when you get there, so I don’t worry about you on the road.”
“Yes. My date stood me up.”
At some point, their hands find each other’s again. Dean has one on the steering wheel and another tucked in Cas’.
filled with terrible ideas and I am
“Not gonna.”
“Why’s Sam bringing it up?”
“Yeah.” Dean rubs his temple. “Yeah, maybe. Just—just not tonight. I can’t deal with that tonight.”
Cas collapses onto the floor, heaving big breaths and glaring half-heartedly at Dean who is laughing with joy through his tears.
“And what are you two faggots up to tonight?”
“Brie, Dean.”
Dean’s fingers tighten around his. “You can keep the popcorn and the rest of my snacks, bitch.” He throws the plastic bag full of goods in his other hand at April. “Cas, we’re leaving.”
“Because you let Cassie go so you can hang onto Cas. Because I think you might actually feel the same way he does and you’re just too
“So,” Dean continues, just as Cas is about to turn and leave, “did you fuck ‘em too? Getting around these days, Cas, I gotta say.”
Cas tilts in his head and frowns at Dean in question.
“Um—hey. Everything all right?”
Castiel chuckles, shaking his head. “Not much, I’m afraid. I suppose I may have made quite a fool of myself. I do apologise if I…overstepped with you in any way. You shouldn’t have had to come pick me up like that. It was irresponsible of me.”
“Oh.”
?” Benny shouts maniacally like a man possessed, his arms flying in every direction. It would be a comical sight if he didn’t appear so terrifying amidst his frenzy. “You think you like him! Is that a joke?”
Dean chuckles. “It’s a bit late for that now, don’t you think? Hell, I’m surprised Sam and Eileen have kept their word and not babbled to anyone yet.”
Dean lifts their intertwined hands. “
”Um.”
The Empty retreats, but only hesitantly.
“You’re aware we are pretending to be a couple right now, aren’t you?” Cas says, tipping his head. “Couples usually engage in intercourse.”
Their suggestive little remarks have developed a different edge to it. Something shy and tentative but heated. Cas is blushing a lot more these past couple of days.
Cas yanks back like Dean had just told him he was about to gank him, not that he was in love with the weirdo.
“Um—” Dean swallows, drawing Cas’ attention to the veins on his throat that protrudes with strain. “Sorry. I just—I meant p-practice. For—”
“Yes, Dean,” Cas says, grinning. “The sentiment is very much returned.”
Charlie once said to him on a rainy afternoon, when Rowena’s spell-cracking was headed nowhere and Crowley had irritated him so much during a phone call that his brain had checked out, that Castiel’s face had looked so done. Castiel didn’t quite understand how his facial features could combine together to resemble that of a task finished. Or perhaps a well-cooked piece of meat.
“Oh, Dean,” Cas laments, “I’m so sorry you didn’t get to take my virginity,” he lilts, the joke rolling off his tongue with ease and spearing his brain with a stress headache that he hides with a teasing grin.
“Dean,” Castiel says with more force, and it’s enough for Dean to shift his eyes upwards and face Castiel. “You are not a shitty person.”
“Hey, don’t talk about me like I’m not here!” Dean interjects, pouting crabbily.
“And you said at the beginning of all this that I wouldn’t be your type,” Dean manages to tease, the words accompanied by an uncomfortable clench around his insides.
Dean rubs his eyes with the hilt of his palms. “Yeah. Me too.”
“Why you showerin’ at one in the afternoon?” he grouses, and though it’s directed at Cas, he’s looking down the hallway, unable to meet his eyes, or his pink-flushed cheeks, or his tousled mop of wet hair, a little too endearing and heart-wrenching and—
“You shouldn’t ask people personal questions like that, man. It’s a great way to get punched.”
“Getting ready to fuck you.” Cas’ gut drops and his heart flounders. Then, Dean rolls his eyes. “What does it look like I’m doing, man? I’m going to sleep. It’s been a hell of a long night,” he grouses, slipping beneath the sheets. He shuffles over to make room for another body. “You getting in or what?”
“And now you’re sad.” Cas sits down opposite Dean at the table where he’s littered all his empty bottles, and looks at Dean with pity. Dean despises that look. “What’s wrong?”
“Right,” Dean replies, frowning. “I’m pretty sure I’m just Cas-sexual these days anyway.”
He’s been looking anywhere but at Dean for too long now.
Dean panics. Not again. In three steps, he has Cas’ face in his hands.
It’s too late to turn back once April flourishes the door open. “Hello boys. Come in, come in!”
“What?” Dean shouts. “No!”
“You said I should always say what’s in my head,” retorts Castiel with excessive smugness.
“Yeah, welcome to your forties,” Dean scoffs, trying to not think about Cas being tired, and hungry, and aching, and human. “You’re looking a little grey there too, buddy,” he says, waving at his own hair and jerking his chin at Cas, making light of it, making this easier somehow.
But third? Yes, third. Third would be here, right now, with Death ‘Here’s Johnny’ through the door, the Empty coming for his best friend who has tears streaming down his stubbled cheek as if this is the Big Goodbye.
“Cas.”
They’ve been sitting like that for a couple of hours and would have likely continued doing so had John Winchester not flown through the motel room, stumbling and shouting at a group of his drinking friends with half his body hanging out the doorway. He shouts a few strings of obscenities before kicking the door shut and snapping his attention to the two boys perched closely together on a loveseat.
My bad 😐
here?” Dean retaliates in a screech resembling that of a manic goblin’s.
Sam’s not listening, but he nods along anyway as he shuffles himself and Eileen away.
Dean tenses.
Cas grumbles his assent, sits in shotgun as grumpy as can be, determined not to be the first to breach the rigid silence between them.
we’ve made out before,” Dean reminds him, wriggling his eyebrows.
Cas gives Dean a private teary smile. Dean responds with his own, Jack doesn’t notice, and Sam pretends not to.
“Aw, Cas, I love it when you tell the story of how we met,” Dean lilts in a sing-song voice and tilts forward to bend his forearms onto Cas’ knees. He widens his eyes just a smidge and blinks up adoringly at a wry-looking Cas. “You offering me the fleece off your back at such a tender age of eleven, me being nice enough to later welcome you into my awesome clique even though you were a massive weird nerd—”
Okay, this is my fault. It's going to be three chapters now because I couldn't help myself. I wanted to explore Cas' character from his perspective too, but I also feel like there's some unfinished business with Dean resolving his feelings about himself and about Cas. So here we go, Chapter 2, and in Chapter 3 we will be going back to Dean. Hopefully, I'll be able to wrap it up there and give these two the happy ending they deserve.
Cas’ head flicks up. Their eyes meet, finally. “That doesn’t sound right.”
“This is stupid.”
He reaches out instinctively to touch Dean. It used to be easy like this. He wouldn’t have to think so much if all he wanted to do was to reach out and comfort his friend with touch. He does it now, and maybe they’ve travelled back in time a couple years when Dean trusted him and cared for him and thought of him as a friend, because Dean lets him hold his arm. He doesn’t tense or move away.
“I’d still be here, Dean,” Cas assures him gently, “we would still spend time together.”
Towards predetermined plans.
Castiel wakes up with a headache. He’s not had one since he was last human, and he guesses he’d forgotten how awful they could be. They should call it a head-drilling-screaming-pounding pain. Headache, he scoffs to himself.
“I mean, his eyes are like…the bluest blue to ever blue, if you know what I mean.”
Well, there’s one thing he wishes a little more.
“Fuck!”
“Dean,” he says, rising with ire as well now for this unsolicited hostility. “What the fuck?” he swears, surprising even himself with the blasphemous language.
Eileen bites her lip, holding her composure for about twenty seconds before collapsing into giggles and her husband.
Was this chapter angsty? I can’t tell anymore. Dean and Cas’ fight to me is not even a blip on their friendship because they always seem to bounce back 😌
He doesn’t wait to hear the rest. He pitches his body through throngs of people in search of one, hoping he loses Benny in the process.
“No!”
”Do you know who you stare at all the damn time?”
Sam’s distress doesn’t ebb away. “Are you becoming human again?”
—licks your ear. You’re just too chicken-shit to reject her outright, so you’ve looped yourself into this ouroboros fuck up of uncomfortable friendship and then eventual reluctant drunk sex.”
He exits the room without waiting for Cas and does actually find Sam sat on the floor, looking haunted.
you not to ask her out—“
“It’s called a crêpe, Dean.”
They’re finally looking at each other properly. He’s finally able to, yet again, grip to the blue in Cas’ eyes like it’s a lifeline.
In Cas’ catatonic what-the-fuck state, Dean is able to fully take advantage of the loosened grip on his wrist, not to mention the one on his cheek that has completely left the station and is now gripping tight at the carpet beneath them, and he upends Cas’ body entirely until he is fixed above him.
Also, I felt the need to explain why Charlie and Dorothy seemed a better match for me than the more explicitly canon Charlie x Stevie - we didn’t really get much screen time of their chemistry before she poof’d off the CW for being gay, and our OG Charlie seemed better suited to Dorothy. Just my humble opinion! x
“Soup…might be good,” Castiel says slowly, trying to breathe deeply to fight his gagging.
“Bits and pieces,” he says, suddenly glum. He swirls his soup around with his spoon. It doesn’t look very appetising but the first warm slurp down his gullet does settle his stomach somewhat. And because he’s feeling a bit bitter, he adds to tactically annoy Dean, “I felt like we might have held hands?”
Dean leans in to whisper in Cas’ ear, “she got a home cinema up there or something?”
“I’m sorry,” Castiel says, slinking towards the window. “You don’t need to sit next to me to be polite. There’s plenty of seats available for the next half an hour on this bus. You can go sit somewhere else before everyone gets back.”
One hand pressed against the side of his head that’s throbbing, Castiel waves another at the Chicken and Mushroom can. Dean nods approvingly and goes to open and dispense its contents into a bowl, sticking it in the microwave.
Dean looks away. “You’ll always be my best friend, Cas,” he mumbles, which isn’t technically a lie.
Cas falls into a crouching position. Dean wants to launch forwards.
“Want a some? I’ve got a knife and fork and everything.”
“You do if you’re cutting onions.”
“Cas, honestly, you’re a smart guy. Why would any girl volunteer to put up with you and your...let’s say quirks, if this wasn’t the endgame?” she asks with growing exasperation.
“Gonna go find Cas?” Benny finishes for him.
Dean had picked him up at the bar. He recalls foggily that they might have held hands, but no. That’s something Dean would definitely consider gay, and he’s made it abundantly clear in the past through the parades of women and outright verbal denials that he’s markedly not.
“I wanted my memory foam back. Your mattress is shit, it doesn’t even care enough about you to remember you,” Dean says blithely, circling an arm around Cas to pick up the bacon sizzling away on the pan.
—so he quickly squashes whatever weird feeling it was—definitely not butterflies—and returns to his original purpose.
Now, when they do this, Cas is the one on top of Dean.
“Fancy running into drunk-you here,” she says, offering him her hand to help him to his feet. He takes it gingerly. “Not seen you in awhile, handsome. Especially not this wobbly on your toes. Kismet, wouldn’t you say?”
“I think it’s best if I leave.”
“It’s fake. Cas and me. We aren’t actually together.”
“Some acknowledgment would be nice.”
“Shut your face! Go to sleep. I’ll wake you up when we get to the motel.”
Lisa picks up on it, of course. She was always very smart, and pretty, and bendy, and— “Something going on? I think you’ve only been here twice since we’ve met, Dean...and Cas, I don’t think you’ve ever—”
Dean pauses to take a breath. “For what it’s worth, your quirks? It’s what makes you so special to me. Every inch of who you are is what—what makes you so special to me—and...um...” he chuckles uncomfortably, then seems to change his mind over what he was about to say next, “at least I get you back for movie nights, right?”
“No cute little home projects, no sharing beds on cold nights instead of just turning on the damn heating—it’s really not that expensive, my friend—and
“I really don’t—”
“Easy. Our love burned too brightly so we had to break it off for a little while. See other people. Turns out we’re not bi or gay or straight, we're just somewhere on the spectrum and it was just to each other to hence we were attracted--"
They’re clutched together so tightly in distress with Sam wedged between them that they don’t notice the creak of the door.
“I will try guys. But I can’t promise anything, I never saw anything about Nephilims in here before. But I will try.”
« Dean ? Are you suddenly sick of leather jackets and want to try something new » mockingly asked Sam.
Dean looked at this boy, and smiled at him. After everything they been through, and everything they will have to go through, Dean found the force to smiled at this boy.
He was proud, so proud. Jack went from a new born Nephilim who didn’t know how to control his powers, who killed people by instinct, to a boy capable of… doing that. Gabriel had said that Jack would have no control of his power, and yet Sam and himself were standing, without a single scratch. And from what he could see around them, it was almost a miracle.
“And Castiel? Is he ok? Why isn’t he with you, and why doesn’t he take care of Miracle? He loves animals no?” asked Claire at some point.
So, he chose to go on a hunt, as he always does. This case was found by Donna. A dozen of missing children in a little town not far from Duluth. Why was it their thing ? It was just disappearance, it happened, it was not usually their thing. But one of the missing children was found dead, her head chopped, and drained from her blood. Donna called them as soon as she heard about this case, since she had taken a week off to go visit Jody and the girls.
“Ok, so, now, we come back at the Bunker and we find a way to kill God.” Said the youngest Winchester, already packing all the stuff he used for the spell.
“I don’t know. They were already in capital letters on the notes, I just let them.”
I hope you're having a good day and that everything is going well for you guys!
“We have everything we need in here. We can start making whatever this thing is.” Dean finally said, after looking at the paper for some minutes, asking himself the same question over and over, what will they do when every ingredient will be put together?
So, they went back to their place, expecting answers this time, even if they had to be.. persuasive. Dean parked the impala just in front of their house, but he didn’t leave, when Sam did. The younger brother leaned, to see what Dean was doing, instead of coming. He expected nothing, but what he saw was definitely not something he ever could have imagined, coming from Dean.
The two of them then decided to take some time, since the weather was great. They deserved a little time taking care of themselves, for once. They were walking, enjoying the sun, bright and high in the sky, and Dean was searching for a place to eat some pie, when he saw it. It was nothing, just a piece of cloth, but it made him stop. This little thing was full of memory. It was a trench coat. Why did he felt so nostalgic seeing this ? He never wore one, none of his loved ones ever even owned one, so why ? It didn’t make any sense. But the feeling of nostalgia and sadness didn’t seem to go away, and it was adding to the emptiness he was experiencing for a few days now. Sam stopped too when he saw that Dean wasn’t next to him anymore, and turned around, to see his brother frozen, in front of the vitrine of a shop, selling, amongst other things, trench coats.
“Happy for you kiddo. And yeah, it’s been a while, I’m glad we’re here.” Dean declared.
The hunter let Miracle jump off the car, and walked to the barn, his dog right next to him. Miracle and Dean understood each other, and the dog always stayed close to him when they were outside. Dean pushed the door, and everything in this place made him go back 12 years ago. Nothing had change here, all the sigils that Bobby and he put here where still perfect. It was like time had frozen here, that it had been several hours since someone entered the barn, and not 12 years.
« Too late, I already told Donna we were on our way. »
They stayed like that for a few hours. Dean was still thinking about Castiel, but it was calm thoughts. He didn’t want to cry anymore, he didn’t wish he could just forget everything. He was thinking about him, and he tried to be happy for him. He tried not to think of his death, because that was still unbearable, but his memory was the most comforting thing in this instant. He was living, smiling, laughing with Jack and Sam. Castiel may not be here, but his memory, his legacy continued to accompany them in their journey.
“No, he… Well… he died. Protecting me.” Dean scratched his neck, hoping that nobody would continue talking about that. If he had to talk about his death, he would lose it. He didn’t know if he could hold his tears. And he refused to cry, not in front of all of them.
“Hello Kevin. Sorry to interrupt... Well... Whatever was going to happen to you.” Said Dean.
Dean, Sam and Eileen choked. Jack didn’t realize.
They did it. Chuck was gone, for good. Jack became the new God, and everything was great. Sam and Dean will finally be able to live their lives as they wanted to, as they deserved to. Hitting the road, hunting monsters, the family business. The Winchesters were finally free.
They haven’t left the place when Sam woke up and joined them in the kitchen. The man, unlike his brother, did fall asleep. He didn’t get a lot of sleep, but it was way better than what Dean and Jack had -which wasn’t hard since they didn’t sleep at all-. For some reasons, after this night without sleep, Jack just seemed to not care and was feeling great, but it was not the case for Dean. He was a grown-up adult, he needed sleep, but once again, he just couldn’t fall asleep, and Sam could see how tired Dean was. He could see, and he was worried. He didn’t know why Dean was feeling this bad, like, sure, remembering Cas and learning that their calm life was one of God manipulation was disruptive, but was it that much? Dean just seemed to feel even worse than he did before Chuck’s revelation, and Sam just didn’t understand why. Of course, Dean was closer to Castiel than Sam was, but he wasn’t sure that it could explain the huge difference between what he was feeling and what Dean was feeling. Maybe the two of them finally decided to date when the angel died, and that was the explanation for Dean’s behavior, but he wasn’t sure. Dean already lost someone he was dating, he lost Lisa, and he haven’t felt this bad. Sam didn’t know, but definitely didn’t want to ask. His brother was already feeling bad enough.
They then agreed to leave a portal open, that only them would be able to go through, linking Rowena’s palace to the bunker. This way, they could travel here to require the witch’s help, without having to leave someone behind, and it would be far more convenient for all of them. No need to find a demon, they just had to show up whenever they needed anything.
Dean was still looking at the screen in front of him. He was in the middle of a dilemma with himself. One of them will probably have to die, to save Jack and the entire world. He knew it had to be him, he could never lose his brother. He could never let Sam risk his life, with all he still had to live, with Eileen for starters. He had to be the soul that Jack will touch. But what if he died? That wouldn’t have been a big problem before, he knew that dying was his destiny anyway, but he was thinking about Cas. Cas who sacrificed himself so Dean could live. Was he really ready to risk his life two months after that? He didn’t want Cas’ death to be for nothing. But what choice did he have? Once again, he could never let Sam risk his life.
Dean could breathe, and he didn’t have the entire world on his shoulders. For a few hours, they were free, and they were just going far away. But soon, too soon, they had to come back to reality. In front of them, proudly standing in front of a lake, was the house that saw Jack’s birth. This place brought so many memories back. This place was technically somewhere they only spent a few days on, but it felt like it was the beginning of everything. It felt like the beginning and the end.
(See the end of the chapter for
They left the lake when the sun had fully disappeared and the only light they had was the moon, high in the sky. They came back at the cabin, not wanting to do the ritual in the dark. They would sleep and give Jack his power back in the morning. They were ready, and fortunately for them, they still didn’t know about the destruction of the cities.
Jack made him a sandwich, without a word. This snack made him think about Castiel, because it was his favorite human food. He wished really hard that his dad could be here, with them. For as long as he knew him, Castiel never gave up, and he always trusted him. Jack, a Nephilim, supposed to be a tool for chaos and destruction, and no matter what happened, Castiel always believed in him, and he knew from the beginning that he was going to be a good person.
When Dean and Sam came back to the bunker, Eileen and Jack were waiting for them, the hunter learning some sign language to the Nephilim. The scene was sweet, and the brothers came closer without a noise. They didn’t want this scene to stop, they all had to live through so much, having a bit of calm and sweetness couldn’t hurt them. They deserved to have moments like those ones, living a normal and happy life.
But Dean made him a sign, telling him to turn over, and Jack saw God. The boy choked. How could Chuck be here, and with power with what he could feel? He took all of his power, he was God, he made sure Chuck was left powerless and he made sure he couldn’t get his powers back, but now he felt power, coming from him, a lot of power. He was glowing, he definitely had his mojo back, and none of them, especially Jack, knew how this could have happened. He turned back, to see the Winchesters as confused as him, minus the shock, since they had the time to process the information. Chuck snapped his fingers, and as it did with Sam and Eileen, Jack remembered Castiel. God has made sure that nobody could remember Castiel, because otherwise, the angel always tended to come back, even when He didn’t want to.
Dean was already gone when Sam tried to talk back. He wanted to do something, Dean couldn’t stand doing nothing, he already tried this morning, after waking up at 6am because he had a nightmare, and it was too hard. His feeling was getting worse and worse, and he just wanted it to stop, and hunting always helped him when things got bad. He didn’t know if this time would be the same, since it was because of his last hunt that he was feeling this bad.
“One hour I think.” Sam replied. He didn’t even try to argue with his brother that they should take their time or whatever. He knew they didn’t have the luxury to wait anymore, they had to act quick, because Chuck won’t wait like he said he would.
Chuck. Chuck was standing in front of the car, and he definitely wasn’t here the second before. Dean got out of the car immediately when he saw God. He definitely popped out of nowhere, which was literally impossible since he was powerless. He was just a common human, he could not just appear or disappear as he wanted to.
When he finally got to calm down completely, a few hours had passed. During all this time, he had stayed silent. Sam was by his side, his arm resting on Dean’s shoulders. At some point, Claire let Miracle leave the house, and the dog came close to Dean, and put his head on his lap. Dean felt way better now. He never felt like crying helped at all, but in this exact moment, it has been the only thing that helped.
This news woke Sam up. This was the crazy brilliant idea they were all waiting for. They just needed someone to read it for them, and asking Donatello was a very bad idea. They knew he was connected to God, and that it could reduce their chance of success by a hundred percent. God must have been watching his prophet, ready to accelerate Earth’s destruction if the Winchesters were going to try something.
Dean and Jack stayed here during the whole night, without talking much, just sitting in front of the other. None of them were expecting the other to talk. They understood each other, sharing the same feeling, missing Cas, and wishing they could be able to do something for him. Wishing they could have been able to do something for him, instead of letting him alone in the Empty during all this time.
“Winfield… Wait. Gabriel had a storage unit in Winfield, didn’t he? Do you think he could have hidden something there for us to find?”
“Sam! Sorry, don’t have time to let you sleep, I may have something. A latin note about angels, I don’t know I don’t speak latin. Hurry up, I’ll make you coffee, promise.”
Dean rolled his eyes.
After coming back to the Bunker, and sleeping a few hours, Jack, Sam and Dean sat down in front of the TV, Gabriel’s DVD in it. Explaining to the Nephilim what was happening in the DVD and why was his uncle surrounded by three women without any clothes was really uncomfortable, even more than when Dean had to explain what was pornography to Castiel, and they chose to not explain, and to tell him to focus more on what Gabe would say.
“You won’t have to. Everything is going to be ok, Dean. I promise.”
“Sure. Nothing to do with the pretty angel you’re missing so much.” The ginger replied.
“Well, I think that we all deserve to sleep. We won’t do anything in the state that we’re in right now. We’ll start thinking about what we’ll do tomorrow.” Replied Sam.
They looked at each other, without a world, while Jack was slowly calming down. When he finally realized what just happened, he turned around, and see the three other people in the room still in shock because of what they just witnessed. Jack used his powers, which he wasn’t supposed to have anymore. He was supposed to be entirely powerless, God was supposed to have taken every bit of power in his body, but here he was, throwing tables across the room, without having to touch them.
“Sam, I think you should look at what Dean wrote here...” Jack was holding the paper at Sam’s height.
They all let their stuff in the cabin, agreeing that they would take the day to just relax, and prepare themselves for what was going to happen. They sat together in front of the lake, a bottle of beer in hand. Unaware of the chaos around them, they felt like they were closer to happiness that they had been in their entire life.
“He had made a deal with the Empty, to save Jack in Heaven. When he would experience real happiness, it would come and get him. But you know that. And you know that he experienced happiness. But... He told me he loved me, Sammy. He told me he loved me, that he cared about everything because of me. He told me he loved me, and I didn’t say anything. And the Empty appeared to take him. His happiness was to say that he loved me, and I didn’t fucking say anything. What the hell was I supposed to say anyway? He fucking died. And I didn’t say anything.” He remembered every word Cas told him, this very day. He remembered every look, every intonation. He remembered Cas crying, he remembered the Empty. He remembered too much, and it hurt like hell. He remembered his angel’s look, the smile on his fucking face when he told him he loved him. He remembered the exact moment he understood that it was the end, that he just lost his best friend. He remembered everything, as it happened yesterday.
After they all agreed on the plan -the lack of plan if we wanted to be precise-, the three of them began to mix all of the ingredients together. The harder was to scratch enough blood off of Dean’s jacket, without any fiber of the said jacket, but they all had known worse obstacle. When everything had been put together, they all looked at each other with a disappointed look. Nothing had happened, not a light, not a sign that what they were doing was good. They just had to try doing things now.
“Then I should find a way to bring him back, is that what you want?” she finally asked after what seemed like a thousand years for the hunter.
Dean was the first one to get on foot. He was still pretty messed up, and had to lean on a tree -or what was left of it- to stay stand. Sam was the next one to stand up, but he was fine, he was perfectly fine. Jack was the last one, and the first thing he did was to move a branch with his mind, making sure he still had his power, and they did not do all of that for nothing. But everything was perfect, he felt complete, he had his power, and both of the hunters were fine. When he felt his power suddenly growing, when he felt he could not control what was going to happen, he had started panicking, and begging (to whom, he didn’t know) to spare Sam and Dean, to let them be ok at the end. And it worked. They were all fine.
When all of them were finally ready, they met in the garden. In front of them were the ashes of the funeral pyre they made a few years ago when Castiel died the night Jack was born. This memory would have done nothing to the Winchesters and Jack if the angel had been with them, and not dead again in a place they were not sure anymore that they could make him escape, even when Jack would have his powers again. None of them knew how he had been able to wake him up the first time, all they knew was that Jack wanted him to be here so bad and it worked, Castiel had woken up. But the nephilim was alone at that time, Dean hated him, Sam was trying to make things ok but Jack felt like he didn’t fully trust him either. He was a new born, and the only man he trusted, since before he was born, died before he could really know him. He was so lost, he acted with instinct and nothing else. Now that he was loved and trusted, now that he had a family, he wasn’t sure he could act this way anymore.
“First of all, it doesn’t help either for Jack’s problem or for Cas. And.. What the hell is this last part? I mean, vampires are nephilims beloved? What?” asked Dean, confused as hell.
When they entered the bunker, Miracle was waiting for them, surprising Eileen and Jack. Knowing that Dean hated animals, they didn’t expect him to let Sam have a dog in the bunker, where they spent most of their time. The surprise was even bigger when they saw Miracle jumping on Dean, and that is only reaction was to laugh, truly happy. Miracle was his only source of joy this last month, as surprising as it was coming from Dean. After introducing his dog to Eileen and Jack, they sat around the war table, and after Dean grabbed beers for all of them, they start talking.
Dean finally stopped crying, and after a few minutes, he stood up and smiled at his brother. He really did feel way better. He still felt numb and the hole in his stomach still wasn’t filled, but he felt like he could breathe again, which was a lot. It was probably the best he had felt in months. He was smiling at Sam, telling him that he was fine, and that they should got back in the house to say good bye, since the place of Jack’s birth was still a few hours away. Sam knew his brother like he knew himself. He knew that Dean wasn’t as peachy as he wanted him to believe. He knew that he was still struggling, and that he was probably still holding some tears. But he also knew better than pushing him into talking about his feelings. Dean had open up, he had told him what was happening, and it was something big. Sam knew that his brother would not want to continue this conversation. Not right now anyway. And Sam could understand, so he just nodded and stood up, following Dean in Jody’s house.
“Should we... Come back at the bunker? Trying to see what we can do?” Questioned Sam, breaking the oppressive silence.
They did the whole trip to Jody’s house in a row, stopping only once to let Miracle run a bit, since he hated being in the car for too long. Leaning on his car, Dean felt like he was on a family vacation. Jack was cheerily playing with Miracle on the grass, and Sam was paying for the gas. From instinct, Dean turned his head to talk to Cas, ready to mock him when he won’t get the reference he would do to a random movie, and his face darkened when he realized once again that he was alone. No Cas next to him, no stupid trench coat, no stupidly beautiful blue eyes in which he could get lost during hours. Nothing, Cas wasn’t here. His left hand went to his pocket, touching the mixtape, promising himself for the hundredth time that he would see Cas soon.
The two of them stood up, quickly kissed, smiled at each other, and Eileen went packing her stuff while Sam sat back in his chair, still smiling. He always, for obvious reasons (all of his girlfriends died), thought that he wasn’t meant for loving someone, but Eileen made him feel great, and like, yes she died, two times already, but she always came back, proving with hard facts that she was in a way a Winchester too.
But the Winchesters didn’t know. They haven’t realized yet that they will have to rush things, because they thought He would wait a few months. They didn’t know that everything had start. They will soon enough, but for the moment, they still were feeling the same way they did leaving Sioux Falls. For the moment, the only problem they seemed to have was Jack asking to put something else than Dean’s music. Dean was absolutely horrified to hear him saying that “he heard enough classic rock for his whole life, and he was technically immortal”. Dean had to argue with both his brother and the half-angel to explain them that no, you can’t have heard “enough classic rock”, because it was the only acceptable music genre. Dean felt good, it was like they went back ten years ago, when all they had to worry about was fighting monsters, when they didn’t even know about all this angel and God crap. When life was easy. Not knowing what was happening in the world, Dean could breathe, he could feel things like he was supposed to. He still had the comforting touch of the mixtape against him, but all he could think about was the good time he had with Castiel, with his brother, with all the persons he ever loved, and not the despair and the loneliness.
But even hours after they start reading, none of them had this idea that would resolve everything. They were starting to despair. It was annoying, something was right, but the second after, everything felt apart and they didn’t find anything. It used to never happen, they used to find things pretty quickly, or at least, when they started finding answer, they didn’t have time where they just felt hopeless, because they always used to find answers to all of the other questions they had, and quickly. But they knew it was just because God was writing their story, and a story where characters are getting desperate is not a good thing. A writer always have to help his characters into finding their answers, finding a way to defeated what they needed to defeat. But now, they were alone, without anyone writing their story, and they had to experience the same life as everyone, the same desperation as every human on this Earth trying to find answers.
Suddenly, everything was pain. Pain and light. The light blinded all of them. It was like the sun came on Earth. Sam had to protect his eyes with his arms, trying not to close them as Jack could tell him anytime it was time for him to start the spell. Dean was still standing straight, but he didn’t even see the light. The pain was all he could feel right now. The entire world around him had disappeared, he didn’t feel the ground under his feet, he didn’t feel the wind blowing against his whole body. He couldn’t feel anything except the unbearable pain. It was not like anything he knew from pain. Those years in hell felt like vacation compared to this exact moment. He didn’t really know if he could compare those two things anyway.
After breakfast, and after Dean and Miracle went for their everyday walk, the whole team met up in the common room, where they were going to spend the most of their time for the next few days, or even weeks. They were all going to start their researchs, when Eileen saw someone calling her, a hunter, in search for help in a difficult hunt. After talking for a bit, she hung up and looked at the boys.
Sam was trying not to think. Since this afternoon, the feeling didn’t leave him. It had, since now, faded after some hours, but even in the impala, he felt unsafe. It was definitely unusual, and he hated that. The impala was supposed to be one of their safest places on earth, it was like home, the only thing that has been here since they were born. The impala was the exact definition of home, and Sam always felt better when he was in it, but this time.. He wasn’t. It was even worse. And it got even worse, when they arrived in Lebanon, and he saw a woman, talking to somebody. He could have swore he knew her, but he had no idea where or why. But Sam’s sensation definitely worsened after seeing her.
Dean tried to argue, but he couldn’t. He knew that they were right, and that he, probably more than the others, needed sleep. He sighed, and patted Miracle between the ears, without a word, listening to the others talking about this month, and what they all did. Eileen was trying to find a new job, because hunting just seemed... odd to her, and Jack was rebuilding heaven into something better, creating new angels for starter. Everything could have worked for them, if only it wasn’t just another God’s plan.
But when he got out of the room, he realized he didn’t know where she was anymore. It was bad, really bad. Chuck was aware of the fact that Jack had his powers back, and he was aware that they were trying to get Cas back. Everything was going down, they were fucked, and it was all his fault, again. If he didn’t have the need to save Cas more than he wanted to save the world, Rowena would not have learned that Jack had his power back, and she would have not learned about Castiel. From now on, bringing him back should be the least of their priority, because it was almost certain that they will never be able to do so. But Dean could not see this action as the last thing they would do, when they would have the time. It was already too late anyway, God knew. It was almost sure that they had lost, at least he wanted to lose with Castiel telling him he was a good man, with Castiel telling him it was not his fault, he had done all he could have done. If he had to be perfectly honest, he didn’t want to lose with Castiel to see him reassure Dean. He wanted to lose with Castiel, because the angel meant too much for him, and being with him at the very end would prove that they had won anyway.
“I’ll go. You guys keep searching in the books, you’re better than me at this crap anyway.” Said the oldest Winchester, and none of the other complained.
The road they took after was calm, and not only because they were. For a reason they didn’t understand, there were no traffic, almost no car on the road, which was surprising considering the time of the day. Usually there was a shit ton of people outside of Sioux Falls, coming back for work, visiting a family member, anything, but for once they were just alone. They enjoyed this loneliness, without realizing that it meant that Chuck already began the world’s destruction. People were not on the road, because people were occupied in the cities, watching their whole world collapse, literally. In all the big cities, buildings were falling to the ground, the streets were destroyed, fires started everywhere. The world was starting to fall apart, and people didn’t understand. Once second, life was normal, and the second after, panic was running across the streets. The end of the world was close, and every person seeing those things happening could understand that. No need to know about the supernatural to see how bad things were. The world had begun to collapse, and no scientist, no politician, absolutely nobody could understand why. People will soon go crazy. Soon, and everywhere in the world, people will start fighting, they will start civil wars, trying to overthrow governments, killing each other, being the worst a human can be.
Sam was really interested in everything they said, asking questions on Patience’s school and application for next year’s university, talking to Alex about nursing (he knew a lot, since Jessica -the girlfriend who died on a fire- was studying to become one), and giving hunting advice to the girls. This last part made Jody sighed, and asking him to not encourage them, she already had struggle to see all of her girls together.
“Thanks Jack, I missed this power I left you, it wasn’t much but it still annoyed me. Now, I’m going to go… And this time, I will destroy your little earth. I won’t try to find you a use, you’ll die. Slowly. And I will enjoy every minute of your finale fall. You won’t ever, ever, be able to stop me. Don’t even try, enjoy your last months in your last apocalypse. It’s so sad that you didn’t do what you had to. Because of you, billions of people are going to die, thousands of alternate universes already had been destroyed, just because of you two, Winchesters.”
A few minutes ago, they all felt like fighting was useless, they didn’t have any hope left, but this simple declaration, this « something » made them believe once again. If Jack had power, even just a little bit, they could kill God. They could do it, they will do it. With Jack, their combat wasn’t completely vain. Yes, they weren’t able to kill God the first time, but the Nephilim had been able to made God almost powerless, and they could have killed him. Maybe it was just because it was what God wanted them to do, but it meant that they could do something. Their fight wasn’t already lost, they could see a light of hope, a possible happy end.
Dean was being sincere. When this conversation happened, everything that mattered was to kill God once and for good, but it was stupid. He shouldn’t have said that, because he had never thought that. Sure, in the beginning he definitely didn’t trust the blond boy, but with all this time they spent together, he would have given his life for him, without a doubt. Just like he would with Sam, or Cas, or even Charlie and Bobby. They were his family.
“Ok. What are we doing first guys?” asked Sam, putting all of his belongings on the floor, deciding they would put them in their room when they would take a break to sleep at some point.
They were ready to go before sundown. Sam had prepared everything, and Dean had been able to fall asleep, just for an hour, but at least, he wasn’t going to collapse at any moment. He had just needed some hope, something to believe in. When he came back in the room with the others, everything was ready. Sam just had to recite the spell, and they would be in Hell. It could probably be something scary, but at this moment, in this room, it seemed like a fairy tale, like an incredible thing. The Winchester didn’t fear Hell, they stopped long ago, and the person they were going to visit made it even easier. It would be ok, everything will be ok, and they will find a way to give Jack all his mojo back.
“Kevin, we need your help. But we can’t really explain to you what is happening.” started Sam. “We just need you to try to find something about nephilim’s power in here.”
Dean was feeling hopeless, and he did what he knew best in those moments. He closed his eyes, and start praying. He hasn’t done that in months, because until now, Castiel was always close, or he didn’t want to see him, or he didn’t even remember him. But know, alone in this barn, his mind unable to think of anything else than Castiel, he prayed again. He prayed to Cas, begging him to wake up, to annoy the Empty again, to come back, as he always did. He begged him to listen to him, to be somewhere, to be awake. He needed him to be awake, to hear him. He begged, he prayed, he cried even, during hours. But nothing, not a single sign, not the slightest thing. He was alone, and he was so lost.
(See the end of the chapter for
The girl seemed as surprised as Sam, until Chuck snap once again, making them immediately remember. They looked at each other, not understanding anything. What was happening here? They remembered the other, and they didn’t understand how it was possible that they didn’t until know.
All the leads they had since the beginning made him felt like he was in an emotional roller coaster, all the freaking time. One minute he was fine, his hopes were high and he felt like they were doing to defeat God, and the second after, the world didn’t matter anymore, and he knew that their efforts were vain.
“Well, no. I can’t have you feeling sad because you don’t remember him, so you will feel sad because you will never be able to save him. Now, Jack if you will…”
When they all agree that it was the good thing to do, Dean left the chair he was sitting on.
Have a nice week <3
The boys were somehow relieved. They had a powerful ally, that could provide them an army if they needed. In a war against God, having Hell as your ally was a good thing. They couldn’t trust Heaven and they couldn’t trust most of the humans. It was probably the first time that the only one they could trust was Hell.
Dean stood up, without a single word, and left the room. Heck, he even left the house. He started feeling tears running on his cheeks, as he continued walking outside. His vision was blurry, he didn’t really know where he was going. He fell on the floor at some point, still crying and sobbing. Once again, he was blaming himself for being this sad. He never had been this sad, not when Dad died, not when Mom died. Not even when Sam died. It felt worse, so much worse this time. He didn’t even know why, and it was killing him.
“Well… I don’t know Dean. It could have been worse… I think we should keep doing like she was not controlled by God, and see where it goes. We can stay vigilant around her or Kevin, but I’m not sure we should stop everything because of that.”
Once they all agreed on this part, they asked Rowena if there was something to do, to help Jack regain his powers quicker. They could wait, they knew that, if he had even just a little bit of power, he could become powerful, just by waiting. But they didn’t have any time left, they had to act quick. They knew that God would take his time, but he won’t let them beat him. They had to consider that they only had a few months left. Jack had to be in full capacity as soon as possible. But Rowena couldn’t do anything. She could have, maybe, if Jack was only an angel, and it wasn’t even sure, but a Nephilim, son of Lucifer? No, even her couldn’t do anything for them. But she assured them that whatever they needed, she would be here, and she would help them. After all, even if she hadn’t been fond of the Winchesters boys, God was threatening everyone, Earth, Heaven and Hell. As a queen, she had to protect her kingdom.
I just want to tell you that i wrote something else (it's not a fanfic tho) that you can find here : https://asphodcle.tumblr.com/post/640961748665548800/tw-death-and-suicide-of-fictional-characters
“Jack. Let’s go home ok? We’ll find a way.”
After a few minutes trying to find Rowena, he understood that it was meaningless. She knew the palace way better than he did, and if she didn’t want to be found, he would never find her. He came back to the room that was connecting Hell to the Bunker, and walked through the portal, the quicker he could. He then ran toward the war room where he knew he would find Jack and Sam.
“Ok stop. Let’s eat, we’re all hungry.”
“Rowena. Bring us to Kevin Tran.”
I hope you'll enjoy the new chapter <3
I hope you'll still like this fanfic <3
And on this word, she left the room without saying good bye. This whole conversation had been so weird, Rowena really was out of character. First, she didn’t gave her opinion on a situation she would have loved to be a part of (seeing how she talked to Cas and him when they were mad at each other the last time, she would definitely have loved to tell him how he should act), and then she said that she was proud of Crowley? It was too strange to be normal. It was at this exact moment that it clicked in Dean’s mind. An out of character behavior? That happened before. When Chuck was controlling them. His vision blurred out of rage, and he got out of the room as quick as possible, a blade in his hand. Rowena was already dead, it would probably do nothing, but he didn’t have anything else, and didn’t want to wait, in case Chuck could learn that he found out about controlling the witch.
“Chuck. Answer to me. What the hell is happening. You’re not supposed to have power. Jack literally took all of your power and made it his.” Dean said, anger in his voice.
Jack didn’t speak. He didn’t, because he couldn’t reassure Dean. He had stopped believing the second he finished the first book he read today. He stopped because he understood that no matter what they did, it was too late. And it was his fault, he was responsible. Without him, without his birth, God would have never decided to destroy the world in the first place. If he had died on this cemetery, if he had forced Dean to kill him, they would have been alive and somehow free, now. God would have had what he wanted. All of this was happening because of him. And because he had the chance to beat God, but failed. He let God play with him, making him believe that he didn’t have power anymore, while he still did. Jack start talking with a shaking voice, due to how angry with himself he was.
“Sam is right,” said Eileen “you two stopped unstoppable things more than once, we have to believe that you’ll again, because you’re our biggest and only hope.”
Dean was feeling sleep taking over, and was thinking about heading his bed, when a note scribbled on the side of the text draw his attention. It was written in a hurry, like the person was trying to hide an information from someone, and just wrote it there when they weren’t watching, to make sure someone would find it someday. It had nothing to do with the book it was written on, or at least, he thought it didn’t, since it was written in latin and he only had pretty basic notion of latin, but yeah, he definitely could understand « angelus », and he definitely could say that it had nothing to do with « hunting werewolves in Europe », which was technically the topic of the book. He stopped reading right there, observing this note. He knew he was supposed to run to Sam and make him translate whatever shit was written here, but he didn’t stood up. It felt surreal. It was a lead, the first one since they started working. To be honest, he wasn’t even sure that it could be a clue, but he had the gut that this scribble was important.
Dean took a deep breath, turned the engine off and get out of Baby. The place was exactly the same as they left it the last time. It shouldn’t surprise him, after all, only 3 years had passed. Even the barn where he met Castiel hadn’t change, and it had been 12 years, it was not surprising that in three years, this place had stayed the same. But, even knowing that, it still surprised him. He expected it to reflect how fucked up their life had been, he expected the house to be barely standing, with one or two walls collapsed. He expected the plants to have died, the lake to be dried. But no, everything was the same. He didn’t know if he found that comforting or terrifying, but he could tell that Jack was getting emotional, seeing this place after so long. He didn’t remember it well, since he didn’t stay long enough to, and he was just born. It was where he met Sam and Dean, where he had the strongest link with his mother. It was also the place where he saw Castiel dead. This place wasn’t solely filled with good memories, but Jack felt great here anyway.
At the end of the day, they were ready. They didn’t prepare much, since no big spell was required. They just needed Dean’s soul, but, just in case, they took some important items that could help if they came to an unexpected event, or to protect the place. They also had to make some research, trying to find a way to cover up Jack’s use of his power from God. From what they had been able to understand, they only needed a minute of protection, and even less since Sam was going to be here, ready to trigger whatever they’ll use right before Jack have his powers back. They actually found a spell, that would allow them not to be seen by God. If they did it correctly, he should still be able to feel like they’re in this world, but not anything else. The spell would last 30 seconds, but it should be enough time, if they coordinated correctly. They won’t have a second chance this time, but it was only a question of timing, nothing they couldn’t handle, Jack only had to inform Sam to start the spell a few second before he would stop touching Dean’s soul.
