But you still find the need to tell me I shouldn't help him?"
John was quickly becoming more confused and over whelmed by the second, he had to say something, "Alright boys, stop, so you have a brother, who you never talk about because he was disgraced by your family, he took up a "
"Why would Sherlock need to go there anyway?" Sherlock looks at him with a look that says
The door opens and a man shorter than John must be about 5,5' stands there blocking the entry. He had grey eyes, that looked like a dark red in the red glow of the lights, looking further at the mans face, john noticed he had some facial hair, neatly trimmed into a goatee. John also noticed both of his ears had stretcher tunnels in them, and he had a lot more piercings on both ears, his nose was also pierced on the septum and had been stretched as the bar was a lot chunkier than the normal sized bar. Roaming his eyes down to his body, he was muscular all over, every inch of him was defined and when he moved his weight from one leg to the other, John could see every muscle in his body flex and move too, he was army ready and could quite easily take John on and have a fair chance of winning. He had a lot of body hair like Marcus but it was neatly trimmed like his beard.
Marcus sighs, "Sherlock wants to go undercover as one of my sex workers slash strippers" he makes a slash movement with his hand. John looks between the two in shock his arms coming unfolded as it sinks in what he just heard.  Marcus faces Sherlock again, "I mean seriously Sherlock, just because you could out shine me any day, at what I do doesn't mean you should, you could get killed, and if he gets you too...".
I would love to get some constructive criticism and also excuse any spelling mistakes or punctuation errors I have dyslexia so it can be easy for me to miss them.
Update I'm back, sorry that was an extremely long break but I'm finally ready to work on this project again. I have updated chapters because they didn't make much sense and improved my old work, but the chapters are basically the same. I hope to be writing more soon - CMP <3
"Sherlock and I", John hears Sherlock mutter, Peter gives a cheery laugh, clearly hearing Sherlock's correction too,
John stands up fast and pulls his gun of of his pocket, "DON'T!", the panic was thick and clear in Sherlock's voice, Peter looked dumb founded that John had pulled a gun out on him,"Give me one reason why I shouldn't Sherlock", John looks angrily at Peter, who lets go of Sherlock's hair once his body catches up to his brain and Sherlock moves in front of Peter blocking him for the gun, "because John, It's all part of his job", John looked confused at Sherlock, Sherlock rolls his eyes but doesn't move away from Peter,
Marcus had told them that on week day that club opens at nine, Monday, Tuesdays and Thursdays, "people are less likely to come to the club in the week days for obvious reasons, family, work, the list goes on", and that it opens at eight on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, "Most people aren't in until about eight thirty though, probably because they want to be in when it's the busiest" Marcus shrugs. Marcus then looks at his watch, "So you still got a little time before people start coming in, its only just turning eight now".
John was starting to wonder if all the Holmes brothers spoke in rhyme, even if Marcus is a lot more normal than the other two brothers, he is indefinitely a Holmes. "Right, as much as I would love to stand around and try to piece together what you are talking about, I don't think I have enough time too" John crosses his arms and looks expectantly at the two brothers.
John checked the time on his phone "6:50", Sherlock must be ready by now. John walked down stairs to the living room, but Sherlock wasn't anywhere to be seen yet. So John sat down on the couch, he did suppose he had 10 more minutes before they had to go, but just encase, "Sherlock, you ready yet mate?" John called, he heard some moment from Sherlock room, "yes John, give me a second", and the few seconds later Sherlock came out, except he wasn't sure if it was Sherlock at first and then the realisation kicked in.
(See the end of the chapter for
John got up and stretched, "I'm gonna make some tea, do you want some?" John asked Sherlock over his shoulder, as he walked into the kitchen. "No, sorry John, I won't be having tea today" Sherlock bounced up and rushed to the door, "I just need to pop out to get some stuff" He raped his scarf around his neck as he talked, "I will be back about six, don't worry about me" Sherlock grabbed his coat and ran down the stairs, "oh, alright then, see you later I guess", John shouldn't be surprised, Sherlock had just got case, hes probably going to go to Greg or Molly. John turned back around, just as he heard the door to 221B slam shut.
This was... new. John found he was blushing and having a hard time fighting back the creeping feeling of lust. He can't feel like that about Sherlock, he's not gay and Sherlock, well he didn't know what Sherlock was, but he didn't think Sherlock liked anyone. John clears his throat as he realises he's been staring. Sherlock, on the other hand had been staring at him intensely, under his thick lashes, but stops when John clears his throat, "Don't blame me for the outfit John, it was Marcus's idea, he said it would make me look "sexy", and he said it would help me blend in too" Sherlock looks down at himself, before looking back up to john,
Peter's shoulders relaxed and he smiled back, "Can you turn around and sit on the chair please, Sherlock", Sherlock instantly does as he is told but avoids Peters eyes, Peters expression clouds over as he try's to get the man to look at him. John barely had enough time to register Peters facial expression before Peter exploded, "LOOK AT ME WHEN I TALK TO YOU!", Sherlock raped his fingers around the leather strap on Peters chest and pulled him up so they where at eye level, Sherlock looked him dead in the eyes and said, "You are not the man I want", He lets go of Peter, but Peters expression isn't angry or upset, he's smirking. Peter looks at John, "Have you ever wondered how to tame a brat John", and with one swift move, the spins Sherlock over onto all fours and kneels next to him pulling his head back by grabbing a fist full of black curly hair in his hand.
" because it was a training room and it is Peters job to train the new sex workers and strippers and show them how best to please the customers. John watched as Peter ran his hands down Sherlock's Sides, Moving effortlessly over his ribs, "What I want to know", Peters voice spoke braking threw the silents, that had come over the room, "Is who damaged the merchandise", He runs his hands over some scars and cuts Sherlock had gotten from getting to close to criminals in there adventures.
John snickers dryly. “You know you hit rock bottom when Sherlock Holmes starts giving you relationship advice.”
“Yeah, actually, very well… What are you watching?”
John must have been feeling his eyes on him, because he’s looking at Sherlock now, the edge of his lips crooked up in a smile.
“We had a good time today,” he whispers, kissing the top of her head where her blond hair are growing. She looks more and more like Mary every day.
John cares about him. A fact.
"you have been reading the papers haven't you John?" Sherlock questions raising a brow, knowing for a fact John has, "what has recently being happening that could cause me to have to go to my brothers club?" Sherlock drawled, John thought back to the papers over the last couple of weeks, ah right, the strippers that have been going missing only to have turned up dead a few days later. The murders had been brutal and as Sherlock liked to put it, "
"why didn't you tell him what was going to happen Sherlock", peter asks as he cowers away from the gun,
Loud thumping music had started playing up stairs and John knew the night has only just begun. Walking down the stairs John could see the lighting get darker and glow more and more feverishly red. Once at the bottom of the stairs John noticed that the walls where made of red velvet and bumped out, giving the walls the same texture as a red velvet Victorian sofa. The hallway was long and only lit by the red glow, numbers identified the doors, one ... two... four... six ... eight. Everything about this floor oozed
Peter
" John looks around confused again, John blinks, "Just because he's not as smart as you doesn't mean-"
"And so that's all I know really. My workers leave the same time they do every night and then never come back" Marcus places his head in his hands and ruins his fingers threw the thick mop of hair on his head. John looks at the man, who not only two hours ago, could have lit up any room he walked into with just his presents, who now seemed to be a dying light. Sherlock's face, which while his brother was telling the story, had slipped back into the detective's normal calculating look, had grown soft again, something John had rarely seen and that has only ever directed towards Mrs Hudson.
Once Mycroft left, Sherlock turned to look at John. His eyes seemed to be staring right into Johns soul, like in that one moment Sherlock knew everything about him, which to be fair, he probably did. John shifted in his chair a bit, not knowing how to feel about the all knowing eyes that where upon him.
John who has come around a bit, speaks up, "Well if i'm his body guard then he has someone as back up, plus I know why he's really here", John knows that if Sherlock thinks being one of the stripper/ sex workers, is what is needed to catch this guy, then he wont change is mind and if John said no could make solving the case a longer process. Marcus looks at John for a bit with a slightly confused look but sighs again and rubs his face with his hand, "fine, you can do this Sherlock but remember what I said no penetration, only oral and you need to go talk to Peter", Sherlock smiles and looks please with his brothers decision.
“I’m enjoying the view. And I don’t recall saying I’d make it easy”
“It’s not an unattractive concept.”
“I mean, if he’s willing…”
When John comes back to the bedroom he finds Sherlock right where he left him, slumped on his knees in front of the bed, breathing deeply and waiting for John to finish this. He comes up behind him, stroking his hair once more.
“You want to see him give into some of his baser desires,” John fills in for him.
John places a firm grip on the back of Sherlock’s neck and uses it to pull Sherlock forward until he tips forward out of his chair, onto his knees on the floor.
John loves it when he’s able to render Sherlock almost speechless. His words lacking their usual surgical precision, their standard finesse. It makes John feel powerful, the heady notion that Sherlock is getting off just from John’s words alone and that’s all it takes to get Sherlock in the right headspace to submit to him.
John turns to address Greg. “I’m sorry, Greg. Things seem to have gotten a little out of hand.”
And that’s how John ends up teaching Sherlock how best to throw him against the wall and pin him there - and it only takes the sodding genius two attempts before he successfully has John well and truly pinned to the point where John can’t escape not matter how he struggles. And
“Oh, you have
Sherlock goes momentarily still. “That’s… yes. An intriguing idea. Would you tell me exactly what you wanted me to do?”
. John smooths his hand down the crown of Sherlock’s head to his neck (pausing briefly at his hickey) before sliding down to Sherlock’s exposed chest to push back the fabric even further.
“It’s spectacularly pretty, John.”
John swallows back a moan, closing his eyes. “H-how long?”
John hums in acknowledgment. “And? What else?”
John fingers tighten on Sherlocks neck and his tone turns a little steely. “Do you want an answer, or not?”
Then, gradually, John relaxes into the tide of lust Sherlock washes over him. He stops wriggling for freedom and focuses on squirming to enhance his own pleasure. He cants his hips up, trying to plant his feet on the ground to give him better leverage. His efforts make Sherlock groan into his mouth before finally coming up for air with a gasp.
At first, he struggles. He relishes the feeling of Sherlock forcing him into submission even as he’s biting Sherlock’s lips in an effort to fight back. He tenses his arms and rocks his hips in time with Sherlock’s thrusts in an attempt to somehow knock Sherlock off-balance. He trembles with undisguised pleasure when Sherlock growls at his stubbornness.
“This,” he says in his deep baritone, “was the first of tonight’s battle wounds. And very helpful in my research.”
but he had no leverage and he knew it.
Sherlock’s mouth is hot, wet, and John can feel his moans vibrating across his fingers as Sherlock’s tongue sweeps over his fingertips. The noises he’s making send shivers of pleasure that course through him. The warm slick of Sherlock’s mouth makes John stroke them faster, driving towards their climax.
Sherlock moves against him, his cock rising against John’s thigh. “John,” Sherlock whispers, voice a tad shakey.
where I was. But you should know by now that I
“Come on, love. Want you to, want to feel you.”
“Are you
But John, terrified that Sherlock will feel his persistent interest, manages to push Sherlock back just enough that he can swing his good leg across Sherlock’s chest and flip their positions.
“He is. How would you like your apology? Sitting on the edge of your desk or in your chair?”
John trails his fingers to Sherlocks nape, exerting a little bit of pressure. Sherlock’s next breath isn’t quite steady.
Sherlock sinks his teeth into the flesh of John’s ass in disapproval.
John focuses on the arousal that he’s been trying to stave off. He lets himself go, his cock pulsing and spurting as he groans. He presses himself into Sherlock, twitching with endorphins while Sherlock whines around his fingers.
home invasions in the space of six weeks!”
John starts, complaining at his stalling in what John is sure is going to be the death of him.
And then he got an idea.
Sherlock tensed. John forced himself not to stay relaxed as Sherlock slowly lifted his cheek off John’s chest. “Yes. He is.” He rested his chin on John’s sternum and narrowed his eyes, trying to suss out what John was really trying to say.
Those words go straight to John's dick, have him twitching with unfettered need. Without further talk, he reaches for the lube that's been staring them down from the nightstand. He lubes up his fingers with haste and slides two fingers into Sherlock's saliva soaked hole. The abrupt burn from the stretch has Sherlock crying out, stuck between the desire to fuck onto John's fingers and pull away from the assault. His internal conflict has him shifting his hips, willing his muscles to accommodate John's fingers.
John wants to give Sherlock the same treatment, wants to tease him into a desperate frenzy but John is so aroused he can barely see straight. He leans down and licks along that ridiculous cupids bow, which parts and then Sherlock’s tongue, which had been winding John up so thoroughly only moments before, is sliding along John’s own. John seizes a fistful of Sherlock’s hair, tipping his head to the side to expose that sensual stretch of neck. A decadently wanton moan gives John pause.
One part of the plan doesn’t need much falsification - Sherlock is in an absolute terror of a mood. He’s annoyed by the case, frustrated by how long it has taken to get to the point of making a move on Greg, and has been driven to distraction by the plug John had put in his arse that morning. It’s been moving around inside him
“Oi, lay off, will you! These are good people and they’re doing their best and I won’t have you bad mouthing them just because they don’t live up to your ridiculous standards!”
“Well, I rather think that that’s the kind of thing best done elsewhere…” Greg dies a little inside, at that. “...so if you’d like to accompany us home, we can reward him for being a good boy”. Greg can barely believe his luck - he’d never dared hope for as much as this.
is exactly the wrong gauntlet to throw when John is coiled tighter than a spring. They will
“Do you think we should ask him, hmm? Ask him if he’d like to join us?”
“And what does
Sherlock’s tortured whimpers are spectacular to listen to - he's been teasing, trying to wind John up but it doesn't take much to turn the tables. John knows that when he's managed to work Sherlock into this state, he'll choose getting John off over getting off himself (although, sometimes making John come is enough to push him over the edge anyway). Sherlock's hips are rolling, thrusting into nothing as he is powerless to resist the instinctual need to rut.
Sherlock jerks his head as much as he’s able, moaning in desperate agreement.
“Sherlock,” John says.
Sherlock!
John grabs a double handful of Sherlocks arse and spreads it wide. "Now, you've been teasing me with this all night - spreading your legs for me because you feel empty without me between them, hmm?"
They’re both breathing like they’ve sprinted 300 metres uphill. John eases sideways, stretching to snag some form of clothing from the floor to clean up with. He thinks it’s his own t-shirt he ends up with - probably better than anything high-maintenance of Sherlock’s. He gently cleans both of their mess from Sherlock’s belly, while Sherlock seems dead to the world. When John settles down next to him, Sherlock curls into him. John adores him like this - relaxed in his affections, not withholding anything.
There’s an indignant huff from behind him, but Sherlock stands and starts shoving furniture around to clear space in the living room.
“Yes,” Sherlock says, a tad breathless. “I want that. All of it. More.”
he was too bloody attractive. His muscles are a sight to behold under that famously pale skin. John can’t wait to touch and taste more of it.
“Okay. That’s one possibility. But there are other methods….”
John’s mouth is intoxicating, and Greg is immediately on the back foot - John is an absolutely filthy kisser and Greg is just along for the ride. Tongue is involved from the beginning, sweeping over Greg’s mouth and
John’s cock is rock hard and suddenly he can’t think straight. Being Sherlock’s lover comes with all manner of surprises and this day is no exception. He knows what Sherlock looks like covered in his own release. The sticky glisten, that ooze that sends a primal, possessive wave through John every time he comes inside him. The thought of seeing Greg shoot off inside Sherlock, on Sherlock’s skin, knowing that he let Greg do it, makes his mouth water.
John smiles, “and why’s that?”
, John. We can’t all have a basic vocabulary”
Through it all, all Sherlock can do is keen, scream, and moan, pleading with John to fuck him harder, touch him, begging him not to stop but to let him come, wanting John to fill him. John, for his part, lets all kinds of filthy things fall from his mouth. "Take me, all of me", "Who does your body belong to?", “Is that what you need? My cock inside you? My come inside you?", "Fuck, the thought of anyone else having you, never going to happen, this arse is mine".
Sherlock’s lip quirks, but the pensive expression doesn’t quite leave his face. John presses a kiss into Sherlock’s hair and adds more seriously, “Greg’s a responsible, effective leader. But I think he’s like you - he spends his life trying to keep things under control, and he needs a chance to cede that to someone else. He follows your lead when you’re not winding him up too badly. He’s also a deeply respectful person - he’d never try to upset our working dynamic.”
John thinks with a slight whine. At Sherlock’s chuckle, it occurs to him that he might have just whined aloud. His whine turned into a groan of pain as Sherlock’s finger pushed down into the skin. He flinches, trying to squirm away from the pain but was stopped when Sherlock’s hips grind down into him, confusing his brain.
getting some direct stimulation. He moans aloud, as Sherlock’s wide hand strokes them both. John thrusts his hips, pushing his cock through Sherlock’s fist and feel a surge of pride when Sherlock’s moans match his own. He tightens his grip in Sherlock’s hair and grins in satisfaction when Sherlock’s moan gets just a little bit deeper.
when Sherlock’s voice cuts off his inner turmoil.
"Is this what you want? You haven't had enough cock for one evening?"
“He’s not a nice arse, too,” Sherlock interjects, nipping John’s neck gently.
pushing around and
“I suppose that’s a fair point,” Sherlock replies. “Tell me,
For John, it took a little longer to cotton on. About four months after he moved in to 221B, he and Lestrade were out at the pub watching football when John felt his stare. It seemed a few drinks in and Lestrade was less likely to try and hide his well-buried bisexuality. John, in love with Sherlock and also struggling with his own identity crisis, never made a move. But, he did start noticing things. Glances at Sherlock- at him, when it seemed they weren’t looking. How broad Lestrade’s shoulders were, or the strong line of his jaw. How handsome his pleased grin is. It would have been so easy to experiment, to confirm his sexuality, by giving in to their less-than-sober flirtations. But John wasn’t a total dick. He would never take the chance of hurting Lestrade just to satisfy his own curiosity.
John slowly, methodically closes the distance between them and bends down so that their faces are level. “I want you to apologize for shouting at Greg today and the countless other times you’ve shouted at him in front of his team. You want to talk about being unprofessional, hmm? You, who goes off like a prima donna whenever someone can’t read your mind?”
"Well anyway, so Mycroft was out, so Marcus decided to have party, probably the biggest one I have every been too, everyone I knew was there", He moved Sherlock back down into the position he was in before, "but I was only looking for one person that night",
“On-on your back.”
“You want to babysit her?” Sherlock asked, genuinely surprised.
In a smooth movement he jumps up and heads towards the door.
“Do you have plans for Christmas?” he asks.
Once again, he’s not sure what he’s supposed to do with this information.
in his mind. What they did was nothing more than that, two close friends enjoying some non-sexual intimacy when hidden from the world.
“You can go have dinner,” Sherlock says instead. “We’ll be fine for a couple more hours, won’t we, Rosie?”
Sat on the sofa with the bowl of chips between them, Sherlock tells her the story of how he faked his death.  He feels oddly at ease, and for the first time in one year, six months, and twenty-two days, the feeling of loneliness seems to have faded a little.
“So in fact you’re ready, now?” is all Sherlock wants to know.
“You called me here for this?!” Lestrade grumbles, still out of breath.
Molly takes her gloves off, placing it momentarily on the table next to the corpse. “I said we’re fine, you can leave. I don’t want to talk about this.”
“You can touch it too,” John prompts. “I can’t feel a thing anyway.”
He can’t finish the sentence that Sherlock’s fist hits him right on the nose. Without apologising, Sherlock walks away. No one talks about Mary Watson that way, not on his watch.
“He, you said he…” John stutters, his astonished glance going back and forth from Sherlock to the screen. “How did you- the email doesn’t say anything, and-and you can’t see the genitals from this angulation, how- did-did Mary tell you that?”
Today, however, it’s fine. Molly can come too. He hasn’t seen her in a while.
He lets her sleep over that night, in his bed, compensating for the fact that they’re proceeding probably too slowly for her on the sexual side. She lays her head on his chest after wishing him goodnight.
“Yeah, he’s my friend, he helps us out with the toughest cases,” Lestrade says, proudly patting Sherlock’s back twice. “Sherlock, this is Maureen Davis, we went to school together.”
He wants to add that Mary told him she has no intentions of learning the baby’s sex until John makes up his mind about them, but eventually he doesn’t.
“You and I are friends,” Sherlock repeats, not sure about what was unclear about that.
John sighs loudly, biting his lip to repress the instinct to strangle his whiny flatmate. He has barely touched Sherlock this time.
Telling John is a whole different story.
Tired, so very tired.
“All done,” Sherlock announces once his pants are securely on, as he sits on the edge of the bed, his back to John.
“The dip.”
Sherlock cares about John. Apparently another fact. More data is required.
As Sherlock registers the dialogue, something clicks inside his mind. Fascinating.
“I acted like an idiot, I made you say it first… for what? It’s not even true,” she continues, her voice trembling sensibly. “You had to make me say it, what’s my excuse? I humiliated myself… God, if I think about it, it’s so embarrassing…”
Sherlock and Molly play together with Rosie, sitting on the floor. Rosie seems to like Molly very much, Sherlock deduces with a tiny hint of jealousy, observing the way Molly makes her laugh way more than he can.
Her lips remain sealed, but her eyes, oh, her eyes, those are pleading him for something he can’t understand.
“I used to, when I was a child myself,” Mycroft remarked.
“Hapax,” Sherlock reads out loud, then looks up at Mary. “Short for hapax legomenon. In linguistics, it indicates a word that is only used once in a corpus of texts.”
“Why not?”
“What’s going on?” John asks the moment he enters the living room, only to find his friends lined up like a wall in front of him.
“I saw you two together… the way you would always look at each other as if you were co-conspiring something… or the way you laughed, I swear, Sherlock, you’ve never laughed that much when Mary wasn’t there,” John says, and he laughs too, just a little, at the memory. “And do you remember that time I was out with Rosie and I caught you two dancing in my kitchen? To a pop song, Sherlock, I didn’t even know you were aware pop music existed.”
“Scars. Nothing unusual, you have one too I reckon. Good night. Please switch off the light.”
“What about you needing time?” Sherlock asks tentatively, looking away once again. This time however his gaze falls on their joined hands. He follows John’s thumb across his knuckles, mesmerised by the tenderness and regularity of the touch.
It’s still night when he wakes up, his body surrounded by a nice kind of warmth that is much stronger on his side. As he opens his eyes, he understands why. He’s lying on his back, and John is pressed against his side, his arm loosely across Sherlock’s stomach, John’s leg bent over Sherlock’s, John’s head on the pillow, so close to the detective that he can feel John’s breath against his neck.
“Good night Sherlock,” John whispers.
He never thought about it, usually he focuses on memories rather than imagining what is happening next. Now that he’s prompted, however, he tries to make up possible scenarios. Jumping out of a cake, he jokes. Showing up as a patient at the clinic where John works. Or maybe just sit in his chair while John’s out and watch his face when he realises Sherlock’s not dead.
Sherlock frowns at those words. Babysitting children, even his own goddaughter, is far from being his favourite hobby, he finds it tedious in fact, but it upsets him anyway that he isn’t John’s first choice.
The hug has stopped feeling unwelcome, and is instead becoming a pleasant sensation. Sherlock remembers all of this from the first time John has hugged him. He remembers how it felt, weird and nice at the same time, getting nicer and unexpectedly less weird as the seconds went by.
“A dog for Rosie?” John repeats.
Now, almost three years later, even this dance feels awkward, especially to John. Sherlock notices the way he looks down, or at his sides, an obvious attempt to ignore the other man’s vicinity, or the way he chews on his lower lip. The way he stands as far away as he can from Sherlock given the position of his arms.
She leaves without saying a word. She’s back a few minutes later with his tea, and an address scribbled behind the receipt. A time as well, 7 pm.
Sherlock’s heart has skipped a beat.
“Because it’s good for fiction. My readers like it.”
“Thanks,” he whispers.
“I know,” he whispers, squeezing her hand. “I know you didn’t want to kill me, and that’s all it matters.”
“How are you, Sherlock?” she asks softly.
One year, six months, and twenty-two days far away from home, traveling from village to village hidden in stinky trains, in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by forests and valleys and not much else. At least he’s back in a big city now, having again a taste of that urban life he forgot he enjoyed. He arrived in Saint Petersburg yesterday, got a haircut, ate a proper meal in a fast food chain he used to despise. He’ll be back on the road tomorrow, but for now he indulges in a freezing walk across Hermitage Square, breathing in the sight of the former Winter Palace, pretending that it’s Buckingham Palace and that he can now walk to Birdcage Walk and take a cab to Baker Street, and be home, with John.
As Sherlock’s eyes meet John’s, he only wishes he could crumble. Molly Hooper was right. He’s sad, scared, the only thing he’s always prided himself on, his mind, is now up for discussion.
“Sherlock,” he whispers, tapping the detective’s shoulder. “Let me go, Rosie is up.”
He watches her sleep as he soothingly rubs her back. How unusual that his attention is held by a tiny human doing nothing but sleeping.
Mary alternates between wailing and screaming at John how much she hates him, while John remains calm and reminds her to breathe and push. Sherlock observes as the baby’s head, and then the shoulders, come out of her vagina. He’d never witnessed childbirth before, let alone from this angulation, and he finds it rather disgusting, albeit fascinating.
Danger, danger, danger.
“Sherlock is actually a girl’s name.”
Sherlock closes his eyes and listens to John’s heartbeat in the silence of the room. London is a noisy, crowded city, but when Sherlock is in bed with John, everything else stops being relevant. There’s just John, his scent, his warmth, nothing else.
Sherlock can sense she wants him to leave, but he won’t. He hurt her. He humiliated her. She’s always been a great friend, loyal and supportive, and he played with her feelings. He has to apologise, he won’t leave without letting her know the exact reasons why he acted like that.
He spits out the last word with despise, deeming it unworthy of his voice. A familiar ghost is lingering in his eyes now, one that Sherlock knows too well. Disappointment.
He feels better afterwards. He should do this more often.
“You listen to my unlikely solutions to crimes on a daily basis, I can listen to your advice for once.”
The only reaction he gets from his friend is a muffled ‘mmhf’.
John has never given up on Sherlock. Sherlock used to push him away all the time, mistreat him even, but John stayed, day after day and week after week, slowly working his way into Sherlock’s soul with his friendship, his attentions, his kindness.
Gradually he warmed up to her the way he does with all people that find him charming and funny.
you need, please call us,” John says, sitting Rosie down on her Bumbo seat carefully positioned on John’s old chair.
John nods. “Okay,” he says fondly. “Call me when you’re ready, I’ve got something for you.”
“Is there anything I can do for you?”
John does, kneeling in front of him. He removes Sherlock’s shoe and sock with care, holding his foot up with an hand under the detective’s inquisitive gaze. John is relieved to notice the swelling is minor, confirming his initial hypothesis that it’s just a sprain.
“No, thank you, I’m fine,” Sherlock replies instead, a cold chill running down his spine as the contact with John’s body is interrupted.
“Can I get you anything, Sir?” the Woman herself asks in perfect Russian. Without looking up, he hands her the piece of paper. It reads ‘I’m not dead. Let’s have dinner’.
John is definitely convenient.
Anyway, this is also the last chapter. I would like to thank you everyone for reading this story, and I hope you enjoyed it. I might write a short sequel but I haven't started yet, so for now this is the end.
“What did you say?”
you!... And now you…”
“Er… yes… and…?”
“Oh my God!” Molly screams. When Rosie takes a first, clumsy step, before falling immediately on her bum, Molly claps her hands frenetically and pulls the little girl back into her arms, kissing her head and showering her with compliments.
Greg shakes his head. “No, but...christ, his
Sherlock’s tongue had coaxed the muscle into relaxing so it wasn’t long before a second finger presses in alongside the first. John knew those nimble violinists fingers would be devastating inside him and he internally gloats that he’s right. Then they twist
Sherlock cries, voice reverent. “You’re so good, so good, can feel you gripping me!”
John doesn’t even hesitate to answer. “Oh
“Fucking hell, yes”
yes, that’s spectacular. Fucking
language would you use to describe what interests you about Greg, hmm?”
“God, you’d look spectacular, your hands behind your back, his hands in your hair, tuned to his every reaction and every word I say. He’d resist you teasing him, try to thrust, but I’ve forbidden you to let him and you’re so good for me.”
Sherlock grins in triumph and leans in to gloat. “Got you.”
John thinks saltily. He sucks in a deep breath through his nose, silently praying that Sherlock will not look southward. He straightens to his full height and strides around Sherlock to the more open space behind him.
“Look at him, he’s just about ready to come in his pants, just from sucking you off.”
Sherlock seems to enjoy that idea. An intrigued purr, a hum, comes from pursed lips as he settles himself more comfortably against John’s side. “And how, pray tell, would you get involved?”
Sherlock huffs. “
"Maybe I'd even hold your wrists behind your back, so the only thing keeping your balance is the way I fuck you - my cock pushing you further onto his."
“What do you think, hmm? Does that sound good? I reckon if we do it right, I can have you both under by the end. Have him sucking me exactly how I want, helping me get you off exactly how I please, while you hold so still for us.”
“My interests are,” Sherlock pauses, gathering his thoughts, “scientific. Carnal. Centered mostly on his cock, mouth, and hands.”
"Look at you, so wanton, so needy. Your muscles are clenching around my fingers so hard, trying to swallow me. Don't worry, you'll have me," he promises as he fucks Sherlock with his fingers, stretching him to take his cock.
John was not prepared for what he saw next. The room was impossibly big, with shelves and shelves of BDSM toys, Items and clothing placed on them, John had never seen so much, it was like we had just walked onto the set of a 90's porno.
Sherlock's voice was low and rumbled as he replied, "Work", Peters mouth made an 'o' shape,
"Morning Mycroft", John makes his way over to his chair ans sits down facing Sherlock. Who quickly acknowledges John and turns back to staring daggers into Mycroft.
John sees Sherlock give his bother a sharp look, Marcus looks apologetically back at him, "Sorry, but that's not what your here to talk about, is it", Marcus turns back to Sherlock, "I see you took my advice, I always knew you had the right body to be one of my dancers" He smirks, then points to the two chairs, "Please, sit and I will, tell you everything I know"
Mycroft glances at Mary. “Mrs Watson, could I have a word with my brother, please?”
“Hopefully. That’s the plan, yes. What about you?”
“I know. I won’t.”
Mary grins. “Well, I’m here to fix that.”
“Chips,” she replies as she disappears into the kitchen.
Instead, John simply smiles.
When the clock signs 10 pm, Molly stands up, stretching her arms. “My shift is over,” she says, immediately realising how that sounded. “Not that hanging out with you is a job, you know, but…”
What to expect: so much friendship, some bed sharing, John finding out about Sherlock's scars, Sherlock coming out for the first time, what Sherlock actually wanted to say on the tarmac.
Hours later, when an uncountable quantity of drugs is flowing in his system, he finally sees Mary, sitting on the sofa.
“I’m not poisoning you, if that’s what you’re asking,” John replies. “It’s a powerful sleep inducer. Drink it and you’ll be out in ten minutes. You can resume your experiment tomorrow.”
“Does
“You said her name,” he says..
Once she’s done speaking, she sits back as he watches her with disbelief and curiosity, breathing again, his eyes wide open, his mind trying to understand how she could possibly read him like that when he was never able to read anything of her.
Ten seconds later, a violin tune fills the air and John shakes his head, laughing fondly.
John smiles fondly. “All right then. Once Baker Street is good to go, we’re moving back.”
That night, once dinner is over and Rosie is asleep, they sit at the kitchen table in front of one another, each busy with their own computer. While Sherlock catches up on his tweets, deleting the fans’ ones in order to keep clients only, John watches Mary’s video again and again, his earphones securely in his ears. And at some point, the truth about her words to Sherlock sinks down on him. The beginning,
“You don’t need an actual partner at this stage, perhaps later.”
“Well then, I suppose the socially acceptable thing to do now is to wish you good luck, brother mine,” Mycroft says. “Enjoy your… holiday.”
The only contact with John he manages to establish is a letter, three sentences scrabbled on a white sheet, that Sherlock reads in the taxi.
Well, enjoy :)
“Good evening Mr Holmes.”
“Yes, no, I mean…” John stutters, an uncertainty that has Sherlock finally looking up. “Can I have your… er, full attention, please?”
The only thing John knows is that he would do everything to avoid losing his best friend. His own doubts will have to wait.
John ignores him. “Anyway, we need you to watch Rosie, this Saturday, please? Everyone else is busy. We wouldn’t ask you if you weren’t the only one available.”
Sherlock doesn’t know which part exactly, but something has changed in John’s eyes, a new awareness written all across his face.
Sherlock blinks in surprise. John told him his next ‘shift’ would be the following day, from 6 to 10. “John? Wasn’t Mrs Hudson supposed to spend the night?”
“It doesn’t,” Mycroft states immediately, just the lightest flush across his cheeks. “Why would it?”
He can’t wait.
It’s so good to be home.
He almost gets a gag reflex the second she licks his lips and sticks the tip of her tongue just in, forcing him to pull back. No. No. The gesture itself is too wet to be enjoyable, her tongue is viscid, the idea of her saliva in his mouth simply revolting.
Lestrade is talking as he drives, something about a colleague, Sherlock realises as he comes back into the real world, but he decides to interrupt anyway. “You and I are friends,” he states matter-of-factly.
“The feeling isn’t reciprocal, I’m afraid,” the Woman replies.
He swears he can hear her heart skip a beat.
A door in Sherlock’s mind palace bursts open. A beat, some words. Gradually, full lyrics. Of multiple songs. He remembers winter afternoons spent dancing around the house on the melody coming from Mycroft’s bedroom, when they were kids, before they grew apart. It even happened, once or twice, that Mycroft invited Sherlock in and they danced together, momentarily forgetting their rivalry and being just a ten year old boy and his big brother having some fun together.
At some point, among the photos of Sherlock’s graduation from university, an odd one pops out. It’s from Rosie’s Christening. Sherlock remembers his parents asking for a copy of that photo, but he doesn’t know how it ended up in there.
His heart beats faster in his chest as his eyes follow her around the small room, watching her as she gathers her stuff and approaches the door. He asks her to stay, over and over again, hearing his own voice going from a simple request to something resembling a plead. He can’t get up and go after her, harsh movements still hurt a lot. If she leaves, she’s gone, and it’s an idea he can’t seem to handle, for some reason.
“She’ll start crying if you don’t.”
“I’ll have a better look in case there’s more to it,” he adds, kneeling down to smell the grass next to the abandoned trousers.
“You can care while respecting my personal space at the same time.”
“One last thing… I just wanted to thank you, for the trust you put in me,” Mary says, as he looks up and finds her unexpectedly standing in front of him. “I imagine you don’t talk about this a lot, and-“
When Sherlock realises Lestrade did in fact go to the trouble to reach him as soon as possible, he feels a little guilty, just a little. But then again, Sherlock truly is facing an emergency and an insurmountable problem, writing his best man speech.
And with that, she breaks down. “Oh God,” she chokes out before covering her mouth with her hand to muffle a sob that just escaped. He watches her tears stream slowly down her reddened cheeks, and he’s never felt so helpless in his life.
He’s taking his usual bath, the morning after, when Janine opens the door with a teasing smile on her lips. Sherlock forces himself to play his ‘flirty heterosexual boyfriend’ part while she undresses in front of him, occasionally winking and licking her lips, while his mind keeps screaming that this is so very wrong, that he doesn’t want this, he’s not even remotely attracted to her.
Their hands are still joined together. Sherlock gives a light squeeze.
Sherlock is a little out of breath, his hands are firm on his hips but a beam is lighting up his face. “It used to be Mycroft’s favourite song.”
“Limited? What do you…” John starts, clearly confused but figuring it out during the sentence. “Oh.” He’s almost grinning now. So Mycroft wasn’t lying that time, Sherlock is in fact a virgin. The last virgin partner John had was in his first year at university, and he knows it’s almost animalistic, but the idea that Sherlock Holmes, gorgeous genius, is untouched by anyone makes all of John’s blood rush southwards. He imagines for a moment the world’s only consulting detective spread out beneath him, pale skin covered in sweat and goosebumps, muscles trembling and contracting under his touch, shaky whimpers and lustful moans of pleasure.
Tags are once again friendship, and fluff. Seriously, a lot of fluff. Beware of fluff because there's tons of it.
Sherlock has to bite his own lip too, but it’s not out of nervousness. It is to repress a smile. Mary was right then, there was a chance, she knew, and trusting her is probably the best decision Sherlock has ever made in his whole life.
“If our conversation has come to an end, I would suggest we get up. George’s waiting,” Sherlock says, rolling onto his back, ready to jump up.
Sherlock positions himself behind John, fixing the height of his arms and grasping his shoulders to help him straighten his back as much as possible. If Sherlock’s heard John’s gasp at the contact combined with the feeling of Sherlock’s breath against the top of his head, he chose to ignore it.
Once the man recognised who had entered the room, he shot up out of his seat. Now that he was standing John could see that he was about six foot, very Holmes like, his shirt a lot like Sherlock in the way- it look like the buttons were about to fly off, it was slightly undone a lot like how Sherlock has it and John could clearly see that he had a lot of curly dark brown chest hair. His shirt, tight dress trousers and shoes, were all complete black, his sleeves where rolled up and John could see his thick arm hair. All of his clothes looked expensive and the sliver watch that was adorned on his wrist, strongly resembled a Rolex and judging by the way the man was dressed, it probably was.
"It's just been a long time John, i'm fine" Sherlock moves away from Johns hand and knocks on the door.
I'm sorry this chapter is so short but the next chapter is a lot longer.
The main part of the club, was a large room with five stages. Two of the four smaller stages sat at one end of the room and where circled by two large booths and on the opposite side of the room, was the same lay out. Marcus had said they where reserved, for party's, stag nights and large groups that wanted to stay together and mingle, it costed extra to rent the out.
I'm revisiting my work, i have found new inspiration and i'm updating my work and adding new chapters.
had busied himself by getting the riding crop off of the top of the box and returning, his face no longer cold. He looked at John like he was preparing for the worse, but John just smiled at him, John knew it was all in the past and they had just been young men at the time and he felt sorry for the man as so many people had fell for Sherlock before him.
That made more sense and brought him to thinking what environment Sherlock would be entering. "Good question John" Sherlock announced making john turn to him in surprise, "but i didn't say anything"
The back wall was made of a rustic looking wood, while the other sides, where pitch black but the chandelier that hung form the ceiling gave the room a warm glow. In the centre of the room was a large fur rug and on top of it sat a large dark oak wood desk, with two deep red leather arm chairs in front of it and behind the desk was an even bigger winged chair also a deep red and made of leather.
" Sherlock spits the words like venom at Mycroft. Family? John wonders, when has Sherlock ever taken interest in family- apart from the one time he addressed john as it.
", the last sentence was barked like an army captain talking to his troupes, something John was used to hearing, but surprised when Peter executed it perfectly.
Sherlock and John prepare to go to the club and Johns not quite prepared for what happens next but is determined to help the brother out.
He looks back up at Sherlock, he's starting to think that were they are going isn't a normal club, not like the clubs john had been to before, not that we had ever been to a gay club before. Sherlock sensing what John was thinking, spoke up, "No John it's not a normal club, its a
"He's in room ten, go there now, he is waiting" Marcus pulls out a small key from his pocket, it has a tag that reads, "
John is woken up by the two Holmes brothers arguing again, but what is it this time?
John thought for a moment, before turning to Mycroft, "What if i'm with Sherlock, then I can make sure he doesn't do any drugs" Both Mycroft and Sherlock look at John a little shocked, "I wouldn't think I would be your type of scene Dr. Watson" Mycroft looks at him with a cocked eyebrow,
John entered the living room after being woken up by the sound of a screeching violin and angry words distinctively being spoken, well shouted, by the two brothers. "Sherlock do behave" Mycroft's aloft voice grates on john. John now looking over at Sherlock and seeing that he is clearly bothered by what Mycroft was saying to him, He shifts and looks over at Mycroft with a raised brow.
Sherlock turns around and walks backwards into the room, quickly spinning round to map everything out. Sherlock stops and faced backwards to where John and Marcus are standing, giving John a full view how tight those trousers really where, John quickly looks else where. Sherlock turns to Marcus, "you said most of the people disappearing worked as both strippers and sex workers", Sherlock brings his hands to a steep under his chin.
John takes a deep breath and sighs, "Yes right, but who is going to see my underwear?", Sherlock looks like hes getting more exasperated by the second,
' John thought,
"because John, gay men tend to wear their underwear so that is viable above the waistline and we will too", John stops to think for a second. Sherlock obviously knows what hes talking about, its crazy how much he seems to know though. Is Sherlock gay? John looks at him for a couple more seconds, no he's not, he doesn't like anyone. does he? John pushes his thoughts aside and looks back into the bag.
"Yeah, sorry Sher, forgot you like your correct grammar", Sherlock looks at him giving him a little frown at the pet name before speaking again,
Hey guys, sorry about the lack of contents. I have been busy and unable to write, I will try and do more writing soon but no promises that it will be soon. Thank you for understanding guys - CMP <3
Sherlock stood and walked around the desk, Marcus looked up sensing that Sherlock was next to him, "their only young men, Sherlock, their too young to know what death feels like" his voice is only a whisper when he stares into Sherlock's eyes, his voice breaks, "they are just like me, back then", Sherlock then raps his arms around his brother pulling his brothers head to rest against his stomach, he rubs his hands over his brothers back soothing him, "I know and that's why I am going to solve this case for you, because if it was you who had been killed, I would not have stopped till I found who did it" Sherlock's voice was low and soft as he spoke.
“Right. Behave, then. As I said, he’s a good guy, and I admire him for that. He’s clever - don’t pull that face, compared to regular people he is - and he always conducts himself with this quiet, driven purpose. He’s also very good looking, and he’s got a wicked sense of humor under all that professionalism.”
Sherlock’s soft cock slips out of him and the sensation of his cooling come dribbling out of John’s just-slightly-more-than-pleasantly-sore hole pulls an exhausted whimper from John.
“Oh fuck, fuck me! Make me believe it,” John begs.
Sherlock leans even closer, so that his breath ghosts across Johns lips
“You presume correctly”
John says this from mere inches from Sherlock, so his breath ghosts over Sherlocks centre. Sherlock was already practically quivering, but he fully trembles when John sinks his teeth into the fleshy globe of his arse.
too well-fucked for that kind of behaviour.
Sherlock snorts into Johns neck and then they are both giggling. Sherlock moves off John but in the process can’t resist looking at the evidence of their fucking.
Using Sherlock’s own motion against him, John sends him towards the wall whilst John’s leg moves to kick Sherlock’s feet further apart to throw off his balance. There’s some more struggling, but it ends up with John having Sherlock pinned against the wall.
“I want to see him lose control. He’s a hot blooded man, prone to outbursts. I should know, I’ve been on the receiving end on more than a few of his angry tirades. But he quickly reins himself in before he does anything he’d regret. Cathartic as it might be.”
“I need to come,
It’s way too much and not nearly enough all at once. Sherlock’s tongue is teasing, sweeping over and around, pressing softly against the centre of the pucker for barely a moment before moving on. Tension coils in Johns stomach. Sherlock is relishing teasing him, refusing to give John enough to satisfy.
He is just along for the ride.
, John has been loving being held down, has relished the feeling of being unable to wriggle away from Sherlock’s whims, but
“In detail.”
“Go on, suck them like you’d suck him.”
But no matter how needy he is, he won't break John's rules about no stimulation for himself - that'd only make John more determined to drag it out longer, stubborn bastard that he is. He's too desperate for that now. He has one fist around the guys cock, covered in his saliva where his lips meet his fingers every time he bobs his head. His other hand has a thumb on the guys perineum, with two fingers buried inside him, moving rapidly over his prostate. He encourages shallow thrusting movements until the guy has his hands in Sherlocks hair, using his grip to anchor Sherlock’s mouth as he fucks his throat. Sherlock actively encourages the guy to choke him, loving that John can hear him moaning and struggling to breathe around the cock in his mouth.
he thinks, hoping he isn’t coming off as scared or over eager.
The thought of being manhandled by Sherlock makes John embarrassingly hard. He’s desperate to feel those new, hardened muscles pressing into him and trapping him against the wall, floor, bed, he’s not picky. He finds himself trying to come up with a scenario where he can “innocently” entice Sherlock into sparring with him.
“I think it’d be even more attractive if you could do that whilst preserving a little bit of that pride of yours - if you had no choice but to appease him, because you’d been told too”
"John, fuck, please!"
, John had been doing so well, he was only moderately hard but not he was like
A big hand wraps around his hip. Sherlock sighs, obviously finding the whole thing extremely pleasing. John doesn’t notice him moving until he feels those lips, and the teeth behind them, press into his back. Excruciatingly slowly, they travel down, until Sherlock’s teeth are worrying the skin over the flare of John’s hip. There is nothing for John to press his hips into to combat the sensation this time, so John has to let it wash over him. When Sherlock’s breath fans over the very top of the crack of his ass, the breath freezes in John’s chest.
At least, not until a case presents them with the opportunity to try out self-defence moves. John’s more excited than he cares to admit at the potential of finally -
John is thinking about other bruises now, shadows around his wrists, across his hips… The image pulls a wiper from his throat. He moves his arms - he’s not really fighting anymore, he’s relishing how Sherlock’s weight presses into him through his palm, how John can tug and not be able to move.
“Are you ready for your turn?" Sherlock can't say yes fast enough and it makes John chuckle. He leans down to whisper in Sherlock’s ear "You don't come until I say so. You need to be reminded of your place."
Sherlock nods, agreeing. “When you’ve let your face go a bit scruffy it does leave a unique sensation behind after kissing me.”
Sherlock sounds
John grins. "Gonna wear me a little while longer, then?"
Sherlock does some kind of full-body roll that feels
Nonsense encouragements fall from Johns mouth. Later, he couldn’t have told you what he said if his life depended upon it. He feels like crying when Sherlock pulls his mouth away. One of his hands leave John’s skin and then there is the tell-tale scrape of the drawer in his bedside table. Because of course he didn’t need to ask where the lube was.
His balls ache, pulled up tight to his body. His whole nervous system is screaming to let go and
John crawls up and drapes an arm around Sherlocks waist, nosing into the hair at the nape of his neck. Sherlock's voice is a delicious, sated rumble.
Sherlock bats John’s hand out the way and wraps his large hand around both of them
. His mouth returns, his tongue spiralling in. Then a slick finger is pressing alongside, and that delicious wet muscle is replaced by firm pressure, circling and then pressing
“Oh.”
me, just like that”
“Honestly, Lestrade, it’s one thing to have incompetent team members but to not notice such blatant stupidity practically makes you as bad as them!”
John looks up to Sherlock – of course he’d know what John was thinking. And John would trust Sherlock with his life – has done, in the past. It’s enough for his lust-addled brain, and he reaches between his legs to position Sherlock’s cock into his loosened hole.
So strung out, unable to muster anything more eloquent, he huffs out a raspy, “fffuuucking hell,
be revisiting this dynamic, but John’s blood is up and Sherlock needs to be taken down a peg. Besides, if John doesn’t get some real stimulation
“Well, it seemed like the two of you were butting heads, trying to figure out how to move forward. I think I’d be able to handle that for you both. Guide you a little. I think I’d be more than capable of handling both of you, even worked into a froth like that.”
He throws himself forward, pulling one leg under himself so that he lands on his side. Sherlock reaches out to grab him, but John has his hands in front of him now and manages to get one wrist free of his shirt. Sherlock is growling, trying to seize control of his arms, but he is unbalanced and John manages to knock his elbows outwards, seizing Sherlock’s hips with his thighs and roll them so John was the one with Sherlock pinned beneath him now.
“Yes, yes I know. How about I start with the the last one. Hmmm?” John pauses, trying to find a way to articulate his complex feelings for the Detective Inspector. “He’s a great man - he’s got a good heart, and he always does what is right.”
“I- I’m close,
Sherlock complies.
“Can I? You know how I do hate to repeat myself.”
The noises Sherlock is making have started rising in pitch, his jaw falling open as he gasps for air. John rocks up onto his knees to free the arm he’d been using for balance. While his left hand works over their cocks, he presses three fingers from his right against Sherlocks mouth.
“Jesus….”
“I think you’ll find my language is
“I think you should apologize to Lestrade.”
Sherlock may have miscalculated, because that image described in John's aroused, gravelly voice may just do him in then and there.
“I bet you do.”
John pulls away long enough to deliver a playful spank and bite the skin where his thigh meets his arse cheek.
Sherlock is near tears from pleasure when John finally decides to stop toying with them both and finally asks, "Are you ready, Sherlock? Ready to take my load? Ready to come?"
“Now, I have had
Sherlock’s answering moan makes them all groan, so visceral and provocative. His head bobs faster, the sucking sounds becoming more obscene and it’s all so much.
His hips rise up halfway off Sherlock only to slide back down to press their pelvises together in a maddening grind. Sherlock’s hands tighten around his hips, not guiding or rushing but enjoying, and John silently hopes that there will be new bruises to add to his collection.
“When you two were going at each other the other day, it was quite the picture.”
“Sherlock is going to apologize, aren’t you, Sherlock.”
Then, at the first touch of Sherlock’s tongue all other thoughts leave him in a cry of ecstasy.
“Such as?”
And so he does.
“Hmm. Perhaps if I wear you out more thoroughly next time you’ll be more forgiving”
"Did you like that? Making a slut of yourself sucking someone else's cock? You didn't even want him, did you? You'd do anything, anything at all, to prove how much I own you. You are mine." John’s hand twists in Sherlocks hair, just a little. "Did you like him grabbing on you, thinking that he can really have you? He'll never have you like I do"
Sherlock’s eyelids
Oh, and that means John’s done well. It usually takes more than this to get Sherlock this desperate. It's a good thing too, because John needs to fuck him hard enough to bruise. He wants to see the shadows of his fingers and teeth on Sherlock for days afterwards.
Sherlock is right, he is going to ruin him. He will never be the same again. But John doesn’t care one whit about that so long as it ends with an orgasm and Sherlock keeping him. He will never want to be without this.
“Well, I think it’s fair to say you were right. I aim ruined.”
It’s nearly enough to cut off Johns train of thought except
John’s eyes close automatically, enjoying the shiver of lust that crept down his back. “I want that too. But not here.” When Sherlock opens his mouth to protest, John silences it with a finger to his lips. “We are going to do this the right way or not at all. Which means with proper lube, which I know I have in my room.”
Sherlock was a flighty creature at the best of times, so John tried to broach the subject carefully. It would likely not even be a full three minutes before Sherlock saw right through him.
"Mmmm, dinner. Shower... Maybe later."
“I swear to god, Sherlock, if you don’t stop
“I asked,” he repeats, bringing his face level to John’s, “would you like a few more?”
“It’s good, isn’t it? He’s such a good little cocksucker.” He pets Sherlock’s head again and Sherlock visibly shivers. “Aren’t you Sherlock?”
“Tell me,” Sherlock said, not stopping for one second. “Let me hear you.”
Sherlock licks his lips, closing his eyes as he leans into the pressure at his neck. “Is that so? Do you think Greg would let you guide him? How do you know he wouldn’t take charge of the situation?” Sherlock looks up at John as if to silently add,
"You looked spectacular sucking him off, but I'm going to make you forget he even exists."
“That,” Sherlock swallows thickly, “that would be very good. I’d like that.”
“Oh god,” John pants, softly, body coiled tight with anticipation. Sherlock makes him wait for it, trailing light kisses across the base of his spine, ghosting his warm breath along his crack. John is growing desperate for something more. Some productive stimulation before Sherlock drives him mad. He wants to move, to wriggle his hips to entice Sherlock to
He doesn't waste any time inserting his fingers back into Sherlocks arse, moving his other hand through the come on Sherlock’s back before wrapping it around his cock. "Can you feel that? It's all over you. In you. I'm everywhere. It's practically dripping out of you"
And with that, Sherlock’s mouth latches onto John’s neck.
When Sherlock parts him John shivers, the cool air making him feel more exposed than he was.
“Add a couple bruises of my own,” John replies with a smile. In one swift move, John pulls Sherlock’s head back to elongate his already long, exposed neck and then he is feasting on the skin on display. Right at the juncture of his neck and shoulder, John worries the skin between his teeth, sucking long and hard. He feels Sherlock move beneath him, rutting upwards to stimulate them both while Sherlock’s freehand clutches at his backside, desperate for release.
“Impatient,” Sherlock huffs, glaring up at John as he is manhandled to John’s liking.
Sherlock’s hand tightens in their clasp, John’s words getting to him. “And now you’re going to do,” he swallows thickly, nervously, “what exactly?”
