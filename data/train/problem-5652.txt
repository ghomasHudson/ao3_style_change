“Mr. Stark I am eager to talk to you.” A white man with a suit came into view. His visitor sticker read
You can’t even give crap away for free in this world. Everything has to be questioned. Shoving his wallet and glasses back inside his coat, a bicyclist fell over in a heap of chains and metal as a woman suddenly screams. Adrenaline pumped through Tony’s veins as he ran over to the man who had fallen, making sure he was alright. Pulling him off to the side, the woman who had screamed was bleeding from her temple as a dark figure pressed her face against a wall.
Goodbyes were exchanged until the two were left alone. An odd urge to thank Steve came over him and the words left before he could truly think.
“Have you seen this man before right now?” Phil pulled out a tablet, typing something quickly into it.
“A band of titanium.” Tony groaned out on the floor, stretching out and touching his toes. Tony got up and stood firmly in front of Steve. The blonde brought his hand down and went to grab for the other man’s wrist wrapped in titanium but Tony pulled away too quickly. In retaliation, the brunette sent a, with what he thought was a firm shove, at Steve’s shoulder but he didn’t budge. Caught a bit off guard at his failed efforts, Steve took the chance and caught his wrist. Squeezing it, it crushed against its creator's wrist harshly.
“Uhm, I mean I go by Captain America.” Tony’s head jolted and he closed his eyes, seeing the colors and outline of a patriotic suit. He opened his eyes to a confused Steve.
He woke up to the sound of a wild wheezing noise. He opened his eyes hastily and sat up, sweat dripping down his neck. The arc was brighter, as though it were stronger somehow and cooled off quickly with its fans. Looking at the reactor he began to inspect it, distinguishing the fan, the structure, and lastly the odd power source in the center. Running through the possibilities of what it may be since it seemed as though it were some type of element, he came out with nothing.
“Now I can stop worrying about dropping dead when I feel or do crap. For some reason, my arc can only handle so much exertion. Accelerate too much and I could have been good as dead.” Steve’s eyes held so much regret, it was unnerving.
“You’re awake! Perfect. How are you feeling?” Phil walked through the door, turning on the lights abruptly.
“What the hell was that for? Aiming way too close to my ‘non-heart’, what the fuck? Kill me once shame on you. Kill me twice... Still, shame on you.” The dark haired man walked further into the room, making distance between the two of them.
They jumped out the car and more gunshots and screams were heard. Visible rot was eating at the very walls. Before entering Steve grabbed one of Tony’s shoulders, gaining his attention.
“What would you do if mid kiss I just closed my suit, pinching your stupid lips?” Tony intertwined his fingers with Steve’s.
He closed his eyes but didn’t see anything. Just as he was about to open his eyes he felt a warmth caress his neck, then a brush against his lips. As soon as it came, it left.
“What the heck is on your wrist?” Steve said, confused as shook out his limbs in his casual athletic wear.
“It’ll allow you to make it up to me.” Steve visibly flinched. “I don’t mind you being my ‘protector’ or whatever the hell that means. I’m okay now and just happy to be here.” Tony was even surprised with himself. He was just genuinely happy to not be alone.
“It was successful.” A hushed voice whispered. His eyes fluttered open, a bit foggy as they adjusted to the light.
Steve left Tony to his overactive mind. How many nicknames have they gone through in a matter of minutes? He couldn’t be bothered to count.
“I think it’s a fantastic idea.” The blonde looked up, shocked. The brunette walked over to his bed and sat comfortably, bouncing a bit to test it out, nodding after approving its stiffness.
“It’s an evolved human bred version of a Myxozoa.” Tony looked back at the super soldier who spoke. The man maneuvered the shorter of the two behind him, pushing against the persistent lady.
“Why do you need to be so precise for?” Tony questioned. Steve returned to his front, obviously a bit agitated about the interrogation he was receiving.
“I have no clue,” Steve laughed, regretting it after feeling a sharp pain. Snatching back the water he took a sip.
“It’s your next test. Only you can make something you’re a hundred percent happy with.” Tony’s mind went to the creature he encountered. What materials would protect him from whatever that thing was?
“The one with the less experience with their gifts usually gets protected. Since you’re brand new it would make sense for you to be paired with the oldest, most experienced, one.” Tony’s brows lifted. Oldest? He looked the same age as him, maybe younger. But who knows how old he is. That serum must have changed, or kept the same, a lot about him.
A few hours go by and Tony clicks the final adjustment back in place. With a huff, he takes off his glasses and unhooks himself. heading over to the couch for a well-deserved rest. With a surprised yelp, he sees the super soldier lying across the cushions with an arm slung over his eyes. At Tony’s sound, Steve churned awake, sitting up.
“Not that the room is bad, that’s not what I’m saying at all. I just..” His eyes trailed away, unintentionally raking over the other man’s physique. Even in, what he deduced to be his pajamas, he saw his rippling build.
“Officer down. 275 7th Avenue Amalgamated Bank. Shots have been fired. There are hostages. There’s something wrong, the walls are being…” multiple screams were heard until the call was cut. Tony looked over at Steve who had an unsettled face. He may be used to this but still, hearing screams and signs of distress were gut-wrenching. Things like this Tony could handle, he has to be able to. Steve gripped harder at the steering wheel and pressed the gas, weaving through traffic. At a particular oncoming tight space, Steve hit a button and lights began shining, emitting a police siren. Cars moved almost immediately and they arrived at the bank before actual back up from the police.
Steve’s eyes burned with aggravation as he stared down the man who kept a grip on his wrists. Tony was pressed hard against the door to avoid touching Steve. The shorter of the two let go and began trying to excuse himself from between Steve and the wall. Quickly but gently the blonde laid his arms next to each side of the other man’s body on the door, caging him in. Tony was obviously able to understand what he was doing but he was completely shocked nevertheless. He felt the fan turn on in his chest as he leaned further into the wall.
Using his repulsor beams he sliced the creature leg off. The thing screamed and turned, bolting towards Tony. Increasing his beam’s intensity he burned the creature until it became silent and reeked of death. Once it was dead Tony ran to Steve, cutting away the roots. The blonde fell forward, chest bleeds profusely. Taking off his mask he placed it over Steve’s head and held him tight against his body. Using his thrusters he flew them out of the ground, making sure the blonde didn’t hit his head. Carrying Steve to the car he pressed the button that he was told to press if there was an emergency. Nothing seemed to happen for a bit but three minutes passed by and black cars were surrounding the premise in seconds. Medics came out rushing and sadating Steve. One claimed that although it’s useless because of his tolerance, it’s procedure and could only do good. Gently removing the headpiece from Steve, Tony sat on the ground next to where the doctors worked and watched. When Steve’s eyes opened the first thing he saw was Tony. His brows scrunched up briefly in pain and he looked down at his chest, stitches closing up his remaining wounds.
His head jolted and he snapped his eyes shut. The images were so vivid, everything felt so real. Tony chanted in his head for this to not happen right now when this man was below him like that. The blonde’s pliable mouth wrapped around him, Steve swallowing. Heat fluttered in his abdomen, begging for attention. He opened his eyes to see the other man sitting back on his heels, head hung a bit low as he fiddled with the tape.
“So this is what I have to look pretty for? You wrapping me up in string and taking my measurements?” Deciding to ignore him Steve stepped up to him, wrapping his arms behind the other man’s back and bringing it forward. The wetness from Tony’s skin making his dress shirt clings where Steve pressed. Securing it to the smallest dip of his waist Steve took note of just how slim it was. Tony’s hands were lifted up absurdly as he stood with the demeanor of inconvenience. Steve raked his nail across the measuring tape before reaching over to Tony’s left arm, wrapping it around his bicep.
“Now you’re ripping my possessions? Nice..” Tony tried sassing, trying to ignore the feeling of being so exposed. Hands laid against his skin, feeling and pulling apart his flesh. Tony hid his face but pushed into the hands. Reaching under his pillow, Tony brought out lube. With a shaky hand, he looked back to give it to Steve. The blonde’s eyes were blown black, blue almost completely gone. A sexy white grin appeared and he took the bottle, squeezing Tony’s wrist tenderly before he took it. Tony didn’t want to look away, he laid his head sideways on the pillow and stayed watching the taller man. Steve saw this and warmed the liquid between his fingers, dragging them wetly against his hole when it warmed. The blonde returned his glare as he pressed inside. Tony’s fluttered slightly but he kept them open, lips parting. He went deeper and his eyes hooded more. A crook of his fingers and Tony grunted, hands curling into his bedding just below his ribs. Thrusting his fingers into the brunette’s tight heat, Tony tipped his hips higher, trying to get them deeper. When he got what he wanted and another finger went inside him Tony couldn’t keep looking, pushing his face into his pillow again. He was spread so good and once they left him he let out a sigh of relief. It’s been way too long and thank god he fixed his damn heart because he would be dead by now.
The ceiling had begun to show signs of rot and the lights began blinking off. Crouching behind the front desk Tony found one of the officers who had been shot. They were breathing. He slung him over his shoulder and ran with him outside. About to run back into the building Steve walked out with two bodies on his shoulders.
“Let me take care of you in return.” He brought his body closer, a hair away from laying flush against Tony’s.
“Usually they are assigned through different means but for your case, since it involves your mind, your protector was chosen out of a stream of conscious. Providing us with information of who you are most compatible with.”
“What? My wrist measurements tell you I have a few days to live?” Tony joked, smile widening as he crossed his arms.
“I had him unconscious, stitching him up and made sure you were clear to get everyone out.” Tony visibly became less tense. Steve’s expression softened and he started up the car.
A swelling feeling washed over Tony’s head, sending waves of pain into his skull. Images of a man, similar to the outline he saw shooting the creature, became clear. Soft murmurs of a deep voice rang in his head and he felt his face go slack, watching the images flash behind his eyelids. Moments he had never experienced with this man played. He listened to soft laughter, making his lips twitch the slightest bit. Swelling in his chest causes some sort of sound to come from the reactor.
The room remained black as night, keeping Tony in deep sleep for longer than he intended. His command meant that the light control did not adjust even when morning came.
“And these things we go against aren’t human,” Steve spoke, an air of fear ringing in his tone. He walked over to the weighted poles and began swinging it.
A hysterical woman screamed in a paramedic’s face who kept trying the keep her seated. She saw Tony and ran over to him. She wasn’t one of the women who had children and Tony stood a bit defensively because of her erratic demeanor, ready to defend himself.
“A person.” He didn’t understand why he was telling this random man anything but he knew more than what he did right now.
Freezing in place at such a sudden death, his eyes prickled and began to burn with painful tears. He began trembling in terror where he stood. He couldn’t move, inches from the inside of the creature's unhinged jaw. Unblinkingly he watched the mouth stretch around him in order to swallow him whole as it screamed louder, spit flying across his face and body. Scrunching his eyes, Tony prepared for his death and the onslaught of pain.
Abruptly Tony ducked, sliding out between the blonde and the door and walked over to his desk. He fiddled with his suit and looked at the measurements again, mind going back to Steve measuring him. The measurements were helpful after all, helping him get the suit just perfect. As he began zoning off into his work he saw the suit get flung off the table and land on the couch. The distance was further than what a normal person can throw. Tony’s breath fluttered at the action.
“Don’t worry, if I have a nightmare I’ll be sure sue you for not ‘protecting’ my dreams.” He shoveled the last bit of mash into his mouth and got up to clean, Steve jumping up to help.
“remove your nails from her head...” the thing watched Tony’s every move. Moving his hand gently underneath the woman’s chin Tony made eye contact with her and nodded with wide eyes, promising with his face that everything would be okay. Gently he moved his other hand to the thing’s wrist. He remained emotionless at the sticky texture of the creature, focusing on keeping his eyes on the woman. Before he could move the hand, the thing roared in his face, clamping its nails down into the woman’s skull. Killing her instantly.
“I know you are,” Steve crossed his arms. “You’re doing really well honestly. But today you have to try even harder because tonight, we’re going out.” The words startled Tony but instead of making Steve elaborate, to the blonde’s surprise, he remained silent. With a quick move, Tony got to Steve’s front and landed a punch right in the gut. A small surprised pant came from Steve but besides that, he wasn’t affected. Catching the back of Tony’s knee with his foot he pulled forward, making the brunette fold and fall back.
Steve chuckled, taking Tony's left hand and kissing the knuckle of his ring finger. “Soon, baby. Promise.”
He can't see it, but he can feel Tony's narrowed eyes seering into his back, focusing in on every bit of him and burning him up.
His father never had the time to even speak a simple “hello” to him, it felt. Sometimes Tony wondered if Howard even had the time to witness him being birthed into the world. And as for his mother? She was affectionate and paid a lot more attention to Tony than anyone ever did in private school (she noticed him more than his teachers did, and he saw his mom as much as he saw his dad), but their interactions were still minimal. There was never really any family heart-to-heart between them, mostly he just confided in Maria as a very distant friend, only telling her the unimportant parts about his life like the things that annoyed him.
Captain America realized he had feelings for Tony. Even the brunette himself had suspicions--not that anyone caught him complaining.
“You know, old man,” Tony said quietly, placing his hand on Steve's forearm, “you aren't just my repairman. You know that, right?”
The babe gave a little bark, then opened his eyes and looked up at the couple. His tail wagged and his mouth opened, and Tony was about to faint from happiness as he reached a hand out and pet the babe's head.
it is currently 4am at the time of finishing this fucking chapter and i've been awake since 12. i think my head might actually fall off my neck i need to pass out like right now
Tony pushed himself off the couch, his legs, torso, and arms twirling like jelly as he clumsily made his way to the file cabinet once more. Being an oblivious drunk, Tony seriously considered moving the cabinets to the couch just for convenience.
Tony looked to the clearing when he heard some shuffling, and there he saw Steve with a big poster that said, “PROM?” and a picnic basket hanging from his right arm.
Steve looked at him, then around the room, then back to him as he asked, “Soooo . . . are you going to ask anythi--”
“Steve, I-I'm serious!” Tony yelled, hoping that if he talked louder Steve would believe his lies. But there was no such luck.
In the middle of his slow stitching, Tony rested his head on Steve's shoulder, giving it a tired smooch. He probably screamed about the broken zipper for a long time before coming over, so his eyes were droopy and his throat hurt.
Steve, still unresponsive and blunt-looking, just gestured for Tony to come over to him (with his arms still outstretched). The brunette cleared his throat and walked over to him, an eyebrow raised. “Are you okay, Steve? What--what is this that you’rrrre . . . doing?”
corrupted by his own power, never seen a man with such power like Tony Stark keep himself up so gracefully.
Today was one of the very few days off for the Avengers, and each one was doing their own thing. Clint and Natasha were being affectionate bullies to each other while they trained, Bruce was with Tony down in the lab, and Thor was destroying the kitchen trying to find something to devour. And Steve? Steve was in the middle of it all, doing nothing but reading random files he found around the tower.
“Hey, I’m Tony Stark. And you?” He greeted rather bluntly, and if Steve was taken aback by it, he didn't let it show. He just took the man's hand and shook it politely. “I'm Steve Rogers.” He replied.
“Needed to piss, he said.” Tony replied, tapping on a holographic screen and zooming in on a box-shaped object. Steve ignored Tony's little zoom-in-zoom-out gig, instead walking over to the corner where tall drawers were pushed against each other. “Can I read the files in here?” He called out again.
When Steve caught up with him, Tony was already looking for which one to choose, nearly shedding tears with every little face he saw.
but anyway there was a lot of hawkeye hate in here (or at least hawkeye shade being passed around) but i swear on my life that i love hawkeye more than i love myself. he's like my second favorite character in /general/--very close to tony (who is a.k.a. my BIGGEST stan ever in the world like god i love this man)
Steve didn't respond. He just stood up as casually as he sat down and opened his arms wide. Mind you, he was still in his sleeping clothes--an off white tee with black sweatpants--and his face held utter indifference.
Tony smiled the tiniest bit and got up to sit next to Steve on his bed. "Thank you for telling me. Now, what's happening in those memories?"
After a few more steps down the trail, Tony came across the final note near the clearing where he and Steve used to admire their city. “I know what I've been writing must've cringed you out by now since you aren't one for love letters, but I hope today you can make an exception. (Your fault for dating a hopeless romantic.) But anyway--Tony, you're a great person, and I'm glad we're dating. I've never been so proud to announce my love for anyone I've dated in the past. I guess I just have a thing for edgy bad-boy geniuses. You're such an inspiration, what with your stubbornness and determination, and I want to ask you this one thing before any of your other admirers can . . . “
Tony looked at him for a brief second before shrugging and turning back to his work. He had forgotten the stuff in there, and wasn't all that concerned about what Cap would find. The majority of the folders in there were most probably Howard's projects. The projects he was too focused on to even say “Good job,” to his overachieving, trying-to-make-my-dissatisfied-dad-proud kid.
Tony's face flushed a tinge, but he then looked back up to the barista and asked, “How did you know I'm the person who's supposed to receive this?”
“I . . . don't know. Maybe because I was a successful test subject.” Steve shrugged, which only made Tony more confused. How could he
"Thank you. For listening to me, I mean." Steve finished, a little flushed at the realization that he could talk so much in one sitting.
Steve awkwardly chuckled, then cleared his throat and tried again. "Tony . . . you don't . . . envy me, do you? For being close to your father?"
Steve was the first to pull back, sliding off the desk and stumbling clumsily a few feet away from Tony. He was wiping his mouth as an attempt to hide the harsh blush now present on his skin, but to be completely honest, Cap wouldn't have minded keeping the mark of Tony's lips on him forever--
“Don't these people care about their hearing?” Steve asked over the music, nearly hacking up a lung whilst doing so.
Steve, again, wasn't the type of man to be needy for his boyfriend's attention. Never felt anything even remotely close to that clinginess
“I don't hear you complaining.” Tony commented, smugness glinting in his eyes. He leaned in closer, as if challenging the man to do it. “You can kiss me,” Tony offered, “or you can give me your name.” A tension-rising pause. “Or you can give me both. I can't wait to talk to you endlessly from within my cell, officer. You'd be welcome anytime--”
He scanned his surroundings. Nowhere else to go but the way he came in, and he wasn't going to take that chance. He hoped that guy would run right passed him and never be seen again, but, low and behold, this wasn't a cartoon show and that cop caught him trying to sink into the shadows almost immediately.
Tony thought for a moment. “Very well. Let's talk.” He sounded as if they were going to move to a more private area such as an office, but the brunette just stayed where he was, now just slumping against the conference table to feel more comfortable.
As the blond opened the back of his car door and put Tony inside, the damned criminal couldn't help but ask again, “Really, can you just kiss me? You're incredibly attractive and my lips are incredibly soft. What's the harm?”
Tony was surprised and satisfied, licking his lips to savor the taste of Steve's lips a little longer. “Well, Steve,” he hummed, “You're awfully bad at tying people up. Was it because of eagerness, I wonder?” Tony mused, jumping from his seat and using his newly untied hands to grab Steve's face to kiss him more. Steve made a sharp stop, pushing Tony away before quickly parking in an alley.
He made his way to the movie theater, seeing a man by one of the many double doors. Tony slowly approached him, about to say something but instead being handed another orange sticky note without even making eye contact.
, his mind seethed. The brunette knew this was probably going to be his last moments, but giving false hope to his friend was all he could think of doing.
“Yeah. Remember when you barged in during fourth mod and started screaming? And then you were forced out by me? When I sat down again I heard him whisper about you being an ass.”
He was tired to wake up without the man beside him, he was tired of not falling asleep to a dimly glowing arc reactor, he was tired of the tiredness he felt when Tony Stark didn't kiss his nose as a wake up call.
Steve popped his mouth and lazily walked back over to the door, placing his hand on the knob. With a little groan, he said, "I'll go get the sewing kit from mom's room."
As both men's lips closed and their conversation was silenced, Tony's heart rate increased. He was going to do it. He was going to ask Steve on a date.
“Iron Man!” A voice Tony could barely familiarize shouted. He couldn't tell if it was a villain preparing to end him or if it was a good guy preparing to help him, but when he saw the outline of that physique, strands of blond hair and streaks of red, white and blue, the hurting genius almost bolted up. Almost.
On the night he asked Steve on a date, they were alone walking down the Manhattan sidewalks, peeking through windows of vintage shops and occasionally stopping at a food place for a quick munch. Tony hadn't invited anyone else other than Steve this time. If he was going to ask, he didn't need the surprised gasping of one of the guys in his ear. Doing what he was going to do would be unnerving enough, and to have reactions from an audience that didn't need to hear it weren't going to simmer his tension.
Steve had heard his bedroom door click just as the memories were becoming too much to bear. Actually, when the door opened, Steve couldn't imagine anything more horrifying than what he was experiencing. He felt the vibrations of countless explosions shake his weight; he could see the bullets zooming passed to hit their targets; he could feel the raging confidence as soldiers took their ride-or-die and hollered for a cause they believed in.
The second the two met up again Clint was dragging Steve out of the Avengers tower, mumbling compliments to himself about how he just convinced Steve Rogers, the most stubborn man alive, to have a night out with him.
“Cap! H-Hey! I’m--” he felt another shock of pain, making him scream inside his own mouth--"okay . . . “
And Steve told him. He told him everything, not leaving even the littlest detail out as the brunette fed him chocolate so he could have a bit of comfort food. Through it all, Tony never said a thing. He just listened, and fed, and listened, and fed, and fed some more, and then listened again. And by the end of it, Steve felt better than he ever had before.
But then, after he was out of subtle approaches, Tony started to become a perfectionist. He measured everything with uncertainty, giving every possibility a 50/50 chance of happening. He didn't want to be so sure of something and then get the exact opposite. He left everything in the hands of time and chemistry.
But now, with the two staring into each other's eyes like they do in rom-coms, they could feel that chemistry pull them closer to one another, and neither hesitated when their lips collided.
Sometimes Tony stared at the flip phone mailed to him by the captain himself, seriously contemplating if whether or not he should really take the chance to call Steve. He would never forget the sound of his voice, god no, but it wouldn't be so bad to hear the real thing every now and then.
When Steve got his idea, he chuckled and began working. He made sure to work slowly so he could build up suspense in Tony’s impatient eyes and to also make the shape nice and realistic. It had to be
“Is this why you barged into my house without even a warning text?” The jock pulled his hand from his face, instead placing it on his hip.
Then what on earth is Steve's home? As he walks down those familiar steps and opens that silky glass door, in the lab is where his home is. Standing in front of all sorts of holograms, both big and small, tall and wide, is his husband Tony Stark, orchestrating all the technology around him with sharp swipes to any direction and delicate taps to any screens.
Now even more confused, Steve just stands there awkwardly. Then slowly, he wraps his arms around the brunette and pats his back gently, trying to be some sort of comfort.
Steve inspected the broken zipper, stroking his nonexistent beard in thought. You might be asking, “Why the fuck is this idiot using a sewing kit to fix a zipper?” Well, you see, Steve isn't really the fixing type, and Tony knows this. Tony himself is the fixing type, but Stevie here is the artistic kind. Whenever Tony has a problem with anything, Steve just doodles with it and it’s actually successful at making Tony happy again. But this jacket, however, will be a challenge for Steve to make better. Tony cherished this thing like it was his favorite person in the world, and Steve knew he was a close second. So, to repair this, Steve had to be very precise on what image to sew into this jacket to make it all better.
unimportant things and, for the most part, he'd won many arguments about whatever the topic was at that time.
?!" He jogged up to his colleague and instantly a huge boulder came into view. Steve leaned forward an inch, only to discover in terror that Tony's legs were trapped underneath, crushed and bloody.
It didn't take long until Steve was on top of him, pulling at his lapels urgently as a sloppy attempt to strip him naked.
Tony thanked him and the man left after a kind wave goodbye. The brunette himself sat on the fountain and started to read. “Our first kiss was here baby! I sort of died when you pulled me in so suddenly and shut me up. I still cringe thinking about how rambly I got prior to the lip lock. But anyway, your lips are really nice. You're really nice. I like you. Maybe we can be boyfriends. ;) Move on to the forest. - Steve x.”
It started out slow, casual, mistaken for usual kindness rather than an actual sign of affection and liking. Tony had offered Steve a cup of coffee. Steve skeptically said yes, and from then on Tony asked him daily. It only took a week, however, until Tony was up earlier than Steve, brewing him a coffee right before he woke, leaving a sticky note on what has now been claimed his permanent coffee cup that had his name quickly scribbled onto it.
Tony was now the one to resist. He didn't want Steve to see him so miserable like this, and as late as it is, he hoped to convince the blond to get some rest despite himself.
Steve laughed, draping the jacket over Tony's slumped shoulders. “I took my time with this one, baby. Come on, give me credit.”
He wasn't the kind of guy to go out of his way and ask anyone to give him a hand because he took his independence
Steve had found something to search for. Steve had searched for justice, for equality in this world. Thankfully, people have matured since the 40s. There was little racism, little discrimination, compared to back then. There were only those occasional extraterrestrial wars that he and his team needed to step in and help with, and they never stopped until they won.
The blond opened the top drawer on the left first, being greeted with specks of dust that whooshed around like annoying pests. He swiped them out of his face then grabbed a random folder, opening the thick paper and checking the contents inside. He slouched against an abandoned table adjacent to the drawers, starting his mental narration of the project notes.
But still, with Tony's developing obsessiveness over Steve's possible reaction to his offer, he found the determination to continue planning his approach. Of course, he'd need Steve to trust him--build their relationship a little more, because during this time Tony and Steve weren't on the best of terms. They argued days on end like an old married couple, always catching something, whether big or small, to shout about.
“Yeah, that's right.” Tony huffed with pretend-arrogance, leaning forward to kiss Steve lovingly. When they parted, Steve pulled out some homemade pancakes and eggs and two bottles of Tony's favorite beer.
Tony looked up from his armor's arm, a piece of bread hanging from his mouth. He quickly put his tools down and took the snack out from between his teeth after taking a bite and said, “Hey, baby. What's up?”
drinks while looking through some files, but I'm all gud, bubby! Now gimme a li'l smooch," Tony leaned in again, throwing his arms around Steve's neck, but his boyfriend resisted. Tony stopped his gentle tug, but he pouted. "What's wrong hunny?"
Tony felt his whole body melt and his heart wheeze so loudly he might've died. He grinned so big and ran up to the jock, ripping the sign from his grasp and hugging him tight. “Of course I'll go to prom with you you big loser!” He said when he pulled away, shoving Steve in the chest playfully. Steve smiled and set the picnic basket down.
Steve had just stared at him dumbfounded, jaw hanging as he thought of what to say. Tony didn't know why. He didn't expect hesitation. He only counted the immediate answers like yes and no--he didn't fathom the possibility of Steve taking careful consideration.
“Tony Stark! Stop right there!” The blond said firmly. To be honest with you, despite his situation, Tony found that serious, growling tone very attractive, and he couldn't help the silent plea for him to continue talking.
Eventually he did find it, and he held it up with victory before opening it and studying the subject's pictures.
It never felt like they truly loved him, and so that just clicked into his day-to-day mind set. As if on default, he'd think nobody loved him. He never even truly believed Pepper had loved him when they were dating, even though she was there for him when the world went to hell. That was the cause to their break-up. Pepper was done with him and Tony believed she deserved better. No, Tony
Tony quickly stood, and so did the blond. “Actually, I know Tony Stark. I'll go get him for you!” The criminal said, then he bolted right out that door. The second the breeze hit him was the second all sounds turned off except for his frantic breaths as he condemned his legs to move faster than a cheetah's.
“I already told you. They remind me of good times, they're cute, and IIIIIIIII want . . . to wear them. Near Christmas time.”
Steve knew what he'd been searching for his whole life. He searched for the good path back in the 40s; he'd dreamt about starting a family; he wished for a blossoming relationship with his then love-of-his-life Peggy Carter.
Finally, when Steve leveled eyes with Tony, he kissed his lips, chapped and bitten and yet still holding that perfection Steve had been missing. Tony didn't complain, he just avoided touching Steve as to not cover him in grease, but honestly the great Captain America couldn't care less.
“Okay, but,” Tony turned around, struggling slightly, “maybe kiss me before you shove me into your car? It's the least you can do for li'l old me.”
For once in his life, the armor he was so comfortable in finally felt heavy enough to suffocate him.
“For a second there, I thought you were going to propose, what with this overwhelming sap and all. Isn't this what they do for those occasions? Not this kind?” Tony chuckled when he and Steve sat beside each other on the laid out blanket.
Tony jumped awake, pulling himself from a nightmare that consisted of deaths and being chased by a hellhound. The brunette rubbed his eyes and looked to his phone on the nightstand, which was on and had a new notification on the lock screen.
The one-story building was a bar, blasting with music that could deafen you even if you were a mile from it. Steve was already squinting his eyes and blocking an ear to muffle the sound.
The officer rolled his eyes and pinched his nasal bridge with a sigh. “You're really going to flirt with a cop after he's arrested you?”
And when the date day arrived, both men out-did themselves. They dressed casually but fancy, trying to be as pleasing to the other as possible. They had went out to eat and played arcade games, even rushing to an amusement park to just have a blast with each other.
“Howard. Why did Howard like you so much?” Tony tucked a hand into his dress pant pocket, jaw clenched as he anticipated an answer. Would he say, “Oh, because Howard saw me as a son,” or, “Oh, because Howard
"You should go on a date with me." He said casually, too flustered by himself to realize how he worded it.
Then his lips were on Steve's again, and Steve was quick to give in. The brunette didn't know if this guy was naive or he just didn't care about his reputation, but
and not react, not even bat an eyelash. He only got his ass up and accepted the spy's suggestion when the other Avengers said they couldn't stand the pleading anymore.
Everyone said their chemistry was so thick not even Natasha could quote-unquote “slice that bitch.” It was a hilarious phrase when spoken by J.A.R.V.I.S., but it made Tony have an actual crisis on how far gone he and Cap really were with each other.
. As in, literal context. Ever since their relationship became official, Tony's been giving himself permission to lay beside Steve (and Steve never complained) every night--if he wasn't tinkering with his suits down in the lab, that is.
So when Captain America came aboard the Avengers team that damned fateful day, instantly being greeted with smiles from the whole team, the cocky billionaire held his breath and tried processing everything.
Tony rolled his eyes as he grinned at the open space surrounding him. His boyfriend asking to be his boyfriend. What is this? Their wedding anniversary?
On the very rare occasions that Tony would get up and fix himself in his bathroom, probably the thing he feared most other than the civil war was his own face. He couldn't stand the scars that were set deep into him. If he looked too long, he would belch. Not that the scars were gruesome, but because Steve had been the one to do the damage. His reflection was a constant reminder of this horrible, horrible mistake on both their ends. Tony had done him dirty too, he was sure of it, but part of the broken billionaire wondered if Steve went through the same problem. Did he look in the mirror and let a tear slip when he saw his scars? Would he be disgusted looking at his broken suit because it reminded him of when he and his then-boyfriend tore each other apart with no mercy or remorse? Did he ever wish to go back in time and fix them before any of this happened? Tony did. He did every day.
“You know what?” Tony said, his eyes narrowing and a tight smile forming. “Steven Grant Rogers, you might just be the worst person I've ever met.”
Tony took a full stop, his face no longer painted with interest and instead with despair and panic. Shit. And better yet, he took the blondie's word into account and froze when he realized “on your case” meant
Tony covered his mouth, breathing in dramatically. Then, wheezing silently, he said, “He’s so fucking precious I think I might die.”
Tony pulled his hand back and nodded, letting silence take the lead. How nice of him, making things awkward between himself and his companion so quickly.
Steve never liked people worrying about him. He'd do things without help; he'd complete errands without any assist; he'd sulk without a shoulder to cry on. Everything he did was by himself, and it was mostly because his Rogers pride was too big to swallow.
Steve tries to stop himself from revealing anymore of his deepest feelings, but with the alcohol so invasive, he can't keep his mouth from moving.
Steve puts his cup down gently, clasping his hands together as if he's in a conference meeting. “Tony, what happened last night?”
And when tomorrow came around, Tony was up and at it. Granola bars were his only breakfast and he practically
“Well, I . . . I came here chasing the-the bad guys and I guess they . . . were one step ahead.” Tony said, his vision spotting in a few areas. All he could make out was Cap's uniform and the dull sky in the distance.
"Fucking Howerd . . . Suckin' up ta robots but not yur own son . . . Not even once . . . " Tony slurred miserably, taking another unusually huge gulp from his already mostly-downed beer. He'd lost count on how many he'd drunken already, but he was too intoxicated to care.
wow a semi decent tony chapter??? it's been ages!! to be fair though i did write this at 5am and i haven't gotten any sleep prior so i just know this'll be crappier when i wake up from my inevitable nap
Tony hopped off his ass and marched to the forest. The forest wasn't really a forest so much as it was just a couple trees that were deep enough to barely be considered one.
" He repeated. When Steve looked down to meet his eye, his words were stuck in his throat. The utter warmth, fondness, and
“You know,” Steve suddenly says, a lopsided grin growing on his face. Clint turns his head slightly to show Steve he's giving him his attention, but that doesn't really matter anyway because Steve's eyes aren't even open. “I can't wait to go home and see Tony.”
Steve finally looked up from the jacket, glaring at Tony softly but seriously. “Tony, I've liked you ever since we met in eighth grade. You were very loud and seemed fun to be around, even though Mr. White was right about you being an ass.”
Tony immediately froze. Prom? With Steve Rogers? He never realized how eager he was for this until he felt his heart do somersaults. "Uh--I--uhm--" Tony was at loss for words, stumbling over himself as it felt time was running out.
Every night when Tony was drowsy from restless naps in his lab, he'd trudge all the way up the bedroom floor and into Steve's pristinely chaotic room, right to his bed and then right next to him under the sheets.
Tony had been studying him ever since freshman year, watching from afar every movement the pretty boy made. The way he'd smile or the way his jaw clenched was all vivid in Tony's ripe memory, being replayed over and over again as if there was something that was hidden behind every twitch of skin that needed to be unfolded and glorified. But it just so happened that the harder Tony tried, the more mysterious Steve became.
Steve sits here now, holding Tony’s hand. “I love you so much. Do you know that?” He asks, words soft and oozing with love. “Yes,” Tony replies, just as softly. "I love you too, Steven."
“J-Jarvis!” Tony suddenly called, entering a fit of panic, “Jarvis, c . . . come online, buddy. I . . . Release me from my armor. For the love of science release me
“Nice to know you aren't as puzzling as you seem.” He stated after a while. He could hear Steve chuckle beside him. “Nice to know that you are.” Was the response. Through his peripherals, Tony noticed Steve leaning in the
He had gone out that night because Clint wouldn't leave him alone. The spy was so determined to loosen Steve up that he literally did not leave his side. Steve was trying to read a book? Clint was calling his name beside him. Steve was visiting Tony down in the lab? Clint was feet away, his voice echoing down the hall. Steve was taking a piss? Clint was outside the door, groaning and bitching about how awesome that night would be if he just agreed to come with.
Tony gasps awake, sweat covering his arms and face. He looks around his bedroom, breathing heavily. Everything's the same. It . . . It was just a dream. A god-awful dream. He wipes his face and rubs his temples, trying to forget  that traumatic nightmare.
be affected by alcohol? He was just that dude that sipped on lemonade in the corner of a bar, was he not? Certainly, the last thing the blond ever expected was to be intoxicated. And
"Look at how cute ya are, Captun!" Tony pointed to the picture of Steve before the serum. "If it wasn't for this project, I'd be taller than ya!" He remarked with a childish giggle.
It's all applause to Howard, really. He made Tony work until he had no more bones to have crumble; until he had no more sweat to shed; until there was no more coffee to be drunken. It was a pain to the brunette both physically and mentally.
After agreeing on the day the date would be held, Steve started to reciprocate a lot more. He got up earlier than Tony did to make
“Not only that,” Tony continued suddenly, “but with every accomplishment I ever had--whether it was straight As, building a high-functioning machine in first grade, or whatever the fuck else--he'd never be satisfied. I even got A-plus-plus-pluses somehow! Yet he never cared enough to even congradulate me. He made me feel like such a disappointment for so long . . . ”
Every folder Steve had pulled out during the next few minutes were boring, but finally, after some not-so-deep searching, he found something jackpot-like.
Steve silently thanked him every morning as he took a sip, feeling refreshed with the spoonful of creamer, dash of sugar, and sprinkle of affection all mixed into one special mug.
The man didn't answer, instead pulling out a random cord and turning Tony around, now slamming his chest into the wall, which the brunette didn't enjoy either. He felt his wrists being tied and nimble fingers brushing against his knuckles, which he secretly craved more of. “You're under arrest.” Is all that came out of the blond's mouth.
Tony gets into Steve's room and lays him down on his bed, removing his jacket before doing so. Steve's eyes at this point are ready to go on lockdown and let him pass out for the night, but the blond still pushes himself to look Tony through and through. “Wait, Tony--” Steve manages, waving his arm around as an attempt to grab the billionaire.
Tony didn't have anything serious to discuss when he thought of calling Steve, he just wanted to do late night talks that weren't limited by time or distance--he wanted the warmth of Steve's voice to swirl him around and revive his soul that had since been dull. He just wanted to beg Steve back, as if it was his fault the accords appeared, as if it were his fault his boyfriend's best friend killed his parents. As if everything was his fault. He would gladly admit to it if it meant Steve would fall back to him.
“Yeah. I'm just--” Tony took a quick glance back at Steve, who was trying to make light conversation with Thor, “I'm just puzzled.”
Steve always thought he had good self-control. It was rare that he ever let anything slip off his tongue--even in those worst-case scenarios--but when it
“This was our chill-out spot when we were just bros. I really like this place. Sadly, we haven't visited here in a while. I'd really like to get back to our daily trips here and have some more quality time with you. ♡ Follow the rose-petal-and-confetti trail and read the upcoming papers. - Steve x.”
"Never, Steve. Never you." He replied as solidly as he could through his slurred tongue. "I love you, and I know you love me, so why bother being toxic with something as butiful as being in a relationship with you when there are other things out there to be mopey about?"
Steve blinked once or twice. “I suppose they are, but--I'm less puzzling than Hawkeye, and Hawkeye--”
Tony closed his eyes again and managed a hoarse chuckle. "Y-you can say this at my funeral if you want, but . . . You w-were always my favorite d-dumbass."
But as time passed and Tony's feelings grew more sure, the genius only became more chaotic. He spent many sleepless nights thinking about approaching Rogers with a soft hello rather than a scornful glare. He didn't want it to seem like he was finally bowing down to Steve--heaven's no--but he didn't want to continue with the hourly fights.
Tony smiled, his face going red as quickly as an anime girl's. He leaned in and kissed Steve briefly, whispering an “I love you too,” against his lips before pulling away.
“Yes!” Tony hissed. “Live it down, Green Goliath. I'm just--” Another glance to Steve, another point of dignity taken down. “Mr. Patriot confuses me. A lot.”
Steve shut his eyes tight and rolled his lips into his mouth, letting tears pour uncontrollably as he heard Iron Man give his final exhale.
When he retrieved the beaten-down box, he returned to the brunette and sat beside him on the edge of the bed, pulling the jacket from his hands. Tony let him take it easily, watching it slide from his grasp and lay in Steve's lap instead.
Steve’s arms momentarily left his boyfriend's neck to adjust Tony's around his waist before they returned to their comfortable spot.
Maybe he wasn't as puzzling as Tony thought, thanks to Bruce's ramble on him, but the back of Tony's brain still itched. Itched with the obsessiveness of wanting to stop being puzzled. Puzzled by Steve Rogers.
And that was it. He was silenced by a hungry kiss. When the officer pulled away, he mumbled, “It's Steve.” Then he shut the door and went into the driver's seat, roaring the engine and driving off.
When Clint and Cap are on the main living floor, Thor and Bruce are shoving each other while playing video games, Natasha is there watching them, and Tony is standing at the island counter in the open kitchen.
Now that Steve thinks about it, that's probably why Tony never touched those drawers in the first place.
So now, here he is, screaming into his pillow in the privacy of his bedroom and cringing over the earlier scenario.
When Steve pulled away, he smiled gently and took a step back from Tony, a few smudges of blackish-brown now present on his shirt. “Come on, try-hard, I'll make you some breakfast. And wash yourself up. You're dirty.”
“Fuck you too, Rogers.” Is the ending of their discussion, then some shuffling and a door carelessly slamming shut.
Immediately, Steve's pale cheeks were tinted the softest shade of pink, and from here on out he just
“I'm going to talk to him.” Tony suddenly announced, pushing himself off the wall and marching with confidence all the way to the flag-dressed blond.
Tony's cheeks flushed considerably. “All-American shameless prick of a bastard,” he muttered under his breath.
You might be guessing what Steve's "home" is. Is the tower he lives in home? On a literal standpoint, yes, but in Steve's head? No. Is his bedroom filled with vintage souvenirs and a cozy bed his home? Though Steve reflects on the life he should've had and his room is the provider for those memories, no, that place isn't home either.
ew this is rushed and ugly because it's summer where i am and i'm so close to melting from this heat
“S-Steven! Cap-- Oh god, stop . . . " Tony wheezed through gritted teeth, "L-leave me, I . . . I can make it out myself.”
“Whoa! I go to piss and eat some bagels and I come back to this??” Bruce shouted from the door, scaring the absolute shit out of both Metal Man
Using the tunnels, they got to the Governor’s offices in no time. Tony unlocked the door with his palm print, and they breezed past the security guards who were not expected or trained to engage in human altercations.
Besides the scant handful of posts reminding Tony’s fans of the years that he spent in tight jeans and speedos on Mexican telenovelas, IBD typically devoted its pages to flattering or complimentary candid shots taken by people who spotted Tony on set or wandering around town. And judging by Steve’s bookmarked posts alone, he was intimately familiar with the whole IBD catalog of Tony exercising, whether it was doing uphill lunges, pull-ups at playgrounds, or stretching out after a run. One particularly coveted post commemorated the six months Tony devoted to building 40 pounds of muscle, but Steve had learned the hard way to avoid opening that one in public at all cost.
Steve focused on his voice to anchor himself in the present. Tony was his choice; this was a man he wanted. When Tony’s thrusts soon became uncoordinated and desperate, Steve pushed back to reciprocate his interest. It was the final straw. Tony thrust into him one final time and came with a strangled cry that Steve thought might have been his name.
“Nick, Maria,” Steve greeted them both as he stepped into Fury’s office. Fury sat behind his imposing desk, ever observant without giving his own thoughts away. Beside him, Maria casually stood in wait, less expressive than their boss.
“The question is, where do you most like to be scratched?” Chris read off his notepad, then with a curious look at them both, added, “and are people usually good about finding it?”
From his commandeered terminal, Tony called up the Cryo-Prison security system and replaced the map of New Yorseylvania with live footage from the prison. One after another, he clicked through cameras in every room of the building until he found what he was looking. In the main conference hall, the bodies of two dead guards littered the scene at grotesque angles. They watched, powerless, as Warden Harold Hogan crawled across the floor, fresh blood obscuring half of his face.
“That was genius!” Josh bubbled over with glee. “What’d he say, don’t bully Captain America’s husband? Something like that.”
As they arrived to their floor, Tony led them down to the left. “My domicile is this way,” he started to explain. He showed Steve how to open the scanning pad, then invited Steve to press his palm to the scanner himself. “It will not hurt, Steve Rogers. Just a light touch will do.”
“Officer Jane Foster, allow me to introduce Captain Steven G. Rogers,” Tony said in slow, patient words that gave Jane the chance to compose herself. The young officer did her best, tugging her jacket into place and standing up straight with her shoulders back.
He offered the pink peonies to Tony again, but this time he did so at a distance. Tony looked at the peonies for a beat before looking up at Steve.
Tony rolled over and looked up at him with beautiful, bright, laughing eyes, utterly unrepentant. “Still your friend though, aren’t I?”
Bond was quiet for a short period, probably moving through unsafe space. After a minute or two of radio silence, Tony heard the agent gleefully whisper, “Why, what’d you put in it?”
“No—no, wait, that’s,” Steve tried to explain without laughing at the absurdity of the rumor, but eventually he could only groan and start over. “So, I read the book first in 2015 while we were shooting the third Cap, uh, Captain America movie,
Steve sighed, then with a wink and a smile he slid off her desk to let himself into H’s adjoining office. His meeting was brief, more so than usual. Steve’s last mission had only been a partial success; Venice was no more submerged than it was the week prior, but Scorpius had gotten away. What little Steve had salvaged only baffled Q branch; the data was there, but it was either too damaged to view, or the security installed in the drive was beyond the best at MI-6. Either way, Steve was firmly back to square one.
Steve probably should have rolled his eyes or snarked back, but some indescribable knot loosened in his chest, and Steve felt warm and content deep in his bones.
Tony chanced one last furtive look after Bruce to be sure he was not looking their way, then before Steve had a chance to move, he took to the ladder quickly and started the downward climb.
Before Rumlow has a chance to punch the terminal monitor, two NYPD patrol vehicles screech to a halt behind him. Now,
Steve blinked at him. Was Tony having a stroke? Should he be calling an ambulance? Did people talk about Scandinavia when they had strokes? Quickly, Steve ended his own call and hurried up the stairs to help usher Tony back to bed.
His last order of business had been ‘accidentally’ ordering a mattress on Tony’s phone. Steve had been
“By his admission, Tony sometimes uses sex as practical research for his books. You’d have to read them closely to tell them apart, but basically, he said the scenes the killer used were all based in real experience. That can’t be a coincidence.”
“I’m working on a new piece right now,” Tony explained, pausing only to thank the waiter as she brought their cocktails and fried pickles over. “I’m trying to turn the typical narrative of how women can ‘make themselves more desirable to men’ into how they can better protect themselves from abusive relationships.”
“Is it true you have operated an airplane, Captain Steven G. Rogers?” Jane asked as soon as the car doors sealed around them. “Were you up amongst the stars?”
With all that attention and focus, wanting to take care of him, Steve would make damn sure that Tony came first. And as Tony was catching his breath, body still going through tremors, fingers still curled around Steve's hair, Steve would pull him even closer and push in further, wrap his arms around Tony's body and
Tony barely cared to breathe in his urgency to feel his mouth and his throat heavy with the weight of Steve’s cock, sucking hard and gagging himself repeatedly to constrict his throat the way Steve responded to best. Steve’s cock was still half-hard when the first dribble of pre-cum leaked down Tony’s throat. Tony didn’t taste it, but he felt the effect immediately. The world around him faded away, the tension and fear evaporated from his body, and all that mattered was
“Not exactly,” Sam said with a wry look. It wasn’t like any of them ever believed their gadgets would live forever, but there was a particular rage that set in when their gadgets were lost
“The lentil soup is good, and the fried pickle poppers,” Steve said and pointed them out on his own menu, but on Tony’s other side, Bucky grimaced.
“He said you had afternoon tea at Palm Court and a five-o’clock at the Guerlain Spa,” Happy answered without added flare or pomp. “I don’t ask any questions.”
Careful of Steve’s recently recovered injuries, Tony sat up and straddled Steve’s midsection. “Let me get this straight,” he asked in a playful parody of an interrogating officer. “You wanted sex, but you invited me out at
They didn’t neglect their duties so much as they got creative with their spare time. When they shared a stretch car to the entertainment organized for the second evening, Steve savored every minute on his knees. When they could have gone for a coffee or some fresh air in the intermissions between panel presentations, Tony put his AI to good use and found unoccupied offices where the two of them could make good use of the sturdy desks.
“I… I suppose you are not inaccurate, Steve Rogers,” Tony replied with an uncomfortable tremble in his voice.
“What of the young woman in the yellow dress?” he said, and both Tony and Bruce turned to see whom he meant. “The one laughing with her friends.”
A part of him wanted to hesitate. Soon, an hour would pass, and Steve would wonder how the Mets were doing, or if he’d received an email about a class. One way or another, this was too good to be true.
“To your single room,” Rhodey continued, in case Tony hadn’t realized just how much more obvious and reasonable the reverse of his plan had been all along. “Where nobody knows who he is, or what he’s doing here.”
“I am the Governor of New Yorseylvania, I do not answer to any man,” Pierce said in a deep, threatening voice. “And judging from your behavior, I am beginning to wonder if your penchant for violence as a means to solving all your problems makes you suitable to our fine city. After all, perhaps the fracas in the museum was not the result of Rumlow’s presence, but of yours.”
Tony took his group in a less-than-linear tour of the zoo. Instead of trying to collect an animal for every letter of the alphabet, or draw an animal at every enclosure, he encouraged the kids to think about why the animals looked so different. They didn’t need to draw the whole animal, but he asked them to try to capture what seemed to be the most unique aspect of every animal, what feature they had developed in order to survive.
The video began with Tony and Jim in a marketplace unlike anything Eisenturm, and Steve recognized Fiorera’s Saturday market in a heartbeat. The voices in the background and the jaunty, uplifting music of the fisarmonica brought him right back to happy memories walking through the market with his mother. Unlike the markets in Machtberg where most people arrived with purpose and attentively perused groceries and wares, old marketplaces of Terrini were a site for socializing with friends near and far.
With a smug chuckle and a playful jangle of the keys, Steve tossed him the keyring. They pulled into traffic and let the radio fill the silence. Steve knew he’d have to tell Bucky something about what he’d learned about Tony and the nurse, but how? There was no way to separate what Tony had done from the important details, and Bucky was already suspicious of Tony. Steve still didn’t know how to feel about what he’d learned. He didn’t need Bucky on his case right now.
“Don’t be a smartass,” Steve tried to say without grinning, not that he ever could. Tony preened at the compliment and put his own menu aside to give Steve his attention. Recalling what Steve had just said, Tony settled his chin in his palm to comfortably take in the beautiful view.
The ten minute video began with a familiar scene in Tony’s workshop: Tony slumped over a workstation, his face obscured by a welding helmet while he grasped a torch in one hand and a slim piece of metal in the other. Fortunately his grip through the gloves had gone slack enough that the torch had gone out without causing more than superficial damage to the table.
“There’s nothing wrong with it, but you’re—” Sharon said with a sigh, gesturing at him. “You look great, but you’re too desperate to look that good.”
Tony choked on his beer and just barely got his hand over his mouth before he sprayed it over his couch. “You,” he croaked out, struggling to cough and breathe through the giggle fit that sent his beer down the wrong pipe. “That—
“Taobe, thank you for telling me. You have only made me happier,” Steve said with a smile that he could barely contain. If he had read Taobe’s story in a letter in the privacy of the palace, he would have cried openly. Cried and then saved it to share a cry with Tony again later. But here, in person, he had to be composed. He had to be a leader.
He could feel Steve’s answering smile. “For you? I can try,” Steve replied quietly. “Tony, do you want to stay in tonight, or go out?”
In the embrace of lush, flowering trees stood a stately, three story villa. It belonged in a fairy tale more than the real world, with its three chimneys and terracotta roof. It looked settled in its lush embrace of lemon trees, with peach colored stucco walls and off-white granite steps leading to a sprawling porch. The windows were decorated with white, hand-carved frames, but without the typical ornate frills and arches of Mediterranean architecture, it looked understated in its elegance.
By the time he got Tony out of his apartment, Steve had his work cut out for him. He suspected a pair of boots would be required reading for those country yokels, and since he couldn’t afford to make a bad impression, he immediately made a call to his personal shopper.
Why was Tony sad? “Here,” Steve offered him some of his cotton candy cocoon, “you need cotton candy.”
The situation was different and more serious, but it wasn’t so long ago that Tony had said something similar about a movie that was only theirs. Something they had created together before Tony left to promote
“Never done this in a suit before,” Colin observed with a little frown, shaking out his arms in his button up. Without the accommodating stretch of workout clothes, or the freedom of nudity, Colin couldn’t quite find a comfortable position once his arms and shoulders braced to hold his weight.
“I can’t—it’s not my place to tell you, Tony,” Clint said more quietly. “But, I’ll say that she cares about you. A lot. She’s not binding herself to Chief Talia because she wants to, she’s doing it so we can be free. She’d rather be with you in some smelly, stupid cottage.”
As their lips eased apart, Steve still held Tony’s face in his hands with his thumb brushing over Tony’s cheek. Unable to resist, he leaned in for one more kiss. Then quietly, even playfully, he whispered, “If it pleases Your Majesty, your tired, old fiancé would like to sleep so he can wake up tomorrow and exist one day closer to being your husband.”
Steve blatantly preened over Josh’s comments. “You want to talk timing,” he said with a shameless grin. “After Tony’s Golden Globe speech Trump tried to sully the moment by suggesting that Tony and his mother were undocumented. Even Tony’s Wiki page says he was born in Manhattan, but it seems literacy is too much to expect of Trump. My favorite part of this whole story is that Tony and I had gotten married only a month before that, in December. We decided early on not to go public about it, but I guess Bucky couldn’t resist retweeting a clip from the speech in
“I… I don’t really remember,” she whispered, needing to sit down in one of the guest chairs at Steve’s desk. “Besides, things are different now. People do everything online. But, try to think of something you could do together that you would both enjoy? What do we know about him?”
“Put him down, come on!” Sharon told them, and Bucky quickly let go so he and Steve could hurry over to where Carol and Sharon were waiting.
“Your dad’s right, Flora, the sun can be really brutal, and like Harvey says, our skin burns. Giraffes have skin just like us, and they can burn, too. And because they are always sticking their tongues out to pick leaves off trees, the last four to five inches of their tongues have evolved over time to be dark purple so it doesn’t burn in the sun. Can you guess how long a giraffe’s whole tongue is?”
“Coffee? Saturday? Eleven o’clock, Maitre Choux on Harrington Road. I’ll wear something fitted. Sexy but tasteful, because I’m not trying too hard.”
that rose with that hope. “What if I can’t make it work? What if it’s the beginning of the end? If I can’t even wake up—”
He was eyeing the curtains his mom had made him trying to guess how angry she’d be if he turned it into a toga when there was a knock at the door.
“Cause nobody applauds or wolf whistles at debate,” she drawled with a smile curling her lips. “Genius.”
“Tony, I’m tired,” Steve said quietly, a touch apologetic. “Between the junket this morning and the flight, I’m just done.”
Steve couldn’t resist walking back to him to cradle Tony’s face gently in his hands and lifting his head to press a kiss to his spit-slick lips.
“Hi everyone! My name is Steve Rogers,” Steve announced in a loud but cheerful tone of voice. “You might know me as Captain America. I want to clear something up real quick: I’m a proud Hufflepuff,” he said more loudly to be heard over Tony’s distracting giggling and attempts to shut him up. “And Trelawny is my favorite character. She’s underrated and brilliant. And your city is great, thank you for—”
Tony interviewed by Seth Meyer talking about the episode of SNL he's hosting the week before the Academy Awards, where Tony makes it very, very clear which one is more intimidating and exciting.
“Don’t sell yourself short,” Steve assured him after a brief silence. “You’re sweeter than you think.”
Their first date was a simple affair, a dinner and a walk on the beach. It had been Steve’s suggestion to go to Dune’s new Venice Beach location, but after the way he had insisted that it a date and not just a dinner, Tony would have happily gone anywhere.
Steve continued to quietly observe Tony in his stoic, indescribable expression. Never had Tony felt more betrayed by the esteemed Jason Statham.
When the door closed behind her, Tony bowed his head and hid his face against Steve’s shoulder. “I am so sorry,” he whispered. “She won’t touch you, Steve. Nobody will hurt you, I promise.”
you?” Tony tried to say with a straight face, but the moment Steve raised his brows in a further challenge, his offended facade started to slip into a delighted burst of snickering. “New Jersey, Steven? Really?”
Tony moved back to New York as planned. He was folded into Howard’s leading R&D team from day one. Between the pressure to perform and the exceptional standards set by the team, Tony lost himself in his work. There were no weak links in the flagship lab, and newcomers weren’t afforded any slack. Especially not the owner’s son.
His friends, his mother; his education and his service to the university and to the army - everyone who had helped him find his way and achieve his goals were all reflected and honored in some way on his body. Even the man who was not there in person was close to his heart. Under his robes and his dress uniform, kept warm against his skin, Steve wore the gold band that had never met its intended owner.
Tony rolled his eyes, but he closed the door and flicked the chain off so he could step back and let her in. “Should I fear for my life?” he asked, only half-joking. “To what do I owe this pleasure?”
“No,” Steve said with the distaste of someone who knew he was being duped. “You can’t…  right? You can’t ride a manatee.”
“Hey everybody! My first guest tonight is an actor who’s been in the business less than three years and he’s already a household name. You know him from
If going to Harvard and Yale to study law was what Kennedys and Roosevelts and Vanderbilts did, then damnit, so would he. He had a 4.0 in anthropology from NYU, he had five years of work experience - including a fundraising event for UNICEF where he was invited to collaborate with David and Victoria Beckham! - and he had great relationships with his professors. They had been surprised by his sudden change in career goals, but all four of those he reached out to heartily agreed to support him with glowing recommendations.
“Steve, reconsider,” were the first words out of Tony’s mouth, but all Steve could give him was a bittersweet smile.
“Sir is already on his way,” JARVIS reported without remorse while Bucky shoved the pillow away to look at Steve like he was crazy.
“I do, Pookie,” Brock assured him with a quick flash of his smoldering smirk, the one that always left Steve weak in the knees. “But the thing is, if I’m gonna be a senator by the time I’m thirty, I can't keep dicking around.”
He could feel someone staring at him, and instinctively looked up at Steve again. Steve was watching him with such clear, focused intent that Tony was sure he was about to tell him something really important any second.
“It means another man frequently resided at the address where we believe the letter originated from,” Steve tried to explain, but Hammer rolled his eyes and turned away to whatever one of his agents had brought up to show him.
“I’m so bummed I didn’t get the memo about dressing up like tired hags,” he said with an intentional shrug to show off the definition of his shoulders and chest, “but maybe that was just a theme for you and your most delightful friends.”
Tony didn’t say anything for some time. He continued leaning against Steve’s side, resting his head on Steve’s shoulder while they observed the spectacle.
the length is right to create a seal. Too short, the penis can’t clear out the old sperm closest to target; too long, and you don’t get the sealing effect, so only a third or fourth of the old sperm is removed. And that,” he added, raising his glass to them both, “is the Cliff notes on the evolution of primate peen.”
Given Steve’s relative obscurity and the minimal information available about their relationship, the media lost it when Tony first stepped out with a wedding ring. He’d been on the red carpet at Gotham Hall for a charity auction for Carol’s foundation when the first photographer caught the golden shine on his ring finger.
“Boys are turned into the wild when they are young, many of us survive,” Clint pointed out. “And she was cast away by magic, so she could never return alone. I heard she will always be waiting for someone to find her, someone whose compassion can return her to this world. Once she becomes the Great Chief, she can reverse my spell and save us—not just you and me, but all men.”
“I never thought I’d hear you call me that again,” Tony whispered, his words warm with affection but catching on a sob that threatened to overtake him. “I love you, too, Steve, and I promise I will never leave you in the dark again.”
“As you say,” Tony sighed in agreement, then turned to look at his anxious partner. “Bruce Banner, my friend. I will not allow you to endanger your eligibility to sow offspring. I formally request that you return to the precinct and inform them of our plan.”
Steve couldn’t look away from him, from the affection in Tony’s eyes, and the easy way he smiled back at Steve. In those brown eyes, Steve found that nothing mattered but the two of them, and this private moment they shared.
They met with the four detectives at the 62nd as planned. Detectives found CCTV footage from a Chase ATM machine that had captured a passing figure in a hoodie matching the description of the person seen with Giordani’s car near the shipyards. Although it was true that many people wore jeans and hoodies, it wasn’t as common in December. Steve grabbed a copy of the footage, thanked them for their cooperation so far, and warned them of the change in oversight.
“I understand you mean US Army Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes, sir. His light was extinguished in the Big One of 2021,” Tony replied as gently as he could, as if his tone of voice would make a difference somehow.
“Mr. Rogers? Oh..” Tony was too tired for this. Motioning to the water Phil lifted the cup again, letting him drink.
“If we just make a few adjustments to your contract we could-” the paper cup crinkled under Tony’s grip. A maddened expression etched itself across his face, distorted behind his sunglasses.
Steve walked towards Tony, reaching out his hand to graze against the armor on the shorter man’s arm.
“You must have had a long night, Phil. I’ll make sure I take good care of Tony and teach him about his new home.” Steve spoke smoothly to the other man. Phil seemed to have hesitated for a moment but nodded tiredly.
Women and men in black ran over, pushing Steve aside and gripping the man, placing him in cuffs that dimly shines of green. The person’s cries were muffled as he got tossed around until he entered a car.
“I took a test, met the others, and dealt with you. Don’t I deserve a break?” Steve chuckles openly at the man he was assigned to defend.
“It’s fine.” Tony raked through his salad. He didn’t want that incident to change anything. If he was meant to die he would have died. If anything he felt more alive in the face of danger than he had for the past five years.
“What’s all this for anyway?” Steve asked with a huff as he placed the final box down on the space next to where the brunette reclined. Tony took a moment to answer as his eyes decided on their own accord to swipe along the other man’s robust arms.
“If you were in any typical danger it’s my job to protect you by any means.” Steve cleared his throat after saying this, easing himself into his seat.
“What do you see?” The images faded and he opened his eyes with a small huff, in awe of what he just experienced.
“Look at you,” Steve said as Tony walked into the common room with his polished armor. He hadn’t made a helmet yet but he decided whatever he had was good enough for the short notice.
“Can already see those wheels turning, good for you,” Steve said cockily as began to leave, stopping before opening the door.
“Isn’t it a bit soon to be measuring each other Cap?” Tony says smugly as he begins removing his tie. He felt a bit suffocated, even with himself being the driving force of the air around them with his own remarks. The other man just shook his head with disbelief and a slight smile, face turning the slightest hint of red.
“you have to too. That isn’t fair for you either.” Steve’s brows knitted in confusion and he turned towards the other man. He wasn’t used to someone considering the fact that he wasn’t impartial to all this.
“Most of the people who live here are asleep but Mr. Rogers messaged me a few minutes ago. Make yourself at home until he gets here.” Tony plants himself heavily onto the couch, spreading out comfortably until another slight jolt comes from his head. No longer painful but enough to understand when some sort of image was going to be shown to him.
, I know I should be grateful for this opportunity but-” as a droplet of sweat from the babbling man landed on Tony’s lip, he got up abruptly and pulled out his wallet, placing a hundred dollar bill under his cold coffee. The man stared at the money with wide eyes and when he looked up, Tony was gone.
“I promise we don’t do this often. You’re a special case, Mr. Stark. When Mr. Rogers brought you in for your emergency care he was devastated and stayed here for a little over 13 hours. We finally got him to go get some rest but we told him we would let him know when you’re okay. But we’ve decided that’s your choice if you’re willing to see him after all that has happened.”
“I think they have the wrong guy. A serum like that and this is how you’re acting?” Steve’s words shocked Tony. His face paled but regained color at the blonde’s teasing smile.
Patiently, the blonde sat outside the door as Tony was getting scanned. Steve fiddled with the tape measure in his hands. Letting out a humorless puff of air he got up for the millionth time, trying to settle his muddled nerves. The door opened and the brunette walked with an air of ease to Steve surprise.
“Holy cow, Tony. That thing looks insane.” Steve’s eyes were bright as he walked hurriedly to where Tony stood. Tony activates his head piece, completely upgraded and sick looking. Steve let out a prideful huff of air, mouth gaped in amazement. Tony deactivated it, exposing his face. Tony leaned in, kissing Steve with a smile on his lips.
“Oh, crap. I’m sorry. I didn’t know..” Steve wouldn’t look Tony in the eye. “And I was pushing..” Steve’s brows furrowed as he brought his hand up, trailing over the new design Tony had created for his reactor.
“We have a lot to do today so it’s time to get up,” Steve spoke lowly. Tony grumbled while sitting up and stared Steve down with sleep filled eyes.
“Good. Now we have some serious matters to discuss.” Phil began shuffling into a comfortable position, slotting his fingers together.
“Well then, this is unnecessary.” Tony began to walk away. Steve was quick, latching his fingers firmly around his wrist. The brunette pulled lightly at his hand but was greeted with a harsher grip.
Taking a car supplied by the company they road into the city. Turning on the radio a hurried male voice spoke,
