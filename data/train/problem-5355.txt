Tony had been down in his lab, working on an algorithm with Bruce when he received a text from Pepper, asking him to look over some files she was emailing him, and he replied a short, friendly answer. They didn’t talk as much as they used to, though they were much friendlier to each other unlike when they first broke up. But they were friends once more, and Pepper told him that she was dating someone new, and the brunette was genuinely happy for her.
“Well, during the greatest battle the warriors ever fought, Brayan was struck by an arrow when he blocked it from hitting Ferris, the tip lodging close to his heart. Running to his side, Ferris held his dearest friend as he bled out, the battle continuing around them.” Steve stopped then, chuckling. “I’m sorry, you probably have no interest in this.”
Steve wanted to come desperately, and when he felt Tony’s fingers press ever so gently on the outside of his prostate, the beads just below stimulating him, Steve was on the verge of sobbing from the built pressure. He couldn’t really speak as Tony did what he pleased to him, teasing Steve and pressing the pad of a finger on the head of his weeping length, white pre-release clinging to the brunette’s digit.
“Do you trust me, Stevie?” Tony asked, two fingers tracing from Steve’s jaw down to the curve of the man’s neck and shoulder.
He flew back to Stark Tower in a flash, hoping the glitch in the power system wouldn’t set them back too far. Tony was close to getting Stark Tower to be completely dependent on clean energy through the arc reactor power. He could do it, he knew he could, but his mind had been a bit out of sorts since Captain America had been plucked from ice, preserved in the cold. How he was still alive floored Tony's mind, even with the power of the serum that moved through the super soldier's veins.
Tony racked his brain until he realized who she was referring to. “Are you talking about Captain America? Steve?” Tony asked incredulously, an eyebrow quirked. Pepper just nodded. “Look, he was my childhood hero growing up. You know that. Doesn’t mean I love him,” Tony said a bit defensively. “Hell, I didn’t even like the guy for the longest time.” Tony and Steve had butted heads on absolutely everything when they first met. Tony was disappointed that Steve wasn’t as heroic as Captain America was. And Steve had found Tony to be beyond irritating, his ways nowhere near Steve’s orderly fashion.
Without a word, Tony pulled one of the tails of the bow that held Steve wrists, releasing the confines and freeing the super soldier’s hands. The blonde looked to Tony, confused until the genius took each of Steve’s arms and placed them above his head. It was only when Tony took the ribbon and tied his boyfriend’s wrists to the headboard did recognition settle upon Steve’s handsome face. Tony then moved his love just a bit, till Steve was propped up on a few large pillows
“I’ll have to add one for next time,” Tony said, eyes sparkling with love and moonlight from above. The super soldier let out a huff of laughter before pulling a sheet over Tony and himself.
"Oh, well I was walking through the Ancient art exhibit and passed out," Steve said nonchalantly, ignoring Tony's shocked expression. "I am alright. But I had this dream while unconscious about two men in ancient Greece who became soulmates. This statue reminded me of the one," Steve explained. "Weird, right?"
“I’m ready for that mid-morning nap now,” Tony grumbled happily as he wrapped his arms around his love. Steve grinned and chuckled lightly, stretching to grab the comforter that spilled partly off of the bed. At least that had been spared by the mess he and Tony had made. It was laundry day anyways.
The genius pulled the super soldier forward until Steve could rest his cheek on Tony’s shoulder so that Tony could unlace his boyfriend’s corset with ease. Steve breathed easily, sighing happily when Tony would press an unforeseen kiss to the blonde’s shoulder while he worked. Steve didn’t have the corset tied overly tight, and so, slowly but surely, Tony undid the laces at the bottom of the blonde’s spine and worked at loosening the thick, cream laces.
There was the sound of a finger tapping on a microphone then, and the two men turned to see the blonde woman Steve was talking to standing on the small stage behind a mahogany podium.
"I am here, Steve. Right here, my soulmate," Tony whispered, a few tears trailing down his cheeks then. Tony couldn’t find the energy to wipe them away even. All he could focus on was Steve. Every rise and fall of his chest, the steady beep of his heart rate. The genius's mark swelled and bloomed, his body feeling the pain Steve's own broken body was going through. His memory of their past lives came to him, remembering that prehistoric couple and the way the dark-haired man took away some of his soulmate's pain from child birth. It dawned on him then, that these visions and memories he and Steve had had been preparing Tony and even Steve for this moment.
“Oh my,” Steve huffed out as Tony continued to tease him. The blonde saw the wet spot from his precome dampen the cotton fabric, along with Tony’s saliva. The friction felt like heated lust though his veins, everything maximized because it was Tony, the man he was in love with.
Through the primal yearning of desire and hormones, Steve didn’t neglect how beautiful this was between him and Tony. As Tony rocked into him, biting at Steve’s neck hard and moaning sweetly. And as Steve whimpered Tony’s name and pressed his cheek in against the brunette’s shoulder, his grip on the man’s upper arms probably painful, Steve felt their souls unite, as their bodies became one entity.
Once they were in the tower, Tony set the blonde down and stepped out of the Iron Man suit, still wearing his dress clothes. Steve didn’t hesitate to wrap his arms around Tony and pull him flush against his chest, looking down dotingly at the brunette. “Have I told you that I love you lately?” Steve asked, kissing Tony lightly on his nose, causing the brunette to giggle.
“Don’t worry about it. I am sure it wasn’t your computer,” Steve heard Tony mumble before thanking the man.
“Did you bring that up in your meeting?” Pepper asked, cocking her head to the side. Tony shook his head.
“Tony, what is going on, son?” The older man said, quickly throwing a few other parchments over what he was working on.
“I think that would be a great idea, actually. Though you know the minute we plan a vacation we will be sent on a mission,” Steve chuckled, wrapping his arms around Tony when the genius returned to him. Tony just shook his head and smirked, knowing Steve was absolutely right. Steve felt Tony’s hands find their way back to his ass, caressing it in large circular motions through the thin fabric. He was always sensitive back there. Tony knew that and always indulged him with his rough calloused hands, causing Steve’s skin to raise with goosebumps.
They were quiet for a moment, a slight awkward silence filling the space between them. Steve felt a little weird about everything, remembering how he found her to be cute back when she was “Kate the nurse”. Now, knowing she was closely related to his lost love, Peggy, just made him unsettled. Like he was the creepy uncle every family had or something.
Tony took the wash cloth from earlier before helping Steve turn onto his back. Slowly, he wiped the white come that was drying on Steve’s stomach, cleansing the skin before gently wiping his softening penis, being careful not to add too much pressure. Tony understood the sensitivity of Steve’s body right after an orgasm.
“Sir, I was saying Captain Rogers was entering. And since you were mumbling under the car, I assumed you said ‘okay’,” J.A.R.V.I.S remarked sassily. Tony just rolled his eyes yet again.
Steve needed a moment to breathe, to come back down to earth after that incredible climax. He wanted to be in a semi clear headspace when he cleaned Tony up with his tongue. Opening his eyes, he found Tony staring at him with fondness, stroking his hair affectionately. “You okay, Steve?” He asked, a hint of concern lacing his voice. Steve only smiled, closing his eyes and nodding bashfully.
“Yeah, me too. I guess it’s a gesture towards showing the public that the new S.H.I.E.L.D is working hard to restore itself to its early original days. Before Hydra was in the picture anyways. Tony explained, turning his face forward once more.
“Fall back please,” Tony said in a more authoritative tone, kneeling then in front of the fear stricken merman. The sea creature flinched before eliciting a small noise that to Tony’s ears sounded like pain.
So, wearing his best clothes, because no matter what Steve told himself, he had to look his best for Tony. He unsurprisingly found the man in his lab, looking exhausted.
can take the red and gold pole,” Steve started, inspecting the pole he held in his hand like he knew what would make it a decent pole. “But I’ve always wanted to fish. I don’t know, I would hear people talk about it growing up as well as now. And, it just sounds so nice and calming,” Steve explained, looking to Tony then. “Also, since you touched that hat, now you have to wear it while we fish,” Steve teased.
Instead, the man was rushed beneath the deck of the ship while the older man, whom he heard a crewmember call, Obadiah, walked towards him with a pistol. The merman knew what such a weapon could do, and so he sat still, regardless of the fear and pain that pulsed within his body, regardless of the blood that seeped from beneath his scales.
Steve’s thought left him when Tony pulled down his underwear, just enough to free up his erection that was well engorged, the white precome bubbling. Steve sighed at the relief from the pressure that the briefs were subjecting him to. His length twitched though in excitement as Tony took in the sight of it.
“It sounds like your asthma just emerged from the depths,” Tony commented, and he shifted his hand off of Steve’s inner thigh, only to accidentally hit Steve’s groin in the process. The super soldier let out a small gasp, and he could feel his swelling erection start to become a bit painful.
It was late February now, around two months since Steve and Tony had assumed the roles of boyfriends. When Steve thought about it all, it still baffled his mind, like this was all just an amazing dream. But then, Steve would see Tony, wrap his arms around the smaller man and kiss him sweetly. It was those quiet moments that reminded him that he and Tony as a couple wasn’t a dream at all, but a wonderful reality.
“I don’t care about that, Steve,” Tony barked, pressing the stop button on the elevator controls, abruptly halting them mid-way. “I care about you almost dying because of your self-righteousness.”
When the super soldier stayed quiet Tony looked up, seeing pure sincerity in Steve’s cerulean eyes. Tony had missed this, their heart to heart conversations. He could always lay his emotions and feelings out on the table when it came to Steve. He allowed himself to be vulnerable around the guy, because he knew he could confide in Steve, and Steve could always confide in him.
“And I truly love you, Steve.” Tony replied. And oh, how he meant those words with all his might. Hearing Steve’s heavy breathing, knowing the man had drifted to sleep, Tony allowed his eyes to close as well, reveling in this blissful state with his Steve. It was in this room, when Steve wasn’t Captain America, and Tony wasn’t Iron Man, the moments where everything was stripped away to just their two souls. That was what mattered in the end of it all. It was moments like this that Tony cherished the most.
Short, little gasps puffed from Steve’s throat from his own touch, biting his lower lip as heat blossomed in his lower belly once again.
“What’d you have in mind?” Steve asked, attempting to get Tony out of those jeans, his fingers fumbling with the button and zipper.
“Kinda wish I could keep you like this, though,” Tony whispered, his eyes gleaming with mischief.” You’re so compliant and stunning this way. Steve imagined how he looked in that moment, desperate and lust driven, wriggling under Tony’s sensuous touch, hungry for more.
Tony gazed upon his lover, his eyes fixated on every little detail in the super soldier’s expression as he pumped that finger inside him. Eventually he added a second and then a third finger into the blonde, kneading the sensitive flesh of the man’s channel. Steve’s face was absolutely glorious to watch. And though he wasn’t hard just yet, the brunette could feel that heated coil in his belly begin to form. Tony’s breath caught with each small moan and gasp that spilled from the other man’s lips.
“It is,” Tony replied, glancing at the apothecaries and medicinal herbs Bruce had organized along the shelves of his medical space. “And yet, Obie and the rest of the crew up there were acting as if they had merely caught a game fish,” Tony added, a look of bewilderment on his face.
That didn’t mean that soulmates didn’t exist anymore. That energetic force from legend still lived on just as strongly. But the rational mind can over power the heart, hindering a person’s view from predestined fate.
“Is this the most important thing to you?” Steve asked, a mixture of amusement and bewilderment crossing his face.
Clearing his throat and finally blinking, Tony shook his head, a smile breaking across his masculine features. “You know me better than anyone, I’m pretty sure,” the brunette responded, wiggling even closer between Steve’s legs. Brushing his hands over the super soldier’s outer thighs, Tony dug his nails into that creamy flesh of his lover’s, the fine dusting of fair hair tickling against his fingers there.
Tony began to open his gift, smiling dotingly at Steve, who sat across the way near the fireplace. Removing the crisp, white paper, Tony revealed a small brown box. When he took the lid off, the genius saw a note on top of some tissue paper. The script was the same as was on the tag, and Tony quirked an intrigued brow at the note, which read:
“Wow, you taste amazing, love,” Steve mumbled against his hole, eliciting a strangled whimper from the brunette. The blonde held onto Tony’s sides while he licked with the flat of his tongue over the man’s entrance and up to his spine, slowly and steadily. He was sweating as well as Tony, the room warm, air thick as he flicked his tongue around the man’s pink glistening rim, the chocolate sauce long gone by now.
“It appears you are the only one Sir had given the limitation to,” Steve tried to ignore the sadness that flooded his body then. He wondered if Tony caught him staring at the party the other night. Maybe he figured out Steve’s true affections for him.
“I’m what?!” Steve questioned, his own voice now raised. “No I’m not. I’m doing no such thing Tony!” Steve explained, brows furrowed in disappointment at his boyfriend’s statement. “How could you think such a thing?” And alright, now Tony was at a loss for words…that never happens.
“There happens to be a slight error, gentleman,” the concierge said, both Steve and Tony looking at him. “There is only one room available. And it is under Stark and Rogers."
“No, it’s not a bad time at all,” Tony said quickly, grabbing hold of Steve’s bicep when the blonde turned to leave. “Sorry, I’m just tired today, and have a lot on the mind,” Tony added, using every bit of strength to not squeeze his hand around Steve’s bulging muscle.
“Wait, you said one hour…Stark?!” But before he could continue, Tony cut the line, chuckling into Steve’s shoulder. The blonde just sighed, patting Tony on the back.
“Oh?” Steve replied, waggling his brows in interest, all the while smiling like crazy. “What do you have in mind, baby?”
In the penthouse of Avengers Tower, Tony sat on his big couch, looking at the gift bag Steve had given him earlier. He had not opened it yet, and he felt a strange nervousness in his gut as he slowly took out the wrapped object. Tony was a bit flabbergasted by Steve's gesture, and he ignored the giddiness he had when the man came down to his lab. Steve never came down there, and thought they were cordial, the brunette constantly felt a yearning to be closer to the blonde. It confused Tony, though a part of him was thrilled. When he saw Steve enter earlier that day, and they made eye contact, that tingling in his shoulder strengthened, but he didn't itch at it, not wanting Bruce or Steve to notice.
“That will be all, Ms. Potts,” he remarked, giving a small, forced, closed-mouthed smile. He stepped away from the curb as Pepper’s car window went up, Happy slowly pulling onto the road.
Steve stroked himself with a snug fist, spreading the flowing precome around his shaft. “Mmm, you taste so good, love,” he heard Tony say before feeling the man’s lithe tongue work its way deep into Steve’s body. Envisioning Tony back there was such an obscene image that Steve felt the coil in his belly about to burst. “I love how red your skin gets when I play with it for a long time,” Tony added. With each stroke of his hand, and with Tony’s dirty talk and sensational tongue, Steve moaned loudly, sounding extremely desperate with each ticking of the clock.
Tony turned when his drink was ready, taking a sip as he went to look for Rhodey, only to get snagged up by some guy he apparently met before. Tony put on his own signature fake smile, hearing the obnoxious man, though he wasn’t really listening to him. He nodded when needed, and sipped at his scotch as he looked around the crowd for his friend. It was then that Tony’s eyes settled upon a blonde head of hair and an Eisenhower jacket with matching pants. There was probably only one man who would be sporting a World War Two army uniform at this place, and Tony felt his heart speed up when the man turned to reveal that he was indeed Steve. What was Steve doing here? Tony figured that was a dumb question. It was a military gala after all. Either way, Tony wanted to talk to the man. Maybe he could flat out tell Steve his feelings for him now. At least if the confession didn’t go over well, Steve couldn’t lash out because it was a public setting.
It was about an hour later, when Tony had made progress with some of the underside rust, that he heard J.A.R.V.I.S call him, though he couldn’t hear the A.I. from where he was under the body of the car.
“Your healing capabilities are rather extraordinary, Steve,” Tony said with a grin, his gaze moving from the merman’s magnetic blue eyes, down to his pink lips and strong chin...
“So much for managing an oil change,” Tony breathed, wiping a laughter tear away from the corner of his eye.
“Can’t take me anywhere,” Steve remarked as he pulled Tony closer, his hands finding the buckle of his boyfriend’s belt. The brunette helped him along, sliding both trousers and boxers off, his aching cock freed from the cage of fabric.
“I’m holding you to it,” Tony replied with a salacious smile. And Steve, the adorable man that he was, waved to Tony before the elevator doors closed. Tony swore he kept finding new ways to fall in love with Steve every single day.
But Steve knew that he was the one and only person Tony came home to, the one Tony loved fully. Steve was the man who got to wake up in Tony’s arms, was the one to console Tony when his nightmares were too loud to sleep. He was who Tony made love to, where they were simply Steve and Tony, two men with so much love to give one another.
,” Tony huffed, his eyes jerking open, staring at Steve wide eyed while the blonde continued to ride him, just the way the brunette wanted him to. Tony began to buck his hips, lurching into Steve with that same driven passion. The blonde sighed, allowing his head to fall back as he felt everything anew, the pain ripe from being over sensitive. His swelling erection slapped against his belly, sprinkling his abs with more glistening precome, mixing with his dried release from earlier.
To most people, that probably was nothing. But to Steve, that was a significant amount of time. He hadn’t really been with anyone that long. Even with Peggy, they had tiptoed around their feelings for so long that the only thing that established their relationship was that cherished kiss she gave him before he leapt onto Red Skull’s plane.
“So needy, Stevie,” Tony breathed, licking at random patches of taut skin on the blonde’s shoulders and neck. Steve felt the man’s fingers slip beneath the garment, the brunette’s short nails digging into the plush, firm flesh of Steve’s ass.
Tony was captivated every time Steve came, watching the man as his mouth parted into that perfect O, eyebrows furrowed up and long lashes resting against his cheekbones. The feeling that engulfed Tony, that seeped through the lust and sex, was love. Steve was his…and he was Steve’s.
Out of all the things Tony figured Steve would want to do, fishing didn’t even make the top 20 list. Art or history museum? Sure. A baseball game? Absolutely. But fishing seemed like it came out of nowhere. Since when did Steve like to fish? Were there any places to fish in Brooklyn? Did he have time to fish while in the war? Tony had questions.
“Well, no,” Steve started. “But since our date got interrupted because of this mission, I didn’t feel like changing,” he admitted.
“Are you kidding?” Tony said, laughing lightly. “I love when you are so compliant in my arms, beloved. You can be so uptight, especially right after a mission,” Tony explained. “I like how you let your walls down, trusting me with all your heart.” Tony then pressed a tender kiss to Steve’s brow, a hand splayed on the man’s lower belly.
“Beautiful, as always,” Tony muttered into Steve’s hair, his thrusts slowing as he removed his finger from his love.
Without a second thought, Steve raced through the water, his tail moving rapidly, the translucent scales catching in the light of the sun as he neared the surface. Steve breached the surface of the salty sea, quickly surveying the ship. He looked for the same insignia he had seen the day Bucky was captured, but the merman saw nothing but the name “Stark” painted on the haul of the boat. Steve swam under the ship to the other side, looking for any identifying marker, only for a large net to be cast upon him, he yelled and struggled to get the water-logged rope off of him. The weight of the twine dragged him under the water, entangling his arms and tail. Small fish were caught within the netting as well, and the merman did all that he could to help free his little friends, helping them shimmy through the square holes of the woven net. By the time he freed the last fish, the net was raised, and Steve was hoisted up from the water and dropped upon the dark deck of the ship.
“I guess we are both full of surprises today,” Steve snickered, leaning in and giving Tony a sweet kiss to his lips.
“Wanna talk about it?” Tony finally asked, looking to Steve, entrapping the super soldier’s gaze. Steve only sighed, looking back up at the sky.
“To-hohony!” Steve giggled, retracting his foot. Tony chuckled too, crawling back up to his boyfriend, his hands caressing up his body as he went. Steve sighed at the man’s touch, his breath catching when Tony’s tongue rasped against the pink bud of a nipple. “O-oh,” Steve moaned sweetly, closing his eyes as he threaded his fingers into his lover’s hair. The wet warmth of Tony’s mouth sent pleasant shivers up Steve’s spine, the scratch of the genius’s dark facial hair an exquisite sensation. Steve never knew how amazingly sensitive his nipples were, but God, he didn’t want Tony to stop.
“No, I haven’t. But what does it matter, Nat? Tony’s a socialite. He could meet up with her anywhere. It’s probably under wraps because he doesn’t want to be public about it yet,” Steve explained, the irritation surfacing in his voice. “It’s just getting harder and harder to contain my feelings for him.” Steve sighed, slumping his face into his hands as the redhead patted his shoulder.
“Nor will my love ever ebb for you, Tony,” Steve assured him, and Tony smiled brightly at that, giving one last kiss to Steve’s hair before he laid back on the bed. The super soldier turned to lay his head on Tony’s shoulder, his uncovered leg hooking over Tony’s covered ones.
Hovering over the man’s thick length, Steve gently blew on it, his breath warm against the slightly cool chocolate that mixed with bubbling white precome at the slit of the head. Steve took Tony in his mouth then, relishing in the chocolate flavor that mixed with the man’s salty precome. The brunette sighed at the feeling of his beloved’s warm tongue. He watched Steve’s pink lips stretch around his girth, letting out a low groan, head falling back against the cushions.
He pulled away from Steve’s bum then, looking at the dark red bite mark on the one cheek as well as the hickey on the other. They’d be there for a short while. But knowing he was the only one who got to mark Steve this way made Tony feel celestial.
The day was supposed to be out of this world. They were hosting a large Avenger party that night, filled with fun and excitement, the energy vibrating. Tony was all too eager to socialize and be with his close friends.
“Steve, can you come sit with me a moment,” Tony asked, brushing his hands over Steve’s bare shoulders lovingly.
“I think I’m falling for Steve,” he confessed with a sigh, before there was a spray of Rhodey’s soft drink in his face.
“It’s all right now,” the inventor cooed, his eyes bright and comforting as the merman wriggled beneath the rope. “I promise, I will not harm you,” Tony said, smiling kindly. The merman seemed to understand him, or at least he understood his tone and demeanor. The blonde sea creature’s shoulders relaxed and he slowed his swishing tail. The brunette grinned sweetly, his chocolate brown eyes swimming with reassurance as the merman’s blue eyes emanated the trust he began to feel towards Tony.
Tony eyed him a moment, smirking. “That’s a generous offer, but what would I owe ya for that cup of coffee?” He asked, reaching for the steaming mug of liquid gold, only to have Steve move it out of his boyfriend’s grasp.
The museum hosted primarily art history, much to the blonde's pleasant surprise. A few side exhibits were on other themed artifacts, but Steve was immediately drawn to the pre-historic art of the Neolithic era. He stood in awe of the cave drawing prints and what their interpretation was. Sam and Nat went ahead of him, Sam more interested in the Impressionist room. Natasha went to ask a few questions to the docent in the next room which held Ancient Egyptian, Minoan and Greek art.
“Well, you know Pepper is always right,” Rhodey said lightly, and Tony huffed a laugh. “Is Steve someone you’d like to, you know, date?” Tony nodded, looking at him with a pout. “Well then, ask him on a date.”
“Still, I’m not gonna lie, Steve. You having an exhibition streak in you was something I did not expect.”
The early spring air was crisp, though the sun’s rays were warm upon Steve’s skin as he made his way back to Avenger’s Tower. It was a beautiful day for a run. And though he had been told multiple times by Fury that he was better off staying out of the public eye as much as possible, Steve couldn’t help but to appreciate the outside world from time to time.
Steve was only a little overwhelmed when Tony settled in his lap, staring at the blonde with a possessive gaze. Tony leaned in to kiss Steve on his temple before reaching a hand up to settle on Steve’s chest.
With his mouth parted in astonishment, Steve circled the room, taking in all the different supplies that peppered the space. A multitude of pre-stretched canvases were in one corner of the room, along with all the supplies needed to stretch canvas oneself. Steve then found himself looking at a glass case that held hundreds of paints, all categorized by color and paint type. The super soldier saw the row filled with oil paints, a medium he had been wanting to try out for a long time. Next to that were an assortment of paint brushes, palette knives, sponges and painter’s palettes. Steve fingered the tan soft bristles of one of the brushes, the texture like silk. In the center of the room was an angled table with drawers along the side. Shuffling through the drawers, Steve found sketchbooks upon sketchbooks of different kinds of paper, from tanned sheets to textured watercolor paper. And in the front drawer laid drawing pencils, charcoals and pastels ready to be used.
“You’re obviously gonna dump me,” the brunette said, exasperated, as if it was obvious what Steve was trying to do by video chatting out of the blue.
It was only about ten minutes later that Steve heard Tony’s breathing slow, soft noises escaping his parted lips. What a comfort that sound was, a sound the blonde had truly missed during that week away.
Stepping inside, Steve felt his mouth drop. It was the fanciest lobby he had ever been to in Brooklyn. He couldn’t imagine what the apartments themselves looked like. Steve pondered if this was Tony’s not so subtle hint that Steve needed to get out of the Tower and find a new place to live permanently. The genius knew that he was indeed looking for a place to stay at once and a while.
“However long I’ve been avoiding people,” Tony remarked walking over to an armchair and falling into it defeated. “I guess she’s felt it for a while, a disconnect or whatever.” There was no way in hell, that Tony would say it was because Pepper thought he had the hots for Steve.
Steve looked at them in the mirror, Steve a few inches taller than Tony, his skin a few shades paler than his love, their eyes and hair stark contrasts. They looked so perfect together, a lovely balance. Steve also thought about Tony taking control, and how much Steve loved it. He never knew how much he would want to see how ravaged he looked when Tony made love to him.
“So what else is making you so unfocused?” The other man inquired, taking a sip of his pop. And Tony didn’t really want to talk about his ludicrous feelings for Steve. But maybe if he had someone to talk to and sort it out, things would make more sense.
The genius spread the cheeks of the super soldier’s rump, pulling away slightly to bite the textured skin of an inner cheek, igniting a low groan from the other man. “How ya doing over there, babe?” Tony muttered against Steve’s skin, dragging the dull nails of his fingers down Steve’s behind and to an upper thigh, little puckered lines surfacing.
“Anyways, thank you, Bruce,” The genius said with gratitude, holding up his hand and smiling before exiting the room. Tony felt a sense of uneasiness about so many things. This Hydra Company, Obie, the merman... Tony needed to make sure everything was all right and so he set off to find Obadiah to clarify everything.
“Well I’m glad you do, because I thought, maybe we could hang out and make up for lost time? I mean, I did spend a long time wallowing in my lab,” Tony joked. “Do you have some free time coming up?” He saw Steve ponder a moment before straightening his posture once more.
“Love you too, Steve,” Tony replied, dragging a thumb along the super soldier’s bottom lip before taking his hand in his and walking them toward his penthouse.
“You’ll always have me,” Steve remarked, kissing the top of Tony’s head. “And I’m never letting you go, either. Not in this life, or the next.” Tony hummed against his skin, kissing a pectoral before picking his head up to look at Steve. “Also, I think we need a shower,” Steve added, laughing lightly.
Grabbing the intimate toy then, the brunette dabbed a bit of lube on the tiniest bead until it glistened; being thorough wasn’t a bad thing he thought. “I’m gonna put the first bead in now,” Tony whispered, looking to Steve, who nodded in understanding. Carefully, Tony guided that first bead in, the lubed little ball slipping easily inside the blonde man. Steve didn’t really seem to react to the sensation, which, the genius figured was because there was no friction going on just yet.
Steve always had an eye for texture, and the look of silken fabrics were his favorite texture to draw. He loved how they shined in the light and molded beautifully to the human figure. He couldn’t deny how much he loved the feel of it on his skin, how he looked in the lingerie. Now he would see if Tony liked him in it just as much.
“What is it?” She asked softly, drifting one slender finger under Tony’s chin before gently raising his head until his chestnut eyes met her blue ones. She smiled sweetly, reassuringly. It was a smile that Tony was once rather familiar with, once reserved only for him.
With Steve making all the beautiful noises above him, Tony went back to work, licking a stripe with the flat of his tongue over the blonde’s opening, holding it there a moment.
Art by reticentannie...aka me on tumblr. Basically, I drew this and then was inspired to write this fic XD
“What?” Steve breathed, feeling self-conscious, his cheeks tinting in a blush while he brushed a hand though his hair. Tony rose his brows and looked pointedly at Steve’s hands, which were free from their bindings.
Tony didn’t take his eyes away from Steve looking at himself in the mirror. The blonde’s bright eyes were wide with intrigue as he looked over himself, almost surprised by how he was reacting to each touch. Tony wasn’t lying when he said Steve was the most gorgeous thing to watch as they had sex.
"What's the matter, Tony?" Bruce asked, taking off his glasses and eyeing Tony with a look of worry.
Steve had been out of the ice for a few days, and after a crash course of the last 70 years he had missed, he was placed into an apartment complex that was established by S.H.I.E.L.D.
“Quit your chatter and bring on the grub,” Clint grumbled as he slowly made his way to the island, pulling out a stool and plopping down on it tiredly.
“No no, it’s good. We will manage,” Tony remarked, handing the man at the counter his card. “Everything is to go on that. Don’t let him try giving you his card,” Tony said, pointing his thumb back at Steve.
“Y-yes, Tony,” the blonde finally replied, his one hand sliding up his abdomen to pluck at a sensitively pert nipple, the other hand reaching to his engorged penis.
But he found his belonging when Tony strolled into his life, a man of the future, always seeing the possibilities. So many things could have kept them apart. Steve could have landed Red Skull’s plane safely, seeing them win the war and starting a no doubt wonderful life with Peggy. Or Tony could have never made it out of those caves in the Middle East, the shrapnel eating right through his heart. The genius could have been killed before his escape, never becoming Iron Man.
“You’re gonna get into trouble with him if you keep busting his chops like that,” Steve said, kissing Tony’s hair.
Pressing a kiss to the side of Steve’s neck, Tony made his way back behind Steve, hands tracing over the outlines of the blonde’s chiseled, immaculate body. “No more thoughts about those meetings. It’s just you and me now,” the genius whispered, his warm breath ghosting against the blonde’s neck. Steve gave a nod and smile, looking over his shoulder at his beloved. That beautiful, innocent yet mischievous look from his lover made Tony’s breath catch, his heart pounding and fluttering all at once.
Eventually, that temporary contentment vanished as the corruption of humanity brought out the worst in S.H.I.E.L.D the parasitic legion of Hydra uprooting the holistic mission of the original S.H.I.E.L.D. Steve found himself once again without a place to call home.
“Let me show you just how thankful I am for you,” Steve whispered, his breath a faint puff against Tony’s mouth. Tony’s own breath was a soft sigh, and he closed his eyes, the perfect invitation for Steve to close the small space between them and press his lips to his lover’s.
“What’s the status, J?” Tony called out as he straightened the two wine glasses that were placed next to a chilled bottle of wine.
Tony didn’t say anything, his shocked expression speaking volumes as it was. The doors opened to Steve’s quarters then, and he exited the elevator, turning to look at the brunette one more time.
“Dammit, Clint! What’d you do?!” she yelled, followed by a roar from a raging Hulk. Steve and Tony sprang to their feet, running to the rest of their teammates to try and get a green and angry Bruce into the tower where the
“That’s not true. They were gonna die, Tony. Our strategic plan was null and void at that point. Plus, we just about had the creature down for the count. It barely had any strength left.
Tony’s eyes were wide, filled with longing as he cupped Steve’s cheek with a hand, brushing his fingers in the short hairs at the base of his neck. “I love you too, Steve. So damn much,” Tony said softly, causing Steve’s chest to swell with an incredible joy. Steve moved his hands up to slowly slip Tony’s shirt over his taut shoulders, revealing tawny skin and a muscular frame. Steve may have been stronger than the man, but that didn’t mean the brunette was weak by any means. Tony was fit from working in his lab, and training in his mixed martial arts. Listening to Tony’s soft breathing, Steve used the pads of his fingers to caress the man’s skin, feeling out the dips and curves of his biceps and triceps, down to his forearms. And then there were Tony’s hands, calloused and rough, masculine. Steve traced his fingers over Tony’s before bringing he man’s hand up to his lips, kissing his knuckles, fingertips and palm. Gently he took the brunette’s wrists and guided them back to his waist, smiling at him with a warm affection.
It was then that Steve, pressed his wet tongue against Tony’s opening, the brunette’s body tensing. “This alright?” Steve asked, his breath warm and soft on Tony’s hole. He wouldn’t continue if the man wasn’t okay with it.
The brunette waltzed up to Steve, closing the distance quickly. He handed Steve the bookmark, their fingertips brushing as the super soldier took it. That touch made Steve immediately grab at his mark on his shoulder, and he noticed Tony flinch too, the man twisting his face up in what seemed like pain.
Steve looked down at his chest as he brought his other hand up to massage both nipples at the same time. Tony could see the precome on Steve’s fingers smear one of the pebbled peaks as he massaged the flesh, glistening in the lamp light. It was so dirty, so unlike Steve and so fucking hot. The blonde worked both nipples with his fingers, swirling them in quick circular motions before teasing the underside of his pecs. Steve tried holding back a moan, failing completely as he ran his palms up and down his nipples, the feather light touch probably just enough to keep him on edge.
The super soldier snickered into the genius’s mouth, moving his ass forward more, being a terrible tease as he made it so that his rump was just out of reach of Tony’s cock. He nibbled at Tony’s bottom lip, pulling at it between his teeth.
Tony plunged his fingers as far as they could go into his love, exploring to find that wonderful bundle of nerves of Steve’s prostate. His other hand slid along the man’s nightie, slipping under the neckline of the lingerie and caressing the thick, firm muscles of Steve’s chest. Those extra touches only added fuel to the sensuous fire that consumed the blonde’s body.
“No,” Steve said. “I’m good now. Let’s try again.” Steve pushed his ass down, searching for Tony’s fingers once more. Tony got the message, and he massaged at Steve’s rim tenderly, the muscle much more pliant now. Steve felt the man’s calloused finger slowly slip inside him, the burn from the stretch unquestionable. It was uncomfortable at first, Steve wasn’t going to deny that. But as Tony gently pushed and pulled his digit in and out of him, soon enough Steve’s hole began to flutter loose, the friction lessening. Tony added a second finger, the stretch even more intense than before. The pain had subsided though, the drag of his boyfriend’s fingers in his channel a pleasant spark that flashed through his veins. He wanted more of that, and when Tony slid a third finger into his body, the super soldier out right moaned at the pleasure, his brows knitting up as he continued to look at Tony, who’s gaze would move from Steve’s eyes to his entrance, focusing on the task of prepping him.
Steve didn’t say a word, but instead turned his head to quickly find Tony’s mouth. He meshed his lips with the brunette’s, sighing sweetly and feeling a plethora of emotions. There was a kind of relief Steve felt in his heart as Tony kissed him back fondly, his masculine hands gliding up Steve’s belly and chest before descending once more. The blonde pulled away then, his heavy-lidded gaze flicking from Tony’s lips and to his gold flecked brown eyes.
“It’s okay, go ahead,” Tony said with a close mouthed smile. And so, Steve did, his other hand coming up to cup around the metal casing that held the reactor in place. The metal rim was somehow cool to the touch, the arc reactor faintly warm. Steve never paid much attention to this circular reactor, but knowing it was what kept his love alive, made Steve think that it was the most precious thing. Leaning in, Steve pressed a quick kiss to the face of the reactor before trailing open mouthed kisses up his boyfriend’s neck and under his chiseled jaw. He felt Tony’s breath quicken, a soft moan escaping him when Steve’s teeth scraped against his dark cropped beard.
“I miss you too, love,” Tony replied, eyes sad. “Two more days of these damn meetings and we’ll make up for lost time huh?” There was a hint of mischief in his eyes when he said that, winking at Steve who beamed back at Tony, cheeks flushing a deep crimson.
“No you didn’t,” Tony remarked, still glaring daggers at the blonde. Steve turned his body away from Tony then, hitting the button so that the elevator would continue its ascension to his floor. “So you’re gonna ignore me now?” Tony asked bitterly.
That was all Steve needed to hear before delving in and slipping his tongue over Tony’s hole once more. Closing his eyes, Steve focused on the feeling of Tony’s body, the smooth tight ring of muscle that clenched with each passing swipe of his tongue. Tony’s groans and sultry sighs could have pushed Steve over edge, but he knew that they both deserved to make it to the best part of it all. So, with as much mental strength he could muster, Steve pushed his throbbing needs aside and thrusted his tongue in against his beloved’s opening, the rim starting to loosen to his persistence.
But the fates, or whoever it was, apparently enjoyed torturing him. Because when Tony had been sleeping in the same spot for too long, and he groggily tried to turn over, it was then that he felt a warmth along the one side of his body. Tony opened his eyes, looking down to see Steve, his head resting partially on Tony’s chest, fast asleep. He was at first confused, because Steve was originally sleeping on the couch. But Tony remembered how he made it perfectly clear that Steve was more than welcome to sleep in the bed as well. Tony assumed that the bed might help the soldier sleep more soundly.
Steve reeled the pole back behind him slowly, holding down the button at the base. He cast then, only for the line to fall barely two feet in front of him, water splashing all over his waders and chest.
Tony dragged his nose and lips across Steve’s chest, lapping at the other pebbled peak of flesh while he teased Steve, his fingers slipping between the cleft of the man’s ass, feeling the strap of the thong and gently rubbing it against Steve’s tight entrance. He could feel his boyfriend writhing underneath his touch, wanting more but also not wanting to get too close to the edge so soon. So, Steve pressed a hand in between them and stroked Tony’s erection through his boxers, causing the genius to gasp and rock his hips forward.
Heading down the hallway towards Tony’s bedroom, a bedroom Steve spent most nights in, the super soldier found another post it. This one reading ‘Just a little further.” Steve felt anticipation bubbling within him as he picked up sweet crunchy candies that trailed to his boyfriend’s bedroom.
Greeting the workers in the lobby, Steve took the private elevator up to the penthouse where Tony was supposed to be. Yet, when he arrived, he didn’t find Tony, but a trail of foil covered chocolate eggs. It was the Saturday before Easter, and though Tony wasn’t an advocate of religious holidays, Steve was. So, with a lot of enticing, Tony had agreed to Steve’s proposition of at least exchanging Easter baskets this year.
He brushed a hand through Tony’s dark, satiny hair, as he admired the small laugh lines that formed around the brunette’s glistening eyes as he smiled sweetly. “Will you accept this art studio and apartment, then?” Tony whispered, his voice dulcet. “Come here whenever your creative juices are flowing, or you need to get away. You really deserve this.” Tony took a step back, walking over to the nook area where a lush blue couch sat next to a mini fridge and coffee station. “And if you need a coffee break, you can put your feet up and relax,” the genius offered. “I thought that maybe I could come and even visit while you work sometimes, turn the tables for once,” Tony laughed.
“Someone’s a bit assertive today,” Tony hummed, leaning in to kiss Steve’s temple.  “Missing all of my undivided attention I give you?” the brunette teased.
“Why not? If you’re falling for the guy, you’re not gonna get anywhere with you being a love sick puppy,” Rhodey remarked, leaning his elbows on the table.
“I only wish to give you all that you deserve,” Tony admitted and Steve could detect a hint of sorrow in the man’s voice. Steve knew Tony struggled with the fear of never being good enough. It made Steve’s heart ache knowing it was because of Tony’s childhood mostly that scarred him so heavily. Steve dragged a thumb across the pink pillow of Tony’s bottom lip, the brunette closing his eyes at the affectionate touch.
“Keep doing that,” Steve said, biting his lip, delighting in the man’s hands playing with him. Tony happily obliged, using a hint of his short fingernails as he drifted his hands up and down his love’s ass. It was hard to focus on anything with Steve’s hand still wrapped around him, his thumb teasing his leaking head. Tony was trying his best though. He was pretty sure he deserved an award.
“Mhmm. Peggy Carter is my aunt,” Sharon explained, releasing her hand from his. Steve could see it then, the resemblance. They had the same earnest brown eyes, filled with determination. It took him a moment to say anything, as the past flooded through his memory, like it so often did.
“Your mother would be proud to see what you’ve grown to be, a better man than most. Even better than Ferris and Brian.”
“Well you wouldn’t be wrong,” Tony admitted with an easy smile before he looked into the bag he held and spotted that damn fisherman’s hat tucked in the side of the bag. He frowned at Steve who was still looking at Jerry. He must have felt the brunette’s stare though, because Tony saw the side of his mouth curve into a knowing smirk.
Soon Tony was a bit mindless as he fucked his lover raw, the pent-up anticipation all week and this evening spilling forth. The lounge bed rocked and squeaked as it hit the side of the dome structure, the stringed white lights above them swaying, their light fluttering over the spread of the brunette’s back and behind.
“You gonna prove me wrong?” He asked, looking at Tony who had followed him up the bed to kneel between Steve’s open legs. Tony admired how the man’s leaking head peaked over the waistband of the panties. Lifting one of his love’s legs, Tony placed kissed along the inside flesh from knee to inner thigh, hearing Steve hum in enjoyment.
“Tony,” Steve said breathlessly, his head falling forward as he tried to stave off the pent-up anticipation that consumed him.
The workshop was quiet. No loud music filled the room, just the faint whirring of DUM-E as he maneuvered around the random mechanisms and armor that littered the floor space.
“Good night, Steve,” the brunette remarked, his hand resting on Steve’s shoulder, the other hand resting above his head.
“God,” Tony breathed, trying to get a reign on himself, the tight heat of Steve’s body overwhelmingly electrifying. “You feel so good, Steve. Never felt anything quite like this,” he said honestly, and Steve felt a bubble of pride rise inside him, knowing Tony was enjoying this just as much as him.
The inventor quelled those unwanted, deviant observations before reaching the chamber that held the merman. Tony placed a hand on the brass handle, took a breath and opened the door.
They had spent the day together, Tony taking Steve out to his favorite restaurant in New York, followed by taking a private tour of one of the many museums peppering The City That Never Sleeps. So now it was Steve’s turn to surprise Tony, who was waiting in their bedroom while Steve cleaned himself up a little after being out and about.
Steve looked down to see Tony’s tight fist around his penis, and when he bit into his behind, Steve’s body hummed with lust. Tony kept stroking him, nipping at his other ass cheek before moving the panties down to his ankles. Steve bucked his hips into Tony’s fist only to pull back and be met with Tony’s tongue licking up the fissure of his rump. Steve’s knees bowed out from the sudden pleasure of it. Thankfully he was near the bed, and he caught himself as well as Tony grabbing a hold of his hips.
So, Steve gratefully accepted. Though the men made amends after Loki was taken back to Asgard a year or so ago, Steve felt that they would be able to start  things anew. Oddly enough their given personalities were a balance, and they tended to mellow the other out when the moment permitted. Yes, they didn't always see eye to eye, but instead of getting into a heady argument, they talked things through, and eventually came to an agreement. For the most part anyways. Steve was at peace with the fact they were on decent terms, and he even found himself becoming more fond of Tony, the man's characteristics that once made Steve irritated, actually made Steve appreciate the brunette a little bit more.
“Alright,” Steve said, burrowing into the soft cotton fabric. I’ll be sure not to wake you when I come in,” he added before watching the genius enter the house quietly, so not to wake the other guests.
“I understand,” Steve responded, his breathing labored from being out of water for such a long time. The merman glared up at the human, his blue eyes hard and unrelenting.
"It started out as nothing more than a casual warm itch. But now if I am in the same vicinity as Cap, it pulses and burns," Tony explained, dropping his hand away. "I can't stop thinking about the man, and the wanting of being close to him. The man gave me a hard on just because I thought of his body and muscles, Bruce," Tony rolled his eyes at the whole situation. Bruce chuckled lightly. "It just seems like I should have a choice in all this," Tony murmured.
They took a few breaths together, steadying themselves. Tony moved back then, pressing a little kiss to Steve’s nose. “I truly do love you,” he said, sitting back and nudging himself between Steve’s legs once more. He used the hand that wasn’t coated in lube to spread the blonde’s legs, pushing his one knee to his chest. “Can you hold your leg up for me, babe?” Tony asked, and Steve hooked an arm around his knee, keeping it up so that he remained wide open for the brunette.
“You’re killing me, Steve,” Tony breathed, and the super solider giggled, still teasing at that sweet spot of the brunette’s. He kissed it and suckled at the skin, creating an intense suction. He could hear Tony let out a whimper, his fingers trailing down the flowing chiffon fabric that made up the bodice of the nightie, and slipping his hand underneath. He could feel his lover’s dull nails dig into the muscles of his back, and it only encouraged Steve on, giving a small nip to the purpled flesh before pulling away to admire the love mark.
“That’s very true,” Steve replied, looking for his shield and reaching down to get it. Tony, being a respectable boyfriend, stared at the man’s ass when he bent to grab it. He couldn’t help it, Steve had a nice bum. What he noticed though, was a tear in his uniform, revealing a silky light blue fabric underneath.
When Steve headed down to Tony's lab, that spot on Steve's shoulder tingled, and the blonde pawed at it absent mindedly. He asked J.A.R.V.I.S if he could go inside the lab, and the A.I. announced his entrance. Tony was chatting with Bruce as Steve walked in, smiling a little sheepishly at the men.
They made their way into the water shortly after, waders hiked up to their waists as they positioned themselves. The water was so clear that Tony could see the multicolored slabs of rock underneath. All that surrounded him were autumnal trees, clear skies, birds chirping, and Steve. Tony watched him a moment, amused at seeing the super soldier wearing red plaid, waders and that absurd fisherman’s hat.
shall we do about this?” The super soldier asked, winking up at his beloved before leaning down, dragging his teeth over the edges of Tony’s covered length.
“Eh, it’s not too bad,” Steve responded with a shrug before breaking out into a wide smile. His expression turned serious then, emotion seen clearly in his blue eyes. “Just being with you, Tony would have been wonderful, and I’d have been so happy,” the blonde admitted, turning over so he could see his beloved more properly. He wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist and held the brunette close to his chest.
After the initial high of being one with the sky had died down, Tony felt the pleasant hum of adrenaline roil through his veins while he languidly flew around the city. It was then that his mind fell to Pepper, and how she fit into his life differently now, like an altered puzzle piece. He wondered how she was, he figured she was back from her trip to Japan by now. He missed her. Even though he was used to not seeing her, when he’d be gone on Avenger missions, or when she was back in California doing work at Stark Industries. Circling South, he made his way to Pepper’s new apartment, calling her as he neared.
Continuing his journey down over his boyfriend’s front, the genius brought one finger over Steve’s erect penis, the head leaking white precome which soaked through the green, floral designed lace of his lingerie undies.
They kissed messily, Steve tugging at the back of Tony’s damp hair, their orgasms upon them. Steve’s head fell against Tony’s shoulder, and he kneaded his teeth into it, his body on the right side of pain from being overstimulated. He wanted this though, wanted Tony to take all that he could of the blonde, pounding into Steve diligently, ravaging his loose, wet hole and claiming the man as Tony’s. The noises leaving Steve were spent sex sounds, his voice wrecked, body limp.
“Oh,” Steve said, looking down and picking up the forgotten kernels. Tony’s eyes might have been fooling him in the dark living room, but there looked to be a tint on Steve’s cheeks as well as a look of disappointment. He caught Natasha looking at them, a small smirk on her lips, an eyebrow arched. Tony just looked at her briefly, attempting to act casual. But on the inside, his heart was pounding, as the subdued revelation of his romantic feelings for Steve dropped in his lap like a metal weight.
“Mhmm,” Steve replied, leaning into the brunette’s space and nuzzling against him. “Apparently, it’s wonderful foreplay…feels like a massage,” he explained, pressing a whisper of a kiss along the side of the genius’s neck before sitting back once again.
“Well, this is quite the turn of events,” Tony said, a box with plastic gloves spilling from the top nudged against his face.
Steve took his eyes off his surroundings briefly to graze his palm over the mossy algae that had grown over the protruding rock. Waves had crashed and sloshed upon the stone for thousands of years, the merman thought, and yet life had still found a way upon it.
Once everyone had their appropriate gifts, the Avengers sat in the lounge area, unhurriedly opening their presents as the warmth of the holiday pulsed within the room like a slow, sweet caramel sauce.
“Mmm, Captain, a little anxious aren’t we? I do have that effect on a lot of people though,” Tony said, reaching to Steve’s front to stroke the super soldier’s growing erection. Steve just rolled his eyes and smirked, shimmying out of Tony’s enticing grasp.
“Oh my,” Steve said, his voice raspy as he pulsed his hips forward, eager for his boyfriend’s touches.
Something had stirred within Tony the night he and Steve shared that bedroom. He didn’t mean to react the way he did, when Steve had walked out of the bathroom in just a towel. In Tony’s defense, anybody would be caught off guard if someone was practically nude and sauntering by. Seriously, that white towel was tiny, the owners of that B and B should really consider getting larger ones.
“Huh?” Tony answered ever so intelligently, scrubbing a hand at his face and refocusing. “Sorry, I was, thinking about where I had placed my oil can…” Tony lied, turning away from the man, needing to not look at his face, or immaculate body. Tony seriously needed to get a grip on himself, or he was going to be doomed.
“I-I wanna,” he started, adjusting himself as he tried to bend his body so that he could see better. “Wanna see…” he trailed off, eyes wild with curiosity as he looked to Tony. “Wanna see what you’re seeing.”
“You’re a mess, Cap. Someone’s gotta clean you up,” Tony said off the cuff, pointing to the other puffed up corn pieces that littered Steve’s lap.
But as time progressed, population grew and civilization advanced, the once burning and passionate idea of soulmates dwindled to a low glowing ember, the thought almost neglected since it was such a rarity for people to find their soulmate in the modern world. It was but a childish dream, a fairytale parents told their children at night.
“Central Park. It should be cold enough for the snow to stick. Plus, we are supposed to be getting a few inches tonight,” Tony said, heading for the dining room when he heard Clint yell that they wouldn’t be getting any cake. “C’mon, Cap, might as well get back into the fray.”
Stepping out of the shower, Steve swaddled a fluffy towel around his waist. He realized then, that he forgot the change of clothes he sat out on the desk in the bedroom. That wasn’t a big deal though, he and Tony have seen each other in their skivvies before, when changing after a mission and the like. As casually as he could, Steve walked out of the bathroom and past Tony on the couch to grab his clothing. He heard the brunette stop mid-sentence on the phone, and Steve turned to see the man staring at him, his cheeks red. Tony’s eyes rose to meet Steve’s, and he quickly looked away.
A week later, Steve was off to the makeshift, new S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters Fury had been slowly building after the one infiltrated by Hydra fell. He wanted to talk with Nick about recruiting Sam and Colonel James Rhodes to become Avenger teammates. Steve obviously had witnessed Sam’s fighting tactics as well as his honorable heart. He’d be a perfect addition as The Falcon. And Colonel Rhodes had experience as the Iron Patriot for years and was Tony’s right hand man. He clearly would be a remarkable choice.
Tony flipped thorough a few more channels until something caught his eye. The NEWS anchor spoke of some possible new discovery, and Tony read the banner beneath her frame that read
Sliding into the bed, Steve could feel himself immediately sink into the softest mattress ever. He had only slept in Tony’s bed once, when the brunette had an awful fever a few weeks back. Steve didn’t leave his boyfriend’s side, sleeping next to the man and being there for whenever Tony needed anything.
Tony was losing himself in the moment, Steve’s moans and sultry breaths a beautiful echo in his ears. He wasn’t able to keep it together much longer though, especially with Steve clenching so tightly around him. He bit at Steve’s shoulder as he refrained with every inch of control he had to not come yet. He was keening loudly though, his voice mixing with Steve’s own sounds as he reached a hand down to take hold of the blonde’s thick, heavy length. “Steve,” Tony bit out, breathing raggedly. He eyed the ravaged man, whose eyes were glazed over with lust as he watched them move as one body. “Steve, touch your chest while I stroke you,” Tony huffed, swirling his hips as he fucked the man, searching for his prostate.
ship. Shouldering his way through the crew members who were surrounding something, Tony reached the center, his eyes affixing upon the object of speculation. Tony’s brown eyes widened at the sight of a creature he’d only read in the fairytales as a child, his butler, Jarvis tucking him into bed every night with a story of fantastical creatures. This one before him was a creature from the sea, and Tony let out a sharp breath as the shock started to wane from his body.
Whoever Tony was talking to asked if he was alright, and Tony only coughed, evening out his voice. “I’m gonna have to call you back,” Tony managed to say, cutting the other person off mid-sentence when he hung up. He tossed his phone to the side, looking over at Steve and carding a hand through his blonde hair before laughing lightly.
He toured the aisles of the gift shop, which was smaller than the one in the Smith. Natasha had a few things picked out, Sam was eyeing up a print of a Renoir he had admired earlier in the museum. The super soldier saw a bookmark with a picture of a Grecian Statue, the man standing in contrapposto, his chest bare, his robes fashion to cover his nether regions. Steve felt drawn to it however, from both an artistic standpoint and the familiarity it brought him. The man reminded him of Antonius.
Tony smiled faintly, a hand reaching up to brush a snowflake from Steve’s cheek with his thumb. The man’s calloused digit was somehow tender against his warm, blushing skin. He saw Tony open his mouth to speak, only to be interrupted by Natasha scolding her fellow spy in the background.
“Of course, Captain.” Steve nodded as a way of thanks before slowly, and a bit dejectedly heading back upstairs to over analyze all that he’d done to cause Tony to avoid him like this.
“I-I-Wow,” Tony finally stuttered out, unconsciously liking his lips while his eyes skirted up and down Steve’s body, taking in the glistening muscles and silky lingerie. Steve smiled widely, sighing in relief. He turned around slowly, giving Tony the full 360 view before taking a few steps forward until his bare knees brushed against Tony’s clothed ones.
“This is my Christmas gift?” Steve asked incredulously. Tony nodded, rolling up the sleeves of his button down. “I-I can’t accept this, Tony,” he remarked, his voice leery. “It’s too much.” Steve straightened his own shirt, smoothing out the dark navy fabric and feeling fidgety with Tony’s piercing gaze on him.
“What? Sorry, I didn’t realize you hadn’t asked her out yet,” Tony said in defense, trying to ignore the fact that his and Steve’s chest were brushing against the other. He backed up a mere inch before his back hit a broom.
“I’ll look ‘em over,” Tony said, grabbing the paperwork from Steve’s hands, adding to Pepper’s file under his arm. He could barely look Steve in the eye, doing his best not to lash out at the man. His spat with Pepper had him on edge, and Steve didn’t need to get roped into that bullshit. “Thanks, Cap,” Tony murmured, allowing the elevator doors to close, heading up to his penthouse alone.
“Do you think people noticed?” Steve asked, And Tony wasn’t entirely sure what to say. It was a pretty big tear.
"Morning," the blonde breathed lightly, smiling boyishly. He and Tony ate together, chatting about Avenger business and everything in between. Tony suggested they take a trip somewhere too once Steve was feeling one hundred percent better.
“Well, don’t feel like you’ve got to win my friendship back, Tony. Because I never stopped being your friend,” Steve said, a quizzical expression on his face as he looked at the brunette.
“You’re perfect too, Tony,” Steve responded, kissing his boyfriend lightly, his lips like soft pillows. “You are,” he reiterated, smiling against the brunette’s mouth. “Everything about you. From this,” Steve tapped a finger at Tony’s temple. “To that,” and he reached his hand between them to touch the arc reactor. “You’re everything to me.” Steve needed the genius to know that, even if he had said it to the man in some way, shape or form before. Steve wanted Tony to be proud of himself, for remembering all that he had accomplished so far, and that he didn’t need Howard’s approval to do it.
“Am I such a tease?” Tony challenged, voice husky as he took hold of Steve’s sides and flipped them, Steve on his back as Tony loomed over him. Steve smirked, scooting himself up to the plush pillows at the head of the bed. He hiked his slip up till it draped right above his naval and spread his legs wide.
After settling into Avengers tower, Natasha, Sam and Steve had time on their hands since S.H.I.E.L.D fell. So, the three friends went to a museum in New York. It wasn’t huge like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but a quainter museum with less foot traffic. Steve was rather excited to browse the museum, Natasha said they had a wonderful art collection, and the super soldier missed his art history classes from school.
“I’m stubborn?” Steve said sharply, turning his head to look at Tony. He took a slow breath to ground himself. “I’m not the stubborn one who has too big of an ego to talk about what’s upsetting him,” Steve finally said, his voice obviously strained. “And I’m also not the one who has been ignoring everyone for over a month now, distancing himself from the people that care about him,” Steve added, unable to keep the hurt from his voice. He really didn’t want to confront Tony about how he’d been acting lately, but Steve couldn’t help it now, not when Tony thought he had the right to berate him for his actions.
As he drew Steve began to think back to the vision at the museum and the men, Stephanos and Antonius, and the super soldier decided to sketch them from his memory.
“What?” Tony responded, his brows puckered together. I’m seeing you…” Tony trailed off, not sure where Steve was going with this.
Later that evening, Steve browsed the internet for something as a gag gift for Tony, like Iron Man boxers or a lump of coal. Nothing really stood out to him though, and so, with a sigh, Steve shut off his computer and went to his dresser, searching for a lingerie panty to dress in once he had showered. Looking through the garments, feeling the delicate fabric under his fingertips, Steve had his epiphany, and he bit his lip at the naughty idea that flickered to light in his mind.
With a beer in hand, Steve settled next to the grand Christmas tree that was situated on the one side of the living room. A gentle snow had begun to fall outside, and Steve watched as the flakes caught the moonlight. It was so peaceful, a contrast to the warm, energetic atmosphere inside the tower.
“Will you both save it?” Clint whined, and Natasha nudged him. “Well it’s true, they are always at each other’s throats,” he added, putting away his bow and turning for the quinjet.
Turning to face the mirror then, Steve was overwhelmed with emotion, feeling so beautiful and so loved in that moment. Tony made him feel as if he was something precious, a treasure. And Steve would never understand how he had gotten so blessed to have Tony as his beloved.
Steve felt the bed dip slightly when Tony got in too, and the brunette tossed the covers over them, though Steve stuck a leg out. “I over heat easily,” he explained when Tony quirked a brow at him.
“Fuck, Steve. I’m gonna die here if you keep this up,” Tony about whimpered as he sat up, causing Steve to as well.
Tony followed him to a row of empty seats, though soon enough there wasn’t an open seat in view. “Good evening, everyone.” The blonde woman said, smiling cutely to the crowd. Tony merely rolled his eyes. Soon, the lady began her speech on Agent Margaret Carter. Tony’s jealousy didn’t dissipate, the green eyed monster stewed and roiled within his gut. Of course the woman was pretty and seemed nice enough, but she wasn’t Tony, so obviously she wasn’t good enough for Steve.
“Don’t get any ideas,” Steve warned, moving to stand, only for Tony to wrap his arms around his trim waist, holding him there.
“It’s important that you go, Tony. We want to get that program funded. And who better to smooth talk those elites and make ‘em feel good other than you?” Steve said, bopping Tony on the nose with his index finger.
“Me too, babe. Me too,” Tony said, his voice filled with bliss. He slowly pulled his finger free from Steve’s backside and wrapped his arms around the man’s broad back. “You aren’t the luckiest guy in the world,” Tony started, referring to Steve’s earlier statement. “
The super soldier slipped under the covers of his boyfriend’s vast bed, which seemed even larger without his beloved in it with him. Steve pouted, looking over at Tony’s side of the bed. Grabbing one of his love’s pillows, Steve cradled it into his chest, pressing his nose into the cool fabric and breathing deeply. He could detect a hint of Tony cologne in the pillow case, where the genius’s neck would rest. Steve could smell along with the cologne, a musky sandalwood from Tony’s hair after he’d shower and flop into bed after a long day’s work of meetings or inventing. And as almost as an afterthought, the blonde’s enhanced senses could recognize that slight tinge of swear left over from Tony’s skin, usually when the genius was suffering a nightmare that Steve had to help Tony out of. Tony would wake up with wild eyes, pupils dilated as sweat laced his skin and his body assumed flight or fight mode. Steve would hold Tony and whisper calmingly to him that all was alright, that the genius was safe in Steve’s arms.
“Tony?” Steve said, his voice gravelly. He tried to adjust himself, only to feel the genius still fully hard inside him. The brunette hissed at the movement, opening his eyes and pressing a whisper of a kiss to his love. “Wh-what’re you-” Steve started to ask, only to make a surprised noise when Tony pulled out of him quickly and flipped them so that the brunette was on his back and Steve was on top of him. Steve eyed the man quizzically, hands resting on Tony’s chest.
It was only a few minutes of tinkering with the metal plates of an Iron Man suit before Tony’s mind wandered to his teammates’ uniforms and all the ways he could enhance them. Natasha could use electric shocks for long distance. Clint always needed enhanced arrows as well as being able to carry more of them during missions. And Steve…Tony’s mind stuttered then. Dammit, the blonde made it into his brain yet again. Well, it was for safety and Avenger purposes, so it wasn’t a big deal.
“Here, allow me,” Tony began, hurrying over to take the drying cloths from the man’s gills and soaking them in the water filled bucket on Bruce’s work table. “Lean back for me, please,” Tony said, and Steve immediately consented, leaning back on his elbows. The brunette quickly went to work, dribbling the water over the creature’s gills. Almost instantly, Steve’s breathing became regular once more, his chest heaving with relief of his gills opening.
The men were sweating, their breaths mingling together as they panted and loved as one entity. Nothing but their pleasurable moans filled the air as they made love in Tony’s lab, a place closed off and far from everyone else. It was a place that was theirs, like a little sanctuary.
“What?” Tony was genuinely confused. “What are you talking about, Pepper? I’ve never been in a serious relationship before you, never loved anyone before you.”
Lowering his hand down over his thick penis and the curve of his testicles, Steve trailed his lubed up fingers down his perineum before settling on his hole. Tony watched as Steve’s index finger teased his entrance, the pink skin quivering as he massaged the rim. The brunette, transfixed by the sight began working his hand over his aching cock once more, the fingers of his other hand caressing his own opening.
“Idiot,” Tony huffed, his voice tinny as it filtered through the mask. He lowered them to the ground, holding Steve against his chest a few moments before releasing the blonde from his grasp.
What do you mean it has been almost a year since I updated this story?? *shifts awkwardly* I promise to update much  more frequently now that I have some more free time! I really love these two characters!
“It’s okay,” Tony managed to say, looking over at him as they laid side by side. Steve felt the cold wet snow starting to seep its way into his dark jeans, though it was moot as he smiled softly at Tony.
Steve finally dropped his hand, pulling Tony against him and kissing his ruby mouth. The super soldier licked at the seam of his love’s lips until he was accepted in, and he darted his tongue into Tony’s warm mouth, tasting his tongue and teeth.
Steve rode his love a little longer before he laid against Tony, a hand cupping his cheek as he kissed him hungrily. Tony let out a frustrated whine, thrusting shallowly into Steve then, unable to get deep inside him with how Steve was laying on him.
“Yeah, baby?” Tony said, stilling his hands. Steve took that time to regulate his breathing, trying to hold himself together.
“And I you,” he remarked, giving a soft kiss to Tony’s mouth. And Tony sighed in the unadulterated peace they shared.
“What did you say?” Steve asked weakly. His ears must have been deceiving him. Tony smirked, still cupping his chin.
Steve watched the man who had freed him as he was led away. The merman silently pleaded for the man to turn around and come back to him, for he was the only human who had shown him kindness.
fall out of love with you, Steve?” Tony asked, brown eyes big and revealing the hurt of Steve thinking he would find someone else. “Do you believe that kind of paparazzi garbage? Don’t you know me better than that?” Tony didn’t yell or sound mad as he pressed his lips to the blonde’s eyelids.
“Maybe if you were paying attention to Jerry instead of being on your phone, you’d know,” Steve said, walking along the creek bed toward Tony. Steve showed him then, handing the furnished pole back to the genius before walking back over to his own spot.
Thank you to all who have walked with me on this writing journey! I hope it was just as enjoyable to read as it was to write! <3
That was until Tony invited he, Natasha, Sam and Maria to Avengers tower, where the Avengers initiative finally took off. Steve considered going back to his little apartment back when he first woke from the ice, but that apartment was sad, and lonesome. if he was apart of a team, he needed to amongst them. And heck, Steve's quarters at the Tower were at least ten times the size of the S.H.I.E.L.D owned apartment.
“Hi, Steve,” she said in return, crossing her arms on a smaller plane of rock and laying her head in the crook of her elbows. The rest of her body swished and swayed in the salty, languid sea. “You’re out late tonight,” Natasha remarked, her green eyes gleaming with moonlight. Steve huffed a small laugh, looking out at nothing in particular.
“Sorry,” he replied without any remorse. Steve straightened his posture, pulling away from his love only to then drag a finger through the splatter on the mirror. He brought that finger up to his lips, watching Tony in the reflection as he slowly licked the digit clean, dragging it out of his mouth with a pop.
“Alright,” Steve finally said, smiling then. “When the clans were outnumbered, Ferris didn’t leave Brayan’s side, even when the rest of his men fled. Holding Brayan’s lifeless form, Ferris was killed too by the invader’s leader.”
Steve’s breath caught as Tony toyed with them through the silk, and loved every minute of it. The cool softness of the silk heightened to the rough masculine touches of Tony’s fingers, the man rolling the buds between his fingertips skillfully.
“Shush you,” the super soldier said, getting to his feet. Their enclosure was just a few inches taller than Steve, allowing him enough space to move about. “Just sit back and enjoy the view.”
“Did that just make things official, then?” Tony asked, smiling still as he slid his hands to Steve’s narrow waist. “Shall we assume the rolls of boyfriends now?” Steve trailed a hand to Tony’s chest, resting it on the curve of his pectoral, the other sliding up to card his fingers in the hair at the nape of the brunette’s neck.
“No, Tony,” Steve replied sharply, instantly feeling bad for using such a harsh tone. The brunette quit his movements, and Steve could tell Tony was both hurt and irritated. “Sorry, love,” Steve cooed, moving his head, trying to catch the other man’s eyes. He really couldn’t do much else, what with his hands tied to the headboard and all. “I didn’t mean to bark at you.”
“Oh no,” Tony murmured, tossing the bookmark back in the bag and standing up. he paced his living room, thinking of what this all meant and what he would do going forward. Tony thought about what it meant, the soulmark warming and itching when Steve was around, and now Tony was thinking of the man and being attracted to him?!
“I know that, Steve,” Tony said reassuringly. “I just want to do this for you because I appreciate your friendship.
“What’re you doing?” He asked, his breathing strangled. “You’re the one said I had 3 orgasms in me.”
"Steve. Steve Rogers," Tony admitted. The man moved his shirt collar aside then and revealed the red bump there. Bruce looked at it closely, truly fascinated.
By the third day of being a hermit in his lab, Tony was on a near breaking discovery on a formula he’d been trying to figure out and perfect for months. His concentration was halted when J.A.R.V.I.S announced that Steve had come down and left food for him. There was a small squeeze in his heart when the A.I. told him that, knowing Steve was probably confused by the restricted access. Steve was always allowed down there. Tony wouldn’t admit that he preferred the man down there with him, their silence always peaceful, their comfort amongst each other balanced.
Steve also wished he wouldn’t get so worked up over the man. He’d been trying so hard to be diligent on letting his feelings for Tony subside. If he was honest with himself, he wasn’t doing a good job with it. But he deserved a pat on the back for trying at least.
“Well, you’re gonna be a miserable man, not knowing what could be,” Rhodey stated matter-of-factly. He sighed when Tony just frowned. “Look, it’s a risk, you’re not wrong,” he admitted to the genius, shrugging his shoulders. “But risks have always been an all or nothing deal. Nothing ventured nothing gained and all that.”
Stepping into the bedroom, heart pounding and cheeks flushed, Steve found Tony sitting on the bed, the top buttons of his white dress shirt undone, his shoes and socks off. He had his head down, looking at his phone, a few dark strands of hair shading his big brown eyes.
“God yes,” Tony replied, opening his eyes finally and looking at Steve. “It’ll feel even better when it’s in that juicy ass of yours instead of your hand,” Tony lightly challenged, playing with Steve’s behind, massaging those plump cheeks of the super soldier. He kneaded his fingers into the warm peachy skin, giving him a little love smack, causing Steve to hum in approval.
“Yeah, I’m here,” Tony said into the phone, conversing with whoever he was on the telephone with. Steve hurried back to the bathroom, clothes in hand before closing the door behind him. Well, he never saw Tony react that way around him. Maybe he just caught the genius off guard, surely that’s what it was. Steve wouldn’t humor the idea that it was anything more.
. I was going to get out of your hair soon enough,” Steve finished, his voice cracking with emotion.
Steve told him the story of his mom, and Tony could hear the fondness in his voice when he spoke of her. Steve didn’t mention his mom much, and Tony could understand that. His own mother was his world, and when she died, for a long time the mere thought of it was enough to make him fall apart. Steve’s mother was a saint though, from what Steve had said about her. She not only raised one of the most honorable men in the world, but also she did everything she could to make sure Steve was taken care of and loved, in a world that so often indulges in cruelty.
“And you didn’t buy that one?!” Tony playfully chided him. “The Iron Man colors are far superior,” he laughed.
“Enjoy the rest of your trip, Cap. Tell your other half I said ‘hi,’” she said cheekily, and Steve rolled his eyes good heartedly.
The inventor could see a large, gaping wound near where the merman’s hip would have anatomically been if he were a human. Tony found it to be quite a strange wound, deep and penetrated as crimson blood oozed from between shattered glossy scales. Before Tony had a moment to do anything more though, he was yanked away by meaty paws and pulled to his feet.
“Well apparently in this area and season, it’s a good place to catch steelhead,” Steve said, looking pleased with the pole he chose.
“It’s not the worst I’ve seen,” the smaller man said, finishing up the dressing of his friend’s wound. Bruce turned and began cleaning his medical tools then. “What are you thinking about, Tony?” Bruce asked after a silent pause, rinsing a scalpel in a water basin. Tony looked up and took a deep breath.
“Nothing,” Tony assured him with a gentle pat on the blonde’s bare bum. “Just love you so much, Stevie.” Steve smiled down at his love and cupped the man’s bearded jaw.
The brunette saw his lover smile naughtily up at him, knowing he was being quite the irresistible tease. “Even with your wrists bound you still manage to catch me off guard,” Tony chuckled, taking a deep breath. Steve only giggled innocently, his smile bright and full of love. Tony snickered too, resting a hand on Steve’s rosy and warm cheek. The genius took a moment to revel in the image of Steve splayed on the sheets, his muscles stretched with his hands bound above him, his chest rising in the anticipation of what was to come.
A night in late fall, when the beauty of the season had long since withered to dead brown foliage and grey skies, the team nestled closely into the communal living area, having a movie night. Natasha sat cross-legged on the love seat, Clint next to her with his feet on her lap. Bruce sat in a plush recliner while Thor sat in front of him on the floor, a pillow in his lap, and a plethora of candies by his side. This left Steve and Tony on the other couch, and Tony really tried to focus on the film, or basically anything besides the super soldier sitting next to him. He would look at Steve only once and a while, each time finding something even more endearing than the last. Like when there was a jump scare in the film and Steve just about flew the popcorn bowl back when he gasped. Or when he went to eat said popcorn and a few kernels missed his mouth, settling on the hem of his shirt and jeans. Why did Tony think
“I’m gonna need to up my game so you come like that every time,” Tony said, drifting a hand down Steve’s sweaty back. Steve giggled again, leaning back to press one more quick kiss to Tony’s mouth before working his way out of the brunette’s embrace.
The genius scooted up on his knees till he was right behind his boyfriend, placing his hands on Steve’s narrow hips. Tony pressed a heated trail of kisses down the blonde’s spine until he hit the fabric of the man’s panties. That dainty, chiffon fabric slipped almost effortlessly down, revealing the beautiful curvature of Steve’s luscious ass.
Leaning an arm behind him, Steve pressed Tony’s hand against one of his bum cheeks, encouraging the genius to squeeze harder as the super soldier rode him.
“God, that was so fucking hot,” Tony breathed, leaning into kiss his boyfriend. Steve giggled, sighing into the brunette’s mouth as their tongues caressed against each other.
Blinking his eyes a few times, he saw the one side of the bed empty, the side where Tony would so often sleep on. The genius was in his own bed that morning, much to Steve’s dismay. Tony insisted though, for he was busy in his lab, figuring out a formula for something Steve didn’t care to understand. Tony had said he didn’t want to wake Steve when he came to bed in the middle of the night, though Steve assured him it wouldn’t be a big deal.
Steve couldn’t wait anymore, he wanted Tony, needed him. And so, he reached back to grab Tony’s sides, pulling him closer and feeling the head of his penis nudge against his opening. He heard Tony curse, and Steve moaned at the feeling of just that little bit of pressure from the brunette’s cock.
“Hmmm…I guess we’ve got a little bit of time to figure it out,” Tony responded, tucking his head under Steve’s jaw.
“Two weeks from now is a military gala. There will be a tribute to Aunt Peggy, and I am going to give a little speech on her role with S.H.I.E.L.D, ya know, before it became corrupted,” she joked. “You should come.” Steve knew what gala she was talking about. He believed he received an invitation as well. He didn’t really want to go before, but knowing that there would be a tribute to Peggy, Steve didn’t want to miss it. He’d already missed 70 years with her. He needed to start making up for it now.
The mission was going fairly well, though it would have been much easier if they had the Incredible Hulk with them to take down the beast. Thor had been beating the daylights out of the creature, staying in its blind spots before mounting its head and slamming Mjolnir into its cranium, electricity flooding its body. Tony flew around the being too, shooting missiles and exploding rockets at the monster, weakening it with each blast.
Looking back to the reflection in the mirror, Steve met Tony’s eyes, liquid pools of warm amber as he moaned so sweetly in Steve’s ear. Knowing that he could take the genius out of his head for a little while always made Steve feel absolutely wonderful.
“God, I wish I could fuck you,” Tony rushed in a soft breath, as he traced his fingers between Steve’s bum cheeks. “And have you writhing on top as I pound into you, letting you fall apart in pure ecstasy, Tony added, slipping two fingers into the super soldiers throbbing entrance. “I guess my fingers will just have to do, huh?”
“I’m fine, Cap. Fit as a fiddle,” he replied. Steve nodded, and went to get up to join the snow battle once more, only to see a demigod sized ball of snow flying his way. He put his hands up to block it, only for Tony to push him against the ground once more, shielding Steve with his body. It hit Tony’s back, the ball breaking apart as wet snow flew every which around them. Steve was slightly startled, though Tony chuckled to himself.
Heading into his boyfriend’s bedroom, Tony still in his arms, kissing him gently, Steve laid them both on the luxurious cream colored comforter. The lights of the room turned on then, illuminating everything in a soft, warm glow. They giggled, kissing softly as Steve hovered over Tony, one hand holding the back of the brunette’s head, and Tony traced tender touches over the curvature of Steve’s solid biceps. Their embrace was warm and sweet while they kissed, the air in the room thickening the longer they went. Steve started to pant as he suckled at the deep pink pillows of Tony’s lips, nipping at the corners in between breaths.
Steve had his eyes closed while he allowed Tony to cleanse his body. The dampness from the cloth left a coolness on Steve’s skin, sending a pleasant chill through him. He felt Tony’s hands drift along his bum, smoothing the delicate fabric over it before squeezing each cheek in his palms. Steve felt his breath leave him in pants, his head falling forward. God, he loved Tony back there, his nimble fingers exploring all of Steve’s masculine body.
“I’m good?” Steve mumbled, an incredulous tone in his voice. “You’re so good… and too good to me,” Steve added, turning his cheek to look at Tony who had settled next to him.
“Go ahead then,” Tony cooed,” blowing on Steve’s hole all while pushing his fingers in and out of the man he loved with his entire heart. “You’ve been holding off so long,” the genius added, trailing his unoccupied hand over Steve’s side. The super soldier began to stroke himself immediately, urgently twisting the coil in his lower belly with each tight movement of his hand.
“I’m curious to know why you chose fishing then,” Tony replied, putting down the hat. “Also, you should take the red and gold pole over there. Much better colors.”
Steve hummed around Tony’s cock as he took him deeper, using his hand to stroke what he couldn’t fit down his throat. He loved hearing Tony’s pleasurable sighs as he hollowed his cheeks around him, his tongue lapping at the engorged vein at the underside of Tony’s erection. It was when he felt Tony’s breaths come in pants that he let up, not wanting their fun to end too quickly. Steve pulled off with a pop, licking the precome and chocolate off his full bottom lip.
“It’s wonderful to see all she accomplished during a time where it was even harder for women to hold authoritative roles.” Tony could hear Steve’s voice sounding morose, and Tony just huffed an irritated sigh.
“I may not be an expert on fishing,” Tony chuckled, casting his line perfectly. “But I don’t think that’s how it works.”
"He said you didn’t know anyone and that you could use the company," Tony replied plainly his dark eyes big as he looked up at Steve.
The inventor found his advisor in his quarters, writing fervently when Tony opened the door unannounced.
It was near sunset, the men catching a few small fish here and there as they tallied their numbers. Steve had three and Tony had four. It was a pretty close match, and they were about to call it a night when Steve’s bobber went under with an unexpected force.
“ehn, ye-yes. God, Tony, don’t stop doing that,” Steve said between gritted teeth. He was so damn close to orgasming. He couldn’t take the heat that roiled through his belly much longer. Tony pleased him, just as his beloved asked, suckling on the tense muscle of his rim. He then turned his cheek in against the hole, rasping his beard along the sensitive skin of Steve’s body. Tony nosed at the man’s perineum then, reaching a hand down to rub at Steve’s prostate from the outside, the super soldier squirming under his touch. Squeezing his hands in the blonde’s thighs as he went, Tony was spurred to keep going by the delicious sounds Steve made.
“He’s probably on an inventing spree. You know how gets.” Bruce gave him a friendly smile and a pat on the shoulder before he headed back down to his own science lab. Steve thought about what Bruce said, knowing the quiet man was most likely right. Steve really needed to calm down. It was Tony, he was a genius who always had something to work on. Still, it all just seemed off to him. Shaking his head from his thoughts, Steve decided to distract his mind with some strength conditioning exercises. That would help!
Steve was moaning now on a continuous loop, thrusting back against his lover, wishing for Tony to fill him up the best he could with his skilled tongue. The feelings collided with the emotional thoughts that swirled inside his chest, and Steve couldn’t think of anything past them. Not like he’d wanted to even if he could.
“I should go on conference calls more often, if this is my reward afterwards,” Tony said, winking up at Steve before he spread the man’s legs further apart and hitching up his knees. “Can you hold your legs up for me, Steve?”  the super solider wasted no time complying, bringing his knees to his chest as much as his dexterity would allow him. He was so exposed like this, yet being with Tony was also when he felt the safest. “Perfect,” he heard Tony whisper, the man eyeing up Steve’s body as if it was a work of art.
“You wouldn’t mind that though, would you?” Tony teased, grinning deviously. He saw the blonde’s cheeks deepen a shade once more, giving away Steve’s interest in the matter. “Seriously though, Steve. There’s definitely a strong source of power and submissive undertones when it comes to anal beads. If I go too fast, or you get uncomfortable, I need to know,” Tony said, and Steve listened, though huffing a sigh once and a while.
“Hey, Steve!” Tony said, feigning surprise. “I didn’t know you were going to be here.” He went to take a big gulp of his scotch, only for ice cubes to hit him in the face. Did he really drink all of that
Tony teased him with little bites to his nipples and muscular pecs before finally kissing up Steve’s neck and to his lips. Steve smiled up at the brunette when Tony hovered over him, feeling so blissed out in that moment. “Since you haven’t been with anyone,” Tony started, licking Steve’s plump bottom lip, his one hand caressing at the blonde’s side, feeling the dips and peaks of his serratus anterior muscles. Steve shook his head, leaning up to nip at his beloved’s lips. “You’ve never experienced a blow job, then?” He grinned cheekily.
He realized though, that it was mere desperate hope that fueled his actions. And that there was nothing more to be done. Pepper wasn’t coming back.
“Mmm,” Steve hummed, his head falling back against Tony’s shoulder. “Feels so good, baby,” Steve breathed, eyes shut as he relished in the sensations his boyfriend provided.
“I understand you,” Steve said, his voice extremely soft. He brought his hands to his laps, clasping them and looking down reticently. The man stared at him in awe, mouth agape when Steve spoke.
The brunette woke up in a flash, his breath ragged, sweat dripping on his brow. He immediately felt an ache in his chest, as if his heart was about to stop. He clutched his arm, trying to regulate his breathing. It was a mere dream, not even a nightmare, and Tony's mind was in fight or flight mode. Everything felt so real however, as if he had truly been in a Neolithic dimension, witnessing it all first hand. Tony assessed his room, which was empty now that Pepper had gone, wiping his sweaty temple and forehead. He felt clammy and overwhelmed as the dream played on a loop in his mind. The genius saw these figures and felt a strange connection to them. They were a distant memory, as if he had this dream before and these characters had a vague familiarity. Tony flopped back on his bed, grunting with frustration and staring at the ceiling.
Tony didn’t say a word, but slid a finger down the cleft of the blonde’s ass, pushing the pad of it against the man’s entrance. He didn’t press in though, but kept enough pressure on that tight ring of muscle of Steve’s warm hole to cause the blonde to wriggle against his touch.
“Yeah. It was,” Tony mumbled, texting Rhodey to see where he hell he ran off too. His honorary ceremony thing was coming up soon. Also, Tony needed an excuse to get away from Steve and his squeeze as soon as possible.
Leaning back in his chair, Tony tossed the tools on his work table and combed his non-injured hand through his unruly dark curls, huffing a breath and staring off at nothing in particular.
“Okay, so he and I are extremely good friends. Big deal,” Tony said, trying to wave it all off, attempting to sooth Pepper’s heart and mind so that their relationship could continue on. “Plus, he’s a guy, Pepper. You of all people should know that I don’t swing that way,” Tony chuckled lightly, his one hand caressing up her back to feel the cool metal of the zipper sewn on the back of her dress. Pepper knew he was right, too. She had been around him enough to know that he had bedded multiple women, loving their enticing, soft curves. It wasn’t that he had something against same sex relationships, he just personally never found himself sexually drawn to male before.
The merman smoothed the cloth over his hip as tenderly as possible, biting his lip at the burn of the rough cloth catching on the stiches. The merman was not sure how he could get out of this room, let alone the ship without help. The narrow table he was on was a long way down for a creature with a tail. He would have to use all his upper body strength to crawl back to the deck. His tail was mostly pure muscle, but it did little good when out of the water.
The super soldier quickly caught up to his friends, not wanting them to be concerned. But he looked at objects on display blankly, as his thoughts raced with the possibility of maybe finding his soulmate. Oh, how he still yearned for that day, if that day ever came anyways, when he found his other half. The one that balanced him and enhanced his strengths.
“Relax and let me make you feel good, love. A week of meetings and paperwork must have been tiring,” Tony cooed, moving to the other bum cheek and delivering a love bite to the meaty flesh. Steve gasped ahead, his body rocking against the sheets and pillows, allowing his lower belly and erection to have better friction. Tony snickered, feeling oh so proud for making Steve squirm so quickly. The genius began to rub the cropped beard he sported against the super soldier’s backside, nuzzling closely, his love’s desperate sounds swirling in his heart, only to then shoot down to his aching cock.
The weeks went by as they always did, consisting of work, Avenger missions and the occasional movie night with his teammates. Things between him and Steve were absolutely fine, they were great actually. Steve would be in Tony’s lab like always, or Tony would be sure to attend the team’s training sessions every day. Even when during one of their sparring matches, when Steve ended up pinning him to the mat, and straddling his thighs, causing Tony to have rogue, yet very naughty thoughts, he buried them away, knowing that soon these feelings for the super soldier would all just fall away.
And it isn’t like they never made love, they had sex quite often actually. But between Steve’s super serum libido and Tony’s intoxicating sexual prowess, well, Steve was pretty sure he could live with Tony in the man’s bed and never leave.
Tony eased off Steve then, reaching next to him for the lubricant. Popping the cap open, Tony squeezed what was probably an excessive amount onto his hand. “Spread your legs some more for me, Stevie,” Tony murmured, watching the soldier comply. Holding onto one of his boyfriend’s hips, Tony prodded gently at the man’s entrance, slathering the lube there. The one finger went in easily, and Tony pumped it inside Steve’s warm channel a few times, prepping him for a second digit. “Steve, open your eyes.”
The team eventually defeated the bad guys. But all Tony could question was at what cost did it take? He rushed Steve to the hospital in his Iron Man suit, following behind the doctors as they hurried the blonde into surgery. Tony paced the waiting room, his heart racing, his mind whirring until it was allowed for him to see Steve.
“Mister Stark,” Steve called, and Tony turned to look at him, his wrapped hand on the door frame. Steve eyed him a moment, not sure what he wanted to tell the compassionate man.
Nevertheless, Steve woke up alone. Slowly rising from the bed, Steve adjusted the pastel blue silk and chiffon nightie he slept in, the fabric bunching up around his waist during the night.
The formula and algorithm were giving Tony grief as he tampered with it and picked at his brain, and it was evening by the time Tony had his fourth diagnostic running, hoping this would finally be the magic number, literally.
The trip down was a quick one, though Steve’s heart pounded wildly with each floor that brought him closer to Tony. When the doors opened up, Steve hesitantly took a step out, the tiles much cooler on his bare feet than the elevator’s.  He wasn’t sure why a bout of worry washed over him, lurking like a dark shadow. There was the sound of muffled music he could hear through the glass walls, and he could see Tony, the dark-haired man hunched over a piece of the Iron Man suit. Steve watched as the muscles in Tony’s shoulders shifted under his t-shirt when he put pressure on the metal piece. The genius scrubbed at his face with a hand then, leaving a smudge of grease on a tawny cheek before refocusing on the item in front of him. God, he was beautiful.
A sudden movement below the water caused the glassy sea surface to stir unexpectedly before a creature appeared. At a quick glance, one would have believed the creature was simply a man. Yet, as the being pulled itself onto the large rock that rose from the ocean and perched there, it was easily seen that the creature’s lower half was more like a fish.
It was then Steve shifted in his seat, eyes still glued to the screen as he angled his body more towards Tony. The brunette looked down, seeing how close his left hand was to Steve’s right one. He stared there, wondering what it would feel like to hold another masculine one, but not any other masculine hand, Steve’s hand. He imagined it would be warm and strong, the perfect combination to Tony’s slightly rough and calloused hand.
“Sure thing. But next time, we are doing it while we are in the same room. That way we can get our hands on each other at the same time.”
“It’s plenty fair,” Steve said after a minute, his one hand still playing with Tony’s hair. “I’m not gonna come that soon. Where’s the fun in that?”
But as the blonde straightened his posture once more he found himself to be rather light headed and nauseous. He held his head in his hand and tried to take a few deep breaths. Natasha saw him there looking woozy.
Steve always wanted to find his sense of belonging. And he thought he’d find it in the army, thought he would have found it with Peggy after the war. He surely didn’t think he would have found it when he woke up in a foreign century, his old life ripe in his mind though it was decades away.
“What the hell was that all about, Cap?” Tony shouted, lifting the face plate up to reveal an angry scowl.
Steve, bless his soul was utterly confused by the positioning until Tony’s hands grasped the other man’s upper thighs and yanked the super soldier back, Steve’s heartbeat quickened, understanding falling upon him as Tony’s fingertips started tracing the florally lace pattern of Steve’s thong.
