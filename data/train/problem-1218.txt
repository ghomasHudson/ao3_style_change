And he didn't understand, his mind couldn't grasp the dichotomy of what sentiment did to people, to him: loving someone so much that it physically hurt and yet hurting the object of his love with words, with omissions, with truths. Protecting and destroying. Craving and fearing. Heartbreak and sparks of brilliant happiness.
He couldn't lie to her, but she couldn't know the truth either: that he was terrified at the idea of losing her, that he couldn't risk finding out whether he would be willing to sacrifice her for the greater good because he already knew the answer: he couldn't, he wouldn't.
He was a copper and he knew Sherlock, he knew that he would withhold useful information if it suited him – and there was too much at stake, and he would be damned before he let Sherlock disappear on him again, whether willingly or otherwise!
Her voice sounded genuinely worried when she added, “Do whatever Mr. Holmes asks you to. I am sure there is a reason why you are going back home.”
He cast a glance at John, he couldn’t help it, and he noticed how pale he was, he was keeping his eyes fixed on the tv monitor where his daughter was now awake and crying, even if there was no audio feed, only video.
and, for just one moment, he let himself be hugged, for a few heartbeats – he hung onto her, feeling the baby kicking against her stomach. He felt like a terrible human being, because he needed
Meanwhile, there were people going through Herman Bennett’s financial and electronic records with a fine comb, and the same was being done to the people – alive or dead – involved in that scheme.
He was aware that he had a debt of gratitude toward Mycroft, for more than lending him his personal barber to prepare him for the following day. Of course he would never say as much as a word to Mycroft, although he supposed that asking for a favour, even an inconsequential one as that, was proof enough for his brother.
had not been like in the movies John loved – it had been lonely, it had been tedious to the extreme, hours upon hours spent waiting, travelling, trying not to get caught – and it had also meant, in some occasions, especially for the first year, to take lives – he had learned to delegate, after.
“We couldn’t trace the call and the video feed origin, but we were able to download it – your brother is on the phone, he needs to speak with you.”
It wasn’t any different that time: he woke with a start – and, for a moment, he couldn’t recognize his surroundings, he didn’t remember where he was – and then it all rushed back: he was in Greg’s office, kipping on his couch, ordered to have some bloody rest under the threat of being sent home, because he had been awake for more than twenty four hours, and had been running on fumes for over a week and Greg could only take Sherlock being a right bastard, apparently.
John didn’t comment on Mycroft’s words. What could he say anyway? He knew the elder Holmes was right; he knew Sherlock would insist he was
he wondered whether the man felt like breathing was easier as well, he wondered whether he would sit on the armrest of the chair or crouch in front of him, but he did neither of those things. He didn’t even touch him, but his words did.
" Sherlock asked, cocking an eyebrow. And he knew it was a mistake; he knew he should have let Mycroft talk. Because he felt, now, that a lid had been opened and Mycroft could...do or say whatever he deemed appropriate.
“Yep. He gave me his version of ‘break my brother’s heart and I’ll make you disappear’.” John said, realizing only too late what he had said.
“How could we foresee that? It’s Sherlock.” Greg tried, but the excuse sounded weak to his own ears. A few years before it would have worked, though. A few years before they all would have thought Sherlock Holmes could not
Sherlock opened his eyes and shook his head, moving a hand to his knee, resting it here. “I know why you are angry with me, John.” His voice was soft, now, he looked exhausted – and younger, somehow. And John might have just fallen in love with that impossible man all over again.
Oh, she must have imagined that moment for a long time, hence the choreography:  the carefully chosen clothes, all the little games she had played, those bloody Plexiglas walls. But it was different when one was confronted with reality, after wishing something for so long.
The man in the video looked about Sherlock's age, maybe a few years older; John had not truly paid attention to the images on the computer's screen, though. He knew he was supposed to, but he had focused on Sherlock, instead. Yes, he had seen the way the man, Victor, had been held still while someone cut his thumb off. He had heard the noises, seen the man go into shock, but it hadn’t really registered with him.
She had told Gavril that using a former SIS was a hazard, but Mr. Neal had approved the idea and she had just kept playing her part. She had not truly cared, to be honest: as long as she got what she was promise the other things didn’t truly matter.
“So, let me ask again: does it matter? Or are you trying to find a way to  blame yourself for what happened?” The doctor asked.
While Sherlock finally succumbed to a restless sleep, filled with sounds and images that would wake him up more than one during the night, calmed only by John's presence, next to him, someone (because Herman Bennett was right on one thing: they were
“Make it simple, then.” William hissed. “Explain to me in simple words why four men burst into my flat and -”
“It never stopped him before.” Mycroft said. He turned to look at him, “Especially when you were in immediate danger. ”
He had seen the relief and the naked pain in Sherlock’s eyes and he knew that none of them: not Mycroft, not Mrs. Hudson, not Molly Hooper could really help Sherlock, only John could. And the only person who could help John was Sherlock himself.
He was standing at the foot of the bed, his hands in the pockets of his coat. He didn’t allow himself to move or to do anything but looking at the man who had been his first lover, possibly his first real friend, and his heartbeat remained steady, he didn’t need to clench his hand in a fist to feel real, he could feel and see and observe everything.
Things had definitely not been like in a movie: there had been depositions, Sherlock and John had been at the hospital and things with John had been worrying for the first twenty-four hours. There had also been the matter of dealing with Janine Hawkins’ murder, Victor Trevor’s kidnapping and the chaos caused by the explosions.
This chapter was a nightmare to write. I binned it twice before finishing it. Any resemblance to what appeared in season 4 is totally unintentional. Believe me.
"You disappeared for twelve hours! You promised Greg...and me that you ..." John said and he was seeing how much he was trying not to shout, because he felt guilty, because he had tore the stitches on his right hand during a momentary lapse in judgment and then had gone and seen the man who had abused him. And somehow John felt responsible for that. He thought that it was somehow
The fact, what truly mattered at the moment, was that Mycroft could see things that he couldn’t and not for lack of trying – therefore he needed to focus, to concentrate, to observe, to tear away the temporary paralysis his brain was prey of at the moment.
But physical training had turned out to be a pleasant surprise; even learning those ridiculous moves akin those of action movies John had been so fond of had been interesting. The training (which had also been another excuse for Mycroft to make sure he stayed clean)  had proved to be useful on a number of occasions and Sherlock had known, since the first day, that he could excel at it.
His brother was changing his shirt, there were fresh bandages on his back, and he saw the pink lines of the  new scars juxtaposing with the older ones, the ones he had collected during his two years away.
Clearly William Moore wasn’t just a teacher as the telly said – and John wondered whether Mycroft had told Sherlock or he had deduced it, even before the man gave himself away as, John suspected, a MI5 or MI6 operative agent. Or former agent, since Sherlock had talked about the man’s past.
on the scene; oh, no – he had breezed in: tall, lean, pale, a mop of dark curls that had made him look even younger than he had been at the time, a cigarette dangling between his long fingers, high as a bloody kite and impossibly arrogant.
He would remember sounds, he would always associate them with those days: the sounds of people right outside their door, the  men assigned to be their shadows,  the sounds Sherlock made at nights, during and after his dreams.
Anger would have to wait, however – right with the feeling of being in some sort of parallel universe, one where a blonde, kind, funny nurse, someone he saw as a friend was actually an assassin who, most probably, was part of that fucked up vendetta against Sherlock.
No, she wanted it to last, but why was she  still stalling? If he knew his brother, and he did, better than anyone, he must have found him – it wouldn’t be long and that was not childish, wishful thinking, not any longer – he could see the same awareness in Mary and that was something he couldn’t figure out. She should make the most of the time she had left: make him open the other boxes, hurt him, reach the climax of her game –
“Alyce Bradford’s parents dropped by earlier – they wanted to know how you were doing.” John said, breaking the silence. Sherlock didn’t move, didn’t look at him – and how could someone miss a person if they were right there?, but John knew he had heard him. “They want to thank you.” John said.
Lestrade, John and even Mycroft were scared for him – they read his medical chart and saw whatever they wanted to see, inferring scenarios that were not close to the truth. No, he was
“He was thinking about you – “He said, “I didn’t look at him when I shot him, but right before – he was thinking about you. He was devoted to you.”
In the end, that was the only thing that mattered to her. Sherlock was – the last connection she had to Alex. She had imagined asking that question in a lot of ways, usually with Sherlock Holmes dying, with a lot more of blood and screams. She had not imagined the silence in that room, dotted by the sounds coming from upstairs: men looking everywhere for the cellar, all of them armed, all of them with a specific goal.
watching Mary pointing a gun at John’s head, but the truth was that he was too focused on the woman to actually be afraid which, he supposed, was one way his brain was coming up with to protect him. Too little and too bloody late!
The first thing to do was to free himself from the manacles. The idiots had not even checked him properly and the mole had slipped him the keys when he had dragged him into the room. That had  been part of the deal.
He shivered when he felt Sherlock breathe against his forehead, with the cold, with that bloody rain, with too many words he needed to say, he closed his eyes.
Agent Harris clearly wanted to follow him inside, and for a moment Sherlock was tempted to tell him not to bother since it was likely the last day he would be assigned as his protection detail, he wanted to tell him to consider a change of career, one where his empathy would be more useful.
On the way to that elegant three-storeys house he had recalled with extreme clarity how Mary had stood by his side, on a Tarmac, how she had looked like the picture of perfect innocence: the devoted wife, the friend who had kissed his brother and had hugged him while being aware that he was going to his death.
. The game was still on, still going, it was around them, in that room, and wherever John was at the moment.
John had heard Herman Bennett and his futile attempts at playing games with him. He had also deceived John, manipulated him. He had told him things about the day he had faked his  suicide.
“What do you want to know?” Sherlock asked when she did not react to his words, while those she had spoken were still lingering in the air.
He didn’t move, his right hand was perfectly still inside his pocket, his scars didn’t itch or throb. He was calm, he was himself - whatever he had become for the past few weeks: the old, the bad, the machine, the killer,  the scars, the nightmares, the love for John - it was all there, as he didn’t move a muscle and looked at his first lover without saying a word.
What had shocked him, what he couldn't have anticipated even if he had thought that such an occurrence might happen, was how distracting his physical appearance would become to him.
Perhaps it was the fact that they shared similar physical features, that he was too tall and thin, perhaps it was the fact that he loved chemistry almost as much as he did, that he actually didn't find it weird (freakish) that he could lose track of time and be totally devoted to his experiments; after all his love for physics and astronomy was all encompassing.
It was the truth – she had no reason to lie, not at that point, not about that. She was many things, but she was
She sighed, but couldn’t help a little (alright, maybe not so little) gasp of surprise when Mycroft Holmes got into the room. Anderson paled, and they exchanged a glance when Sherlock’s brother walked behind them and said, “Shall we watch the videos together?”
That was his role after all, wasn’t it? He was the iceman, he was the uncaring, rubbish big brother, the overbearing presence in Sherlock Holmes’ life.
He was surprised realising how little he cared about what she had said. He supposed that a gun pointed to John’s head, held by a woman who hated him so much that she had ordered a man to carve him up and rape him trumped the anger he might have felt otherwise.
“Sherlock -” Victor said, breaking his train of thoughts. He knew that tone of voice too, he remembered it: it was the one that meant that there was something important he needed to tell him, like the fact that he wanted their relationship to be a secret, or that he had been accepted for a Ph.D. in the USA.
“It’s been a pleasure –“ Ms. Adler said. She must have been very good at what she did. He sincerely hoped he would never have to meet her again.
Thank you SO much to all those who left feedback and kudos. (I'm looking at you: @Lillocked, thesignofserbia, stainedglassangel!). I've been home, bedridden because of  a nasty flu, so...tadà! Another update in a month:)
"...look how you bleed pretty, red on white, your skin is soft, Sherlock; he told me about it. He told me so much about you."
“Precisely. I made a similar mistake once, I cannot, in good conscience, expect Sherlock to forgive me once more.” Mycroft replied. He smiled again, but it was an insincere one, it was a mask, and he had enough experience with the two men to know when it was the moment to let things slide and when it wasn’t.
He hadn't lied to John then; he had never really thought Sherlock Holmes was a sociopath. He truly wouldn't have him allowed on a crime scene if he had seriously thought he was a psychopath and not just a junkie with a big brain and a perchance to solve crimes.
He wasn't, not really. He had lied, deceived, hurt and killed, yes, but he was not like Moriarty. He had never been.
John was alive. He wasn’t surprised, it wouldn’t make sense to sacrifice their bait so quickly, he was useful, for now. He was also bound to a chair bulloned to the pavement, headphones in his ears and a blindfold covered his eyes.
“John and I had sex last night.” He blurted out, when the silence in the room was starting to feel too thick, “I thought you should know.”
, but there was more than that – he didn’t look like he had for the past few weeks: as if guilt was crushing him. She had tried to tell him, more than once, that he was not responsible for what had happened to Sherlock, but to no avail – she had seen how the past weeks had weighed down on him.
he was in. He couldn’t even see what was behind Mary, it was dark, purposefully so. There were no windows, no noises coming from outside.
There was a split second where she was sure that John would move, which would be an utterly stupid idea on his part and she saw Sherlock tense behind the Plexiglas wall because he must be thinking the same.
Well, at least his suspicions were confirmed. It was Irene Adler indeed. He had read about her, about a few political scandals involving her, but - last he had heard she had been killed.
He had seen how John had not moved a muscle, even as he must have felt her movements, how he had not said a word, how his gaze had fixed on his – how he had still believed in him, even if he could not do a single thing to help him, to avoid Mary pulling the trigger
Sherlock scoffed, he could see he was in pain, but apparently he had decided to forego his selective mutism. And John was grateful, even when his tone didn't became cutting, harsh, as one would expect from him, when he said, “Is it not? Then Bennett must have broken me, as you all fear, because that’s what I see when I look at Lestrade, my brother and you.” He looked at him, and John knew that look; Sherlock was studying him, was deducing him, yet his voice was low when he asked, “Tell me, John – did Bennett break me?”
He had been flogged in Serbia – and by Herman Bennett. He knew the feeling of skin piercing intimately. The second spasm was – worse, somehow, it came from within his body and its force caught him by surprise leaving breathless for a moment.
hit John, making his heart hammer against his ribcage: Sherlock was not watching telly, he hadn’t asked to read newspapers, he had not asked Greg or even Mycroft about Bennett.
an idiot), when the two men, a couple of minutes later exited the room, John’s hand firmly planted on the small of Sherlock’s back, both of them looking less pale, more themselves than they had for days.
She was close, now. The door was open and perhaps he understood her more than he ever did: having the object of one’s heartbreak and pain so close without being able to touch or do anything about it was – maddening.
He waited for a few more seconds and then got up from his armchair and walked to the bedroom; Sherlock had not locked the door,  He never did it anymore, because that room was theirs now: he had a drawer and room in Sherlock's wardrobe and yet  John felt a weird sense of Deja vù; he had been right outside that door the night Sherlock and he had kissed for the first time. Sherlock had felt exposed, well he had been
And, perhaps, he should have wondered who could know so many things about his past and how it had come to be. He should have investigated on who had taken a stroll at Cambridge first and asked discreet questions about Victor Trevor, later.
Sherlock’s hand was almost unnaturally cold, but John did not move a muscle when Sherlock twined their fingers together. It was – more intimate, in a way han the hug they had shared at Baker Street.
Sherlock was dead. Sherlock had killed himself and there had been tears in the man’s voice, genuine tears while they talked on the phone. Sherlock had been his best friend – and he was grieving – and grief always found new ways of rearing its ugly head and let him know that it wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon.
He shook his head. He still had a long way to go, he wondered whether Doctor Hood had any idea of what a Herculean task he had undertaken because the objective fact was that he had killed Mary’s husband, he had been used as scapegoat and an excuse to weave a new net, to build a new criminal empire and many people had suffered because of that.
"How reassuring!" He had said, when he had been told that the black box was not, in fact, a bomb; it had taken him a moment to remember that Sherlock had said the exact same thing once, in a similar circumstance. He couldn't say he blamed Sherlock.
“He’s not. He’s…” John looked at the man: there was empathy in those brown eyes, concern, “Someone once told me that he is a great man and that if we were lucky he would become a good man. That’s what he is. He’s a good man..even if he’d disagree with me on this.”
“It’s your mother’s name, isn’t it?” He had asked. He had been pale, sitting at his bedside, at the hospital, wearing scrubs himself and there was an IV with blood and God knew what else at his side.
John – touched him again, and despite the pain (what had he done? He didn’t remember – he had trashed Herman Bennett’s cell as he looked for clues, but what –
Sherlock let out a sigh, one of his long suffering, dramatic shows of boredom, and John wished, God…how he wished he could believe him.
She liked what she was doing, it was transparent. She had probably missed the chance to misbehave, as Sherlock had told him she considered her activities.
The man was very much aware of the fact that he was being observed. He knew – they both knew that they didn’t even have to confess Janine’s murder, they had left traces that made a confession unnecessary.
"But you will want to see Mr. Bennett anyway because you are a good man. That is what they are counting on." Sherlock said and, despite everything, he heard the pride in the man's voice while he said those words.
Sherlock smiled, and John knew that particular smile, he had smiled like that on the Tarmac, before getting on that plane. He swallowed past the ball of fear and rage he could feel in his throat and heartbeat and touched Sherlock's face. Sherlock didn't shy away from him, he leaned into his touch, never breaking eye contact with him.
Mycroft smiled, “Ah, yes.” He leveled John with one of the coldest gazes  he had ever seen Mycroft direct at another human being and said, “I would not have been interested.”
She had the time to ask a few more questions, to know what had happened with Alex. Well, she knew the results, she knew why, but she needed more. And she only had one chance.
Sherlock tilted his head back, leaning against the wall, he closed his eyes and mumbled, “Poison or anaesthetic?”
“John’s notes of your cases, oh, and his journal,” Mary claimed, interrupting him, “his private journal.”
Words; those they had said, the painful ones they had exchanged for the past two weeks, the ones still unsaid, all the logical reasons why they should not be that close, why their lips should not brush against each other’s ceased to matter.
He had known he would have to die – whether to take down Moriarty’s men or for real and he had acted on impulse. John had punched a man for him, he had run with him, he had become a fugitive – and he had not properly thought things through. There had been part of him that had wanted
John turned and he could see that he was studying him, trying to see if he was all right. The relief, shame and regret he could clearly see in John’s face and body were deafening, for a moment. It was not John’s fault, or even his own, for that matter.
love, heartbreak, devotion, hurt) sentiment passed through his eyes but it was gone too quickly, replaced by a calm, calculating look.
John thrust his chin up. If Mycroft wanted to make him feel guilty about what happened after Mary had shot Sherlock, he was too late, but he wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction to deduce it. Or, at least, he wasn’t going to admit it.
John sighed and said, “He offered himself up as a hostage instead of Alyce Bradford and Herman Bennett accepted.”
"Brian Cooper." The caller only said. It was his man in Chicago, and yes, it was indeed fucking important.
Sherlock took his mobile phone from his coat’s pocket. He had got a text and there was just a number, no other message.
He must know how much he was trying  not to  follow his instinct. Had he already calculated the odds of trying to take Mary down? Was it why he had not said anything?
"You are honest." John said, but Sherlock felt that it was not what he had really meant to say. Not completely.
"Because whether we want it or not we will always be part of each other's lives unless, of course, you don't want to be part of
It had been hard being with Victor at the time and to be perfectly honest he had not truly made an effort: he hadn’t known how to be a partner, how to be in a relationship, how to love him and he still hadn’t been - the man he had later become. He still had no clue about how to love properly, how to be in a relationship, how not to hurt the people he loved, but he had perfected everything else.
Static coming from the half forgotten earpiece made him start; there was a curse, and then Greg said in a hoarse voice, "You can come in. Air is clear..." he paused and added under his breath, "so to speak."
Idiots. All of them: physical pain was inconvenient, true, but it took a lot more than that to break him.
“Were you alone when you went to bed?” Sherlock asked. It was a routine question, actually. It made him feel in his element, even if he was asking the question to Victor and not to some stranger.
The pool – did they know what that place truly meant to him? Did they choose it for that specific purpose? Did they truly think that it would have an effect on him after having been in
Sherlock shook his head and said, "What am I supposed to do, now? Relationships are not my area, John."
Victor  was clearly exhausted; he was fighting the effects of the strong painkillers he had been given to try and give him answers. He described the four men, he gave him each detail he could think of and, not surprisingly,  two of  them were most probably the men who had killed Janine.
He suspected that he would find out soon, very soon, how long they had been planned all of that – it was his job to make sure that they failed. That they would not kill Sherlock.
He minded his own business usually; if John wanted to get married,  pretend that he hadn’t got together with Mary only because Sherlock hadn’t been there, he would not talk, he would let him live his life, even if it meant that two people he loved both hurt; what he could do, as a friend, was to park his arse in that hospital hallway, even if his skin itched with the need of a shower, he had a horrible taste in his mouth and his back was killing him; because John Watson was going to pieces, like he had after Sherlock had staged his suicide, and that time he would not watch idly, because Sherlock would be
Her hand was still holding steadily the gun, her eyes were still dry, she had only grown paler. She moved and got inside the cell; he could smell her blood and his own.  Perhaps, that was what she really wanted: the two of them bleeding out together. She had deconstructed him: if Moriarty had wanted to burn the heart out of him, Mary had succeeded in ripping it out of him and hold it in her hands. True, all true -  but he had broken her before they even met.
“Let me check you out – and then we’re going home. There is nothing we can do but wait  anyway, isn’t it?”
“Do you think it’s connected to what happened to Joan?” He had asked, more because he was still trying to rationalise how his life had become such a nightmare for the past eight days than because he actually expected an answer from Mycroft Holmes.
Excellent retentive memory – a past they had not uncovered, except for a few tidbits and whatever William Moore and Irene Adler might have unveiled for the past twenty-four hours.
John stifled a sharp intake of breath settling, instead, on blinking his eyes. He knew Sherlock was in the room, he knew the man was looking at him, but for a moment he couldn't bring himself to look in his direction.
The only sounds he was focusing on came from the rain: it was – soothing, in a way. As a mental exercise, he sometimes chose to focus his senses on one thing alone, muting everything else. The rain was – calming him, at the moment.
was the one who woke up from nightmares, and he had come to miss his old dreams, the ones about Afghanistan, because the worse that it happened in them was that he got shot again, and he had survived that – he had been saved. Twice.
If he said that he thought that what Victor had proposed was preposterous he would merely accelerate the process – and he would lose him; that idea made his insides clench for a moment and before he could dwell on those feelings he quickly said, “Don’t be daft! I said it is fine. Now that the matter is settled may I go back to my experiment?”
He moved. He could finally run, on broken glass, bleeding, but he didn’t care. He need to leave those woods. He needed to (wake up, stop being filthy, stop being afraid, stop bleeding) reach John –
It didn’t matter. He had talked to his brother, listened to what he had to say, been informed on the few meaningless progresses his people had made. He had not asked anything else. He had not asked him whether he knew what Herman Bennett had whispered to John before he died, what  John had told him before he came back.
The truth was that despite the word he had said to Mycroft the previous evening, all the people he held dear were still in danger.
He had no idea how long it had truly been since Sherlock had picked up the blade. It had seemed to go on for hours, like in one of his dreams – and he was taking deep breaths because he had to think about his daughter – and Sherlock. God knew what Mary had in mind, but he could not take risks.
“Mr. Moore,” Mycroft Holmes said. William only knew the man by reputation, he had met him briefly, nevertheless the feeling of something amiss only grew when the man spoke.
“Yes, John, pointers to someone obsessed with Moriarty who truly wanted to fuck Sherlock in his honour.” Mary said, “And Sherlock didn’t do a thing to stop him. Not one fucking thing.”
It was poison, and it didn’t make any sense – and he could hear people coming in, hopefully more doctors; Bennett was convulsing, he was in pain and a distant part of him was actually enjoying that, but that had to wait. Bennett blindly reached out to him, grabbing the back of his neck, his fingers were icy cold and John fought that hold, but it was surprisingly strong.
He saw the way her lips curved as she looked at Sherlock  and pressed his lips into a thin line. He had not looked at Sherlock since Mary had opened the door, but he could not help it now; Sherlock was still standing, despite the fact that he was still bleeding, he could see blood coating the hand covering his side, he was ignoring the chair right next to him,   the other was splayed against the glass, he was keeping his eyes fixed on him, and he was too pale, he was not showing emotion, even if it was pretty useless at that point, but somehow it gave him strength.
John didn't add anything else, he let those words hover over them, and Greg could have filled in the blanks, he had been a copper long enough to, but chose to let it go, for the moment at least. "I think I'll have that shower now." John said, getting up, and only in that moment did Greg notice the blood on John's shirt; Sherlock's blood.
He didn’t know, didn’t really care. The only thing he was aware of was the drumming in his chest, the warmth of Sherlock, next to him and the feeling that eight hours in a basement and everything that had happened there had just been a prelude to something else.
Drake had asked him if he wanted to help, back in the hospital, even before they all saw Mary being killed and he had said yes.
John was tired, he didn’t particularly want to chat with Mycroft, but he was sure he didn’t really have a choice. He nodded, resisting the urge to look at Sherlock and followed the older man outside.
He always felt tested whenever Mary called. He always waited for the other shoe to drop with her, but so far the worse it had come from Mary were snide remarks about his newfound domestic bliss with Sherlock.  And John didn't know what to make of it; he was glad that the charade was over, that the game of pretending had come to an end, but he was also worried because he remembered what she had told Sherlock in that old house, he remembered how close to the knife she had been when they had got back to Baker Street. He didn't trust Mary, he couldn't, but until the baby was born there was not much any of them could do.
The three men who were taking turns at punching, kicking, hitting and cutting him were living clichés: all three men were hugely built, they were dressed in black, they even wore  leather dusters.
back where they could not reach him. Facts had proven that he was not safe from the things that lurked in his mind, it didn’t matter how much effort he put into putting things in order in his mind palace, that didn’t mean he could allow his thoughts to get in the way.
He had acted on impulse, he had – not thought things over, not really, when he had kissed her forehead, lingering for a moment more than absolutely necessary – he had shown his hand, but it had not mattered. He still didn’t care, truth be told.
“You’re right about the plan – but I’m good at improvising.” She replied, aware that she had not answered his question, not really. And he noticed right away.
He had missed seeing Sherlock like that. He was still too pale, of course, and there were bruises on his face and others hidden under his scarf and the collar of his coat. He was wearing gloves and his right hand was still bandaged, and there were scabs and bruises on his wrists, and yet his movements were fluid, his presence filled up the whole room, as he took in each detail.
“I’m fine.” The man replied. He didn’t look fine, he looked like he was hanging on a fine thread not to go to pieces.
“He was out – we were out!” She heard herself say. She had vowed a long time before that Sherlock Holmes would not get squat from her, that he would have to deduce and infer everything, even after things were over, but those words had nested in the back of her throat for years.
Of course, Sherlock had lost weight, she thought, he had been tortured by a serial killer, he had spent time in the hospital, he was still healing.
John let out a sigh. He took some steps into the bathroom and sat on the lid of the bathtub saying, “Take your time, I’m not going anywhere.”
“I –“ Molly trailed, “I never really apologized to you, did I?” She said, and he was pretty sure that it wasn't what she had meant to say at first. And Greg noticed the way she wasn’t looking at him, how his own jacket looked good on her and how he was feeling more relaxed than he had for hours.
"And I had asked you to keep an eye on him. Yet Mary slipped through the cracks." Sherlock said, deflecting.
He was in Serbia, running and running, knowing that they would get him, that he didn’t have any weapon on him, that John, in his mind, was urging him to keep running but the balance of probability told him that he would be caught. He would be hurt.
John Watson would go to the clinic without noticing that he had people spying on him. One of them was Mary Morstan.
“Yet I let him – hurt me. Why?” Sherlock said. His voice was soft, and Mycroft couldn’t help thinking about the child Sherlock had been. How he had not understood people, how easily he had been hurt because he never fit in.
Sherlock. He had – been to hell, as well. His past, the things that had made him the man he had – fuck, he might as well be honest with himself - fallen in love with out in the open, for everyone to see.
The two men outside the office where John and Mycroft were, ignored him as he opened the door. John and Mycroft were indeed there, sitting at a table, John’s hands were stained with Herman Bennett’s blood and he could still smell it faintly: that foul, putrid odor that he would forever associate with the dead man.
the timing for them couldn't be worse; he knew that there were two victims: a dead woman and a man kidnapped (people Sherlock had known, not perfect strangers who bore a passing resemblance to either of them.) and the game was
She smiled and shook her head and kept looking around. He wondered what had happened, why she wasn’t outside with Tom, he wondered whether she really wanted to look for Sherlock or had needed – a friend with her.
They would because they had looked everywhere and there was no sign of John’s daughter in the house. She had been there, but evidently, Mary and her cronies had timed their arrival for
, Sherlock had solved the mystery – when did he not? – that the culprit had been apprehended and that the rest of the day had gone on swimmingly.
That didn’t mean Sherlock would not try and do something rash or dangerous or that he would not try and keep his promise to Sherlock. It only meant that, for the first time since he had seen Sherlock chained up that rack, in Bennett’s basement, he could breathe a bit more easily.
“What is it, then?” He asked, his voice sharp and filled with vitriol, “what am I to you, John? A manchild you can mock openly? Your enabler? A punching bag? A scapegoat for all the wrong choices you have made? A machine?”
Hesitation, just flickers of it, in the short man’s eyes. He had considered that, he had wondered and waited – the tall man was better at hiding his thoughts, his doubts. The tall man looked unconcerned and he truly wasn’t. He had
He noticed the other man at the door, he was armed, and he saw that both the Russian man and the man carrying the incubator were carrying guns as well.
“No, not as such.” Mycroft said and John wasn’t relieved by the men’s words, because those people wouldn’t have sent those pictures with that apple if not to try and fuck with Sherlock.
One moment he was dancing with one of the bridesmaids and a moment later Molly Hooper who could look pretty even while wearing that yellow dress (the fact that the first adjective that came to his mind had not been
He would not have been surprised had he known how similar his thoughts were to John’s: he was tired of seeing Sherlock’s blood. He truly was. His brother had bled enough because of the woman in front of him. That had been the last time.
Victor had made an effort when they had been together: he had tried so hard to understand him and he had succeeded, apparently, or he had become easier to read or their connection, at the time, must have been deeper than he had thought because the man in front of him, looked at him for a second before he started to tell him everything he would have asked.
He started when he felt Sherlock’s fingers (his right hand) lacing to his own. He looked at him, Sherlock was engrossed in the images on the screen, on the words the journalist was saying (and later John would kick himself for not hearing, for not caring), he could see he was already deducing, he already had ideas, germs of plans, and it was amazing and terrifying at the same time.
There hadn’t even been time to plan a perfect strategy, but the agents Mycroft had chosen had been quick to come up with a plan of action, they were clearly used to those sort of operations.
John had brought Sherlock coffee but only after he had stopped shaking, closed in a bathroom stall, on another floor, trying to breath past the scream that had struck in his throat, forcing him to close his eyes, to try and not let it out, scream until he was hoarse, until he could think again properly. Facts. Sherlock was pretending to sleep when he came back with his cup of coffee.
She did, she thought it was appropriate. She did not know their daughter’s origins, but Renee, was an apt name for a girl born twice.
Only now that said man had been apprehended by some of Drake’s colleagues, things were starting to really register. He could see all the things that could have gone wrong and how seamlessly agent Drake and him had avoided them, almost acting on instinct.
at the moment) to her was in any way comparable to what he had done to John when he had faked his suicide.
He was absolutely certain of that because being in Sherlock’s bed, their bodies touching wherever the wounds on the younger’s man body allowed it was right.
He had calculated the odds, he had erroneously thought he would knock the man out cold once Alyce was safe.
Sherlock nodded, but didn’t add anything – and John thought that it was only fair that he should say the words. “It all flew out of the window for me that night. I – had forgotten that Baker Street wasn’t home, even before we –”
in Sherlock-else, meant that he  would rather have teeth pulled than talking about that specific subject.
There wasn't anything funny, though. Janine was still in the room, still dead and there were still a black box, a note and a writing on the wall with a promise of more to come (one down.... how many still to go?) –  and those people were good, the only thing he was sure about was that whatever was going on, whatever master plan those people had was
Greg Lestrade blinked in surprise: their shoulders were brushing. It was a nice evening, they had had dinner together, the first they had been able to have after the whole nightmare with Mary.
Both men shook their heads. Reading those men was easy – there would be no point in bluffing or lying. The truth was enough.
He really did not want to talk to a therapist. He wanted to – stare at his food like he had done until that moment and cool off before he could go back to Sherlock.
Anthea was the last one to get out of the room, closing the door behind her, leaving them alone; Mycroft had stood as he talked, he had commanded the space in the room; he had been in the house, in the cellar a month before; he sat and looked at him, and John thought that he should be used to that kind of scrutiny, he thought that Mycroft was probavly deducing everything he needed about his life for the past month, and yet the only words that came out of his mouth were, “I will find your daughter, John.”
He could see that the picture had been touched a lot through the years, that it had been kept in a drawer – and he was sure that Victor had had that picture. He had destroyed the few mementos of their relationship still in his possession shortly after Victor had left. He had been high, most probably  both on cocaine and morphine (a delicious cocktail he had discovered not long after he had started with cocaine.).
Molly took his hand and Greg ...He would never, ever, say that they slow danced to the notes of one of Adele's songs.
Just like Molly did, although for completely different reasons. Victor Trevor – had been important to him.
Anthea, who had been at Mycroft’s side, looked at her phone and then immediately after whispered something in the man’s ear. Mycroft left immediately after, without saying a word,  followed by everyone but Molly and Anderson.
“Of course I knew.” Sherlock said. He sneered, “Here I was thinking that your people had become marginally less incompetent since my return.”
They had never met  - and Mr. Neal had been very adamant about that and she had agreed with him because she needed the knowledge that even if things went south – for her, most probably, since she was the one physically in London, the plan, in all its parts, would still go on.
betrayed him, he had not chosen his daughter over him – even if it was the most logical assumption. John had – he blinked his eyes. Was it how John had felt when he had found out that he hadn’t died, that he had deceived and lied to him? Was the fact that his mind and body were at odds with each other – his mind going over the past few hours, all the details clicking together and it had been so
Mycroft still hadn’t given him his orders. He had assured him that protection for Joan had been further reinforced, but he doubted she was in any danger at the moment. They had John Watson, it was clear they had plans for Sherlock, anything else would quickly fade to the background.
Her mind, to be completely honest, had kept going back to what had happened in the parking lot on the way to the bunker, which was the very last thing she needed. It had taken her so long to – find a balance in her life after Sherlock’s return – the last thing she had expected was – to feel confused.
He was hurting John, again. That was why people like him shouldn't be granted second chances and were not supposed to have
It was not the puerile allusions to what had happened in Herman Bennett’s basement. It wasn’t that. It wasn’t the images featuring both Victor and Mary being
He took a step getting close to the Plexiglas wall and John did the same. Could he choose between his daughter and Sherlock? There had been no hesitation in his mind, in his heart when he had got that text the previous night – and Sherlock was right, the bastard, but how could he let him alone with Mary?
A shadow of a smile crossed John’s features. And Greg was not stupid, he knew that John might intellectually agree with him, might rationally know that they had friends, people who would gladly lay down their lives for them, but in the end it was always Sherlock Holmes and John Watson against the rest of the world. That didn’t mean he wouldn’t try to help them, though.
The car stopped in front of the house. He had noticed how ordinary it looked from the outside the first time he had been there, he had suspected Mr. Bennett’s primary bolt hole would be a place where he could hide in plain sight and he had been right.
Light and darkness were swirling around him. He could feel them, coiling and uncoiling around him like silk and iron. He could see stars above him, through the huge cracks in the ceiling. The cracks had not always been there, of course; they were the result of  the chasm that had shaken the core of his mind palace, it had shaken it to its foundations and he was now assessing the damage.
Within five minutes he had made a young constable cry, two men had almost come to fists because of his deductions  and he had solved a string of murders that had driven him almost mad for weeks.
The mobile phone was on the table, and William looked at it before saying, “What are you going to do?”
"Let bygones be bygones and we shall be one happy family. Is that what you are asking?" Sherlock said.
He was beyond angry, beyond exhausted, so if Mycroft Holmes wanted him to play bait in order to catch those bastards he would.
It wasn't even enough that there was Sherlock's name carved all over an innocent woman's body, whose only fault was – what? To be a doctor? To be blonde? To be in love with her fiancé? Or was there something else? Something they hadn’t discovered, yet?
Those people had declared war to  Sherlock and now that he had decided to fight back there would be no stopping him.
she had been a means to an end, and he had been selfish, he had been a manipulative bastard and he hadn't cared that she had lied to every tabloid and talk show in the Country about their relationship. That, too, had been convenient, for many a reason.
And then things had gone to hell in a matter of seconds, really. It had been few seconds that John had relived, over and over, countless times, ever since; Sherlock with his hands up, walking toward that man, his voice calm and almost hypnotic as he offered himself up to save Alyce Bradford, the hunger, the glee in Herman Bennett’s green eyes.
“Go on,” He said after a moment, his voice came out cold, but not harsh. It took more strength than he had anticipated squelching any thought of how John would approve of his behavior.
"Obviously," Sherlock said, ignoring that train of thoughts, thinking, instead, about Chicago. He had to focus, the sooner he gave Mycroft what he wanted the sooner he could go home. To John.
The man held a satellite phone in his hand. God, she hated those! She held out her hand, the one free from the IV, and cocked and eyebrow at the masked man. God, her face hurt, breathing was difficult and her body itched and throbbed from the waist up.
“And you provided the distraction he needed, obviously.” Sherlock concluded for her. The tone of her voice had become scathing as she spoke. Oh, excellent: a crack in the façade.
Victor nodded his head. He closed his eyes for a moment and then jerked them open and said, “There was a break-in at my apartment right after Christmas. They took the usual stuff, but - they also took the content of a drawer in my desk, it was mostly junk in there, but ...”
“Janine Hawkins’ phone records need to be rechecked  and have someone examine the CCTV feeds close to her flat since January.” He added.
It was Sherlock, after a long stretch of silence of which John wasn’t truly even aware, who took the last step, who closed the distance between them.
like the scars on his back, like the ones on his hand, under the dirty gauze, like the bullet scar on his chest. For a moment he was tempted to shake Sherlock by his shoulders, not caring about the other people in the room, not caring about anything that it wasn’t the rage, hot and black, simmering just under his skin.
Sherlock didn’t reply, he kept texting, Mycroft probably, and John thought that it was weird that the elder Holmes still hadn’t shown up, especially considering the siblings'  daily meetings for the past eight days.
And there were the people Herman Bennett had killed to get his attention, the four men he had killed when he had retrieved Joan, and Janine. Oh, Mary needed to be far more specific if she wanted to play with him. And he knew what she wanted to know. She didn’t care about those people – she only cared about
He clutched the white shirt in his hands and had to sat on the bed (Sherlock’s bed) as the past eighteen months replayed themselves in his mind in painstaking detail. How could he have been so blind? Jim Moriarty had seen it, and so had Magnussen and Mary and Sherlock himself had laid his heart out bare, during his wedding, for everyone to see (and they had, hadn’t they?) and John had kept being blind, except for one moment, when they had locked gazes right before he went to dance with Mary and John had come close to really understand, to really observe Sherlock.
The water was ice cold. It was a shock, even before the primeval part of him started rebelling. Ice cold water against almost feverish hot skin made his heart stutter in his chest.
“It’s complicated.” John said. He could tell the man a lot of things and he was sure that the man would understand them, but he didn’t add anything more. “Sherlock is –” John started.
Joan was sleeping, she had not refused painkillers (she was a rubbish patient, but she had also been in a lot pain. And she had hurt enough for a lifetime) and William wished he could hold her hand, but it was impossible; both her hands were in casts and he knew that her days as a surgeon were over.
“Sir?” Anthea called, interrupting him before he could say what had been right under their eyes. Mycroft went to her, she whispered something in his ear and the man left the room without a word.
She shrugged and said, “Fine! It wasn’t my idea, I have no clue about how it was done, so don’t even bother asking. I was in too deep and I saw the message when everyone did.”
He sat on the bed, on John’s side: there was a bottle with three pills in it and a sheet with instructions written on it.
“Money. What else?” She replied, but she was lying. She was good, he remembered that, but years had mellowed her or, perhaps, he was just paying more attention.
Because he had spent 480 minutes with that man, forced to listen to that pathetic sadist with delusions of grandeur, and had spent two days, beforehand, studying his handiwork, not to get his words and the meaning behind them.) had finally reminded him that they didn't know him. At all.
Sherlock stilled his movements, he was holding two books, one in each hand and was not looking at him, but he was listening, so it was only fair that he talked.
He had not turned, he had not looked at him, he had not even touched him, but he hadn't really needed to.
It wasn’t enough for those people, who, despite all of Mycroft’s resources were still faceless, nameless.
John saw that Sherlock retreated far away in his mind while he tended to those particular wounds and he knew exactly how many cuts it had taken to carve that name. He knew how many stitches he had on his torso and how long it would take until Sherlock could have that name deleted.
He had missed that; not risking his life, of course, he had not missed the lack of sleep or the jet lag, or even getting as close to torturing a human being to get information while still being within the law.
Sherlock had slayed dragons, he had – been exceptional, but he had not been privy of all the facts, all the names. Still, he was proud of his brother. If they were different people, perhaps, he would have told him at the time – but they were not.
She didn’t even care about how much money she was making. It wasn’t like she planned on living a long life anyway. She was not in it for the power or the money and she knew that Mr. Neal was aware of that. It was the reason why he trusted her, after all.
“Herman Bennett is refusing to talk,” Mycroft said, “he insists that he will only reveal the hiding sites of the remaining victims to Sherlock.”
And Sherlock didn't like it one bit, because things didn't go so smoothly, not for them. Mary was civil, a bit cold and sharp in her words to John, but she had not
enough. And she had learned one thing from the situation with Magnussen: the Holmes’ brothers could be taken down. They were good, they were geniuses, they were exceptional – but they were also
even realized that he was bleeding internally had terrified John even more than the rush to the OR, because even if his blood work had been shot to hell, operating him had been the quickest way to stop the bleeding. And Sherlock still acted like it was nothing, even while in a hospital bed, smelling of betadine and blood, with all kind of tubes sticking out from his body and after waking up with a shout from a nightmare.
Sherlock was wearing the sheet he had been wearing at Buckingham Palace and pleasure spiked up and John had to moan, again, he had to bite his own tongue not to cry out Sherlock’s name as he came.
His brother was reading the report he had been given when he had come to his office, he was pretending to ignore him, but he was listening, so he said, “There were two or three monikers who were actively trying to recruit people in that chat. We took measures, but it is likely that they, nevertheless, continued  with other means.”
. She had been up for almost twenty-four hours when they had met, and she hadn’t looked exactly impressed with his tactics and his little tricks.
Molly shrugged, and nudged him while they were walking and said, “Someone told me you hid your smile behind your hand.”
“Tell me…” He whispered. He could feel – rather than see Sherlock’s body, slick and so warm against him. A noise. It came out low, hoarse from Sherlock’s throat, that pale column (there were bruises, weren’t they? Purple, blue and red, handprints against his creamy white skin – who did that? when?) he loved to kiss. Even though objects were floating around them and John could guess what they were, Sherlock and he weren’t floating, they were still, rooted to that spot, skin to skin.
John shook his head and moved from his bed, Sherlock followed his movements as he sat on his bed. “I’m not. Believe me. But it still wasn’t fair to still wear it. Not after ..”
just buying time." Sherlock said, “I suspect they know – and they just want to see how much I was right. I also told Moriarty something else, that day…”
“She is, isn’t she? She’s cute as a button,” Mary said, “we don’t have much time, so let’s get started –“
, Mr. Holmes,” Harris said. He was loyal to Mycroft Holmes to a fault, just like Drake. They would do their part.
John grabbed his arm, his hold was painfully tight. He stopped him before he could say more, before he could ask what would they do with him. It was obvious, after all, but there was Mary to think about.
So, that was how she wanted to play? Remind John and him that, despite everything, she still had power over them? Remind
Mary studied him for a moment and then softly asked, “John – is Sherlock all right?” She tilted a finger up, stopping him before he could talk and said, “I made a terrible mistake that night, John – but I do care about him. And I owe him
coming from the box, the unmistakable scent of dead flesh had made it impossible for him to do anything else. Sherlock moved, closing the distance with the opened box that had been placed on an old, rust-eaten chair in the boiler -room with two rapid steps.
She smiled at his words. “Of course, we already covered that. You were just doing your job.” She said.
He could breathe; it felt, for a moment, like that morning, before Mary’s phone call, when it had been just the two of them – and the past, the future had been meaningless.
He squinted his eyes, the light was definitely too strong and harsh, but he could make out a shape in front of him and when the man talked he knew it was the man who had killed Mary. He recognised the voice and his thick Russian accent.
“Well, no – but are you?” John asked. And he was genuinely curious, now. Besides, everything was better than talking about the real reason why William Moore had visited them.
There had been a code for Sherlock’s return. Mr. Neal had come up with all kind of codes and tactics. She had learned that he wasn’t a big fan of those things, but he had adapted to their target. Mary suspected that he was having fun, even though she wouldn’t know for sure since she had only met the man twice.
Despite everything, Lestrade could not help shaking his head and smile at the man’s words, “Now, why this doesn’t surprise me?”
John frowned: had Mycroft observed Sherlock at all for the past few days? How could he not see that Sherlock was –
He had thought he had gained an advantage but, apparently, she hadn’t even cared about that. She had wanted answers, that had been personal, but the plan had been already in place.
The consulting detective kept holding his gaze, an unreadable look in his eyes and John wondered how long he had been looking at him.
“Couldn’t save the little wife, can’t even touch your baby girl.” The man continued. And he was – happy to say those words to him. He was enjoying all the pain the people he cared about had endured.
She hated that he looked genuinely sorry, almost ashamed at what he had done. It didn’t make any difference, she couldn’t care less about the fact that he might feel regret for his actions.
John felt the man’s gaze on him, he wondered how long he would have to sit still and hear him talk before he could leave that room, before he could move without fearing he would put his hands around that man’s neck and squeeze.
"The car is here," Sherlock said. He turned and looked at him, "William wants to avenge what happened to Joan."
"Janine..."  Sherlock trailed, changing subject, but stopped. She had been used again. She had been killed because they might have been
That day, on the rooftop, had not wanted to die (leave John), but Moriarty had won the game -- and he was still paying the price.
“I will drop by his flat later –“ He said, breaking the silence that had fallen between them. It hadn’t been an awkward silence because there weren’t awkward silences between good friends who had known each other for years. The silence between them had been warm and Greg, well, he was not stupid. He knew what his role was. He knew what his boundaries were.
He wasn’t moved by faith or whatever was behind the tall man actions – he was only a thug, one who must have accepted an outrageously paid job with vague assurances about the outcome.
Sherlock's lips on his silenced him; it was a chaste touch, inquisitive but undemanding, Sherlock's fingers were still curled around his nape, and the other went to his chest, right above his heart. There was a part of him that couldn't help thinking that he shouldn't kiss Sherlock back, that it was wrong, that it was too soon after what had happened to him, that it could make a right mess of what they had - but there was nothing sexual in that kiss - it was the words that Sherlock couldn't say (not that he needed to), he realized, as Sherlock sought entrance, licking along the seam of his lips, that even now he was trying to protect him, to keep Bennett and the apple, the pictures away.
John didn’t move, didn’t react – but he was clenching his cuffed hands into such tight fists that she was surprised that he wasn’t drawing blood.
John blinked, his lips turned into something that was meant to be a smile, but came out like a grimace, but his voice was light when he said, “I know that Sherlock is actually a girl’s name.”
was the look she had wanted to see in Sherlock’s eyes since the beginning: helplessness, knowing that there was nothing he could do or say to save the man he loved. He could just
all along! And heads would roll, he would personally make sure of that, after, because such a fuck up could
Sherlock was looking at him, he could feel it, with every fiber of his being, and his body physically ached with the need to see him and the fear of
He saw the hesitation in Molly, and she had never hesitated with him – she seemed almost shy when she said, “We will be there for them – together.”
Before he could say anything, though, the whistling coming from the box started. He would find out very soon, in a matter of minutes, that the box had opened on its own. With an incentive to play.
She was there – mere inches away from him and he could not do a bloody thing. Even if they allowed him to do so, he could not touch her: it was not safe, God knew he was far from being clean and so was that room.
Mary was angry, she had been remarkably calm – hell, she had been cold and calculating for years: she had fooled them all, even after she shot Sherlock, but now that explosives were being used and he was pretty sure he was hearing voices, now that it was almost over – she was angry.
He tilted his head on a side, “It was his name, wasn’t it? It’s a fact,” He said, “Make no mistake, Doctor Hood: I hate him and I hate what he did to me, but discussing about the way I address him, it’s semantics at this point.”
He opened the folder and saw the familiar faces: men and women he had got in contact with, the three men who had had a good time thinking he would break with physical pain.
He hated the scars on Sherlock’s body, the old and the new; he hated that there were things he didn’t know, things that made Sherlock smash his hand against a mirror in their flat (and sod it all to hell, it was
That was a game Sherlock was very good at playing: sitting down in an interrogation room and observing suspects and culprits, deducing each and every detail about them, in silence. He had seen how unsettling his gaze could be; he had experienced, more than once, how utter silence could be unnerving to some people.
Mycroft Holmes had assured him that Herman Bennett would talk the night they had recovered Sherlock from that basement and so far he had kept his promise: Bennett had given them details about his known victims and the identity and burial sites of a couple of the unknown ones.
And one day he would not be surprised (and amazed) by Sherlock’s deductive skills. He handed Sherlock the note: a few simple words the masked men who had kidnapped Joan Adams had forced her to write down, threatening to kill her fiancé if she didn’t.
“We don’t have much time,” Mary replied, stating the obvious, which was something she never did. Of course, she was making sure that things went her way, even now. Whatever she had in mind, she did not care that help was on the way, that it was a matter of minutes before they were found.
The conference room they were in that morning was crowded: agents Drake and Harris, two operatives he had never seen before, William Moore, Greg (what the hell?), Anthea, Sherlock and him. There were copies of pictures taken in Mary’s house, after – there were pictures of the people who had been either killed or apprehended since Herman Bennett had taken Sherlock.
. He wished he had turned his back and left like he had wanted to do just a few moments earlier. He wished he could still do that, instead, he was frozen in place, staring at the sewn off thumb of someone he had
Sherlock looked at the man: his elbows were on the table, his long fingers laced together, his knuckles were white. He was nervous, he was – scared and hopeful.
Sherlock jerked his head up: eyes puffy and red-rimmed, tears still streaming down his cheeks. He was – had always been rubbish with feelings, with emotions, but that was Sherlock and he had always been the exception to every rule he had.
John smiled – he saw anger fighting to bubble up the surface, he saw how dangerously close to break John was. What was worse was that Mary must be seeing it too.
“What do you want to know, really?” He asked, “You clearly want to inquiry about one specific death. Ask directly!”
She saw how Greg and John exchanged a glance at those words, there was worry in both their eyes and she felt instinctively that the man in the video was
Neither of them was saying a word, because talking about feelings was like pulling teeth for both of them – and that was their life, their future at stake. And Sherlock was proud, brave, strong  and so bloody unpredictable that John did not know what to say and how to say it.
"Four," the man said, he smiled and added quickly, "I can smell him all over you - have you fucked him, yet?”
“Somewhere isolated where no one would hear what was going on.” Lestrade said, “how long have they planned this?”
He had not expected – to be ready to be genuinely outraged at the idea of innocent people dying because of a game, he had not been prepared to lose John, he had not expected him to be ready to die for him, he – had been so
He had reached similar conclusions for the past weeks, he had not realised, however, how deep the damage run. How pervasive it had become.
“I need you to do more than kill Sherlock Holmes, Mary. Everyone can pull a trigger, but it takes someone extremely motivated to
He had said his name in amazement, anger, betrayal, it had sounded like a prayer, an apology, a curse. He had never heard that particular inflection in       John’s voice: desperation, rawness, love, pleading.
“You know what happened, hence the last few years of our lives,” Sherlock said. He was leaning against the glass, now. She had to give credit to him: he was a stubborn bastard; his willpower was remarkable.
No one had tried and stop him or had interfered in any way when he had asked to see the two men who had killed Janine. It wasn’t only due to Mycroft’s interference, even if it was there, in the way no one objected when he asked to bring the two men in an interrogation room and leave him
There. It was not peace because he missed his daughter, he was worried sick about her, he was  afraid of the way she might be used when the American man would finally make a move and keep his promise, but he was living, he was among friends, with the man he loved more than anything, and he had hope.
It didn’t even matter that he had told Mycroft that Sherlock didn’t want him anywhere near Bennett during the interrogation. It was different. Time didn’t slow down, even though he felt like he was still stuck in his nightmare, he felt high strung, his skin itched and he missed his gun, the comforting weight of it. He still remembered that place.
He knew it wasn't a real answer. But -- those moments with Magnussen, his damp touch, his words, made him feel
All the tests had come back negative: he was not HIV positive; there had been a delay in his exams due to his stay at the hospital six months before, but he had the results in his pocket. He had texted John, who was with William interrogating one of the men apprehended in Mary’s house.
The doors were all closed, now. They would hold, the content, as toxic as it was, would not stop him doing what he had to do.
She entwined her fingers with his like he had thought she would do. She was smiling and she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.
Nevertheless he had left his card on one of the chairs, had given him a polite nod of acknowledgement and had left the room. Perhaps it had been rubbish timing on Doctor Hood’s part, he had entered the room shortly after Greg had left after he took Sherlock’s official statement over what had happened in the basement – but John suspected that things wouldn’t have been different under any other circumstance, that was why when he saw the man, a hour later, in the canteen, he tried to avoid him, the man though spotted him as he was sitting at a table, staring at a half eaten sandwich as if it contained all the answers of the universe.
He had known what would happen when he followed Herman Bennett down those stairs. He had known because he had seen the pictures of the other victims because he had observed Jason Miller’s body and had glimpsed Alyce Bradford’s. He had known how dangerous it would really be because Herman Bennett had not been like other people he had met and fought against. He had willingly walked into traps before, but he had always had an escape plan, however flimsy, a mole, an inside man or woman ready to help.
It had been a wakeup call. He had retired after that day because if one could not keep it during a routine interrogation, if one was scared by threats, if one was not ready to take any risk, if one realised they would betray their own country for the person they loved, perhaps retiring was the best option. It had been his only option, really. Despite everything, Queen and Country had still meant something to him. It still did.
He had given the order not to shoot the long-haired man on the run, his Serbian almost perfect, his heartbeat steady, while he already calculated how long it would take before he could go ahead and rescue Sherlock. A team had already been in stand by, waiting for his instructions.
Sherlock had not moved, he was still sitting at the edge of the bed, still wearing his trousers and his unbuttoned shirt.
Mycroft shrugged his shoulders, a placid look on his face as he said,  “I told you: there are things even I cannot circumnavigate.”
He was sure there were people digging through files in that moment, trying to find out who the mole was if there was one, but retrieving Sherlock Holmes, John Watson and the baby, apprehending Mary Morstan was the priority at the moment.
What he had deduced right away was what Mycroft had done – or attempted to do with the man. He had  already deduced some of the things he had done, every day, during his daily mind-numbingly boring hours with him, in his car; he had been aware of every tactic he had used, every progress he had made: Mycroft had wanted to destroy the man, break him. He had been aware of that – but seeing that cell had further clarified things for him. Part of him had almost been moved by Mycroft’s actions.
Ms. Adler smirked, “Mr. Holmes I accepted your offer, but I would like to make an amendement to our deal.”
Mr. Neal had needed things that  Mary could provide him with and vice-versa. Their partnership – because as the months had gone by they had become partners, building everything from scratch – was born in the underbelly of the internet. There were other people, sure, but it had been the two of them who had put things together, who had laid down the rules and formed a strategy, who recruited people and gave them assignments.
“Fine.” He said. He didn’t fuss with Sherlock’s blanket, he did not touch him, he did not tell him that he would be back soon. He did not tell him to be careful. He didn’t even tell him not to even
He had found the picture in an envelope, buried under a pile of newspapers and a few magazine clippings about bees and apiculture; he had purposefully left the picture atop the pile he had found in the sitting room, he had not asked Sherlock about it, and when the man had noticed, he had not said a word, not at first, only hours later, while they were in bed, did he say, “The details are tedious, John and unimportant.”
Sherlock made a noise, something too subtle to be a sigh or anything else, for that matter, but to Greg it was loud and he had to take a breath before saying, “No. Listen to me, Sherlock, I mean it!”
All the exits were covered, the men had been all disposed of one way or another; there hadn’t been many casualties among the operatives of that mission – which was good since far too many people had died or been hurt because of Mary Morstan and her cronies.
He took his mobile phone from his pocket with numb hands. He had not been there during most of Mary’s pregnancy, fatherhood had been something at the periphery of his mind, something that hadn’t been truly real, even when he had been with Mary to the doctor and seen the prenatal scan.
Mycroft had hidden that photograph, in a show of brotherly concern that had almost moved Sherlock. Mycroft, of course, must have known – and there was no point for John to see that particular image anyway. Sherlock supposed that his older brother had been tempted to hid the others photographs as well, since each and every shot was part of a story, it had been taken in particular moment in time, it had been chosen with care, it had been sent with a purpose.
For a moment, just a fraction of second, really, he had considered the possibility that the man was working for
He wanted so much to believe her, to trust her. He wanted to believe that she cared for Sherlock – or for him, but he couldn’t; he couldn’t trust her with Sherlock’s life – he couldn’t trust that she would not betray them again.
He was there – they both were: they were in their sitting room and they had won. It didn’t even matter how; what it mattered was that they had won. They were safe. Jim Moriarty had not won.
“I have a message to deliver, ” Victor said, he swallowed and said, “they said it was important, that it was about John Watson.”
If that had been a normal case they would be following leads prompted by one of Sherlock's deductions  by now, but Sherlock had done nothing, except for texting. He had  left Greg with Molly at the morgue and had said he wanted to leave. He hadn’t commented on the video, he hadn’t deduced a single thing about the images he had seen, not aloud, at least – and Greg had not asked.
“Mary.” Mr. Neal said and she had never heard that tone in his voice. It was not his usual calm, soothing tone of voice, his accent slipped, “You have known me for a long time, now. You know I
It was the truth, for once. How ironic! It was one of the very few truths she had said to the two men in the room: she had been out and Alex too. They had had plans and dreams. They had left their pasts behind. Alex had saved her life – and she had not been there to save his. It was as simple as that.
The appointment was exactly in the kind of place that she had expected: away from London, far away from CCTV cameras and in the middle of fucking nowhere. Mary was mildly curious about  the man she was about to meet.  She didn’t even remember who had found whom, not that it truly mattered after all – what it mattered was that they had found each other. They had both been looking for something and they had found it.
is that losing you would destroy John Watson. Now, I don't really care about John, but I was under the impression that you did." Mycroft said - and there was almost embarrassment in his voice.
“Well, fuck, no! Why do you think I married him in the first place?” Mary said, interrupting his thoughts.
He didn't add anything else. He didn't need to. John nodded and wordlessly helped Sherlock on his feet. Their fingers were entwined, now...and they were close, so close.
They were in their bedroom, in Baker Street, arousal thick and vibrant between them, but they were not moving, they were staring at each other, while the words Sherlock had said still hovered over them.
Bennett was dying, but he still wasn’t done. John looked at him: the man was opening and closing his mouth , thin rivulets of blood were trailing down at the sides of his mouth. John swallowed, Bennett was trying to speak, to say something. He wanted to tell him something.
He had called Anderson before leaving Bart’s, he had asked him to examine the video of Mary’s shooting with Molly. He wouldn’t have the time to examine it properly, and he had not been – lucid enough when he had watched it, but there was something  he couldn’t see, something that was clawing and screeching all over his mind palace and he didn’t know what it was about it – and he trusted them to see in absence.
He was alone, now. He was himself: his hands were steady, he did not feel the impulse to curl his right one  in a fist and feel the stitches tear. His hand was still sore, but it was the sort of pain that came with healing.
He hated having the man’s fingers still gripping, with a surprising strength, the back of his neck, but John inched closer.
He knew. Of course he knew, because if Herman Bennett as much as glimpsed at John he would squeeze the life out of him in a heartbeat. But -- he felt already too hollowed out to voice his thoughts. How did normal people function when they were in love? How did it not drive them crazy?
He didn’t remember much of the flight in the helicopter to the A&E, it was still a blur, he had not even known about Mary, at the time. Or about his daughter.
“He didn’t break any bones, but then again he started breaking Alyce’s after he was done with the flogging, so that would have been his next step!”
He focused on the room he was looking at, studying each single detail, trying to spot even the tiniest differences in it: there was none in the sitting room. He could still see how the room had been searched, the ham-fisted methods employed both by Scotland Yard and Mycroft’s people, but there was nothing out of place, nothing he had not seen or noticed before.
“How the hell would I know?” Victor asked,  interrupting his musings. He had acquired more than a hint of an American accent and the disbelief and frustration in his voice sounded all too familiar.
The words the man had told John were finally registering with him and he could feel anger, bubbling just beneath the surface, making its way up – and he had to force himself to stay still, his hands splayed on his sides as he looked at the rack in front of him.
He had thought about telling Sherlock immediately – he had hoped Sherlock would deduce what had happened, the content of the text: the requests, the words right away, but he had not.
“I think that’s enough for now, Sherlock,” Mycroft said, stopping him before he could watch the footage again.
“I am not leaving you alone with her,” John said, “ever heard of divide and conquer? She is bluffing!”
Jack, the agent assigned to her protection, had actually made her step back; he had been the one who had clicked on the link.
At first, she had not been happy at the idea of having a child with John Watson; he had not known a lot about her life, he had not needed to, he had known, however, that she had had plans to build a family with her husband when he joined her in London.
Mycroft was smiling as if he was having a childish tantrum and Sherlock took another step, closing the distance between them and repeated, "Make him
Did Mycroft Holmes require him back in London for that purpose? Did he choose a retired MI6 operative because of his personal involvement in what was happening? Were there ulterior motives? He didn’t know and at that point, he couldn’t say that he particularly cared. All he knew was that Joan was safe and she was to remain safe.
Sherlock focused on Janine's face for a moment and Greg saw him open his mouth as if to say something and then close it, clearly deciding against it at the last second.
Hours that turned into days as he held his mobile phone in his hand, wrote and deleted texts, cared for his daughter, went to work and knew, without a doubt, that Sherlock had been serious. It had not been a bluff.
The smart clothes, the ring on her right finger, the high heels, the dead man at her feet, the splatters of blood on her hands. It was all choreography. She had anticipated that moment for a very long time. She had worked hard: a true spider, a praying mantis, a wolf in sheep’s clothing indeed.
It was good, it wasn't too painful, but then again he was high: cocaine, hashish and whatever his dealer had given him.
“Langley, Virginia.” He said. He had no idea who that woman was, but Sherlock had assured him that she could get information, that she could get names, dates and whatever else she wanted or needed.
She rested her open palm against the glass, she was bleeding, her trousers were soaked with blood, she had given birth – and her body was reminding her of that.
“He can’t leave the hospital, yet.” John said. “Its too soon.” It was the doctor talking – a few more days in the hospital would only help Sherlock; he did not mention that, regardless of the incentive for playing, Sherlock might decide not to. He had said he had got bored with Bennett and that had been the last time he had talked to him about the man.
She also had leverage, one that would be exploited and he already knew that both Sherlock and John would fall for yet another trap, they would be forced to intercede for her.
"You lie, you hide things from me about this and I will drag you back to the hospital, Sherlock. I am not kidding!" John had said the day after they had got home.
“We weren’t promised that we’d get away scot free – but he promised you would suffer before you died.” The tall man said, “I’ll take what I can get!”
And she had known – she had given fucking pointers to that bastard and, at the same time, had sent him texts, and had come to the hospital, with an overnight bag and tears ready on the drop of a hat, pretending she was concerned, still pretending she gave a fuck about him, pretending she was noble and resigned to the fact that he loved Sherlock more than anything in the world.
He blinked his eyes and the Plexiglas walls and the cellar disappeared, they were replaced by a grey sky and a rooftop.
God, he knew, now. He knew what Sherlock must have felt when he decided to fake his suicide. He had known the risks, he had known that it was wrong, that it would hurt him if and when he knew the truth, but he had gone ahead anyway with his plan, because – because he had felt that it was the right thing to do, regardless of the consequences.
He opened his eyes and John was looking at him, his face open, his eyes told him that he had meant each word he had said.
John refused to think about the past, about the fact that he had not noticed Sherlock leaving his wedding and only recently had he seen a picture, part of the ones sent to the hospital, taken the night of his wedding to Mary.
forgotten how to run on fumes. The woman, whose name he was sure it wasn’t what Sherlock Holmes had given him in his text, had indeed a lot of connections, she knew how to get answers, and despite wearing jeans, a white shirt, and trainers, he had noticed right away the diamond earrings and the perfectly manicured hands.
That was true. Mr. Neal had always kept his promises. He had always given people exactly what they asked for. He took care of his people. He destroyed his enemies, that was why people – were loyal to him, herself included. And loyalty was something she never particularly cared about.
And it didn’t matter that, apparently, it had been a honest mistake from a young nurse, who had accepted to leave a gift from a young woman, one
“Are you sure?” He asked. It was his job to do that. It was his job to play devil’s advocate and let Sherlock rest that night before John Watson came back.
“I miss you…” His voice repeated, low and hoarse with lust and something else – but it didn’t make any sense, it didn’t belong there.
“I would have come back.” Sherlock said. He kissed him, again, and John stilled, for a moment, when he felt Sherlock’s hand trail down, between them.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. The good thing about the current predicament was that he wasn’t feeling any pain and there was once again structure in his mind palace, there weren’t gaps, schisms, rubble on the floor. It was –
Moriarty’s web was colossal. If things had been different, if things hadn’t got too personal he would have admired the late man’s work. It was truly a work of art: it was a complicated, multilayered web, each thread strong and apparently disconnected from the others, but that was only the surface, of course. All the threads were somehow connected to each other and Sherlock had to tread carefully not to reveal himself as he brought Moriarty’s organization down.
Sherlock had not said a word on the way to the morgue, he had kept his hands still on his knees, his gaze unfocused, but John recognised when Sherlock's mind was hard at work and his walls were up, thick and virtually impenetrable. He hadn’t talked, he had given him space.
Let Scotland Yard and Mycroft deal with that mess; he had caught the serial killer, he had paid his dues.
"It's not my habit to pry into your personal life..."  Mycroft trailed and Sherlock couldn't help laughing at his words.
There were two constables outside Victor's room. He had waited before going to the hospital, he had asked Harris to take the slowest route to get there both to sort through his mind palace and because he had been informed that Victor hadn’t been treated yet and, above all, he was still in shock and he truly didn't want to waste any time.
John chose not to hear the rest of the conversation, he didn’t even want to know about the pictures Sherlock had asked Mycroft about. He only needed time. He needed time to come to grasps with the idea that Sherlock and he had been spied on for
He had no puncture marks on his body, except for the faint track marks from old days and bruises on his forearms due to the IVs. Yet, it had happened. Herman Bennett had told John that he had had to improvise, that his reaction had been unexpected. As he looked around in the basement – and yes, he was aware that he should get into the soundproof room, he was aware that he should look for clues in that room and that time was a luxury he was sorely lacking at the moment – he recalled the other victims’ autopsies.
“Bullshit…” She had said, she had smiled and the tone of her voice – she had been flirting with him. She had touched her hair (it was not picked in a bun, it was long, loose on her shoulders ), played with her long locks while drinking beer.
"Precisely." Sherlock said after a moment (but it could have been longer), "And we are both aware of the consequences of what I did in the past. Either way, they get
Not surprisingly Mycroft Holmes had agreed with him. He had also promised – no, he had given him his word that Bennett
. Silence had been everywhere, after: in his (their) room. In the small sitting room, all around him outside, but not where it
“All I am saying is that you saw a video – but what do you associate to those memories?” Doctor Hood asked.
It wasn't the first time they had that conversation. He couldn't really blame Mycroft when he'd not seen the truth either.
Not that it mattered at that point. Mr Neal had anticipated that Sherlock would be too distracted when shit hit the fan to properly investigate and she had made sure, she had done everything in her power to ensure that he didn’t know which way was up and which was down at that point.
“To celebrate –“ John said – and he honestly didn’t know how long it had taken him to talk, how long Sherlock and he had looked at each other.
a machine. He would have wanted to be involved. He had used her to get closer to Magnussen, but they had been friends, and John had been jealous and could still see Janine's body in that warehouse -- and it didn't make any sense.
“And there will be pain. Lots of it.” The shorter man said. He clearly had an addiction to cocaine, he hadn’t shot up, though – he was refraining from sniffling, but Sherlock recognised the signs all too clearly. The short man was a weak ring in that chain, but that wasn’t stopping him talking, yapping away.
Lestrade was not at the Yard and he wasn’t answering his phone. No one had been able to give him an explanation about his sudden disappearance, no one had seen him for hours. Sherlock had last seen him when they had all left Bart’s.
“Is John supposed to be scandalised by my lack of moral scruples? He knows who I am!” He said. He had told John countless times not to make people into heroes, least of all him.
He had vague recollections of – something he had seen and experienced after Mary had shot him. He had been told he had died on the operation table, John had told him angrily that he had flat lined – he did remember Jim Moriarty – he did remember the feeling, the absolute certainty that John was in grave danger and that he had to save him.
It started with a flinch on a crime scene, with the body of a young man dumped in a warehouse like trash. It had started with a name carved, over and over, on that young man’s body.
Victor had always worn his heart on his sleeve, he had been incapable of lying,  except to his family  and he realized immediately that not much had changed in the man; he could still read him like an open book, he suspected that in that moment everyone could, it would not take having his deductive skills: embarrassment, regret, curiosity, anger, fondness were all dancing on his face, in his eyes and in the curl of his lips.
He had put everything aside after Herman Bennett had been caught. He had let Mycroft and Lestrade deal with him, he had – given cursory glances at reports, but it felt important that he should remember everything, now.
