Sam goggles at him.
But he hears Dean's, too. The thumb doesn't move, resting there like it's seeking entrance.
that she says she'll stop breaking seals if Dean and I give up and let her kill us?!"
Cas joins him for a few chuckles and that more than anything seems to throw Sam off. He spends the rest of the evening looking slightly confused, even as he and Dean start putting up the warding. By the time Cas finally stands to leave, Sam’s still got a little furrow between his eyebrows.
Adam has two helpings of dessert, though: cookies and vanilla ice cream with a pour of “Claire’s” homemade fudge. (It’s unsweetened bar chocolate melted and mixed into condensed milk, but the kid makes it herself, and it’s really damned good.) Amelia looks like she's going to put a third cookie on his plate if no one stops her, so Dean offers to do dishes and wash pots to get her attention off the kid.
Cas's face is a mess. It's bloody and bruised and Dean can just imagine what the rest of him looks like. Dean looks at the preparation table. Next to the shroud and the ropes are soap and a big metal bowl of water, a couple of the industrial rags that Bobby buys in bulk for the cars. Hunter burial rites aren't really that big on ritual, but sometimes they die with crap on them you don't want burning near other humans.
Dean nips him on the neck. Hard.
Cas turns his face back to look at him, and murmurs, "I see you," with his eyes hooded and happy. He bites down on his lower lip and his eyelashes flutter when Dean's next thrust takes him in. "Dean, I want... I want..."
"I think that obviates the point of keeping watch," Cas answers, but Dean feels those lips press against Dean's forehead.
Death nods. "Yes. But it also put me into this great chain of events as well. I know what happens when Lucifer rises.” His upper lip curls, and the next bite he takes of the rib tears off a chunk. “He would be able to bind me, and use me.
Dean stands up, and Castiel’s sweaty skin prickles in the air briefly until Dean returns, also pantless. But there’s only a hint of uncertainty in the goosebumps rising along Castiel’s skin.
Dean's not sure what to do with that. 'Cause that means that Cas is thinking about surviving this, too.
It's not the same. (Is it?) He knows that feeling a little too well. (He really wishes he didn't.)
Castiel can hardly argue with that. "Um. Yes."
Cas's back arches: he's directing Dean's fingers to the right spot, showing him how to please him and that's also something that makes Dean's brain fritz out briefly. Together, they find that place again and Cas, with his eyes closed and lip bitten to near-white, grunts in surprise and then starts rolling his hips in tiny little circles.
Dean tilts his head and pokes his tongue into his cheek. Zach is really not good at this, is he. "Angels really don't know how to soft sell, do they? I mean, really, if you'd spent half a second treating me like a person instead of an incredibly smart dog, we might not be having this problem right now."
"So how much of me
This? This is memorable.
Shit, that sounds just as stupid aloud as it did in his head.
They don't move: Dean's over whatever PDA quibbles he might’ve had over Sam or Bobby for now. He’s kissed Cas in fucking
(He's kidding. He is. Right?)
Innocent—maybe.
There's slippery wet between them, but right now, Dean doesn't mind. He's too busy panting, and remembering to breathe, and maybe function, because he's pretty sure he blacked out for a second.
Dean takes a deep, cleansing breath and tries to focus. "Human
Cas, though... Cas is so, so still.
Cas arcs both of his eyebrows, completely fucking unperturbed. "Six months and thirty-odd years, if we're actually counting." He shrugs with just his shoulders. “‘We stayed a day or part of a day.  Ask of those who keep account.’”
Like the way Dean curls towards him, like a plant to sun. Just sort of softly leaning into Castiel before he knows it's happening. Totally relaxed and asleep, a heavy and trusting weight. It’s almost as comforting as the blanket.
Cas nods, earnestly, leaning in to trace the line of Dean's chin with his nose. "I cherish our connection, I would never want it to flounder." He sounds as far from innocent as possible, and his nose finishes its arc, punctuated by a soft kiss. "It's very important to me."
Dean snorts. "Show-off," he mumbles, and streaks his fingers down the midline of Cas's chest, pushing his hands underneath the hem of his plain white button down to feel the sleek line of those abs under his fingers. Partly because it makes Cas shiver. Partly just because he wants to.
"No," Dean whispers. His voice doesn’t work. Fuck, he’s gonna hurl.
Dean's throat clicks when he swallows, and it takes a couple of tries before he can make something come out that doesn't sound like it's crawling out of a dungeon or falling from the sky. "Oh. Okay. Wow."
"Damn, you boys are disgusting," Bobby says. He almost looks impressed. "But cute ain't gonna get you off Death's list."
But the eyes looking into Dean’s are blue and bright, and completely sane.
to have, and he’s sure as shit not gonna use it as a weapon.
Cas shakes his head, and chuckles. “Maybe a bit.” If he were the kind of guy who winked, Dean thinks he'd wink. "But if we're talking about in-laws... Sam is a good man who's doing whatever he can to stop the end of the world," Cas continues—like it's obvious to him, an angel who can possibly see souls, and it should be obvious to everyone else. "I know that, and so do you. He's stronger than what's in his veins." He smiles. "I didn't think I'd ever have in-laws, either—for reasons that are very different from yours. But I'm happy with the one I do have."
Michael graciously allows Adam out for dinner. "I can experience foods just as well with Adam in control, but I suspect he would appreciate the…" he looks around the room, mostly curiosity on his face as he brushes his finger across one of Amelia’s fancy place settings, "family nature of the proceedings."
He ducks his head into Cas's neck and groans.
Dean realizes a split second later that he doesn't know if Cas came—except Dean does know, and it's got nothing to do with the warmth and wet he can feel against the front of his jeans, if he concentrates. He doesn't know how he does, or whether he pulled Cas down into that orgasm or Cas dragged him in, but he knows for fucking sure that they came together,
But he feels Cas smile against it like there's no cloth between them. Dean gets approximately three breaths to catch up on, complete with slow sliding thrusts into Cas’s hand when Cas laps at him again, and it's almost torture because it's so fucking good. Dean's fingers tighten on Cas's hair because fuck, Cas needs to do that again, right now.
Chuck stares at them, wide-eyed but bleary. "It wasn't supposed to happen like this," he announces. It's half accusatory, half awe.
Dean doesn’t feel his fingers letting go of the box. He doesn’t see the fork go spiraling off over the cracks, or the piece of rest stop apple pie that Sam must have gotten for him because he knows it’s Dean’s favorite,
It's creepy how close to their lives a lot of it is. Like... really fucking creepy. Every heartbeat, every streak of blood. The rip at the seam of one of Dean's favorite flannels, the one that Dean patched back together with yellow rather than dark green, because that was all they had left in the little shitty sewing kit that they haul around. The color of Sam’s jeans. The Legos in Baby’s heating system.
"Nothing," Dean mutters, and dredges up a smile. What the hell’s he doing? "Shit, no, sweetheart, nothing. Just looking at you, that's all."
Michael inclines his head—the body language is
It suddenly doesn't seem so far-fetched, the notion of a home that doesn't have four wheels and a combustion engine.
But Sam's all the way white, now, and looking hard and harsh. "Okay. Yeah,” he says, something dull in his voice. His eyes flick away. “I... I see what you mean."
Dean grins. "Look at you, callin' yourself a 'practitioner' now." He goes a little more serious, though. "Anything 'bout, you know, what other things they're gonna want to put in that lock to open the cage? Other than Lilith?"
Dean is not prepared for that: it feels like the emotional equivalent of expecting a step and not finding it at the height it should be. "Uh… something with a beat?" He reaches in and grabs something Zeppelin-like and shoves it into the tape deck. Cas gives a pleased rumble when Ramble On starts.
Dean's back knows every curl of the sofa and every pokey spring, so that's a ‘fuck, no.’ He clears his throat. Yeah, he knows what's different.
Michael reappears. He looks contemplative when he nods to Dean and then wanders off side-by-side with Cas, who’s already looking more pinched (and more like Jimmy) than normal. Possibly he’s already anticipating Michael asking him all sorts of embarrassing questions. Yep, Dean is going to enjoy hearing about that later.
Bobby takes a long pull off his own beer, leaning against his desk. "Are you juicing or not?"
break him like toothpicks—
Dean hears Jimmy yelp from the other room and then Cas explains that he's just warded him from angels, at least. Ah. The rib carvings. They should form a gang when all this is done. Dean gives Jimmy an anti-possession amulet for good measure and hastily draws a few devil traps in the most useful places.
But Cas smiles, very gently. “That’s true, you’re right,” he agrees, “So. ‘The important thing is not to think much, but to love much; and so, do that which best stirs you to love.’”
When Cas releases him, it's only far enough to get his lips on other parts of Dean's chest and neck. He trails the tip of his tongue back down Dean's clavicle, over the curve of his shoulder and Dean knows what's coming next, like a beautiful, fucked-out train wreck.
"You covered that bit already?" Dean slurs slightly as Cas returns to his lower stomach area—maybe a little bit more to the right, this time?
Then Alastair zones in on Dean, taunts him with all of the things he can't bear to think about. And Dean can’t think of Cas at all, not when he’s facing down forty years of nightmares wearing a middle-aged pediatrician. Until finally—
Cas is mouthing against his skin, sloppy and soft as he pants into Dean's neck, and the little rolls of his hips and the stutter of his breathing is making Dean's cock twitch between their bodies. Jesus, Dean thinks he could do this all day, and he's maybe starting to understand just why Cas seems to like doing it to
"One version?" Dean asks, hopefully
Dean might not know a word of Enochian, but the noise Cas spits out over his shoulder as he climbs the stairs with little stomps makes Dean pretty sure he just got cussed out in it.
Okay, that's really weirdly specific. Dean exchanges a wide-eyed look with Sam. Cas makes a small, gasping noise that might be a laugh, or a sound of horror.
Yeah, they’re fucked.
(Okay, shit, he's totally petty enough to say so.)
The demon laughs and opens its mouth. There's a streak of black smoke already starting to appear as it tries to smoke out—when Cas steps in and sandwiches it between their bodies, clamping a hand over its maw.
Dean sighs and puts those thoughts out of his head. There'll be time for all of that other stuff after, when his brain isn't pleasure-soaked and his limbs aren’t still tingly with orgasm.
It's the needle they were looking for in the haystack of all those books. Lock and key. They have a possible place, now.
Cas's eyes flutter open grumpily. "No. Where are we going?"
Dean straightens up with a little bottle in his hand that he found snuck into a corner of his duffel—sly angel snuck that fancy lube he had in his nightstand drawer in here, did he?—but he loses his smirk when he sees Cas is just looking at the wall, his expression serious and shaky.
Bobby's eyes widen a little. "That ring thing legal?"
Dean's never been a person whose nose is kissed, until now. He laughs a little shakily, himself, not quite ready to hear that he’s the person that someone ‘dies for,’ let alone ‘lives for,’ and dives in for another long kiss instead. Finally, they taper off, gently. Dean cups Cas's cheek and strokes the gorgeous arc of his cheekbone, gently, with his thumb.
Cas looks up and shakes his head. "I'm not... replenishing my grace the way it should. I'm not sure what will happen when it runs out. If it means I become human, well... I've been human. It has its upsides." He smiles, small, a little rueful. "I won't be as much use to you two, though."
He feels soft skin against his fingertips and realizes that he reached up with one hand to trace those deeply curved lips he was admiring.
Unlike most nights, Castiel finds his sleep easily. Unfortunately, it's fleeting each and every time. By the time he passes out from sheer exhaustion it's close to sunrise.
He tries to believe it when he tells her, "You're going to a better place." For her sake. For all their sakes.
Dean really does. It's just as weirdly nice as it was at the Novak house, strange and foreign and soft. Dean hands Cas a t-shirt—one of Dean's, because why the fuck not. He starts watching Cas peel himself out of his trench coat and suit and tie again.
The second, though, is Cas—or really, how to be with Cas without freaking out, because Dean doesn't get happy endings or normal life things, and he doesn’t have the first fucking idea how to have them. Maybe that's something he'll eventually be ready to start poking at, but not before Sam.
"Maybe when we go back," Dean says, sinking comfortably down into the pillows. He's wide awake a second later when he realizes what he's thinking about.
Okay, so. Check and mate, goes to Cas.
The twins sit quietly in the back as they cruise down the highway towards Bobby's, but whenever Dean looks up to check his rearview, there's
Rather than the escalating pain in his shoulder that he was ignoring, sweetness wraps around him, radiating from his shoulder outwards. A tingling warmth covers him like a blanket and Dean's head
Uh. Well, okay then. Color Dean impressed. And aroused.
it gives him a good look at Cas's flushed, drooling, incredibly excited cock.
"It's worth it," Cas answers, firmly. "It always will be."
They get suddenly shy, though. Dry humping to a screaming orgasm is one thing, but cleaning up the come is apparently another. They deliberately look away while they take care of their own spunk, uncomfortable looks on their faces as they stick their hands down their own pants.
Castiel has no idea what that feeling is, but he would very much like more of it.
Cas's leg remains pressed against his, but there's a sort of an achy sorrow that's coming from him that hurts Dean's stomach. There's no outward change beyond Cas's shoulders being a little more rounded or his face a little more shadowed.
Dean bows around it, around himself, around the blaze of heat and want and
The gentleness of it seems to undo something tight and angry in Sam. Dean can relate. Sam sighs and slumps forward into a chair, resting his elbows on his knees. "And what about Alastair, he—"
Dean doesn't even look up at first: he's too intent on carefully tasting the eggs set out for him, chewing thoughtfully before swallowing. (Cas also dropped hot sauce by his plate, because he’s effing
Uh-huh.
The hot tears sting painfully as they come down, and Dean's just going to spend a long time with red eyes. Fuck. He takes a few deliberate deep breaths, straightens his shoulders and wipes the tears away with his fingers. Enough. That’s enough. "Okay." He shakes out his shoulders. "Okay. Time to get to work. Gotta see you on your way."
Cas folds his arms around him, running his hands down the planes of Dean's back, and pressing just hard enough to rub at the tight muscles under his fingertips. "I've never done this, either," Cas says, quietly. "But I've wanted to." His voice gets small, right then, small and lost. "Jimmy and Amelia... I've watched them for more than a decade. I've seen what they have. I know it's not always perfect, but they know how to be angry and then come back together. I’d like to figure that out. Forgive me?"
When he finally looks up, his eyes look distant. "Interesting," he says, thoughtfully.
"Hey. Don't waste your grace like that," Dean grumbles, but he can't exactly say he's sorry about it.
Dean temporarily forgets how to breathe at the fucking glorious sight of Cas, his Cas, perched on his hips and pulling his own t-shirt off with one yank at the back of his neck. His brain short-circuits at the sight of all that warm, creamy skin. Almost every other time, they've been in half-dark, and besides, they've barely managed to get their shirts and pants open. Sometimes not even that.
Huh, yeah it would. Dean returns his smile. Second date or no, he has ideas for how the evening will finish out. "So, what do you think? We'll grab an early dinner in a few hours and then wander around a bit, see what sort of date-like trouble we can get into?"
Bobby topples his hand back and forth. "Drank some water. Couple of bites last night. Maybe get him to take some real food today. Not talkin' crazy anymore. Or any crazier'n normal."
"Cas," he rumbles. "What do you want?"
Dean shrugs, not at all ashamed of those marks or mourning their loss. He is a little embarrassed at the angry, upset feeling that he gets on seeing Cas use his grace, a precious resource, to help Anna heal the worst of her injuries, though.
"The guys who saved the world, I guess?" Adam answers, a little hesitant, a little shy. "I, uh, don't know what to make of that."
Cas pauses and swallows nervously; Dean figures it must be a habit from before. He looks up at the ceiling. His eyes are quiet, and the color of the Great Lakes in summer.
Dean clears his throat. He then tips back his head and pours the rest of the beer down it. When he lowers the bottle, Bobby's giving him a look that might, on someone else, even be worried. "It's, uh..." he worries at the ring, and thinks of the soft clink of Cas's against it before he heaves out a long breath. "It's Castiel."
"You're okay?" Cas asks. His eyes are searching Dean's face, his hand cupping the back of Dean’s neck.
"I'm bad at this," Dean eventually says, and he sounds so small and quiet to his own ears. "I can't think about that, Cas. I can't think about the future like that, not yet. I won't be able to—"
Dean looks away.
Dean presses back instinctively, nerve endings firing pleasantly. He doesn’t know when he closed his eyes, but he’s just fine with that.
"Thank you," Cas says, putting his fingertips on the edge of the bandage, testing the stick of the silk tape. His palm almost brushes Dean's fingers.
Oh, fuck.
Castiel’s not sure which one of them Dean’s talking to. He supposes that it doesn’t matter.
"Seriously, guys?" Sam mutters. "You're going to drink
Dean looks around a little wildly to make sure Claire has vacated the premises, because
"You think they broke you, Dean.” Cas says that like a weapon, like a challenge, but it’s a challenge Dean doesn’t know how to answer. “The angels thought so, too. They thought you would be… pliant. But your actions then were not those of a man broken. Even fresh-crawled out of forty years of the worst things Hell can devise, your goal was to find your brother and stop the world from burning.”
Crowley waggles his eyebrows. "Big things... small packages." He gestures up and down himself. Bi or not, Dean's gonna retch. "Be seeing you around, boys."
"That," Cas agrees, but he drops a kiss on Dean's cheek. "Would you like to get ready for bed?"
the plan—what is he doing? Where the hell is Ruby?
Which, well? Right now he couldn't give a damn. He's not a hundred percent sure how to find exactly what he should be looking for, or what it’s supposed to feel like, but he knows Cas lit him up with just a finger.
Even with that, he's still
, hunched over its neck. Like a bloodsucker. God, if he pops up with teeth Dean's done. That's it. Someone else can save the world.
Dean breathes out a long, slow exhale that seems to last forever, but it feels very, very familiar against Castiel's cheek. He's so close. When did he get so close?
They hit the local dive bar, get just a tiny bit tipsy, murder some yuppy asshole in pool, and walk out laughing just a bit. Dean feels a little lighter and Sam looks a little less shadowed. So it's only with a little guilt that Dean sends Sam off on his own.
Castiel isn't sure how to respond to that. Admitting anything means admitting that he not only entered Dean's room without permission (not a hard and fast rule, he's learned, but verboten when humans are asleep) but he also witnessed something deeply personal. Something Dean works very hard to pretend never happens.
There's laughter, light and free and contagious, and that's like a revelation.
He snatches the phone, dials, and leaves a blistering voice mail that if Ruby overhears won't tell her more than how fucking pissed and scared Dean is for his baby brother. He's not a fan of this plan, and he will try to pull the plug on this plan as soon as possible, but no way is he putting Sam into more danger because the little shit ran off and just had to do this all by himself.
Eventually he and Sam agree on a tentative truce, leaving the big topics behind. But it only serves to emphasize the other problems they're having.
Dean's always liked sex. It was always how he managed to connect when he knew there wasn't gonna be any other kind of connection, and they'd be moving on down the road in a few hours, or days—the next hunt. He got good at it, too. Someone happy under him, or on top of him, always made him smile.
"And I know you really believe that!" Sam tells him, soothingly. "Nick and I, we'll take care of it. You'll feel better once the siren's dead. Then we'll talk—did you know, Nick’s got a degree in clinical psychology? Maybe he can help. I don't think you've been dealing well." Sam's eyes are big and gooey. "We can't go on like this, Dean. You're going to get yourself killed."
He’s white through the lips and trembling with the effort and Dean knows he's just about out of juice, even with Dean's help, when he finally stops.
Castiel laughs, a little shakily. "Now
Even... maybe even... fuck, Dean can hardly even think about it.
Tears come too easily now, and he's heard they make people uncomfortable, so he swallows them. "No. No, it's wonderful," he rasps.
He feels Cas smile against his shoulder, the dry curve of it nuzzling along the raised edges of the handprint. One of those long hands curls around his hip, riding up against him in a slow, dirty roll. The other slides through Dean’s fingers, set next to Cas's hip to keep Dean from crushing him—he wanted to keep touching Cas, finding out just what's good for him.
Yeah, Dean might be just a little hysterical
Dean gives a second shaky thrust and Cas moans, mouth slipping down to sloppily kiss the bite mark. Yeah, that definitely feels good. Very good. It doesn't take much to find a rhythm that works for them.
But Dean's heart lifts, just a little, at getting Sam into the cot and not having to lock and bar the door behind him. “G’night,” Sam mumbles, and on another day, Dean would keep that memory for later.
Dean’s already been dead in this demon’s hands. And his skin burns and burns to think about it.
Michael looks at him. "It shouldn't be, not with this much grace in the mix, but I suppose I should get used to things like that." He takes a step back, probably as a courtesy "Though you might keep out of Fate's way for a while. She's quite… miffed at you derailing all of her plans like that."
Cas says, a little grumpily, "Take ibuprofen, not aspirin. Aspirin will increase your bleeding risk and will worsen the bruising and swelling." But he bends over and puts a little kiss on Dean's kneecap.
"What was the point?" Dean asks. Cas fell for the love and beauty of humanity. Cool. But he's also a soldier, Dean's seen that. And Cas's fall might have been basically the ultimate protest against his winged dick overlords, but the way it went, it was also, essentially, meaningless.
Cas kisses his forehead softly. "Whatever you need to."
In the lights of his little room, Dean's irises are a thin rim of jade around dark pupils. Dean's watching him go to pieces, and likes it.
Dean raises an eyebrow, as if to dare him to say it out loud.
Something in Sam's face clicks at this, but he says nothing.
Cas reaches behind himself to rest one hand onto Dean's hip, helping him with those last few shaking thrusts, and Dean loses track of everything but the slick slide of dick as it presses so sweetly into and against Cas.
"I didn't, um, specifically," Cas answers. "Um, I just said that we wanted to celebrate." He eyes the plates suspiciously. "I think that meant something different to them than to me."
"We can, though I think many angels don’t enjoy it. I, personally, find it comforting, and the lower our grace gets, the more sustenance our vessels require. Her grace is already low, and if she hasn't been cut off yet, she will be," Cas answers, neutrally. "So better she get used to it now. The molecules can taste very unpleasant if one's not accustomed."
Dean can't, he just can't. He falls forward, hand going from clutching the bench seat to braced on the foggy window, slipping slightly in the moisture. His hips are rolling hard, down and into the heat of Cas's body.
Maybe it’s the ‘please,’ or maybe it’s because they all know about deals that blow up in everyone’s faces. But Sam actually nods, small and tight. He and Ruby go off to research.
The little roil of miniature panic that's whirling in Dean's belly settles down. Dean stares. "
Dean's lips thin. He digs his phone out of his pocket. No service. "They didn't exactly grab both of us. So he's probably turning over Heaven and Earth."
Cas raises his head from the other side of the table and tilts it, curiously. Dean shakes his head and puts down the cup, and the newspaper. "Uh." He lies for a living. He could lie to Cas's twin. Right? And it's not like Cas would give a shit about it. Right?
But it does; weirdly, it does.
That should be that. That should be the end of it.
When he looks over, though, Cas has relocated the other half of the pile on the folding table back towards himself. He's holding one up in front of him, a little smile on his lips. Dean remembers, with a little lick of his lower lip, just how a flannel with almost the same pattern of blue background and thin white crosshatches looked over Cas's shoulders, covering his wrists.
This time, there's a bag of chips and another bottle of water wedged near him. No cooked food. Dean sips the water and eats the chips, mechanically, one by one. They don’t taste like anything. Sam peeks at him in the rearview mirror at the crunch and the crinkle, but, thankfully, doesn't say anything.
Cas squints at him. "No," he answers, looking confused for just an instant.
pairs of blue eyes giving him the hairy eyeball, now, not just one. Okay, that's not weird at all.
"Free passage," he says. "If, you know, Hell freezes over and you morons actually win. You just might be stupid enough to."
After an hour of watching everyone flipping through what few books they brought along with them, Dean fucks off to cool down. He's perched on the trunk of the Impala, a book in his lap that's he basically just staring at and not reading at all, when the crunch of gravel catches his ears. He looks up.
He takes a few unsteady breaths. Even with the air conditioning raising goosebumps on his skin, he can hear the rasp at the back of his throat. "I think I'm out. All I'll do is get myself or someone else killed and I know—" his voice breaks and it takes him some time to steady it again. "And I know that's not what you'd want. You’d be so pissed.” The laugh that rips out of him feels like it’s going to leave him bleeding. Because Cas would be pissed. He really would. “Cas, man... I'll try, but I don't know if that'll amount to jack shit."
Cas groans, softly. The muscles in his thighs ripple, but he holds himself so still. When Dean tears his gaze away to look into his face, Cas is chewing on his lower lip.
Castiel chokes out, "Oh, God, more than ever."
want to wrap him up in that trench coat of his and cuddle him into bed, though.
," Cas promises, smiling and sitting back on his heels. "Well, other than the ones you already have." His head tilts, and he looks genuinely curious. "Do you like them? Hickies?"
They settle down for a bit, just enjoying the afterglow. Cas deliberately spreads the edge of his coat over Dean's more naked side, tucking them into a warm, cocoonish state. Cas also, just briefly, nuzzles the edge of the handprint, and it buzzes contentment and satisfaction through Dean. He closes his eyes and enjoys the play of feelings—his own, maybe some of Cas’s— across his nerves.
The guy is obviously not used to being outmaneuvered. He's two parts hysterical and one part spitting mad.
—Hebrews 13:2, New King James version
"He fell the first time because he knew Heaven was wrong. And when he was forced to become an angel again, he immediately rebelled. He's been cut off this whole time: I know we mentioned that at some point. You know what that means?" Dean presses on. "It means he's royally screwed, and he did it for us. For humans. For you." He takes a deep breath, because yeah, that’s true, but it’s not the whole truth. "For me." Something chokes in his chest at saying it out loud. "For me, Sammy. He gave it all up for me. His grace is low at the best of times, and his own people are chasing him around the world with a kill-on-sight order. For me."
Jimmy looks ready to argue, but Pamela cuts him off. "He's not. You're worried and that's commendable. I'm not sure exactly what I saw in there, but it wasn't insanity, okay? I swear on your daughter's life."
The moment ends. Cas takes his hand away.
"The things that one learns about bodies, I suppose," Cas starts. "That your bow legs are congenital, not an effect of your childhood. That your eyes refract the light differently depending on your mood. That your right kidney is rotated just the slightest bit to the left. That your soul..." a hand comes up, and traces down the curve of Dean's side. "That your soul will never stop fighting."
Sam pops back in a few minutes later and Dean parks them in the right spot. Dean directs Sam to the bags while he leans into the back seat and runs a reassuring hand down Cas's side, meeting his pained smile with one of his own. Dean wants to crawl in there with him, hold him close and reassure both of them that Cas is gonna be fine. Instead, he helps him out of the backseat and walks him into their new motel room.
interesting. All that human soul wafting around you. You're right, you aren't a very good example of an angel, are you"
Cas's leg nudges him and Dean takes a deep breath, bracing his cock with one hand as he leans in... and finds, as the head of his cock pokes into Cas’s balls, that every instinct is just slightly off.
Jimmy flinches at that. But her words put a different kind of choke in Dean's throat, shit. He's not gonna be able to talk at all, is he? 'Cause he's never gonna forget the way Cas said, so softly,
Dean and the ME back-and-forth it a little, but the truth is, they have nothing and it's bugfuck annoying. Dean stomps back to their motel room to do a little more research, and to verbally encourage Bobby to stop dragging his ass.
Those all sound like good things, but something about the way Cas is saying that makes Dean a little wary. He looks down. "But?"
Oh Jesus fucking Christ, their weird new buddy isn’t just nuts, he’s a nerd. Sam's got company for real now. And Dean should find nothing about that statement Cas made at all interesting. But there's just something about the way his face lights up when he talks, the way his eyes are creasing at the corners a little—
He ends up getting kissed all over. Cas spends long seconds going from muscle to muscle, even in the spots that Dean natural fitness doesn't translate to specific muscle definition. For Cas it doesn't seem to matter: it’s like he knows where each bit of Dean's body begins and ends, and he unerringly, softly, says hello to each one. When it's Dean's turn, he'll just have to do it the old-fashioned way, relying on the mesmerizing dips and curves of Cas's alarmingly tempting stomach and hips. Maybe spend a little more time biting those hipbones...
She blinks at him.
Sam says, very slowly, "Wait. You... Uriel’s dead? Angels don't
"Pretty sure that's a lifetime job with no chance of retirement, Cas," Dean points out. Eternal job? Iniais was never much forthcoming on the details of angels, other than getting kind of twitchy and pissy every time Dean asked why he wasn’t helping.
"Your work?" Dean sighs as Cas's hands finally touch again: hands on his knees, gentle, warm. Then motion—sliding up so very, very slowly inside of his thighs.
Dean closes his eyes and savors the last moment of contact, one hand cupping Cas's cheek, gently.
Cas smiles, shaking his head. "I can only make breakfast foods," he admits. "Any other time I was shooed out of the kitchen, very promptly." He reaches out a hand to Dean—a little shyly, Dean thinks.
Dean isn't sure about that, these days, what with all the bullshit with Ruby and Lilith. Maybe he really is holding Sam back.
But then Cas talks to the proprietor in
with him, and God help him, Dean wishes he could  give him that. Dean’s not going to make a promise he can’t make good on, though, and Cas isn’t asking for one. But the other stuff? Some of that Dean can work with.
Dean has about two seconds to think 'To what?' before Cas starts riding him.
could, after Cas fingered him, and it was… kind of amazing.
Cas steps closer to Dean. They're maybe an arm’s length apart. "Lost track. Something went wrong as it happened. I'll need some time to sort out my memories more. For now, I'm not sure how to find it."
"Can't help it." Dean wiggles, mimicking Castiel's stretch. It might be mocking, but Dean’s smiling. "Had a great night's sleep."
and... Dean doesn't know that he'd even want to, knowing what they're going into tomorrow.
Cas pets his hair, gently, like he can't stand to let go any more than Dean can. His eyes are pretty damned calm for someone who just politely offered Dean the chance to murder someone, as easily as he'd offer him a cup of coffee. "I was not privy to what he did to you." Cas's jaw clenches, then relaxes. "But I saw what he wanted you to become. That you did not is a testament to you, but... he remains what he is. Hell's torturer. A demon. Don't you want him dead?"
And that, that makes Dean laugh a little, makes it easier to pull his head out from where he was
He thinks he sounds pretty convincing, but now Sam just looks worried. "That's it? That's all?" He waves his hands. "I thought you'd be saying something like, 'Finally!' or 'Strippers, Sammy! Strippers!'" He looks closer. "Seriously, Dean, are you alright? You haven't... um. Well, have you?"
"What?" Dean stands abruptly from where he's been slumped on the couch with his head flopped back, staring at the ceiling while Cas talks. "We've dealt with crossroads demons before, they're only out to screw you. And the last one went straight to Lilith! Why the hell would the king of them be any more interested in helping us than his little minions ever were! I mean, he's a demon:
not Adam, or maybe it's just the fact that Dean can feel that prickle of power on the back of his skin again. It gives Dean the creeps. "Thank you," he says.
"Hey," Dean protests. "Thought you couldn't read my mind in here."
"Castiel," Anna says, but she doesn't move. Her suit’s not torn anymore. Her smile is soft and bland.
Amelia is looking back and forth between them, looking bewildered. "Wait. Are you saying you two are... you're married? Oh my. Castiel, you didn't... was there a wedding?"
Dean is there in two quick steps. He wants to shove his shoulder into Cas's armpit and then wrap an arm around him to hold him up, but Dean is intensely aware of Sam standing right there. Instead, he opens the back door to the Impala and eases Cas onto the seat.
He closes his eyes.
Cas shakes his head and presses it back into Dean's hand, leaning back in. "I like that it protects you," he answers. "That was very sensitive of him." He sounds surprised. Pleased, though. Not that Dean can blame him, considering the reception he got the last time.
THE END
Chuck's description of Cas's entrance into the barn is actually a lot better than Inais popping up like a jack-in-the-box in Dean’s motel room. Cas, if the writing is to be believed, is a dramatic fucker and Dean has seen it in person, so yeah, the writing for it is probably accurate. That’s exactly how it would have gone down.
Sam makes a tiny choking sound deep in his throat.
Bobby also has an egg sandwich in his hands, and specks of it in his beard. "What d'you mean if it ain't real? Seems real damned 'real' to me, dumbass."
The flutters and squeezes start at Cas's
The first husband says that he loved his wife, and that he knew exactly what he was doing. That he's guilty. That means he probably is.
Tessa gives him an unimpressed look. "The one and only. Literally."
hurt him.
. He takes a step forward. Another.
Sam settles down after that. Dean's not sure which of them leans into the other or passes out first.
While no one’s home but the crickets, Cas leans in and presses a soft kiss on Dean's chin. Then another, another, slowly making his way up to the bolt of his jaw. His hand continues to trace the lines of the handprint before carefully aligning to press against it. He sighs deeply. "Oh Dean. I can’t believe that you’re real... I can’t believe this is real.”
Cas sighs, and leans his head back against the sofa back. Then he raises it and turns his chin a little to peer at it suspiciously. "There were... acts, committed on this sofa," he announces. He looks offended.
"And then go downstairs freshly showered and pink-faced…” he pauses, while Dean’s still holding his breath, “...and have
. This isn't a dream. It's sweaty, it's messy, it's so fucking hot, and the bed is squeaking loudly in protest under them as they thrust against each other.
coming from within Castiel's pelvis.
Dean scratches hard at the side of his neck. "Bobby, an angel dropped in on us yesterday. Anna." He looks at Cas. They can tell Bobby the rest of it later. "You're not warded.” Couldn’t be: Cas definitely didn’t have the mojo for it when they were inside Bobby’s wards. They’re not even sure that he has the grace to go that deep anymore even with Dean giving him a recharge. “The angels might be able to track you. And they know..."
Cas stops, then, and lifts his head just enough to catch Dean's eyes. "I'm not incapable of—" he trails off and chuckles wetly. "It was always you, Dean, and you spent so long as a figment of my imagination, I couldn't help but feel…"
Castiel blinks, and they're close enough that if they were any closer, their eyelashes would brush. "Brave?" he asks, and drops a kiss on the arc of Dean's upper lip. "What do you have to be afraid of? I'm right here."
Dean automatically takes the gun and checks it over. Ziplock versus fancy cloth wasn't actually what Dean was worried about, but okay, that's weird too. "What are they?"
But he understands, now. Not Dean--he doesn't think he'll ever understand Dean. But why it's important to walk away from things that he wants.
Dean laughs and gently bites the skin under his teeth. "You are gonna be great at parties."
Bobby just says, quietly, "Want some help, son? I can finish up here."
Or. Most of him goes limp.
Dean knows death coming for him when he sees it, he knows damnation, and that doesn't mean he's gonna run from it. He takes one step forward—
"I'm so glad you're safe," Castiel says, and the sincerity of it rocks him. He sounds like he means it.
Dean is sure Cas is wrong.
"Well, isn't this an auspicious group of people. I'm almost flattered." The accent is British and the voice is just this side of oily. The man is well-dressed all in black. Dean's no clothing connoisseur, but he can tell the tie is silk.
It's so automatic, the 'you an' me,' that the sound of the 'and' after it feels wrong for just a second. Dean doesn't know if that's him cutting himself off or if the breath just stops in his throat.
And then Alastair shows up, armed and ready, and ouch,
"BOY," Bobby snarls. "You better still be awake, 'cause
Jimmy makes a sudden lunging movement—so jerky that Dean's hand automatically slaps to his Colt. Cas starts a little, but just a little.
"Sam," Cas says, kindly, and with a little twinkle of amusement. "I may be an angel, but a very poor example of one. Also, I taught grad students at a liberal college. It will be very hard to mortally offend me with talk of doubt in God." He looks at Dean and then back to Sam. "In fact, I think the ability of human beings to balance faith and doubt is one of their more amazing qualities."
Eventually, Dean shifts the ring from his right hand to his left. No point in anything else now, he's definitely not planning on punching anything harder than a wall for the next little while. Besides, it's more truthful than anything else he's ever done. And if Dean can't be truthful now, when can he?
"S'that why I had to close my eyes?" Dean slurs. Having an actual conversation about this is starting to become impossible, even if Dean is finding he’s insatiably curious about anything Cas-related.
Cas's answer is nothing more than a low rumble that buzzes through Dean's body. It certainly feels positive enough. They stay like that for a few minutes, leaning against a table and each other. Dean is slumped and Cas is warm and yielding, but strong. They keep their arms wrapped around each other, a lot like that night in the Impala.
Dean catches sight of Cas out of the corner of his eye, lingering at the corner of the room. He felt the prickle of the angel wards going back up just a moment ago; he assumes Michael's headed off to do whatever it is archangels do when wandering the earth for the first time this epoch. Cas sends a warm look his way and a feeling of deep contentment, a little finger of amusement. That part’s a little new, getting specifics like that; it only started happening in the last month or so, but Dean likes it. Cas kisses the tips of his fingers, the sap, then moves off towards the second floor, and their bedroom. They'll talk later. They’ve already got the guest bedroom set up for Sam.
But he does it: swoops onto the road a little too fast, and pulls into the motel.
Dean's breathing is still shaky when he lifts back away. He tears his gaze away from dark blue eyes, and it’s a whole lot harder than it should be. "Cas, man, what the hell is this?" He can't not ask at this point. He can't pretend something isn't happening, because that would just be wasted energy.
Sam, beside him, is looking back and forth so quickly his hair is swinging. "There's... two of you? I thought..."
There's no possible answer to that that's not kind of insulting. But to be honest, Dean's more used to thinking of Cas as the kind of guy who nerds out with Sam and Bobby at the table over verb declensions and spent a good ten minutes lovingly describing an illuminated manuscript than, y'know, leading an army, so,
Ruby barely glances at him, all her attention focused on Sam. "That angels can't be trusted. Why should he?” She flicks her fingers towards Cas, but doesn’t even look at him. “For all we know, he's some kind of Heavenly double agent."
Dean looks up to tell Cas not to waste grace on him, but he stalls when he sees Cas's frustration and sadness at the situation. Now that Cas has a hand on him, Dean can feel how Cas thinks he's failed Dean in some way, like there’s anyone who should know Sam’s mind better than Dean himself. And, fuck, if that doesn't take some of the heat out of Dean's ire.
He hears Sam’s gargantuan feet come stomping back. He hands Dean their big first aid kit over his shoulder. Dean looks back to thank his brother, but the look on his face tells him there's something else to worry about.
"Actually," Cas interrupts, quietly. "It might not matter what Ruby believes."
Okay,
Suddenly, the only thing Castiel wants more than to keep rolling his and Dean's hips together in slow careful pushes is to taste that spot of skin just under the hinge of Dean's jaw.
Cas takes some sort of pity on him because that warm gentle hand on his shoulder slides down until it has Dean’s left hand. When he takes it, it tangles their fingers together. Dean prefers it the other way—he likes their rings to clink—but that's not really the point of this little demonstration.
Dean sees Cas's eyes widen, too, like he's just realized something important, and then he chuckles—softly, under his breath. "Your brother made some… unmanly yelps,” Cas says, solemnly. “He's trying to preserve your dignity."
Okay. The sex, Dean can’t believe. That, though… that, Dean can. His stomach drops.
that the department secretary doesn't have the hots for you?" Dean asks.
"Maryland," Cas says, smoothly, once he's translated the coordinates from the Nigerian Prince’s plea for help. Then he pauses and gets a faraway look on his face. "Wait." He pulls the laptop up and types quickly. "There's a church… no, a convent. I remember reading about it in one of my classes. It was a blip, really. But someone had put together a lecture about Theology and the Psychopath, and the circumstances were… memorably gory. I wasn't really interested, but I never put it together before now."
Cas gives Bobby a half-glare of a sideways glance, but Dean's not taking any offense.
Fuck.
"You are, you know," Cas whispers into his temple.
staring," he complains, but his hand comes up to touch the curve of Dean's hip, carefully.
He would have died, is what Cas isn't saying. For real.
But Dean calls anyway.
He's not prepared for Amelia to screech, and when Dean whips sideways, a middle-aged suburbanite woman tackles Dean at waist-level, knocking him to the floor.
you happy?"
They don't have witnesses. They don't have... anything, really. Just the rings on their fingers and the look in Cas’s eyes when he turns towards Dean.
Cas licks a sticky smear of caramel—and holy shit, Dean does not know how he made it, but it’s fucking delicious: Dean can feel it sticking to his tongue, his teeth, and probably his gut—off the back of his fork. Quietly, he says, "Sam's strong. And I honestly believe he did it because he thought it was the best way to prevent the apocalypse. Without that pressure, I don't think the temptation will be there."
"Well," Dean begins, slowly, "I think there's a good chance I might have to kill my brother sometime next week. I'm pretty much the poster child for marrying your one night stand in Vegas, except it's like I've known you my whole life, and that's also kind of freaking me out. I've just, this second, realized I kind of have in-laws now, and that's just not something that should ever have happened in my life. And to top it all off, you're dude-shaped, which honestly doesn't bother me like I thought it might? Like, at all? But I'm much more okay with it, because holy shit we are
Dean has the hazy thought that at some point, they've really got to try more than just rubbing up against each other. It's really hard to think of when or why, though, when even just doing this is so, so fucking good.
He turns. He'll always turn, for Sam.
Dean looks down at the envelopes in his hands. The top one is indeed addressed to Deanna Novak, but that's just department spouse mail. (Yeah, being a spouse on a form anywhere is still also weird.) The second letter is also from the university, but it's addressed properly, to Dean Novak.
Other days, he has moments where it's like he can't catch his breath. Forty years in Hell are nothing compared to, maybe, falling in love and losing it in the same 24 hours.
Dean and Sam both stare and exchange a glance. Is he talking about the board game? He might actually be talking about the board game.
get to give up like that." He turns to Sam, already gesturing for his cellphone. "I say we call Bobby. Screw his vacation, we get him back here, and—"
The conversation peters out after that, and they start to make a list of changes that they catch, for reference later. Once Sam looks sufficiently occupied, Cas slides the pages with Lilith back towards Dean without even a glance in his direction. Dean runs a quick knuckle down the outside of Cas’s closest thigh in thanks.
"You're both vasodilating very significantly," Michael adds.
"Seriously," Dean says, frowning. "Is this... I mean, does this even feel good for you?" He didn’t miss that Cas didn’t keep it all the way up, though he doesn’t seem to be having that problem now.
Amelia allows her a small sample of food before sending her on her way into the living room where Dean once patched up her dad. Dean's getting used to the kids’ cartoons spending at least 50% of the time on the nearest television too.
Cas opens his mouth. He doesn't say anything else before he closes it. Which just goes to show maybe he's not as socially blind as he lets on.
"You still want some water?" Dean asks, after a long, painful silence.
Dean breathes for the first time since the convent, and Cas smiles brightly. Dean’s injuries aren’t healed, but there’s a certain sharp bite that’s no longer there. The sneaky bastard.
New for him, too? "Awesome," Dean breathes.
Dean's gonna come, he knows he is, and he feels like he should warn Cas. His hand tightens reflexively around them both, warm and humid and slippery with lube, and that, just by itself, almost topples him. He whines against Cas's hand when he feels inevitability creeping up on him, tensing through his thighs, pulling his pelvis tight.
They managed to get just enough clothing on in the bathroom to make some pretense at not flashing the world before they made it to their bedroom... fuck. It really is their bedroom, isn't it? It's the same bedroom where Dean nearly brained himself over a USPS box and they both laughed at how dumb it is to trip over clothes—where he pushed Cas down onto his back onto the mattress, and just looking down at him like that, wearing nothing but a white button-down draped loose and open over his shoulders, almost exploded Dean’s brain with how hot he was. This is where Cas put him down onto his stomach, fingered and fucked him in pretty much every way except actually being
Dean's leg throbs and reminds him to get sitting as soon as possible. He looks at the sofa and, nope. Edge of the bed it is. It squeaks under him, but no springs poke him in the ass, so there’s a win right there.
"I'm not sure you should be poking around Cassie's brain," Jimmy says, shifting from foot to foot. "Cassie, you remember..."
Jimmy groans and drops his face into his hand. "Oh, no, you didn't just—"
He shoots a sideways glance at Cas.
Dean doesn't know what to say to that. For all that he's glad Cas is still
"Yes, Dean Winchester?"
Dean's toes curl, and he presses his knees harder behind Cas's, wrapped around him like he can pull Cas into his own body. "Cas..." he agrees, breathless and wanting Cas's pleasure almost as much as his own. He didn't think it was possible to get more intense than when they were in the car, but that doesn't even compare to whatever this is. "C'mon, sweetheart, c'mon—"
"Is it time to go have awkward family dinner?" Cas asks. "I think I'm hungry."
It's not good when someone knows him. It's really not good when someone knows
Sam still looks like he's gotten spooked by a ghost (and they don't take that shit lightly) when Dean and Cas come down: Dean in his flannel and jeans, Cas back in angelwear special. Cas didn't cook this time, so they're stuck with, well. Dean's not sure what it is. There’s some kind of meat in it. He eats it anyway.
"Is that like the reverse cowgirl?" Dean asks.
Dean wakes up slow, eased up out of sleep, and feeling... good. Really good.
"Michael," Cas growls. There’s more than a little angel intonation echoing behind it. "You weren't invited."
But Cas is curled over him, hands brushing everywhere. One hand is in Dean's hair, scraping just barely deeply enough that his nails tickle over Dean's scalp. The other is stroking over his back, his shoulders, his nape. He's warm and dense and alive, and he's murmuring, "Shhh, I love you, I love you," like he knows just what Dean needs to hear.
It doesn't make Dean feel any better, but it makes him more sure that it's really his brother he's looking at, right now.
Dean's looking down at him, though, and he's not sure if the expression on Dean's face is embarrassment for the hot column that Castiel can very clearly feel against his thigh, or anticipation, or fear. "Uh..." Dean mutters, and Castiel thinks he's likely just as flushed as Castiel himself. "Sorry, should... too much?"
Inias flinches. Just a little. "Castiel, don't make this difficult. Orders are orders."
Dean can't help but stare at Cas in the dimming daylight as they step out into the parking lot. Sunset isn't until after seven, but by five the light quality starts to dip, and it makes Cas into a picture that takes Dean's breath away. As they make the way to the car, the angel inside Cas is nowhere to be seen. He's relaxed and soft around the edges. With his collar open like that, he seems vulnerable, but in a good way.
On the back of his tongue, Dean wants to say "You don't have to." "Stay over here." "Plenty of room for two," with a little flirty tip of his head.
Sam works his way into the room like he’s casing the joint, all suspicion. He stops behind the couch, behind Jimmy, where he can get just as clear a look at Dean and Cas as Jimmy has. Amelia gets up, looking between the four of them, then coaxes Claire into her arms and out of the room. Smart lady. Dean relaxes a little now that little ears are gone.
"C'mon," Dean groans, because fuck if he's going to give it up this easy. But he hasn't got a free hand to work with, and last time, Cas took it upon himself to finish himself off. This time, though… shit, Dean’s getting desperate, here. "C'mon, sweetheart, d'you think—"
. With no permission from Castiel whatsoever, his entire body arches against Dean, and it’s delicious.
Cas shudders, moans. The hand hovering over Dean's shoulder wraps around him and they roll again, Cas wedged perfectly against Dean's hips, his arms winding up framing Dean's head. No one ends up on the floor; this king bed thing is awesome. Cas hovers over Dean's lips, eyes almost all pupil. "You are the best kind of trouble, I think," he growls, and kisses Dean like he's more important than oxygen.
"There better be a good explanation for this," Bobby says, sharply, before turning to Dean and crouching down beside him with a grunt that sounds like a silent complaint about his knees. "It's him, Dean. Unless you got a kind of monster that consecrated iron or silver doesn't cover, it's definitely him." Bobby pauses, and voices Dean’s own fears. “He’s not a demon, son.”
Speaking of not liking this situation. Dean grits out, "And you've got some goddamned nerve showin' up in Adam's body like that. Couldn't be bothered to help him out in life, and now you're gonna wear him around while he's dead?" Hell, if they're gonna get smote he might as well get out everything he needs to say now. Cas's hand twines into his left, the one that's not holding the angel blade. He squeezes, but it feels like solidarity, not a warning.
Yeah, he's pissed at the accusation. Yeah, this is fucked up. But yeah, Dean didn't exactly expect that he'd send an angel flying with a punch, either, so how could he expect Sam to get it?
The muscles of Cas’s back flex and bunch against his stomach, his ass presses back into the cradle of Dean's pelvis, and Dean's cock is so hard and so happy just thrusting between those perfect, perfect thighs that Dean might just die of it. They're both making sounds, just small, quiet little grunts and huffs, occasionally a muttered curse. Dean slowly starts to lose his mind to it all.
Cas raises a single eyebrow, but it's not a question, not really. It's more of an invitation. Well, shit, that's just annoyingly hot. Dean finishes taking his jacket and outer flannel off, folds them carefully and sticks them at the other end of the bench seat. He then takes Cas's hand in his—it's still electric, touching him, even that chastely—and pulls gently, tugging with the greatest of care.
"You aren't allowed to laugh," Cas says, crossly, into his shoulder, but Dean can feel the quiver of his lips, too. "It was
Saving the world hadn't felt worth it then. Nothing had felt worth it.
When he looks into the mirror the next morning and runs his fingers over the edges of the handprint on his skin, he thinks with a sick jolt that it might be fading.
(Cas finds out he still likes burgers and fries. Thank God, ‘cause Dean’s not sure all the angel mojo in the world would’ve been worth losing that.)
Castiel blushes bright red as he drops the stretch abruptly.  "You're too damn perky."
He trails off. Dean gets it. Sam’s warded, but not in the way Dean is: he hasn’t got Castiel’s name written across his tailbone like the damned Batsignal.
Dean doesn't know if it makes him feel better or worse that when Sam reads through the whole thing—it might as well be Greek, and for a second Dean thinks it actually
The confusion runs off into a wicked hint of amusement. "I gave you a ring," Cas says, running his thumb in slow circles around it. It almost makes the skin just above it more sensitive—tingling. "If I have thought about how it could benefit you in a fight—or how nice it might feel on my skin as you touch me—then that is just good planning."
Cas is leaning sprawled across the back frame, breathing hard, as the door clicks open, and Dean doesn't think it's the dark that blows his eyes wide when he turns and glances into Baby's dark, sleek, roomy back seat. "Oh," he murmurs.
She chews on her lip and says, "Does... so Castiel, he didn't... you're... Cassie, you’re alive?"
He thinks, abruptly, about what Cas said about how his grace is fading, how him touching Dean helps... recharge him. When’s the last time Dean even put a hand on his shoulder or his arm? How low have Cas’s batteries gotten? Why didn't he fucking
Cas doesn’t look all that apologetic. In fact, his eyes narrow—just slightly. Well? he seems to be saying.
"Guess maybe if things'd been different, I would have liked it better," he says, flicking the edge of the thick paper with his thumb. "'Cause they're different now, and it was kinda fun."
Behind him, Cas sucks in sharp breath and suddenly, Dean's entire body is aware of him again. "What?" he asks sharply, turning around
He looks gorgeous, flushed skin and bitten lips and pleasure written into every cell of his body.
It's a stupid thing to ask, and Dean knows it as soon as it's out. He knew the answer just from the tone of Sam's voice.
They really need to have a talk with Cas about sticking to the plan. Dean wipes a hand over his face.
Cas steps up next to him, calm and still on the surface, but underneath, full of pent-up energy that Dean can feel vibrating between them even though they’re not touching. "That was our assumption, yes," he agrees, coldly, but he doesn’t take his eyes off Michael. His left hand comes up and rests on the small of Dean’s back.
(That earns Dean his own sassy eyebrow and the suspicion he might pay for it later.)
"Fine," Crowley finally bites out, after an extended staring contest with Bobby. "Your soul for Death's castoffs, to be returned with all proper paperwork followed—assuming Lilith becomes demon paste, and you stop fiddling with the lock on Lucifer’s cage"
just goes and undermines the whole thing by returning the favor two hours later?
As much as Dean would love nothing more than to spend the next eternity tracing off every single droplet he can find, he slowly pulls away to put just a few inches of cooling air between them. Bobbly
One less lie.
Okay, Dean is sure he has a better poker face than that. That was one of the more intense experiences of his life, but he hopes to God he wasn’t walking around with that written all over his face. Dean ducks his head. "Uh—yeah, well—that really wasn't the plan, that... Would you believe me if I said that was his idea?"
(Then maybe… some other stuff he's been torturing himself with.)
Dean almost yanks Cas back. No, fuck, this is
God, yes, yes. Dean shoves himself vertical enough to bite the base of Cas's neck, just because he has to taste. Cas grunts and spurts twice more into Dean’s hand after Dean's teeth print into the soft skin of his neck. Cas shudders softly as he slowly lowers his body down against Dean's. Dean kisses the bite mark and watches it slowly disappear again.
Cas sends him a brief, achy point of connection and Dean rubs his chest and smiles, just a little. Through the wards, that had to be tough.
feel different than when Dean was on top, and not just because he's eating Cas up with his eyes—the way he throws his head back with a low moan, the little circle of his hips that Cas throws in there every few strokes like he’s specifically out to make Dean lose his mind. There's just something about the way Cas has to tense his legs and hips to pull upwards and forwards that clenches him so unbelievably nicely around Dean. The fact that Cas is riding him like a porn star is one thing all on its own, but that additional little tease of tension around Dean’s cock every time he pulls upwards makes Dean's eyes want to roll back in his head.
, focuses on the power that a death has in opening portals. Calling gods."
Cas hesitates. "No, I don't think so, but I don't care," he growls, finally.
Dean laughs—because Cas is a sap, but damn if that faith doesn't sound amazing. "That easy, huh?"
Cas stares at Dean and nods slowly. "A date?" He carefully puts down the items in his hands and then taps a finger against his lips. "Did you have something in mind?"
Bobby takes the long box from him. When he slides it open, his eyes go wider, startled in a way that Dean hasn't seen in a long time.
Dean nearly swerves Baby again.
Sir? Huh.
Cas raises just one eyebrow. "
He doesn't raise his head from under the pillow when he mumbles, "Not... actual wings. A blanket obviously can't manipulate time or space."
"He's alright, though. Cas. Kind of strange and nerdy," Sam says.
Cinnamon and syrup and tart sugar on his tongue, the flaky, buttery crust and the way the edge pieces crunched. Baby’s hood still warm under the back of his thighs in the late fall air. The way Dean tried to give Cas the last bite, and Cas wouldn’t let him. The taste of apple on Cas’s tongue, and the tight, sweet feel of his smile against Dean’s. The shyness in his smile when he called that their first date.
Cas bites him just that little bit harder, grumbling, but the momentary achy sting of it only makes the warm roll of satisfaction and pleasure in Dean's core coil tighter. And Cas's next moan trembles against the bite mark when Dean curves his fingers gently again.
Eventually, Cas peels away, and in the quiet they've carved out, he helps Dean out of his flannel and his boots and jeans. He follows out of his own clothes while Dean watches, already half tucked away in the bed with the cover sheet pulled over his waist.
Bobby gets started on the devil's trap while Cas paints on a few runes here and there. Mostly for structural integrity and some general safety. At least, that's what Dean overhears when Sam asks, and Cas explains.
"M'glad you're here," he mumbles. It's not what he means to say, but it's better than Dean's first thought—which was "I'm glad I don't have to do this alone." It's true, but it's not
Okay, they’re going to have to have a talk about doing insane, reckless things that can get them all killed. And Dean’s gonna ignore the glass house he’s standing inside with a rock in hand.
Okay, yeah, yeah. Dean doesn't know if it's the profound bond thing, or if it's just that they're so hot for each other. Shit, Dean sort of forgot how amazing it could feel, having that edge of wanting and anticipation without having to deal with the awkward dance of 'hi, how are you' and 'can I buy you a drink.' Ultimately it doesn't matter.
Cas kisses him again and again. Still soft, still slow, but incrementally deeper. Dean knows Cas’'ll stop if Dean shows the slightest reluctance, and that somehow makes it better. Dean lets himself be kissed and touched and it's like tiny little bits of love showering all over him. It's enough to make it easy to forget how to breathe. Cas stokes that tiny flare of hunger carefully until Dean is achy all over with something he knows is arousal, but it’s never really felt this easy inside him before.
And on another level, the idea of learning all these new things with Cas, their connection making everything feel warm and intimate and deep in a way that Dean never thought was possible? Having Cas touching him, inside him in pretty much any way? Christ.
Cas finally looks away and Dean feels like he can breathe again. "There are moments. Different times.” He shifts around. “I think I was in Egypt during the plagues. Also, Babylon during the great exile. Sodom seemed like it was a nice place before, well."
He leans in and nuzzles away a droplet that's making its way down Cas's temple from his flattened-down and still-wet hair. "Yeah," he agrees, in the same whisper. "It is."
Dean wouldn't be around to stop it from happening. And that's the most fucked-up thing of all.
with his knuckles.
Dean shakes his head. "Mad. Sad. All of the above, none of it." He shrugs. "Upset there's no body."
I think we've all guessed that another fan favorite is incoming. Have fun! We're fast approaching what would be considered the last 2 or 3 eps of the season.
Uriel smiles, and Dean knows he's stepped wrong. "I really hoped you'd say that."
One hand remains on Castiel’s hip, directing him ever so gently into a sinuous roll. The other forearm braces on the pillow next to Castiel’s ear. He’s surrounded on all sides and it’s delightful.
"Jimmy knew, maybe before I did," Cas whispers. "We shared a room for most of our childhood. He was privy to some of my dreams. And my nightmares." His head moves in a little jerk. “He was the one who would wake me up before my screaming woke up the rest of the house.”
"I wasn't sure you really existed," Cas says, taking another piece of chicken skin. Death pushes a plate of wings towards him, and he makes another happy little noise and scoops up a fried wing tip. "It's... a comfort and not, I suppose."
"Mmm, yes. I like it when you do that..." Cas cracks open one eye and gives Dean a small, dimpled smile that can only be called 'filthy.’ He drops his eyes downwards in a way that looks very, very intentional."And this way, you can watch. I think
Sam blinks, very slowly. "Uh."
Oh, yeah, this is gonna go real peachy.
He just came in his pants like a teenager, and it was fucking amazing.
Cas sighs and tilts back into Dean's touch. Like maybe he gets the same soft comfort that Dean gets, whenever Cas touches him—that awareness, that connection, that knowledge that this might all be so fucked up, but at least he's not alone.
He settles a knee on the mattress, and pauses for long enough to make sure that Dean isn't going to do something strange--like crow and shove him off it. Castiel still doesn’t always understand human jokes.
Dean checks to make sure his hand isn't too dirty before he links their pointer fingers together. "Ain't nothin' wrong with breakfast for dinner, I'm pretty sure that's what most diners exist for."
Cas tucks into his neck and his body like he can't bear to separate yet either, sliding an arm over Dean's flank and his knee and thigh over Dean’s hips His fingers cup the curve of Dean's back muscles.
Sam chuckles, softly, but he hangs Baby back up on the tree. Carefully, Dean notices, touching it with a finger before he walks back to the couch to sit down. "This is what family is like?"
Sam stares.
Once out of sight, Dean checks his phone, hoping Sam has given him a heads up about where to go. Nothing. “Shit,” he sighs, and starts stomping towards the door.
Dean and Cas take their glasses and Bobby lifts his. "To family, an’ to saving’ the world," Bobby toasts, and the three of them clink their glasses together.
"Only when possessed."
When Dean washes the blood and dust off Cas's face, though, he doesn't look peaceful. He looks... he looks worried and scared and in pain. He looks broken.
Bobby nods, tapping the glass in his hands. "That does answer a few questions.” He’s unsurprised enough that Dean knows that he’s probably been thinking about it. “Y’know, I wonder how immune you might be to various mind controls, now."
." Cas moves in a rush, and suddenly the shining arc of his blade is at her neck.
"Dunno how this got into my room, buddy, but I'm pretty sure it belongs here," Dean murmurs. "It's nice, though."
He shakes his head. "They were—are—very devout," Cas begins. "I was their miracle twin. Born on a Thursday, hidden behind Jimmy for all the scans. At least, that's how the doctors explained it. I know better, now. There's good odds I wasn't even in the womb for the whole nine months."
like he's pretty sure he never has in his entire adult life.
"Yes," Cas rasps. "Very much." He doesn’t move from his heavy slump over Dean's chest. Dean is just fine with that.
"No way," Dean protests. He nuzzles Cas's neck. His lips scrape against a little stubble. He's got no idea what an eternal being is doing with stubble, but he'll take it. It makes this all feel a little bit more real. "You kidding? You're rocking the rebel angel deal. Definitely..." and halfway through 'hot' Dean feels his jaw split in a goddamned embarrassingly huge yawn.
He still doesn't dare say 'alive.'
It's not urgent, but the anticipation in it is making Dean pant. He runs his hands down Cas's back again as they move together, but this time, he traces that line where elastic meets skin—back and forth, back and forth.
shit like that.
Bobby cocks his gun anyway. "I'm of a mind to shoot first and ask questions later, but seeing as how she's being so accommodating, let's at least ask her what she wants."
As it turns out, there are. Dean doesn’t even remember grabbing them in the store.
