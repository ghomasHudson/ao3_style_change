“You might want to wipe up a bit first” he said, as the t-shirt smacked Sherlock on the back of the neck and slid down his shoulder.
“In the interests of being a bloody nosy bastard, more like – that’s a bit personal, don’t you think?”
‘Hold your tongue Susan’ said the lady, taking my arm and leading me through to the parlour beyond, where the sound of gay laughter signified that a scene of much merriment was afoot. Gentlemen’s voices and young ladies too rang out beyond heavy velvet draperies of the deepest emerald hung by rings of burnished copper.
They dodged up and down a few more times giddy with their growing success, laughing together like they’d known each other for years. The boy, Sherlock he said his name was, had some sort of magical gift of knowing just who and when to make a hit, and soon his pockets were jingling with cash. And if anyone spared them more than a passing glance, they were just a young gentleman and his servant, enjoying each other’s company and having a lark.
This story is based on my most favourite Christmas episode from cult 1990's Teen Drama 'My So-Called Life' starring Claire Danes and Jared Leto. (Episode 15 - So-Called Angels).
He could see the anger flashing in John’s deep blue eyes and his hands clenched into fists at his sides, knuckles turning white as he squeezed them tightly. He couldn’t even meet Sherlock’s eyes as he muttered an excuse, a sudden need to use the bathroom or some such, as he hastily left the room.
“Laterz” he muttered, and turned on his heel, walking swiftly to his car parked, front end facing away from them, further up the road.
“You can get off now John” said Sol, with not a single trace of irony in his voice. John scowled at Sherlock, practically convulsing with supressed laughter as he looked on. “And take your friend with you, I don’t care whose brother he is, this is my bar and he’s underage you got me?” John hummed his agreement as he stepped to corner of the bar and lifted up the hinged flap at the side to make a rather hasty exit.
Weston looked at me slyly, and my blood ran cold in my veins. He looked gleeful to the point of madness, was poised to deliver his killing blow. “On a ship, bound for the America’s.”
But then why was my dear friend Tom here too, decked out as we were in attire more fitting for an Assembly room ball, the ballet or the opera?
“It’s not a sex club John for god’s sake although there is a private members area, but it’s easy enough to get off if that’s what you want”
“Fool, that you would think I did not worship you as I do”, I whispered softly to the air, for he was the universe to me, in truth, and all that was not him was as nothing.
“Yeah, I, know, it kind of knocked me sideways, out of the blue….but, I’d like to stay in touch, not right now I know, I can’t expect that of you, but maybe later on?”
I would be proud to walk on his arm this night, the only chance we may ever have to be open with each other in a public space. The frisson was undeniable, for others to see us together and to wonder, is it part of the game, the deceit of the masquerade? Or is it truth? And to look in their eyes as they imagine us together, naked and fucking in the dark. I pitied them their commonplace existence, these strangers I had yet to meet.
His boss, the footage from the club, he could only mean Doug Miller the owner and the big guy must be one of his sons. He thought of Irene and if they had seen them talking tonight… was it her? had she told them what Sherlock had asked her about? …but she had seemed so sincere, that she liked Sherlock, even cared. John felt slightly sick as he thought about their little encounter tonight. She had been quick to spill the beans, when asked what she knew, risky in the middle of the club where she worked, and after his row with Sherlock had been a convenient shoulder to cry on, materialising from no-where at his side at the bar, the promise of free alcohol and a sympathetic ear. And he had gone with her, without question, let her lead him right out of the club to her private room, pouring drink after drink as he lost track of time…..
I could not be sure, and I would not accuse, but Mary had been there concealed in the shadow of the door when John had held me and confessed his love, and if any were to expose us, I felt it would be her. But I did not wish to speak of it, and my lips remained stubbornly sealed.
“Of course not…more of a caretaker if you like…babysitting smackheads so they don’t o.d., wiping fevered brows, sourcing clean needles, and getting rid of any used-up shit, a veritable Florence Nightingale of the drug-addled underclass is our Wiggy”, he laughed hollowly.
John glared at Irene who just raised her eyebrows innocently, hoping to hell she would resist the temptation of Mike’s unwitting innuendo and keep her mouth shut. The very last thing he needed to imagine was giving Sherlock a good hard poke.
“Look, let’s just go back in there and choke down this meal so that we can bugger off and do…other stuff. I don’t know what Mycroft was trying to do tonight, split us up or something maybe, but it didn’t work, so maybe we should give him the finger so to speak”
“Let me help shall I?” Sherlock hissed, voice low so as not to draw unwanted attention “That I was anyone’s for the price of a gram of coke? What’s wrong Victor, did I accidently fuck a friend of yours without realising? Did they pay me? Was I good?”
Sherlock stopped dead, eyes darting back and forward, turning his head to look around slowly as John stood paralysed a metre behind him. Piercing eyes glared right through him, flickering up and down as if he knew John was there, could sense another presence in the room. Sherlock frowned and sniffed at the air, and John stiffened and held his breath. Sherlock was close enough to touch now, every freckle on his skin standing out like splatters of paint on a pure white canvas, and John could see it now, the difference, a deep purple smudge under each cat-like eye, expensive white shirt doing nothing to conceal the jut of his collar bone and the shadow of exposed ribs. He undressed, trousers dropped to the floor, to be kicked across the room in the general direction of the laundry basket. The shirt came next and John sucked in a breath at the sight of a patchwork of purple, green and yellow, the aftermath of one hell of a kicking by god knows who. He looked so frail in just his pants, young, vulnerable, nothing like the acid-tongued one-man apocalypse John had come to know and love.
John had never had much trouble with this class, a natural aptitude, Professor McGonagall had proudly said, and he would take that ,because praise from her was a very rare thing. He regarded the perfect willow pattern plate before him with a smug sense of pride, before changing it back into a grey Persian kitten with an idle flick of his wrist.
“Give it here, let me try” John padded over to his side still wrapped in a towel, fresh from the shower. His skin still glistened with a damp sheen, and the knot of soft cloth lay low on his hips revealing a downy golden trail. He caught up the strip of dark purple silk, bent at the waist over the bed.
John sagged a little, this was not good news, there was no way he had enough cash left for an extended taxi ride in the early morning traffic so that could only mean one thing. Guess who would draw the short straw and have to play influenza roulette on the Underground?
John’s hand squeezed harder and moved faster, and Sherlock couldn’t control the way his hips jerked forward, trying to push his prick up into that tight space. He just needed to move like this, instinct taking over his mind instead.
“Lots of stuff, sneaking out after dark, turning up drunk or hung-over to lessons, Hampdon you know about already (oh god, the weed and the threesome, surely it couldn’t get any worse than that?), fighting, getting high…need I go on?”
I shook my head, willing my body into calmness. I would speak. I would not leave such sweet words unanswered. I must try, I must. And so I began, tongue tripping but a little as the words that I held in my heart bled out. “That very first moment, on that very first day, it was not into my ear you whispered, but my heart, and it was not my lips you kissed, but my soul. I wish to stay with you always, wherever life may lead us, but if we should ever be parted, promise we will always return to one another.”
“A pretty little mystery Mr Worthington brought to me”, he said, his countenance open and bright, “A missing person would not normally come to my notice, but this one was fascinating indeed”.
“One night, just like this, not tonight, but soon, a woman will die, because Detective Inspector Lestrade is forced to suspend Sherlock Holmes after repeatedly turning up at crime scene’s high on cocaine and heroin. A vital lead is lost. Sherlock blames himself, internalising the pain, he gets worse. He never meets John Watson, there was no-one there to save him from himself”
“Oh no Sherlock Holmes, don’t you fucking dare try and push me away” John growled, his voice a strange marriage of anger and fear. He had to say it now, he might never get this chance again. If he had only told him last night he would never have walked home alone or been attacked and Sherlock wouldn’t have bolted and gone home to get high and then….no, he didn’t want to think about what Sherlock had done after that, but he could have a pretty good guess…
I could see our way through. Beams of wood criss-crossed before us in the roof space, and at the juncture, where one house met the other there was a narrow crawl-space in the brick. We went down on hands and knees, balanced carefully on the wooden struts, crawling and shuffling our way forward through choking dust and cobweb alike.
It was Friday afternoon, exactly 55 hours since John had last seen Sherlock, when he had stolen his mouth, squeezed his arse and sent him shuffling off to the tube station in an embarrassing state of arousal.
“Just stay there a sec” Sherlock wriggled out from beneath him and John collapsed onto the mattress, sprawled on his back until Sherlock pushed him over onto his side. It took a few moments to register that the crazy idiot had flipped around to bring them lying head to toe, well, more like head to…another sort of head. He had never seen someone else’s cock this close, long and dusky pink, a sticky bead of fluid gathered at the slit, bobbing tantalisingly right in front of his face, just begging for John to reach out with his tongue and taste.
He indicated a long kitchen table through a dividing panel to the left, a fold-back screen separating the living area from the kitchen.
His tone was soft, more concern than anger but it stabbed like a knife to my chest nonetheless. I had gambled our future on the ivory pipe, and in truth I must confess it would not be the last time I succumbed. But that is a tale for another time, so suffice it to say, that for now I believed in my heart I would never be so reckless again. And sparing me the need to answer him now, John crossed the threshold to his room and returned with a laden breakfast tray and placed it on the bed before me, fresh bread and cold cuts, honey and preserves, a welcome sight on any other day but which set my belly in turmoil once again on this.
“I rushed out last night because I got a phone call from Frank’s manager, down at the club. There had been a bit of a scuffle apparently, just some silly men being drunk and rowdy by all accounts, and a couple of the girls got caught up in the mayhem. He asked me to look after them, take them down to A&E for a once-over….nothing serious, just cuts and bruises and a sprained ankle, but they were frightened out of their wits poor loves, said they hadn’t seen any of those men before, not part of the usual crowd it seemed”
“Well , it was partly his fault if you think about it, he invited Seb to cause trouble after all.” Sherlock shrugged.
Sherlock paused, eyes flickering over the same few lines of text several times before he attacked the keyboard, typing out and firing off a reply. It had all been a blur to John, which wasn’t surprising when the main thoughts in his head were still
John took one of the drinks with a grateful smile and gulped some down quickly before it could spill over the side, chasing away the bitter tang of cherry as he glanced around. A group of girls were heading their way, bobbing and weaving through the crowd, Molly and three friends. John was just relieved it didn’t include Lisa, the girl that had felt him up at that house-party they had gone to when they first arrived. That had been a real eye-opener in every sense of the word
“Thank you dear, for your honesty. You meant well, I’m not angry, well not anymore, the time to be angry would have been last night when I found you here, but after what you both did for me on Monday I thought I should at least hear you out” she attempted a weak smile.
Her hand curled around my wrist and squeezed, and in that small gesture I saw the Irene of old, my childhood friend, my playmate, and wondered with sadness how we had ever come to this. She had not come here alone, for a finely dressed gentleman, in a style much as my own came upon us, his face still concealed by the mask he wore in delicate blue and silver with eyes that flashed beneath the same. He gave a start when he saw me, a spark of recognition ignited and I stared in momentary consternation that another of my limited acquaintance might have found me in this place. He was not of John’s set, or of Charle’s, older by ten years or more, I had not seen him frequenting St James, Pall Mall or Holburn, and then, by god and then, I knew, my final night in the brothel, the mysterious gent that had sat at my side and teased me for my innocence, the rich and powerful Mr V who Susan had insisted had ‘chosen’ me, a notion which I’d most emphatically rebuffed. And with Irene’s connection to that household, the circle was complete.
The train journey was dull in the extreme, punctuated at intervals by a flare of panic rising from his gut, it squeezed at his chest and made his breath stutter at the gaping black hole in his memory, the blank space where time had skipped over and moved on without him. It was supposed to have come back by now, according to the false reassurance from the doctor who signed the paperwork for his discharge, that with rest and time the chances he would remember were high, the likelihood of complete obliteration statistically negligible.
“On first name terms, that’s good, a step forward from what I’ve heard Sherlock, and does he know?”Victor snapped at him.
“You would have been fifteen then right? Some kid from one of the schools you got kicked out of was he?”
The blush was rather gratifying, a warm pink flush that crept up John’s chest and neck, mottled in appearance. He traced the skin with his tongue, testing the rising heat beneath the surface and sucked down hard enough to make him gasp but not to leave a lasting mark. He wouldn’t be that cruel. Yet.
“Wow, an actual tree-house…you’re so bloody lucky…” John said, as he pulled himself up, “if it was mine I would sleep out here all the time, even in Winter, with tons of blankets and stuff, and you could stash loads of food and supplies….and fuck me…that view…I bet on a clear day you can see for miles”
He was already wired from the events of that night, mind on overdrive as a faint buzz of alcohol still sang in his veins. Dancing in the club, the colour, the noise, and Sherlock….oh god…Sherlock. He should never have lost control, shouting like a madman who lashed out with his fists, and Jesus Christ his hand hurt, a cracked bone for sure, but no more than he deserved. He hadn’t lost it like that since his dad died, when black eyes and bruises were a weekly affair, but that wasn’t who he was anymore and it made him feel sick as he remembered the look on Sherlock’s face, the devastation and fear in his eyes….
He tiptoed back across the landing unseen. Sherlock stood in the middle of his room, oblivious to John’s inner turmoil, uncombed hair a wild tangle, still naked to the waist. His tight skinny jeans were faded and grey with age and wear, hanging open to reveal a sharp jut of pelvic bone and dark thatch of wiry hair, no pants. John stared, wide-eyed at this glorious sight – How the hell was he supposed to function today knowing just what that bastard had going on under that denim, or rather, not going on, as in – no fucking pants!
“Yes, right after I get us both into a shitload more trouble. I hacked those incident reports from Tuesday night. How do you fancy going to see a couple of strippers today?”
“So”, John said as he glared at the half-drunk man before him, swaying and gripping the edge of the bar to maintain his balance, “you’re the wanker who’s been chasing after my boyfriend?”
His stomach growled loudly, but he ignored its pleas. Tomorrow then, money and food, or before the week’s end they would all be cast out onto the streets.
“I’m quite fine you know…there’s no need to hover” Sherlock drawled, “just go and do whatever it is you normally do”
“Hush now”, he said, smoothing the hair from my brow, “there will be time enough for that…but first, I wish to take you home with me, our home, and fuck you on your knees, at the foot of the bed on the floor with your head on the mattress and the weight of me along your back…much more desirable than itchy hay in a horses stable that will scratch at your arse and make you sneeze”.
They were standing in John’s bedroom, bags and cases on the floor by the door and coats still on having come straight up as soon as the taxi they’d taken from the station had dropped them off. John’s mum was out, still at the office where she worked part-time, while Thursday to Saturday she worked as a massage therapist at a beauty spa in town. She’d left a message on the door of the fridge pinned with a magnet from a holiday to Portsmouth, it said she’d found some spare bedding and sheets and that she’d leave it to them to pump the mattress up. The aforementioned travesty lay spread on the carpet, deflated, a wrinkled mound of pvc, like the world’s crappiest bouncy castle, with a nozzle attachment on top and a rusty old foot pump.
“Circumstantial only, I’ll admit, but rather telling all the same don’t you think? Especially considering you have just failed to deny it...A predilection for underage boys Victor…Sherlock was fifteen years old…and membership of no less than three well-known London sex-clubs…any sane employer would drop you like a hot stone…you might want to bear that in mind…a word in the right ear and you might find yourself suddenly…unemployed”.
“You won’t have heard yet” Greg continued, oblivious of the rising flush spreading over his cheeks, “Moran and Anderson got a match ban for being caught out of bed last night”
“The hell I will” he hissed back. “You do realise” he called, walking carefully backwards as he spoke, “That while you’re here eyeing up the underage girls in tight clothes you darling wife is busy shagging your best mate”.
The waistband wrenched down and his erection sprang free only to be engulfed in warm wet heat which made his hips buck reflexively. Mycroft decided to give up at this point, basking in the rippling sensations.
“John, have a care, we will be seen”, I protested weakly, with no real resistance in my voice or in my actions.
“Why do you always assume it is something that I have done” Sherlock said with an exasperated sigh, giving up his filthy clothes as a lost cause.
The tingling and trembling sensations seemed to start right down in his toes, spreading up his body until he was a panting, sweaty mess, plastered against the wall, every suck making his stomach curl, as Sherlock pulled the orgasm out of him with each flick of his tongue.
“You’re kidding me? Don’t be sorry, when do you ever say sorry?”, John said, rolling off him to wedge his body between Sherlock and the wall, “it’s as hot as fuck actually, that I could do that to you….you were gone there for a minute though…what you thinking about?”
He made his way over, past tables of twittering socialites and city boys and dropped onto the seat opposite feigning a casualness that he did not feel, slouching back languidly, ruffling his curls with a yawn.
“I’m not trying to be, can’t you see that?.....But… why can’t you understand how much I care about Sherlock?”
John stroked around the sensitive skin, no longer afraid to push and probe as he circled gently around his hole. The finger slipped inside and Sherlock groaned as the muscle reflexively tightened around the intrusion, uncomfortable at first. He willed himself to relax. It had almost been a week since he last had sex with John and that was too fucking long.
Him and Harry always shared a tin tub by the fire, every Sunday night, and had done since they were babes, except now, instead of getting in together, she went first and he got the tepid, scummy dregs.
“Not as long as the one where I fuck you with a dildo while I’m riding your cock though” he added with a grin, just to see what reaction his words would get.
. I let him take me up the arse with his massive cock and I came so hard I saw stars – and you know what? I fucking
“Really boys, do you have to make so much noise?.....such shenanigan’s …and at my time of life too”, but neither of them missed the warm smile on her face as turned her back and closed the door.
Sherlock rounded on him, turning swiftly and grabbing his meaty lapels. He propelled him through one hundred and eighty degrees and slammed his back into the row of lockers which clashed and rocked in protest. He was already on edge, wired, and in no mood to be fucked with.
John leant against the kitchen counter, bottle of beer in hand, some Spanish stuff that someone’s dad or uncle or something had brought back on the sly in the back of a white transit van, probably on one of those booze-cruises to the continent. They needn’t have fucking bothered, it still tasted like piss, even if it did have a foreign label.
“Mr Chattergee and his family all escaped, unhurt, the fire started in the shop below, faulty wiring, electrical, Mrs Turner, next door raised the alarm, she’s a light sleeper and had gone downstairs for a nightcap in the early hours”
I was glad to be alone again, as the carriage pulled up at the roadside and we stumbled , only a little the worse for drink, up the stairs to our door. And soon he laid my fears to rest, for if ever proof were needed of his unshaken constancy towards me he gave it that night, as we laid together, stripped and panting in his bed, sharing soft languid kisses as the mark of our passion dried upon our skin in the aftermath, all thoughts of Mary forgotten.
Mike yanked the whole duvet off the bed, so he flipped him off before he buried his head under the pillows instead.
“I…appreciate your help Billy” he stuttered, feeling like an idiot. Billy, however, beamed back at him.
John had left on foot so he couldn’t have gone too far, she thought, pulling into a space on the highstreet, the paths still busy with late-night Christmas shoppers. She searched the crowds eagerly, looking for his thick green parka, the implications of what could happen if she didn’t find them both tonight weighing heavily on her mind. A skinny boy with a guitar almost collided with her as she turned the corner, moving off the main street, back towards the police station.
John leaned in close, hot sweet breath with the slightest tinge of alcohol, spoke right into his ear.
‘I was not of age when he passed, and so the task fell to a government appointed lawyer, for you see he had many debts outstanding and so all his remaining assets reverted to the Crown’
now?” Sherlock smirked appearing magically at his elbow, sliding a hand around his waist and dipping down below the waistband of his trousers to stroke his fingers along the globe of his arse. It did nothing to ease the burgeoning erection pressing ever more insistently at the front.
My God, thought Mycroft, wherever did he learn such tricks? Quite frankly, he never knew quite whether to be appalled or impressed at the sheer ingenuity of the boy. Whatever the obstacle he would find a way around it…if only he applied the same diligence to his emotional affairs.
Two in quick succession, one on each side, heavy blows that rattled the teeth in his head as white spots danced in front of his eyes – it was pure ecstasy!
He had a vague recollection of the day before, collapsing in the kitchen, Mike helping him to bed, then putting all their new-found medical knowledge to the test, until John felt thoroughly….examined. Mike had even strapped his fingers, left pinky and ring, against his better judgement he was quick to maintain. But John was determined, to be treated off the record and refused point blank to go in for an x-ray, his point being, the doctors would have done exactly the bloody same.
How the hell did his life end up like this? And even with the baby on the way, the future, to John, stretched out like a black, cavernous void.
Sherlock sighs and sits up on the bed. He waits for a minute for the bright white lights to stop popping in front of his eyes before he leans down to pick up a crumpled ‘The Cure’ t-shirt and a pair of artfully ripped black jeans.
John for his part encouraged what others would see as the grossest folly, chasing shadows of the past with an ever increasing urgency. For our situation was most fragile at this time, his father making good on his threat to cast John off, our very future hanging in the balance, as the pot of money dwindled and we did our best to eke out the very last of John’s allowance.
And true to his word we did try again. Although first, to my dismay he dressed and left me for a while. I felt abandoned, despite his every assurance that he would be gone only a short time and then he would join me in bed again. I curled up tight within the folds of a thick woollen blanket. It was hot and stifling, but I cared not for I was miserable and wished him to know it, and so sulked like a child, nursing my wounded pride and a sore arse.
“Well aren’t you just the sweetest thing my love”, she said, pinching my cheeks between plump fingertips, “fresh from the country and innocent as the day you were born. Take off your hat…oh yes…shake out those curls…oh, you fair take my breath away young sir and lovely manners to boot, you will do very well for my gentlemen. How would you like to come home with me dear? I have lots of young nieces and nephews and I think you should get along very well?”
They sat like that for hours, until the light faded and the rain finally stopped, the material of John’s jumper damp against his skin and stretched beyond repair from Sherlock’s iron grip. John stroked the curls back from his face as Sherlock fell into a fitfull doze, breath hitching just like Harry’s used to, when she was a baby and cried herself to sleep after some massive tantrum.
Shit he really was pissed and his mum would definitely kill him, and John too if she got her hands on him. He could only hope that Mrs Watson wouldn’t mind him crashing on John’s bedroom floor like they had done almost every weekend since he was a child, until John had left school and buggered off to Uni two years ago.
“You are a bloody idiot, you do know that don’t you?” John reached between them and laid his left hand on Sherlock’s right, squeezing gently.
The next part made his fists itch with the desire to march over there and sink a right-hook into the man’s finely chiselled bone structure. He had a hand on John’s thigh under the table, drawing slow deliberate circles, up, up, until he hovered just below his groin. Above the table, behaviour was normal as they sipped on drinks and chatted about rubbish, the only visible signs, to Sherlock at least, were the twin pink stains on John’s cheeks. Sherlock looked closer at the man by his side…lover? A hook-up? The body language suggested that this wasn’t the first time they had met here, so close to John’s workplace, how maddeningly convenient. The most disturbing thing about this however, was the dark wavy hair, artfully tousled in almost a carbon copy of his own.
The thought of dragging John out onto the terrace and ramming his tongue down his throat as soon as he came through the door made Sherlock feel light-headed with lust. Oh god, he could barely breathe he was so fucking keyed-up and horny, and it was going to be at least another three or four fucking hours before he could peel off those clothes…
John saw my face fall, and pressed his palm to my cheek. “It is safer this way. We cannot risk the judge love. We have a life to live out, a future to build together. We will find your brother Mycroft and we will all depart to the country. London will never be safe for us, there are too many expectations, conventions, it is best that we should leave, visit France perhaps, or Italy.”
“Yes, that’ll be after I’ve been condemned to eternal hellfire for my unnatural urges the homophobic old bastard….I really don’t care”, he flopped down heavily on his bed, until Victor began throwing random items of clothing at his head.
He looked at his watch for the fifth time in the last half hour, it was only eight o’ clock. He would just have to take a very long shower, until his skin turned all pruny and the bathroom was completely steamed-up, and not, under any circumstances, would he think about John.
But even that was preferable to the utter humiliation of Mummy phoning Angela Watson, John’s mother, to beg an invite on behalf of her socially awkward son.
John lifted his head only long enough to answer and then dived back down, moving down Sherlock’s body to nip and suck hard on a nipple. Sherlock let out an ‘Ah’ of surprise and John did it again, harder this time, biting and pulling with his teeth as Sherlock writhed underneath him.
John clenched his teeth and counted to ten, slowly, but he had reached his limit and just couldn’t let that one pass (oh for fuck’s sake)
I swear I must have slept a little, lulled to sleep by the heat of the bed, for in what felt like only moments he had returned again, peppering the top of my head with kisses, the only part of me left exposed.
“I could sit that dance out could I not? An opportune moment for a turn in the gardens perhaps, or to take some refreshment….or find an altogether different way to be entertained…”
It really was too tempting Sherlock thought, stepping up behind him and whipping the towel away as if that had been the plan all along.
Besides, he ‘likes’ Irene, well, for a given definition of like….he can stand to be around her for more than five minutes at a time.
“Well go through and keep Mike company, god knows your sister is precious little help in that department, I think she’s surgically attached to that damn phone” she bustled back into the kitchen not realising how much it pissed him off that Mike was invited for dinner when she had been so rude and dismissive of Sherlock last night. But that wasn’t Mike’s fault, and he was John’s friend too. He plastered on his best fake smile as he walked into the living room.
“Yer a wizard Harry” John said one afternoon in his best Hagrid impersonation, and Sherlock just frowned at him and said “John, what
“Bastard”, said Sherlock wriggling beneath him. He groaned again, the friction against the covers and the pressure of John’s arse must have been driving him crazy. He was young, he could cope, and it would teach him a little patience John thought cruelly, unable to focus much beyond the thought of that piercing rubbing over his cock. They swapped places and John sat with his back against the headboard, legs spread so that Sherlock could wriggle between them.
“Did you have something to do with this?...Did you? You fucking smarmy bastard…cause if I find out you did mate I’ll fucking kill you!”.
“Aye, passengers an ‘all….listen lad”, he said, lowering his voice and moving closer so he would not be overheard, “Billy said was you was after, and that copper already bent my ear last month, and I don’t recall no boy by the name of Sherringford. Bloody hell lad it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack after all these years”.
“Yeah okay….we thought we might go to the Red Lion for a decent pint to celebrate our prize-winning cocks….You up for it?”
“Sherlock, did that bloke….that creep…did he touch you?” John whispered nervously as the interior of the cab was bathed in flashes of colour and light, moving through the busy streets. Sherlock wriggled against his side.
John made it back from the lockers in less than two minutes, but it still wasn’t fast enough. The bathroom was empty, Sherlock had already bolted and gone.
That voice, that ridiculous, deep, arrogant, dismissive voice, still as cool as fuck with a fist on his cock and a cock up his arse. Maybe a gag next time, or stuff something else in his hole, John thought, as he shoved him even further up the bed. Ah god, they were both
Right, he was definitely reading John’s mind, or just reading him, exactly the way Sherlock did – oh fuck! Mycroft smiled graciously and ran his fingertips sinuously up and down the curved walnut handle of a very expensive looking umbrella.
In one swift move he could push up on Sherlock’s thighs and roll his body back and just….just…shove his cock in and…fuck him.
Sherlock might believe that he couldn’t be dependant after so short a time, but John already knew that matters like this were never so clear-cut. He could tell that Sherlock was clearly in need of a hit, of what exactly, John didn’t know yet. A sense of fear and regret pervaded his mind at the thought of the immeasurable damage wrought by only a week apart. What if he couldn’t help him? Or what if Sherlock couldn’t stop? Because a simple promise just might not be enough.
“Really?” John whispered uncertainly in his ear “Doesn’t she know I’m just some slum-kid?....Why would she invite me for lunch at your fancy house?”
“Shit” he felt the bed dip again as John scooted over to rifle through his trouser pockets. Lube, of course. They had left it unspoken between them when they set off tonight, as to whether they would fuck each other here or wait until they got home.
“No, I expect not. So, if we were to….keep doing this…whatever we are doing…you would be okay with it…everything I mean…?” Sherlock trailed off.
“For god’s sake John, you are utterly transparent sometimes…we were never involved in the way you seem to be imagining…Billy Wiggins is a 14 years old runaway for god’s sake, that’s why he’s so hard to keep track of, he can’t afford to be caught by police or the Social Services Department”.
“Er…and what exactly have you done Sher….I mean…..boy…?” John stammered, clearly flustered now as he gulped nervously around the obvious knot in his throat.
It was John’s turn to lean, propped upright with one fist in his mouth to stifle his cries and the other fisted tightly in Sherlock’s dark curls, a mixture of comfort and pain. John’s cock felt hot and heavy under his tongue as he licked the first long stripe from base to tip, tasting the velvety skin, not caring where John’s cock had just been. He sipped at the head and his lips suckled gently, Sherlock’s own special lollipop, salty and bitter as sin.
“No” he heard his own voice form the words, dragged from his subconscious, “I’ll tell you anything you want, take me in, question me, just keep John out of it”.
The first step he took sank him down past his ankles, the fresh snow not yet compacted and dense. John hoped Sherlock had managed to get home quickly, a few paces in this stuff and those canvas shoes he always wore, even in the dead of winter, would be soaking wet. He tried not to dwell too much on the reason why he had bolted from the house to venture back out into the freezing cold. John had been planning to ask him to stay over all along, like they used to, bunking up together and talking all night about rubbish, or whatever experiment Sherlock was working on that week. What if they could still do that, Sherlock stay over for the night? Well apparently they wouldn’t be doing an awful lot of talking this time…probably.
His hand moved of its own volition to rub at the faded, lumpy scar tissue and he jerked it away, reflexively when his fingers brushed over smooth, undamaged skin. Now he must be dreaming, drugged or in some sort of trance, because there wasn’t a day went by that his heart didn’t ache at the memory of that day, and the friends he had lost.
“Incorrigible”, I muttered to myself. I threw him my most withering glare as we continued on our way to the Bridge Inn on Broad Street where we were expected at one.
Hang on, what the fuck was this? John could only stare in consternation, aware that his mouth was hanging open slightly. Since when had asking a couple of girls a few questions turned into buying fifty quids worth of illegal substances from god knows who, he would kill Sherlock for this, the mad idiot. Maybe that was why he conveniently hadn’t mentioned it, because he knew fine well John would go bloody apeshit, the dick!
Victor shifted uncomfortably beside him and tugged at the belt of his jeans, “Come on Sherlock, it doesn’t matter, just forget it, let’s just get a bottle from the offy and go home”.
Sara was obviously not ready to let go of her anger just yet, but it was important to get this all out. John still hadn’t worked it all through in his own mind yet.
Irritated beyond belief he rummaged on the floor for his filthy t-shirt, pants and jeans. The pants were beyond redemption so he screwed them into a messy ball and shoved them into the pocket of his grey hoodie – going commando it was then! John’s phone was lying in a tangle of bedclothes. Sherlock picked it up delicately and placed it on the pillow where John would see it when he entered the room, then he searched on the floor for the discarded condom. He found some toilet paper in John’s tiny ensuite shower room and wrapped the rubber neatly before depositing it in the bin. He eyed the shower longingly. It would have been nice to wash, soaping the night from his skin and hair, pressed close in the small space with John, touching each other, skin on skin.
Not that he minded much, they would just fuss and say how tall he’d grown and how the young ladies must be swooning at the sight of such a handsome young man. Did they really do that? The habits of fainting females were not really his forte.
“Now, what was so important that it almost came before this?” Greg’s gravelly voice rumbled in his throat.
They were going to Oxford Street he was sure. His skin prickled with excitement at the thought of such a gathering of human life. Oh, there would be trees and decorations and baubles galore, but the people…Sherlock loved to watch, and guess at their lives from the way they tipped their hat or in which pocket they stowed their gloves. He would know the profession from the cut of a suit or which hunt you rode for by a smear of mud on a riding boot.
Generic dance music thumped out from the house as Sherlock stood on the doorstep, undecided whether to just walk in or not. No-one would hear the bell if he rang it, and the Watson’s wouldn’t think he was rude or presumptuous, after all he had spent much of his childhood running around the place with John. But he stood there, nonetheless, not sure what the rules were now, if there were any, that is, finger poised over the button with his left hand, bottle of vodka clasped tightly in his right. He shivered despite his long coat. The weather would decide for him soon anyway, as fat white flakes of snow slowly drifted down, instantly coating the ground around him and settling in his dark curls.
It was still quite early when they left the house, the early autumn sky still suffused with the orange glow of a sun that had yet to set as they walked the short distance to the high street pub. John’s mum had made dinner, just a light plate of pasta and a shop-bought sauce, but he ate it, just to be polite and to line his stomach for the night to come. Mid-meal the front door slammed shut, Harry on her way out without even saying goodbye. Sherlock knew why. She didn’t quite trust herself not to give the game away in front of her mum.
“I think Mycroft could probably arrange that actually…..’Sherlock Holmes, prolonged exposure can lead to death or serious injury”
‘Hush now’, he said with a smile, ‘For the whole house will soon know just what we are at… perhaps I should find a way to quiet you’.
A rectangle of light arced through the air and connected with a splash, sinking down into the swirling black water of the Thames.
“A knife…the other bloke was a fucking weapon…he used his boots and his fists mostly, I was cornered, they didn’t need anything else”
She glanced down. “That’s the fifth time in the last five minutes darling….somebody loves you” her eyes flickered over to John again as she licked her lips suggestively, coquettish persona firmly back in place.
The lights were out, pyjama pants and sleep-mussed hair suggested he and just knocked Victor out of bed, but he hadn’t been asleep for long, the lingering smell of brandy on his warm breath as they stood, just a little too close, just inside the living room, Sherlock’s back against the wall, still panting a little after his energetic burst up four flights of stairs.
John arched a brow in confusion at my frown, and spun on his heel to wonder at the cause of it, and to my consternation he smiled, wide and genuine, answering her greeting with a wave and a sweeping, theatrical bow. I knew him to be unfailingly polite and amiable to all, though I wished in my heart, most unkindly that he would cut her off with a few harsh words as he had to the hoary old baggage who had propositioned me most impolitely. I wondered if Mary would like to know of the size of his cock, and in whom he loved to stick it, and toyed with the idea for a moment of relating the salient facts most explicitly. However I did not. More’s the pity.
I bit down on the skin of my lip, worried he must find me very gauche when I answered with a negative, but no, the news pleased him greatly and encouraged, his hands wandered freely over my body pushing up beneath my undershirt with soft touches, squeezes and pressures. You might think this would alarm me, but the novelty of his touch provided more of warmth and comfort than shock. All the while he flattered and praised me as a bribe to my passiveness, conducting my own hands to the hardness of his masculine chest coaxing them to explore the musky down-covered skin and the erect peaks of his nipples.
“But it looks like you got caught up in it a bit, I bet it was fucking terrifying…I mean, look at your face, the bastards”
“Alright, you’re a tricky one, young man, but here it is….my name is Mabel, and I’m tasked with showing you how wonderful you are, but quite frankly, after less than five minutes in your company I’m beginning to think I got the shitty end of the stick, so to speak, the other one would have been so much easier I imagine…” she trailed off, looking thoughtful “No matter, I picked you, so tuck your scarf in, it might get a little breezy and it would be a terrible shame if you were to accidently choke yourself” she chuckled darkly as the wind whipped around them, kicking up dust and debris which made him squint and place a hand over his face to protect his eyes, pressure squeezed his body and turned him inside out, before releasing him with a pained gasp on his hands and knees on a rain soaked street cordoned off with police tape.
Sherlock waved him away with a flick of the wrist and flopped back down on the dirty mattress, facing away from him. Sulking again, angry at John for no reason at all that he could see.
Mycroft arched a brow as if to say ‘are you really so stupid?’, and smiled, a rictus grin. “To ruin your chances at Cambridge, to embarrass the family, threaten my position in government” this final reason was thickly laced with venom. Sherlock almost felt sorry for this unknown person, they obviously had no idea what Mycroft was capable of, splinter’s under the fingernails if they were lucky, or if Mycroft was feeling particularly generous some impromptu root canal work, minus the aneasthetic.
John stepped back to watch as Sherlock shimmied up the rope the rest of the way, moving swiftly hand over hand to the top. He leapt, cat-like over the edge and stood up again.
He scrambled backwards and sat at the end of the bed panting, feeling ridiculously guilty for no reason.
“You’re thinking about it” Sherlock whispered in his ear, snaking out the tip of his tongue to trace along the outer edge… “about doing me right here, where everyone can see, aren’t you?…”
‘Hey, here’s one for you. Check this one out, bloody perfect.’ Mike crowed in triumph, breaking through John’s dive into self-pity, and presented the page to him with a flourish, failing to notice John’s grimace of discomfort.
With the word ‘tip’ Sherlock had hooked a hand into the belt of his jeans and slowly pulled him down. He really was on top of another boy, one who was stripped to the waist and was spreading his legs out so John could lie between.
“Well, apparently not, according to popular medical opinion”, Sherlock sighed and let go, “although there does seem to be a bit of a problem…”
“Sherlock?” John asked, seeking my consent, and I nodded to him curtly while Mary looked on triumphant and knowing, and her young friend, a timid little thing, hovered at my side in expectation. I rolled my eyes and stuck out my arm to her, not wanting to dance in the least, but not wanting to lose sight of John in this place. I imagined him giddy from the dance and drunk on champagne following after this siren to some dark secluded corner where she would entice him, touch him, give herself over and lift up her skirts, as if she did not know, as if my regard for him meant nothing to her. I could not rise for a woman, but I knew John had done, many times. And though I had faith in his love, I feared this.
Sherlock pulled his cock-head out and he felt warm liquid dribble down his thigh, Sherlock’s seed, his body’s evidence of how much he wanted John.
New Scotland Yard had been transformed into a veritable ‘Winter Wonderland’ of inebriated elves in microscopic skirts, with DCI Gregson as an extremely pervy and sinister looking Santa Claus. He could sense a sexual harassment charge on the horizon, if that hand up Donovan’s dress was anything to go by, and it wasn’t even ten o’ clock.
“Stop being such a bloody drama queen and just try and enjoy yourself, this is supposed to be fun” and with that he took off again, putting his trust in Sherlock’s innate sense of self-preservation, not to pull them both off onto the ground.
He had the right of it. It would serve no good to speak with her here, or in any place really. I could not blame John for bringing me here to this part of town, for how was he to have known that which I hadn’t known myself, that she was here in this place all along?
A few curious, dirty faces peered out at them as they climbed down from the carriage, father with his bag in hand, every inch the imposing and eminent Physician. The driver sat nervously waiting, wary of the dirty and curious urchins gathered around, inching forward to see the fine horse and the posh gentleman. They were the curiosities here, in this place that Christmas had failed to touch.
Sherlock hates this song, but he dances with John anyway when he pulls him out to the middle of the floor, and as they pass under the mistletoe they kiss, with plenty of tongue because John is a little bit drunk and he is more than a bit stoned.
Victor shrugged “Of course, I wouldn’t have expected anything less from big brother, still trying to protect your virtue is he? Well we both know that’s a lost cause, don’t we?”
Side by side now, John could feel the intensity of body heat radiating out and the insistent press of hard flesh against hard flesh. He shuffled closer still and wound his arms around Sherlock’s slender waist, sliding his right hand down to gently squeeze and knead a generous handful of arse cheek.
John snapped back to reality and realised he had been sitting there for god knows how long, completely mesmerised, just holding on to Sherlock’s hips, staring at the erection which quivered slightly in front of his face with every dip and shift of the bed. They couldn’t pretend not to know exactly what had caused this, and he didn’t think he could possibly put this into words, but he had to try.
With the benefit of hindsight you can say one always knows better, but for now I was entranced, allowed finally to join them in the receiving room on the understanding that I was not for any man to lay hands on, but to be seen and desired the thought remaining that they may as yet be amenable when I be made freely available to them. Mrs Turner, ever resourceful and keen to have me set to work had secured the consideration of another fine gentleman, a Lord Bainbridge from Bath who had laid down the interim sum of sixty guineas, a generous offer for the perusal of her valued trinket, as yet untouched, the promise to be made good a fortnight hence when he should return to town. Time enough then to train me in the indelicate arts, my knowledge of which was still lacking in many important respects despite the best efforts of the young ladies to further corrupt my innocence with bawdy tales of their engagements with men, much of which I was yet to observe.
“So Billy, what do we have now?” he turned to face the scrawny boy, more than surprised that he hadn’t buggered off. He sagged just a little as John relaxed at his side, shifting his body weight to lean into Sherlock’s arm. Crisis avoided for now.
“And third place goes too….” Sally unpinned a picture and read the name scrawled in pencil on the back “Lestrade….well done sir”
“Well then, what’s he like….what did you find out?” all eyes turned eagerly on him as he flopped down beside Greg on the sofa in front of a crackling fire.
They hadn’t yet had a chance to speak beyond a few snatched words before they jumped in the back of the van, and this was hardly the place to talk, squashed in beside Greg and the rest of the band. They would just have to wait until they were alone because there was still so much that needed to be said, to work out.
“Did you already know about this, or were you just saving it as a nice surprise?” he snapped, hating the tone of accusation in his voice.
“And what did they say, these most esteemed dames?” I asked, faux-polite. (That we kissed? That we are lovers? That I am his, as he is mine and you will never have him?)
“You need somewhere to stay for the night? I know a place, I’ll take you there if you like, but it’s no five star accommodation”
Sherlock felt a warm throb of heat, deep in his gut. Why had he even thought this would be hard?, there really was no competition, he wanted John Watson, mind, body and soul…. the body as soon as possible, preferably…
Sherlock stuck out his foot out as far as he could reach and successfully nudged John’s balls. John gave an undignified squeak and his knee shot up, banging on the underside of the table and making the crockery rattle.
“Not just sightseeing then” John added, “look, didn’t you say he drove a black BMW?, look…down there, behind that blue Ford Focus”
The scent of fresh bread made his empty stomach clench as he passed a bakers shop. The owner’s dog lay on the front step knawing on half a scorched loaf. It would be so tempting to abandon his pride for once, and wrestle the little terrier for the meagre scrap of bread, but he passed by avoiding the gaze of the baker’s wife as she scowled at him from the doorway. Fuck, he must look really desperate.
He left his collar unbuttoned and grabbed his tie, stuffing it into his pocket as they left the room together and Sherlock yawned widely, still mildly hung-over from the night before.
“He’s fine, … you don’t have to worry, I’ve got his back” he said with a smile as he brushed past John and made his way out into the crowded corridor.
“Oh, I don’t mind, I’ve been seeing a girl from the village for a few weeks now, in fact, I have a date tonight. Gran doesn’t know though, so it’s a secret, and I’ll have to sneak out…. this tree is fucking excellent, no-one will even know I’ve gone”
(He must be ill, he decided, as his heart started to pound, or possibly an attack of vertigo, he hadn’t climbed a tree for quite some time after all…)
“It was my mother’s, but you could say it belongs to me now,” Sherlock said with a curve of a smile on his lips. He shyly ducked his head and turned away to hide his face from view, and without checking to see if John bothered to follow, he headed off on still-unsteady legs toward what John guessed should have been the grand front entrance to the
John continued in a calmer tone “Dinner would be good yeah, thanks for asking, I’m sure it will be …..interesting”
“Didn’t do it for you mate…Myc’s been bending my ear about peado Trevor for the last couple of years…didn’t need much of an excuse to pull him in, mess with him a bit, but John, you do know it’s highly unlikely he had anything to do with it, right?”
He couldn’t breathe, the air had expelled from his lungs as he fell and there was too much pressure on top of him now to draw a breath in. Greg stormed out of the kitchen, tea towel in hand and ready to tear a strip off him for making too much noise again, and never had a sight been more welcome at that moment than that grey-haired irritating arsehole.
Sherlock yawned, and rolled off his body obligingly, only to curl back up tightly, a long arm scrabbling around for the covers and pulling them up to his chin now that he no longer had a John-shaped hot water bottle.
Every second felt infinite, every nerve ending on fire, as the rest of the room faded away, becoming nothing more than a soft, multi-coloured blur as he drowned himself in the boy before him, fingers squeezing tighter just to ensure he was real, this couldn’t be real. He lifted his head to pull Sherlock into a kiss, quicksilver the merest glimmer behind wide black pupils. He pressed their foreheads together instead, content to just stare.
“I aint going no closer Shezza…see ya around sometime?” Billy hovered uncertainly shielded from the rest of the street by a looming four-wheel drive. Thoughtless Sherlock, he chided himself, digging into his jeans for a twenty pound note and squashing it into Billy’s hand.
“Hmm”, John hummed, “You’re quite the dirty little fuck now aren’t you….where in hell did you come from?”
“You would have us disgraced in such polite company I am sure”, he said in fondness as the door was opened to admit us. It was Charles himself, the maid being busy with the preparations for his guests, still clothed in a gown of heavy dark twill faded to a stormy grey from many a launder, the uniform of his calling.
The grounding weight of John’s body left him, cold and oddly weightless if only for a matter of seconds. And then he was back, pressing soft, tender kisses to his face and brow. He straddled Sherlock’s hips and leant over him, gathering up both Sherlock’s wrists in his hands.
The kitchen fell silent. Mike blinked rapidly, opened his mouth as if to speak and closed it again. He swallowed convulsively, and trailed his hand back and forward through his short bristly hair.
“I am master of nothing, truly”, I answered, as John led the way, “I thought it but a child’s trick which I used to tease the maids when I was small. He was one small man, and you forget the most important part, I had you by my side and that is where I draw my strength and courage. I am weak alone”.
“Begging your pardon young sirs” she had said, and my eyes shot wide as she bobbed a quick curtsy and scuttled back out of the room again as fast as she could go, whilst I lay in a state of extreme mortification and growing arousal at the proud erect cock pressing at the crease of my thigh. Later that day she had ventured to return and pleaded her assurances that our secret would be most safe with her, for she cared not a jot how we chose to spend our nights together and had seen much worse from the other residents.
