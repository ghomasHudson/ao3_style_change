Sherlock made his way out of the cemetery and West until he found a park where he could bed down for the night.  He didn't expect to have any trouble evading the cemetery security guards, but it didn't seem like a good place to sleep.  In the morning, his clothes were fixed again, as was his skin, and everything was back in his pockets.
This was also still LA, which, while not consisting entirely of deserted lots, still had some.  There was a restaurant whose entire sidewalk was blocked off.  It was painted black, a modernist building with lots of squares and the name in stainless steel sticking out from the building on bars and lit from underneath.  It was called "Lumen" with all lower-case letters.  The lights were currently off.  The sidewalk was entirely blocked without a plywood bypass, and the sign told people to use the other side of the street.
Sherlock found a semi-surreptitious set of stairs to sit on while he waited for the furore at Mackler Securities to die down, and then he went back that night.
Sherlock pasted on a friendly smile.  "There's nothing I like more than traditional English baked goods."
Sherlock had been sitting quite some time.  At least, it was now dark, and he had arrived at the site in daylight.  A dented and rusty white van pulled up, someone shoved an old toilet out of it, and the van peeled away.  The toilet knocked down the hill until it landed directly on a rock and a shard flew out and hit him.  Sherlock sat in the dusty cloverleaf and examined a white piece of porcelain near his right foot.  Well, this sitting was getting him nowhere.
"Why?  What about free will?  Are you only a clockwork that runs in its tracks and never turns aside?  What good is having a soul if you never use it for free will?  Maybe you do have to kill me.  Do you have to kill me at this exact moment?  Have I attacked you?  Watch."
"I have 113 demons I need returned. And just to make things easier on your fallible little mortal memory, I'll write their names down for you."
Sherlock set out again from the front of the church.  Maybe he should've taken the priest's offer of a bus pass.  Well, too late now.  He thought his coat seemed a little lighter, so at least some of the saltwater had evaporated.  At least he hadn't swallowed any seawater.  What was the last thing he had drunk?  The pepper rum?  He didn't feel thirsty, and he hadn't passed out recently.  If John was here, he could've reminded him when it was teatime.  This had to be John's fault somehow.  If he had just stayed where he was put, and not come rushing back to St Bart's...Sherlock sighed.  Well, if he caught demons at the same rate, it would only be 224 more days until he saw John again.
Sherlock arrived at the appropriate transportation centre at the appropriate time.  Deducing the passengers who boarded the bus took him only a moment.  Although marginally more interesting than aeroplane passengers, there was little to recommend them.  The bus didn't take anything like a straight line route; it meandered back and forth across the highway, stopping at little shops that only sold hot coffee, souvenirs, and extremely stale crisps.
This time he went too far again in jumping, and knocked into the brick warehouse on the dock.  He broke some of the brick facing, too, which was odd.  He looked a little more closely, and it wasn't facing at all; it was full-sized bricks that had cracked from the impact.  Acid rain?  How peculiar.
It was June 16th of 2015.  Sherlock had been finding fewer and fewer demons per month, and he only had until...2016...sometime?  What day had he jumped off of St Bart's?  He checked the internet on his phone.  June 16th was John's blog entry "He was my best friend and I'll always believe in him."  John hadn't written anything else on his blog in four years.  It would be the work of a moment to figure out what (no doubt risible) parts of the internet John frequented if Sherlock could only see him in person.
He looked back and forth at the two women, who had been taken aback by his interruption. The one on the right smiled and had just opened her mouth to say something, when Sherlock said, "Oops, got to go, that's my agent! Bye!" and walked off at a brisk clip, holding his phone to his ear.
But surely there was something out of the ordinary.  He might go and see about the Gilgo Beach killer, even though it was a little way out of town.  Son of Sam?  Still alive in jail, so presumably not a demon.
Sherlock pulled up to a likely-looking set of buildings and left the car outside the fence.  Instead of walking up the tire ruts towards the buildings, he went around the side of the property that abutted the creek.  He looked at the round gray river rocks as he walked.
As the tank pushed towards the CHP building, it knocked down one of the lighted arms, and dragged it along, without exerting any visible additional effort.  It dragged the pole and attached arm all the way until it came to the next light pole and arm, when the first one it was dragging caught on the still-standing pole, and was pulled off of the tank.
"You don't see that wrinkle there?  You can't get that any other way but a dentist leaning on you.  No wonder so many murders go unsolved."
Mycroft glanced back at John.  "Black Angels, by George Crumb. It is a well-regarded piece in some circles, however esoteric."
Now this was even more confusing.  She didn't appear to be making a pass at him- he had seen that flicker of the eyes that generally meant the other party had decided he was gay.  But, if it got him out of paying for the candle, why not?  He put on a smile and said, "Why, thank you," and followed her.
Sherlock walked through the open door of room 116.  It was only a bedroom, not even an en suite bathroom, but looked as though it had been occupied for years.  A woman lay on the bed, unmoving.  She was very thin, and looked as though she had last updated her fashion sense in the mid-90's.  She wore a black t-shirt with the sleeves cut off, and worn black jeans that looked as though they had once been skin-tight, but now hung off her.  Her hair was all ratted up, so that it was hard to tell if her haircut was modern or far out of fashion.  She wore black fingerless gloves, and half a dozen necklaces.  Sherlock lifted a large cross and looked under it, then dropped it again, worrying he would melt it.  He waited a moment and nothing happened, so he poked at it, then set his hand on it.  Apparently this wasn't the same type of object as a saint candle or a church floor.
Sherlock was shown to his seat by the hostess, and he ordered kitsune udon in Japanese.  Only a moment later he saw someone approach the booth.  He had thought that was awfully fast, even for noodle soup, but he looked up into the face of the overly symmetrical man in the suit.
Sherlock picked up a candle in a glass jar to examine it.  There was a man in a monk's robes on it.  That was as far as he got before he noticed his own fingers were sinking into the surface of the jar, melting through the glass and into the candle.
"Well speaking of loose body parts, we've got some partial faces that were found on the coast.  Haven't had a DNA hit on a single one of them, but they're still very fresh.  Would you like to come by and take a look?"
She spit at the weird black grass, from much further away than most people could.  If this didn't tie the cherry pit spitting record of 28.51 metres, it came close.  One bunch of grass turned brown and dry and shriveled completely and almost immediately, and the bunches either side of it were partially shriveled.
He looked Sherlock up and down and then began to circle his chair.
The man in white and gold--Bennie apparently--said, "Father Philip.  I have an event to attend, but this gentleman would like to ask about demons."
Sherlock crossed the hallway, rounded a corner, and stopped to listen and let his eyes adjust.  He didn't hear any pounding footsteps, but he wasn't sure the glass man would make that sort of sound.  After what seemed too long, Sherlock crouched down, and looked around the corner.  He didn't see anyone walking, but there was something on the floor and it took a moment for him to interpret it.
"Me too.  I really miss them from when I was a kid.  Only thing to like about Good Friday.  My name's Pete.  Pete Gutteridge."
Some very shiny black shoes appeared just at the edge of Sherlock's peripheral vision.  He looked up, and there was an American Marine in full dress uniform, with a drawn sword.  But then again, that wasn't a Marine.  He was strange looking, like the man in the suit.  He was so reflective.  His hat and gloves and belt were as white as lightning.  And all the metal fittings of his dress uniform were impossible to look at.  Sherlock's eyes watered.
"Is that what you call it?  It must mean something different in London."
Sherlock was heading back towards the store the Haitian woman owned when he crossed paths with a church, a baroque Spanish building, painted pink and white.  People walked out of the church, and the cars in the parking lot lined up to exit the lot in several places.  Sherlock entered the church, after the crowd seemed to have exited.  It was much darker inside the church than the bright Los Angeles sunlight.  As Sherlock's eyes adjusted, he saw that no one was sitting in the seats.  There was only a small knot of people standing at the far end of the church.  The unamplified voices echoed around in the high-ceilinged church and it was hard to hear what the man was saying, but he thought he caught, "and all his empty promises."
"Mrs Hudson!", the man said, smiling.  John leapt up.
Don't do drugs, kids.  Some might use entheogens as spiritual seekers, but there are many reasons not try them.
As he walked from one door, the warm sunlight fell right into his eyes, blinding him, but in a moment they were at another door, on a smaller building, with less decoration than the church, but painted the same colors.  The man rang the doorbell, and in a moment, an asian man with a mustache answered the door.  He was wearing black, with a clerical collar.  "Hi, Bennie," the man said.
The officer muttered something into his radio, and then looked him up and down.  "You a Californian?"
The man looked directly at him as he slid into the booth across from Sherlock.  He leaned across the aisle to the next table and knocked the soy sauce over onto the cash tip that had been left.
"Something wrong?"  Mycroft asked.
Sherlock waited, waited, and then whipped the squash ball with the bump keys in it at the man's head.  He was disappointingly fast, though, and ducked out of the way with space to spare as the ball flew off into the gravel pit.  The demon closed the lid again, and got back to operating his tank from the inside, but Sherlock knew he was fuming in there; it even bled through into the way he drove the tank.
There were some large trucks in the cemetery, which seemed to be setting up chairs and sound equipment, over by the largest stand-alone monuments to the East.
Sherlock didn't think he could dissumulate well enough in this situation to prevent Mackler from realising he could see him.  Sherlock approached the blue glow, within leaping distance.  Mackler grasped at Sherlock's legs, and Sherlock jumped back out of the way, swinging the panel.  Mackler struck Sherlock's forearm, and the panel went clattering under the conference table.  Sherlock jumped back as far as he could, and reassessed.  He dug the staple remover out of his pocket, as he jumped backwards, and broke the two halves apart so that he had two pointy pieces.  He threw one at Mackler, but missed his eyes entirely.  It bounced away out of view.
The clerk handed him a small paper bag and he handed her a ten.  Sherlock shuffled his change and bag around as charmingly as he could and held out his hand to shake.  "George Lestrade."
The man sitting at the receptionist's desk was only a few centimetres shorter than Sherlock, but his office chair was set so that the seat was as low as it could possibly go.  No one typing away at that speed could be so technically inept as to be unable to adjust the chair to his own height.  Ergo, not really the receptionist.
As the bubbles cleared from the water, he thought he saw a glow next to his arm, so he grabbed for it.  It was something round and rubbery.  He dug his fingers into it, and all of a sudden the thing holding him twisted around violently.  So that had hurt it?  Sherlock punched the rubbery glowing thing as hard as he could, and his arm ruptured it and sunk in.  The thing twisted and shook him, and then the whole tank glowed orange.  It looked like he was wrapped in some tentacles, maybe a giant squid.  He had only a moment to observe this as the thing heated up, and the steam caused the lid to flip up off the tank and land so it was only partly blocking the light.  Sherlock kicked the heated squid off of him, got hold of the edge of the tank, and dragged himself out.  He landed down on the ground, missing the ladder, and coughed up all the water that had gone into his lungs.  His eyes watered, but he turned to see the steam billowing out of the open water tank.
The ships visible in the water seemed to be converging on an area away from the number four pier where the tugboat in question was said to be moored.  Sherlock turned down the coast and stayed as near as he could to the water, although some of the streets forced him away from it and into various dead ends.
"If that seems long, you must not have seen much of the underworld."
"Why would I do that?"  He circled out to see around the corner of the building, and make sure she didn't have an accomplice sneaking up on him.
Sherlock was backing along the road, further into the cemetery.  "There's an interesting philosphical question--could a possessed car drive on a road through a cemetery?"
Sherlock wondered if the sky wasn't getting darker above him.  It wasn't near time for sunset, though.  The demon started to stalk towards Sherlock, and Sherlock put a foot back to brace himself, and almost fell.  He skipped backwards to keep his footing.  The sidewalk was all icy underneath him.  The demon was still approaching and seemed to have no traction problems.  He leapt and tackled Sherlock, whose feet immediately slid out from underneath him.  The demon reared back and swiped at Sherlock's face.  Sherlock tried to roll, but his wet coat had frozen to the icy sidewalk.  Sherlock kicked at the demon, and tried to sit up as hard as he could, until at one heave, the coat tore, and his arms came free.
He worked silently, keeping an ear out for the very quiet tap of glass on the marble flooring.  He waited for several minutes, silently, until he heard the tap.  He could just barely see a reflection of the hallway in the marble wall at the end of the niche.
He heard a light thump behind him, and turned around.  The area behind him was fairly open, and the location where the sound seemed to have come from had nothing visible.  He moved off at an angle to try to triangulate the sound, and the thump came again.  Sherlock looked up, as the sound seemed to have come from the drop ceiling.  As he watched, a panel of the ceiling lifted up and dropped back, and the neighbouring panels lifted and dropped likewise, in a wave spreading out from the original panel.  This seemed like a display meant to distract, so Sherlock concentrated on looking for the blue glow that showed him lies.
He ducked down into the rushing water, and his face was much cooler.  It didn't do much for the lack of air, though.  He felt a hand grab at him, so he hit at it with the bar, and it withdrew.  He held his breath as long as he could, but he had to come up again.  There was still quite a bit of airspace in the tugboat, and the steam flew at him again.  He swung the bar through it, but that did nothing.  The boat was starting to tilt noticeably, because it was sinking, but still tied to the dock.  Sherlock got at least part of a breath, and ducked down into the water again.
Sherlock took a 20 pound note and stuffed it into the top of the wash bottle full of alcohol.  The note didn't wick, but maybe it would stay smoldering long enough to work.  He pried apart his phone and held his money clip near the battery terminals, preparing to make them arc and light the Molotov cocktail.  He rolled up a few of the bills from his money clip together into a long tube, ready to light and leave burning in case he needed more fire later.
It was always difficult to draw a line between what the average idiot would know, and Sherlock took a few minutes to give the impression he was only a passerby, of average intelligence.  He was always almost surprised by how Americans thought someone with a British accent must be intelligent, even when he was clearly portraying a vapid businessman tourist.
John kept his eye on the fake Sherlock as he stood up. "Who are you?" he barked.
This was not how John had expected to spend his Monday morning.  He had called the clinic and said he'd had a break-in, which was true enough, but there was no way to concisely convey the strangeness of the situation.
As soon as he got a few trees and lampposts between him and the women, he raised the coffee cup he had stolen from their table and had a swig. Excellent. He thought that one had looked like the triple-espresso sort.  He needed coffee to get his brain working and think of how to get that last demon, but he had no stomach for meeting the man in a suit if it could be avoided.
It was April 6, 2012.  He had found a few more demons in the months since he had come up to LA.  The one with the metal spines had been especially difficult to defeat.
Sherlock set the ladder up against the tank furthest from the edge of the building, and perhaps more difficult to see from the street.  He looked all around the edge of the tank and all over the top.  The lid and tank had a hasp that would fit a padlock, but there was no padlock there.  There were no marks of use to him that hadn't weathered away by now.  Sherlock lifted up the edge of the lid to look inside.
He went on in the same vein for quite some time, alpha males, femoids, women only want rich men, etc.  Sherlock laughed to himself to think that anyone could be so unobservant as to suppose that any woman had ever broken Sherlock's heart.  Sherlock mentally enumerated the differences between himself and the demon.  Sherlock didn't care about relationships, and if he had cared about relationships at all, he certainly wouldn't have cared about controlling the behavior of his partner.  No one had any obligation to him.  Every man in the world could walk past without giving him a second look.  This was getting tedious, but clearly the man was getting angrier and angrier and closer to making a mistake.
What would be the problem with that?  There had to be a catch.  The other man probably thought Sherlock would drag John down with him.  "I've learned to look before I leap.  If my soul's so worthless, why not just give it back?"
The woman picked him out whatever it was he'd ordered, and the man looked back at Sherlock, startled.  "Oh," he said, "you're a Londoner, too?"
The part of Los Angeles he traveled through back to his haunts looked undamaged, even with all the smoke stains adhering to the walls, fences, and street signs.  As he got closer to the usual spot, he saw that the hillside, instead of being a light yellow wheat color, had been scorched into a fresh black.  He took his bearings off the shopping mall and two nearby mountains just in case the impossible had happened and his mind's eye had failed him.  It was definitely the spot where he had been residing.
Now that the water had stopped dripping into Sherlock's eyes, he took a better look at the woman, in the unlikely event he had missed something at first glance.  She hadn't needed another look.  That was at least 120 days of London sunlight for the bleaching at the top of her black sweatshirt's shoulders.  Couldn't be less than half that for Los Angeles.  There were definitely plenty of hiding spaces around the campsite that more clothes could fit.  Say ten suits of clothes, equally worn, would make a year and a half.  All of them appeared to be heavy-duty work pants, fit to her, so heavier work, like gardening or landscaping.  When a house payment got to be too much, one of the first luxuries to go was the gardener.  It had been a financial accident; she seemed much more together so far than some of the people he met out in the wild.
This other man came to a stop a few feet from Sherlock's and Moriarty's chairs. "Please, allow me to introduce myself," he said. Moriarty started to cackle and threw his head back. The man looked at Moriarty with a very slight look of annoyance. The noise stopped entirely. Sherlock looked at Moriarty. Moriarty had no mouth anymore. There was just smooth skin where his lips ought to have been, and yet it was obvious even without the noise that he was still laughing.
This wasn't a murder, only an overdose.  He walked out of the room to see what else he could find.
"Dr Watson."
As Sherlock paced through the site, he saw something that was not sticks and not metal.  They were human remains.  The remains were still articulated, but the skin was generally burned away.  No large animals had returned to disturb them.
"It's really bad when the rains start in fall.  We used to have salmon in the river, but all the pig farm sewage lagoons overflowed and killed all the fish."
Something knocked into Sherlock and his phone went flying out of his hand as he fell.  His arm didn't break on the rocks as he would've expected in usual circumstances, but the fall certainly hurt.  He rolled and swung at the person or thing that had tackled him, but it had already jumped to its feet.  It was a man in a brown work jacket and pants, and black rubber boots.  He was looking at Sherlock with the most dead-eyed stare.  Certainly, some people's faces would relax as they prepared to attack, but this was another thing entirely.  This was the look of a serial killer sizing him up like he wasn't a human at all.  He had seen a few in his day, and this was certainly the man he had come looking for.
A hit, a very palpable hit!  The tank hatch opened a crack, and then as the operator adjusted his grip, flung all the way open and bounced on its hinges.  The demon was not especially impressive, but Sherlock did observe that he had a much more modern haircut than the other demons.  The man began to upbraid Sherlock about his insult.
"Is it only the dirt that is holy?  I'm on the first step.  I'm on the second step.  I'm on the third step..."
The assistant with glasses was eventually persuaded to accept the blood, and told that if any issues arose, they would be dealt with then.  After all, there were five witnesses to the blood being drawn.  The assistant without glasses then took out some sort of camera with a light on it that was meant to photograph the iris of the eye.  He explained that permanent eye color implants were apparently easy enough to accomplish, but when he asked Sherlock to tip his head back, Sherlock wouldn't let him anywhere near, either.  "No, only John," he said, "only John."
Everyone in the room turned their heads quickly to keep their eyes on Sherlock.  The assistant stopped where he was.  "John can do it," Sherlock said.
- o - o - o -
He worked his way along the hallway, step by clanging step.  He still heard no one else at all.  All the rooms off the hallway were open, and each was empty, unless demons were awfully small things.  If that was so, his demon-retrieval instructions had been extremely lacking.
"How would you avoid me?  What is consecrated ground?  Where does it start?" he asked, stepping one step closer each time.  "Is it at the gates?  Is it the road that goes through the cemetery?"
Sherlock came by the Vancouver General Hospital early the next morning.  He phoned and Gutteridge met him at the front desk.  As they walked back to the morgue, Gutteridge talked about his childhood in Essex.  He went on about how delightful it was to talk to someone with a normal accent.
Sherlock flung out his arm as he started to roll. He was awake now, and someone was leaning over him, pushing him around. The man grabbed something out of Sherlock's pocket, and Sherlock grabbed his wrist. The man struck at him with his other hand, looked stunned for a moment, and then twisted his hand free and scuttled out from under the overpass at top speed. Sherlock sat up and checked his pockets. It looked like the thief had his money clip. Sherlock still had his phone and everything else, even the tooth.  Well, a couple inactive credit cards and a hundred pounds wouldn't have got him very far in LA. He looked down. Something glinted on the concrete by his hand. He picked it up to look at it. It was a large piece of a broken blade. He felt something jab him as he turned. There were another couple of the things inside of his shirt. He got out from under the overpass to shake out the pieces.
"She left me!  This is her fault.  She swore she would stay with me forever!  How many times has a woman broken your heart, and they do it on purpose!  You buy them a drink and they won't take it..."
"No, no.  That was the only thing that came to mind."
The whole area was black and flattened-looking.  The brush and low trees had burned along with the grass, leaving the sharpened black stakes of tree trunks pointing skyward.  The usual fast food soda cups and crisp bags were gone.  There was a distorted shopping cart, and the metal remains of a chair, but everything else had burned away.
The woman walked up to him.  "Awful, isn't it?" she asked.  "People throw their garbage everywhere and don't care what happens."
Sherlock scanned the room, turning quietly, but it was immediately obvious that there was a localised blue glow back in the direction he had originally been travelling.  He approached it, looking for good weapons lying on desks as he passed them.  The best he could find quickly was a staple remover.
- o - o - o -
"It's 'to whom I could drive you.'  And I don't have any relatives.  And if you can't tell me anything about demons, I've got better things to do."
- o - o - o -
Sherlock scoffed and tapped his fingers on the desk.  He looked at the priest silently.
After being told twice more, Bobby let go of the stranger's calf and dashed back to John's side, facing the stranger. John said, "I don't know who you are, but this isn't funny. Get out, now."
She had a short face, and was blonde with blue eyes.  She tried to walk past him without him noticing, but that just made it more obvious.  She would fit the description of John's sister Harriet, whom Sherlock had seen in photos but still never in person.  He waited till she relaxed enough that he could tell she thought she was safe; then he turned and followed her.
Sherlock looked at the bases of the trees as he walked along.  Nothing too interesting seemed to be caught there--plastic shopping bags, bottle caps, cigarette butts mostly.
Sherlock waved through his options.  Probably wouldn't pass as a janitor dressed as he was.  He decided to stroll straight up.  He put on his best New York accent, making sure not to go too nasal.
Another idea came to him.  After all, who hadn't heard of tornados driving 2x4 lumber through metal?  Maybe a tooth could be thrown through metal if it moved fast enough.  Sherlock had sadly neglected to see if he could throw things quickly, as well as run quickly.  He had not quite got around to it--many experiments to run and not enough time.  He tried to wind up like a cricket bowler and throw it as hard as he could.  This had no result.  He couldn't even see where the tooth went after he let go of it, and it definitely made no noticeable impact on the side of the tank.  Sherlock knew there was a reason he disdained sport.
She took out her lighter, shook it around, and as she lit her cigarette, the firelight reflected off her eyes.
The man considered him for a moment and said, "You've only found a left face?  I've cut off a lot more pieces than that.  That's a little disappointing, actually."
"Yes, that's me."
The other man disappeared, and Sherlock looked down to see the clipboard was in his hand.
"I don't have a lighter.  I quit."
The office building was low and tan with clerestory windows above a row of garage doors.  The adjoining side had an office-style front with windows and human-sized doors and a projecting roof, and the side of the building above the roof read "CHP"in thin blue letters.  Several light poles with long arms reached out over the truck lanes leading to the scales.  There was a large paved area with some concrete barriers for funneling the trucks to the appropriate scales, so that 18-wheelers towing three trailers could maneuver around each other.  A couple of dusty old passenger cars rested along one edge of the parking lot, away from the CHP office.
He eventually managed to find a sword letter opener in one of the fancy corner offices.  He took a moment to look down through the floor-to-ceiling windows at the ferries and sailboats in the surrounding water.  There was even an old-fashioned sailing ship.
The other man in the suit looked up towards the sky.  After a moment of looking up, he sighed, theatrically, and brought his gaze back upon Sherlock.  "It appears the court against which there is no appeal has rendered its verdict.  That soul counts towards your 113."
"Ah, coffee like that might almost make you feel alive again."  The man in the suit said, as he appeared beside him.  Sherlock set the coffee cup down on top of a newspaper vending machine, although it wasn't really so much a vending machine as a dispensing-for-free machine, and there were few who would call the contents of the tabloids within 'news'.
John thought that he had kept walking into the kitchen for the towel and the spray, so he was extremely surprised to find himself laying on his face in the hallway in front of the door to the downstairs. Bobby was sniffing at John's face. John felt a bit shaky. He could feel the sweat on his upper lip and under his eyes. He wasn't the kind of person who passed out like that. It had been so real, though. He would've sworn he had actually seen Sherlock standing there in front of the door. John wondered if he should have his head looked at. Had he stood up too fast?
The demon dove back at him with the shard of ice.  They grappled, and Sherlock pushed the demon down so that his arm holding the ice was pinned under Sherlock's shoulder.  Sherlock ended up with one hand holding the demon's empty hand away from him, and his other hand free.  Sherlock reached into the coat pocket.  He fished around and pulled out the padlock he had taken off of the tugboat door, throwing it to the side, and then he found what he was looking for, the wash bottle full of alcohol.  It wasn't much, only 250 mL, but it would have to serve.
like Sherlock--had stood in the corner of the front room from the time he had backed away from John until the time Mycroft showed up. He wasn't sitting in his old chair, just crowded back into the corner between the fireplace and the window.  He had his greatcoat on, but he had his arms wrapped around himself as though he was cold, and there was a tightness to his eyes and his jaw.
Mycroft looked disapprovingly at the man.  "You didn't bring expired supplies, did you?"
The hatch was indeed unlocked and not wedged shut in any manner.
Sherlock had both hands free.  How long would it take Mackler to get down to the ground floor?  Would he take the elevator?  Would he jump?  Would he be concerned about getting the gold drool cleaned up and appearing normal to others?  Surely even he couldn't manage to threaten or trick all those other people into silence.
They circled each other.  Sherlock wondered if the man expected him to say something like, 'I'm your worst nightmare.'  He wondered if he could get him uphill and off of the rocks onto better ground.
A little ways away in a plaza, a man stood on top of a five-gallon bucket holding a sign in front of his chest.  The writing was rather small for a sign, and was printed with permanent marker.  The sign claimed that the Dalai Lama and the Pope were the same person, and that same person was the Devil.  Seemed unlikely, Sherlock thought, although he had certainly never seen the Dalai Lama or the Pope.  People streamed past, unconcerned, to and from the coffee stand.
Tap, tap, tap.
Sherlock pointed at the remains.  "You can see here, on the inferior aspect of the buccal surface where the toothbrush hits.  She brushed her teeth so often, it made a thick spot.  And look at the angle, she's right-handed.  But you can see here, on the outside of the face where she always missed her sunscreen, and sunlight comes in on a left-hand drive car."
- o - o - o -
The man who had answered the door smiled in a very tight-lipped manner, and said, "Why, certainly, Father Bennie."  Father Bennie said, "Thank you," and immediately decamped at that.
The homeless woman who had thrown a bucket of water over Sherlock set a bizarre-looking canned beverage in front of him.  It was all black, with neon green lightning bolts down the front of it.  She seemed very insistent that he take it, and come to think of it, he hadn't had anything to drink in awhile.  John would probably want him to drink something at least, if he had known Sherlock still existed.  It was warm and fizzed over a little when he popped the top.
The reflection changed, and Sherlock leapt over the fence of his niche, and threw the key ball as hard as he could at the glass man.  It hit where he intended, and the plane with the eyespot cracked with a low "tick".
"Bollocks."
The open side of the shed hadn't been out of his sight, so he supposed the demon was still under there.  Sherlock leaned over the fence and set the burning rags into the corner so that they touched the wooden wall of the shed.  Then he stood back and waited.
He started out walking towards the airport.  He would really have to do something about the having-no-American-cash problem, he thought, as the city bus drove by him.
"So...did you want to talk about some personal demons you have?" the priest asked hopefully, when they were seated in the office.
The priest looked a little more distressed.  "We don't usually do exorcisms.  But if you want to go to St Emydius, they have some psychiatrists who can help you if you're seeing demons.  And it's entirely free.  They're there on Monday, Wednesday, Friday."
Sherlock ducked his head down for another breath.  He rammed again.  The window flexed a little, and he wobbled on his feet.  It all came flooding back to him, that sound of John on the phone crying out to him.  He ducked down again to breathe for a moment.  Sooner or later, Mackler was going to start moving, or the floor would cave in.
Sherlock was breathing very fast as he spoke.  "Heh.  Not yet."
He looked back to the main entrance of the office building.  Now there were four people filming him, and another two filming the gold drool pouring out of the broken window.  His foot was free.  Shoeless, but free.  Sherlock tilted himself backwards over his remaining trapped leg, but that only flexed the roof of the car, and made more shards of glass pop out of the windshield.
The sprinklers stopped.  Nothing but drips came out of them.  The fire alarm was still loud, and the air coming from the gap at the bottom of the window was very cool.  The carpet smoke was dissipating quickly.  Sherlock wondered if that was a dark outline of Mackler he could see through the carpet smoke.  He might never get back to John if he didn't escape now.  He could of course, hold out hope that John would commit all sorts of sins in his life, and end up in the same place as Sherlock eventually, but he supposed he shouldn't hope for that.
The "median" as the Americans insisted upon calling it, looked tolerable enough to him.  There were some low bushes and spindly trees that were green, interspersed with tall yellowed grass, that would make him difficult to see from the roadway.  He got in under the tree and saw some wadded up newspapers, and an assortment of fast food soda cups and crisp bags, but no shopping carts or tents or tarps, so he supposed no one else would have a prior claim.  He flattened the grass down and lay down to sleep.
But beside the airflow for the engine, Sherlock thought there must be another aperture.  If he recalled, some tanks had escape hatches for the crew in case of the tank turning over.  There was less than half a metre of space underneath this tank.  Ah well, he had wormed into smaller places.  As soon as Sherlock jumped underneath, the driver rotated the tank around its axis, spinning one tread forward and one tread backward.  Sherlock put out his arms so he could scoot around under the tank and stay out from under the treads.  He was on his side and he had to keep his upper shoulder low to keep it from contacting the bottom surface of the tank hull and dragging him.
Sherlock sidestepped around as the tank tracks turned towards him, and shouted, "No one likes you!  Your woman left you and told all the other women never to speak to you again!"
Sherlock found no excess murders in New York above the expected amount of white noise.  He hadn't heard of demons wandering the streets, or at least nothing from any source less spurious than the usual sort writing about secret lizard people.
Soon enough, Sherlock was back at the airport, with Rosemary...?  Anyway, it was about time to exchange his stash of pounds again.  There was a new clerk at the currency exchange counter, who gave Sherlock and Rachel or whatever her name was, a very strange look.  She smiled anyway, as politely as she could, exchanged the pounds for dollars correctly, and then asked, "Can I help you and your...wife?... with anything else?"
He didn't have good numbers for what temperatures eyes would burst open.  He should probably run some numbers on that the next opportunity he got.
As the tank turned, it knocked off a waist-high water pipe which was guarded by a tiny chain link fence with a tiny chain link roof over top of it.  The large metal pipe came loose with no visible effort from the tank.  The water sprayed high up in the air in a big fountain, and falling down it made rainbows in the sky.  Not that it would have any deleterious effect on him now that his burning money had gone out anyway.
"Well, tomorrow morning would be fine; let me give you my number."
Sherlock woke in the morning just as the sun rose.  He set out to see what he could see.  He had walked several kilometres when he found himself passing a bakery that declared itself to be Traditional and English and was covered in Union Jacks.  He glanced briefly into the window and saw a rather oddly dressed man in the queue.  The man looked outfitted for the 1920's, hat and all, but his shirt cuffs and trouser cuffs were the right length and had never been let out.  He was only about 35 years old, but he didn't look like a modern person wearing antique clothes; he looked as though they had been his clothes the whole time.  He thought he might stick his head in the bakery and see what that was all about.
He was immediately asked to leave the restaurant.
Sherlock had meandered through all the buildings inside the cemetery wall by the time people started showing up to see the movie.
"Yes."
Each partial face was in its own drawer, even though that didn't seem like a very efficient use of space.  The first drawer was a female, somewhere between puberty and about 50 years old, depending on environmental exposure, who had had braces, but had had them removed more than five years ago.  So the lower limit on the age should be more towards 20 years old.  Not as much information as he would've hoped.  He looked in the next drawer.
Mycroft looked down at the floor before looking up again.
Sherlock's plane set down at LAX.  He had the same problem as he had before, viz, no cash for the country he was in.  He would really have to see about dealing with that at some point.  Sherlock started off away from the airport.  At least his shoes didn't seem to be anymore worn out than the day that he jumped off the roof of Bart's hospital.  He didn't want to think about it too closely.
He looked from John back to Sherlock.  "Would you favour us with something a little more classical?"
Sherlock stopped focussing on the blue glow, and concentrated on what he could see in real life, for a given value of 'real'.
Sherlock crawled out from under the tank, and retreated behind a concrete barrier.
Sherlock was silent.
John still had no idea who this mentally unbalanced man was, but he didn't need him committing suicide in John's front room. John started talking in a calming monotone. "It's all right. You don't need to do that. Just set the knife down for a moment and we can talk about it. It'll be fine. Don't worry. Everything will be better soon. There's nothing to worry-"
But then a man in a medium-gray suit stepped towards them out of the enclosing darkness and became illuminated. Moriarty looked just as he had on the roof of St Bart's, but this man was different from everyone else Sherlock had seen in his life. He appeared to be an adult male of European ancestry, blondish, rather pleasant-looking, but something was very off about him. This other man's hands were exactly the same size as one another and had no calluses and no scars on them. His shoes looked unworn. His tie was centered exactly at his throat. He appeared to have nothing in his pockets. He was clean-shaven, but he was shaved completely symmetrically. Not even Sherlock himself could shave that perfectly.  Everyone made mistakes when shaving, depending on whether he was right- or left-handed. Everyone did. It made no sense!
Los Angeles was certainly a widely-spread town, with rather poor public transportation.  The map on his phone had suggested he could take a series of five buses to his destination, over the course of twelve hours, if he so desired.
The man got out of Sherlock's reach and turned.  "So maybe only slightly less dumb than I thought?"  He chuckled.  "What are you, then?"
He whetted the money clip and waited, and soon enough, out from behind the building came a military tank.  The tank was painted tan all over, wearing its colours from the early 1990's.  The gun barrel was not split like the museum examples he had inspected.  The tank appeared to be in battle-ready condition, very clean, with a solid coat of paint, except that it had some damage to the hatch at the front, where it must have been opened with a crowbar or some similar object, a catspaw more likely.  If there were no keys required to start the tank, that suggested that the rounds of ammunition were also safely locked up and had not been loaded into the tank.  Sherlock, however, could not discount the probability that someone somewhere had been careless and left the rounds unlocked or in the tank, or that some sort of uncanny ammunition was available.
Sherlock rolled up against a tombstone, with a scratching and crunching noise.  He managed to get to his feet, and found the glass had a gap in it along the middle of his back.  He clawed at it over his shoulders, and the glass hung together long enough that he was able to peel the entire thing off.  He started running blindly across the cemetery, trying to pass between the densely set tombstones by the feel of the air.  He didn't want to open his eyes yet, in case there were still some pieces of glass lurking on his person.  It was hard to tell with all the cuts paining him and distracting his senses.
Just after the sidewalk yoga was a church painted purple, with a banner on the front saying something about a goddess rosary.  Soot from the freeway had settled into the folds of the drapery and it couldn't possibly be changed often enough to affect anything he was doing now.  There was an analog letterboard out in front of the church, the kind with black letters that fit into rows, and the key to the glass front easily defeated.  It said "Love Is Love".
Sherlock shuffled backwards through the grass, hoping not to fall backwards over any markers, and trying to keep his balance on the uneven ground.  As he backed up, the other man stepped up onto the grass as well.
"I'm not giving you anything for it."
The demon then recalled that he had a public address system, a tannoy, aboard his tank, and that he could use it to lecture Sherlock without exposing his eyes.
A dark green flame consumed her from the feet up.  No heat radiated off it that he could feel.  A bright white flare at the top of where her head had been caused Sherlock to jump back.  He was just surprised, not scared, and by the time he could see again, there were only a few green sparks in front of him, drifting upwards.
Sherlock walked. He walked and he thought. Was there any other option but to behave as though what he was experiencing was real?  Apparently he needed to reassess his conclusions about the likelihood of an afterlife. But apparently Moriarty was still...where he was. Would Sherlock's phone really still work? He found himself near a promising-looking overpass and crawled down into the space where the foundations of the upper road sat on the built-up mounds underneath. It was unoccupied. Sherlock took out his phone. It did appear to work, even though he was in a different country and hadn't charged the device since the evening before he jumped off the roof of Bart's.
It was summer so it stayed light late, though not near as late as London did.
Well, he'd already made a huge amount of noise already; no reason not to make more.  He picked up a rusty metal bar that lay against the side of the boat, and used it to pry the padlock off of the nearest door to him.  It wasn't completely dark inside the tugboat.  Light came in through the portholes and through gaps around the doors, and through little spots in the corners of the walls that had rusted completely through.  He hooked open the door so it wouldn't easily slam shut behind him, and dropped the broken lock in his pocket.
"I have poisoned."  She looked at him for a long minute.  "No, you're not a priest.  I have done bad things, but I have stopped doing them.  Give me time to find a priest.  Then I will come back."
"Warming stuff," he said to the proprietor.  "So, if you were looking for a demon, where would you go?"
Another month passed.  Sherlock figured he probably wouldn't be seeing the poisoner again.  Or he would, but it would be significantly more work.  He had gathered up L1800 and taken them to the closest currency exchange, which was still the airport.  The woman--Reina, Rachel--whatever her name was, had come with him, and had got a few looks, but no one had thrown her out of the airport, so they split up their money under the disapproving eyes of the exchange clerk.
John thought he had made his peace, but all those thoughts he had had at Sherlock's death were coming back on him.  He would just get through this, see if he couldn't get Mycroft to deal with this man, and then he would go back to how things were.  He might go out to Sherlock's grave again, tell him about the whole story.  He probably would have liked this sort of thing, been able to explain it away immediately.
Sherlock thought he might keep his eye on that man; he seemed in a mood.  Sherlock turned as he came to the entrance of the cemetery, and the man in the suit was much closer to him than he had thought.  Sherlock paused for a moment, considering.  He turned a little further, and then walked backwards through the gates, one foot behind the other, like an East German escaping.  "Have I?"
The act was done.
Sherlock wasn't sure what was happening here, what any of this was, but if he had to choose between letting Moriarty walk the same Earth as John, or Sherlock walking the same Earth as John, Sherlock knew he would do anything in his power to make sure it was himself.  He was decided.
The man in the suit said to him, "I'm glad you could spare me a moment.  I wanted to talk to you about  buying out the rest of your contract.  The price is negotiable, and you wouldn't have to round up those last few, pesky demons."
John looked over at the Sherlock impostor.  Sherlock had had such unusual bright eyes, and this man's seemed, if anything, brighter and more reflective, almost glowing.  He certainly did look like him.  This man was even wearing the exact same suit and the exact same violet shirt Sherlock had been wearing when they took him away.
He rolled so that he could feel the ice blade under his shoulder, and then sprayed the wash bottle back over his shoulder onto the demon's hand.  He felt the demon's arm twitch as he lost his grip on the piece of ice, as it melted under the spray of alcohol.  And then the bottle of alcohol was out.
Sherlock had of course, tested various substances on himself in his younger days.  Some of the ones that grew outdoors in warmer weather, he found much easier to acquire in Florida, when he had been there in 1998.
They didn't hang many women in England, but if they were poisoners, the odds were much better.
Ranged along the pavement were all sorts of people lying on their backs on yoga mats.  Very trendy-looking sorts with the newest, sportiest-looking clothes.  In the pose called shavasana.  Nothing could be more necessary to an old Indian form of meditation than synthetic wicking fabric.  He wove amongst all the people laid out on their pink and ecru mats, their eyes closed, and their legs and arms relaxed.  Unusual to see them still breathing, though.  The tarps underneath the dead bodies at mass casualty incidents he had been to were about as cheerful as these people's yoga mats, but corpses generally wore a greater variety of clothing, and the stillness of corpses was even comforting.  Mortui non mordant.  The dead do not bite.
"I'm a patient man, but that seems a long time to wait."
When Sherlock woke in the morning, he found that his coat and shirt collar were whole again, and his money clip was back in his pocket.
He waved his hands back and forth as though attempting to disperse an odor.
"Mycroft? Are you still there?"
"I hope to be forgiven."  She turned, slowly, and held out her hands, palms out, towards him.  "Please, give me time to repent."  She was producing actual tears, but that didn't mean a great deal.  Sherlock himself could cry on command, and he knew others who could, as well.  He had been unswayed by Irene Adler's tears, and he would be unswayed by those of this woman.
"But why don't you go on up there, try to round up my demons for me, and when you fail, you'll come back here, and Mr Moriarty will go up there and try his hand at collecting the demons for the rest of the time remaining in the five-year period.
The suited man brushed the coffee cup off the top of the stand, and onto the street where it broke into several large shards, puncturing the tire of a car that was backing into the space.  The man in the suit promptly turned and walked away, and Sherlock followed him before the car's driver could take in what had happened.
Another piece rolled out of the pile, and rolled awkwardly and joltingly towards the first piece.  He changed his mind.  He took his beer can shiv and stabbed each piece a couple of times and then retreated.  Three pieces came out of the pile at once in different places and started jolting along.  He wasn't quite sure with all the smoke, but it looked like the furthest one was part of a human head.  He dashed towards it, and the other pieces started rolling after him, but they didn't move very fast.  He plunged the aluminium into what looked like an eye, and the piece of flesh flared up and lit on fire.  As he jumped back, he saw that all the other loose, crawling pieces had lit on fire, too.
"Yes, John. I'm sure everything will be fine. I'll send someone over shortly." Mycroft hung up.
Moriarty stood and stuck his hand out to Sherlock. Moriarty's hand was warm and dry and felt like any other living human’s hand. Moriarty grinned at him in that mouthless way, and looked him right in the eyes. Moriarty winked.  Sherlock flinched away, somehow expecting Moriarty to shoot himself in the head again.
- o - o - o -
"Well, better safe than sorry," she said.  That didn't seem to follow at all.  Who, exactly did she think he was?  Someone who wanted protection money?  Did Americans who wanted protection money often speak of demons?  None had done so when he was in Florida.
Sherlock's foot kicked into the curb, and he held his hands a little further out for balance as he came to a stop.  He lifted his foot up behind him, and stepped up onto the grass.
The building was built in the 1920's, and had four cylindrical water tanks on top.  The tanks were riveted together, and perhaps original to the building.  The tanks were painted gray to cover graffiti, which cast doubt on the hotel's claim that no one could get up to the roof.  There wasn't much to see besides the tanks, and there were two ladders sitting out on the roof.  It would certainly be easy enough to take a look in the tanks.
Sherlock pulled out the sharpened money clip and used it to cut his coat into a long strip, spiraling around and around to get the longest piece possible.  If two wheels on the same side of the tank were tied together, it would turn towards the tangled side because those wheels were stopped.  And Sherlock was definitely a faster runner than seemed quite natural.  Perhaps he would be able to manage it.  He laid out the coat strip so that he could quickly deploy it around the tank's wheels.
The man in the suit chuckled.  "They're all on the same side, are they?"  He snapped his fingers.  "So close."
Sherlock jumped over one of the little metal fences in front of the niche of some dead person who had apparently once had money, so that he wouldn't be immediately visible.  He reached into his pockets.  There were still all the same things as usual.  One hand fell on the bump keys and one hand on the squash ball, and then an idea presented itself.  Sherlock took the keys off their ring as quickly as possible--his hands weren't shaking, that would definitely never happen to him--and then stuck them into the squash ball so that they stuck point out, as equally spaced around the surface of the ball as possible.
Sherlock took a small pebble from one of the nearby graves and tossed it to the other side of the glints he could see.  The rotating briefly paused, and then continued, along the same course.  It didn't seem to be avoiding him or approaching him.
Eventually he got around all the freeways and got into the airport.  Sorely tempting as jumping over the freeway sounded, that would surely draw attention, maybe even make the news somehow, if someone had a dashcam.
"What's a soul, really?  Have you ever seen one?  Have you ever seen any evidence it exists?  And I don't see why you couldn't see John.  What would be the problem with that?"
Sherlock strolled along the wide white floors of the airport.  He had no luggage, so he had nothing to slow him down, or require him to lean over sideways and break his stride.  As he got out of the gate area into the main, mall-like part, he strolled up to a currency exchange.  The clerk tried to talk him into just taking money out of the ATM rather than spending such a large amount on changing the money, but he found the appropriately cutting remark to goad her into agreeing.  The exchange fee was 61 Canadian dollars, and he ended up with $256 Canadian.  It wouldn't go far, but it was more useful than pounds, anyway.
Sherlock felt a burning as the second-to-last symbol removed itself from the right side of his chest.  He couldn't find the ball and keys; presumably they had burned up.
Sherlock passed a store that was called “Los Angeles Wigs.”  That answered that question.
Sherlock looked at Mycroft very flatly, and picked up the violin. As he opened the case and picked it up, he shot a look at Mycroft, one John might almost call surprise.  He spent a moment tuning it and setting it up, and then he drew the most godawful screeches from it. John hissed. His heart fell. He looked to Mycroft.
Sherlock was once again walking up and down the entire length of Wiltshire, hoping to find something of interest, when he saw out of the corner of his eye, someone move into step beside him.
After a short sermon about why he shouldn't use honey, Sherlock managed to get out of her what road he had to take to get up to the pig farm.
The man stood up, abandoning his popcorn, and walked along next to Sherlock.  They crossed the street, and at the middle of the block was the entrance to the cemetery.  The cemetery architecture looked about a hundred years old--lawns, a small building that sold flowers by the gate.  Like most of the new cemeteries in California, it was accessible by car, and didn't have the old-fashioned enclosing metal gates of London.
The Northern part of the cemetery had some newer graves, many of which seemed to be in Armenian script.  Some in Cyrillic.  The Southern half seemed to be all Jewish graves.  At the East were wall niches with many open spaces remaining, and some very large monuments.  There was a long, rectangular reflecting pond with swans in it, and another round pond with a Romanesque structure in the middle.  Along the West side, there was a small Thai cemetery, and then long, two-story buildings with wall niches, some sized for cremated remains, and some for caskets.  There were many large, grand individual niches in the buildings, but the buildings themselves had seen better days, and in many places needed maintenance.  Some of the stained glass windows were very cracked, and there were weeds growing through corners of the buildings where they shouldn't.  The buildings were still standing after the various earthquakes Los Angeles had suffered over the years, but who knew what the future would bring?
Sherlock said, "I've got four left cheeks to hand.  I was wondering if there was anything particular you like about them?"
Sherlock got himself to his feet.  Apparently there was no more evidence of the ice "demon" around, and sitting on the sidewalk all day wouldn't get him back to John.  None of the passersby looked at him, but as he picked up his coat, he saw that the Haitian woman had come to the door of the shop and was looking at him.  "You'd better come in, I suppose."
He ran inside one of the cemetery buildings.  This one was one large, empty room.  A large glass wall went all the way up to the ceiling in front of a red stone wall.  The little wall shelves framing the doorway were mostly empty, except for one at eye level which had a pair of plastic action figures.  There was nowhere else to go from that room, so Sherlock immediately ran out again and ducked into another entrance.  This one had a long hallway extending to the right and left, and other doorways visible.  It was still somewhat possible to see by the light passing through all the stained glass in the building, but the shiny marble and occasional glass partition made it difficult to be sure what one was looking at.
The woman stopped in the restaurant parking lot, on the side away from the street.  The only thing facing it in the next lot was an office building, currently unoccupied.  She stood facing away from him, with her arms out from her body, and where he could see them.  "Please, let me go."
He had been walking for about six hours and not seen anything especially interesting, no more than the usual percentage of murders and thieves, when he saw a woman that caught his attention.
There were planters around the building meant to look like dry-laid stone walls.  The planters were filled with some sort of strange black grass or sedge, something like that, but it was still pliable-looking and shiny, so it was still being watered.  It was all very monochromatically artistic.
"I'm not doing this because I feel bad about throwing water on you.  If I would've felt bad about it, I wouldn't have done it.  What's a good cheer?"  She held the can in front of her and looked at it for a moment.  "Here's to us.  Who's like us?  Damn few, and they're dead."  She raised the can in the air, and took a large swig.
The woman just looked at him.  50/50 was the ideal amount, verified experimentally by Guth et al's ultimatum game.
"Is grass holy ground?"
"I've made a friendly little workplace bet with my boss. Perhaps you've heard of him? Bossy bastard, thinks the world of himself. Anyway, we made a bet, and I get to pick one of you to send back to Earth for five years to gather up a few stray demons for me. And if you collect them all, you get another chance at life. Which one of you should I pick? It's not much of a risk letting your soul out of my grasp. It was mine when you got here; it will be mine again soon enough. But I think if I send you, I'll get more souls that way. Mr Moriarty is always backing people into corners with nowhere else to turn. The wailing and gnashing of teeth, I like, but the amount of praying he causes is absolutely disgusting.  I can hear it from here."
Sherlock finally made his way onto the seventeenth floor, which did have a little more security than all of the floors he had previously examined.  It looked somewhat promising.
Sherlock leapt up and planted his foot on the barrel of the tank's gun.  The sole of his shoe hissed against the hot barrel, but he had already jumped to the center of the turret.  Sherlock crouched down out of sight of the viewing port, and held as still as he could.  There was no need to be quiet over the tank noise.  He kept his eye riveted to the hatch and as the tank changed direction again, Sherlock could see the hatch bounce up and down, loosely.
The other end of the line was dead silent.
Sherlock walked off.  That seemed peculiarly easy.  Who just invited people to look at dead bodies like that?  Other than himself, he supposed.  Sherlock walked all the way back to the park outside his hostel and sat on a bench.  The cherry trees were all bare sticks.  He looked at the paper bag he still had with him, and opened it up.  It was a hot cross bun.  He really hadn't had one of those in forever, and did miss them from when he was a child.  He wondered if it would burn his tongue, with the cross and all.  He put it in his mouth.  It didn't.
Sherlock undid his shirt to look at the area underneath where his shirt had been cut.  It had been cut, he had seen it.  Shirts didn't just sew themselves back together at night!  Well, while he had his shirt partway off, he might as well look at the tattoos, which clearly were still there.  Clearly.  Not a figment of his imagination.  Well, he was getting some looks from the people driving onto the freeway.  He had better move off and start looking for these "demons".
He wondered if he could wait the man out.  He held onto a railing to keep under the water, and looked up towards the surface.  It was dark under the water pouring in, but he could see the figure of a man fall into the water above him.  He stabbed at him with the bar, and managed to hit him right in the eye.  The man glowed orange and boiled the water around him.  He had not expected this of a demon.  The man vanished again, presumably gone to steam.  Sherlock waited a little longer, but he couldn't wait forever.  He came up for breath again.  There was only a little corner of the boat compartment that still had air in it, and the boat was almost entirely on its side.  Nothing attacked him while he was breathing, so after taking his breath, he swam back into the hallway he had first come down.  It was easy enough to swim out the open door and climb up on the side of the boat that was still above the water.  Nothing attacked him, and he jumped up from the side of the boat to make a grab for the dock.
Sherlock stopped his tapping.  "No."
The bell on the door jingled as he came in and queued up behind the oddly-dressed man.  As the man pulled out his wallet to pay for his baked goods, Sherlock looked over his shoulder at the clear panel of his wallet that had his driver's license behind it.  Apparently the man was named Peter Christopher Gutteridge, but the clear panel was yellowed and cracked directly over the birthdate.  As the man stepped out of the way to deal with his change and receipt, Sherlock said to the woman behind the counter, "I'll have what he's having."
John really felt that one; it was said in the same imperious tone of voice Sherlock used to use.  Mycroft looked at John. "Dr Watson, might I prevail upon you...?"
"Not at all.  I happen to know you're at a standstill on finding demons, and I know where you might go to find another one.  Isn't that nice of me?"  He smiled.
Sherlock looked at where the current maps went according to the website of Curtis Ebbesmeyer, the famous oceanographer.  He would look upstream from that.  It had rained recently, being Vancouver, and the remains might well have washed down from a river or creek.  Sherlock wanted to get out away from the city to see if he could find anything likely, and Gutteridge even let Sherlock borrow his car, which was far beyond Sherlock's expectations.  That was one lonely man.
Well, he supposed the best thing to do was to go back to the store where he had melted the candle.  But perhaps not touch anything once he was inside.
She turned around and led him in.  "I saw what happened.  Did that follow you from the number four pier?"  She stopped and turned to look at him.  "Were you bathing in the sea?  What's that smell?"
Sherlock Holmes pitched his mobile phone behind him onto the roof of St Bart's hospital. He had just disconnected from his best friend, John Watson, who had begged him not to jump. But with Moriarty lying dead on the roof, there was only one way for Sherlock to solve this problem and keep his friends safe from Moriarty's gunmen.
The man opened up to check what was causing him to be stuck, and Sherlock lunged down and stabbed him in the eye with the sharpened money clip.
Sherlock picked up the bag from the next drawer, one with some beard hair visible.  "Good dental hygiene.  Has had a left-handed dentist for at least the last five years."
"Involuntarily, yes.  The boat sank."
At about shoulder-height, he felt a smooth patch of metal.  Sherlock pulled off a panel which apparently covered the projector controls.  The metal rectangle did have some sharp edges, but was not at all suited as a projectile.
Sherlock turned his head to follow a jogger with clearly uneven leg length, and when he turned back, that man in the suit was sitting on the park bench next to him.
With some of them, it was believing everyone was mean to them.  So what?  The whole world was mean to everyone all the time.  Wah, wah, wah.
Sherlock wasn't sure who the man thought he was, but he inclined his head to the man, and went to see if there was anything of use to him.
There was a sharp screech from the hallway where the glass man was crawling, and Sherlock took off running without looking back.  He ran down the hall and turned into another hallway.
"Oh, no, nothing so boring.  Way more evil than that."
He looked at his money clip for a moment and wondered if he could get some cooperation on it.
As uncomfortable as the situation was, there could be no benefit in letting others see that.  Sherlock looked up at the sky, feeling like he could breathe an entire lungful of air again.  Some might have described his feelings as gratitude, or relief.  It was so much lighter here than where he had been.  The beautiful orange and purple of sodium lamps reflecting off the smoggy night sky above him, and the wonderful smell of layer upon layer of human urine.  He took another deep breath or two.
The man in the suit didn't look back; he knew Sherlock would follow.
It was a pretty big building, but so far didn't seem any worse than a run-of-the-mill cheap hotel where the near-homeless, alcoholics, drug addicts, and the untreated mentally ill lived.  Eventually he got up to the roof.
Wending his way through various neighbourhoods of varying quality, Sherlock came up to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.  He circled it, but there was only the one gate, to the North.  Abutting it directly to the South was a movie studio.  The wall of the movie studio directly touched the fence for the cemetery.  There were homeless people in tents surrounding the cemetery and studio, but not right at the cemetery gates.  He circled  back toward the gates.

Mycroft looked intently at Sherlock for a moment before he spoke. "Dear brother," he said, "I haven't heard you play your violin in years. Would you indulge me?"
In 1962, a woman committing suicide at the hotel landed on a pedestrian and killed him, too.  That was really just a one-off, though.
Sherlock hadn't felt he could stand, hadn't intended to stand, but he immediately got to his feet.  Sherlock’s mind whirled.  What was this?  Could he be having some odd little flickers of consciousness as his brain used up the last of its oxygen and slowed to a stop?  This whole situation was very unlike the reality he knew.
Sherlock considered the problem of demon dogs as he searched through the skyscraper.  He was fast and able to stay out of sight of the cameras, and the building was very sparsely populated.  He took the first breakroom he came to, and went through the drawers, but there were only spoons and plastic fast food tableware.
Sherlock rolled to try to get control of the demon's hand that had held the ice, but the demon moved suddenly and got his arm free.  Sherlock kept his hold on the demon's wrist, and used his free arm to  hit the demon anywhere he could, flailing wildly.  They rolled partway off the coat, and Sherlock kept striking.  The demon levered himself partway up, but then dropped flat to the ground again and stopped moving.  Sherlock started to his knees to get so he could reach the demon's other arm, but at that moment, the demon started steaming.  Steam came off of his skin and out of all the corners of his clothes.  Or rather, it was smoke.
Many of the piers weren't exactly swarming with other people, but when Sherlock finally reached what appeared to be the number four pier, it looked entirely deserted.
The rest stop had large stones reeking of artificiality set into the side of it, to make it look more desert-like, or mid-century modern or something.  It had a flat roof, and the parts that weren't crammed with rocks were tan or bare concrete, or off-white trim.
John could do this.  He would do this, and then soon enough it would be over, and he could go back to his life.  He wrapped the tourniquet around the man's arm.  The man clenched his hand into a fist without being asked.  John wiped the site with alcohol, and waited for the vein to stand out.  There were a fair few scars from previous injections standing out now.  He took another breath and forged ahead.
It was still quite early, a little after ten in the morning, so Sherlock set off in the direction of the sea.  It was less than an hour's walk until he reached the water.  There was a maritime museum, and a statue out front, rather out of the ordinary.  Instead of just a sailor standing on the ground, the statue was of a rope ladder, cast in bronze, twisting up into the air.  A bronze sailor climbed up it, free from the earth, and another sailor stood at the bottom, holding the ladder, and coincidentally also serving as a support to the rest of the bronze structure.
Sherlock dashed out from behind the last concrete barrier towards the side of the tank, holding his coat strips in his hands.  The demon must have seen him, as the tank immediately turned its front towards him.  Sherlock was able to get to the side of the wheels and start feeding the coat rope in around the drive sprocket.  The tank suddenly turned back the other way, and the tank tread struck Sherlock in the forehead as he leaned in.  He stumbled backwards but kept his footing, and through the blood and tears he observed he could still see out of both eyes.  He wasn't defeated yet.
Sherlock reached out his hand to the window, and felt along until he felt the edge of a pane.  He heaved himself up onto his hands and knees under the weight of his sodden, steam-drenched coat, leaned his head as far down as possible, took a deep breath, stood quickly, and rammed his shoulder into the edge of the window.  He rammed again.  He thought he heard another squeaking crack.  He kept one hand on the frame of the window, so as to tell where he was, and keep the blows against the window from pushing his desk out and away from the window again.
He came to the end of the hallway, and there was a much larger room there.  It reached down into the hull of the ship, and there were all sorts of bronze knobs and bars and cylinders sticking out of everything.  The boat must have kept fairly dry, because much of the bronze was still shiny and hadn't gone green.  It was very oily smelling in this room.  He was standing on a grating surrounded by a rail, with a ship's ladder leading down off of it, so he turned to climb down the ladder facing the steps.  He looked where he was putting his feet, and when he was almost to the bottom, he looked up level with where he was, to see a man standing behind the steps staring at him.
"Honestly, John! Get this creature off me, or I'll remove it myself with as much force as is necessary."
"I came here to ask about actual demons; not schizophrenia.  Don't you people do exorcisms?  Thought I saw that on the news."  Sherlock waved his hand.  Was that the news?  Unimportant.
The assistant with glasses looked at the vial of blood John was drawing.  The assistant sorted through the extra empty glass vials and pulled out another one.
And here is "Black Angels"
"I've heard this one before.  And the angels will catch me when I fall, since I'm on their side?"
The lady leaned forward across the counter.  "Look, I have different places I get my ceremonial goods, and they're not all from a catalog.  Some things are better from other sources, and that's all I will say."
First things first, he might see if he could soak his money in alcohol and perhaps make a small Molotov cocktail out of the wash bottle.  He didn't have a schematic of this particular tank in his mind palace, so he would have to find some part of the tank that was vulnerable to fire.  Maybe the air intake?
(See the end of the chapter for
"Aus" means out, or 'let go' as a dog command.
"John, is everything alright up here?"  Mrs Hudson opened the door to the front room and put her head in.  "Oh!  Oh oh oh!"  She held her hand to her chest.  Sherlock stood up off the floor and moved towards her, and she backed up until she hit the door frame.
Sherlock stopped dead in his tracks.  He had reached the religious goods store, and there, standing in front of it, facing him, just a few feet down the sidewalk, was the man he had fought in the tugboat.  Demon?  Man?  One of twins?  Clearly not a standard-issue man at any rate.
There was a thunking and squeaking around him as some of the other furniture in the room knocked together.  The desk he lay on moved jerkily, and then began sliding across the room.  Blinded by the steam, he could only suppose that all four legs were being carried on the gold drool.  It was excruciatingly hot.  There was a clunk, as the desk hit the floor-to-ceiling window.  Sherlock reached into his pocket, pulled out the rinse bottle of alcohol, and threw it back in Mackler's last known direction.  He heard a small whuff as it caught fire.
As the tank turned, it rode up onto a parked car, and the windows burst out as the car was crushed, spraying glass far and wide.
He looked through some of the London news websites. He did find his suicide in a couple of places, but no mention of Moriarty or John. That was somewhat worrying. If Moriarty was dead and not mentioned, it didn't follow that John was still alive. Oh, John, what happened to you? Sherlock curled up with his face away from the traffic on the underpass and looked at the wall. He slept and dreamed of John pummeling him outside Irene Adler's house.
Sherlock cautiously picked his way forward, and dragged the gray armchair all the way back into the corner he had previously been standing in, all the while keeping an eye on the other people in the room.  Then he took his left arm out of his greatcoat sleeve, and out of his jacket sleeve, and sat down in the chair with his coat still halfway on.  He rolled up his left sleeve and looked at John.
Sherlock had only an instant to wonder if he was really done here, when he felt the last tattoo burning off his left arm.  He undid his cuff just to check that it wasn't a stray ember, and saw the last trace smoke away.  Well, he'd better get lost before someone came to check on the fire.
Sherlock looked a passerby right in the face for a moment, as he crouched, halfway through the car.  He pulled on one arm, which was apparently driven through the roof and into the back seat of the car.  He shook his hand, and worked it out from between the seat springs.  He looked up again towards the window he had just fallen from.  There was still gold pouring from the broken window, spreading across the side of the building, and falling to the sidewalk in blobby chunks, like lava.  Then he saw a head stick out, and duck back in.   Sherlock moved faster, bracing his now-free arm across the top of the car roof, and pulling his other arm out of its car seat and roof.  Oh, Lord, someone was filming him.  Maybe the other man in a suit would interfere with the recording?
"This one is a very conscientious woman, worried about death, as much good as it did her.  Same age range as the last one, puberty to 50 or so."
He examined his clothing and found that the collar of his shirt was cut all the way through and the son of a bitch had even cut the collar of his Belstaff greatcoat. He would've expected to be bleeding. How odd. It was dark out, but not too dark to see that the coat had been cut from his shoulder towards his neck, moving proximally rather than moving distally. The man hadn't been leaning over him sawing away at his collar, but was he not cut at all?
It was an ostentatious display, the sort meant to discourage a fight, and it could've easily been used suddenly upon Sherlock, and not given him any chance to avoid it.  It was elegant, in its way.  There was no ostentation for ostentation's sake, only the barest minimum of force necessary to be effective.
He was starting to grow concerned he was burning down a pig shed to no purpose when parts of the roof started falling down onto the pig parts.  It was hard to tell with all the creaking and crackling from the fire, but he thought he heard the pile move.  He stood as far back as he could get, but the buildings were fairly close together.  A big chunk of meat rolled out of the shed and through the fence.  Sherlock took a few steps closer to it.  It wasn't a piece that had an eye in it, so he waited.
The other man stepped closer to Sherlock, ignoring Moriarty. "Sherlock Holmes, how do you do? Have you deduced where you are yet?"
He leapt up, and tried to keep a low center of balance.  He moved much faster without his wet coat weighing him down, but as he moved, he thought he moved faster than he usually did without the coat.  He had  no time to allot to that, though; he had a demon to fight.
She smiled slightly, and reached under the counter to pull out a little black box.  "Let me give you these cigars, sir."
Sherlock was sitting upright in a chair. Everything around him was dark, but he could see himself. He could move. He could see. He looked around. Next to him, in another chair, was Moriarty. Moriarty turned his head towards Sherlock and grinned at him. Moriarty didn't look like a man who had just blown his brains out.
He searched his pockets.  Apparently the sword letter opener had been lost, either in the office, or  in escaping from the car.
The last time John saw Sherlock, he had been lying on the sidewalk in front of St Bart's hospital, his eyes open and unblinking, and blood running across his face.  John had checked Sherlock's pulse with his own hand, and found nothing.  And then Sherlock had been wheeled into the Emergency Department, and then he had been wheeled to the morgue.  Molly Hooper herself had done Sherlock's autopsy, and Mycroft Holmes had identified his body.  Mycroft had decided on a closed-casket funeral; no one ever looked right at their funeral, anyway.  They never held their mouths right.
Sherlock looked up again and the man in the suit was nowhere to be seen.
Sherlock was alone again. The feathered creature had let go of his hand. His environment was dark, but it seemed he was standing between two buildings. He looked up and saw that the sky above him was purplish-orange with the familiar reflections of sodium lamps, and he seemed to be in an alley that smelled strongly of urine. He walked toward the alley's exit. There were cars driving by, and people out on the sidewalk who appeared to be living humans. Three women who appeared to be prostitutes stood near the street.
The candle burst.  Sherlock winced and checked his hand for cuts.  From another part of the store, he heard a woman mutter in Haitian, "Oh, what now?" and her footsteps came towards him.  It didn't look as though the glass had cut him, but parts of the candle had been propelled all over the floor and several of the shelves.  It was a very peculiar burst pattern, different from a thrown or dropped object.  Maybe he would have time to experiment with small explosives to see about replicating the pattern.  Sherlock noticed that the woman, apparently the store's owner, had stopped at the end of the aisle, and was staring at him wide-eyed rather than berating him for breaking her merchandise.  Which was fortunate, as he had no American money to pay for the candle.  He would have to see what he could do to talk his way out of the situation.  Sherlock turned to the woman and said, in the Haitian he had picked up from his time in Miami, "I am terribly sorry, madam."
The man didn't say a word, but all of a sudden, he was replaced by a cloud.  The cloud passed through the stairs onto Sherlock.  It was horribly hot and wet on his face.  It was impeding his breathing, too.  The longest he had ever held his breath was three minutes, forty-one seconds, but he didn't think he could last that long with a lungful of steam.  How could he fight steam?  Well, here went nothing.  Sherlock pulled back the rusty metal bar in his hand, and drove it as hard as he could into the side of the boat.  It worked.  Saltwater started spraying into the room.  He punched a couple more holes just to make sure.
Just a quiet brushing sound, like leaves in the wind almost, but the trees were barely moving.  He saw a glint of reflected sodium light on the ground and then lost it again.  He quietly shifted himself closer to where he had seen the shine, and saw other glints down in the grass of the cemetery lawn.  There were quite a few of them, and he wondered whether there wasn't a burst sprinkler pipe in the lawn, but there was no sound of water.
Sherlock staggered to his feet, in his torn dress shirt, and his bleeding scalp, and his split-open shoes, his head bowed.  He saw the Marine's sword move up, and it came to rest lightly, the barest scratch, against his forehead.   He wondered if this was the end of him.  If he could just see John one more time, he would cheerfully accept an eternity of burning.  The burning pain went away as everything Sherlock could see dissolved in a blaze of light.
Now that that was arranged, Sherlock set off to quarter the city and see if he could see anything demonic, run into anyone uncanny, that sort of thing.
After managing to choke down the rest of the pepper rum, and being fed a handful of pistachios for some reason, Sherlock managed to finally get away from the store.  It must have been a case of mistaken identity.
"Angel dust?" he asked.
The man who answered sounded very far from home.  Mississippi, maybe?  "Thank you, ma'am.  Tell your daddy I appreciate it.  Happy Holidays."
Gutteridge gave him a look.
Sherlock made his way out of the airport and into the city on public transit.  He'd been to Vancouver before, and didn't much care for it the first time.  He made his way to the nearest hostel to the train station, which promised to be cheap and not to require a credit card.  It also promised bedbugs.
"I already know enough about every 'world'."
Sherlock deliberately took another sip.
"But would I get my soul back?  Would I be able to see John?"
"Are you the one who called this in?"
Now that the daylight was gone, it was apparent how few artificial lights were in the cemetery.  There were a few security lights, but most of the light came from the movie event, and after that, the streetlights outside the cemetery.  It was a little cooler than it had been in the afternoon, but still quite warm.  The sea breeze was nonexistent.
The tugboat may have been called the Aurora, but the paint was very weatherbeaten.  Sherlock walked down the pier one over from it, looking at the side of it that wasn't attached to the dock.  The tugboat's hull was black, and there were rusty and oily iridescent brown streaks trailing  down the sides of it.  The topsides looked to have once been painted white, but all the rust leaking through made it look cream-coloured.  It looked deserted.  The doors were closed, there was no water or smoke coming out of it.  There weren't even any seagulls sitting on it, which was unusual compared to the other boats he had passed on his way there.
"Stand up," the man said.
"Oh, somebody from the old smoke lose a relative?"
After about eight hours of this, Sherlock saw a blue flicker off in the distance, towards the mountains ringing the plain, on his side of the wearyingly straight segment of highway.  It looked like lightning, or like the light from an electrical Jacob's Ladder.  It wasn't a continuous blue glow, but fizzled and cycled.
Sherlock finished off the piece and said, looking at John, "Wer ein holdes Weib errungen".
He looked her over.  Now this, this was a poisoner--the performance of weakness, the downcast eyes.  Poisoning wasn't nearly so popular nowadays.  This was definitely looking like one of his demons, and not one who had become a demon in living memory.
It turned out it wasn't that hard to get on a plane at the airport with only one shoe.  Apparently they were only concerned about keeping out excess shoes.
Even though the unlit office was now much darker, only lit by the sodium lights outside, the molten gold was much easier to see in the dark.  It spread across the floor, still glowing from the heat within.  The sprinklers were the sort that are always full of water, not the air-filled ones.  But all the heat detecting capsules had been blown, so the smoke didn't set off the sprinklers again.
"I have a 99% completion rate.  I think the odds are in my favour for the last one."
Could it really be that simple to see God?  To take some artifical, constructed chemical, a few carbons and hydrogens stuck together somehow or other, and then know the entirety of existence?  If all it took was some small chemical, how difficult must it be not to see God, for the lack of one molecule, to go through life failing to notice the entire occupied world?
As Sherlock waited, a few fireflies bounced about the bus shelter.  The bus was as buses were, not the worst, not the best.  As the bus wended its way towards Manhattan, eventually the Statue of Liberty was visible from some angles.  Besides some larger ferryboats, there were also many very small ferryboats.
The man really seemed like Sherlock in the way he moved.  It was almost like old times.
"How can you even say that?"
Sherlock knocked into something as he walked, concentrating on the computers.  He heard the small thing hit the floor, and when he bent down, he found an elongated drip of the gold drool which had solidified.  He tucked it in his pocket for later.  There was only the one seam of it hanging down from the ceiling, but it was strange that the building wasn't blocked off and that no one was in it cleaning up the gold drops.
"No!  Of course not.  And those two vials are two different lots.  It doesn't look right, though."
Sherlock didn't put out his hand.
As Sherlock walked out into the street, he took inventory of his pockets. He had his phone, his keys, his money clip, one of Lestrade's ID's, a squash ball, four bump keys, an upper left lateral human incisor, and a 250 millilitre wash bottle of isopropyl alcohol.  It was night, clearly.  The people whom he passed sounded like Americans, or perhaps Canadians, could have been any accent west of the Mississippi river.  It was rather warm out, with an onshore breeze.  It seemed to be early in the evening, so given the temperature, probably Southern California.
Sherlock dropped the demon's wrist as it heated up quickly and burned his hand.  He got back to his feet and turned to fight, but it seemed that was unnecessary, as the demon blazed brightly and all the smoke dissipated, leaving nothing behind.  The ice all over the ground steamed away in an instant, and the sidewalk was dry again.  People walked up and down the sidewalk as though they had noticed nothing.  It was a quiet fight, certainly, but not all of them were absorbed in their smartphones.  Sherlock tried to figure out what had happened.  He knelt down on his coat again, which squelched.  It was still soggy.  Nothing new was on the sidewalk, except the empty alcohol bottle, and the broken padlock.  He supposed that since the tugboat demon had boiled away when hit in the eye, this ice demon must've somehow landed wrong on the padlock.  There really should've been instructions on this demon catching lark.  He sat down in the middle of his coat.  Someone passing by threw down two coins onto the coat in front of him.
Mackler's shirt had black-ringed blobs of gold still sticking to it, and black rings with empty middles, where the metallic blobs had burned away too much of the shirt to support their weight, and they fell out of the shirt.  The lower half of the trousers were singed entirely black.
A thin, dirty man in a baseball cap with red eyes came up to him in the hallway.  "You're from the-?  She's in 116."  The man gestured down the hall and then walked off quickly, covering his face to hide his tears.
"Now, now," the man said, "this is no time to be making enemies.  I need your signature."
The assistant received that vial and held it up to his face to squint at it, too.  "I'm still not sure about this."
Sherlock looked down at the piece of paper which was now in his hand--a bus ticket.
He tried to google the tank schematics, but he was in the middle of nowhere and had no reception.  This large, arid, unpopulated American state was atrocious.
The Cecil Hotel was a brick building, about 15 stories high, with the name painted on the side in faded white paint wearing off at the edges of the bricks.  He recalled the case of the girl who drowned in the water tank on top of the building, and how her body had been floating in the water tank for several weeks while people in the hotel used the water.
"John, please-" the man said, and took a step forward. John punched him in the sternum, which was meant to be painful, rather than damaging, but almost before John had time to blink, he was knocked to his back on the floor. The stranger had one hand on John's throat, and the other hand raised in the air, holding a steak knife. John held still. Sherlock had never been even as good as John at hand-to-hand combat. This couldn't be Sherlock. The strange man's expression changed from blank to horrified. He let go of John's throat and lowered the knife, and sat back. "Oh, God. John, I didn't mean to. I didn't mean to. I should just put this through my own eye right now."
After an hour or so of walking, a shop caught his attention.  The metal roll-up door was raised, and the shop was open for business.  There were all sorts of religious-looking statues in the windows, and a sign mentioning love spells.  Sherlock walked in through the propped-open glass door.  Inside were rows of white metal shelves with hundreds of candles on them.  Many of the candles were plain, but quite a few of them were in tall, narrow glass jars with various human-looking characters on them.
"What places would you avoid to stay away from demons, then?"
She came out again and said she still had no idea about where he might find demons, and she'd be closing up soon, so he might as well get on his way.  She'd appreciate if he didn't lead any more demons to her store.  She also told him the way to the Cecil Hotel.  He put the coat on, and stuffed the bag of things in the pocket.  They were all things that wouldn't much be bothered by the damp, or were already past help.  He set off, and the woman watched him until he was out of the alley.
"Humans weren't meant to eat meat!  Why else would we have broad, flat molars?"
Sherlock was having a great deal of difficulting extricating his legs from the car.  It seemed that one foot had gone into the floor of the car, and the other was sticking out touching the pavement, as he felt around with it.  That might be helpful.  He pushed with his toe against the asphalt as the car groaned.  He got that foot up into the car, pushed up, pushed up again.  His knee now free, he twisted his hips so that his leg bent at the knee, his other leg turned in its hole, and he grabbed the hand holes he had made, and tried to draw his knee up to his chest, so he could get his foot out of the roof.
Next, Sherlock would see if he could repeat the trick with the squash ball.  It had gone over well with the glass man, and maybe it would work here.  Sherlock worked the bump keys into the sides of the squash ball so they would point out whichever way the ball flew.  The problem was getting into the tank with the ball.  He put the ball aside to hold in reserve.
"Can I borrow your lighter?" she asked.  "I need to set angels on fire."
The man went through several facial expressions in a row: alarm, wariness, concern about time, and finally settled on resolve.  "I'll show you to the rectory.  They can assist you there."  The man put his hand on Sherlock's upper arm, cringed slightly at the wetness of it, and then pulled him along by it anyway, leading him through a smaller, plainer wing of the church--apparently floored in the 1950's, with green linoleum tiles with white streaks--and out a side door.
He looked at the coffee stand for a moment as he walked downwind of it.  It had been quite some time since he had had a cup of coffee.  If John had been here, he could have told him how long.  Well, he wasn't dizzy and hadn't fainted, so he supposed it was alright.  He couldn't waste time drinking things if he was going to get back to John before the five years was up.  He pulled out his phone and checked the date.
"Address?"
"Well, all good questions.  I'll be seeing you."  And then he was just gone.
"Don't you touch my dog! Aus, Bobby. Bobby, aus!" John was unwilling to get close enough to the other man to get hold of Bobby's collar. Why would someone do this? What would be the point of impersonating Sherlock now, four years after he had killed himself?
"Happy Eid al-Fitr.  See you tomorrow."
"There's a man here at Baker Street who looks and sounds just like Sherlock and insists that he is him. He seems a bit unwell. I'm not sure what to do about this."
"Oh, that's all modern faux-antique trash.  I don't know why I got it."  He looked down at his arm and saw that he appeared to have a blue aura around his arm, actually around every part of his body he could see.
Sherlock searched his mind palace for any old folk stories he might have heard.  "Isn't it a little late for that?"
He was going about this the wrong way.  He had got out of the habit of thinking circles around his opponents.  A physical fight against an armoured metal can with something squishy inside was a fool's errand.  It was like trying to figure out a password for a computer system--it was far easier to do an end run and find where some idiot had left the password on a post-it note on their desk, or to phone up and pretend to be fixing the computers.  Don't attack the armour, attack the wetware.  Sherlock was smarter than everyone else, except Mycroft, maybe, sometimes, and he was going to use his wits to get this hermit crab out of his shell.
"Yes.  What can you tell me about demons?"
"There's only the one big one.  There used to be more, but all the little ones went out of business.  There's only Kennedy Brown farms left."
Sherlock bounced off the inside walls of the tank as he flung his arms about.  Think, think!  He went entirely still to see if that would clear the water and if any light would leak into the tank from the outside.  It also might induce the thing to let go of him, thinking he was dead.
The tattoos or whatever they were still covered the majority of his body, but all but one on his left arm had burned themselves away, as opposed to the ten remaining on his right arm.  He still couldn't roll up his sleeves without looking like the kind of person who would permanently cover himself with a lot of faux antique rubbish.  He checked one more time to make sure his shirt cuffs were pulled all the way down.
"You're either with me or against me.  Everyone is against me!  You're weird and ugly-looking like me.  You're a traitor against other men!"
There was a little tapping noise, and the glints came into focus in Sherlock's head.  The glints were from little panes of glass sliding across the lawn and rotating around each other.  It was a sight he had never seen before, and probably bad, if he had to guess.
Going through the aiport security was reasonably painless.  The flight itself was unremarkable, and he landed at Vancouver only a few minutes late.
Sherlock wandered the cemetery, looking at the ages at death, and the style of monument.  It certainly didn't have the disordered confusion of the oldest European cemeteries, but neither did it have the straight rows and identical markers of a military cemetery.
"No, literal demons.  What can you tell me?"
A man in a blue jersey and a blue baseball cap was hollering something at the cars passing by the bus stop.  A woman seated in one of three seats under the bus shelter yelled at the man to "have some respect".  As the man turned, Sherlock saw that the jersey said "Dodgers" across the front.  A police car passed by and did not stop.
She eyed him.  "I'll come with you when you go."
As he walked through the tugboat's door that he had wrenched open, he felt like there was something standing behind him about to scream.  He looked, but nothing was there.  He looked again.
He held out his hand and bid her go.
"Stand, and bow your head."
At Mycroft's urging, the technician without glasses demonstrated the optical equipment on the other assistant, and then showed John which buttons to push.  The optical assistant also spent quite some time arguing he couldn't guarantee the results under those conditions.
The glass man said no word.  A cascade of cracks went across him, and as he began to fall to pieces, he began to burn up.  There was a flash of orange fire, and then he was gone.  An old plastic flower high up on the wall was melted, but there was no other sign he had ever been there.  All the other nearby flower holders were empty.
Sherlock walked through the rest of the cemetery, keeping out of direct view of the people watching the movie.  Not that they were an observant enough crowd to see him, anyway.  Maybe one of the guards was slightly paying attention.
"No, angels themselves.  Thought all that water woulda cleaned out your ears."
"Sherlock Holmes, I've been thinking.  Now that you only have one demon left, do you think you can get him before the five years are up?  It's been months.  Months!  I really ought to send Moriarty to Earth to look for my escapee.  I think they might make good enemies.  Or perhaps Moriarty and that last demon are too similar?  Since you beat Moriarty, you should be able to beat the final demon, right?  Really get inside his guard.  What would be the ideal demon to defeat you, I wonder?  What if you came all this way and fought all those 112 demons, only to be put out of your misery by the very last one?"
Then Sherlock went around to the dock the boat was tied to.  He could see from that side that there was no gangway or ladder, and the side of the boat was much further than he could easily step across.  Sherlock took a running jump and overshot his mark so far he almost went over the far side of the boat.   He bounced off the railing and landed on his feet on the deck with a loud clang.  The pitted decks were metal.  That certainly would've alerted anyone on the boat.
As he waited to cross the street, Sherlock stopped a moment outside a convenience store where the checkout counter was so close to the door, he could easily hear the employees changing shifts.  A young woman in hijab, so young that the circumstances suggested the convenience store was a family business, was saying, "Still no bread truck, so Dad's checking up on them.  Mom also said to give you these.  The cookies have nuts in them."
Apparently he found it necessary to lean in very close to Sherlock while he talked, but Sherlock wasn't disturbed by the tactic.  Many people had tried to intimidate him by crowding him.
He stood.  He fished in the pocket of his coat for the bottle of isopropyl alcohol.  Turning his coat sleeves inside-out, he used the wash bottle to distribute alcohol onto the armpit area of both sides to make sure he smelled as socially acceptable as possible, in case anyone could smell anything over the smoke.  He still couldn't figure out why people would use Febreze when it cost so much more than plain alcohol and had a horrible artificial fragrance to boot.  Lack of chemistry knowledge, apparently. Then he phoned the police.
"Oh, no.  She's my 'work wife'," Sherlock laughed.  This perplexed the clerk greatly, and her face made a rather intriguing transition from laughter to confusion, and then back to polite smiling.  With that, Sherlock headed off towards the security line and whats-her-name headed off wherever.
"I'm so sorry.  I was supposed to meet my girlfriend here, and I thought she was on the seventeenth floor--"
John heard steps crossing the kitchen and saw a shadow loom over him. A flashlight shined into his eyes as the other man crouched down, and then withdrew quickly with a scream just as Bobby started growling. John twisted around and half sat up and saw that that Bobby had bitten down onto this Sherlock-impostor's ankle and had locked his jaws.
It was too dark to track down his money clip tonight. Sherlock moved out to the grassy median next to the overpass. It would probably be unwise to return to the same spot to sleep. He lay down in the high yellow grass and went to sleep.
"You'll never get her back this way," Sherlock shouted.  "You're too scared to climb out of that tank, and meet her face to face.  Any MAN who was not afraid of women would hardly wrap a giant metal tank around himself."  Sherlock hoped he wouldn't be reduced to making imitation chicken noises at the demon.
Sherlock looked up the website for the cemetery on his phone.  Oddly enough for an American cemetery, it had a movie night.  Apparently tonight would be "Howl's Moving Castle" followed by "Rashomon".
The man licked his lips, and some drool came out of the corner of his mouth.  That was kind of strange.  Or actually, it wasn't drool.  A drop beaded up and thunked onto the desk the man had pushed himself back from.  Then the surface of the desk began smoking.  More and more drops poured out of the man's mouth, hitting the desk, and dripping onto the floor as he backed up and came around the desk towards Sherlock.
Sherlock still hadn't managed to find himself a human with the flesh still on who had plowed a field without the aid of animals, but he was always hopeful.
Well, time to grab the bull by the horns.  Sherlock strode up, reached down, and grabbed one of the panes of glass.
Just after crossing under the freeway, the neighbourhood changed considerably.
He waited until the steam stopped, and then cautiously climbed up the ladder again.  There was nothing in the tank except the sediment at the bottom; even the walls of the tank were dry now.  He climbed down the ladder.  Apparently there had been no point in rinsing out his coat.  Just as he was taking off the coat, he felt a pain in his left arm.  He pulled the coat off, and twisted his jacket and shirt around so he could see the painful area through the slash.  One of the mystic-looking tattoos was smoking and fading.  He hadn't noticed that happen at the tugboat or in front of the shop.
The man in the suit turned his hand, and there was another airline ticket that he pressed upon Sherlock.    "If you're going to keep rounding up demons anyway, you might as well get cracking.  See you soon."
"I'M NOT A CHICKEN!  YOU'RE A CHICKEN!"
He checked to make sure he hadn't lost his knife, and that it hadn't cut its way out of his pocket.  No one had ever asked that before.  How novel.  The demons mostly just attacked him, or occasionally claimed not to be demons.  A few, tiresomely, insisted on recounting their crimes defiantly, but none had straightforwardly asked to be let go.
"What's your name?"

Sherlock wondered what he was doing there.  As the other man leaned back into Sherlock's booth, Sherlock asked, "So, that counts towards the 113, right?"
Sherlock pulled his chin back quickly, like a spooked animal, as John reached for him, and then got control of himself and pointed his chin forward again.  Sherlock was panting and looking extremely agitated, and his eyes were tearing up. "God! You're burning up!" John said as he lifted Sherlock's chin.
"I don't know what your tattoo is, but I know I just saw an aura around you.  Something is uncanny about you, certainly."
Sherlock leaned back behind his corner, and thought how he might get at the glass man without having his eye put out, or possibly even more difficult, figure out which part of the glass man was the eye.  If Sherlock had been a stained glass man, he would've covered himself with fake eyespots like orcas, so that someone going for his eyes would be misled.
The inside of the tugboat was unpleasant.  It wasn't a smell or the temperature, but it felt very off.  Maybe it was the shape of the place.  The floor slanted, and the ceiling slanted, too.   And the low, slanting ceiling was made even more impassable by all the pipes and things running along the hallway above his head.  He definitely had to hunch over not to knock his head.  When he was on the dock, he would have said that the boat was dead still, but he could feel it rock now that he was aboard.
He set his phone down and looked at his arms again.  He only had 14 of the sigils on his skin left--13 on his chest, and one on his left arm.  He could leave his sleeves rolled up now without looking like the most vapid sort of criminal.  It made sense, though, that as more demons were caught, they had a much larger average distance between them and would be harder to find.
Sherlock leapt up onto the front of the tank and stamped his foot on the deck.  He had to jump off the top to avoid being swept off by the gun as it turned.  He bounded out of the way of the treads, and prepared his verbal arsenal.
Sherlock had an instant to feel offended before he felt as though all his skin was burning. Smoke twisted out from under his clothes, and there was a nauseating burned meat smell. Sherlock found he was on his hands and knees, gagging.
Sherlock saluted her with the can, and had a sip.  It was extremely sweet, with an aftertaste he supposed would be more difficult to detect had it been cold.
As they landed at LAX, the sky looked really strange.  The middle of the sky was a dark gray brown, and down by the horizon, it was a Martian red.  All around, the fire alarms in buildings were going off, and fire truck sirens went back and forth frequently.  The smoke didn't bother Sherlock, but the smoke felt even thicker than Los Angeles' usual, past Bangkok's, even.  It was rare to see Americans wearing dust masks or surgical masks on any occasion, but today they were wearing them.
"You delight in leaping.  You should do it."
There was indeed an escape hatch under there, but he just could not get to it.  He had hopes of using Lestrade's ID to unscrew it as the money clip was too thick for that purpose, but the tank just would not hold still.
He wandered through the building, checking the stairwells and hallways, listening at doors, and reviewing what he knew about the place.  Richard Ramirez had stayed there--a rapist, murderer, and mutilator of the dead.  Called himself The Night Stalker, currently at San Quentin.  A member of the jury for his murder trial died, but turned out to have been murdered by her boyfriend.
Another bus pulled up to the stop, and a man wearing black-and-white striped pants and nothing else, who was covered in dirt, rolled off of the bus shelter seats and onto the concrete.  Another man seated in the bus stop remained hunched over whatever he had in his hands and was holding a lighter to.
"That's very kind of you."  The expensive-looking black box was the size that contained ten cigars.
Working his way North, Sherlock looked up and saw that above street-level, there was one building that stood out greatly from all the blue glow on it.  There were just the typical swirls of blue and the occasional swirl of gray truthfulness amongst the pedestrians around him, but up high, one building stood out for being entirely aglow in blue.  It reminded Sherlock of a movie John had once insisted upon watching in his presence.  Took place in New York City, dark haired woman in a red dress, demon dog, light going up to the sky-couldn't remember much about it, really, except that John had asked him pointedly if the woman reminded him of anyone.  There weren't demon dogs, were there?  Ugh, there probably were.
He had supposed she would always be there.  And she wasn't even murdered.  There was no one to chase down and catch for having done it.  The only guilty party was time.
"Maybe I've joined a faith that doesn't believe in taking gifts from you."
Speaking of last meals, when was the last time Sherlock ate?  It seemed late.  He checked his phone, which said 2:13 am.  The only things still open would be near the bars.  A Japanese restaurant, with a sign saying "Open 24 Hours" in white letters on a red awning appeared to fit the bill.  A disheveled man with a woman tucked under his arm stumbled out of the restaurant into Sherlock's path, looking him up and down.  "Why you wearing a coat like that?  You got a tail?"  The girlfriend snickered, and they staggered away.
Besides the blood draw and the eye exam, John also found himself shanghaied into doing a 12-lead EKG, and an electronic fingerprinting.  Eventually, he had worked his way through all the testing equipment that had been brought.
She stood still as he got his knife out and tried to calculate the best and quickest angle.  She blinked uncontrollably as he leaned in towards her, but she never moved her head.
He circled the building.  There wasn't even a need to talk his way in or catch the door as someone entered or exited.  One of the outside doors in back was propped open with tape to keep the lock from closing.  He went up one floor and started walking down the hall.
Now the man was really working himself into a lather.  His sentences were becoming very short and disjointed.  As the man turned the tank toward Sherlock, he turned too sharply, and one track rode up onto one of the concrete Jersey barriers in the truck lanes.  The demon began to lurch the tank back and forth to attempt to free it.  Black smoke puffed out of the tank's exhaust in gouts as he switched between forward and reverse.
Sherlock hadn't previously thought religion was something to take into consideration.
That was actually interesting, despite the woman's best efforts.
"Sherlock, Darling.  You never call, you never write.  I haven't seen your signature on one paper in years.  Are you avoiding me?"
Sherlock turned to face him.  "What do you want?" he asked.
"It doesn't look quite right.  Draw another," he said, and handed the vial to John.
Sherlock walked back anticlockwise around the building, and let himself behind a segment of concrete barrier to empty everything out of his pockets onto the tarmac.  Crouching, he set out his phone, his keys, his money clip, one of Lestrade's ID's, a squash ball, four bump keys, an upper left lateral human incisor, and a 250 millilitre wash bottle of isopropyl alcohol.
Then they circled the table, Sherlock walking backwards, until Sherlock stepped on the staple remover piece.  He pulled his foot up quickly and involuntarily looked down.  Mackler tackled him, landing on top of his legs, and then Sherlock swung at his eyes with the other staple remover half, and Mackler grabbed his arm, in an iron grip.  Sherlock twisted and pushed in every combination he knew, but he couldn't get free.  Sherlock reached into his coat pocket, hoping some solution would present itself.  He found the gold drop there.  He wondered if it would have any effect at all, having its origin in Mackler himself, but here went nothing.
But getting back to the case at hand, if none of the remains were related by DNA, presumably they weren't one nuclear family.  They could have been two couples, though.  It would be fairly difficult to subdue four people at the same time, and there was no gunpowder residue on any of the remains, according to Gutteridge.  No detectable drugs in their systems, but the remains had been floating in water, and weren't especially large anyway.
"Yep.  Got it in one.  You know how it is; somebody's child goes overseas on holiday and they never hear from them again.  I was thinking about all those spare feet that washed up."
