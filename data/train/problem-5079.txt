Dean feels a deep chill run through his entire body. His bones start to ache along with his skin. The air he breathes becomes dusty and cool.
We start to leave but Dr. Clarke grabs my wrist and leans close to my ear so Cas can’t hear what she’s saying, “Mr Winchester, if the shyness and fear continues, you might want to consider getting him a therapist. He’s been through an awful lot. If you ever need to see exactly what happened, you can put in a request for my report that is also being sent to the cops.” When she finishes speaking to me, she leans away. “Eddie, take care ok? You’re in good hands.”
It really was nice to get away from everything for a while.
“…everything.” I reply softly, unable to stop myself from tilting my head down and placing the lightest of kisses on the top of his head.
“Told ‘em. I told ‘em.” He mutters, shaking his head as he walks over towards a rather large crowd. It’s always busiest at the back and the boat holds a fair few people, so it’s like a needle in a haystack finding a couple of tiny kids. Goddamn.
His phone beeped. He dared to look at it.
I don’t notice my brain screaming at me
“Do you think anyone is still around? Your mom or…?” Dean wonders. Anyone to give an extra hand.
?! That’s an understatement.” Gabe scoffs. “But whatever, they’re Michael’s problem. Lucky for us we just have this little monkey to deal with.” Gabe points at Jimmy.
The kiss is open-mouthed, and Cas is carding his fingers through my hair. I carry on moving my lips against his and we stay like this for a while. Eyes closed, slow, gentle, beautiful, blissful.
As I am falling asleep, my mind wanders to when Cas was human before; when I told him to leave the bunker and when he spent a long while between sleeping areas and locations. What did he do about his problems then?
“I was worked up about mom and also tired and hungry-“
Dean snorts. “Noted.”
“Good walk?” I ask, circling the car to help Cas out.
is fighting their own battles. This is yours, and it really hasn’t been easy for you. I can see that, and everyone else can see that too. Think: you just saw something happen to your
Sam nods and is gone for a while until he comes in with a bottle of cold beer. I smile my thanks and he leaves again. As soon as the alcohol hits the back of my throat I relax and relish the taste of the slightly bitter liquid.
“How’s the fever?” Dean asks, moving a little closer to Cas so the moment is more private.
“Ugh, fine.” I throw my arms up and we wait another couple of minutes.
“Okay, now wrap your hand around your dick.” I do as he says. “Yep that's right, now move your hand up and down.”
“Uh, no.”
Claire walks up to Cas and also gives him a tight hug. “Thanks again.” She tells him genuinely. “I’ll see you round?”
“Oh no.” Jimmy says, then wobbles a little but stays upright.
I reluctantly let go of Cas and stare at the vial of grace in his hand. “Are you-are you gonna use it?”
Cas looks back at the cats and sees that Jimmy has not moved an inch. His eyes are fixed on the kitten. He looks so excited bless him.
“I do now.”
“Come on, buddy. Here, sit up.” I encourage him best I can, but it ends up being me turning him over and grabbing hold of his shoulders and pulling him upright slowly. His eyes are still firmly closed and I wonder whether he’s actually sleeping while sitting up like this, and his limp body is in fact telling me
He spots Dean a few booths across and heads towards him.
Cas is silent for a moment, then says simply “most definitely.”
“You are
“So.” David smiles kindly, gesturing openly with his hands. “I understand you’ve had some setbacks recently. That’s fine. I mainly asked to meet with you today so we can discuss what you might like to do moving on. I’m here to see Michael too so I thought I’d see you in person instead of on the phone.”
“Cas.” I mutter and he lifts his head, looking at me sadly.
“So you’re sure you’re okay?” Dean takes his hand, obviously seeing his shy side creeping in.
“Dean?” Cas asks even though a minute ago he said he didn’t have anything to say.
Before I know it though, his smile is gone and he is looking up at me, confused. I stare into his sapphire eyes for a few moments, and all that can be heard is Cas’ heavy breathing.
“Hey William.” He smiles.
A nurse quickly rushes through the door, taking in whatever situation Cas is in and seeming to know what to do.
“Bye.” Jimmy waves at them.
RJ leans closer “he
“Maybe we walked too far. C’mon, maybe you should rest for a while.” He suggested and Cas nodded, letting Dean help him get his coat off then walk to the bedroom.
“Yes.” Several people say in unison.
Gus shrugs. “He wouldn’t wake up after he was knocked down. We don’t know whether it was exhaustion or something, but we had to carry him back. And with the battle being so early in the morning, by the time he’d woken up again, we were all in here for food. He’d been out cold and had slept for like three hours in the hospital wing before coming up here and finding us.”
Cas lifts him and turns him around on his knee so he can make eye contact. “All right baby, look at me.” He leans down, encouraging Jimmy to look into his eyes. He does. Cas continues.
“Okay.” Jimmy agrees, letting Dean put him down before Jimmy takes his hand and leads him to the side of the room. Dean crouches and takes hold of Jimmy’s backpack.
in the restroom earlier.
Roan leans down next to Cas’ ear, smirking. “I heard you chickened out on the field today. Werewolf scare ya? Or are you too weak to defend your bony little ass?”
Nobody is around at all. Not anyone or…or any
He realizes he went completely off in his head and snaps back immediately, seeing Kate staring at him like he’s gone mad. “You still in there?” She puts her hands on her hips. “Dean, snap out of it.”
Despite the temperature, there were people kayaking around, their paddles rising then descending back into the water, allowing them to move forwards.
“Wassup Cas, how’s it hanging, huh? You missed out on
“Cas, whatever it is, I’ll understand.” He assures, trying to get the blankets out of my hands. I grip tighter. “Hey, look at me.” Dean says, and I risk looking into his green eyes. “Let me help. Whatever happened, I’m not going to think any different of you. We’re not going to judge you at all. I promise.”
“What happened?” He asks the slightly scruffy man in front of him. Cas sighs again.
“Y- you’re right. You’re right.” He takes in another deep breath. Dean gives him a few moments to catch his breath. It must be hard to breathe with damaged ribs. Dean can’t imagine what Cas is feeling right now.
“Let go Cas.” I command softly, and thankfully after a few moments of concentration, the angel relaxes and starts to fill the pot. I’d hold his hand to help him through it, but I don’t have any spare hands.
Dean feels Cas start to go lax in his arms. Dean cups his cheek. “Try and stay awake, babe.” He whispers. “Just for now.” Dean can’t explain the sinking feeling inside him. All he wants to do is let Cas sleep and curl up with him in bed, but he can’t.
Dean secures an arm around his waist, stopping him from crumpling from the pain from his ribs.
We step out of the shower together and get some towels from the side.
“Thank you.” He said, sipping at it for a few moments.
Considering I basically have nowhere to sleep, I begin to get comfortable on the couch, but a small noise (aside from Sam’s loud snoring) catches my attention.
“After he, uh, he said things about you and my father, he started, he-uh-he used a torture instrument. I could barely breathe, so I panicked and kicked him. He also hit me with a metal chain. I vomited and he cut me and-“ Cas pauses, scrunching up his eyes. These memories are clearly still raw and grating.

“I’m gonna make you feel so good Cas.” I murmur then kiss him back.  I move my hips up so I can rub us together like last time while I undo the cap on the lube and squirt some on my fingers, making sure it spreads everywhere before dropping the bottle and lowering my hand.
Dean, with one arm around Cas, reaches down to position his dick, guiding Cas down onto it. He supports a lot of Castiel’s weight as he lowers down, all the way until Cas is sitting in his lap. Dean keeps an arm around his back as he reaches over to drag the blankets towards them, pulling them around their legs before leaning to kiss Cas, long and slow.
“It’s not though, is it?”
He nods and licks his lips. “If
“Okay good.” Cas turns to Jimmy again. “We’re gonna grab some food at the next stop, alright?”
“Jeez.” Gabe shakes his head, looking Cas up and down for a moment. “Hey fidgetpants, chill out for a sec, okay?”

“Damnit to
him. I feel like if he’s not there, Omandriel is going to take me away again. Of course, I know it’s all nonsense because he’s dead, but I still think about it, y’ know? I need Dean here or I can’t go. Simple as that. I’m just too scared to tell him because he might tell me to ‘help myself’ like in that dream. I’m nervous about this because sooner or later, I’m not going to need him to lean on, and what happens then? This is bad,
“Here.” Dean said as he helped him into the bedroom.
I bolt over to catch him and expect to see him terrified out of his mind and broken, but no. There is a small smile ghosting his lips as he looks down at the glowing item in his hand. His grace.
“Dean?” Cas spoke up, leaning to meet his eyes.
“Will you be free at approximately,” the angel starts. He grabs my wrist and looks down at my watch before looking back up at Claire, “7:27pm tonight?”
“You’re very welcome.” She grins, clearly happy for him.
“It’s alright, it’s alright. It’s gonna be over soon. It’s okay.” He whispers to Jimmy, holding him tighter to help him feel more secure. “It’s okay.”
Clearing my throat, I turn to face Cas who is sitting on my right in the booth, “so, you got any idea where we can find the rest of these blades?”
“You just need to start practicing again when you’re feeling better, yeah? Then you can go back to using the potty.” Cas tries to make eye contact with his son and manages it eventually. “It’s all okay, Jimmy. It’s alright.”
“Yeah, sweetheart.” Dean replies with the best soothing voice he can muster. “Daddy’s just sleeping, that’s all. And you have me, too.”
brother.” Gabe tells him with comforting confidence. “Everyone else, too. You’re
gets it.
“Oh shut-”
“Man you’re really burning up.” He decided. Cas started to shiver.
. And do bear in mind that this
Dean exclaims, seeing the monsters charge further towards them. “Shit, we gotta do something! Do any of you dickheads have wings?” Dean turns to the angels.
Cas is still improving and will have his moments and so will I, but I reckon we’ll get by.
Dean is delighted with Cas’ reaction when he brings him the last piece of pie from yesterday. Dean
“Everything that’s happened tonight and all the stuff we talked about?”
He looks at the screen of the watch in his hand.
I hand him the small, wrapped up rectangular box and he looks down at it in his hands.
“Welcome to the family.” Gabriel throws his arms up. “I’m impressed. Nice one Cas.”
I hold Cas’ waist as he rubs the soapy water over his hands. When I look into the mirror, I watch his eyes nearly droop completely and then pop back open again.
Cas begins to feel a looming tiredness behind his eyes. He suppresses a yawn.
Uncle Vernon from The Sorcerer’s Stone.” Dean grosses himself out just thinking about it.
. Dean reckons he’s good at charming women, but also excellent at pissing them off. Sometimes both at the same time.
“I wonder how long I can do this for.” His boyfriend wondered, glancing back over his shoulder to see if anyone else was there.
I feel more tears leave my eyes. “I love you.” I wheeze, seeing blackness building in the corners of my eyes, slowly swallowing me whole like I’m being possessed. Except, this is death. It’s death.
“It’s ok, I got it.” I murmur back and trail my hands down his torso under his shirt until I reach the waistband of his pants. “You’re sure you’re okay with this? You’ll tell me if you wanna stop?”
“Eddie.” I look up at the doctor, her kind demeanour making me relax just a little. “Can you tell me how you feel about what happened?”

He lets go of Cas, neither of them speaking when Dean moves back. He gives himself space to move so he’s on one knee and- the rocks dislodge from underneath him and he
his army the moment it is executed.” The angels move around the table to stand at either side, staring down at a map. They begin gesturing to the area where they are planning to meet Lucifer’s army in another field that Dean half remembers. It seems to be one of the ones that he walked past after climbing that bitch of a hill.
“Dean.” He moaned as his felt a soft hand slip further into his boxers and play with his balls gently, the feeling of his dick being surrounded by hot wetness already dizzying him with pleasure.
“Suit yourself.” Omandriel shrugs and slides to knife across my forearm. I can feel beads of sweat forming across my hairline from the pain and the effort of not dropping my head onto the spikes.
“Fuck Cas.” I breathe amazedly, laying back down on him. That was freaking amazing.
“You mean so much to me, and to know that you’ve been through that, well, it-it just breaks my heart.”
Cas rolls his eyes. Again.
Dean moved in the rest of the way and waited for Cas to adjust. He breathed through the full feeling, shifting around a little until he was comfortable.
“I guess you could fold up all the clean clothes so they fit better in the bag?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, good idea. We’ll bare that in mind.” Dean shuffles closer to Cas and kneels at the bedside. Cas turns his head to look at him and Dean can just
He nibbles on my neck and sucks on pulse point gently, straddling my hips when I move my knee back down.
. Me and Sam want to help you heal. You’ve been brave, and don’t ever think you’re worthless. You’re like a brother to me and I would never want you to leave. I know you’ve tried to talk to me before and I pushed you away. I’m assuming this is what you wanted to talk about before and I’m sorry for telling you to go. But now, I’m here and I’m listening. I need you to tell me about this stuff, and if I’m
P.S...
“If that’s your logic, Cas, then you’re never going to get laid.” I chuckle.
“Bye.” Dean embraces Jimmy and gives him a big teddy bear hug. “I’ll see you later, kid. Call us anytime you want, okay?”
He smiles warmly at me, his azure eyes filled with joy and love.
“Dead.” He shrugged. “Talked to Jo a lot which kept the mood up though.”
“You and mom left me.” She cries more.
“Yeah. I probably would have fallen over by now if we were still on the beach.” Dean jokes lightly, seeing that they thankfully don’t have too far to walk to get home. It’s nearly twelve so Dean’s getting pretty hungry. He does have to admit, he’s tired too. They were both up for most of the night.
“You are in for a long night, Castiel. If I were you, I’d shut that big mouth of yours and do what
I launch myself forward at Crowley and pin him against the wall, “shut. It. Or I’ll stab you with this knife right here, right now.”
Dean stands up and joins them, placing a supportive hand to Cas’ back. Dean dances with them to the upbeat music and Cas deems it a success in cheering his son up. He knew that what Luke had called him would trouble him another time. Maybe he should talk to Jimmy about bringing it up in his progress sessions. Maybe Paul and Hayley will know how to approach it with him better than Cas can.
“Shh.” He cuts me off, seeming a little, well, sensitive.
And no, I will
I blush a darker shade of red and grumble “no” firmly, but Sam sees straight through me. “Anyway, two can play at that game, bitch.” I claim, grabbing my phone and opening up the screenshot of Sam’s angry face.
Jimmy starts and Dean is aware he’s thinking through his words.
Castiel looks up at the nurse, turning the words around in his head. She’s right. He doesn’t need to put on any facades and fake being sad about Naomi. He can just tell himself he’s being virtuous. That makes the whole situation feel better. He’s showing virtue, not anything else. And, if anything, that’s what he was planning on doing anyway, but the nurse has confirmed he’s doing the right thing, and now he feels a wave of calm suddenly making its way through him.
Me and Jody join everyone back in the main room.
“What is it?” Dean frowns and walks over to Cas. He kneels by the bed and slides a hand into Cas’ hair. “Ribs hurt?”
“Very good point…I just hope that, in his speedy swallowing, Dean hasn’t accidentally ingested a hair.” Cas smiles, looking over at Dean.
“Alright.” Cas looks at Dean. “How long have we got left?”
“I know you know that, but you have to realise that if you start getting all overpowering like that, it’s going to scare him.”
They both nod. “Thanks mom.”
We travel for another two hours, but have to stop when I realise that me and Cas didn’t actually get chance to eat anything this morning.
Ok, now I’m getting annoyed.
“He thought it was a good idea at the time. But that’s in the past, and we’re in the present.”
They both look towards Bartholomew. “Come here William, it’s okay.”
“Yes please.”
“What you gonna go for Cas?” I ask the angel next to me as he eyes up the sandwiches.
“I’ve never felt like this about anyone before.” I decide, listening to the faint noises of the trees rustling their leaves outside the bunker.
He gulps down around half of it down before handing it back to me. “Did it go well?” He rasps out.
flannel in a twist?” He responds coolly.
It started when Cas began shuffling around, mumbling nonsense. That’s what woke me up. I thought it was nothing but he started stressing out and fidgeting like I’ve never seen him fidget before; not even while awake.
Dean glances at Cas who looks about two minutes away from passing out. “And go
“…I…I know? You’re here now-”
Dean frowns, wondering why Cas is so…well, he doesn’t know really. Why he’s so on edge maybe. Like, is he nervous? Anxious? Angry? Dean has absolutely no idea what’s going on with him.
“I know.” Jimmy nods in agreement, jumping across different colored concrete tiles on the path. “Dean, do you promise that daddy’s going to be okay?”
Cas seems to understand the mood Dean is trying to set, and happily starts making out with Dean, gasping every so often when Dean’s hand syncs with his dick.
Daniel holds his fist out and Jimmy, carefully so he gets it right, gives him a bro fist.
“Well, no, not exactly-“
There is another silence and Dean prays that it isn’t making the little boy upset. His heart would break having to hear Jimmy cry and not be able to hug him and make him feel better.
“Yeah, well at least I didn’t get bitch slapped in the middle of the high school cafeteria for cheating on Emilia Jameson.” Sam shoots back.
I nod and help him towards the closed door. “Are you bothered about sitting at the table or do you want to watch something on the TV?”
Dean smiles at his mom just as they enter the main entrance, not needing to go to reception since they already know the area that Castiel is in.
After around an hour when Dean has nearly drifted off to sleep, the room door suddenly opens and someone walks in quietly before closing the door behind them. Dean keeps his eyes sealed shut tight when he feels the person’s presence directly in front of him by the bed.
Gabe strokes the back of Jimmy’s head when he pushes closer into his chest.
“Cas?” I mutter to him quietly. He looks down at his hands and opens them out, inspecting them.
“Thank you.” I reply, thinking about how I feel about Dean.
I bend down a little so I can aim for Cas before telling him that he can go now, but nothing happens. Yeah, this is weird because he so obviously
that’s because
Cas shook his head and laughed quietly. He was too awkward for random photos. “It’ll look weird because I’m shit at posing for photos.”
“M-my daddy won’t wake up…he-he won’t wake up!” He can’t help that he’s crying. He is so scared. “Why won’t he wake up?”
Dean checks his watch. “About twelve thirty.”
We pull back and make our way back inside the diner, smiling, hand in hand.
“It’s gonna be alright. Omandriel and his guys are gone now. I’ve got you. You’re safe. Nothing like that is gonna happen
“When have you

to his life. He did have one idea. He’d always
I examine and fiddle for a while with the buttons until water starts spraying out of the shower head. I jump out of the way quickly and smile at my achievement before turning to Cas. “I got it on.” I smile and approach him. “Hoodie first?”
Cas looked at her through his eyebrows his frown was so deep. “What?”
“I didn’t mean it like that.” Dean’s friend rolls his eyes. “
It’s hard for him because all he wants to do is breathe because he feels like he isn’t getting enough air, but he can’t let instinct get in the way of this. He needs to breathe slow. Breathe through the pain.
“It’s okay.” Cas replied, turning around and sitting back against the headboard, watching the messages carry on popping up on his screen. They were getting angrier.
They haven’t kissed like this for a long time.
He licks his lips, stalling for a moment or two so he can decide how much he’s going to share. He’s aware that Cas wants to keep a lot of things on the down-low but this is Rachel. His mother.
Charlie, who is sitting on the other side of me, holds on to the paper for me when I have torn it away.
Plopping down next to him, I sigh and grab the backpack we brought with us.
However, before long, I realise that the nightmare caused something worse. There is a huge uncomfortable pressure in my lower abdomen and…oh god no.
“Yeah, it seems fine. Just gotta wait a week or so for some results. Everything ok with the money?”
Cas moves his hand to the back of my neck and pulls me closer, our bodies flush together. The amount of emotion in this kiss is nearly overwhelming, and I can’t comprehend how strongly I feel towards Castiel. He’s everything I’m not, and it has taken me too long to realise it.  Much too long.
“Aw Cas.” I smirk and he rolls his eyes. “Sasstiel.”
“She’s fucking…she just…” Dean sighed, slumping back down on the couch next to him. “I can’t-
It doesn’t take us long to get to the lake because, like Jody said, it’s only a mile walking. Even now we’re at the lake, we’ll be waiting for another fifteen minutes for the others to meet us.
someone will tell him either. He has to walk up a massive hill first.
Cas can’t believe it. He can’t believe his ears. He himself
We wanted to celebrate Christmas properly this year, so yeah, we’ve invited our family, because one wise, drunk, gruff, friend once said: family don’t end with blood.
“I guess it’s kinda cute. In an odd way.” He smiles at it, finding the look on its face amusing.
Jimmy reaches over and takes a handful of Cas’ sweater, holding tight.
Cas finds a huge smile break across his face. “You’re serious?” Gabe nods. “That’d be amazing.” He beams, hugging his brother.
“Isn’t real. It’s not real.” Dean runs a thumb across his cheekbone. “What you saw must be horrible - I can’t imagine – but just look at me, Cas. Look at me and let the image slip away. Because that
“I found tuna.” Gabe stands up with a smile and a tin of tuna. “Whack it between some bread slices and do it just like grilled cheese.”
to be filthy.”
I walk him over to the bathroom and discover we have a bit of a problem. “Uh, Cas, can you stand on your own?” I ask letting go of the angel to test that theory. He’s stable for a couple of seconds before he begins to sway and I have to catch him. “Do you think you can like, go, or?” I ask, feeling slightly embarrassed for Cas. I mean, what, he can’t even pee on his own now? It’d take too long if he just sat down, too. We’d have to mess with his trousers and everything.
why he’s crying, and it makes me feel warm inside knowing that he’s crying because he’s happy.
“They’re not at all amiable, Dean. They…” Cas glances around, lowering his voice in fear of being heard “they are awful. They run this place like a prison, just like you said. And I tell you something, my friend; it is
“What happened?”
Immediately after this, I spot the pie and decide that will be enough for me. Well, because pie is pie and I love pie.
Dean fake gasps. “How could you think that?”
They pushed themselves up off the couch and headed for the bedroom promptly. Well, Cas decided to make a quick detour to the bathroom. He knew that in all of the movies no one ever made a detour like this during a sex scene, but that just makes them seem inhuman. Of course, in his opinion, who doesn’t need to pee after coming? Because he always did. And besides, he’d had like two coffees before sitting down with Dean, so naturally he was desperate. Sue him, Hollywood.
.” I snap and grab his arm tightly, but immediately regret it when he gasps in terror, still trying to get away.
“Yeah, that’s the plan.” He smiles jokily.
I feel the tears brimming my eyes, and feel another stream of blood leave my mouth. “We both know that’s not true Dean.” My voice breaks on his name, partly due to the pain in my chest and then partly because of the tears flowing out of my eyes.
“Feeling ok?”
Michael has a short fuse. That’s all there is to it.
“That’s right, yes.”
“Okay.” Cas smiles, pressing a kiss to the top of Jimmy’s head. “And, well, I’m ready now. Do you still want to go outside?”
“Dork!” I shout through a laugh.
I’ve always liked Cas. The only problem has been me not admitting to myself that I wanted this to happen. All of the crap we’ve been through together has bonded us in ways like no other. All of the mistakes, bad decisions, good decisions, everything. Only now am I beginning to realise that maybe, just maybe, the little light in my life that keeps me going is this angel. And only now am I realising how much I’ve wanted to do this for so long. I can’t see my life without Cas anymore. This little blue-eyed, high frequency wave is who I have fallen for, and I couldn’t be more happy. I don’t have a proper home, but I have my car, my brother and my angel, and that is more than I could possibly ask for.
“C’mere.” Dean lifts him onto his lap and wraps both arms around him to keep him warm. “Soooo, tonight daddy has a fever and he’s really
Cas nods, accepting his answer. “I…it’s okay. She was gonna find out sometime. I know she likes to ask questions.” He huffs in amusement. “I’m surprised she hasn’t grilled you even more than that to be honest.”
“You do? Well, you’re very clever, you know that?”
“…okay.”
I say nothing, grasping at the covers uncomfortably.
Cas’ eyelashes flutter and Dean finally gets a glimpse of two blue eyes. He opens his mouth slowly in an attempt to speak but no words come. He jerks, turning to the side with a cough.
“Ready to get out of here?”
“I didn’t mean anything,” Dean lied through his teeth. “I’ve just had too much to drink.”
“Dean? I’m sorry.”
Here he was. The perpetual brave little soldier, talking about things that scared him. What had Cas done to him?
“That’s...correct,” Cas conceded. “But that was many years ago, Dean. And I don’t think you’ve forgotten all that’s happened between us since.”
“You’re getting a
“Don’t worry about it,” Dean said gruffly, turning away and pulling the curtain closed behind him. “Just don’t use up the hot water before I’m finished. And don’t you dare take the big blue towel, that’s my favorite.”
Castiel’s eyes went wide. He must have misheard him.
“God, I love you,” Dean said, so softly he wasn’t sure if it had been out loud or only in his head.
They took a walk down the deck, the wind in their hair taking on a chill.
He was almost bitter that after all this time, spending the night (however innocently) with Cas for the first time was something he barely remembered. Now that he’d been so close, so intimate with him, he felt robbed now that Cas was no longer in his arms.
“What’s that face?”
“Oh my god, Dean!” Finally, a voice he knew. “Andrew, go find him!”
“So, you guys signing up?” asked Speedo Brian.
Layers continued to peel off as they explored each other’s skin. When Cas’ jacket and shirt were gone and Dean was down to his boxers, Cas pulled him closer with a hand at the small of his back, then kissed him again, gripping Dean’s thighs as they rocked together for a moment. Cas backed off him and stood at the foot of the bed, the corner of his mouth quirking upward as Dean felt himself being surveyed. He was hard, anticipating what might follow. There was evidence straining against Cas’ zipper that the feeling was mutual, but Dean was stuck on his expression, the same intense look he’d been given a thousand times before, now seen for what it truly meant.
“Hello, Dean.”
Dean’s breath hitched against his will. They hadn’t spent the previous night together in the cabin, but it sounded like Cas was joining him now. He stood up, wobbling slightly, and Cas reached out to steady him again.
He looked between Sam and Cas, helplessly outvoted. “I thought...Sam and I would just board the ship, pretending to be a couple, but I’d
“I...wanted to take a shower?” Cas told him, without a hint of sarcasm. Dean stared at the ceiling, exasperated, but with a hidden touch of fondness for the former angel who still didn’t quite fit in with humans. He was the same guy Dean had come to-
Dean followed him into a simple off-white room, with three pews on either side and a pair of prayer rugs on the floor behind them. There was an altar of sorts at the front with a variety of religions represented; some he recognized, some he didn’t. Cas sat in a pew on the right and slid down, making room for Dean to join him.
“I’m just...I’m scared, man.”
. Dean had tried to shake off the feeling he got thinking of Cas moving around him as he slept, maybe even undressing next to the bed. He hadn’t been particularly successful.
He noticed the way Cas’ shoulders fell with a sigh before he nodded.
Dean raised a hand to his head, remembering the impact. Cas must have just healed him in front of plenty of people. That might take some explaining.
Dean dug in his duffel bag and came out with a loose white linen shirt and khaki shorts, tossing them at Cas. “See how those fit.”
He would still have to contend with thinking of himself as damaged goods, but Dean was starting to understand that damaged didn’t necessarily mean unsalvageable. Dean was cracked, from all of life’s traumas chipping away at him, but nothing glue and a little tenderness couldn’t fix. Cas seemed to think he was worth the effort, and he trusted Cas. They were both complete, and deserving of love. So, so much.
The rest of the day was full of mixed signals—Cas touching him, but not enough, looking at him, but with expressions he couldn’t read. It was driving Dean mad. Sometimes he missed the old days when Cas hadn’t yet learned how to hide what he was thinking. By the time the evening came, Dean was next to Cas in a hot tub, a calculated distance apart, with little idea, through his extended daze, of how they’d gotten there. Others walked by from time to time, but they were mostly, blessedly alone, their only other companionship a low-level constant hum that came from a nearby poolside bar. Dean held a glass of whiskey to his lips, then sat it down next to Cas’ trench coat, which lay piled in a heap on the deck.
Dean had spent years exercising some level of restraint with Cas. He hardly had to think about it anymore— holding himself back was automatic. Here and now, though, it was torture. Until lately, every impulse he’d had toward anything more than friendship had been easily brushed away, ignored in favor of their current hunt or the latest apocalypse. Now, with literally nothing between them, tension had given way to urgent want, a deep yearning for Cas to kiss him, hold him, undress him.
He placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder. The significance of the placement wasn’t lost on either of them; sometimes Dean could still feel the handprint burned into his skin. There was a light grip, a touch they’d shared a hundred times before, but this time, Cas didn’t let go. Dean stood still, unsure of what to do but unwilling to be the one to break contact. Cas was staring intently at him, as if he was trying to memorize Dean’s face, every line, every freckle, while he still could.
Dean scanned the words on each card, smiling at some, wrinkling his brow at others. He wasted a few seconds looking up at Castiel, who sat silently under his blindfold, which was an image not great for Dean’s concentration. He’d barely finished writing on the last card when the host’s voice interrupted him.
“Just give them your room number at any of the bars or restaurants, and the drinks will be free!” he told them, perky in the kind of way only a man wearing a fake sailor outfit could be expected to be.
Cas’ smile fell slightly. “What is it?”
“Yeah.” Cas arched an eyebrow at him. “Says me.”
Dean bent down, sweeping the items out from under their chairs. He stood up, carrying the blindfold, and stood behind Cas.
“Uh, hey,” Dean said, leaning against the bar in a failed attempt at acting casual. “How’s it going?”
“Well,” Cas began, “when you got home from hunting, you went to take a shower.”
Cas shook his head. “I said I could stand a little more waiting. I never wanted you to think I didn’t…”
“So? Couples fight.”
Walking past the kitchen on his way back to his bedroom, Dean doubled back as he caught a whiff of Sam’s spicy chili. “Hey, smells good!”
“I think I’m gonna sit this hand out and get a drink,” Dean said. “Cas, you want anything?”
“No, I’m getting a tan.”
Cas shrugged. “You never know. I might need it.”
Dean scoffed. It wasn’t like he wanted Cas to follow him or watch as he walked away, but the apparent complete lack of concern still stung a bit. As much as the thought of more booze nauseated him, when he saw an open-air bar on the edge of the beach, he parked himself on a stool.
Dean didn’t really have a good answer to that. “I’d.... I’d hate to miss our trademark Winchester Christmas.”
They stepped aboard, observing the crowds of people milling around. A few were already taking their shirts off and diving into a massive pool in the center of the deck.
Cas frowned, and Dean felt himself blush when he realized he’d spoken the last thought aloud.
He heard nothing else before succumbing to the darkness.
“We’re allowed to leave?”
. Dean removed his hand and found himself, worryingly, already missing the brief contact.
Castiel squinted at her. “I don’t—”
“Didn’t seem like you were protesting too forcefully.”
Dean could only kiss him back in response, deeply, tenderly, trying to pour the last five years of escalating feelings into it. When they finally broke apart, Cas leaned in and rested their foreheads together. Dean didn’t know what came next between them, didn’t know if they could overcome his fear of fucking this up. This was just a first step, and he hoped that all the talking, categorizing, overanalyzing of whatever their relationship had just become could be delayed as long as possible. God knew words were hard enough for the two of them, but this, holding Cas and kissing him and never wanting to let go...
They looked up at the gigantic vessel, tall enough to cast its shadow over the parking lot. The rolling sloshes of the waves made the base of a soundscape, layered with the voices of excited passengers and the calls of seagulls hoping to pilfer snacks from the crowd. After they made their way to the dock, Dean handed their boarding passes to a cheerful woman in a white visor to scan.
“I guess I did.” Dean gave a nervous laugh. “But hey, when have I ever been right, right?”
Most of Christmas Day was spent on the beach, their wet skin sticking to each other with every touch after surreptitious fondling among the waves. Cas was helping rub sunscreen onto Dean’s shoulders again, both able to properly enjoy it this time. Dean still couldn’t believe his luck. It was so nice, being affectionate even when eyes weren’t on them. No more pretending. His body held a satisfying soreness from the night before, but tiny worries still dug at the back of Dean’s mind.
He made his way to Dean’s door and tried to quietly open it, hoping Dean’s multiple drinks over dinner and Yahtzee were helping him sleep deeply. Cas peered in, smiling when he saw Dean sprawled on his stomach, one leg out of the covers, holding a pillow.
“I don’t have to explain myself to you.” Dean stood up, shaking sand off himself. “We barely know each other, and you don’t know Cas and I’s relationship.”
He crossed to the door and pulled it open. Castiel was standing in the hallway in his white button-down and slacks, coat and jacket left behind. His face was unreadable; a mix of concern, apprehension, and something else Dean couldn’t place.
He heard the sink shut off in the bathroom, followed by Cas emerging in a t-shirt and sweatpants. Dean must have gotten through to him on the unnaturalness of wearing the same outfit all the time; if he hadn’t, he was sure Cas would have put his trenchcoat back on the moment he was off the ship’s deck.
“Sorry to bother you, I know it’s late,” Cas said. “It’s just… I don’t really sleep, and I thought maybe you were still up, and I wanted to talk to you.”
Probably.
Dean rolled his eyes but complied, smearing white lotion across his face and chest. “Better?”
“It’s empty, come on.”
Castiel looked up from his book as two guys sat on the chair next to him, one striking up conversation. They were young and attractive, and one wore a speedo with a cutoff white shirt that showed off his midriff. He leaned closer to Cas and casually touched his arm, then said something that made him laugh, a rare sight that made irritation itch under Dean’s skin. He only realized he’d frozen in place this whole time when someone slammed into him while trying to catch a beach ball bouncing around the pool. Had they been on a hunt, getting so distracted ogling Cas could mean them ending up werewolf chow. Shaking off the embarrassing image, Dean pulled himself out of the pool and started walking toward them.
“It’s just,” she resumed tentatively when he didn’t respond. “You two seemed so happy and attached at the hip when we met, and at the game show. Now he’s nowhere to be seen and you’re here doing body shots off of someone young enough to be your kid.”
was of concern. His eyes flew open as his brain launched into panic mode. What had happened last night? He had a vague recollection of nightmares, and Cas...
Dean folded his clothes neatly, leaving them on a bench on the opposite wall before dragging himself into the shower stall and starting the water. It had been a long day on the road, and he needed to feel clean before he could think of enjoying the dinner Sam was preparing. He’d considered checking on Cas as soon as they got home, but the thought of bringing him a surprise meal in his room afterward and taking him up on that Nick-at-Nite marathon had won out.
Cas broke the silence first. “I don’t
“But you did.”
Jingly Christmas music played across the crowded decks as the ship departed the shore, poking at something in Dean’s memory.
. Cas who’d been on this journey with them for a decade and alive for millennia before, who had seen things on an unbelievable cosmic scale but still seemed to think Dean was worth more than a passing glance. Dean knew he was attractive and charming on the surface, but the idea that anyone who knew him so well and had seen him at his lowest would still want him was still a difficult concept to grasp.
“I want
Cas took Dean’s hand, rubbing his thumb over it, trailing grains of sand over his skin. “What do you want to happen?”
“I don’t hear—”
trapped, jeez.”
spend six days scoring with desperate housewives and cute activities directors.”
“You deserve a vacation,” Cas agreed. “You deserve so much more than the world has given you.”
The door into the hallway opened a crack and cast a sliver of light on the bed. Dean could hear Cas mumble something, but it didn’t completely register to him in his semi-conscious state.
He kissed Cas, a quick peck that nonetheless left them both smiling ear to ear, then let his fingers trail down Cas’ bare arm before backing away. Dean didn’t think it would be easy to fit two people in the tiny shower stall in their cabin’s bathroom, but it might be worth a try.
“Don’t.”
Dean stared at him, stone-faced, but the man’s teeth remained on display as he urged the two of them in front of the backdrop.
Dean had been made to feel important through hunting, even chosen in the case of being Michael’s vessel, but tonight was the first time he’d ever felt
could certainly make things interesting.
The door shut behind Cas, and Dean felt himself rouse a bit at the noise. He spent his last moments before sleep took him wondering how much of the last few minutes he’d hallucinated. How much he could force himself to forget.
“I’ve been trying to tell you,” came a familiar voice as a shadow fell over them. Kira Leigh stood next to them in the sand, Andrew behind her in a wide-brimmed hat. She grinned and looked down at Dean. “You feeling better?”
. Was he expecting this to become a regular occurence? Where did they go from here? Did Cas, still not up to speed on all social cues, just not know what to do when Dean invited him to lay down, and joined him out of some remnant sense of obligation? Should Dean just get up now and go to breakfast and pray that Cas never brought this up?
“I have to go grab something,” he said suddenly. “I’ll meet you in our cabin, okay?”
“Whiskey, neat, please. And whatever she wants.”
Now it was Cas’ turn. The dealer gave him a king of spades and a two of hearts.
“Uh,” Dean said, her address shaking him from watching the rowdy group. “Nothing right now, thanks.”
Dean looked up, a wry smile on his face. “It’s just weird, you know, not expecting a monster around every corner.”
He began to swim to the edge of the pool nearest them when something else caught his eye. Laid out on a reclining pool chair with a paperback book was Cas, nearly unrecognizable in short blue swim trunks Dean had packed. The size was unintentional (they were the only pair Dean could dig up in the bunker that didn’t seem to belong to him or Sam), but they were doing Cas plenty of favors as the fabric gripped his thighs. Under the layers, Dean had always imagined Castiel as rather slender, pale, the Holy Tax Accountant. He found it hard not to stare once he realized that wasn’t the case. Cas was...fit. How was he tan when his legs never saw the sun?
When their bodies joined together it was unlike anything Dean had felt before. Sex was probably something the average angel did not do, so it was hard to know if they were always like this, their grace filling every inch of their bodies and entering yours as well. Though Dean had never been with a man before, he hadn’t imagined it would feel so pure. Castiel’s fingers dug into Dean’s hips as he held eye contact. His unblinking stare would have been unsettling coming from anyone else, but Cas had always been special, hadn’t he?
Cas ignored him, gripping him by the arm and rotating him away. Dean tensed up as Cas’ lotioned hands gently rubbed into his shoulders, taking his time on what should have been a perfunctory task.
The next thing he felt were hands on his face, an overwhelming fire on his skin as his body was filled with a wave of light.
Cas looked up. “Oh, no, not exactly. I’ve been listening to people while they pray here.”
“I suppose we did. The questions weren’t particularly difficult.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “Good for vampires, bad for Winchesters.”
The last day of autumn was a mild one as they made the trek from Lebanon to the coast, even allowing for lowered windows as the air around them took on a salty breeze. Cas had remained silent for much of the drive, but had a lightness about him, casting frequent glances to Dean and smiling as the driver’s seat became the stage for a one-man karaoke show.
Dean looked back, where the people were pouring tequila into the dip in a different girl’s clavicle. He smiled, but waved them off. He was getting too old for those kinds of games.
Was he still at the machines? Or had he wandered off, observing other people and exploring every little facet of the ship? For all Dean knew, Cas could be in its belly, studying the machinery that was piloting it, marveling at the fruits of human ingenuity.
Dean didn’t bother protesting, Cas was almost certainly right. It was hard to like your odds when you were up against God himself.
He hadn’t been thinking at all. No, this wreck in progress had been steered by feelings alone, those damned, senseless things.
“Fine,” he said, a little too quickly. Kira Leigh raised her eyebrows at him. “I’m glad to be on land for a few hours, though. I was starting to get cabin fever and imagine us going down like the
Cas leaned in, and Dean felt his skin prickle despite the water’s warmth. “I’ve got the angel blade in my coat, just in case.”
If there was one thing he’d never known Cas to be, it was nervous. He’d come off the factory line without the need or capacity to show worry or embarrassment. But the anxious movements of the angel’s hands, the way his eyes darted around the room between sidelong glances at Dean, seemed to suggest exactly that.
“I can work with that,” Dean said, clapping Cas on the shoulder, then letting his arm rest there. “But this could be a disaster.”
“Remember that cruise we told you about, Cas?” Sam said, a smug grin on his face as Dean's protest died on arrival. “Well, after what happened last night, I can’t really go. So Dean has an extra ticket. You interested?”
Dean moved to pull the covers down on that side, a bit too quickly to pass off as nonchalant, but he tried to salvage it with a shrug and “Be my guest.”
“Oh my god, slow down!”
When they were face to face again, Cas helped Dean wrap his legs around his waist. Dean raised his hand to touch him, only to have it linked with Cas’ own, then pressed into the pillow above his head as Cas leaned down, staring with a new level of intensity before kissing down Dean’s neck and onto his chest. His other hand reached down to stroke Dean, who immediately let out an undignified whimper as he clutched their intertwined fingers tighter.
“Apologies,” Cas mumbled. Dean waved him off, putting on a big smile for the others at the table.
“No. But I am sorry for messing up the hunt and getting wounded in the first place. You would have had a lot easier time ambushing the Wendigo if it hadn’t gotten lured me to it.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Yeah, I got that part. I meant-” Cas’ gentle smile turned into a barely-contained smirk, and it was contagious as Dean realized he’d been the butt of a joke. “Did you really just-?”
“Forget I said anything, it doesn’t matter.”
He slid into bed slowly, trying not to move the mattress too much. His body was rigid with nerves as he laid still, flat on his back. Dean scooted closer, putting an arm around Cas’ midsection as if he were a replacement for the pillow he’d been snuggled into before. They were practically sharing a pillow as Cas felt Dean’s breath on his neck, evening out into slow, soft snores as he fell back asleep. With Dean here, wrapped around him, it was difficult to even remember the paralyzing fear from only minutes before. Castiel shut his eyes and relaxed his body. He could finally rest.
“For today. Did you have anything else you wanted to do?”
Cas took a long pause before responding, and Dean wished more than anything that he could decipher what conflict lived within it.
They move away from the room and into the living room so they can talk. “I thought he was never gonna go in there, not gonna lie.” Dean admits, rubbing the back of his neck.
Dean nods “course it is.”
“We do?”
I slide back down under the covers and pull Cas into my arms.
.” Dean continues looking up at him. “It’s suicide.”
Dean pushes the door to as quietly as he can. “Listen, uh, we could really use some time alone today.”
She hissed at him.
Sam lifts the angel’s back up so he can sit up. My brother stays behind Cas to hold him upright while I crash into him, wrapping my arms around him so tight, he probably can’t breathe properly.
“Yeah, Gabe thought that too. It’s cool though, I’m just gonna walk over and get him so he can hang out here for a while.”
But there are no more chances after this. I know that once I leave this room, I will return to my life and you, still, will not be a part of it.”
He felt an unfamiliar feeling drift through him at that. It wasn’t one he felt often but maybe it was hope. He had hope.
I did, but…I was just…I…well…you’re right, there was no reason why I should have treated you the way I did. And now I’m on my deathbed and I’m hearing everything I should have heard all those years ago. I…I never even
“Okay.” Dean nods. “So what do I do?”
Dean exchanges a confused look with Gabe.
Gabe sighs. It kind of is his fault. He shouldn’t have let them go to the back in the first place.
“There’s a reason they treat me like that, Dean.” Cas begins and his stone throwing skill falters when the next one he tosses lands far away from the target.
. Life and death. Happiness and sadness. Clean and dirty. All at the same time. But god knows he’d spend every day here if it meant he could be here with Cas.
Cas’ eyes slit open tiredly and focus on Dean. “Is- is it time?” Cas mumbles groggily.
The circle of people all cheer at Alfie at the difficult question. Even Cas is smirking, waiting for an answer.
Dean gasped, tugging Cas’ hair in two handfuls as Cas moved up and down quickly, teasing the head with his tongue before moving down again.
My heart is hammering in my chest and I can’t stop the images from my dream crossing my mind.
“I-I don’t-but-does it hurt?”
“Might be something to consider.” Dean shrugs. “How about we talk about it when you’re feeling better?”
injury “…just, because of the head injury and all…” He starts, gesturing to his head again “where exactly…is my room?”
Cas makes a small noise and opens his eyes in confusion. Dean smiles down at him. “Go back to sleep and enjoy the ride.” He whispers. A tiny smile pulls across Cas’ lips before his eyes close again and he goes back to sleep, limp in Dean’s arms.
“I won’t do it again, daddy. I won’t.” Jimmy looks up at him.
“Yeah, I got him. Thanks Gabe.”
, Dean. What is your problem?! It’s clear he’s got something going on but you don’t damn
“Because we have experience with hunting the supernatural and fighting Lucifer. This is the most experienced Sector. The other Sectors have people of varying levels of fighting capability and other valuable skills, such as first aid.” Cas adds, a second later. “You have to wear the overalls, Dean.”
“So, shall we set off home tomorrow?” Sam asks, unlocking his phone.
I throw Sam the keys and he slams our door closed before getting into the driver’s seat. Cas’ head is resting on my chest and I run my fingers through his hair when we set off.
“He’s desperate for this war to end. I have a feeling it’s because he wants to save you. Us as well, but he
He hears Dean walking across the wooden floor and then a sympathetic sigh. Cas looks over his shoulder, seeing Dean standing behind him with Jimmy still asleep in his arms.
One of my hands shoots down to grip my crotch in a pathetic effort to keep my bladder from spilling. I glance to my right In hope of seeing Dean, but he isn’t there. Panicking further and shaking wildly, I press my thighs tightly together, trying to stop my bladder from releasing. If I have an accident now, Dean will never forgive me. I can’t help it, why am I so desperate? Dean is going to hate me. What do I do? I can’t move my injured leg either. I’m so desperate, what if I can’t hold it?!
Also, oh my Chuck!
Still, Dean chooses not to comment on it. “Nothing.” He rolls his eyes. At least the old Cas is definitely still in there somewhere. Most of Dean’s other jokes are still swooping right over his head.
Dean frowns. “What could you possibly be sorry for?”
“Is this because you know we’re together now?” I groan at him.
Cas hasn’t eaten properly for days, maybe a week or two. He’s not sleeping well, he’s throwing up, he’s got no energy. It’s bad.
or whatever.
have awesome dreams sometimes. But anyway, back to business. Are you gonna try touching yourself, Cas? It might actually help relieve some of your tension that’s been building up for the last few days. Of course, in no way do you have to. It's up to you."
He looks over at their table and sees Dean smiling over at him, waving. The food has come since he took Jimmy to the bathroom.
“No way, that’s worse.” I roll my eyes, “mind you, at least you didn’t go into detail. I probably would have punched you if you suggested we call ourselves Damigo, Samigo and Camigo.”
and carry on being the beautiful, loving man he is now. It’s something for Cas to look at when he feels down, and he can always feel comforted that Dean will love him no matter what.
they think he might be. Even so, Dean still ends up with holy water dripping down his face just to make sure he isn’t a demon either. Dean shoots him annoyed look, but still says nothing to aggravate him.
Dean smiles back and rolls his eyes again with a shake of his head. “Here.” He holds his arms out for Cas to lean against him while they watch Alfie come to a crushing defeat. Quite literally – he crumbles two seconds before Anna who laughs and raises her fists in victory.
Jody laughs before saying “meet you back at home boys” when we reach their car.
“I mean it.” Cas interrupts another apology. “It happens. I don’t blame you for it.”
Once me and Cas reach our door (which is a couple of doors away from Sam’s), we stop and decide to make plans.
“I know.” Cas says with a trusting smile, starting to shift out of the booth. “I’ll go get him now so we can ask him if he wants to go.”
“Nah, I’ve warmed up now.” Jody claims and the girls nod to agree with her.
“Hi.” Cas gives a small smile. He’s still tired, but he wanted to come and get Jimmy.
I used to find his extended gazes unnerving, but it’s just such a
“I don’t know if I like it or not.”
“No, no, not that bit Cas. Remember when you woke up last night and I told you you’re safe? Well, you are, dude. Nothing’s going to happen to you.”
“Why?” He asks, “you didn’t know I’d keep falling over and getting wet from the ice.”
if things get too much?” He huffs a little laugh.
game. The questions have progressively got harder and…
Castiel’s eyes fill with tears which Dean has never seen before in his entire time knowing Cas.
“Yeah?” Dean smiles and slides down to lie on his pillow. Cas does the same.
relaxed after having such an up and down day worrying about Cas.
A random alarm sounds throughout the building and he looks at Cas straight away for guidance, but again, Cas is not fazed by what seems like another protocol. It’s like he’s heard that alarm thousands of times.
“Cas thought maybe Chuck be proud because he’d figured something out about himself, but nah. Dad didn’t care and shut him out even more. I used to scream at him to admit why he didn’t like Cas, but he never budged, the ignorant son of a bitch. So Cas gave up after that. Mom knew it upset him and she always gave him as much love as she could, but it still left a pretty deep scar on him - trust issues and all. That’s why he was so upset with Meg when she spiked his drink, but I tell you, since he’s had Jimmy, I can tell that the broken piece inside him is healing.”
I don’t hesitate at all and get into the Impala, slamming the door, jamming the keys into the slot and starting the ignition. Sam only just climbs inside in time before speed I off down the road, looking out for any old buildings. I know I saw an old corporate building that fits Sam’s description. We drove past it on the way in a couple of days ago.
His finger slipped in easily causing Dean to frown. “You’re not as tight as last time.”
Did he say loved? Oops. Oh well. Can’t deny the truth, right?
It only takes him a few seconds to figure out my situation, “you’re sleeping in that gas-n-sip aren’t you.”
“No, that’s not right, we put Lucifer back in his cage. Well, we thought we did, anyway. Turns out Crowley had him stashed away in hell somewhere. But still, our world’s stable at the minute.” He rambles.
“Do you want me to finish it for you?”
Cas swats Dean playfully a third time today. Dean doesn’t mind.
Dean kissed him again. “You still ready?”
“How long have you known that?”
“Yeah.” Dean confirms with a small nod. He can’t tell whether Cas is just tired or he’s still sick. He seems a little confused. “Cas, are you feeling okay?”
“Thank you.” Cas smiles at the barista, accepting a fruit tea for himself and a coffee for Dean. He walks over to where Dean and Jimmy are waiting for him. They’re looking in the window of a toy store, pointing at things through the glass.
compared to the soft, wet slide of Cas’ lips against his own. He still tastes sweet from when they ate breakfast and Dean can’t get enough of it.
He turned to see a sleepy looking truck driver approaching.
. I’m not bringing it up because yet again, that kind of seems like a sensitive subject for him. I
Dean smiled, circling his arm around a very sleepy Cas.
He continued to look at her with sad, defeated eyes. He didn’t say anything, and he watched as she started to break. She’d realised how she made him feel, somehow because of what Dean said. Realised that she was in the wrong. Cas wasn’t sure whether he should believe it.
. It wouldn’t sit right with Cas. Hannah had her chance to be involved in Jimmy’s life and chose her career over it. While they ended things as friends, they were never supposed to see each other again.
“I-…” Cas starts, trying to swallow down the lump in his throat before continuing. “I promise I’m trying to be okay. I promise.” He says, finally wiping a couple of tears away. “I’m so sorry that you have to keep picking me up; that I keep falling apart and you
He nods to them before walking down the corridor towards Naomi’s room.
“Cute.” Jo smiled cheesily.
I slip my hands down into his pants and his boxers straight away before gently taking hold of Cas’ half hard dick. I stroke it a few times to get it fully stiff and pump my fist earnestly until I hear the angel whimpering my name. The precome that's already there is providing a good lunricant so at least we down't have to worry about that. He’s very sensitive. Mind you, I’m not surprised. He himself has probably only had sex once with April and had one hand job with me. Additionally, I don’t think Jimmy was the type of guy to drop his pants at any given time. He was very religious so I doubt he had sex before he got married, but then he had Claire. I wouldn’t be surprised if that was the only time he ever got it up. So yeah, Cas is going to be
Cas nods, feeling Dean’s hand next to his under the table. He locks their fingers together. “I will.”
“We don’t have to if you don’t want to.”
“Leave him alone.” Dean shakes his head. He looks at the enemies charging towards them and sighs in resignation. “We need to fight. Me, Nichols and Jarah protect Cas, you guys keep them away from us best you can while we get to the middle. Sound good?” He suggests urgently.
“And that is?”
“We’re gonna go one step at a time.” Anna says. “You just look at me, okay Cas? Don’t look anywhere else.”
“Shift over.” He smiles at Cas who makes room for him on the couch. He sits down. “Did
She laughs through a breath.
“And to stop throwing up all the food into the toilet.” Jimmy adds. Dean snorts.
I toss Sam the keys to the Impala before climbing into the back of the car with Cas. I sit down on the seats horizontally and lay Cas down on his back on top of me. He’s still breathing which is the main thing.
He realised Dean’s hand was on his forehead again.
He considers getting Gabe’s attention first, but he can’t wait. The second he sees where the nearest bathroom is, he makes a mad dash for it and hopes Gabe realizes that Cas isn’t with him before he gets the bags.
“Sounds good.” Gabe nods. “I don’t mind being on kid duty. Are you guys coming?” He looks over at him and Cas.
“Cool, huh?” Dean asks Jimmy whose eyes are sparkling, looking up at the lights. He nods.
Everyone is awake basically.
He glances inside the ambulance, getting one last look of Cas before Paula smiles reassuringly and closes the doors and the ambulance takes off down the street, sirens blaring.
with his three-year-old son to get away from that lie.
“Hello?” He says through a mouthful of food.
“You don’t hurt him! You don’t lay a finger on him!” With a hot burn of rage bubbling up inside him, Dean drags Roan back as hard as he can – so far that he loses grip on the other man’s clothes and he goes tumbling backwards.
He nods. “Yeah, uh, my phone’s in my coat pocket.” Anna reaches over to get the phone since he has no free hands. “Password’s Cas’ birthday.” He adds.
better now Cas is with them and happy. It all feels like things are going back to normal even though there’s only been three days where there’s been upset and craziness. It feels like it’s been an age, but at least Cas is home and well. That’s what truly matters.
“Sam, his grace!” I shout and my brother kneels down next to me and lifts Cas’ head while I unscrew the cap on the tube.
“That?
“I’m gonna go grab some dessert before they put it away in the fridge.” Gabe decides before walking away with the usual spring in his step.
“Yeah.” Sam opens the door to go back inside. “I’ll be there in a minute.”
“Everything. I’m sorry I took everything out on you for what happened to my parents. You didn’t deserve the rough time I was giving you at all. I know you were just trying to help. I didn’t listen to you, but you carried on helping me anyway, even when I took your wallet.” She laughs, but her words are serious.
Jody shakes her head, smiling “at least we actually caught something that day. There were other people there and they got nothing, but us? Nah. We were constantly pulling 'em in.”
The problem is, I’m getting the vibes that Cas struggles with this area of the human thing. He didn’t get it before and he still doesn’t. Look at it like a small child learning how to control their bladder. Cas is having the same problem. It’s just that he still doesn’t completely understand when to go and when not to go, despite being human before. It’s either that, or he’s just too embarrassed to say anything because then everyone will know he needs me to help him go. I’m going to have to monitor this because I’m pretty sure, right now, if I didn’t notice, Cas would’ve had an accident. He’s really desperate for the bathroom right now, and he doesn’t know what his limits are, and I have every idea that he probably doesn’t want to find out.
“The enemy?” She clarifies like he should know this and it’s the most obvious thing in the world.
Cas. You…this isn’t
“Have you ever tried kayaking?” Dean asked.
They met in the middle of the people-less courtyard, hugging each other before sharing a quick kiss. Cas managed to keep hold of his textbooks.
“Sorted?” Dean asks from where he’s sitting on their bed. Cas nods, lowering Jimmy into Dean’s arms.
After grabbing another towel, I run it through Castiel’s hair a little to dry it off just so it’s not dripping wet.
Cas lifts his head and looks at right at me. The sparkle that has been in his eyes for the past few days is gone. All that is left is a dull blue full of hurt and pain. I shake my head at him subtly to say something along the lines of
He licked his lips, considering whether drinking so early was a good idea. “Tell you what. Send a couple of shots to them, on me.” He put a bill on the bar, gesturing to the others. She took it, and pulled a tequila bottle and shot glasses to walk their way. Dean scooted back from the bar, and was a few steps away when a voice called out.
“We had a— a fight. I guess.”
“As long as you’re back before 3.”
Ducking around poles and the occassional person, they ended up in an internal stairwell, its white-painted cement beginning to chip on the edges. The chirping was loud and echoing here, and Cas made short work of finding a tiny bird, nestled on a ridge in the corner. It recoiled when their faces appeared, but didn’t fly away. One of its wings stuck out at an odd angle, unable to return flush to its side.
“Is this the lucky guy?” he asked.
“Yeah,” the man who must be Jeff answered. “It’s kinda like that old game show, The Newlywed Game? But sudden death style. A bunch of couples start out, answering questions about each other. When you get a question wrong, you’re dropped from the game. Last couple standing wins.”
“Didn’t you want to change?”
The woman looked up at him, stone-faced, then gestured vaguely to Dean’s right before continuing her route.
“Hi!” chirped a staff member who was wearing an outfit that wouldn’t be out of place in a Village People performance. “I’m Eric, and I’m in charge of this game! I just need your names written here, and you need to decide which of you will write answers about themselves, and which of you will try to verbally match afterward.”
He settled at a table in the corner, looking through the large windows over the water. The water was choppy, with sunlight glinting off of every cresting wave. He’d barely begun his first mouthful of breakfast when a shadow fell over his table.
Cas scooted himself up gingerly, as if he was afraid to disturb a sleeping partner. When he was finally settled, Dean could feel the warmth from his body join his own under the covers. A quick glance at Cas, so close, next to him in bed, left him lightheaded. He’d had
“Close your eyes, buddy,” he said softly. Cas obeyed, and Dean pulled the black cloth around his face. “Is that too tight?”
An older man and woman were looking at him with something close to terror. The man took a tiny step forward before speaking in a shaking voice. “You were out pretty far. We were riding our jet ski and… we tried to swerve, but we didn’t have enough time. We hit you.”
“That’s a lot of blood— someone help—”
“Cas,” Dean breathed, still fretful and twitching. He felt arms encircle him, hold him close until his heart began to calm.
She laid a towel out a few feet away from her partner and peeled off her shirt, then eased herself onto her stomach. Dean, who hadn’t had the forethought to bring a towel, kicked off his sandals and sat beside her, knowing he’d probably regret it later when sand had found its way into holes he didn’t know he had.
Once dinner ended, they found themselves walking along the ship’s promenade deck, letting the cool night air dance around them. Dean stopped, looking out at the setting sun on the water’s horizon, reds and yellows reflecting and melting into the deep blue.
Cas smiled at him. “I can’t guarantee that some terrible thing won’t happen to us down the road.”
The dealer turned to Dean, and he realized he hadn’t even looked at his cards. He gave a quick scan of them— a ten of clubs and a two of diamonds. He made sure Cas was watching, trying to gesture toward the numbers and hoped Cas understood, because Dean was suddenly terrified at leaning in to whisper to him again.
“Good afternoon everyone!” boomed a voice over the speaker. Dean looked up to see a man walk onto the stage in a shiny purple tuxedo, one of the more horrifying things Dean had seen in his considerably distressing life. His makeup-caked face seemed glued in place. There was no way a gig hosting game shows on a cruise ship warranted that.
Dean took a deep breath, then slowly nodded. “Sure. That could work.”
He rose out of the water, his swimsuit clinging to him in ways Dean wasn’t prepared to have inches from his face. Dean had to carefully arrange his own suit as he made to follow, while Cas was already grabbing his coat and seeking out the source of the sound.
Dean jumped. “What have I said about sneaking up like that?”
Cas’ face lit up, giving Dean a not-unfamiliar swooping feeling in his stomach.  People flirted with Cas even more often than they did with Dean, but he never reacted with more than an eyeroll. At least, until now.
“Of what?”
Castiel looked confused for a moment before a little smirk of recognition crossed his face, as he remembered the discomfort Dean had once felt at being close like this. Well, not like
Dean choked on air as he thrashed, the nightmare an unrelenting reel of some of the worst moments of his life.
She raised her hands in surrender. “If I’m wrong, tell me to fuck off.”
So few people had ever been so tender, so direct with Dean, that he had to fight the threat of tears rising in his eyes. All his scars, inside and out, didn’t seem to matter when Cas looked at him. How had he ever thought otherwise?
Cas. You pushed me away, remember?”
Back in their cabin, Cas eased Dean onto the bed. “I can go find some food for you. Just stay in and relax.”
Dean stood aside and beckoned him inside. “What’s up?”
“Perhaps we should just take the photo, then he’ll leave us alone,” Cas murmured.
“Fine!” he snapped, stomping toward the water without another word.
“What did you have in mind?”
Castiel’s face fell, his eyes leaving Dean for the first time since they’d opened. “Oh,” he said softly. “Well, for what it’s worth, I’m not.”
Dean looked at Cas and shrugged. “Sure, why not?”
He immediately craved more contact, but Dean knew better than to reach out. If their skin met again, lingered for even a moment too long, there was no telling what he would do. It was hard enough to resist Cas’ pull before, a beautiful ethereal being in their corner, all bright eyes and fierce determination. As time went on, he’d learned to see Cas as more man than angel, which had the curious effect of making him more important to Dean than ever.
“Come with me.” Cas grabbed Dean’s hand and pulled him from the chair before dropping it quickly, as if Dean’s skin was searing hot.
Dean sighed. “It’s just a Christmas party, Cas. Come on, let’s get out of—”
The trouble with cruise ships was, with so much to do on board at all hours of the night, the television offerings were very sparse. After watching an unspeakably long infomercial for a stain remover, Dean gave up and clicked the power button on the remote.
,” Cas admonished. He reached under his chair and tossed a small bottle to Dean. “Put this on.”
“It meant something.” His breath hitched as he chanced a look downward, where Cas had his top teeth hooked around his lips in a bite. Dean exhaled, letting go of his last scrap of dignity. “It means...everything.”
Once they made their way to their cabin door and inside, Cas claimed the chair in the corner while Dean settled on the edge of the bed.
“Oh, uh, yeah. Bad dreams,” Dean said. “Sorry about that.”
Cas shook his head. “Nothing to be sorry about.”
Cas’ nose wrinkled and his lips grew thin.
He’d chosen to sit next to Cas, but not staring at him all night would prove especially challenging if he couldn’t stop remembering the tickle of stubble under his lips. Dean cast his gaze around the casino, looking anywhere else.
“Are you kidding me?” Dean scoffed. “Your powers of observation are like a superpower.”
A man had ambushed them, tugging Cas toward a starry backdrop set up against a nearby wall. A camera stood in front of it, ready to capture manufactured memories.
“Cas, I’m not hungry.”
Dean always entered every giveaway he saw. Even for stuff he didn’t want. A fake name and his phone number in a jar by the cash register, an online entry form, it didn’t matter. He liked the gamble, the possibility, even if the best thing he’d ever gotten was a set of kitchen knives, some of which had been repurposed into hunting weapons. Which is how he found himself here, begging his brother to be his plus-one on a holiday cruise that seemed too good to be true.
Dean approached the table, then clapped Cas on the shoulder. “Dude, you’re missing out! Check it out, I got lei’d!”
“Hey, Cas.”
“You love,” Cas continued, his leg brushing Dean’s. “Wholly and completely. More than anyone I know.”
Dean shrugged. “That’ll work.”
“That’s okay, Cas.”
When Dean woke, he was alone. That was becoming a bit of a pattern.
The couples that had seemed so innocent when they’d arrived appeared to be a bit less so upon closer inspection. At the craps table next to them, Dean could see a woman in a short dress nearly in the lap of her partner, whose hand was sneaking slowly into the gap between her slightly spread legs. Dean saw her eyes go wide, her mouth dropping open slightly.  Dean wouldn’t have been surprised to see the hand get swatted away, but instead, she gave the man a sultry look that made even Dean go hot behind the ears.
“What was that?” Cas asked.
He knew a lecture was probably brewing, but followed her onto the beach. They found Andrew, huddled under the large umbrella he’d been carrying.
matter. I don’t mean to the world. I mean to me.”
They sat in silence as he ate, Cas staring out at the water. It didn’t have quite the awkward heaviness of the night before, and maybe even resembled something bordering on their usual comfortable companionship. Dean’s insides still curled tight when he thought about how much he wanted to touch the man across from him, and how he couldn’t, but at least there wasn’t that sharp, raw pain anymore when he looked at Cas. Things were tender now, like skin newly formed over a healing wound. Since having an angel on speed dial, many of Dean’s injuries were healed so quickly that he’d almost forgotten what this felt like.
Cas turned back to him, eyes squinting against the sun. “Is that a proposition or a concern?”
was on, which felt a little on the nose after the day he had, but Dean didn’t have it in him to channel surf for something better. Before long, he found himself entranced by the seduction, the drama, the fighting between absurdly attractive couples. Cas held out for longer, but eventually even he started to predict what the contestants would do next, getting frustrated when they went against his wishes.
“But I do know I’ll never leave you. I’m here, as long as you’ll have me.”
Dean sat back up but could barely speak, only managing a “Yeah,” as he nodded fervently, enraptured by the lines of Cas’ hips leading into his pants. He couldn’t resist diving forward into him, his nose trailing down the sharp lines before he let his tongue dart out and trace them, earning a gravelly moan in response. Dean reached up and undid Cas’ belt, removing it slowly as he stared up into his return gaze. Pants and boxers followed, and there he was, vibrant and beautiful and wholly Cas. Dean’s eyes roamed over his body, firmer and more tan than his own, the curves of Cas’ ass and thighs making his mouth go slack. Certain things about Cas always made Dean’s heart pick up speed. Tonight, he felt it falter, a tiny boat on an uneven sea, with little warning as to what would cause it to pitch and toss next.
Dean looked at him straight-on that time, but couldn’t hold it. Cas had so much heart, and all Dean did was make jokes. It was a miracle Cas even stuck around; even at his best, Dean didn’t deserve him.
Dean woke up in the same embrace that had brought him panic just yesterday. Today, it made him smile. Last night hadn’t been a dream. He turned over, coming face to face with open blue eyes, happy little crinkles at their corners threatening to melt him right then and there.
He rubbed his eyes and massaged his temples, as if he could erase Cas from his thoughts, make this easy again. When he looked up again, the angel had reappeared at Dean’s side, his heroism quota apparently filled for the night.
Cas studied him for a moment before replying. “What happens to you isn’t who you are.”
“We were just headed to the casino,” Andrew spoke up, in a soft Irish lilt.
The question lost a few more teams, some losing out from only one part of the answer being wrong. Dean was mentally preparing himself to rise and exit the stage, but Castiel turned over his card to reveal an eerily detailed and perfectly correct answer: A burger, medium rare, with a beer to drink and pie for dessert.
Dean knew he could do.
“Hey.” Dean reached up and gripped Cas’ arm. “I’m human. Am I frail and useless?”
“Where at? If it’s not one of the islands from ‘Kokomo’, I’m not interested.”
Castiel smiled a little at that.
“I’ll see you later,” Dean said shortly, then took off down the boardwalk before Cas could respond. He knew he was acting childish, but he didn’t have the energy to pretend to be a mature adult at the moment. After putting some distance between them and catching sight of the beach, he risked a glance back to where he’d left Cas. He wasn’t there.
“It’s definitely okay.” Cas leaned in and kissed him, hesitant and soft. “Is
The walk back to their cabin wasn’t terribly pleasant, the ship unsteady under the feet of dozens of passengers being herded along the docks. One unfortunate soul was already leaning over the balcony, the motion causing seasickness to get the better of him as his partner patted his back.
Dean reached up to untie the blindfold at the same moment Cas himself did; the resulting brush of their fingers should not have sent a jolt up his arm, and yet. Dean dropped his hand and let Castiel finish. The little ruffle of his hair that the blindfold left behind made him look even more adorable, like when you slept in too late and the pillow had had its way with you. Dean took a deep breath; he’d really brought the image on himself of Cas on a pillow, tangled in sheets next to him.
As if in reply, a tone rang out over the speaker system, followed by a charming male voice that echoed around the room as the passengers quieted down.
The worst thing was how he couldn’t tell if Cas was dealing with any of the same conflict; the distress in his gut, the gnawed fingernails, reliving the kiss over and over again. Sometimes Dean caught him staring, only to avert his eyes. But most of the time Cas seemed all too willing to forget what Dean had done, pretend like things were normal. The message was clear: Dean had an out if he wanted it. He just wasn’t sure if he could bear going back to the way things had always been, now that he’d admitted his feelings to himself.
As they brushed their teeth side by side in the tiny cabin bathroom, it was strange to remember just how uncomfortable it felt just days ago, with each of them getting ready behind a closed door. There was really no need for them to cram themselves in at the same time, but Dean felt compelled to stay by Cas’ side that morning, and Cas hadn’t objected.
“How’s your cruise going?” she asked him.
“I love Sam more than anything,” he settled on, “but that’s different. We’re going on middle age and I think I’ll always have the instinct to protect my dumb little brother.”
Cas shut the trunk and slid into the passenger seat, looking at Dean as he shut the door. Dean turned the keys in the ignition then let his hand fall into Cas’ lap, fingers covering his own as they pulled out of the parking lot and into the night.
While the last few days weren't exactly the rest and relaxation Dean hoped for, being on vacation at all still felt strange. Foreign.
Dean looked at Cas and shrugged as he tossed his towel over his shoulder. “Works for me.”
okay?”
“What?” he asked defensively. “Not like you care.”
Cas had reverted to his suit and trenchcoat, and the familiarity reminded Dean of how unusual this trip had been for the two of them. Once they got back to monster hunting, the bunker, and Sam and Jack, they could feasibly get back to normal. The thought was comforting to Dean, even if he wasn’t sure it was true.
. Her small, round sunglasses didn’t hide her expression of intrigue.
“Son, it looked...we thought…”
, not quite. Their lips came together again and again as Cas pushed Dean’s overshirt off, breaking apart to make room to pull his t-shirt over his head. Dean had a moment of thankfulness Cas hadn’t showed up in his full suit, tie and trenchcoat. His fingers shook as he fumbled to unbutton the shirt, only making it to the second button before huffing in frustration. They’d waited long enough.
The next round came and went. “Most prized possession?”
Dean moved in quickly before he could blow their cover. Cas looked down at Dean’s hand, which found itself affectionately placed on his chest. Dean cleared his throat. “Yes, he’s, uh. He’s gorgeous, isn’t he?”
Whatever he wanted to do.
Things felt close to what they’d once been, but the comfort of being with each other came with more ease, more unabashed smiling now. Was this what it was going to be like? Having Cas not as a friend or a brother, but something else yet to be named that took up space in his heart and in his bed. He didn’t feel regret, never that, but fear was creeping back, no longer staved off by waves of ecstasy at finally having him like this by his side. Dean had wanted this for so long, never expecting it to happen, hiding his desire even from himself. Now that they were here, he was a little lost. He’d never planned this far.
Dean thought carefully about how to answer this one. Given the circumstances, neither of them really had, at least not in the way the question intended. But Dean remembered Cas, bleeding out on the ground in that barn, looking at him when he said “I love you,” before looking at Sam and Mom and continuing with “I love all of you.” Dean had wondered, then, at being singled out, but had shoved it down like he did everything that wasn’t easy to address. But now, it was their only chance. He wrote down his answer and turned the card over. Castiel had already done the same.
Castiel lifted his own bag and nodded toward Dean’s luggage. “We should probably find the room first and unload these.”
Dean looked at the scraps left on his plate. “I guess, why?”
“Oh. Uh,” Dean looked down at his linen shirt and shorts. “This is pretty comfortable. I don’t really trust myself not to fall over in the bathroom if I try to swap into something else.” He chuckled. “That would be an embarrassing rescue to need, huh?”
When his brain caught up, Dean kissed him back, tender and hesitant again. They broke apart and Castiel was beaming at him like a fool, filling his chest to bursting. He moved back in and tested the waters, teasing his tongue over Cas’ lips, and when they opened to let him in his world began to spin. He held Cas as their kisses deepened, somewhat to keep himself upright but mostly because he could, he finally fucking
Dean pulled his leg back under the cover and shifted his body to one side of the bed, patting the space next to him. His eyes were closed again, probably already drifting back toward unconsciousness. Castiel could have turned and left there, but the aching pull he felt toward Dean was too great.
“Cas,” he moaned. The name had been on Dean’s lips before, in anger, in affection, even in prayer, but not like this.
Cas’ face broke into a wide grin, bigger than Dean had ever seen on him. It filled Dean with such bright happiness that it was hard to believe Cas didn’t have his grace anymore. Cas scooted closer to him, their noses now only inches apart.
“I’ll be okay. See you later, Cas.”
The next hour was sure to become one of Dean’s happier holiday memories. The meal was perfect, so delicious that he nearly proved Cas wrong. His own plate was nearly empty, and he’d taken several bites from Cas’ as well. He’d had a few glasses of a delicious spiced mead and was beginning to feel the pleasant looseness that came with drinking for fun rather than to numb. Earlier awkwardness forgotten, they spoke and laughed together in earnest for what felt like the first time since he’d kissed Cas. Any casual touches warmed his insides but didn’t cause him distress at needing more. Everything was going so well. Too well, as it turns out. The whole room gave a mighty lurch, and even Dean was caught off guard— he normally couldn't afford the ease that enveloped him that afternoon, but he should have known better than to think it would last.  Drinks went tumbling and chairs were knocked over, causing a great deal of chatter and even a few squeals from the other passengers.
Dean’s face broke the surface of the water as he propelled himself from the bottom of the pool. Other swimmers laughed and splashed around him as he ran his hands over his hair and flung the excess water off. He took a look around at the sunbathers, noting several bikini-clad women with no husbands in sight.
Cas met his eyes with a silent apology and came shuffling back. Dean put a tentative arm around Cas, then pulled him close.
Cas reached up and put his own hand over Dean’s. “I got you.”
“Why is this here?” Dean asked once he’d sat down.
“I’m not sure,” Cas said.
He’d long since left Cas at the slot machines with a pile of quarters, telling him he was welcome to come back to their cabin if he ran out of entertainment. So far, no dice. Dean wondered now if Cas had even heard him; he’d been focused so intently on the spinning symbols, the hokey flashing lights.  Dean wasn’t sure why he was even awake. He should be using this alone time to get some rest. No use waiting up for Cas. Even if he showed, they would only be facing the awkward bed situation again.
“Of the sunset?”
It took most of his willpower to drag himself out of bed and into the shower. As the water soaked his hair, he got small flashes from the night before, like a damn “previously on” montage from the soap opera of his life. The drinking, the affectionate touches, the kiss...Cas pushing him away.
“Sweet!” Kira Leigh said, bubbly to an extent Dean could not fathom matching. “Are you guys married?”
. A fun night, then gone from his bed (or his car, or her couch) by morning. But this? This mattered, and he didn’t want to screw it up.
“You said you’d go with me!”
“We’re in the Caribbean. Leis are customary in the Pacific islands, like Hawaii.”
“Go on,” Cas whispered, with a yearning expression that matched what Dean felt.
“Hey, dude! Wanna take this shot?”
“I’ll bring you something else.”
“I don’t mind it,” Cas said quietly. “Though yours does smell very pleasant too.”
“I’m terrified of losing you again,” he whispered, then let out a breathy laugh. This wasn’t the kind of conversation one tended to have in swim trunks. Apparently sleeping with Cas didn’t make Dean any less of a mess.  “Isn’t that great? I get everything I’ve ever wanted and I’m already bracing myself to lose it.”
“Um. Whatever you want to do, like I said.”
“It’s okay, Dean. I’ve got you.”
“I’ll do the matching,” Cas said, before Dean could consider it. Cas lowered his voice and muttered in Dean’s ear, “I can only imagine most of the questions wouldn’t apply to a—to someone like me.”
“There was an accident,” Cas said, then turned around to look at the other remaining couple.
Cas nodded. “Do you want me to come with you?”
Cas’ brow furrowed, but as that was something of a default expression for him, it didn’t serve as a warning that he was about to turn and ask Dean a question.
When he resurfaced, Dean turned onto his back, floating while small waves lapped at his face. The light breeze danced over the moisture and tickled his skin. The sounds of the crowd on the beach were muted by the water covering his ears, leaving him alone with his thoughts. Again.
“Hope you and your partner enjoy your romantic getaway!”
“Looks like it’s hurt,” Dean whispered.
Cas leaned in closer, deepening contact as he brushed a thumb over Dean’s lower lip.
Silence stretched between them for what felt like an eternity. The alcohol finally weighed on Dean’s eyelids, and he started to fade in and out of consciousness. Eventually Cas sighed and swung his legs out of bed. Dean could hear him rummaging in his luggage in the dark, then crossing to the door.
“Why wouldn’t he—” Dean began. “Oh. Yeah. Don’t worry, a drink is just a drink.”
When they’d dressed (it was so strange how Dean no longer had to limit his moments staring at Castiel; he apparently now had an open invitation to ogle), they made their way to the upper decks for an early swim. They were surprised to see a dock, land, and buildings off the side of the ship, though not the port they’d departed from nearly a week ago.
Dean gnawed at his lip in silence. He got along fine with people, sure, but tried to keep it all surface level, at a distance. They couldn’t afford attachments on a hunter’s salary. Sometimes he slipped up, like with Kevin, or Charlie, or Cas. At best, he always ended up loving more than he could be loved in return. He knew he wasn’t worth the risk that even knowing him brought. But he wasn’t about to open that can of worms.
“I can go- come back later-”
“You’re right, it’s not.”
Dean barely heard him.
“Cas, what do you say we—”
“Is Cas still in there?”
“You asked where I went last night. I went here.” He gestured at the door. “I’ve been coming here most of the time you haven’t seen me, actually.”
Cas leaned back to the edge of the hot tub with a sigh, his toned arms supporting his body as sweat rolled down his neck and onto his chest. Dean found himself grateful for the bubble jets surrounding them as his body responded in kind. There was only so much a man could take.
Dean chuckled. “What do they pray for?”
“Actually, the figure you know as Christ was born—”
Cas stood up. “Is she okay?”
“And watch me all night? I don’t think so.”
Dean let himself go, crying out. Cas moved a few times more with determination, leaning in for a final kiss as he lit Dean up from the inside.
Cas turned then, eyebrows raising slightly in surprise, in contrast to his usual grouchy squint.
“I’m Dean, this is Cas.”
“Okay.” Jimmy agrees and slides off the bed. “Daddy, I got you a present. For papa too.” Jimmy picks up a small box and plops it onto Cas’ stomach.
I follow Sammy down the steps towards the Impala. She’s looking as beautiful as ever. No scratches or faults in the paint or anything. Perfect as pie.
"Something you'll hate." Omandriel sneers.
The nurse smiles and nods before continuing down the corridor like she didn’t just manage to calm him right down. This is right. However shit he feels about giving Naomi a goodbye –
“You’re done soon, right?” Jo asked him and he glanced at his watch.
“Thank you.” Cas whispers as he closes his eyes. “I love her and everything but…I’m so tired and she just kept talking and talking.” He breathes.
Dean sounds happy.
“I’d love to just give him a hug.” Cas sounds kind of sad about it. “I miss being able to play games with him properly.”
“Yeah, I can see that.” I laugh, sitting down next to the angel. It’s so good to see him. “Pass it here a sec.” I say, holding my hand out. He hands me the iPod and I scroll through the songs, laughing and frowning at what he is listening to. “Pink Floyd. You like it?”
Cas blushes at the attention of his co-workers. It’s the first time he’s been back to the office since he got his corporate home job and everyone is pleased to see him. They’re all crowding around, asking questions and fussing over him.
“Did you guys buy these?” Alex asks, peering inside the box.
He buries his nose against Cas again, whispering comfort with a hope that Cas can somehow hear it. “I got you. It’s gonna be okay.” He repeatedly strokes Cas’ hair, holding him close to his chest. He’s feeling a huge wave of protectiveness gushing through him, and he just feels like he has to be as close to Cas as possible to make sure he’s okay. “Don’t you worry about me when you wake up. You just focus on getting better.” He murmurs. Even though Cas is still unconscious, Dean finds comfort in talking to him. He cradles the back of Cas’ head. “You’re gonna be just fine, Cas. It’s okay.”
Castiel’s gaze shifts down. He looks at the carpet, but Dean knows he’s still listening. “Cas, I know how you’re feeling, alright? I’m sorry I didn’t listen to you earlier, but I just wanted you to be okay.”
“To the second more like.” Cas adds which makes Gabe laugh.
Satisfied, Jimmy nods and goes back to resting his head on Cas’ shoulder.
Cas nods and pulls his rod to the right in my direction, nearly hitting me in the face but not quite thankfully.
as they called it, but Dean had trained him up and Cas had picked it up so quickly he was the best barista they had there within two months.

just busy, yeah?”
“They do the tea.” Dean slumps down next to him, arm going across his shoulders immediately. “I got the one you like. Lemon and honey?”
“Sorry.” He says again. Even though Dean seems okay, Cas feels an incredible guilt because he’s breaking down again, and Dean has to deal with it.
“Yes, and all those times mom was busy at work so we had to go pick him up from elementary and take him home.” Michael adds.
Cas squeezes his hand weakly. Dean takes it as his reply. He cups Cas’ face.
“Hold your hands out.” He instructs and I wonder why, but do it anyway.
“It’s nothing serious or anything, I just thought…since I’m here…I’d like to meet him.” Hannah says, voice raised in question. “After all, he’s my son-”
his lips. It sends shivers up and down my spine as I focus on his equally hot breath burning into my skin.
They wait a moment or two, Dean gripping Cas’ arm tightly just in case he falls. “I’m okay.” He confirms. “Maybe it won’t happen anymore. It hasn’t done it for a good week and a half now.”
“What’s happening?” I ask, not being able to think of anything else to say.
He’s…he’s hard. And he was rubbing against Dean’s thigh while he was asleep. No wonder he felt so good in his dream.
“What?”
“Yeah. I’ll have some energy left in me to cook us something nice later.” Dean decided, looking at Cas. “Where do you wanna go for some food?”
"I'm fine." I claim, continuing to try and get my belt out of all the annoying loops.
He can’t see the look on Gabe’s face because of his tear-blurred vision, but he feels Gabe move into his space and envelope him in a big hug. The atmosphere feels calmer than before, and they both remain silent for what feels like a few minutes until Cas is able to collect himself.
“It's alright. We're in no rush, just take your time with this. We can stay here as long as you want. I know you really need to go, but take as much time as you need. It's just you and me in here, there's nothing to worry about. It'll be okay, just try and relax for me.”
“Come on, buddy.” He lifts Jimmy into his arms and takes him to get him into bed. It doesn’t take long to get his teeth brushed and his pajamas on, and soon Jimmy is tucked up in his blankets fast asleep.
After a while, Sam knocks on our door and Dean goes over to the door and opens it.
Cas would have smiled if he wasn’t vomiting again.
“Yeah.”
peaceful. I want him back.
He immediately relaxes in my lap and wraps his arms around my neck, seeming glad that he’s finally sitting down.

. It feels like something has been ripped away from him now all of the stimulation making him feel good is gone.
“Thanks for remembering that.” Cas sighs, shifting uncomfortably. “Please stop talking about it.”
