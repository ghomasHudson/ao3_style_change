“I am sick and tired of your-“John was cut off his very important accusation as Sherlock swiftly jumped forward and grabbed his face. His palms were cool and were a welcome relief to John’s flushed skin.
John sips his tea and continues to read the paper, effortlessly ignoring the silent conversation happening in front of him.
Teddy had smiled again in incredulity and looked at John a bit pointedly before turning his eyes almost immediately back on Sherlock. He had chuckled lowly again shaking his head a bit.
The three of them end up standing side-by-side on the pavement, looking up at an old decrepit manor house. John can recognise that it would have undoubtedly been a handsome building back in the day, but age and neglect gives it a sagging, discoloured look. The boarded up windows rounds the whole miserable sight up with a bow.
John slows his hand as Sherlock’s cock spurts another small rope and gentles his hold when the man twitches with oversensitivity.
John licks his lips, watching with a thrill as Sherlock’s eyes dilate and he sucks in a little breath before moving back, a hint of a flush high on his cheekbones.
“Uncle Rudy, let us not delve into your dramatics this evening,” comes a low, exasperated voice from the door.
Sherlock stirs, his face rolling into John’s shirt for a moment, John feels his hot breath penetrate the material before he sighs in his sleep and turns his head back to the side and settles, still, once more.
John gapes at them, eyes unfocused. A thought occurs to him. It’s impossible. Utterly absurd. Asks anyway, in a whisper, “What year is it?”
Once in his room, he changes slowly into his pajamas, thinking he would really like to take a shower but decides to hold off until the morning. He would rather keep Sherlock supervised for as long as possible.
Sherlock rolls over onto his back, giggling breathlessly and John rolls his eyes, a smile tugging at his lips as he runs a hand over Sherlock’s skull for a quick assessment.
The first thing John sees entering the living room is Sherlock sitting, surprisingly, in John’s chair. Dressed impeccably, back ramrod straight, face cut from stone. Knuckles white as he brings a mug of tea to his lips.
John’s room is grand and airy, decorated in pastel blues and dark woods. It’s immaculately clean and not for the first time, John had wondered if they had a housekeeper or servants, but he hadn’t met anyone along the way. An old wooden door sitting adjacent to the wardrobe leads to a small ensuite fitted with a shower, much to John’s delight.
John looks up at the ceiling for a second. “That I should keep my distance, something about you being a ‘bad egg’.”
“Hm,” Mycroft nods once, one side of his mouth quirking upwards for a second. “I place my trust at your door then, Doctor.”
“John hit his head about a week ago, bless him, and it caused a bout of amnesia. He’s staying with us over the summer before heading back to university in London. Our Sherlock has been looking after him while he finds his feet,” Mr Holmes supplies, casting a fond look over to his son and John.
“I...don’t have it with me.” The young man replies slowly. When John simply stares at him he elaborates, “I mean, it’s connected to the wall..in my house?” He poses it like a question, looking a bit lost.
After a minute, Sherlock’s eyes dart quickly down John’s body, resting for a fraction of a second on his crotch, on the bulging evidence of his desire. Sherlock’s eyes have darkened considerably when they flick back up to John’s face and John can’t help a little pant from escaping his mouth.
Sherlock was turning back to John now. “He lost his parents in a crowd and didn’t know where to go.”
“Wha-where-what?” John babbles, eyes flickering to left then right. He’s in a park. A young woman of a similar age is standing behind the man, biting her lip and alternating between staring at John and the man to his left.
." Sherlock looked (and sounded) like a big moody teenager with his face pressed deep into the collar of his coat, even managing to somehow shove his hands into the pockets considering he was carrying a plastic bag in each. They dangled awkwardly from his exposed wrists, digging into the sensitive flesh and looking terribly uncomfortable.
Sherlock shrugged, eyes still closed. “I told Lestrade what I knew once he had stopped his caterwauling. He can sort it out.”
No, he didn’t want to play pirates! Why would he want to play pirates with anyone other than Victor? This boy, this
John’s eyes snap open. “Wha-?” Above him is a cloudless sky, the blue drowning him. It’s partly hiding behind green and John blinks to focus. Leaves. He’s lying under a tree.
The time in the well, that fear of death had hit him harder than ever before. Harder than any other mad situation he found himself in. Harder than when he was laying in hot sand with a bullet in his shoulder. The fear of a father leaving behind an orphan. The fear of Sherlock being killed by the suppressed trauma of his past.
John leans heavily on the counter behind him, breathing hard and fiercely trying not to feel guilty for snapping at his friend. After all, it's not Sherlock’s fault Rachel broke it off. It's not Sherlock’s fault she found her 'soulmate' who happened to be a young artist called Jed and who most definitely
by any means, but he’s somewhat given up trying to to intimidate John and purposely keep him out of the loop.
Sherlock’s lips twitch marginally and he replies in a superior tone, “The world is in my orbit, John.”
“Unfortunately,” Sherlock mutters. He jerks suddenly and John has to fight not to grin as Sherlock scowls across at his father who seems to have kicked him under the table.
reminded John of his own late grandmother. So once Sherlock grabbed her thin shoulders and proceeded to yell into her stricken, tear streaked face, John had lost it. He had marched towards Sherlock, grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and proceeded to forcibly drag him away while the man himself spluttered in indignation. As they passed Lestrade, the silver haired man had muttered; "Not on Sherlock. Keep a tighter leash on him will you John? Maybe a muzzle too."
Sherlock waves this off, “Which time?” John is fairly certain ‘that awful flu’ situation only happened the once while living with Sherlock but he decides not to comment.
Somewhere during the night, both boys had kicked off their jeans, leaving their legs bare and free. John can’t remember when they fell asleep.
It starts off soft and achingly sweet, Sherlock hesitant from John’s momentary pause, but once John licks at the seam of his mouth Sherlock tightens his hold and then the desperation is back.
John grins at him, blinks when Sherlock bends his right knee up towards his groin and points it to the side in a right angle, grabs the heel of his foot and then straightens his leg upright high above his head.
John snaps his eyes open, scrambles his hands back onto Sherlock’s face from where they had dropped to the floor moments before.
This chapter killed me, I'm still not 100% satisfied with it but I had to upload it before I just went and deleted the whole damn thing.
“Sherlock..” John tries to tug his head away, an impossible feat when those long fingers tighten brutally.
"About an hour ago, Sherlock explained you were at work. Then he said he needed a second opinion on something and... voilà." Teddy gestures at the mess Sherlock is half-heartedly trying to clean up with a tea towel in one hand, while the other is texting rapidly on his phone.
“If you like,” Sherlock shrugs again indifferently, making John wonder if actually, Sherlock doesn’t know who the singer is at all but rather that enough people have pointed out the similarity for him to remember the name.
“Thank you,” John says sincerely. Looks back at the auburn haired boy again. “Sorry, what did you say your name was?”
The pile consists of a clean pair of pants and socks, thank god, a white t-shirt that must be Sherlock’s because it’s a little tight, and a pair of jeans. He has no idea who they belong to, as they fit John almost perfectly. John carries his dirty clothes back out into the room with him and dumps them on his pillow.
“‘Ours’? You live together?” John asks in surprise. Jesus, it hadn't been that long since the two of
Teddy rises and moves towards the brunet, grasping him by the shoulders and giving him a strong embrace. Sherlock pats his back a bit awkwardly in return before Teddy draws back slightly. He mutters something in Sherlock’s ear and the detective smiles slightly, nodding in reply. Then Teddy cups the side of his neck in a gentle hold and kisses his cheek, lips resting on the bruise for a moment before pulling back. John doesn’t know if the gesture was deliberate or not, but he has to swallow hard anyway, turning his eyes downward once again. Teddy pats Sherlock on the shoulder once before turning away. He looks at John expectantly before heading into the living room. John glances at Sherlock but the man has already turned away, fiddling with his phone. He follows Teddy to the door.
The admission came from nowhere, Sherlock didn’t even know he had been thinking it at the time but he must have done, because he said it.
There’s a tense pause, then Mycroft sniffs and raises an eyebrow. “Don’t get too comfortable, Mr Watson. Remember, you and my brother have only just met. Do not fall under an assumption that you
Sherlock glances down at them and huffs out an irritated gust of air. “It’s for an experiment but they won’t corporate.” He aims the last word angrily down at the lights, as if they can hear him.
John assesses the tall newcomer, not recognising him but finding little similarities in Sherlock’s face. Their mouths are the same, as is the shape of their noses yet the taller man’s is longer. His face is lined and jolly, wrinkles set deep in the corner of his eyes and mouth; visual evidence of someone who spends much of their time smiling and laughing. His hair is white and long, tied back into a careless bun that should look odd on an older man but somehow works. Maybe due to the colourful and rather bohemian way the man is dressed; the white shirt rolled up to his forearms with a colourful array of small flowers dotted around the material, the bright red woolen waistcoat and dark blue jeans tucked into tanned cowboy boots. His wrists jingle with golden bangles, almost every finger shining with a variety of expensive looking rings.
The sound of rustling grass outside stops, as if Alex, too, has frozen. Sherlock edges the wood bit by bit nearer, and John reaches out to grab the other end when it’s close enough and helps lift it from the floor.
John breathes, eyes drinking in every fluid movement of the agile body as Sherlock cants his hips forward teasingly into John’s body. Sherlock gradually lowers his arms, resting them on John’s shoulders before pulling him closer so that their chests slide together as they move. John tilts his head upwards, resting his flushed cheek against Sherlock’s.
“Mycroft is our eldest,” Mrs Holmes nods. “Unfortunately we don’t see much of him due to his work in London, but he visits when he can.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes a bit manically and gives John a scathing look. “I’m under the influence, what do you expect? Just tell me you’re not angry with me. Even if you are. But make it convincing because I’ll be able to tell.”
Sherlock gives away nothing in his expression as he glances up from his phone. He takes a moment to reply, “We used to frequent the same circles.” He mutters vaguely.
John jerks slightly in surprise, tilting his head to the side automatically. Sherlock hums into his skin, licking delicately down to the base of his throat.
The whole building’s interior, regardless of its size, is adorned with cozy, warm furniture and a wide variety of art. John could see Mrs Holmes’ influence in everything, recognising the comforting style from the cottage she and her husband lives in back at home.
“Is it the light?” John asks lamely, flicking a hand towards the lamp in the corner of the room. “Because I can-”
Sherlock’s eyes followed the movement and he took a step into John’s personal space. John’s heart stuttered and he stared up at the expressionless face inches from his own, not knowing what he wanted except that he
“It’s a lovely surprise, put that bottom lip away young man!” Ms Bennet swats Sherlock on the behind as she passes him, rushing forward to accept an embrace from the older Holmes brother.
He bolts upright in bed, heart pounding and ears straining. It’s high pitched enough to be a woman. John holds his breath.
He got into a lot of trouble, his parents were called in and scolded him severely, kept asking him why he had done it and that it was unacceptable behaviour. Thinking this was rather unfair, Sherlock had tried to explain that the boy had pushed him first, but then he had just got a lecture on why violence was
John turned his head and glowered at his friend, who was stood pressed up against the box full of sweets John was still holding between their bodies and scowling at it.
Sherlock doesn’t react at first, doesn’t move a muscle. But then, he turns towards John slowly with the most awful patronising look John has seen yet, eyebrows raised and mouth twisted into a horrible little smirk. He opens his mouth and John reaches up to slap his palm over it before he can utter a sound.
Looks like his aversion towards food spans across any timeline. The instinct to encourage him to eat makes John bite the inside of his cheek more than once.
John’s eyes snap open, whole body tense. It’s still dark, he can’t have been asleep for long. He blinks at the wall, wondering what it was that woke him. Can’t hear anything. He rolls onto his back with a sigh and freezes. Not only is he still quite obviously in one of the spare bedrooms in Musgrave, but there is also a dark figure standing at the end of his bed. Watching him.
John snaps his head towards the door, where Eurus is entering with a mild expression. John quickly glances back to Sherlock, trying to gauge his reaction. Sherlock looks round at her in a relaxed manner before turning back to his plate with no expression. She slowly pads into the room and over to her brother’s chair, standing behind him. With slow movements, she raises her left hand and runs it up into his hair, carding slender fingers through the curls. Sherlock doesn’t react, takes a bite of toast.
It takes him a long time to fall back asleep, not relaxing until he is marginally confident she won’t come back.
They’re fast approaching a small crowd and Sherlock doesn’t slow down, he swerves through the people effortlessly avoiding the bodies and John darts behind him, using the pathway he’s created with practiced ease. He can hear Victor shouting apologies as he crashes into shoulders.
"What the hell are you doing!?" John asks for a second time, his anger increasing by the second at the manhandling.
Teddy went on to express his appreciation at John living so near and letting him sit in for a while.
He tries to remember the last thing he was doing before he knocked himself unconscious. He has to choke back another hysterical laugh as he remembers desperately wishing he could do just this, go back in time and change the outcome of his and Sherlock’s life. This must be a manifestation of those thoughts, he thinks logically. He was wishing for the unattainable, then knocked himself unconscious. So, in conclusion: this is a dream. He glances around himself. An extremely vivid dream. That can only be it. Deciding to just ride it out, ignoring the voice in his head that is claiming otherwise, he forces himself to breathe calmly and enjoy the feeling of being twenty-three again. What was he doing when he was twenty-three? He would have, indeed, been a medical student. He vaguely remembers having a girlfriend who lived near Sussex. Maybe he was supposed to be visiting her. And somehow hit his head..in the park. This is insane. Besides, what’s the point of trying to rationalise a dream, anyway?
“Oh, it’s nice to be home-OH!” He sprints around his room, switching on his fairy lights with a burst of manic energy.
They took him to the station, where lo and behold, his parents were frantically trying to communicate to a harried looking young officer by scribbling down the boy’s appearance on a scrap of paper. The boy ran immediately to them, wrapping his small arms around his mother’s legs and she flinched in surprise before whimpering and falling onto her knees gathering the child into her arms. The father placed a hand over his eyes in relief for a moment before gripping the child’s face between his large hands and leaning down to place a lingering kiss on top of his head. The three began signing to each other fluidly, much faster than Sherlock had been.
Sherlock tilts his head to the side, allowing the ministrations as his hands tug the girl towards him by the waist of her skin-tight dress.
A man's body had been found dumped in the freezer out back near the manager’s office, left neatly propped up next to the frozen veg and chicken breasts, along with an hour of blank footage from the CCTV cameras that had obviously been deleted. So the manager had called Sherlock and a day later John found himself wearing a uniform with the name tag 'Pete' adorning his left pectoral and a badge reading
The rest of the summer was a dance of politeness and indifference. Sherlock avoiding Enzo when it wasn’t obvious he was doing so, and treating the man with impeccable formality when they crossed each other.
John blinks, confused for a second before remembering his excuse for leaving Victor’s house early last night. “What? Oh yes. Much. Ta.”
“Just a sip.” Sherlock muttered, unusually sombre, and took the glass away before John could gulp its entire contents.
“Gaspard Dubois! My old nemesis!” Rudy cries, raising his fists in front of if him like a victorian bare-knuckle boxer.
They sat in comfortable silence for a while before John let out a yawn and heaved himself up off the sofa. He looked down at Sherlock with a frown.
Mrs Holmes is the in kitchen, fussing around making tea. John grins when he spots Victor sitting at the table, arm sprawled across the surface with his forehead cradled in the crook of his elbow.
John lets out a low groan and drops his hands, willing himself to calm down. Toby is right, there’s no point flying off the handle about something out of his control. He needs to make a plan.
By the time they get home, the beer is forgotten. Rachel is forgotten. And John makes his way over to his laptop with the intent of typing up a new bullet point.
John groans and shifts his weight. Is he on the floor? Must be. It’s too hard and his back is aching.
But it hasn’t been like that for a while. A long time. Since Sherlock came back, to be honest. They tried to get back there, to the relationship they had before and it was almost accomplished. But it hadn’t been the same.
been a disaster, it had also been everything John would have wanted in a stag night. Just him and his best friend, getting horrendously drunk together, stumbling into an adventure, and making thorough fools of themselves.
Sherlock’s eyes slid down to his lap again and said in a monotone voice, “I fucking hate conferences, why is this old fart explaining to me the many uses of pie charts? Think anyone will notice if I leave?”
Soon enough, John has barricaded himself in the red telephone box, staring at the metal ‘Insert 10p’ sign while the couple stand outside the glass, their muffled voices chattering away.
John gritted his teeth and forced himself calm. “Sir, you bought them in the reduced section. They were 20p, because they were green. I’m afraid-“
John shuts the door behind him and locks it, turning back to Sherlock who has stumbled backwards in alarm, face pale and eyes wide. He blinks at John in surprise before sagging against the sink with a harsh exhale of breath.
“I was in a lecture,” John shrugs, hoping Sherlock doesn’t detect the lie. He usually can but the Sherlock sitting across from him just nods and looks away deep in thought.
John sucks in a great lungful of fresh air, padding back over to the wooden railing and resting his hands on it, trailing his fingertips over the flaking paint.
He gives John a small quick quirk of his lips and John grins back at him, watching him stroll leisurely away.
One arm is wrapped loosely around Sherlock’s waist, the other laying straight across the pillow. His fingers are numb where Sherlock’s head has cut off the blood circulation to his hands, head heavily resting on his bicep.
It is nearly ten in the morning, and they have things to do, but John ignores that as he takes a throw from Sherlock’s armchair and drapes it over his friend. He can sleep for a little while longer, John thinks, heading to the kitchen. He only gets as far as the table when a furious pounding starts on the front door. John jumps in surprise and glances at Sherlock as the man jerks awake and falls off the sofa onto the floor in a tangled heap. John rushes for the door and flies down the stairs before Mrs Hudson can be assaulted with whoever is aggressively trying to knock their door down.
John looks down at his peaceful face, young and smooth. His dark eyelashes cast a shadow across his cheekbones. John reaches out to brush the tips of his fingers against the silky skin, soft and warm. John allows the tips to wander across the bridge of his straight nose, down to the plump lips, parted slightly. Warm air puffs across his skin, and John absently strokes the bottom lip gently.
Victor collapses into a crouch, while Sherlock and John stand with their hands on their knees, the sound of heavy panting filling the small room.
“Nothing. She was just standing there, watching me sleep. Was a bit creepy, I won’t lie. Then she just turned and left without saying a thing.”
Toby was right, it was a short walk. John had stared around himself, wary, as they crossed the road leading out of the park and down a street towards a row of shops and tried and failed to find recognition in any of his surroundings. As the ache in his muscles subsided from sleeping on the ground all night, or so he assumes anyway, John had started to feel like himself again. Actually feels pretty good, considering. He was absently surprised his shoulder isn’t as stiff as a board from the position and the cold.
Sherlock rolled back onto his side to face him. "No, he has to eat three times a day John. I did research," he said petulantly.
It’s not even a whisper, an exhale of breath at most, and John flutters his eyes open for a second to peek at Sherlock’s closed eyelids. He could have imagined the sound, the soft sigh from a dreaming mind.
“Hush, its fine. Go back to sleep.” Sherlock’s deep voice lulled him back into darkness just as John felt the cool flannel press gently back onto his forehead.
Toby and Evie glance at each other, she pulls a face. “Definitely think we need to go to the hospital.”
Sherlock was in the living room, wrapped in a blanket, watching Jeremy Kyle with an intense expression when John shuffled in. They had finished a two week case the day before and were supposed to be rewarding themselves with a day of doing sweet nothing.
John casts a look at Sherlock, who has adopted a rather content expression now the talk of hospitals has dispersed. He’s watching his hands as he runs his fingertips across the pads of his thumbs rhythmically, as if the sensation is new and riveting.
John clenches his jaw and looks down at his hands gripping his mug. Teddy slowly walks back to the table, sensing the tension, and sits. He give John a pointed look, eyes narrowed but John doesn’t meet it.
Toby glances at her in surprise, “Oh god, I totally forgot!” He looks back at John. “We’re meeting a couple of friends at a cafe just down the road, come with us, I’ll buy you a cuppa and we can brainstorm.”
Working part time at the surgery means John is forever in contact with all manner of germs and illnesses, and because of that he has himself quite a strong immune system and very rarely gets sick. Sherlock is much the same, to Johns dismay, considering the man hardly eats or sleeps or generally looks after his health in any way.
Sherlock doesn't dignify that with a response, John knows how much he detests repeating himself, and leisurely heads over to the coat rack by the door. He chucks John's coat at him before shrugging on his own.
"What the hell are you doing!?" John shouts. He watches in disbelief as Sherlock drops the now empty bottle into the bin. John can't believe it. His housemate really
Sherlock lets out an odd laugh suddenly, glancing back at John with a casual air. He rolls his eyes, smiling ruefully. “John, you’re overthinking this.”
From the corner of his eye he spies Sherlock letting out a silent breath of relief, shoulders slumping marginally.
As Rudy starts up another story about a pirate ship he bought in Maine, her eyes drift to John’s elbow and he tenses.
Suddenly the child snapped his head up and he jumped in surprise at John's proximity. John swiftly shuffled back a few steps, which made him feel a bit like a crab, and he held up his hands.
John gives him a doubtful look, but he’s tired and irritable and has a headache and selfishly doesn’t want to talk about this anymore.
Sherlock shoots John a dark look, and John smiles sweetly back at him, abandoning his teasing touches and simply sliding his entire palm across Sherlock’s crotch and giving a pointed squeeze.
The woman is sitting in Sherlock’s chair, which looks all wrong, and she raises her puffy and bloodshot eyes at him pitifully before all but leaping out of the seat.
John looks back at Victor, shrugs, twists into the opposite direction and begins running in the opposite direction.
John's eyes snap open when the warmth air hovering over his mouth bypasses it completely and then Sherlock’s lips are resting on his neck. He feels the man inhale and a shot of electricity pangs through him straight to his crotch. John tilts his head to the side, allowing more access without any conscious thought. He waits. For what, he isn’t sure. Sherlock doesn’t move except to exhale in a sigh and slumps slightly. John raises his arms and hesitantly crosses them over Sherlock’s back. If it wasn’t for the strain in his trousers, the doctor would take this as nothing but an odd embrace.
, Mr Trevor,” she shifts narrowed eyes back towards the boy, who shrinks back in his chair. She turns back to Sherlock expectantly.
John tries to imagine Sherlock leaving, wants to imagine it. Wants to see if he can stand the thought. Imagines him just going away. Of waking up in the morning and finding Sherlock wasn’t sleeping silently after all but was, in fact, gone. John grunts as an awful stab of nausea hits his gut and he rolls over, pulling his legs up to his chest to relieve it.
Victor’s eyes narrow, but before he can say anything else Mrs Holmes enters the room again and immediately demands to know what’s happened to her table. When there’s only a reply of guilty silence, she throws a dish cloth at Sherlock and tells him to mop up the mess.
On John's computer, there is a file. And in that file is a word document. And in that word document is a list. A list that John admittedly reads more than he updates, but one he is very fond of nonetheless. Whether Sherlock knows about the list, John doesn't know as he has never mentioned it. But considering his flatmate's temperament of being a nosey little bastard, John wouldn't be surprised if Sherlock has the list memorised.
Did he scare him? Was it too much? John feels a pang of guilt and closes his eyes. He had pinned Sherlock to a wall and had attacked him. Firstly with his fist, then his mouth. John feels terrible.
John hesitates for only a second, thinking of last night when his prying ended with Sherlock expelling him from his room. “What happened to your eye? It’s anisocoria, right?”
John starts, darting a look over his shoulder where Sherlock has materialised behind him, murmuring in his ear loud enough to be heard over the music but quiet enough so no one else hears. Large hands brace themselves on John’s hips and he sucks in a little breath. Sherlock’s thumbs slide into his belt loops, tugging playfully at the tight denim.
Before he had the chance to explain himself, Enzo had reached out with one hand and brushed back the curls at Sherlock’s temple with a small smile, tucking the hair behind his ear.
John snaps his head up, eyes wide. Sherlock is standing by the kitchen door, dressed immaculately in his usual suit and shirt combo. His eyes are resting on Teddy, unwavering.
John throws the door open and stares in surprise. A tall man with curly blonde hair matted on one side with blood, wearing a ripped suit and a wild expression stands panting on their door mat.
John frowns at the throwaway comment, wondering what on earth Sherlock had been dreaming about for him to have punched something so hard he cut open his knuckles while he was sleeping and didn’t even notice. John takes a deep breath.
“No it’s fine!” Sherlock interrupts, his voice unnaturally chipper. “You’ve got the baby coming and-I wouldn’t expect you to-I can’t imagine how busy you are.”
“I think-” She stops and glances down. Her hand slides down his arm and rests over his hand. “I think...I’ve made a terrible mistake.” She looks up at him through her lashes. John stares in disbelief.
John nods at him, thinking the fresh air might do him some good, then nods at the others, who slowly start collecting their things.
John patted Sherlock’s shoulder when he passed him a cup of tea, he ruffled his hair when he was sulking on the sofa, he squeezed the back of Sherlock’s neck when he was sat hunched over his microscope.
“Wait, wait-” John pants, reaching blindly behind Sherlock for the hand soap bottle. Sherlock groans in frustration.
of home-video footage from their childhood with Sherlock a few weeks ago. None of which, by the way, had any sign of their young sister which can only mean to John that Mycroft had spent a huge proportion of time meticulously erasing her existence from the films.
Mycroft’s pajamas are soft and luxurious, and as Sherlock predicted they fit nicely at John’s shoulders and chest but are a bit long on the arms and legs.
“I may never recover,” John whispers, staring at Sherlock’s pink tongue as it brushes against his full bottom lip. His long fingers edge across John’s shoulder to the base of his neck, fiddle with the short hair there. It feels nice.
John all but dragged the still-mostly asleep Sherlock up onto his bed. Once horizontal, Sherlock twitched about to get comfortable before he began snoring lightly again. John watched his slack, peaceful face and reached down to pull the cold flannel out of Sherlock’s sleeping grasp. Once that had gone, Sherlock immediately rolled over onto his side and slid his hand under his cheek. John huffed a tiny tired laugh, ignoring the fact that his friend’s sleeping position was familiar enough to him to be expected now. John also ignored the fact that as his fever had mostly gone, he could not blame it when his hand came up and gently brushed Sherlock’s curls away from his forehead as his own eyes began to droop.
“Oh, John!” She wails, throwing herself into his arms and sobbing. John catches her to stop himself toppling over, glancing at Sherlock with wide eyes.
“It works for someone else I know,” John gives the similar reply he gave to Victor, who voiced the same question those few days ago.
John was rather surprised at how easily Sherlock picked up the work, considering the man is allergic to any sort of manual labour that isn't chasing down a suspect. Well, at first anyway. The first day, John was left to work on the tills and Sherlock was to stock the shelves. Sherlock was perfect at it, uncomplaining, helpful and charming to customers who asked where this or that were kept. John was a bit proud, to be honest.
In one universe, thirty-three years ago, a young girl constructed by the power of nature rather than nurture, full of cold hate and jealousy and nothing much else, decides one day to kill her favourite brothers best friend. In a rather twisted bid to win her brother’s affection and attention, she pushes the small boy down a well, where the child tragically drowns.
John stares at them, baffled, as Rudy lets her go and pulls close another chair next to him. Eurus plops down with a grin and begins rattling off questions about life in London and whether he is still friends with Annie Lennox. John catches Sherlock’s eye with a frown, who leans over.
After a moment of silence Sherlock lets out an impatient huff, “Your purse. I should probably know what the man looks like if I am to find him, no?”
“Shit.” John murmurs to himself, rubbing his hands over his face. He stands, switches off the TV and slowly makes his way to the stairs, needing to lay down. Needing to leave this room.
John sniffs and clears his throat roughly, willing away the burn in his throat. The mania and terror from the last 24 hours has left him exhausted but his brain won’t stop it’s excessive whirling.
Sherlock moans into the kiss immediately, fingers tightening in John’s hair. Their mouths slide together roughly, and it’s completely different from the small kiss they shared last night. This feels desperate and rushed, lips parted sloppily as they pant into each others mouths.
“I know about the fire situation,” John states delicately enough but in a way that expresses there’s no need for an elaboration. Sherlock’s eyes dart up at him. John changes the subject.
John scowls at him, hating himself that even in his anger he would still blindingly follow Sherlock just because the man told him to.
Well, John supposes it doesn’t have to be right away. They should probably fix the flat up before opening any cans of worms. One thing at a time..
“Have to catch me first!” Sherlock shouts over his shoulder, grinning maniacally. He catches John’s eye and John can feel an answering grin pulling at his features.
“Woah, hey. Stay down for a moment.” John catches his shoulders and lowers him gently back to the ground. Sherlock tries to pat his hands away, but gives up after a moment, staring up at the ceiling with slowly blinking eyes.
need to be reminded!" Sherlock shouts, trying to yank his wrist out of John's grasp. John tightens his hold automatically, surprised.
Sherlock had stared and stared and realised then and there that yes, that’s what that feeling in his chest was, the one he’d so desperately been trying to ignore for months; it was love.
John blinks as cloudy blue eyes settle on his face, mind desperately trying to keep up with the rapid change of subjects. The man speaks much like Sherlock does when he’s talking himself through a multitude of deductions and evidence, as if his brain is running too fast for his mouth to keep up.
Sherlock considers the question, reaching up to cover his hands over John’s still resting on his cheeks.
John groaned and placed a hand over his eyes. Suddenly a burst of shocked laughter had filled the air and John looked up in surprise. Teddy was still chuckling, his dark eyes wide and fixed on Sherlock before turning them in disbelief onto John. “
“What are you doing here?” Sherlock asks, glancing towards his parents who are smiling and pouring glasses of wine over by the counter.
As the loud murmur of voices starts up again with overlapping conversations, John takes a moment to cast his eye around the room now the attention isn’t solely on himself. Mr Holmes and Alfie are laughing about something or other by the sink, Sherlock has been dragged off to a corner by Rudy and they’re conversing in low voices as the older man fiddles with the radio, while Mrs Holmes, Ms Bennet and Mycroft clink their wine glasses together with large smiles. John indulges himself with a quick assessment of Mycroft; he’s a little plumper than the one from home, hair fuller and a dark auburn, pale and freckly. He looks
“Oi!” John jerks his leg away as a shot of sharp pain radiates up his thigh. He turns to scowl at Sherlock, who gives him a rather vindictive look and flips his hair as he turns away once more. John can’t suppress a grin. “Little shit,” he murmurs. He spots Sherlock’s answering smirk in the reflection of the glass.
John frowns slightly as he watches his old friend make his way around the table and gently takes the bloody tea towel from Sherlock’s hand with a small smile and chucks the ruined thing into the washing machine. He comes back with the kitchen roll and mutters something close to Sherlock’s ear. The detective slides his phone into his pocket and rolls his eyes in response, snatching the kitchen roll away from the blonde. Teddy murmurs a laugh and goes to snatch it back, but Sherlock pulls it away before he can reach it with a smug smile. Teddy reaches for it again and this time manages to grab the roll with a laugh and breaks off a few squares, handing them to Sherlock, his eyes twinkling. Sherlock rolls his eyes again but it’s accompanied with a lopsided smile, and his eyes suddenly dart to John’s in a quick glance.
John hears the faint sound of feet landing on soft grass a few feet away and drops into a crouch, holding his breath. He shuffles forward silently, hovers over Sherlock’s body to glance out of the shed, resting his chin against the inky curls on the top of Sherlock’s head.
John ignores the insult, knows Mycroft well enough to spot an attempt at deflection with a well-timed barb. Sherlock does the same thing.
Teddy grins. “Yep! I’ll have to pop round! If that’s alright with you, of course.” It’s more of a statement than a question but Sherlock doesn’t hesitate to answer anyway.
John reaches down with clumsy hands and tugs at Sherlock’s jeans, working them open as he fights to breathe.
Sherlock twisted his arm outwards, effectively loosening the grip on his wrist and took a step backwards with a glare. He darted his eyes up and down the man, taking in his dilated pupils and flushed face. His hands were rough and calloused, obviously a manual labourer. Possessed a dominance kink, which definitely wasn’t ideal.
John allows the sharp nails a moment more of indulgence before trying to twist his head away again. Sherlock is mouthing along his jaw now, and as much as that feels
“I nearly punched Jules tonight,” John says conversationally as Sherlock enjoys the warmth of his palms.
“Erm,” John thinks rapidly, hand stilling on Sherlock’s leg. “Yeah, once for a school trip I think.”
Father had a business partner come and stay with them over the summer to work on a project, the details not something Sherlock had paid much attention to.
“Hm? Oh. Yes,” Sherlock drops his hands from his mouth and heads over to his adjoining bathroom. He leaves the door open, and John can hear the tell-tell sound of a belt being undone and a zipper being lowered.
“King’s College London,” John smiles over to her. “I’m hoping to stay on to do my Bachelors there too.”
Sherlock couldn’t bare to be apart from his friend, it was the oddest sensation. Not dissimilar to when Mummy or Daddy would drop him off at school, the longing to stay with them and not have to interact with the other noisey girls and boys. It was a deep ache, a nauseous feeling in his chest, and it made him irrationally angry. He would lash out and shout at the other children in his class, couldn’t understand why they kept asking him stupid questions or why they didn’t understand the tasks they were set.
Teddy chuckles, “Yeah, they’ve got the two goons. Apparently they’ve been up to all sorts of trouble, and will definitely be going down regardless of my case. They want me to go in tomorrow to identify them, though.”
They had sat on Sherlock’s bed, chatting lowly about Sherlock’s school work in an attempt to ignore the strained situation. Then Enzo had asked Sherlock why he had been hiding from him. Sherlock had denied it at first, stating he was busy composing, and the man had given him a doubtful look.
“No. I tried explaining it to the police, but they seemed pretty set on his guilt. Partly evidence, partly due to his previous convictions, and partly because the idiot boy made a thoughtless comment about an affair one of them was having with a babysitter.” She rolls her eyes.
me again?” John spat out, trying to circle around Sherlock in an intimidating manor. However, that put him right underneath the cat on the ceiling and John didn’t want the scrawny thing to land on his head so he stepped smartly away.
“Did you know he takes drugs?” John interrupts lowly, staring straight ahead and not really in the mood to hear about what Sherlock ‘isn’t’.
It’s incredibly disconcerting, sitting in the same room as a murderer and her victim. John forces himself to unclench his jaw as he glances between them, sending a quick mental reminder that the eighteen year old
After Sherlock had politely refused, the man had all but grabbed his shoulder, leaning in with a leer and announcing he wouldn’t take no for an answer.
“No, I mean…I don’t know…” Teddy stuttered, “I didn’t see their faces, I don’t know how much help I would be.”
Sherlock steps away, glances at the laptop then back at John as he leans against the table watching John open the bottle and downing half its contents.
“Shall we try and call a taxi or something?” Victor asks, watching Sherlock with a pained expression.
The second day, however, Sherlock got bored. He began stocking the bread by the crisps, and the energy drinks by the ice cream, and it was then that John realised that Sherlock had taken up the childish habit of purposefully doing a chore so spectacularly wrong so that he would never be asked to do it again. He did the same thing at home.  And so, Sherlock was placed on the till and John was left to stock.
The question could be aimed at a great many things but Sherlock takes it as an easier route of discussion aimed at the woman sitting in silence in their living room.
Victor finally raises his head to glare over at him. He really does look like death. Tanned skin now a sickly pale and the whites of his eyes are bloodshot.
John blinks, darts his eye up to Sherlock’s face. When their eyes meet, Sherlock shrugs again with utter nonchalance.
John quickly rolls onto his side, pretending to still be half-asleep, as Sherlock unlocks the door and swings it open with a feigned yawn.
John. It worked, how did you do that?” Sherlock’s eyes are wide, pupils still blown and jaw muscles twitching again.
Once John is settled in bed he hears Sherlock's bedroom door closing, soft and gentle in the darkness.
John knows, logically, that Sherlock’s drug-induced mind probably didn’t even notice the change of bodies, probably didn’t even know who he was grinding up against in the beginning anyway. “
“Thanks,” John says in wonder, can count on one hand the amount of times Sherlock has made him tea. He usually waits until John or Mrs Hudson passes him a mug.
Sherlock had lost sight of John pretty much immediately, the dancing bodies far too dense to make out his small form on the other side of the room. So when a burly man had sauntered over and asked to buy Sherlock a drink, he was confident he would be dealing with the situation solo.
him.” He flicks his eyes over John once more, expression twisting slightly. “He will grow bored soon enough.”
Moving to lay onto his back, John stares up at the wooden beams on the ceiling. Strange, how different yet the same the younger Sherlock is to the older one at home. His easy acceptance of John is one thing they both share, and it warms the doctor a little inside to realise that. That thought follows up with a recount of the bizarre moment they had shared earlier, the almost flirting. It makes John frown. He recognises he’s a massive flirt himself, always has been. And Sherock can be too, but it’s usually deliberate. An act of manipulation to get information out of certain witnesses. But occasionally, he would turn that distinctive charm onto John too. They would banter playfully the way John does with pretty women. Or there would be lingering glances, or steps into personal space. Soft breaths ghosting over faces. Tongues darting out to wet dry lips.
“Nice chat?” Sherlock asks, tilting his head towards the door. John inwardly cringes. It would be naive to think Sherlock hadn’t heard the conversation. The man would eavesdrop on a couple of pebbles if they could talk. John is about to snap something at him when he stops. Starting another argument isn’t going to help the situation. Sherlock is trying to diffuse the awkwardness with animosity, has been all morning. He doesn’t allow himself to rise to the bait. Instead, he steps closer to Sherlock, slowly enough for the man to draw away. He gently leans up and presses a soft kiss to Sherlock’s cheekbone. It’s an imitation of Teddy’s kiss earlier, but this time the intention is clear. Sherlock has frozen and John takes advantage, murmuring a quiet “I’m sorry” against his bruised skin. After a moment, he pulls back. Sherlock is staring at him with wide eyes and John gives him a small sincere smile. “I don’t want to fight with you, Sherlock.”
John can’t tear his eyes away from the crouching form of Sherlock, who is inspecting a broken vase on the floor on the other side of the room. He can feel a stupid smile on his face, doesn’t even try and stop it.
John blinks, "Shit, sorry." Then starts chuckling. He watches as Sherlock’s lips twitch and soon both of them are roaring with laughter on the debris covered floor. Through his laughter, John watches Sherlock. His blue eyes are bright with tears and his rare but genuine smile is huge and only for him and John thinks;
The first time John punched someone for Sherlock, the detective thought his heart would explode out of his chest. The only visible evidence of this was a tiny flicker of a smile Sherlock aimed at a wall when he turned his face away so John wouldn’t see. He wished with all his might he had been there to witness the hit, but that was impossible as he was being slammed onto the side of a police car at the time.
"It was. Burst pipe, flooded all the houses on this street, everyone had to be evacuated. The house owner’s son did it. Boring." Sherlock picks up a wine glass and inspects it in the light.
John pats at his pockets again, relieved to find ten pence and doubtfully pushes the coin into the slot, holding the receiver to his ear. A low beep indicates it’s ready for John to punch in the number, and he raises his eyebrows in wonder before quickly inserting Sherlock’s mobile number by heart. Three tones bounce around in a short melody, and a recorded voice announces pleasantly, ‘Sorry, the number you are calling has not been recognised. Please try again.’
“Teddy, this is Molly Hooper. Molly, Teddy Knowles,” Sherlock introduces, leaving her standing as he takes a seat next to John.
Sherlock grins at him, glances back at the man who is slapping his hands on his thighs uncontrollably.
John blinks his eyes open, his nose cold, his legs too. But his chest, his stomach, his arms, they are all warm. It’s early, too early. Birds are singing outside the open window, where a cool breeze is drifting into the room accompanied by the gradually lightening streaks of oranges and pinks panning across the carpet. Dark patches of the night are still lingering around the edges of the window. He can’t have been asleep long.
“-Uncle Chris found out, threatened to tell their parents and Joel…” John trailed off, raising his hand and swinging it like a bat, making a popping sound with his mouth like he had connected with something.
this Mycroft feel the need to keep an eye on his little brother? After all, wasn’t it Sherlock’s forgotten memory of Eurus and his fabrication of Victor the primary reason behind the eldest sibling’s concern? John doesn’t know; feels like there is far more things to be concerned about when it comes to Sherlock, in this world
John notices now the water damage on the wooden floor and the furniture. Mostly everything in there is unsalvageable, no wonder it was left behind.
“Oh. Ha. Nice one. Cheers,” Jules sniggers, falling sideways onto the wall next to him and finally managing to spark up his lighter.
“Cheers to that,” John had muttered quietly, clinking his wine glass against Sherlock’s on the table.
John looks back at him, takes a deep breath and reaches out a steady hand to cup Sherlock’s chin, pulling his mouth open to stop the gurning.
It doesn’t take long, four strokes at most, and then John lets out a gasp and spurts all over Sherlock’s stomach, his name on his lips.
John pulls himself out of the memory, heart thudding. Of course, he remembers the scenario in dazzling clarity as he does with every memory of Sherlock on his list, but the memory of how he had
John holds back his own scoff, and is cut off from replying when Mycroft gives him a hooded look and turns back towards the door.
“Huh,” Sherlock lets out a little puff, stretching his arms above his head and letting out a sigh of content when his joints crack. He turns his face towards John, raises a teasing eyebrow.
Rachel and her young artist had ended up in an blaring row. Jed didn’t seem, or rather didn’t want, to recognise the severity of the situation. The young man hadn’t even known how long he had gone MIA. Didn’t really seem to care. In the end, after ample refusals to go to the hospital, they had shoved the young man into a taxi back to the flat he shares with Rachel. The woman, cold and vicious at that point, had demanded he collect his things and go.
Sherlock, however, smiled and waved his hand in a, what John had assumed was a universal, 'hello' before opening his left palm and used his right index finger to draw a curved line from the tip of his left index to the tip of his thumb. He smiled and murmured, "John," as he did so and John blinked at his face.
John slides his fingers between Sherlock’s, watching with a grin as Teddy stares up at Molly with wide eyes. A small smile gradually lights up his face and Molly blushes, bites her lip. Smiles back.
“I don’t know what you’re laughing at, young man,” the old woman snaps, shoving another plate in front of John.
John doesn’t delete the list, but he doesn’t add anything else to it, either. Doesn’t need to, he can remember with sparkling clarity every moment he and Sherlock share together.
“I’m glad you’ve established that,” Sherlock replies, turning to give John a strangely pointed look. John frowns in confusion as he follows his friend, ignoring the suspicious and bloodshot eyes that track him. He feels Rachel grip onto the back of his jacket as she shuffles in behind them.
"Well I couldn't very well just leave him there." The blanket cocoon shifted with what John guessed was a shrug.
“Of course,” Sherlock nods, “So, you’ll be back here before you know it.” He gives Teddy a bright smile.
John switches off the bedside lamp, says a silent goodbye to this peculiar world and falls almost immediately to sleep.
“Yeah. Good,” John heaves in a breath and lets it out again slowly. He turns in the circle of Sherlock’s arms and the younger man drops them but doesn't move back. “Why did you do that?"
Sherlock starts a bit and glances at his hand, flexing his fingers in and out of a fist as the bloodied scabs shift with his bruised skin.
John laughs as Toby wraps his arms around Evie’s waist and spins her around and around on the dance floor until she pulls away looking a little green in the face and stumbles until the man catches her again.
Teddy looks unconvinced but before he can express this, Sherlock moves past him towards the kettle. John tries to ignore the fact that he walks around the other side of the table, away from him.
can hardly do that at all when Sherlock breaks away for a breath and begins biting his way down John’s jaw, licking away the sting with that clever tongue.
“No, it’s not…” John doesn’t know where to begin. If he should even say anything at all. He can’t deny the thought of confiding in someone is appealing, however, and Teddy is egging him on with his eyes.
John responds with a venomous glare and she starts slightly before hurriedly groping in her jeans pocket for her phone. “But I do have a few pictures of him on my phone.” Her tone is carefully level while her thumbs fly over the screen before placing it in the man’s still-outstretched hand.
Mycroft’s drawl is heavily layered; flippant, mocking, curious, reluctant, pleased. John doesn’t know how he can convey so much in one carefully worded sentence.
. But a dark suspicion is arising within him. Who’s he kidding, suspicion? It's bloody obvious. She must have been seeing the younger man while John and her were still together if they had already moved in together. Rachel wasn't the type to dive head first into anything. She was hesitant about everything, utterly unimpulsive. The complete opposite of Sherlock.
very pretty, though.” He tugged Sherlock towards him roughly, making the other man stumble and catch himself on the bar to stop him falling into the broad chest.
John stands there, frozen amid the flurry of movement around him, can feel a horrible mixture of disappointment and anger churning his stomach.
John’s eyebrows crease together as he watches his usually eloquent friend stumble over his words. Sherlock doesn’t meet his eyes. John lowers his again and continues his task before noticing something on the back of Sherlock’s hand.
There’s a pause where John pretends to look disappointed by this news and Victor gives Sherlock an oddly calculating look. “Did you know that yesterday?”
John had asked if Sherlock was okay, who had nodded silently, and John had grabbed his arm and dragged him from the club.
John stared at his friend as he communicated silently with the small child, utterly baffled. It shouldn't really surprise him that Sherlock knew sign language, he had never come across a language Sherlock couldn't speak at least some-what fluently, but it still took his breath away every time he witnessed it. The sheer intelligence and talent this man possessed should be the cause of jealousy, but John never could muster up that particular emotion. It was simple awe. And pride. And love.
The next strike John didn't anticipate at all. Too busy chasing Sherlock around London and just generally not paying attention to much else, he woke up on a Sunday morning feeling, quite literally, like death. Blocked nose, pounding headache, aching limbs, hot flushes, the whole shebang. Sitting up made his head spin and he miserably crawled out of bed. John stopped on the landing. Staring down the stairs with a gut full of dread. They were moving. The stairs were definitely moving. Deciding the best and safest option was probably descending them of his arse like a toddler, John did just that.
“Don’t be like that,” the man had slurred, snatched Sherlock’s wrist when he had turned to move away. “You
The girl folds into Sherlock lewdly, pressing stained lips against his collarbone as heavily made-up eyes flick over to John with a triumphant look.
Sometimes, Sherlock would lean over John’s shoulder while he was tapping away at his blog, just to see how the man would react. Usually he would ignore him, or push him away when Sherlock said something derogatory about his writing. But once, Sherlock felt John’s face turn towards him and his breath danced across Sherlock’s cheek. John sat there, eyes flicking over the turned away features, and maybe he thought Sherlock didn’t notice, or maybe it was pointed, a silent hint. Sherlock kept his face looking ahead, then slightly tilted his head to the side to bare his neck and felt John’s breath hitch slightly. He bit back a smile and turned away.
John stares out over the garden, wondering on Mycroft’s blind trust and if it’s genuine or some sort of test.
John mutters a curse and reaches down, fingers straining and body hanging suspended off the side of the bed as he tries to locate the phone.
Not that it is a mystery at all, if Sherlock is telling the truth about knowing where the man is. John himself is rather sceptical.
“Didn’t mean to startle you. Bad dreams?” Sherlock is peering at him with interest, dressed in a pale blue t-shirt and baggy grey jogging bottoms.
Sherlock's hands slide down to John's stomach as John's creep down the wall, reaching under Sherlock and grabbing is arse, roughly tugging him forward. The friction is intense, and they pant into each other's mouths. Sherlock's hands slide back up to John's chest and pause there before adding pressure. John growls low in his throat, pushing himself further into the body pinned against the wall, utterly undone. The pressure coming from Sherlock's hands increases and it takes John one second longer to realise the man is trying to push him away.
John heard a sharp intake of breath behind him and suddenly Sherlock was sitting next to him on the cold, dirty ground with his legs crossed. John watched in bemusement as Sherlock's right hand came up and he rested his middle and index fingers to the side of his brow, before brushing them away and twisted them forward into the air as if he was flicking away an errant hair. He pointed towards the child before wagging his finger in front of him.
Sherlock stood up, brushing dirt off his backside and pocketing his phone. “I’m fairly certain it-“ He stopped suddenly and grabbed John, shoving him further into the stock room and pushed him between two large cages full of delivery. John was about to protest when he heard footsteps enter the back room, the person lifting something heavy from a shelf then disappearing again.
Sherlock squirms in the hug, face a little flushed, but he’s grinning widely and squeezes the man’s forearms affectionately when he is put back down.
John’s eyes close as he hears the man’s bedroom close softly, feeling everything and nothing at all.
He was called Enzo and he was tall and blonde and French, with tanned skin and sky blue eyes. He was also fifteen years older than Sherlock, and could speak six languages and would call Sherlock
The memory of last night makes his eyes snap open again, he pulls back. Takes into account where he is.
Now John is imagining just that and he rubs his fingers hard into his eye sockets to get rid of the imagine.
Much like his bedroom at Baker Street, Sherlock’s space is an organised accumulation of odd nik naks, books and trinkets. There’s a microscope and chemistry set on his desk under a window that overlooks the garden, and a distinct burn mark on the wooden floor that’s half-covered up with a rug. John spots his violin case propped up in one corner and, most curious of all, is the old wooden upright piano sitting next to it.
John nods, turning his body to face him fully. “So well, in fact, that he seems to be under the impression that you have me spying on him.”
Seeing Sherlock in a uniform, serving customers and stocking shelves wasn't something John could possibly ever get used to. Or Lestrade, who would come in everyday under the pretext of buying a Meal Deal and wait at the end of an aisle until Sherlock was on till so he would have to serve the inspector.
John lets go of his hands, watching with growing dread as Sherlock’s arms flop down to his sides like a ragdoll.
“Yup,” John nods, shifting his own body to mirror Sherlock’s position. Takes a moment to relish the fact he can cross his legs without any twinges in his joints.
John is shoving past the boy before he’s even finished his sentence, a low buzzing in his ears as he forces his way through the crowd.
"John," Sherlock starts, his breath still coming out in harsh gulps but John doesn't wait around to hear what he has to say and bolts from the room, slamming the door open and sprinting up the stairs into his room.
Sherlock uses his free hand to slide up and under John’s shirt, fingers skimming across his stomach and torso, nails dragging lightly on the way back down and making John jerk.
John hadn’t allowed himself the luxury of indulging his need to read the list again. He felt out of place, adrift, not knowing what to do or what was acceptable. It hasn’t helped that Sherlock hasn’t had one case during this time. It especially hasn’t helped that Sherlock hasn’t delved into a usual and expected sulk. Two weeks is a long time for the man to go unentertained, but he hasn’t snapped once. Hasn’t even glared or huffed. He is the epitome of politeness and it is unnerving. John has no idea how to act around the man. Every morning he will go downstairs and Sherlock is either up already and immaculately dressed, making tea for the two of them, or will appear within the hour. Immaculately dressed and making tea for the two of them.
About three months ago, John and Sherlock found a child. Not while on a case, not while intentionally looking for said child, but by pure coincidence. They had been walking back to Baker Street from food shopping and were bickering about the whole ordeal. Sherlock explaining that it would be far easier to do their shopping online and get it delivered to the flat so that they didn't have to go outside, John explaining that he liked to actually
Victor can’t stop a quick grimace from twisting his features but he covers it up swiftly with a strained smile and looks over to the siblings.
It’s a flowery way to state the obvious, John thinks, but when Sherlock rolls his eyes and huffs loudly it’s clear the topic of conversation wasn’t chosen solely for John’s benefit.
But then she is turning back to her Uncle with a look of playful disbelief at his speech and the moment passes.
John doesn't know, can't ever seem to follow what Sherlock is thinking these days, so he simply shrugs and turns away.
Rachel gives Sherlock a strange look. “Erm, no. Not really. Not in this century,” She turns the look to John, smirking slightly with a disbelieving look in her dark eyes that screams
John wets another tissue under the stream of the tap and begins mopping up the stains on Sherlock’s top, then his own. He dumps everything in the toilet and flushes away the evidence of their activity.
He belatedly realises he is standing, and not knowing what to do he takes one step towards Sherlock’s door. He stops. What exactly is he going to do, burst in and demand Teddy leave?
“You must be Eurus,” John quips back, wondering who told her about him and extending a polite hand for her to shake, silently hoping his palm is dry. She takes his hand in a firm grip, glances down at it after a second and looks back up at him through dark lashes, a lazy smirk stretching across her face. John takes his hand back as casually as he can.
The older man sucks in a delighted breath, glancing at Sherlock with a large white smile before slapping John’s hand away and pulling him into a strong embrace.
“For fucks sake! I didn’t want to buy green fucking potatoes!” The man screeched. A child started crying and John was seriously losing his patience.
Teddy has taken it upon himself to ‘pop round’ every day since his surprise visit three days prior. John had let the man stand shaking on their doorstep for thirty surprised seconds before ushering him inside. John had then shoved the incoherent man into his arm chair and pushed a hot cup of tea into his trembling hands. Sherlock, sulking from the rude awakening had sat scowling at Teddy on the sofa, wrapped tightly in the blanket John had draped over him not five minutes before. John sat in Sherlock’s chair and Teddy began explaining how he had just been attacked a few streets away, jumped in an alley by a couple of thugs who had stolen his wallet, phone and watch.
John stares at him, can’t stop his thoughts from racing and jumping to awful questions and even worse conclusions. Is he only doing this to fulfill some sort of sick fantasy, suppressed and ignored for so many years that he had forgotten its existence?
“Alex is a drug dealer isn't he,” John says tiredly, straightening up and crossing his arms across his chest.
There was a long pause, before a whisper had drifted to Sherlock through the crack of the door, “Tu me manques, agneau.”
John starts and twists his head around to see Eurus standing behind him, arms crossed and an unimpressed look on her face.
The boy, who had been following John's gaze to Sherlock, looked quickly back to John and his eyes dropped to his mouth briefly.
A few hours later, after having Lestrade scream at them that they were hereby forever banned from going undercover again, and Sherlock muttering ‘We’ll see how long that lasts’ which resulted in more furious screaming, the two friends finally got home.
“Toby,” the girl mutters, taking a step towards the mans turned back and reaches out to touch his shoulder blade. “Maybe we should just…” She trails off, looking pained.
John didn’t have the heart to tell them they were actually both wrong and that it’s impossible to digest chewing gum at all but it would come out eventually… And he certainly wasn’t going to tell them that the only reason he knew that was because he and Sherlock had had the same argument about three years ago that had ended with a quick google search and the both of them simultaneously muttering, ‘
John stares down at him, conflicted. By all means, he should go to a hospital. But he knows Sherlock, the man has never liked anyone checking him over other than John. His face is scrunched up in a painful grimace and John knows that if his eyes were open they would clearly depict a certain level of desperation.
“Ah, let’s never speak of that again eh?” Teddy chuckles, ignoring the dark atmosphere. He glances at his watch. “On that note, I must be off. Trains to catch, people to see etcetera, etcetera.”
He casts around for something to say, the distant sound of the other two boys bickering drifting over to them.
When they’ve finished their tea, Sherlock stretches out on John’s bed while the older man has a quick shower in the ensuite. Wrapping the towel around his waist, John looks at the pile of clothes from yesterday with a grimace. His jeans are muddy, the legs a bit stiff where it’s hardened overnight, and his jumper isn’t much better. Not to mention putting on yesterday’s pants always makes John feel rather disgusting. With a sigh, he pulls the pajama bottoms on again, deciding to go commando and ask Sherlock if he could use the washing machine. He goes to pull the soiled jumper over his head before simply dumping it back on the floor and heading back into the bedroom.
God, he was actually hurt? Hurt more by Sherlock’s obvious need for drugs (which doesn’t even seem particularly fair in hindsight as
John absently registers that he’s still in 1996, pushing down a pang of anxiety this thought accompanies. Not a dream, then. Although John was seriously doubting that conclusion long before now. Won’t rule out a vivid hallucination just yet, mainly because the thought that he’s actually gone back in time is not only illogical but utterly
John frowned, vaguely remembering seeing a, what he had thought empty, fish bowl indeed on top of the microwave before they had left that morning but had actively disregarded it. "There was a fish in that?" He backtracked. "You called it Dennis?"
The three boys blink. Then simultaneously let out a breath of relief, shoulders slumping. Sherlock lowers the wood.
John frowns at the harsh reply, he understands Sherlock’s anger but how can he make it right if the man won’t let him speak? “I’m just saying-”
Maybe it was the kiss. Maybe it was Teddy. He isn’t certain, but something has changed. A new clarity has settled into John and he doesn’t know what to do with it.
When Mr Holmes had called them down for dinner, John had automatically headed for the large dining room, but Sherlock had caught his arm.
John pretends to be thinking hard for a moment. “Nope, don’t think so. It might be too early to tell,” John replies, bringing the cup to his lips.
“Did he faint?” An unknown person asks loudly. Muttering breaks out around them, each asking similar questions.
The officer looked towards at John and Sherlock in immense gratitude, slumping down into his chair. John couldn’t help the smile that had overtaken his face, and he directed it at Sherlock who was following the family’s conversation with keen eyes.
John’s always found it rather incredible just how much Sherlock looks like his parents, as if someone had gathered every striking feature in both parties and moulded it into something new. He honestly couldn’t say who Sherlock took after more, but his unique eyes, with their unnatural paleness and cat-like shape, is all Emelia. She’s a little less plump than John knows of her, her hair not the endearing white but a sandy blonde gathered up into a messy bun.
"Don't worry, they're finished for the day. Won't be back until morning." With that, Sherlock eases his wrist out of Johns grasp and opens the door, stepping inside.
Teddy gives him a strange look. He takes a breath as if to say something but then lets the air flow out of his mouth in a hard exhale. “See you tomorrow, mate.” He gives John a raised eyebrow and leaves with a soft click of the door.
John hadn’t even blinked. Had snapped, “I love you too,” right back and crushed his mouth to Sherlock’s with bruising force.
Sherlock turns to face him fully, leaning one hip on the railing and shaking his head at John as if he’s a child who has just announced he’s Spiderman. “You are. I understand, maybe I have alluded towards...
"I know you got Teddy's watch back," he attempts a different approach, "That was really great of you. It meant a lot to him."
John groans and covers his head with his arms. John has fantasised about kissing Sherlock before and it was always sweet and gentle, soft declarations and small smiles. Not the aggressive, desperate lunging that had actually happened. John was surprised at his behaviour, at how quickly his anger had turned into something else entirely. But the thing that surprises him the most was Sherlock’s reciprocation before he had pushed him away.
John doesn't really know what to say to that so he just smiles a bit tightly and reaches down to pat her hand twice, using the gesture as an excuse to gently brush it away from his thigh. Taking the hint, she folds it back onto her lap.
John raises his other eyebrow, but then reaches out and cups Sherlock’s cheeks with his hands. The younger man’s eyes immediately close and he lets out a sigh of content across John’s face.
Sherlock licks his bottom lip, then sends John a bright smile which turns abruptly down into a frown.
