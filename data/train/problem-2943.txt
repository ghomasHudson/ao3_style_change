You could’ve had it. All of it.” he whispers.
When it was all said and done, with God defeated and Jack gone, the first thing Dean does is cry. He crumples himself in the little nook in the library where they keep the good liquor, ignoring Sam’s heavy disappointed sigh and worried eyes until he’s left alone. He cries until his face is itchy with dried tears, until his body is stiff from hunching into himself for too long. He doesn’t stop until his voice is hoarse from repeating the same words of regret—
So how— It’s just— It doesn’t make sense.
for Cas. For himself too. Plain and simple. 'Cause if there’s one thing that deserves Dean’s undying loyalty and faith, it would be Castiel’s love.
He didn’t know.
. If it was the last chance I was gonna get, I wanted to tell you at least once. I wanted you to know. But— But I couldn’t. I got so scared so I— I told you I needed you instead... I told you I needed you because that was easier than saying I love you and then still watching you leave. I never even said that to anyone, not since my mom died. I couldn’t tell you I love you and have it thrown back at my face. And besides, you weren’t
“Then they aren’t worth it.” Dean said, running his hand through Sam’s long hair. “You hear me? We’re fucked up, both of us, but anyone who can’t handle it isn’t worth our time.”
“Shh.” Sam hissed, resting his head on Dean’s shoulder. “No spoilers.”
Castiel groaned and well… one thing led to the next. Use your grown up brain to figure out the rest. Dean was pleasantly sore the next morning when he ducked out of Castiel’s motel room. He couldn’t help but admire the sleeping man in the bed, hair fluffed and a hickey decorating his neck. Against his better judgement, he left his phone number on a napkin laying on the table.
“Okay!” Emma agreed and they made a nest of blankets on the floor.
And with that Dean was stalking off towards his next class leaving behind a Castiel who’s feet were barley touching the ground. Meg and Balthazar were giving him questioning looks as he walked up to them.
Dean took his own roller and rolled a stripe  of blue down Cas’ shirt. Laughing and dancing away, Cas took the pan of paint and a paint brush. He scooped up a lob of blue paint with the brush and flung it at Dean.
“Yes, I am aware.” Dean could practically see Cas rolling his blue blue eyes. “I am only in need of your services tonight.”
Taking Cas’ hand, they made their way out to Baby. Dean got in and Cas sat shotgun. There was a slight tension in the air. A bit of awkwardness they weren’t used to. Dean tried to fix it by turning on the radio, but it didn’t do much.
“Hey, Emma.” Sam said gently before crouching down to be eye level, or at least closer to eye level with the eight year old. “Are you okay? Do you hurt anywhere?”
Shit, Castiel wanted to kiss him. Dean was close. Their breath was fogging up between them. Castiel leaned in and Dean’s eyes were fluttering.
“What?” Dean stopped moving, his hand staying in the sink where it had just dropped the plate.
Finally, Dean finished his calculus. He technically still had a few pages of statistic notes to take but he figured he could finish them in home room. Dean filed away his homework sheet and textbook back into his backpack.
“Since it slipped your mind, I’ll remind you. I was the one who helped you take over after you killed Naomi, hell I was helping you before that with the altering orders down the pecking order and getting the other’s favor.”  Duma let out a humorless chuckle. “And as payment you hinder the Angels. You’re soft, Castiel, with your charity work and the business meetings. We need to be destroying our enemies, not  giving them platitudes and shoving them back to regroup.”
“Of course.” Cas smiled, he was already dressed. The mob boss pecked Dean on the lips. “I love you, too. Head out as soon as you can, your brother is most likely already preparing.”
Sam changed into sweats and a t shirt. He laid down and was prepared for a long night. One thing was grateful for was the thick walls and doors of the home. The last thing he wanted was the have to listen to whatever was going on in his brother’s bedroom.
So when he was going to hunt a wendigo and found the blue eyed man stalking through the woods Dean had many feelings. One of which was aroused. Short story even shorter, they ended up hunting the thing together. Turned out his name was Castiel Novak.
“I won’t be heading back to the office tonight.” Cas continued. “And I won’t be having you die due to your own stubbornness.”
“Do you feel safe, Dean?” Cas asked him, those blue eyes melted if only a little. “Do you feel safe with him up here?”
Dean will admit he jumped, come on it was fucking creepy, but he definitely didn’t yelp. “Fuck, Sam. What the hell is wrong with you?”
“What?”
“I mean heaven’s a big place.” Dean shrugged. “I could just avoid him.”
He almost called her down, to get her feet back on the ground so gravity couldn’t have its way with her. Then he remembered Sam and him climbing the same car piles when they were younger. They never got too hurt just a few scrapes and bruises that kids got all the time. Sighing, he began climbing the pile.
“We have a strict violence,” Principal Charles turned to Axel, “and no bullying policy. Both will receive lunch room detention and Friday Free time will need taken for three weeks.”
“I do actually.” Cas shuffled his feet. “How’d you know?”
He gasped and his hands clutched Cas’ hair. Dean’s head fell back into the door and for a while Cas licked, kissed, sucked, and bit at Dean’s exposed skin. Moans and whines were drawn from his lips and Cas seemed to soak them all up with happy noises of his own. Dean’s nipples became perky and ruddy and he was sure his neck and collar bone were covered in dark bruises.
“O’course.” Dean felt his face heat up to match Cas’ new hair. “We’ve got a mess to clean up.”
“Y-“ Dean cleared his throat and tried again. Fuck his emotions. “You know I didn’t technically say that I loved you.”
The impala was shifted into park and Dean was leaning over and kissing Cas, long and slow. Dean pulled Cas closer so they were as close as they could get sitting in the front seat of the impala. His boyfriend, no fiancé, his fiancé pulled away to kiss at Dean’s cheeks, nose, forehead, neck. He couldn’t help but laugh. Cas sat back and smiled at Dean. It was a moment he wanted to freeze forever, just press pause and live right there forever.
“I’m sorry, Mary.” John turned to his wife who was crying and looking at John like a stranger.
Dean’s lips were on his and they were as soft as Castiel had imagined. He tasted like his mom’s weird hot dish and something Castiel could only describe as sunshine.
“Oh, here.” Dean handed Castiel a flower, it was a pink carnation. He then tucked it into Castiel’s breast pocket. Castiel was frozen, then Dean looked at him and he was thawed out with those apple green eyes.
“I don’t want you to move out.” Dean liked having his family under one roof.
It was the night. He waited until after dinner and then it was time to put his plan into action. It was either now or shove the ring into the back of his underwear drawer and let it torment him for months.
“Fine, this better be worth it.” Cas stood and Dean followed his boyfriend into the kitchen.
He looked around the kitchen. He had cooked in it many times over the last year, but tonight would be his first time cooking in the kitchen that was his. It…it was different.
After talking with Emma, who was super excited about the idea, Dean pulled Cas outside after he got home from the hunt. The dark haired man seemed confused, and a little scared. It took the pressure off of Dean’s shoulders if only a little bit.
“Sam-“ Dean growled.
He couldn’t wait to tell Meg and Balthazar. Castiel got into his car and started it. He flickered through the radio stations, looking for something to match his mood-
“My little slut has an attitude.” Cas bit on Dean’s nipples, and well, Dean really couldn’t be judged for the noise that tore its way out of him.
Cas’ face showed that he did not find it weird, but the mob boss just nodded. “Anything else?”
“Come start dinner with me?” Dean said and tugged Castiel by the hand into the kitchen.
The brothers got their gear from the trunk. Sam gave Dean a stern face when he reached for the grenade launcher. Stupid buzz killing little brothers. Then they made their way quietly inside the dark house with their boring weapons.
Cas said he would give me time. He’s a reasonable guy.
Gordon spit at Dean. Thankfully it missed and landed at his feet. “Go to hell.”
“Maybe we should only go for a week.” Dean brought a hand up to his mouth to chew at his fingernails.
“I’m disappointed, Gordy.” Dean sighed. He spun around and hit Gordon’s pinky with the hammer.
“Oh, no you don’t.” Dean growled before tugging Cas forward and kissing him.
“You know I used to get bullied too.” Sam said on a whim.
“Don’t worry about it.” Jerry waved off, standing up and stretching his back out. “Just get them done tomorrow.”
Crack.
“Sorry, Sammy.” Dean rubbed at the back of his neck then winced as he pulled at his wound.
“Uh, so since you’re marrying Dad, and that means you’ll be my dad too.” Emma fidgets with the ring hanging from a chain around her neck. “Should I call you dad now too?”
If Cas did decide to break up, Dean may as well enjoy this last lay. This was how Dean convinced himself his plan could wait for Cas’ plan to finish. There were hot mouths kissing, sucking, biting, and licking. There were warm hands griping and sliding over flexed muscle and raised scars that marred smooth skin. It was hot and messy. Dean was grateful to get to taste Cas’ perfect dick for a possible last time. Getting his brains sucked through his own dick was also a definite bonus.
“Hmm, I enjoy watching you work.” Cas walked up to Dean, blue eyes roaming over his naked top half, and pulled him close. Cas very clearing had a budding erection. “It’s beautiful.”
“Oh, my-“ Dean laughed. “You should have seen your face!”
“This is a place you visit often?” Cas’ eye brows raised questioning.
Castiel froze for one brief second before taking a spot next to Dean. The family dug in and Castiel copied. The food was…oddly good. It was a hot dish of sorts with a weird texture but it wasn’t bad.
“Have fun, Sammy.” Dean told his brother cheekily. “Don’t forget protection, Emma doesn’t need a cousin just yet.”
Shit, he should probably get his brain back on line.
“I get that Mom died, I’ve been there when someone you loves dies. That doesn’t give you any fucking excuse to drag your kids all over the damn country. It doesn’t give you the right to drink yourself shit faced and then take your anger and hurt out on me. But things were messed up way before that. You may have loved Mom but you had a weird way of showing it coming home drunk and all the fucking fighting. Then you’d be gone again for who knew how long, and it was me all over again to fix your mess.
“Okay, you’ve got to tell me who the cutie is sitting over by your stuff.” Caroline asked, gesturing to Sam.
“Uh, thought you were going to say you sensed it through the force.”
“It’s beautiful.” Cas stared at the silver band. “I love you, so much.”
“Dean, for the-“ Cas sighed in exasperation. “Don’t antagonize anyone and don’t get into anymore trouble than you already are.
“Just what this kid needs, another male figure.” Axel’s mother grumbled.
Dean sighed. Did he really want to talk this over with Sam? Well, he would eventually, so he may as well do so when Sam was initiating it.
“Uh, what would change?”
“Fuck!” Dean cried out. “Cas!”
————->
Twenty minutes later Castiel was out of the shower and dressed in dark wash jeans and a worn grey t-shirt. It was the most casual Dean had seen him. That paired with the thick socks and still damp shower hair was making Dean’s stomach do funny things.
——————>
Cas didn’t know how he kept getting himself into these situations.
“I don’t want to just be someone you only see on the holidays. I want to be there when Emma scores a goal in soccer, I want to babysit on your date nights, I want to watch her grow up.”
- Kiss me once 'cause you know I had    a long night-
Dean’s eyebrows skyrocketed. Was Cas really going to ask? The mob boss was rarely at a loss for words so seeing him stumble was great. Cas made an annoyed gesture and pointedly continued on the bullet hole. Dean snorted and took pity on him.
“I’d would do it all over again.” Cas’ lips formed a small smile. “Especially to get where I am right now.”
Dean couldn’t stop smiling the entire way home.
“Yeah, kinda.” Emma shrugged. “I like school.”
“Why not?” Sam actually looked offended.
“Uh, usually I am, or at least a little, but I drew the short straw and am DD tonight.” Dean raised his cup. “Nothing but pop for me tonight.”
“Go away, Gabriel.” Castiel huffed at his tie and threw it to the ground.
A shudder runs through Dean’s body as his throbbing erection was exposed to the room temperature. He couldn’t help but be proud of himself because a month ago he would have came already.
“Yeah, your Dad is smart, isn’t he?” Sam smiled. He had hated when Dean worshiped their father and made him a hero, but when Emma did it it didn’t bather Sam. Maybe it was because he thought Dean was a good dad, or he still had a hero worship thing about his big brother. “School isn’t for everyone. Different people like and are good at different things. Just because someone doesn’t get good grades doesn’t mean they’re stupid.”
“Then we are both out of bed and I don’t see how that is any better.” Cas grumbled.
“You busy?” Dean asked. “Like do you have to go back to the office right away?”
“You sure?” Dean asked, taking the ring and eyeing it.
Tossing the soiled wipes on the ground Dean curled back into Cas who gratefully excepted Dean. This was how they fell asleep, wrapped tightly around each other naked in a large bed.
It was only because of Dean’s weird ass childhood that trained him as a fucking assassin that he was able to get dressed and leave a note saying he had gone home, not to worry on Cas’ nightstand in the dark. Actually, all of that was more likely from nights not wanting to wake his dad up from a drunken slumber and not necessarily the long training hours.
“Have you been hiding him?”
“Words, Dean.”
“You wouldn’t mind it?” Cas tugged at his naturally dark brown hair.
“No.” Cas smiled. He kissed Dean before rolling off the bed. Dean watched almost mournfully as tight, black jeans got pulled back up.
“Boy, that don’t-“
“And if it goes south you can say I told you so and we get the hell out of dodge. We’ve gotten out of contracts before.”
“Oh, yeah?” Dean leered and wiggled his eyebrows. “I don’t know if those kind of services are in the contract, but I think we can work something out.”
“Yeah, it’s better than I thought it would be.” Cas ran his hands through his hair. Then he stood and gave Dean a deep kiss. “Thanks for helping, baby.”
“Sap.” Dean smiled.
Dean’s phone buzzed, catching both their attention. Dean smiled dopily at whatever was on his screen. “What is it?” Castiel asked.
After they finished eating, they cleaned up. It was a very similar position they had been in days ago when this entire thing had started, except Dean was drying and putting away the dishes because he was the one who knew where things went. He would have to give his boyfriend a tour.
Something alike to disgust darkened Dean’s features. “Dude, if you want me to do a paper or something just ask.” Dean rolled his eyes as if this was a daily occurrence.
Bobby had already known there was someone. That had been no problem, but then Dad noticed there was something different about Dean. John Winchester who didn’t pay Dean any attention unless he was doing something wrong or it was directly related to hunting. Even Emma had noticed something different about her father.
Dean nodded and sat down a safe distance away from Castiel. It hurt, but it was warranted.
Soon, Emma’s breathing evened out. Sam could also feel sleep tugging at the corners of his mind.
Dean squeeze his eyes shut tightly before continuing. “It-he got so close. If I hadn’t had my knife on me…anyway.” Dean shook his head. “I got away, ran all the way home while trying to tug my pants back up.”
They left the fancy restaurant they had enjoyed their two year anniversary dinner at. Dean lead them through a field and a small patch of trees. When they stop, they’re winded and smiling brightly.
“We’re getting you checked out.” Dean cut Sam a sharp look. The fear of almost loosing his brother was still swimming inside of him, that and the adrenaline, Dean was practically a live wire still.
His daughter pouted before scarfing down the last of her apple slices and potato chips. Her cheeks puffed out like a chipmunk. “Done.” She said, muffled by her mouth full of food.
“Shall we move to phase two of your plan?” Cas asked, teasingly rubbing Dean’s growling stomach.
Cas looked out at the field, the wind tangled its fingers through his dark hair in a way that made Dean almost jealous. He swallowed the nausea that was creeping up his throat. He took a deep breath.
“Get some punch?” Dean shrugged.
The next day Castiel woke up around noon and couldn’t stand laying in bed any longer. He got a sandwich from the kitchen and took his bee book to the field a few blocks from his house. He spent the day reading and dozing in the field. Despite the sunshine and blue sky, Castiel’s mind was dark and stormy.
The door slammed behind them. The old house shook in protest. Dean didn’t care. Cas’ eyes were blazing and jaw was tight. Dean most likely looked very similar.
“Cas?” Dean wasn’t sure where to begin looking for his boyfriend in the mansion.
“Yeah, E, lying, or even just not telling someone something they should know isn’t good. It always ends badly.” Sam smiled apologetically.
“It was excruciating.” Cas’ leaned down, his lips brushing Dean’s with each word.
Dean rolled his eyes, as tradition required, and handed his encased arm to his little brother. Sam leaned down so his long hair dropped down covering whatever he was doing. He tried to bat at his brother, trying to get a look at what he was doing. Sam batted back at him.
“Prom.” Castiel bit out, watching Gabriel knot the tie. It looked so easy.
Dean woke to soft kisses on his face. This was how he woke up most mornings. Well, they weren’t really mornings and he didn’t really need to sleep. The nice thing about heaven was he could do as he wished, and he wished to catch up on all the sleep he missed as well as wake up next to Cas.
“No way, you made half this mess.”
A clatter came from the kitchen and Dean stiffened. Then the sound of Sam’s cursing came muffled through the door and he relaxed.
“Was that good for you?” Cas asked after a few beats of silence.
“Wait till you have the pie.”
Sam went upstairs to shower, something of his after work routine. Dean had complained that his brother didn’t need to shower because he had just sat in an office all day. Sam had muttered about how at least he showered unlike his brother.
“And we’re going to have dinners at least once a week, and we’re still going to work together, and Cas is gone at the office for most of the day so I’ll probably be here a whole lot. You’ll be so sick of me, you’ll be begging me to leave.”
“I mean it was dark, but I thought that was from being down there for so long. I thought it’d go away and heaven would heal it.”
“Dean wants to go.” Castiel shrugged.
“I know, De.” Sam rested his arm on Dean’s chest, his hand pressing over his heart to feel it beat through his t-shirt. “This isn’t like that. You’re moving less than twenty minutes away with a guy who loves you.”
“No.” Cas’ thumb traced Dean’s swollen lips. “Are you ready for our date?”
“We can have a different discussion instead.” Cas’ eyebrow arched questioningly.
Roughly, Cas yanked Dean to his feet and leaned him over the desk. A firm swat was given to his ass before his jeans and boxers are being pulled down to pool at his feet. A moan rumbled from Dean’s throat and oh, shit yes, he had found the perfect cure for boredom.
After explaining that Dean hadn’t meant calling Castiel a dumbass as an insult the man agreed to meet Dean at a bar after they had showered at their own respective motel rooms.
The next day Dean had told Emma he was dating someone who made him very happy. That however did not mean that he would ever leave Emma alone because of it. Nor was Dean’s special friend ever going to hurt Emma. It also didn’t mean that Dean’s friend was hurting him. It made Dean have to go to the yard and smash somethings as his daughter’s mother was not within a crowbar’s swing.
They got in the impala and Dean put as much distance as he could between them and the ghost town along with all that could have been.
“Lot a things, a psychiatrist would have field day.” Sam shrugged. “So how was your date?”
At some point he became more subtle with his revenge. Anyone who even looked at him creepily magically ended up poisoned or in big trouble for having bomb pieces under their mattress. After that most of the guys left him alone.
“Dean, are you alright?” Cas asked as they got in the car. “You seemed tense these past few days.”
“I love you, too.” Cas said and Dean’s heart stopped.
Dean was such a screw up, his brother was missing, his daughter was out playing by herself and not complaining like the perfect kid because he had to spend the next however long looking for his brother. And Dean was just sitting there reading book after book that just-
“Maybe something quieter?” Cas began putting his own equipment away. “And I could pay?”
“I, I didn’t think we’d be up here so sorry ab, about the mess.” Dean’s face was the same shade of a fire truck.
“Do you know me at a-“ Dean’s retort was cut off by a tongue to his ass.
“I saw you pull in, and just had to say hello.” Stephanie flourished her long, incredibly fake fingernails. “We really should get the girls together. They had so much fun together last year.”
“You’re going to miss your test.” Dean said gruffly.
“I don’t blame you, sweetheart.”
There were some groups that could mix, like band and theater geeks, or jocks and the popular girls. Others could not, for example nerds and punk bad boys.
“A…a date?” Dean sputtered. “Like diner where two people like each other? Romantically? Like a romantic date?”
“M’kay.”
For once in a long while, Dean wasn’t the one comforting. He was being comforted. Unlike when his mom was alive he didn’t feel like he was looming over her. Dean felt three years old again, being wrapped in his mom’s arms because he just scrapped his knee on the playground.
“What about you?”
“Nah, my mom already offered. You’re not getting out of this house without whatever she cooked up. Sorry in advance, she’s not a good cook. Hopefully Dad got home in time to fix it and make it at least a little edible.”
“Yes.” Sarah sounded in need of a vacation. “You will need to come pick her up and talk to Principal Charles about the consequences.”
Dean cranked the radio and allowed AC/DC to blast in the car. Better these songs than whatever shit his head was trying to conjure up. The impala followed the twisting backroads. Dean had no real desire to get home quickly. The noise was soothing and he’d have to be quiet when he got home since Sam was sleeping, you know, like most sane and insane people.
“See ya.” One last kiss and Cas was gone.
“I know how step parents work.” Emma grouched with an eye roll. She seemed a little offended. “I’ve known you almost as long as long as I was with my mom. If she gets a to be Mom you shouldn’t have to be just Cas.”
Dean was fucking swaggering down the halls of the office building. He had a pep in his step and a cock sure smile on his face. He had been wearing the bright aura around him all day. Sam’s first words to him that morning were “eew”.
With a sigh Dean settled back into the uncomfortable bed. He prepared himself for a long wait. The hit man had never been a patient man. Pretty soon he was going to start bugging his brother.
The view from the top is amazing. The city lights of Sioux Falls shimmer beneath them and the stars dance above them. It was actually pretty romantic if Dean ignored the used condom a few feet away from them.
The insecure look was mostly gone from Cas eyes so Dean deemed it safe to curl back up. He placed a kiss to Cas’ neck where his face was burrowed. Dean slung a leg over Cas’ and began dozing in and out in the afterglow.
“I do not!”
He slept better on his stomach anyway, so strategically, Dean slowly rolled on to his stomach trying desperately not to disturb his slumbering boyfriend. When he successfully achieved his new position he threw a leg over Cas’ and snuggled into the mattress.
“Do too!”
“Think you’re ready for that big test?” Dean asked, closing his textbook.
A car honked and Dean pulled on his boots. He locked the door behind him and saw that the car sitting outside was a black SUV with borderline illegally tinted windows. There was a driver with aviators and an earpiece who got out and opened the back door for Dean. Rolling his eyes, Dean got in the car and took in the eyeful that was Castiel Novak in his usual three piece suit.
“I always knew you had to have a perfectly sound reason for stabbing someone in the eye.” Dean’s smile turned from teasing to soft.
“Hey.” Sam smiled back. “Uh, which one is your kid?”
Dean cracked open an eye and saw blue ones staring back at him. A soft smile was on the angel’s face and Dean knew there was a similar one on his own. He leaned in to kissed Cas properly once.
“Dean, I-“
“Funny seeing you here.” Dean drawled.
There was silence for a long while. Dean almost thought Sam had fallen asleep. Then he spoke again. “I told you this job was a good idea.”
So they watched “Lilo and Stitch”. Emma curled up against the arm of the couch with a fluffy blanket. Sam sat on the other end, his long legs stretched out on the coffee table. A bowl of buttered popcorn sat between them. They both tried their hand at throwing popcorn into the air and catching it in their mouths. Both ended up failing miserably and having to pick up their mess.
Sam sighed. He held the gun in the air, released the clip and dropped it. Dean did the same.
“Go get him, beloved. Bring him home.” They both knew who the empty plot of land next to their’s belonged to. Eileen was already there.
“It’s lunch.” Dean shrugged. “Figured I try and find you.”
“You come here enough to have a “usual”?” Cas asked, flexing his fingers in quotations.
“Probably should.” Dean let out a pathetic wet half laugh.
“You know I’m not, ass.” Dean lifted his head up so he could kiss Cas. “But I don’t need another lecture on safe sex, making good choices, or anything else.”
Castiel’s eyes sharpened and the temperature in the room dropped thirty degrees. “Watch your tone, Mr. Winchester.”
His locker door was slammed shut for him. Castiel jumped and saw an angry red head glaring at him. It was like something straight out of one of his nightmares.
He wasn’t going to lose this. He wasn’t going to lose anything. He was just going to gain a few things, like a higher chance at more morning sex.
“I can do it myself.”
“If you’re in this office for bullying again, Axel, I’ll take it for two months.” She turned her frown line to the mother. “I suggest you be more careful what you say around your child, especially about other people. You two are dismissed.”
He heard Cas grumble, but decided to clean up his mess instead of try to hear what his boyfriend said about his lack of cooking skills.
“Uncle Sammy swore!” Emm yelled from her room.
Castiel was still dazed as Dean pulled away. He was able to notice the glasses were perched crookedly on that freckled nose. Castiel tightened them with a smile and kissed him again. Dean’s face was painted a deep pink and he headed headed back inside.
“Excuse me?” Cas seemed confused not angry, yet.
Gabriel finished with Castiel’s tie and began straightening the jacket out. “I like him.”
“I also carry no diseases, but I thought it would make you feel more comfortable.”
Thankfully the principal stepped in otherwise Sam may have been arrested for murder. “Stop it. You two are both grown adults, so act like it.” Her voice was cold and left no room for arguing. Emma next to him stiffened and her breathing hitched. Sam decided to wrap it up.
Cas’ smile turned wicked and he tugged Dean by the hand out the door. He called to Meg to cancel his appointments on their way out. Dean just laugh and followed his boyfriend out into the city.
“Cas, guess what?” Dean asked teasingly, recovering from his former disappointment. He was going to get so much better than some French kissing, not that making out with the badass mob boss was terrible by an means. Honestly Dean had had full on home runs that hadn’t made him as happy as first base with Cas.
“Alright.”  Crowley’s eye twitched. A small twinge of satisfaction twisted in Dean knowing he was the one making the leader of one of the most notorious mob groups in the United States uneasy.
One night Dean woke up screaming and covered in sweat. Some jerk yelled at him to shut up. Dean didn’t pay him any attention. The older Winchester was trying too hard to catch his breath and remember where he was. Still in the cage.
“It was a shark, babe!” Dean called back, offended. “Anyway, what’s up?”
Cas crawled on to him and sealed their lips together. Dean’s hands came up to wind his fingers into those wild dark locks. Their naked cocks rubbed together causing Dean’s entire nervous system to look like a fucking Fourth of July fireworks display.
“Hey, Dean?” Dean rolled his eyes and grunted at Sam. His brother continued, sadly. “Be careful-“
“Yeah?” Emma beamed. “Papa, what are we having for supper tonight?”
“You okay, dude?” Dean asked, almost dreading the answer, they were in the clear right?
Sam had an hour or so before lunch so the break room was quiet. That was until his phone began to ring. Sam didn’t recognize the number but that didn’t mean anything so he answered it anyway.
“Stephanie.” Dean grumbled. Cas made an odd choking sound that made Dean smile. Cas hated these sort of events almost as much as Dean did.
Cas hesitated before kissing Dean softly. Then he disappeared out the door. The toaster popped up, startling Dean and breaking the mood. It was charred and inedible, but Dean just smiled and put in another one.
“Papa.” Castiel tasted the word on his tongue. It felt strange, like a home you didn’t quite recognize, but it was still home. “I think that’s the one.”
“Uh, I-I really don’t know.”
“Are you sure?” Dean leaned across Cas’ desk with a smirk. “Don’t want to bend me over your desk like a…what were your words, oh yeah, common whore?”
Cas didn’t respond instead the phone rang. Only after shooting Dean a pointed look did the mob boss pick up the phone. Angry Spanish soon filled the room.
“I am going to need your help with something.”
He can’t imagine spending his life with anyone else. He wants to drive with Dean forever. He’ll spent every moment with him. They’ve been through so much over the years. He wants to spent a thousand more years with the man.
“Yeah.” Dean breathed out as Cas’ breath ghosted over his erection.
“What’d you say?”
“I know, but that doesn’t make you stupid.”
“Okay.” Sam prayed she wasn’t about to ask where babies came from.
“I wasn’t aware.” Cas said closing his eyes. When he opened them they were still icy with anger. “I’ve prayed to Jack, he’ll be here shortly to explain.”
“Huh, how to the hoops not get stuck in your hair?”
“Cas!” Dean gasped out as his boyfriend wrapped their cocks together in his hand.
“Why would you pay?” Dean snorted. “I can pay my own.”
“Dean?” Cas was looking at him. Blue eyes full of worry.
“Sickos.” Dean usually didn’t feel comfortable about killing woman. Call him sexist or whatever it just didn’t sit well with him. This Viper chick was found guilty on multiple accounts of murder, sexual assault, and rape. Some of those cases had been with minors. With that in mind, go gender equality! Every bitch and dick bag alike gets to die painfully.
“But this is two weeks. There’s school and soccer and-“ Dean took a breath. “Maybe I shouldn’t go.”
Cas and Dean fought like a team. Dean hadn’t been such a team with anyone other than Sam. The first man tried to yank Dean into a headlock, but he ducked away and slammed his knee into the man’s stomach. Then he took out his knife and stabbed him in the neck.
“Please, I once made mac n cheese in a motel room covered in more blood and guts then the mold.” His stomach growled at the memory of the pasta.
“Then what should we talk about?” Cas rolled his eyes, clearly exasperated.
“Good. It felt weird at first but now it’s good.” Dean groaned as Castiel ran his thumbnail over his slit of his cock. “You can add another one.”
Then the red head was stomping off, muttering about how this was why she didn’t date boys. Castiel stood in the middle of the crowded halls dumbly clutching the over sized tickets.
Dean did not remember owning so much shit. He had lived out most of his life with all of his belongings more or less in a single duffel bag, so he didn’t think packing up his stuff would take so long, or take so many boxes.
“I’m not going back to Stanford.” Sam said with a certainty that put an uneasy hope in Dean’s stomach.
“She attacked me.” Cas must have read something on Dean’s face as he clarified. “I had been altering her orders and she called me into her office and went to stab me. Honestly, I don’t know why she didn’t just shoot me or something. Anyway, I didn’t just walk in and stab her in the eye, regardless what the rumors are saying.”
“There were rumors you and Sam were working for me.” Cas explained, his eyes flickered to Dean’s. “I needed to put those rumors to rest, and Crowley was getting pushy. He needed to be reminded that I had superior resources.”
“Well, we aren’t interested.” Dean snapped.
“You mean too crazy.” Dean snorted.
Dean was methodically rolling out the dough and adjusting himself occasionally because his erection gave him the finger  whenever he tried to conjure unsexy images. Even the memory of unclogging the shower drain with a slimy hair ball of Sam’s luscious locks couldn’t deter his raging hard on.
The sound of clicking heels came from the doorway. “I would be more worried about yourself, Castiel.”
“I don’t want sweet potato.” Emma grumbled, but took a seat.
“Schools, just not for me.” Castiel scooted over to Dean. Something realigned itself inside of Castiel as Dean leaned into him. He put an arm around the nerd’s shoulders and pulled him even closer.
The mob boss wasted no time in shedding his trench coat and shoes before wrapping himself around Dean.
“Of course.”
“Yes, that was the plan.” Cas said.
“Papa, what’re you reading?”
Dean wiggled into a comfortable position on the couch and rested his head on top of his brother’s.
“Right, of course.” Sam began gathering his stuff that consisted of a folder, the calculator, his car keys, and the phone in his hand. “I’ll be right there.”
Without prompt his boyfriend reached over to the bedside drawer for the wet wipes. Cas cleaned them both up before balling up the wipe and tossing it aimlessly to the floor. Dean sighed contently and snuggled impossibly closer. This was the afterglow he had been missing last time. It was warm and love and sunshine in a bottle. Dean didn’t even care if he was waxing poetry again.
“Cas.” Dean breathed out. There his angel was, standing next to Baby. He still wore his trench coat and suit.
“You must be Emma’s uncle.” Principal Chuck who looked like Snow White if she was a stressed out school principal. Her dark hair, streaked somehow elegantly with grey, was pulled up into a all business looking bun that had a few strands escaping. She also seemed to have a permanent indent in her forehead from frowning. Presently her frown was traded in for a friendly smile.
“I love you too.” Dean pulled Cas in for a kiss.
“Huh.” Was all Castiel said. Dean shoved his glasses further up his nose. The silence stretched. “You want to sit?”
“Okay, rugrat.” Dean knelt down to Emma’s eye level. “Be good, use your manners.”
They sat down and dug into the pizza. It was perfectly too greasy and reminded Dean of cramped motel rooms sharing a last minutes dinner with Dad and Sam. Cas dabbed at the excess grease with a paper towel before digging in. What a dork.
“Nature can leave a voicemail.”
The house was quiet. Well, relatively quiet, Beefy was sobbing in the corner. Cas quickly crossed the room and punched the man in the head until he went limp. Dean was only mostly sure the guy was still alive.
“I see.” Cas finished tapping the gauze to Dean’s shoulder.
“Come on, Cas. You can’t bench me.” The icy look told Dean the mob boss could and would. Dean decided he would fight this battle another day, maybe when he wasn’t laying practically naked in a hospital room with heavy pain killers in his system.
Sam visibly shuddered. “Yeah, but your guy already has a violent reputation.”
Dean followed the instructions and found Cas in a bathroom. It was a very nice bathroom with bright stone counter tops and a dark granite shower, and it was more or less covered in pink.
“Like you’re any better!”
“I know, just give me some time.” Roughly ten minutes to be specific.
Bobby had told him that whoever was making Dean smile like he won the lotto had better not hurt him. Then it hit Dean  on a random weekday night while having dinner with Bobby and Emma as they usually did. He really liked where this was going with Cas, but before things got any further Dean had to be straight with him. So Dean texted Cas to see if he was near South Dakota and if they could meet up-he had yet to tell Cas exactly where he lived.
“Yes, how terrible that would be for you.” Castiel drawled out. “Your stupid boyfriend can’t make out with you because he’s stuck at summer school.”
“Can we go now?” Dean asked. He picked at his hospital gown. He really hated hospitals.
“Cas has a strong opinion on everything.”
The drive home was full of wandering hands, gasps, and groans. Dean was a little surprised he didn’t get pulled over in all honesty. He was having a difficult time keeping the impala straight. In his defense, he wasn’t.
“‘Cause you tell people things when you’re in a relationship with them.” Dean shrugged. “I’m afraid of planes.”
Cas and Dean shared a look Sam chose to ignore. “I’ll be up stairs in a bit, honey.” Dean kissed Cas’ cheek and the dark haired man went upstairs while Dean leaned across the counter opposite of Sam.
At some point Dean felt an urge to turn. He couldn’t tell you why, he just had a gut feeling. The next road lead them to a open field.  Dean got out and parked.
“That’s dangerous.” Dean poked Sam’s ribs.
“Cas, more, please.” Dean whined. Yes, he whined, he wasn’t ashamed to admit it, not with the hot mob boss’ tongue in his ass.
Dean, against popular belief, was only human, so he really couldn’t be judged by the whimper that escaped him. He rolled his hips upwards in an attempt to get some friction. Cas closed the little distance between their lips and his tongue curled  into Dean’s mouth.
Castiel decided he didn’t want to get into the fact that Emma could call her mother by her first name and there was nothing wrong with him being “just Cas”.
“Sorry, I choose life.” Castiel leaned down and kissed Dean chastely. Then he grabbed his boyfriend’s Han Solo boxers and tosed them in his face.
“Of course.” Cas nodded, seriously.
“I’d like that.” Cas’ smile turned soft.
“Done.” Sam walked over to the other side of the room.
“You may have sold your soul to save me, but that doesn’t make up for all the missed calls, and the bruises and broken bones you gave me. It doesn’t make up for the way Sammy and I grew up, it doesn’t make up for any of it. You were a crazy, obsessive bastard. Giving your soul to hell just got you there faster.”
“Right, cause that worked when we were that age.” Sam rolled his eyes and smiled.
“You won’t have to.” Cas promised into Dean’s hair.
In a fluid motion, Cas rolled on top of Dean. The mob boss’ body weight was pinning Dean down in a delicious sort of way. His boyfriend made quick work of Dean’s shirt and began assaulting his neck and chest with his tongue, teeth, and lips.
“Carrots are orange and you like carrots.” Sam pointed out, scraping his own plate clean.
“Thank you, Dean.”
“Are you home?”
“Home?” Cas did his confused face. “But I thought-“
“Ah, ask away.”
“That car of yours running fine?”
Castiel offered Dean his arm after they had gotten out of the car. Dean’s eyes widened behind his glasses when they walked into the sparkly school. It did look pretty cool, especially considering most of the decorations were from just about every other school dance.
“Okay, I’ll call back at the usual time.” Dean sighed out. “Thanks, Sammy. Tell Emma I -we- love her.”
“I know.” Charlie smirked, giddy. “You should have seen Stevie’s face when she got here. I wish I could have done the whole walk down the stair case thing but I get here and make sure the idiots didn’t mess anything up. You both clean up well, by the way.”
They arrived at the high school. Lights and music were pouring out from inside. The parking lot was crowded with even some limos parked in the back. Anxiety began eating at Castiel’s stomach. He wished he could have had a cigarette on the way here but Dean refused to let cigarette smoke “stink up his Baby”.
Sam sighed. “Just thinking.”
“We got plans of our own.” Dean smiled at Cas. “Another time.”
“What’s the surprise?” Dean managed to gasp out when they did that stupid thing called breathing.
“Oh my- shove off, jerk.” Sam pinched the skin on Dean’s chest earning a yelp from the older Winchester.
“Hmm.” Cas’ eyes narrowed and he ducked forward and captured Dean in a bruising kiss. When he pulled away it was only a margin, his lips still brushing Dean’s. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Dean.”
he repeate, the coward, it was impossible for him to say the words.
“Hey. I never said it annoyed me, you know I don't bother you staring at me at all. Keep it going, I'm enjoying it, it's a satisfying feeling.” He commented in a soft and complained manner when he noticed my eyes were stuck upon the small, old menu booklet. I had never been in this restaurant before. It was my first time, unlike Dean who seemed to be pretty acquainted with that place.
He's so lost on him that he is just reluctant to find the way back and neglects his pain, as his love for Dean is greater than any kind of pain and sorrow he could ever feel. His attraction towards him is greater than the fear- and he just wished to be forever lost in his vast, dense woods, just like the latter is lost in the former's oceans. Dean, on his part, is lost in Castiel's coastlines. Losing themselves on each other, without a trace of fear of not being able to find the way back, for love is a one-way journey, there is no coming back.
He smiled hearing Dean's words.
overwork yourself...’’ The tall middle-aged man stated and gave Dean a rigid look.
beyond.
He denied every feeling and shoved it deep inside his soul. Until now, that these eyes don't exist anymore, they don't shine anymore. He started appreciating his love for Cas now that his love is lost.
His love...
Another story about
Furthermore, oh my Lord, that poor
And he stayed there, all night, crying and crying for his love, he was yelling his name, he was begging God- Chuck to bring Cas back. Back to him. He was begging for everything, he was -
They live a long-lasting life, hence the saying happily ever after.
‘’You're going to come back to me,
‘’Here… I'm waiting for the ship to arrive... I need to speak to the captain.’’ He answered and shoved his hands in his pockets.
‘’Don't forget to send letters
He suddenly stopped dead in his tracks... alone in the void. A strong freezing air started bushing against our bodies He didn't make the move to come back. Not one. He won't even turn his eyes to my place.
Maybe he didn't have the courage. “I'm sorry.” I said as I turned my gaze to him with sympathy. He nodded his head in a negative manner before grinning ironically.
I will not be in pain. I will be in peace.
Of course, I stopped him, “A cup of chamomile please.”
Harmony again. The sea is only a few miles away from here, at the end of the forest you will just see a barren and dead land - which resurrect only in spring, with beautiful flowers, bees roaming here and there like butterflies - then if you approach the end you will see a cliff, and a lower sea. Infinite tons of salt water.
He never uttered those words, maybe because he lacks courage, maybe Dean would think that Cas is out of control. He is... he just let these words wander through the forests of his mind, he let them vanish beyond the horizon.
We were born to fall in love, and we lived our lives to meet each other, and I'm happy that I met you, my sweet love of mine.
‘’You love me...?’’ He asked in a whisper and fixed his gaze on him. They
He was
do without me?’’ He paised to take a deep breath.
He misses him, he misses him so much and he may never stop doing so. He has gotten used to his presence on a daily basis and waking up next to him sometimes. He misses his face, his lips, his kisses, his hands, his eyes and laugh. He misses him, a lot. It was the  last image he would see before closing his eyes some nights. He misses the feeling of waking up suddenly during the night and noticing him sleeping peacefully on his side, he misses having him in his arms after a nightmare. He misses... him. Just him.
Until they twitched to the sound of the town's bell. Their breaths were incoherent and they felt an underlying fear.
o helpless and lonely and- and-’’ he started saying as Amelia was taking care of his burns.
‘’I'm-’’
Besides he had said the same thing years ago. Dean was like phantoms for him. Which we should fear and stay away from. But he did the exactly opposite thing. He followed him. He loved him.
“Do you know what is a soulmate?” She asked and sat on the edge of the bed.
behind.
he started increasing his volume as he went on with his sentence.
He wasn't sure whether what his was about to do was right or wrong, he was exhausted and wanted to go back to his bed, but he believed Dean needed him more.
Dean had mentioned in one of his letters that when he was at the war he wanted to spend most of his time there. He had wanted to teach Sam fishing for years, since when his father first sent him away, not to mention that had he not gone to war, he would have learned how to navigate a whole ship, not just a boat. He was exhausted, he could tell, his eyelids seemed heavy and his eyes almost closed, not due to the sun.
The place is too crowded, travellers waiting for the ship to board and explore new regions, or people expecting their loved ones to come back. The ship is to arrive at 5pm, it is quarter to 5. The only thing he is doing is watch the waves of the sea, these alluring waves which he sometimes wishes drowned him and made him one with the shipwrecks that just lie on the seabed, forever. And they're slowly dying there and still reminisce. They reminisce the world they used to be in, they still do. They're mourning the lost. And as Castiel was thinking how he wanted ti be a shipwreck he averted his gaze and started catching glimpses of passersby.
We both...
He desperately needed to confirm that Dean felt the same way. He moved his gaze slowly on him. Tears had creeped their way into Dean's eyes as well. They were keeping company to Cas' tears.
Without a doubt.
Every gaze,
‘’I'm not leaving you
Why? Can you answer me, please? Tell so that I become aware, why does his heart break in million pieces and this loser is not able to pick them up? Why is he impotent and out of courage for one more attempt? Why does he have to cry his soul out and suffer so much?
“What do you mea-” I wasn't given the chance to finish my sentence.
“You think I have something to tell you?”
you and you know it.’’ He held back a sob.
with would keep their love safe. It's the little things in life that matter.
‘’I can't believe it…’’ She movingly uttered placing her hands on her belly. She was so ecstatic that she was trembling.
How could he break him? With what audacity?
Cas forgot about all their problems when Dean's soft lips left a kiss on his forehead. ‘’It's not a goodbye stupid, well see each other soon.’’
.’’ Amelia said to get even.
But death moved them apart.
’’ Dean stopped abruptly once again, but this time he didn't connect their lips. He didn't went on touching him. He wasn't able to gain the courage to continue. He just stared at him, his eyes glowing.
So many tears for a lost angel. So many tears for a lost person.
‘’Fine... fine, I'll do my best.’’ These were his last words before he started carrying himself to the bathroom, unable to walk fast. He was tired, so many nights wakeful, waiting for Dean until dusk. He was exhausted to a high extent but he kept living. He may have sounded angry or cold, more than he meant to do so. But his mind was blurred. And he knows it's
. Something is always occupying him, there's always
Castiel smiled as he brought his small glass of whiskey to his lips for another sip, the spicy drink slipping through his insides causing his body to shiver. That's when he felt a mild pain in his chest, as much as he didn't like it, drinking was a way to forget, to quench his pain. After he had met him, he started drinking more than he used to and smoking as well. He's crossing the same path of self-destruction due to his unwillingness to stay away from him.
‘’Everything's cool. I talked to Jessica today, will it be okay if she comes to your wedding?’’ He asked quickly.
He is alone.
I stopped him. “It scares you, right?” He nodded before we heard Mary calling his name from downstairs.
...’’ he said timidly. ‘’I can't imagine how my life would be without it, you know... even if I'm not a very good swimmer.’’ He added.
We used to be two very different personalities · but my dear, the truth is we were one. We were always one. For the very first moment. And we still are one.
Back to me.
‘’Watch out for yourself"’’ They shared a bitter smile. They didn't want to say goodbye, not so soon. Goodbyes hurt,
He feels. And that's the truth. But, of
‘’Of course I do.
Dean Winchester.
I hope that- Perhaps, some day, far away from now, they will gain the courage and ultimately- they will shout
I still remember the day I met Dean Winchester. I fell in love with him immediately, at first glance. I still remember his magnificent green eyes, his beautiful smooth lips. I remember how I froze when I saw him, I lost everything · and I found my everything. I didn't care anymore for the world. Since my world was him.
‘’I'm not your brother.’’ He stated, at first Dean was about to talk but he just turned his head to meet his gaze. His eyes were puffy and they were closing without his will but the fear kept him from falling asleep. His hair was a mess.
But he had to be
I have no clue fucking what changed... This place is scaring me, I feel like my worst nightmares are lurking there for me, awaiting the right time to pop out. This place seems unfamiliar. I no longer acknowledge this room, the excitement which used to meet me here is absent.
Even if a century passed, their loving gaze would remain.
“Mr. Winchester” I called him, but he didn't seem to bother.
His soul is far more different than the others. Wounded, with lots of secrets. I wish I could know about these secrets and heal those wounds. Protect it from potential perils and threats. I have no clue why I have these thoughts about him, why I distinguished him and think he is unique, why he's been the only person in my mind for the last hours, why I'm under the impression that he is not like other people I know. I hope my thoughts are right.
we are one, my love.”
‘’Can I have kids with Jessica?’’ Mary looked over Sam in a strict manner.
Once more, our faces were dangerously close. Our lips were virtually touching and I able to smell the cigarette, the alcohol, the odor of the rain on him. Our gazes were locked. Raindrops slipped from my face and hair on him. Our eyes didn't move an inch. Besides, he said that to me.
“Was it that funny? Shall I do this more often?” He asked me and locked his gaze on me.
The only thing he's doing tonight is remember. Remember the memories of their lovely time. That night when no one was in the small, white home, a wedding had taken place earlier as far as he recalls. But whatever it might have been, it was a chance for them to get closer. Become one. Him and Dean decided to leave earlier. Dean's fiancé couldn't keep her hands and eyes away from him. Cas knew that would be the last night before Dean got married.
“I'm going to pick up Dean. I don't think there are any taxi cars driving around currently.” John processed my words.
They were one.
“I-I just want to tell you... Remember, don't— don't ask Dean to tell you what happened, o— okay? And... Yes, I know you already know everything but...But.... You know, he is my brother and— ”
. About how much I want you, completely. Every inch of yours on me.
The next minutes flowed rather quickly, Cas didn't get to grasp when he left with Amelia to head to the town and when the reached the doctor's. He took ahold of Amelia's hand as they were waiting for the results to come out. His heartbeat sped up, he was nervous. And he didn't know what he wanted exactly, Amelia gave him a happy smile when they exited the office.
''What are you writing about?'' He asked taking his hand and caressing it, he hadn't stopped with the intense kissing yet, a sigh escaped from his lips as he moved his hand more and more downwards. He closed his eyes as Castiel rested his head on Dean's chest, just enjoying him...
course Cas knows. He always knew.
Their moment. Their final moment together.
His heavy breath against his flesh sent shivers down his spine. ''No... poetry- or whatever is what I'm writing-should remain private sometimes.'' Cas kept his gaze on him, same with the latter.
He was given a lot of chances, more than anyone else.
‘’But you'll know soon.
Besides, he promised him he wouldn't go away. But the fear of losing Dean is still following Cas. Not just because he will move or get married... he is afraid of losing him permanently. He can't imagine his life if his lover leaves. Sometimes he prays he won't have to experience this but leave first to avoid the pain. But then he reconsiders because of the pain Dean will have to deal with.
‘’Oh my God- Cas, congratulations! Really, congratulations. I hope everything goes well
“You have your mum who adores you, your brother Sam, your dad who...and your wife-”
“Yeah...Maybe... of course and this happened my fallen angel...” I said while kissing him again and again. A vicious cycle of lustful kisses that I wish will never break.
“I began looking at you differently after that. A new light or whatever,” Dean continues, swallowing past the lump that formed in his throat. “You just— I didn’t even understand it then. I never really felt anything like it for
“You know, I almost cracked once.” Dean huffs at the memory, mirthless and melancholy. “At the crypt when Naomi ordered you to kill me, I wanted to tell you then. It didn’t even matter that so much shit was happening. I just wanted to tell you how I felt; I wanted to tell you that I love you and ask you to come back to me and
“Did you know that I kept dreaming about you walking into the water after? I did. Nightmare after fucking nightmare reminding me that I couldn’t save you. Story of my life, y’know? It’s the reason why I couldn’t give up on you in Purgatory. I
back then, and even if you were, I didn’t know whether you would’ve understood it the way I meant it. I didn’t think— You already never stayed for long, I didn’t want to give you a reason to never come at all."
“I almost didn’t believe it when you came back. You were standing there, saying ‘Hello, Dean’ like you haven’t just come back from the dead again. Like it was just a normal Thursday and you’re just dropping by to say hello. But then— Well, things that make me happy usually came at a price so I shouldn’t have been surprised when I found out that something was wrong.”
But Dean feels cracked open, his heavily guarded walls toppling down to strip bare his soul, unable to keep himself from spilling everywhere. Then again, it’s not like he’s strong enough to keep himself together right now anyway.
for help first. Because you didn’t
He tries to get his shit together; at least for a little while, at least until he can hide in his room and have it all out with himself before Sam comes back from his own isolation and sees his mess of a big brother. Fuck, does he try. But he’s tired, bone-deep and almost crippling in its intensity. He barely has enough energy to keep himself from sliding down his chair and sprawling on the fucking floor.
Dean can feel the words choking him, all of them lining up in his throat waiting to be said out loud. He struggles through them, not knowing what to say first anymore ‘cause it’s just the same shit over and over again through the years. Different scenario, same conclusion.
— and not to mention the drinking problem and violent streak. There’s plenty of things wrong with him. If he were to look at it on paper, all his traits listed down, that shit would scare him too, send him packing and running for the hills or whatever.
Dean opens his eyes and palms his face, rubbing at his jaw as if he could still feel the bruises Castiel healed years ago. “Intimidating. Yeah, that’s it. That’s how I’d describe you. You were so intimidating before, y’know? All whirlwind and self-assured and intense. But then— Then you came up to me and said that you were beginning to feel things for the very first time.”
again. You chose to let me have the life you thought I deserved and wanted. A quiet apple-pie life with Lisa and Ben and— Fuck— I— You love me too much, Cas. Too much.”
“I mean— Well, you were just an angel then, like a full angel that didn’t question his orders. So rigid and imposing. God, I can’t believe I was so scared of you back then. But not like— Not like scared you’d hurt me or something like that. And well, you eventually did beat me up—” Dean pauses, closing his eyes, his mind immediately supplying images of being pressed against a brick wall with a bloody face, begging, unrepentantly savoring Castiel's warm breath as it fans across his face. “Not like I didn’t deserve it. I did. And you patched me up after, anyway.”
Anyway, that wasn’t the point. The point is, he didn’t even know Cas
him. That type of love doesn’t end just 'cause the person doing the loving is gone. The love is still there, ever-present and encompassing. Dean can feel it with every breath he takes, feel it simmering underneath his skin. —
“I was being a pain in the ass. As I always am to you, I guess. We were sitting at a park and a seal just got broken. Remember that? I was feeling down ‘cause we couldn’t stop it and then you just started talking and— And you sounded so unsure and lost, not at all like how I knew you... You told me you were beginning to experience doubt. Your face was creased and it looked like it pained you to tell me that, to tell me that your faith isn’t as solid as you thought it’d be. To confess this— This secret you thought you weren't allowed to have, I guess.”
It should make him angry, but most of all it just makes him sad. Devastated. Gutted. For the things and the person that he would never be able to know or feel or experience differently. It’s like everything that he’s been trying to bury ever since Cas got taken decided to come out all at once. Feelings that demanded to be felt and thoughts that refused to be repressed, it’s all drowning him now.
What Dean is, in his most basic form, is a flawed man. Definitely more so than others. He’s got anger issues, daddy and mommy issues that not even a lifetime of therapy can successfully unpack. He has an extremely unhealthy codependent relationship with his brother, has got a fear of intimacy and abandonment that he’s got walls set up like it’s fucking Fort Knox—
Dean doesn't believe in much anymore, but fuck if he doesn't believe in this. With everything that had happened, everything that Cas had done and sacrificed, there's hardly any room for doubt. If that was how Cas saw him, how Cas believed him to be, then Dean will try to believe in it too. He’s gonna try to
It’s easier now to let the tears fall, Dean doesn’t even attempt to wipe them away. It’s the fifth time he’s cried tonight anyway, he’s getting the hang of it. He’s all snot-faced and blotchy and uncaring.
And as much as he tries to see himself the way Cas saw him, —
I hurt Jack. I even hurt Sammy. So I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I'm gonna try to be better. I promise, Cas. M'gonna be good and be the man you saw me as. For you. For both of us.”
stop. So you better come back to me, okay? You’re gonna come home to me and we’re gonna have a nice long chat and you’re gonna let me love you back, ya hear?”
“You took off without so much as a goodbye. And I knew I never really deserved you, but you practically told me you didn’t trust me enough to stay... I took that like a beating, Cas. I took hit after hit and then tried to shake it off like it was no big deal. ‘Cause that’s what I do, don’t I? I shake things off and just keep on keeping on… But that one? Fuck. That shit hurt like a bitch.”
Sam, at the moment, was drinking a smoothie. He had been checking headlines for demonic activity for the past six hours straight. There wasn’t even the slightest abnormality in the weather. He grabbed a beer from the fridge and walked into the control room, where Dean was glaring at his phone. He didn’t even look up when Sam came in, and jumped when Sam put the beer on the table in front of him. That at least made him look up. He grunted a thank you, and returned to his phone.
Dean looked down at his, then tried to shoot it into the trash can like it was a basketball. Somehow it didn’t shatter, but it did miss the trash can by quite a bit. “Not a word,” he grumbled at the three smirking faces. Cas loved when Dean got flustered. Once he had gotten his rebound, so to speak, the two humans went their separate ways. Cas fiddled with one of the colored rings on the table. He had never understood what they were for, but they were entertaining.
Cas sighed. “Jack. Dean and I aren’t together.” The words hurt to say, more than he thought they would.
I think I’ve found your missing angel.”
Both Dean and Eileen groaned. “We know.” Eileen said. “That wasn’t what we were fighting about though.”
So episode 18 huh?? Who would have freakin thunk??? I’m dying, personally. (Trying to be vague so I don’t spoil for anyone). Anyway hope you liked it
“Yes, I will.”
The boys exchanged a glance.
Sam shook his head, smiling.  “Well, I have healthy sleeping habits. I’m the most likely to live past forty five. Night, guys.”
His phone started vibrating. Sam took it out and saw Cas was calling him. He answered. “Cas?”
“What?”
Remember that deal?
“When’s the last time you slept?”
“Is that so?” A new voice rasped. The ghost flickered into existence in front of him. “That brother of yours won’t be able to find us.”
And so begins the final battle
“Yeah. And?”
Cas was humming softly as he picked up popcorn kernels that had somehow gotten behind the couch. A faint smile graced his lips. Dean was supposed to be helping, but he couldn’t tear his eyes away from his angel. He wondered when he had started thinking of Cas that way. His angel. Probably around when he realized he was in love with him.
so.... kinda forgot about this fic 😬, but now that the magnus archives are over and supernatural season 16 is at a lull, i figured its a good idea to get back to posting.
“Anything the vics have in common?” Sam asked in his ‘I went to Stanford’ voice. After taking the night in a cheap motel, the boys left first thing in the morning to speak with the sheriff. Her name tag read jacqueline.
“Cas back me up here.” He heard Dean say.
Jack seemed to understand that. “Because… never mind.”
“He ignored me, Sam. Didn’t say a word to me for three weeks. When he finally started talking to me again, I decided it wasn’t worth mentioning. Haven’t told anyone since.”
Dean jumped up to see Jack peering at him over the couch. “That’s what he is. Dumb, blind gremlin made me trip.” He made a mental note to apologize to the cat later.
The ghost disappeared in a puff of smoke. Out of nowhere came none other than Sam Winchester to the rescue. He rushed over to his brother and untied the ropes keeping him down. Once he was free, Sam tossed him a knife to untie the girl, and he went to help another one Dean hadn’t seen.

TFW 2.0 realizes Cas is gone and tries to find him
“The ghost knocked me out. Dean’s gone.”
“Yes, Dean?” Cas turned to look at him, and Dean found himself paralyzed. A deer in piercing blue headlights.
Sammy gets a lead. Dean gets angy
A rescue mission is planned, big things happen
Sam shrugged. “The town is only half a day's drive. Let’s do it.”
“Cas… loves me?”
No answer.
“What do you mean you don’t know-“
“Sammy is there anything even remotely close to a case?”
Sam ducked out, closing the door behind him. Dean got off his bed and decided someone better make some popcorn.
Dean loved when he was flustered. “Not bad. Actually a milk run, for once. How’re you doing? Where’s—” his query about his brother was cut off by another sneeze.
Just then Jacqueline’s phone rang. Sam gestured for her to take the call and she walked off.
“Jack and I will go grab some beers. You two clean up here and meet us out there.” Eileen said, shooting Dean a pointed look that he pretended not to see. He had never told her that he liked Cas, but it always seemed like she could see everything.
He tried to see what was going on, but Sam had shifted between the ghost and his brother. The ghost disappeared and then, lightning fast, appeared again right next to Sam. Sam tried to get a punch in, but the ghost threw him to the ground.
“You’re the only one who doesn’t.” Dean retorted, “Cas and Jack don’t really count, and your girlfriend gets up later than I do.”
There wasn’t an exact moment where everything clicked. It was a slow buildup of emotions that literally took Dean almost a decade to notice. Once he did though, it was all over. He had a sneaking feeling that Cas liked him back, but there was no way to find out.
“Yes, Dean. Cas likes you.”
It was a small thing. Really not that strange considering how great Cas was with personal space, not to mention the fact that he didn’t even mean to do it. But it sent shivers through Dean’s very soul. He didn’t move a muscle, afraid that the slightest of movements would make Cas’s head leave his shoulder.
“Well then off to Jenny’s house we go.”
Sam finds out what happened to Cas and Dean. Chuck is a massive turd.
“Care any more now?”
“How’s he doing? Still crashing at Jody’s?”
Dean instantly knelt beside him. “Shit. Sorry, Gremlin. Didn’t see you there, buddy.”
Finally he had had enough. “Sam.”
“Surprised you can hear anything with that hair of yours.”
The ghost thumped his head against the ground, and Dean went silent.
“Yes.”
“The kind where I can’t find him and I think he tried to text me the word ‘help’, but he didn’t have time to finish the word.” Dean snapped back.
“Never mind.” he said. “It can wait.”
That’s when Dean saw it.
“And then he didn’t. You were so sad that day.” Sam remembered.
Wait.
I’m realizing I’m really bad at summaries. Eh, whatever. Step right up, folks!! We got ourselves some mutual pining, some fluffy fluff, and my personal favorite There Was Only One Bed!!
“Just off Iver street. There are big signs. You can’t miss it.”
It immediately began hissing, and Dean startled. But then, miraculously, it stopped. The mangy thing cocked its head at Dean, and made a raspy trilling noise.
We got some fluff and some angst right here bois. Sam ships destiel hella hard
“Move fast,” Sam said, “he’ll be back.”
An adorable hedgehog. Nice analogy, Winchester. Totally normal thing to think about your best friend. Just bros being bros.
Three days since any of them had heard from Cas. They had called everyone they could think of, but no one had heard a thing. Jody and Donna had put out missing person reports, and Claire and Kaia were manning the traffic cams. Rowena was doing what she could from hell.
“Cas. The most iconic scene in the movie we just watched. The boulder! Do you think a person could outrun it?”
The Room. You couldn’t say it without the implied capital letters. There were many rooms in the bunker, but only one Room. Dean had created it in his spare time without anyone noticing, and finally had shown Sam once they had gotten a TV. After an unfortunate-or incredible, it depended on who you asked- situation with a ghost and a certain cartoon dog and his mystery solving gang, they had to destroy the TV. For Dean’s birthday, his family had bought him a new one and a couch to replace the two recliners, now that the family had grown. Ever since, they had been having movie nights at least once a month.
“Okay. I’m on my way back. And Dean?”
“So… you think he likes me?”
If anyone else wants to rant about canon right now just drop a comment because I’m sure we all have a lot of feelings right about now
Cas looked up sharply at Dean. “You mean we can keep him?”
“Why is this gremlin in our bunker.”
Sam cleared his throat. “Is it possible she ran off?”
“Thank god for Cas,” Dean sighed, and Sam nodded appreciatively.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ultimate Showdown Time
“We will find him. But the same rule applies to you, okay? No running off.”
Sorry for the shorter chapter today, but don’t worry, more is coming!!
Cas gave him an exasperated look. “He needed help, Dean. I’m an angel. I’m supposed to help.”
Cas heard a squeak on the floor and turned, expecting to see Dean looking for another beer, or Sam grabbing the computer he had left on the table.
“Hey,” Dean interjected. “This isn’t your fault.”
“I heard you yell.”
“Hey Cas? I have something to tell you.”
Cas was by himself. He didn’t feel all alone, however. Most of that was because his family was just a few rooms away.
“Doesn’t matter. He’s smart enough to know I’m always right. Right Cas?”
Suddenly, Dean was thrown into the wall. He stayed conscious this time and saw the ghost was back. It advanced on him, lifting him against the wall by his throat. Sam tried to help, only to be frozen in place as his brother gasped for breath. Dean felt his vision begin to fade, and he weakly hit the ghosts arm, to no avail.
Shoutout to anyone actually reading this ily and I hope you get everything you want in life
His mouth opened and the words were out before he had a chance to stop them. “Hey Cas?” His throat was dry. Was he really doing this? After all this time, now?
The time read 10:12. Dean was about to put the phone down when he realized he had a notification.
“Yeah?” The answer was breathless, so Dean assumed he was out running.
“Cas doesn’t like when you call him that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Because I can. I’m already doomed. Why not have a little fun?”
“Okay,” Dean said, and Sam hung up.
“Why not,” Dean sighed, sitting on the other side of the cat.
“Did you not hear what I just said?” Jenny swelled with rage and only deflated when Sam assured her that he was just checking boxes, and that he did believe her. “No, she wouldn’t’ve.”
“One,” Cas answered, sifting through a file. “Jenny Wendley. The latest victim’s girlfriend.”
“It’s alright,” he whispered, “my brother’ll save us.”
For what seemed like the thousandth time, Sam felt an unquantifiable rage toward their father. Dean had been hiding this for twenty-six years, all because of their terrible father. “Dean,” he said, “I’m sorry about what Dad did, I really am. It was terrible and… and wrong. But we aren’t him. I love you. Jack loves you, even Rowena loves you.” He paused, then added “Cas loves you. All for who you are. This is a part of who you are and you shouldn’t have to hide it. Not from us. Not ever.”
He reached out to pet the little guy, when its paw lashed out and whacked his hand away.
Dean groggily noticed he was being dragged away from Sam. “Sammy!” He tried to yell, his voice slurred. Sam didn’t stir. “Son of a bitch!”
“I think Cas is in trouble.”
Dean couldn’t stop a toothy grin from lifting his tear stained face like the first bloom of spring. “I think I need to make a phone call.”
Sam rolled his eyes, laughing. Both girls had been freed and ungagged, though neither spoke.
“Maybe not,” Dean agreed, then, as loud as he could, he shouted “SAM!”
“Yeah I’m fine. Kind of weird, actually. Usually only sneeze around—”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam raised his gun only to have it knocked aside. Dean didn’t even get the chance to aim his before he was thrown against the wall. He rolled over, groaning.
Almost to the end! I don’t want to spoil so I’m not going to really give y’alls a summary
Cas marched over and sat next to the cat. It hissed, but didn’t move away. Dean noticed its eyes were a strange white color. “Is he blind?” When Cas nodded he asked why he hadn’t healed the thing.
“Like my car?”
Sam rolled his eyes. “Have you seen the way he looks at you?! You two are constantly staring longingly at each other while the other isn’t looking. Everyone notices but both of you.”
Cas had a habit of forgetting to listen to the words being said, instead focusing on the voices talking. Especially when Dean was involved. His voice was low and loud when he drank. It took on a slight rasp when he was tired that Cas could listen to forever. He had no idea what they were bickering about this time, but decided to try anyway. “Yes. Dean is absolutely right.”
Sam sighed. Dean had been stressed since Cas went missing, and it got worse by the minute. He seemed to be past snapping at everyone who breathed too loudly, but now he has completely shut down. “Dean,” he said.
“Sam. Where’s Dean? He's not picking up his phone.”
Dean ran a hand down his face, staring heavenwards. Then he pulled out his phone and called Sam.
Sam put her on speaker. “Yeah Rowena. Both here. What’s up?”
Then the ghost began to scream.
Cas looked up. Jack was looking at him, head cocked to the side. “Yes Jack?”
“Sam. Are you both there?”
“Yeah?” His innocent puppy eyes were overpowering.
“Him? Who’s—”
“They all were gay, but other than that, nothing.”
“Spit it out.”
“That doesn’t count. He wasn’t paying any attention.” Eileen protested.
Thanks to everyone who’s left kudos, comments, and even just reading this at all. I spent a looong time putting it together, so it means a lot to me for people to see it! <3
Sam opened his mouth to continue arguing, but his phone rang. It was Rowena. He hastily answered.
The message simply read ‘H’. Instantly, Dean was on high alert. He had gotten many a text just like that from Sam whenever he got kidnapped, but didn’t have time to finish the word.
“He said it was a scar earned in battle. Those are sacred. I offered to heal all its wounds, but it didn’t want me to.”
The boys go over the plan again
They ask Jack, and begin to form a plan.
Sam sighed exasperatedly. “Pull over, then!”
He caught a flash of long dark hair, and eyes blacker than night. He reached for his angel blade, but found it missing. He must’ve left it in his room. Before he could do anything else, the demon slammed its gun into his forehead, and Cas fell to the floor, groaning. The demon turned around to make sure it hadn’t been seen, and Cas did his best to inconspicuously slide his phone from his pocket. He tried to send a hasty message to Dean, but the demon turned again and saw him. It stomped on the phone, and Cas’s fingers as well, and then kicked him in the head. Cas went silent
Cas turned pink, and had to wait a few seconds to collect himself before saying, “How was the hunt?”
No sign of Cas yet, and Dean is NOT happy about it
“Whatever it is you’re trying to say. Spit it out.”
Once he had finished his first cup, Dean felt much better. That is, until he processed what Jack had said. Dean hunted around the room for his phone, trying to check the time. He found it on the kitchen table, having left it there last night.
“Cas,” Dean inquired.
“Dean, you know it doesn’t bother me, right?” Sam asked.
And just like that, Dean was in love. No amount of sneezing and stuffy noses could drag him away from this cat.
The brothers were driving towards the mine. Dean noticed Sam looked like he wanted to say something, but he kept stopping before any sound came out.
Cas was driving to the cemetery. Dea- the Winchesters needed him. He knew they had an incredible knack for getting out of situations like this, so he tried not to be too nervous. But he also knew how seemingly fond they were of dying. Granted, they always came back, but that wasn’t a risk Cas was willing to take. Making sure no one was around, he picked up speed.
Sam hastily got out of the car.
“Who’s picking?”
“I figured you and Dean would like it.”
Sam turned his bitchface on to full power. Then he ran a hand over his face. “Dean, why? Why are you still trying to hide it? I see the way you look at Cas... the way you’ve looked at him for years, Dean! What’s so bad about admitting it?”
Dean nodded. The kid usually picked a famous action movie, and there was no way to go wrong with those.
“Hello, Dean.”
Dean laid his phone down. The two were sitting across from each other at the bunker table, each  had been buried in their devices before Dean had spoken. “Sam,” he said, “it has been three weeks since we’ve gone on a hunt. Now, I’ve loved it. It’s been great. But I am bored. At this point I’m happy to help out the cops with some human psycho.”
“-and when I looked up, Lana was gone. I called for her but she didn’t answer. I shouted and shouted and then…” she trailed off.
“Try us.” Dean persuaded. They had found he was the best at getting info out of the younger ones. For whatever reason, he was really good with kids.
Hello again my fellow yees and haws. Just wanted to say there are a few spoilers from the first half of season 15. Happy reading!!
“Cas,” Sam put a hand over his face. “I don’t know, the-“
“Of course I do. Just... not like that.”
“Dean?” Dean turned around. A man had flickered into existence. He wore a greasy tank top and jeans, the color of which hard to decipher due to his apparent translucent-ness. At the moment though, neither of the boys noticed the clothing. They were busy staring at his wicked grin and even more wicked dagger.
“Not true. He kidnapped me.”
Cas didn’t know how to answer that without picking a side. He looked to Jack for support, but Jack just shrugged. “Maybe if you tell me what the topic is, I’ll tell you who’s correct.”
“But you love him.”
Eileen pouted and Dean grinned. Poor Jack was looking at everyone like it was a three way ping pong tournament.
“I love you too Dean.”
“I can’t, Sammy. Gotta keep the eyes on the road.”
Dean internally agreed that both of these points made sense, but he also didn’t have any internal coffee yet. “I’ve been up for like, twenty minutes. Why would I have seen him?” There wasn’t any real malice in his words, only petulant grumpiness.
“Yeah.” Sam hung up. Then he tripped over something. Looking back, he saw it was his gun. He picked it up, cocked it, and continued down the mine.
They stood in silence for a few moments. Silence was a thing you had to get used to with Cas. He wasn’t one for small talk. Finally, Dean said, “Well, I came to make popcorn, but I see you beat me to it. See you in The Room.”
He didn’t move.
“Okay.” He said again. He got up and gave Cas a quick hug, which Cas happily returned. The Winchester’s weren’t exactly the biggest fans of PDA, but Cas was a different story. Jack released him and then retreated to his room.
“Yes. That way we each have a Baby.”
Fluff!
“I love you too.”
As it turned out, Sam was the one who did it. The big oaf had shifted to lay his head on Eileen’s lap, stretching out his legs over Cas and Dean’s. Dean wouldn’t have minded. It was a usual occurrence with the moose he called his brother.     But it woke Cas up. He startled and moved his head. Dean was pissed, but his heart wasn’t pumping like he had just run a marathon anymore, so that was a plus.
“You too. Anything over there?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean was too tired to press any further.
“Looks like a gremlin to me. What are we gonna name him?”
Sam gasped, sitting upright. He scanned the dark room, wide eyed, trying to find his brother. “Dean?” He yelled.
“It still fascinates me.” Cas said. Dean jumped, not realizing Cas had noticed him.
“Probably not. Want to come?” Dean responded. Cas nodded, and the three got up to get their bags.
Out of nowhere came an unbearable heat. The heat ate at the ghost, causing it to drop a wheezing Dean to the ground. Both boys (and the forgotten girls) watched as the ghost went up in flames. The fire overtook it, and it disappeared for good.
Eileen shrugged. “He has a point.”
“You can talk to the cat?” Dean asked, stifling another sneeze.
“Did he…” Sam trailed off then started again. “Y'know. Did he run off again?”
Well. There was one.
Instead, he saw someone else.
“Oh. Okay.” Jack nodded, but Cas could still see confusion in his eyes. He was too tired to explain further, so tried to take the attention off of whatever was between him and Dean. “If you want, we can watch more movies with partners of the same sex.”
“If this is your idea of fun you’re frigging looney toons.” Dean muttered.
They decided Cas would stay at the motel to look into who the ghost might be. While he was doing that, Sam and Dean would go to investigate the mine. Cas protested this plan, but he agreed after Dean told him they might need him to find and burn a body.
Sam poked his head into the room. “Movie night. Be ready in twenty minutes.”
Dean clenched his jaw. Sam wasn’t going to let this go unless Dean told him the truth.  “Remember that hunting trip Dad did when I was fifteen? The one in Toronto that he promised he would take me on?”
“I should too.” Eileen put her empty beer bottle in the trash can.
Dean laughed. “Does Jack even know what softball is?”
“Doesn't look like nothing.”
Cas was sitting on the couch back at the motel. Before he could start researching where someone was buried, he had to figure out who the someone was. He opened his phone and turned on the classic rock playlist Dean had made for him, and began the search.
“No.” Dean insisted. “I made him swear not to do that anymore. He didn’t want to but I told him any time any of us run off by ourselves, bad things happen. Like when I tried to throw myself into the ocean. That seemed to make him understand.” He was rambling. He took a deep breath, then continued softly. “No. He didn’t run off.”
The sky was beginning to darken. Dean had been driving for a few hours, and Sam was asleep next to him. Cas was sitting in the back, on a call. He was being quiet, probably so he wouldn’t wake up Sam. Dean tried to gather what he could from the half of the conversation he could hear.
“Not much. Potential case in Ohio.”
“Of course.”
“Yeah. That was because he caught me holding hands with a dude.”
Dean tried to stay calm, but things weren’t looking good. A part of his brain murmured it could’ve been an accidental message, but Dean squashed it immediately.
“Jack?” Dean asked once Cas had hung up, assuming it was him from the casual affection that Cas didn’t give just anybody.
Cas’s face split into a beaming smile. “I was thinking of naming him Baby.”
“Yeah, alright.” Dean replied.
“I’m fine.”
“Yup.”
“It’s...it’s nothing, Dean.”
There was a pause, and he was going to press for more, but he saw the sign. No trespassing. He slowed Baby to a stop and put her in park. They both got out and grabbed the bags from the trunk. The sun was high in the sky, but they would need flashlights where they were going.
Dean gives Jack a pep talk. Very fluff.
“Okay,“ she breathed. “Lana, my girlfriend, and I were exploring the abandoned mine down Iver Street. I know, we shouldn’t have been there, but she begged me to come with her.“ Jenny sniffled. “I should’ve stopped her.“
“The boulder?”
if anyone’s wondering how cas is doing...
It was a text from Cas. That was odd. Cas hated texting because he could barely understand voiced social cues, nevermind written ones. Dean had offered to help him with that, but Cas declined, saying he enjoyed hearing Dean’s voice anyway. Dean had worn a stupid smile for the next three days.
“Spit what out?”
Sam was distinctly aware of Dean and Cas looking at each other and then immediately looking away. He sighed. He put up with this crap every day. If they would just admit—
“Yes, Dean?”
A chorus of “goodnights” followed him as he left the room.
Dean closed the bunker door behind him, exhausted after a long hunt, and immediately sneezed. It was so powerful he jolted back and knocked his head into the door. That was weird, he thought, rubbing his head as pain ran through it.
‘’Just say it... I need to hear it.’’ He looked at him one last time before he averted his eyes to the busy road, among the hordes of people he distinguished Lisa. She was walking towards their place with a wide smile on her face when she saw them and waved at them.
“Does this mean that uncle Dean lives there?" Her father smiled caressing her rosy cheek, a tear slipped down his own cheek as he reminisced his loved one. The child hadn't known the reason why he cried yet. She didn't know how much love her father suppressed inside about that person.
‘’Where's Lisa?’’ Asked Cas, trying to keep the conversation vivid. Just like in the past.
. And they
“Yeah, sure” He said more to himself than to me.
The memories are
Concerning them?
. Seasonal fruit and vegetables are availableeverywhere. Currently, schedules are hectic due to Dean and Lisa's
That fell in love with each other
‘’I liked it.’’ He confessed more to himself rather than to him. ‘’
Dean.
I'll be always coming back to you.’’ He promised.
“Yes. But maybe not...Dean used to believe that the stars are the souls of the lost as well. The souls of cursed, helpless people...” The girl was staring at him without curiosity. His lips suddenly formed a mere nostalgic smile. He wasn't quite sure when was the last time he said that name out loud...How long it had been. How captivating his face was, the sound of his voice in his ears, his lips, his heartbeat, his hands on his body, he was about to forget his emerald eyes... Those eyes he loved unconditionally... He had started forgetting... and Dean was becoming what had always been for him.
“Forgive me”
“You know...You don't need to feel sorry for me.” He said as he came closer. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Stop...
“Thank you, Cas” he whispered gently looking at me.
But let's not forget, forever is an unreachable dream for those on love, a dream no one has accomplished yet. And they may not even get close to doing so. But did Cas say what he wished to tell Dean in the end? He didn't, but Dean was expecting to hear from him this phrase and all these words of love. He wished to hear him say he loves him in order to feel better, that he is not the only one, they're both fools.
They know everything about everyone.
‘’It's too early for you to know, my love.’’ Dean
I will narrate to you a story ofor heavy sea and castaways.
He seemed scared...
His goodbye.
Another soft knock on the door pulled him out of his
He may not like scolding his little brother, but he'd rather he didn't talk at that moment.
He had to say goodbye.
“Even so” John stated.
Pretty ironic, isn't it?
forever, but it's a way · a good way, to keep his memory alive. To remember him. But how can I forget the only person who made me feel really free? how can I forget him, his eyes, his lips, his hands and his heart. And I still lust like a mad man his lips. I still want him to be mine. I remember him, as I promised to him. I will remember him until my last day.
Without Dean.
As for Sam, he looked at Dean, ready to ask him questions.
They're not ready.
They're falling
with a serious tone.This story is not short at all. ‘ ‘ It lasts for years...long before you and your brother were born. Before uncle Jack. Before me.
He just wanted to hear it. He wanted to hear those words rolling from his lips while looking at him.
.’’ Dean said with a childish and theatrical expression, smiling.
She studied him for little and then her eyes momentarily sparkled as her jaw dropped in surprise. Was it that obvious? What he was feeling for him..."Holy ghost, Cas- Don't tell me that..." She paused, he just stared.
It breaks his heart knowing the truth. His truth.
He was staring at Dean walking away, his blurred figure, with a calm and peaceful gaze. He hadn't seen him in so long. He missed him. Of course he did, his eyes at that moment were describing everything he felt for him. Or at least a big part of it.
main name for sorrows,
He stated again and this time a redemptive smile made its way on his face.
‘’Don't pretend you don't get it, you're making it worse.’’ She was fuming with frustration but her eyes were void.
It's so pure and marvelous maybe and insane simultaneously that I still care about him. I still murmur his name every morning, I still smell his scent, I still feel his arm on my chest, I can still feel both our heartbeats get mixed. Ι still feel his lips in mine. It might be silly for someone. I bet it's silly...
He was about to reply with a
Every time hever closes his eyes, he sees the dead body of his loved one, there in the sand, the countless red specks of the sand and above him, the countless stars casting their light upon his broken wings. Every time he closes his eyes, he sees Lucifer killing him. Every time he closes his eyes, he sees him dead.
“Thank you” I said as he gave me the little box.
When he saw me difficult approach his place, his lips formed a slight smile once again. What a wonderful smile. So special and unique. He bits his bottom lip as he raised his hand to greet me.
She's worried about her son. I thought and averted my gaze to the empty street and then to the yard. It was so clean. Steeped in dense vegetation, flowers and trees.
Our lips were still one, I was able to feel our heartbeats getting faster and stronger, muting every other sound and spreading to the place.
Dean without expecting it, it took him some time to reciprocate. They both loved hugs, they infused safety in them.
“Pretty please mommy! Tell us a story about soulmates!” The woman looked at her offspring with curiosity.
Pain is all he feels.
I instantly felt my body burn... my demons whispering faint words I wasn't able to grasp. I noticed a smirk formed in his lips when he saw my reaction. The effect he holds on me. He didn't say a word, like he waited for the answer to come out of my lips. He only turned his head to the front and continued inhaling that deadly smoke coming out of his cigarette while the mere light coming from the moon hidden behind the clouds fell on his mesmerizing features. He kept his eyes closed murmuring some lyrics from a song in a low tone.
"Cas, are you there?"
“I am not that interesting...”
I saw him walking with difficulty, without his crutches, supporting his body on the car. I was about to help him but my instinct told me to stop. That if I helped him, I'd make the situation worse... he was dragging his feet with absolute difficulty because of the wet ground. He seemed mad and he didn't bother to grab his crutches... This man is insane.
"I love you!Dammit- I- I love you, Cas, I always did! I love you so much! I love you!" Sobs and tears, his heart was already broken. Therefore, it's time for him to break now.
It might be a small plain bedroom but in fact it's perhaps the one with the most space in the house. Plain white walls, which made their bedroom seem even more spacious. Once you entered the room, your gaze would fall upon the family pictures and before that on the embroidery embellishing the narrow hallway leading to the magnificent image of their bedroom. Once again, his eyes would meet either some wedding pictures with him and Amelia or the big window which allowed the sunlight to embrace every corner of the room.
many, his fears have started overwhelming him. He breathes slowly and steadily as the lukewarm water is tumbling down his body. He's feeling a bit relieved, shower is a way to calm down and relieve the pain in his joints. Taking a shower always rendered him calmer and had a positive impact on him. It helped him. But just as many others he drowned into his own thoughts, sometimes confused whether the water was coming from the shower or if it was his salty tears.
‘’I don't-’’ She prevented him from finishing his sentence. ‘’You don't have to lie to me, you know that I know about you two. And you know that whatever you choose, I will support you because I care about you.’’ She was telling the truth. Amelia may have been the only one -for the time being- who in favour of their relationship. Besides, only she knew about them. He was happy she wasn't disappointed in him. He was happy she didn't have a problem with him being homosexual, it's making him feel better. That there's nothing wrong with that.
What they
He seemed broken.
Not a long time afterwards, the ship arrived. A large number of people disembarked and ran to hug their families, friends or lovers, whereas some others gave their bitter farewells and promises that they would meet again soon. Cas walked towards the ship to receive the parcel. After about ten minutes, he returned to where Dean and Lisa were, sitting on the same bench, the only difference was that Lisa was now holding Dean's hand. Talking to him nonstop.
, I can't... not here, not now... if someone happens to notice us and tells
“Don't speak. Just... Keep on glancing at me...”
then... goodnight
“There's this silence and peace which I prefer to the real world. You are free there. I guess you understand what I mean...” he said. I shared his opinion. There was no need to say something more.
I set the engine in motion and started driving for the Winchester's house. He just nodded. The rest of our arrive was fairly quiet. He kept his eyes closed.
For I love him, after all these years. I can't forget him. It's so difficult you know, how can I forget the man who made me want to feel every inch of his body on mine?
mother's telling you everything…
The thought of having lost him forever hurts Dean deeply.
he answered, their breaths were connected, just like them themselves. They were one, even though they weren't aware about that, one soul, one body. Their feelings were mutual. This is what soulmates are.
She smiled at him.
He said muted, maybe it was heard asa whisper but whatever the case might be, when he read his lips at that moment he understood.
Cas' ashes traveled in the heavens, the cool breeze becoming one with them, carrying them away, closer to the last ray of the sun which was varnishing behind the enormous mountains. At that moment, he watched his love disappearing, his void and dead gaze fixed upon the Creation.
Castiel looked at Amelia. ‘’You? Drank? That's impossible’’ He said with a calm tone.
"I miss- fuck, sorry... I'm sorry- I'm so, so sorry, for everything." He kept talking and talking, and more tears running down his eyes and his heart broke a little more with every word.
“Mistake? This is an understatement! My own son fucking with a boy?”
we are one,
“We-”
‘’Let's continue... So the next morning, Dean
Silence.
“I want some” I finally stated plainly. He leaned closer to me and indeed what they say is more than true.
the latter's hands were wrapped around his body pulling him even closer, their naked bodies were one. ‘’I'm afraid that you'll go away and leave me alone...’’ He continued and left a kiss on Dean's chest, above his heart.
They were their ecstasy.
They deserved love.
He learned his character in a short perigid of time, just like he did with every inch of his body. He's trying to keep him in his mind to prevent himself from forgetting him, he feels like this day will come sooner than they're expecting. He adjusted himself and attempted to see what he was writing just like he does when he sees him read a book he has grabbed from the library but this time he lifted his old notebook in the air.
So I'm begging you, tell me how much you love me. Please, I'm begging you-
“Yes” he stated, simply and plainly.
?’’ He asked him in a whisper. He had lowered his head because he was crying, reluctantly though. He wasn't to blame for the tears running down his face. And of course, neither Dean is to blame for these hot tears embellishing his rosy cheeks.
He hated the fact, and I think he still does, that Dean found male friends, he wanted him to be lonely. A few months ago, when he found out from Sam about his friend Benny... He was outraged. He didn't want his son to be happy... To be okay with himself.
With a broken voice, he said: "I'm sorry-" he couldn't continue, he couldn't find the right words.
His only thought is-
I still remember the day I met Castiel Novak. My Cas. Even so for me, it was the first time I really felt alive and free. After all these years I still lust his lips. I reminisce his figure so clearly. His graceful black hair... And... Oh, my Lord.... His stunning and fascinating blue eyes locked in mine, as our souls. He was my angel...My lover, my savior from my own hell. My everything.
Gone. Gone. Gone.
even the angels pitied him.
They're not saying the words.
He was wrong. Alcohol didn't take away his pain, but instead, it rendered it more powerful. Alcohol made him feel more.
So unique and lovely.
‘’Does the story have a happy ending though?’’ Dean questioned,
Even if...
He is special.
‘’Are you okay?’’ Dean asked in curiosity, Cas didn't realise the former was in front of him. Only when he shook him lightly and talked to him again did he realise he was here. He just looked at him with a void gaze and started walking away from him. Without a single word. Without anything.
Dean Winchester. My first true lover, my hidden lover, my soulmate and my last lover.
at least I'll be by your side.’’ She gave him a broken smile. ‘’ But this is not what you really want, is it?’’ Her expression was sorrowful.
He was still close to me, not having moved a inch away, he took in one last inhalation of his cigarette. He locked his eyes with mine and placed the cigarette between my lips with his soft fingers. My whole body was jittering. When I inhaled the smoke for the first time it felt terrible but great simultaneously. I coughed but after a few seconds I conformed with the feeling. I breathed the smoke out, I held the cigarette and looked at him laughing.
Perhaps he just refused to believe that Cas is gone for good.
And if you're brave enough to dive and swim a little longer, you'll find yourself on a calm and distant beach. But of course, there is the road, but the road from the forest is only for the courageous. For the few and not for the many. Acts of courage are followed only by those who dare, and they are few, and I will never be one of them.
.’’ Castiel answered quickly. ‘’In September. I'm going to continue my studies and we're going to settle in an apartment. I'm also going to work as a secretary in an office in afternoons.’’
‘’A last one,;; he said. Dean was staring ta Cas. He was striving to make his lips form into a smile but to no avail. He didn't know why he felt sad even if he was
Dean lost Cas.
, but it would last even longer if it weren't for death.
the helpless loves.
“It's been really long since anyone seemed to care about me. I forgot how it-it feels... being important to someone.” He confessed.
“What exactly?” She questioned, she knew their answer...
“Why?”
In him.
“I don't need anyone's sympathy! Let alone help...” he responded in an abrupt manner. His eyes were scarlet red, not only due to the amount of alcohol he had consumed, but of all the overwhelming emotions, entangled with one another and desperately seeking a flash of light in the chaos of his dark thoughts. I, on the contrary, rushed to offer him a helping hand. To man I had just met but it felt like I had known him forever.
Sometimes a whole day.
Well, it's time for another story.
His pained shrieks were probably heard in the land of the phantoms, where his love moved, forever.
‘’I know you're in pain, but... try to show that everything's fine.’’ She has tolerated too much lately. The fact that she still has patience to go on with him is making Cas feel bad and guilty, the only thing he wanted for her was have a happy and calm life. And he's unable to offer her even this. If he can't do it with Amelia, how is he supposed to do it with
“Are you alright?” I asked him. As soon as he heard the sound of my voice, he opened his eyes and looked at me with a tired look. He processed my question before answering.
He took one, two, three deep breathes and unlocked the door of the library. Amelia's kind look made him smile, even if he forced himself.
‘’We stayed here for some time you know... for some months, it was winter and I was six. You were still a baby. And then we came here again when you were around four. I don't remember much... only some vague memories. At least Dad was happy. So was mum.’’ She said and wipped her tears. They took a deep breath together, they were losing their father, forever.
’ He uttered annoyed through his teeth.
he smiled shyly.
Because love doesn't entail any doubts.
Nor many chances. Up to two or three.
Every almost moment.
. He looked around, he was alone, without Lisa. He hadn't changed much. Only the newly grown beard of some days ago. Besides, how much could someone change in a period of three weeks? His face was sunburned and his freckles were even more visible under the sunlight and his hair a tone more blonde. He surely spent time at the beach.
‘’No. I won't. When I'm with you, I feel carefree and neither of us is to blame.’’ He raised his head and closed his eyes, letting the sunlight embrace his ethereal features.
The soft moonlight showered the bedroom, the clouds were spread across the dark horizon - the rays of the nightlight grabbed the chance to sneak into, to listen to the tragic story of two people in love. Who did their best to be together. They went on as much as they could. They still do. They still strive.
He took an old lighter along with a cigarette out of his pocket.
He smiled and Dean connected their lips, a slow and passionate kiss, like the first ones they had exchanged, his tongue was dominant in his mouth ‘’About how we have touched each other’’ he managed to utter through their passionate kissing state.
‘’And-’’ Cas paused his sentence as Dean's heavy breath fell on his skin and closed his eyes and gave in to the way he was touching him. He is going to miss his kisses, every inch of Dean's body on his own and the moments they didn't get to live.
Just as the door was about to close, Cas said Dean's name out load. The latter held the doorknob to prevent the door from closing and turned to look at Cas. Those eyes, filled with tears, he didn't want to leave because he knew nothing would be the same, there was a glimmer of hope behind Dean's serious gaze which disappeared like a leaf being carried away by the strong wind. Cas just took it away.
He lost a friend during the war as Mary said.
I didn't say anything else. He took the package of the driver's seat, making space for me to sit. He didn't say anything either. He was just caressing the small box raising my curiosity about what it contained. He pushed it towards me. I was trying to erase the memory of what happened a few minutes ago between us but it was too much to handle.

‘’Do you want me to go?’’ He asked, Sam whispered a soft okay before heading to his bedroom.
without much. But he changed his mind instantly, even if he wasn't really willing to do it.
Silence fell into the car until they arrived at the Winchesters'. Sam started running towards them. Dean smiled when his little brother opened the car door for him and helped him get out.
‘’I want to live. I really do, because I simply fear
“I don't give a damn fuck about his opinion. I stopped fucking doing so a long time ago...” He told me with a cold tone, his eyes on me, placing the cigarette between his lips. He lit it up and within a fraction of a second it started burning slowly. He threw his head back to his seat and breathed the smoke out of his mouth.
“Because you don't need to be.” He said loudly.
He was my everything, and he always will be. He was my world, the reason
As if he never existed.
‘’I missed it
I will tell you a fairy tale about a cursed love, the Sun and the Ocean, Life and Death, two lost people... I will tell you a fairy tale which conceals grief and tears. At the end of which the two protagonists encounter Infernum.
When you lose someone, specifically your world — your everything, you miss them so badly to the point you would do anything so as to bring them back, be it for five minutes. At least for a moment, to take a glance of their pretty face.
That's when I understood, he didn't have any intentions to go into his house...at least not for the time being.
He was lost. He felt lost, he was clueless why he felt like it, he didn't know what he felt, all his problems were surrounding him and he was trying to escape. But...
‘’Just so you know... you're not alone.
His everything.

‘’We have time...’’
It was another showery spring twilight. The youthful woman was glancing the stars out of the window of the narrow bedroom. They were countless and so enchanting... They captivated you. When she was a little girl, her father used to tell her that the stars in the sky were the souls of our loving people who were not alive anymore. That they were resting up there, looking down to us and safeguarding us.
And they went on whispering sweet words until the first stats made their appearance. That's where we're going to stay, they said.
A few moments later, Castiel arrived to the small café near the one Dean was at. He saw his sister there out of it, sitting under a large tree creating enough shadow. She was drinking her coffee and reading the latest local newspaper. He smiled at the image of her. He doesn't even remember when was the last time they met. During their childhood years, they used to spend a lot of time with each other and share all their secrets. Once she took notice of him, she stood up and offered him a tender hug. The hug he so much enjoyed.
for I love you. I will be willing to save
Around half an hour later, Dean walked out along with the doctor, who had finished his duty for the day and was ready to close the office. The three of them walked outside and before they changed paths the doctor faced Castiel.
some day.
a poem written by Kiki Dimoula // The Plural From.
To remember them, to remember everything.
“Everything began some years ago... but not that long ago... But let's look into it from the beginning, shall we? So the story took place initially in a showery Thursday in 1946...a day similar to this. Dean would come back home that day, little did he know what was ahead of him... Him and Castiel... Love at first sight which lasted until the very last...”
He is trying so hard to be okay, to look fine and maybe happy, but I can see the sadness on his eyes. The pain and the loss.
“John- I mean Mr. Winchester doesn't allow–”
’ He smiled as he placed his head on his bare chest. He feels asleep there, having his as close as possible. Sorrow is the only emotion Dean has been feeling the last few nights. He always comes back late in the night,
don't give a damn how much you'll break him. Just end it. Otherwise I will.’’
‘’It's want...’’ he started saying as he turned the key to the ignition and initiated the engine. He hesitated to speak his truth.
. In a drab, colourless cosmos, they only distinguished each other's colours.
I saw it, in his green eyes that he was telling me the truth. ”I'm just tired with everything...And I just want only one fucking thing...You know...I just- never mind.” He stopped talking as he took a deep breath, but he never finished his sentence.
Baby laid down between them, yawning. Dean smiled. He might be able to get used to this little gremlin.
But let’s be honest. We’ve never given a crap what canon told us. For years we’ve laughed in the faces of people who told us Dean was straight, told us Cas wasn’t in love with him.
“I’m not your car.”
“How’d you find me?”
Dean was thinking about all this as he walked into The Room, not really paying attention to what he was doing. He ended up walking into the cat, who yelped.
Dean reluctantly obliged, then turned to face his brother. “Alright. What is it?”
Here’s to another fifteen years of saying fuck canon, and writing our characters how they deserve to be written.
The ghost chuckled. “My dear, you arrived at just the right time! I was about to cut into this young lady, but I decided I wanted you to watch it happen.”
The coffee maker made a soft click, and Dean grabbed his mug. Well, the mug. It was actually one of Cas’s, white with the words ‘Crazy Cat Lady’ in comic sans. But Dean had bought it for him, so he figured he wouldn’t mind.
“Dean. The ghost only kidnapped queer people.”
“He learns fast.” Cas protested, and Dean shook his head, smiling.
It was the size of a cat, and it had a long tail. That was where the similarities stopped. The thing was all angles, rail thin with stilts for legs. It might’ve been clean, but the jet black fur was ripped out in places so it looked filthy. Even the ears weren’t the normal triangle shape, with little nicks riddled through them. It sat on the bed, sniffing the air all around.
Dean woke up to the sound of muffled crying. He instinctively tried to turn towards the sound, only to find himself tied up. That was when he opened his eyes, though it didn’t do him much good. What little light there was seemed to be coming from far away.
“What?”
“I’m fine, Eileen and Sam took Jack to Jody’s. She thinks there’s a vamp nest and Jack could use the practice.” Cas responded, then knit his eyebrows together as Dean rubbed his nose. “Dean are you alright?”
Jack seemed perplexed at Cas’s perplexion. “You two love each other, and I thought you would want to see more people like you. Was I wrong?”
Cas finally tore his eyes away from the cat. “Do you want to come meet him?”
“Well,” Dean said, standing up. “Now that I have been proven right, I am going to bed.”
Dean, Sam, Cas, and Jack arrive in Arizona to check out the case. Shenanigans ensue
Jack gives one last gift before he has to leave
Dean tries to understand what the hell just happened. So much fluff.
It was the most goddamned adorable thing Dean had ever seen.
Cas smiled again and grabbed Dean’s hand, tugging him along. Cas led him to one of the spare bedrooms, talking all the way. “I was on a beer run. I figured you’d want one when you got back. Sam and Eileen had already left. When I walked out of the store I heard a noise.” He opened the door and hastily shut it behind them. “That was when I saw him.”
“He is not a gremlin.”
Turning his head as far as he could to the left, he could barely make out a figure who also seemed to be tied up. Dean assumed this was Lana or the other victim. She was gagged, but their captor hadn’t done the same to Dean.
Cas pondered for a moment, then finally said “if it was a short distance, not allowing the boulder to gain momentum, and the person in question was adequately in shape, then yes.”
“No I mean—” Dean stuttered. “It’s just, I love you.”
If his last statement had been a curveball, Cas thought, then this was the equivalent of the pitcher throwing the ball towards the outfield. “What do you… What?” He stuttered.
“They could run around it.” Cas said, confused.
Sam stopped dead.
Dean tried to restrain himself, but then realized there was truly no need. He had saved the world too many times to be afraid of chick flick moments. “You’re my baby, Cas.”
“Hello.”
Cas sat at the table in the bunker’s main room with the other three hunters. They had been there for almost an hour. The conversation had dissolved into a quiet buzz.
“Hello, Dean.” A voice called up from below.
“He was going to head home today, but Jody and the girls are playing a family softball game, and they wished for him to join. He called to say he’d be gone for another day.”
Dean swore under his breath, but didn’t shout again. Instead he asked, “why are you doing this?” He didn’t give a crap why the ghost was actually doing it, but if Dean got him talking, Sam would have more time to find them.
“Dean, look at me.”
Cas’s head was on his shoulder.
“Tell me what?” Cas was being bizarre. He only got this excited around small animals.
The movie ended all too soon. They sat watching the credits, pointing out the funnier names, until the screen went black. “I’m going to grab a beer.” Dean said. “Anyone else?”
“Cas?”
“Perhaps.”
Nothing. Cas had not gone back to his room last night.
