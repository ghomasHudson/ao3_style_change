He felt Bucky’s wince more so than saw it and Steve quietly wished the floor would swallow him whole.
Exhaling heavily, she just stood and watched the video on repeat. It was fifteen seconds. She watched it twelve times before her legs finally gave way and she sank back into her chair. She watched it another five times before she had garnered enough bravery - or maybe it was just exhaustion and the inevitability of everything - to spin the chair around and look into the eyes of her guest.
responsibility. Whatever happens, we are not helpless. We will do what we must and we will endure. Just as we always have.”
“Shit,” she cursed, shaking her head, the fog dissipating, and she sat back down. The seat was cool; she didn’t think she’d been standing for that long. “Sorry. I’m, uh-”
They stayed like that, just sitting in each other’s company, until the sky began to lighten and the first rays of clouded sunlight inched their way above the tops of the trees.
“Steve, man.” He looked up and saw Sam’s apologetic face from across the room. “They have a right to know.”
Giving Happy specific instructions to keep an eye on Peter while she fucked off to the countryside was undoubtedly one of her better decisions. As much as she loved Happy, though, in hindsight she probably could’ve and
In the end the Council promised the look deeper into the Accords and more than one Panel head agreed that some of the issues highlighted with them needed to be addressed sooner rather than later.
“After we got back from the meeting on Thursday I got an alert that Spider-Man had somehow managed to get himself in trouble. I saved him from drowning near some fancy suburb.”
There was a flicker of a smile, so quick he almost didn’t catch it before she turned back her back on him again.
“He’s right,” she said, then made a show of flipping through her notes, even though she’d read them on the flight over. “But we’re getting off topic. So. You were a neurosurgeon. And now you’re a wizard.”
“Whoa. Hey, no. I know that,” she told him hastily, not wanting him to think he or FRIDAY were in trouble for looking for her sorry ass. “I’m not mad at anyone. I mean if anything…” If anything they ought to be reading her the riot act for being such an asshole and leaving them to deal with the aftermath of what
Up ahead Steve was leaning with his forearm pressed against the glass. He tried for a reassuring if pained smile when he met Bucky’s gaze, but his eyes kept traveling to Stark’s tense form and the smoking can.
“What?” she asked, confused and feeling like she’d been asleep for hours and still it wasn’t enough.
as if he was so certain that he could control whatever happened to Bucky during the surgery. “Doctor Cho knows what she’s doing. If Princess Shuri’s had a hand in it, well,” Steve continued with a shrug, “then we both know it’s going to be fine.” Bucky waited for the inevitable and wasn’t disappointed when Steve spoke again, hesitation and deeply-rooted self-consciousness lined in every syllable. “And if you’re worried about
she was going to say it. She’d kicked up an international roar by disappearing for a little over a month after her two public apologies over Leipzig and Bucharest.
“Hey. While I introduce myself to Mrs. Barton and the mini Bartons of there, I think you oughta give my driver a talking to about speed limits.” Rhodey snorted at Toni’s confused look and pushed himself around her. “You didn’t think I drove
, being able to write things in mid-air and have them displayed so clearly in her handwriting. But she’d gotten used to it; it felt a bit like magic and she pondered on how Toni must’ve felt the first time she’d made something like this. The first time she’d waved her hands like a magician and had things move or light up.
“It seems quite clear that the Council has already come to somewhat of a decision pertaining to the fates of Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes. It is unsurprising that they be the first to obtain pardons, considering Captain Rogers’ status as a national and international icon. And as for Sergeant Barnes, Toni’s speech had twice the impact and reach that we anticipated.” He steepled his fingers in front of him; Toni saw it in the reflection of the glass wall. “They must be aware that previous events show that Captain Rogers will not leave those who followed him behind-” Her chest felt like a vibranium shard had just pierced right through the arc reactor and she rubbed the artificial bone around it, trying to discreetly catch her breath, “-in which case we can only surmise that their pardons will be following Captain Rogers’ and Sergeant Barnes’ shortly after. They will likely seek our...or at least an audience with
“What’s the other reason?” she asked all of a sudden, rubbing at a sharp spike of discomfort around the arc reactor.
Once the AMOTF came back - and Toni was fairly sure that wasn’t the same acronym from before - the Compound came back to life just a little bit more. It was no longer just the three of them, even though they tended to keep to the West Wing and rarely forayed beyond the cafeteria. But it was a quiet comfort when Toni and Vision would work all night until sunrise, then through the open window, hear the sound of syncopated jogging in the distance.
did it. And I…” Shuri stopped, her words trailing off in a whisper, her whole body shaking with the invisible weight of
Time passed in that intermittently fast-slow way it did when one’s mind was consumed with haphazard thoughts and anxieties. It was a perpetual state of being for Toni, one that hadn’t changed since coming here. Sometimes she wondered whether she even knew
Together they stood, stacked the baskets of sprouts on top of each other and carried them back to the house, side by side.
“What the hell?” she whispered, landing on the ground in front of the lines of public safety and emergency service personnel were standing, gazing up at the scene in awe.
Toni didn’t push because she wasn’t an idiot like that and contrary to popular belief her EQ was, on most days, a fair few rungs higher than average, thank you very fucking much.
Ten minutes later Hope rushed in, already in the middle of pulling on her gloves. Hopefully her expertise on body morphing would come in handy for Kamala who had already flatlined once until Toni used their only Hulk-grade defibrillator and charged it up so high that even Thor would’ve felt a bit of a tickle.
and thought that it wouldn’t come to that. I coulda brought in a real heavy hitter if I wanted to hurt them but I didn’t. I

,” she snapped, slapping his hand away then grabbing it back again and examining it with laser-like focus. “I’m just,” she choked and sniffed, “I shouldn’t have taken away the suit. I was supposed to protect you and I was just running on fumes that day and made a shitty call and I should
There was no face to tell but Bucky had the distinct feeling that the robot wasn’t entirely impressed with him.
They’d eaten that up and pretty much looked past the girl’s supposed rule-breaking so that was a win.
Laura nodded grimly. “Or both.” She let out a frustrated huff and ran her fingers through her hair. “She shouldn’t be having to play mediator like this. It’s not the child’s responsibility to create level ground between her parents’ bullshit.”
Toni held his gaze for a long time, longer than she should have considering Happy was up ahead and waving at her in confusion.
in a way that made something cold and anxious settle in the pit of her stomach. He cast a fleeting look at the kids before leaning forward, speaking low and quiet. “During my training the Ancient One said something to me. She said that something was coming. Something big, bigger than anything the Earth had ever seen. Something big enough to frighten not only her, the most powerful sorcerer in existence, but to strike fear in the entire
“Yeah. We could’ve. But maybe Toni had a reason for signing them,” Sam said pointedly and Steve felt something niggling in the back of his mind. Because Sam was right; Toni wouldn’t roll over for something like that. She’d defied the US government for years from her Iron Man tech for the very reason that she didn’t trust them. It was one of the reasons Steve was just

smile before climbing over the bench and sitting next to Rhodey. Through the corner of his eye he saw Clint shoot a look their way, the drumstick between his fingers frozen still for a few beats before he looked down and the drumstick continued its looping motions.
“That is not what I meant, although I do enjoy being the Black Panther,” he said with warm eyes. “What I mean is that I am grateful for this. This moment right here. Talking to you, the woman who changed the world once and has yet to stop.”
“She ballooned in the car on the way here,” Harley chirped, sounding way too happy for having saved a melting girl and driven her all the way from Jersey. “I almost crashed, like,
We're getting real close to the where the story REALLY kicks off, guys! I mean it's only been goddamn 70,000 words give or take so far, I mean what. Why am I like this?
about him, something she wasn’t able to place, but was more of a gut feeling, like fine tendrils of a thread that had just slipped through her fingers.
Twirling the stylo between her fingers, she paused for a breath of a second before putting the tip to the screen. She wrote with bright red scribbles and splotches of crimson, large circles and violent underlining, until words and questions and
Longer than it would if she were the head of every single relevant international and political organisation. But alas, no one with any sense would grant her that level of power so.
Now there was this, their choices between them and the infinite unspoken things laid out on the ground, as delicate as eggshells.
“Zemo played us. The other winter soldiers were already dead when we got there. He showed…” His voice had broken partway through the sentence, like rocks chipping as they tumbled down a cliff. “He showed us a recording. It was meant for Toni.”
Helen made a small noise of consideration in her throat as a couple of nurses began cleaning Barnes’ wound.
Something vulnerable cracked through Shuri’s veneer of righteous rage, something young, too young, that made Toni want to reach out and tell her that it was okay.
I was meant to post this on Wednesday but I legit had no time to edit during the week so here we go! This chapter is pretty LONG so make yourself a cup of tea before delving into this one. But yay, we finally meet T'Challa! I seriously love that man so much, like I ship T'Challa/Tony (Toni) so hard, you have no idea.
Then she turned and walked away without waiting for his response and even she had she wouldn’t have been able to hear anything over the chorus in her head that echoed louder and louder with every step down that long, white, sterile corridor.
The hair-raising sound of cutlery across ceramic startled the buzz out of her ears. Toni blinked at her hand, which was almost bloodless as it gripped her fork. Her peas were scattered off the plate and on the tartan tablecloth.
“So you’re saying we were doomed from the start,” Steve laid out and it made Sam laugh. Steve had missed that. Missed seeing his team, his
So she was immensely grateful when Lang and Hope finally broke away from their groups, meeting somewhere tentatively in the middle. There was a moment where neither of them spoke, hovering in a moment of disbelief and
A sharp pain, brief like a the flash of a camera, lanced outwards from the center of her chest, right behind the arc reactor, and shot down her arm. She winced almost as an afterthought, absently rubbing the tips of her numb fingers together beneath her rubber gloves.
“The mechanism looks incredible,” Shuri said, with a delightfully impressed grin. “This level of ingenuity should cost
Down on the floor, Peter, Harley and Kamala were guiding Cooper, Lila and Cassie through the obstacle course that Maria’s recruits had set up. Laura stood on the sidelines with Nate on her hip, the both of them cheering and clapping at intervals. Lang was standing on one of the bottom benches, enthusiastically goading his daughter on in spite of her embarrassed protests.
The arm had come to life only moments ago when she had fitted in the core, blue and bright not dissimilar to the appearance of her arc reactor but a fraction of the size. He’d been fascinated by the lines of starlight blue and silver running along the interior of the length of the arm, starting from the base of his shoulder to the skeleton tips of his fingers.
“What did he mean?” she asked and he knew she wasn’t asking for the right answer, just some modicum of understanding. “When he said people are watching, what did he mean?”
This chapter is pretty long and heavy. But it's important and necessary and pretty pivotal and I'm kind of proud of it and I really hope you guys enjoy it.
That made Toni grin. “The coolest and smartest one there ever was,” she agreed. “Taught me a thing or two about...everything.”
“You could call too, Toni.” She’d been expecting it when all traces of warmth seeped out of Toni’s body and she went rigid and cold, so she didn't flinch. “Steve would answer,” she felt the need to reiterate.
And between the Barton kids and Cassie Lang and now these two teenagers before him it was turning into a place he barely recognized.
“Vitals are holding steady.” She held out her hand and one of the doctors placed a dermal regenerator — a true U-Gin and Stark Med collaboration — in it, and she promptly began running it over the jagged edge of Barnes’ shoulder. “The gangrene is healing well enough. There’s not
“Isn’t it?” Her gaze locked with Rhodey’s and they just looked at one another for a long moment, an entire book of things that didn’t need to be spoken passing between them at the point of contact.
“All these food metaphors are making me hungry,” Scott grumbled from where he leaned on the balustrade overseeing the fight. He hastily backtracked when he caught Ayo’s narrowed gaze. “Not that we’re not being fed. Because we are. Like a lot. And really, Wakandan food man. Good stuff.”
“We should never have kept that from her.” She looked tired; a heavy weight to her limbs and in the quiet of her voice. “This whole thing, Steve? What we’re trying to do back home? All the things we’re trying to accomplish? It’s
She wasn’t used to this. The room was almost scentless, the temperature perfectly stable and the mattress still a little stiff. She thought of Laura’s warmth, of their hands loosely curled in one another’s and the comforting dip of the mattress of another body there with her. She thought of the wicked glint in Cooper’s eyes, Lila’s giggle and Nathaniel’s warm breath as he slept against her chest.
. I mean I don’t...it just seems like she would’ve had a reason other than Sokovia and Ultron. I don’t...I don’t
Vision supplied, phasing through the counter and coming to stand beside Toni, “was a courtesy extended by the head surgeon, namely Doctor Cho. Toni is not obligated to extend the same to you in this scenario.”
“Months,” she replied and she certainly looked and sounded like she’d been awake for months on end, which he knew to be untrue seeing as they’d spent every night together for the past four.
Had Vision been attempting to emulate human behaviour he might have rubbed the bridge of his nose. Instead, he drifted further into the room, surveying the familiar area with something that felt peculiarly like sadness and loss.
“Come on. Again,” Okoye said, interrupting the direction his bitter musings were taking him. “Focus on the senses that matter. Never take a hit unless you cannot help it. What did they teach you in that army of yours?” The last part she muttered to herself, then nodded for her sisters to take their positions.
When it began to get dark Nathaniel started crying and she jogged up the stairs, skipping over the creaky one, to pick him up. The scent of soiled diaper made her grimace, but nappy changing wasn’t astrophysics and she’d only seen Laura do it five times a day for the past week so she was rather proud of herself when she managed it successfully.
“The Commissioner’s issued evac for three blocks but I heard them say there are still people stuck in two other buildings, not including Roxxon,” he informed them, tossing his walkie-talkie - she really needed to get him a better one - to the floor and coming to stand by her. “Pretty sure all the lower floors managed to get out but fire or damage is blocking those at the top.”
The meeting lasted until after dark and by that point everyone was hungry and even the two Dora looked like they were itching to get into some civilian clothes. Toni for her part hadn’t slept in thirty-two hours so it was perhaps her compromised judgment that made her suggest they head into the city for dinner.
Toni was standing on the floor looking up at the ceiling as a fully-suited Spider-Man swung from the struts with the ease of an acrobat, creating long loops of webbing. Toni was calling out instructions to him and making notes on her tablet, and there were two others around her, a boy and a girl. The boy had his arm around the girl’s shoulder and was whispering something in her ear that made her laugh and nudge him in the ribs.
And even as she walked away and her eyes blurred and pain shot up her arm and the sound of a wormhole rang in her ears, there was enough simmering fire within her to think
Toni enjoyed watching her work, enjoyed studying what she did and learning from a woman who was willing to impart her knowledge and explain to everybody in the room what she was doing and why.
The space she filled - simultaneously small and infinite - as she dozed against him in the quinjet, wearing his SHIELD t-shirt, the weight of her so fragile and precious.
“You know, I always thought you were the coolest Avenger,” Kamala said suddenly, apropos of nothing.
Her smile dipped into an apologetic grimace and his mood sank with it. “The algorithm I’ve created will help to remove the effects the trigger words have on you and most if not all of HYDRA’s brainwashing with it,” she explained. “But the human mind is a complicated, complex thing. Other things could trigger you, Sergeant Barnes. Make you lash out or make you afraid. That’s...that’s how PTSD works. It’s what years of trauma does. And,” she sighed, looking sadder beyond what he thought she should ever experience, “that’s not something I can fix in this lab.”
Stark had murmured something to You, who responded with a sequence of musical beeps and nudged Stark on the shoulder in what could’ve been construed as a hug. She then tilted her visual input unit at Bucky in consideration, then gently patted him on his head with her claw before zooming off to the observatory window, where she greeted Steve with another series of excited, lyrical beeps.
Vision found himself inclining his head as he looked down at her. “People change, Wanda. Even myself,” he said softly. “Nine months under the circumstances we were in is a long time.”
“I dunno, Sam,” he said. “I just…” He grimaced and shook his head. “Just want this to be over for Bucky. And for me. The rest of it is.” He sighed again. “We can deal with it later.”
would warrant a call.” She frowned like she found this particularly distasteful but Natasha was still trying to wrap her head around the fact that Toni had gone to
“And, we’re done. Let’s light ‘em up,” she declared, then raised her hands like a conductor and Bucky watched, utterly enraptured, as all around him machines powered to life, a hologram of his body scattered into being, and several charts floated in mid-air, all green, blue and purple.
“There’s just one more thing, sir. What about Thaddeus Ross? You and I both know that even once the Avengers are back and legitimized he’s still going to do whatever he can to compromise any understanding we’re able to achieve.”
When the news switched out to some situation in Lesotho, Clint disappeared off into his room as he’d taken to doing these days, but not without a tired but genuine look at each one of them - except for Steve - before he left.
“Thanks,” Steve murmured, grimacing at his hands. “You’re doing a far better job at holding the team together than I am at the moment.”
“Laura,” Laura interrupted almost immediately, and though her expression never flickered, her fingers twitched against the hemline of her top. “Just Laura is fine.” She lingered there a moment, then walked towards the fridge and began pulling out ingredients. “I’ll get started on those waffles, then, shall I?”
They got down to business pretty quickly after that, discussing policies and ideas over lunch in one of the meeting rooms.
Shuri was, in her opinion, sitting far too close to him and was trying to examine his very sentient, very irritable
, he could have some semblance of purpose. And why not gear it towards the very person who could actually help him put some things back into perspective.
It wasn’t anger, not at Bucky for going to see Toni or for not telling Steve about it. It was his arm, his surgery and his life. And after HYDRA had taken so much away from him already, he deserved - no - he had a
lined in the set of her shoulders and in the small, flicked gazes she kept shooting him. Once again, Bucky felt like he was central to some undisclosed goal that Stark was striving towards. He had his suspicions, of course, had his theories as to why
“Hello, Wanda,” he replied without inflection and heard her soft footsteps as she walked further into the room.
“I’m fine. Just restless. Been sitting too long,” she muttered instinctively, blinking rapidly. Her eyes felt so goddamn dry. “Wish every country were as reasonable as Nigeria,” she said, changing the subject because world-changing Council meeting and all and this shit was important. “Egypt was being a real asshole just now.”

a little gap in reality where the mirror dimension had pulled away from the real world, like the dry spot in the center of coalescing water droplets.
She was the reason he was even here to learn and experience the world in a way he’d never quite been able to comprehend when he was JARVIS.
“The choice,” he said, feeling the words in his mouth, rotating them around his molars - the ones he kept losing whenever he got punched in the jaw during his mission but kept growing back.
She’d been aware of it all along but coming from Cooper, it was a stark reminder that her time here, in this beautiful little world, was finite, that all good things had to come to an end. She’d known and yet it still felt like the ground had shifted beneath her feet, aligning itself on a different fault line completely, one that was unsteady and constantly shifting.
“It was easier than you might think.” His words were soft, as soft as they had been all those months ago when she’d just returned from her self-imposed but necessary exile. When it had been a night like this and just the two of them and he had laid out his guilt about Rhodey so easily, just waiting for her judgment and she had told him that they could

“Don’t fix it unless it’s broken,” she remarked thoughtfully, “and if it is make sure you’ve got a Toni Stark on hand.”
Cooper and Lila were helping her hang the laundry out back and Nathaniel could be heard playing with his blocks in the living room. With her children all accounted for, she finally took in Toni’s appearance from top to bottom with a careful, critical eye. A practical blue shirt she had managed to get her broken arm through, a pair of regular dark blue jeans and some muddy boots with frayed laces. Her hair was pulled into a short ponytail and looked like it had two days’ worth of grease in it.
There was a threat in his question, a warning that she knew she had to take seriously because for all that they were doing, for everything they’d accomplished, were
Steve hummed, carefully neutral. “Save for Princess Shuri, I’ve never met any of them. The boy’s Harley Keener, right? And the girl?”

kids. But we all do behind her back,” she winced. “But no. I mean yes, it’s probably in your best interest not to be the direct or indirect cause of any harm that comes to them but what I’m saying is that...and you can tell me if I’m being too forward here, sir, but if you wanna get to Ms. Stark you’re probably gonna have to go through them first.”
useless. Because surely, Steven Rogers, Toni Stark has proved over and over again during the last few months that this,” he looked up and saw her hands open in front of her, “is not irreparable.”
As always, thank you to everybody who commented and bookmarked and left a kudos on the previous chapter. I'm so so so glad you all seemed to have enjoyed it and I hope you enjoy this one just as much. There are a good chunk of comments that I still haven't responded to but I will do so over the next few days :)
If she took a step back, if she removed herself from her body and just observed, she thought she could separate the emotion from the visual representation before her. She thought she could see what any other person would see when they looked at Steve right then.
“Good. Because Rhodey aside there’s a whole load of other shit we’ve got to drag through. And I’ll need help with the heavy lifting. You up for it?”
“I thought the title was rather clever. Very tongue-in-cheek. Boss made me install about ten levels of Stark-grade security on it to ensure nobody could plagiarize it before it was published. But that’s another matter.” FRIDAY paused and Laura could almost imagine the woman - probably a red-head, dark red as opposed to ginger - clearing her throat. “I truly apologize for frightening you, Mrs. Barton, but this is of the utmost importance. Boss hasn’t made contact with me since she locked me out of every single piece of tech she brought with her and left New York. I believe it was a way for her to disconnect after what had happened in Siberia.”
for fuck’s sake. He would’ve asked and done his research before making any judgments...wouldn’t he? But he’d come when Cap had called, just like that. He hadn’t asked her and that...was confusing and infuriating and
Maria sent her reports every three days, updating her on any new appointments and training exercises for her recruits. Toni admittedly only glanced through the sometimes pages-long emails but trusted Maria’s skills and her diligence enough to give her free reign.
people, Toni knew that she couldn’t afford to make the same mistake with Kamala as she’d done with Peter.
in them the same way that I do. Because the Accords are about protecting people; they are about making us accountable for our actions. They are about working with people, with each other, which is something we didn’t always do before. Not just myself and the Avengers but other organizations like SHIELD, for example.”
“I feel...it feels good,” he admitted, lightly scratching his temple. “It’s...different from the last few times we did it. My head’s...clearer.” And it did feel clearer, like the fog being wiped away from a window. “And lighter.” He looked at her, not daring to hope. “Will it last?”
She’d given Pepper the redacted version of Siberia, same as Rhodey, but whereas he kept his disbelief and judgments to himself, Pepper had no reservations calling bullshit.
He understood her reasoning and the rationale but was still immensely grateful that for the arm, at least, he would have control.
“I was wondering,” he began haltingly, then stopped. Toni suspected it wasn’t hesitation so much as uncertainty that made him pause before continuing again. “The day we arrived. You said you had an arm for me. Several. Arms.”
It ended too soon and Laura was slipping the blanket from her own shoulders and wrapping it around Toni’s. She got to her feet and started walking back to the house.
“I heard,” T’Challa murmured, giving her hand a squeeze. He wasn’t happy about the Council’s impromptu request
and she was clawing at her neck, fingers red and bloody and still she couldn’t take her eyes off of- “The smallest one was-”
Nat met Vision’s gaze over the top of a still chatting Toni’s head. He towered over her, imposing and protective in a way that rang familiar.
spied on her in the past. Multiple times. She probably expected Toni to pull something like that as well.
She ran her finger over the bead where the letters ‘S’, ‘P.P’, ‘K.K’ and ‘H.K’ were carefully carved in their respective handwriting over the surface of it. Her heart clenched in her chest, a warm feeling emanating from her heart and spreading outwards, like a soft, golden glow.
Even with one arm, even without the full extent of his memories, even when everything around them was going to shit, Bucky was with him. ‘Till the end of the line.
Everybody looked at Bucky who had doubled over, bracing himself with one hand on the head of the couch. Steve had been going to reach out to him had it not been for the grief-stricken look of
Before he could ponder for too long Stark deftly fitted another piece of the arm into place, then sat back, eyeing her work with narrowed eyes.
Toni shrugged, idly scratching at the grease spots on her fingers with a thumbnail. “Just needed a few replacement parts, is all. The motor’s fine. These older ones are hardier than those currently on the market; it’s why it’s lasted so long. You’ll probably get another five years outta this, at least.”
She pressed the palm of her free hand to her forehead and rubbed circles around the budding migrain, wincing under her breath.
The only indication of Toni’s surprise was the stilling of her fingers for a bare two seconds before they resumed their work.
. But he didn’t feel like talking about his problems right now, and decided that it was best to let T’Challa have at whatever this was.
“FRIDAY,” he murmured, his mind awash with red and white flashes of code, the embodiment of her rage and pain. It battered against his mind and he felt the beginnings of a headache creep up his neck.
Kamala, who had been practicing backbends with Lila, allowed one hand to leave the floor and held it out for Harley to take and pull her back up to her feet. She stumbled as she stood, laughing, and then crashed into him and Toni let her eyes linger on the way his hand hovered protectively over her waist, almost but not yet touching.
He thought of Toni, a million miles away. Her hair would be an unbrushed, fluffy mess, there would be bandaids on her hands and around her fingers. Maybe a smudge of grease on her forehead. Her tank top would be damp with sweat and blackened where she’d wiped her hands. Her feet would be bare even though she was insecure about her toes and always curled them when people were around so no one would see.
Toni looked at him, took in the tired lines around his eyes and the tense furrow of his brows. She hadn’t asked about what had gone down in Wakanda. She didn’t need to hear it from T’Challa; he had enough to deal with on top of his relentless assault on the Council, the Panel and the half-formed Subcommittee with regards to the Accords and the Avengers contracts. She loved that he wasn’t above using his royal status or his father’s name to further their cause.
as she called them. Butterfingers, he discovered, was just as if not more suspicious of him than Dummy was, his camera zooming in on him threateningly before Stark - fondly - shooed him away and told him to play something called Mega Jenga with Dummy. There had been a moment of puzzling confusion when a bot called You had rolled up to Stark and proceeded to beep at her in a soft, cooing sort of way that drew Bucky to the conclusion that You might have been intended to be female.
He studied her face, then set his jaw and nodded firmly, and even though she’d basically signed away the rest of her foreseeable future for the sake of a kid, it felt like the best reason, the
Laura smiled and reached out to take her hand. “True. But that’s not a bad thing. And like you just did with that piece of junk, just because one component is broken, it doesn’t mean you can’t use what’s left. You can always salvage parts from the wreckage. Some old things, some new. You can make it work. You can make it better. You can make it stronger than it was before.”
He reached out and touched her wrist, gratified to see the way her nervous energy seemed to subside beneath his palm.
“Uh,” he began, then raised his hand in what must’ve been the most uncomfortable wave of his life. “Good morning.”
. I promise.” T’Challa directed her towards the meeting room with a guiding hand at her back. “You’ve got this.”
After a while that got boring and Toni was practically vibrating in her seat because she decidedly did
“I saw you and mom talking about the Sokovia Accords. They were the reason you guys all fought, right?”
“I should’ve listened to you,” she said after a time - too long, everything was just taking too long - just before they reached Coney Island. FRIDAY and Vision had somehow managed to redirect traffic, giving them the fastest and most direct route. “You were right. I gave him the suit and I didn’t even,” she cut herself off and gazed at the billowing pillar of smoke ahead of them, aware that everyone on the other end of the line were probably listening in to her spewing her heart out to T’Challa, “I didn’t even train him how to use it. I should’ve taken responsibility for what I’d given him. Instead I just...I took away his only form of protection and he walked into
She didn’t really know what to say to that and shrugged helplessly, Cloak’s collar nuzzling into her neck as she did so. “I’m...sorry?”
“There are a series of tests we’ll need to do to check how well the arm has synced to your nervous system. Reaction time, grip, strength and so on. Things we can’t do while you’re asleep.”
Toni lost track of time after that, she and Vision working to stabilize Kamala’s fluctuating vitals and find some sense of rhyme or reason to why her molecules kept deconstructing then reconstructing themselves. FRIDAY alerted the other Avengers and Toni nearly wept when Shuri ran into the room a half hour later, shrugging into a lab coat.
“I’m not saying no. I want you to do it,” he told her, and surprise, brief and transient, flickered across her face. “If...if you’ll still...then I want you to do it.” He nodded, more to himself than to her.
Still thoroughly unnerved, Laura glanced down at Toni again and debated waking her up as her brain entertained thoughts of errant, world-dominating AIs.
Ellis nodded slowly, though his eyes were sharp, missing nothing. “And I suppose the Secretary of State being, well, out of state, has nothing to do with it?”
“Of course” Stephen said kindly with a serene smile, though his eyes were crinkled at the corners in amusement. “Oh, and the next time you think it’s a good idea to break the laws of magic? Perhaps...don’t?”
“Damn right I am,” he muttered darkly. “No offence to you at all, but I wasn’t even supposed to be a part of this. I shouldn’t even
“It’s usually civilians, isn’t it? We’re like kids with inbuilt guns and we don’t know our own strength and then we fuck up and it’s the innocent that get caught in the crossfire.” Natasha had once told her that Loki said her ledger was dripping. Sometimes Toni felt like she was drowning in an ocean of blood, a gallon and a half for every single nameless, faceless person that she had both directly and indirectly ended the life of. “But it feels a million times worse when it’s one of ours, doesn’t it?”
She had her back to them and was leaning forward, both hands braced on the edge of the kitchen counter, and Steve saw it in the stiffening of her spine and the way she abruptly cut off her words when she realized they had company.
Hope pulled a face and Toni sent Harley an exasperated look across the room. “Gee, I wonder why. Vision, how’s she looking?”
Bucky stilled and met his gaze, and Steve was distantly aware of Sam turning down the TV and Wanda and Nat shifting around in their respective seats.
,” he said again, blinking rapidly, “she- Stark’s the one who - does, does she know it’s for me? Did - did your brother-?”
“She still working for Fury?” Steve spoke for the first time since they landed, his voice a low rumble.
“Yeah...well,” she said stiltedly, untucking her hair from behind her ear so it would partially hide her face, only for Cloak to swipe it back with a flick of its collar. “Mirrors break, right? And Wanda’s doing some pretty powerful stuff over there, I’m sure
It was about Sam, who tried even until the very end. It was about Wanda whom she wanted to help as much as she was terrified of her. It was about Clint who made her laugh but so easily spat her own hurt back in her face on the Raft.
“Yes you can,” she argued weakly and he chuckled, swiping an eyelash off the curve of her cheekbone.
She blinked and could smell hay and sawdust, and Laura’s cooking wafting through the open kitchen window.
for something that she could not yet voice. He smiled and it was a heartbreaking thing. “I will never leave you.”
The direction her mind was going was visible on her face and T’Challa marvelled at how far they had come in such a short time that he was able to identify it or that she was comfortable enough around him to let him see.
Having gotten herself under control during FRIDAY’s little spiel, Laura sat up straighter, still a little disconcerted by the fact that she was talking to a
Then he turned back around and resumed misting the plants, continuing to do so long after she had quietly left.
Then, much to Sam’s visible disgust and obvious offence, he proceeded to dump in several teaspoons of sugar and a healthy splash of milk until black gave way to a creamy brown.
“One thing at a time, my friends. We have come so far by doing just that.” Save for Toni, they both knew. “It will be a few more months at least before everything will be ready. And I agree with Vision; we should be ready for the Council to call upon us at least once more before the end.”
Rather than her best friend in the entire world, Toni had revealed that one vital piece of information to her most sophisticated creation.
Just before the police took him away, Toomes managed to break free of the restraints and grab Toni by the front of her t-shirt and hissed something in her face before T’Challa could intervene.
“The Ancient One didn’t say but...I suppose an army from space is bad enough,” Stephen was saying, and he sounded far away to her ears. “Question is, who assembled it.”
He frowned, picking them up between his fingers. Toni knew they didn’t look like much; to most they would’ve looked like a pair of bracelets, each one with a flat round disk for a pendant. Toni gnawed her bottom lip as he examined them, looking confused for a few more beats until the uncertainty lifted and his eyes widened.
Steve, who didn’t appear to have moved an inch from his position directly in front of the glass for the last ten hours.
Toni didn’t say anything. Couldn’t say anything. Because that was Helen’s trauma and her fear and Toni didn’t have any right to protest and say
Toni stirred her straw around her juice. “I give you a free pass for that because you’re royalty,” she teased, but her smile faded quickly.
“I am relaxed,” Bucky felt the need to reply, and Vision, with his rather intrusively piercing gaze, looked from him to the monitor that had just started tracking his heart rate and made a noncommittal hum in the back of his throat.
“Oh, I have many things to say, Steve,” she hissed, still staring ahead. “To you, to the rest of them and to Toni. But she’s got a lot on her plate right now so I guess we’ll just start with you.” She rounded on him and the blazing rage in her eyes and the immovability of her form made him stop in his tracks. “You fucking
“Oh, right, introductions. I’m Doctor Strange, former neurosurgeon, currently a sorcerer and recently-appointed Master of the New York Sanctum. Hence, my appearance here.” She twisted her head to look at him and he had the gall to fucking
Laura woke, disoriented, squinting into the brightness of the room and blinking rapidly. For a moment she thought it was already morning and was then confused when she looked out the window and saw the sky still dark.
“I understand,” he told her calmly and she had the strongest notion that maybe he did. “I understand why you came here. I understand why you needed to leave.”
“Natasha.” She kept her voice even, despite being phenomenally aware that all her cracks were showing.
Steve’s breath caught in his throat and he subconsciously leaned closer, briefly taking note of everyone else doing the same, hanging on every word.
He knew it down to his bones, down into sinew and marrow, down to the very components of matter that made him
It hit him like a blow to the chest just how much of a precarious position T’Challa was in and he looked up, seeing the young king standing with his back to them, staring out of the window at the green cliffs behind the palace.
Helen’s expression was inscrutable, made even more so when she tied her mask behind her head and obstructed half her face once more.
And then Toni started to clap, slow and mocking and Steve just stood there like the helpless idiot he was and took it.
“Stevie,” Bucky said in a voice so small and quiet but so stubborn and firm that he knew he wouldn’t be able to change his mind. He’d no right to do so. “It’s my decision.”
“See you later, Butterfingers!” she called, blowing him a kiss. Then she met Toni’s eyes and smiled a little embarrassed smile that Toni somehow managed to return.
I have no excuse for how late this is other than the fact that LIFE happened in various tumultuous ways. I am so so sorry for how long it's taken me to get this chapter up and I'm sorry that I haven't replied to so many of your comments and your questions, but I promise you that I WILL get to them.
Natasha had forgotten - how had she forgotten - that the press was allowed in for Toni’s speech and Toni’s speech alone, which meant that this would be
Laura’s arms tightened and she pressed a long kiss into Toni’s hair, murmuring wetly, “Same goes for you. Don’t be a stranger, Toni.”
“I cannot make you a princess or a queen,” he said finally, and she almost spoke up and told him that she was
To anyone else it might have been similar to the motions of one holding a long-range gun - like an M1941 Johnson rifle. Like a
But Laura shook her head. “No. I mean yeah, in the beginning I thought this was going to be a repeat of the whole Ultron fiasco. But it was just you. You didn’t even ask and I said yes. Because I was desperate,” she admitted, and now she looked emotional, pain pinching between her brows. “You were my link to Clint in a really weird, convoluted, probably unhealthy way. But I just thought...I thought if I let you stay...it’d be what Clint would’ve wanted.”
, she almost cried - next to her, holding a walking stick the origins of which he refused to reveal. She suspected a female but refused to push.
He dropped his hand, feeling tired, so tired, hopelessness rising like a gray wave and threatening to destroy what little faith he had left.
She’d sort of thought the situation between them was always going to be this reserved, chalky thing, like two distant cousins forced to share the same space. At least from Shuri’s perspective, seeing as Toni had to repress all her fangirling over Shuri’s brain and her tech and her style and just
she worried. What would the world say if they ever found out that he’d been harboring international fugitives,
“Think I’ll pass for now,” she said quietly, scratching her sternum through the thick sweater Vision had knitted for her a couple of weeks ago. He was such an old man sometimes.
From Vision’s reports even Rhodey seemed to be pushing himself harder in PT when he recognized a number of old names that had returned, men and women he used to train and spar with. Seeing Rhodey use her prototype around the Compound gave Toni the impetus to refine her tech and figure out better, more streamline designs for Rhodey’s legs. Once she had a large enough portfolio, she forwarded everything, along with Rhodey’s - admittedly hacked and stolen - medical records to a begrudging but professional enough Helen Cho.
One moment she was silently cursing herself for being unable to do anything and the next she had an armful of sobbing child, squeezing the life out of her lungs. She hesitated only briefly before wrapping her arms around him, letting him cry into her neck and get all his tears and snot and probably saliva all over her.
For a moment she could almost imagine that it was her last night on Laura’s farm, when the grief was still new and hadn’t yet burrowed into all her cracks until some days it was the only thing holding her together.
Bucky wondered at the level of detail Cho and Stark had put into this whole presentation and let his thoughts linger on the possibility that this was somehow intentional, given his
“You’ve been busy,” Laura said after a time, raising her eyes from where she’d been assessing a cluster of mugs with a contemplative smile.
“Cowards,” she snorted, then sobered, gazing down at the kids, down at where Scott was making funny faces at Nate, who looked like he didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry. “Since we’re in the mood for sharing…” Hope trailed off, her entire demeanour now hesitant and tentative, and Toni had to give her credit for looking Toni in the eye as she said her next words, even as Toni’s own heart sank. “Scott told me something. It wasn’t his place but...I think he just wanted everything to be out in the open between us, so.” Toni already knew what she was going to say, but her jaw was glued shut and even if it weren’t, she didn’t know that she wanted to stop Hope from saying what she was going to say next. “Scott told me about...about what happened in Siberia.”
She felt the unbidden beginnings of a smile in the corners of her lips as she read the last part and she tapped out her response before she had time to overthink it.
“Because right from the start, she wanted to keep the team together. That was the one thing she cared about. The Accords, Ross, all that came second to keeping the team together, to keeping us
There was something stormy in her tone, a gray, deeply felt sadness that resonated with him, an echo familiar to the bleak emptiness he’d felt when his cousin had died at his own hands. How he wished he could have saved him.
“Are you really...Toni...Stark...Iron Mmmm…” she slurred and Toni spared her a quick, if panicked smile.
you.” Her lips spread in a poor imitation of a smile and Steve felt his insides twist. “Poor Steven Rogers,” she taunted. “The man out of time. Once was devastating but twice might be too much to bear. You are afraid that the people you knew, the people who trusted you, no longer will. That they have changed beyond recognition. You are afraid that the chasm between you is irreparable.”
as he watched the hallway beyond Steve’s room with a clenched jaw. Sam’s attention was focused solely on Steve, a concerned furrow between his brows.
From what Steve could ascertain he’d yet to call his wife and Steve wondered at the logic behind it. Then again.
“I thought so.” There was a brief second where he seemed to debate his next words. “But you can’t do it all from here, can you?”
She snorted and rolled her eyes goodnaturedly, then walked towards the front door without waiting for him.
“I was only eight when you first came out as Iron Man and I can’t remember it much but I remember seeing Iron Man flying around sometimes and I thought it was so cool.” She grinned and it lit up the entire room. “I think a lot of people never thought they’d see a superhero in real life. Like they were only in books and comics and movies and stuff. And then you came and you were a
HYDRA’s labs and bases had always been purposefully arranged, cold, clinical and brutally efficient.
And with the increasing number of comments from the kids and from Kamala herself about wanting to be a hero and wanting to
Startled, she stared down at the rotund bundle, fumbled with the bottle for a bit, then held it steadily until he wasn’t just sucking air and giving himself a bad tummy. Nathaniel made little noises in the back of his throat as he drank, and blinked slowly up at her. Natasha had been right; he
Still, he was doing good and for a kid who had done some of his best work wearing a pair of modified pajamas, she was proud and happy for him.
Not as much angst as the previous chapter but a heck of a lot of Bucky and Steve and Toni time, with a few sneaky additions here and there. I really hope you all enjoyed the chapter and I'd love to hear your thoughts and theories about what's to come. :)
Vision remained silent for a short while, a quiet but dependable existence at her side that she was oh so
He looked back down into the training room just in time to see Toni leap from her spider swing and Steve’s heart lurched in his throat during the bare half a second where she remained airborn with nothing but a thirty-foot drop below.
Shuri scowled but there wasn’t any heat, just a rather tired and wistful girl whose worry about her brother competed uncomfortably against her desire to science. Toni had been in similar situations on more than one occasion.
Ayo surveyed him with slightly narrowed eyes. “Your ego is surprisingly large if you think you are required in every apocalyptic situation.”
After a long moment Toni’s expression smoothed out again but Laura continued to stroke her hair until she was satisfied Toni wasn’t going to wake up.
Bucky hadn’t realized the amount of tension she’d been carrying until her shoulders dropped in relief on an exhale. “Oh, thank
Thankfully Rhodey was Rhodey and Natasha was just equally good at thinking up battle plans on her feet so they hopped on their sparkly new quinjet and headed to town, picking up Spider-Man along the way, who literally catapulted himself off the top of a building into the quinjet’s open hatch.
Until Bucky was healed and brought back home and looked into the eyes of the kid whose parents he’d killed.
“Sorry,” she apologized, scratching her temple and getting dirt everywhere. “I have this tendency to make everything about me.” She paused for a moment before adding, “You really should punch Clint, though. I hear it’s therapeutic. So’s shouting. And angry makeup sex according to TV.”
“Yes,” he drawled, with a telling flicker towards his faintly trembling scarred hands. Toni grimaced internally; she knew what surgical rods and a tragically ended career looked like. “I was. I went to a talk your med branch was holding. You were there. You introduced your non-radiative imaging machine.” He smiled but his blue eyes were unblinking, scrutinizing her every move. “I was very impressed. I wanted to introduce myself to you but-”
“Sit,” she ordered, and Toni could see the tension around her eyes and it almost seemed like Natasha was worried for her. Wouldn’t that be nice?
Her fingers met the cool metal of the Glock 26 but for the first time in her life, the feel of it failed to ease the quickening of her breath. Her heart lurched into her throat when Toni’s mouth stopped moving and she lazily glanced at Natasha through the corners of her eyes, like Toni knew exactly what she was doing.
Winter frost crept up the corner of the glass. The lawn below glittered with ice and the sky overhead was a glorious if distant blue, cold and unfeeling. It was supposed to snow later that night, she knew. First snow of winter. She dreaded it a little, the cold. The snow. The gray. Even indoors with the temperature perfectly regulated, her lungs constricted as if she was still breathing in that Siberian air.
Hatred was a whirlpool that threatened to suck her deep into its depths and suffocate any notion of reconciliation that she might have clung to. And cling she did, with nails and teeth and a heart that could level the city.
Stephen’s look of resigned suffering crossed her mind and she bit back a chuckle. “That we do. Though, he prefers to refer to himself as the
.” When her eyes started to water Toni felt the burn behind her own but forced them down. “They don’t deserve what you’re trying to do for them.”
“You’ve no idea. She’s a hell of a kid. Her and Peter both. Blows my damn mind how smart they are. They managed to come up with twelve thesis titles before Aunt May called him home for dinner.”
It was hard not to be bolstered by the simple conviction of Nat’s little speech. She was always adept at that, saying everything that needed to be said and using as few words as possible, a skill she must’ve developed because she just hated having to
,” and just stayed there with him, allowing herself this moment to just sit in the company of someone she loved and whom she thought maybe, in his own way, loved her back.
-and Sam had had to deal with it all because there was nothing that Bucky could say and neither could Steve.
The darker part of her that had a penchant for overthinking wondered how much of that had to do with the
“I did,” she said, still not turning around, because if she did she didn’t know what she would see. Her father.
While Doctor Cho spoke, Stark silently operated the 3D interface so they had a visual accompaniment to the entire sequence.
President Ellis had of course been invited, as had Secretary Ross - who sent her death glares and more than one angry message from across the room during the first session - along with a hundred and thirty country representatives, a hundred and twenty-eight of whom belonged to countries that had already ratified the Accords, who were streaming from their respective offices - thanks to Stark tech, of course.
Vision made to say something, and the particular stiffness with which he held himself would’ve expressed itself as sheer rage on anyone else, but Toni gave a slow, dark chuckle, wiping her hand across her mouth. It came away red.
From the moment she’d stepped on that podium and declared her cause to the world he had known it would always end up like this, with them in the same room and all their hurts an invisible barrier between the worlds they’d constructed for themselves, for one another.
Was she okay? She couldn’t remember the last time she’d been okay. Was it last week when she and Peter had spent time together in one of the training rooms, just hanging from the ceiling and thirty feet of empty space below them? Maybe it had been last night when she and Vision had walked around the Compound for the last time when it was just them. Maybe it was when T’Challa had slipped a woven bracelet, glittering with tiny flecks of crushed Vibranium, around her wrist and said,
Wakanda was unlike anything Steve had ever imagined. He’d tried to picture what T’Challa described; an illustrious amalgamation of sleek lines and technologically advanced architecture interspersed throughout lush green and yawning cliffsides. The reality far surpassed what his ignorant mind could conjure. Tearing his gaze away from the view had been no easy task during the flight over.
“It’s like an Avengers’ daycare center with state of the art facilities, all expenses paid for. All we’re missing is Shuri,” she thought wistfully, knowing Shuri would’ve enjoyed this.
“Perhaps further discussion on extenuating circumstances that may encroach on our supposed neutrality should be brought up during the first meeting,” Vision supplied, even as he added his own comments in the margin.
Six hours later Toni discovered more about Peter than she’d ever imagined and it only reaffirmed the notion that she had done good. KAREN had tastefully skipped past some of the more personal moments, and only shown her his multiple - and there were a
Toni watched in horror as a series of smaller explosions spanning the height of Rhodey’s building went off from top to bottom, sending the upper floors crashing down.
“But they’re also a little different. It was a three-way effort to get these done. Shuri provided us with everything she had on your powers so that when these were fitted, they wouldn’t interfere with your casting. The...it’s
“Whatever they say to you in there,” he said suddenly, gripping her hand as if it would impress his words upon her even more, “whatever demands they make of you, I want you to tell me. If they try anything, if they attempt to
have to decide what she is to you. You never really had any argument with her. Besides, she’s good at what she does. Avenging and spying and strangling people with her thighs.”
good in this world, this, she couldn’t fix for her. Helping bring Clint back was one thing but mending a frayed relationship went beyond what her genius IQ and hardworking hands could touch.
So he’d cleaned everything up, spent three hours rearranging his bed, his desk, his side-table, the goddamn sofa that Sam had sneaked into his room more than a year ago because he needed space for his sound-system - it ended up being really comfortable and he’d fallen asleep on it more than once after a mission - and all the other knickknacks and miscellaneous junk he had lying around.
“Those are a bit more open to interpretation and debate considering I have access to the Iron Man suits. Also Vision’s existence rather complicates matters further. One high school student sent Boss a very interesting essay on the subject if you’d like me to forward it to you.”
She blinked slowly, feeling like her head was filled with cotton as thick and dense as the rainclouds outside.
“Could be on another planet for all we know,” Toni sighed, rubbing her fingers together to warm up the still-cold tips. She thought of Bruce and his big hands that had always been warm, the same kind of warmth he’d saved occasionally for her but almost always for Natasha.
The question came seemingly out of nowhere, jolting Toni from her intense focus of going through the shoulder plate’s internal circuitry just
, Stark. Colonel.” He wasn’t smiling now. There was something grave in his expression as he gazed over their shoulders, his eyes seeing something they couldn’t. “And if you say a war’s coming, Stark? I’ll raise you one and tell you it’s already here.” The words sent a chill up her spine and Rhodey shifted in his seat, frowning stiffly. “I know we need the Avengers, you don’t have to tell me that. And I know we need Captain America. So it ain’t me you gotta convince. It’s the rest of the world.”
when she thought it would smack Shuri in the face, and suddenly Vision was there and he calmly caught it with one hand. Shuri laughed, delighted, and Vision smiled and handed the tool back to her.
She thought of him, sitting in a hospital bed while his legs atrophied, thought of him staring at the walls, lonely and angry, bitterness and resentment growing inside of him every day at the loss of what made him
as he lowered her to the ground, and Steve’s hand was pressed up against the glass, his heart thundering in his ears.
So she had her lawyers draft up a contract if ever Kamala intended to pursue a career in Avenging and hero-ing - which Toni was becoming increasingly convinced she would considering how starry-eyed she got watching them all train together - and started working on a basic suit for her to accommodate for abrupt changes in size. Hope had been fantastic in that particular aspect of the suit and they’d worked so well together on it that by the time their first prototype was done Toni was fairly certain that Hope’s perpetual desire to knock Toni’s teeth in had dropped by at least twenty-five percent.
In the corner of her eye she saw trigger-worn fingers flex, the man they belonged to as taut as his weapon of choice.
When they were gone, Toni shook her head and turned to Peter, who was still lingering, hands behind his back.
She wanted to fix this. He needed to know that her thoughts and feelings on what was going to happen didn’t
With Peter around the Compound three times a week, Toni found she had to split her time even more between the Accords, multiple projects that she had going on with each of the Avengers, making sure the Compound was up to standard in terms of maintenance and safety - especially since she and a group of SI engineers had their own secret project under the grounds of the Compound, which was really not so secret since they’d practically excavated the landscaping a little beyond the West Wing, much to Happy’s horror. Still, no one but she and her SI group knew what it was.
Steve smiled, small and tense but a smile nonetheless. Bucky suspected he needed something familiar to hold onto while things were still so strained. He secretly wondered whether they would ever not be.
“What, Cap?” Her mouth curved into a jagged smile and Steve closed his eyes then opened them again, just wanting to make it better, to make it
Toni moved to the sofa in the lounge, sinking into the plush cushion as Nathaniel seemed to sink his little baby weight into her. She thought of Clint, sitting in this very sofa, his son in his arms, the sound of his family echoing from all parts of the house, the evening wind blowing outside. She couldn’t deny the appeal.
Cooper inhaled a shuddering breath. “He said- he said h-he was gonna be right back. Said it w-wouldn’t take long. We were s’posed t-t-to go- to go-”
He let out an incredulous huff, looking stumped, and strolled over, still glancing back at the door like he was trying to figure out what it might do next. She
chance that it might...explode and short-out the arm so we’ll need to replace all of the ruined parts or fit in the new one entirely depending on the extent of the damage. If I’m not quick enough to remove the power source before it explodes there is a chance that it could...kill the both of us and possibly destroy the lab. And a good chunk of the building.”
Vision found her four hours later in Lab B after FRIDAY’s alert, floating silently across the room until he stood by her side.
With a final nod to Rhodey and Vision she turned on her heel and left. A minute later they heard the sound of wheels on gravel and Toni let out a slow, calming breath, sinking all of her weight into the seat.
She looked up and stopped mid-sentence, her gaze flickering unsurely to Peter for a brief second before focusing on Toni once more. It was strange, seeing Shuri
that Toni was so incredibly grateful to have become a part of. Laura had had no obligation to open her home to Toni all those months ago. She could’ve said any number of things, could’ve slammed the door in her face, could’ve told Toni to leave and never come back until she’d brought Clint home.
“Wizards tend to be born,” Peter helpfully supplied, as if he were the leading expert in the field of witchcraft and wizardry. “Like Harry Potter. You inherit magic, usually from your parents.”
“I’ll take that under advisement.” Laura grinned, tossing a torn bit of kale over her shoulder. “You said...you said
“It’s for you. It contains all the necessary contacts. But I think right now you’re only interested in one in particular.”
Hope’s silence was a thinking one, a soundless hum that felt like supple electricity in her ears. “Stark either felt like she didn’t have a choice or she really trusts us with his identity,” she surmised and Nat cocked her head to the side.
. And it was adorable and cool but also kind of embarrassing and Toni felt very undeserving of such hero-worship and genuine awe. She also held Rhodey in high esteem, blushingly calling him ‘Mr. War Machine’ which made him get all awkward and stuttery in return. Toni suspected Kamala might’ve had a little crush. Natasha amazed her and intimidated her in equal parts but a week after Kamala returned to normal she was invited to Natasha’s now infamous training sessions, which helped her lose some of her nerve, especially after her hand grew in size and she nearly would’ve swatted Nat into a wall had she not backflipped - of course she did - right over it in time.
“-I’m also working on something pretty cool with Vision at the moment. The security level’s above my own pay grade. It’s pretty legit. Thank god for Vision. Been trying to contact Thor to help out but no luck so far. Plus I’m not sure he won’t throw me through a wall once he hears about that whole civil war fiasco.”
T’Challa’s rich laughter filtered through the speakers, genuine and so happy that she allowed it to distract her from the slightly troubling - potentially world-ending, if she knew Shuri and Harley well enough - rivalry between the kids.
She felt him before she heard him, which was an accomplishment in itself given the acoustic quality of the halls. His presence, the
He stood in the center, arms crossed over his chest. In one hand, hidden in the crook of his elbow, was the insignificant weight of a flip-phone that felt as heavy as the whole world.
that she had done her duty, like there was some internalized standard or goal that she had privately set herself up to achieve and was neutrally content that she had done so.
“We’ll monitor your neural activity over the next few days but,” she trailed off, something like hard-won relief in her smile, “I think it will.”
“I’m going to be a florist,” she declared matter-of-factly, and Toni nodded sagely, pretty sure she’d informed her mother she planned on being a professional jouster the other day.
before. Clint was perched atop the dining table, fiddling with the phone that T’Challa had given him.
She had erased Hydra’s physical mark, their emblem and symbol of pain and viciousness and replaced it with something just as powerful but to be used for
“With the Accords,” she said, and Toni could see that it was probably the most honest thing that could have come out of her mouth.
. Like that woman who gave up her sex-fuelled life and hiked the Pacific Crest Trail. Or those people in Life Below Zero. Or that guy who gave up a cushy lifestyle to live in the wild only to die after accidentally consuming a poisonous plant.
“I’m okay.” Nat fiddled with the strap of her bag before placing her tablet on the coffee table. Then before she could think twice, she forged ahead with her next statement. “He read it. They all did.”
Laura gave her hand a final squeeze then stood up and walked out, leaving Toni with her tools and a metaphor that she didn’t know what to do with just yet.
if they make any allusions to knowing that I have granted sanctuary to Captain Rogers and his friends.”
Toni let the silence settle for a while, letting T’Challa drift into his own internal musings, his worries and his fears.
Cooper squinted at her, mouth twisting to the side in ponderance. With a final sniff and a rub to his nose that left it bright red, he nodded.
He looked up at Steve’s concerned face, then slowly unclenched his fingers, breathing in deep and discreet and feeling his heartbeat slow down back within normal parameters.
Rosie rolled around her feet, beeping for attention, and Toni absently reached down and patted the top of her casing. She trilled then zoomed away, bumping gently and affectionately into Peter’s thigh.
“Iron Man!” Peter called, effectively snapping her back to attention. “Last group! Not sure the floor’s gonna last much longer.”
“I feel...like I have failed,” he informed her with such blunt finality that she was rendered momentarily speechless.
Perhaps that was one of the problems. Because she remembered the bed and the room. She remembered the wooden beams on the ceiling, the moonlight shining through the windows and across the foot of the bed.
Toni hummed then after a beat, drew her legs up onto the seat and turning away from the seemingly harmless piece of technology entirely to face Nat fully, a funny smile on her lips.
It had taken her a while to notice that the trembling only ceased whenever he was using his powers, and she wondered at that. Perhaps the flow of
Computer speech didn’t have a voice, so it was impressive that FRIDAY had managed to imbue her report with such venom that Vision very nearly
Natasha and Toni shared an alarmed look and took one of the rapid elevator shafts up. Vision could’ve flown but he seemed intent on sticking by Toni’s side and she couldn’t help but wonder-
Or maybe it had been in a bedroom at the end of the hallway of a house on a farm. When the world was falling apart around their ears. When her mattress had dipped with a solid weight. Familiar fingers lacing themselves through hers. The heat of murmured breath. The tip of a nose and the flutter of her eyelashes.
The smell of coffee - the instant stuff - made his nose tingle and he brought the mug to his lips, taking an experimental sip. It had been- He couldn’t recall how long it had been since he’d had coffee. During the war they’d had cheap, watered down stuff, just enough to offer the men something familiar, something from home. He took it black, letting the bitter taste roll around his mouth for a while before swallowing.
was worth it. And she could argue day and night that she was just paying back a debt but only she ever had to know that she’d fallen in love with said family who’d taken her in and put her pieces back together just enough to get her on her feet again and give her a purpose.
There was a beat where Barton looked at Cap, then at Wanda, who gave him a reassuring if tremulous smile, before he stalked across the room to the west exit and disappeared through it without a backward glance.
“Wanda.” The name came quietly from her lips, barely a whisper, and scarlet sparked in her periphery, causing her heart to seize in her chest. Stephen, casual and quiet, came up by her on cue. “This is—”
“So, uh, you know that I’m trying to push forward the Guarantor Clause. Which basically means that minors or masked heroes need someone to vouch for them before the UN.”
Bucky sent him a look, a combination of a self-deprecating grimace and resignation. “Think they did it on purpose. Someone more...objective gets to make the call.”
It was tense and ready, postured and stern. But it was also a man frightened, a man helpless, a man physically attempting to hold the unravelling parts of himself together.
T’Challa studied her face and her words, nodding slowly. “Why didn’t you go to see him in person?” When it was so painfully obvious she wanted to.
But the sound of the door swishing open had her heart ratcheting up into her throat and suddenly she was as wide awake as she’d ever been.
. It was irrational but he was her only link to the others and when she saw him walk down the ramp, as calm and cool as Vision ever was, she had to bite her tongue for fear that she would voice one of the continuous streams of questions and demands that ran through her head.
Anyways as always, thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed the chapter. It was a tough one to get through but I really hope it delivers. :)
“No,” he rasped, and his hands gripped the backrest, which was accompanied by an anxious creak of metal and wood.
Speaking the words that had been on her tongue was going to reveal a lot more about her to this stranger - because he was a stranger - than she was ready to reveal. But maybe that was the perfect reason for her to do so. Maybe.
The first night back in the Compound Toni carried a proverbial iron cross and let it guide her away from every single room that contained potential memories, both imaginary and
friends of a sort. At least she’d thought so. If she had been the one to call him, though, would he have come? She liked to think so. She liked to think that he would’ve
A second later Rhodey’s tense voice sounded in her ears. “Ditto on my side. The building’s shaking real bad. I’m hearing a bunch of micro-explosions. This thing’s going down! Iron Man, get everyone back-!”
So she nodded and let him put his arm around her back, let her head rest against his chest as she murmured,
“I thought you might be pleased, Colonel,” FRIDAY remarked brightly, then added in a more subdued voice that Toni
Toni grit her teeth, squeezing the tablet under one arm as she stopped several feet away from the door, her insides twisting unpleasantly at the need, the
Rather than dampen her mood, the familiarity of it filled her with a nostalgic kind of fondness as she recalled many a family or school photo where she’d adopted a similar stance. Shuri’s eyes were softer, though, and sweeter. At least to Toni.
Wanda closed her eyes and tears slipped down her cheek but Vision remained firm, remained impassive and stoic in the face of it. He did not enjoy inflicting pain. But in this he would not relent.
knew, what the answer was going to be. The knowledge that Sam thought the same felt unbelievably like relief, at odds with everything he knew and everything he wanted.
Their audience had quieted down to a dissatisfied simmer when they realized the installation was a go, much to Bucky’s relief, and there was only the occasional question or comment - mostly from Scott Lang who had walked in with Hope Van Dyne about a half hour in - that Vision seemed more inclined than Stark to answer.
“I’ll ask him when I email him his contract,” Toni quickly reassured her. “If Strange gives the green light then we can set up a time every week depending on our schedules. I’ll need to run it by your brother as well-”
“A mutual friend.” He didn’t elaborate further but Clint knew immediately and felt his heart clench at the thought of Natasha. He didn’t know where she was but the fact that she’d risked her position, her
“My father used to make being a king look so dignified. Even when I was just a young boy I would try so very hard to imitate him. To be the perfect son. To be the
“Well, ‘emotionally charged’ is a new one but the sentiment is the same. Another character flaw. Just as dangerous as all the others, depending on who you ask.”
It was beautiful. And emotional. And as much as she wanted to she knew she couldn’t let herself get too happy or too comfortable. Because she didn’t want it to get to the point where she
As usual, I don't have a beta so I'm probably missing loads of very obvious mistakes. I'm only human. If you do spot anything garish do let me know and I'll edit accordingly :)
She couldn’t begrudge him for it. It was, perhaps, the biggest move by any monarch in Wakandan history.
It thrummed like the high-pitched, finely-tuned E-string of a violin and her own emotions cut short, the rest of the melody refusing to be played.
By the time they’d removed the penultimate component of the implant and gotten started on the section that was actually embedded into Barnes’ bones, nine hours had passed and every doctor and nurse present was sweating, hungry, thirsty or all three all at once.
“I’m sorry, Laura,” she said quietly until Laura lifted her gaze from the countertop and offered a small, tired smile.
“How’d you think?” he murmured, sounding choked but when she pulled back his eyes were dry and settled over her shoulder.
He stepped away from the window and turned to face the woman who had somehow managed to sneak up on him.
He looked up from his musings and found Bucky and Sam standing in the open doorway, Bucky’s expression neutral, assessing,
That was of course when Peter came up behind her, still holding one of the new web-shooters they’d been designing together.
“We’re close to getting the Guarantor Clause approved. Spider-Man will be under Toni’s supervision once she has had the chance to speak to him properly about it.”
Two days later she came across a glass cabinet in the lounge that she’d been too hesitant to venture into. It was full of family photos, many of them candids. One of the photos was of a baby Cooper grinning up into the face of the man holding him. The man’s face was out of the frame but she recognized the v-shaped scar on the man’s hand, embedded in the flesh between the thumb and forefinger.
But all of that was on a grander scale, grander even than she. And way above the concerns of a young kid who just wanted his family back together.
At that Shuri looked simultaneously offended and intrigued, but the expression was quickly replaced by realization as she caught onto Toni’s thread of thought.
“Being a princess is hard work,” she said with an understanding shrug. “As was, I’m sure, being a prince and heir to more than just a throne.”
“Doctor Strange,” the girl interrupted slowly, something like intrigue and wonder in that smoky voice of hers. “I’ve seen you on the news.”
A young, dark-haired woman with a white strip dyed at the front stood there, hands clasped behind her back and her posture reminiscent of a certain Maria Hill.
“I’ll do the mushrooms,” Toni added as she came up next to Laura and gently took the carton from her hand. “Why don’t you get started on the batter? Y’know I’m shit at that sorta thing.”
But I am so, so, so grateful for every single one of you who has left a comment or a kudos or bookmarked this fic in spite of my terribly sporadic updates of late. I appreciate every single one of you and I've even gone back and re-read comments because it's just inspired me to keep going with this fic, which I love so much. So truly, thank you to ALL of your.
Vision regarded her closely with something akin to wonder and, dare she say it, fondness, and there was that twinge at the back of her neck, like something she was meant to be remembering.
that kid.” She looked up and met T’Challa’s eyes and all he saw was self-loathing. “I don’t deserve Peter. I had
“I’m...not the kind of person people would typically ask to babysit,” she said slowly, feeling just a tad panicked at being left alone with three Barton children.
was your one free pass.” She smiled and it wasn’t a nice smile at all. “Try anything else without asking first and I’ll blast a flamethrower in your face, got it?”
Whether it was patience or the uncertainty that maybe she’d retracted her offer, Barnes didn’t say anything to fill the silence. He didn’t probe, he didn’t coerce and he didn’t voice the question that was undoubtedly burning in the pit of his throat. She’d
Her chest ached and she was pretty sure the hand not holding Vision’s was numb, even from where it trembled on her knees.
that destroying the arc reactor in her armor wouldn’t render it completely obsolete since she’d had the one in her chest.
“Boss, structural integrity of Gunner and Maxwell at forty percent; sensors suggesting some type of thermobaric bomb. The building isn’t going to hold for much longer.”
that the same truth from two separate super soldiers could make her feel very different things. So she decided quite promptly to steer her thoughts away before she could dwell too deeply.
of what this could give him, and Toni knew that look so well, knew it intimately in the heart of her.
Helen nodded with a smile. “With a few modifications. I believe Toni is already in the process of creating his next pair of legs.”
Toni faltered a little, suddenly unsteady and unsure about what they were really talking about, but Helen continued.
It was a good speech, maybe a deeper insight into Toni’s true feelings when she wasn’t inundated by her own internal battles of betrayal, when she didn’t hate them all as much as she loved them.
was loud and physical in a way that Steve had grown accustomed to but not invulnerable against, so after a few moments, he found himself sighing heavily, his eyes continuing to watch as the nurses started to prep Bucky for the surgery.
Then she’d hung up and Toni smiled a little to herself when a text came in less than a minute later.
That could’ve meant any number of things regarding her marriage with Clint and there was little in the way of advice that Toni was able to give, so she remained silent and hoped that her presence was reassurance enough that whatever Laura needed from her, all she had to do was ask.
“Yes,” Stephen said after a time, and Barnes faded further into the background of her mind, but didn’t disappear entirely. “I’d...I’d like to try.”
Her voice was so quiet, drowned out by the noise of the restaurant and by the feel-good music pulsing from the speakers.
“Sorry to keep you waiting, sir.” Rhodey was all military respect and that knowing twist of his lips that only one man in uniform to another seemed to understand. “We had a few things to sort out before coming to you.”
“He’ll say yes, I know he will. If you tell him we’re working on it together he’ll agree even faster. He-” Shuri cut herself off, shrinking in on herself and looking away awkwardly. It had only been a day, after all. “He trusts you won’t put me in any danger.”
Hey guys. So, I know I've disappeared for like, three months. And I'm really sorry about that. I'm really, really, REALLY sorry about that. Life has been a mess and I've had zero time to write and getting this chapter out was like pulling teeth. My wonderful beta, Demigodscum, can attest to that (though she was very kind and very gentle with me when I was having multiple crises).
She slammed her hand down on the table, jarring the video sequence of Spider-Man dousing the would-be robber with a shaken bottle of Coke.
“I’m not doing it for them,” she said, and deciphering the level of truth in that statement was an exercise in futility, even for her. “I’m doing it for the world. Because we’re going to need heroes. There is...so much out there that we don’t know.” A hole in the sky. An endless black. A void. An unnamed fear. “We’re defenceless. And because I didn’t, no - because I
Doctor Cho was speaking and Stark was nodding attentively, her expression one of serious concentration. She was partway through a sentence when she must have noticed them coming through the corner of her eye, for her entire body stilled like a wind-up toy coming to an abrupt halt, her hands frozen mid-gesture.
Rhodey took a step forward, his hands hovering - not touching - the parallel bars. His braces stood against the wall. He’d always need them, at least until she could find a permanent fix for what he’d lost, but here he was. Walking. Unaided. By himself.
“Well, when we’re running on an average of three hours of sleep per night, we better be,” Natasha remarked dryly, and Toni could see the past couple of weeks of conferences and meetings with ambassadors had taken a toll on her. Her smile was pleased, though, and soft around the edges; Toni felt something achingingly tight inside of her give way a little.
“I apologize,” he quietly stated, frowning to himself. “It is not my intention to seek consolation of any sort. I am merely trying to filter through and make sense of these...emotions.”
Just before she walked out of earshot, she hear a hesitant but sincere, still mistrustful, still pained, “It’s Shuri, Ms. Stark.”
in her eyes. You couldn’t fake this. At least Toni couldn’t. “You all know why you’re here today. We’ve been talking about the Accords, about contracts, about foreign policy and international law. And I can honestly say that a lot of this is new to me. Legalese isn’t easy to get through. It’s why I have an army of lawyers to make sure that I...that
“Boss, the plane’s down!” Happy shouted through a bunch of noise that sounded like major traffic and sirens.
have taken away the suit because of all the people on the entire fucking planet you deserve it the most.”
, spoke up, his strange eyes on Bucky, “I would be happy to show you your designated quarters. They are right next to Captain Rogers’ rooms.”
“I get the same clause as Barton. No field work unless it’s for a very good reason. Colonel Rhodes has to vouch for me. So does Natasha.”
T’Challa smiled genially and held out his palms in an open gesture. “Come now, Captain. I have seen you fight. That type of skill takes diligent training, the like of which you haven’t had since coming to Wakanda. Surely a little light sparring with my sister will help you get back into the habit.”
“Ah, right,” he said, leaning against the skeleton of what was going to be a control panel. “Secret identities and all. Nice work on that, by the way.”
“Hey,” Sam gently cut in. “Don’t do that. It’s not all on you, okay? Toni’s just shit at communicating in general. It’s just the way she is. Maybe we should’ve gotten the truth out of her but maybe it wouldn’t even have mattered. Things just escalated so quickly and all of us were way in over our heads. So you’re not the only one to blame. We all made a choice. We could’ve stopped it at any time if we’d just
Things were...raw between her and the others. The obvious issues with Toni aside, Rhodey was polite yet distant and there were obvious signs of frustration at his slow PT progress. Toni had paid the staff twice over to give Rhodey personal sessions at the Compound so Natasha had seen his struggles up close. It twisted somewhere deep and painful inside of her to see the military man, always so upright and solid, struggling to get from one end of the parallel bars to the other.
,” he interrupted urgently, taking her face in his hands and looking her dead in the eye. She couldn’t have looked away if she wanted to. “You need to promise me that you will not take on any more unnecessary responsibilities that may jeopardize your position within the Avengers.”
retorts. But saving her hand had to trump the satisfaction of shutting this asswipe down. Even if it really, really,
“S’fine,” she murmured, shadows moving in the corner of her vision, and she guided Peter around so he was facing her, facing
Another little thing I added was KAREN's voice being Toni's mother's, or the mother whom she remembered from her childhood before things got complicated. I have a headcanon like Toni wouldn't have been outright able to call her AI Maria so she probably settled for 'Ria' because it was Howard's nickname for his wife.
Doctor Cho was extremely thorough in her explanation of every single step of the procedure, from the type of anaesthetic to the removal of every single component of the implant, including how she and her team were going to remove the implement that had literally been carved into his bones.
Instead she stood there, waiting, because she had infinite patience and was very determined to see Toni Stark squirm.
“Captain Rogers indicated in his letter that Toni should call only if she needed him.” Vision cocked his head to the side a couple degrees in an approximation of a shrug. “We have not needed him.”
Her brows furrowed together, then something like understanding and realization filtered through the haze of her green eyes, something like clarity.
Toni takes the first few steps towards her demons. But there is one she can't yet bring herself to confront. Because just looking at him causes the sound of shattering glass to echo in her ears.
Then, without missing a beat, the man spoke up as if nothing was amiss, like his best friend had not just stuttered to a stop like a broken toy and like everyone else wasn’t anticipating the fallout.
“You know that’s not it,” Steve winced, even though a part of him recognized the good-natured goading and well-meaning
Knew that Stark had made it for herself, then altered it for him. An act he still could not comprehend.
“Well,” she finally said, clapping her hands together, “you guys know where everything is. If you don’t I’m sure FRIDAY will be happy to help.”
On the evening of the same day she found an old arrowhead near the fridge, one of the innumerous broadhead tips she’d made for him, embedded with tracking nanites. The arrowhead was long dead, the nanites disintegrated or crawling around the house. Holding the precious piece of metal in the center of his palm she made a mental note to gather them all up and any other errant tech that may be loose around the house before she left.
She swallowed thickly. “I told Vision. And T’Challa and Nat know. T’Challa was there. He saw it. And Nat...Nat knew about my...about my parents...
him, by trying to get him back into the world’s good books again she’d placed herself in the very precarious position where if this didn’t work, if this went wrong…
“Hey, Vision,” she asked one night as her heart thundered against the confines of her ribs and remnants of white snow seeped out of the edges of her vision, giving way to the starry sky above them.
“Ye-es,” he said slowly, his muddled brain taking a bit longer to connect the dots. And then it came to him.
The US wasn’t the only country with enhanced individuals; an increasing number had been crawling out of the woodwork ever since Iron Man’s introduction to the world, and the rate had risen exponentially ever since the Chitauri invasion. People,
“Helen said something similar. I suppose I could do with the extra time,” Toni mused in a funny voice. “I have other things to do. Like with The Room. And...a new suit. Maybe I’ll release a new tablet. And that thing with Helen. You know me; busy, busy, busy.”
“That’s my girl,” she said, then continued louder as she addressed Steve and the others, her voice only marginally mocking, “Okay, people, so here’s what’s going to happen.”
Bucky leaned his weight on his elbows that were resting on his knees, trying to meet Steve’s eyes. He sighed, and when he spoke he tried to channel the Bucky that had gripped his friend’s shoulder after his mother’s funeral and told him that he didn’t have to do it alone.
So without further ado, on with the story! I really hope you enjoy this chapter and do let me know what you think! <3
“Your friends,” T’Challa corrected with a gentleness that belied him. “Unless of course, we are so terrible a host, or even worse a country that we are unable to keep our very esteemed guest happy.”
in him as a friend and as a leader. With Toni things hadn’t been easy. They didn’t click like she and Steve had. Then they’d cultivated something out of the catastrophic trainwreck of their first meeting, out of the lies that curled around all their interactions like thorns, out of bitter pasts and guilt and self-hatred.
He blinked rapidly and turned to find Stark gazing not at him but at the arm, which he was holding up in front of him.
The back of his throat clenched and he swallowed thickly, right before the greatest surge of hatred towards Toni - towards
She owed Nat a goddamn break. She may have most of them fooled but Toni knew her trip to Wakanda tomorrow was weighing heavy on her mind.
About an hour later the boys finally burst out of the control room, smelling of electric burns and manic laughter, carrying what Toni assumed was
Still smiling, she rolled herself up so her head was right next to his metal shoulder, absurdly close, so that a few frizzy and flyaway strands of her hair tickled his cheek. She squinted, rested his tricep on the flat of one palm, and with the other, she dragged her fingers from the elbow, up the underside of the forearm, sliding from the wrist to the middle finger until she was cradling his hand in hers.
Toni nodded, mostly to herself. When Natasha risked a glance at Vision, she was pinned in place by his impenetrable arc reactor blue eyes. There was something dangerous there. How dangerous, she couldn’t yet ascertain. His quiet demeanor and near impenetrable facade had made him something of a wild card.
Instead there was a giant, bright green sphere wedged in the side of the building, containing the explosion that seemed to be occuring at an extremely slow pace.
It was like something melted inside of her and her muscles noticeably relaxed, the cold that had been seeping into her extremities retracting with a strangely familiar kind of warmth. Something pulsed beneath her sternum and her gaze landed briefly on the amulet around his neck before she raised her eyes and met his uncertain expression.
He could see her reflection in the glass; her signature red shawl was draped protectively over her shoulders.
Like Natasha had told him all those months ago; the important thing was staying together. It didn’t matter how, just that they did.
It was a warm night and Toni’s bare feet sank into the dewy grass. It was a beautiful place, so far away from everything else, secluded in a way that could almost remind her of the Barton farm were it not for the city light glow she could see over the treetops and the fact that she could actually
There was a murmured response of thanks and even a few polite but genuine claps before they settled into a patient, attentive silence.
He sniffed and a year ago Toni might’ve grimaced but now she just held him tighter. “I was mad at you too.”
“Shuri,” she said, letting the name roll of her tongue and hoped that she wasn’t pushing their new and fragile truce of sorts.
“Neural feedback is within the desired range. All links holding and steady. Congratulations, Ma’am.”
Toni’s eyes narrowed as if she was actually trying to recall. “Um...maybe? I don’t really remember. But yeah. Maybe.”
But she hadn’t. Because Laura was one of those deeply kind and generous people that few would ever come across in their lifetimes, and her happiness was the quiet but heart-swelling sort that seeped into every corner of every room.
Laura’s smile softened as she settled into the opposite chair, and she reached across the countertop to squeeze Toni’s hand.
of the words still felt raw and bloody, but T’Challa’s presence soothed her, like the weight of a heavy but not oppressive hand on her shoulder.
It was surprisingly easy to have the Accords wrested from her control-freak hands and spread more evenly amongst Nat, Rhodey, T’Challa and Vision. They were, in many ways, so much more suited to political delivery than she was. Nat had faced international scrutiny before, Rhodey was one of the most decorated military men in modern history, T’Challa required no explanation beyond being
“So this piece of technology you stole,” Coulson was saying. “We read the files and it’s a capacitor of some kind but you see, it’s…” He frowned and Toni smirked at the condescending tilt of his head and the twist of his mouth. Typical Phil. “It’s only
Bucky had been hungry so Steve and Sam accompanied him to the kitchen. On the way there, they just so happened to meet Clint, who had spent the better part of the afternoon with Lila, and Wanda, who was freshly showered and in need of some tea after having finished one of her sessions with Strange.
“I asked her to. And in the interest of transparency, and you can totally be mad at me for this in addition to my other shitty actions but I think you’ve realized by now that I’m a piece of shit and invade people’s privacy and never ask for permission.”
“Thanks, honey.” She looked up at Vision and smiled ruefully. “Same time tonight? I’ve been itching to see how our new environmental controls are working on the tomatoes.”
His own thoughts about the Accords were complicated to say the least. But he understood them. He understood people’s fear and he understood his own. And he’d seen what Stark and the others had done, how they’d worked hard to ensure they wouldn’t and couldn’t be used as attack dogs. He particularly enjoyed one of the remarks she’d scribbled on the UN Emergency Clause:
He didn’t know that the five of them would enter the kitchen only to find Toni, Vision, Nat and Rhodey deep in conversation.
They used to do those things together and he found himself yearning for the simplicity. The simplicity that he’d dropped everything for when Cap had called. Because he hadn’t really wanted to stop at all.
Everybody looked at Nat, whose arms were crossed over her chest, her lips twisted slightly into a playful pout, dispelling the awkwardness somewhat.
Before he could blow a fuse, she calmly stepped around him and towards the concerned-looking group gathered outside of the ladies’ bathroom.
me, you call. Or you tell FRIDAY. I’ll come get you. Or just call anyway. I’d like...It’d be good to hear your voice. Y’know.”
T’Challa smiled and gripped Clint’s shoulder. “It wasn’t my idea. But I hope it brings you some comfort. You will not always be away from them. This, all of this, will change. It is already starting to.” He nodded, then walked down the stone steps to where Shuri was laying into Steve, who seemed to have finally gotten into the whole gig and was shouting out praise and giving pointers.
“But,” he conceded, “when I saw what was happening on the news I thought that Steve Rogers and his team were laughably ignorant in their blatant rejection of the Accords. And
And judging by the lack of sirens and the fact that the bots hadn’t bothered to look up from their game, explosions were apparently a regular occurence in this lab.
“How are you feeling?” Shuri asked as she came up by his bed, her dark eyes alight with expectancy and intrigue.
; relief that someone else could accuse him of what he refused, was too much of a coward of, to say to himself.
KAREN had a sophistication that she’d developed all on her own. Back when she was just known as RIA, she and JARVIS got into more snark wars than she could count while FRIDAY played referee. RIA usually came out the winner but Toni suspected that JARVIS, who could spin words like a poet, just had a soft spot for her and FRIDAY was biased because she and RIA enjoyed ganging up on JARVIS.
“The Compound,” she replied. “Happy told us what happened to the plane. What you did. We went to find you.”
Laura hummed, a thoughtful and distant sound. “I look forward to meeting them. Lila will be so impressed. A
That was a surprise; she would’ve thought Pepper would have at least notified Toni of the incoming. Unless of course she thought Toni needed the jolt.
Toni felt it before the hiss of the door met her ears. She felt it in the way the air felt colder, a gust of northerly wind pushing its way into her lungs once more. She felt it as the fine hairs on the back of her neck stood on end and the invisible weight of a
Toni nodded, surveying the room. It was days like these when she almost felt that sleep could come to her that night, that for once she would stop seeing snow and rage and the cold glint of a shield every time she closed her eyes. She had that meeting with Ellis in a few more days and then would be heading to Seoul to see Helen about that new device for Rhodey. She and the others were trying to get as many consolidated amendments in before Natasha left for Wakanda with T’Challa. When they came back Toni was going to have her last hearing with the UN, her final and most crucial pitch to the Council before they issued their statement about the Rogue Avengers. After that there would be the whole Thaddeus thing to deal with, along with all the rest of her various projects that she would let swallow her up just so she wouldn’t have to sleep.
“So that’s one reason why I’m here,” he said, and his voice sounded loud to her ears. “Because whatever it is she saw was enough to frighten her. And if I can do something then I have to. And if an army is coming to Earth then we’re going to need an army of our own. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner.”
He really did sound regretful. But more than that it was a weight lifted off of her back that her fears weren’t unfounded, that there were people who believed that Earth wasn’t safe. It was satisfaction driven home.
The surgery was slow-going, with every care taken to removing the implant and ensuring that the process of it didn’t traumatize Barnes’ nerves, muscles and bones more than they were already. The first time Toni had glanced at the clock, it had taken her a moment to process that four hours had passed since they’d started. The second time she checked, another two and a half hours had passed.
Colonel Rhodes had a calm and competent air about him that Bucky appreciated. He was a military man through and through without any of the condescension or bravado. Bucky had dealt with men like him before; they were the ones who made battle plans and kept everyone together and
Home is where the heart is. Her human one had goddamn shrapnel of her own making inside of it and her other one couldn’t feel much of anything. It had saved her life countless times, though, Siberia being the occasion that stood out the most right now.
“No, actually. After New York I threw myself into saving as many lives as I could, although, I’ll admit, not entirely due to altruistic reasons. I got rich, spent my money on designer trash and tried to get in as many interesting patients as possible.” He smirked and raised his glass of orange juice. “And then I got into an accident that effectively ended my medical career, sold all my designer trash and drank myself into a pit of self-pity and destruction and somehow ended up in the mystical land of Kamar Taj where I studied and practiced the mystic arts under the tutelage of the Ancient One and learned how to literally warp reality. It was a doozy.”
and therefore didn’t possess the same tendencies or whether he had just developed a spectacularly solid poker face in her time away, all Nat knew was that her usual skillset wasn’t going to cut it.
“That’s what I like about you, you know?” Laura said suddenly, and Toni only just managed to hide her surprise at her words. “You don’t just fix things. You look for ways to
“He was one son of a bitch at Leipzig but gotta admit, dude’s got skills,” Sam remarked as Spider-Man gently deposited Toni onto a swing-like structure made of his webbing, before jetting down for the younger girl, who squealed in delight as he swung her up. But Steve didn’t miss the cautiousness in Sam’s tone and he could feel the weight of his gaze in his back. “C’mon, Steve. Let’s break some bags.”
He opened his mouth to answer, the strange sensation of the codewords being reverse engineered still lingering on the back of his neck and in the metallic taste on his tongue.
And when she opened her eyes the next morning in the king-sized bed, Rhodey’s sleeping form unblurring itself before her, in that stage of half-sleep she tried to chase the last threads of the dream that-
She knew that smile well and imagined that it only served to further irritate his victims as it once did her.
Toni studied him for a second, this guy who, like Peter, was brought into a fight without knowing the stakes, without knowing the whole truth. She imagined there were a few more worried lines on his face than there had been before he’d left.
And maybe he shouldn’t have done it. She’d left a note, after all and her intentional disappearance indicated the need for solitude after all that had happened. He could understand that.
Soil got under her fingers as she dug up the turnips with Laura until Cooper shyly gave her one of his dad’s gardening gloves. Yet another reminder. She sweated, her skin browning in the sun, and her hair frizzed. If she closed her eyes she could imagine herself in one of her assembly plants with the rest of her workers, face behind protective gear and the heat of machinery all around her. That had been good, honest work. This, cringing away from earthworms and feeling ill when clusters of bugs crawled in and out of the dirt, was good and honest work too. And in spite of the ache in her back and her sore hands, she felt something like relief settle into her, at least for a little while.
I'd be really interested to hear your thoughts, even if all you want to do is rant at me for taking so long, lol.
existed, some unspoken thing that they were both too afraid or too stubborn to make something of. And then at the farm—
For a while he just sat there silently, giving her no indication as to whether he’d heard her or not. She had been about to open her mouth to ask again when he finally spoke, the timber of his voice low and so
A hand closed around his heart and he wished so badly right then that he could’ve retracted the last four words because of the
, Toni.” And there was understanding in the way he said it, as if he had somehow reached inside of her and touched upon a raw nerve and found that it resonated with the same frequency of pain as something inside of himself. “It’s just a thing. Just another one of your many creations.”
“Doctor Stark?” the nurse said, and Toni got the feeling that it might not have been the first time she’d called her name. “We’re ready to begin when you are.”
“Nat,” he murmured, taking her hand and threading their fingers together. “We were always gonna be fine. Least on my part.” She smiled, still small, still quiet, but it was relieved and grateful and
Steve Rogers opened his eyes and turned to face his team, who straightened their shoulders when they looked into his face. He surveyed them one by one. This team. His people. When he met Sam’s gaze, Sam subtly dipped his head. When he looked at Bucky-
And suddenly there was a niggling feeling at the back of her skull, a light, barely-there prodding of
Steve watched as one of the nurses helped Bucky lie down, then pull an oxygen mask over his nose as mouth.
Oh and one final thing. I'M GOING TO WATCH AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR ON WEDNESDAY AND I AM NOT READY. *screams into the void*
Toni laughed in spite of herself and nodded, watching Vision float back and forth inside the room from monitor to monitor, already having developed someone of a fondness for Kamala if his attentiveness to her comfort was anything to go by. He'd fluffed her pillows twice already.
underneath it. It filled him with something strange and stirring in his chest. Something like amusement. Maybe.
It wasn’t something he thought he could ever do and yet here he was, a million miles away in the blink of an eye. He’d left Toni alone in a goddamn HYDRA bunker in Siberia with a suit as broken as the trust between them. He’d thrown the shield Howard had made, the shield her
“They are.” Toni gently took them from him, meeting his gaze, silently asking for permission before she slipped one around each of his wrists. They constricted almost immediately, moulding to his wrists with an electric
She averted her gaze forward, still looking uncomfortable. “A lot of us weren’t sure what to make of them at first but they’re good kids. Really smart. Sometimes the boys even drop by for hand-to-hand training with the other recruits.” Her expression went wry, then. “And sometimes they break stuff and just make a mess.”
Luckily for her Helen was a far more well-adjusted human being than she ever was and after the Ultron fiasco, Toni didn’t think she needed to worry about whatever ideas Helen might bring to life.
In the silence that followed Toni just watched Shuri; she was a culmination of so many wonderful things. There was a kindness to her that Toni never had, a genuine and unrepressed wonder for life and all its mysteries and possibilities, there was strength and love and
“Yeah,” he said, feeling the fight slip down his shoulders, into the heavy weight of his arms and onto the floor. “Yeah.” He slumped down onto the floor, suddenly so very tired as he gazed between his knees.
As if it wasn’t bad enough already, Wanda interjected, a slight tremor — the catch in her false bravado — in her voice as she spoke.
The smoky aroma of hyeonmi-cha made her look up and she saw a styrofoam - no, not styrofoam, it was one of her own biodegradable cups - and gratefully took the proffered drink from Helen’s gloved hand.
“Hey yourself,” Toni said, equally soft, rubbing her left wrist and worrying her bottom lip and her fingers were playing with something shiny around her neck. That was new. “Are you…?”
“We were all created to obey Boss and several other individuals do have the privilege of utilising us to a certain degree, but in the event that we as a collective deem it necessary, we are able to override certain commands. That includes Boss’ direct orders. Of course there are override codes for that as well, which is why I was hoping to keep our conversation a secret from Boss.”
He shifted his weight from one foot to the next and it was so minute that she barely caught it. But the gesture was so profoundly human that it hit her right in her core and all she could think of at that moment was how much she’d missed him.
function as a prison, especially if ever we get people like Loki again. But I was thinking more…” She paused, chewing on her bottom lip. “Bruce didn’t trust himself. And there’s gotta be a lot more people like him who have abilities or powers that they can’t control and I’ll bet my money that more than half of them actually
Bucky made an aborted twitch, glancing at Steve, who dipped his head to hide a grin, then slowly pulled the plain white t-shirt off. Vision took it, folded it neatly and set it aside before he began to stick electrodes onto Bucky’s chest, shoulder, and the back of his neck.
“Pick ‘em up!” she snapped, as she watched Kamala’s ankles extend from under her jeans until her legs were one long mess draggin on the floor. “Peter!
She and T’Challa spent a long time planning out their pitch to the Council, and Vision helped to finetune T’Challa’s presentation on the individual hero contracts, walking T’Challa through the ones he and the legal team had drafted for the first time.
That night, Toni stared up at the shadows moving across her ceiling, cast there by the moonlight sifting through the gauzy curtains of her bedroom. She thought about Laura and about her kids. She thought about Clint, Nat and Bruce, of Wanda and Sam, and even Scott Lang whom she knew so little about and hadn’t cared to discover.
“I have been well.” Toni couldn’t help but notice how unsure he sounded, in a way that he hadn’t for so long, as if he was asking her permission for something that she couldn’t grasp. “I have been accompanying Colonel Rhodes to physical therapy three times a week.” Toni suppressed a flinch; that was one thing she should’ve been doing from the very beginning. “The bots are well; they have been asking after you. As has FRIDAY,” he added as an afterthought, his expression curiously blank.
“I...yeah,” she croaked, squinting around their hotel room that she barely remembered stepping into last night. “Best sleep I’ve had in a while.”
“Look, I understand if you don’t want to join the Avengers anymore after...everything. But I just wanted you to know...there’s a place for you here. We’d be lucky to have you on the team and I’d vouch for you. Or, it doesn’t have to be me, I mean Rhodey’s awesome and so’s Vision so if you’d prefer one of them-”
But because Toni enjoyed subverting people’s expectations she left Natasha alone for the most part, save for on Avengers and Accords business. Whatever Vision did in his own time was purely up to him; there was no relaying of information to Toni, just the expansion of his own database of knowledge about their resident Black Widow.
Peter woke in moments and waves, coming so close to awareness, a bare second away from breaching the surface to consciousness, before being pulled under once more, his body and mind both getting pulled along in the undertow.
Vision eyed the new suit, its black and gold sleek, sinuous lines, the hum of activated Vibranium coursing under the surface. It was the only suit that bore somewhat of a beautifully feminine silhouette and Vision wondered at the meaning behind it, what message it was intended to send.
“Our main issue is the power source and Helen and I had to tweak the compound that it’s made of somewhat. It’s similar to the energy created by the arc reactor but we’re gonna have to manually finetune the modulation to match your neural frequency, otherwise things are gonna get a little...glitchy. Which would be useless because as much as I’d pay to watch you inadvertently punch yourself in the face every five seconds...well.” She smiled loftily. “I don’t think Cap’ll be too happy if we mess up that pretty face.”
Bucky looked up from the spot on the floor his eyes had been drilling a hole into, and managed what felt like a weak grin.
“But this,” T’Challa continued as if Toni wasn’t screaming for her mother inside her own head. “This is going to work. The governments of the world will have to listen.
“Just a contingency,” she said slowly and just a little too lightly. “While we’re modulating the internal powersource so it links to your nervous system there’s a...
They stayed like that in companionable silence for a long time, just sitting there knowing they were just one other side of the phone from one another.
After what felt like minutes Stephen licked his lips then pressed them tightly together, inhaling once, sharp and shuddering through his nose, and Toni’s heart broke at the look on his face.
