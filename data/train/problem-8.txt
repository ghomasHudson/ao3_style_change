Greg                      I peered through the kitchen door as the delivery staff were directed to the living room and I jumped with glee a little when I saw it was my old photos/letters from under my bed. I shooed them away, sitting cross legged down on the floor and it had been a while since I'd looked through them.
Sherlock               His words finally reassure me, nodding and then leaning to try and slip her into his arms, whispering, "If you wish to spend some time away from me I understand. Mycroft has agreed I can sleep here"
Mycroft                 I set down my fork and pushed my plate away. "What is it, Greg?" My eyes softened as I looked at him.
James Morgan            "I can tell you must be English by the wonderful accent of yours". I look appraisingly. Accent, adorable, this is just my type. "James Morgan, Foreign Embassy Liaison at your service."
Sherlock               My smile falls a little, murmuring gently, "It must have been a terrible shock for you when she died. You seem to be one of the only capable people on her staff."
Rosie                     "Ok. We done. Lez go ome now Myca!" I stand up and start to get myself down off the bed.
Mycroft                 "Feeling any better?" I asked. " I know this is very stressful for you, and for that I'm sorry.”
Greg                      "No, no, got divorced about 4 months ago so I haven't really got anything waiting for me at home." I said casually as we found a table and thought he could have been more subtle about that.
Sherlock               Glancing at John I gesture back into the room, my tone rather pleading, "Just as I was starting to get on with Gary...Mycroft will scare him away John. "
Mycroft                 I broke the kiss, sliding my hand from the back of his neck down his shoulder, and to his hand, holding it to my chest as I straighten. I smiled softly at him. "That was nice." I said quietly.
Mycroft                 I sat in my chair, gazing blankly out the window. I was still having a hard time working through the feelings of betrayal and anger. I was jerked back to reality by a knock on my door. It was only 8:15am... perhaps Greg was early. "Come in" I called out. My calm expression turned to surprise when James walked in, closing the door behind him.
James Morgan      My hand now on the brief case I start to open it hoping they can't see me. "You don’t understand. You don't have to live in this Country. Someone needs to hit the reset button, so we can start over and try again. Those politicians are only looking after themselves and the rest of us are trying not to die for their selfish gain." Finally, the briefcase is open.
Greg                      I shove my phone in my pocket when Sherlock jumped in the taxi and I quickly joined me as the cabbie seemed agitated to get out onto the road. I had another look on my phone, putting it back in my pocket when I decided against texting Mycroft.
Mycroft                 "Willa... I mean, Ms. Smith, died nearly a month ago. I was brought in to temporarily manage things about a week ago." I motioned for Lestrade to take one of the seats across from me, and I resumed my seat.
Greg                      I perch on the edge of the chair again and can see Mycroft has a number of emotions across his face that I'm trying to read. I then smiled when Rosie looked at me and asked something.
Sherlock               "I'm sure it will all be very boring John," I sigh, shaking my head, "Not-Greg always seems to take great delight in sitting me down with coffee for long chats during cases."
Sherlock               Pulling back a little, I flounder. The shallow waters of emotion that I'm usually comfortable in have been left behind a while back and I feel like I'm floundering in shark-infested waters now, "Let him what?"
Greg                      "Yeah, I wouldn't just say it for shits and giggles. There's a hint of mystery about you that I like." I said between mouthfuls and watched him to try to comprehend this. I didn't even know if he liked men in particular as well as women.
Rosie                     Wonder if Papa can make Gayg and Myca keam since I gots some of their hair.
Rosie                     "Wait wait waitwaitwait. We still have polish! We can have pretty nails." I run to grab the pretty polish. I gots yellow and black and a glitter and all sorts of pretty ones Auntie Molly got me.
Mycroft                 I smiled at how good Greg was with Rosie. "Herbert is a very large bee... very fuzzy." I commented.
Greg                      "It's shit, don't try it. But we will bring you back some TimTams as I know you liked the last pack we sent. And we've found out some pretty big news ourselves, we thought Sheela just had sun stroke or a bug but because of blood tests, we found out we're gonna be parents. You're gonna be an uncle." I said the last part more slowly with my jaw dropping.
Greg                      "Were here because we are in the middle of a murder investigation. We understand that you used to be the head of security for the embassy." I started to explain and smiled at the waitress for bringing our coffee over.
Greg                      "I'm alright. I just had a bad dream." I said as I stepped in and had a look around his master bedroom, it being everything I'd expected. Simple but elegant, pristine and I had learnt to be honest with him more times than not
Mycroft                 "Someone broke into Greg's flat?" I asked, walking into the kitchen. "Any idea who? Or why?" I asked. Sherlock had not mentioned anything to me about the investigation, and I wondered if the break-in might be related.
Sherlock               I'm hiding behind some kind of kitchen equipment, yelling back at the chefs, "I just want to find Nina! No, I don't understand a word you're saying. Speak English." Ducking a soup ladle goes flying over my head to crash against the wall, splattering me with the day's special broth
Sherlock               Nodding, I treat her to another wide, sunny smile, leaning back and listening
I thought to myself. "Of course. My Russian is a bit rusty, but I'm sure I can do something with these..." I took the letter and examined it more closely.
Greg                      "It's like you've done this before Mycroft." I smiled as Mycroft started on my left while Rosie did the right, not really minding if she got polish on my fingers. She was trying.
Greg                      "Well maybe you should start putting it high on your priority list. I understand the whole job thing, but you've got to step away from it sometimes." I said as I plugged the lawn mower into an extension lead and looked back at him for a moment.
Mycroft                 "Greg... don't let my brother get you into any trouble, please. The paperwork here is even worse than in London," I smiled.
Mycroft                 "Shit..." I mumbled under my breath. "Sherlock will be the death of me, I swear..." I looked around. "Where is James?" I said with alarm.
Greg                      "Nope, come on, bed time." I sighed as I got up, leaving the trays where they were, and I slowly helped him out of the recliner and felt him wrap his good arm around me very tightly. I guessed it was just for support and I began shuffling us towards his bedroom.
Mycroft                 "Gentlemen, if you will excuse me, I have a call to make to take care of some business in London, and I need some time to prepare for it," I nodded at the other three. Greg nodded, and left for his room.
Mycroft                 I read Sherlock's next message. "It appears Sherlock is planning for a longer stay. Will that be all right?" I was healing well, but still not up to 100%, and didn't want to saddle Greg with caring for two people.
Sherlock               Nodding I take another slow sip, sounding rather disinterested, "Yes, I just told you. We're going to a hospital lab to look at some samples."
Mycroft                 "Sherlock started after I left for university - found one of my secret stashes and helped himself, apparently." I smiled. "Just the one younger brother? Is he as juvenile as Sherlock?"
Greg                      I gently pushed my tongue inside his mouth to dance with his own and I loved the taste of the wine we'd shared. I moved my hand from his face up to the back of his head to run my fingers through his hair, feeling his hand scrunching up my shirt.
Greg                      "Just wait. We’re about to go into a cemetery where Nina is paying respects to somebody and you need to be quiet. To behave. Be respectful." I warned with a very stern look and met his eye to tell him I was serious.
I heard a splash in the pool in the court yard, and stepped closer to the window to see Lestrade was availing himself of the Embassy's pool. Seeing him glide through the water, the muscles in his back flexing with each stroke, gave me a thrill I hadn't felt in many years. I watched as he swam several laps, finally climbing out of the pool, his wet skin shimmering tantalizingly in the sun. A long-forgotten sensation curled in my groin, and I quickly turned away from the window, staring at my desk.
Greg                      I roll off him and reach for the remote, chucking it over to Mycroft so he could sort it out while I skim read the messages on my phone. Sherlock usually the one for the BBC
John                      “He’s better. Still having some pain. They are waiting for the bones to show that they are healing properly before releasing him. A few more days at least.” I answer.
Sherlock               My nostrils flare as this... interloper keeps touching John, growling deep and low, "Hands. Off."
Chief sup                     "Yes." I handed him another file "This is your flight ticket and further information about your journey. Take care, Lestrade. I want you back after this. You are my best DI after all.  "Someone will wait for you when you land in DC"
Mycroft                        "If you must know, the former occupant of this office, Ms. Willoughby Smith, has died under, shall we say, mysterious circumstances.  I am filling in until a suitable permanent replacement can be appointed." I said.  "And what, pray tell, are YOU doing here?  A bit more than a cab ride from Baker Street..."
Sherlock               Without taking my eyes off the screen I murmur, "You're drunk. Not too drunk, unlike when you're annoyed with me or go to watch rugby with Lestrade back home. Speaking of which of course you don't know he's here or you probably would have wanted to go drinking with him already. Which means you've probably spent the evening with the rest of the lecturers at the bar."
Mycroft                 "You underestimate the good doctor, brother. His feeling for you run much deeper than that. Even I can see that." I smile softly.
Peter Harkness    Startled I stop and turn around. “Feel free to call me Peter, Mr. Holmes sir. Getting yourself settled okay?” I ask thankful he had caught me after my aching erection had decided to finally calm down.
Mycroft                 "Fine," I huffed, which triggered a brief coughing fit. My chest ached afterward, but I ignored it. I went over to check on dinner. "This smells divine, Lestrade." I said, loud enough that he could hear me as he searched my desk.
James Morgan      "Something has to change." As we set the last charge I had to ask Peter just one more time... "Are you sure you can do this? I don't want you freezing up at the last minute. Someone needs to be here to make sure they go off properly. I have to be seen at the Embassy, so I can't do it myself".
Mycroft                 "Dinner that doesn't come from a hospital kitchen sounds excellent," I said, relaxing a little bit. "What did you have in mind?"
Sherlock               "And where do I come into all this?" I shoot a glare at Anthea, "He's my brother after all?"
Mycroft                 "That smells divine, Lestrade," I called out to him. I had no idea he was a culinary wizard.
John                      I roll my eyes a bit. “It was an accident.” I catch his eyes then. “I’ve spent enough of my life blaming you for things that weren’t your fault. I won’t do that anymore. I promised myself that.”
Greg                      "Gel-a what?" I frown as I come out from the bathroom and found him to be beaming from ear to ear. I’m guessing he'd found something.
Greg                      "You were trying to get rid of me weeks ago with your snapping because you thought I'd leave. I feel like I need to leave because I can't control what's going on, I don't even know who it is for fuck’s sake." I said as I took my glass again and down the last of it to swing my feet off his lap.
Mycroft                 I reached across the table and scooped up the last bite of pudding with my spoon and held it out invitingly, a small smile on my face.
James Morgan      I get out from under him and start to run again. I hear footsteps, so I turn around and grab the DI following me. Putting him in a choke hold to use as a shield I yell to Mycroft, "Fuck you both. Thanks to you, none of those fucking Neo-Nazis will pay for their crimes. Now let me leave and no one gets hurt".
Greg                      "Yeah, let's pull these blankets up a bit." I smirked slightly and got my wrist back for a moment, so I could tuck him in further. I knew he wouldn't remember this, would probably go back to his normal self but it was nice.
Brad Carter          Taking them to the little cafe near the hotel I sit down and order a coffee. "K. What can I do for you?"
John                      I look at him surprised, with a raised eyebrow. “I... I don’t know. I guess we’d have to see where it goes. Would this man be wine-ing and dine-ing me proper?”
Rosie                     As I sang I threw pieces of the potty paper all around the room. "Thank you, potty. GAYG!! All done."
Mycroft                 I shrugged. "I suppose it was." I struggled to remember last night, the bourbon quite effective at erasing most of it.
Greg                      "Okay so the Russian Flower killed her, it was put in her bowl by accident instead of whomever she was eating with?" I asked as I looked around the hall, finally following Sherlock inside.
Mycroft                 I smiled at Lestrade when he opened the car door for me, and we walked into the restaurant together. After a brief wait, we were seated in a quiet room, and handed menus. "This restaurant came highly recommended by David, my personal chef. His brother-in-law runs the kitchen, apparently." I commented.
Greg                      "It looks like we need to have some champagne when you get back with what's on John's finger." I grinned as I leant closer and noticed he hid his hand away while his face paled.
Mycroft                 I motioned to his plate. "I had David make spaghetti bolognese... one of your favorites, as I recall." I took a bite of my own helping.
Greg                      "I just can't get away from you Holmes lot. I should have known.. I should have bloody known." I said rather than a hello and watched him rise from the soft leather chair.
Mycroft                 I rolled onto my side, resting my head on his shoulder. " there are those of us who rarely show emotion." I said, my hand tracing lazy circles on his chest. " I find your ability to do so quite enticing.
John                      “Still. Sherlock. Still.” I look around a bit. “What are we even looking for?”
Mycroft                 I shrugged off his concern, and rose. "Let's get going. We don't want to be late." I strode out the door to our waiting car.
Sherlock               Glaring back at Mycroft, I snap, "Don't tell me to stop it, Mycroft. I wish I could stop it but somehow these feelings of concern for you keep appearing."
John                      “Hi, sweetie. I heard you had some yucky juice. How do you feel?” I ask as Rosie stirs.
Mycroft                 I smoothed my waistcoat, and put my hand on the door. "Into battle, then," I smiled briefly, then let my untouchable persona slide over me, opening the door and walking toward my office, Greg close behind.
Mycroft                 I could hear Sherlock again... he sounded closer... and worried. My heart jumped - he must be all right
Greg                      "Are you alright? I didn't hurt you, did I?" I looked him up and down where I'd just shoved him up against a random wall, my eyes meeting his again when his hand moved to rest on the curve of my jaw.
Greg                      "You really are too kind and what was your childhood home like? Where was it?" I asked as I started clearing the breakfast things up and I was trying to think where the gardening equipment was.
Greg                      "A unicorn makes the cream with its fur when it needs a hair cut. It'll take the cut hair and put it into a mixer with fairy juice to make it into the unicorn cream." I explained as I let her down and knew the crying had made her tired.
Greg                      Once we'd gotten the confession out of Nina and knew James was involved, we rushed back to the car to deal with her at a later point. I got my phone into the hands-free option, texting Mycroft.
Greg                      "Hey. How is he?" I said softly, beaming at Rosie when she grinned at me. I saw she was holding the Bee that Mycroft had once had.
Mycroft                 "Hopefully, Dimmock will have wrapped up the investigation by the time they return, so you can spend time with them
Greg                      I turned my back on Rosie and folded my arms, "Yes, a car is coming to pick me up in about an hour so we could move some of my stuff into your house. And the medical equipment will be moved in while you're still here." I explained.
Greg                      I had cupped his face briefly when he'd kissed me and I smiled more honestly when I felt Rosie curling up beside me as she woke up. I smoothed down her hair, throwing the big blanket over the pair of us.
Sherlock               My eyes widen, my body leaning forwards towards him without any conscious choice on my part. A low rumble vibrates through my chest and throat as my gaze becomes even more intense, nodding, "Impressive."
John                      “No. I mean I have plans of my own tomorrow. I’m going to the Air and Space museum. With... a friend.” I take the business card out of my shirt pocket, turning it over.
Greg                      My heart jumped when he brushed his lips against mine but when he kissed me again more confidently, I leant into it with my eyes shut. It felt totally different to the kiss I'd shared with Peter and it felt a lot better. A lot more right. I wrapped my arms around his waist as his other hand cupped the other side of my face.
Greg                      I looked up at him as he stifled the moan with his arm and I wrapped my hand around the base as I licked a long stroke up his cock. I could feel him twitching, his muffled sounds ringing in my ears as I then took his head in my mouth.
John                      I start on my belt, a little quicker at his request, and then on to the zip of my trousers. I shuffle back off the bed to stand in the floor, toeing off my shoes before pushing my trousers down over my hips.
Greg                      "It's alright Rosie. I'll braid your hair while Uncle Myc gets his hair cut and we can watch." I smile as I pick her up and I'd placed Mycroft’s and Carlton’s tea beside them to drink as they pleased.
Greg                      "You want to do this slowly or quickly?" I asked as I continued to stroke him and didn't mind either way. I encouraged him to move his hips, him seeming completely undone.
Greg                      "I apologise if I'm a bit hostile. I met your brother out in the lobby and you know how he pushes my buttons all hours of the day." I started to say softly after a minute or so silence, my posture relaxing along with my face softening.
Sherlock               There's a glint to my eyes that hints that I also can't wait to see John in a 'skirt'
Greg                      I followed dumbly as we left his office and then went down the corridor to his suite, my head reeling where he'd pounced on me and I was hoping he wasn’t just doing this to make up for last night. Once we got to his bedroom, I saw him turn to me again and smile.
Greg                      "Answer my question Sherlock. What the hell are you doing in Mycroft’s suite? How did you get in?" I ask angrily as I pick up my shirt and slip it on my shoulders, so I had something at least covering me.
Mycroft                 I sat down at my desk, and picked up the phone. "David? Please send up a carafe of strong black coffee. Thank you." I hung up. "If I'm to make it through lunch, I will need it," I smile slightly at Lestrade.
Greg                      "You're gonna have to wear long sleeves for a while." I chuckled as I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand and sat up on my knees, so I could kiss him again since he seemed at such a loss for words. It was beautiful.
Mycroft                 "I barely know the man. My mutinous PA decided he should reside here during my recovery. I had no choice in the matter."
John                      I make a face and start. Pulling out the gauze and irrigating the wound with a bit of saline.
Sherlock               As he pulls back my brain clicks back online, having taken a little sly holiday it seems. My arms and legs release him, rolling quickly away to stand gracefully and adjust my jacket, clearing my throat, "I was concerned when you ignored me, so I went to the bars to see if I could find information about your date"
Rosie      "Is Unca Myca and Unca Gayg not a popper famly cause the don't have rings or bees or a puppy?"
Sherlock               Half rolling off the low bed I stand, stretching, the wincing as a button pops off my tightly stretched shirt, "Oh."
Sherlock               Wrinkling my nose I'm about to argue, when I remember I have to take my own clothes off anyway and change for bed, sitting up and slithering off the bed to head for the bathroom. As I'm dampening a flannel I call out, "Since you're no longer angry at me I'm going to borrow your t-shirt for bed once more."
James Morgan            "He won't go even though you want to? Friends do those kinds of things for each other.  You can tell me it's none of my business but, is this friend of yours a friend or a more than friend?"
Greg                      "Hey, it's alright, just take deep breaths." I said soothingly when he grabbed my arm and I half crouched so he could keep his eyes on me while John finished with the bandages. I multitasked in watching him and John, smiling at Mycroft now and again.
I put the shower onto a warmer temperature, using a shower gel that had just been in the tray when I arrived. I’d been smoothing down my chest, my hand soon wrapping around myself and I let out a sigh of relief where my other hand went to the wall.
Greg                      "Great. I'm guessing you won't tell me who were meant to be looking after either? It's all been a bit of a secret…" I say when we start moving again and I wasn't really looking for anything while I was in America but it wouldn't hurt to flirt a little. Get him on side.
Greg                      I pulled myself back from the photo and took it from him so I could take an accurate look. I skimmed the photo and then searched for smaller details, spotting in the mirror that there was only one placing when there was meant to be two.
Mycroft                 "I am sure Sherlock and John will have information soon." I laid my hand on his softly.
Greg                      "Please." I smiled tiredly, and I was still in scrubs, a blanket from one of the nurses around my shoulders as I leant forward for the coffee first rather than the toast. My stomach still felt a bit dodgy from yesterday.
James Morgan      Laughing hard I can't help but sputter a bit... "oh my god you are precious!! Have you read his blog?" I ask the consulting detective, "if so, you would know he was always yours. How you ever let me get even a chance with him... Oh my god." My hand is back on John's arm as I stage whisper "this is your friend? Smart one he is."
that's fine, I'm heading to the embassy with Mycroft. It's just this for an hour or so then I'm all yours. GL
John                      I reach a hand up to grasp his bicep. His tongue darts out to trace my lip and I open my mouth farther to let him in. My tongue reaches out to meet his.
Greg                      I took a deep breath when I got to my room, just concentrated on getting changed into my running stuff and I put music on quietly in the treadmill/gym room so I could still hear Mycroft if he needed me. I just needed something to clear my mind a bit
Sherlock               Stepping out a little I stick my hand up, a cab screeching to a halt besides us, "The key to this seems to be the chef. Hurry up." leaping into the taxi I give the address of the French Embassy.
Greg                      "I’m going to look the other way in terms of Nina, not sure what I’m going to do about James though." I finally decided, and I wouldn’t have to do this often back home, but Nina did save a life, poisoned a prisoner.
Sherlock               Out in Mycroft's office I huff, swinging open the door and gesturing to John to follow me in, pointing one way and not bothering to keep my voice down, "Look over there. The access codes for the security system must be somewhere here."
Mycroft                 "Perhaps not now, but things will settle down eventually. At least, I hope so." I grinned. I reached up and cupped his jaw, running my thumb along his cheek.
Rosie                     "Laaaa lalala la LA LA de daa la la LAAAAAAAA" Singing helps the pee come out.
Chief sup                     "You will be the bodyguard and head of security for the new man in this 'advisory' position." I used quotation marks since I don't have any idea about the real position and I'm made sure Greg knew this without a doubt. I want him back in one piece.
Mycroft                 "Someone like that can be... exceedingly difficult to find," I nod. I hadn't been involved with anyone since university, and even then, the dalliance was short-lived.
Mycroft                 I look at Greg with my typical exasperated-by-Sherlock look. "Another week? Or shall we deliver her to her Papa and Daddy in Scotland?" I grinned.
Mycroft                 I chuckled a little - I knew how irritating that could be, with my brother and John having pulled that scenario on me more than once. I slipped an arm around Greg's waist and moved closer to him, resting his head on my shoulder.
Greg                      I didn't know when I dropped off but I stirred around 5am to find a nurse checking over Mycroft’s vitals and no Sherlock. I guessed he'd gone home or not far from the hospital, ignoring my phone with messages from people at work just to have a moment alone with the elder Holmes brother.
John                      “I think it will be fine. Greg has... been feeling...” I trail off when I see James stop in front of us. All the blood drains from my face. “James... hey.” I stutter out.
Mycroft                 One of the security personnel motioned to me, telling me that James had gone running down the hall toward the service entrance. I took off in that direction, hoping Greg would follow. I slammed into the door, flinging it open, to see James standing next to a nondescript silver sedan, sorting through a set of keys.
Sherlock               I decide to take a bit of a chance, sitting down beside him on the bed, "I watched you at the museum. Just for a few moments. I couldn't collect enough data to determine if it was a date or not."
Greg                      "I think I'm gonna start planning it now and we can execute it when you're fit again." I chuckled at the smirk on his face, feeling a great relief to get that off my chest.
Mycroft                 I took another sip, letting the pleasant warm soothe the ache in my chest. "Vengeance is almost as dangerous to the heart as love is. You would do well to remember that.”  I sat heavily in my leather chair
Greg                      I got changed into a thin white shirt with cream-coloured trousers and a jacket to match, managing to find a nearby coffee shop for me and Mycroft to have a hot drink got our 8am meeting. I knocked softly, waiting for a minute before entering.
Sherlock               Waving a hand by my head I pull out the doors, thumbing through them casually, "Not really. This is British soil, the embassy. We're British so technically we're fine." slamming the cabinet shut I glare around the room
Greg                      "What was that for?" I smiled softly when he pulled back and his hands had dropped to my shoulders. Id not expected it after how I'd acted earlier.
Greg                      "No. All he said was that they'd be heading up to Scotland, so I assumed it was just overnight." I said as I walked through, taking off the apron I'd been wearing and hung it on the door as I went in.
Greg                      I moaned and gripped the hand I was holding to the bed, my hips starting to rock to find the right rhythm for me. My heart was pounding in my ears and I only just registered Mycroft’s hand coming off my cock to guide my hips even more. It was only once before that I'd been this open with anyone and I'd regretted that to this day.
Mycroft                 His fingers in my hair gave me chills. I rested my free hand on his knee, and slowly slid it up his thigh
Mycroft                 My eyes had been fixed on my brother, when I heard a loud pop, and felt pain radiating through my rib cage. I looked down to see a rapidly-spreading crimson stain on my jacket, when a second wave of pain came, and my knees buckled. I crumpled to the ground like a rag doll.
Mycroft                 I put out my hand for Rosie to start, as Greg opened the bottle of hot pink polish for her with a grin.
Mycroft                 "Nothing. To. Worry about. I will have a talk with her.”  I kissed him chastely on the lips
Greg                      I was relieved when he kissed me again and as his hand moved to the back of my head, I lightly smoothed one of my hands over his chest while the other was put on the leg he'd crossed over when we'd sat down. It was just slow, gentle and very timid.
Mycroft                 I shrugged off Greg's hand, and continued reading, focusing grimly on the text. "There are references to her activities helping her to 'move up the ranks'... one assumes in some organization, though it isn't specified." It wasn't clear if the 'activities' were of a sexual nature, or otherwise. I put the letter down and picked up another - slightly more recent, and written in a different hand. "This letter is similar, although..." I blushed a little "... significantly more explicit."
Mycroft                 I chuckled, and rested my forehead on his as we swayed to the music while he sang along. I didn't know the song, but I liked his singing voice, and I appreciated his effort at bringing up my mood.
Greg                      I thought Mycroft seemed a bit on edge so I didn't think small task was the best, my eyes on the scenery mainly on the journey to the restaurant. I got out first while Mycroft spoke to the driver and opened the door for him like a true gentlemen would with a large grin.
Greg                      "Good. I was just making sure before we started." I dropped my eyes to my pastry, finishing it while Mycroft got up cautiously. I needed him to he completely honest with me.”
there's a thing called bisexuality Sherlock  and maybe he's just experimenting. Gathering data just like you do. GL
Mycroft                 "I'm FINE" I spat, slamming the door. I managed to slip out of my clothes, have a quick washup, and pull on pajamas with a minimum of pain, and climbed into bed.
James Morgan      I ran to Peter. "Peter!! Wake up!!" But he was already dead from a gunshot. I pay down his pocket to find the detonator and find his keys instead. He was always more than the careful that was needed and must've left the trigger in his car. I got up and snuck out the door while Holmes was standing over his bloody bodyguard.
Rosie                     "Will you dress up with me? Pretty hats and sparkles and all the stuff?" I remembered to use my Papa eyes when I asked.
John                      I re-enter the room, still in my pants, maybe a little damp, to see Sherlock wrapped in his coat on his bed. I slide up next to him. “Are you sure about this?”
Sherlock               Shuffling forwards a little I attempt to slide Bee under Mycroft's hand once more, sternly telling him, "Don't drop my daughter's toy again brother."
Sherlock               Staying back still I clutch Bee so tight his seams are in danger of popping, watching Mycroft's face with naked nervousness
Greg                      "Yeah, come on then Rosie. Let’s go see uncle Myc." I grin as I pick her up and I'd always wanted kids of my own, but Caroline never did. Rosie was the closest to that.
I won't ask you to keep Lestrade and Rosie safe brother. You're the only person, apart from John, I know is capable of doing so right now -SH
Greg                      "It's about a murder of a Ms. Smith... Were from the British embassy and we wanted to ask you a few questions about her last meal. What was requested, how you prepared the meal." I say as I sat down lightly and look over her body language.
Sherlock               Throwing my arms up I cry out, rather wounded with exaggerated hurt seeping out of every word, "FINE! I'll go and get the paperwork back and tell them to stop the process as my brother is a big drama queen who is enjoying being molested by quack doctors." with that I sweep my coat around myself and huff off out of the door
John                      “What? What are you doing?” I squeak a bit not expecting the embrace. Being this close, I can smell the alcohol on his breath. “You’ve been drinking again. You never drink.” I pull back from him a bit to search his face.
Greg                      "Well think of it this way, you'll have better lungs for longer and you'll save a lot of money," I said as I checked over the recipe again and added a bit of stock to the stew where it was still looking a bit meaty.
Greg                      I saw the warmth in his eyes and was taken back a little, my head nodding and I knew we had the rest of the afternoon off. "I hope I wasn't being too forward before. I didn't even know if you swung both ways." I said after a couple minutes of us walking in silence.
Mycroft                 "'Got a taxi' involves hailing a cab and paying for transportation, Sherlock. You stole a cab. Good thing Greg and I know nothing about that." I gave him a half smile.
Rosie                     "Who's dat? He gots funny hair". Unca Gayg is sooo comfy and 'cept for Daddy has bestest shoulders to lay my head on while snuggling.
Anthea                  "I believe the cleaners are finishing up" as I hear them start to pack up their things. "I need to get going as well, if there's nothing else?"
Sherlock               Rolling my eyes, I flip to another page, signing it, "It makes it almost too easy to forge. I'm not sure even John knows what his signature looks like."
My brother had relations with her at university. She seems to have caused significant damage to his heart. I fear even more damage will be done by the end of this -SH
Greg                      I did feel a lot better after using the treadmill and shower, my hair still a bit damp but I grinned from ear to ear when Rosie came running up to me. I put her on my hip, "When did you get here puddin'?" I asked.
Sherlock               Shaking my head, I give a grateful look to Lestrade, "She's just been told it may take up to two weeks. We're glad you're able to care for her for so long."
Sherlock               Shaking out my coat around me like a wounded bird I lift my chin, "Why him? Of all the people you could have chosen, why him? He's one of the good ones Mycroft. "
Sherlock               Leaning back in my seat I arch my fingers into my thinking pose, closing my eyes before speaking, "The truth. He'll know otherwise and be betrayed if either of us keeps anything from him." pausing, I glance at Lestrade then grin, slightly bitterly, "Well, you anyway. He expects me to keep things from him which is why he'll ask you and not me."  If they needed to talk to me, this couldn't be good news...
Greg                      I seemed to double blink at what he'd said, his thumb still stroking my cheek as I was trying to think of something to say. It was a huge comment, something that made my chest tighten and I was going to say something in return when Rosie came bustling back in crying.
Mycroft                 I watched Greg as he shuffled about the kitchen, moving as naturally as if he'd been there all his life. "I'm going to the garden for a bit," I said quietly, heading for the back door
Greg                      "Or maybe she was murdered because she knew something that she shouldn't have. It all seems very cloak-and-dagger. There's just too theories to narrow down at the moment." I said and didn't even bother trying to look over at what he was frowning at.
Greg                      I also asked Michael to send the take out upstairs when it arrived, asking them to just order the best pizza in town and to just bill me. I walked round to his suite door and knocked gently holding the letters with a few files.
Greg                      "I'm sure Rosie sleeps like her dads. Nothing would wake them." I said through a little air of breath and wrapped my arms around his head to keep myself still.
Greg                      "Sorta, I'm still getting used to a normal living pattern again." I smile softly up at him and after a few bites, I wasn't all that hungry and most of the time at the yard, I lived off banana chips and coffee.
Mycroft                 I slid my hands further up his thighs, brushing lightly across his half-hard cock. "That almost sounds like a challenge," I purred.
Rosie                     I fell asleep watching the flying bees and dreamed I was flying with them and there was a PapaBee and a DaddyBee and a HuddersBee and a GayBee and a MycaBee...
Mycroft                 With that smart remark, I stepped between Greg and Dillon, my hand flat against Dillon's chest. "Get. Out. Now." I growled, giving the younger man a firm shove, making him stumble a bit.
Mycroft                 I looked up, hearing a knock at the door. "Come in," I said, still staring out the darkening window.
John                      I sit on the edge of the bed, bouncing my leg nervously. Maybe he was in trouble. I should have never let him work the case alone. I look at my watch. 10:43pm. I bounce my leg some more.
Mycroft                 I woke up to find Greg snuggled up against me, his fingers running through my hair. "How long have you been awake?" I asked sleepily. "And what time is it?"
Greg                      "I expect Rosie will want to treat her Uncle Myc for his bruise." I chuckled as we kissed, and I refrained from moving against him, taking his good hand when he went to slide my jeans zipper down. I brought his hand up to my lips when I pulled back.
John                      I climb out of the cab and onto the pavement in front of Mycroft's house. I ring the bell.
Mycroft                 Turning off the soup on the stove, I pick up Sherlock's laptop and walk quietly into Rosie's room. "Her Papa, the stubborn git, wants to read to her". I grumbled opening the laptop and setting it on the bed stand
Greg                      "I’m trying." I whispered and reminded myself to breathe, lights and sirens going on as soon as we were onto a main road and we managed to get to the hospital in under 10 minutes. I knew Mycroft would have gotten there first and I parked the nearest to the door.
Greg                      "Amen to that. I bet building relationships is also more than just sticking your fingers into pies too." I nod and laughed out loud when he spat his drink all over his steak. I took another sip of my beer, knowing just how to play him.
Greg                      My mouth dropped when I spotted Peter and I was concerned that he'd been spying on Mycroft and me. My face went a nice shade of red, my lips trying to form a smile where I could just have the wrong idea. He could just be here for a date. "Small world, isn't it?" I said softly as we met in the middle of the hallway.
Greg                      I pulled his hips against me harshly so he knew I wasn't a pinky, my tongue sweeping into his mouth to dance with his own. He tasted of steak and a hint of the chewing gum mint he'd had on the way back. His lips were so soft and tender, and his hands were gentle with the hair on the back of my head.
Carlton                 It was like an old cartoon watching these two watch each other with their eyes full of big red heart shapes. "Forgive my presumptuousness sir," talking quietly to Mycroft so Greg and Rosie won't hear, "I understand it that this is all new for both of you, so it may be too early to be entertaining these thought, and while you may be the smartest man in the world, but you would be a complete idiot if you let that man out of your grasp. The way he looks and talked about you, I can tell he's yours but afraid. Be strong and let yourself be his as well." I then pause a second to watch Mycroft look away from Greg, swallowing back whatever emotions he was trying so hard to bottle up, and back to me before he responded.
Greg                      It was quite easy to finish the small garden, but I did have to wipe my head with the sweat that had formed, putting the lawnmower away and I had to take my shirt off once I'd started sorting out the dead flowers from the living ones. I merely chucked it on the freshly cut grass where I could pick it up later.
Greg                      "It's alright, let's go sort your breakfast out." I took Rosie’s hand and rubbed my face tiredly as we walked to the kitchen, Mycroft joining us at around 8am. We'd had breakfast, I'd had coffee and I'd let her sit in the living room watching a bee programme trying not to fall asleep.
Mycroft                 I looked at Greg sheepishly, and stubbed the cigarette out in a nearby planter. "Really, Lestrade... following me now?" I grumbled. This was worse than when Mummy caught Sherlock and I smoking on Christmas Day, and this time, I didn't have anyone to lay the blame on.
Greg                      "My mind knew that but..." I shrugged with a small smile.  It sounded stupid now with what had been going through my head at the time.
Mycroft                 "It's all in the file on my desk, Lestrade," I said, finishing my coffee and leaning back on the sofa to rest my aching head.
Greg                      "Not tonight but we will do all that. I promise... First, you need to make sure uncle Myc is resting, okay? His shoulder is still hurting, and I need someone to be a little doctor for me." I grin as I knelt down to her level and pointed at Mycroft
Sherlock               Yelling back at Lestrade when I see him answering his phone I snap, "Can you please not have phone sex in front of me right now. We have a murderer to catch."
Mycroft                 I sat up and stretched my arms overhead. "I suppose we should get out of bed, " swinging my legs over the side to get up, when Greg wrapped his arms around my waist.
John    “No, it’s alright. Um... sure. That would be... alright.” I say unsure. Maybe a day away from Sherlock would do me some good. He was doing fine on his own without me while I was in the conference all day. “We... ah... have a break... a day off on Wednesday.”
Surgeon                We will be moving him to ICU in a few minutes. He's sedated at the moment, and on a ventilator, but you can see him for a few minutes once he's been moved.
Peter Harkness    Glad to see Greg was turning the tables and taking an interest in me as well. A good sign. “Well, besides the baseball thing, my job keeps me pretty busy. I work with all the foreign embassies but tend to have one or two that take up most of my time. Current political climate being what it is here, they tend to put me on the...delicate relationship ones” I say trying to dance around the fact I was no fan of the current POTUS.
Sherlock               "You are both still under house protection, correct?" Lowering my phone I give Rosie another gentle smile, nodding, "We also miss you. So much."
Sherlock               Staring at the ceiling a moment, panting, I collect myself, then attempt to grab John, trying to pull him down and wrap all four limbs around him limpet style, "John!"
Mycroft                 I rolled my eyes. "John's right - you are a drama queen. That pint did not damage you. Consider it an early experiment."
Greg                      I slid my hand up his chest, stroking his skin as I watched his face. Watched his back arch, deciding it was genuine and not just forced. "Okay?" I asked when I'd gotten halfway into him and I stopped again where he was gripping onto my bicep.
Mycroft                 I saw the question on Greg's face as he knelt between my legs. I let my leg slip around his hip, pulling him toward me, and I leaned up to kiss him
Greg                      "If she knows that when what else does she know? I know she's not exactly going to be spreading it everywhere but it's not for her to know those things. They're private for a reason." I ranted a little and looked up at him when he tilted my chin to do so.
Greg                      "Nothing, I, just heard Rosie’s door and you need to be getting into bed anyway." I smiled softly as I got off his lap and helped him at least do his trousers up. I then helped him to his feet, trying to look tired.
Sherlock               Peering into the bag I frown, "Oh no. I may have forgot the princess hats little Rosie ."
Mycroft                 "One moment" I walked to the room, and handed a pair of trousers and a shirt to him. "You left these behind when you last stayed here."
Greg                      I put some music on low enough just so I could hear it but also so I could hear Mycroft if he needed me. I put the small knick-knacks away, singing quietly along to the music as I started making the sauce. I loved the size of Mycroft’s kitchen and knew I'd love cooking in here.
Mycroft                 I finally set down my paper, and looked at Sherlock, hunched over the clipboard. He was deflecting. "Sherlock..." I said with a warning in my tone.
Greg                      "That’s fair enough. Where did your interests lie?" I asked as I taped him up and stepped back to take my gloves off. I put the old bandages in a bag to put in into the bin, my eyes going back to him.
Mycroft                 "A man of many talents, then, I see. New Scotland Yard is lucky to have you." I laughed. I was finding it was easy to be around Lestrade - without even trying, he lifted my spirits a bit.
Greg                      "Yeah, and what else?" I chuckled with the grin on his face and I leant forward to brush our noses together lovingly. I finally felt like I could be myself and all with him.
that's just common sense. Would it be worth me talking to Mycroft when we make a journey to the Hungarian Embassy in a few hours? GL
John                      I snort. “I’m not desperate for sex. Maybe I’d like a break? Did you ever think of that? Some fun or some companionship with no strings attached? Maybe someone that pays attention to what I want for a change?”
Sherlock               Reaching Nina's door I produce my lockpicks once more, starting work on it, "If Smith did die accidently then there would have been no need to cover up the fact there was a second person there. I also accessed the kitchen records and cross referenced all the ingredients. They were all harmless and ones that Smith had eaten before." the lock clicks and I slip into Nina's flat, "There was no ingredient listed from Russia that could have arrived by post."
Maybe keep the private Smith emails away from my brother? I'm not sure he needs to know all the details of her life. -SH
John                      I shoot Sherlock a look. “Daddy always knows the things you don’t tell him, whether you know it or not.”
That's your department. I'm heading to the lab now. There's something off about these toxicology reports but I can't work out what. I may need time and to contact Molly Hooper. -SH
Mycroft                 So it was right to business. Good. "What you need to know, Lestrade, is that my predecessor was likely murdered. Her head of security was either grossly inept, or complicit. When I signed on as temporary liaison, I requested the best available person to act as my personal head of security. The Chief Superintendent sent you."
James Morgan      "How do you feel about deep fried bacon?" The look of shock was priceless.  "I'm kidding."
Greg                      I hear the connection click off so head back to the kitchen, just standing in the doorway. "I’m gonna get into bed myself, did you need anything before I do?" I asked softly.
Mycroft                 "'Too far' would have been making a phone call and having him taken away in cuffs. You merely exerted your authority. Quite effectively, I think" I said, pressing him against the worktop, and kissing his neck.
Mycroft     "It was our pleasure," I replied with a smile, watching as Rosie fluttered toward the waiting cab
Mycroft                 I sat back on the sofa, looking through a few more of the handwritten letters. Each from a different sender, someone with whom Willa had been intimate. Some letters were dated only a few weeks apart. "She was... busy." I choked out, setting down the last letter. "She was apparently involved in some organization, and moved up the ranks quickly. The letters stop when she moved into the Embassy - she must have resorted to e-mail by then."
John                      “I don’t know. I... are you asking?” I swallow hard. I had been answering honestly. I had been thinking about what it would like to be with a man. Maybe this was the test run I needed.
Mycroft                 I looked up at John standing next to me. He seemed relieved. My eyes drifted around the room and was able to make it out Sherlock standing by the window.
Nina Boucher      "Okay," I begin taking a deep breath. "Willa's date that night was James Morgan, from the Department of Foreign Affairs." Judging by the look on Greg and Sherlock's faces, they were already aware of who James was. "But like I said, he had nothing to do with her death. Willa had apparently been trying to kill him. And he was as shocked as I was about her trying to kill him. We could only guess that she had become paranoid about him figuring out she was a spy, or maybe because she discovered James was about to blow open her involvement in US government she had no business being involved with. Either way, we decided we couldn't afford to have him implicated, so we acted quickly. After we took his place setting back to the kitchen, I snuck James out the back door of the embassy and made sure no one saw us. Then I went to Brad's office and cleared the security logs and footage of James being there that night. After that I went back to the kitchen and washed the dishes James had used and made sure it looked like Willa had dined alone. And then I went home."
John                      “I think the anesthesia for his throat might be wearing off.” Mycroft tried to reach for the tube. “No, leave it. Just hang on a minute.”
John                      “I know, this is a confusing for me.... can I be honest with you?” I reach over and put my hand on his thigh.
Mycroft                 I was rather alarmed at the look on his face. "You look like you've had a fright. Sit down." I patted the bed beside me.
Sherlock               Rolling my eyes, I nod to Lestrade, taking the coffee but not drinking it, instead striding off, "Come Gavin. We have a small window to see my brother."
Dillon                    Nodding, I keep working his arm, around in circles now, before pausing, "Ohhhh what's this?" my gaze fixes on the bruise on his other shoulder. "I didn't know you had any damage to that shoulder too Mr. Holmes."
Sherlock               I stare out the window for a period of around five boring minutes before sticking my nose into my phone again, letting the silence stretch between us broken only by small huffs from me
John                      He moans into my mouth and that only encourages me more. I push him back onto the bed and run my hand up and over his shoulder inside his coat.
Sherlock               Eagerly nodding I stand, waving the teapot, "See. He needs the full service. The one you said you'll give the Queen when you meet her."
Mycroft                 "Then trust me when I tell you that there is nothing about you that will frighten me away." I reached across the table and took his hand gently.
I stumbled on a rivet when I went to move away a bit. In trying to catch myself I fall across John’s lap. I hold on to his neck as he looks down at me trying not to laugh at my clumsiness. Sally chooses that moment to take another picture.
Greg                      "Got it." I said up to John, trying not to meet his eye too much and noticed Mycroft’s hand loosening from my arm when the doctor had finished. I stood up straighter then and was pushed back as John moved around.
Greg                      "I think I'm okay with my enthusiasm levels, I wouldn't want to be that age again." I smiled gratefully and leaned into him a little when he sat beside me with his own glass. I took a sip, letting it linger in my mouth.
Rosie                     Papa is sad. I stand on the seat next to him and pat his head and kiss his cheek like he does to me. "Dere dere. It's ok."
Mycroft                 "Really, Sherlock, you should stay home with your daughter. She and her Daddy need you home at night." I said, remembering my earlier conversation with John.
Mycroft                 I watched as he put his boxers back on. "Please stay..." I said quietly. "I would like you to stay... if you want to..."
Sherlock               My face crinkles into a mask of horror, "I don't have to admit any such thing John."
Greg                      "Because she was working with the Russians. She was a Russian Spy, Mycroft. she probably had this sudden opportunity because it was just her job moving around." I said with sad eyes, seeing he was struggling to maintain his composure.
Mycroft                 I lost myself in the feeling of Greg's calloused hands moving smoothly over my cock, sending shivers through me with every stroke. The sensation was even better than I had imagined. My breathing grew more ragged, and I grabbed his wrist, stilling him. "Stop... I..." I said, half groan and half whimper as I hauled myself back from the brink.
Greg                      I held back a full grin as Rosie snuggled up beside him and how Mycroft was with her. I folded my arms across my chest, feeling my heart swell with how cute it was.
Greg                      "And why does part of me not believe that? I know how hard it is, I've been trying to quit for the last 5 years and the furthest I've got is a month." I sighed as I motioned for him to sit down and my tone was still calm, but my face was stern.
Greg                      I leave the coffees on a small table before rushing towards the kitchen, gun down the back of my trousers and I could hear swearing more than anything in the French. I poked my head round the door and let a few cooks out where the commotion was going on
Mycroft                 I followed her to the kitchen, putting the last of the soup into a small bowl for her, and setting it on the table just as she settled onto her chair. I sat at the table across from her with my glass of water.
John                      I shake my head. He had kept talking when I was gone again. No idea what he was on about this time, I settle back into the pillows and try to will away the headache that was building. I wake up the next morning to find that Sherlock had climbed into bed next to me.
Sherlock               "I..." pausing, I watch his face, realising I've gone a little too far before murmuring, "Bit not good?"
Mycroft                 "I think Uncle Greg is tired tonight, and we will need his help. Why don't we do it after breakfast tomorrow?
Dillon                    Finally I step back, giggling a little at his huffs and moans of protest, "You're a noisy one aren't you. Bet your man loves that." I retrieve the weights and grin at him cheekily
Sending over barber with your scheduled physiotherapist at 9am. Assuming you both need haircuts by now. They have both been vetted & security detail will let them in.
Mycroft                 "I believe we are both rested and reasonably sober, yes?" I said with a mischievous gleam in my eye. I smoothed my hands along the buttons of his shirt slowly.
Business as usual. GL. Part of me had expected such a personal attachment behind all this but I went to the hospital anyway, got the toxicology reports along with everything else from the pathologist to head back to the embassy.
Pausing I frown, leaning to grab one of the photos from among the bunch and scanning it, then my eyes widen
Sherlock               Hopping off the bed I drop the flannel on the floor before heading straight for John's back again, digging through it to pull out his old army t-shirt, "I may not sleep."
Sherlock               Hailing a cab I huff, "I have her home address. Come on. Or did my brother suck all your brains out last night as well as other things?" without waiting for him I leap into the taxi and give an address
Greg                      "What are we going to tell Mycroft exactly?" I ask when we were halfway back, and I started nervously tapping my fingers against the steering wheel. I know he was going to be torn up about it.
Mycroft                 I paused, and pulled back a little, looking into his eyes. "Are you sure?" I asked.
Mycroft                 I shivered - the room felt surprisingly cold. I reached over and pulled the blanket off the sofa, tucking it around my legs. I was pretty sure I was going to end up falling asleep again; I was suddenly very tired.
Sherlock               Both brows rise as I sip my wine, watching my brother carefully, I've never seen him so animated and unsettled and it's slightly unnerving. "You knew this Willa from before." It's less a question, more a blunt statement.
Mycroft                 Closing my office door, I stopped and took a deep breath. My mind was positively racing. I had known Lestrade for a long time, though only in a professional capacity. Today's revelations put him in a whole new light, and a flattering one, at that. Looking over at the bar, I was suddenly glad Sherlock had taken the bourbon decanter - though my brain was willing, my stomach turned at the thought. I was being honest with Lestrade when I said I'd never considered a male partner. Perhaps I should reconsider...
Greg                      "Great. I did notice they had Doctor Who on the TV all day when I was in my room if you want to lose your virginity." I joked up at him, gently sipping from my tea cup while holding a small bit of cake in the other. I loved how red his face went with the double entendre.
Greg                      "Hang on then." I shuddered and just grabbed the box of extra-large condoms that had been put back into the basket and a random tube of lube that I grabbed first. I put some into my hand, smoothing it over my fingers as he got comfortable by the pillows again.
Greg                      "Come on Mycroft. Cum without me touching you, I'm so close." I purred as I kissed up to nibble at his earlobe and I could tell he was frustrated with the way his hips were bucking up against me. I loved the sound of skin on skin, our moans and grunts mixed into it.
Mycroft                 "I'm not complaining at all. Just correcting you. This will take at least an hour." I pulled him down to kiss him, my tongue parting his lips and exploring his mouth until we were both gasping for breath.
Rosie                     "Cause you love me, Gayg." Kisses "and I love you. Now, where's my cake? Papa says Myca always has cake."
Greg                      "Okay, what does she have to do with our investigation?" I asked as I tilted my head back and scanned the document briefly where he'd shoved it so close to my face.
Greg                      I followed him into the smaller hotel where Brad, ex head of security now worked on reception. I saw him speaking with a customer so had to hold sherlock back from just storming up to him.
Greg                      "Yeah, go for it. Show me a bit of DC." I shrugged and guessed I had nothing to lose. Sleeping with him would be a bad idea but having a good time otherwise wouldn't be off the books.
Greg                      "Now if you need anything, you say now or just shout while I'm in on kitchen, okay?" I said softly as I made sure he was comfortable in the chair and gave him a smile to say I wasn't totally stubborn.
Sherlock                       Narrowing my eyes I regard Mycroft carefully, then snap, "Just tell me. It will be worse if you keep secrets just for the sake of having secrets. Don't be a child Mycroft."
Mycroft                 I nodded quietly. Perhaps Greg and I should talk. It was obvious our relationship was more than physical, given his reaction to Dillon earlier. What, exactly, as he expecting?
Nina Boucher      "Oh I don't know exactly. It varied. Some nights I would stay to prep special deserts or other things for the next day's meals. If I recall correctly I stayed another hour or so that evening after I had finished putting everything in the dining room to get some meat into a marinade for the next day, so around 8 or so? But as I told the police, I didn't hear anything as that kitchen is quite a way down the hallway from the dining room."
Greg                      "Yes. And you've read Rebecca how many times before?" I asked lightly to break the awkward silence and had looked in Anthea’s notes to when he was due medication.
Peter Harkness    We walked faster back to the Embassy than when we walked away from it, Greg smoking his cigarette while I double checked my emails and made sure nothing needed my attention. It was a silent walk back by mutual understanding and not awkward at all. Just a few glances at each other with desire in both our eyes. We walked in the Embassy and I nodded at Michael as I led the unfamiliar way back to Greg’s suite for him.
