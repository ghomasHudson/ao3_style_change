“I just don’t know what to do next. You’re all Winchesters, but I’m not. I’m a Kline. But, also not.”
Dean only let them ride in hollow silence for a few moments before calling out to Jack to wake him. He was the navigator after all. His gut was the only thing pointing them where to go.
, of all people.
“So, do you have it?” Betty asked. They shared blank faces as she continued, “The book. Hand over the book. Wow. Slower than they look.”
“Alright, well, that's a good thing, 'cause the man had no love to give... Not to you, not to me, not to... humanity. You see that now, right?” Lucifer told his brother.
“So, you are him,” Sam said, enraptured.
“Uh... not a group project,” ** Betty told them as she pushed past them into the room before slamming the door in their faces.
“Yeah,” Lucifer agreed.
The rest of the world stood vacant.
“Who is she?” Dean demanded. Why the hell would she be a token of good faith? Especially if she were dangerous enough to need binding?
“You okay?” Sam asked Dean as he moved away from Betty.
“Hey, guys. Enjoying a little alone time?” he asked.
“I – what?” Dean chanced a look in the mirror.
“Okay, the end of God is in the special book, and if you give Betty the book, Betty can read it. Understand?” Betty said. Dean wanted to shout
The desire had flitted in and out of his thoughts since, but in the last two or three years, it had taken up permanent residence in his heart. He wanted to be done. He wanted him and Sam and Cas on a beach somewhere drinking girly drinks with umbrellas in them. Jack, too, once Dean had come round to the idea of having the kid around. And he had decided, once they were done with God, once they beat that hurdle, that he was calling it quits. He’d paid more than his fair share of dues and he was done.
“In the story Lucifer and I played out, Father asked us to love humanity before him. In its telling, my brother chose to love God instead of humanity and was cast out. Thus, I chose humanity. But that was never the truth, was it? Lucifer chose to exalt his love for our Father by declaring that humanity was lesser. I chose to love my father by obeying his rules. In truth, we both chose to love our father more than humanity. We were opposites not in choice, but in presentation. The surface level, you see.
“Huh,” was all the reply Sam gave before walking in the front door. Despite being the one who called for them to rest, Dean found himself reluctant to move. Out here, he could pretend, just for a moment, that the world was all right. A shitty motel on the outskirts of some small town with no traffic any time of day, but especially at night.
Instead of making any of the nasty comments on the tip of his tongue, he followed as Sam made his way to one of the storage rooms. It was probably where he had put God’s book after Michael’s failed attempt to open it.
In a blink, Betty was holding Death’s scythe and wearing the ring.
“Dean?” Sam asked, confusion strumming through his voice as Dean remained silent. He stared at Dean, having only noticed Cas’ absence from Jack’s question.
“Relax. I'm not giving him shotgun,” Dean told him. After a moment’s consideration he continued, “Unless you're cool with that.”
“Jack, I’m sorry.” ** There was nothing else to say. Dean couldn’t even look the kid in the eye, wasn’t sure he would ever be able to. He walked away without another word.
“Wow. Look at that. I mean, she's got the whole Death starter kit going with the decoder ring. Isn't that awesome? And that, whatever that is. Yeah. I'm good, right?” Lucifer was way too excited for Dean’s taste.
Michael started glowing with force of his powers as he tried to pry the book apart. Dean remained unsurprised when the book stayed closed and Michael powered down with an, “I'm sorry.”**
“I'm not sure. But I feel it,”** Jack insisted.
Focusing on his exhaustion rather than the assurance that Michael had either just contacted Chuck or intended to, Dean said, “I hope so. He's been in there a long time. Oh. Why don't you ask him yourself.” He hadn’t slept in basically a week – it wasn’t difficult.
“It wasn’t Billie. It was Chuck,” Dean informed him, voice clipped. He had been so certain it was Billie; he hadn’t hardly stopped to consider the possibility that he was wrong. How could he have been so stupid? Billie had wanted to set the worlds to what she considered right, but she hadn’t had the power to do it then. She still needed God’s power to do it – that was the reason she was trying to kill Chuck. She needed his power to reset the universe. Without it, she never could have done this. How could he have missed it?
“That’s what I thought you said.” To Carmen, Dean repeated with a smirk, “We’ve been classified as slow payers. Isn’t that great?” Into the phone he said, “I thought you guys were really into that sort of thing.”
Not a half hour later, Dean was sitting on the couch watching tv and shovelling some store-bought cherry pie into his mouth when the doorbell rang. He knew Amara would be there. He hadn’t seen or heard Cas since he’d gotten up, so he let her in and they did what they always did, barely talking. She teased him that she was sick of getting it from behind, but Dean ignored her. He didn’t want to look at her face, and he wanted to get done quickly in case Cas showed up all of a sudden. The house was small.
So there he was on a Wednesday afternoon fucking his wife’s best friend doggy style and thinking about nothing else when his “Communication Breakdown” ringtone blasted from the livingroom. “Shit,” he grunted, pulling out abruptly. Amara gave a grunt of her own and huffed, “Goddamit, Dean, what the fuck?” as he ran naked down the hall to grab his phone. He answered and barked out his name to the automated voice on the other end. Only one more week of house arrest and then Dean could get the ankle bracelet off and stop answering these damn monitoring phone calls at random times.
Back in the dining area, a plate with two small burritos sat on the table, and across from it Cas paused in his own burrito-eating to look up at Dean. It was the first time since before the accident that ordinary food looked and smelled appealing.
“I miss the dude too,” he said. The truth was he’d only recently started thinking about Benny again, regretting the lost friendship.
“Is right here good?” Carmen said, jarring him from his light doze.
Dean guided Cas’s cock toward his ass. “Do it, baby, do it, “ he chanted. “I’m here, I’m right here. Want it,” he whispered, almost to himself.
He had peed in a bottle at some point in the hospital, but didn’t need to now. Despite the throbbing in his head, he felt pleasantly hollowed out, like his body had no needs. “Nah,” he said, eyes closed. Once he was down to his underwear and under the covers, Carmen left him to sleep in the dim room, and that’s where he stayed for the next two days.
Dean figured he should tell her about losing his job. “Well, you might want to hang on to that glad feeling,” he said, “cause I got fired today.”
“You want me to leave?” Cas said, sounding like a nineteen-year-old again.
“No,” Dean answered, taking another sip.
“Let’s get him to the car,” Carmen said, breaking the spell, as she rolled him out to the parking lot. Cas’s arms were strong and solid as he eased Dean into the passenger seat and buckled him in without a word.
In his bedroom he felt unaccountably out of breath and flustered. He didn’t know why the kid unnerved him so much. Sure, Cas was hot, but he was a weirdo, a weirdo who seemed to be able to detect something in Dean that he didn’t know about himself. Or maybe Dean was just projecting that onto Cas and Cas meant nothing by it. He couldn’t figure out what that conversation was even about, but it left him thinking uncomfortably about who he was. He put on an AC/DC shirt and retreated to his sanctuary, the garage.
“No, he’s not. Look at him!” Amara insisted.
“She just wouldn’t stop,” Carmen said to Benny, “and I was in the middle of this crisis with Dean, and I guess I got upset and yelled at her. And then I threw her out, and then today, she wouldn’t even look at me.”
“Come on, come on,” Amara urged, pulling Dean up to stand.
Cas’s earnestness made Dean smile, and he could certainly relate to his nomadic childhood. “So you didn’t graduate high school? Not going to college?”
Carmen directed her attention back at Dean and looked down at his crotch. “Ok, what happened to your pants?” she asked, exasperated.
There was another long pause and then Sam asked, “And what, you’re gay now?”
Dean closed his eyes for a little while. The others murmured to each other, and when Dean opened his eyes, Benny and Amara were standing up, looking at Dean, who still sat on the floor, as if he were a zoo animal.
“Don’t care,” Cas answered, pulling him back in.
“Huh?” he said over the rumble of the engine and pulled one of the stethoscope plugs out of his ear.
He looked into her wet, brown eyes. “I’m sorry, Carmen,” he said.
“It’s weird, Dean,” she said. She looked at Cas as if he should contribute to the conversation, but Cas just placidly returned her gaze.
Cas looked at him with wide eyes. “Um, what’s happening right now?”
“Well, tell her to come in here,” Dean said, knowing he’d have to talk Carmen down, but not caring because he himself was feeling good and fuzzy and he didn’t want his wife feeling bad.
Carmen approached the bed. “Come on,” she said, moving the bedding aside so Dean could slide his legs out and sit up. “You ok?” she asked, her tone gentling.
“Huh,” Sam said, sounding like maybe he was rethinking his whole reality. “Carmen must be pretty pissed at you sleeping with her brother,” he mused as if thinking aloud. “She must be pissed at him too. I mean, I don’t want to judge, Dean, but that situation sounds kind of fucked up.”
The darkness below ground swept all the beauty of the world above away from him and he felt all the pain he’d denied himself his whole life. He saw his father’s face twisted in grief and anger and felt his blows, but then his father started to weep and Dean reached out to him to comfort and be comforted. “I love you and I hate you, Dad,” he said.
“Yeah, yeah,” Sam agreed. “That’d be great.”
Dean didn’t know what was happening, but he knew it was right. He went in for another kiss, this time less chaste, and Cas became bolder as well, opening his mouth to let Dean’s tongue in.
making the pain spike in Dean’s head. He felt like he needed to be horizontal in the immediate future or he would just fold over toward the dashboard of the little Kia. “What am I supposed to do? They said that he’s stable and they can’t do anything more without insurance!” She seemed near tears.
“Mmm,” Cas moaned against Dean’s lips, but then pulled away with a disappointed grunt. Holding Dean by the hips at arm’s length, he said, “There is nothing more that I’d rather do than make love to you, but it will have to wait.”
Cas perked up as if he’d been waiting for someone to ask him about the subject. “I’ve read quite a lot about it,” he said. “There is some free land in Kansas. You just have to fill out an application and pay about $500. I’d have to learn how to build a house, but I already have plans for growing a large garden and some fruit trees. I would dehydrate and can a lot of the produce, keep chickens, and have an apiary.” He got a dreamy look in his eyes. “I’m particularly interested in bee-keeping.”
“Let’s just go,” Amara said, starting to pull at his arms, but Dean didn’t want to get up. His body was already sinking, sinking into the couch.
Sam slapped Dean on the back again, now that it was really over, and Dean pulled him into a hug. “Thanks for keeping me from being a felon, Sammy,” Dean said.
So on a Thursday morning when Carmen asked, “Is it ok if Amara and Benny come over tonight?” Dean said, “Sure, why not?”
The next morning, Dean got out of bed after Carmen had already gone to work. He was feeling a bit steadier and got dressed in some sweats, including a thick blue hoodie he hadn’t worn for a long time. The fleece lining felt so nice on his skin.
Dean thought of his own dad, how despite everything he’d done wrong, he still claimed him as his own. He still loved him. After a long silence, Dean said, “Sorry I freaked out.”
“I’ll be back in a little while,” she said and walked toward her car, a crappy Kia, an abomination that one of her many sisters sold her dirt cheap. Dean could barely look at the thing.
Carmen was speechless for a moment, clearly not expecting that response and braced for a fight. “Um, I’m still at Amara and Benny’s. We all cried it out and everything.” She sniffed and averted her eyes. “Bonded over being mad at you.”
“At what?” Dean asked.
“I think I was sent here to save you from yourself,” Cas said.
Cas seemed beyond speech, a beatific smile on his face, muscles straining, skin slick with sweat. He came first, pulsing cum across Dean’s belly, but didn’t stop bouncing on Dean’s dick, speeding up until Dean felt his orgasm crest, shooting up into Cas as his thrusts became erratic. He threw his arm across his own face and bit down to stifle the noises he couldn’t help himself from making.
Dean smiled at Cas's enthusiasm, adding the potato cubes to the boiling pot. “Take some classes then,” he said, washing off some carrots. He wondered how Cas was going to pay for it considering they were saving for their future, and Dean still had legal and medical debt to pay off, but he agreed with Bobby that Cas was smart enough to pursue anything he wanted.
And that’s how Dean ended up as a twenty-eight-year-old college student, making sure his jeans covered his ankle bracelet so he didn’t alarm all the innocent eighteen-year-olds. The KU campus had always seemed a million miles away to Dean even though he had lived only ten minutes from it his entire adult life. It didn’t seem like a place that had anything to do with him, but while helping prep Cas for the GED, Cas kept telling Dean how smart he was and how he should go to college too. Every step Cas took towards enrolling in college, he dragged Dean along with him. After an advisor explained that they had to take prerequisites before taking all of those cool upper division classes, they ended up in back-to-back Saturday English 101 and Math 101 classes together, both taught by grad students younger than Dean.
“Nah, I’m alright, man,” Sam said, rummaging through his suitcase. “It can wait till the morning.”
He shrugged again.
They cleaned up and got dressed, and Cas prepared a feast of round vegetables and fruits for Dean: peas, radishes, cherry tomatoes, blueberries, an orange, and of course, a beet. Dean felt a pang of guilt, thinking of how Carmen had bought anything round she could think of. Cas offered to cook some of it, but Dean said he only wanted to eat them raw. Cas made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for himself and watched Dean work through all the colorful spheres on his plate.
The doctor looked at Dean. “Did you have to go to the bathroom before you passed out?” she asked.
Dean asked, “But your mom’s still there?”
The next day while Carmen and Cas were at work, Dean shuffled into the bathroom and unwrapped the bandage from around his head. Underneath there was a piece of gauze over the wound. He peeled away the gauze to reveal a two-inch gash slightly diagonal and right of center high on his forehead. It looked a little like a narrow canyon with raised edges and a depression running up the middle with a neat line of pale stitches holding it together. It was still raw-looking, but he could tell it was starting to heal.
“You and your weird fucking family,” Dean grumbled before they both settled in to sleep. He drifted off trying not to think of the hot dude just one room over with those bright blue eyes.
“I’ll think about it,” Dean said, “but I don’t have that kind of money.”
A strong hand gripped his arm tight, branding him, and hauled him from the flames. His mother’s face was replaced with his blue-eyed angel’s. One of the few things he remembered his mother saying to him as a child was “Angels are watching over you,” and here he was. Dean’s melted skin fell away leaving him fresh and raw. He scrambled into Cas’s arms and curled into his chest, sobbing. “You’re safe Dean,” Cas assured him, stroking his head and rocking him like a newborn. “You’re safe.”
He yanked off his tie and walked maybe ten blocks to Amara’s salon. It was already six thirty and getting dark by the time he got there. Through the glass he saw her chattering away on her phone headset while she opened her mail.
Cas, who had moved his chair right up against Dean’s, gave him a kiss on the cheek. “Yes, it’s truly beautiful,” he agreed.
The tv started to sound as if it were echoing in his head. Dean began to stand, causing Amara’s hand to slide off. “Doesn’t that seem loud?” he asked, moving toward the tv and crouching down. He couldn’t think very clearly due to the rising ache in his head and he poked at the buttons on the side of the flatscreen ineffectually. “Can someone help me?” he pleaded.
Dean examined the capsules. They looked like something you’d get at the drugstore. “So you don’t think I’d flip out or anything?” he asked.
The smooth and spicy beans and cheese, the soft tortilla, and the tangy salsa seemed to light up his mouth. He took his time chewing, tasting, and swallowing, and made a few appreciative sighs and groans. After finishing his last bite, he looked up to see that Cas was watching him, eyebrows raised.
Dean sat up and practically choked on his tongue. “What!?”
“Wow,” Dean said, trying to imagine a reality where he wasn’t afraid to confront his past. His life felt now as if it were divided into before cracking his head open, and after that. In the before, he’d used booze, weed, sex, and Baby to avoid thinking about any of the crap he’d been through, but in the after he felt both better and worse. Everything seemed suffused with light now; it was like he was already starting to know what it felt like to“see the beauty in everything,” as Cas had said. But like he’d told Cas before, it was like all the darkness he’d been shoving down his whole life was right around the corner, and it scared him. He didn’t know what would happen when he ran into it.
“I love you!” she said louder.
“Do you need a shower?” Dean asked. “Cause the bathroom out here only has a john and a sink,” he added pointing a thumb at the tiny hallway bathroom.
Sam just shrugged and kept eating. Despite his salad-eating ways, Sammy could pack it away when he was hungry. Dean was glad he’d gotten two large pizzas.
“For what?” Dean asked, gesturing with his cigarette, his voice rising. “Sounds like you had no responsibilities, and you still don’t. You can run around, sleep in your tent, come back here and wash your underwear. You’re as free as they come.”
He could hear Cas’s alarm, but it sounded far away and Dean couldn’t see anything through the white fog surrounding him. Then he breathed and breathed again, gulping air until he could see and hear again, and his breath slowed.
“Sometimes, yeah,” Dean agreed. “I’ve never said this shit. Carmen only knows a little bit of it.”
“Oh, of course she did,” Dean groaned, closing his eyes again. “She probably stayed up all night. Probably had Benny blow the rest of that coke up her ass.”
“She is,” Carmen said. “She already gave us enough.”
Before Dean could reply, Cas was holding his chin in his palm and tilting Dean’s face up. “That looks painful,” he mused. He kept examining the wound, his hand solid presence that suffused Dean’s skin with warmth.
Back at home that night at the kitchen table, after eating the chicken dinner Carmen had made, Dean finished off his beer and broke the news to her. “So guess what?” he said. Cas rarely ate dinner with them for some reason, maybe because Dean always gave him a hard time.
“You are blind, Carmen,” Cas said, “and you are going to lose him.”
Carmen and Benny chuckled at that, and Amara placed her hand on his knee. She earnestly said, “Of course you are.”
Cas tilted his head. “Where’s the bandage?” he asked.
“You know it’s a lot more than that,” Carmen continued.
“It’s a cult?” Dean asked. He thought of zombie-like people drinking poisoned Kool Aid.
“Cool,” Dean said to himself as he sat up in the nest and stretched his arms overhead, feeling the space between each vertebra lengthen. He stood and saw he was still wearing the jeans and tshirt from the night before, but didn’t have shoes on. He stank. He was hungry.
While they hugged, Dean made eye contact with Amara and she said, “Benny misses you, Dean.”
Lee looked stunned. “What?”
“Thank you, cher,” Benny said politely to Carmen before grabbing a handful of Chex mix.
Since Amara had refused to give him money, Dean hadn’t even thought of asking anyone again. “Maybe,” Dean hedged. He had a lot to think about.
Dean thought about it and then said, “Yeah, I think so.”
“You don’t have to be sorry,” Cas said, his eyes hooded. Dean felt tired too. “We don’t have to do...that.” Cas looked over Dean’s shoulder toward his ass.
Cas laughed too, shook his head, said, “No,” and then retreated back into the house.
“Alright then,” Crowley said, standing up. Dean stood up too and let Crowley usher him out the office door.
Such a punishment would have devastated Dean in the past, but it all sounded fine by him now. He’d have to get to know the bus routes a lot better. “No, your Honor,” he answered meekly.
“Hey, here he is,” Benny said, at the same time Amara said, “Hey, Dean!” and they smiled widely at him. The smiles faltered a bit when Dean just perched on the edge of his seat gazing at them without a word. They seemed to him like benign visitors from a neighboring planet.
“Beautiful,” Cas answered, taking a step closer. “I’d kiss you if you weren’t married to my sister.”
They argued over who would carry the suitcase, with Sam winning out because he said Dean looked like his skinny arms couldn’t handle it. Dean slung his arm over Sam’s broad shoulders and turned him toward the house, but Sam stopped in his tracks when he saw Cas at the doorway. Cas looked more vulnerable than Dean had ever seen him, his arms crossed over his chest, his eyes wide and feet bare. It hadn’t occurred to Dean that Cas would be nervous about meeting Sam.
Cas turned first and looked at Dean. “You didn’t have to do that, Dean. I…”
Dean hadn’t realized he was thirsty until he saw and heard the ice cubes clinking in the outstretched glass. He dropped the sledgehammer and approached Cas, becoming aware of how sweaty and filthy he was. Cas unabashedly looked him up and down as he took the glass, their fingers brushing together. Dean took a long drink as Cas watched. “I think I am hungry,” Dean said with surprise.
“Fine people don’t eat raw beets like they’re apples,” Carmen insisted, some of the anger returning to her voice.
“Have you ever tried meditating?” Cas asked out of nowhere.
The look on her face shifted to guilt, as if she was hiding something. “How much?” she asked as she sauntered back behind the reception desk.
“Because she’s my employer. I can’t do that,” she answered in a bored voice since she’d said it at least three times already.
“Thank you.”
Dean was standing over the kitchen sink repeatedly squeezing out a soapy sponge when they arrived later that night. Carmen had complained he never did the dishes, so he was making a show of it while she got ready in the bedroom.
A couple of days passed, and Dean tried to get a read on Cas, as he now called him. The dude didn’t speak unless spoken to, and spent a lot of his time reading in the backyard, or doing what looked like meditating, sitting cross-legged on the couch with his eyes closed. It was possible he’d been looking for a job when Dean was at work, but who knew? Carmen sometimes had quiet conversations with him that Dean didn’t ask about. He didn’t want to act like he cared, but the truth was he felt kind of left out. He couldn’t tell if it was because Carmen was spending too much time with Cas, or Cas was spending too much time with Carmen, but he didn’t examine it too closely.
“Probably?” Carmen asked, incredulous. “Well, why’d he pee himself?”
With the house empty, Dean felt restless and bothered, like something was buzzing under his skin. He usually had a no drinking before noon rule, but he took a couple of good slugs of the Jack he kept under the sink and started banging back beers while he surveyed Baby in the garage. He pulled her out into the driveway, and checked under the hood, for what he didn’t know. He felt like he was sinking under some kind of slick surface, and he sucked down a couple more beers to keep himself afloat. Why was he carrying on this thing with Amara? Weren’t his hookups with strangers enough to scratch that itch he could never quite get rid of? How would Carmen react if she knew? Did he care if she forgave him?
“Because,” Sam said, nodding at where Jack stood behind Chuck, “You lose.” If Chuck had been human, he would have fallen over with how quickly he whipped around.
Dean could only nod in agreement, trying to choke back tears. He thought he had cried enough before, in the immediate after and the drive. Thought that he had managed to stuff the loss so deep inside that nothing could touch the emptiness that was keeping him afloat. It was clearly just wishful thinking. He managed to put it aside long enough to go through the motions before they gave up and packed it in. But what else was there to do now in this empty world?
Slowly, carefully, Jack began to carve a “J” into the table beneath Sam’s initials. When it was complete, he hesitated.
It was the only thing Dean could cling to, still drowning in grief.
After a moment, Sam said, “I did this. We could have just given Chuck what he wanted, you know, his grand finale. But I resisted. I pulled the thread. I thought we could beat this game, do it better. We tried to rewrite him, and the whole world paid the price.”
“And Adam?” Sam asked.
Michael laughed.
The sound of a throat clearing drew all of their attention to the archway where Betty now stood with the book in her hands. “Asshats. I have opened the book.”
“Yeah, well. Sam seems like he wants to.”
“See for yourself,” Sam said as he threw down open Death book in front of Chuck.
In Cawker City, not far from the lake, Dean pulled over along the street. He glanced at the gas station, realizing it was the same place they had stopped on their way to find Michael. The place they found Miracle. As they got out of the Impala, Dean ran his hands over the gleaming metal. Jack must have cleaned her up for him as they drove.
, he thought.
Sam shifted in his sleep, silencing Michael. It seemed he wants this conversation to belong to just the two of them. Dean was grateful for that. He expected that, wherever this was going, he didn’t want Sam to be a part of it. After a moment, Michael began again.
There had been moments in the past where Dean had given up, given in. But those moments had always come with the belief that he didn’t have the strength to resist. To do better. To stand and up fight. Before, it was because he had crumbled under the responsibilities someone else had placed on his shoulders. He had only ever managed to recover because Sam or Cas had stood beside him and taken some of the weight themselves. But this, here and now? No one could withstand it. There was no point in trying to.
Miracle whimpered. Dean turned back to him and said, “Don't worry about him. He'll warm up to you. Maybe we'll let you sleep in his room.” Sam loved dogs. He was just being a dick right now. Doing something he never would have imagined, Dean opened the door and invited the dog up into the Impala. “Here we go. Good boy.”
“And you beat the crap out of us. Releasing all kinds of power. God power. Jack absorbed it all. It made him...Well, it made him unstoppable.” Dean couldn’t help the pride that flowed through him, knowing how capable Jack was.
As soon as they arrived back at the bunker, Sam was on his feet, a sense of urgency pushing him into the bunker before everyone else. By the time the rest of them made it to the war room, Sam had disappeared down the hall. A moment later, he came back into the room calling out, ** “Alright, Michael. Here's the book we've been telling you about.”
Dean wondered if there would ever be a being in this universe that he looked at with such reverence. He’d never been impressed by the angels. Never been impressed by Chuck. Sure, they had superpowers, but what did that matter? Dean’s .45 and his give ‘em hell attitude had gotten him this far. For so much of his life, he’d placed his father on that pedestal – a god in his own right, untouchable. It had taken so long for Dean to realize just how fragile that pedestal was. Putting someone else upon its shattered remains would be useless.
“Oh, this is Betty. Betty... Betty, say hi.” Her response was muffled by the fabric.  Dean rolled his eyes as Lucifer continued, “No, no, no. Say hi to the boys. Just getting it straight. Oh, did I mention Betty is a reaper? I'm doing a fly-by, right? Okay. I'll say that again. Betty is a reaper.” Dean shared a look with his brother. What the hell did Betty being a reaper have to do with anything? It did at least explain why Lucifer had her bound.
, Dean thought scathingly. He had once experienced his own corrective procedure that had nothing to the invasion Cas had gone through over and over again. That Cas had continued to overcome it was further proof that Cas had more strength than Dean ever could.
Jack couldn’t really understand how so much of what Dean and Sam accomplished had been because of the support of other people. They killed Yellow Eyes because of Bobby and Ellen and Jo. Stopped the Devil with them and Cas, too. They had Bobby and Cas and Kevin to help with the Leviathan. More often than not, when it was just one or the both of them, they fucked everything up. Dean started the Apocalypse. Sam drank demon blood, for fuck’s sake, and set Lucifer free. Closing the gates of hell? Dean refused to let his brother die to save the world. Any time – every time – it was just the two of them dealing with the big shit, they fucked it up.
“I want you to understand that you, Dean Winchester, were created to be everything I needed. You were, instead, everything he needed.”
“Everywhere.”
The lake Sam picked, Waconda, was located not far from the bunker, close enough to the middle of the land mass to convince Michael it was a place that held untapped power. Clear, blue, beautiful. It looked like a good beach to retire on.
“I never spent much time on Earth. I was... curious about the perception of God and Heaven,” Michael replied.
“I'm around. I'll be in every drop of falling rain, every speck of dust that the wind blows, and in the sand, in the rocks, and the sea,” Jack replied.
“Yeah, yeah. Jack’s fine. Well. As fine as can be. Fuck, Dean.”
Dean briefly glanced in the mirror as he wondered if Michael was reading his thoughts and allowing him these moments. A quick quirk of the lips told Dean all he needed to know.
Dean didn’t see the difference.
Groaning as he pushed himself to his feet Dean says, “Well, I guess we’ve got nothing better to do. Let’s go check it out.”
“Dean, do you think we’re it? All that’s left?” Sam asked as Dean turned his attention to the spout still pouring beer. He pulled on the handle, turning it off.
“See ya, Jack.”** Sam said. Dean couldn’t manage to say anything as he moved back into his baby. Part of him wanted to drop his head against the wheel and sob. The whole world was back online. The whole world was alive again. And still, he wanted to sob. Because his whole world was gone. But, he knew there was nothing he could do about it right now, and crying would end with Sam trying comfort him. But until Sam knew the whole truth, Dean wouldn’t be able to suffer his pity without more guilt overwhelming him.
“Dean?” Jack’s voice was unexpectedly close. Turning around, a beer in hand, Dean saw him just across the table.
“Yeah?”
“We can what? There's nothing left, Dean. No one left to save. Everybody's gone.” Dean could feel Sam’s desperation. It was suffocating.
“Yeah.”
“Not this time, kid. Chuck’s the only player on the board. He’s got all the juice. We’ve just got us.”
“Son. And, listen, I appreciate the heads-up about all this,” Chuck said as he approached Michael.
“I miss him,” Jack said. As if it were the easiest thing in the world to say. Dean barely refrained from flinching, too lost in his own grief, in the power of a name.
“Hey, what happened to Amara when Chuck...” Sam asked, breaking Dean from his reverie.
“You're gonna let a dog sit in the Impala?” Sam asked, clearly shocked. Dean didn’t necessarily hate all dogs, but he would be the first to admit that he was generally not a fan. But this? Miracle wasn’t just a dog. He was the last living creature on earth besides them. That had to mean something. Maybe they actually could fix this.
Chuck panicked as he flipped through the blank pages, “There's nothing there.”
“We won,” Dean said.
“What did Hester say?” The words rang out in Dean’s head as clearly as if they had just been spoken,
“I feel terrific,” Dean responded as he moved to his knees beside the table, the empty bottles clinking around him. Sam watched silently as Dean managed to sit at the table and open his computer. Dean was grateful for the several empty beer bottles and a half empty bottle of whiskey still sitting on the table, preventing Sam from seeing the name newly carved into the table. He would see it eventually, but Dean needed time to regroup before then. Luckily, before Sam could say anything else, Jack entered the library still in his pajamas.
Turning to his brother, Dean chuckled darkly, “Yeah. You, me, Jack.”  There wasn’t much else to say or do. They had come into this stupid little bar to see if maybe, somehow, there were still people inside. But of course, man-made construction had no hold over the power of God himself.
, he thought,
Still, reality was lingering off in a corner, just enough to remind him it was there but not enough to grab all of his attention. Because, in truth, the devastation of the rest of the planet was something he could put on hold for the moment. He could wait until he was with his brother, wait until it needed to be the most pressing thing. Instead, those last moments were still playing in his head. He knew his face would be red and his voice raw when he found Sam and Jack. But, for probably the first time in his life, he didn’t care. He just let the tears wash over him.
“Cas – Cas, uh. He thought, he thought that saving me would mean we could save the world, but I can’t—we can’t. There’s
The door to the Impala squeaked as Dean let it fall shut behind him. He wandered into the middle of the crossroads. These streets were just as empty as the ones had he taken to get here. A few parked cars were littered about the sidelines, and one was crashed into the pole. But no breath, no life.
“Hey, Jack.” Chuck approached his grandson and snapped his fingers once. When nothing happened, he tried again. And again. And again and again, each successive attempt quicker than the last. Nothing happened.
“Fascinating,” Lucifer whispered. The word drew Dean’s attention, and he felt a flicker of satisfaction at having his thoughts confirmed. The Empty didn’t bring Lucifer back to kill Chuck; Chuck brought him back to manipulate them all into getting Death’s book. Not that it mattered at this point.
“Look man, I don’t know. It’s just a guess at this point. Maybe there’s something different about soul energy? I don’t know. But dammit, we saw it happen with the plants, and we just saw it happen with Lucifer and Michael. I don’t know what the rules are on this thing, but I’m guessing if he can absorb an archangel’s energy, he can absorb God’s, too.”
Dean watched through the window as Jack finally made his way to the entrance of the bar. He and Sam shared a confused glance after watching the plants outside wither and die as Jack walked past them. Not knowing what it meant, Dean turned and poured himself a glass of beer. It was a miracle his hands weren’t shaking. He was running on frayed nerves and desperation. He could still feel Billie’s hand clench around his heart with every beat. There wasn’t really much room left in him for new surprises. So as long as Jack’s thing was something he could ignore, he was going to.
“And no one cares. And no one remembers you. You're just forgotten.” With his normal dramatic flare, Sam turned away from Chuck. Dean and Jack followed his lead, ignoring Chuck’s pleas as they got in the Impala and drove away. Dean could hear the words echo for just a moment before they were lost to the roar of the engine and the whip of the wind.
“Uh, I wouldn't exactly say ‘trust,’” Dean said. Dean was certain, now more than ever, that Lucifer was not here to help them. He had to have been sent by Chuck. And he clearly was trying to get out what the book said about Chuck’s ending.
The phone buzzed again beside him. It wasn’t until he heard the echo of the vibration that Dean realized he was sobbing. Hearing the sounds intermingled and suddenly he could feel it. The tears racing down his face. His chest heaving. His body choking on its own grief.
“Thus,” Michael said after a moment of silence, “Castiel made himself Lucifer’s true foil, not I. Both were created to love and obey God. Both were told to love humanity above all else. Lucifer fell for his refusal to obey our father’s command. Castiel fell because he followed our father’s command perfectly. When he fell, Lucifer poisoned the world. He sought to destroy that which he blamed for his sufferings. When Castiel fell, he wanted to save the world. He sought to end humanity’s sufferings.”
“And?” Sam asked. Dean didn’t really care about the answer. Michael had clearly given up, much the same as they had. What was the point in discussing the perception humanity had of a creator that had since disintegrated them?
**“Let's light it up,” Dean said as Sam stood back from the bowls. He watched Sam strike match and drop it into the middle bowl. A blaze of bright blue light burst from each of three bowls, shooting directly into sky in large beams. After a moment, the bowls suddenly bounced apart, the beams disappearing as the magic broke.
“But I thought you said I wasn’t family.”
As they returned to Jack’s side, Dean saw Miracle running around. That would be enough for now. He could focus on the hope right now. The rest could be dealt with tomorrow.
hear him. If Cas could come back from the Empty, then –
“What do you mean?” Jack asked.
The first time he had really thought about retiring, about getting out instead of going out, had been after a long hunt a few years back. He couldn’t remember now when exactly it was, just that it was sometime after Metatron had falsely told them Sam could survive closing the gates. There was a slight hope that if they could do it – really do it – then that would be enough. They had done their duty, given more than enough to this damn life. He thought about what the three of them might do after – if Sam might go back to school, maybe he and Cas could travel the country for fun for once. But then life reared its ugly head and Sam was dying and Cas wanted to seal all the angels in Heaven with him. That cut short any real hope Dean had for retirement.
“It's a hell of a time to bail. You got a lot of people counting on you, people with questions. They're gonna need answers.” Dean tried not to let his fear, his sadness turn to anger. It didn’t work.
“Wow! Way to treat a pal.” Lucifer’s voice echoed up at him from down below in the war room. That one moment was enough for him to get into the goddamn bunker.
“Wassup?” Dean barely opened the door before he tried slamming it back in Lucifer’s face.
The sun was still out by the time they got back, just past seven. Sam went straight to his room. Dean would have told him to eat dinner, but that would mean forcing the same on himself. He’d barely managed to choke down a protein bar in the car. Heading straight for the mini fridge of beer, Dean had a brief moment where he wondered if he could starve to death, if he could drink himself to death. Of course, Chuck would never let that happen. Dean would suffer from it, live just on the brink of death, but Chuck would never let him die. He wanted them all to suffer endlessly.
“And that's what to believe in. Well... I'm really as close as this,” Jack said, placing a hand over his heart. With a final, “Goodbye,” Jack waved and walked away. Dean watched him disappear into nothing with a heart full of grief. He hadn’t thought there was more room for it, but it certainly wasn’t the first time he’d been wrong.
**“Everyone’s gone,” Sam remarked. He and Jack must have encountered the same. “You see anybody on the way here?”
Eventually, though, Sam and Jack fell asleep. As the car fell into silence, Dean closed his eyes for a moment, just to let the words echo in his head again,
“I mean, maybe Dean. But then why wouldn’t it affect us?” Sam asked.
“Did you know? About the deal he made?” The words slipped past his lips before he even registered they had crossed his mind. Instead of the anger, the hardness he would have expected, the words were quiet, soft. Because it didn’t really matter what the answer was, not now. It didn’t matter if Jack knew about the deal because Jack could never have known what Cas felt, could never have known what would make Cas that happy, could never have known that Cas would choose the happiness to call the Empty.
“Father,” Michael said. Dean looked over at Jack who gave him a quick nod. It was working.
Now here he was, standing outside the home he grew up in, wondering how he could have ever dreamt of retirement when he knew how much God and the Angels and Fate had planned for him before he was ever born. The day he learned that he was Michael’s vessel – or perhaps the day he learned his mother had been a hunter – should have been the final nail in the coffin for any dreams of retirement. But still, he had allowed himself to think that one day his work would be done. That one day, he could hang up his boots, stick his toes in the sand, and spend his days relaxing with his family. That one day he would be able to see a world full of monsters and decide that he didn’t need to be the one to fight them all.
Dean tried to pull on Sam’s hope. Tried to let it run through him. In the end, all he managed was an arm around his shoulder and a simple, “Finally free.”**
“Yeah, this is what Pop wanted to get his hands on. Hmm. Did I say that out loud? Yeah, Pop was the one who let me out of the Empty. I'm sort of the new favorite now. What did Dad say about you? Oh, yeah! "Mikey's a cuck." You're a cuck.” Dean and Sam moved towards him, but Lucifer waved his hand and slammed them back against the bookshelves.
Trying not to let Jack see his hands shake, Dean said, “I-Hang on. Wait here.” He moved quickly to his bedroom where he kept a spare pocketknife. Jack tilted his head in confusion as Dean lifted the knife in victory when he returned.
**”So, where does this leave us? We need that book open and we're out of options,” Sam asked.
But then, he noticed Jack. Jack, who seemed to have been impacted by some of the energy from the fight. Dean started to get to his feet so he could check on him.
You do what you do because Dad said so. You do what you do because it’s the right thing to do. They are one and the same, but how much easier the world was to navigate when you could approach them as different things. How much easier the world was because everyone believed there was a distinction somewhere along the line.
“Dean! Are you okay? What happened?”
finally stopped running through his mind. An impossible prayer left unanswered for too long. Eventually, his phone had stopped ringing. Dean wasn’t sure whether it was because Sam had given up or the battery had died.
“Alright, kid, you really think you can pull this off?” he asked.
“So, this is how it ends. My book.”
“Are you hiding out from your dad?” Dean asked. It seemed the only reasonable explanation. Who else would Michael have need to take refuge from?
“What?”
“You gonna come back with us to the bunker?” Sam’s question shocked Dean.
Michael, it turned out, did not go lie down. Instead, he went to sit in the kitchen. When Dean entered the kitchen, he asked **“How you doing? You okay?”
“Daddy's boy,” Dean said, even as the memories of his own actions rolled through his mind like the thunder. How desperate he had been to make himself in his own father’s image. The music. The car. Hell, even the jacket. The day his father had given it to him had been the greatest moment in his life – as though it were physical evidence of his father’s approval. And, once John disappeared, how he had done everything in his power to follow in his father’s footsteps – to be the man John wanted him to be. To keep worshiping the ground he walked on, despite everything he had done to Dean, to Sam.
That was the last thought he had before Sam called out to him the next morning.
Neither spoke while Dean got dressed. They both knew exactly where their hearts were at, what choice remained. They left Jack at the hotel, still sleeping. Dean knew the kid wouldn’t approve of what they were about to do, but there was nothing else to do. Luckily, the turn of the engine didn’t wake him, and soon they were pulling out towards the abandoned warehouse district of the town.
**“Hey,” Dean said, pointing out the TV airing an empty football field to Sam, “It brings a whole new meaning to the term ‘sudden death.’” As though some sort of dark humor was going to be the thing that lifted them out of this.
“’It?’” Michael asked.
“Yes, we heard you. So what?” Sam demanded.
“Poor bastard never caught a break,” Dean said. Adam was another reason he tried to keep the past in the past. He had so many regrets in his life, but Adam was one of the biggest. It was because of Dean he became Michael’s vessel in the first place, because of Dean he was left to rot in the cage, on several occasions. The first, of course. Then when Death had offered to save a soul and Dean chose Sam. Then every time over the last few years when they had dealt the cage and only chose to think about Lucifer.
“And those answers will be in each of them. Maybe not today, but... someday. People don't need to pray to me or to sacrifice to me. They just need to know that I'm already a part of them and to trust in that. I won't be hands on. Chuck put himself in the story. That was his mistake. But I learned from you and my mother and Castiel that... when people have to be their best... they can be.” And wasn’t that the kicker? Castiel had believed in Dean until the very end. He had taught Jack to believe in humanity the same way. So how could Dean ask him to ignore that? How could Dean be that selfish? He swallowed as he looked away, trying not to let the memory of Cas sweep away this final moment with his son.
“Isn’t that all you’ve had before?”
“What?” Sam asked.
“What?” Sam demanded. Jack merely looked curious. So, Dean began laying it out, quietly. Just in case Michael was still close by.
“You're dead,” Dean said from his position by the door. He couldn’t convince his feet to move. This was exactly the kind of cruelty that Dean should have expected from Chuck.
Dean didn’t know how long he sat there, long after the tears had dried, and his breaths had evened out. His muscles were stiff and his back ached from sitting so long on the concrete. The words,
“Jack it is then.” Soon enough, his name was fully carved into the table. Jack handed Dean back the knife and blew his breath over the table to scatter the wood carvings. They both stared at the table and the letters that claimed it as their own.
“And it's in here... all that you want. I know how God ends.,” she replied.
In the last few years, he’d started to really feel like the bunker was home. It was a place he, Sam, Cas, and eventually Jack, could all come back to. Each with their own rooms, their own space. Dean had made the Deancave, though someone else had joined him as often as not. He got to cook homemade meals with real food – he didn’t entirely hate rabbit food when he could spruce it up a bit in his kitchen with meat and spices or dressings.
“We'll give you what you want,” Sam said.
So this is more what I imagine the table would look like. It's not perfect (my photoshop skills are rudimentary), but generally.
“Mm. Yeah. Alright, team. I don't want to bring ants to your picnic, but that ain't gonna cut it. Okay, think about it. If the Empty pulled me off the bench, it's 'cause the Winchester charm ain't enough, right?” Despite knowing that was exactly what Lucifer intended, his constant movement set Dean’s teeth on edge.  “And I did anticipate a little bit of pushback, so I did bring a token of good faith. Voilà,” Lucifer finished with attempt at a flourish. A woman in bindings appeared before them.
“Let’s go home,” he said.
“Mm-hmm. To everyone that we lost along the way,” Dean managed to say.
even if it did nothing but bring Dean the comfort of familiarity. Cas hadn’t always responded when Dean called to him. And, for the moment, Dean could pretend it was just the same. The nightmares and the rest of it could be stuffed down deep for another day.
“What... What did you do?” Chuck whimpered.
Dean carried three bowls filled with the ingredients Sam needed for his big spell as he got out of the dusty Impala. Sam carried with him the open Death book. They made their way quietly across the beach. Dean watched as Sam prepared whatever it was he was doing. Dean had no idea what the spell was actually going to do, but he knew it was going to do whatever Sam wanted.
“Dean, we can’t give up.” Jack’s voice felt like a bucket of ice being dropped over him.
“I understand, Dean.” And that was definitely the tone Jack used when he thought he understood, but really did not. It was cowardly, but Dean let the rest of his stupid speech die on his tongue. Giving a sharp nod, he stepped out of the Impala. A moment later Sam and Jack joined him on the sidewalk.
They drove in silence, neither having anything to say. Both knew what they needed to do. It felt almost like a miracle that he and Sammy finally agreed on the best way to fix a problem of epic proportions. Dean wasn’t sure they ever had before, each always certain his plan was best. As he pulled to a stop just outside of some large warehouse, they both got out of the Impala.
“Sammy?” he demanded as soon as the call connected.
With the gas tank refueling—and thoughts of living forever in isolation and not dying simply because Chuck didn’t want him to tucked into the overstuffed box labeled “Things not to think about,”—Dean made his way to the bathroom. As he neared, he heard a soft whimper. Turning around, he saw a fluffy dog. The shock drove him to his knees.
Well. Almost.
made his dad proud. And it still wasn’t going to be enough.
“What?”
“Michael.” As Michael had described, Dean had been made for him. Dean’s emotional relationship with his father was akin to Michael’s. Only now, Dean had figured out that it was pretty fucked up. There was still a lot of shit to dig through that he mostly pushed to the back of his mind because what was the point when the man was dead? Still. Dean knew Michael’s relationship with Chuck. That was the whole point of being his Sword-with-a-capital-S, wasn’t it? Michael, he was certain, was going to crawl back to Chuck. The hurt of asking for Lucifer’s help would be too great, and he would want to redeem himself in his father’s eyes. So, Dean began to explain his idea to Jack and Sam.
“Of course not.” The reply was too quick, and Michael seemed to realize it. He took a breath and continued, “I mean, he clearly he knows the God Book could be lethal to him. But it's actually fairly useless without Death to read it.”
“I’m aware of that,” Carmen said.
Benny led him out to the driveway where his vintage Ford pickup, the one Dean had helped him find and restore, was parked, and then looked around as if he wanted to make sure no one was listening.
“Work. Are you up to going in tomorrow, maybe a half day?” she asked.
Dean wiped his sticky hand on Cas’s pants and laughed. “And you’re nineteen,” he said fondly.
She stood in front of him and put a hand on his shoulder, examining his face. “Are you ok?” she asked. When he didn’t answer, she said, “You need to put that bandage back on, ok? They said to keep it on for three days.” Then she kissed him on the mouth, the first time they had kissed in a while, certainly since the accident. It felt like nothing. “Try to get some sun before it goes down.”
Cas gave him a look of understanding and gestured toward the kitchen. “Are you hungry? I was making bean burritos if you want one.” He stopped and tilted his head. “Or would you like all of the round foods again?”
“Sammy, you there?” Dean asked.
That was a shock to Dean. He’d always pictured Sam on top of the world in California, living out his dreams. “Why, Sammy?” he asked, gripping his little brother’s sizable shoulder. “You ok?”
“Yeah, Sam,” Dean reiterated.
“Um, ok,” Carmen said, looking at Amara as if she would know what was going on.
Dean whispered, “It needed some air,” as Carmen entered the house and found them there.
Dean was starting to fade. His head hurt like a bitch and he was nauseated. “Bicycle. Car,” was all he managed before saying, “Think I’m gonna hurl.”
Dean thought of what that would be like, his mother still being alive but turning her back on him. “Sorry man,” was all he could offer.
Carmen hesitated and then said to Amara, “No, he says he’s ok.”
“Ok,” Dean said easily.
“Mhm…” Dean agreed, closing his eyes and relishing in the warmth radiating back and forth between them through their clothes and skin like mild electric current. Behind his eyelids he saw himself from above, except he was some kind of otherworldly creature growing out of the Earth, his body covered in swirls of many colors. Was he awake or was he asleep? His legs became a long tail covered in iridescent scales of blue and green. His arms became fiery wings. Over and over, streams of color poured out of the top of his head and turned in on themselves like a kaleidoscope. And through it all Dean felt at peace.
“I don’t think anything is wrong,” Cas said.
“Y’know, Dean,” she said, throwing up her hands, “that’s the first opinion about anything you’ve had since you cracked your head. So y’know what. I’m gonna go stay with Amara and Benny, and you two lovebirds stay here together.” With that she stormed into the bedroom, made some noise in there, came back out holding a bulging quilted bag, left the house, and slammed the front door behind her. Dean and Cas stayed frozen in place until they heard her start up the Kia and drive away.
Dean shook his head, smiling again at Cas’s penchant for talking like an old guy. “Ok, lover boy, go take care of those plants,” he said and shoved Cas toward the front door. “We’ll continue this later.”
Dean could ordinarily inhale half a pizza in a matter of minutes, but the pungent meat and cheese smells and the sight of all of it only caused him to wrinkle his nose in disgust. “No thank you,” he said. The TV was on a baseball game, but the images seemed blurred, the sound distorted and blaring.
When he opened his eyes, Cas was just staring at him, bemused. Dean felt defensive. “You don’t believe me, do you?” he said, even though he was, in fact, lying and had never changed lanes or gone 125 with his eyes closed.
He looked to Carmen. “Carmen, it’s ok.”
“No,” he answered as if resigned. “Like I said, no traditional schooling.”
“Ok, well let me know if you need anything,” Dean said, turning to go.
“It’s ok Dean,” Cas answered for her. He seemed unperturbed by being thrown out. “I have a tent. It’s a clear night. I’ll find a spot.”
Sam asked him a bunch of questions about his DUI, his financial situation, about whether he wanted to legally separate from Carmen or get divorced, what Carmen wanted, and about his car. It was a lot, and Dean didn’t have answers for most of it, but he somehow knew things would be ok. Sam thought maybe they could get Dean’s sentence reduced to a misdemeanor if he did some kind of counseling and community service. Dean hadn’t had a drink since his accident, but he figured counseling would be better than a huge fine and being branded a felon, and maybe he could use the time to continue to get his head straight, even though he was already sober and had never been an alcoholic the way their dad had been, at least he didn’t think so.
Dean just shrugged.
Dean got some clean sheets and they put the nest back in order. Cas handed Dean a tall glass of water and one capsule. Dean drank it down as Cass fluffed up the pillows. “It might take a little while for you to feel anything,” Cas said. He pointed at the nest. “You might want to lie down and just relax, or you might want to move around. Just do whatever feels right.”
“I’m actually not too upset about it,” Dean assured her. He’d been thinking about what he could do now that he wouldn’t be going to work. “I think this may be a good opportunity to break up the concrete in the backyard. We could do something better with it. We could grow some vegetables, and I could make a bird bath or something with the broken pieces.” Dean could see it all in his mind. “Doesn’t that sound like a good idea?”
“Jealous,” Charlie fake coughed into the crook of her elbow.
Dean chuckled again, shaking his head. “I know you probably can’t believe I’m saying this,” he said, “but I think maybe you’re right.” He’d already started talking to Cas about his feelings, so maybe he was ready to talk to a pro.
“Nah, you keep it,” he said to Lee.
Dean twisted the greens off one of the beets, washed it off at the sink, and took a big bite out of it. The sweet and tangy flavor burst in his mouth like fireworks. He leaned his elbows on the counter and watched Carmen and Benny as he chewed slowly, savoring.
Dean stopped his pacing and leaned back against the wall, taking a hard look at Cas, who had paused in his bacon-eating and sat there like a buddha, serene as can be. “You didn’t answer my question,” Dean said. “Why were you at that ashram?”
“Are you hungry, Sam?” Cas asked, breaking the silence. “You’ve had a long trip. We could order a pizza?”
Cas talking about “millenia” and “recent studies” made Dean want to kiss all the smooth skin he could access, so they didn’t talk for a while as Dean mapped Cas’s body with his mouth. Even a twenty-year-old couldn’t get past half-mast so recently after coming twice in one night, so he returned to kissing Cas’s plush lips again.
“If I tell my boss what it’s about, she’ll let me have time off,” Sam said, ignoring Dean’s reaction, “so yeah, I’ll come out there. Do you have a court appointed attorney?”
Dean had assembled the smoothed out, interlocking pieces of concrete into an asymmetrical pedestal topped by a wide basin which looked both rough-hewn and modern. He had used some of the leftover lichen-colored paint from when he’d painted the house two years ago and some sandpaper to give it a distressed look. He was pretty pleased with the result. There were even a couple of sparrows perched on it taking a drink. “Thanks, Sam,” he said.
Dean Winchester had mastered living on the surface. He kept his mind on the tangible shit--cars and women, beer and bong hits. He was almost finished with house arrest for a DUI, he still had his loyal wife, Carmen, his job, and his house, so what more was there to think about? Somewhere between watching his mom burn up with their house when he was four years old and his dad beating the crap out of him after catching him jerking off to his Indiana Jones poster when he was thirteen, Dean learned not to think or feel too much, to party hard, and to laugh in the face of all the crappy shit in life. Before his little brother Sam had left for Stanford six years ago, he’d asked Dean with that pained, whiny voice he got sometimes, “Are you really going to go through life never dealing with your feelings about anything?” and Dean in his boozy haze had answered, “Yup.”
Just then, the back door opened and in came Cas, clearly just off his bike, red-cheeked and wind-swept. He looked super-cute, Dean thought, and then choked a bit on his beer.
So once he’d had his ankle bracelet removed and got the ignition interlock device installed, Baby had an honored place in the corner of their apartment complex’s parking lot, usually covered with a tarp. They took her out for a spin on occasion to show off her sleek black lines and keep her purring, but they still took the bus or rode their bikes (Dean had his own now) to work or classes depending on the weather. And Cas insisted they either rent an electric car or take the train to California for the visit they were planning in the summer.
“Do you even know what they do to cars in impound?” he called down the hallway after her.
“He is unusual, Sammy,” Dean said, not sure what Sam was getting at. To Dean, Cas was unusual in all the best ways. “He’s had an unusual life.”
“For awhile?” Dean asked, getting more curious about the ashram.
After they had been on the road for a few silent minutes, Cas said from the back seat, “Are you sure he shouldn’t still be in the hospital? Do they not need to run more tests or have him seen by a specialist?”
Number 4 made Dean feel a little bad. He hadn’t talked to Charlie, Lee, or Ash since he got fired, and he hadn’t talked to Benny since their conversation in the driveway. He couldn’t ask them for money when he hadn’t even spoken to them recently.
The voice said without inflection, “I’m sorry sir. There is nothing I can do to extend the limit.”
Carmen turned to Cas and called, “Cas, you wanna come meet Amara and Benny?”
Despite the ache in his jaw, Dean was relieved it was out in the open. “I’m sorry, Carmen. And I’m sorry to Amara too,” he said in all sincerity. “Where are you staying?”
Benny laughed and Carmen glared at Dean.
“Dean,” she said, placing a hand on his arm even though Benny was right there. “Your wife is having a meltdown in the bathroom.”
“You offering your services?” Dean chuckled.
“Ok, well we can’t hide from her forever,” Dean whispered back. “I mean, it was bound to happen.”
The first time Dean opened his eyes, he was blinded by pain. He thought maybe he heard a voice, but the knife through the center of his skull made it impossible to discern what he was hearing or seeing.
“Damn right you are, angel,” Dean said, bringing Cas in for a kiss with the hand not holding a knife.
“Ok?” Cas asked, sliding his finger in further and then stroking it in and out, pressing down just right on each stroke out, sending Dean into spasms of pleasure. Dean could only grunt and pant in reply. Cas licked and kissed at the back of Dean’s neck and then took an earlobe in his mouth as he added a second finger. Between the stroke of Cas’s fingers and the sucking on his ear, Dean turned into a quivering mass of sensation. He didn’t even want to touch his dick, afraid one touch would end it all.
Carmen ignored everything Dean had said and answered, “I’m gonna go talk to that asshole. You’ve made him more money in the years you’ve worked there than anyone else!”
Sam started moving forward again and extended his hand when he and Dean reached Cas. “You must be Cas,” Sam said, while Cas shook his hand.
Dean and Benny watched back-to-back episodes of their favorite show, Classic Speed, for a while, laughing and talking through it all. Dean got out his three-foot bong, the one he called Bertha, and the two of them laughed and talked louder and louder the more they smoked. Soon they weren’t even watching anymore and Dean was standing over the coffee table entertaining Benny by describing his ankle monitor experience between hits.
“Bobby said I could get financial aid and apply for scholarships,” Cas continued, as if reading Dean’s mind. “His son Daniel is a junior now, and Bobby said it hasn’t been that bad.”
Cas stood and collected their plates. Dean admired the lean sinews of his arms, the stubble on his face. Yeah, he was definitely still into Cas. Moving toward the sink, Cas said, “I’m going in to work now. Do you need anything before I go?”
Crowley appeared beside him, leaning against the doorframe. “Dean,” he said brightly, adjusting the lapels of his suit jacket. With his British accent and natty attire, Crowley contrasted sharply with his grease monkey employees. “I’ve been thinking. I know you were working hard before your…” He paused, wincing, and gestured at Dean’s bandage. “...accident. Meg told me about the Impala, and I know losing her must be akin to losing a limb. Let’s just go down to the impound and retrieve her.”
“Well, I’m sure we do somewhere,” he insisted, although he knew he was being illogical.
Dean considered that. “So I guess a raucous high school party where everyone was drunk and high doesn’t count?”
Cas reached for the lube, squeezed more out, and together they jerked Cas off. “Oh, Dean,” Cas moaned. “I want to fill you up. I’m going to fuck you now. Can I?”
“No, he’s real sweet and quiet,” Carmen said with a fond smile. “I guess he’ll stay until he gets a job or something.”
“Well, it’s good you’ve added some variety,” Cas said. “The peas are high in protein at least.”
He opened his eyes and he was in a coffin in pitch black, running out of air. He scratched frantically at the underside of the lid, getting nowhere, but then the lid was wrenched open and he saw his mother’s face. “I love you,” she said. “You are beautiful and good, and I love you, Dean.” Awash in her love, he reached out to her, thrusting his arm out of his own grave, but before she took his hand, they were both engulfed in scorching flames. Dean shrieked along with his mother.
Cas broke Dean’s gaze and turned to follow Carmen into the house. Dean sat on the step and continued sipping his ice water. Cas had left the sliding door open a crack, so he could hear Carmen inside say, “My husband’s out there destroying the patio and you’re eye-fucking each other like lovers and acting like nothing’s wrong. What the fuck, Cas?”
“Carmen, something has happened to Dean,” Cas continued in his same measured tone.
“Cas, I don’t know what’s happening to me. I’m calmer than I’ve ever been, but there’s stuff just like bubbling up in me lately,” he said into Cas’s neck. He described what his life had been like, how his mom died in a house fire that might have been his dad’s fault, how he carried baby Sammy out when he was still practically a baby himself, how he still dreamt about it. How he spent his whole childhood taking care of Sammy. How their dad was a crazy drunk and dragged them all over the place because he couldn’t hold on to a job and keep out of trouble. How he was always the new kid at school and couldn’t make friends. How the adults always thought he was trouble even before he did anything, and then he did shit just out of spite. He said things into Cas’s neck that he’d never said out loud before. “Dad hit me sometimes. A lot. And then he wasn’t there a lot.” Dean stopped sometimes to take some deep breaths of Cas’s clean scent, but the words continued to come out, soft and steady. “Sometimes there was no food, and sometimes Sammy’s shoes had holes, and I had to do shit. Sometimes I stole. Sometimes I turned tricks. And sometimes it got friggin’ bad, like real friggin’ bad.”
Dean slipped into his hooker persona from long ago. There was something liberating about doing it just to be funny. “Look I’m offering to do whatever, ok? You gotta read between the lines. I’m saying that I’ll let you fuck me, or I can fuck you. However you wanna do it...”
Cas nodded sadly. “Yes, I’ve come to believe that,” he said. “Chuck is manipulative, and they treat him like a deity.”
They looked at each other in silence for a long time, and that’s how Carmen found them when she got home, staring into each other’s eyes with silly grins on their faces.
Cas pulled Dean tighter into his side and tucked the blankets more closely around them. “Yes, Dean,” he reassured, stroking Dean’s hair. “I have tomorrow off work. I’ll be with you all day and night.”
“Jesus, Cas, of course I’m not sure!” Carmen yelled,
“No, I don’t know how it is,” Dean continued to rant. “Just keep your fucking foot light on the pedals for crissakes!” Dean stopped yelling abruptly when he saw someone, a man, in their driveway with a bike. He was haloed by their porch light and just stood there as they approached the house. “Who the fuck is that?”
He didn’t know why he wanted to do it, but he trusted Cas, and he had a new-found desire for some kind of understanding of whatever was going on inside him. He didn’t want to hide from himself anymore. “You would stay with me? Keep me from freaking out?” Dean whispered into the night air, fighting off sleep.
“It’s not,” Carmen insisted. “It’s not a good thing. Dean is sick.”
Amara crouched down beside Dean and pulled at him more insistently. “Come on, Dean. Let’s go,” she said, trying to get a good hold on Dean’s bicep as Dean weakly resisted.
The next morning, Carmen sat Dean at the table and wrapped a comforter around his shoulders as if he were sick. She plunked a plate of eggs, hash browns, sausage in front of him and said, “Eat.” Dean eyed the plate with distaste.
She started moving toward the bedroom. “Yeah, I’ll think about it,” she said, turning back and making sure he saw her sarcastic eye roll before she walked away.
Dean whirled around. “What?”
Cas retreated into the house, and Dean awkwardly mounted the bike and shifted his junk around a bit so he could sit comfortably. Cas watched him from the window with a small smile on his face, and Dean called out, “I can see you!” Cas retreated.
Cas didn’t talk like any nineteen-year-old Dean had ever heard. It was like someone who learned perfect English as a second language but hadn’t spoken to many native speakers. Dean grunted his assent, and Cas opened the window beside the end table, and then backed out of the room, watching Dean until he closed the door behind himself with a soft click.
He spent the rest of the day getting lost in the serene movements of different types of wildlife and dozing on and off on the couch. When Carmen got home, she seemed thrilled that he was out of bed. “Maybe you can get back to work soon,” she said with a hopeful raise of her eyebrows.
“Well, look at the happy couple!” Amara said with a broad smile, breaking the silence.
This time, they took his license and Baby away from him. Dean felt like they’d chopped off his arm. He’d almost cried in front of the judge. At least it was early enough in the day that he didn’t have to stay in jail overnight and they were letting him go pending bail and setting a court date. Dean descended the marble courthouse staircase late that afternoon to see both Carmen and Amara waiting for him at the bottom. He stopped midway down. “What the hell is she doing here?” he directed at Carmen, pointing at Amara, but he already knew.
“What the fuck, Cas?” Dean said, alarmed at the uncharacteristic move. He tried to pry Cas’s fingers out of their bruising grip.
“No, I’m fine,” Dean mumbled, his voice drifting somewhere above himself.
“Maybe you can ask your friends to pitch in, start a GoFundMe page or something,” Sam suggested. “Even if you didn’t want to keep her, you could sell her for a hell of a lot more than the cost to get her out of impound and pay your friends back.”
Cas looked to Dean, and it took a moment for him to realize that he’d have to order the pizza since Cas had no phone. By the time Dean had found his phone in the bedroom and done all the ordering, he returned to the living room to find Sam and Cas sitting on the couch talking, from what Dean could tell, about something called homestead laws. Cas looked genuinely curious, asking specific questions, and Sam seemed to warm up to Cas, giving patient explanations. Their voices faded into the background as Dean drank in the sight of the two dorks.
Several months after Dean had left and Carmen had sold the house, he and Cas were in the grocery store and Cas suddenly grabbed Dean’s upper arm and yanked him into the paper goods aisle.
“Where ya goin’?”
Dean rolled his eyes and looked at Benny. “Oh, right,” he said.
Dean slept in the next morning and woke up feeling alive and ready for anything. After getting dressed in his comfiest jeans and a t-shirt, and eating another beet for breakfast, he found his sledgehammer in the garage and surveyed the back patio. He decided to start in the middle and work his way out. Hoisting the hammer over his head and bringing it down woke up muscles he hadn’t used in a long time, and the smashing of concrete was incredibly satisfying.
“Do you know how many people wish they were like Dean?” Cas asked as if he hadn’t heard Carmen’s insult.
Dean shrugged. “It’s still in impound, I guess,” he said.
Carmen raised her hands in exasperation and dropped her fork with a clink. She let out a deep breath and stalked into the kitchen.
“I don’t know,” Carmen sighed. “I told you, his mom was a weird hippy. She sometimes paid me for babysitting with weed.”
“Can you tell me your name?” the doctor asked.
Dean released him, but before turning to go said,“‘Night bitch.”
“Thought you’d appreciate it,” Dean answered with his mouth full.
“What’re you wearing?” he repeated. Carmen glared at him the way she always did when he was being an asshole, and this was certainly one of those times.
“Anybody can be free,” Cas answered, unfazed, his eyes finding Dean’s once again.
Carmen was like a newborn fawn, stumbling a little on unsteady legs. It also looked like she’d been crying. Amara straightened her skirt and sat beside Benny who put his arm around her, while Carmen stepped into the kitchen and brought out a tray of snacks, placing it on the coffee table, and then sat in the chair across from the couch and studiously didn’t look at Dean.
Even Carmen chuckled at that.
Dean wished Carmen could see this as a new beginning as he did. “Carmen, it’s ok.”
He just shrugged and Cas’s smile grew wide enough to show his gums.
At some point in the second day, Dean cracked his eyes open to see Cas entering the room hesitantly, holding a plate of food. “Hello, Dean. Are you awake?” he whispered.
His dick was limp now and he felt like spending the rest of his day off alone with Baby, so back in the bedroom he pulled on his boxer briefs and said, “You should get back to work,” to Amara. She gave another little huff, but she knew when she’d been dismissed, so she grabbed all her clothes and stomped into the bathroom, slamming the door behind her. Carmen worked at Amara’s nail salon, so Dean and Amara had no trouble hooking up while Carmen and Amara’s husband, Benny, were at work. Dean had fucked other people pretty regularly throughout the ten years since he and Carmen had started dating in eleventh grade, but never more than one or two-time hookups. He’d been fucking Amara for almost six months now though. It was always her idea, and he just went with it. Why not? He cared about Carmen, but she was pretty vanilla in the sack due to all of her “issues,” so why shouldn’t he get it on with her slutty friend/boss? Who was he hurting? Benny was one of Dean’s best buddies, but did it really matter that he was fucking Amara if Benny and Carmen never found out? Dean didn’t think so. What they didn’t know couldn’t hurt them.
“Jeez, were you standing out there for five hours?” Dean chuckled.
“So why’d you leave?” Dean asked, realizing he was probably prying too much but not caring. He figured he had the right to know everything about anyone mooching off of him.
Dean chuckled softly. “I was an asshole,” he agreed, “and I thought you were a freak, which you are, but in all the best ways.” He caressed the side of Cas’s face, loving the rough feel of stubble.
Dean imagined Cas by himself in the woods at the edge of the neighborhood being gnawed on  by wild animals. Ok, maybe the most dangerous animals they had around here were coyotes, but you never knew. Coyotes and racoons could get rabies and attack people. Or sketchy people could attack Cas. You never knew. “You can’t just toss him out, Carmen.”
“It’s all gonna sound kinda nuts,” Dean said, “but just bear with me.” And then Dean told Sam everything. He told him about getting the DUI and having his car taken; about getting hit by a car and getting a concussion; about how something changed in him, like a window in his brain opened up; about not eating and then only eating round things; about losing his job; about Carmen walking out; about the peyote trip and facing his demons (although he didn’t say what those were); and of course about Cas. “He’s amazing, Sam,” Dean finished. Telling it all to Sam felt like letting go in a game of tug-of-war they’d been having for years. He let out a long breath in relief.
“Well, why were you there then?” Dean said, shaking the image of Cas’ arms out of his head. “You just didn’t want to pay rent?”
She lunged toward him with the intent to slap him again, but he caught her wrist and did his best to not hurt her as he brought her arm down to her side and held her at arm’s length.
“A few peas?” Dean said. It seemed he was unable to speak without question marks. Whatever was in the IV was making him feel more alert and less nauseous though. He felt ready to go.
Dean looked off to where the sun was starting to sink low on the horizon. He thought for a moment of how to explain what was in his head. “I don’t know,” he said. “Everything’s so weird lately, like my head is filled with light, you know? Like nothing matters, but in a cool way, not in a depressing way.” That was the best way he could explain what was going on with him.He touched the still-healing scar on his forehead. Carmen had pulled the stitches out with a tweezer the night before and it felt good to have it uncovered.
Carmen looked at him, mouth agape. “I told you we bounced a check this week!”
“Getting loaded,” he answered with no shame.
“This kid is totally off the grid. Doesn’t have a phone either,” Dean continued. “Y’know, wolf boy.”
There was a long pause. Carmen was probably gauging Cas’s honesty.
Dean felt sort of strange and floaty, like he was two people, one on the ground in his body in Cas’s arms, and one floating above in the night air watching them. “Sorry man,” he said, some tears dampening Cas’s skin. “I don’t know why people do such shitty things in such an amazing world.” He pulled away and pointed at the stars. “I mean look at that shit,” he cried.
“Dean, Dean!”
By the time they left the courthouse hours later, Dean had all his paperwork in, an address where to pick up his ankle bracelet, and an appointment for his first counseling session. He couldn’t have done it all without his brother.
Cas’s frown deepened, the first spark of anger Dean had seen from him. “Yes, although I should say cult leader,” he said with scorn.
“Dean, they said your test was normal so we could go home as soon as you woke up.” She glanced around nervously as if someone was going to come in and drag them out if they didn’t get going immediately. As she helped him sit up and put his arms into his shirt, she said, “Shit, I feel like they’re billing us by the minute.”
“I think Dean is happy,” Cas insisted.
“Hmm?”
“Jeez, Dean, I guess you’re happy to see me?” Sam said with a nervous laugh.
He had dinner ready by the time Cas arrived home, something he hadn’t done for Carmen in years. All the things he wanted to do for Cas made him realize what a shit husband he’d been for Carmen, but he didn’t know how to make that up to her. There was no way to un-hurt her.
“Well, I don’t know, cher,” Benny placated Carmen, “but I think she’ll come around.” He patted her hand and then looked at Dean. “What is that?” he asked, looking at the beet.
Cas lifted a hand to run his fingers through Dean’s hair. “I’m so sorry that happened to you,” he said.
Carmen waved her hand in a vague motion. “Some place where they meditate and do yoga,” she said.
She finally said, “Well I don’t know what to do about him anymore,” and her anger seemed replaced with sadness. Dean knew he should feel bad. He knew he hadn’t been giving Carmen a lot to work with lately. But he also didn’t really feel bad about anything. He felt more calm, more himself, than he ever had.
Over Dean’s serviceable pasta primavera (he’d looked up online what to do with spaghetti and the remaining vegetables in the fridge), they talked about their future. Dean could build their house and Cas would grow their food. Before they got to that point, however, they both would have to work and save. They decided to look for a cheap apartment to share.
“Have you been eating regularly, honey?” she asked. Her sweet voice contrasted with her no-nonsense demeanor.
Next Dean called the courthouse, and between all the various people he had to talk to and all the times he was put on hold, the call ended up taking over two hours. He did, in fact, have a lawyer appointed to him, and his arraignment was in three days. He was supposed to have contacted the lawyer earlier, but by the time he got off the phone, he had set up a meeting, making sure it was after Sam arrived so he could be there too.
“Ok,” Cas acquiesced, lying down on his back beside Dean, their sides touching, “but still no sex.”
It seemed like only moments later when the nurse from earlier--Hannah?-- shook him awake, asked him the same questions the doctor had asked before, and then, along with an orderly, rolled him out of the ER cubicle, leaving Carmen behind. He must have slept through the CT scan because when he opened his eyes again, he was back with Carmen.
“Dean?” Carmen prompted.
Dean pressed his ear to Cas’s chest and drifted off to the rhythm of his heartbeat.
Cas retreated into the house and came back out with a bowl filled with three shiny red apples. The sweet juiciness flooded Dean’s mouth when he took his first bite. Cas set the bowl down on the step and sat beside it, watching as Dean worked his way through all three apples and left the decimated cores in the bowl. After he’d swallowed the final bite, Dean looked Cas in the eye and said, “Thank you.”
“It’s not!” she yelled, and didn’t say another word to him that night, going to sleep on the edge of the bed with her back to him.
Dean rolled his eyes, waiting for whatever stupid thing she had to say. If Amara had coke, that meant she was sharing it with Carmen, and Carmen always got all weird and angry on coke. Because Amara came from money and owned her own business, she always had the expensive drugs.
“But no sex,” Cas said. He had already explained to Dean that he was there to help guide him through his trip and didn’t want to let sex interfere with whatever “internal journey” Dean needed to go on. Dean thought sex with Cas while tripping would be pretty awesome, but Cas seemed to know his stuff, so he trusted him that sex was a bad idea. He did give Dean the best back massage he’d ever had with clothes on though.
“I’m gonna fuck you now, Dean,” Cas rasped in his ear and then removed his fingers. Dean listened to him opening the condom packet, and a few moments later, he pressed the tip of his slick cock in, guiding himself with one hand while gripping Dean’s hip with the other.
“And we didn’t celebrate?” Dean said, stunned as a gloriously naked Cas started to work at unfastening his jeans.
She reemerged with a bulging bag and dropped it to the floor once she was facing Dean. “I’ve had enough,” she said after taking a deep breath and letting it out. “You sleeping with everyone and the drinking and the car and the DUIs and never having money and you never helping with anything and then you acting like you’re crazy just because you got a bump on the head and then Cas,” she listed off in a rush, her voice rising. “You are fucking him, aren’t you?”
Dean had to admit to himself that the images that conjured up were a turn-on, but he was also horrified. “That sick fuck,” he blurted. “You know that’s fucked up, right Cas? Why didn’t you tell me this before?”
5. Talk to Cas about what he wants to do. Where should we or can we live? Does he want to do this together?
“I still want you to build our house and I still want to grow all our food, but maybe we don’t have to do it off of the grid,” Cas said one day after coming home from his environmental studies class. “Maybe instead we could work on improving the grid.”
He thought of Sam in khakis and an oxford shirt at Stanford. What would he think of Dean’s sordid life? He could picture him shaking his head in disapproval. The image of twelve-year-old Sammy’s fallen expression when he’d figured out Dean had been stealing flashed in Dean’s mind. The kid had no idea what else Dean was doing for money. He blinked Sammy’s face away, shoving that shit down hard inside himself. Why did he care what Sam would think? And where was Cas, and what was he doing? Why did he give a fuck what Cas was doing? Why was he thinking about this crap on his day off and not concentrating on Baby? He dropped the hood closed, finished the last of a six-pack and tossed the empty can in the corner of the garage, put away his tools, and got in the car, breathing hard.
Carmen had already hugged the kid and was helping him move his bike into the backyard, so Dean went through the front door, sat on the living room couch, and clicked the tv on. He was happy to see a Classic Speed rerun was on and got lost in the show until Carmen cleared her throat.
“Yes,” Castiel replied without elaboration, his direct gaze sending a shiver up Dean’s spine.
And he was fine, he thought. His hands still remembered how to work on a car, and they did. At break time while the others were outside eating their lunch, Dean looked at himself in the locker room mirror. He moved his face close to the glass and opened his eyes wide, moved his face back out and squinted. He knew that was him, but something was different.
“Man, maybe you should be in a relationship with the pizza,” Sam quipped after swallowing his own mouthful.
Dean stood frozen as he watched Cas walk into the house without another word. All he could think was that he wished Cas would kiss him.
Cas broke the silence. “How much did Carmen tell you about our father?” he asked in a whisper.
2. Call courthouse and ask about court appointed lawyer thing. If I have one ask lawyer about counseling and getting court fees waived
While he ate, Cas looked between the two brothers, with a content smile. After he finished his second piece, he left one hand on Dean’s thigh and wiped some sauce from Dean’s chin with his other thumb. Out of the corner of his eye, Dean saw Sam look away uncomfortably.
“Purple, huh?” Dean said. He had no problem with guys painting their nails or doing anything else. He just wanted to make Cas squirm for some reason.
“Ooh, rawr,” she purred, playfully making a cat clawing motion with her manicured talons.
“Everything ok, Dean?” Cas called out.
“Uh, yeah, Dean,” Sam stuttered. “I uh, just, the last time we talked, you were pretty pissed off, and you wouldn’t answer my calls for like a year, so, y’know…”
Despite the memories and the tears, Dean smiled. It was true. Maybe not completely happy, but he felt more solid at his core than he remembered ever being before. He’d never even realized he had any kind of core until now.
Dean moved on autopilot through the morning, and on his lunch break, leaned against the building outside away from the others. Despite its high warehouse ceilings, the air in Crowley’s felt stifling and he needed to breathe outside for a while. In the distance, three men pushed a beat up Ford Focus down the street. Just as they were about to continue past the garage, Dean called out, “Hey, you guys, over here!” and waved them over. The guy beside the front of the car reached inside the open window to steer it in Dean’s direction as the other two pushed from behind.
The darkness of the underworld swirled around Dean and he was taken back into a time he’d banished from his mind long ago, a time when he was fifteen and offered a handjob for twenty bucks to a guy in an alley behind a bar, something he did sometimes when they had nothing to eat and Sam was growing out of his shoes again, but instead he ended up with a knife at his throat. He saw those two men, their eyes black, their laughter demonic. The one forced himself into Dean’s mouth, the other into his ass, threatening to slit his throat if he made a sound or struggled. They left him there like trash, but Dean pulled up his pants, somehow made it home, and slipped into the shower while Sammy slept, none the wiser. As he watched soapy blood and cum swirl down the drain, his consciousness of the rape went with it.
“I think I just threw up a little in my mouth, Bradbury,” Dean snarled, wriggling away from her.
Cas opened his mouth as if he was going to ask something, but then closed it. He probably had all sorts of questions, but Dean was glad he seemed to have decided to keep them to himself for the time being.
“Dean, I don’t like it, but I’m going to have to let you go,” he said.
“So you’re still smoking weed?” Sam asked.
“Dean?” Carmen said, leaning over him. Her usually shiny, dark hair looked flat.
“You can fuck me tomorrow,” Cas murmered before drifting off in Dean’s embrace.
Dean did as told, chugging a good amount. He could feel it’s coolness travel down his throat and hydrate every corner of his body. He realized he had to piss and stood up to walk to the corner of the walled-in yard where he sometimes, much to Carmen's displeasure, relieved himself when he was too drunk and lazy to go inside and use the toilet. The powerful stream shimmered in the moonlight and Dean started to giggle, marveling at how pee could be so magical.
“Dean, come on!” Carmen objected.
“I knew he wasn’t eating much,” Carmen said to the doctor, “but I thought he was eating something when I wasn’t around. Jesus, Dean, I made peas like four days ago!”
“Like a million bucks,” Dean answered, while stripping off his shirt and pants.
Dean wanted to go inside and defend Cas, but he felt frozen to the step. The sun was dipping below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the torn up patio and beyond.
Dean stared her down for a while, making her squirm. She continued to take items in and out of her purse. “You’re a fucking liar,” he said, his voice feeling cold and hard in his throat.
No one spoke until Amara made an aborted attempt, saying, “Whu…” and looked to Carmen.
They kissed for a long time, running fingers through each other’s hair, against the skin on each other’s necks and faces. They came up for air for a moment only to dive back in for more. Dean inched them back toward the couch and they made their way there without ever losing contact. Once Dean was seated, Cas straddled his lap and kicked off his tennis shoes. They resumed their lip lock until Dean started to pull Cas’s t-shirt up and they had to separate in order for Dean to pull it off. Dean ran his hands over Cas’s now exposed chest. He had a smattering of dark hair at his sternum, but was otherwise smooth and unblemished. Cas shivered at his touch and looked at him with what could only be described as hunger. He pulled at the hem of Dean’s filthy t-shirt, and Dean obliged him, removing it and tossing it aside. They ran their hands over each other’s torsos for a while, and Dean could feel the hardness of Cas’s erection press against his own through layers of fabric. Cas swooped down for more kissing and moaned into Dean’s mouth, grinding their covered crotches together. Dean moved his hands down Cas’s sides toward his fly. He popped the button, unzipped, and reached inside Cas’s underwear. Cas let out another pained moan, and his dick twitched in Dean’s hand, warm and alive. It was damp at the tip, and Dean stroked the moisture over its length. It only took a few pulls for Cas to come with a low groan into Dean’s neck.
Dean got up and moved to lean his elbows on the counter between the kitchen table and sink. “Like, ‘Honey, I’m sure we’ll find the money’.”
“Mmm,” Dean responded, setting his feet on the floor.
Dean looked at Carmen, incredulous. “Ignore me? What the fuck, Carmen? I can’t have this hippy squatter eating our food when I need money to get my Baby back.”
With his bandaged hands and aching, foggy head, Dean was practically dead weight as Carmen wrestled him into all of his clothes and into a wheelchair. After Carmen signed a form and they entered the hospital waiting room on the way out, Cas appeared before them, backlit by the rising sun through the floor to ceiling windows. Dean’s mouth dropped open at his beauty. With his messy, dark hair framed by sunlight, he looked like an angel, and he gazed upon Dean with such benevolent concern in his clear blue eyes. No one had ever looked at Dean with such empathy in his life.
Cas shook his head. “No, I’m sorry Dean,” he said.
“May I hug you?” Cas asked.
“Maybe,” Cas agreed, and Dean left it at that.
“There was this electricity between us the moment we met, wasn’t there?” Cas asked, raising his own hand to Dean’s face and mirroring Dean’s movements.
“Yeah, Cas,” Carmen said with a soft smile.
Time passed, who knew how long, and Cas turned Dean to face him. He said, “It’s getting dark, Dean. Let me help you up and bring you home.”
“Nothing. I need ten bucks,” he said, too embarrassed to explain his predicament.
When Dean answered no, she brushed past him inside and headed toward the bedroom. Dean stood waiting in the living room, listening to her loudly moving things around, filling up her bag with her stuff, he presumed.
Carmen was clearly pissed off about something, all the car-talk Dean guessed, but he wasn’t going to give in and apologize for something that he didn’t think was wrong in the first place. It was an argument that cropped up fairly often, and especially when they were drinking or using other substances. Carmen thought Dean spent too much money and time on his car and other people’s cars, money and time she would prefer he spend on her or the house. They each drank their beers and looked everywhere but at each other while Amara and Benny tried to act like it wasn’t awkward, laughing nervously.
Dean wasn’t sure what to say to that except, “uh, yeah.” The way Amara continued to hold Carmen close to her seemed more than just friendly.
Dean stopped and turned around. He hadn’t realized it until Cas offered, but he was very thirsty, and his mouth still tasted like puke. Cas held the water jug out to him and he chugged a good amount before handing it back and continuing out to the street. The air was magnetic, pulling him toward his destination, and Cas kept pace beside him. As they walked the three blocks to the woods’ edge, past identical tract homes with postage stamp front yards, he saw the colors of everything following him, like he was pulling streaks of green and yellow, blue and gray, with him, but he knew it was because of the peyote, and it didn’t scare him.
Cas nodded again. “Yes, she’s very much still under Chuck’s sway. She won’t talk to me since I left.”
Later that night after they’d all gone to bed, Dean tried to keep quiet for Sam’s sake as Cas rode him, squeezing his cock with his internal muscles on each up-stroke.
That evening after work, Carmen asked him, “Honey, is it ok if my brother stays with us for awhile?”
Dean squirmed under the scrutiny. “Yeah, now get in the house,” he snapped. “I’m not here for your entertainment.” He looked around to make sure none of his neighbors were watching.
“Can’t do it,” she said in her usual flat tone, still not looking at him.
Dean sat down and let out a huff of breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding. That had gone better than he could have hoped for. She hadn’t killed him or set the house on fire. He would feel more guilty about everything if he didn’t truly believe that splitting up would be good for Carmen too. Whether she realized it or not, she had to work on her own shit.
“Yeah, I am now,” he said with a rueful smile, “but at the end of undergrad, I started to get super-stressed, feeling all this pressure to be the wunderkind everyone seemed to think I was, and I met this girl, Ruby, who I thought was helping me deal with it, but it turns out she had her own demons to deal with.”  Sam told Dean how he’d started using fentanyl with Ruby and almost ruined his stellar school record. Ruby ended up o.d.-ing. She lived, but it was a wakeup call for Sam. She dropped out and moved back with her parents, and Sam’s mentor, Dr. Mills, helped him to get back on track.
He wanted her to go, to stop touching him, but he didn’t want to be mean to her either. “I don’t want it though,” he said.
“Cas!” he called, not sure if he was still home or was at the gardening place.
“They’ll auction her off if you don’t get her out,” Sam added.
“Oh, yeah, sure,” Dean agreed before eating a few more peas one by one.
Sometimes Dean forgot how young Cas was, but the anxious look on his face reminded him. Dean had an urge to kiss the frown right off his adorable face. “Don’t like handling money, huh?” he asked instead.
Dean turned to the mirror again to continue puzzling out the strange visage he saw there. “No thank you,” he said mildly. He felt no desire for the car anymore.
“I took it off,” Dean said.
Dean took stock of how he felt. Sure, he could still feel the healing wound throb a bit, but he felt light, airy. “Not bad,” he said, smiling back.
Carmen dried off her hands and just glared at him.
Eventually they stopped kissing and just held each other in a loose embrace. “I feel very badly about Carmen,” Cas said against Dean’s neck, breaking the silence. “I don’t think she will speak to me again.”
As he got closer, Dean smiled at Cas’s gummy grin. When he was a few feet from Dean, he said, “Your mouth is all red.”
The noise stopped and Carmen emerged from the bathroom, opening the door without a sound and gathering her things with great care.
Dean even talked about it with Mia, something he’d never imagined talking about to another soul, and she had some suggestions for staying in the moment with Cas and not flashing back. He thought her suggestion of both of them talking through everything face to face while Cas was fucking him would be a huge turn-off, but the opposite turned out to be true.
“He’s got a sleeping bag and pad and I gave him a couple of blankets for more cushioning,” she explained, turning her back to him and snuggling under the covers. “He seemed real happy about the set-up. He’s got a little tent too if he wants to set up in the backyard.” Dean could hear the smile in her voice. “I guess it’s a step up from the ashram.”
“God!” Amara exclaimed, shaking Carmen off.
Dean scoffed. “You know, I find it very hard to believe that you and Carmen are related,” he said, thinking of his pragmatic wife, always worried he was spending too much money on Baby and weed, always anxious to get their next paychecks.
Benny chuckled and grabbed a beer out of the bag, moving into the livingroom to sit on the couch.
After more staring, Cas asked, “What is that?” nodding his head toward the mug.
That did sound nice to Dean. He could easily build one of those kit homes by himself. When Dean was a teenager, they once lived in an apartment complex next to a pallet recycling company that would leave the wooden pallets that were rotting or beyond repair stacked out back, ready to be mulched. Nobody seemed to notice or care that Dean took some of the ones in better condition and dragged them down into the ditch behind the apartment complex parking lot. Using his dad’s tools, he dismantled the pallets and built a sturdy fort with the wood scraps and recycled nails down there in the weeds that summer. He and Sammy would hang out in it a lot, especially when dad was on a bender, sharing snacks and comic books Dean had stolen from the corner store down the block where the owner was too old to notice a fourteen-year old stuffing merchandise in his pants. When their dad told them to pack up since they were moving on, Dean had run out and taken a hammer to the fort in a rage, smashing the shit out of it.
Dean wasn’t sure how that would go, but he said, “Sure, give me a call,” and with that they went their separate ways.
Dean put his dick away but started to laugh harder. He stumbled back to the nest and lay down, his laughter settling down to a few chuckles. Cas sat beside him looking confused. “Even piss looks beautiful on this shit,” Dean explained, and Cas smiled.
Shit, shit, shit, he thought to himself, but he was docile through the whole thing--the handing over of his license and registration, the breathalyzer, the handcuffs. Shit.
Sam smiled. “Yeah, I think you’d like her, Dean.”
Afterwards, he’d practically shoved her out the door. She was all huffy, but relented when he hissed, “The kid could be back any second. I don’t know where the fuck he is.”
“That’s neat,” the weird-looking, skinny guy-- “Garth Fitzgerald IV” according to the nameplate on his desk-- said. “Do you have the title with you?”
“You never met him,” Carmen said while gathering her purse and keys. They were headed out to get Dean’s ankle bracelet removed. “His name’s Castiel. We have different moms.”
“Not for good,” Cas whispered, still raking his fingers over Dean’s scalp. “You’re opening up now.”
Dean ended up eating an orange and some hazelnuts that Carmen dug up from a gift basket she’d stuck in the closet last Christmas, and he eventually went into work. He even felt good enough to ride Cas’s bike, which miraculously survived the accident unscathed except for a bent front wheel rim which Cas had since fixed. Cas said he would take the bus.
He was looking up on his phone how to file for unemployment when someone knocked on the door. He wasn’t surprised to find Carmen on the other side in cut-off shorts and a Jayhawks t-shirt, her big quilted bag, looking empty, slung over her shoulder. She was pretty as ever, even when pissed off. She slapped his face hard enough to cause him to stumble against the doorframe. After righting himself, Dean raised a hand to his cheek and looked up at Carmen’s scowl. “Amara told me everything,” she said.
“Hey, let’s eat some pizza and then we can talk about all the serious stuff,” Dean said to break the tension and because he really was hungry. He was back to enjoying some of the food he used to eat before the accident, but he didn’t wolf it down the same way he used to, and he had continued eating less meat and more veggies. When he opened the first box, he took a minute to let the aroma wash over him as Sam and Cas took their slices and started chowing down. Dean sat between Cas and Sam, his thigh pressed against Cas’s. When he did take his first cheesy bite, Dean chewed slowly, appreciating each flavor individually and in concert with one another.
He endured similar jeers after he clocked out, but he had to admit to himself as he rode home, that the wind felt good on his face and the pumping of his legs brought him right back to those magical moments of childhood with little Sammy perched up on his handlebars, the two of them laughing and free for at least an hour or two. On the route home, he noticed things he never had before from the car, like the dandelions and anthills that peppered the curb and the cacophony of birds. And then out of nowhere a car backed out of a driveway, and Dean crashed right into it with a thud. He flipped over the hood, reached out his hands to break the fall, smashed his skull into the pavement, and descended into darkness.
Dean stared her down until she took it to mean he agreed and got up to retrieve Carmen. In the meantime, he and Benny continued their conversation in hushed tones until the two girls returned and they stopped talking.
