“I have a few years on you, remember,” Sherlock reminded him, running his hand through Hamish’s dark hair, feeling a surge of love for the boy. “I’m glad you came with us, Hamish.”
Sherlock’s jaw dropped at the sight of the console room. He blinked a couple times, then raced back outside, running the circumference of the phone box, then back in again. “…It’s bigger on the inside…” he murmured.
John had several long hours at the house before Jim returned, which he spent pacing the living room nervously. Jim always returned home armed. John would have to pretend to be relaxed until Jim disarmed for the evening before he struck.
John’s grip on the note weakened as he read it, until the scrap of paper finally fluttered out of his hands. He hoped against reason that someone would pick it up and read it and do something to help, but it was soon muddy and trampled by the other pedestrians.
Sherlock and John grew used to the sight of the horrific angels trapped in their narrow flat corridor after a couple days, although they were a nuisance to skirt around. They were brainstorming ways to get rid of them without breaking the angels’ eye contact with each other as they were walking home when they saw a blue phone box parked outside of Speedy’s café.
Jim raised his eyebrows, his expression slack. “Fine, go ahead and keep that one. It’s not like I don’t have more.”
He stood aside as Sherlock stepped warily towards the door. He expected to see Baker Street as it was five minutes ago, but he was also giddily hoping to be proved wrong.
Sherlock stared at the fireplace. “Unfortunately for you, that’s not your call. Jim won’t care if you want to be traded or not. It’s my decision. I just thought you should know my intentions, should it happen.”
Pain racked John’s body and he yelled out, making no attempt to mask it or quiet it, since the gag muffled it so much anyway. Every thrust pushed a futile yell or groan of protest from John's mouth as his head pressed against the headboard.
Hamish pulled John over to the table to show him a thick stack of glowing school reports, research activities, Latin class readings, and biology sketches.
But no, he finally reached over and untied John's gag, then untied his wrists. Once they were free, John collapsed face-first, gasping in air and clawing off the rope around his neck. He weakly pushed the ropes off the bed with his foot, then lay, too weak and sore to move.
The most infuriating part of it all to Sherlock was that if they had been sent back to 1895 during their first run-in with the angels, they never would have met him. What
Sherlock rolled his eyes, annoyed. “I didn’t know the idea of me wanting you alive and unarmed would be so offensive to you.”
Evenings with Hamish were heaven. They read books and John croaked out stories, his voice growing stronger every day, and every night they curled up to sleep. The week passed much too quickly.
John felt a hand brushing through his hair, then he slumped into the sofa, giving in to unconsciousness.
He would never, ever tell Sherlock this, of course. Their friendship was invaluable, and if it caused John a bit of private suffering and confusion, so be it. Better than to wreck it by sharing the truth and losing the closest friend he’d ever had.
It sunk in then. Sherlock would never see his pompous older brother again, and the thought bothered him far more than he had predicted. “No. This is—“he swallowed. “This will be it.”
“Oh—okay,” she said meekly, realization dawning on her. “Well, goodnight, then.” She stopped at her bedroom doorway. “You’ll still be here in the morning, right?”
They reached the main foyer, where the classmates were all glaring at Hamish for making them wait. Hamish, unperturbed by his classmates’ angry looks, turned to face John and Sherlock and stuck his hand out. “Sophie says it’s polite to shake people’s hands when you meet them, but I think it’s a load of rubbish. Why should have to touch people straight-off when you meet them?”
“We want you to, Hamish,” John said. “But things are…complicated.” He looked up at Sherlock, unsure how to explain their predicament.
He used the two-day journey to London as an opportunity to bond with the men—Hammond, Burke, and O'Connell. It would be to his advantage to get the men to trust and like him. The man made fun of him for being Moriarty's bitch, but John did his best to convince them that he was absolutely devoted and in love with Jim. That way, if someday he managed to kill Jim, the men might not immediately suspect him. He wanted to erase any motive. For the same reason, when the men mentioned Sherlock, John responded with bitterness.
Sherlock pushed two fingers against the outside of John’s hole, the slowly pushed in, waiting for John’s muscles to stop spasming.
Hamish’s bed, usually hastily made and covered with books, was stripped bare, and there was no sign of any of Hamish’s belongings. John’s stomach plummeted. His thoughts plummeted as he raced down the hallway to the registrar’s office.
John groaned and opened his mouth wider, then froze when he heard voices nearing the room. He tensed as a couple passed the doorway without going in, then laughed into Sherlock’s mouth and resumed kissing.
“Oh! You’re a doctor as well? You must lead a busy life with two jobs,” Mrs. Hudson interjected cheerfully.
Over the next hour, Sherlock showed Hamish how to hold the violin, and how to grasp the bow, steering his arm, letting him play a few notes. Soon Hamish was awkwardly holding the large violin by himself, experimentally sawing at the strings.
John stayed hunched over, his arms cross tightly across his aching stomach. He had no idea what Moriarty was getting at. “He was your…gunman,” John said warily.
There were no animals in sight, but as they reached the final step of the flat, four stone angels were lined up in front of them, staring straight at them, hands outstretched.
“Hamish isn’t my clone, though.” Even now, Hamish was resting his elbows on his knees and his chin on his fists, his brow furrowed in a perfect impression of John.
Mary blushed, Sherlock noticed with considerable annoyance from the corner of his eye. “He doesn’t? Erm, what I mean is, sir, I won’t take offense to your indifference to my food, then.” She smiled a bit. “Though few have tasted my treacle fudge without cracking a smile.”
Sherlock’s eyes were hard as he stared with malice into Jim’s. He enunciated firmly, “As long as John and Hamish are alive and I am alive, Jim, you will not be able to rest.
“That’s when I decided I liked you.” Jim contemplatively took another drag from the hookah, letting the smoke seep out of his mouth, sucking it back in through his nose, and out his mouth again. “Did you ever meet my Sebastian, John?”
“We haven’t the faintest. We didn’t even know he existed until today. And he’s been longer than we’ve known each other, so we reckoned the Doctor had something to do with it.”
“Just pretend like you belong! That’s what I do. Works every time! Well, 9 times out of ten. …Maybe 7.”
Then he would go out and see Hamish, and he would see Sherlock’s eyes when Hamish looked up at him, and John would think, “I’m doing this for you. For both of you.”
Jim's eyes didn't stray from the page. “Not that it’s any of your business—but Kellan O’Connery is a thieving bastard. Get rid of him.” He stopped writing to look at him. “Is there a
When they returned home a few days later, Mary was at the door, astonished at the hardened soldier who rushed to give her a hug. In their flat—John savored the space—221B,
He didn’t expect the gentle, gliding touch of Jim’s fingers as they ran up John's back and stroked the nape of his neck.  Jim leaned down to whisper in John's ear, a regretful tinge in his voice, “It really upsets me that you went behind my back, Johnny Boy…I thought we could trust each other. Now I have to teach you a lesson.”
“Glad we’re on the same page,” John mumbled into his mouth. “For once.” He sighed and looked at the disarray of the room. “Maybe…maybe we should get up—“ he suggested reluctantly.
They wandered silently through Hyde Park amidst large clusters of daffodils, John doing his best to keep himself from storming off from the sulky and jaded Sherlock.
Sherlock pressed his hand harder down on John’s neck, but only enough that John’s couldn’t freely move his head around. He dragged his teeth along John’s jaw, following the bone up to his ear. John’s breath caught as Sherlock’s tongue and then his teeth found John’s earlobe, dragging it out as his hand slid down to touch John through his pants.
The Doctor looked up at central TARDIS column fondly, rubbing his hands together. “So, dear, what do you think? New passengers?” He ran around the console and began flipping switches. “Hang on to something! Next stop: 1895!”
“He’ll never miss it! I’ll not have you starve. It would hardly be Christian of me to do any different,” she insisted, then hurried downstairs.
John looked at Sherlock and nodded. Hamish danced around with glee, than ran up to put his suitcase in his bedroom.
In the cab, Sherlock watched Victorian London pass by. He looked at each person they passed, calculating, annoyed that they weren’t quite as easy to read as he was used to. The basics were all still the same, however, he was happy to find. The apple vendor was having an affair, obviously. The shop on the corner had recently come under new management. Still, there was much to learn.
“So, what else do you want from me? I’ve loved you far longer than you’ve loved me, and I still get this feeling that I’m being fickle—it’s really unfair.”
An hour later, John, Sherlock and Hamish were all crowded into Arthur Conan Doyle’s parlor, Mr. Doyle fending off a barrage of questions from Hamish as Mary set the table and John examined his bookshelf from a respectful distance.
John’s breath quickened as he pulled closer, and he leaned down to kiss Sherlock again as Sherlock ran his hands along his arms. “Do I look different? From when you last saw me?” He left a trail of light, slow kisses up Sherlock’s jaw to his ear, burying his nose in Sherlock’s hair. He’d missed that smell so much. He could drown in it.
John cast Sherlock a look that said “I hate you” loud and clear, then cleared his throat. He gave Hamish a forced smile and apologetically itched the back of his neck. “Well, art’s subjective, isn’t it? Just because
Mary came back upstairs, empty-handed. “I explained your situation to Mr. Doyle, and he’s invited you all to join him for supper.
“And the Doctor…he was—“ John changed the subject, trying with frustration to describe the strange man in the box properly. “I felt like I had no way of understand him. And did he seem old to you? He
, John—don’t even say that…the very thought—“ He paused for a moment, looking at John, then lets out a weak laugh. “If I had faked my death—
Jim pulled out and thrust hard into John once, and as agonized, intense pleasure spilled over John, Jim whispered, “I will slit your son's throat.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him, then turned to back to the Doctor.. “You’re mistaken. I’m not at all famous enough to warrant a museum. So, before I phone up my good client and wrap up this case, explain
John faltered. This was going to hurt. A lot. He wished he could see what Jim was doing behind him, but he didn't dare look back. Jim seized his left wrist, winding a rope around it and tying it tightly to one of the bedposts, then did the same with his right, stretching his arms wide and forcing the top of his head to press uncomfortably against the headboard. John's heart hammered as Jim shoved the gag in his mouth, and he couldn’t help  but groan in protest as Jim tightened it in a firm knot behind his head. John wrapped his fingers around the bedposts as best as he could, hearing Jim slide his trousers off, then feeling him kneel on the bed behind him.
Sherlock fell to the floor to sit, and stared lamely at his violin. His voice was dazed. “He took them, Mary. He took both of them.”
“Yeah, me too. Technology, that is. Not so much the bombs or the Westwood.” John missed, funnily enough, jumpers. They certainly existed in 1895, but he’d never seen anyone wearing one. Jumpers must be homemade things wives made for their husbands. Maybe it was a rural fashion. He was surprised to feel his mouth twitching up. It had been a while since he’d thought about something that didn’t involve death or crime or how much he missed Sherlock and Hamish.
John took a deep breath, staring down the hideous piece of stone in front of him. “Always.” He gripped Sherlock’s hand tighter. He would follow this man anywhere. “On your signal.”
John read through the letter several times, scrutinizing the unmistakable handwriting, and finding himself tearing up over idiotic things, like how tightly Sherlock hooked his ‘G’s. He kissed the letter then pulled the fresh sheets he’d stowed for writing to Sherlock and wrote,
“It would have created a way out for you. It would allow you to maintain your life in modern London and it would have closed the loophole, since the
Without further explanation he tossed the phone to John, and John listened to each of the messages, each from the same woman.
“It’s just…in my dreams—in my nightmares, one of us gets sent back and the other doesn’t. Or in one dream, we got sent to different time periods. I was in 1895, but you weren’t with me, and then I found stories about a 16
He watched Hamish closely. Hamish frowned a bit, thinking, then turned to John. “So you two are time travelers? Amazing! Can I come with you?”
“Hamish and I stopped a robbery, nothing too exciting. The criminal was too obvious, but we were in the neighborhood. It’s good to be home.”
John pulled his fingers out, lubricated his cock, then very carefully pushed it in, pausing to let Sherlock get used to its width. Sherlock gave a small groan, and John pulled out and pushed in again, this time hitting Sherlock’s prostate, making Sherlock arch his back and part his lips in a silent moan.
He rocked Hamish back and forth in his embrace, feeling worse than when Sherlock had “died.” That had been a cold, empty space, and this was a hot burning thing that consumed his insides, rage with no viable outlet.
“Oh, Sherlock Holmes. Did you honestly think I was gleefully sending you back into the past, wrenching you from the life you knew and loved because it
Jim crawled to his side of the bed and slid under the covers next to John. He rolled to face him, giving him a quick peck on the cheek. “Goodnight, Johnny Boy, be good and don’t snore.” With that, Jim rolled away from John and fell asleep almost immediately.
John removed his bowler as he stooped to enter the opium den. It was difficult to see far into it, as it was so dimly lit and full of smoke.
“We have to go where Moriarty tells us to. We have to do what he says,” John led Hamish down the hallway.
He rolled back over and it took John a very long time to fall asleep. Jim was asleep almost instantly; the laudanum was likely the culprit. John heard him mutter Sebastian’s name a few times, which surprised him. He thought sleepily about Jim and Sebastian’s relationship, trying to imagine Jim acting anything resembling loving to anyone.
move! Instead of repairing the friendship, he’d now most likely ruined it for good. John was about to apologize when Sherlock lunched back at him, dropping his cigarette and pressing his mouth against John’s, desperately grabbing him.
Sherlock smiled at the doctor, who was looking around for his pants. “I didn’t have anyone to keep it clean for.”
Hamish came downstairs to find John and Sherlock pulling on their coats. “Why’re you putting on your coats?”
, Doctor Watson?” Jim giggled, his hand clawing down John’s thigh and around to his bum. He prodded his finger inside of John, brushing it teasingly against the prostate. John felt a surge of pleasure hit him and he gasped and bucked up.
Jim rolled his eyes at Hamish’s back. “Of course.” He gently patted Hamish on the head, then threw John a threatening look before heading back down the stairs.
Brenetta Lave was unable to give them any further information about Torchwood, The Doctor, or his blue box, but she did finally, after much coersion, pass on a phone number and a name of someone who might be able to help.
John gave him another kiss, then ran his hands from behind his ears to along the sides of his neck, sliding downwards and running his hands down his chest. He moved his hands around to Jim’s back, sliding them down and squeezing at Jim’s buttocks as he got onto his knees, brushing his lips against Jim’s trousers as he worked to unbutton them.
“Professor Moriarty! What are you doing here?” Hamish looked at him, then back to John. “Where are we? Where’s…” he eyed Jim and remembered to say, “Uncle Sherlock?”
Sherlock couldn’t decide what was more irritating about the Doctor—the fact that he was impossible to deduce anything from, or the fact that he spouted nonsense every time he flapped his mouth. “You
Sherlock sank into his chair, drawing his knees up to his chest and steepling his fingers under his chin.
John refrained from talking too much to preserve his voice, but he hugged Hamish as often as he could, and after dinner, which was dominated by Hamish’s conversation—Jim was absent—John told Hamish how proud he was of him.
Sherlock examined the picture carefully, and John noticed the space mobile above the bed. “Sherlock, look.
John clutched at Sherlock’s coat lapels, kissing him as if this was the last time he’d ever be able to do, and Sherlock matched his fervency, slipping his tongue into John’s mouth, which was becoming much more familiar now, but in a delightful way, like a favorite room he loved coming back to. He wrapped his arms around John’s back, sucking on John’s lower lip.
“Moriarty’s not a professor,” John interjected. “He’s probably pretended to be, though. He took up the alias ‘Rich Brook’ and forced Sherlock to fake his own death.”
Sherlock was grinning ear to ear. John knew he should be angry with the boy, but he was almost impressed.
Sherlock clenched his jaw, annoyed to no end that tears were stinging his eyes. His stupid, arrogant, older brother. What good would it do, being upset that he wouldn’t see him again? He tried to keep his voice steady as he said, “I know I was a handful. Though I can’t say I regret pick-pocketing you all those times. It always came in handy.”
To make matters worse, one day they received a note with their mail that said, “See you soon. xx JM.”
John’s eyes widened, and he began struggling even more intensely, expending all of his energy into a simultaneous effort to get free and to increase the pressure against his prostate.
Once Mary had ducked out of the room, Sherlock sighed and sank further into his chair, crossing one leg over the other and steepling his fingers, thinking. “John, I’m going to tell you this now, and I would appreciate it if you didn’t bother trying to argue with me. If Moriarty takes either you or Hamish, or
The boy tilted his head to the side a bit and blinked up at him. “Both your lips are swollen, your cheeks are pink and it’s not cold outside today, or windy, so why is your hair all mussed? And
John shifted plans. “Yeah, for a bit. But then you’ve got to find your school group again, all right?” They headed out to find the new room. “I don’t want to be accused of kidnapping,” he grumbled.
.” Before he realized what he was doing, Sherlock was holding Mary, sobbing on her shoulder. Mary grabbed him back, crying as well, sharing his relief and sorrow and moved by his rare display of emotion. “I know sir—I know!”
“Hamish, would you like a cup of tea, or some cocoa? I’ll fix you some,” John said, moving to the kitchen. He needed something to do to calm his nerves.
“You’ve got a job tomorrow. I don’t pay you to watch over me, I pay you to be rested and ready to kill. Now go the fuck back to your room, or I’ll make
“Ugh, a life without texts. Actually having to bother talking to people,” Sherlock grumbled. “And what’ll we do with a fridge? Where’ll I keep the blood and the thumbs?”
"That's good, John, very very good!" Sherlock clapped excitedly and stood up. This was one of the slowest-moving cases he'd had in a long while, but it they were getting closer, ever so slowly, to uncovering who the Doctor really was.
Sherlock gives Hamish a bit of a disgruntled look, not liking that the little boy knew something that he didn’t.
Sherlock gave John a quick, concerned look before whipping the violin back up to his shoulder and playing a spirited gavotte, going to stand by the window as he played.
When Saturday rolled around, John and Sherlock took a carriage south of the Thames to Hamish’s school. In the main foyer, parents milled about with their sons, all of whom were clad in the school’s stark uniforms, and it wasn’t long before they spotted Hamish waving excitedly amidst the sea of wool navy jackets.
John and Sherlock exchanged glances as Elton led them upstairs. "No photos. I want my love life kept private, thanks." He knocked on his bedroom door. "Ursula, love, we've got guests. A detective a…erm…doctor."
“More than any old gunman. The best. My right-hand man. My bodyguard.” Jim put the hookah pipe down and rose, walking slowly past John, letting his fingers drag across the back of John’s shoulders. “Want to know why I lured you here, John?”
“Well…” Sherlock cleared his throat, which felt unnecessarily tight, and John hastily got up to fetch a glass of water from the kitchen. “There’ve been…signs…”
Sherlock’s eyes were beginning to water. He swallowed hard, thinking. “I have an idea. We’re going to position ourselves in the middle of the kitchen, halfway between my angel and yours. When I say blink, blink once, as quickly as you can.”
A couple of pints apiece later, both John and Sherlock were pleasantly buzzed, John moreso. Sherlocked noticed how unsteady John was when they got to their feet to head back.
“Molly, she called, and I—“ John stared at him in a daze, fumbling for the things he wanted to articulate. He wanted to say that the past month had been miserable, that he wanted back in, that he wanted Sherlock in his life in whatever way it took. He wanted more than anything to say that he loved him, that he loved him more deeply than he’d thought it possible to love anyone. “I—I um…” John’s words were tangled and refused to come out. He finally mumbled, “Oh, sod it all,” and, in a swift movement, stepped forward, grabbed Sherlock’s neck, and pulled him down to kiss him.
Sherlock and John stood staring at the man for a moment, not saying anything. Sherlock finally stepped forward, looking the man up and down. “The Doctor,” he said, hardly believing it was really him.
“That should solve our problem.” Sherlock leaned forward to lick under John’s chin and whispered, “Keep your legs still.” He slowly slid back between John’s legs, pushing them apart, then cradled John’s balls in his hand, gently tugging and fondling them.
“We just—I think we both want to know about him,” John said. “What’s he like? What does he like to do?”
Once out of the cab, they headed inside St. Bart’s. The old façade outside looked much the same, but the inside was much changed.
“Not true. My father wasn’t exactly a great role model. Why do you think Harry took up drinking? Dear old Dad taught her all his best tricks.” He kicked off his shoes and pulled off his jumper.
“Good! I’m going home. Come back when you’re through being an insufferable raincloud,” John countered, then headed for home, now in a stormy mood himself.
John was about to obey, then had an idea. He prayed that Jim liked unpredictability during sex, otherwise he was in trouble. He dropped and rolled sideways, pushing Jim with him until John was straddling him. He seized Jim’s wrists and pinned his arms by his head. If he could give a spectacular blowjob, maybe he could avoid being fucked. Or maybe Jim would just slit his throat for his insolence.
The next morning, Sherlock woke up curled around John. He checked his phone on the dresser for the time, but it had died during the night, so he slipped out of bed with minimal movement so as not to wake John.
“Goodness, do be careful!” Doyle said, catching Hamish, who quickly regained his balance and backed away. “Sorry—I didn’t mean to…”
“Probably.” But Molly didn’t move. She stood her ground and watched him. “You don’t look fine, Sherlock. You’re obviously
Sherlock sat in despair for a few more moments, then it was as if Mary’s words finally found him, and he sprang to his feet. He immediately began pacing, fingers steepled under his chin. “You’re right. There’s a way, there’s always a way. There’s always a chink in the armor—
John ran his thumb along Hamish’s shoulder. “Shh, Hamish, it’s okay, he knows. Hamish, Sherlock is…” he met his son’s eyes. He was about to tell a lie that would break his son’s heart and scar him forever. Hamish might never forgive him for this. There was still a part of John that would never forgive Sherlock for faking his own death. Now he was perpetuating that lie with someone else.
John reflexively grabbed his revolver from an end table and opened the door to reveal a livid man, his freckled face as red as his hair. His voice was a barely-contained snarl. “Are you John Watson?”
Doyle prodded John for more details until he had a fleshed-out story. “Dr. Watson, would you mind if I…took this and made a story out of it, narrated by you? I’d change up the details a bit for the narrative’s sake, but I’d try to preserve the spirit and the remarkable penchant your friend has for observations.”
John groaned against Sherlock’s lips, furiously ripping at the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt, running his free hand over Sherlock’s throat and squeezing it briefly. Once their shirts had been cast onto the floor, John rolled over to pin Sherlock to the bed, forcing his head back so he could bite and lick up Sherlock’s neck, digging his nails into Sherlock’s arms.
John clenched his teeth together to stop from snapping that assassinations had a lot of unseen variables. He
Jim gave Sherlock a playful smile, looking almost bashfully at the floor then back up at him. “Look at you—Sherlock Holmes. I
“More coming,” Sherlock mumbled, pulling away. They both froze—a group of school children, by the sound of things. They quickly disentangled themselves and straightened their appearances as a small boy wandered in. The rest of the group seemed to be moving on without him, but he didn’t seem to notice or mind. He just stared up at John and Sherlock. “Were you two havin’ a snog just now?” he asked.
Sherlock flipped forward a couple pages. “Ha! Wrong.” He kept skimming. “Wrong—wrong! Gregson...who’s he? We don’t know a DI Gregson, do we? Clearly this is a load of rubbish. These stories aren’t even accurate. Embellished…
It was invasive and overwhelming, and even while John struggled to breathe as Jim’s tongue ran along his teeth, as he sucked at John’s tongue, John felt a warm arousal beginning. Jim knew how to kiss. He knew how to vary the pressures and how to move his lips just right to make John moan against his will.
“I do miss the city sometimes, if that’s what you mean.” John leaned down to kiss then bite Jim's earlobe, an area John had learned is a sensitive spot for Jim.
John shivered, instantly reminded of how violent and changeable his boss and captor was. He couldn’t let himself forget that he was living with a madman as unpredictable as a summer storm. He sighed a breath of relief as the door closed, then bent to pick up the vase shards. Several had skittered under Jim’s desk. John crawled under to retrieve them. As he straightened, he noticed a corner of a note poking out from beneath a ledger. Looking to double-check nobody was around, he slid it out to skim it over. As he did, his heart skipped a beat.
At the word “angel”, Sherlock bolted for 221B, phone still pressed to his ear. “Keep your eyes on it, John, but call Mrs. Hudson—you’ll need to blink before I can get there. Ask them where they came from. Obviously she won’t know, but she’ll stick around to have a good look at them.” He pocketed his phone as he rounded the corner. Only one more street to the flat.
The letter wasn’t very specific, and clearly part of a chain of correspondence, but it was clear enough that Jim was having trouble with business in London. Apparently since they had left, things had been spiraling out of control in that particular section of Moriarty’s web.
John touching Sherlock’s chin and tilted his face toward him. “Well, whatever’s coming for us—blue boxes or time-stealing angels or psychotic murderers…we’ll be together. Right?”
Sherlock clicked on the page and squinted at some blurry photographs. Did crackpots simply refuse to focus their camera lenses when they took photos? "This isn't the same man. He doesn't fit Duncan's description," Sherlock said.
I never did like to be over-dramatic.” The Doctor frowned, thinking. “Well, that’s not entirely true…” He muttered, as if to himself, “Maybe I should get a long, dramatic coat again. You certainly pull it off, Sherlock.”
Sherlock ground his teeth and bored his cold gray eyes into John’s before saying coolly, “I didn’t realize I was such a burden to you. Don’t worry, I’ll be gone by the time Mary comes back to prepare dinner.” He headed for the bedroom, fully intending on packing up. If John didn’t want him anymore, he wasn’t about to stick around.
John closed his eyes, separating himself from the experience. He kept his mind task-oriented, focused on a good performance, trying to keep his emotions folded away somewhere safe. From the way things were going now, he could keep things gentle and low-key.
John pulled out and pushed in again, finding a rhythm, gripping Sherlock’s legs and draping them over his shoulders so he could scoot in closer. He held on to Sherlock’s hips, groaning. “Sherlock—!”
Sherlock sidled up beside him ad hissed quietly, “Are you sure you wouldn’t rather stay here chatting up Mary?”
case to free Sherlock from the “stagnation” he was forever moaning about. John gave a chuckle as he stood up, stepping into the kitchen to snatch up one of Mary’s rolls. She gave him a sly look but didn’t stop him.
I just offered him Sebastian’s old position.” Jim met Sherlock’s eyes from under his brow and bit his bottom lip, licking it and slowly drawing it out of his mouth, hoping to strike a nerve.
John rolled his eyes, twining his feet with Sherlock’s to keep warm. “You know very well the digestive system doesn’t work like that. Food doesn’t sit in the stomach for days, slowly being eaten away.”
“The Ponds!” the Doctor exclaimed. “So I send you off to live with them, too? Oh, brilliant. How old were you? No, wait, don’t tell me—I imagine things will fall into place now that you’re settled in with Wilf. Blimey, he didn’t even recognize me when I dropped you off. I had some explaining to do. Did you know, Hamish, he was there with I died for the 9
Sherlock sniffed. “Well, look who’s the expert on self-care now. Do everyone a favour, Molly, and stop trying to fix people!” He pulled a pill bottle from his robe pocket, counting out another dose to take.
That all changed when Jim pulled away and shoved him against the bed, nearly sending him teetering over. “No need to go so soft on me, kitten,” he said, then grabbed a fistful of John’s hair, yanked his head to the side, and bit his neck, hard, grinding his hips against John’s obscenely.
“Right, so one of us will be dying, and then the other will be moving out of the country for a fresh start. Not the tidiest of endings, but it’s perhaps the most realistic one we could develop. So, I can be the one that dies. I have experience in that field.”
Jim stayed where he was, silent for a moment. “What's your angle, John? Honestly, I'm curious, because I'm having a hard time figuring it out.”
“He’s just like you, Dad! He’s really smart and really interesting and he’s always pushing me to be cleverer, and he laughs when I show up the other students! You
God, this was too much to put on the shoulders of a nine year old. John looked down at him and nodded grimly, but Hamish nodded back.
“Where have the wife and kid gone off to, Sherlock?” Jim asked, his voice nasal and taunting. “Bright little Hamish and his dear doctor dad?”
Tears burned in John’s eyes. His voice was fierce. “If you could bring back your husband and keep your son safe, wouldn’t you do anything?
Feeling that he was intruding, John silently backed out of the door and closed it behind him. He had no idea what a Holmes farewell would entail, but he felt they should at least have some privacy.
“The author,” The Doctor said. “Brilliant man, forever having adventures himself, when he wasn’t writing them.”
Jane hardly had all of the details of Jim and John’s arrangement, but she knew that John was being held against his will and that he wasn’t to communicate with anyone outside Jim’s circle. Her voice caught nervously as she stammered, “You-you know you’re not supposed to be sending out mail, sir…I-I…” She put down her vegetable knife, her hands shaking as she thought of what Moriarty would do to her. “…I don’t know, sir…I’m sorry…if Mr. Moriarty found out…I…” She looked at the floor.
“We’re fairly certain the Doctor had something to do with your…genesis, but we’re not sure. How old are you?”
"Go ahead, then," Ursula said, looking the detective up and down curiously. Elton handed her over, and Sherlock ran his hands along the corners and back, searching for some sort of mechanism that would allow the oddity to be explained.
Sherlock stared him up and down for moment. He was close enough that his hot breath was hitting John’s cheek.
“W-what did you hear?” John choked out, and Jim tightened his grip on his neck, his thumb digging into John's pulse point.
Jim sat back in his chair and looked up at John darkly. He tapped his fingers on his desk. “Obviously you would. Anything to keep your precious Sherlock and Hamish safe from my evil grasp, isn’t that right?”
Sherlock groaned and arched his back, beginning to unbutton his and then John’s trousers before running his hands up John’s back, feeling scars there that hadn’t been there before. His stomach turned, but that vanished when John leaned in to kiss Sherlock with more fervency, pushing him back onto the bed. John’s hands were everywhere now, growing frantic. He murmured into Sherlock’s mouth, “God—I want you—“
“We’ll understand if you want to stay, Hamish,” John said, wrapping an arm around the boy’s thin shoulders.
A month of very cautious investigation led John to the key name: Burke. Burke was the one assigned to kill John should John kill Moriarty. Of this John was fairly certain. John began watching Burke closely, assessing his style, finding his weaknesses.
! Don’t try and distract me.” He whined, annoyed, “You’re ruining my build up to your death! Can’t you just shut up for a moment? I’m going to have to start all over now!”
Sherlock pushed the door open half expecting to see it just how they left it, with John’s laptop on the table, the stone angels frozen near the kitchen, and his violin propped in its usual spot.
“Why, Sherlock Holmes!” The jovial voice came from behind him. Sherlock whirled around to see the Doctor grinning at him. He was dressed as he was before, in his antiquated bowtie, ridiculous suspenders, and too-short trousers. The only thing that was different was the top hat perched on his head. “Look at you! I just popped out to have a look, see if you were getting on all right.”
When he opened the door, Jim was waiting for him, sitting on the bed. He didn't look up from examining his nails as he said in a bored tone, “Take your clothes off.” He picked a hangnail.
this way. It’s like…if you were on a case and there was nothing at stake, and the world would continue on regardless of whether you solved it or not, but it was so incredibly
“Sherlock, you’re being ridiculous! This isn’t even up for discussion. I’m not some fickle berk who’s going to run off with someone else, so stop being such a self-pitying mope.”
“I’ve told you what matters,” the Doctor said, then looked between them and sighed. “You’re not going to like it if I tell you.”
“Right. But didn’t the Doctor say were in some kind of…parallel time…pocket thing? Like an alternative universe? So if we go back we, I dunno, close up the pocket or something?” John groaned in frustration. “I’m getting a headache just thinking about this!
“Really? Couldn’t tell,” John said, raising his eyebrows and skimming the paper. “Maybe we should just move somewhere with more interesting crime, since you’ve locked all the decent criminals up. We could go to New York City…or Liverpool.”
“Nice to have some youthful energy around here again, isn’t it?” John hung his bowler on the hat stand and walked over to kiss Sherlock.
here…here in front of him, forced to watch it all…that makes it even better for him. The man he respects the most in the whole world, watching him succumb to his dirty little pleasure. What could be more humiliating than that?” Magnussen said, his cold eyes turning to Sherlock.
Hamish shifted uncomfortably for a moment before digging something out of his trouser pocket. He handed John his own wallet. “I just wanted to see who you were…and your medical identification was in there…” He raised his eyes to meet John’s regretfully.
John grinned into his pint glass. “Maybe next time we see him—if he ever turns up—you can ask to vivisect him. Maybe his species is fine with that.”
He turned to leave, but John grabbed his arm, feeling injured. “Why did you have to do that? I mean…you don’t feel anything for me…do you?”
Sherlock chuckled lowly. “I almost didn’t recognize him at first…if he keeps this up, in a few years, he’ll be taller than
Jim kept his back to him as he removed his tie, waistcoat and shirt, neatly putting each in its proper place in his wardrobe. Once topless and shoeless, Jim turned as he unbuttoned his pants and looked up to take in every inch of John, a smirk on his face. He finished removing his clothing then crawled onto the bed behind the kneeling John and reached around, letting his hands run across his chest, one going up to grab at John's throat again, the other moving down to brush against and then grab at John's cock.
Sherlock was still staring at the wall. It looked the same as it did before, but he could still see where the glowing cracks had been in his head, their precise lengths and curvatures.
Sherlock sprung to his feet and dashed to the window to look, his breath catching. “Don’t blink, John, keep your eyes fixed on it.” He muttered to himself, “Think… think think think…they can’t move while you’re watching them…would a recording device count as eyes? The assassin’s camera is still in the drawer…I could set it up…if it get’s into the room…it would be stuck…right?”
Sherlock slammed the door behind them, and John pulled away long enough to say, “You started smoking again. Idiot,” before pressing his mouth back to Sherlock’s, pressing into him.
He gave her a final look of gratitude and a short nod before leaving the kitchen, thinking. He had, for the most part, gained Jim’s trust as far as a job was concerned, but if Jim was ever going to let him go to London, he would have to believe that John had put Sherlock out of his mind entirely.
“So...how do you want me?” He looked up to meet Sherlock's eyes, awaiting orders as he began to unbutton his own shirt.
The Doctor’s steely expression softened and he ducked under the angel to face Sherlock directly. His voice was an almost reverent whisper. “Sherlock Holmes. You’ll just have to trust me. I’m the Doctor.”
John raised his eyebrows. He’d read up a bit on Mr. Doyle after they’d met him, and it seems that he was quite the spiritualist, but it was still strange thinking about a grown, intelligent man trying to convene with spirits.
Molly hurried to the toilet, uncapping the bottles and dumping the pills down the toilet, then flushing them down. Sherlock feebly tried to stop her, then leaned against the doorframe and watched forlornly as the pills were flushed away. Molly turned back to him and gripped his shoulders.
He shoved John backwards, forcing John to fall back onto the sofa. He haulted himself to a sitting position, glaring up at Jim. He restrained himself from leaping up and strangling him; he needed to know where Hamish was, and until he did, he’d have to play along.
“Well, he’s called the Doctor, and he’s really funny—and really weird,” Hamish added, frowning a bit. “But he pops in every now and then to say hi. He usually ends up breaking something on accident.”
Hoping the move would put Jim in a good mood, John sat up, running his hand up Jim’s arm as he did, then leaned forward to kiss him gently on the mouth.
Once Jim had yanked off his belt, he swung the buckled end against John’s face, leaving an angry red welt against John’s cheek. John cried out in pain and surprise, clutching his face.
John frowned. "Who, our ageless police box man? 'The Doctor?' That sounds like a drug dealer. Maybe Duncan was drugged. That would explain how Duncan saw…what he saw," he ventured.
Sherlock rose, baffled and furious, as the Doctor strolled over to his TARDIS and stepped in, ignoring John’s “wait!” and closing the door.
More often than not, Jim gave John most Fridays off, so every other week John picked up a habit of visiting Hamish in the afternoon, not coming back until after dinner, when all of Jim’s lackeys and employees had returned to their respective homes. It was on one of these nights that John came home to find the front door slightly ajar.
Moriarty struggled to free himself for a moment, glaring up at John, then a smile broke out on his face. “Oh, John, you are
John bristled, yanking open the door. “She’s making a scarf for you as well, you know. Navy blue. Like your old one. There’s nothing wrong with making friend. Just because you never bothered with them doesn’t mean us ‘normals’ can’t.” Once again, he wanted to swallow back his words. He knew how childish he sounded, but instead of apologizing or trying to backtrack, he left, slamming the door before Sherlock could yell back a retort.
Jim smiled. “You’re only a bag of bones like the rest of us, Sherlock. Although…perhaps you’re right. Perhaps I’ll just tell them to start by getting rid of that lovely housekeeper you’ve got. Cute little thing, isn’t she? And of course, I could give my men the option of
“Oh-“ John’s breath caught as he realized how fucked it up was that he still defaulted to subservience, then he pushed aside the thought and laughed. “All right!” He slid his tongue up to Sherlock’s navel and kissed just above it before sitting up. He was halfway in the process of making Sherlock roll over when he changed his mind, steering him so that he was lying on his back once more. He slid off Sherlock’s trousers completely, then stood on his knees to shakily remove his own.
John gave a muffled, frustrated cry as he felt the scarf knot behind his head. He was almost glad that he was gagged—as humiliating as it was, it was turning him on far more than he would ever admit.
Elton Pope had urged Sherlock not to bother trying to find the Doctor, but he'd agreed to meet John and Sherlock at his flat the following Saturday.
“Listing them all would be a tedious process for both of us, John. Remember, on that first day, I asked you…”
“I want to go. 1895, that’s when Queen Victoria lived! And people rode in carriages, and Britain had a huge empire! Could we go to India, like Rudyard Kipling? What’s life going to be like? What are schools like? What kinds of clothes will I have to wear?”
“From the results I’m getting, I find that hard to believe,” Sherlock murmured, moving a hand up to tangle in John’s hair. “And John…the attraction is mutual.”
to meet them. And you will.” He clapped Sherlock on the shoulder. “It’s been fantastic, it really has. Sherlock and Dr. Watson in the TARDIS.”
Mary sighed, finally giving up, and bobbed a curtsey. “If there’s anything else you need, I’ll be tending to Mr. Doyle downstairs,” she said, and disappeared.
John panted and fell backwards, catching himself with his hands. He was glad he didn’t have to swallow. He stretched his jaw and then stowed Jim away, then carefully rebuttoned Jim’s trousers and slid back up. “Was that proof enough?”
“He didn’t want me to tell you, but I thought you should know.” That’s what Sherlock had told John to say. It would be the most believable thing, he said. John pulled out the MRI scan and handed it over.
“Romantic” was not a word that agreed with Sherlock. He had removed himself so far from anything of the sort for decades, but now, he was frustrated to find, his mind kept drifting back to the kiss. It had been so short, and so
Jim growled, opening John’s revolver. “Three bullets left? This was supposed to be a one-bullet job! I thought you were supposed to be
He leaned back over John and pressed his hand against John’s throat once more, this time hard enough that John couldn’t breathe properly. “I thought I told you to stay put?” His voice was soft, but his hand came out of nowhere to slap John across the face, startling him more than hurting him.
“I can see you in the oven reflection, you know,” Hamish said slyly. “Also, this toaster’s highly inefficient! Do you know how I know? I can feel the hot air all over my face, which means heat isn’t being conserved properly. Plus the knob is sticky and it’s really old.”
me for making a living so you can afford to sit around thinking or walking aimlessly looking for cases because you’re too
What had John expected? A compliment? Some act of mercy? He had asked for this, John reminded himself. He had to play the part. He rolled back into a kneeling position, then braced his hands against the bed, forcing himself to relax, trying not to think of the pain. John hoped Jim would ease in somehow. It was impossible to tell what he’d do.
And that’s when Magnussen pulled away completely, leaving John panting and desperate. John made a needy noise through the gag, and Magnussen smiled, stepping behind the kneeling, panting man. He pulled a napkin from his pocket and wiped his hands. “…And sometimes it doesn’t even take a touch,” he said to Sherlock, then leaned down to John’s ear, so close that his lips brushed them. His voice was intimate, but it was loud enough for Sherlock to hear.
it was fun. Victorian London was a shiny new toy to play with. It had new places to see, new people to kill, new items to steal…but you know something, Sherlock? Things never change…” Jim’s voice rose and he paced to the window. “
Half an hour alter, they arrived at a townhouse. It wasn’t particularly lavish or extravagant, but there was a posh, sophisticated air about it. It was one of several that Jim owned in London, but it was the one he resided in the most frequently.
“Your knife…sort of…shifted.” He flicked his eyes to the sheets. “Erm…just thought you should know…”
Jim grabbed a third rope and looped it around John's neck, tying it off and holding the end like a leash. Just as John was wondering what Jim planned to do with it, Jim yanked his legs apart and shoved into him without warning, immediately thrusting hard and fast.
“Sherlock, we’re a bit baffled here—there’ve been six disappearances from Barrington Arms in Brixton, and the witness accounts are telling us nothing. Would you mind popping round? I’ll text you the address.”
“I see him! Come on!” Sherlock and John followed him across the room and approached the back of a dark-haired man in a top hat. Sherlock clears his throat as Hamish reaches out to tug on the man’s sleeve. The man turned around and John and Sherlock stared in horror at James Moriarty.
“Not long. Maybe a year? He spent a bit of time with Mr. and Mrs. Williams, and with this nice old man named Wilfred. He’s been moved around a lot, I’m afraid, but in good homes. And he’s gotten a good education. He’s so smart, that one, that he got into a really good school. He might be too smart, sometimes.”
“Shit.” John hurriedly sent the image to the scanner in the next room and shut down the computer. “Shit, shit, I’m in trouble.”
but a clone combining the DNA of both you and Watson. This created, essentially, well…a child. Of sorts.”
John and Sherlock followed the Doctor uncertainly inside a hallway that was eerily similar to the 221 of their day. “Who lives in the flat upstairs?” he asked the woman, who was knocking on the door that would have been Mrs. Hudson’s flat in modern day.
“And I believe you, of course I do: here you are, living proof. But it’s still wrong. It’d be like if Lord Nelson was living down the street. It’s in the
Sherlock murmured into John’s mouth, “Oh, shut up. As if you haven’t been a complete flirt. Proper Victorian housemaids don’t kiss their employers without some form of approval. You’ve been leading her on since you got here.” He ran his fingers through John’s hair, pausing to kiss him more deeply, then mumbled, “Idiot…”
for two men to have a child. And neither of us would have willingly elected for having a child at any rate.”
Jim gnashed his teeth as he got closer to climax and reached one hand up to clutch at the back of John’s neck, the other reaching around to jerk him off.
During the three days John spent extra time with Hamish and thought endlessly of Sherlock. He almost felt like a free man. He wanted to write to him. He wanted to
John thought back to the “hound” from Baskerville. They’d had experience with scary beasts people “saw” before.
“The most seen at any given time is four, from what residents have told them.” Lestrade looked at it with interest. “It is a bit eerie, isn’t it? It’d look more fitting in a cemetery.”
John kept struggling, pulling his wrists against the belt, unsure of whether he wanted to get free anymore or not, but finding it felt good to try. He couldn’t stop writhing and bucking against Jim’s every touch. It was an addictive madness, sending hot fury through every particle of John’s being.
John pulled Sherlock into a kiss, glad for the privacy of their flat. “Be careful. I wish I had my service revolver.”
It was a reasonable enough request from Doyle’s perspective, but an entirely daunting task for John and Sherlock, who had no identification or proof of their credentials at all.
Doyle stuttered, torn between his instinct to turn conversation back to more proper subjects and his relish for such a juicy story. “There have been five in the past month—all the victims took a knife to the heart
Johnny. No need to get defensive about it. I imagine it got dirty by O’Seanassy’s brains smearing across it?”
Sherlock gave an exhausted chuckle. “Worth it,” he said, then gently took John’s wrist in his and kissed the inside of it.
Jim ripped his wrists away from John, not liking being pinned, and grabbed the sheet in his fists, shuddering at John’s touch.
“He left of his own volition. It’s time we led our separate lives, and I intend to give him his space.”
“You could always chew tobacco, boss. It would turn your teeth a lovely brown,” John said drily. “Maybe it would instill fear in your enemies.”
Duncan began rattling one off. “He had a ridiculous haircut, all floppy on one side, and brown. Youngish, looked to be in his late twenties both then and now. His face was all forehead and chin, and deep-set eyes. Bowtie, tweed jacket, very thin trousers, funny little boots and red braces. And he liked to talk very, very fast…does that help?”
Jane gave a short “Oh!”, then there was a brief silence before she called out, “S-sorry Mr. Moriarty, Dr. Watson—” She peeked around the corner. “J-just dropped a platter, is all.” She disappeared and John buried his head in his book once more.
John couldn't help laugh along with him. "That's it then! We've both gone mad. Something in the sugar, maybe?"
“Sorry—old habits.” He handed Jim his shirt and helped him pull it on—movement in his shoulder was still restricted. “Can I ask why you hate the title…Jim?”
“Hamish, go to our room,” Sherlock whispered “It’ll take far too long to explain you to our landlady.”
Sherlock stepped in and closed the door, and for a moment they stood in the hallway, looking at each other.
“It means we’re staying the night, and it means you can’t tell peole I’m not actually dying. The fact that John is calling himself a big gay slut is amusing but irrelevant. I highly suggest you lock your flat door tonight.”
“I know! But there was last week. Came out of nowhere, it did. And disappeared just as suddenly! I went back a few hours later and it was gone.”
John noticed, as his trembling hands began unbuttoning his shirt, that there were several ropes and a gag lying on the bed near Jim's feet. He couldn't help gulping. Jim usually only tied him when he'd had a bad day, and John always came away sore from it. The casual, bored tone to Jim's voice was a red flag as well. What was he so angry about?
Sherlock was too busy looking the Doctor over, fascinated despite the absurdity of it all. He finally got out his phone and began dialing Duncan. “Does the name Duncan Reynolds II ring a bell? The Blitz in London? He says you saved his life when he was a child.”
Sherlock hungrily looked around, finding the flat harder to decipher than he was used to, since so many of the items were out of his historical context. “What are you writing?” he couldn’t help asking.
Hamish gave Doyle a knowing look as he handed over the gravy boat a bit unsteadily. “We’ve been in Liverpool for the past few years.”
The week after Hamish left, John woke to the sound of a loud crash from downstairs followed by a shout of rage. John quickly dressed and went downstairs. He tentatively looked around the corner into the drawing room to see Jim is angrily pacing back and forth, kicking things that get in his way. John noted the remains of a vase next to a wall, then his eyes flicked back to Jim and found the consulting criminal staring at him dangerously, his usually neat hair sticking up in all directions, as if he’d been clawing his fingers through it over and over. Jim suddenly closed his eyes, then it was as if someone had flipped a switch when he opened them again. His face was serene and he smiled at John, smoothing back his hair. “I’m going out. You can have the day off.”
Sherlock didn’t answer as he removed his coat, hung it up, and went to his microscope. He didn’t put a slide underneath it, he just stared through at the illuminated white spot underneath. “John…I’m sorry that I…I had thought that you…” He clamped his mouth shut. “I should have believed you.”
As Sherlock pushed John’s legs apart and brushed his fingers teasingly over John’s aching cock, John groaned loudly, twitching his hips up towards Sherlock, and slid his hands to Sherlock’s shoulders, unable to keep from touching him anymore.
“I’ve got him. He’s fine—he’s all right—everyone’s fine, John.” Sherlock wrapped his arms around John, pulling him up against him, not having any intention of ever letting go of him again. His voice cracked as he held on. “394 days…394 days since I’ve been able to do this.”
Once off, Sherlock pushed John back against the bed again, arching his back to press his chest against John’s. He could feel John’s small gasp as he slid a hand up to John’s throat, gently clutching at it as he licked along his jaw.
Jim rolled onto his back and pulled the knife from the bed. He held it up to the morning night streaming through the windows, turning it to let the light bounce off the blade and dance along the walls. “No. I guess not.”
Sherlock didn't pull back until the pool of blood seeping from Jim’s body started wetting Sherlock’s knees. He pulled John up with him, then leaned forward and gave John a wet kiss, gentle and sad and passionate.
Don’t be predictable Sherlock, it’s unbecoming on a man of your caliber. If I don’t walk out of here in an allotted amount of time—unharmed, I might add—“ he looked down pointedly at his own feet, which were now barely grazing the floor. “—They will kill John. I know, not my most creative bit of work, but it’s certainly effective…isn’t it?”
John gave a muffled, pleading yell, shaking his head back and forth frantically and yanking as hard as he could against his restraints. He was utterly trapped and overwhelmingly full, to the point where he could barely think straight.
“What ever made you think that John and I would end up together? Just because I was never interested
They had the decency to at least pretend that they were look at exhibits on their way up, but they were quick about ducking inside the room. It was empty, as expected, and John wasted no time in yanking Sherlock into a secluded corner, pushing him against the glass case to kiss him.
Sherlock snatched up the paper, hungrily reading through the article, an expression of annoyance creeping onto his face the more he reads. Finally he drops the paper back onto the pile. “Drabble, all of it. I see the quality of journalism hasn’t changed…from Liverpool,” he amended hastily. “I’m going out tonight.”
many girlfriends, Sherlock? What will it take to convince you that I’m not lying?” What would it take to convince
“Absurd doesn’t even begin to cover it! We’ve been together for less than a month, and he’s a 10-year-old boy! Even if this
Jim grabbed a bottle of some sort of oil from his bedside table and slicked his fingers with it, then shoved two fingers into John without warning, curling them against John’s prostate in a way that made John arch his back and curl his toes, wanting more.
Oh, God. That idea shouldn’t have excited John as much as it did. “You might have a mutiny on your hands if you don’t.” John shifted his hips experimentally.
He grabbed John’s shoulders and kissed him. John gave a muffled noise of surprise, then pushed him away. “A kiss doesn’t qualify as an answer! You think I’d let myself be trapped in another century with a man I’d flippantly dump a month later?”
Sherlock yanked his hands away, letting Jim fall back to his feet, and Jim straightened his suit, annoyed. “We both know this little arrangement can’t last long. I will find you within a day with the whole of Scotland Yard at my back. Child abduction warrants a long jail sentence, even in 1895. Don’t tell me you expect me to let you leave with John and Hamish.”
Sherlock struggled to free his wrists from John’s grip, but John moved to grasp both of Sherlock’s wrists with one hand, the other moving to his throat to pin it against the bed, then he licked along Sherlock’s cheekbone, traveling his mouth to his ear. “I said I’m sorry. Your turn.”
“This is my son, Hamish Watson. I’m a widower and Sherlock was my wife’s…brother. He’s helping me look after him, as we are both bachelors.”
Sherlock cut him off. “Craig, we met Hamish today and he led us to believe you know the Doctor. Is that right?”
John killed the men he had to and avoided Baker Street altogether, reuniting with the other men and heading back to Dublin without delay. John wanted to be sure that Jim remained convinced that John was infatuated with him, especially after the trip to London, so close to Sherlock.
Sherlock glared down at Hamish, but sighed and said with some difficulty, “I’m…sorry. Forgive my rudeness.”
When Sherlock returned home far after dark, John was in his chair, reading. It was the first time Sherlock had seen him looking settled in the flat since the kiss.
Mary looked at the two men with a new level of respect, which quickly faded when Sherlock asked conversationally, “So, when did your husband die? No more than a month, surely?”
off of crime, Mr. Doyle. I’m a consulting detective—the only one in the world. I invented the job. Is there more information on the case in the paper?” Sherlock asked Doyle.
Not knowing what else to do, John and Sherlock followed the strange man out into the street, stopping outside his phone box as he unlocked it. John was shocked to see it in reality; they’d spent so long searching for it, and here it was, astounding in how ordinary it looked. He touched it to make sure it was real.
He was enthralled, writing down everything, muttering things like, “Oh! Brilliant. Tell me again what you thought of him when you first met him?”
“JESUS!” He stumbled back from the window. “An angel, Sherlock! A stone angel, on the sidewalk below us! Oh my God.”
Jim squealed with joy at Sherlock’s reaction, some taunting laughter escaping his lips. He shrugged as best as he could, pinned as he was. “All right, you’ve caught me…I
He struggled to meet Jim's light, conversational tone as he lied, “I went the pub for a drink or two with the lads, had a bit of a walk.”
. It managed to get displayed in an esteemed museum, after all. It has, uhh, historical significance and the color use on…that one—“ He gestured vaguely at a crumbly fresco. “—It’s…really…exquisite…” John traied off lamely.
John’s breath caught and he raked his hands across Sherlock’s bum, kissing him again. “I want you inside of me.”
changed things for reasons I can’t understand yet.” They headed back to the TARDIS and stepped back inside.
He spent the next week alerting the homeless network, giving them a description of the bowtied man and the blue box. For days there was nothing, then one day Sherlock came home with a bounce in his step.
Lestrade was outside Barrington Arms to greet them when Sherlock and John got out of their cab. “Sherlock, you’re not going to believe what we found up there—“
“Our situation is very similar to an aneurysm in the sense that we don’t know when or if we will ever…disappear.”
"Well, depends on where in his time stream he is. He's a time traveler, isn't he? His timeline doesn't follow a neat, straight line. I could see him today and he could be 926, and I could see him tomorrow at 903."
When John poked his head in Jim’s room, he found him sitting on one side of the bed. He gazed at John for a moment, quizzically. “Well?”
“I don’t know…it would seem an impossibility, if we hadn’t been in 1895 an hour ago.” He checked the time on his phone. “…More than. The Doctor should be back by now.” He drummed his fingers on his chair for a moment, then lept up. “To hell with waiting for him! Since when do I need
Jim rolled his eyes. “You’re no fun at all. You don’t like puzzles like Sherlock. Straight to business, aren’t you, Doctor Watson?” Jim’s eyes glinted before he sighed and examined his nails. “To answer your question, Hamish it at school. Right where he should be.”
Jack set his coffee down and his smile dropped away. “You listen to me. If the Doctor tells you to do something, you do it. He always has everyone’s best interest in mind.”
“Oh, come off it! Listen to yourself. We’re not going to go living in the past—the Doctor told us about the angels, and now that we know how they take people, we can avoid them. What if we were meant to go today? We’ve already changed history.”
The stone angel stood between the desk and the kitchen, staring blank-eyed straight ahead, one arm reaching out towards John. Sherlock fixed his eyes on it immediately.
Once the shirt was unbuttoned, John leaned down to slowly pick from Sherlock’s navel to his chin, tasting him. Sherlock tipped his head back and sighed, involuntarily sucking in his ghost of a stomach as John’s hot wet tongue traveled across it. He clawed down John’s back before he stroked up John’s arms and shoulders, then continued unbuttoning John’s shirt and pushed it off his shoulders. His biceps had grown and hardened considerably since they’d last been together. John felt harder in general, more trim, but it was still his John. He touched his bullet wound affectionately, letting his fingers trail through the light dusting of blonde hair.
As they stepped outside the flat, a handsome man in a blue wool coat spun around to look at them expectantly.
Sherlock went to his wardrobe for the first time in weeks to find clothes that weren’t pyjamas, and John pulled on the clothes he already had.
“Have a bit of self-respect. Time to play ‘follow the trail of clothes,’” John muttered, gathering up his socks and trousers.
They stepped inside the café and got an unobtrusive table where they could talk more comfortably. Sherlock began laying out what they knew of the Doctor, and the original case that he'd taken to solve.
Jim didn’t arrive until 7 pm. John was sitting, drumming his fingers on his knee in the drawing room and pretending to read a book.
Jim held himself inside for a moment, waiting for John’s muscles to stop spasming around him, then began to pump in and out of John at a fast rate. “Sherlock’s loyal pet—giving me a treat out of his own free will. Did Christmas come early, kitten?”
“Tucking in…what does that all entail?” Sherlock murmured as they climbed the stairs. He himself had never been tucked into bed as a child. He’d heard it referenced, but had never seen the significance.
Sherlock was still looking questioningly at John. “I don’t know,” John said in answer to his look. “I hardly fit to be a parent. I wouldn’t know the first thing, and we know we’ll be in 1895 in the very new future. Are we supposed to take Hamish with us? We’re going to be there, stranded, without money or jobs or connections and have to start all over. I’m properly worried about how we’ll take care of
existed in the 1800s. It means we’ve already grown old and died. It means that Conan Doyle should already have written the books. If this is the case, our lives should be on a loop. We start our lives here, then go back there, time goes on, we die, then we are born again here in the 70s then are sent back again! We would only live once, but if we are sent back, then us living there has already
“I’ll never stop hating you,” John said. The heavy opium smoke was getting to him, clouding his brain. He was finding it harder and harder to stay conscious. He was vaguely aware that Jim had sidled in to sit beside him, gripping his shoulders to keep him sitting upright.
Sherlock obliges, shoving the hat down on his head and bore it for a few seconds while Hamish grinned in delight. “Wow…I have a famous dad,” he breathed.
“I don’t think we’ve seen the last of them, John,” Sherlock said. “The Doctor rattled on about holes in the pockets. He was set on sending us back. It seems—inevitable. The only good thing that I can see from all of this is that it would seem that even if someone is sent back, this world continues as is. It doesn’t pivot specifically around the existence of any specific being. If we get winked out of existence, at least that doesn’t mean there will be some sort of apocalypse here. Everyone will just keep on living. We’ll just be gone.”
Jim shoved his lips against John’s in a forceful kiss, prying John’s mouth open with his tongue, searching every inch of John’s mouth.
John turned away to gingerly rub his bruised lips. When he stood up pain shot through his back, but he couldn’t help but feel a bubble of hope rise up in him as he limped to his room to change. The kiss this morning had proved it; Jim was convinced that John wanted him, which meant John was one step closer to getting back to London
“You don’t recognize either of these men?” The Doctor asked. “The name Sherlock Holmes doesn’t ring any bells?”
“I suppose you’ll be wanting a housekeeper then. I’m glad to provide my services. I’m experienced, and my rates are reasonable. I’m a fine cook, Mr. Doyle says so.”
Sherlock watched him, kissing his eyelids and lips gently. He’d spent so many nights alone that it seemed impossible that John was really here next to him. He almost didn’t want to fall asleep in fear that John wouldn’t be here when he woke up, as illogical as it was. “…Goodnight, John,” Sherlock murmured, his eyelids drooping despite his efforts.
“You’re going to be a much better father than I will,” Sherlock said as they went into their own bedroom.
Sherlock stared down at John incredulously, his chest still gasping for air. “G-God…no…John. I-I want you to fuck me, John—
Mary blushed at his rude gaze, then dropped her eyes to the floor and nodded, her voice barely a whisper. “What’ve you done with John and Hamish…sir?”
John found a chink of hope. Of course, Sherlock would come and find Hamish and him, even if John wasn’t able to run away. “Sherlock will find us. He always does.”
Sherlock didn't push John, letting him take the lead, kissing him back slowly, his hands still on John’s face, then slowly ran one through his hair and down his back to rest at his hip, the other sliding down to rest at the side of his neck, his thumb softly running back and forth under his ear.
“St. Bart’s, please,” Sherlock instructed the driver. With any luck, Molly would still be there working.
Sherlock stopped and looked at him in amusement, then was taken off guard as John pulled on his coat lapels, yanking his head down for a kiss as people walked by gawking.
“What did I tell you, Sherlock?” Magnussen said, stroking John harder through his trousers. “The whole world is wet to my touch…”
John shook his head, unable to believe they were having this conversation. “We say goodbye and then…we just give in?”
“Don’t touch my things. You’re ruining the dust line.” He placed it back on the mantle carefully. “I was warned that you would talk quickly, Doctor, but I didn’t expect to hear you babble nonsense. Why would my flat be a museum? And what business would I have being in 1895?”
Jim took a step closer so that their shoes were nearly touching. They were improperly close. He removed his hat and tipped his neck to both sides, cracking it loudly, then moved his lips to whisper in her ear, his voice cold and low. “That’s not really any of your business, is it?”
John wasn’t to be paid until after the first week, and the rent on 221B was 2 guineas a week. They paid Doyle the last of his own money save for a few farthings, then stepped up to see the flat.
Mycroft blinked rapidly and looked at the floor. “In primary school, when you used to knick the headmaster’s keys to use the lab—remember that? As Head Boy I was always the one put in charge of finding out where the keys were, and I had to pretend to be mystified. You were a little bastard.” He laughed softly.
like the danger. If he set his morals aside, he found the job satisfying on some base level. But he felt empty and alone without Sherlock. He had to keep satisfying Jim, John told himself, if he was ever going to get back to Sherlock.
Jim wrapped his arm around John and licked up his cheek, then kissed him fully on the mouth before he rolled over to sleep, leaving John panting and tethered to the bed, feeling self-disgust and confusion wash over him.
“You need to have a bit more faith in the TARDIS, Sherlock Holmes! She’s never landed on anyone—well, just the once. But honestly, he deserved it.” The Doctor grinned and surveyed the living room, then his smile faltered a bit as he took in the cluttered flat that was still overrun by ashtrays and stacks of file folders. “Am I bit late?” He checked his watched and tapped on it.
“He does that,” John said apologetically. “But don’t worry, if Sherlock’s taken your case, he’ll solve it. You’re in good hands.”
John fell into silence and found himself wanting to know everything about Hamish. Whether he plays football like John had, or whether he sat inside with a microscope during recess like Sherlock must have done. He wanted to see the boy’s room. What did he keep on his bookshelves? What sorts of things did he draw? He couldn’t help hoping, against all odds, that Hamish was actually somehow their son.
John met his thrusts as they found their rhythm, growing increasingly fast and forceful. It wasn’t going to take him long at all to come, he knew. He tried to hold out as long as he could, but then Sherlock hit his prostate and he nearly lost it.
call me back. It’s like—it’s like they’ve been moving on their own. They used to be covering their eyes—now one is turned toward the window, as if looking out. Please call me back.
That night, John felt happier than he had in a long while. He curled around to protect his son’s body while he slept, not minding the pain in his back. If nothing else, John thought, he had kept his son safe so far. He had killed and done other unspeakable things, and he had abandoned Sherlock, but his son was safe in his arms, and that was almost enough for the moment.
“I already have faked my death twice. Have you forgotten my aneurysm so soon? Once more would make it three.”
There was a pause, rare in a conversation with Mycroft. He seemed genuinely surprised when he spoke again. "Goodness, who have
Jim grinned and laughed. “Working and at school. The day’s getting a bit late, isn’t it? Or had you been too wrapped up in your head to mind the clock again, my dear?” He tapped his fingers against his lips in mock concern. “Where could they be?”
John met his eye steadily. “You mean to say you don’t find it believable that I want to please you? I
and she took it the wrong way. Maybe if you weren’t excluding me from cases I wouldn’t be around her so often!”
It was barely a flicker of the eyelids for both of them, but when they stared at their angels again, they were directly in front of each man, inches away from them.
“…I might not be around to. It’s complicated, but Sherlock’s made requests for me to…go somewhere should he…die.” John was alarmed to find himself growing emotional, even though he knew Sherlock wasn’t really sick.
"I assume so. Look, maybe it'll be easier if I told you my story. What happened with me and the Doctor, I mean."
“Clean. Efficient. Good. You can have the rest of the day off. I don’t need you for anything else at the moment.”
Jim’s grin was slow-spreading, and he took a step towards John, then another and another, forcing John’s back against the wall. His hand darted to John’s throat and slammed him hard against the wall, his face devilish.
John turned his head to look at him. “There must be a way out of this. What if we smash the angels to bits? What if we don’t blink?”
Sherlock was growing bored. He had, one evening, when he was tired of talking to his skull, unearthed a long-buried bottle of opium pills, and had taken a couple to make the time go faster.
“I do.” Sherlock picked up the violin from where it rested by the hearth and played a couple of trills before setting it back down.
John didn’t’ understand how Sherlock did it. They had just time-travelled, and now Sherlock looked as bored as if they had popped out for a coffee at a corner shop. “Only you would call an alien who took us to 1895 ‘impolite.’ Didn’t
happen, or, as I said…rip in the pocket of the universe and everything goes a bit mad, or madder than usual…”
There certainly was a smell to Baker Street, and it seemed to roll off everything—the people, the buildings, the muck in the streets.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Jealous, Jim? I imagine your nights have been rather lonely without your dear Sebastian.” Jim’s jaw tightened ever so slightly, just for a moment, but Sherlock noticed. “Ooh, yes, I know all about you two and how you liked to be pushed around the bedroom. Liked having a few minutes of not having to think, did you? I’d tell him hello for you, but he’s dead or he will be, in our time. Shot right through the head. Bit ironic, considering his profession, don’t you agree?”
Sherlock rolled the dice. “This is completely unrealistic. This game should at least present you with the possibility that he committed suicide. He can’t be
John wondered if Mary had seen anything. She did seem to be giving Sherlock and him a strange look, but it quickly faded when she saw Hamish playing.
Hamish was right, the cards quickly showed, and he was unabashedly elated at winning. “This game’s brilliant! It’s like what Dad does, right?”
John’s face broke into a smile, and he caught Sherlock’s chin with his hand and kissed him. “Promise me one thing, though. That we won’t go on dates. I’m notoriously rubbish at them…unless crime scenes and late-night Chinese food count as dates. Those’re fine.”
Sherlock looked at the Doctor with a new respect. He understood entirely why the Doctor hadn’t told him and John about the plan; he would have done the same. No sense getting someone’s hopes up if there was a chance it could fail. Sherlock looked down at Hamish, who was still clinging to him. He would hardly consider Hamish any sort of failure, however.
“Mmm…” Jim turned his head a bit to the side, allowing John easier access. “That’s not what I meant, and you know it.”
Mary came in a few minutes later with a piping bowl of soup and another bowl of potatoes. She’d been employed as their housekeeper for several months now, and had learned that Sherlock could be blunt or hurtful or distracted, so she tried her best to stay out of his way. “I hope you like the soup,” she said, knowing there was a sizeable chance that he wouldn’t touch it.
Sherlock looked at the publishing name at the bottom of the website. "Looks like we'll be paying a visit to Mr. Elton Pope."
“Neither can I.” John’s voice was bitter, and Sherlock clenched his jaw, trying not to let John’s tone affect him.
Mrs. Hudson did indeed take the news of Sherlock’s “aneurysm” hard. There were many tears and awkward hugs, John doing his best to console her as Sherlock awkwardly hugged her back.
an idea. Start-up money,” Sherlock grinned, striding over to run a finger along the bare mantelpiece He felt a sudden stab of homesickness for the skull, the Cluedo board, his vast book collection, and most of all, his violin.
Marlene eyed him a bit suspiciously, but retrieved the file all the same. “Bring it back as soon as you’re finished.”
John kept his eyes trained on his book. “Just that Charles Dickens is severely overrated.” He glanced up. “How was your day?”
“All those crimes. The faceless ‘Professor’ organizing dozens of crimes throughout the city. It was you,” Sherlock muttered. “I’m glad you’re entertaining yourself,
Sherlock moaned and moved his foot along John’s ankle. John sucked faster, tightening his lips around Sherlock, then reached a hand down to touch himself, sucking and pumping the base of Sherlock’s cock with his free hand.
.” John's voice was a hollow monotone. “I don’t care anymore, Jim…just tell me what happened and I’ll go peacefully. Fucking give me the gun and I’ll do the job for you. Just
“Bit of a cheeky kid, isn’t he?,” John muttered to Sherlock. “He reminds me of another pompous git I know.”
dense, I wouldn’t have bothered with you. Just know that before you do anything rash tonight, I have arranged for Sherlock, Mary, and the man you were renting from to all be taken care of should something happen to me, be it murder, accident or otherwise. So be on your best behavior, Johnny, because if I go…so do they. Understood?”
. You know who goes behind a boss’s back to ask questions? Someone who’s meddling in things they shouldn’t. Now.
John’s heart hammered as the safety was released, but before O’Seanassy could fire, his jaw was grabbed from behind and his neck was snapped. He crumpled too the ground and Jim was looking down at him with distaste.
Sherlock stood up, irritably brushing John off. “It wasn’t intentional. I needed a Bichon Frise and Ruby had one readily available.”
Sherlock was especially eager to take a look. Nothing held more clues to a personality than a bedroom, especially a child’s bedroom. Before even set foot into, the room he knew the child as well as he knew himself and John. It took his eyes seconds to scan over the room: bug collection on a shelf crammed with books, most of which were nonfiction, although there were several large stacks of adventure stories crammed in as well. His bed was unmade and there was a stack of gum wrappers on his bedside table, all different brands.
“ He grabbed the purse. “—Thank you, Hamish—we can hopefully afford some proper attire for you, and possibly get a…cab ride.” He eyed a passing carriage.
Jim puckered his lips a little and nodded, then rolled off the bed and slowly walked over to John, circling around behind him slowly before coming to a stop in front of him. Their eyes locked. Jim's expression was dark.
Jim finished writing before folding the letter and dripping sealing wax on the envelope, not bothering to look up.
John moaned, half out of frustration, half from anticipation and croaked out a yes. He forced himself to stop grinding and writhing, his wrists still strained against Sherlock’s hand.
John thought about it for the rest of the afternoon, pacing his living room and bedroom, walking up and down the staircase. He wondered how far he would go if it meant seeing Sherlock again. He would need to figure out what Jim wanted from him, and then give it to him as willingly as he was able.
Jim eyed John somewhat suspiciously as John crossed in front of him and climbed the steps to his bedroom.
The search at Notting Hill was fruitless. Sherlock texted a city maintenance contact to see if any police boxes had been sent or relocated to the area, or if he'd heard of any other reports concerning police boxes, with no luck.
The Doctor waved as she left. “Lovely woman, your landlady. Almost makes me wish I had a landlady.” He turned to Sherlock, looking
“Obviously,” Sherlock said into John’s mouth before kissing him deeply, gripping at John’s biceps and beginning to grind slowly against him. John ran his hand down Sherlock’s back, over his thighs and bum, pulling him closer. Sherlock attacked John’s neck with his mouth, causing John to gasp and arch his head back, and he began blindly unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt, hungry to touch Sherlock’s bare skin. “Although if you don’t want to, I won’t force you to,” Sherlock said coyly, pressing into him. His fingers were now at John’s nipples, and his tongue had found the spot under John’s ear that sent sparks down his spine.
Sherlock fervently kissed him back, yanking John’s coat off, grabbing at his neck with both hands, pulling him closer.
John tightened his grip on the suit lapels and stared into Jim’s soulless eyes. He had never felt such loathing for the man. “I could kill you right here, you know. I don’t need a gun, and there’s nobody here to see me. Now. Where. Is. My. Son?”
Just as John opened his own mouth to allow his own tongue to meet Sherlock’s, Sherlock pulled away and stuck the scarf in John’s mouth, wrapping it around John’s head and knotting it to gag him tightly.
? My, my, this city shall eat you up and spit you in the Thames in less than a fortnight,” Doyle proclaimed.
Sherlock unsteadily crawled next to him and collapsed as well, unable to speak. John searched Sherlock’s eyes, then touched his arm, as if to make sure Sherlock was really there. He looked him up and down. Sherlock, naked, next to him in bed. This was really happening. “Had you ever…with a man?”
“If you don’t want to watch, and I sincerely hope you don’t, I suggest you read the paper,” Sherlock murmured. “Not that there are any worthwhile crimes to read about,” he muttered.
“I know you think you need them but…you’re stronger than this. You’re…you’re one of the strongest people I know, and it just…I can’t bear to see you like this, Sherlock.”
A couple weeks later, Jim, John and Hamish were settled in to a Dublin townhouse fairly similar to the one in London. John and Hamish had to share a room for a few nights. Hamish cried himself to sleep on their last night together, nestled up against John.
Sherlock and Hamish watched the blue box whir and fade from the empty street corner. They returned home to John, who had gotten home from the hospital and was in his chair with a newspaper.
They stood back to back. Sherlock tapped a finger deliberately on John’s hand three times, then said, “Blink.”
John let himself be ridden, staring up in breathless wonder as he tried to think of anything more hot than Sherlock at this moment, impaling himself on John, his face screwed up in utter pleasure. John clenched his hands into fists and cursed the gag—he wasn’t going to be able to hold on much longer.
They stepped into Hamish’s room. Hamish was waiting in bed, sitting up expectantly. John sat on the edge of the bed, smoothing the covers as Hamish lay down. He tucked the blankets up to his chin and moved a hand over Hamish’s hair. Hamish closed his eyes, looking utterly peaceful. “Goodnight, Hamish. See you in the morning.” John kissed his forehead.
Sherlock shakily pressed himself up against John, wanting this more than ever thought he would. He gripped John’s sides and slowly pushed himself in, gasping as he did.
Hamish nodded, picking up his suitcase and looking around his room. “Will I get my own room living with you and Sherlock? How long are we staying in
Sherlock finally stood up, giving the mostly-bare fireplace mantel a once-over before finally turning to Jim, hands clasped behind his back. “Look at you—positively glowing. In the middle of a new scheme, I take it.” He tilted his head, considering his enemy.
“I’ve already texted him. He says he can get the right people to turn a blind eye.” Sherlock rubbed his thumb over the phone, wondering if that would be the last time he ever texted Mycroft.
“Oh, John, that’s hardly fair. I never even met that neurotic secretary.” Sherlock scratched his head, looking absently around the kitchen. It was nearing three in the afternoon, but he was still lounging around in a bathrobe and pyjamas.
“It’s just…your surname’s Watson…and mine’s Holmes-Watson, and what with you two snogging and all I thought—“ The boy looked up at them both, his eyes wide and full of hope. There was fear there, too, as if worried of being let down.
“You’re implying that I’m some sort of historical figure or a…a character from a book,” Sherlock laughed.
John swallowed and nodded, overwhelmed. He leaned forward and kissed Sherlock very carefully, slowly, slowly opening his mouth to the kiss, keeping his tongue out of it for now. He moved his fingers, exploratory, up Sherlock’s arms and to his face, touching his chin, his cheeks, before sliding his hands to rest behind Sherlock's ears.
John’s eyes were already beginning to strain. “Sherlock, what happens if I blink? It’s way down there—how’s I going to move in an eighth of a second?”
For the next week, Sherlock, John, and Hamish closed themselves in 221B. Sherlock took up his violin again, along with Hamish, who was starting up music lessons at his London school. John continued to tell Mr. Doyle and Mary about Sherlock’s other cases, as well as details about Dublin, leaving out the more upsetting parts of the story—parts he would relate to Sherlock later, in private.
John grabbed Sherlock’s neck to pull his head down until their lips were nearly touching. “You, sir, are brilliant.” He pulled Sherlock in for a kiss. Sherlock leaned into it, wrapping his arms around John, glad to finally have some alone time with him.
John scrubbed his face. He would love to know the answer to that question. “We’ve no idea, except that it’ll be soon. That’s why you must say goodbye to Craig and Alfie and Sophie today. All right?”
“ Wow! Adventure stories? I love those! Brilliant! I’ve never met a real writer before!” Hamish took another step toward Doyle to shake his hand, but tripped on the edge of the rug and smashed into him.
As they slid into bed, John remarked, “I can’t believe how quickly Hamish trusted us, as if…he grew up with us. He’s so comfortable around us.”
John grabbed Sherlock’s hand as he strode over to the map to scope the exhibits. “Which room d’you reckon has the fewest people?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Oh, that’s still going on? Isn’t it obvious? They’re all dirty cops. They’re getting paid to disappear. Dull.”
That was somehow worse than turning himself over to Jim and letting himself be taken. John pulled him closer to him by the edges of his shirt, then began kissing at his neck, biting lightly under his ear, then nibbling on the earlobe itself, which got a positive response.
Sherlock let out a short, exhausted laugh. “Lucky for us…we have the rest…of our lives…to make up for it…” He leaned over to kiss John again, dropping his face down on the pillow next to him so close their noses are almost touching. John blinked away a couple of happy tears as looked over at Sherlock, finally so close to him again, as it should be.
“Because 1895 could be around the corner. We just can’t be sure, Hamish, so it’s best you put yours on, too.”
Sherlock wiped an escaped tear off John’s cheek with his thumb. After a moment, he pulled away to grab the covers, untangle them a bit, and pull them over the two to keep them warm from the cool night. He set his head back where it was and let his eyes roam over John’s face, finding himself have to rememorize it as its changed so much.
Sherlock smiled to himself at John’s optimism as he threw on a t-shirt. He never gave up. His stalwart friend. He was glad to have him with him, despite everything.
John glared at him, then grabbed him by the neck with both hands and kissed him forcefully, making Sherlock’s knees buckle as John pushed his mouth open with his tongue, then pulled away to murmur, “I’m right here.”
Hamish sat back down on the bed as Sherlock began pacing and explaining everything as John sat next to him. He listened carefully as he rattled off information about how they met the Doctor, their run-ins with the weeping angels, and their plans to surrender and return to 1895.
"Yeah, he's got this thing he does: changes his entire cellular structure if he's about to die," Jack explained. "All Time Lords could do it."
What is the meaning of this, this flimsy pretense to inspect chimneys so that you can bombard me with absurd questions with no explanation? Clear out at once! Mary, show them the door!”
“See, John and I hadn’t even known each other nine and a half years ago, which leads me to deduce that time travel must have been involved. That’s all we know so far,” Sherlock finished.
“And other times he seemed like he was five! I don’t think it would be possible to sit down and have a proper conversation with him,” John said.
“Of course I think about him. But I would rather have him safe and unbothered by you than running for his life or dead. It’s better this way. And I’m coming to realize…” John leaned over to bite Jim's other ear. “You can offer me things he couldn’t. You keep me busy, make me feel needed. He was always trying to protect me.” John was disgusted to realize this was all true, in a way.
Jane was trembling ever so slightly, but her voice was calm. “I can do it, sir. I’ve done it before.”
As the weeks passed, sex with Jim became a routine, although it never felt routine. It was always terrifying and unsettling; Jim’s unpredictability meant John never felt at ease, but he began to learn what Jim liked and even, to his disgust, began liking it himself. Guilt would wash over him afterwards, but sometimes in the heat of the moment, John would forget about the Sherlock and disappear in the pleasure.
As he ran, Sherlock’s mind raced at the possibility that John could be gone by the time he got there. Gone forever. He pushed himself to run faster, flying up the stairs and bursting into the flat.
Jim was still rutting against John, whose struggles only made the friction more palpable. It didn’t take long for Jim to grab hold of John’s wrists and tether them together with the belt to the headboard, leaving John’s arms incapacitated and the rest of his body vulnerable.
Sherlock ground his teeth together and stormed up to the Doctor with every intention of clocking him in the face. “
Sherlock continued to stare off into the distance without noticing, eventually moving his steepled fingers up against his lips, and Hamish did the same, pretending to stare off into the distance.
Sherlock couldn’t help but find it amusing when John ranted. He got so worked up over the most trivial things. “I don’t believe
“I take it that the pocket universe has closed up tidily?” Sherlock asked. “If John and I came here for nothing—“
“Wait, how do we know that you didn’t read my blog then make that book up yourself, and bring us here for your own bizarre…alien agenda?” John offered up.
Sherlock let his mind wander back to the activities of the day, and how it compared to a typical day back home. He winced at thinking of the 21
“Sherlock, I heard some strange noises in the basement apartment last night. I wondered if you or John wouldn’t mind having a look. I’m worried that some animal might’ve gotten trapped down there, and I’m not up for dealing with that. My hip, you know—“
Jim looked John up and down. John had had to dispatch three men, which had gotten messy, and he’d suffered a few bruises on his face and some shallow cuts across his arm.
Magnussen ignored him, beginning to rub between John’s legs carefully and deliberately. “You see how he struggles with it? That’s the best part,” he said, watching John’s face earnestly.
, Sherlock, before he does something stupid. We both know trying to hurt me now will only reflect poorly on
John inhaled sharply, and it took all of his control to keep his hands from wrapping around Sherlock’s neck and pulling him closer. Instead, he forced himself to pull away and stared up at Sherlock. “See? It’s all fine. You should trust me.”
John wanted nothing more than to punch the last fragment of life out of Jim, but he forced himself to stand up, wincing and clutching his stomach. “I’m sorry you’re bored, boss, but these stints always end. Something new always turns up.”
Mrs. Hudson’s flat. The place was entirely unrecognizable, however. Gone were the settees and the knit kettle cozies, replaced with dark wooden furniture, kerosene lamps, Persian rugs, and patterned wallpaper.
“It’s a bit like blogging, talking to him,” John said. Doyle had written up about ten of Sherlock’s cases so far. John had read them over, and even though the author had changed a great number of details, he found them very entertaining. It was fun reading about Sherlock in a story as if he was some sort of hero. Doyle had recently been talking about trying to publish in the Strand.
idiots, yes! I get it, okay! You’re a freakish genius, we’re not. You don’t have to say so every five seconds.”
John was about to answer when there was a loud clatter from the kitchen, making both John and Jim jump and turn their heads toward the drawing room door.
to come! If you don’t like the way I work, then you are more than welcome to leave.” He stood back up and circled around the other body.
Sherlock stalked into the room, slamming the door. He was fuming as he looked at John. “If you’d like your eccentric flatmate to move out so the happy couple can continue in peace, let me know,” he said, his voice venomous.
Two dads. And the Doctor’s involvement yet again. It was impossible that this boy was their son, of course, John thought. Hamish was right, biology didn’t work that way. Still, Hamish’s unruly mop of dark hair, his narrow blue eyes, and his whole demeanor were so like Sherlock that John couldn’t ignore the resemblance. His heart pounded as he watched Hamish scratch behind his ear, something he’d seen Harry do a thousand times when she was uncomfortable. It simply wasn’t possible. He had to be imagining things.
“Impossible to say, John,” Sherlock said, never faltering from his music. “But with all that’s happened in the past few months, I think it would be very unwise to rule it out as a possibility.”
He still had people to tell about the aneurysm. After bidding Molly goodbye the next morning, Sherlock traveled to Scotland Yard and informed Lestrade of his “illness.” Lestrade took it with genuine concern and confusion, and Sherlock had told him not to bother telling the other members of the Yard. He was hardly their concern.
was not going to be taken in by this monster. “What happens if I kill you right now? No mobile phones or computer codes to signal your lackeys.”
Hamish pursed his mouth like John and furrowed his eyebrows like Sherlock. “I can’t tell,” he finally admitted after scanning the man again.
When Sherlock finally came, John pulled away and finished himself, gasping into Sherlock’s hip, then drew himself up to Sherlock’s mouth and kissed him. “Apology accepted?”
want to please you. However much I hate my situation, I’ve accepted that it’s not going to change. If I can do good work for you and keep you happy, then we’ll both benefit, I figure. And I’m also… I’m lonely.” The last part wasn't a lie at all, John realized.
John pursed his lips, considering this. He tapped his fingers on his chair. “D’you fancy a pint?” He offered. “Regardless of how you feel about alcohol, I desperately need a drink.”
Jim stood and began buttoning up his shirt. John didn’t think he was going to answer, but when he reached the last button he said, staring straight ahead, “Because my father was ‘sir,’ and I—“ Jim’s eyes flashed dangerously as they met John’s. “—am NOT that low-life, drunken, belligerent scum bag.”
As John moved, the uncomfortable stretching began to subside, and it was all pleasure as John hit Sherlock’s prostate once more. He moaned and began bucking his hips up to meet John until it was pure pleasure, and John complied to his thrusts by moving faster. John shuddered above him, digging his hands more tightly into Sherlock’s skin.
He felt Jim climb to his knees behind him and grab John’s hips. “Well, this certainly was a surprise, Johnny-Boy.” Without warning he pushed himself in. John was unable to hold back a shout of pain. It had been months since he’d last had sex, and it hurt even more than he’d anticipated. He clenched his eyes shut and dug his hands into the sheets.
Sherlock’s mouth dropped open at the sight of the violin case, lost for words, then sprung from his chair, accepting the case from John. He set the case on his chair to carefully open it. It was a beautiful instrument. Sherlock ran his fingers along the taut strings and the varnished wood before gently picking it up. “John…how did you…?”
Sherlock shuddered, clenching his teeth, trying not to cry out, both in pleasure and anticipation. John took him in his mouth, slowly at first, gripping Sherlock’s hips with his hands and stroking the hollow place above his hipbones with his thumbs as he pulled in deeper, sucking and increasing the pressure of his lips.
Meanwhile, Sherlock was perched on the bench next to Hamish, his elbows propped on his knees, steepled fingers against his lips. He glanced over at Hamish, who had taken up the same pose. “Why do you do that?” Sherlock asked curiously.
Sherlock gave a long sigh, lacing his fingers, and staring out the window. “It’s a relief, in a way. Knowing that we have to go. We don’t have to run anymore. We just need to stay together.”
“Did you see how he narrows his eyes at people, and those little half-smile smirks he does? And the eyebrow raises? You all over,” John said on the cab ride over.
