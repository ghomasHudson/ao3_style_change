“They’d find us,” Sherlock whispered, letting the wind carry his voice to John’s ears. “And you’ve got Harry and your parents to worry about. And I’ve got Mycroft,” he said, louder.
Sherlock’s brother was the last to die, and here Hannibal was, giving Sherlock the most discreet “shame on you” for burying his brother like everyone else in the entire world would. But what did he expect Sherlock to do – stop right there in the hallway and –
But the woman fell to the ground, and Sherlock spun around to find Harry Watson, staring at him, wide-eyed and morphing – morphing into something weird – something red and monstrous – a fire – a fire that could completely swallow him whole –
“Of course, Mr. Holmes; my apologies,” he replied, though he smiled as he spoke, obviously excited over the fact that
And before Sherlock could get another word in, Mycroft reached up, grabbed Sherlock, and brought his sobbing little brother into his arms.
And then the movement of the line caught up with them – the horses stepped forward, pulling the chariot behind them, and pulled Sherlock away from John.
“Yes, it’s exactly what it looks like. We thought we had time; we obviously didn’t. Won’t happen again,” he lied, keeping direct eye contact.
Suddenly, Sherlock felt like he was in school again, being called upon by a teacher who knew he hadn’t been paying attention.
“Sometimes I wondered if I had missed you, but now I know that I didn’t –” she went on, but Sherlock spoke, the words jumping out of his mouth.
“Ground yourself, John. You’re okay,” he said, holding John’s shaking hands in his, even as John shook his head. “Yes, you are. Come on, ground yourself.”
John’s hands were sweating as he watched Sherlock quickly climb up the nearest tree and make his way to Robert Frankland as quietly as possible, crossing the distance between trees using their branches. He could do it – Sherlock had the ability to climb the trees beyond the fence in District 12 with agility and grace, and there were too many times throughout their friendship where Sherlock had appeared at John’s side out of nowhere, without a sound, not to mention the fact that Robert was turned away from Sherlock and had about six thousand tracker jackers buzzing in his ears. But it wasn’t Sherlock’s sneaking technique that was the problem – it was the time limit.
So she got on her knees beside him, put her hands – her hands, which at the moment were missing their fingernails and had swelled to the size and color of tomatoes, although Harry had to assume that it was just a hallucination – onto his chest, and started pressing, trying to restart his heart – tears racing down her cheeks, one after another, screaming until her voice was hoarse and then some.
And John had nothing to say – nothing that could comfort him, nothing that could ever bring peace to his boyfriend’s heart.
He had been instructing Sherlock to do this every day for about three years, ever since he had been woken up by Sherlock screaming in the night shortly after Hannibal moved in with him.
Hannibal took the clock from Sherlock and assessed it, and Sherlock watched as his smile from just a moment ago grew into a grin that spread across his face.
Sherlock’s days of watching people die were over. Now that he knew his family was safe – and would forever be safe – he could really, truly live. And for the first time in a while, for the first time since he and John were kids, Sherlock Holmes felt absolutely brilliant.
And here they were now, nine years later, kissing together and crying together and watching each other go off to war.
Letting go of John’s hand, Sherlock stepped forward, placing his hand on the banister, putting his foot on the first step –
“The feeling’s mutual,” he agreed. “It’s taking just about everything I have just to stay here in this room, but the paperwork helps the time go by. I’m thinking of going to see if I can sneak in and see them in the morning.”
“Kitty Riley, that bitch!” Harry exclaimed, reading the article and the name of its author from over John’s shoulder. “‘An anonymous source’ – bullshit!
I really like playing with actor allusions in this fic, such as the fact that Charles Augustus Magnussen and Hannibal Lecter Magnussen are brothers because the actors for Charles Augustus Magnussen in Sherlock and Hannibal Lecter in Hannibal are brothers. Some more actor allusions:
John wanted to think that he wouldn’t – that he would somehow know that Snow was up to something, but he knew that Mycroft was right.
was first published, though, Sherlock was right there alongside the rest of Panem, devouring each and every word. He loved it, however, there were corrections that Sherlock felt needed to be made, and, instead of bothering John about it, Sherlock marked it up with commentary and alterations, writing notes in the margins and crossing out lines as he saw fit. But then Sherlock found that, when Sherlock’s thoughts and memories were too much for him to handle, it helped to see himself through John’s eyes – through the eyes of someone who loved him unconditionally. He kept an unmarked copy of John’s book, so that he could read John’s opinions of him unobstructed by Sherlock’s thoughts of himself. This was why Sherlock requested and received two copies of
This Unavoidable Thing Between Us - Evermore (for Sherlock and John's relationship after John's assault)
“Yeah, but this is different – everyone was watching the Games, then. Now there’s no new footage to watch – now they’re just waiting.”
“Harry, no human action is ever truly random,” Sherlock said, sounding more like himself than he had in days.
Before any of them could get another word out, a red light shone above the double doors they were to exit through – the tributes were to get to their chariots and in line – immediately. The horse trainers quickly started getting the horses into line – Charles Augustus Magnussen and Helen Hewlett up in front, and Sherlock Holmes and Harry Watson in the back. Sherlock, Harry, and John walked alongside District 12’s chariot as the horse trainers led the horses into line, politely staying out of the way.
As they opened the doors, John could see everyone start to look around them, as if to find Sherlock and John in the seats next to them – except for Clover Frankland, who was watching Pollux in the seat in front of her sign what Dean was saying for her. John could even see Dean look to Harry, who John could easily pick out thanks to her red hair, and watched as she stood up to reply.
Sherlock gave John complete privacy as he showered and got dressed, and John was simultaneously grateful for and saddened by that fact. Just by the way Sherlock was acting, the way he was so careful with John, even though John didn’t think he could possibly be more careful with him, John knew that Sherlock was keeping what happened in the stairwell in mind. They both were, and not necessarily by choice.
Before either guard could reply, Mycroft heard a voice, one that he had heard on and off through the television screen all of his life; one that he had heard that very morning in person.
He took a deep, shaky breath, thinking of his own parents, thinking of Mycroft, and finished. “You’re alive. Go spend some time with your families. Because we’re not able to.”
“John –” Harry called from beside him, and it took Sherlock a moment to realize the shooting had stopped, just as John dove in between them, throwing his gun to the floor, moving Sherlock’s hand and pressing Mycroft’s open wound for himself.
“I’m sorry – Sherlock, I’m sorry – there’s nothing I could’ve done – Sherlock you have to quiet down – they’ll hear us –”
“Yes, this is exactly what it looks like!” Sherlock called out from beside him – obviously also seeing Dean’s expression, as well. “We overslept. Sorry!”
“I’d ask how everyone is, but I feel we already know the answer to that. This is mostly for John’s benefit, but before we begin I’d like for us all to go around and introduce ourselves. I’ll start: My name is Mycroft Holmes, I’m from District Twelve, and my younger brother Sherlock will be in the Arena this year.”
“Thanks for not killing me to get me out of the Games,” she said, a sly smile on her face. “I mean, it would’ve been really counter-intuitive if you did. And with the fact that I won? Embarrassing. Absolutely insulting, actually.”
“Many victors got prostituted out to the people of the Capitol – the people who can afford them, or want them. We don’t get a choice in the matter. Mycroft didn’t get a choice in the matter, either. No one ever wants to be sold off like that, but Mycroft was the first person I had seen who just couldn’t accept it. He kept telling me that he had you to take care of – he couldn’t be in the Capitol all the time when he had you back home. And, because of you, he was able to buy himself some time.”
, instead simply waiting quietly for John to be ready. Antonia also didn't speak to John, apart for some sarcastic quips. Plus, she didn't try to
“Did I ever tell you that Mycroft threatened me after we started –” John started to say “dating,” but then he realized that the two boys had never legitimately dated, and had instead skipped straight to being in a serious, committed relationship. “– this?” John asked, gesturing to the two of them.
Sherlock screamed his brother’s name, latching on to him, trying to shake him awake, tears pouring down his face, his entire being desperate –
“Yeah – the venom finally left my system at some point last night,” Harry replied. “You were stung a lot more than I was so I figured that was why you slept for so long...”
He looked over at Sherlock to find him watching his shoes as they walked, obviously embarrassed, his now-empty hand twitching with the desire to hold John’s hand. John reached out and took it, and squeezed it reassuringly.
But that was just John’s thinking; the Gamemakers probably didn’t know the depth of his repulsive nature.
“I love you – I never said it enough but I do – I’ve always loved you – since the beginning – I fell in love with you within five minutes of meeting you –”
“Yes, but I can tell you right now that you won’t,” Mycroft said, dumping it out in a nearby trash can and turning back to Dean, placing his free hand on Dean’s shoulder. “I am truly sorry about Steven, and I promise that you will get time to mourn, but I’m asking you. Not now. Not like this,” he said with finality, holding up the empty cup between them.
The entire time they were watching the Hunger Games play out before them, Sherlock and Harry were holding each other’s hands, and Mycroft placed his hands on each of their shoulders and gave a reassuring squeeze whenever a particularly gruesome or heartbreaking part occurred on the screen. Whenever John thought of the fact that he should be there, holding their hands and putting his hands on their shoulders, able to touch them and hug them and speak directly to them, he felt a pang of jealousy.
Before John could react – or even try to figure out what the moment between them could possibly mean – Mycroft Holmes was by his side, pushing him, Sherlock, and Harry into the backstage area.
And he wanted to – fuck, he so wanted to just close his eyes and sleep – but he couldn’t, not yet – not while Magnussen was still alive –
It was then that they finally had a moment to look at the room in full. They were surrounded by tables and lockers; surgical tables with various straps attached to them and lockers that probably held implements of torture, but neither of them wanted to go find out for themselves. The only hint that they were provided about what was kept inside the lockers was the fact that there were smaller work tables on wheels, each one holding an assortment of sharp instruments, syringes, and other tools.
The stag stared at Sherlock with eyes that seemed to see inside his soul. It looked majestic and terrifying – if Sherlock was more easily startled into action he might’ve tried to attack the beast. But he hadn’t.
“Unfortunately, yes. Which is why he was so persistent for us to accept one of his beverages, and why I was so persistent that we refused. You’re lucky that you’re still alive; no offense meant, but if he had offered you something without me there to interfere I’m sure you would have taken it.”
“Everyone has secrets, John, and I can find out what they are with a single glance; I’m sure you can connect the dots for yourself.”
Within a single second, Sherlock was covered in Archie’s blood, and the boy’s body fell to the ground between him and the killer – a man just a touch older than Mycroft in a brown swimsuit. Their eyes met, and before Sherlock had actually thought out a plan of attack he was running straight for the tribute and plunging his sword into his stomach before he had time to react and kill Sherlock too.
Sherlock and John spent the next three months together, whether cuddling in bed all day, or venturing beyond the fence for as long as they could, or hanging out with Harry and Mycroft. The only time they were apart was when Sherlock was at school, and John was with the Monroe’s. Sherlock taught John to be a damn good dancer, and John’s nightmares became fewer and farther between. They even planned their escape for the coast – they would leave during the spring, after John’s nineteenth birthday, once the snow was completely melted, and the Capitol wouldn’t notice John was missing until it was too late. They had everything planned – they had even planned to write notes to give to Mr. and Mrs. Watson, Harry, and Mycroft, explaining what they were going to do, where they were going, and promising they’d come back for them as soon as they could.
have to do it. Though, in hindsight, he really didn’t have to,” he chuckled quietly, to himself, and then, finally, he looked up at Sherlock, as if he had just remembered that he was there. “His plans worked. If they weren’t turned off by his weight, they were scared off by his deductions. Whatever we did, it didn’t matter. Sometimes it didn’t even feel like it happened at all.”
was his last chance. If, within those five minutes, Sherlock had finally agreed to his offer – if he had agreed to be his friend, to be his protégé – Hannibal would’ve called the meeting off. He would’ve fled the Capitol – he might’ve even taken Sherlock with him, if he could have managed it.
Seeing the Morphling there, free for him to use, was like what he imagined seeing an ex-lover would be like; one that he no longer knew, or shared anything in common with, anymore, but he still kept coming back to, anyway.
“There’s no need to criticize yourself, John. You were drugged and without your prosthetic, it’s completely understandable –”
“Oh, I know,” Sherlock said, turning his head to look back at Magnussen, and in one second, within just a single glance, he was able to map out exactly where all of his vital organs were. “I know.” He straightened up, letting go of Harry, putting himself between them – in a turn of events, protecting him from her. “I can’t believe I didn’t see –”
“You’re still up?” Mycroft asked, just as Harry passed over the border into the next sector. John looked up at him.
“Put your hands up!” they ordered, and they both obeyed, Mycroft pulling his hand away from his wound and stepping forward.
After Sherlock and Mr. Watson woke up and the family got dressed and ready, they met up with Mycroft and made their way to the center of town.
Obviously sensing that they didn’t have much time before they ran into other people, Mycroft spoke quickly from behind him.
“Aw, don’t be that way, Mycroft!” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed, entering the car (and the conversation) and sitting down. “We’ve won the Hunger Games; we’re on the Victory Tour! We’re supposed to be happy –
Were any of you looking for another reason to reread Sentiment? Are you looking for a reason to read Sentiment for the very first time?
The day the three had decided to move themselves from District 12 to District 9 fell upon a Thursday, and so the original plan was for John to leave for his support group meeting that night and Sherlock and Harry leave for District 6 Friday morning as they usually would. The only difference would be afterwards, where, instead of all of them going back to District 12, they would instead go to District 9.
“I might’ve sprained his arm,” John said in lieu of a confirmation, but, in a way, it was exactly the confirmation Sherlock needed.
“I had to,” John replied. “You’ll see when you’re up there – you can’t control a thing you say when you’re up there.” He sighed, looking back up at his sister. “And now I don’t even know what to ask her – I mean, what the hell am I
“William Holmes is at the edge of his life, teetering back and forth on the balls of his feet. Your sister merely put off his fall; the slightest breeze in the wrong direction will send him toppling over the edge.”
“Yes, thank you, Mr. Magnussen,” Dean called up to him, and when John looked behind him, Hannibal was finally making his exit.
“We’re going to give all of them justice today,” Sherlock said, kneeling down at Magnussen’s crotch. “Every single one.”
“Wait – Mycroft –” Sherlock called, and his brother turned and peeked his head back through the door.
“He won’t – at least, he won’t if he wants to win. If he goes after you first there’s a chance that I’ll swoop in and save you – if he kills me first it’ll make you an easy target – not because I don’t think you’re able to kick his ass but considering that you’re inhaling the fear gas and fighting him while you’re reacting to my death you’d be off your game. Now, if you see anything, don’t attack it – it could very easily be me or a Ravenstag and you won’t even know. If it’s not real, it can’t touch you, just remember that. But if something happens – if something goes wrong – if he finds you before I can find him, just scream – call my name, and I’ll come back.”
The Avoxes all glanced at one another, silently deciding among themselves who would be the one to help him. For a moment, it looked like no one would.
And John learned this too, in time, with the help of his sister and his boyfriend. But John also began to take over the role that Mycroft and their parents had previously served, in the past: he became something of their guardian, making sure that Sherlock ate at least one meal a day and slept at least two hours a night, and making sure that Harry went to school each day, keeping in contact with her teachers to see how she was doing. He found that taking care of Sherlock and Harry kept his mind off of the Games and the assault, which is what he needed.
Sherlock and Harry exchanged looks from across the table, and while Mrs. Hudson went on, Sherlock blocked her out, and his eyes slowly wandered to the hallway, where he knew John’s bedroom was, the last room on the left. He knew that somewhere,
Sherlock thought, but pursed his lips as he swallowed the words down, trying to find something different to say – something more appropriate.
But he was there, in the room with them – not legitimately, not in person, not in the way that mattered – but he was there. His room smelled of him – like fancy capitol cologne and sugar and paper – and his memory was everywhere and every surface of the room was physically covered in him –
“Well, here we are. Do you have any questions before you go in?” the guard asked as he took out a ring of keys and began to unlock the door. Sherlock shook his head. “In that case, I will be right outside,” the guard said, opening the door and letting Sherlock inside.
“That’s quite alright, boys,” he replied. “If you change your minds, just let me know.” He then interlaced his fingers on the table. “Now, I’m sure you’re wondering why I’ve called you here, today. Or, you know exactly why you’re here,” he added, meeting Mycroft’s eyes.
He continued speaking – each word fighting its way past his lips, the serum refusing to let him stop for a breath – to calm himself down.
“Thank you,” he said into the microphone, the last of his tears falling down his face, and he left the stage.
John did not know what helped him, whether it was the snowball fight Sherlock had initiated the night before, or fact that he knew Greg Lestrade never planned to win the Hunger Games, or some combination of the two, but somehow it was easier for him to get through Greg’s speech in District 6:
to do – he had to break John’s heart – he had to break Mycroft’s heart – he had to make him the last member of the Holmes family – he had to –
“Is John still asleep?” she asked, and Sherlock nodded in reply. “Okay, well, unfortunately he needs to get up. Dean just came by – he’s calling a meeting at twelve-thirty – that’s in almost half an hour –”
With Sherlock and Harry effectively out of commission (since they were both fighting off the effects of the tracker jackers – Harry while awake and Sherlock while asleep), the cameras decided to focus on the three other groups of tributes in the Arena.
Once he was sure there was no way for her to escape, no matter how much she struggled, Magnussen ripped the curved knife from Aurora’s trembling hands, and bent down over her ear.
They soon found themselves approaching a section of hallway, just before a three-way fork, that was littered with the bodies of three Peacekeepers, their blood splattered around them, either dying or already dead.
John glanced at him. They were in identical suits, but their colors were switched between the two, like how it was when they reunited in the Capitol. They looked like they were meant to be, standing next to each other; like two pieces of a puzzle. If they were to part at any time, their suits would seem weird and pointless.
“Yes, yes of course –” he stammered, and John nodded. He turned around, about to bid the man a good day and leave the house, but then he paused for a second as a thought occurred to him.
And Sherlock knew exactly what that felt like. In fact, for a moment, he was brought back to that time – where, for almost eight years straight, Sherlock woke up every day and knew that his love for his best friend was unrequited, and would always be unrequited, because John would never be attracted to Sherlock. But Sherlock had been able to finally tell John – Dean would never be able to say the words.
“Besides,” John could hear Hannibal call behind him as he made his way out to the lobby. “It’s only cannibalism if we’re equals.”
have to be punished for it?” Harry asked, outraged for a moment before her expression softened. “I mean, it’s not like I’m not happy to see you, Mycroft, but...John’s my brother, you know?”
So, this the last of the deleted scenes for Constantly! And, until I get more stuff written, that's the end of the bonus features.
Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment, wishing with all of his might that the gas would not find his lungs. He was Sherlock Holmes, he didn’t know fear – until now, of course. It was impossible not to feel fear when in the Hunger Games arena, but inhaling the gas would only throw him off the edge – send him into a blinding panic that he had never experienced before. That couldn’t happen – not here – not now – not ever.
The Victory Tour makes stops in Districts 10 and 9; John meets the victor of the 73rd Hunger Games; John makes a decision that no victor has ever made before.
Mrs. Hudson cried, approaching Harry and kissing both of her cheeks. She looked at John’s mom. “Surely, that can’t be what you’ve named her?”
“Gladly,” Sherlock said, and, as the sun began to set over the Arena, the two District 12 tributes walked through the maze, side by side.
Hurt? He felt numb – he felt like his brain was floating just above him, attached to a string tied like a noose around his neck, but was he hurt? He tried to think about it – tried to feel –
So, despite John’s desire to spend the day at least twelve floors above the City Circle at all times, he got dressed and made the descent with Mycroft down to the Circle, where all of Mycroft's friends were waiting.
Out of habit, he took John’s hand and squeezed it, and John squeezed his hand back, and Sherlock wished desperately that the next few days would pass quickly.
“I was just – well, Sherlock and I were –” he started, his heart giving a faint twinge of pain as his boyfriend’s name passed through his lips. “Before all of this happened, we were talking about the ocean, and I was thinking just now... District Four provides fish for all of Panem, so...have you ever seen the ocean? Or has anyone from Four seen it?” John finally asked. “Because I’ve seen lobsters served at Capitol banquets and I know for a fact that they only live in saltwater areas –”
“I remember watching you at home, too – I was twelve then – my parents refused to let me watch that bit once you decided what to do, but the kids at school – I mean, the ones who
“It has names on it. A lot of names,” John said, reaching down to hold Hamish’s hand. Hamish grabbed on, and Sherlock stood up to his full height and held onto Hamish’s other hand, and slowly they began to walk closer to the Memorial.
“What do you think happens to the bad victors?” Sherlock asked quietly, looking straight ahead. “The ones who know the Capitol is bullshit and won’t let it control them?” he whispered as if someone was listening in on them.
“We should get to the roof; we’ll be joining the stylists and preparation teams on their hovercraft, which will be taking off any minute.”
“We have to go to the where the interviews are held to meet with Seneca Crane – it’s a mentor meeting.”
“That’s right, you just stay with me, Sherlock – don’t die on me, now. You’re not allowed to – you’re my man with a plan, remember?” she said, nearly laughing as she spoke, seeing where his plans had put them.
“You act like I don’t know exactly how far you’d go to see your partner,” Mycroft replied, and then addressed the both of them. “Since the Avoxes will be here any minute, I should escort Sherlock back to his room, but I wanted to be the first to say to you how proud I am of both of you for surviving the Hunger Games. No one ever thought there would be two winners, but you proved everyone wrong, and for that I am extremely glad.”
“Definitely,” Sherlock whispered back. “We’ve got to figure out what to do about him.” He looked at her. “Do you remember what he said to me the night of the interviews?” he asked.
If Sherlock hadn’t noticed the string, he would’ve been within the net’s contents. Which wouldn’t be too concerning, considering he had a very sharp sword, but looking at the ropes that the net was made out of, he could tell that the material was so strong that his sword wouldn’t be able to free him. If he was to be caught up there, he’d be forced to either starve to death, or anxiously wait for another tribute to come to finish him off.
Archie was watching Sherlock, anxiously waiting for him to make the next move. Sherlock’s next move, though, was simple: smile.
Arena – and balanced the tip of the curved blade on her knee, resting the palm of her hand on the end of the handle to keep it upright.
“No – no – Mycroft did,” John said, sitting up as well, and John could hear Sherlock’s breathing grow shaky as he spoke.
He must’ve paled or shown some sign of distress, for Alexander furrowed his brows together and tilted his head to the side.
“Don’t talk to her like that; she’s as old as you are,” he said, and turned to Lavinia. “The truth is you’re not needed here, anymore. You were never needed here. The point of the Avoxes was just to keep everyone from rebelling against the Capitol. They never
“It’s funny – there was once a time where you’d use everyone’s sympathy to get free food,” John mused, chuckling a little bit.
Although he had no memory of getting up, Sherlock eventually found himself in the bathroom of the room, his box of Morphling on the sink’s countertop, and the bathtub’s faucet running, filling up the tub.
“If you ever need to speak with me, feel free to seek me out. I could help you, if you ask me to,” Hannibal offered, speaking as if he had never touched Sherlock’s dog tags.
victors.” There was a moment of silence, and then she checked her pocket watch. “Oh! We should get ready for the recap with Caesar! We can’t spend
He hovered outside the room for a moment, with Dean Bainbridge standing just behind him, his feet glued to the spot. Part of him felt like, probably for the first time ever, that he was encroaching in a private space – his brother’s private space – but another part of him wished for another hit of morphling.
Sherlock, Harry, and Archie Neal try to survive through the Bloodbath; Mycroft, John, and Louise Neal watch and react.
need tonight. As soon as possible, actually,” he said, and asked the question: “Can you get me Morphling? And just put it on my bed in the penthouse?”
“If…if I ever say too much, again…or if you ever think I’m becoming a bit...full of myself, cocky or…or over-confident…”
It took a moment for John to realize he had spoken at all – maybe if he hadn’t seen the shocked and confused faces in the crowd, he wouldn’t have even noticed. There was no way to undo what he did, so he dug his hole deeper; repeating it louder, speaking directly to Mr. Trevor:
“Sherlock Holmes!” John shouted, and instantly regretted it; Sherlock dropped his arms, looking like he was about to cry. But he pressed on. “Drop. It.”
Sherlock could tell that John could just barely contain his anger while Dean was in the room, but once John shut the door on Dean, John was fuming.
“Looking for inconsistencies?” John asked, nodding to the manifesto once Sherlock looked up. “There are a lot of inconsistencies.”
“I’m starting to get the idea that he doesn’t quite understand what’s going on. He keeps talking about going home.”
And of course, once Dean's night is through (and it's a long-ass night for newly-interim President Dean Bainbridge), he finally allows himself to weep, not only for Mycroft, but also for the District 4 victors that also lost their lives (but mostly Mycroft).
“Ah,” she said, nodding. “Probably just checking in. He was Mycroft’s best friend, after all – it’s kind of in the unofficial rules of being best friends that you have to look after their siblings if they can’t.”
thought about it – he had seen a bunch of traps like this before, too. These traps had been in the twenty-sixth Hunger Games –
It matched, alright. Two things were obvious – the first being everyone had matching jumpsuits, with one difference: where there was wasn’t black, there was a color reserved for each player. The second obvious thing was the fact that it was a jumpsuit – waterproof, skin tight – water was going to be unavoidable in this Arena. And if Sherlock hadn’t figured it out by the time he saw them, the goggles would have helped him in his deduction immensely.
He hadn’t thought to at the time – he wasn’t thinking about it at all as he had approached the group of Avoxes in the audience’s pit of Caesar’s studio. When he had approached them, he only had one thing on his mind.
is winning!” Caesar exclaimed, and John looked away as the cameras gave the audience the gruesome details.
“Mycroft Holmes!” Dean Bainbridge exclaimed, and John only glanced away for a moment to see Dean clapping Mycroft on the back.
“I’m going to be late,” he muttered, looking back at John, and he could see the disappointment in his husband’s eyes. “I won’t take long, I promise – Dean probably just wants to go over his address for tonight with me.”
John knew about that game – the boys at school used to play it when they were younger. John had even played once; he didn’t blink when the punch was thrown. But that’s all it was – false punches with nothing behind it. They were never deadly.
Sherlock forced himself to nod, glancing around, away from John’s eyes, as he remembered how to speak.
And then, just like that, reality crashed upon John. Panem was a prison, and every single person who lived there was held hostage, unable to leave or to see the true light of day. And he had a meeting first thing in the morning with their captor.
It was times like these where Sherlock was reminded of the final article that Kitty Riley had ever written – an article that Sherlock had refused to read at first, until years later, when he finally felt as if whatever she had to say could not hurt him:
friend. It was as if, all of Sherlock’s life, he hadn’t fully realized that Mycroft Holmes was just as much of a person as he himself was – he didn’t live just to be Sherlock’s older brother and protect him from the world, after all. He had likes and dislikes and friends and best friends and hobbies and a
“It was supposed to be an article about the memorial, but someone on the press team traded the approved article with this…” Dean said uselessly as John snatched the paper out of Alexander’s hands to read it for himself:
With great flourish, knowing that Sherlock and Harry’s entire lives were dependent on the contents of the envelope, Caesar opened the envelope, pulled out the card inside, and read it out loud, his voice booming in the now otherwise-silent room:
“Well, you could – you're going into the Arena with him tomorrow –” John said, but Helen shook her head.
“You’ve got to let the lovers have their alone time, Mycroft,” Mrs. Hudson said, and Sherlock rolled his eyes. Sherlock had no idea what was keeping him from telling her off, but he did look at Mycroft to see him bent over his food, smirking to himself.
Benjamin Coleman – Harry’s ex-girlfriend’s older brother – had been in John’s class when they were all in school, and Sherlock had had the misfortune of meeting the brute on a few occasions, but the most recent altercation was when John was in the Hunger Games Arena last year. It was shortly after Clara (the ex-girlfriend in question) and Harry had broken up, and Benjamin had decided to say unkind things about Harry’s sexuality and her relationship with his sister, but when he decided to add insult to injury and mention John’s potential death in the Arena, she had decided to attack him for what he had said. Sherlock had also gotten a black eye from the encounter.
They laid in silence for a few moments, both thinking about those consequences, getting lost in each of their heads, until John spoke again:
“Well, it’s been ten years, hasn’t it?” John asked, a bit awkwardly, and Sherlock fought the urge to correct him.
The Setting Sun by Switchfoot (another good credit song for Constantly, if it ended showing still frames of everyone smiling with subtitles like "Antonia Blake moved out of District 2, got married to a loving wife, and named her daughter after Aurora" and "Caesar Flickerman passed away in prison, after serving only half of his sentence," etc.)
that it was them – but John had skipped over everything – skipped right to acceptance, because, in the past year alone, he had come to expect such cruelty from Coriolanus Snow.
“Ah,” she said, nodding. “Probably just checking in. He was Mycroft’s best friend, after all – it’s kind of in the unofficial rules of being best friends that you have to look after their siblings if they can’t.”
,” John said quietly, just like he would’ve to any of said fathers, and Mycroft nodded, a small, satisfied smile on his face.
“You know Dr. Monroe?” Harry asked, randomly, and Sherlock looked over at her as a memory flooded his mind – a certain memory he hadn’t thought about in years:
rights to you. I can so easily make it look like you went into hiding after the deaths of your sister and boyfriend, you know, and only we’ll know the truth.” He watched John, gauging a reaction, and chuckled. “I must say, I just
, indeed. But, in the end, it’s your decision, isn’t it?” He then looked up at John, a smile in his eyes.
“There was something that happened today that I wanted to tell you guys about – something about Sherlock –” Harry began, but Mycroft cut her off.
Because every question they had at that moment would undoubtedly be answered as soon as Hannibal reached the podium.
trust you, Sherlock. But you were just a kid when he started talking about a rebellion, and as you got older he wanted to protect you more – he wanted to rebel
Sherlock knew where they would be when they woke up the next day: District 6, home of two things Sherlock and John both dreaded. For John, he would have to face Greg Lestrade’s broken family; for Sherlock, he would have to see the four surviving victors from the District – which everyone knew were victims of the Morphling addictions they started once they won – he had to look into the face of what he was so close to becoming, if it wasn’t for John. John sat at the window, watching the snow fall outside, and Sherlock knew John was thinking of tomorrow – of Greg. John had really opened himself up and let two people in while he was in the Capitol and the Arena, and those two people were Victor Trevor and Greg Lestrade. Sherlock didn’t blame him; Victor brightened everything he touched, and Greg had reached out to John when no one else would.
He didn’t mind continuing to act as if nothing had changed, as long as it kept John Watson in his life.
Finally, Sherlock walked up the front steps of his own house, put his key into the door’s lock, and opened the door, stepping inside the house.
“Well, no offense meant, but...you’re a woman. Women don’t normally win these kinds of things; I’m sure you understand. Although, this could be an equal fight, seeing as the Sholto family has a history of losing these sort of things.”
Happy New Year! 2018's been a rough one, kids - lots of ups and downs (mostly downs), and I for one have made a lot of mistakes. Here's to hoping 2019 is better than this year was, and that I make some better choices that can lead to be Better Me. And here's to hoping that all of us will see the end of this fic - I'm about three chapters (give or take) from the end, but there's another 30+ chapters for me to post, so don't fuss too much.
“I’m so sorry, Antonia,” Mycroft said, and she shrugged in a way that told John she was merely pretending to be indifferent, and then looked past the empty chair beside her and at the man who was about her age in the seat after that.
At about three in the morning, John gave up on tossing and turning and decided to go out onto the roof and watch the post-Games celebration from above, but when he passed Mycroft’s office he noticed that Mycroft was also awake, sitting at his desk, filling out paperwork.
But the more I thought about it, the more I thought about the universe, the universe where John was in the Hunger Games for District 12 and Sherlock was stuck watching him from home, the more I couldn’t leave it alone. The story fleshed out, characters were made, and then, I decided: I was going to write this.
“For those of you who don’t know, both of our parents died when we were young; our father when I was four and Mycroft was eleven, and our mother when I was nine and Mycroft was sixteen. So, really, I haven’t known a life where Mycroft hasn’t stood in for at least one of my parents. For a long time, Mycroft was everything to me: a brother, a father, a mother, a mentor, a moral compass, a protector, a best friend. He was everything I had, and even when I met John and Harry Watson – made my own friends, who became different things for me within themselves, and also some of the same things – Mycroft stepped aside for them. He made room for them in my heart, in his heart, and in our lives.
“No pens, no pencils. Do not accept anything he offers you. Do not let him touch you. Do not touch him –”
He found Harry, dressed in red, just a few spots away on his right, poised to run to the platform and into the water. She wasn’t looking at John’s knives, though – Sherlock followed her gaze and found her eyeing up a bow and arrow set in the Cornucopia –
On April first, two days after John’s birthday, one week before the date they had decided upon to leave, Harry knocked on the Holmes’ door. Sherlock and John were in Sherlock’s room, compiling a list of things to pack for their journey, and Mycroft, who was in the kitchen, opened the door.
“Thank you all, for being here, and for listening. And…” he looked down at the open casket. “Goodbye, Brother Mine. I already miss you more than I ever thought possible.”
This was the first time Sherlock was anywhere near a sibling of someone that he had personally killed in the Arena.
I started slurring my speech. So we went to the local emergency room (yay more money spent that we don't have) and after having a CAT scan and talking to a neurologist and vomiting again they weren't sure if either I was having a migraine or being like the first 23 year old in existence to have a stroke (idk if that's true but they were acting like it) so then around 10:00 pm I was sent to UMass for a second CAT scan and more talks with a neurologist and they finally decided that it was just a migraine and I could go home around 8:00 am. I tried writing about this in detail but it literally took up four pages so here are some highlights:
Sherlock, per usual, had been right in his deduction that the meeting Dean was calling was going to be broadcasted. It was obvious from the moment he, Sherlock, and Harry walked into the auditorium that used to be entirely Caesar Flickerman’s, for he could see Dean talking to a man with a camera, who John recognized as a victor from District Three.
“Then what do we do?” Sherlock hissed. “Maybe we could –” he started, but Mycroft interrupted him, shaking his head, avoiding his eyes.
“I’m not concerned about the food,” Mycroft lied. “I’m just trying to keep us on Mrs. Hudson’s schedule –”
“I made fun of him for all those years –” Sherlock breathed, cutting himself off when his voice cracked.
The weekend before Sherlock’s twelfth birthday was a time that stuck out to Sherlock, like an exposed nail in his mind palace, and today, ever since Dean told him of what Mycroft had done to protect Sherlock, and what Mycroft had left Sherlock alone that weekend to do, it felt like Sherlock had removed his shoes and socks and had promptly stomped on the nail as hard as he could, shifting his weight whenever the pain seemed to dull itself. Because, after Mycroft had made a deal with President Snow to exchange his life and his body for just a couple of years’ worth of protection and the closest thing he could get to normalcy for Sherlock, and while Mycroft was in District 4, losing his virginity to Dean Bainbridge, to learn what to expect when he finally did give his body to the Capitol, Sherlock had found Mycroft’s stash of Morphling.
Originally, there was going to a plot point during chapter 12 (Power, or: the one where Mycroft recruits the Careers), where Mycroft tried to recruit Orion Wright, instead of just writing him off like he does in the actual chapter (Orion was cut for time), but I did write a little bit of their exchange:
“Myc?” Sherlock repeated, looking away from the father and son to meet Lindsay’s eyes. “With a ‘y’?”
“Been there, done that,” John said. “Trust me, this is nothing.” He then thought of everyone else – watching them. “Do you think
How had he not known this before? Maybe it was because all the times he had been up on stage he had Caesar Flickerman to lead the conversation. But Caesar Flickerman was against the rebellion – had ordered the Peacekeepers to capture the four of them – to apprehend Sherlock, John, Mycroft, and Harry. Maybe it was because he was always focused on the person who had been on stage with him – whether it had been John, Mycroft, or Harry – he had never been on the stage alone, not even alone with Caesar Flickerman. But he was alone this time, with no one to focus his attention on, to protect them and make sure they were alright. Maybe it was because all the times before the audience was made up of citizens of the Capitol – people who considered him less than human, and so he thought of them the same way. But everyone
lover. You never know what someone might do in the face of such a loss,” Hannibal said, and then turned on his heel and vanished into the crowd.
“He taught himself to play,” Dean replied as Sherlock looked back down at the violin – at his gift. “You can touch it; it’s yours.”
Harry then opened her mouth, and sang a few notes to the open air. In moments, Sherlock heard the call of birds, repeating her notes, listening to the rise and fall of her voice and singing it out back to her.
Harry smiled, and tapped the mouth of her bottle to Sherlock’s apple. “To a new era,” she chuckled, only partially joking.
“No; Mycroft wanted to keep you three safe above all else. In fact, he knew that Sherlock wouldn’t go anywhere if we told him Mycroft wasn’t allowed to come with him.”
After John found his way back to the sofa, the door to the penthouse opened, and Mycroft stepped out of the elevator and into the room.
“Alright,” Mycroft said, and crossed to one of the tables in the middle of the room and retrieved the Peacekeeper’s helmet, and affixed to his head, putting the tinted visor down, covering his face his completely. “How do I look?” he asked, his voice distorted by the helmet.
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry smirked, pushing Sherlock a bit – the first playful, Harry-like thing she had done since arriving in the Capitol. “I’m fine. Really. Thanks again, for getting me out of there.”
Louise rushed to Mycroft and hugged him tightly. “Congratulations,” she said, and kissed his cheek. She then released him, and turned to John.
Sherlock and John spent most of their train rides cuddling in bed, creating silly word games for themselves to pass the time. Sometimes, Mycroft would interrupt, which would lead to them pushing each other across the bed as if them touching each other so intimately was a secret and not something the entire country expected of them, but Sherlock’s brother was always welcome despite that. Together, the three of them spoke as if they were not on the train – as if the horrors that had happened to John and Mycroft in the past had never transpired.
In moments, the both of them had dissolved into quiet laughter, and Archie even started bouncing up and down where he stood.
Sherlock nodded in agreement, and Mycroft took his hand, leading him through the crowd, back to the stage –
“Myc was hungry – I was feeding him when I happened to glance out the window and saw you standing here. I knew it was you as soon as I realized where in the graveyard you were –”
“Well, I didn’t. Let’s bag him up,” the first Peacekeeper said, and Harry was glad that the man did not touch her to check her pulse, or else he would’ve felt the hammering of her heart. Honestly, she was surprised they couldn’t hear it – it seemed so loud in her own ears that she was sure that it was going to give her away.
mentors. John was trying to deduce them; trying to figure out if he was forgiven – if they were angry – if they blamed him –
But that wasn’t the reason Mycroft hadn’t introduced Sherlock to any other victor until now, and Sherlock knew it. The real reason was much deeper than that: Mycroft didn’t want to expose Sherlock to the Games more than he had to. But John was in it now, which dragged Sherlock so far in he couldn’t stay out.
This wasn’t solely his idea – Louise had done the same when she and Archie were up there, talking with Caesar.
“Off you get,” she said, and, after a quick goodbye, John went for the elevators, and Sherlock went to start his training.
“Everyone I killed was to keep Harry Watson safe, and I didn’t know any of them personally, so I don’t really feel too guilty about the people I killed.” [murmur murmur murmur] “But. I feel absolutely responsible for the death of Archibald Neal. I know I didn’t kill him, but I was watching over him at the time, and I didn’t see it coming… If Harry Watson hadn’t been in that Arena with me, I would’ve taken Archie with me to the end, and he would be in this room right now. If I had seen and was able to stop his killer, I would have done anything in my power to ensure both he and Harry could go home, even if it meant laying down my own life…” He wanted to end the sentence there, but the serum spoke for him. “…like I should have done before,” he added, quietly. He then looked back up at [asker]. “So, my answer is Archie Neal.” He then turned toward the audience, and found Archie’s sister, sitting next to Harry Watson. “Louise, I’m so sorry, again. I always will be.”
going to sleep? For me?” he asked, and Sherlock quickly nodded, looking back up at his brother – anything to get Mycroft out of his room –
“Hello, everyone, again; I thank you all for coming,” Dean Bainbridge said, two days later, standing up at the podium that he was probably starting to know very well, seeing as he had spent every day speaking from it at one point or another. But for the first time since The Battle For Panem, there were no cameras watching him, and there was no other audience other than the victors of Hunger Games’ past – he even took attendance to make sure all of those victors were there. This, John knew, was because of the day’s main event: the victor hearings, whatever that entailed.  “First of all, I would like to announce that, apart from a handful of exceptions, all of the Capitol’s falsely imprisoned people-turned-slaves that we have known as Avoxes have successfully begun their journeys back to their families.”
She wasn’t speaking to him with pity, but he could feel it coming – if she wasn’t going to start herself, then Daniel would as soon as he entered the house, and then she would mirror his tone and –
“Do you wanna get something to eat, or…– oh god,” John murmured, as he did a double take on the stage below. “Sherlock – Sherlock –” He made a move, whether it was to block Sherlock’s field of vision or to stand him up and take him out of the room, but Sherlock would never know.
– we know better than anyone how much you were hurting – but you just locked yourself away with your shit and pushed us out –
“I know I’ve said breathing’s boring but that didn’t mean I ever wanted to stop,” he said, and John was taken aback by how poetic he could be even through tears.
It was at that moment that John remembered what had been said about her, way back during the Victory Tour.
panicked, apart from one time in their childhood when Mycroft genuinely feared that Sherlock would be taken away from him, so Sherlock always attributed his ability to keep calm and think things through to his brother.
Clover signed something to him – John could only pick out the sign for “what” – and he shook his head.
Louise Neal had come up to the penthouse shortly after lunch. Mrs. Hudson had been devastated that she wasn’t Mycroft, but she complained about Sherlock and Harry’s choices in how long they slept in and what to have for a meal once they finally did wake up. Louise mostly ignored her, asking how Sherlock and Harry were between Mrs. Hudson’s rants.
John also started writing a lot – he ordered a notebook from the Capitol just so he could write – and it reminded Sherlock of all the notebooks in Mycroft’s bedroom, and of the one in the strongbox. When Sherlock asked about the notebook (twenty-four days, two hours, and nine minutes after), John introduced it as
“Yes. Apparently Moriarty and Hannibal both think that I’m just like them – or I have the potential to be.”
“You’re not my dad,” Harry muttered darkly, crossing her arms, which was the usual response she had to when John spoke to her like this. “You’re my brother.”
“Right,” John agreed, nodding. “I couldn’t – the Games were just a few days away – I didn’t want you going into the Arena worrying about me – worrying about what he’d do to me if he won.”
“Hello, Miss,” Mycroft said, but the girl did not move. “We’ve been invited to see President Snow. Are you here to take us to him?”
“So what do you propose?” Sherlock asked, and Hannibal raised his eyebrows, as if he was surprised that Sherlock had to ask the question at all.
“This way,” Mycroft muttered, just as the door burst open again, and three Peacekeepers piled through, shouting at them to stop.
“I know the rules,” Sherlock informed him, frustrated – he had helped Dean make them, for fuck’s sake – and then collected himself. “But thank you,” he added hastily, and the guard nodded.
“And before you say ‘yeah’ or ‘I’m fine’, let me just say that you don’t look okay,” she informed him before he could reply.
John stopped pacing and looked at Mycroft – the brother of his best friend – the brother of his boyfriend –
The only way Sherlock cataloged his thoughts in his head, nowadays, was by how long it had been since that night – since that hallway – since Mycroft took the bullet that was meant for Sherlock – since Mycroft’s heart stopped beating.
John only knew this because Dean had told them, during the memorial service for the fallen. John could tell he desperately wanted to read off every single name of those who had been lost, but he held it back to only the twenty-eight past Hunger Games victors, because they were the rebels and deserved to be honored by having their names read out on television one last time.
“I have been forgiving over these past few months; the moment this year’s Quell was announced I was in an anger so deep it rotted me, and I hated it. I forgave a lot of people for their part in this play. I forgave my parents for giving birth to Sherlock; they didn’t know what was to become of him. I forgave the little girl who carried the box of cards; she doesn’t understand these Games just yet. I forgave myself for winning the Games in the first place; I had no idea what I would be putting my brother through, for at the time I had just wanted to return home to protect him. I had no idea I would be damning him to this hell in the process. There are a few people who I cannot forgive, and I feel we all know who they are.”
“In some ways, sure. But that doesn’t make it right. It doesn’t make anything less ill-fated. If I lose, my brother will have no family left. I just got together with the person I’ve been head-over-heels in love with for nearly a decade, and now I may never see him again.”
Hannibal smirked, his eyes gleaming dangerously, and Sherlock knew that Hannibal had fallen for Sherlock’s trick hook, line, and sinker.
Sherlock turned around, as well, facing the neighboring houses alongside Lindsay. It had been too dark for Sherlock to see the houses when he arrived at the cemetery, but now – he couldn’t see all of them, even though he knew they were all there – he could only really see the one house that had been lit up by the candles in the windows. He instantly knew it was Lindsay’s house, but if he didn’t know he would’ve definitely realized upon seeing the open door to the house, and the man about Lindsay’s age standing on the porch, watching them.
Hi, everyone! Long time, no see! I'm just posting this to let everyone know I'm alive - it's been a rough couple of months but hopefully things will look up soon. I hope everyone's doing well, don't forget to comment!
The last, drawer, however, contained t-shirts and pairs of sweatpants, all looking expensive despite their simplicity, almost exactly like the ones Sherlock would wear as pajamas back home. He pulled out a black t-shirt and matching sweatpants, went back up to the second drawer for black underwear and socks, and went back to the bathroom, where the tub had just barely begun to overflow.
Let me know if you like getting the chapters in quick succession like this, or if you'd rather a regular schedule. Also please please please leave a comment! I love all of you ♡
After passing through about three different metal detectors, being buzzed into five different rooms, making three vague threats to expose anyone who stupidly decided to notify anyone that he was here, and seven autographs, Sherlock found himself walking alongside a guard as he spoke to him:
There was a sleeve of crackers – a source of grain and sodium; a package of beef jerky, providing protein; an empty canteen (similar to the one John had last year), a small silver medical kit –
meadow. Sherlock Holmes cried out, tears falling down his face, falling to his knees in their irises.
“Forgive me for earlier, in the elevator,” Mycroft said in a whisper once the meeting was over, as the other mentors stood up and stretched, conversed with each other, or made their way to the exit.
As they ran, Alexander unclipped a portable phone (similar to the one he had seen Claudius Templesmith with before) from his Peacekeeper uniform’s belt and started speaking into it.
“For this,” Mycroft said. “Maybe not for this moment in particular, but for this life. The East Wind was never a monster, not really – it was death itself. It was plans gone awry. It was having hopes and dreams and watching them fall apart right in front of you. It was the inevitable life that we would both soon be a part of. You see, I was old enough to understand that the Games were happening and what it meant for us when you still had no idea. I was petrified that if I told you straight off about what life had in store for you; for the both of us...”
For the fifth time, John Watson joined Caesar Flickerman upon his stage, but this was the first time he held his little sister’s hand while doing so. They did not wave or even smile at the audience – they simply walked to the unoccupied loveseat and sat down.
Of course he did – just like Sherlock wanted John to know that he would die loved last year. But now that Sherlock knew that he was indeed loved, he wasn’t sure that he wanted to know it anymore.
“Do you know how large of a target is on your back, now?” he asked, voice cracking, pained by the idea of said target.
For the first time since Hannibal started his story, a low murmur rattled through the crowd, and, not for the first time, Sherlock, John, and Harry all exchanged shocked expressions.
“I mean, I’m not saying you’re stupid or slow or anything, in fact you are quite intelligent, and most of it has nothing to do with my influence, you’ve just been that way from the start –” Sherlock went on quickly, trying to backpedal the best he could.
“GO –” he shouted, grabbing onto the nearest person – Sherlock – and leading him down into the pit – into the maze of absolute chaos that was happening in the audience’s section below. “GO! GO TO THE –”
He smiled down at John and patted his shoulder, and then he walked to the door that one of the two Peacekeepers was holding open for him. Just as he reached the doorway, he turned back to Snow.
“We didn’t exactly get far enough to really figure out how what Charles Augustus did affects me,” John revealed.
“One more thing, if you don’t mind,” he said, but didn’t wait for a response. “I meant to ask: how did my brother taste?”
There had been a night, in the penthouse, where Mycroft and John (Mentors through and through) stayed up late into the night watching the last Quarter Quell – Hannibal Lecter Magnussen’s Games. Sherlock had woken up and made a trip to the bathroom while they were discussing how monstrous Hannibal and Charles Augustus were, which sparked Sherlock’s curiosity. The following night, after everyone had fallen asleep, Sherlock went and found the disc (which hadn’t been too hard to find) and he took the disc into his room, and watched the last Quarter Quell. He watched Will Graham die, watched Hannibal Magnussen eat his victims and win the Games –
There was a moment more of silence from the crowd, as they finished processing what President Snow had ordered John to do, and then the screaming started.
One day, at the end of August, one month, thirteen days, eighteen hours, eight minutes and thirty-five seconds after Mycroft died, the phone rang, and Sherlock picked it up, thinking it was Dean checking in on him (like he always did every day), but that wasn’t the voice he heard on the other line. In fact, he hadn’t heard the voice before.
Sherlock reached out and grabbed the sword in front of him, and then he was surrounded by the sounds of splashing – the sound of tributes hurling themselves into the water.
“Okay, the fact that everyone in the Capitol is immune to the punishment might have something to do with it.”
“Why I killed Mischa, of course, is simple: not for power, and not to prove that I could, but to protect her. I had been in the Hunger Games Arena; I had lived in that world. If Mischa had been reaped, she wouldn’t have survived. She would have died in the Hunger Games and I would have nothing of her. Now I have her – all of her – here with me, at all times. Which, I believe, is a far better fate than burying her underground, never to know her again.”
The meeting with Sherlock – their five minutes unsupervised – was Hannibal’s last saving grace. It was his last chance –
He held onto Harry from the moment she hugged him, making sure their skin didn’t lose contact with the other’s on the way from the ground to the air – from the Arena to the hovercraft – from fear to relief. Sherlock kept his arm around Harry’s shoulder as a Peacekeeper donned in black descended from the hovercraft and ushered them to the ladder. They held each other’s hands as they ascended up the ladder, and they didn’t let go when they made it inside.
Something in her words transported John back to a conversation that he and Sherlock had once, in a world that seemed years and years from the current moment but really only took place six months in the past:
“You wanted to be involved, didn’t you? Come on, lean forward a bit and stick your face out. For William, Harriet. For John.”
“No, I’m not, John. You don’t realize this but you…you breathe differently, when you’re thinking about him. I noticed it when you had nightmares about him and then I noticed that you breathe the same way when you’re awake, when you’re lost, when you’re in that stairwell. And I try to ground you, but…” Sherlock sighed. “I feel useless,” he admitted. “And I’ve never felt useless, before, but I do. Because when you’re thinking about him…I can’t touch you – I’m afraid to touch you – I don’t feel like I
“GO!” Sherlock shouted in reply, trying to get himself out from under the man. “FIND MYCROFT I’LL CATCH UP –”
The second big decision they made as an engaged couple was on where to go from District 12; this was a pretty easy decision to make, as soon as they remembered that they were definitely taking Harry with them: District 9, while not having the most interesting of exports, was at least home to (or was the home of) certain people who held special places in each of their hearts – Victor Trevor for John, Archie Neal for Sherlock, and Louise Neal for Harry. The land, a little bit more populated than District 12 but mostly consisting of farmland, would be familiar to them, unlike the cities of some of the other Districts (like 3, 4, and 5, which the two boys had also briefly considered moving to), but after they had considered District 9, there wasn’t any other option they could think of that would be better for them.
Another thing Sherlock needed serious help categorizing was his relationship with John, and, fortunately, John also needed the help. The two boys knew their relationship had practically jumpstarted itself – landing them in a committed relationship before even dating. They never got a chance to get used to the idea of being together in a sense that was more than just friendship before they suddenly were just that. And while neither boy minded jumping from being best friends and nothing more to being completely head-over-heels in love with one another, they both were completely aware that this was out of the ordinary. They also knew what the Capitol thought of them – there was physical evidence of exactly what the Capitol speculated they were doing and exactly how their relationship was blossoming in at least one article per edition of just about every magazine and newspaper printed since John’s first interview with Caesar Flickerman nearly two years ago, and there seemed to no signs of the articles stopping any time soon.
“Who bribed you, and with what?” John asked. There was no way Sherlock was this happy to be trapped in a train with Mrs. Hudson, his brother, two babbling prep teams, and twenty different Peacekeepers for two weeks.
Sherlock leaned against the door and slid down, down, down, until he was sitting on the floor, in nothing but a sheet, with his back up against the door.
Magnussen could think that Sherlock and Harry would be dumb enough to willingly go to the feast and go there to meet them, but if Magnussen knew everything about Sherlock from his sexual orientation to his addiction to Morphling, he probably knew of their food situation at home. If this was a regular Hunger Games, and a feast like this was being offered to two kids from the Seam in District 12 instead of two siblings of previous victors, they would go after it immediately, not thinking nor caring about the consequences because there was food and they were going to die there, anyway, but Sherlock and Harry weren’t those kids. Harry was never from the Seam but knew what it was like to be hungry, and while Sherlock
At first, when John first suggested it, Sherlock really didn’t think it would work. He was in love with John, and John was in love with him; he didn’t need to sort through that. But once they started reading more and more about themselves, it seemed to really help Sherlock – seeing their entire relationship from the eyes of others laid out before him. He knew everything the Capitol had thought of them – known about it since the beginning – but physically being able to read it helped him sort out his mind palace when it came to him and John. His feelings didn’t need sorting – neither of their feelings did – but it helped them both fall in love beyond the Games – beyond what they needed their relationship to be for the Capitol. The last page of the notebook held the one and only thing Sherlock and John had written themselves, completely on their own, signing it in their own names:
“Aw, come on – you don’t even like –” Dean started as Mycroft took a sip, making a face. “You know, it’s an open bar; I could always get another one –”
“I imagined so.” He held his tremoring hand out for Sherlock to see. “I had thought it was simply arthritis, until I had an appointment with the medical examiner.”
But then Panem’s anthem played across the skies, and the Capitol’s seal lit up the world around Sherlock as it announced the twelve people who had died that day, and that was the only way Sherlock could see that yes, those were indeed crows. He glanced up every few seconds, watching the faces of the deceased, searching for any faces that would jump out at him, whether it was Harry’s or Charles Augustus Magnussen’s.
When Sherlock woke up he was exhausted, but still he stumbled out of John’s room and down the hallway to the sitting room, where Harry was sitting on the sofa in her pajamas, eating from a large bowl of ice cream. He stopped in the doorway, yawning and rubbing the sleepiness from his eyes.
Sherlock and John looked up at him, and all Mycroft had to do was nod for them to understand – it was time.
“How deep do you think it is?” John asked, and Sherlock tore his eyes away from the water, sparkling in the sunshine.
After John was decked out in winter attire, he was led outside to meet with Sherlock in front of all of the cameras. He had a black coat on over his cardigan and had what he felt was one of the ugliest hats in the world upon his head –
His eyes found the source of the voice, and something in him came back to life and died again just as quickly.
As Sherlock had told him before, he was talented. Of course, he was talented in a lot of areas, so it shouldn’t have been that much of a surprise for John to discover yet another thing his friend was good at. The first lessons were awkward, and involved much stepping on feet, shuffling, joking, and giggling, but Sherlock was a good teacher. Not to mention the fact that John didn’t really care how good he was or how good he got; he simply wanted to dance with Sherlock for the rest of time.
But Sherlock quickly shook his head, shaking away whatever thought was in that busy, broken brain of his, and he turned to Dean, who had stood up from his seat in the front row of the audience.
Before that day, Sherlock had never heard a gun go off in his life. Civilians didn’t own guns; the Peacekeepers stationed full-time in District Twelve all slacked on enforcing the rules so much so that most of them didn’t even carry guns on them, and instead just walked around with empty holsters. Guns were never used in any Hunger Games arena, either – it was out of the question, for then the Games would be over far too quickly, and not enough blood would be shed to please the Capitol. The closest thing Sherlock had ever heard that he could compare to the sound of the guns was the canons in the Games.
“Mycroft Holmes and I met for the first time when he returned from his Hunger Games, when I was seven years old and he was sixteen...and honestly? He intimidated me. I had never met a victor of the Hunger Games before, and I had watched him kill people – and I was just a kid. He was bigger and stronger than me and even bigger and stronger than John and...I had no idea that who you are in the Arena is not who
“Harry – I didn’t see you –” he then approached her, and he was able to see what was in her hands – a beer bottle. “Harry...?” he started, not considering how hypocritical he was going to sound for telling Harry off for drinking when he had been more or less high on Morphling for the past day.
They spent their afternoon this way – calling back and forth to each other across the water as John tried to teach himself how to swim, and Sherlock sat on a rock besides John’s discarded clothes and shoes on the shore, trying not to stare at John Watson for too long.
“I think he was just bored, trying to avoid living out the rest of his sentence. Life in prison ends with death and all that…” the guard trailed off as Sherlock nodded. “He’s asked for you and Mr. Watson, on a few occasions.”
Mrs. Hudson rounded on him. “This isn’t funny, young man! If you two don’t fit into your outfits for the interview there will be
It was at that moment the broken pieces of the night before fit together in a way John could finally comprehend. Just before he had run off the stage after Mycroft had shot President Snow, he saw Claudius Templesmith talking into a handheld phone of some sort. The way that he looked at John as he spoke into the device – it made sense now.
“Of course we have – we’re taught to swim before we know how to walk – and we know how to fish before we know how to write our own names,” Dean replied, chuckling. “It’s really beautiful out there, actually.”
“Yes,” he replied. “In fact, I suggested branding them with cigarette burns, similar to the one your lover possesses, to show that what my brother had done could never be undone.”
“Errands,” Harry answered, and Sherlock immediately knew what she would say next: “John told me everything.”
Suddenly, Sherlock jerked his head up, and for a second John feared the worst: that he’d want to go see Mycroft’s body.
– because of me and Harry and the Games – but it was you all along. But how did you do it?” he asked, squinting at Magnussen, reading him. “He was suddenly
“Did anyone else hear me?” John asked the table at large, and everyone (apart from Mycroft, for obvious reasons) nodded. “Sorry,” he mumbled.
“We’ve all changed in here,” Sherlock said quietly, and Harry nodded, and, in the light of the full moon, Harry took her locket out from under her jumpsuit and opened it up, revealing the pictures of her family and of Sherlock and Mycroft.
“And why the fuck does he think you’d do that?” Harry asked, and Sherlock went back to looking straight ahead as he thought of a logical answer.
“This is my fault. I’m so sorry, brother dear,” he murmured in his ear, just as he had when he returned from the Hunger Games. And even though Sherlock was crying, gripping onto his brother like a child, he could hear him loud and clear. He could hear him, and he didn’t want to listen – didn’t want to make what he was saying real, but he knew that if he didn’t listen now, he wouldn’t be able to hear his brother speak again. “No matter what happens, I love you dearly, Sherlock.”
And then, a different snowball blew past Sherlock and knocked Mycroft’s hat right off of his head. Sherlock turned and found John already scooping up snow for the next attack.
“So did I, Brother Mine. I missed you constantly,” Mycroft said, but Sherlock could tell that there was an underlying message in his words – he hadn’t just missed him, he had also worried about him constantly, as well.
“What’s that?” Sherlock had asked, one day, and John finished his thought on the page before answering:
“...Ormond Sacker,” Sherlock decided, which caused another burst of laughter from John, that faded into a yawn – his tiredness was finally taking him.
a place that people go after they die, I hope that the people we had lost that night – the people we’ve lost over all those years – can hear us. I hope Mycroft can hear me. I hope he knows that –”
“It’s five o’clock,” Mycroft announced when Sherlock and John entered the car for dinner. Per usual, his brother was the first one there. “We’ve been here for
“So, what do you propose?” Mycroft asked cautiously, though John was sure he knew exactly what Snow was proposing.
“I’m going to miss Mycroft Holmes dearly, and I think I speak for all of us when I say that life will never be the same without him. Thank you.”
Sherlock tried to quit, he really did. He did everything he could think of to stop, short of telling Harry and John – if he could help it, they would never find out – the disappointment in John’s eyes would be too much for him to bear.
Harry nodded, her lips pursed, yet she was satisfied with his answer. She then hovered at the podium for a moment in a way that John recognized immediately – in a way that meant she was trying to figure out whether or not she wanted to hug him – but then she decided to go back to her seat.
As the afternoon grew late, John finally pulled himself from the water, and Sherlock again looked away as John got dressed again, and they were back to their respective homes by sundown. Sherlock didn’t think about John, or his naked body, at all that evening as ate dinner and as Mycroft made sure his homework was done for the following day, and Sherlock thought that maybe that was the end of it. Perhaps all boys were curious about each other’s bodies – maybe John would’ve tried to look at Sherlock’s body if Sherlock had taken his clothes off to swim, as well. It was a natural curiosity, nothing more than that, Sherlock decided.
a passcode, and took my prosthetic leg. Mycroft had no idea about any of this as it was happening, but he somehow found out and got me out of there. Like I had said, I knew nothing about the rebellion Mycroft was leading, but maybe what happened to me made him change the plan.”
Sherlock woke up the next morning to someone knocking on John’s bedroom door. He had the instinct to roll over, to throw his pillow at the door, and to tell Mycroft to fuck off, but the thought of the fact that it definitely wasn’t his brother at the door shot Sherlock out of bed completely.
When the group returned from the banquet, Sherlock immediately went to John’s bedroom. He pressed his ear to the door, listening for any signs of life, as if John had just been hiding in his room the whole time, and then, hearing nothing, he turned the knob and let himself in.
you. Anytime you said anything to him about his weight he would always be so excited that his plan was working – if you noticed that he was gaining weight, then so would the Capitol.”
“‘Maybe,’” he chuckled darkly. “Try a lot; you gave him a lot, and we both know it. Maybe even enough to worry you, but you didn’t want to think about it too much, am I right?”
After dinner, Mycroft found his way to John’s room, where Sherlock was doing his homework, and John was listening to Sherlock complain about the differences between the
The second meeting was far less formal – it was held at the dining room table on District 12’s floor of the training center. Mycroft had requested snacks from the Avoxes, but even though John was starving he couldn’t force it down. No one could – their families were going to die. It even felt like a funeral, considering everyone was wearing black.
“Thank you. Goodnight, brother mine,” he said quietly, smiling sadly at his brother, and stepped out of the doorway and began to close the door.
What John thought was going to be a one-time thing quickly became a three-times-weekly-at-least thing, but Sherlock never allowed to let John reciprocate, even though he offered every time after that first afternoon. Whenever John started to insist that he really wouldn’t mind – that it wasn’t fair that Sherlock was doing it so much and John wasn’t doing anything at all for him in return – Sherlock would simply say that it wasn’t “of priority,” whatever that meant. It didn’t stop John from making the offer, though.
John’s heart sank. It wasn’t just Johnlock – Harry was there, too. Everyone seemed to be forgetting that – Harry was there; she had been this whole time. Sure, Sherlock was the one they knew, and Sherlock was the one that they all assumed was having sex with John every night, but didn’t they know there were different kinds of love? Didn’t they know that John loved his sister as much as he did Sherlock, only in different ways?
Because despite the fact that he was broken out of the cell, Sherlock and Harry were still in trouble.
“If you’d like,” Mycroft went on, slowly. “I can send a message along to them for you, seeing as you aren’t allowed to see them until tomorrow night.”
There was only one entrance to the training center, which made it easy to guard for when there were twenty-four tributes who weren’t allowed to exit the building living within it, and also making it easy for Mycroft to watch for John’s return. There was no possible way for John to enter the building without Mycroft intercepting him.
above all the other noise. He was just as surprised that President Snow didn’t say anything about it – all he did was welcome the tributes and act as if it were any other Quarter Quell – any other Hunger Games. But Mycroft wasn’t going to act this way, and Sherlock knew that.
When he and Sherlock got together, even before the night before Sherlock’s Hunger Games began, John had written off the possibility of having any sort of sexual relationship with Sherlock. Sherlock seemed to have absolutely no desire in doing anything beyond kissing, only showing an interest the night before his Games, but that was simply to give John a good memory to look back upon when Sherlock was gone. When he and Sherlock started their relationship, John had resigned himself to a life without sex, with only himself to do those sorts of things for him, and he was surprisingly okay with it, especially after coming back from the Arena, but he hadn’t felt the need to really do any of that since…
“A little boy...and someone new, relatively new...” he breathed in one more time, and a smile spread across his face. “Oh – a bouncing baby girl; how precious. Tell me: are you a good father, Will?”
“I’ll see you at the interview, Mister Holmes!” Snow called out from behind him, and that only made Mycroft even more determined.
Sherlock sighed, frustrated. He hated admitting this sort of thing out loud, especially when it was something as trivial as –
There were also nights, occasionally, at first, but more and more often as the months went on, where John would wake up in the middle of the night to find Sherlock missing from his place beside him, having retreated to his brother’s bed. John never had to check; after listening for a few minutes to the quiet of the house, he could make the deduction on his own. He didn’t think Sherlock knew that he was aware of it, though, for John would always wake up in the morning with Sherlock sleeping next to him, again, as if he had been there the whole time – as if he was trying to keep it a secret. So, John never mentioned it, and neither did Sherlock, and that was fine.
“So...to say the least, I’m struggling. It feels like it happened years ago, but it feels like it’s still happening, now, too. And I’m struggling. I’m struggling to talk about it, and I’m struggling to move on...but I am. It’s hard, of course – it’s hard to look my boyfriend in the eye, sometimes...and sometimes when I kiss him, my mind slips back and I’m thinking of Magnussen and it hurts because Sherlock got out of the Arena and his brother had died and I need to be there for him but I can’t even handle my own problems so how am I supposed to help him past his?” He paused for a moment, and his need for air made him realize how he had just spoken so much and so quickly that he ran out of breath. He took a deep breath, and went on. “But...he stays with me. Even when it’s difficult, even when we have no idea what to say to each other, he stays with me. And, together, we’re moving on. We’re getting through it – through everything – the grief, the loss, both of our Games, the assault, the addiction, all of it – we’re getting through it and we’re moving on, together.
– to shouting that he and John had never had sex – they hadn’t even seen each other completely naked – so they could all shut up about it, already. The only thing that kept his mouth shut was that they, thankfully, were still calling him Sherlock. Really, that was the only thing that was saving them from his rage as they scrubbed and waxed and shaved and plucked and trimmed and hosed and scrubbed and adjusted and hosed him down for the third time and never shut up about stupid things Sherlock couldn’t care less about.
“Just let me finish!” John exclaimed, glaring at Harry before returning his attention back to Sherlock. “He probably thinks you feel the same way he does, right now – he thinks you could relate to each other – bond over it, or something –”
Alexander Waters for District 4 (as he is the only surviving victor from District 4 that isn't the President)
For a moment, the world – the Hunger Games, the smell of hay and the Capitol’s many-scented soaps, the sounds of the commotion around him, all if it – was gone, and all John could feel was Sherlock’s soft, warm mouth and feel his beautifully clean hands holding onto John’s. It was almost therapeutic, but it had to end.
He opened his eyes to shake hands with Harry, and saw two hands in the air, three fingers displayed. He glanced down, and found Mr. and Mrs. Watson were attached to those hands. Slowly, the people around them kissed their fingers and held them up in the air, too, and the people around those people did the same. In moments, all of District 12 was saluting Sherlock and Harry. And, as if on cue, Sherlock, Harry, John, and Mycroft did the same.
are going to figure out John’s big secret. Because I know you know it, deep down in your mind palace – you’ve already figured out that John’s in trouble, haven’t you? Of course you have. So, you’re going to start talking, and I am going to listen, and Harriet, here, will continue to be the most vital part of this conversation by letting me flick her face. You tell us all the secret, and I’ll stop flicking Harriet’s face. If not...well,” he said, tightening his grip on the curved knife, and Sherlock got the message loud and clear. “Let’s not focus on that part, just yet.”
John had whispered, unable to tear his eyes away from Sherlock’s as he slipped Sherlock’s wedding ring onto his finger.
“Thank you both for coming in, today. How did you enjoy the Victory Banquet last night, Mycroft?” Snow asked. “I certainly noticed you frequent the food tables more than usual.”
Once it was gone, Sherlock led the very tired John to his room and helped him into bed. As he was very quickly drifting away, he felt Sherlock rubbing his back.
“You shouldn’t be. If President Snow wants to refuse your request I’ll speak to him,” Mycroft promised, and he let go of John, revealing Louise Neal wiping her eyes, watching him. A thousand years ago, he might’ve made a joke about how he normally doesn’t make girls cry upon their first meeting, but he was nowhere near the person he was then – he wasn’t even sure the person he used to be would recognize the person he was, now.
“Night, Dean,” John replied, and with that, he left the room, mentally preparing himself for a sleepless night, full of worrying about what tomorrow’s meeting with President Snow would bring.
he had said when asking Sherlock to bring it up to Mrs. Hudson), and Sherlock agreed. Mrs. Hudson didn’t give much of an argument once Sherlock assured her that she can put
“Hi – hello. I’m Harry Watson – Harriet Watson, for those of you who don’t know me – I’m John Watson’s sister, and I won the Hunger Games alongside Sherlock Holmes just a few days ago.
In the first few weeks after John returned from his Hunger Games, Sherlock was almost exclusively the one to help him cope. Of course, Mycroft had been there, and John’s parents and Harry had been there, but they weren’t the ones staying up with John through the night, or the ones he vented his innermost thoughts and feelings to, or the ones he recounted his nightmares with. They weren’t there in the moments beyond the fence when he was
“Now for the boys,” Mrs. Hudson said, just able to hide her sadness, and reached into Sherlock’s glass bowl.
He couldn’t remember if he had ever thanked Mycroft for that. He swallowed the lump that had suddenly formed in his throat, suddenly glad that it was too dark for Harry to see his eyes watering. The tracker jacker venom must’ve still been affecting him if he missed Mycroft

“Well, I was wondering – well I wasn’t wondering, I was thinking – I was thinking maybe we could – I mean everyone else is; they’re probably expecting it – maybe you’d like to – maybe we – dance?” he forced out, finally looking into John’s eyes. “Would you like to dance with me?”
“You alright?” Dean asked quietly once he had gotten close enough, and Sherlock nodded in reply, rolling up his right sleeve to expose his inner elbow – and the oldest scars from the last time he had found himself relying on Morphling.
“Victor Trevor. Philip Anderson, too, but I wasn’t completely aware of what I was doing until…until after the fact. With Victor…he was my friend – Christ, he even admitted to having a crush on me – we were friends, and I killed him. Yes, Philip and I were friends, too – at least, I consider ourselves to be, even if he was extremely homophobic – but, in the fog…he was begging for me to kill him, and that fog – that gas – made me think that I had no other choice but to do it. I had a reason, a terrible reason that probably doesn’t even hold up, here, but a reason all the same. The only reason I had for killing Victor was that he looked like Sebastian Moran. He didn’t need to die like I thought Philip had to in order to put him out of his misery. I simply killed him because I was afraid he was someone else. Victor was my first kill, and I still hate myself for it.”
“Okay – just wait outside I’ll find you after the –” but before John could finish, Sherlock got up out of his seat and dashed out of the auditorium.
Rosamund ends up working in the Capitol as a doctor. During her training for the job, she catches the eye of a man, also being trained as a doctor. One night after their classes, as she walks back to her apartment, the man tries to walk with her so she wouldn't walk home alone at night, but she, needing no protection, punches him in the face, giving him a black eye and a bloody nose. He tells no one about what she did to him, and soon they get to talking. Come to find out, because it apparently IS a small world after all, the man is Andrew Brook, the first cousin once removed of none other than Richard Brook, aka: Jim Moriarty. (Andrew's grandfather was the brother of Richard Brook's father). The two fall in love despite this fact, and John Watson hates EVERYTHING ABOUT IT, but he, upon seeing that the young man is nothing like Moriarty, gives his blessing.
“Why are they announcing middle names this year?” John asked Mycroft, once the interviewers left them alone. “They’ve never done that before.”
In District Four, Sherlock and John met Dean Bainbridge – the man who had helped Mycroft through his first year of mentoring.
“Wait –” Louise said, and Sherlock froze, his eyes glued to the steps before him. “Someone should go with you,” she said, quietly. “It shouldn’t just be you up there.”
He could feel his future-self cracking under the pressure – trying to hold on to himself and losing grip in the face of Charles Augustus holding him down and invading his very being over and over – he could feel himself losing the memories he held dear – the memories of when he was free – the memories of Sherlock –
him – and then he looked out into the crowd, finding John’s eyes again. They looked back up at him, worried, as if asking him the question,
Charles Augustus Magnussen had known about the Morphling, just as Hannibal Lecter Magnussen knew about it, now.
“You rest, Sherlock –” Harry said, her voice almost as soothing to him as her brother’s. “No one will find us here.”
After the initial thought that Mycroft was at the door, and after realizing that it was impossible, he thought he knew exactly who was at the door – by process of elimination, it had to be Harry.
John smiled to himself, and it felt like a bit of weight had been lifted from his chest. Yes, he was on his way to a meeting with President Snow for reasons that only Snow knew, but Sherlock Holmes loved him, and that mattered so much more.
John looked to Sherlock, to find his boyfriend’s jaw moving with silent words he couldn’t figure out how to say out loud – he was never good at comforting others, and he was still trying to cope with Mycroft’s death, so it was okay with John that nothing was coming out. He was trying – he was trying so hard – and that was enough for John. After all, his parents had served as Sherlock’s foster parents whenever Mycroft couldn’t – it was impossible for Sherlock not to feel the loss as John did – in a way, they were his parents, too.
“How have you been?” he asked, fighting the urge to cover his mouth to keep himself from speaking – to keep himself from trying so
“You’ve put on weight since I left,” Sherlock remarked, glancing between Mycroft’s face and his protruding stomach. “That waistcoat’s clearly newer than the jacket.”
Please don't be shy to follow or message me; I love hearing from you guys and thanks for coming with me on this journey (that never seems to end but is almost over!)
He tore his eyes from the screen – from his own horrified face – and scanned the audience, as if he could actually tell the faces apart and find the person he was looking for.
“The kits are on their way,” Mycroft announced, and John wanted to be relieved, but there was a question that had been bugging at John since Sherlock woke up, something that he desperately wanted to ask Mycroft. “I also made sure there were a few things in Sherlock’s for his shoulder wound –”
“The way I feel about you has not changed, and I don’t think it ever will,” Sherlock said after a few moments.
When he walked through the door of the Holmes-Watson household, Sherlock was already awake – a short nap for him, these days, which was good news. He was now resting on the couch, trying desperately not to guzzle down a glass of water that Harry had obviously given to him.
John only glanced up for a second at the face-obscuring helmet, and then cast his eyes back to the ground, his heart hammering in his chest.
And then Sherlock Holmes cut off Magnussen’s penis and testicles, with Magnussen screaming the whole time.
"After my Games – a month or two after we all came back to Twelve – you and Harry had gone back to school but it was before the Monroe’s had offered to let me work in their office. I was home alone and Mycroft came over to visit and at first he just seemed to just be checking on me, but on his way out... He turned to me and told me that if I broke your heart, or if I hurt you in any way, he would, in his exact words, make me ‘regret leaving the Arena alive,’” John chuckled again at the memory.
“Mikhail’s failing half his classes – I can’t copy off his homework like I can yours. And you’re at least interesting,” John added, but Sherlock noticed that John did not negate the accusation that Sherlock was weird.
Sherlock watched John’s eyes moving back and forth under his eyelids in REM sleep, and smiled to himself. He was dreaming – not having a nightmare, but dreaming – and so had Sherlock. Neither of them were waking up in a panic, waking up screaming, waking up shoving the other away or holding onto the other for dear life. They were just sleeping. They were only dreaming. Because they had each other, and because they, for the first time in years, were safe.
Sherlock would not be one of those people. If he could, he’d stay as close to the center of the Arena as he could. If he could, he’d take the Cornucopia, but that was a stupid thing to think – so stupid – if anyone took the Cornucopia, it would be the Career tributes, not him.
John was born in March, and Harry in May, and their birthdays were always celebrated by the Watsons and the Holmes. In their younger years, before meeting the Holmes’, their mother would use as much money as she could get away with to buy them each a loaf of bread that would serve as their birthday cake. Once Mycroft retuned from his Games, however, he made sure each Watson child had a fairly small birthday cake, and their mother would place one candle in the center for the birthday child to blow out. Harry and John were both children of routine – every year, they asked for the same thing: vanilla cake for John, and chocolate for Harry (John always had the suspicion that Mycroft enjoyed Harry’s cakes more than John’s). He suddenly remembered all those years, all her birthdays, watching her blow out that single candle each and every year. When she was a child, she wore dresses to celebrate the occasion and her hair in pigtails and braids, but as she got older she traded the dresses for t-shirts and jeans, and wore her hair down as if it was any other day. She smiled every year, surrounded by her family and friends from school, except for this past year – her sixteenth birthday. She had begged their mother not to even get a cake, but she had anyway, but she at least knew not to make a big deal about the celebration. For Harry’s last birthday, as she was surrounded by only her family, she only smiled half-heartedly for her mother as she blew out her candle. What had been the wish she had made? If she lived through these Games, would her wish have come true?
John then looked over at his sister, and as soon as she saw him looking at her she pulled up one corner of her lips into a sad excuse for a half-smile, and he reached out and held her hand, too.
The two Peacekeepers nodded, stepped aside, and opened the double doors, allowing for Mycroft and John to pass.
“Mycroft is the name my mother gave me; I wish he’d make the struggle to the end,” he muttered, then looked up at him. “I’m being summoned,” he said with a shrug, trying to disguise how happy he was that he was being dragged away from Hannibal Lecter Magnussen.
When Sherlock was done brushing his teeth, he stood in the doorway to the bathroom, crossed his arms, and watched John sitting on the bed that they shared, his nose buried deep in the booklet. After a few moments, John looked up – and the guilt was written all over his face.
First, there was a man that John knew he had met but couldn’t place from where – whether he was a past victor or someone John had met through the Rebellion or the Games, he had no idea – that was, until Clover Frankland entered the room behind him. The man’s name was Pollux – he was the escaped Avox that served as Clover’s interpreter – until they started dating, John realized as they exchanged pleasantries with him and sat down next to him, holding hands. Then, right before the meeting was about to begin, Alexander Waters rushed in and sat himself on John’s other side, much to John’s shock and relief.
It sounded completely unnatural in Sherlock’s ears. He had heard the story last night – he knew the story – but not like this.
“Get off of me, you little bitch!” the Peacekeeper growled, shaking her off of him easily – way too easily.
“If he says anything about you, or about John, you kick his ass, got it?” she asked, her face completely serious.
They didn’t even discuss it when John exited the house – from that moment on, it was common knowledge: the Watson house no longer belonged to the Watson siblings, and the Holmes house now belonged to all three of them.
“Absolutely, Mr. Holmes,” the driver replied, and started on his way to their destination, leaving the prison, and everyone within it, behind them.
At the sound of her brother’s name, Victoria looked up at Alexander, aghast, as if she was hearing the news for the first time. In moments, Alexander had sat down, put his hand on her shoulder, and started muttering comforting words that John couldn’t quite hear, as the next elderly woman sitting next to Victoria – who John recognized as Nana, spoke.
John remembered Seneca’s excitement during the mentor meeting, and suddenly he felt sick enough to vomit.
“I apologized!” John assured her, then looked to his boyfriend. “I didn’t mean to,” he said quietly. “I was just going to talk to him. But, either way, he’s not going to be giving you any more morphling.”
But now – now that he thought about it – god, Sherlock didn’t realize how much he had wanted it, until now.
“I’m glad to hear that he’s recovering nicely, from what my brother did to him,” Magnussen said, nonchalant, and grinned when Sherlock set his jaw. “Tell me, does he know you’re here today, by any chance?”
After John came back, the two were closer than they ever had been. In fact, since John had become Sherlock’s boyfriend, Harry seemed to fill John’s discarded role – the two of them became best friends. But being best friends with Harry was entirely different from being best friends with John. For one thing, Harry was much more physical in her affections, giving hugs and playfully punching Sherlock in the shoulder – Sherlock and John were never this touchy with each other; becoming boyfriends opened up that barrier between them. It must’ve been obvious that Sherlock wasn’t sure what to do with himself when it came to Harry’s displays of affection, and so she started the high-fives. Suddenly, it seemed like every time they walked by each other she’d put her hand out, and Sherlock’s hand would meet hers halfway. It became their secret way of saying that they saw and acknowledged each other, and now she expected one now, right in front of Hannibal Lecter Magnussen.
John did not know what helped him, whether it was the snowball fight Sherlock had initiated the night before, or fact that he knew Greg Lestrade never planned to win the Hunger Games, or some combination of the two, but somehow it was easier for him to get through Greg’s speech in District 6:
“You were the first and last girlfriend he ever brought home,” Sherlock mumbled, unsure of why he was giving her that fact.
After that, it seemed like everyone had a question for Hannibal. A good portion of the questioners had follow-up questions.
“It’s great! I think you’re wrong about the muttations, though,” he exclaimed, chuckling, stepping farther back into the water as Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Any idea how to swim?” he asked, now up to his chest, and Sherlock shook his head.
As Julia spoke, she looked up at Steven to find that a mosquito had attached itself to his neck, and was now the size and color of a strawberry, full of Steven’s blood. She pointed at the bug, and he slapped it, spurting his blood all over his hand. He quickly wiped it off on his pants.
“Lavinia,” he tried, and she nodded, then opened the door for him before he could say anything else. Luckily, the main room in the penthouse was empty – there was no sign of Mrs. Hudson or Cinna or Mycroft or –
“Come on,” she said, as if she was letting a guard down – perhaps she was, John thought as he hugged her. The hug lasted for only a few seconds, and then she held him at arm’s length. “I only knew him for as long as you did, but he would’ve wanted you to win, out of everyone,” she said quietly, and John found himself nodding.
“Yes,” Harry admitted quietly. “It was last year when you were in the Arena. Sherlock and I used to split bottles from Mycroft’s stash and then I started drinking entire bottles on my own.”
“Well, yeah – you decided to vanish off the face of the earth and take a relaxing vacation to the roof during training. So yes, I’m a little off – excuse me for caring,” John replied, trying to make it sound natural.
Of course, since John was the victor of the Hunger Games, and this entire party was for him anyway, he was dragged away from Sherlock almost every minute. Obviously fed up, Sherlock did the one thing John never imagined he would do: he invited John to dance.
When he got back to his seat, his eyes wandered over to Harry’s paper, where she had already checked the box to show her support of locking him up and making him ineligible for the release program. In the commentary section of the voting ballot, she was just finishing up writing her reasoning, which John had to smile at:
“It all seems so farkjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjc            ZF
“You probably won’t have to miss the food for too long,” Dean informed Harry. “I mean, now that we’re in power, one of the first things we’ll be doing in rebuilding Panem is making sure everyone in all the Districts gets the same amount of food. Which means that, within the next year, District Twelve will be getting everything the Capitol did – including the ingredients to make ice cream and pizza.”
And then, he could feel John’s hands on his body again. Soft but firm, reassuring, knowing what they were doing, able to name exactly what part of Sherlock’s body they were touching –
Sherlock checked his – previously Mycroft’s, and previously their father’s, before that – pocket watch and sighed, frustrated.
“Of course,” Dean replied, pulling John into a hug. “And if you need anything else, any of you, just give me a call.”
And finally, Mycroft closed the door, taking the candle with him, Sherlock alone to the darkness, the darkness of both his room, and of the uncertainty that painted Sherlock’s mind in black.
“Twelve tributes are alive. Sherlock’s in sector seven, Harry’s in sector six, Julia and Steven are in sector twenty-four, and Magnussen’s with the rest of the Careers in sector eighteen,” Louise replied.
“Yeah, still not sure if that was the best way to go about it,” Alexander admitted. “But it worked, and I’m still here, so life’s looking up.”
“Shit,” Louise said before anyone else could, standing up and walking up to Lavinia. “Let’s get you to Alexander – he might know a way to get the train back here so you can get on –” she started, but then stopped when she noticed Lavinia signing. “What?”
Even though she tried to look relaxed, like she had been sitting there the whole time, it was obvious that she had just sat down, trying to look nonchalant as Sherlock entered the room. Sherlock was sure that she had heard him when he vomited upstairs; that she had stood at the bottom of the stairs, listening as Sherlock struggled to clean up his own mess, and had rushed back to her seat on the couch before he had seen her waiting for him.
All throughout dinner, Sherlock watched Harry, reading her like a book – like he always could with nearly everyone – making sure that, despite the fact that she was still in that stupid red-and-black suit, she was okay.
– because he couldn’t be touched. And then...” He covered his eyes with his hand, and wrapped his other arm around his chest, as if holding himself together. “He felt me up through my pants,” he admitted, his voice wet with tears. “And he kissed me.”
Even though Sherlock had found out what he had been thinking about that night specifically eight days later – in the Arena.
When Sherlock had first arrived back home from the Games, devastated by the loss of his brother but still with John by his side, he had tried to be better – nicer. More social. He wanted to make Mycroft proud, despite still high on morphling most of the time.
is. He and I both entered through these gates earlier today to meet with President Snow. I was dismissed, John was not, and he still hasn’t emerged. Where. Is. He?”
After a night of trying and failing and trying some more to sleep, Sherlock woke up in his own bed, shaking like a leaf and sweating buckets.
“We weren’t just friends,” Dean muttered quietly, so quietly that Sherlock didn’t think he heard it right at first, but he knew deep down that he had indeed heard it right.
Someone had hurt John, and John didn’t want to speak about it, which led them to fall asleep that night so far apart Sherlock had awoken to find he had stretched out his arm in John’s direction while he slept and he still couldn’t reach him.
“Did you mean it?” Sherlock turned around to find John sitting on the bed, looking up at Sherlock as he took off his prosthetic (a skill he had perfected over the past six months). “What you said this morning?”
“Of course they will,” John assured him, doing the same and waving at the audience that was undoubtedly watching them.
If anyone wants to keep in touch with me between now and whenever this shit gets posted, I'd be happy to hear from you :D
“None of the mentors – none of our brothers and sisters are allowed to be here. Like how Louise can’t come to school with you.”
John wanted to run – wanted to get the hell away from this man, but he couldn’t feel his legs. He couldn’t feel anything, apart from where Charles Augustus’ hand and the tip of his nose were and where his lips had been, and the overwhelming urge to vomit. He found he was staring past Magnussen, at the five on the wall, and no matter what he couldn’t avert his eyes. John couldn’t move at all.
Sherlock walked up to his boyfriend. “Hey,” he said quietly, and it took a moment for John to look up – for him to realize Sherlock was speaking to him. “Let’s go for a walk.”
And, in a lapse of judgment – in a moment of being too distracted by his own thoughts to pay attention to what was right in front of him – his ankle got caught in a trap, and he was pulled about fifteen feet up into the trees.
“Harry,” Sherlock breathed, and pointed at the Jabberjay. “I know what I said – I know it’s not real – but please – kill it – please, kill it.”
“Mycroft Holmes was my mentor for the Hunger Games, and even after the Games he mentored me in more things that just the Games themselves; he also helped me to survive the aftermath, which – speaking from experience – is so much harder to survive. But, by talking to the victors that won the Games between Mycroft’s win and now, I think he’s helped a lot of us, even those who were in no way his responsibility. He was fiercely protective and loyal to those he cared for, and he cared for all of us. And that’s what made him so special – that’s what made him stick out – that amount of caring. And we all know that he would’ve killed for any of us –
John preferred it when Mycroft led the conversations of who John was talking to – it was like he was taking a load off of John’s shoulders that John didn’t even knew he had until now. Ever since the end of his Hunger Games, casual conversation was difficult – he didn’t know how to open, how to close without seeming rude – it was as if he was turning into Sherlock. Mycroft was good at conversation, though – he drifted in and out and on to other people as naturally as breathing. John wondered if he used to be like that, and if he could ever get back to a point where he could converse normally.
Instantly, Sherlock caught himself, and pursed his lips, making sure not even air escaped his mouth.
As the team was driven (in one of the Capitol’s cars) to the train station, Sherlock held onto John’s gloved hand, looking out the window.
“Obviously, Sherlock and I had a vague awareness of each other before Mycroft was reaped for his Hunger Games; we were in the same District, just a year apart in school, but we had never spoken before the day after Mycroft left for the Games. I didn’t know much about Sherlock at that time – just what other kids at school had said about him, and I had seen his brother reaped just the day before. So I went and talked to him, and he told me that he was all by himself at home; that his parents had both passed away and Mycroft was gone for the Games, and I convinced my parents to let him stay with us until Mycroft came back – possibly forever. The rest is history: Mycroft did come back, and by the time he returned Sherlock and I had become best friends, and by the time I was reaped for the Games, Sherlock had developed a crush on me. And now, a little more than year later, we’re here.
“What about the Escorts? Is Mrs. Hudson okay?” Harry asked, surprising John. He hadn’t known that she cared about the woman much at all.
“You three are never far from each other, are you?” he asked, turning around slowly to face Sherlock. “You and the Watson children?” His mouth wrapped around the words in a way that was eerily similar to the way his brother’s mouth wrapped around John’s name – he did not speak as if he owned them, however. He spoke as if he wanted to eat them.
The youngest of the Holmes brothers took two steps forward, reached out and took the bag, and the eldest closed the distance between them, bringing his brother into a tight embrace.
Sherlock hated going out these days, for the old Watson residence always stood between him and the Village’s gates – every time he wanted out of the Village or back to his house, he would have to walk by John’s old house and all of the regrets it held.
If he were in any other situation, he would’ve smiled sadly at her need to follow the rules, even whilst helping about twenty five prisoners to escape. Instead, he was just thankful that she didn’t take off with the keys altogether. He took the ring of keys and unlocked the locker in question, and opened the door to reveal John’s prosthetic leg (his shoe still on its foot), and a shelf containing cases of vials and sterile syringes – one of the labels on the cases of vials read TRKR/JKR/VNM, and it was obvious to Mycroft what it meant: tracker jacker venom. Mycroft took two vials and a syringe out of the case and approached the Peacekeeper again.
But instead of fainting, he stood, pulling Harry up with him. As she bounced up and down beside him, happier than she had been in weeks, Sherlock stood still for just a moment, his feet glued to the ground, but then he reminded himself it was real – he wasn’t dreaming – and started walking to him, pulling Harry along.
“You look fantastic, Sherlock,” John finally said, after Sherlock had quickly described the feelings that John had felt while he was being scrubbed down and turned into the Capitol’s perfect toy, and then John turned to Harry. “And you – I want to cry. You’re beautiful.”
“No, no, it’s okay,” John replied, waving it off. “I think you scared Harry more than you scared me. I knew you were alright.”
Something was wrong with Hannibal – very wrong – and they both knew it, but neither of them mentioned it – Hannibal out of pride and Sherlock out of fear that it meant he’d lose yet
“Indeed,” Mycroft agreed, and sighed again. “They would’ve been so proud of you,” he whispered, almost as if it was just an afterthought, but Sherlock knew that anything involving their parents was far from an afterthought.
Dinner passed entirely too slowly, but the moment Sherlock and Harry were taken into separate rooms by their prep teams, Mycroft informed Mrs. Hudson that if she needed him that he would be on the fourth floor with Dean Bainbridge, and if she didn’t need him for anything, he’d see her in Caesar’s studio before the final interview. In reality, he knew she wouldn’t need him for anything, but giving her a story would deter her from asking questions; she didn’t know him well enough to call upon his bluff. Although she looked as if she wanted to yell at him some more over Sherlock and Harry’s stupid ice cream meal, she believed his lie and let him go.
Sherlock didn’t care to look behind him at the response – all he cared about in that moment was John’s wellbeing.
“You should’ve found a new hiding place – the sock index was the first place I looked. I should’ve fucking known you were back to this shit when you started…” John trailed off, talking mostly to himself, but Sherlock knew exactly what he was referencing.
He stuck his hand out for John to shake, but before John could fully comprehend what he was doing, he reached out, grabbing onto the man’s wrist with his left hand and he slammed a punch into the man’s outstretched arm with his opposite hand. Emmettson Blasscliffe groaned as John then wrapped his right hand around the man’s throat, stepping into the house as he pushed him up against the wall of his own house, and John kicked the door shut behind them, all within a matter of seconds.
“Are we breaking up?” he finally asked, feeling childish for even asking. “So I can focus on helping Harry?”
“My name is John Watson. I am eighteen years old. I am on this train, on my way to District Nine. It’s five...” he trailed off, unsure.
John glanced behind him to see that Harry had made another perfect throw, hitting another Peacekeeper’s head. Of course, a simple high-heeled shoe wasn’t enough to stop them completely, but it was enough to momentarily stun whomever she hit, and that was good enough for them.
“I heard about that – during lunch today, there was a bit of a scuffle but no one had to interfere so it was fine. That was you?” John asked, and Sherlock scoffed in reply.
“…and if you don’t want to, that’s absolutely alright, I completely understand –” Dean said, still talking after all this time.
“I told him that he wasn’t allowed in the stairwell, and he laughed, saying that no one had said that to him in years. He asked me if I knew who he was – blowing smoke in my face –”
“For now, I am. We’ll allow a proper vote after this all dies down, to make sure no one feels like we’re just taking over everything and just being a different version of Snow. I’m going to be representing the Mockingjay Rebellion and what it stands for, and I’ll lead, for now. Mycroft – he chose me to do it if he...” For the first time ever, he looked unsure of himself as he searched for the words. “...wasn’t able to do it himself.”
So he watched as the cameras checked in on Sherlock and the careers and the rest of the tributes and finally, the cameras checked in on his sister. She was climbing a tree, trying to find a suitable place to sleep, when –
Sherlock went downstairs and looked at the Christmas tree in the living room, surrounded by presents wrapped in gauze.
“How many are left?” he asked, deciding it was his turn to change the subject as Harry packed their things away.
“Now look at your watch. What time is it?” John asked, letting go of Sherlock’s face so he could move his head. He brought his wrist up to his face, letting his eyes finally adjust to the darkness as he consulted his watch.
tell – but he could also see something as he looked over Harry, her body language was screaming what he had been too preoccupied with John’s absence and the death of his brother to notice over the past few days. Finally –
Sherlock almost had the thought to scoff at the words John had chosen – there was no amount of doctors or time or anything that could ever possibly “fix this.”
“So you didn’t have a problem then, did you?” Sherlock asked, and he noticed John biting his lip to keep from laughing.
John looked up at Mycroft, taken aback by how casually he had brought it up – how he could easily just call it a ‘debacle’ – and Mycroft looked down at him.
Figures began to appear, a few at a time – whitish blue, glowing, only just transparent – until they reached almost two thousand – the ghosts of the Hunger Games’ dead tributes. The last time they had showed up in an Arena was not too long ago, in Paul Sawyer’s Arena in the Seventieth Hunger Games – sixteen hundred tributes, still containing their fatal injuries, had invaded the entire Arena. Now there were seventeen hundred ghosts, and all of them wanted to haunt Harry Watson.
He suddenly felt extremely aware of the wetness of Magnussen’s saliva on his face, and he wiped it off, digging his nails into his skin, trying to get it off – get it out of his pores – get it away –
And then, at the bottom of the box, so far under everything else that it couldn’t be seen upon opening the box, laid a single envelope, with
Everyone in the audience started shouting at once, all of them trying to make themselves heard above all others, as they gave their own opinions to John. It was a mess of noise, but somehow John was still able to pick out singular voices – cries of “HARRY!” and “SHERLOCK!”, all overlapping each other. Some people yelled more than just that, of course, but anything else they had to say was lost in the sea of shouting. Then someone started a Johnlock chant, and it spread throughout the crowd of Sherlock-supporters. It was maddening to listen to only for a second, but John couldn’t get them out of his head.
“It’s great to finally meet you. Most of the newest victors feel comfortable talking to the previous year’s victor about mentoring duties and such; for you, that’s me. I know you’ve got Mycroft, but just in case you can’t find him, you know who to ask for.”
Other than the doors to the elevator, there were two doors in the room: one on the left wall, where the Peacekeeper was restrained, and one on the right. Mycroft looked to Lavinia.
There were a lot of times like these, where Sherlock was drunk or high and could barely walk or function, or was so riddled with guilt that he was nearly blind from it, but Hannibal dealt with Sherlock in stride. Every time Sherlock did anything to offend Hannibal, whether it was accidental or strongly reacting to something Hannibal had done wrong, a vague voice in the back of Sherlock’s mind wondered why Hannibal hadn’t eaten him, yet.
“Absolutely not – don’t be stupid –” Sherlock found himself begging, using the same words Mycroft had spoken to him numerous times throughout their lives. But Sherlock knew – he knew and he could tell that Mycroft knew that he knew – that his brother wasn’t being stupid. He was being smart. And, despite everything inside of Sherlock screaming that Mycroft was wrong, he was right.
And then, Sherlock spun one last time – and he was face-to-face with a boy – a boy younger than him by a few years, at least, with curly hair and glasses – and a gaping hole in his chest and stomach. The boy, shaking, stared at him with wide eyes – just about as wide as Sherlock’s looking back at him. He gasped for air, and Sherlock gasped for clarity.
Sherlock’s brother was dead, and here Hannibal was, giving Sherlock the most discreet “shame on you” for burying his brother like everyone else in the entire world would. But what did he expect Sherlock to do? Stop right there in the hallway and –
“Sherlock?” Harry whimpered, her voice small, and Sherlock had never seen her so scared in his whole life. He wished he could just explain it – just tell her what he was thinking – just tell her that he was going to trick the Capitol and if it worked they might actually be able to laugh about it one day – but he needed to keep it a secret from her – from the Capitol – just long enough for it to work – god, it had to work – please let it work –
“Presenting our new tributes from District Twelve: Harriet Watson and William Holmes!” Mrs. Hudson announced, and Sherlock closed his eyes – both of them were now just toys for the Capitol to play with – they weren’t even allowed the freedom of modifying their names to the way they liked them, anymore.
Knowing that if anyone was outside of the maze, they would hear them from just inside, Harry kept going, dragging Sherlock along, going this way and that way, even as she could barely walk straight, even as she saw the maze move on its own and saw shadows out of the corners of her eyes that she knew weren’t really there. She kept stumbling along, trying to get them as lost as possible in the maze, because, just maybe, if
written. So, lots of rewrites. Hence, why I reread Sentiment - start at the beginning, right? So, I'm gonna reread Constantly, now, and correct what needs to be corrected, and then FINISH WHAT NEEDS TO BE FINISHED!!
And suddenly, everyone was looking at Sherlock – some turning in their seats, some straightening up to see over heads. Everyone was staring at him, waiting for him to stand up and make his way to the stage.
“There was once a merchant in the famous market at Baghdad. One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death. Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles to the city of Samarra, for there he was sure Death could not find him. But when at last he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death. ‘Very well,’ said the merchant. ‘I give in. I am yours. But tell me: why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?’ ‘Because,’ said Death, ‘I had an appointment with you tonight – in Samarra.’”
“No, you’re right, there was a reason. It was because Mycroft made a deal with Snow, after he won the Games,” Sherlock replied. “He asked Snow to allow him to stay in District Twelve until I was old enough to be reaped, and in exchange –”
“About four in the morning. Does – does John not know you’re here?” she asked, finally asking the one question that Sherlock expected her – expected anyone who might’ve happened to catch Sherlock out like this – to ask, and he shook his head.
“And I don’t have any reason to worry, do I?” John asked, and even though his eyes and tone were playful, John could tell there was a degree of worry in John’s otherwise innocent question – even now, he was worried that Sherlock would possibly return to drugs, or that seeing Mycroft’s name on the Memorial and the statue on the ten-year anniversary of his death would be too much for Sherlock, and – underneath all that – there was a pang of jealousy; a worry that there might be someone else that Sherlock was meeting behind John’s back. In a way, that bit was right, but not in the way John was thinking.
, right? Mycroft trusted him – and Mycroft would be the first person to know if there were any ulterior motives or reasons to keep his guard up. If Mycroft trusted him, John could too – it was a fact.
When September rolled around, Harry started back in school, much to her dismay. When a victor of the Hunger Games happened to be school-aged, the victor got to choose whether or not to continue schooling, seeing as they won the Games and would never have to work a day for the rest of their lives. Mycroft had chosen to stop attending school, since he knew virtually everything there was to know, anyway; John and Sherlock had both graduated before they were reaped, and so this part of the victory did not apply to them. However, Harry still had two more years of school ahead of her, and she spent the last half of August trying to convince John that she really didn't need to participate in that. This was an argument that Sherlock always had to leave the room for, as the siblings merely had to look at him to know whose side he was on – and it certainly wasn’t John’s. In fact, the first time she brought the matter up, over breakfast, Sherlock kept his head down, his eyes focused on his oatmeal as the two went back and forth, until John happened to glance over at his boyfriend.
are – who you really are. And since Mycroft was nine years older than me and was the ‘cool, older brother’ of my older brother’s new best friend, I never really got a chance to get to know that he was different from what I had seen on the broadcast.
At the sound of his voice, John jumped as he spun around, and Sherlock instantly felt terrible for scaring him.
isolate yourself, this time, Sherlock. Because, fucking hell, after everything we’ve been through – after everything we’ve been through
John turned and looked up to find the large screen switching from the Careers to Sherlock as he walked through the jungle alone.
I was going to make an epilogue where it shows literally everyone's lives after Mycroft's death and how Mycroft's life and death affected them (like Sherlock was going to have a panic when it snows, President Dean Bainbridge was going to hope that Mycroft would be proud of him, etc) but I felt like that was too cheesy, and also I needed everything to just
Sherlock knocked on John’s door. He had stayed in his room for hours – everyone apart from a few Peacekeepers and Avoxes on duty were probably asleep.
Fear – definitely fear. Because those weren’t just Sherlock’s words, anymore; they were Jim Moriarty’s, too.
He couldn’t quite remember how he left Lindsay in the graveyard, or the trip back to the victor’s village – all he could think about was the last thing Lindsay said to him.
His head broke the surface of the water and Sherlock gasped for air, coughing and sputtering and opening his eyes to find –
Sherlock took a cautious step toward the Stag, but it did not move. He took another step, and was then close enough to touch the Ravenstag’s nose. It continued to stare at him, and he continued to stare back.
“Yes you did,” John cut him off before he realized what he was saying, but still he stepped forward, bravery swelling in his chest. “You know exactly what he did, and exactly what he planned to do to me. You’re not sorry; you never were and you never will be. So go feed your bullshit to someone else, because we all know what you’re really about, Hannibal.”
And then Sherlock was alone, in the room that he now realized was glowing red not because of Hannibal’s presence but because that was the color emitting from the monitors that were surrounding him.
But his body was betraying him, just as it had last night with John. He was shaking, fighting back tears – he was afraid. He was always able to divorce himself from emotion – from feelings – but then there was John, and his feelings for John. And now there was him, staring into the face of death, and his fear.
“So I did. John Watson would never sign the necessary papers. He would let me pass in my own time, wanting for me to wrongfully pay for what my brother did to him all those years ago. And I know that President Bainbridge, upon hearing my request, would immediately run to you and John Watson, insisting upon making the subject of my death something to be voted upon amongst the three of you, giving each of you a chance to influence the other two. Given how much you value your husband’s opinion, I imagine you would go along with his decision to let me pass on my own. But you, on your own…I can’t pin you down, Will. I would hope that you would show me mercy and sign the forms, but honestly I am unsure what your answer would be, without John Watson there to sway you. Either way, I wanted to speak to you one last time before I leave this world, Will. And, if you are willing to sign the consent form, I wanted to invite you to watch.”
“I do believe you heard me, Harriet. Can I flick your face?” he repeated, already raising his hand towards her, as if she had already given him the okay.
Sherlock raised his head, staring ahead, into the beyond – the beyond they were supposed to cross into, together.
They all stood with their shoulders touching, in a triangle of affection, all of them trying to hold on to the others and wanting to hug the other two. They couldn’t speak over the crowd’s cheering, but they didn’t have to. They were there, they were all in front of each other, all close enough to touch, and that’s all that mattered.
He stood up from the other side of the room, at the opposite end of a circular table, and he clasped his hands together and smiled, as if seeing old friends. He was wearing a white suit, as if he were trying to blend into the room. Next to him was a sort of a hand-held projector, some kind of Capitol television screen, and John saw Sherlock and Harry’s final moments in the Arena playing itself over and over again. His heart quickened, but he fought to act as if he hadn’t noticed.
After their fingers were pricked and their blood was recorded in the book, the four of them walked into the center square of District 12. Everyone’s eyes were on them – Sherlock didn’t need to look to know that. He kept his eyes straight ahead, on the glass bowl on the stage that had one singular slip of paper inside – his name. Harry grasped onto Sherlock’s hand, and he glanced over to see that her and John were also holding hands, so he reached over and held Mycroft’s hand, too – showing the Capitol that, despite everything, they were still a family.
Harry patted Sherlock’s shoulder as she passed, but that was the only form of comfort she gave him – probably for the sake of who was watching them. And then, he was alone on the stage, with President Dean Bainbridge and an (obviously cleared) assistant with a syringe quickly approaching him.
“Sherlock –” John breathed, and it was something in Sherlock’s eyes – his eyes were always exhausted and sad, these days, but upon seeing the article, there was a resigned look to them that hadn’t been there, before – that set John off.
The letter that Mycroft had left behind for Sherlock had laid in the back of Sherlock’s mind almost like the physical entity laid in the bottom of the strongbox in Sherlock’s room, untouched for months, but Sherlock was always acutely aware of its existence. When he first received the letter, he had decided he would read it when he could stand to think about Mycroft’s death for more than five minutes without needing a hit of morphling. When he was finally completely sober and was able to fully cope with Mycroft’s death, found other excuses – he didn’t know how long he would need to read through the whole thing in one sitting, and there were always other things for him to do. Once the concept of moving Districts was talked about and then put into motion, however, Sherlock knew that he had to read it before they left.
Harry Watson nearly launched herself into John’s arms, and he picked her up, just as they had done as kids. Once she was back on the ground, she tucked her face into his shoulder, and he tucked his face into hers. The hug felt like it went on for hours, but when they finally did let go of one another, Harry waved an anxious Sherlock over, and he joined them, making it a proper reunion.
“Thanks dad, bye dad!” John was still practically shouting, basically pushing his prep team down the hall.
“We did. The remaining Peacekeepers surrendered about half an hour ago. We’ve been regrouping since then.”
“Just take it you little shit,” he said, and Sherlock allowed John to place it in his hand. “Come here,” he murmured, and hugged his boyfriend, just as the Peacekeepers came in to announce their three minutes had passed.
“It is hard to say right now; I’d rather bet on the outcome of a coin toss than on your brother’s life, for instance.”
“Not yet,” Alexander said, taking a pistol out of his uniform’s holster. “Do you know how to use that thing, John?” he asked, nodding to the rifle that was still in John’s hand – the one that he had wrestled away from a Peacekeeper in the fray – the one he had used to save Sherlock from Seneca Crane –
“You’re going to have to learn a better poker face, then – both of you,” Mycroft said. “As soon as sex is mentioned John’s face goes as red as a tomato while Sherlock looks positively terrified –”
“I’m sure you’re all wondering how we’re going to go about this – how the true victor will be decided upon,” Caesar went on once the noise died down, speaking half to the audience, and half to Sherlock and Harry. “After a long discussion between President Snow, Seneca Crane, and the other Gamemakers that were involved in the making of this year’s Hunger Games, a conclusion that they feel will be in the best interest of everyone involved has been reached.” He reached into the inside pocket his stupid glittering, violet blazer and pulled out an envelope.
“But we don’t have any extra – oh –” Sherlock cut himself off as he suddenly realized John’s solution.
“Of course, time is something of which we don’t have an infinite supply...” Mycroft mumbled, and Sherlock replied by flipping him off.
Even more surprising than that, however, were the moments when Sherlock would act completely unlike himself, when he was more active and more sociable than he ever had been before. At times (that John couldn’t predict if he was paid to do so), Sherlock, who was known for being easily the most antisocial person in District 12, would offer to go run to the busiest parts of the District for errands, or tag along with Harry when she walked to school or with John for his walk to work. Not to mention the fact that, for a person who, before the Games, would sometimes go days without speaking, Sherlock never missed any of the daily phone calls from Dean. At first, John and Harry’s confusion was so strong it was almost a tangible object within the house, but, after a while, they got used to it, just like they got used to everything else. If this was Sherlock’s way of trying to get better – if this was his way of coping – then they accepted it.
In the same instant, a lilac fire set them aflame. John immediately took a step forward, and Cinna caught him by the shoulder.
Snow didn’t crown Sherlock and Harry as winners of the Hunger Games last night at the recap ceremony.
“No,” Sherlock said quickly, looking up at Dean. “I have to do this. If I don’t do it now…” he trailed off, but both of them knew the end of his sentence without him having to say it:
John could feel bile building in the back of his throat, but he chanced at glance at his sister and his boyfriend.
“Mycroft Holmes. It’s so nice to see you again,” Hannibal said, holding his hand out for Mycroft to shake.
She then took his hand and pulled him aside, into the hallway, with a pair of double doors to separate them from the rest of the group.
Swallowing the lump in his throat, Mycroft placed his hand on John’s shoulder and addressed the next important part of John’s escape.
“Yes,” he said, quietly. “Apparently Moriarty and Hannibal both think that I’m just like them – or I have the potential to be.”
John glanced behind him, making sure Harry was still with them – in her dress that matched her hair, barefoot, and weeping quietly as she ran behind them.
“Because somebody has to swallow the fly,” Sherlock replied, and Harry flipped him off. “Just come on, Harry; I’ll –”
“You know what I mean,” Sherlock deadpanned, side-eyeing his boyfriend. “I…I’m trying to get better and get over everything, but then I go out into public and I see… I didn’t have to think about it as much, when I was high. I saw it and it registered but I didn’t have to dwell on it. It was easy to ignore it – what they were thinking. But now…” he trailed off for a second. “And it doesn’t help that he’s all I see, here,” he whispered, staring ahead, his hand steadily squeezing John’s, now. “When I’d run off, I…I figured out that there isn’t a single place that doesn’t remind me of him. But I feel like if I was somewhere else – in another District, maybe – maybe I wouldn’t feel like he was everywhere, as much.”
“Yes, yes, thank you Harriet, but if you don’t mind I’m sort of busy at the moment, so if you and John would please see yourselves out I would appreciate it.”
This was all just smoke and mirrors and Capitol computers, and Sherlock knew it. He knew it he knew it he knew it –
It didn’t make sense – he had seen dead bodies, before – it wasn’t like he didn’t watch people die every year for sport. He had even killed people, himself, creating dead bodies in the Arena. He had even seen Mycroft die.
From Constantly, chapter 68: "There were times when he begged John to get him some Morphling – he even gave John the name, address, and physical description of the man he had been getting it from – but John refused every time (he did, however, find the man and sprained his arm in the effort to ensure that he would never supply Sherlock with even a drop of Morphling ever again)."
He set his bundle of clothes next to the box of Morphling on the sink and turned the faucet off. After staring at the tub for a moment, watching the steam of the hot water rise, and then stripped off the sheet from John’s room, and stepped into the tub, sending even more water over the edge and spilling onto the floor.
done with Magnussen and with the Hunger Games and with the Capitol controlling his every move. He practically roared as he ran, and was unsure if he was shouting wordlessly at Magnussen, or shouting a warning for Harry to run. But, in the end, as he crashed into Magnussen, knocking the curved knife out of his hand, and sent them both tumbling to the ground, it didn’t matter.
was a kiss. But what Charles Augustus Magnussen did, shoving his mouth onto his, pushing his tongue inside of his mouth and making sure to cover every inch of it with his saliva – that was an invasion.
“Mycroft!” Sherlock exclaimed before his brother could say another word, and threw his arms around his neck. He didn’t care that neither of them were people anywhere near interested in physical contact – he had won the Games; this was a cause for celebration.
In fact, everyone he knew had either lost a brother or a sister within the last five days – everyone, that is, except for him.
It was at times like these where Sherlock was reminded of the final article that Kitty Riley had ever written – an article that Sherlock had refused to read at first, until years later, when he finally felt as if whatever she had to say could not hurt him:
And then Magnussen’s body fell forward, landing at Sherlock’s feet, his blood beginning to flow onto his boots
“Yeah – yeah. I just had to take care of something,” he replied, and his eyes flashed to Sherlock’s, just for a second, as he spoke, and he knew that he shouldn’t have as soon as he did.
And then he saw another cake, and ABC cake came out in a heart-shaped stream from his eye sockets like a play-doh toy.
And Sherlock could tell simply by the man’s gait that he had no intention of going easy on John Watson.
“Hey,” John said, waving. “Have any of you seen Sherlock Holmes?” he asked, and a part of him was about to go into detail of what Sherlock looked like, but he then realized that literally everyone in Panem – including these three kids – knew exactly what Sherlock looked like.
The moment Harry and Sherlock boarded the train, John closed the distance between them and hugged them both. In less than a month, either Sherlock would be alive, Harry would be alive, or they both would be dead, and there was no way John could ever prepare himself for it.
“John couldn’t sleep, either,” Finn reported. John looked at him, puzzled, and he smiled sheepishly back at him. “I could hear you muttering to yourself from my room.”
” Mycroft replied. “Anyway, we all got a taste of those rumors thanks to Octavia back at the Watson’s home. Do either of you have any idea as to what to do about these rumors?”
John’s head tilted slightly to the side before he could catch himself. Unfortunately, Snow picked up on it.
Mycroft looked back at his friends and family with a look of “I told you so,” and Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“All I’m asking is for you to think about it,” Hannibal insisted, but before Sherlock could insist that he wouldn’t, Hannibal then checked the watch around his wrist. “I shouldn’t keep you talking; you need your rest, after all. Get some sleep, Will, and think about what I said.”
“I want you to see something,” John replied, and that’s all he said until he got to the doors of the last train car. “Here we are,” he said, opening the doors. “Look.”
“I’m sure you can go find yourself a cake to devour,” Sherlock said. “Or try something new; like working out. I’m sure you could get a treadmill in here; they got
If he didn’t start talking – if he didn’t figure it out – Magnussen would spill Harry’s guts, literally, and then he’d kill Sherlock, too.
“No, let me show you –” he started, reaching out to turn her back around – to put himself up against her – to breathe into her neck –
“John –” she began, but John was already on his knees, bringing his sister into his arms. “I’m sorry – I’m sorry –”
“Well, my brother is now not only a threat to other tributes but he’s also a huge target – especially to Charles Augustus Magnussen. So, I think the first world I would use is...devastated.”
“On the third day of training before the Hunger Games, Sherlock had broken out of training, and it was up to me and Mycroft to find him and bring him back to Atala.”
They walked through the hallway as hands reached out for them, grabbing onto their clothes if they got too close. Mycroft led the way, and Lavinia held onto his arm from behind him, and he could feel the quakes of her body travel through his own. Setting his jaw, he stopped thinking about how some of the voices contained words while others did not and why that was and pressed on.
Sherlock Holmes stood alone in the park that used to be the Training Center in the Capitol for the first time in years, in front of the memorial of the Battle for Panem. He stood in front of the statue of Mycroft Holmes, seeing it for only the second time since it was erected.
“Well, I’ve made my choice – I’ve chosen you. And I’ll choose you over myself again and again until the moment I die.”
If you were looking to read other things by me, I just posted a whole bunch of fics (mostly crack fics) that I wrote when I was between the ages of 16 and 21. There are three in particular that have MULTIPLE CHAPTERS (all of them Harry Potter, 2/3 of which are crack fics) that I'm going to post like every other Saturday, so if you WANTED to read something of mine while you waited for me to get my Constantly shit together, you can read those fics and look at what went on in my mind between 7 and almost 3 years ago! Because, you know. That's always interesting. ESPECIALLY when its the crack fics....
– and so John knew what Sherlock was going to say when he finally parted, with Sherlock looking into John’s eyes as if they were his only source of relief.
Surprisingly, John found that he wasn’t mad. He was mad – in the beginning, when he first found the stash, he was livid – but not anymore. In fact, he didn’t really feel anything. He felt as if his guts and emotions – everything inside of him – had been scooped up and out of him and discarded somewhere inside the house.
After Mycroft’s Games, Sherlock slept in Mycroft’s room – in Mycroft’s bed – with his brother every night for about a year, but once Sherlock started consistently sleeping in his own bed again, Mycroft’s room quickly became off-limits. For the past eight years, Sherlock had never set foot in his brother’s room.
Even Harry could tell. As soon as she came back from showing off for the Gamemakers, she sat next to John and asked him if he was okay.
Before, just after returning from the Battle For Panem, the Holmes’ residence smelled like Mycroft Holmes, like soap made of goat’s milk and something warm and comforting that Sherlock could never name mixed with the very faint scent of cigarettes. Now, it had a much different smell – expensive soaps and wine and gourmet cooking and booze and morphling and sorrow – and Sherlock hated it.
Charles Augustus grinned, stepped away from John, dropped his cigarette, stepped on it, and then looked back up at John.
At the sound of his brother’s name, Sherlock snapped his eyes shut and grit his teeth together, fresh tears falling down his cheeks, as if hearing it again – here, in this context – was only just opening a fresh wound.
“Everything’s fine – it’s gonna be okay –” Sherlock heard himself saying – trying to convince his brother – trying to convince
Hamish’s first name was the easiest part of naming their first child. Sherlock always loved John’s middle name, and though John hated it, he could possibly learn to love it when attached to a person who he loved. The middle names, though – for both of their children – were a bit harder, Hamish’s especially. They had thought about it for months, having various conversations about what it could possibly be, until finally John approached Sherlock.
“Harry, no – STOP!” Sherlock yelled, and finally Harry stood still, still glaring up at Sherlock. He had seen Harry angry plenty of times over the years, but never like this.
“Of course it does – everybody dies,” Mycroft said with a shrug. “It’s the one thing human beings can be relied upon to do. How can it still come as a surprise to people?”
“I’m fine – bored as hell, but fine. You?” she asked, putting her tray back on its rolling table and pushing it away.
“I thought you’d like to see it,” John said quietly from behind him, coming up beside him and holding his hand. “Since you wouldn’t get to, again.”
For the first person, at least, the three kids only asked questions that they forgot as soon as they asked them, and marking down where he belonged with no reasons as to why written in the comment box, until Hannibal Lecter Magnussen’s turn came around.
“I know – I know they did,” Mycroft replied, his eyes also wet with tears. “We have to go back to the Circle – we have to make statements – Can you handle that, John?”
“I’ll ask Hal,” Dean replied, and then noticed Sherlock’s apparent confusion. “Hal Packard, from District Three,” he clarified, and Sherlock guessed that that was one of the men who Dean put to operating the camera, since members of District 3 would know about those things the best.
The next person John recognized from District 2: thirty-year-old Antonia Blake. She leaned back in her chair, watching Mycroft with her arms crossed, black and blue hair draped over her face. When it got to be her turn, she looked at John.
“Exactly,” Dean said, nodding. “If they thought you knew something – anything – they’d try to torture the information out of you. But Mycroft knew that if you didn’t know anything then you’d be safe. Not to mention…” and at once, Dean stopped himself, trailing off.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” Louise said, putting out her hand for Harry to shake. “Do you prefer Harriet or Harry?”
“It’s...it’s okay,” Sherlock murmured. “You...you did okay,” he said, louder, and Mycroft chuckled, shaking his head. “You were great.”
Caesar Flickerman interviews each team of siblings before the Games; Sherlock and John take their relationship to the next step, one last time.
“Really, I just want to know how many people he’s eaten,” Harry said, looking to her other hand. “I’m thinking that if he can’t give an actual number under the serum it’ll mean that he cannibalized so many people he literally
If you'll remember in Chapter 46 of Constantly (Regrouping and Reunion), Antonia Blake leads Alexander Waters, Sherlock, John, and Harry to Caesar's studio/theater/thing, where Dean is speaking to Alma Coin by the stage, and John specifically points out in his narrative that "Dean had already resigned himself to the fact that Mycroft was gone without seconds of his arrival." Basically, the scene was going to tackle this, starting just before Sherlock and the others enter the room.
“Yeah, Mycroft mentioned that, once or twice. I don’t think anyone’s ever been ‘good’ with humans,” Lindsay said, shrugging. “You and your brother are good at things you can learn, things you can study and practice and perfect, but…you can’t do any of that with people. No one can – I can’t say I’m ‘good’ with Daniel or I was ‘good’ with Mycroft or my own parents, when they were alive. You two look for a formula where there is none. With humans, you just…are. There’s no improving, there’s no answers. But that’s when you find people, the people who you want to be around and who want to be around you. That’s the closest thing you can get to being ‘good’ with humans – when you find the people who love you.”
Sending a silent apology Sherlock’s way, Harry took her hands from Sherlock’s chest, closed her eyes and fell, careful to conceal her unwounded arm and the dart itself, trying so hard to keep her body from shuddering – to stop herself from sobbing.
Sherlock removed the sword from the tribute’s torso and the tribute gripped his wound with his free hand, taking another swing at Sherlock.
“It’s okay, it’s alright now,” Mycroft tried to assure him, giving his shoulder a reassuring squeeze. But it wasn’t – it wasn’t okay. But before he could voice this, Mycroft went on. “Honestly, it could’ve been much worse.”
Even though Sherlock had found out what he had been thinking about that night specifically eight days later – in the Arena.
Sherlock and Harry continue their training sessions; Charles Augustus Magnussen tries to talk to Harry.
“He’s not made of rocks – this is just a statue. It’s a rock that was made to look like him,” Sherlock explained. Dean had insisted upon the statue in the middle of the park he had decided to make in the place of the old training center, after tearing the building down a year after the disbanding of the Hunger Games. Sherlock had insisted upon the quote on the plaque that was attached to the statue’s mount, underneath Mycroft’s name, birth date, and date of death: “
family for someone who has always been rude to those who care about him most, and decided that doing what he did was actually a smart thing to do.” He shook his head sadly. “Yes, it would be such a shame to see the Watson family lose such a
However, just before John was supposed to leave, he took one look at Sherlock, and then turned to Harry.
“No way,” John said as he let go of her and she and Sherlock took their place in their chariot. “We’d get into
“Don’t touch the boyfriend – got it. Sorry,” she said, and though she was sarcastic he could tell the apology was sincere.
“Mycroft,” Sherlock muttered under his breath – his brother always hated people calling him Myc, but it was the best Hamish could do for now, and that was fine. He just didn’t want Hamish to think Myc was the extent of his name.
Sherlock did what Mycroft had done so many years ago, when he had wanted to speak directly to Sherlock during his first interview with Caesar Flickerman: he picked a camera, and spoke into it, as if he was speaking directly to John.
“He wanted me to be his friend,” Sherlock revealed, pulling his hand from his face to look at his two friends – gauging their reactions.
“I wonder why John didn’t mention that – the whole adrenaline, loss-of-adrenaline thing,” he said, lazily waving his free hand in the air.
“A moment,” he muttered in response, and exited the room. He strode down the now-empty cell-filled hallway, and back to the laboratory. He walked straight to the Peacekeeper, and crouched in front of him, grabbing him by the collar of his uniform, getting in his face.
The City Circle was packed by the time John and Mycroft returned – there were so many people it was difficult to move through the crowd, but all of Mycroft’s friends were waiting for them near the entrance of the training center.
He wanted to give him a fond memory to look back upon – he had planned on sleeping with John that night since he found out he would be going into the Arena. In fact, he probably had the lube in the nightstand drawer in his room – the condoms in his pocket – the thought in his head – as Caesar conducted their interviews.
The member of the prep team who was working on Sherlock’s face stepped back, giving him a moment to reply before moving in to touch up on the eyeshadow on his right eyelid.
And Mycroft was. He would’ve given anything to follow Louise down to where Clover was waiting for him, relieve her of her duty, and continue his search for John. However, if he did that, or not even make an appearance in the penthouse at all, it would look entirely too suspicious, and set Sherlock’s brain in motion, alerting him that something was awry.
