He heard John’s quiet voice near his ear. “If we were equals, there wouldn’t be any reason for you to keep me.”
They sat together like that for a long time, before ultimately continuing on their journey, King John at the reins, and his servant leaning on him at his side.
Sherlock loved new experiences. Would he enjoy the novelty of making love in an orchard? Perhaps it would seem romantic to him, to be surrounded by the flourishing trees and fragrant fruit. John longed to fill his beloved with new and wonderful feelings of romance, as he filled Sherlock’s soft body.
William clung to the possibility that none of this was true. “You presume to know much about him, Lestrade.” Even if the priest had spent some company with Montgomery, it was difficult to imagine anything more than a few words awkwardly exchanged. “He couldn’t have confessed any of this to you.”
Sherlock shuddered under his touch, and made a soft, pleasant hum. “Sir… There are limits, though, aren’t there? Even if your plan succeeds. I am a servant. You are a king.” Sherlock sighed sadly. “There are limits.”
“Well, yeah, the body of the thing is wood, but that’s not the important part, now is it? He looked at John and the cross in his hands, and he knew then it was something you made for me. I don’t fully understand it myself, but I think he was as touched as I was.” Lestrade smiled. “He asked me to come thank you.”
King John studied the servant for a moment, probably wondering why Sherlock was acting so nervous. He marched over to the closest books, and pulled one at random. “Chemistry. Does that sound interesting to you, Sherlock?”
He was gratified by John’s awed gaze. “It’s beautiful,” he said. The intricate designs had taken some time to craft. It had been marvellous to exert his focus into the task, as he rarely had the opportunity to simply sit and carve. “Incredible, m’lord.”
That was what he told himself, at any rate, as he tried hard not to think about the fact that soon, he would be sleeping in the same enclosed space as a certain handsome king.
Somehow, learning about Mycroft’s cross-dressing had paved the way for them to finally talk about the past. It was just odd enough that it suited them. “It wasn’t a good reason to make me king,” Sherlock admitted. “It was obvious that your strategy won the war, not some injudicious prince charging blindly into the fray.” He had a serious question to ask Mycroft. “If you would like to be king again…”
In John’s opinion, the devastatingly gorgeous and brilliant servant deserved more respect and awe than even his master had received. Although, perhaps it was good in one way that they did not notice Sherlock; if one of them looked at the fair-skinned, dark-haired beauty for more than an instant, the king would likely find himself with a competitor for Sherlock’s affections.
So you both have come together then. As I knew you would. My machinations have succeeded after all, is that not so, Mycroft?
“If you insist,” Sherlock said, and he stood up from his seat to kneel on the floor, touching the spot where John’s trousers met his shoes.
John shuddered, and the reaction was not caused by a pleasant sensation this time. “No, I don’t want that.”
Suddenly, Sherlock stood back up again. “Your arm, if you please.” He took hold of John’s right arm, which had been willingly if unenthusiastically offered. He lifted the plain sleeve up. Again, Sherlock sniffed, his nose almost touching John’s skin, the end of his scarf falling onto the shorter man’s lap.
John lost himself in watching his bewitching servant enjoy the activity, though he came back to reality when Sherlock approached him, having collected many apples. “The basket is heavy now,” his servant said meekly. “We can go back.”
“Oh, Sherlock,” Lestrade managed cheerily, recovering his breath, “you’re really going to regret this.”
It was not due to the competition itself, but a servant that the king met during the event. In the middle of the tournament, the king had wanted to take a look at the lance he was going to use for the final contest, the joust. He found the storage room where the weapons were kept, and inside the room, he saw a fair-skinned, dark-haired, slender figure, who had looked all the more delicate against the sword that he had been cleaning.
A glance was shared between them, a brief reminder that this day had not been an illusion, that they were brothers for good, and then they each returned to their own quiet corner of castle.
It was ludicrous, how often he had to apologize for his inappropriate behaviour. Sherlock was not fit to speak to a king. He had long been subservient to nobles, but it seemed that he would never learn how to speak to them correctly, as their subordinate.
When Sherlock said this, the handsome king eyed him with such attention that Sherlock had to avert his eyes in shyness.
His true self, as John well knew, was a bored troublemaker who would crawl through mud to study the footprints of interesting merchants. Yet John still treated him with the same deference as if he were king.
If the clothes met with even an ounce of William’s approval, then the servant felt better after all. He decided he would keep the clothes he had received.
After placing the candle carefully on the table, Sherlock dutifully knelt to remove the king’s boots, trying very hard not to think about how close he was to King John’s solid chest and powerful arms. There was something comforting about the king’s scent, though it also excited Sherlock more than he could explain.
John opened his eyes, confused, because he did not remember closing them, and flustered, on account of his unrelenting imagination.
“Yes, and there’s more than that, depending on how much the horse is taught. The thing is that every walking speed gets a different command, though you really don’t need to know that, since a horse is hardly going to be racing when pulling a caravan. I hope it helps to understand the horse a little more, though?” King John reached forward and patted the creature, which didn’t seem to care all that much.
“That I do. I will see you around the castle, then.” With one last encouraging smile, Father Lestrade left them. It occurred to John that Lestrade oversaw sermons and confessions in the castle. Maybe he was going to hear more confessions at this moment. How much that man must know that he couldn’t share with the new servant!
The door opened, and I opened my mouth to say hi to my pal Bertie—but it was Jeeves, no more expressive than his plain black suit.
The king considered waiting a long time before bringing up his plan for the tournament, yet there was an advantage to posing the plan sooner. Public sentiment was on his side for the moment, and they were celebrating him for a tournament, of all things. It might not seem so strange to them that their king, who had found such success in a tournament, would wish to host one of his own, and for stakes that would have the whole kingdom chattering with excitement.
It was hard to accept that his lovely Sherlock would condone the ludicrous possessiveness that had risen in the king. Too smitten to be as discreet as he ought to be in case any of the nobles or soldiers returned, John pulled Sherlock’s head closer.
Once I remembered who Mr. Wooster was, I couldn’t help but think that I hadn’t been that helpful. If anything, it was Bertie who was doing a lot to help me cope with my own unhappy situation. That was why he had starting sitting with me, to begin with.
John had taken part in his fair share of military campaigns and conflicts over the years. He had known many enemies on the battlefield. There had also been many allies, as well.
A barmaid came to ask him what he would have. Acting with more confidence than he truly had at the moment, Sherlock told her that he had a friend coming soon, and they would each appreciate a dark, frothy mug. He chose the finest of their ales. While nobody unfamiliar with the castle would spot the king in his plain coat, he was still a gentleman, albeit one quirky enough to find company amongst farmers and craftsmen. In any case, there were more than a few men of high station seeking a night of genuine enjoyment in the establishment. Sherlock Holmes did not seem out of place.
“In any case, I know the forest well. The convoy will be stopped here for a while, so we should be able to take a short walk.”
“Prince Montgomery… Pardon me if I say so, but something came over him. I know because he reached for his umbrella before he stood, and that’s a rare thing.”
There came a day when William had to leave for town on business, and he made it clear that a simple servant was not needed. Sad that he could not follow his master outside of the castle walls, John obediently stayed in the castle nonetheless. It was nice to find that he could now navigate the labyrinthine halls with ease, at least to reach the rooms he cared to use.
“It means that you will be his personal servant,” Lestrade told him. Though Lestrade was respectful, the servant rolled his eyes. John blushed, angry with himself for looking like an uneducated peasant. “I believe King William is expecting us?”
“I never thought there could be so many apples in one place,” Sherlock commented, full of enthusiasm, reaching for another piece of fruit. “Imagine all the things they could be used for.”
Now that John had admitted his love for Sherlock, he found it more difficult than ever to spend even a single moment away from his dear servant. He kept very near to Sherlock as they explored more of the art festival together. The king wanted to always stand by his servant, to guide him through this foreign city and to be able to protect him at moment’s notice.
“I have no right to keep you from other people. Yet I couldn’t bear it when they looked at you like they did. I wanted to take you in my arms and kiss you in front of everyone. I can’t do that, and it pains me like nothing else, Sherlock.”
If he held with him the memory of a broad-shouldered king with a commanding voice and caring eyes, then that was his own business.
King John’s smile had vanished. In its place had come an unhappy, brooding grimace. The king seemed to be thinking about something, and his thoughts could not have been happy ones.
Once Sherlock was equipped with everything he needed, he raised the violin once more, and entered into a kind of beautiful frenzy. He played the instrument for much of the day, to the delight of many visitors and artists at the festival.
Though Sherlock was embarrassed to be unclothed under the attractive body of his master, the reverent way in which the king looked at him gave Sherlock the encouragement he needed.
William said nothing more. He kept walking. Silently, John followed him, ashamed for having upset his master.
For a moment I was stunned, but I’d been in much stranger places than this, and before long I was marching up to the desk. It wouldn’t have shocked me if the man at the computer had given me a hesitant look, given my simple getup of plaid and jeans. Fortunately, the man at the computer didn’t seem to notice. He was nice enough to me when I asked which way Bertie Wooster was. Mentioning that he’d been informed that Mr. Wooster was expecting a guest, he told me to head over to apartment 3A.
“Don’t worry, Sherlock,” he crooned softly. “I do want you. Terribly. But there’s something special that I want to do with you, tonight, if the idea appeals to you.”
“I wish we could do this more often.” Then it occurred to John, why William may not have ventured outside with him before. “Now that I have new clothes, perhaps, we could take more walks?”
As he reached for the chair across from me, the strange man cried, “Oh!” and faced me again. “I have forgotten to introduce myself! Awfully inconsiderate of me.” He thrust his hand forward. “I’m Bertie.”
A sudden melancholy settled on Sherlock’s features. “We all have our duties.” He stood up from the pew. “It has been a pleasure, but I think I’ve been here too long.”
“I thought he was unintelligent,” Sherlock remarked offhandedly, but at John’s glare he quickly added, “However, I learned better. It was only that he thought himself to be unintelligent.”
Filled with strong feelings that made his body warm and his heart even warmer, John paused long enough to answer him. “It’s me. I’ll always be here for you, Sherlock,” he said, and then took William in his mouth again, rising and falling, as encouraging as he could be.
“I am very interested in hearing more.” William stepped closer and placed his hands on John’s shoulders. The king’s heart stuttered when he saw the awe in his servant’s eyes. He wanted John to know how treasured he was.
I took a deep breath, taking one long look around the café, and then closed my laptop, preparing to head home to Baker Street.
Sherlock was staring at John in fascination and wonder. It was an expression that John never tired of seeing on his servant’s face. “Do you mean that?”
“There is nothing to be said.” William’s voice sounded lifeless to his own ears. “Nothing at all,” he muttered, and now all he heard was bitterness.
Oh, but it was so terribly hard to think, when Sherlock cuddled his knee like that. His mind filled with thoughts of keeping Sherlock in this room, and keeping him happy here. Perhaps Sherlock wanted intimate attention, after seeing to his master in such a fashion?
Dumbfounded by this praise, Sherlock tried to fathom how a man of the world could find beauty in this simple servant. “In the dim light, perhaps…”
It was true that they were leaving their secret garden behind, yet John knew that they would have their privacy again in the royal caravan, that vehicle that had been their home throughout this journey. John would get dressed in the loose, sleeveless shirt and trousers he slept in, and Sherlock would wear his cute sleeping gown and bonnet, and after a long day of walking through the woods, they would fall soundly asleep, Sherlock’s body under John’s solid arm, and John’s cheek against Sherlock’s dark curls.
Keeping his voice steady, John continued, “Forget about the book for now. Your old rivalry with your brother can wait. We’re here to have a nice date, and that’s exactly what we’re going to do. So please sit down.”
Once the king had left to see to his business with the mayor, Sherlock knew that he would not be asking any of the library keepers for help. He feared that they would think he was a lowly, inept servant who could not possibly be fit to serve a splendid individual like King John. They would be right, but Sherlock still preferred not to be judged that way by strangers.
It was astounding to Sherlock to see someone so casually pet a beast such as that large horse. Sherlock hesitated. “Yes, sir,” he managed. He didn’t want to admit that he continued to fear the horse, so he didn’t say anything more.
There was another, more unfortunate difference between the king and their surroundings. While the flowers seemed vibrant and happy, the king was clearly distressed. His eyes were shut, as if in concentration, and his arms were tightly crossed.
“Sherlock Holmes!” At once, Bertie was grinning again. “Of course! I read about one or two of his cases. Gripping stuff! I’ve always loved a good mystery. I didn’t know there was someone blogging about him. I’ll have to read it all!” Bertie snapped a photo of the screen with his mobile. “If that’s all right with you?”
His precious servant laughed, a pure and charming sound that seemed a lot like lovely birdsong in this forest. “Thank you, sir. What is your plan?”
So much of John was filling him, joining with him, and yet it wasn’t enough. “Oh, yes, John, more, please, harder…”
A little flame burst inside William’s chest. Oh, to be the man who could throw royal propriety to the wind and sniff whatever part of John that John allowed him to! He was not Sherlock, but it was hard for William to care about that at this moment. The king dropped to his knees, and lifted one of John’s feet, enjoying how John touched him to keep balance.
But the second his fingers made contact with Sherlock’s skin, the detective’s eyes snapped open and the hand that he probably
Even with morphine pumping through his bloodstream to the point where he forgot how to speak English, he could recognize John. Suddenly Greg felt as though he was intruding on something private.
“If you’re so bloody good at it, why don’t you do it every time?” says John bitterly, dragging himself from the floor and back into his armchair.
“Sherlock,” John interrupted firmly, disregarding Greg’s confusion. “You need to let go or else they’re going to have to redo your IV.”
That’s why he and Donovan come bursting through the door to 221B Baker St at 10:30 p.m., Greg loudly announcing their entrance with an exuberant, “ALRIGHT, GENTS, EXPLAIN YOURSELVES!”
Sherlock shifts the noisy bundle so he can cradle the infant’s head and shakes his own, continuing to bounce. “Best not,” he says, “you’ve got a cold coming on and he’ll be able to hear it in your lungs; he’ll go faster if he just has my heartbeat.”
Sherlock’s eyes were closed in sleep, and were it not for the rise and fall of his bandaged chest he would have looked dead. Even so, the bareness of that chest only emphasized the outline of his protruding ribs, looking about to break the skin with each inhale. And he was so sodding pale, was he meant to be that pale? He’d been pasty before, but now even in the dim light Greg could see the grey tinge his skin had taken on, a sign of the strain his body was under trying to piece itself back together.
John checked Sherlock’s wrists where the IV drip was plugged in and nodded, satisfied that he hadn’t done any damage. Then he gave Greg a grim little smile,
But when he caught sight of the man strewn limply across the bed within, he’d never been more sober in his life.
And when Greg thinks about that twenty-something-year-old drug addict who he kicked off his crime scenes for showing up high and then looks at this man—this exhausted, in love, deliriously happy man…no, he doesn’t fucking cry, you twat, there’s something in his eye, alright?
John shrugged. “Didn’t quite sound like it,” he said, “but Eastern European, yeah. You know Sherlock, he speaks pretty much everything.”
“Quite contrary,” Sherlock replied, clearly struggling to remain alert even as he sagged back against the pillows. “Quite contrary,” he repeated, closing his eyes.
He couldn’t. Not when the man who’d jumped off a bloody roof for him was laying gutshot in a hospital bed. Not when the drug-induced haze was most likely the only thing keeping him from being in what would probably be excruciating pain. Sherlock had never been the most considerate person out there, but that was a new level of cruelty that Greg didn’t quite want to reach.
” Sherlock insisted a third time, as though the first two repetitions had gone unheard, “it’s…it’s…”
“Oh, probably just babbling,” John waved a hand as though to dismiss it. “Not the first time he’s said that, but I guess we’ll have to wait for an explanation when he’s more lucid.” He smiled amiably, as though his best friend hadn’t just had a small breakdown.
“Forty-five minutes,” John’s groan is muffle d by his hands, “forty-five minutes to get him down! I was ready to bloody bribe him!”
But Sherlock didn’t let go; in fact, he seemed to tighten his grip and even pushed back against the doctor’s attempts to get him to lie back down, lips twitching in an effort to form words with which his brain would not supply him. It was a picture of utter confusion, frustration, almost desperation—and it looked so foreign on Sherlock’s face that for a moment he almost looked like a completely different entity. And Greg had wanted to bloody film it.
“No use,” Sherlock dismisses him, “you’re here now. It takes John ages to get him down but this shouldn’t take long.”
“Oh, they probably won’t allow you to use that,” John warned as he readied the camera on his mobile.
Greg cleared his throat. “Was that Russian, or what?” he asked, remembering the threatening tone with which Sherlock had spoken.
Greg nodded, but it didn’t sit right with him. None of this did. “And the whole ‘quite contrary’ bit, any idea what that was about?”
“Um, if it’s all right with you. And this time, sir, don’t hold back.” As had sometimes happened before, the courage that Sherlock had briefly been able to summon was already dissipating. Staring down at the floor, Sherlock mumbled, “I want to swallow your seed, sir. Maybe then I can give you the baby you want, somehow.”
Sherlock wished he had a magic spell that would ease John’s worries. He tried to recall when John had called him only by his name. There were moments of passion, when John had been too beautifully overwhelmed to monitor himself, and then, there had been the other place. “There was a time when you called me Sherlock. At least, when I reminded you to.”
Though he wanted to give his appreciation for the king’s generous praise, Sherlock was too stunned by the outpouring of the king’s emotions to interrupt.
John expected to feel like a new man when he donned his new clothes. These quality garments would show that he was the attendant of an important master, and would at last allow him to belong in King William’s presence.
Nodding, Sherlock touched John’s trousers. “I liked what we did at the fortress, sir,” he murmured. “Maybe when I get good at taking you like this, you can tie me up while I do it? You could satisfy yourself with my mouth while I’m bound for you.”
“He couldn’t stay with me all the time, but then I could carve something inspired by his story, knowing that he would know its name. Oh, my healer had treated me and generously shared his time with me, comforting a common soldier with his gentle tone. He did not know I was a nobleman, and still he cared so much for me. It was my pleasure to thank that kind man with a gift.”
“He made her his own where gods would see, so even they would know that she was his.” He gripped the edge of Sherlock’s tunic, and removed it from the servant’s pliant body. “I never understood how a man could have such feelings, until I met you.”
John was certain that he entertained fantasies like this far too often—they’d not diminished over time, as he had once hoped they would, and certainly not after one or two evenings spent with Sherlock—but that guilt wasn’t ever enough to impede his imagination.
This all sounded great, but throughout his speech I’d noticed that the tune playing softly in the background was familiar. “Sherlock, is that Lady Gaga?”
This lavish vehicle, this place worthy of dreams, was like an elegant little home for the two of them to share, and now inside of it, King John was joining intimately with Sherlock on the bed, as if they were married.
Well… I do not know where he is, but if you have an appointment with him, he should be here shortly. I smell tobacco smoke; he was probably here recently. I’m sure he stepped out only for an instant.
William began to whisper near John’s neck, as he caressed John’s shoulder with his other hand, “There, relax for me, John,” he kissed just below John’s jaw, “that would gratify me so.”
The last thing John felt before he fell asleep was William’s muffled cry against John’s shoulder and a hot, loving release coating the devoted servant between his thighs.
Tentatively, Sherlock tried to cup his hands as best he could for King John, though he still needed his master’s direction. He was grateful for the guidance, and for the privilege to see this enticing side of the king.
“Well, let’s just keep it between us? Lucky you, you’ve got me for a master, and I couldn’t care less. In fact, it works well for me. I don’t have to listen to boring nobles if I have someone to do that for me!”
Before he knew what he was doing, he was sitting in the castle’s chapel. It was well into the evening now, and nobody else was there. He could not remember a time when he had made use of a chapel full of people.
William hesitated, and waited to speak until after the water had filled the bath. “It was generous of you, John, to see to my needs last night, and, in another way, this morning.” John fancied that his master was blushing now, and it was adorable. Was he seeing things or did William just steal a touch of his own soiled underwear, and with a look of appreciation? “But… it is not a necessary part of your employment for me, and I pray it was never seen as such.”
John walked over to where Sherlock was standing, gazing at a painting that depicted a mother holding her baby. “That’s a nice painting,” the king said.
I said this more loudly than I intended, and a couple of people next to us looked our way for a moment. Embarrassed, I adjusted my shirt, and lowered my voice, grumbling a bit.
“I think it’s time we called a carriage, it’s getting late.” Mycroft hurriedly walked to the street to find their transportation. Sherlock followed, laughing at their ridiculous attempt at a brotherly talk.
“Are you nervous, John?” Sherlock asked. He was dressed in the most formal trappings of a king, ready to be committed to his love for life.
One thing, however, had changed. Each night they  were drawn closer to each other. First, they had just held each other through the night. The next evening, John had started to lightly caress Sherlock’s arms and back. During the night Sherlock’s hands had found their way below John’s shirt, caressing his chest and belly.
John and Sherlock had three days to prepare for a sniper shot over roughly 900 meters. John’s task was to master the rifle. Sherlock assisted him with adjusting the aim and provide information about distances, angles and weather conditions. They had to make sure, that the bullet hit its target. Sherlock frantically scribbled calculations and diagrams in a notebook after every try. John made shot after shot, getting acquainted with the rifle. At the end of the third day John was able to hit the target with an accuracy of more than 95 percent. They felt confident, that their plan was going to work.
The train ride was as horrible as John had expected and it made him restless. He tried to nap whenever possible but needed to change trains regularly, so that didn’t work out. And  he also tried to keep out of everybody’s way. The time waiting at stations he spent standing in the shadows. Since all this began, he had stopped shaving. His growing beard helped change his features. He didn’t need to be an approachable doctor now. His gruff appearance kept people away, and that was good.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” he announced loudly. People stopped in the middle of their tasks and heads turned toward him. Greg felt a sense of power. The new position as Superintendent surely gained him some more respect.
When they entered the mansion, Sherlock pulled him along to their bedroom. Before he could open the door, John shoved him against it and kissed him urgently. Their arousals were obvious through several layers of pants and trousers. John was on fire. He knew what he wanted, but he felt unsure. His breathing was heavy and his hands roamed over Sherlock's body.
DI Greg Lestrade stared at photos, files and evidence bags that the forensic team had displayed on the table in a seldom used underground meeting room. The whole material of two separate cases had been put there, to give him a better overview. Two bodies were found yesterday: both victims were male, approximately 20 and 40 years old, and probably homeless. Greg assumed, they were connected and tried to unite the evidence into one case. His higher ups hadn't made the case a high priority. Homeless people weren't their main concern; especially, when other, more pressing cases needed solving. But he still felt the need to at least make the most basic effort here - for humanities sake.
John got comfortable behind the rifle and started to aim. He had a perfect line of sight toward a hotel with big balconies. Sherlock took out his equipment to gather the necessary data for calculating the shot.
Mycroft sat behind a huge desk, papers and files piled high around him. His posture screamed exhaustion. John couldn’t remember if he had ever seen Mycroft in such a state before. Usually the older Holmes always had an impeccable posture. Now Mycroft looked years older and his face was haggard. Stress and worry seemed to find people even in ‘minor positions of the British Government’.
He dismounted the rifle from the table, and packed everything that could be of value into the trunk. With a soft napkin from the gun maintenance kit he wiped down all surfaces he had touched. With some bleach he found in the bathroom he cleaned the sink of his blood. His hoodie was blood soaked, but leaving it behind was no option because of the cold weather and his DNA. He picked up the leather jacket and put it on. It was sufficient to cover the blood stains. He looked at the corpse. There was probably some of his DNA on the sniper's hands. He took the bottle of bleach and poured it over the hands and the corpse for good measure. He remembered all the times, how Sherlock had thrown a fit, when killers used bleach to cover their tracks: crude, but effective.
Sherlock knew his way around in Mycroft's mansion and tugged John along. He used to stay with Mycroft after his first two rehabs. Despite the rivalry the brothers displayed, they once had lived together for more than a year. Sherlock had occupied one of the guest rooms on the ground level toward the garden. Since his last and longest stint of drugs, he never had returned to stay at Mycroft’s again. He had hated the supervision. He had preferred to rent an apartment in Montague Street. But he knew that his brother had always kept his old room ready for him since then. It was his way of showing support and brotherly love. Sherlock never knew, how he should respond to that but felt oddly reassured by that gesture.
He made up his mind to fetch some coffee from the office kitchen. Then he would take a closer look at this case, including a check of the retrieved files from the mobiles.
They were ready to go back on Monday around lunch time. Without any clues about the whereabouts of Moriarty, they could either stay in hiding endlessly or just return to Baker Street. Moriarty no longer had his web, so perhaps he had gone into hiding. Mycroft had taken care of all foreign surveillance on their apartment. He also had proposed a security detail, but John and Sherlock declined. The usual more than standard surveillance over CCTV seemed enough. They wanted their privacy back.
Sherlock lowered himself back beside John. He settled his hand above John's. “John, listen to me. The last months were cruel. We were played. Moriarty tried to isolate us. He used our weak points to his advantage. That is his game. But from now on it's us against the world. I don’t care how close we get, as long as we don’t drift apart anymore. I am sorry for leaving you behind, but I had no choice. Moriarty needed us separated. I want to stay at your side now.  Up to the day we met, I used to be alone. The last two months I was alone again. But in the last two years I realized: together is better. You were right: Friends protect friends.”
Sherlock smiled “I find myself willing to go very far with you. Perhaps not everything at once, but I am very curious, as you should know. And it seem, there is a lot you can show me.”
Molly took a deep breath and started to type. ‘Sherlock asked me to help him. The jump was one of his back-up plans. We never thought he really had to use it. He staged it, I don't know how. I provided a corpse that was similar to him. Then I prepared it accordingly to his instructions. We faked some photographs. I attested his death. I just made sure, nobody came too close. I couldn't tell you. He said you were under surveillance. I am sorry.’ She looked apprehensively at John.
Sherlock was bored. He sat under a tree, trying to read his book and avoiding mosquito bites. He hated Lake Constance. He was forced to accompany his brother and his stupid study buddies on this trip.  Mummy insisted. Mycroft objected. Sherlock protested. Mummy won. In the end Mycroft and his posh friends ignored him. They celebrated the end of their studies as an ongoing party since the end of June. Between the drinking and jumping into the lake, they were discussing philosophy, history, politics, conquests, new jobs and future careers. The bellows of the Russian made him jump. The cackling of the ginger one drove him crazy. The switch in languages – English, French, German, Italian – made him dizzy. Sherlock tried to ignore them. But it was useless. He hated his brain. Everything got stuck there. Every blabber about staying in touch, good old times, brothers in arms, friends for life ... Sherlock's head felt heavy and it sunk towards his book. He tried to concentrate on the hum of the mosquitoes. Perhaps he could avoid a headache this way. It didn't help.
If you don't know Hieronymus Bosch - google his picture "The last judgement". Nowadays it would need a trigger warning.
John stared at Sherlock. He never noticed when Sherlock left to pull someone. But on the other hand:  he was always well dressed and had odd hours and therefore could pick up a partner anytime.
He also checked his clothes. He actually found bugs in his belt, shoes and mobile. He discarded the belt and shoes in the rubbish bin in the kitchen. In the locker room he borrowed some shoes from a new colleague and donned a baseball cap. He 'lost' his mobile in one of the storage rooms and took a non-descriptive one from the provisions chamber, just to get rid of possible surveillance.
There was a website for veterans on the internet, where he still checked in from time to time to keep in contact with his old comrades: he knew Matt to be active there. John's current account was no use. If he was shadowed by Moriarty’s men, then they would know about that account. So John needed to create a new one. For that, he also needed a new e-mail account. From now on, he would use the name William Miller for his internet transactions. Common names were brilliant in internet searches, if you don’t want to be found.
Reverently he opened the door to Sherlock’s bedroom and took everything in a last time, checking if all was in order and indulging in some of his most treasured memories. He went up to his own room and sat at his desk. From the drawer he first took pen and paper and wrote a short letter. After that he picked up his gun, cleaned and loaded it. He moved to his bed and sat on the mattress. Rain splattered on the window pane. In the distance he heard the sounds of the city: cars honking, police sirens blaring - the general susurrus of people minding their businesses. The house itself was deadly silent.
A man at the reception desk already awaited them. While John was greeted by name, Sherlock only got examined shortly. They were led to Mycroft’s study. The man knocked and after a few moments Mycroft’s voiced asked them in. The man held the door open for them and John entered first. Sherlock followed hesitantly, eyes downcast scanning his surrounding behind his baseball cap.
One month later on a lovely spring day, Sherlock realized that they had only used John’s bedroom upstairs as storage space for clothing. The master bedroom, formerly Sherlock’s room, was now their room. The lazy Sunday afternoon was ideal to shuffle wardrobes and clothes and to move John's stuff to the master bedroom.
Mycroft smiled, trying to appease him. “Greg, don't worry. Your involvement is not needed. You are right and you should retire now. The usual guest room is made up.”
Sherlock still looked unsure, but nodded. With that, John closed the gap between them and embraced Sherlock's waist. He settled his other hand lightly on his cheek tracing his cheekbones with his thumb. Looking into Sherlock’s eyes he slowly raised his face giving him all the time to break free. After a few moments Sherlock bent towards him and their lips met. It was an innocent and light kiss, but John felt, how the stiffness in Sherlock's posture melted away. Sherlock's arms circled John and  returned the embrace. Their lips parted for a second, seeking confirmation in each other’s eyes. Their second kiss held more heat, lips parted and tongues engaged.
“There is someone else whose news about his demise was a little premature. I am grateful, that you are here now. He is a horrible patient,” she said exasperated.
“Oh my god,” John mumbled, “it is so good to see you alive. Don’t pull a stunt like that ever again.”
“Sherlock,” John interrupted him. “Maybe I need to say this differently.” He nervously looked around the room but his gaze wandered back to Sherlock. “I am happy. I want to grow old like this, with you. This is it. This is what I want.” He took a gulp of wine. His hand trembled slighly. Sherlock knew, that John voiced more, than he initially wanted to say.
John put his almost empty plate on the table, picked up his wine glass and settled back into the cushions, gaze fixed on the moving pictures of the telly.
Now I go back to my other unfinished/unpublished fic. Lots of angst, BAMF John, BAMF Lestrade, and Sherlock being... Sherlock.
Sherlock hugged him close. He raised his hands to John's neck and encouraged him to look into his eyes.
John and Sherlock were high on adrenaline. They giggled almost the whole way back. John felt elated. He had just shot a man, but he didn't feel bad about it. It was similar to the situation two years ago with the cabbie. The prince had been a bad man and he deserved it. And hell, John made a sniper rifle shot worth that of a professional gunman.
“I hate unfinished business,” Mycroft concluded. He looked at John and Sherlock. “What loose ends are there from your side?”
He locked the door from the inside, wiped it too, took the case with his new possessions and climbed out of the window he came in. With a final wipe down of surfaces there, he climbed down the fire ladder.
After moving back to Baker Street he started running and attended a self-defence course. With regular exercise his sleeping habits became more stable and reducing the alcohol intake did wonders for his health. So it was no surprise, that he felt a need for sex. He always liked sex; the intimacy, the exercise and the excitement. He was an adventurous and a fun companion in bed, and he just missed it. He felt secure in his relationship with Sherlock, receiving everything he needed emotionally: He loved the slow evenings with food, telly and violin music, the crazy debates, the adrenaline filled cases, the inside jokes, the occasional intimate looks and the laughter. He would even go so far and admit that he loved his flatmate. But they had no physical intimacy, except an occasional pat on the back or a steadying hand when needed. He sometimes wondered how Sherlock thought about sex, but after all the time he assumed that sex was just boring and a non-issue for Sherlock, except as a motivator for crime. And he had too much respect for Sherlock to just hit on him and endanger the friendship they had. After all, he once stated, that he was not interested, and except perhaps with ‘The Women’ sex was never a topic to be discussed. He had never seen him dating or flirting outside the cases. John assumed that in Sherlock's brain there was no room for sex, or he just had a very low libido.
She peeked outside, and when everything was clear slipped out of the cabin and left the church. She found John immediately. He mustered her from head to toe. It seemed she passed his examination. After that, John gave her a smile and short hug.
John heaves a sigh that Greg thinks should be trademarked for new parents alone. “D’you want me to take him?” he asks wearily, reaching out slightly.
“Alright,” said John soothingly, finally succeeding in prying his shirt from Sherlock’s grip and nodding as the detective’s eyes began to droop. “It’s alright; we’ll talk about it later.”
John just let out a tired sigh and strode around to the side of the bed, reaching out a hand to attempt to relieve the pull on Sherlock’s cannula in a way that said he had done this before.
“Um,” says Donovan, watching the exchange as though at a tennis match, “we—you, ah, you took some...things…”
As it stands, though, everything escapes his mind but the fact that Sherlock stole a vital piece of evidence—thirteen toes that were sent to some poor sod in the mail, to be exact—and then fallen off the grid for weeks without warning.
“Yes, yes, I know,” says Sherlock tolerantly as he returns to the living room, lightly bouncing an impossibly tiny human with one giant hand. It’s a moment of confusion before Greg realizes that Sherlock’s speaking in response to the baby’s wailing.
” Sherlock insists with mock sincerity. “Only twenty-three days old and this is already the worst day of his life. We must be absolute shit at this,” as though to contradict his words, the baby begins to quiet down.
Greg doesn’t print out the photo and pin it to the bulletin in his office. When Anderson stops in to discuss a case, he absolutely doesn’t stare at it for a few moments before saying, “That’s…that’s bloody precious, that is.”
Sherlock dips his chin to gaze into the infant’s face, pressing a butterfly-soft kiss to his downy forehead.
“Oh my god,” John says, covering his face with his hands while Sherlock walks towards the sound of the crying as though preparing himself to face the guillotine. John crumbles, actually lays down flat on the floor next to his chair, legs splayed in the picture of pure defeat. Greg would laugh if he didn’t feel like a right shit.
“Are you certain you want to do that?” It was strange to think of King William leaving the castle without armed guards.
Carefully, Sherlock opened the door to the king’s quarters. The room was lit by a single candle, which rested on the table between the two chairs. Sherlock was certain the candle had not been lit before. He saw that there was a figure on the bed, facing the other direction. It seemed the blanket was being held, rather than being used as a cover.
Having such tender feelings for his master, John felt a conflicted rift tore through his heart when William asked his servant if he would spend a night in his lord’s bed.
After a while, we started to move our schedules around so that we could write our blogs together in the café. This worked out great for me, as I always seemed to get more done when I could talk about things with him, and it was a welcome distraction from a flat shared with Sherlock.
In the privacy of their shared room, however, everything had changed. John would be pulled close to his master and kissed. Even though John would offer to see to everything for his king, William would undress him, and care lovingly for him.
Sherlock, who was clasping his royal cloak over his chest, paused. “It is there for you, as you know.”
“Yeah, I suppose I could,” John responded, mostly to placate Sherlock. Average people such as John did not exactly have their choice of comfortable jobs.
“Oh.” Sherlock gasped. It was apparent that his clever mind had quickly understood what John meant. “In bed? While we…?”
“Oh, Sherlock.” Reaching for Sherlock’s shoulder, John caressed him there, which relaxed Sherlock somewhat. “Like I said, I love you. You’re so beautiful, and brilliant, and I know I would want to be with you again.”
Taking a second to take better inventory of a face I loved and cherished, I saw that Jeeves was nervous. He’s not the kind of chap who displays his every feeling like a stock ticker, but I’d known the man for some time, and it was clear enough from the way his eyes averted mine that need for reassurance was indicated.
“J-John, oh… yes, please…” There was restraint in William’s guilt-laden voice, but he sounded so forsaken and uncared for.
There were many different rooms in the temple. There were discussion rooms, altars, and an enormous hall with colourful stained windows. At the moment, the hall was being used by a chorus of monks, who sang to the accompaniment of the pipe organ.
The close proximity, the heat and safety of the king’s body over his, made Sherlock’s breath catch in his throat.
For many reasons, Sherlock was frightened. No matter how curious he was about the world around him, he was scared of all that he did not know, and he was terrified of his own bizarre, powerful feelings when he was around this man. It did not seem appropriate to mention the latter, though. “I’m sorry, sir. I will try to be brave.”
Bertie shook his head, staring at the ground. “Jeeves has a point, I’m afraid. Our world isn’t exactly like yours. Imagine, John, that all your kith and kin had a title or were in grabbing distance of one, and all your pals came from the same old dear schools as you, and not one of you had been without a kind of personal attendant since bouncing into this world. Fancy, then, how you’d feel giving Sherlock the rush if his circle was all the working set, thoroughly respectable and self-reliant and all that. I mean to say, how do you carry on together? Do you become more like his people—or him like yours?”
Out of courtesy, the servant tried not to stare, but he so badly wanted to know the feel of those arms. Such knowledge would always be forever beyond the servant. He would have to lie by himself on the sofa, at a respectful distance from his master.
“Excellent! About the first part of that, I mean. And I’m free to form my own opinions on how your company measures up.”
Without bothering to discuss it, William adjusted his clothes back to a reasonably proper state, then wrapped his arms around John and pulled him under the blankets, hugging him. “You wouldn’t make your master sleep alone, would you?” William asked, yet despite the arrogant words, there was nothing but vulnerability in his voice.
“Then what I am going to tell you is actually rather simple. Two males, if they so choose…” Mycroft cleared his throat. “They can do something similar.”
Every lovely, trusting whimper from his servant did mysterious, magical things to John’s soul. He longed to have Sherlock’s trust and devotion for the rest of time. Despite the demands of their positions in life, there was no way that John could ever stand to be separated from his treasured servant.
William did not touch John, or come very close to where he was lying. Still turned away, John did not know what emotion may have passed over his lord’s face, but the servant suddenly recalled the reason that William was not approaching. He had said that this would always be John’s domain.
Perhaps then, the king thought, with such jealousy that it nearly shocked him, Sherlock would never want to be anywhere else.
Irritated with himself for letting his feelings deter him from being the perfect servant for the king, Sherlock continued removing the boots as he answered. “Yes, sir?”
“Well, I have a hard time believing that.” The king released his shoulders and smiled at him, with none of the mockery that Sherlock would have anticipated from someone so superior to him. “You’re clearly very thorough. I don’t think my lance was ever cleaned so well.”
“That makes sense to me.” Sherlock smiled against John’s cheek. He adored all the ways John spoke to him, when it was John doing so. It meant even more now that John knew he could address Sherlock however he wished.
“Poor chap,” I heard Bertie saying one day. “Still trying to get over your crush for your pal? I can only be grateful that I’m not suffering the same ailment of the heart over my worthy PA. How awful that would be, since I see him so often. But how understandable too. He’s so charming, you know, and dashed intelligent. I really would be lost without him.”
He was incredibly fortunate to have as much time as he had with King William. John was not the highborn noble lady that King William was supposed to be with. Nobles did not fall in love with their servants. But for now, he could gladly be in love with his master.
Silence fell on the room and Sherlock felt the weight of several days without rest come over him. He closed his eyes and was about to fell asleep when he felt an arm wrap around his chest. He didn’t say anything, nor he reacted in any way, but a small smile graced his lips as sleep claimed him for good.
“Because I knew you were interested in me in a sexual way—and not just because it was your duty as my Personal Companion. I could feel you were interested in me as a man—and that was the reason I didn’t act on my feelings. I didn’t want to bring a sexual connotation into our relationship because I was afraid it would cause me to lose you as I lost Irene and Janine. I was afraid... My heart had been broken twice and I couldn’t bear the idea of having it broken again. But now...now it’s different. I want to be with you…to go to sleep every night with you in my arms and wake up every morning with you pressed against me, breathing in the scent of your hair and skin.”
The manager smiled again, pleased everything had gone smoothly. “Now relax, John, and let the drugs do their job. It will cause you some discomfort, of course, as you aren’t used to heats, but in the end it will be worth it. You’ll get a new Alpha who will care for you, hopefully for the rest of your life. Isn’t it an exciting thought?”
In the evening, just as John was eating dinner, the door bell rang and it was like a lighting had hit Sherlock. He jumped down the couch and ran down the stairs in a blur of blue dressing gown and bare feet.
The rage he had felt upon discovering it had all been a rouse to test him transformed in pride and awe. This clearly powerful man was trusting him with the life of his beloved brother. Never before John had been given something so precious.
His Master looked at him, surprised. “That’s the first thing you want to know? Interesting.” A brief pause, then he started talking again, so fast John had a bit of trouble following. “I didn't know, I saw. The way you held your body and tilted your head was carefully chosen to make you look taller and show your features at your best. As you’re in your early forties, it wasn’t a difficult leap to deduce you believe your short height and ordinary features are the reason you weren’t chosen as a Personal Companion previously. Your face is tanned, but no tan above the wrists. You've been abroad, but not sunbathing. As we talked you unconsciously assumed a parade at rest stance, suggesting you had to deal with someone accustomed to military discipline who wanted it from you too. I also noticed a callus on your left index finger and a slight burn, both compatible with the use of firearms. My conclusion was you just spent a period abroad, in a hot climate with a military man who taught you to use firearms. I immediately thought of Afghanistan or Iraq. Finally, there is a rolled magazine peaking for your duffel bag; it's a bulletin available only to doctors and it bears your name and address, so you’re a medical doctor too.”
Closing his eyes, John prayed that they would be able to stay together here. He wondered how difficult it would be to keep their relationship secret from the rest of the castle, and from the rest of the kingdom. It was difficult enough to resist riding a horse into the middle of the city and proclaiming to the world that Sherlock was his! But what mattered most was that he had Sherlock, and that Sherlock would be happy in this place, with him.
Perhaps a ritzy building like this had a cleaning service, as well, or it was Jeeves who kept the flat shining clean. I was certain that a PA didn’t do that kind of thing, though.
“It was more than just a gown. There was also a bonnet, a lady’s gloves, and, well,” John cleared his throat, “a woman’s undergarments.”
When Sherlock arrived, his master was already there, and dressed in the comfortable-looking clothes he wore when he slept. With his straight posture and confident shoulders, the king was a good match to the fine room around him. It was a large space, and housed impressive furniture, including an elegant wardrobe, cushioned chairs, and a bed with a purple canopy.
Asking others where Lestrade was would also arouse too much suspicion. Ah, but he could ask John. John was a religious, God-fearing man who certainly kept a rapport with the priest.
“It’s not right, I know it’s not right.” The king groaned. “Damn it, what kind of spell have you cast on me, Sherlock?” Even as he pumped his arm, he looked directly at his servant. “What sort of unearthly creature are you?”
So they had, for all practical purposes, separated; the queen went away to live elsewhere, to do as she liked with whomever she chose, and the king had resigned himself to the dreary, lonely life he seemed destined for.
“Oh, no. He’s under the roof now, is what I mean. A Wooster is nothing if not honest, though, and I must say I wouldn’t mind it if he were. In the old days, there were lots of live-in workers, who lived in where they worked, you know. Sometimes I wish these were the old days.”
“Please, sir,” Sherlock begged. It was too cruel, to be denied what he had so eagerly anticipated. “I want you.”
Moving quickly with robust desire, King John sank to his knees in front of Sherlock. He held onto Sherlock’s hips, and took the servant into his mouth.
The lower part of himself was supported by stalwart hands, but Sherlock could hardly support his upper body on his elbows now. He sank onto his thick pillow, enjoying the vitality of his king. “Did… Did the monarch like it, s-sir?”
Truthfully, John would have been grateful just to have Sherlock’s friendship on this journey, even if John would have been kept up at night by tempting visions of the pretty servant who had looked so beautiful and out of place in a storage room for weapons, at the tournament.
Sherlock started placing some of their things around the room. “I serve you in few ways, sir. I will be grateful if I can make music for you.”
Sherlock must’ve noticed John’s confusion, because he tried to explain. “Music isn’t something that a commoner discusses with a noble, right, sir? You probably know so much about notes and instruments and so forth. I’m not meant to know that much about it, sir.”
Though Jeeves is perpetually outfitted in a dark suit, he was always a dashed fine looker in it, to put it in polite language, and I bolted towards him.
The king deserved a beautiful, alluring, skilled lover, and Sherlock was certain that he did not come close to that description.
Even if he were not interested in the bees, Sherlock would have been glad to be led anywhere by his master. “Yes, I would, sir.”
Sherlock held the violin up, and experimentally drew the bow over one of the strings. Slowly, he began to play with more confidence, and to produce cleaner notes.
Sherlock writhed, his arms trembling as he grasped the bed. “Yes, oh, please, yes!” The skirt of his dress bounced with John’s movements.
John couldn’t face the inexplicable gratitude in Sherlock’s features. The king turned towards the window instead. “You shouldn’t say that. It’s not a good, pure feeling, Sherlock, that I have for you. It’s possessive, and greedy. Don’t mistake me for one of those romantic heroes from fairy tales.”
Funny thing, isn’t it, how we’d gone about it all wrong? John and I had thought it only natural that the golden ties of friendship would sprout first between the two geniuses, but actually, chatting of tunes and composers and all that, Sherlock and I hit it off as if I were his rich uncle, and John and Jeeves, getting to know each other over darts and stories from basic training, or whatever it is these vets talk about, must have felt pretty silly for not having realized before what great friends they could be.
It was a struggle to reach the inn while he was plagued by these thoughts, but the full force of this impossible desire did not hit John entirely until he and his servant were alone in the room they were staying in at the inn. Once he was away from prying eyes, John knew abruptly how hard he had been working to subdue the yearning within him. He couldn’t keep it up any longer. It was too much to suppress. He also couldn’t impose on Sherlock.
to notice you.” The rough, rich voice that spoke could belong to no one but King John. “Your skin is so fair, and your eyes so bright. You shined in that crowd as the white moon shines in the darkness.”
“I wish we were. There weren’t any secrets between us then! If we were still children, I would have been running around this garden like a little idiot telling you about my idiotic crush for the apothecary’s son!”
Sherlock moaned. Witnessing this jealous side of his king, expressed solely for the sake of keeping a servant, made the sensations Sherlock was experiencing even more exquisite.
His servant had spoken of trying a sire a child for John. If only! Were such a thing possible, John would take Sherlock’s hand this very instant and bring him behind one of these apple trees. He would kiss Sherlock and remove all the clothes from them both, and touch and soothe his servant until Sherlock was ready. Then John would hold him, the tanned colour of the king’s chest against the lighter tone of his servant’s back, and sink himself into the tightness and warmth of his lovely Sherlock.
Wearing a well-made traveling cloak, William was clearly a nobleman, but one could not tell any more than that. Nevertheless, John was careful to look out for any undesirable characters, though it was a bright day and most people they saw were busy working or playing in their fields.
It dawned on Sherlock, why the king had not seemed fully satisfied from his intimacy with his servant. He did not care deeply for Sherlock as he would for some cordial, noble lady. Nor should he, if he was to be a fitting king.
John could not resist leaning in and kissing his servant just then. They took their time, and shared a few more, lighter kisses.
“I remember,” John said with long-suffering amusement. “It’s still a title though. Besides, if you don’t believe in God, Sherlock, what do you make of the fact that God has answered all my prayers?”
“That letter m-meant,” there was a charming stutter from John as Sherlock passionately kiss his jaw, “that much to you, Sherlock?”
It would do him no good to admire a visiting king who would no doubt leave town as soon as the tournament was over. It would be best if he could concentrate on this boring task, so that he might finish sooner and be done with it. Then, perhaps, he would have time to watch the last few exciting battles of the tournament.
There were no guards dedicated to this spot. In fact, there was little to see but a solitary set of doors. John knocked politely, yet firmly. “Father Lestrade?”
As they walked down the road, a grassy field appeared on the right. It was wild land, with no fences around it.
“In ancient times, this room was a place for rituals of ecstasy and madness, where the devout would give in to their deepest passions, to celebrate life, to please their gods, and to take part in what were called fertility rituals.”
Greg grins at that. “Likes the sound of London, eh?” he notes, handing Donovan the bag and making his way back to the sitting room. “Sound like anyone you know?”
Sherlock shifted in his sleep just then, head rolling to the side so that he was tugging on the tubes aiding his breathing. A bubble of air scraped its way out of his throat, probably mean to form a word, but it never quite got there. It made Greg’s hair stand on end.
Greg shook his head, saying, “Thought I might take a video,” and gesturing to the phone. He half expected John to berate him for that, but instead the doctor grinned. Upstanding man, John Watson.
Greg nodded again, mindlessly. “Quite contrary,” he muttered, trying desperately to figure out why that phrase rang a bell.
Greg smirked at that. He knew that once upon a time Sherlock had had a drug habit, but he couldn’t help but think that the number one way to piss off the World’s Only Consulting Detective was to cloud his mind. He thought back to the time Irene Adler had drugged him, and he’d spent a good half hour in the police car muttering about dogs and a pirate called Redbeard. He’d buy the woman dinner if she wasn’t dead.
John took the towel and wrapped it around his body, face filled with pain. “Don’t you want me at all? Am I repugnant to you? Did they get it wrong in giving a man to you? Do you want only women?”
About an hour later 221B door opened and a familiar tall figure stepped on the sidewalk. John’s eyes almost bulged as he took in Sherlock’s appearance. His usually – at least outdoor—meticulously groomed friend was dressed in a way John had never seen before. A pair of baggy, shapeless grey sweatpants too big for him, hanging low on his hips and with the legs hems touching the ground. A dirty and stained light brown jacket that had seen better days and a jumper of indescribable colour with a torn neck hem. His hair was even more unruly than usual and his face...well, it looked like he had just cleaned a chimney, it was so dirty.
“Yes,” Sherlock replied. “I like kissing. Not only I like it, but I’m also quite good at it. Even Janine and Irene said so.”
“Then why Master?” John forgot he wasn’t supposed to use that title, “I can’t understand why you can want me to be only a flatmate when I could be so much more for you! Every temporary master I had in the past jumped at the idea to have a Personal Companion, even if only for a while. Why aren’t you?”
Sherlock blushed a pale pink. “I don’t really know. I’ve never thought of myself that way…Never been interested in it.”
From the front, his brother looked human, but for his long, Ibex-like ears – which he always tried to hide beneath his curly hair – and his curved horns. They were shorter and less thick than a male Ibex’s, but still impressive and impossible to disguise.
Sherlock’s eyes widened in surprise. John had been so anguished to see him dead in his dream? Not knowing what to say about it, he asked, “Do you need something? Tea, maybe?”
The glass of whisky was empty and the flames in the fireplace reduced to embers when Sherlock resurfaced from the depths of his mind.
John’s eyes danced from a man to the other, trying to understand what was going on. He had read something about the mysterious serial suicides, as the press had dubbed them, but why should they interest Sherlock?
His Master shrugged. “I was born like this; the result of a crazy experiment a nutcase scientist ran on my four grandparents without their knowledge.”
“My scent. It never changed. It changed after Coleman died, but not this time. Also, your bite mark is still silvery, not dull white as it would be if you were dead. I noticed these fact about two months after your fall and thus I knew...well, hoped...one day you would come back.”
Sherlock had tried to protest, but John had silenced him and used all his knowledge to give him the fulfilment he needed.
It was a heady thought to be allowed such freedom. Back in the past year, he had been too much of a physiological mess to look out for an Alpha to bond with. He had been depressed and damaged and resigned to the fact no one would want him as mate. So he had mostly waited for his allowed time to end and the arranged bond that would follow.
John didn’t hesitate. He stood up and quickly discarded his jumper and shirt. By the time he was out of his underwear, Sherlock was already naked and stretched on the bed, his head supported by his bent elbow.
Unbidden his thoughts went to Victor Trevor. Sherlock had met him at Cambridge, when they had been partners in an experiment for their Biology course. Victor had been kind, smart, funny and had treated Sherlock as a normal person, without ever commenting his most obvious characteristics and defending him from insults.
The light suddenly came on, blinding him for a moment. When John was finally able to see again he spotted Mycroft Holmes standing in front of him, holding his umbrella.
John looked at him with wide eyes but kept his mouth shut, because he didn’t know what to say. The prospect of not having to sexually serve his mMster was unsettling. All his temporary masters had wanted to have sex with him, even Stanford and Sholto. John felt confident when he was in bed, he knew he had skills and the ability to know what his partner wanted before he was asked.
The next instant he found himself flat on his back with Sherlock hovering over him, pupils blown black with want and his mouth open showing his fangs.
John nodded in understanding. The older Holmes’s intromissions in his brother’s life were not, as he had always thought, attempts to control Sherlock and make him behave in a way Mycroft approved of. They were a man’s desire to fulfil his dying father’s last request, coupled with a great affection for Sherlock—although Mycroft would probably downplay it.
Sherlock chuckled and shook his head ruefully. “It’s a good thing nobody is watching us. We sound so disgustingly sappy…”
“Yes. I found footprints matching the victim’s shoes in that flowerbed. The grounds had been recently watered when Majors stepped on them and residues of mud stuck to his soles. He lost the mud as he walked, and the distance between his steps and their uneven direction tell me he was stumbling. The strong smell of alcohol – Glenfiddich Whisky, I believe—on the hem of his jacket sleeve and on the bench show he was so drunk he passed out lying there and it was then he was attacked and killed.”
Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment. “Intense. Beautiful. I never thought it could be like this.” A pause, then, “When can we do it again?”
Sherlock had spent two whole months travelling abroad at his brother’s request and John had been obliged to stay behind because he couldn’t travel without the appropriate documents. He had literally counted the days till Sherlock’s return and had organized a sort of ‘welcome back’ dinner for tonight, cooking the other man’s favourite dishes.
“Are you feeling all right?” John asked in a rare moment Sherlock was awake and, blessedly, eating something.
“Busted knee ligaments. I’ll need surgery, but not right now.” Sherlock answered and while the doctor in John wanted to know more about the injury, the man agreed it could wait.
The line uttered by Sherlock a few days ago flashed into John’s mind, filling him with horror as he realized what was happening.
“Dear God,” Mycroft exclaimed with a tone John had never heard. “Don’t let him lose consciousness, John. I’ll arrive as soon as I can.”
The usually silent corridors and halls of the Diogenes Club resounded with the echo of Sherlock Holmes’ steps, as his leather shoes hit the marble pavement in quick succession.
However something had changed in him after his meeting with Irene Adler. Something had awaken inside him. At first that interest had been focused on Irene. She had been beautiful and smart and he had been quite fascinated by her—but he had never trusted her enough to make himself vulnerable with feelings, and it had been a wise decision given what had happened with her.
This was not just about him. There was another person involved. John’s life would be tied to his as much as his own would be tied to John—for the rest of their lives.
He felt heat scorch his back and the cold water was a relief and not just a protection from the hell raging around them. There were flames and smoke, debris and pieces of broken glass falling and flying all around.
John was in the sitting room, staring at the open, blank page of his computer. Months before, his therapist had suggested that writing down what happened to him, would be help him to get used to civilian life. The last time they had seen each other, she had asked him if he had written something and he had replied with a “no”, because nothing happened to him.
So Sherlock had gone out at...what time was it? John checked his watch. Midnight. Where had he gone? Why at such hour? And why hadn’t he said anything to John?
Sherlock considered it for a moment, then said, “Why not?” He laid on the bed on his stomach, and adjusted the pillows under his head.
They had gotten closer after Baskerville. Sherlock had become more…affectionate, using every occasion to brush against or touch John. There also been gentle smiles and speculative looks when Sherlock thought John would not see him. More than once the Omega had thought his bondmate was about to kiss him, and he had longed for it. Then Moriarty had resurfaced and things had changed.
John had obeyed to the other man’s wishes and kept his hands to himself, as he learned how to fit in his Master’s life.
Sherlock briefly returned the embrace and replied, “There is no need to worry, Mrs. Hudson. It has all been settled.”
“Forgive me, John. Let’s chalk it to tonight stress and the alcohol.” Mycroft recomposed himself and continued. “Vampires aren’t made; they’re born. Our father was a vampire and Sherlock inherited his nature.”
It was as a stunning revelation as Sherlock’s being a vampire, and John repeated it in his mind until Mycroft’s voice intruded into his thoughts.
“I don't know,” John answered. Sherlock’s heart was an enigma for him. He longed for a true relationship with his bondmate. He hadn’t been a virgin when he had bonded with Coleman. He knew how good sex could be between two people who cared for each other, and he longed to experience again that never forgotten passion and tenderness. But the problem was John wasn’t sure Sherlock was able to love like that, and he didn’t want to press him in the fear of ruining their relationship. They weren’t lovers, but they were friends and it was so much more than he ever had during his 17 years with Coleman.
“Kill you? No, don't be obvious. I mean, I'm going to kill you anyway, some day. I don't want to rush it, though. I'm saving it up for something special. No, no, no, no, no. If you don't stop prying, your friends will pay the price. You know, Mrs Hudson, Molly Hooper, Lestrade and John here...Are we clear?”
“Of course I mean it!” John exclaimed. “Do you really think that after a life of sex without a hint of love or even affection, sex would really matter so much to me?”
John nodded, not sure what ‘lead’ Sherlock was thinking of, but any other question he might have was silenced when his friend turned to look out the window, lost again in his thoughts.
A final sweep of that talented tongue around the head of his cock and Sherlock could not take it anymore: he arched his back to push himself as far as he could into John’s mouth and came with a loud shout, as white-hot pleasure exploded in him.
The manager handed him a folder. “I thought you would first like to read about him. You know, to make this more personal.”
Being careful not to make any noise, John had opened the door, just that tiny bit he needed to be able to look inside.
In the bright light of the day his horns looked impressive, almost majestic. They were about thirty-five  centimetres long, with a slight backward curve. They sat atop his head in such a natural way it seemed like it been created to bear them, like they weren’t an unwelcome addition, but something every human should have.
And then, of course, there had been Irene and Janine, but Sherlock didn’t want to remember them now.
Rising on his knees John scooted forward until he was perched above Sherlock’s erection, then took the turgid shaft and guided it to his opening. Once the tip was inside him, let go of it and slowly sunk down.
Once there John stopped, still on his knees with a hand pressed on the mattress to hold himself steady, as the other behind his back. It took a moment for Sherlock’s dazzled brain to understand John was preparing himself.
