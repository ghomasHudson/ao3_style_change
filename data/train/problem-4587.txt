“Are you sure?”
Jack sighed. “Will it make a difference if I nag you about day drinking?”
“When should we do this?” Jo asked.
Castiel wished for the numbness to return. Anything was better than this sinking feeling at the pit of his stomach.
“Good. I’m looking forward to it.”
“Hello, everybody, and welcome once again to your favorite game show on earth,
It wasn’t as complicated as Castiel had imagined, but it was a bit challenging knowing when the burger patties were done. Dean wanted his medium rare, but Castiel liked his well done. But Dean had a good eye for that so he told Castiel when to flip the burgers and when to remove them completely.
“Yeah. You showed up one day at my store, talking about this sex date of yours. When I saw how genuinely you enjoyed that
“Yeah,” Dean said quickly. He didn’t even have to think about it.
“Why does it bother you so much that your brother has long hair?” Castiel asked.
“Yeah, go ahead. Didn’t mean to hold you up.”
Dean’s eyes lit up, and then he rushed to the driver’s side and climbed behind the wheel.
Dean scoffed. “No way. Did you think I was just humoring you?”
“I’m sorry, coming from where?” Castiel said, laughing again.
Amelia hummed in bliss as she chewed, licking her thumb. “Stop looking at me. I know I’m gross.”
Castiel leaned against the sink, glaring at Dean in a way that only served to amuse Dean further. “I thought we were friends.”
irresistible.”
“He’s a friend,” Dean said, heading back to the table to pick up his things.
“Yes, I did. I like them. They brought me muffins. You want one?”
“Did anyone see where the girls at the table next to us went?” Castiel wondered, keeping his tone casual as he took a sip of his beer. “They left their food uneaten.”
Mary was unconscious on the hospital bed, the monitor showing there was no pulse, but they still stood there waiting for a miracle to happen. Dean prayed to whoever would listen. God, Allah, Yahweh, Ganesha, Vishnu. Any variation of a deity that could save his mom.
Castiel joined them, hugging both of them with open arms. Castiel was filled with the reality that, yes, Dean was an important part of their life, someone indispensable, closer than Castiel’s blood relatives. Dean meant so much to both him and Amelia. How fortunate they had been when Dean had picked out the house right next to theirs.
Tomorrow’s the big day. I don’t know how I’ll be able to sleep tonight. I know we decided to spend the night apart, but that was kind of a stupid idea. Sam thinks I’m being ridiculous, but I want to go find you right now. He says he won’t sleep so he makes sure I don’t sneak out in the middle of the night. Oh well. I guess I’m stuck in my room for the night.
The last thing Dean wanted was to go to a stranger with their problems, but after Sam suggested seeing a counselor, Dean couldn’t shake off the idea. Dean had to give it a shot. It was that or nothing, and Dean couldn’t take the “nothing” option anymore.
“No, you’re not. But you’re going to have a child soon. So you need to keep yourself safe and healthy.”
“Call that ungrateful brother of yours, too,” Bobby said. “Never comes around anymore since he got that fancy job in Houston.”
Castiel had never heard anything better. “You know my heart is yours, Dean. I just don’t want you to pull away from me again, please. Talk to me the moment you start having fears or doubt, and I promise I will always be there to listen. Together, we’ll figure something out. Or we’ll make it up as we go. Either way, it’s better to be completely honest with each other.”
The entire drive to work, Dean thought about what Sam had said. He was worried about Dean, but he didn’t know the full extent of the situation. Sam didn’t know how much Dean and Castiel wanted this to work. Why did should they keep themselves from having this when they both wanted it so much? The gnawing thought Dean couldn’t shake was the one that kept asking
“Hold still.”
“Dean, do you think you could walk me home?” Anna asked.
“Okay, so my question is, do either of you actually believe in the Mothman?” Anna asked.
“You could wait in the car. I’ll be fine.” Castiel eyed the group hesitantly, but they had gone back to their own private conversations.
Castiel screamed on Dean’s second try, feeling his lungs expanding and deflating as he yelled without anything holding him back anymore. And it felt fantastic. Screaming his frustrations into the night helped him relieve a lot of built up tension. It was freeing in so many ways.
“Did you ever think of negative things while looking at me?”
Dean gave him a soft smile. “I’m gonna give Claire her bottle before heading to the airport. Do you need anything while I’m out?”
“Come on,” Dean said. “What do you want me to tell you? We hit it off. He’s a nice guy.”
“If I were to ask you what you wanted me to get you for Christmas, would you tell me?”
They got comfortable on the couch. They sprawled on either end of the couch, head to feet and feet to head, with a blanket draped over both of them. A huge bucket of popcorn sat in the middle for them to share. Castiel kept tossing them at Dean, but he missed his mouth a quarter of the time. They were better at this when they were younger.
Castiel grinned. “You’re going to cook for me?
Dean considered the offer, and then smiled. “
filled the room as Charlie poured them all a glass of whiskey. Sitting around the glass coffee table, they all did shots. Dean relished the burn in his throat, and he refilled their glasses.
Dean had spent all day cooking Castiel’s favorite foods—a chicken penne pasta, Caesar salad, and chocolate cake. Dean had even made him freshly squeezed lemonade. He’d wanted to go all out for Castiel’s birthday. Before getting started, Dean had asked Castiel to stay out of the kitchen and let him work without his usual distractions in the form of kisses, ass grabs, and the like. Dean was proud of Castiel for only interrupting him once, sneaking into the kitchen with the excuse of wanting a glass of water, but not leaving until he pressed Dean against the counter and made out with him for a while. As far as interruptions went, it wasn’t a bad one.
Dean chuckled. “Alright. I’ll be right back. Make yourselves at home.” He went into the kitchen and brewed some coffee. While he waited for the coffee, he pulled out three mugs from the cupboard, each one with a different state written in a different type of funky font. From the times he’d visited Missouri, Louisiana, and West Virginia. He missed those long road trips with Sam in the passenger seat, AC/DC blasting from the speakers, and the wind hitting his face as they drove down the highway without a clear destination.
“Tell me what to do,” Jo said, washing her hands.
“It’s nice to see your face. I almost forgot what you looked like.”
Castiel thought he was falling then, but Amelia pulled him into her arms, and he clung to her like his life depended on it. He hadn’t been expecting to fight with Dean over something Lisa did. In what world did that make sense? What the fuck had gone wrong there? Castiel gripped Amelia, trying to remember how to breathe. Dean had kicked him out of his house. He didn’t want anything to do with Castiel anymore. He’d forgiven Lisa, but he was done with Castiel.
“Ah, Cas. Slow down.” Dean was hard already. He thought they’d get to this part after dinner, in the comfort of his apartment.
“What’s wrong?” Dean asked, stopping a few feet away. “What’s going on?”
“What the fuck is going on, man?” Jo looked around the diner and scoffed. “People fell from the sky down the block. I had to stand there and see their insides splattered all over the sidewalk. We spent the afternoon covering up dead bodies. When we went to the police station, there was no one to help us. Apparently this shit’s been happening all day today. They don’t know what to do. They just told us to be careful and watch our surroundings. My mom decided to offer free food and shelter to everyone, so now there’s not even a place to breathe. It’s nuts!”
“Maybe.”
“This felt really good,” Dean said, blowing on the page he had finished sketching before closing the book and tucking it away. “We should do this again soon.”
“Aren’t you going to eat?” Castiel asked. “Your food will get cold.”
Dean opened his eyes to find a long arrow stuck to the angel’s shoulder. The angel’s confusion returned and he stared at the arrow in offense, reaching to pull it out. Blood poured out of him. He looked more human than angel as he touched the bright crimson blood oozing from his shoulder. With the angel’s concentration on his wound, Dean was suddenly able to move freely again. With adrenaline pumping through his veins, Dean ran to the angel and punched his face, then kneed him in the crotch. Dean wasn’t sure how similar the anatomy of an angel was to that of a man, but he hoped this hurt enough to weaken him. The angel stumbled back, face constricted in pain, and Dean took his chance to steal the sword from his grip.
Dean turned to him, but he seemed distracted. When his eyes met Castiel’s, something flickered in Dean’s eyes. Castiel could almost see another wild idea growing in his head. He winced internally, preparing for whatever it was. Tonight, it was ghost hunting; tomorrow, who knew?
Castiel couldn’t look away from Dean’s profile. It was too dark to distinguish his freckles, but he knew they were there. He’d memorized all of the details on Dean’s face a long time ago. It was important for Castiel to remember Dean exactly right every time he closed his eyes. “What?”
was frustrated?
Castiel shook his head. “Do I need to mother you? You’re going to have real food before dessert, Dean.”
“If you don’t mind. I already got rained on this morning.”
“What round? This isn’t a competition. I thought you guys talked it out last time he was here.”
“Aw, you’re ditching us already?” Jo said. “Not cool, man. First, we don’t get invited to your special Friday night hang outs, and then you ditch us?”
“Castiel made it,” Amelia said, when there was an uncomfortable silence following Dean’s comment.
“No, Dean, that’s not how this works. Everyone needs to go through the screening process. Even friends.” Castiel looked at Benny, and not with his friendliest looks.
“Fuck, me too,” Dean said, breathing against Castiel’s neck. He knew the reasonable thing to do was stop and take it home. But Dean was already hard, and it would take some time for him to be able to drive them home. They’d probably lose the momentum. It didn’t matter, though, because they weren’t fucking teenagers, so they really shouldn’t act like such.
“You should have just kissed Benny,” Sam said.
Mary narrowed her eyes at him. “You know what? I think Dean might be right. Last week when you drove me to my appointment, you almost ran over that poor squirrel on the road.”
Sam rolled his eyes. “Of course he did.” He lifted the glass dish he was carrying. “I gotta get these scalloped potatoes inside.”
The rest of the afternoon went by with countless glances exchanged between Dean and Castiel across the street. It had become sort of a game for Dean. He kept staring because Castiel kept staring, and then he stared some more just to see if the game was still on and, apparently, it was. Castiel seemed amused by the entire thing, sometimes chuckling to himself as he kept eye contact with Dean. At one point, Dean simply rolled his eyes at Castiel to let him know what a dick he was and Castiel rolled his eyes right back.
Slowly, Castiel moved away from Dean, until the only thing between them was space. “I should probably go. I don’t think I have enough self-control to stay in your bed another night without…”
Castiel let himself in, calling out to Dean.
“If you ever need me, I’ll help you,” Castiel said, looking back into his eyes. “In any way that I can.”
He felt Jess’s arms around him, pulling him in. Dean knew that Castiel was still there, but he didn’t care. “I’m so sorry, Jess. I shouldn’t have said those things to you. I was such a moron, and I hated myself for the way I treated you and Sam.”
“That’s all that matters,” Dean said. “You wanna get in the tent?”
Jess gave him a look. “Winchester men don’t learn from their mistakes.”
Cas poured them both more rum. “Maybe the only other person in the room.”
Castiel rolled his eyes. “Okay, so if we’re both moving to Pratt, I need to get out of that apartment lease and find us a house. Something big where we can have more cats.”
“Not work, I hope,” Castiel said.
“You’ve been keeping me at arms’ length since we met at the Roadhouse. And I’ve been trying to win back your affection ever since.”
Castiel smiled. “It was my pleasure. I got to spend some quality time with him.”
“I’d love to,” Castiel said, clearing his throat. “But I still have to finish cleaning up.”
Castiel bit his lip. “Interesting. So you were jealous of my looks all along?”
And so, they went over all of Dean’s questions. There were many. But Castiel was patient with Dean, answering every question that popped up in his mind. By the end, Dean felt much better. He finally felt prepared for the final.
Castiel stared at his hand for a long, quiet moment.
Dean looked down at the patties, flipping them over again. He didn’t know how to answer Charlie’s question, and he was relieved when Castiel showed up and told Charlie that Jo wanted to show her a video on her phone. Charlie went over to Jo, but Castiel stuck around.
“Nah, I’ve been up for a while. A dad never gets to sleep in, even on a Saturday.”
It was easier to pretend the kiss had been as innocent as Castiel had told Anna. Because deep down, Castiel knew he wanted more.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “I don’t know. I don’t want to intrude.”
“What?” Castiel asked with a tilt of his head. He looked amused, like he thought Dean had been joking. But then when he realized he wasn’t, Castiel looked crushed and confused and upset. “What are you talking about?”
Dean opened his eyes, keeping his gaze forward, not ready to glance at Castiel yet. “You don’t know how it feels to always live with this uncertainty, Cas. To not know if Lisa is tired or bored of me because I’ll never be that man, the one she holds up on a pedestal despite the fact that he abandoned her. It’s the worst feeling, never knowing if Benjamin West will want to be a part of Ben’s life. He has every legal right to him. I don’t. I’m not even Ben’s stepfather. I’m just the boyfriend who’s too emotionally invested.”
Anna glanced at Raejean, held her gaze. “Maybe we’re not all as cold-blooded as I thought.”
“I already told all of you I’m fine.”
“I make the time,” Sam said. “Mom really likes my videos.”
“Not hungry,” Dean mumbled.
They had already discussed leaving to find Anna, but Dean couldn’t bear the thought of leaving Sam and Jess behind. Castiel understood Dean’s worry, and he assured him that he would patiently wait until Dean felt comfortable enough to get back on the road. Dean knew how difficult it was for Castiel to not know any knowledge about his sister’s well-being, but he couldn’t find it in him to suggest to Castiel to take off on his own to find her. It was selfish of him, but having Castiel around was a necessity lately.
Dean wouldn’t ruin that.
“Yes,” Castiel said. “I can do that.”
Dean chuckled, giving Castiel deep, languid kisses that had them both panting. “I do remember saying that.”
“Fantastic.” The hand was back on Dean’s shoulder. “I’m looking forward to spending time with you, Dean.”
Castiel felt bad for ruining Dean’s fun. “Dean, you should go to the party with them. I’ll stay here with Claire. It’ll be fine.”
Shit. It was Valentine’s Day tomorrow? Castiel hadn’t been to any stores lately, otherwise he would have been flooded with the reminders of the holiday. Why was Dean bringing it up, though?
Dean caught the fork before it hit him and then threw it back at her. “That could have poked my eye, asshole.”
Castiel had swam over to the side of the pool closer to them, arms over the edge. Water was dripping down his hair onto his face. There was a big, goofy grin on his face. “I’m so glad to see you both! Come on in. Swim with me.”
. In the two weeks, he’d managed to avoid all of Castiel’s phone calls, only answering with a text that repeated how busy he was. Eventually, Castiel would get tired of trying.
“I think you got that beer gut from all the beer you drink, Dad,” Jo said.
Castiel spun around to find Claire attempting to jump from Dean’s arms to his own. Castiel opened his arm to catch her at the same time that Dean let her go. Castiel hugged Claire tight, kissing her dimpled cheeks. “Hi, honey. I missed you so much.”
Dean stopped in his tracks, turned to Castiel, and glared. “I’m not a sore anything. You weren’t supposed to win with me. There’s no honor in a co-win. What’s the point in that, anyway?”
Castiel turned on the seat, staring directly at Dean, hoping he’d heard correctly. “What?”
Chuckling nervously, Dean grabbed his water and took a sip. His mouth was suddenly very dry. “I believe you.”
“Can we go swimming now?” Ben asked.
Dean grinned. “How’s Jess doing?”
“Jody asked if we want to share with each other why we haven’t exactly been getting along lately,” Dean said, catching Castiel’s eyes and not looking away.
He looked at Castiel, who was waiting patiently. He wasn’t backing down from this.
“You know she doesn’t like being ignored,” Dean said.
Anna glanced at Raejean with a silent question.
There were a lot of cars on the road today, which wasn’t surprising. People were in dire need to escape, hoping for a safer place to be. Castiel wished he had any guarantee that they would find any safety, even once they found their siblings.
Dean went back to the table, trying to keep his laughter inside.
Castiel leaned his head against Dean’s, looking at the television where Rachel Ray was chopping tomatoes. “I just don’t want anything to change more than it already has.”
“Yeah, I wanted to talk about it.” Dean rubbed his face with his hands. “I’m sorry if this is weird.”
“Why would he go for a run? Is he prepping for a marathon or something? He’s got enough on his plate to do that, too.” Dean sat beside Mary and started eating.
Lately, it seemed to happen even more frequently. Castiel would join Dean on the couch for a show or a movie, and within minutes they would be on top of each other. Castiel preferred when Dean straddled his lap so he could have both hands on Dean’s ass while his tongue was down Dean’s throat. Sometimes, they would makeout in the middle of the kitchen when they ran into each other while getting a snack. Dean wondered if they craved their heavy makeout, dry humping sessions more than the actual snacks at this point.
It was late in the afternoon when the flight landed. Castiel got a cab to take them home. After staying up the entire flight, Claire was now suddenly tired. She fell asleep in her car seat. Castiel had wanted her to be awake to greet Dean, but she needed the rest.
“I would
A puff of mist that smelled of peppermint came out of the lit up essential oil diffuser on the wooden table between Castiel and Jody. It was kind of Jody to make sure the thing was always on and smelling of peppermint every time Castiel had an appointment with her. Castiel had found that the minty scent calmed him down.
With all the hesitation in the world, Dean handed over his keys to Anna. “Be gentle with her. She’s not used to strange hands.”
“Hey,” Dean said, laughing off his surprise. “What are you doing here?”
We have a lot of homework to do, darling.
“I don’t need glasses,” Sam said. “Glasses wouldn’t look good on me.”
Amelia showed up around lunch and woke him up this time. Dean wasn’t as mean to Amelia because being mean to Amelia was like being mean to a cute little kitten. It couldn’t be done.
Castiel faced Kevin and tilted his head. “Hmm.”
Dean thought about that. What could he lose by telling Castiel how he felt? Castiel was leaving anyway. Dean had already lost him. Castiel could react in many ways if Dean told him, but in every one of those scenarios, he would still leave. Dean had absolutely nothing to lose now. He downed the rest of his beer and stood up.
Castiel rolled his eyes. “As I was saying, she and I kissed when we had to close together one night. Then we went on to date for a few months. She moved away for college the following summer. I never really made time for dating growing up. With all my family drama, I fought hard to earn a living and support myself in a city where I knew no one. But after that short-lived relationship, I realized I was ready to put myself out there. Unfortunately, the two women I dated before I met Amelia just wanted me for a good time. And I’m sure you know I don’t enjoy that.”
Bobby was wearing the brand new navy blue baseball cap Sam had bought him. His old one was dirty, ripped, and stained. But Bobby never left home without it. “‘Course I do. I’m never taking it off.”
“We’re flying to China in under ten minutes,” Castiel said. “Wouldn’t you say that’s fast?”
Lisa had cried over Ben’s dad for weeks after he left. At the time, Dean had convinced himself that it was because of the pregnancy hormones, but he hadn’t wanted to see the truth. Lisa had been in love with Benjamin West. His abandonment had left her miserable and frightened, and she’d run into Dean’s arms because she knew Dean would never say no to her.
Lisa rolled her eyes.
“I never said I didn’t.”
Sam looked at Castiel for a long moment, and then to Dean, trying to tell him something with just facial expressions. Dean tried to read them as best as he could, but all he understood was that Sam was warning him to be careful with Castiel. Dean nodded and gave him a thumbs up.
Castiel’s phone started ringing, and Dean jumped when he saw the number. It was Sam, calling back.
The waiter smiled at Dean before he took their menus and went away.
“Dean.” Castiel set the car seat down on the bed, sitting on the edge of it to draw Dean in. He held the back of Dean’s head carefully in his hands as he pulled him close, unsure where he was feeling any discomfort.
“He didn’t fly all this way to see
true,” Castiel said.
“Did we just hear right?” Sam asked.
“Hi.” Dean smiled.
“I thought you had moved on from us,” Charlie said. “I thought you wanted to forget
“You got it.”
Dean smiled. For the first time, Dean felt okay at hearing those words said to him. He didn’t feel like a fraud anymore. “Thanks, Sammy. You didn’t have to call just to say that.”
Castiel looked away from the moon and turned to Dean. One corner of his lips quirked up, created a stunning half-smile. “I always liked romance. But I was never serious about it until my ex left me. I turned to fiction to get back what he took away from me.”
are you talking about? A clean break?” Dean hadn’t realized that he’d been crying until he felt the tears falling on his shirt. “Fuck, Lisa! Why are you doing this? This isn’t fucking right! You know this isn’t right! How can you stop me from being in Ben’s life? Ben has known me all his life—he sees
“You do? I wasn’t sure if you would. I don’t draw people often. But I wanted to draw you.” Castiel swallowed. “When I woke up, you were still sleeping, and you were smiling. I couldn’t look away. You looked delicate.”
“I guess I don’t.”
Castiel breathed another long breath. “So, you’re saying no sex for us yet?”
Castiel and Dean had been best friends since the first grade. They did everything together. They’d even dated the same girl, Meg. It should have been weird, but somehow it wasn’t, because Dean had insisted that Castiel go after Meg right after he dumped her, and so he did. For most of their lives, it had only been Castiel, Dean, and Sam. But when they got to high school and met Jo and Charlie, they became part of the gang. That’s what Dean called their group, the gang. Dean had always had a thing for Scooby-Doo.
Dean ran his hand through Castiel’s hair. “I’ve always wanted to do this. Your hair drives me crazy sometimes. And your tie. I hate your crooked blue tie. It was so tempting just reaching my hands out to fix it.”
But Dean was thinking about Ben again and then he was crying. Usually, he didn’t cry in front of others, but Dean was done giving a damn. So he burst into tears, sobbing uncontrollably with the pain returning all over again. Ben had been taken from him. Ripped away. How could Dean go through the rest of his life without his son? Who would read Ben his bedtime stories and tuck him in bed? And then, Dean remembered that Lisa had left behind Doug the Dog. That was Ben’s favorite toy. She couldn’t even let Ben keep that small memory of Dean.
“Dean, you’ve been single for too long. I figured it was time that you met someone new. And Rhonda is super nice and sweet. She’s one of Jess’s closest friends at work. We thought you two would hit it off.”
Castiel crossed his arms. “Try me.”
Anna gave Dean a sympathetic glance as she continued eating her fish.
Dean tried hard not to laugh. He took the rose and smelled it. “It’s beautiful. You shouldn’t have.”
Castiel settled in, and started up PowerPoint, getting right to the lecture. He seemed a bit off. If Dean didn’t know any better, he’d say he was kind of upset about the topic. It was odd, considering how much Castiel seemed to enjoy teaching religions.
Dean lowered the volume enough to be heard over the song. This time, Castiel didn’t even try to hide the wide smile on his face, the one that wrinkled his nose and brought out his crow’s feet. Despite those details, Castiel looked ten years younger. God, Dean had missed that smile.
. But Dean had always been great at rising above his fears. Dean stepped up when Castiel couldn’t, and Castiel loved that about him.
Dean heaved a sigh. “That’s right.”
Morning brought more than sunshine. It brought soft kisses that turned into desperate kisses that turned into dry humping that turned into real humping that turned into orgasms real quick. Dean hadn’t woken up to sex in such a long time that he couldn’t remember. Not that any sex he’d had in the past could ever compare to sex with Castiel, who was by far the best Dean had ever had. Afterwards, Dean and Castiel both hopped in the shower together, but since they weren’t teenagers anymore, the shower stayed pretty clean.
Dean would have laughed if his heart wasn’t thumping furiously against his ribcage the closer he got to Castiel. Dean’s dick was practically pressed up entirely against Castiel’s ass, and it felt glorious. “Are you ready?”
Since Dean had seen
“I’m buying that record,” Dean said, standing up. “But I’d also like to order the Zeppelin one. I need to replace it in my collection anyway.”
Dean was relieved to hear that, although part of him was hoping Castiel would assume Dean had acquired about his emotional well-being. “I have an idea, but I’m not sure you’ll be on board with it.”
“Shut up.”
And that was exactly what they did. They sat all the way in the back. The theater was nearly empty, except for another couple in the middle row. Dean hadn’t seen the appeal of making out at the movies, but now that he had Cas’s tongue inside his mouth and Cas’s hand tucked inside his t-shirt, Dean never wanted to leave this place.
The waiter laughed, probably to make Dean feel better. “That’s good to hear, Dean. I’m Jimmy. Listen, you enjoy your pie, and I’ll come back in a bit to check up on you…all.” Jimmy touched Dean’s shoulder again before leaving.
Castiel hurried to dig it out of his pocket, nearly dropping it from excitement when he confirmed that it was Dean.
“Sam, Jess, this is Anna, our very own modern-day sleeping beauty,” Dean said.
“But we start filming in two weeks,” Dean said.
Dean smiled. How he loved his stupid, stuck-up, wild-haired, blue-eyed coworker.
“One time, Castiel brought up trading her in for a minivan. You know, for the baby.”
“We had a nice talk,” Dean said, balancing Claire on his hip while he finished putting away the cereal boxes.
The girl smiled. “Hello. How can I help you?”
Ben cheered, jumping into Castiel’s arms and hugging him tight. “Thank you!” Then he pulled back to look at his face. “I’m sorry for biting you if it hurt.”
Dean felt Castiel’s laughter when his body shook with the movement. His own eyes had closed, but he hadn’t quite drifted off. He felt so relaxed. But then Castiel placed a gentle hand to Dean’s head and whispered into his ear, “Dean, sorry to wake you, but I have to go.”
“Dad, I need to pee again,” Ben said.
Bobby looked over his shoulder. “Those? Yeah, long time ago. I was gonna sell ‘em, but the buyer never got back to me.”
“Yeah, I was pretty shocked. I thought he wanted to hang out. You know, as friends. It was just a few beers. I wasn’t looking for a hook up.”
“I think they choose to ignore that fact,” Castiel said.
“Yes, I’m sure, Cas. You’re always my plus one.”
“Dean! Dean, she has a fever. Oh, my God. What do we do? What do we do now?”
Castiel squeezed Dean’s hand. “I don’t want you to worry about me either.”
Dean let out a shaky breath. “Wait right here, alright? I’m getting you some water.”
“I think I can trust you with food. So far, so good.” Dean took another bite of his bruschetta.
“God, you are such a sap. Have you always been this way? Why am I just finding this out now? I always thought you were this unbreakable force who buried his feelings from the world. You never even cried in front of me.”
Anna grabbed the other chair in the room and sat on the other side of Castiel’s bed. She folded her legs on it and laid her head on her knees.
“You do?”
And why should Sam believe in luck when he had the best of it? Sam was a successful divorce attorney, blissfully married to an intelligent woman who was debatably a better divorce attorney than him. Sam had it all. He had the looks, the money, and the love any person could desire. Dean? Dean had this road trip.
Castiel had never imagined that Dean would go through all the trouble of building a crib from scratch for his future daughter. The fact that Dean had done that, it was more than Castiel felt he deserved. “Dean, I don’t know how I could ever thank you for doing that. Amelia will be over the moon when she finds out.”
“I don’t drink before dinner,” Jack said. “You need anything else, boss?”
“Gabe, I’m sorry for taking up your time with Cas. I was just heading out anyway.”
“What?” Dean was stunned. That was the last thing he’d expected from the guy. He’d been so uptight during all their previous interactions. Dean almost wondered if Ash had really talked to him, and not to one of his white-covered minions.
Dean perked up at the sight of Castiel in a blue shirt. He hadn’t bothered doing much reading in preparation. He’d grown up going to church every Sunday and knew the basics. If he came out learning something new, he’d consider himself lucky.
“I wanted to show you.”
“You want me to get that before I go?” Jack asked.
“Ames, I’m going home,” Castiel said, still holding onto her. “I need to go home.”
Once home, Dean carried the car seat inside while Castiel followed close behind. Dean wasn’t even sure that Castiel had blinked in the last few minutes. Castiel’s eyes were gone, somewhere far away. Dean had never seen that look on his face. It was what led him to believe that maybe Castiel just hadn’t processed the entire thing. He looked like he was sleepwalking.
“I can do that.” Dean squeezed Castiel’s shoulder. “Let me go shower before I get started.”
“That’s what I like to hear.” Kevin called over a couple that had been walking past. “Hey, guys, come meet one of the stars of the show.”
Castiel smiled at the mention of Dean. “Dean has made my life so much easier. He’s always there when I need him. He’s an incredible dad to Claire.” Castiel furrowed his eyebrows. “I’m not sure that he realizes he’s as much Claire’s father as I am. I think he’s afraid to believe that because of everything that happened with Ben.”
“This is unreal,” Castiel said, tracing his fingers just an inch over the page. “It’s so vivid, so clear. I feel like this thing will come to life if I close my eyes.”
As soon as he hung up, Dean asked, “What’s going on?”
“I shouldn’t have lied to you,” Castiel said, his voice serious yet tentative. “All those times that I pushed you to talk to Lisa was me trying to get her to tell you the truth so I would feel better about keeping it from you. You're my best friend, Dean. You’re my family. And I need you to know that I’m here for you. I don’t know what’s going on with that man, but whatever happens, just know I’m always going to be here.”
“I won’t tell anyone you have sweaty hands,” Dean said.
“Well, I do,” Dean said, taking Castiel’s hand as they walked back to the car. “So maybe you can invite your boyfriend over for a swim.”
“I am. Six months. Her name is Jessica.”
“Do you want to step outside?” Dean asked. “We can look around, maybe we’ll find—”
Dean pushed the strawberries away and looked Castiel in the eyes.
“Your brother?”
“Ben, do you want to take a break from walking Dandy to go and play?” Castiel asked.
Dean hadn’t meant to let that slip out. He realized he’d said too much. “Why is everyone so obsessed with the guy anyway? I’m the only one that has to put up with him.”
Ben threw him a smile and he looked just like his mother. Sometimes, Dean was sure Ben looked a little bit like him, too.
Dean smiled a little. “Me too. I’m actually in Illinois.”
When they got outside, they stood on the sidewalk, awkward for the first time. Castiel wasn’t sure, but he had a feeling that Dean was trying to get closer. And then he did, and they were standing so close Castiel could feel Dean’s breath on his cheek.
“Humor me,” Castiel said, pulling out of the parking lot and onto the road. He never once took his eyes off the road.
When Dean was done brushing, he grinned at Castiel in the mirror. Castiel narrowed his eyes. Dean winked. And then he was gone.
“Hey there,” Dean said. “It’s nice to meet you.”
“We’re not putting a TV in our bathroom. You said you wouldn’t take long in the shower. I’ll be waiting for you.” Castiel pulled out his phone. “I’m dialing.”
“What? Cas, didn’t you read the article?”
things. “I, uh, wasn’t sure what to ask.”
“Right under the tree,” Dean said. “Next to Crowley.”
“What the hell did you do to yourself, Dean?” That was Lisa. She was furious as she stalked over to Dean. “Do you think you’re a fucking child? Why the hell did you endanger yourself and your family?”
Castiel touched Dean’s arm, caressing it gently. “I promise I will make sure loving me is never terrifying. I just want you to be happy, Dean. I feel fortunate that I get to be the one to make you happy. For a while, I was so worried that you’d end up falling in love with someone else.”
Castiel laughed again.
Castiel ran his tongue over his lip in a way that made Dean ache. “I’ll see you tomorrow. Sleep well.”
“Would you stop interrogating him?” Castiel asked Anna. “Leave him alone. He’s not wrong about the space issue. I haven’t gotten rid of Amelia’s belongings. There isn’t much room right now.”
Dean threw him a look. “Hey, that wasn’t my fault.”
“Me too,” Dean said. “I miss going out for drives. I used to do this a lot back when I wasn’t a dad. It always cleared my mind, but it was kinda lonely.”
“It wasn’t nothing,” Castiel assured him. “You went above and beyond. Thank you, Dean.”
Dean shrugged. “She was also my best friend, and you two were a perfect couple, and now she’s gone, and I’m still here, and how is that fair?”
“Oh, right,” Castiel said, smiling. “I suppose I’m having an off day.”
. When people talk about horror movies, they usually refer to the poorly made, gory-filled nonsense that gets put out nowadays. I only watch them for the sake of watching new horror content. I’m a big fan of the classic horror films. Amelia thinks that’s highly pretentious of me, but I can’t help what I love. I grew up watching them. They’ve been the best escape from reality time and time again. Well, that and books.”
. Even though it had been the most embarrassing thing they’d ever done with each other, it was still worth remembering. They’d been all over each other even back then.
Castiel checked the time on his phone. “I should be ready to go in about an hour, so let’s say 6:30 pm.”
: What? Do you need me to bring you something?
The moment
Castiel scoffed. “I bought those for Gabriel. He loves Cheerios. I don’t.”
In the evening, they ate burgers for dinner while watching the sunset. There was nothing better than this. Dean couldn’t remember a time when he’d felt this relaxed. With Ben and Castiel, Dean could let his guard down. He didn’t need to pretend to be doing okay because when he was with them, he always felt great. The only regret Dean had was not bringing his fishing equipment because that would have been the icing on top. Regardless, it had been a fantastic day.
“When did you say the doors will open?” Castiel asked.
“I’m a demon. Deal with it.”
“Ditto.” Charlie scrunched her nose. “This is why I exclusively kiss girls.”
Castiel blinked. “Would you prefer to do it in the dark?”
As much as people kept telling him that, Dean’s fingers didn’t hurt any less. “Whatever. Did you come here just to gloat about your guitar playing prowess?”
And then there was Anna. She hadn’t gone back to Dean’s house after the funeral. She was lingering around Dean at all times, like she couldn’t stay away from him. Castiel knew that Anna wanted nothing more than to get Dean in bed with her. But the mere thought of Anna and Dean together made Castiel feel sick. There were so many things wrong with that scenario. And sure, Dean was an adult and he could make his own decision, especially when it came to dating. But Castiel didn’t want to have to deal with that situation on top of everything else currently going on in his life.
Of all the crazy shit Dean had heard today, that made the top of the list. How could that giant winged man be an angel? But Dean kept his thoughts to himself. It didn’t matter that bird-men were killing people all of a sudden, Dean still had his marriage to save. Arguing with Castiel about the plausibility of evil killer angels wouldn’t help his situation.
Castiel smiled. “Yeah, well they didn’t. But then years later, I met Amelia.” Castiel knew that Amelia had already told Dean about the day they’d met, but Castiel wanted to tell his own version of the story. “We met at a library. I had just finished writing my first manuscript, but I’d been having trouble finding an agent. So I spent hours at the library looking at the other horror comedy books out there in order to research agents and publishing houses. It was a lot of work, but I was dedicated to my craft so I did it.”
It was a picture of Castiel’s cat sleeping on Castiel’s bed. Or what Dean assumed was Castiel’s bed. There was a message underneath.
Robert gave Castiel a hug that was also unexpected. “I know how much you loved my daughter, Castiel. I know this can’t be easy on you. But we’re here now. You’re not alone, son.”
Chuckling, Castiel pulled away. “You have no idea how much I wish Dean and Claire were with me right now. I don’t think I know how to be away from them. But it’s been a huge relief seeing both of you. This has been the highlight of my tour.”
Instead Dean relented. Maybe it was the sincerity in Castiel’s blue eyes. Maybe it was the fact that it was obvious Castiel liked Ben, and was just providing his opinion, however aggravating it might have been at first. Or maybe it was just that Dean trusted Castiel.
Before Castiel knew it, he fell asleep with his phone against his ear.
“What brings you here tonight?” Julia asked in a smooth voice.
Dean did as he was told. His other hand was still clasped around Castiel’s hand, and then they were swaying. Dean was stiff, but Castiel didn’t seem to mind. From this close, he could smell Castiel’s minty cologne and it was a pleasant, comforting scent.
Then Castiel’s mouth was back on Dean’s mouth, tasting him some more. None of it was hurried, although it was passionate. Castiel kissed Dean like Dean was his only object of desire and Castiel couldn’t get enough of him. Castiel kissed Dean like he wanted to make sure Dean never forgot the shape of Castiel’s lips or the feel of his tongue. Castiel kissed Dean like he’d been dying to kiss him for months and now that he finally got to do this, he wasn’t going to stop until he got his fill. And all Dean could do was stand there and kiss him back with the same fervor.
Dean kissed the top of his head again. “I know, kiddo. Me neither. But Aunt Amelia knew how much you loved her.”
Amelia sighed. “I know.” She turned to Dean and muttered, “He never lets me drive fast anymore.”
Castiel nudged Dean with his elbow. When Dean looked at him, Castiel smiled so widely, his nose wrinkled. Dean couldn’t help how much he liked that.
“Can I kiss you?” Dean asked, eyes switching from Castiel’s eyes to his lips. “I’m not sure what the rules are on kissing angels.”
“Alright, sounds good. I’ll see you there after work, yeah?”
When Castiel spoke again, it was in a whisper. “Tell me.”
Dean was about to settle back on his stool when he heard his name called. When he looked up, he made eye contact with Lisa. The Lisa that started it all. “Lisa. Hi. How are you?”
“Hell yeah, you did.”
“I called Anna,” Dean said.
Amelia held his shoulder, stopping him from standing up. “Castiel, dear, you need to take care of yourself. I’m glad you found your mojo again, but you slept in this chair all night. Well, judging by the bags under your beautiful eyes, I’d say you slept half the night, if that. Go to bed. When you’re well rested you can get back to work.”
“I don’t think witches have that power,” Castiel said, resting his cheek on his hand. “Now that we know angels exist, what else do you think is out there?”
They had already gotten through half of their burgers, but Dean had finished all of his fries and had moved on to Cas’s fries. Cas didn’t seem to mind, pushing his fries closer to him, and that’s when Dean knew this whole thing had been a great idea.
Dean brushed his hand away. “Fuck you. You don’t know how I feel. You didn’t get your son ripped away out of the blue, did you? I don’t need your pity. I don’t need anyone’s pity. So just go.”
Castiel carded his fingers through Dean’s hair. “Is that what you want?”
“Give it some time.”
essential in romance.”
“Sure.” Castiel led the way outside. They tried looking for Charlie to say goodbye, but figured it was better to call her in the morning instead.
“I like small towns,” Castiel said.
“Half of a devil’s food cake and some madeleines,” Castiel said from the living room. He hadn’t followed him to the kitchen.
Thankfully, Castiel laughed it off. He leaned forward and very gently kissed Dean’s temple. His breath was minty. “Don’t say I never kiss you.”
Castiel kissed him as he entered him. The feeling of his husband inside of him was just as great as it had ever been. Dean was suddenly taken back to yesterday, when they had stopped on the side of an empty road and had sex in the back of the Impala. They didn’t do that sort of thing often, but yesterday had been the anniversary of when they’d met, and they couldn’t keep their hands off each other.
Castiel smiled. “Alright. Let’s try this on so we can get out of here.”
“Hey, Castiel,” Sam said with a smile. “Welcome home.”
“Are you—wait, are you quitting?” Dean asked.
“No, but you’re damned stubborn. It’s all fun and games until a fire starts in your backyard.”
They walked through the house, asking more questions and hoping for more answers. Castiel decided not to ask anymore questions, but he was happy to hold the voice recorder. They heard something fall from the master bedroom when they were in the guest bedroom. Dean led the way, and they found a book on the floor. When Dean picked it up, he pointed out that it was a Bible, which unnerved Castiel. He shivered, but he hoped no one noticed.
“You told me before that your relationship with your sister isn’t that bad. We don’t have to call your mom, just her. Anna, right?”
Dean locked eyes with Castiel, and then laughed. “Not really. But why do you like calling me dumb?”
“You should also check Castiel’s Twitter.”
“Fuck. Fucking hell.” Castiel dug his fingers in his hair, feeling breathless. His racing heart was ready to explode, but he tried to keep calm on the outside. Rubbing the tears from his eyes, Castiel went back inside.
“I’m fine,” Castiel said, closing his eyes briefly.
“Don’t you want to?”
Castiel looked at her thinking he could not love her more. “Ames, no one could have prevented this from happening. Lisa made her choice, probably as soon as she first contacted Benjamin online. It must have been so easy for her to just pick up and leave Dean behind.”
“You want a beer?”
Dean pointed his fork at Castiel. “Hey, shut it.”
“A beer would be great, thanks,” Castiel said.
Dean went back out to sit by the fire beside Castiel, who was roasting another marshmallow. “This is nice, isn’t it?”
“Why not? It’s comfy.”
Dean blinked, momentarily stunned. “Wait, what does that mean? We’re actually going to publish this?”
Claire was babbling something nonsensical, shaking her legs like she liked to do.
Dean felt like such an idiot. He was being so obvious about the effect Castiel had on him. It was supposed to be Dean’s secret. There was no way in hell that Dean would ever tell Castiel how much he wanted him. How he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about how glorious it would be if Castiel ever considered giving Dean a chance to make him happy. But he was currently doing a terrible job of concealing his feelings.
“Hey, eggs are done,” Dean said. “Just waiting on the bacon to finish frying.”
Dean smiled and winked at him, swiping his greasy fingers over Castiel’s cheek. “Love your peach fuzz.”
“Where is his mother?”
“What if you resent me down the road?”
Dean shook his head. “I knew this free lunch was a setup.”
“I know!” Amelia said. “Only time I’ve considered divorcing him.” She laughed. “No, not really. But I told him ‘fuck no.’ She’s my baby, too. I’m not getting rid of her.”
Dean wouldn’t be seeing Castiel until Wednesday for his final. He’d been studying for days, but he didn’t feel ready yet. With that excuse in mind, Dean went to Castiel’s office. They didn’t have plans for lunch today, but Dean figured an impromptu visit would be fine. He really did want to talk about the final.
Castiel picked up his fork and took a bite of the cake, smiling wider. “Well, good thing you don’t have to worry about that anymore.”
“How’s it going, Cas?” Dean asked, trying to sound casual. It wasn’t working.
“Dean?”
“Dean, how are you feeling?” Castiel had a scrape on his left cheek.
Dean turned around. Before he stepped away, Castiel grabbed Dean’s forearm to stop him. A slight tug was all Dean needed to lean forward and give Castiel his full attention again.
“We got it all done. Seriously, Dean, you didn’t have to do this.”
“I just feel like so much has changed,” Anna said with a frown. “Last time I was here, I found out for the first time you had a kid, Castiel. If I hadn’t dropped by to surprise you today, I would have never known that you’re dating someone new. A man. You’re dating a man. A man I tried to sleep with.”
Castiel took his seat, still not saying a word to Dean. Out of the corner of his eye, Dean saw Castiel take a long gulp of his red wine.
“In a minute,” Benjamin said. “I could use a drink first.”
“Stop the car,” Dean snapped.
Castiel glared at him. “Brace yourself.”
On the other hand, Dean was enraged at Castiel’s bastard of a father. During his lifetime, the man did his best to make Castiel feel awful as often as he could. Castiel reached out to him plenty of times, only to be constantly rejected. Dean had only stood back and watched as Castiel tried to reconnect with his father time and time again, up until the day he died. Dean had often wondered if Castiel had changed because he never fixed his relationship with his father, but he’d never imagined
Back in the hotel, Dean was wide awake. The room was completely dark, and Dean and Castiel lied on their own separate beds. It hadn’t been bad at all sharing a bed with Castiel, but it made more sense for them to get their own beds. Dean turned in Castiel’s direction, trying to see if he was awake or not. He could only see his silhouette in the darkness, and nothing more.
“Cas.”
“We’re doing this,” Anna said, taking Dean on another warm embrace.
“I just can’t believe it worked,” Castiel said.
Dean grabbed two Cokes from the fridge and once the grilled cheese sandwiches were ready, they went out to the front porch. Fall was turning into winter, but they still had a few cool days that were nice and breezy. It was a bit chilly outside today, so they grabbed two blankets to drape over their legs while they sat on the porch swing and ate. They left the door open so they could listen to the music blasting inside.
“You can try. But I make no promises.”
They all changed into their rented bowling shoes. And then, it was time to play.
Dean put his phone back in his pocket and looked up. This professor looked older than Charlie. He wore gray slacks, a blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and a gray waistcoat. His dark hair was in disarray, and he wore a pair of blue-frame glasses. He squinted as his gaze traveled the classroom, almost like he was taking in everyone’s faces at once. When he locked eyes with Dean, Dean smiled, but the professor simply continued looking at all the others.
“Oh, I’m not hiding them. I’m showing them off.”
“I’ll sleep tonight.” Castiel took another sip, wanting the caffeine to kick in already. His eyelids felt heavy every time he blinked.
“Yeah, she’s getting pretty good at that.”
“Please tell me you’ve never used that line on women before.”
“Why don’t we all stay in one room?” Dean asked. “You know, since this place is the perfect setting for a slasher film.”
Dean shot him a glare. “Hey, this is between me and my boyfriend.”
Castiel sipped his tea again. “I think I have my new book. I have most of the backstory down, but I still need to come up with a clear outline, side characters, and a plot. I need to get back to work.”
“I wasn’t, but I am now,” Cas said, back on his feet. “Where are we going?”
“I know,” Castiel said, voice quiet. “I know, okay? I just don’t know what to do with everything. I don’t like the thought of going through all of her things. There’s too much to go through. Too many memories. I was going to ask Dean for help, but it must have slipped my mind.”
“You read my mind.”
Charlie laughed. “Yeah, Dean, but I actually want to
And it was because this felt so perfect and so surreal that Dean decided he could trust Castiel with his past, too. “You remember that deadbeat dad I mentioned a while back?”
Dean chuckled, facing Jess. “Am I healthy enough to be discharged, doc?”
“Cas, I love it.”
Sam frowned. “You know I would love to, but I can’t. I’m working on a big case. This couple has four children, and the father is fighting dirty for custody. I’m representing the mother, and I’m working overtime to make sure she’s able to keep her children and get financial support from her rich husband.”
Castiel stared at Dean for a moment. “You know way too much about this topic.”
“I’m not drunk,” Castiel assured him, and that might have been true because he didn’t slur any of his words. “I just want you.”
Dean waved a hand. “We’ve got it all covered. Not just us. As soon as the neighborhood found out yesterday, they’ve been pitching in. Everyone loved Amelia. They want to help out in any way they can. I told you, Cas, all you need to worry about is yourself. Do it for Claire, yeah?”
“On a date,” Castiel said. “Isn’t it obvious?”
Dean looked back at Castiel, helplessly devastated. Castiel wanted nothing more than for this not to be true. He wanted to go back a few minutes to the Dean that laughed so hard he spilled his drink. But he didn’t have magical powers. Castiel could only stand by as Dean went through this new heartbreak.
Dean parked and stepped outside, leaning against the Impala as he waited. Sam would be easy to spot among the crowds. He was usually the tallest one. It didn’t take long before Dean spotted Sam, tucking his long hair behind his ear and rolling his suitcase. Beside him, Jess looked short, but she wasn’t short at all. Everyone was short next to Sam. Jess’s hair was blond and curly, and she grinned widely when she noticed Dean.
“Cas said he didn’t trust you?”
“Take care, Bobby,” Dean said, watching with concern as Bobby left the diner.
Castiel looked at him. “Maybe not, but you’re just as beautiful.”
“Interesting,” Dean said, switching to Castiel’s other cheek. “Is it something supernatural?”
It was close to 9 P.M. when Dean spotted Castiel and a few other people walking out of the school. Castiel spotted the Impala instantly and approached it. He opened the passenger door and got in.
. Dean was convinced that the only reason he’d gotten stuck at the back corner of the floor right next to Castiel was because his boss hated him. A few years ago, Dean had hooked up with Lisa, a beautiful woman Crowley had been after. Lisa would have never paid any attention to an old man like Crowley, but that didn’t make him any less delusional.
“We are two friends who are raising a baby together,” Castiel said, easily.
. All of Dean’s favorites in his very own room. There were also shelves filled with books, movies, and CDs. His bed was a large Queen, with a peach-colored comforter. There was a dresser, and even a desk with a blank sketchpad on top.
“It’s my house too, isn’t it?” Castiel walked straight to their bedroom.
Dean shrugged. “I’ll get on a plane for you.” Dean was running on pure adrenaline at the moment, so the idea of getting in a plane was the least terrifying thought in his mind.
After the Q&A, Castiel did a book signing. The line was long, stretching around the entire library, and Castiel was patiently signing every book, sometimes even with a dedication. Dean understood now why Castiel had said that there was no way of really knowing how long they would take.
Castiel knew that Dean was only saying that to calm him down, but it was working. Castiel touched Claire’s forehead again, but it was still as hot as before. “Why is the Tylenol not working yet?”
Was he worried about that? It seemed like he was at one point. But now? “I don’t know. I know that I don’t wanna be just friends, obviously. Now that I have this, I couldn’t give it up. I couldn’t give you up.”
Dean raised his eyebrows. “What? This? No, not at all. I spend most of my time drawing at work. But I definitely don’t get paid for it.”
After saying his goodbyes to everyone, Dean approached him, touching a hand to Castiel’s arm. “We have a slight change of plans.”
Castiel went to bed, his thoughts racing and revolving around the angel in his new story. He thought that sleep would never come, but as soon as he was under the covers, he passed out.
Dean laughed exasperatedly as he fumbled with the sheets to climb out of the couch, making a ruckus all the while. “Coming!” he called to Sam. “Go to sleep,” he said to Castiel as he walked past. “I got it from here.”
Oh, God. He was losing it. Again. He was losing it. He didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know how to hide this. He couldn’t breathe because the oxygen was all gone. He had a boulder on his chest and it was weighing down on him. There was nothing but pitch black surrounding him. But he could hear Anna’s voice in the distance.
“Ben and Claire are playing in Ben’s room,” Castiel said. And then he called out for Ben.
Lisa walked away, falling onto a chair beside Benjamin.
Castiel nodded. “Yeah, I guess I see your point.”
“Esther!” Dean was so thankful that she’d answered on the second ring. “Esther, what’s the matter? Is everything okay? Is Cas okay?”
“Oh, you love it.”
Castiel looked at her, unamused. “I promised Dean I’d be nice to you, but don’t push it. What do you want to do today?”
“Right. So what did you do?”
Dean groaned, rubbing his weary eyes. “Why are you so fucking annoying? I’m just trying to sleep. I’m fucking tired, man.”
“You humans have a way of making ultra-complicated matters sound fairly simple,” Gabriel said, grinning. He waved his lollipop at Dean. “I kinda like you.”
“No,” Dean said, watching the flames of the burning car, covering his nose as they neared the explosion area. His chest was puffing and his eyes were filled with anxiety. Castiel squeezed his hand.
And then, Castiel lost it.
“Anywhere. You drive.”
“What happened?” Dean asked.
A drive with Dean sounded appealing. Castiel initially worried that it would feel more like he was running away from his problems, but it could simply be a chance to clear his head. If it worked for Dean, it could also work for Castiel.
“Demon?” she guessed.
“I believe her,” Dean said, crossing his arms. He almost looked defiant. Similar to how Lisa had looked before.
“Huh. What’s her name?”
“Oh, for crying out loud!” Dean yelled, pressing the button labeled Call.
“I knew you’d break.”
“I’m not denying anything. Cas and I are together. We’ve been for some time now.”
again, he was looking forward to his full days. He was actually looking forward to his fourteen-hour work days. At least it would get him out of the house.
New School Records had opened up about a week ago, two blocks from Dean’s apartment. It was ridiculously perfect timing since Dean needed to find a Led Zeppelin album by tomorrow. The place was also conveniently located next to a candy store that sold those really chewy gummy bears so things were looking up for Dean.
“What else did Ben tell you about the angels?” Dean asked, breaking the silence.
Lisa motioned to the front door. “You think we can go inside and talk? I’ve been standing here for a while, and I need to use the bathroom.”
“Here’s your beers,” Randy said, narrowing his eyes at the bald man. “Stow it, Jack. You’re scaring off my customers.”
“Making tea.” Dean motioned to the boxes of teas on the counter. “Which one do you want tonight?”
Dean breathed. “Thanks. Hey, stick close to me. Just in case.” Dean worried Castiel would think he was being too clingy, but Castiel nodded, like Dean didn’t really have to ask that.
“The Girl with a Pearl Earring is better than the Mona Lisa. Fight me.”
“Do you want to come home with me?” Dean asked, inching slightly away to be able to catch Castiel’s eyes.
Castiel laughed. “You’re far too invested in this. It’s kind of sweet.”
Anna was already in Naomi’s new room. It seemed as though she kept being put into a new room every day. At least this room was a lot less gloomy than the rest with the big, open window.
Castiel looked immediately intrigued. “What was it?”
“Well, well, well, if it isn’t Clarence, in all his grace and glory.” The dark-haired woman was short, dressed in a tracksuit. She looked ready for a fight, or to run a marathon if it came to it. Her crooked smile was warm and genuine when she spotted Castiel.
“Are you scared you’ll get fired?”
Eventually, Castiel made it out of bed, and he went through his morning routine before he stepped into the kitchen where Dean was making breakfast while Claire sat in her high chair at the table.
“Counting cars,” Castiel said.
“Absolutely.”
Dean grinned. “Hey, baby girl. How’s your Uncle Sam treating you? Is he feeding you alright? What about Aunt Jess? Have you been playing with Scoob?”
“Ash—”
Anna waved them away. “I’ll watch her. You guys go ahead.”
Lisa was back?
The rest of the evening wasn’t as awful as the beginning had been. They ate their dessert, making awkward small talk. Castiel found it hard to stop gazing at Dean, who was already gazing at him. Castiel could still feel Dean’s lips on his neck. He wondered what else Dean would have done if they hadn’t been interrupted. Castiel wished that they’d had one more minute alone. It might take Dean another two weeks to make a move on Castiel again.
“Let’s take the elevator. It’s just one floor.”
Castiel chuckled, his breath hitting the back of Dean’s neck, sending shivers down his spine. His arm around Dean tightened. “I like having you this close. Just you, me, and India Jones.”
Sam gasped. “You’re
Dean had known that question was coming. “I realized I don’t really like those guys. They’re not really my friends.”
But then, Dean heard the familiar song with the French words. Dean looked up at Cas with a question on his face. He was only joking when he asked, “Are you trying to seduce me, Cas?”
Sam nodded, digging his hands in his hair.
It took a moment for Castiel to process that question. “You want to go to bed with me?”
Castiel finished tying his shoes and then raised an eyebrow at Dean. “Are you prepared to lose, Winchester?”
Dean shrugged easily. “You were staring at me a little weird. You got something on your mind?”
“I trust you.”
). Dean pulled out a stack of gift cards from his coat draped over the couch and handed one to each person. “I know, I’m the thoughtless asshole that gives out gift cards.”
“Good morning, Dean,” Castiel said in a gravelly voice that made him even more irresistible. Dean drew him closer.
“He’s sleeping. I just thought you should know the truth. I knew this plan was bound to fail from the start, and I’m gonna do whatever I can to get Dean to slow down. I hope I can count on you to have my back on this.”
They got on the highway with the windows rolled down, but Aaron’s hair wasn’t blowing in the wind. It was too short for that. Dean turned up the music, but a few minutes later Aaron turned it down.
“Cas!” Dean screamed, maneuvering in the tight space to crawl in front of him, trying to shake him awake.
