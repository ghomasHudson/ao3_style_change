"My, uh, my friend," John says. "Here, let's get you into a fresh t-shirt. Come on."
Sherlock blinked in confusion. "I saw it clearly. You were complaining about how much of the bed I take up—which, incidentally, I find extremely irritating as well—and that you haven't had the privacy to masturbate since I hatched."
"I want to work lube into your hole, opening it up for me so that when I breach your body, you can hear the slick squelch as my cock stretches the walls of your rectum, making way for me. I love a slow, filthy fuck, to make it last long enough that we need another round of lube. I want to bend you in half, and fuck you so hard that a grunt is forced out of you every time I drive my hips forward and split your body with my cock."
"Whips, maybe," Gerald says, his cheeks pinking in a way that makes John want to lean forward and kiss him. "Dog collars, definitely not. My clients don't come to me for sex. They come to work out their issues."
"I can't cure you from being in love, Sherlock," Dr. Reed says.
"Gerald is all moony and in love, and you've got that fucking
For ninety seconds, he watches Sherlock, but Sherlock's eyes stare right through him, even though they appear to be tracking something behind him, and John turns around as though something is actually

"Oh, for
Sherlock grunted. His eyes were closed and his head was pillowed on the coils of his tail, but he hadn't stopped chewing.
"It's all right. Just—keep your claws away when you're around me, okay?" John petted him, stroking from head to rump. "Now, see? Isn't this nice?"

"I don't get off on spanking or anything like that," John mutters, but his dick is saying
"I just need to—" Sherlock continues, his breath catching on the words. "I know I can make you feel—does he make you feel like this? Because I can, too. I know you want me, John. I've known that for two years. I want you to love me, too."
Tate doesn’t talk during the drive to their hotel, and Sherlock gradually begins to relax. He needs to get out and walk the French Quarter and surrounding area, to breathe in the smell of New Orleans and interact with her people, to immerse himself in this city of contradictions. New Orleans is a fusion of decadence and innocence, of darkness and light. New Orleans is a metaphor for Sherlock and John.
Sherlock said reverently. There was a pause and then,

for a row. Now that Sherlock has gained weight, and his bruises have faded, John's concern has diminished considerably, making room for his anger and resentment.
"All right Sean?" Gregory asked Chatsworth, giving him his hand to shake. Then he moved to shake John's hand. "Nice to meet you. Call me Greg. Only Mycroft calls me Gregory."
Sherlock nods, though he doesn't want to. The only reason Mycroft let him come home, though, is because he promised he would give John all the information on his treatment.
, and leaves Sherlock gasping, coming hard, silently, but for a grunt right before his body goes rigid. John's semen is streaked on both of them, and Sherlock would bet a thousand pounds that the entire encounter, from the moment Sherlock woke up until he came, lasts less than ten minutes.
“Just this once, please, let me have this,” Sherlock says.
"Well, yeah."
Gerald is confident without being arrogant, but this display of shyness leaves John giddy. It's been months since he's been with someone – over a year, actually, since he's kissed anyone and longer than that since he's had a good shag. Well,
"If I might offer a bit of advice?"
"Then you saw his entire body, including his genitals?"
John grins. "Babies do have that effect on people."
Sherlock lifts his head and sees John crouched underneath the window, swiping tears off his face, but the tears keep coming and coming, dripping down his face, huge fat tears, yet John is
John frowns. "Why did you do it?"
. Sherlock knows they're meaningless words, the kinds of things people say when someone is bawling like a child, and he would've found them ridiculous eighteen months ago. Now, though, he takes great comfort in this soothing litany of meaningless words. It's not the words themselves that matter because they all mean the same thing—
"The thought of coming home to you kept me going—that, and the small bit of hope I carried with me that, if I were just brave enough to tell you, brave enough to push past your
“Sherlock, I can't,” John says, breathing hard.
"I'm not angry at you for lying," John says kindly.
. John is whispering
Sherlock raises his eyes to John's face.
"Ah. Well." There's another pause. "As a sufferer of post-traumatic stress disorder, I'm sure you realize my brother will likely experience many of the same symptoms you had."
John has often compared the voices of Gerald and Sherlock. They both have deep voices, but where Sherlock's was a rumbling almost-bass, Gerald's is a clear baritone. Gerald's voice is sweet; Sherlock's voice was sultry.
about John most likely, and this is how John rewards him—a confession of infidelity and the end of their relationship.
John finds Sherlock upstairs in the second-floor bedroom sitting motionless on the edge of the bed. He's pulled on pajama bottoms, but his back is bare, and the raised pink lines of his still healing scars remind John of his dream, and he shudders. He stands in front of Sherlock who's staring at the floor, holding his hands limply in his lap, and waits without speaking, keeping his distance.
"Oh," Sherlock says, blinking, his outrage arrested. "I see."
"You won't have sex in his bed but you will have sex up here, surrounded by his things?"
John goes ahead and toes off his shoes and then pulls off his socks, tucking them into one of his shoes. He pushes himself upright again and then looks around the dining room table and sees the wine rack. It's a proper one, too, holding at least a dozen different bottles from dark red to barest champagne color. John knows nothing about wines, either, but he knows what he likes so he picks a Merlot. The tools of wine-drinking are displayed in a box, nestled in velvet. Clearly Gerald entertains often. The dining room table only seats four but there's a line in the middle indicating a drop leaf.
John went out first, hoping to avoid glimpsing too many naked bums, but Sherlock skipped ahead. John resolutely kept his eyes above Sherlock's neck. They ended up in a large clearing far away from the house.
"I'm sorry," John says, and tries not to look into Sherlock's eyes or at the pile of goods on the bed, but then Sherlock pulls back, and says incredulously, "I mean,
John asks Sherlock about his kink, but then fumbles it very badly.
When he wakes, Mycroft makes him eat again and then he allows the agents back in for another three hours. Despite the fact that Mycroft's mollycoddling drags the process out longer than he wants it to, Sherlock is grateful. Usually, by the end of the three-hour sessions, he's having a hard time answering questions. His body is so exhausted and his mind isn't much better.
"Sorry," John says.
"And was this - was Cyril one of them?"
The people disperse. John tries to get to his feet. His head hurts and his hands and elbows are scraped from his accident with the bicycle. John kneels on the sidewalk and stares at Sherlock's blood. Sherlock is dead. He gets to his feet. Sherlock's blood is on the toe of his left shoe.
"Shut up," Gerald says with mock petulance. "Therapists need to talk about their feelings, too, you know."
“To Sherlock,” Cyril says, holding the glass of champagne up high. “For coming back from the dead. Because if he hadn’t, our partners would still be stuck with each other rather than where they belong.”

"It means I'm comfortable in either role. At heart, Dominance and submission is about a transference of power and I'm equally comfortable having it or giving it up."
"Through there's the bathroom," Gerald says, nodding to the door on the right.
Sherlock is uncharacteristically shy, which means every person here comes up to John at some point and says a variation of,
A growl works its way out of Sherlock's throat. He's nervous enough without having to sit in the taxi, imagining all the ways this could go wrong.

Sherlock is bone weary. He's been away from home for five hundred and thirty-six days and hasn't seen a friendly face in over six months. He misses London. He misses his flat and Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade and even Mycroft. Most of all, of course, he misses John. He carries John with him every second of those five hundred and thirty-six days. He doesn't remember what John's laugh sounds like anymore but he remembers the look on John's face when he tells Sherlock he's brilliant or when he watches Sherlock play the violin or staring Sherlock down when he's misbehaved.
Gerald is vibrating with barely suppressed fury, but John doesn't lower his gaze, knowing every minute of Gerald's anger he endures is only what he deserves.
"Yes."
(See the end of the chapter for
At last, Sherlock is disgorged from the cab and stands in front of an iron gate. With resolve, he breathes in, opens the gate, walks through and latches it. The walk to the front door is short. He raises his hand. He knocks. The door opens.

battered and used. Now sit your arse down. I'll go make the tea. Oh, and Holmes?" John turned in the doorway between the kitchen and sitting room and said, very quietly, "Don't you dare touch that fucking egg or I'll dislocate every one of your fingers."
John squeezes Sherlock's hand once, and then lets go.
"Oh, I can form plenty of opinions. But I can't let it stop me from doing my job as best I can. That's where ethics or morality comes in. Life is valuable, ergo all life should be considered valuable, not just the ones I think deserve it. I'd really like to wrap my hands around the neck of MH for denying you the company of people who can understand you, but killing is against my ethics."
"Get the fuck out," John grunted.
"I would expect you to be happier about the press conference," he says. "After all, it means I'll be out of your hair."
Gerald chuckles. "I'm a therapist, remember? I've always been that way, the person my friends and family come to when they need to talk. I think it's because I have an open face and an unthreatening personality. People can tell I'm not going to judge them or try to fix them."
“I hate to break the mood, but I have to get my trousers off or my cock is going to be permanently damaged by my zipper," Sherlock says, sucking in a breath through his teeth when John bites his lip and grinds down several more times, drawing heavy groans out of Sherlock's mouth.
Sherlock knows John got off his shift at six and will only have enough time to run home, shower, and change before he has to be at the party. So Sherlock times his arrival home so that he just misses John. That gives him several hours to get settled back home and find something
John, needlessly as it turned out, since John failed to answer.
"I'll give you two ibuprofens. I don't want to give you narcotic pain medicine more often than every six hours. Speaking of which, should I be worried about addiction?"
"I do want to, though," John says out of the blue.
There's silence for a minute before Sherlock sighs and says, "I would not agree to make a deal to exchange your sexual obeisance for my attendance at a social gathering of your friends because it would backfire. In case you need reminding, the results of the last deal we made is still charted on a spreadsheet on my hard drive, and you didn't like that one either," says Sherlock, low and serious.

“Obviously,” Sherlock says and doesn’t have to fake the imperious note in his voice. Men like Blaine love men like Sherlock. It’s a simple example of wanting what you can’t have except in this case, Blaine gets to have him.
"Long day?" John asks.
"Yes, Sherlock. You're handsome," John said flatly. His jaw tensed and his eyes prickled and where his heart and lungs were, it felt like someone had scooped him out. Sherlock was ecstatic but John wanted privacy, a chance to mourn what he'd lost.

to help him because it meant drawing their attention to me. I was weak."
Gerald smooths the tips of his two middle fingers over John's brow and down his cheekbone and around his jaw and then his hand picks up speed, his whole palm sliding around John's neck to his nape and then John is being kissed roughly and Gerald, who works his arms every day beating people, puts his arms around John and flips him onto his back.
. It's not just that, however—John's infidelity is the cause of the breakup, and Sherlock is to blame for John's infidelity.
"Sherlock, sit in your chair properly," Mycroft admonished without looking up from his paper.

John stuffs the bowl, notebook and matchbox in his coat pockets, pushes himself up and holds a hand out for Gerald. John pulls him into a bruising hug. He buries his face in Gerald's neck.
"Wait a minute, Sherlock. You want me to
"Killed myself," Sherlock says flatly, refusing to meet John's eyes.
John reflexively snatched his hand back upon reading that last sentence. But as he stared at the egg in mounting wonder, the desire to lay his hand back upon it began as an itch between his shoulder blades. He slid his hand back over the hot contour of the arrestingly attractive egg and a faint smug

Ten minutes later, John and Sherlock came back out of the bedroom. John's face was so red he looked as though he'd been sunburned. Sherlock was obviously desperately trying

go downstairs, but he's afraid he'll go to John's room, fall into his bed, and weep, so he stays upstairs.
In this life, though, the concern breaks through some of the wall Sherlock is trying to erect to keep John from seeing him cry. It's bad enough that Sherlock spilled all that shit out last night. John already thinks he's broken. He doesn't need any more proof.
John's brain panicked again. He thought
John smiles uncertainly, and Sherlock nods before turning to the loo door.
"Do you want to play, John?" Gerald asks.
He pours a little gel into his palm, rubs it between both hands to warm up and then wraps a hand around John's half-erect penis and strokes a couple of times. He wraps the other hand around John's penis and strokes. John's cock loves Gerald's hands and wants to make sure he knows that, so it stiffens and purrs against his hand as he strokes it.
John makes for the shower while Sherlock's distracted by brotherly staring contest between himself and Mycroft.
to ask John any questions, but he was nearly vibrating with curiosity.
“He didn't tell you everything, did he?"
"Just answer the question, John."

For someone who's been malnourished and subjected to torture for a month, Sherlock is surprisingly strong and when John wiggles slightly to get out of his arms, he just tightens his hold. Then Sherlock crashes his lips into John's and the hand that was above his arse slides over it and then grips it,
Sherlock is shaking so hard his teeth are chattering. His heartbeat is thunderous… how can John not hear it? Sherlock rushes to the flat door and locks it, then does the same for the kitchen door. Then he runs back to his chair, but John is nowhere to be found. Sherlock's so pumped full of adrenaline that his toes and face are completely numb.
"Yes, but it will help sooth the pain. And we'll watch television after this, yeah?"

sake!" John says, his face turning red. He hides his grin behind the pint glass in his hand.
John wasted no time grabbing a couple bath towels. He spread them out on the seat of his chair.
Sherlock does a body check and discovers that, yes, actually, he's in a great deal of pain. "Yes," he says and smiles wanly.
. He could hear the echo of that voice whining out his name. The pain hit, but it was less powerful than it had been. Was it because there was no specific memory? Or was the spell losing its power?
The lube launcher looks like an old fashioned syringe, except pale blue and plastic. Sherlock pulls the injector out without slipping his fingers through the loops on the handle, and stares into the dispenser like he expects to find something gross, and considering Sherlock's affinity for leaving petri dishes with gross things around, it would have to be quite disgusting. Finding nothing, he pushes the injector back into the dispenser, and lets it dangle from one of the loops of the handle.
“Holmes here’s British. They’re a little more…
"Yes," Sherlock says, staring at his shaking hands.
"Hm," Sherlock says noncommittally, his expression pained. He shifts his eyes to the side and shrugs.
"Because Gerald himself was in love with his best friend. And he was always going to be a tiny bit in love with someone else, and a tiny bit emotionally unavailable."
"I said you wouldn't like it," Sherlock says, sounding miserable.
"Listen, I've had a shit day. Do you need me to look—?" John asks, then gestures vaguely at Sherlock's body.
"No! No, that's not—it's just a coincidence. His brother had a case for him."

"It's more like
Sherlock's jaw works back and forth. His nostrils flare. John tries to maintain a straight face. Sherlock rips his hand out of John's trousers and stalks off in the direction of the road. John unhurriedly fishes his phone out of his pocket, calls Lestrade to come pick up the suspect, and then collapses against the wall in helpless giggles while trying to get his erection under control before Lestrade arrives.
"Bruised right kidney."
Sherlock gave Chatsworth a triumphant and haughty glance and then turned and began digging stuff out of the boxes he'd brought up.
John sighs. "Yeah, I do, I just would like to eat first before I have to deal with anything else."
"Tell me, then," John says, keeping well back. "Explain it to me so I understand."
"Well, it maketh no thense. Ith totally illogical! Who puth a baby on the throne to rule a whole country!"
—I've got to come. I'm right on the edge," John says, and Sherlock lifts his head and stares hard at John, whose face is sheened with sweat, and whose hand is inching towards his fat, angry-headed cock. Sherlock nods once, pushes himself further up onto his forearms, and sucks John's purple-hot cockhead into his mouth. He keeps his fingers working inside of John, his weight balanced on that elbow, and uses the other to reach up, and gently tug John's foreskin down with his fingers. He gives John's glans little kitten licks, going from the bottom to the top. He pulls off, watching as a bead of pre-ejaculate immediately rises up in the exposed slit, and he sucks that off. He vibrates his tongue against John's frenulum, strokes gently over John's prostate, and John cries out, "I'm gonna—" and Sherlock pulls off. He strokes John gently, and when he feels John's muscles clench down tightly on his fingers, and his head tilt back, he says, "
He goes downstairs to take a shower, and make tea, which he then takes back upstairs. He sits down at the desk in the bedroom. The whole room is depressingly character-free, considering that John slept in it for eighteen months. Sherlock had been expecting a John-ish aura to pervade the room, a golden, cozy-warm net in which to nurse his bruised body and heart, but whatever presence John had in this room is gone.

"I've never heard of a dragon choosing his mate before he hatches," Chatsworth said. "But, like Mycroft said, a dragon knows and he's never wrong. Give it time, John. He seems young to you—and he is—but he'll learn and mature at an exponential rate. Much faster than a born-human."
"No!" John says, offended, ironically, that she thinks he would cheat on Gerald in some kind of bid to reclaim his heterosexuality.
John smirks and raises his eyebrow as he gets off the bed. "The condoms are downstairs," he says.
I think that's it for today
Sherlock has never particularly liked the intimacy of kissing. But
John stares over Gerald's head, his mind whirring. He runs his tongue over his bottom lip in an unconscious gesture and doesn't realize he's doing it until he hears the tiny sound of arousal that comes out of Gerald's mouth. John's eyes flick down to Gerald. John only then realizes Gerald is naked and he's partially hard. John's own erection has flagged slightly, not out of disinterest, but because he's trying to process all this new information without losing focus on the reason they're down here in the first place.
"Oh, c'mon, Sherlock, you know I didn't mean it li—"
for the moment.
John didn't bother asking when
John's voice has the power of a slap in the face to drag Sherlock back to the present, and Sherlock does exactly as John says—he looks. John slips his hand into Sherlock's pants and readjusts his erection so that it lies up against his stomach, and then puts Sherlock's pants to rights, leaving the head of his erection exposed. There's something obscene about having just the tip of it exposed, but then John pulls the leg opening of Sherlock's pants to the side, and gently tugs one testicle out through the opening, and gives new meaning to
John takes his tea and sits down at the kitchen table to drink it, staring off into space. He has yesterday's paper spread out before him, but he's not reading it. He's remembering every detail of last night (and trying not to get hard while he's at it.)
"You mean, you thought I was using you?" John asks, slightly indignant, then realizes Gerald has only known him roughly twelve hours and has every right to ask.
On Thursday, John starts his new day shift schedule. All day, in between patients, he's distracted and on edge, trying to think of what he'll say to Gerald once he gets there. Everything he comes up with sounds too blunt, like he doesn't care, or full of platitudes, which is just insulting. No matter what he says, they all mean the same thing.
Sherlock's personal space, ergo Sherlock should thank his lucky starts John didn't beat the man to death.)
"So, do you love me back?" John asks, twining his fingers through Sherlock's.
John's genuine enthusiasm mollifies Sherlock, although he's still disappointed that John isn't as excited as he is.
"Sad, right?"
! I tried. Bernie tried. Olivia tried. They didn't believe us and were too terrified to ask each other, so—" Rebecca spreads her hands.
"It's a Friday night, lad! Anywhere from twenty to forty minutes."
"If you like," John answers, canting his hip against the wall right outside the bathroom, his arms crossed over his chest, as he looks on with amusement at the lascivious look in Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock raises his head, and looks at John, the heat in his eyes unmistakable, and John exhales, relieved that they're back on track.
John gets them clean and dries them off. Looks at the inside of Sherlock's lips, and makes him brush his teeth even though Sherlock bitches and moans about it, which John pretends is all exaggerated, even though John knows it stings like hell. When John gives him a glass of water, Sherlock drinks it, but by the time they make it to the bedroom, both of them still naked, Sherlock collapses on the bed, and almost slides off before John catches him, his lower back straining with the effort to push Sherlock back off the edge. When John pushes himself to his feet, the muscles of his lower back feel like they're trying to strain the

"Your nearness."
"Well?" John asked Mycroft.
had to lie to you lot, and I—I hated it, yeah? And
"Yes, but nonetheless," John says. Then he nods, slaps the door jamb once in a very masculine way, and disappears down the hall.
Chatsworth and Mycroft exchanged a look that John found extremely suspicious. "What? What does that look mean?"
doesn't he look bloody gorgeous!)
"Like cuddling."
And yeah, he and Gerald didn't jump immediately into the kinky things, but it was only a matter of a couple of months. He and Sherlock have been together for four months, and shouldn't he be more comfortable with Sherlock than he'd been with Gerald?
," she says loud enough to draw the attention of the bartender, who raises his eyebrows at them, and John can tell he's about to move over here to ask if they need drinks refills, and John waves him away while ignoring Rebecca who scoffs, "You're not listening to me, are you?"
John barked out a laugh, but then looked down at Sherlock and sighed. He was still soothing Sherlock with long, light sweeps of his hand from head to rump. "I hope he doesn't end up like his prat of a brother."
“No,” Blaine says, his fingers reaching up to pinch Sherlock’s lips closed. It hurts but Sherlock refuses to squirm out of Blaine’s grip. “I wanna fuck.”
. Sherlock thinks about Molly, and her stumbling, nervous unrequited love for him, and wonders if this is how she felt, knowing that he would always have
"I missed you," he whispers.
"Oh, darling," Gerald murmurs. "It's the manly ones who need to sub. I'm not asking you to sub 24/7. I have no intentions of hijacking your autonomy. My only desire in being your Dom is to help you learn about yourself. And also, the orgasms are spectacular."
"Angelo's will deliver here," John says. "Would you like Italian?"
"Angelo's will deliver here," John says. "Would you like Italian?"
"No," John mumbles. "S'fine."
"It sounds to me like you're hurt, deeply so, because your bloke had the audacity to get over you after he thought you'd died, and you're heartbroken. You sacrificed yourself for his safety, and came home to find he'd left you behind. You can’t blame PTSD for being in love with John. What you
John knows this is a rhetorical question, but he gamely shakes his head.
By early Friday morning, an exhausted John snuggled into clean sheets with an equally exhausted but clear-eyed Sherlock, the proud owner of a full set of dragon teeth.
Sherlock looks up. "If you want me to go, I'll go. I still don't see what that has to do with my kink."
"You can't!" Sherlock says, running to intercept him. He grabs John by the shoulders. "This is too important!"

"For poking you in the eye?" she chuckles.
“What happens if you don’t?” Blaine asks.
John almost breaks down in tears hearing Gerald's voice. "Where are you?"
The sad thing, the thing that makes him want to scream, and tear out his hair, and maybe shoot holes in the wall, or maybe just shoot heroin into his veins is this—Sherlock already belongs to John. That's the thing about love that he
The urge to look at Gerald and see what he's brought into the bedroom with him is overwhelming, but this isn't just about getting off, he realizes. Gerald knows something about John, that same thing that Sherlock knew, right off—John wants to have his boundaries pushed; he wants to test his limits and then go just that bit past them.

I had a rough few months in which I felt no urge to write. I'm feeling better and the writing itch allowed me to finally finish Chapter 8. My poor little Dragon!Sherlock. He's been so eager for his first time flying for so long and I left him languishing for months!
"It's all back to the rules of Succession."
"I didn't—I didn't consider it in that light. I just wanted to come home. If you're not comfortable—"
Mycroft moves into the sitting room, out of their sight, and John feels the tension drain out of Sherlock before he bustles both of them to their bedroom, dragging John on his tiptoes. Inside, Sherlock locks the door and the two of them stare at each other. Sherlock's chins multiply as he starts laughing—John snorts and then they collapse on the bed in a fit of hysterical giggles. When they're able to speak again, John says, "I'll never be able to look Mycroft in the eyes again," and Sherlock spits in abrupt laughter, setting John off again. Finally, John says, "I can't stop laughing with you here—go to the bathroom and get cleaned up. I'll go after you." Sherlock leans over to give him a noisy smack of a kiss before he goes.
"He's not working against us, Sherlock."
"Don't think I'm being sentimental, either," John says, pretending to bluff. "I'm just sorry I won't be receiving any of your awesome head."
"What do you mean what do I want to do? I want to do whatever I need to do to make him stop wanting to have sex with me!"
"N-n-n-no," Sherlock says. "Kah-kah-can in m-m-moment. Si-si-sit. Puh-please."
All through his work day, though, John can't stop thinking about the fight. He thinks of the look on Sherlock's face, the one he swore he would never put there. It's easy to lash out when you're afraid—so easy to break a promise when forced to face those fears, fears he pushed down into the subterranean depths of his mind and convinced himself they no longer had the power to hurt him.
Sherlock's tail abruptly withdrew. He slumped over on his back, all four limbs splayed, tail hanging limply over the edge of the bed and stared at the ceiling. Sherlock was particularly talented when it came to the dramatic slump. But Sherlock was also tired, in pain, and had just agreed to have a stranger in their home every day. John himself was tempted to fall back on the bed in his own slump.
Sherlock moves slowly over to his duffel bag, which John left on the settee last night. He picks through it for a t-shirt and pajama bottoms. He wants out of these fleece bottoms because they're hot. Underneath, he can feel his pants are soaked in sweat. He doesn't bother pulling a fresh pair of pants out of his bag. The less clothing he has to wear, the less he has to depend on John to get him dressed and undressed (and the less opportunity he has to do what he did last night.)
There was the blow of pain, which he weathered with a grunt. He seemed to be getting used to them—
"No," John says, looking confused, his blue eyes dilating slightly even now, being in bed with Sherlock. "I thought you'd, I don't know, actually. I don't know." He rubs his hands over his face, or tries to, and almost pokes himself in the eye with his keys. He tosses them on the floor in disgust, like they've made some key-related faux pas by not being in their proper place in John's pocket.

"Oh, yeah, I did, didn't I?" Rebecca says, scrunching her nose up before pushing her bottom lip out slightly, the picture of haughty petulance. "Well, I take it back, because Gerald got to keep you, and then you went off with that man of yours—I mean,
"Are you saying that he's—like,

John smiles a little ruefully, and nods, and feels a warm sort of fondness for Mycroft. "My point, though, is that we kept ourselves to ourselves because we wanted desperately to be
"How are you?" Gerald asks quietly, stopping a couple of feet away.
Sherlock hears the
"You've given me so much more than that." John drags the sleeve of his jacket over his eyes to clear the tears away, throat spasming around the mass of grief that's settled there.
"Fine. So, if I agree to be your sub, are you gonna, you know, spank me?"
"Mm," Gerald says, curling tighter.
, John said. Sherlock knows John told him that specifically to ease any worries Sherlock had about where he stood in John's heart in relation to Gerald.
home, in his bedroom, at 221B Baker Street.
He stops at the window, pauses a moment, trying to rein in his feelings, and finding he can't, not anymore. He feels as fragile and unsure as he did the first night home, when desperation and relief made him take John in hand, knowing it would be the only time John would allow him to break the rules without paying for it later. Oh, but he has after all, hasn't he? Paid for it?
"Like you're not the adoring aunt."
"Well, yeah."
"Indeed," Sherlock says sharply.
"It's all right," John said, stroking Sherlock from his head along his back, trying to gentle him.
Rebecca smiles, her eyes wistful. She reaches out and wraps John in her arms, her soft woman's body fitting against him in a way that feels strange after so long in a man's arms. John has hugged Rebecca on multiple occasions, but those were quick
"Yes."
. Sherlock doesn't try to kiss John, though he wants to—he simply holds tight until his body stops shaking and his mind crawls its way out of the brume of anxiety. Vision and sound seem to assault him all at once, and he clings even tighter to John. Without realizing it, Sherlock's face is pressed against John's neck and he's whisper-moaning nine words repeatedly
All unbeta'd because Jenn and Katie are being held hostage by duties that are not all about me, a circumstance I find very unfortunate but also conducive to sneaking in bits of porn.
Rebecca takes a deep breath. John looks up at her face. Her lips are pursed. She's looking him over, a frown over her forehead. She smiles wistfully.
John lost his balance, his vision flickering, and clutched the worktop to keep from falling but ended up on his arse anyway. He'd kept hold of the paper and pen, though. His eyes wandered the kitchen and noticed a shiny new food processor.
this was happening to you?" John asks, gesturing at Sherlock.
For now, though, Sherlock loses himself in a slow fuck, a long, sensual slide towards orgasm with a step that’s just above homeostasis so that his orgasm sneaks up on him, rips through him, shredding meat and bone. Fireflies of light dance to the edges of his vision and still he’s coming. Blaine fists his own dick furiously, breathing
John went into the sitting room to check on Sherlock and found him sprawled out on the carpet, dead asleep.

but comes out something like
Sherlock hardly spent any time in here except to sleep, which he only did rarely, and to dress. Okay – he did spend a lot of time dressing. John used to chide him for his vanity. John stands back up and puts the red rubber ball in his pocket. He walks to Sherlock's wardrobe and opens it. There's a bag from the cleaners that John picked up for him yesterday. Sherlock asked him to pick it up. It doesn't make sense for Sherlock to ask John to pick up his dry cleaning when he knows he's going to kill himself the next day.
"Okay, then, let's get this done," Gerald says. "I won't flinch."
John shivers, and does the little head shake again. "Virginal, I guess. Inexperienced."
"Anyway, I'm sick of being stuck with Bernie—who, need I remind you, I've known my whole life—and Olivia, especially now they've got bloody Milton to pay attention to."
John showers, then cooks two chicken breasts on the stove, boils some linguini, and whips up some Alfredo sauce with peas, onions, olives, and mushrooms. He puts together a plate for Sherlock inside a sealable plastic container and puts it in the fridge. It'll heat up fine in the microwave. He eats in front of the TV and falls asleep on the sofa. His phone alarm wakes him up in the morning. Sherlock still isn't home. There's a text message on his phone, though.
To Mycroft, John said, "Did you catch all that? So should I give you my bank info or is there paperwork for me to sign?"
“Other internal injuries?”

"But I've never seen a born-human as sensitive to magic as you apparently are. You know," he said, looking thoughtful (although seeing a thirty ton dragon with teeth as long as John's arm with such a human looking facial expression was not something John could have imagined.) "That might be why you were able not just to telepathically bond with Sherlock while he was still in the egg, but forge a mating bond."
and definitely
"John, do you think my teeth are handsome? I didn't get to see them in the mirror yet. Do you think they're more handsome when compared to other dragons' teeth?"
"I know the words
Taking a deep breath he reached—then the image was gone and he was once again kneeling over his toilet, his roiling. But, in John's memory, he saw the fuzzy image of a man with dark hair becoming a black dragon about the size of a horse.

under his breath and signals for a cab. It'll be faster that way.
"Nobody," John snapped and then glared at Chatsworth. "Don't encourage him."
"Let's call it a night," he says, giving Mycroft a meaningful look. It's subtle, but John isn't foolish enough to think it escapes Sherlock's notice. Sherlock, however, to John's surprise, shoots him a grateful look, and some of the rigidness in his body begins to loosen.
"At my
tell you, and then you jumped, and I hated myself for not saying something before. I thought maybe you'd not have jumped if you knew how I felt."
Two weeks later, off the press room at New Scotland Yard, behind the backdrop, Sherlock stands stiffly, waiting for the Big Reveal. Representatives from NSY and the Home Office are on stage singing his praises. The publicist Mycroft hired for Sherlock rocks back and forth on the balls of his feet.
John lays his hand gently on Sherlock's arm and then the tips of his fingers slide rhythmically up and down the tender skin on the inside of Sherlock's forearm. Sherlock's dick starts to react and Sherlock bites back a groan of frustration. He turns himself slightly so John can't see.
“Yes,” Sherlock says and gestures to his persistent erection. “Obviously.”
John assures her that Sherlock knew she loved him. She was the only person John ever saw Sherlock be physically affectionate with.
"I'll make sure to point that out," John says with a snort, taking a drink of his beer, resentful of the disdain he knows Sherlock must have for this part of John's life, and how unlikely it will be for them to intersect.
“You're exhausted, your body's confused,” John says, blushing furiously and avoiding Sherlock's face. “It'll go away once I start the exams.”
John checks his mobile at least once an hour throughout the day, but Sherlock never texts back. Despite his anger at Sherlock, and the bitter end to his relationship with Gerald, John loves Sherlock more than he's ever loved anyone in his life. Gerald was right—the minute Sherlock walked in the door that night, his relationship with Gerald was over.
John took a deep breath, his left hand trembling. He didn't think he could go on, could tell Him the Egg what had happened after that. Why he was back in London. Why he couldn't bear thinking of what he'd lost and how little he'd gained back. If it hadn't been for his challenging job as an A&E doctor at The Royal London he would still be limping around with his cane and watching his savings dwindle alarmingly.
"—poor niece, she were pregnant when he got sick. She were his favorite and same on his end. It was just back pain, and we thought he'd pulled a muscle. Finally, his doctor gives him a scan, and tells us it's lung cancer! That were six months ago, and he's been dead two—"

John tries for a smile, and when that fails, rubs his hand along the back of his head.

Before Sherlock came back from the dead, John wanted to keep his weekends free so that his schedule coincided with Gerald's.
‘Cause my place is by your side
Sherlock was a week old when John had to go back to work. He hadn't yet talked to his supervisor about his need to go part time and he was anxious about the meeting. He was trying to get out the door, mentally rehearsing what he would say to his boss when he got to work.
, is it? I mean, if you're getting off?"
"Arrived where? And what would I be role playing? I mean, is it that you—" John stops, and then takes a deep breath and tries to look confident rather than what he's feeling because he feels about fourteen years old. "I don't—I'm not sure I get why you want me to wear high heels. Is it a—" John stops, and then lowers his voice, making it sound calm and not at all judgmental, before saying, "Do you have a thing for crossdressing or—"
much stouter when Sherlock left him behind. He's lost weight
"I think you win the big dick contest, dirty bastard."
"Whatever. I'm too tired to be mad," John says. "What do you want?"
"Oh, so you offered, then, did you?" John asks with a pointed lift off his eyebrows.
According to Chatsworth, Sherlock needed to practice shifting. After breakfast, he and John dutifully followed Chatsworth out to what John had originally assumed to be a caretaker's cottage, but which ended up being a fancy locker room. The lockers were roomy wooden cabinets rather than narrow metal ones and there was clearly a towel service but otherwise, it was immediately identifiable as a locker room.
John is standing in the shower weeping (God, no,

"Oh, I totally am, of course I am!" Rebecca says, grinning. "I didn't know being an aunt made one so impractical. I'm an absolute cooing puddle the minute I see him. It's absolutely disgusting. When you think about it, he's basically a two and a half kilo blob with roughly human features, no personality, and who communicates by shrieking."
"Indeed."
He's normally pretty good at pushing away personal stuff when at work. He needs full concentration to work in an A&E, especially in a hospital as large and busy as The London Royal Hospital. He's distracted, but the ambulance bays are empty for now and there hasn't been an actual emergency yet.
Gerald had been quick to referee, to introduce Cyril to John, but John had kept a possessive arm around Gerald all night, glowering at Cyril who'd looked completely unaffected, and falsely cheerful.
"Oh, thank God, your nose is fine, but I cut your lip. It's quite a split lip.
John huffs out a bitter laugh, recognizing the first of many times in the rest of his life when he'll have to make excuses for Sherlock. "Trust me, he won't go. He hates having to
"It was just a few minutes, Sherlock. I needed to ask him if he could come by to pick up the scripts I wrote for you. He's going to drop them off at the chemist's. Now, c’mon, let's go get you into a clean t-shirt."
But when he really considered it, John realized that Sherlock wasn't a child, despite his innocence. It'd be sort of like bathing with one's dog. Without all the fur, that is.
The floors are hardwood, unfinished pine. There's a wicker basket on the floor beyond the sideboard that holds a pair of wellies and trainers.
"You're a bastard, Mycroft Holmes!" John hisses, trying not to yell because Sherlock is still sleeping.
John holds up his hand. "He's still arrogant and thoughtless, whether he loves me or not."
"What is all this?" John asked, peeking at the books Sherlock had pulled out of one of the boxes. "I thought he was just sending teething supplies."
As Dr. Reed speaks, Sherlock finds himself nodding his head in agreement, even as he cringes away from such a frank discussion of something so terrible, so beyond the average human's understanding. It's already half ten before Dr. Reed finishes his story.
"I just don't want to trigger any—"
in a very small voice, and John reacts so vehemently that alarm sparks in Sherlock's eyes, and John has to pull himself back and slow down and cool off.
For ninety seconds, John watches as Sherlock pulls his lips in over his teeth, and it's not until later, when red tinged saliva is dripping from his mouth to his chin that John realizes Sherlock has bitten deep into the flesh of the inside of his lips. John hasn't seen a flashback like this—not this rigid, bone-grinding terror, the absolutely still way Sherlock holds his body while still shaking hard enough for his teeth to chatter, as though he's trying to hide himself
John, of course, asks, "Tea anyone?" already walking into the kitchen to turn the kettle on without waiting for an answer.
, and John throws his head back and howls with laughter. It echoes all over the bathroom and that makes Gerald do his
"Sherlock, you're confused. We need to stop," John says, trying to keep his voice calm and steady, and failing miserably.
Sherlock goes into the kitchen to help John lay out the food. They work together in silence, their bodies comfortable in close quarter even if their hearts are divided. When they sit down at the table, they eat in silence for several long moments. Sherlock surreptitiously watches John, whose eyes never rise above the level of his plate. Sherlock endures the weighted atmosphere until he feels sick with uncertainty, and can't stand the silence any longer.
When John gets home that night, the flat feels empty the way it used to after Sherlock died, and John experiences a flash of vertigo trying to collate what John knows intellectually—
In the sitting room, John picked up his phone and found the notepad where Mycroft had written down a number for emergencies alongside his personal mobile number. Behind him, he heard Sherlock making moaning noises as he chewed on his makeshift soother.
Gerald steps closer. "I'm better than I was the last time I saw you," he says and there's still a note of bitterness in his voice.
"I do care, you know," John says quietly, after a very uncomfortable moment in which John tries to remember what they were doing before he accidentally said
Sherlock's face does this thing that reminds John of the night he had the flashback, when his head was ducked down low and he was ashamed and John swore he would never make him feel ashamed, not about sex, but that's what he's done. The light has gone out of Sherlock's face, and his body is stiff and he's turned back to the computer, his shoulders hunched up over it as his fingers hover over the keys and John is mad,
The first thing Gerald says is, "That's not a weird kink," with a confused frown on his face.
"Oh. Hm. Ah, hm," he says, and then rolls his eyes at his own stuttering stupidity. He’s always assumed sex with John would incapacitate his higher powers of thought, but he hadn't considered it would reduce him to a pre-verbal state.
"Oh, I totally am, of course I am!" Rebecca says, grinning. "I didn't know being an aunt made one so impractical. I'm an absolute cooing puddle the minute I see him. It's absolutely disgusting. When you think about it, he's basically a two and a half kilo blob with roughly human features, no personality, and who communicates by shrieking."
"Fair enough," Sherlock says, a grin stretching his lips. "Do you have the necessary supplies?"
Gerald doesn't warn him, but John hears the whistling of the cane through the air and then a bright hot line of pain erupts across both his butt cheeks. He shouts into the bed.
"Ah, thank you," Gerald says. He takes a sip, closes his eyes and sighs.
"C'mon, I'm sorry," John says. He turns, and asks, "Can I—" and Sherlock asks, "What?" immediately alert, and John says, "I want to kiss you, but you're down there, and you said—it's okay so long as I'm not behind you or over you, so I need you to—"
Zivko looks at Sherlock, pleading. Sherlock beckons him closer.
“I work for MI6. I’m gathering information. They want to take down your trafficking ring,” Sherlock says matter-of-factly, moving closer to Blaine by increments, not wanting to startle him into action.
. There was a note of frustration in Sherlock's voice. His talons slipped on the shell and he scrabbled to get a hold on it again.
The party winds down much earlier than most of them are used to. Eventually, it's time for Milton's bottle and bed. Bernie and Olivia are beginning to look a little ragged as well.
"Oh, Sherlock," John breathes. He swallows and clears his throat. "Has anyone—have you been looked at?"
Everyone who said they wanted more than three chapters is getting their wish.

It takes fourteen seconds from the moment that John gets to his feet to the moment he slams the door, and then he is standing in front of Sherlock, and he's doing the only thing he can think to do.

He's still only in his bottoms and he has his robe hanging off his bony shoulders. John can't wait until Gerald gets there so he can stuff Sherlock with some calories. Talk about being a British mum.
He wonders, idly, if Mycroft sent Elspeth because he knew this would happen—Sherlock and Elspeth in bed. Sherlock
"Yes, but nonetheless," John says. Then he nods, slaps the door jamb once in a very masculine way, and disappears down the hall.

"You wanted me to find a therapist? Well, I did—Mycroft did." Sherlock waves his hand dismissively. "I spent hours on the phone today with my new therapist
Sherlock grabs a pillow and props it behind his head. He closes his eyes and tilts his head back, suddenly exhausted. His eyes prick with tears.
"There's nothing to talk about," Sherlock says, getting up off the bed. He goes to stand by the desk, looking out of the small window, his arms crossed, his body-language screaming
Sherlock, of course, didn't listen, and immediately tried to swallow a mouthful. He promptly spit it out. "That's hot!"
"I'll wait here until you're done," John says.

Gerald stands in the doorway, an expectant but not impatient look on his face. John stands on the pavement, feeling like an idiot.
Gerald makes him wait fifteen minutes and by the time he comes in, John has moved from sitting on the bed to lounging half on and half off it. When he hears the door open, he snaps back to sitting like Gerald told him to and berates himself for how easily he slips into the role of submissive. He's not

"Taxi!" he yells, almost stepping into the middle of the road, arm flailing.
John was out of time if he didn't want to get to work late. "Okay, okay. I'll be thinking of you, too."
"Stop deflecting. What I mean is—he needs you to give yourself over fully. Look at it from his point of view—I've had to do this with Cyril—you and I had each other. Cyril and Sherlock were alone all this time and, in their hearts, they really are afraid that they're imperfect enough to drive us back into each other's arms."
John takes him around to meet each person. Rebecca he already knows, so John introduces Rebecca's husband, Jasper. Then he leads Sherlock to the new mothers and Bernie—the dirty little thing that she is—murmurs, "My goodness. You're gorgeous enough to make me wish I was straight," in her posh voice.

"I don't want any milk in my tea," Sherlock said to John.
"And that sandbox thing over there?"
"There he is! Oh, isn't he a beautiful boy!" She leaned over to pet Sherlock who reared away from her hand with a wide-eyed look of shock on his face. "Come now, you handsome thing, let Mrs. Hudson have a quick pet."

"Don't you want to know what the good news is?" Sherlock asks, widening his eyes in petulant expectation.
Once John is in his lap, Sherlock wraps his arms around him, squeezing him, caging him, really
I'm sticking these last cut scenes here in one book rather than separate stories. So, yeah. I know this is angsty? But, I swear, it turns out awesome. Stay with me. Like you always do.
"What do you mean,
"I'm not sure what you're saying," John says, laughing, when Sherlock pokes him in the ribs. "I mean, it's a lovely speech, truly, I'm just not sure—"
"Definitely not straight anymore," Gerald agrees. "I suppose, though, that I want you to understand that for me, and for many gay people, the word
At that, John looked up at Chatsworth, uncertain. Chatsworth came to stand beside them.
"At the time, I was just getting into the dom/sub lifestyle and one day a female client of mine – a very beautiful and successful woman – said she wished someone would just
"Oh, thank God," Sherlock says. When Elspeth cocks an eyebrow at him, he hastens to add, "I thought at first that your child must've died. I'm just glad she's, you know. Alive."

which includes three hearty slaps on each other's back and then stepping a good distance apart.
"Yeah," John says, his brow furrowed. "But, I mean—we should be able to talk about these things with each other. Right?"

He couldn't help himself, really. He lifted his hand and laid it on the surface of the egg. It was hot, almost feverish to the touch. John thought,
Absolutely.
I'm in love with him because what happened to me in Serbia left me feeling very—needy."
Sherlock ignored him. He was standing on John's legs, his full wingspan spread open so that John couldn't see beyond the thin black leather of his stretched wings. There was a low hissing sound coming from Sherlock. It was of a different timbre and intensity than the usual hiss he used to voice displeasure.
"You know," John says conversationally. "I can't remember the last time I told you that you were wrong. Can you?"
The encounter leaves him wrong-footed, guilt like hot lead pooling through his limbs, and when he can speaks again, he asks, "Why don't you come downstairs?"
reaching sexual maturity," Chatsworth said unhelpfully.
Gerald's eyes widen in surprise, though he does his best to cover it. They've had lots of anal play, but never sex. They've only discussed it a few times, and each time agreed it was a topic for the future. Gerald's sexual history is tame. He's only had six lovers and one was the six-month fling with his best friend, Cyril. Of those six, Gerald's only had anal sex with two of them. John's had far too many lovers to count, but they were all women.
For Sherlock, none of that matters. He's secure in his masculinity because masculinity has nothing to do with being straight or gay. And it certainly has nothing to do with wearing a pair of women's shoes.

The only furniture left in it when Sherlock took up sleeping there was his own bed, a floor lamp, a small bedside locker, and the desk with chair. A few days after he came back, Sherlock had pushed aside the sliding doors on the closet to find stacks of boxes. In some, Sherlock found his own clothes, randomly and haphazardly stored—pants mixed with belts, unmatched socks tucked here and there, a book or two thrown in. The rest of the boxes held Christmas decorations, and other detritus of life that people pack away in boxes until they're needed.
John's anxiety had reached a peak. "Sherlock, if you're bloody brother wanted you, he would've come and got you before now."
"I can't do it—I need help with my shirt. My shoulder and elbow," he says and his eyes slide away, not wanting to meet John's.

my teeth on your skin. I want to bite all the way through your skin, leave a scar of my own, a permanent mark."
Sherlock was trying to tell him that whatever Gerald gives John, Sherlock can give it, too, because he was counting on having John's full attention when he came back. He was counting on the security and comfort that John has always given him.
to feel like going through hell counts as something to John, even though it meant losing Gerald.
Two and a half months after the press conference, Rebecca asks John to meet her for a pint when she gets off work. She's trying to talk John around to going to the  party celebrating the birth of Olivia and Bernie's son, but John is nervous about how he'll be received by Gerald and doesn't want to show up at such an important event if it will cause any awkwardness or draw attention from the main event—that being the little event himself, Milton.
Sherlock discovers his name is Zivko because Danilo is constantly insulting him, calling him a
Their kiss quickly descends into a frantic clash of teeth and tongue while their hands grip, and stroke, trying to delete any space between their bodies. In one whirling motion, Sherlock turns them around, drops to the bed, and tugs John onto his lap, his knees on either side of Sherlock's thighs. Sherlock reaches down and unties John's scrub bottoms, then slips his hand inside, his eyes never leaving John's face.
John steps over to the table next to his chair and picks up his phone. He makes sure Sherlock can see him. He pulls Mycroft's info up on his phone and rings him.
Loaded down with clothes, he goes downstairs to find Sherlock in the bathroom.
He clears his throat, pushing down the want that's unfurled inside him so fast that it's like being blindfolded, spun around, and then told to find his way home without being able to see where he's going. Just like it does every time he thinks of Sherlock on his knees, or behind him, above him,

for John rather than their names. As they spoke, John's hand never strayed far from Sherlock's egg unless he was in another room. Even then they could speak together, but the connection was very faint, reduced almost to impressions. They tested it out. John could get all the way down to the entryway before the tie between them broke.
"I. Love. You."
"Um—both?"
"You can't help me with everything," Sherlock says. His heart is racing. He rubs his hand over his mouth and wipes sweat off his upper lip. Now that he’s noticed it, he feels the dampness of perspiration everywhere.
At the reminder of Sherlock's deception, John tenses visibly and Sherlock shrinks into himself in frustrated guilt. He knows if he apologizes, John will just tell him apologies are useless (something
John shook his head. "No, when he's tired, he crashes wherever he happens to be. He doesn't try to fight it."
"Don't make fun," Gerald chides, sounding a little hurt.
John trails his nose down Sherlock's cock through his pants, burying his nose into the crease of Sherlock's thigh. He closes his eyes, and pulls in a deep, shuddering inhalation, moaning hoarsely. Sherlock's mouth falls open, and something shockingly like a whimper escapes him. John chuckles breathily and then uses the flat of his tongue to move even further down, against the underside of Sherlock's balls, and then he licks back up between them, and then around each individual testicle, and finally up to the root of his cock. Sherlock's breathing is uneven, and his knuckles ache from digging his hands into the mattress. His arse cheeks are clenched tightly together. In fact, his whole body is wound tight as a spring. John stiffens his tongue and brushes it in a zigzag pattern all the way up to the tip of Sherlock's penis, which he suckles gently through the damp cotton of Sherlock's pants.
, eh? You have sabotaged everything in my life that wasn't to do with you, and my relationship with Gerald was no different. Do you know what he said when I went to see him that night? He said the minute you walked in the door, what he and I had was over, that it never stood a chance once you showed up. Why, Sherlock?
that the minute the opportunity arose, I snatched it, consequences be damned."
his friends. John doesn't like lying, but he does exactly as Mycroft says if only because he wants to protect Sherlock from the press, after how Sherlock was treated before he faked his death. John still remembers those hateful months after, mourning his best friend and holding onto his belief in the face of such ugly and biased publicity. It's not that John doesn't trust Rebecca or his supervisor, but the more people who know, the more likely the secret will get out.
Automatically, John's eyes flitted to the area of Sherlock's body where he would most likely find a penis and—yep—Sherlock had a penis, too. He quickly averted his gaze. If he told Sherlock he had a penis, who knew what questions Sherlock would ask next. A knock on the door saved him.
In fact, John loves Sherlock with a passion so fierce, it frightens him. Even though his heart is still tender in the wake of his breakup, John
All of Sherlock’s physical pain disappears in the face of this one, gnawing wound. For a moment, he can’t catch his breath.
"No, look—Gerald told me you probably want me to wear them because they'll make my legs look bloody fantastic."
“What makes you think I want you to beg?” Sherlock asks, with a tilt of his head.
—he's so glad there's a
"I am not," Sherlock declares authoritatively, but John's smile widens, and he says loudly, "You're
"Oh, yeah, I did, didn't I?" Rebecca says, scrunching her nose up before pushing her bottom lip out slightly, the picture of haughty petulance. "Well, I take it back, because Gerald got to keep you, and then you went off with that man of yours—I mean,
John's face scrunches in confusion. "The baby?"

"About what?" Sherlock asks, drawn in despite himself.
"I should know better than to touch a man in the throes of a PTSD nightmare," Gerald says. "I was hoping I could clean up before you realized what had happened."
"Tell me how it works, then. Go on," John says, nudging Gerald's knee with his.
"I apologize for my tardiness," is the first thing Sherlock says as he edges his way towards John like a skittish lamb seeking shelter behind its mother.
After work, John sends Sherlock a text, letting him know that he has a few things he has to do (actually, just the one thing), but reassuring Sherlock that he'll be home by eight. Then he puts the phone on silent, goes to his locker and pulls out the box with the Magic Bullet in it. The night before, he'd washed it very carefully and packed it up to give back to Gerald.
"Well, my clients are referred by another client. There's reams of paperwork! My barrister writes it all up for me – she's a genius. It takes at least an hour to go over the paperwork.
To everyone's amusement, Sherlock looked to Chatsworth to back him up.
"Oh, and don't you know, all those pictures of ugly babies people have shown me over the years and I thought,
"Well, at least we don't have to fight with him on that issue."
"Together. Just the two of us," John says with a private smile that promises him everything.
"Not this severe. I think his body is working harder than it should to push his teeth out, almost like it wants to accomplish in twenty-four hours what takes most hatchlings upwards of a week or more. He's not even supposed to start getting his teeth until his third day out of the egg, and then it takes five to seven days for them to come in completely."
He crouches in front of the gravestone and pours the ashes from the bag into his hand and pushes them into the ground with his fingers so they won't fly away. He does it one small handful at a time until the baggie is empty. He crumples the bag up in his hand and shoves it in his pocket.
John shook his head and then looked up at the ceiling. "Why am I not surprised that you're already wiggling out of your responsibility?"
As they lie there, catching their breaths, John says hoarsely, "My arse is off-limits for at least three days. I wasn't sure I was going to make it through for a bit there. Good thing we came quickly," and Sherlock chuckles, his voice rough, and rearranges them so that John is spooning him. Sherlock holds their linked left hands over his heart, and it's not long before John's body goes limp, and his breathing evens out.
Gerald turns his face to the side and takes another swallow of his beer. His hair swings like a single smooth sheet to cover the side of his face. "You felt you had less to lose with me so it was easier to open up."
"What do you mean,

To John's surprise, Sherlock says, "Give him to me."
"I would like to continue to pay Sherlock's share of the rent," Mycroft says after John sits down in Sherlock's chair.
Sherlock stands carefully, about to head for his—

to protect you."
Speaking of last night, what did it mean? John has a tendency to treat uncomfortable situations in which he is involved as though they didn't happen. When it involves other people, though, he can gossip like a little old lady.
"No worries. I'll secure the necessary items." Mycroft stood, grabbing his umbrella.
"No, I want—" Sherlock says, but doesn't finish. He presses his index finger in, and in, and in until John can feel the rest of Sherlock's hand pressed up against his arsehole. Sherlock twists his finger, and John hisses and jumps and pants, and Sherlock moans, and says, "God, that lube launcher is

if she looked up. Sherlock had snorted at John's description of his penis in terms of food, but found it secretly endearing, and a very middle-class thing to say.
While he's in the bathroom, John digs through the top drawer, and says, "Ah-ha!" when he finds the red lube launcher, caught behind a small box of tissues. He picks up Gerald's, and tosses it in the loo bin right as Sherlock is drying his hands.

"You have no idea how much I want you," Sherlock says, his voice hoarse with frustration and desire. "And just so we're clear, you were

Gerald's eyebrows climb into his hair. "He went all the way to Denmark because you had a fight?"
Sherlock shook his head. "They're thtupid rulth. No wonder thith country ith falling apart." With that, he picked his chicken bone back up and gave it a good gumming.
They pulled through a set of iron gates in the middle of nowhere which led to a long road that eventually ended, far in the distance, at a large manor house.
"Yes, Dr. Watson," Sherlock says with a wry grin.
As it turned out, John had reason to be entirely grateful for his dramatically adverse reaction to magic.
Sherlock wants to fuck John. Thousands of shippers go, "Hey! That's my plot!"
"Yeah," John says. Without realizing it, he's crept further into the kitchen and out of Sherlock's line of sight. He's standing next to the fridge in front of the window and Sherlock's in his chair in the living room.
"I have a list. Wanna see it?"
"Are you sure about that?" Chatsworth asked as he walked into the dining room and took a seat.
with him—I mean, that's gonna happen, right?
"It's okay," John says and Sherlock knows it's not a platitude—he genuinely means it.
When I'm done with the missing chapters, I intend to slot them into the full story where they belong. Only then will I truly have finished "It's All Fine." I hope those of you who were there two years ago will be here for the end.
? I love you, John! Do you think that makes no difference?"
"God, no," Gerald says, sounding irritated. "My job isn't to fix anyone. I get clients who get angry at me because they're still having issues after months of therapy and I'm like, look, you're the one who refuses to accept any responsibility. 'Well, but my wife left me. I didn't do anything wrong.'" Gerald is getting agitated, his voice louder. This is a sore subject, one he very clearly needs to vent about. "They don't get that it's not accepting responsibility for other people's decisions. It's accepting responsibility for their
John makes his way towards Sherlock, his arms outstretched. Sherlock wants to return the hug but, unfortunately, this is the first time Sherlock has been outside the clearly demarcated boundaries of the infirmary or his brother's presence. Sherlock's threat assessment system is blaring and screaming at him to
“Listen, I’m sorry, that was my fault - “
Gerald sidles close and presses himself up against John.
John turned around and saw that Sherlock was stretching his head in the direction of the open container, one step away from falling off the table. John quickly stuck the bowl under Sherlock's head.
Here John stopped reading, alarmed.
"I beg your pardon?" Mycroft said, opening his newspaper back up.
Five weeks later, Sherlock gets caught downloading information from Blaine’s laptop to his phone. Blaine is supposed to be sleeping - Sherlock made sure of it by dropping an orally disintegrating barbiturate tab in his wine before they went to bed. Sherlock has done the same thing three times before and it always works. It should’ve worked this time, yet Blaine is standing in the living room blinking at Sherlock, looking groggy but becoming more focused by the second.
"What do I do about Sherlock?"
At first, John is indignant and then concedes Gerald has a valid point and perhaps they should move this down to the sofa.
so big
Sherlock stood up on his hind legs, his back to John. He'd already figured out how to open the cupboards and was digging through them one by one. "John, I'm very hungry. I promised you I would eat—why are you being so slow in giving my food to me? Do you expect me to find it myself? That's not very caring of you." He moved onto the next cupboard, sweeping a newspaper and the box of teabags onto the floor, narrowly missing a mug that John snatched away in time.
"Well, let me go by myself, then. Otherwise, they'll think you're abusive."
John doesn't know if his heartbreak is because Sherlock felt he
Just left me drowning in my grief
"Why not?" Sherlock asks, genuinely confused. Then he realizes what John's talking about, and scrubs his face with his hands. "Right."
There are two things Serbia taught him—one, don't take sleep or food for granted. Two—he can be hurt here just as easily as he was there. The difference is that here he's not alone. He'll never be alone so long as he has John.
"All right. Then—I
he gasped in wonder. He reached out to touch, but John snatched his hand back.
When John walks into the living room, there's a rousing chorus of
"My parents are very socially liberal, and have always strongly supported human rights, including gay rights. Even then I was afraid to tell them I was gay. I might not have told them for years except that a few days before Christmas my first year at Oxford, my mother walked in on me performing oral sex on the boy from next door, who also happened to be my best friend and flatmate at Oxford. I was humiliated but Cyril just pulled a blanket over us, and said, 'We'll be down in a mo, Mrs. Glass, and then you can yell at us.' Cool as you please, as though butter wouldn't melt in his mouth. He'd come out to his parents practically as soon as he knew what it meant."
"I don't see how that's possible," Sherlock said with a somber shake of his head. "I can't forget you for
"John." Gerald flails in his attempt to get up without tripping and without spilling his beer and finally manages it, laughing weakly. He's nervous. That makes John feel better because he worried he would be the only one.
"You're curious, John," Gerald says, still brushing his fingers through John's hair. His voice has taken on a deeper, hypnotic quality. "You want to know what I'm going to do with them. Would you like me to tell you?"
you why! I'm
"What do you want me to do?" Sherlock cries, throwing his arms wide. "How many ways can I say I'm sorry to have kept you in the dark? Everything I did was to protect
But Rebecca works with John, and even though their schedules only overlap on Thursdays, he knows that eventually she'll manage to corner him. One day, two weeks after John and Gerald break up, she succeeds in dragging him into an empty loo off the doctor's lounge before he can get away. She locks the door, and demands he tell her what the hell is going on between him and Gerald. John caves and tells her they broke up because he cheated. He expects Rebecca to be angry, but she's shocked instead.
John thinks feverishly and giggles once, high and breathy.
"Yeah," John says, thinking about Sherlock's arse, pale and plush and begging to be bitten. He licks his bottom lip, and then bites it. Shakes his head, trying to shake off the image. "I mean, no, I can't stop you."

, Him the Egg declared venomously.
"Look, I've got to get home," Rebecca says, looking at her watch. "Jasper will have supper waiting, and he gets in a strop if I'm late." John snorts, and Rebecca stops digging in her purse, and says, "What?" indignantly.
"Who was it with?"
"Tape, tape," he hissed, digging through kitchen drawers. And then—a ha! It was in the desk in the sitting room.
John feels like a bit of an arsehole for the way he's going about this, but Sherlock needs to be drawn in, made to see his own error. That's the only way he'll believe it.
Without opening his eyes, John said, "Sherlock, after what we just went through, you better have the most goddamn beautiful set of teeth of any creature in the world."
He doodled some little stars around the dragon and then some hearts and then he found himself wondering what he would next if he let his hand go without his mind interfering. Then he was hit with a thought—what if there was a way to remember without remembering?
"What," Mycroft choked out. "Have you been teaching him?" John opened his mouth to defend himself, but Mycroft held up a hand. "Forget I asked."
He whispers it repeatedly, even as Blaine bucks and shoves his body against Sherlock, but Sherlock is stronger and heavier than he appears and Sherlock’s knees are dug into the insides of his elbow so he’s already lost feeling in his hands.
Sherlock is shaking so hard his teeth are chattering. His heartbeat is thunderous… how can John not hear it? Sherlock rushes to the flat door and locks it, then does the same for the kitchen door. Then he runs back to his chair, but John is nowhere to be found. Sherlock's so pumped full of adrenaline that his toes and face are completely numb.
"If that's all it takes to keep you off drugs, my arse is yours," and Sherock slams into him hard enough that John has to brace his arms to keep them from toppling over, and John says, "Jesus, Sherlock, you could warn me," and Sherlock growls, "Your arse already belongs to me," and quiets for a moment as he fucks them both into a sustained stupor, clearly skilled at keeping himself and his partner on edge.
"Sorry, gimme a minute, just a minute, oh, god, I'm sorry, just need a, a minute, just, whew," Sherlock mutters, trying not to hyperventilate.
"I'm not confused. Kiss me," Sherlock demands.
"No, it's in Sherlock's duffel bag and I didn't want to wake him up because the bag's in my bedroom."
When the MI6 analysts come to debrief Sherlock the day after they arrive in Belgrade, Mycroft chases them away with what can only be described as threats of bodily harm and personal destruction. They scatter like cockroaches in the light and Sherlock can't help but laugh. It's the first time he's laughed in months.
Sherlock stared skeptically at the water. "I don't think I want to go in there."
His brain immediately puts up stop signs and barriers
So John lets Gerald wait, building the anticipation, letting his eyes travel over Gerald's body as very slowly, John begins to unbutton his own shirt. When his shirt is off, he works off his belt, pulling it out of the belt loops with one jerk and drops it on the pile of clothes. He undoes his button and zip then leans over Gerald and pulls his pants off. Only then does John take off his jeans, chucking them on the hill of discarded clothing.
"You need to pee," John said and guided him to the litter box set up in the kitchen. It was three sided, much smaller than the feeding pen, and held normal cat litter.

John grabs the barrel with his left hand and, with an impressive backhand that would leave Andre Agassi applauding, pistol whips the unsuspecting suspect. The man sways in place for a second, looking confused, so John rears back again and, this time, there's a

your family and friends. It means constantly being aware of how you look and act.
John checks his mobile at least once an hour throughout the day, but Sherlock never texts back. Despite his anger at Sherlock, and the bitter end to his relationship with Gerald, John loves Sherlock more than he's ever loved anyone in his life. Gerald was right—the minute Sherlock walked in the door that night, his relationship with Gerald was over.
Gerald grabs forks out of the drawer next to the sink, and a couple of linen napkins, which John finds classy and unpretentious, like Gerald himself. Gerald sets their food down on TV trays, a stark contrast with the stark white linen napkins he places down next to their bowls of pasta. It makes John smile.
"You can come out now!"
But it turns out that you just didn't want
After a few weeks of sleeping in Sherlock's bed every night, John decides to move into Sherlock's bedroom permanently. He packs all of Sherlock's clothes away in John's old closet. He changes the sheets and makes the bed. He picks up all of the clutter on the floor and packs it away in boxes.
"I loved that day because you—you let me be a part of what you were trying to do—to honor him, and your feelings for him, and you weren't at all self-conscious. You were so—I don't know how to say it without sounding pathetically in love, but you shone so brightly that day. You were so happy, and I'd helped you with that. I felt like I was basking in the sun, but you were the sun. I never felt jealous of him, never. Not once did you ever make me feel like you were measuring me against him.
"Sherlock," John says softly, shaking his head slightly as he sits on the bed next to him. He takes the box of condoms out of Sherlock's unresisting hands, and takes both of his hands so all four are wrapped up together. "I've never stopped wanting you, no more than I stopped loving you. In fact, I've had to remind myself many times of your injuries so that I could maintain the proper distance, not just as your doctor, but because you're always so deceptively self-assured. And then, also, like I said—breaking up with Gerald was hard, but it's not stopped me wanting you."
Milton begins to stir in John's arms so he stands and passes him off to Rebecca. Then John grasps the elbow that Rebecca only just released a minute before and turns towards the group. The looks of salacious eagerness on their faces makes him laugh again.
"Oh," Sherlock says, blinking, his outrage arrested. "I see."
I thank each of you, especially those who commented. I read things and don't comment often mostly because I read everything on an app on my tablet rather than directly in the browser so I'd be a hypocrite to fish for comments when I'm guilty of not commenting myself. So, I'll just say that all us writers beg for comments so when you have the opportunity it impetus to comment, do it!
to fix it right now. John is willing to take a cock up his arse, but his masculinity cannot handle wearing women's shoes. It just cannot.
off his list of things that he is not.
John turns to Sherlock, and lays his hand on Sherlock's ankle. His thumb begins to rub little circles in the inside bone, and Sherlock starts to relax into the touch. John looks down at his thumb making circles around the delicate skin of Sherlock's ankle (he hadn't known they were an erogenous zone, but then again—everywhere John touched was an erogenous zone).
With Sherlock's head resting over his shoulder and his constant exclamations of wonder and curiosity, John found the ninety minute trip passing by in the blink of an eye. It was something wonderful to see one's everyday familiar world through the eyes of someone for whom it was new. The sun seemed to shine more strongly with Sherlock next to him and the green of the English countryside seemed saturated with color.
"Oh, you're just being diplomatic," Rebecca says, even though they both know he's not.
John's erection has flagged, but Gerald has told him that's normal, especially during prep. Gerald is very observant and he notices right away when John starts to get tired of being on his hands and knees. He gets two pillows (also new, like the bed) and coaxes John onto his back, the pillows under his hips.

Holmes ducked his head. Nostrils flaring, he looked up and grumbled, "You must keep secret what I'm about to tell you or I will find a more permanent way to remove you from my path." When John made a

, really, and he can't throw that away for a messy night of snogging with his once-dead best friend. Especially since said best friend is probably a bit tipsy from pain medication and doesn't know what he's doing.
There was some complicated maneuvering involved in taking it off of Sherlock since he refused to drop the bone. John took the shirt to the kitchen trash.
"Thirty seconds!" Cayden looks like his blood pressure is rising in direct proportion to the number of seconds left in the countdown. "They're about to introduce you."

On the 20th of October, I wrote "Interlude" with Pippin at my feet on his blue rug, and then I posted it. That was the day he died and I haven't written since then. These last two chapters were already written and only required a coat of polish, and thank God for that or I wouldn't have finished this. I would've committed the most heinous crime a fanfic author can committ--the Permanent WIP!
With that, he's gone.
"No! I don' wanna thtay with you. I only want Zhon."
"None of it matters, though, does it?" Gerald's breath hitches and it takes him a few deep breaths before he can speak without crying. "What we had was over the minute you saw he was alive."
"Yellow," John gasps.
“On their knees?” Bernie suggests, to tipsy laughter, and a few bawdy cheers.
"Briefly, yes, just to check for infection."

you were in love with your best friend. Do you know why he did that? Why someone as confident and well-balanced as Gerald would enter into a romantic relationship with a man who was in love with his dead best friend? A man who would always be, even if just a tiny bit, in love with someone else? Would always be just a tiny bit emotionally unavailable?"
"What about your wrist?” John asks, nodding at the wrapping on Sherlock's right wrist.
Rebecca, unrepentant, grins and continues. "Speaking of not showing up, you and Sherlock haven't left the flat much, either, have you? With all
"I'm not going to die," John said gently.
"Convenient," Gerald mutters.
"Already? He's not even been out of the egg for twenty-four hours!"
Slowly it dawned on John that Sherlock was trying to

to him.
John pounds back up the stairs and down the hall. "Condoms!" he crows triumphantly, and throws the box on the bed.
John says, "Okay," managing not to sound like he's crying (though he is, shamelessly). "I'm going to cover you up with this duvet behind you, look at my hands, see? They're moving behind you, and this duvet right here—look, Sherlock, please—okay it's coming up behind you now, over your shoulders, and there you go." John crouches in front of him, tucking the duvet in, only letting himself stay connected to Sherlock through a single point of contact—his hand cupped lightly against Sherlock's knee. (Like it fucking matters—like they aren't already connected at a cellular level, but it makes John feel better, dammit).

"I'm just curious! If you don't want to tell me—" John says, putting his hands up like it's no skin off his nose whether Sherlock tells him or not, even though it's suddenly the most important thing in the universe and his skin is prickling with apprehension, but anticipation as well. If Sherlock is as good at being kinky as he is about almost everything else, he could probably talk John around to all kinds of debauchery.
"Really? Because it seems simple to me. How about
"I do apologize for the dishonesty, John. It was necessary."
"Oh, for

"It's really none of your business, John," Sherlock says spitefully.
John tilts his head and furrows his brow. "Me?"

"I'm not jealous," John said, blushing furiously.
"Push me over the table roughly," he tells Zivko.
Sherlock starts to nod. John's smile is making him smile, too, even though they're both smiling rather weakly. Slowly, John moves and when he's about two feet away, he holds out his hand. Sherlock reaches for it and John steps closer to help him up. John uses the hand he's gripping to pull Sherlock into a hug, and Sherlock's not fast enough to stop it.
The thought of this was why John walked out the door without paying attention and slammed straight into the chest of the tallest and burliest man he'd ever seen.

"That's right," John says. "Although my fist might’ve been in the way."
"I'm sorry, love," John said, picking up the offending items. "I shouldn't have said those things to you. But, you shouldn't have spit the medicine on my shoes, either."
. This pain is different, more diffuse, and
They both stare down at the stain and John starts to laugh hard enough that his stomach muscles clench abruptly, his mouth opens wide in pleasure, while Sherlock glares at him and then at John's t-shirt and then at the bottle, as though all three are to blame for the failed attempt at lubricating his hands. John's shoulders are shaking, and his eyes are squeezed shut with laughter. He's still hard, and the laughter prompts his brain to release hormones that turn up the heat of his arousal while also tempering the need to get off, leaving him burning slow and hot. He hears a clatter in the sink, and opens his eyes to see what caused it, but Sherlock grabs him under the thighs and then
“Does it feel good? I want you to feel good,” Sherlock says, his voice so low it's almost a whisper.
Gerald, too, is male, primal, potent. John is on fire and Gerald is the bellows.
Holmes count or do I have to, you know, take care of any Holmes dragons who come along?"

Giving Sherlock privacy to complete his other elimination needs, the three humans retired to the landing outside the front door. A rough schedule of who stayed with Sherlock and when was worked out and then John was finally, blessedly alone.

He pursed his lips and then shook his head. "Gregory, this is Dr. John Watson. You know Chatsworth. And that, of course, is my baby brother. This is DI Gregory Lestrade of the Metropolitan Police."
It's exactly what I want to do."
A hiss was Sherlock's response but after a few seconds, he sat in his chair, slouching sullenly. He looked over at John. "You hit me," he said quietly, his mouth a lovely pink pout.

"Out in the garden," Cyril says tilting his head towards a sliding glass door that leads out to a small but well-kept and charmingly decorated garden.
"I hope so," he says with a rueful grin.
“I know what you're thinking,” Cyril says, startling Sherlock.
"I'd say that was very unfair."
three times, his eyes slipping shut with pleasure, willing himself not to throw John onto his knees and fuck him. John's tongue licks over Sherlock's Adam's apple, and he gasps.
"It's not polite to grab someone's tea," John said.
. This man is going to finish off what Moriarty started, because the sheer exquisiteness of the pleasure John incites in him is going to fucking kill him. He groans in a combination of frustration and pleasure, and shoves his hands up under John's scrub top, pushing it up until John gets the hint and lifts his arms. Sherlock leaves him to deal with getting his top off so he can pull the drawstring on John's bottoms, not letting himself get distracted by John's fat cock straining against his pants, or the flat but muscular stretch of John's glutes, and instead manhandles John out of his bottoms, and down his legs. His pants are white, his socks are white, and his shoes are black, and there's something
"Well, then why don't they jutht make that perthon the King!"
"No, God, don't apologize, you look fucking gorgeous. It took all my willpower not to fuck you ten minutes ago."
"Who were you talking to?" Sherlock asks flatly, his expression unreadable. He's sweating, and it's soaked through his t-shirt under the arms and across his chest.
“Come home with me,” Blaine murmurs into Sherlock’s ear. “My apartment is only a few blocks away.”
"It sounds to me like you're hurt, deeply so, because your bloke had the audacity to get over you after he thought you'd died, and you're heartbroken. You sacrificed yourself for his safety, and came home to find he'd left you behind. You can’t blame PTSD for being in love with John. What you

"I want to come on your body, and smear it into your skin, and then make you walk around with it underneath your clothes. It would be even better if we went to a crime scene, and I'd know that you were marked as mine, that anyone who got close enough would smell me on you. Lestrade, and Donovan, and fucking Anderson, who wants to fuck you by the way—" and John says, "There's no fucking way," while rocking back against Sherlock, who says, "No, he does, he really—" then Sherlock grunts before finishing his sentence, "I think, but—I think it's because he hates me, and fucking you would be payback."
, Sherlock, you startled me!"
Sherlock nods. He will not get up from this chair. He's not sure he can. John comes back into the kitchen holding a bundle of blue silk and carrying his desert camouflage med kit with the big red cross on it. He sets both down on the table near Sherlock. John takes the kettle, fills it with water, puts it on the heating coil and clicks it on.
to do that to keep John's friendship or if it's because Sherlock still only sees him as a friend.
Mrs. Gonzales's face contorts in pain and John's focus snaps back like a rubber band pulled tight, shocking him out of his head. He pulls his stethoscope off his neck to listen to her heart and thinks
Sherlock's hand that was cupping his neck now moves down to cup John's half-hard penis. The touch of Sherlock's hand through the thin fabric of John's pajama bottoms galvanizes John's body into action. In just a few seconds, John is fully hard and Sherlock takes that as invitation to begin stroking John through the fabric. John grips Sherlock's wrist with the thought to pull Sherlock's hand away, but Sherlock isn't budging. The hand that was cupping John's arse slips

himself against John. Sherlock moans against John's lips and before John can form a clear plan of action, Sherlock shoves his tongue into John's mouth.
John laughs at his confusion and Sherlock shovels the last of the mashed potatoes into his mouth and gets up. He makes his way into the sitting room, while John follows, grabs John's laptop and then puts it down and grabs his own before stretching out on the couch. He looks up as he opens the lid on his computer.
"No, I meant,
"Sherlock," John says in his
"Yes, well, apparently he's an overachiever. I made him a chew toy out of some rags—"
"I suppose," John said grudgingly because although he hated to admit it, Sherlock was right—dragons were pretty fucking awesome.
"But, then, why—?"
John looks at her in surprise, and says, "Oh, were you talking? I'm sorry. I thought I'd made it clear we were moving on from that subject." John fiddles with his glass. Shakes his head. Tries to speak. Doesn't.
John feels it - the flood of sexual attraction. The most surprising thing is that he’s

It gets harder as Sherlock watches it and he wants to shut his dressing gown, but one hand is on John's shoulder and the other clutches the back of the chair. Sherlock quickly decides John witnessing his erection is worse than falling, so he grabs both edges of the open front of his dressing gown, and grips them together in his hands, one hand above his waist and the other at crotch level.
John shook him off and, without turning around, said, "But
"Oh, ha ha," John deadpans with a pointed look. "Look, I just don't think we're ready to have sex."
Sherlock, who can infer your job, your relationship, and what you ate for lunch just by looking at you, has no doubt what kind of relationship John has with this man.
"I think your penis has had quite enough for one night," John said dryly.

Dr. Andy Reed spends at least thirty minutes telling Sherlock who he is, what happened to him, and why he became a therapist. He was captured by the Taliban in 2004, and held for three hundred and ninety-four days during which he experienced physical and psychological torture and extreme deprivation. When he was finally rescued, he was invalided out of the army and sent home with a diagnosis of PTSD where he promptly failed to adjust to civilian life.

Looking at the third definition, John snorts at the very heterosexual interpretation.
"Not yet," he says absently, his trousers momentarily forgotten as his eyes roam over John's body before lifting them back to John's face. Sherlock takes off his own clothes with quick efficiency. He leaves his pants on, and climbs onto the bed next to John.

When John dabs the betadine on his cuts, Sherlock hisses and instinctively twists away. John holds him in place with a gentle but firm hand and begins murmuring a litany of soothing words and Sherlock almost relaxes into John’s touch. After a while, the stinging pain of each individual cut – ironically, worse than the original lashes – disappears into one sheet of pain, like a choir of individual voices reaching the crescendo and holding one note together.
"I don't know," Sherlock says.
"Why ever not?"
"Ready?" Sherlock asks, wrapping his fingers around the Victorian glass doorknob. John nods his head and they exit the room
"Oh, sorry. Yes. Uh, Belgrade. Serbia."
He winked at John as though John should find Mycroft's formality charming. John managed a wan smile in response.
John looked up and his breath caught. Sherlock was dressed in tight black jeans and a grey t-shirt just snug enough that it stretched appealingly across his shoulders. He was, in a word, mouthwatering.

"Twenty-four seven, sir."
"So he's right?"
In the kitchen, he flips on the light, and it's the first time he's really seen Sherlock since he came in not more than ten minutes ago. The light in the bedroom is dim and Sherlock was crouched most of the time.
John sits up, his body rigid, and his nostrils flaring, and says, "I sat there for a minute and a half, staring at you because I was distracted by sex. I've dealt with at least a dozen of your flashbacks, and that one was—because

John makes a note and then he puts the pad and pen aside. He crosses his arms.
Gerald steps back so John can come in, but when Gerald leans in to kiss him, John thrusts the box towards him. Gerald freezes, then reaches out slowly to take it. He turns around and walks stiffly towards the kitchen to leave it on the worktop. John follows, but stands next to the dining room table, leaving several feet of space between him and Gerald.
"You just thought you'd bloody well not answer the phone when your therapist called you three times, and I called you the whole way home on the fucking tube? Where is your fucking phone anyway?"
"Get your kit off," Chatsworth said to Sherlock.
Gerald lifts his head, brings his arm up and rests his chin on the back of his hand so he can look at John's face.
"I'm fine," John says, thinking Gerald is worried about pain.

Sherlock lets loose a warm chuckle and his cheeks flush pink. He strokes his big hand lightly over Milton's back.
