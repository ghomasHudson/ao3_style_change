"Well, that wasn't very nice of him," Tony said. "A little nip might've helped take the edge off your nervousness a bit."
Steve chuckled.  “Well… then, how ‘bout because Peter needs you at home?  I know how much you don't like leaving him.”
"What does she want, JARVIS?"
Peter sniffed, his doe-like eyes shiny with tears as he nodded. "Uh huh. I'm gonna have the frequency pulled up on my phone until you get back. Just—just to be sure."
"Shh, buddy, none of this is your fault." Dad pressed a kiss to Peter's forehead before tucking him close again. "I just… I just wish we weren't on our own out here."
"No, Grandpa, I didn't," Peter answered with a sigh. He glanced up at the clock, noting that it was already 1500 hours. The last thing Peter wanted was for Dad to drop by and see his grandfather sitting in his room. "You might want to start heading back soon though. Don't wanna get caught out after curfew."
"Shall we?"
"Of course you would," Tony playfully retorted. "And I'm sure it was all part of your plan."
"Pete?" he said, giving Gwen a quick, cursory nod. "You okay, buddy?"
"Not like there's any other places to hide out here," said Sam. "Redwing's sweeping for more stragglers now, Cap."
The alien scowled as he raised his arms, causing two large hunks of metal to detach from the walls of the ship. "You've saved nothing," he taunted. "Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine."
“Yeah, something like that.”
"So… uh… what exactly does that mean? I mean, what happens next? There's no way that HYDRA's gonna let this go, but—"
Tony could almost feel Steve’s blush through the phone, and his grin grew even wider as he pictured that goofy
"He wasn't, obviously. He'd just never slept that long in one stretch before, and I didn't know how to handle it. Pretty sure he didn't wake up until he'd finally peed through his diaper."
"Not necessarily, Buck," Steve said. His eyes flicked over to Tony, giving his hand a reassuring squeeze. "It's just better to be on the safe side here. I'm sorry about the short notice."
"Yeah, I know," Peter said, sniffing. He tugged her over behind their classroom door, leaning down to give her a quick kiss. Blatant public displays of affection were not condoned at Midtown, and the last thing Peter needed was some nosy teacher or student ratting him out to his dads, but with how quickly weird things tended to happen to him and his loved ones, Peter didn't want to waste any chances to show his girl how much he cared for her.
"Uh huh," Peter said softly. He knew Papa was right, that they could only concentrate on what was right in front of them. But he also knew that knowing Papa, he was already trying to plan for every possible contingency. Which meant that if Thanos had somehow managed to open a wormhole between parallel universes, the Avengers would have to somehow close it back up again or Thanos' army could literally go on forever.
Steve managed, his brain practically short-circuiting as Tony's mouth met his. Tony’s tongue swept past Steve’s lips just for a moment or two before he began trailing open-mouthed kisses down his chest, pausing to give attention to both of his nipples before continuing further down. Steve's hands fisted into the sheets, his entire body writhing in anticipation.
Steve gave a stuttered nod as he glided his palms up and down Tony’s back.  “Yeah.  I know you are.  I can see you, and feel you.”
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
Slowly, Peter's stiff body began to relax as he breathed in a slow, deep breath. Then his head whipped around to look at Steve, his eyes narrowing as he noticed Steve's bruised and bloodied nose.
"No, we have not," answered T'Challa. "As the Soul Stone is vital to our ability to communicate with our ancestors, it is not something that I am willing to part with unless I am presented with no other choice."
"But won't that take like, forever?" asked Scott. "I mean, you said it yourself that there's literally an infinite number of universes."
And somehow, Dad and whoever was left of his family must have figured out how to reverse things, which, Peter had to admit, sounded really freaking
"I do, because it has to," Steve said firmly. "And not only for Peter, sweetheart. This is for everyone. We all lost. All of us, so… whatever it takes."
"Yes, that's a good way to put it," Grandma agreed. "He was also ambitious, power-hungry, and far too willing to bulldoze over anyone who got in his way for my taste." A sort of dreamy look crossed her face. "And then there was Joseph."
"Steve," James insisted as he crouched down in front of him, his battle-worn face etched in the same anguish that Steve was drowning in. "Look, I know… I
It’s one of the things Steve admires most about him.
he thought as he ran his palm down the cozy fabric, swiping at an errant tear as he heard Papa calling from the kitchen.
"C'mon, Птер, we should be getting you outta here—"
Natasha let out a kind of morbid chuckle, shrugging. "Oh, you know," she said as she glanced at the screen, still scrolling with names. "You know, I'm pretty sure you don't have to constantly stand here and watch these."
"Let's try and focus here, yeah? Wizard? Down there?
Tony's jaw dropped open. "You
Tony raised his hand, cutting him off.  “Steve, I had a great time too,” he whispered.  “I just didn't want you to feel pressured to come over again tomorrow if you didn't want to.”
"Yeah, can't imagine why?" Rhodey grumbled as he pushed himself up to his feet. "I'm gonna get you some food too, all right? Just so the coffee doesn't eat through your stomach?"
"That'll just come with practise, buddy," he murmured. "You remember the first suit that I built, right? The one that you said looked like the Iron Giant?"
Tony wondered. He didn't dare say it out loud, though. Steve's mood was already tenuous enough, and he didn't feel like getting into yet another argument.
"Yeah, he's known about Pete since he was tiny, but that doesn't explain why—"
"Which it will," said Tony. "I'll make sure that it does."
Peter's eyebrows knitted together. "No, Ned, it didn't. I'm not a wizard, right? Or a sorcerer, for that matter."
“No, no, nevermind that now,” Tony interrupted as he took a careful sip of coffee.  “Just tell me what my morning looks like.”
"Is that it?" asked Tomis over the radio. "Did we finally get 'em all?"
"Argh," Tony groaned, thudding his forehead against Steve's shoulder. The last thing Steve needed was to be up at all hours of the night when he was still trying to recover from his Namibia skirmish, but Tony was not in the mood to argue with him.
Peter shrugged. "Yeah, we'll see. So, can you sign it?"
"Of course, Colonel," JARVIS answered. "Dr Banner has been so informed."
“Oh God, Tony, I’m so sorry I was so blind,” Steve says.  “I've been in love with you for so long, I was just too afraid to say anything.  I’m so sorry I didn't tell you sooner.  I love you, and I love Peter so much, and I’m sorry I made you think all this time that I didn't care about you.  And I’m sorry that we never got to go on a real date.”  Almost against his will, his dry, stinging lips curl into a soft smile.  “‘Cause I can guarantee it would’ve been a lot better than this.”
Tony paused to switch out his slide, his eyes dragging along the pilots sitting in the front row until they came upon the blond-haired, blue-eyed man sitting directly left of centre. With his broad shoulders, strong, muscular arms, and expertly sculpted cheekbones, the guy was the perfect poster-boy for Langaran Air Corps recruitment.
"Yeah, you're welcome! Anytime!"
They were about two-thirds of the way there when T'Challa raised his hand, giving the order to open the shield. Blue streaks of the Wakandan spear fire accompanied by the occasional arrow shot past Steve as the shield slowly drew back like a curtain and the war dogs began streaming through, tripping over themselves in their haste to get inside.
Papa shook his head, giving Peter a proud smile. "Wow. I don't think I'll ever get used to just how smart you are."
"Good. Now once you decide that you're ready you won't have any more excuses."
"Hey, Uncle Bucky!" Peter said, with probably more enthusiasm than was necessary. It had the intended effect though when Uncle Bucky gave him a huge smile in return, holding his arms open for a hug.
“You’re welcome,” the man said as he picked up his book again, opening it back up with the same slow, calculated movements he’d used when he set it down.
"Tony," Steve said as he reached for his husband, gently but firmly removing his hands from the man as his twitching grew worse and he started gasping for breath. "Bruce, what's wrong with him?"
His legs completely numb, Steve stumbled, crouching down onto the ground as he reached for the ashes that used to be his oldest friend. He looked up at Thor, tears already welling in his eyes.
"Sleep now, mo grá," he whispered. "I love you."
And, after Peter had answered that question with a resounding “yes!” and got one of Papa’s awesome bear hugs in return, Papa had then proceeded to get down on one knee, take Dad’s hand, and ask him to marry him.
"Sweetheart," Steve said as he shrugged out of his jacket, tossing it somewhere off to the side before reaching for Tony, pulling him close. "Can I—?"
"At least their colours are better," Tony had grumbled, swiftly changing his tune when he returned to his office to find Rhodey sitting at his desk in front of a full plate of food—including two of the chocolate chip muffins that Tony loved—and not one but
Tony scoffed, rolling his eyes. "Move on," he said, practically spitting the words. "Funny of you to believe that there even exists such a thing. 'Cause there doesn't. Steve, I lost—I
They would have to sit the whole team down and debrief them, once it was all over. They owed them that much.
Having Dad and Papa tell him that the first time around it had happened way differently, but then refuse to tell him exactly how?
"Oh Jesus
"Six thousand, four hundred and thirteen, sir," answered JARVIS.
"Strange,
"Up?" Tony said as he reached a shaking hand towards Peter's face. 'Up' was what Peter always used to say when he woke up from his naps as a toddler, and was also the very first word he spoke after he woke up down in Miami.
Steve's heart gave a painful lurch. "Um, with all due respect, Your Highness, as you may have noticed, our team is not currently complete. One of Thanos' minions managed to take both my husband and my son prisoner aboard one of his smaller ships, so I don't believe that we should underestimate what we're about to face. Based on what Bruce has told us, Thanos will not rest until the Soul Stone is his."
But Peter only shook his head, attempting a smile. "Daddy, I'm—I'm sorry."
"You sure you're okay with this hockey game idea, sweetheart?" Steve said once Peter had skipped towards his room. "You were being pretty quiet during the discussion."
And the whole time, Steve never let go of their hands, not even once. Even when the surgeon had to pause so more local anaesthetic could be delivered, Steve's grip on Tony's hand never faltered.
"Last I checked they were settling in for a hockey double-header," Tony replied. "Pretty sure Sam said something about joining them, so…"
"Yeah," Steve said softly. "That's the impression I got about him from Peter."
"It does, sir," answered JARVIS. "Shall I commence with the rendering once my diagnostics are complete?"
"Mr Harrington," Peter said before Papa could open his mouth. "Um, Captain Rogers didn't actually live through the post-WWII time. I mean, not really. He was frozen, remember?"
“Uh huh,” Peter said with a sigh.  “Just… make sure he knows I’m not mad at him or anything.  Please?”
"But you'll still try to come back tomorrow, right?" asked Peter. "Please?"
"Uhh, I hate to interrupt, but we really need to get going here," said Sam. "We're still only about halfway through this."
“Morning, buddy.  Sleep okay?” Tony asked as he planted a quick kiss on the top of Peter’s head, catching a whiff of his green apple shampoo as he stood back up and headed for the refrigerator.
"Of course I'm sure," Tony softly answered. He ground his hips down against Steve's, the friction of their hard cocks sliding together almost enough to make Steve climax right then and there. "I love you, honey. And I'm sorry—"
"Aw, yeah!" Steve yelled triumphantly, his heart slowly creeping back down from where it had jammed in his throat. "Take that you sons of bitches!"
“Find something you like?” the man suddenly asked from behind Peter.  Peter flinched, his heart jumping as he whipped around so fast that he nearly dropped the box.  The guy was even taller than he’d appeared from behind the counter, his shoulders so broad that they took up almost the entire width of the aisle.
Tony laughed, his mischievous brown eyes sparkling in the late autumn sunlight reflecting off the lake. "Why,
"Hey, hey, hey?" Peter said as he waved at her, trying to be as polite as possible in his franticness. His Spider Sense was being continually activated with everything that was going on around them, but the girl herself didn't appear to be a direct threat.
Steve held his breath as the final senator submitted her vote. Nay, bringing the total to—
"Your pizza order has been transmitted, Master Peter," said JARVIS. "Estimated time of delivery is approximately thirty minutes."
A flash of agonising pain flitted across Steve's face, his hands tightening around his belt. "All right," he said softly. "But can I do anything to help? I'm—I'm feeling pretty useless here, and—"
Emoji Key for those who don't know what to say in the comments!
"Oh, and now who's not giving himself enough credit?" Tony retorted. "What about that thirty page essay he's already written for that decathlon competition that's not until April, for Christ's sake? Most of the inspiration for that came from you! And he's got a lot more of your mannerisms and facial expressions than you think, honey. You just can't see it because you can't see yourself, but I can. Plus he's as sweet as they come, and we all know that there's no way in hell he gets that from me, so—"
"Oh yeah," Tony said emphatically. "Oh, he would've had you work for it, of course. Had you stand at attention while he walked around you, checking you out like a drill sergeant, making sure you were worthy enough to be allowed to date me. But once he decided that you were okay he would've become like your best friend. As long as you continued to behave."
Obviously, meeting
Peter crossed his arms, sticking out his bottom lip. "Hmph. Fine."
😣 = the angst is killing me!
"I'd like for you to have me tonight," he said, his voice trembling. "If—if that's okay."
—and therefore potentially reverse anything the keeper of the stone wished to reverse.
"And what if the so-called 'stuff I'd rather be doing' is to sit here with you?" she asked. "Did you ever think of that?"
After that, it would all be over. He would simply go to sleep, and not wake up again.
"I mean, I know they probably don't have the same appetites that you and your papa have," she said once they'd sat down in the kitchen's eating area. "But they still eat a ton."
"No, no, I'm all right, Cap," James said, getting back to his feet just as Bruce landed next to him. "Just need a second or two to shake it off."
Scott sucked in a deep breath. "I came out here to tell you that time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don't have a good way to navigate it."
"Yep. And Strange said that because of that, it was too fast for him to safely generate a portal," answered Tony. "Which means, if we use warp as a basis for our travels through this quantum tunnel, then we technically don't need that final variable because it doesn't factor into the warp calculations."
"I'm pretty sure our new house has a nice bathtub," Steve whispered as his hands slid around Tony's waist, pulling him back against Steve's chest. "It's not as big as that one, but I'm still hoping that you'll enjoy it with me."
Tony shook his head, sniffing. "It's nothing, J. So, the guidance systems are good?"
“Yeah, I guess.  My dad… he works a ton, so he doesn't really have a lot of time for reading.  But he likes that I love it.”
Groaning, Peter pulled the phone from his pocket. "No, JARVIS," he said. "Just ready to go home."
Or any moment, for that matter.
And then, just a couple of months before Tony turned twenty and only six months after the death of his mother, Mr Jarvis died, passing away peacefully in his sleep.
“Um… hey there, kitty kitty,” Tony called through the door, stamping down his embarrassment before it had a chance to take over.  “Ah… is Steve home?  I really need to see him.”
The sickening
“Well… remember those half-baked ideas that I mentioned?  I’m afraid this might be one of ‘em,” says Tony.
"Tony? Who's Tony?" said Hammer. "Oh, do you mean Anthony? As in Stark? As in Stark Industries? Well, if that's indeed who you're referring to, as far as I'm aware Anthony Stark doesn't even run Stark Industries anymore, isn't that true?" Hammer heaved a heavy sigh, his lips pursed in indignation. "And I'll bet that poor Howard is rolling over in his grave as we speak because of it. To turn the company that he built with his own sweat and tears over to someone who's not even in the family, and essentially stealing it from his own grandson, no less? I mean, that poor kid! If that'd been my father, I would've been absolutely furious! Just livid!"
Moving closer to the hospital had been something that Tony had also considered after Peter was diagnosed with his heart defect. But with Howard unavailable—or unwilling—to help pay any of the bills, the cost of trying to find a different house and then move had been too high when combined with the cost of the numerous medications that Peter had to take every few hours.
"Because his name is Peter too, Peter!" Green Lady snapped. "Now, let him go!"
"A time machine," Steve finished. He shook his head, breathing in deeply. "Scott, I'm sorry. But you have to understand what that sounds like."
That wasn't too much to ask, was it?
"Eh, I wouldn't count on that quite yet," said Sam as he slid into the driver's seat. "From what Colonel Phillips told us, now that they're allowed to actually report the news, the news people probably won't stop hounding you guys for awhile."
“Thank you,” Steve murmurs.
"Ow!" he said, rubbing at his arm. "What the hell, Ned?"
“Take your mark,” says the announcer, followed immediately by all of the swimmers grabbing onto their starting blocks.  As Steve bends in half to reach his block, the camera zooms in on his face, which has hardened into a look of frightened trepidation that was nowhere to be found on either of the previous videos.
And unfortunately in this case, being greedy wasn't a crime, it was just… sucky.
"Never thought I'd enjoy being carried around so much," Tony said as Steve crawled up to hover over him, carefully removing his glasses. "But damn if it isn't sexy as hell when you do it."
"Tony—!" Steve started, quickly interrupted by his husband who had been obviously thinking the exact same thing.
Tony, you feel so good,” Steve rasped as pleasure shot through him like a bullet, the searing heat driving back all the remnants of the memories Steve desperately wished he could burn.  Leaning onto his elbow, Steve quickly slid both of their pants down and reached for the bottle of lube he’d stashed under his pillow, slicking up his palm before curling his fingers around both of their cocks.
Slowly, Winter Soldier turned to face Bucky, clicking his heels together and straightening his back as he regarded him.
"Sounds good," Steve murmured into Tony's hair, which smelled so incredible that he felt himself starting to get aroused again. He pressed a quick kiss to Tony's forehead, practically tearing himself away. "Don't be too late, okay? Don't want you missing out on any of the food."
"Of course he did, that was stupid," Tony said. "Who has the authorisation to alter your programming?"
Heading down the hallway, Steve paused just outside the door to Peter's room, his mind swirling with what Sharon's cryptic words could possibly mean. What sort of mitigating circumstances could exist that would be murky enough to prevent a child from getting a potentially life-saving surgery, especially if he was as bad off as Sharon made it sound?
JARVIS ran the simulation again, the grainy image reappearing. Against his instincts Tony forced himself to keep from blinking, trying to gather as much information as he could before his scratchy and exhausted eyes gave up the ghost.
"Stop," Steve said, covering Tony's mouth with his fingers. "You make it sound like you're the only person who's getting anything out of this relationship."
"Yeah, but if I remember correctly,
"And after that, he promised he'd take me somewhere where the mosquitoes aren't the size of goddamn birds," grumbled Bucky. "Which is just about anywhere else."
"No," Steve said, sounding so much like a snarky Peter that Tony almost did a double-take. "No, I'm not gonna just let you sit here and brood all night over something that you had absolutely no control over."
"Dad," warned Peter. "You know you shouldn't be saying stuff like that too loud."
Tony shook his head, trying like hell to keep his mounting rage in check. To discriminate against a helpless child just because his grandfather happened to be a certified asshole was so thoroughly disgusting that it should've been illegal.
decide on what we manufacture.  So as long as we’re not reneging on any of our contracts, I can do whatever the hell I want.”
"Yeah, let's not piss off the Colonel again, gentlemen," agreed Chester as he took up position on Joseph's left, facing away from the mountain with Tomis falling into position on Joseph's right. "Last time I messed up he wouldn't let me fly again for an entire month."
Maybe what they needed now was the little guy.
But now…
A huge thank-you to my wonderful betas She’sLikeTexas, JehbeeEh, and allthesinnersandallthesaints ♥️
He refused to finish the thought, choosing instead to thank Mr Stacy for escorting he and Gwen to the school.
—single dad that Natasha predicted.  And Steve has absolutely
He found both Dad and Papa sitting in the living room when he got home, trying to pretend they weren't waiting up for him but too relieved that he was home to really hide it. He gave them a brief synopsis of the game, including when Uncle Thor's picture flashed up on the huge screen inside the arena as he cheered during one of the on-ice fights.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So beautiful, isn't it?" he said, to no one in particular. "I've always imagined the Soul Stone to be the most striking of them. Almost like it's carrying its very own universe inside."
With a final kiss, Steve grabbed one of the spare pillows, sliding it under Tony's hips before reaching for the lube. Tony bit his lip in anticipation as Steve warmed it between his fingers, nearly coming off the bed as Steve's index finger slowly slipped inside him.
"Yeah, it does!" Ned insisted. "Or… well… you know what I mean. Like, ever since the school year started you've been acting so jumpy and paranoid, and just… well, just
Tony let out a chuckle as the banter continued, a slight flush creeping up his neck as Rogers continued praising the aircraft like he was getting paid to do so.
"Gwen!" he cried as he glanced up at the sky, his heart jumping into his throat as he noticed another incoming fireball. He quickly crawled over to Gwen, curling his body around her as his entire left side screamed in protest. "There's another fireball coming, so don't let go of me, okay? I've got you, but you have to hold onto me!"
"No, kiddo, I'm not a hundred percent sure that I can," said Uncle James. "But we gotta exhaust all of the proper channels first, ya know? 'Cause once we start going down more of the improper ones… well… it might just wind up being us against everyone else a lot sooner than we thought."
tired, such that even the plans he was still trying to finalise were all starting to blur together in his mind, and he supposed he was due to eat something as well. Tony was always getting on him about him pushing himself too hard, he didn't need to go and prove him right.
Steve shuddered as he recalled the searing heat of that fireball, and the shock that he'd felt at seeing someone he'd spent nearly every single day with for the last three years suddenly vanish while being completely and utterly helpless to stop it.
"Snapped?" offered Natasha.
Steve huffed as he squeezed Tony's hand, tears filling his eyes when Tony squeezed back almost as hard.
Peter coughed, a wet, horrible cough that was so slimy it nearly snapped Tony's already fraying nerves.
"Ahh, whatever," Sam said. "C'mon, Sir Bucky. I'm afraid those girls won't let us anywhere near that kitchen until we smell better than we do now, so—"
"This mission is called Phoenix because it represents the mythical bird who dies in a burst of flame, and is then reborn from its own ashes. And that's exactly what we're going to do. We, this team of people who I am proud to call my friends, are going to put an end to the tyranny that we've suffered under for the last twenty-eight years. We are going to raise this country, no, this
Once again, his only answer was silence.
accompanied by the sound of clinking chains as it swayed causing his adrenaline to spike, and he stepped back a half step, aiming a series of quick right-left-right jabs that finally sent the bag off its chains and smashing against the wall, spilling sand as it went.
He had never felt more loved in his entire life than he did in that moment.  He honestly felt like his heart was going to burst with it, something he’d once believed was only real in trashy romance novels.
"And you don't think I'll be safe at the home of a deputy police chief?" Peter demanded. "You think only superheroes with armour and shields and fancy security drones can keep me safe? You know I'm even stronger than Papa, but you still think I'm just some weak little kid who needs to be protected all the time! I could be a superhero too, if you'd just let me!"
"Uh huh?" Tony prompted. "And?"
"Please, sweetheart," he said, his voice trembling. "Please, don't do that. Not now, not while—" He broke off, cupping Tony's cheeks in his hands. "It won't help anything, and right now we need to focus, okay? We need to focus on what we can do to keep this from happening again. On what
A flash of sympathy shot through Steve. He supposed if his own father had carried as much notoriety as Tony's then he wouldn't particularly like his last name either.
But it wasn't Steve's fault. None of it was Steve's fault.
of Peter's heart monitor and the rhythmic
And this time, there would be no possibility of another second chance.
"Um… okay," Ned said, confused. "They've always been that way, but whatever." He jerked his head towards the front of the class where an unfamiliar girl was sitting, her long blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail and her back ramrod-straight, listening intently to the teacher drone on about lab deposits and lunch schedules.
"That makes sense," he murmured. "Not sure how much it helps, though."
"Yeah, I guess," Peter said, trying to ignore the sharp pang of guilt that shot through him. "Is that what Uncle Bruce is doing now? Working on the files?"
As Helen wheeled Steve into position, Tony and Peter took their places at his sides, each holding onto one of his hands. The surgeon had the typical bedside manner of most of the surgeons that Tony had met, but absolutely lived up to Helen's recommendation, working quickly and effectively while answering almost all of Peter's never-ending questions.
But whatever the reason was, it still absolutely sucked.
"Is—is this—are there—" he stammered, dragging his gaze back to Natasha when he just couldn't get the words to come out.
Pilots were supposed to be invincible. But while Rogers definitely looked the part, it didn't take a genius to figure out that something about Tony rattled him.
"Yeah, and you're the one who was just telling Steve that we still need to play by the rules, Barton," Tony snapped. "So which is it?"
Steve scowled, his hands clenched into such tight fists that his fingernails were digging into his skin, leaving behind little half moon-shaped indents in his palms.
“Okay, honey, it’s time to look for Bucky now,” Dad said.  “Remember, you’ve gotta find him.”
"Okay," said Peter.
"Bucky and I will be up in a couple hours or so to start on some dinner, 'kay, kiddo?" said Uncle Sam as they pulled into the Tower garage. "Don't want you and Tony going hungry."
Peter gave a nod. He always enjoyed going grocery shopping with Papa. "Uh huh, that's fine."
It was Papa's worst fear, spelled out right there in front of him.
Tony tapped his fingers on the counter as he waited for Carol's communication frequency to change, letting out a heavy sigh once she was gone.
"All right," Steve said after a short pause. "But I'd like the first few trips to be quick ones. Just long enough to test out the devices."
"We think so," answered Natasha. She tapped the keyboard again, bringing up another photograph. "This is Morris Bench. He was the second name we decrypted in Mongolia, and from what we've been able to find, he was one of the crew members on the Lemurian Star, which in addition to launching the satellites that were part of Project Insight was also rumoured to be testing some sort of experimental generator."
"He's gone!" Tony cried, the anguish he had been carrying ever since Peter had faded to dust finally bubbling over. All of his blood turned to ice, the world spinning all around him as he felt Steve shudder, his arms gripping him like a vice.
"Your thoughts aren't as quiet as you think, babe," Tony said once they broke for air, still pressing soft kisses along Steve's jawline as his fingertips trailed across Steve's chest, brushing lightly across both his nipples. He then tapped Steve on the shoulder, indicating for him to roll onto his back. "Let me make you feel good, yeah?"
Tony snorted as Peter wrinkled his nose and Gamora rolled her eyes. "Um, it never was."
“Holy
"Well, good." Then he tipped his head back against the wall and closed his eyes, and less than three minutes later he was snoring.
Which then led Steve to yet another question: was Anthony Stark working for the Air Corps on his own accord, or because the government decided that he needed to be punished for his father's sins even though Howard was found not guilty?
"That'd be my guess too, Steve," added Bruce. "Which means that anyone who was killed in the battle before we go back probably won't be able to come back either. Only the people who were snapped."
"Of course it is," said Tony. "I'm not so dense as to not understand that. You and Barton should be proud of how well you've been able to steer those kids onto the right track."
“Well,” Tony said with a shrug.  “I s’pose if there’s anything that Howard taught me…”
"Uh huh. I'll go and get the boat ready."
"Yeah, and he thinks the exact same thing about you," Peter said firmly. "He's even told me so. You really have nothing to worry about, Dad. I
"Eh, now's fine, I got a few minutes," said Tony. "And if I see anything funky I'll just set up a quick meeting with Beck and go from there. Sound okay?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Papa, are you okay?" Peter asked as they pulled into the school's parking lot. He slid off the back of the bike and handed Steve his helmet, his big brown eyes filled to the brim with concern.
But to Steve's horror, the creature only batted the shield away as if it were nothing more than a cheap plastic frisbee, sending it flying into a clump of trees near the bank where it lodged about five metres off the ground. Stunned, Steve hesitated for a split-second, just long enough for Tony to get back to his feet and wrap his armoured arms around Steve's waist.
No, Peter would have to sit on this for awhile longer, maybe just until Dad finished working on the MAUDE glasses. He really didn't like hiding things from his dads, it always made him feel so guilty that he could barely bring himself to look at them, but with how stressed they both were at the moment it would be better to wait at least until Uncle Bucky's test with the glasses was over, so both Dad and Papa could at least not be worried about that anymore.
"Yes," said Dr Cho. She stepped over to Steve, placing a gentle hand on his shoulder. "This is how Peter heals himself, Captain. And unfortunately, none of us have any control over it. We just have to give him the time that he needs."
"Nevermind, милая ошибка," Auntie Nat said quickly, giving Peter a big smile. "It's not important."
Peter shrugged his skinny shoulders. "You and Papa never seem to have problems working together, so why should they?"
“I believe the more modern term would be ‘freezer’, Thor,” replies Steve.  “Icebox is what we used to call the machines that kept food cold back in my—”
"Or more than a bit," Steve said through clenched teeth. "Even so, the fact that those military leaders had deemed any amount of civilian casualties 'acceptable' is all the proof I need to denounce them."
"Okay, Scott, just run through it for us again, yeah?" Tony asked, indicating Scott's so-called Quantum Tunnel that was shoved into the cab of his ugly-ass brown van. The van was currently parked directly underneath the huge A embossed on the Compound's outside wall, almost the same exact place where Tony and Steve conducted Peter's first ever driving lesson. "What exactly did old man Pym tell you about this thing?"
Obie scowled as he pointed to the monitor.  “Yeah, you know, ‘cause that’s what it says right here.  I do know how to read, Tony.”
Papa had concluded their discussion by saying that Peter still had a lot to learn about working as part of a team, but that since he had obviously been able to handle himself pretty well during the actual fighting, he and Dad were going to allow him to start training again with the team once Papa's doctor gave him the okay to do so.
Out of the corner of his eye Steve noticed Howard hanging back, shifting from foot to foot as all of Steve's teammates rushed past him to get to Peter, offering their thanks and congratulations. Steve stepped back once Ma and Bucky arrived, allowing them to take his place while he walked over to Howard.
"Well, that's… unfortunate," said Steve. "You don't think Tony will get into trouble, do you?"
Uncle Bucky, tell me what's wrong!"
With a final kiss to Steve's hipbone, Tony crawled back up his body, blanketing him with his own as he met Steve's eager mouth. Steve's arms curled around him as their kiss deepened, flipping them so he was on top, his knees bracketing Tony's hips. He was already hard again, the pleasure shooting down his back like a missile as Tony's legs hooked around his waist, his heels pressing against the backs of Steve's thighs as their cocks rubbed together.
Pym's eyes finally flicked up to Howard then, meeting them for only the briefest of moments before flitting away, but just long enough for a shiver to race down Howard's spine at the intense hatred hidden within them. Something was terribly amiss, and Howard didn't at all like it when things were amiss.
"But?" Steve asked. "What's the catch?"
"Anyway," interrupted Steve. He had heard more stories about Tony's party-fueled and promiscuous college years than he ever cared to remember, especially since Tony was such a different person now that he had been back then. "Raxton wasn't the only other name left on that list, right? There was still one more."
“Always a pleasure, Mags,” Tony says.  He chuckles as Mags tugs him down so she can kiss his cheek, planting another kiss on Peter’s before reaching underneath his hood to ruffle his hair.
Then again, he supposed the threat of being grounded was the least of his worries at the moment. With the addition of the Time Stone, Thanos only needed one more stone to complete his gauntlet. The Soul Stone, which was in Wakanda.
Steve smiled so widely that his dimple decided to make an appearance.
Steve stood next to the life-sized simulator cockpit located in the far back section of the hangar, trying very hard to ignore Bucky's impatiently drumming fingertips on the hull of his own simulator. Colonel Phillips had informed their team just the previous day that since Anthony Stark had finished uploading and testing the new space-travel programs, their usual patrol schedules were being altered to reflect a four-hour simulator session every third day, with the option to stretch the session to six hours if Anthony deemed it necessary.
A stab of pain pierced Steve's heart, one that he pointedly ignored.
“His races have gotta be on here, right?” Tony says as he types
Steve sucked in a sharp breath, clenching his jaw to keep his tears contained. "Tony—"
The arrival of Peter in his swimming trunks pauses their conversation.  Tony moves up to the stands to watch as Steve leads Peter over to the pool.  After explaining to him how to use a kickboard and pull buoy, Steve settles into a chair to watch Peter complete his warmup of a 200 swim, 200 kick, and 200 pull, taking copious notes during each section.  In addition to his nearly flawless stroke patterns, Peter has also perfected the complicated whip kick for the breaststroke, and can breathe on both sides of his body during freestyle, a feat that Steve had to work on for a couple of years before he was able to master it.
"All right, sounds easy enough," Tony said. He pointed to a small structure on the tablet, about twenty-five metres or so away from the entrance and slightly off to the side. "Looks like this used to be another guard tower?"
Hurrying to his office, Tony barely managed to get the door closed before the tears he'd been holding back finally escaped, burning their way down his cheeks. His stack of papers and notes scattered as he slumped down into his chair and laid his head down on the desk, cursing everything that he could possibly think of for being so goddamn unfair.
just saved every single one of their asses?" Tony retorted. "So I don't think it's too much to ask—"
"Sorry, Dad," Peter said, wincing as he licked orange dust from his fingertips. "But I just remembered that I forgot to get you or Papa to sign my permission slip, and it's due tomorrow."
"Oh gods, what now?" Tony groaned as Steve retrieved the datapad, his nose scrunching in confusion as he read the message.
like not being able to anticipate what was going to happen in a battle. "But I don't think this is over yet."
Steve nodded, brushing his thumb across Tony's cheekbones. Tony had said things like that to Steve many times over the course of their relationship, and Steve was always a bit unsure on how to respond. While it angered him that Tony had been treated so poorly in the past, the selfish part of him enjoyed the fact that he now got to demonstrate to Tony just how loved he was.
the best, honey. Barnes and Danvers, they're both damn good pilots too, as are the rest of your teammates, but you definitely stand out from the rest."
“I know a family is still a family even if the parents aren’t married,” he began.  “But, Tony, if it’s okay with you, I would really love it if you would do me the honour of becoming my husband.  I love you, and I love this family that we’ve built together, and I want it to be official.”
Peter watched as Dad and Papa looked at each other, doing the goofy eyebrow-wiggling thing that they often did.
"Yeah, I do have a bit of that, don't I?" Tony said with a wink. He tilted his head, his eyes sweeping across Steve's face. "Do you think she knew that you… that you were…?"
"Bucky? Is he—is he—?"
Phillips frowned as the datapad in his hand beeped with an incoming message. "I just did," he said, scowling as he read. "Seems like the ground squadron I sent past the former DMZ made it to the main Meridian aircraft hangar."
Not only was the Air Corps holding Tony hostage with their ridiculous demands on his time and intellect, they were also apparently sending their pilots in to stalk and harass his boy.
"And I will get used to it. Just like I got used to computers, and microwaves, and—"
"Uh huh," Peter said, breathing a slight sigh of relief. "Thanks Pepper, I really appreciate it."
“Yeah,” he said.  “Go ahead and erase everything.”
"As soon as possible. Yes, sir, I heard you the first time," said JARVIS. "Are you wishing to replace all of the current units?"
“Ah, well, I could always see if Rhodey’s available to babysit,” Tony said.  “Besides, the kid’s twelve already, honey.  Well past the age of thinking that hanging out with Dad is still cool.”
Uncle James wasn't as good of a cook as Papa or Uncle Sam, but he was decent enough, and a half hour later, filled up on eggs and toast and bacon, Peter loaded up a tray with a full plate and a fresh cup of coffee and headed for Dad's lab.
Scowling, Steve lowered his head and kicked it up another notch, his lungs burning as he sucked in a huge gulp of the cool morning air. How is it that he could pull out of a 4G ninety degree dive with only zero point two-five seconds to spare and not even break a sweat, but the mere thought of asking someone that he liked out on a date was enough to make him jittery?
"Yeah, bud, me too," Dad said softly. "But Uncle Bruce and I made a lot of progress today, so I'm really hoping that I'll be able to wrap this up tomorrow, or the next day at the latest." He shot a kind of half-amused, half-frustrated glance off to the side, leaning closer to his screen. "If Uncle Bruce had been better able to follow my directions earlier, things might not have been as bad as they were when I got here. But unfortunately, he unwittingly—"
There was a short pause, and Tony could almost imagine JARVIS tilting his head in thought, if in fact he had a head.
The smell hit Tony before he even crossed the threshold, an absolutely disgusting combination of stale whisky, burnt food, and body odour that Tony was shocked hadn't yet summoned at least one of their nosy neighbours. The inside also felt like it was at least forty degrees, the trapped heat causing the dense, stale air to hover chest-high, almost like a fog.
"What the—?" Tony gasped, completely stunned as Peter—
"I know, Papa, and I am," Peter replied. He quickly downed the rest of his lemonade, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. "Can I be excused now?"
"Oh, no, little guy, that's not what I'm thinking at all," Papa assured him. He curled his arm around Peter's shoulders, pulling him into a tight hug. "I'm just… well… before I met you and your dad, I just never… I never allowed myself to even think about getting married or having a family because I didn't want to torture myself with thoughts of something that I'd never have. And now… in about ten minutes' time, I'll have everything that I ever wanted."
Tony whispered, his fingertips gliding up Steve’s spine as Steve kissed along the column of his throat.  “Honey, are you—?”
At first glance the file appeared to be nothing but gibberish, and gibberish written in Russian at that, which Peter had been expecting given that it came from a HYDRA facility. He squeezed his eyes closed, looking away from the screen as he rubbed at them. He probably should've grabbed his glasses out of his backpack before he started working, but he honestly didn't even know where he'd left either of them at the moment, and he didn't want to risk running into one of his dads before he was done.
"And Peter would know that too, Mr Stark, which is the main reason why I think he chose to go by himself," she said. "If what Dr Banner said is true, then it's possible that Peter saw exactly what he'd be facing and decided that it would be safer for him to go alone. You know, kinda like how the Rebel X-wing fighters were able to get past the powerful defences on the Death Star? The Empire didn't think they were a threat because they were small."
"I'll offer to meet her there the first time," said Steve. "And if Howard gives us any trouble, well… I'll have my uniform on, so he probably won't. All right?"
Shostakov laughs, a loud, hair-raising cackle that sends a freezing-cold shiver racing down Steve’s spine.
"Hey, Nat," Steve replied just as the viewscreen suddenly lit up behind him, displaying a scrolling list of names of the known deceased. A huge knot rose in Steve's throat as the names kept coming, and coming, and coming, seemingly without end, fighting the strong urge to scream at the unfairness of it all.
"Please, don't be sorry," Steve said. He tucked Tony's head under his chin, rubbing soothing circles on his back. "There's no need to be sorry."
“Just be careful when you start mixing all that stuff together, yeah, bud?” Tony says as he lays a twenty dollar bill on the table for Mags.  “Don't need you to go and singe off your eyebrows when you're getting ready to start swimming every day.”
Now, stuck on the precipice of losing both his child and his husband, Steve was no longer sure he could go on. No longer sure he could stand back up after getting knocked down.
"Does it hurt?" he softly asked, his blue eyes radiating sympathy and something else that Tony couldn't quite decipher.
"Yeah, I can't fault you there," said Peter. "But I wish you could've seen my papa's face when I told him that the theme for this year's Decathlon was the Cold War. You know how much he loves history, so—"
He and Tony had had periods of celibacy before. When they first began courting they had taken their physical relationship slow at Steve's request, finally spending their first night together on Christmas night. After that magical first time, it was a rare night where they weren't intimate in some form or another until the Malibu house was bombed, and Steve suffered the multiple gunshot wounds that led to a three-day stay in the hospital.
Steve smiled, that wide, crinkly-eyed smile that made Tony so weak in the knees it would've been embarrassing as hell if Steve had had anything that resembled an ego. But somehow—and Tony had yet to figure out exactly
"X-302 pilots, this is Colonel Phillips," Phillips's gruffy voice said through the comms. "Comm check."
"Oh, yeah. Papa’s told me a bit about that," Peter murmured. Papa had told Peter the story about his super-serum procedure a couple of times, but it was still hard for him to imagine his papa as anything other than the tall, strong man that he was.
"And you know that I agree with you, mo grá," Steve said carefully. "And so do the rest of us. Director Fury never said that we shouldn't be prepared, just that it's… unlikely."
Tony’s heart skittered as his eyes flew to the clock hanging on the far wall.  Sure enough, it was already 7am.
“Yes, please!” Peter said eagerly.  “And I think you should come inside too.  It’s such a cool store, Dad, and I’m sure Steve would love to meet you!”
Tony blinks, nodding a few heartbeats later.  “Yeah, Cap,” he says softly.  “Copy that.”
Papa’s lower lip shook as his fingers curled around Peter’s hand, squeezing it.  “Yeah, little guy, it does.  It makes perfect sense.”
Now, the United States on the other hand, with how many members of upper-level government and law enforcement that were already under HYDRA's rule, the team couldn't really rule out anywhere as a possible hiding place for Steve's prison.
And the thought that he might never see them again, it was—it was—
The ear-splitting
From the Control Room, Tony tapped his fingers on his data pad as he watched the three aircraft fire up their engines and slowly roll out of the hangar, switching on the brand-new viewscreens Phillips had ordered installed in the Control Room to monitor the runway and takeoff points once they were out of sight.
"Maybe not," Tony finally said. "But everything that happened afterwards was. You not only managed to destroy your own life, you also destroyed Mom's and made mine pretty much a living hell. I can't go anywhere without people throwing me dirty looks just 'cause my last name happens to be Stark! And then—" He broke off as tears welled in his eyes, remembering Peter's freezing-cold, pasty-grey skin on that horrible night when he nearly died in his own bed. "And then, your ignorance and incompetence nearly killed my son! Peter almost
Strange scoffed, taking one slow step towards Tony. "I doubt you'd want my help if I offered it."
"Exactly," said Papa. He let out a sort of frustrated chuckle. "You would think that after almost half of the Senate and House were arrested for colluding with HYDRA that things might work their way through the channels a bit faster, but apparently that's not the case."
"Mmm, yeah," Scott said, nearly swooning as he chewed his huge mouthful of banana. Then he popped the cap on his water bottle, downing nearly half of it before swiping his wrist across his mouth. "Whoa. I feel so much better now."
"I just did," answered Steve. He reached for Tony's hand, relieved that he didn't try to pull away. "Please, sweetheart, we need to talk about this. These dreams you're having are upsetting you, and I'm not the only one who's noticed. Peter's worried about you too."
"Yeah, I bet," Peter said with a chuckle. "You think Thanos' army will really try and attack there?"
"Five seconds, Cap!" Sam hissed as he swooped down, swerving to his right at the very last moment. "They're all yours!"
Empty. It was exactly how Tony felt every single time he had to look at the man who was his father. Since Peter's near-death experience rage had worked its way in there too, taking up residence as a very close second, but since Tony didn't often have enough energy to spend so much of it raging at Howard, empty would just have to suffice.
"Show yourself!"
“Merci, Steve!” Jacques says as he shakes Steve’s hand, giving him a friendly smile.  “Congratulations to you on a great victory!”
believed that Tony Stark, of all people, would actually set foot inside it.
It was something that Tony could at least understand, having so much experience with it himself, but that still didn't mean it was the truth.
Tony thought, confused. The pilot wasn't familiar, as Tony was certain that he would've remembered someone that unbelievably hot, but by the way he was glaring at Tony it almost seemed like he knew him, and for some reason had already decided that he hated him.
"What, is it not sappy enough for you, Iron Man?" Sam playfully shot back. "Not everyone can stomach being as syrupy as you two all the time. You know that, right?"
Obie’s bushy eyebrows knitted together.  “Well… yeah.  But two whole weeks?  You really need that long?”
"I believe that's what I just said," answered Strange.
"Oh, really?" Gwen said. "And what's that?"
"I'm gonna choose to not answer that question," Steve said, relief evident in his voice. "I love you so much, Tony. You've made me the happiest man in Langara today."
"What?" exclaimed Blaster Peter. "No, that's not—"
"Give me a second, I'm almost there," Sam cut in. "Let me see what Redwing can find." A second later Steve saw Redwing take off from the back of Sam's pack and swoop down into the building, which was now filled with billowing white smoke.
"John, what the hell was that?" he asked.
"I could ask you the same thing," Tony said, his expression scarily neutral. "I heard there was a bit of trouble during your patrol?"
"Three months," Tony repeated softly as he pressed his palm to his chest.
“God,
"Sure, little guy. What is it?"
"Well, then I guess the myths are a bit different from the reality," said Uncle Sam. "And I'm sure Thor will be able to tell you all about it once we get back."
"Steady!" Steve cried over the thunderous pounding of footsteps, the adrenaline already buzzing through his bloodstream spiking when Thor let out an affirmative roar.
you are, 'cause then we'll end up just sitting here all night and Pete'll end up worrying about us, and—"
Peter jumped back with a gasp as Dr Strange's eyes suddenly flew open and he shot to his feet, frowning as he glanced over at Peter, then at Mantis, Drax, and Quill, standing a few metres away.
“You’re an artist?” He asked, getting up to stand by the window, a sharp silhouette against the violet spectrum of the New York night.
“You have a way with words Barton. But I don’t disagree.” Tony said tapping his bottle of beer in thought. “I’m also thinking Natasha, offer still stands. You’re on their radar. Will you stay here? We lose you, we lose our chance at taking this to trial.”
“We’d need to modify the fabricator but maybe...,” Tony speared the patty on his fork lifting it up, “Jarvis could you download the whitepaper for Beyond Meat to my server. We may have to increase our shareholding to get a hold of - ”
Natasha frowned a deep furrow appearing between her eyes. “I have an appointment in my calendar tomorrow to meet with General Ross and Secretary Pierce. The timing is not a coincidence.” She looked at Bucky. “What did they want to know?”
Steve flashed him a grin as he flexed his arms, knowing exactly what his biceps looked like in this t-shirt.
There’s no love story.” Bucky made a frustrated slashing motion with his arm. “Damn woman is obstinate. If she took security detail like any normal prosecutor who’s on the line, I wouldn’t have to do this.”
Steve slid into the empty spot between Tony and Pepper.
It couldn’t be easy, to always be the different one. Tony was charismatic, caustically witty, a practiced savant in the arts of holding court over public opinion. But Steve guessed the veneer for the deflection it was. A clear misdirection from an uncomfortably towering intellect and a heart that was a little softer than was allowed when your consequence made you public property.
To his consternation, Steve felt his cheeks heat up at the assessment. “Is that a problem?”
Young, beautiful
Steve's hand itches to draw it, somehow capture the magnetism Tony exudes, the brilliance in his eyes, the sharp knowing smile and that tilt to his head that is both predatory and satisfied feline.
He tries and fails to not observe the farewell.
Bucky shot him a worried look. “Also, I got a call from Gabe this morning.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve gave him a considering look as he stood next to him, hands close enough to touch. “Coincidentally huh?”
“You fight dirty Rogers.” Tony told him, eyeing Steve’s muscles unabashedly.
Steve’s mouth is dry at the study in contrasts, the warm olive of Tony’s skin seeming to breathe rosy life into his young lover, the flush across Jake's cheeks, the way he holds Tony's shoulders as if to anchor himself and the shy smile with down swept lashes as Tony whispers something to him.
Once, Clint had placed a friendly hand on his shoulder, observing "This is the world he was born for. It's easy to forget isn't it?" He was not wrong.
Steve was tempted to agree.
Tony sat back in his chair. “If it’s helpful, tell her I asked, additional detail is always welcome.”
“Jealous Cap is my favorite.” Tony gave him a slant eyed look but let his deflection pass.
“He said Ross’s crew have been around, asking about you. Asking about me.”
Steve likes him.
There was a resolution in Tony’s voice, a line he was crossing mentally. Taking his hand, Steve stood to follow, the hairs on his neck prickling once more as he remembered Clint’s words.
Steve felt the hairs on his neck prickle at Clint’s portentous words.
“Yes that could work, the tri-chains in that heme make-up could work better.” Bruce agreed, eyeing his own burger.
Printing ‘Iron Monger drops off grid’ neatly next to the current date, Steve dropped the whiteboard marker into its holder.
So no, Tony doesn't have a type.
“I mean it’s obvious right? There’s a correlation between Stane’s black ledger and the shipments Zola received.” Clint was leaning back in his chair, flipping a pen between his fingers. “But why does it feel a little like we are punching above our weight here Cap?”
"Pleasure’s mine, was good meeting you."
"I think I better go." Jake is smiling, slightly sheepish. "Thanks for the company Captain."
“Really Steve, you’re in your boxers, you can call me Pepper.” Her smile was quick and sharp, “I knew you moved fast Tony but this has got to be a record.”
“That’s very ham-handed surveillance.” Tony said looking at Steve.
“Or they wanted us to know.” Steve’s voice was quiet. “Feels like lines are being drawn in the sand.”
“Well Cap, if I hadn’t met Stark, I’d say all this was utter bullshit too, grand conspiracy theories and super soldiers-” He pointed at Tony with his chin. “But look at him, he’s walking around with enough energy in his chest cavity to fuel a small city, he built an AI that makes Skynet look like an inevitability and has a security clearance higher than the Chief of Police.”
“I suspect -” Steve stepped back with an appreciative gaze sweeping over Tony. “that you know exactly what you look like in them and are well aware of the impact it has on me. Would you have me spell it out for you?”
“I resent that Barton. I’m harmless.”
Steve had spent time catching up on his emails and was late to dinner. The lighting had been dimmed and someone had lit the candles in the center of the table. The skyline of Manhattan glittered through the bank of windows. The table was set with kintsugi porcelain dinnerware and matching cutlery and to Steve’s amusement baskets of burgers and fries from the Portuguese burger place Tony favored.
“Is that right?”
There’s a short huff of laughter. Tony bumps his shoulder in a friendly manner.
This morning is no different.
And whatever type they are, they are never around for longer than a night.
Steve considered the white board with a frown. “You’re not wrong. It’s one thing for Stane to have been illegally selling firearms or energy tech to rebel factionists and completely another to fund the development of super soldiers on American soil.”
“Natasha and Bucky… have history.” Steve held his hands up in apology to a frowning Natasha.
Tony shared a long look with Steve as Bucky left, “He’s got the tortured Heathcliff look down pat. Also are they actually blind?”
“I was not someone I liked for a long time Steve. I inherited a company that was an essential cog in the machine of war and I did little to question what it was we were doing. I had all the time to build and create whatever I chose. Pentagon ate it up, SI shares skyrocketed quarter on quarter and I was surrounded by a lot of people who said yes and never once did I stop and look beyond the next schema, the next drug fueled high. Then Afghanistan happened.”
He has a dazed look about him that Steve recognizes too well. Jake's eyes track Tony's movements, his body angling unconsciously towards him.
“You can help yourself to anything in my closet.” His smile widened. “Coincidentally, the other door in your room opens to my joint en suite.”
Pepper interrupted him. “Jarvis belay that order, Tony knows there is no science allowed at the dinner table. Bruce don’t encourage him, we can’t have Tony buying you another company on an offhand comment.”
“Jake liked you.”
"Jake's an artist Cap, told him that was your gig," Tony ruffles Jake's curls semi-affectionately, fingers trailing down his face in a slight acknowledgement of the beauty so freely offered. He moves past him grabbing a tablet, settling in at the end of the island clutching a coffee mug. Steve doesn't miss the way Jake had leaned into the touch.
“I was just thinking, I’d like to draw you one day, if you’d let me?”
“Steve Rogers, exhibitionist extraordinaire. I knew it wasn’t a coincidence that your shirts are always two sizes too small.”
“Be honest Pep. Is this the revolution of the hot red-heads I predicted in 2002? Is there a membership? Is Amy Adams on the list or Christina what’s her name the one with the big -”
“Shut up Clint,” Steve said good-naturedly, throwing a fry at Clint. “Thanks for bringing my stuff over Buck. Looks like we’ll be on lock down here a few days longer than I had anticipated.”
“It feels surreal doesn’t it?” Steve asked contemplatively. “There’s a big world out there, trouble around every corner for the foreseeable future and here in the midst of it all, it feels so peaceful.”
Shaking himself with a rueful smile at his own idiocy he puts away the remnants of his breakfast as Tony walks Jake out. There's only so much self-destructive behavior he can engage in before the day has even started.
Steve was still laughing to himself as he stepped into the shower.
“I feel attacked. Pepper I blame you. I demand the alliance of hot red-heads be disbanded immediately.”
“Boys.”
“I have to agree with Stark, Bruce.” Natasha said, delicately taking a bite of her chicken burger.
Peter unwrapped one of the Beyond Meat burgers, dismantling it to expose the patty. “What I was saying is that they use soy leghemoglobin to produce the meat flavor, that’s where they are going wrong. If you used a buckwheat extract -”
Tony laughed at his aw shucks routine. “You are a menace Steve. You know all my buttons and all I’ve got in my arsenal are white shirts.”
Jake puts a hand on Tony's shoulder, who looks up at him with a sweet warm smile. His eyes crinkle and smile lines bracket his mouth. Tony places his tablet down and draws Jake between his legs, one hand splayed across the supine curve of the younger man's spine and the other tilting his chin up to kiss him, lingering and deep. Steve doesn’t need super soldier hearing to pick up on the moan that escapes Jake. The way his pupils are blown.
“That brings us full circle to where we are now.”
I actually like Beyond Meat - please don't sue me, Tony's opinions are always his own.
“I can take care of myself, do not concern yourself.” Natasha’s voice was cold as she shot Bucky a glare before turning to Tony. ‘But I will take you up on your offer Stark. Thank you. I suggest we reconvene in the morning, I’ll be interested to sit in on Peter and Bruce’s debrief as well.”
“Super soldiers sounded like the sort of crazy shit a nut job like Zola would cook up. But when you’ve got the largest Arms conglomerate in the US funding it you’ve got to start asking questions.” Clint shook his head, “Christ next we’ll be finding out Stark is Bruce Wayne and the scarier part of that sentence is that I can actually believe it.”
“I’ll be sure to add it as an agenda item Mr Stark.” Pepper said, sotto voce.
Lysander helplessly smitten by beautiful Puck, Steve thinks.
Steve stayed still, despite the temptation to offer comfort.
By the time the burrito is finished, Jake has lost his self-conscious air and his eyes are clear as he talks animatedly about his work as a restoration artist for NYU's archival collections.
Steve sat forward in interest as did Natasha. Gabe was a member of the Howling Commandos, the elite unit Steve and Bucky had been posted with during the mission that took Bucky’s arm.
He handed Tony another cold beer. “Will you join me for a bit?” He asked tilting his head in the direction of the couch in the sunken seating area.
Bucky walked into an expectant silence, Steve’s old khaki rucksack slung over one shoulder. He wore black jeans with a black tee, the left cuff ripped off to expose the gleaming metal of his prosthetic arm, a red star printed on the metal bicep.
“Come eat Buck,” Clint called him over and the silence was broken as plates and chairs were moved around. Bucky’s stance went from open and relaxed to a state of heightened alertness in the second it took to note Natasha’s unmistakable red hair.
"Come join us, meet Jake," Tony's dropping a plate in front of Jake and pulling up another bar stool for Steve. "Jake, Steve Rogers or you know, Captain America" Tony is grinning.
Bucky looked a bit sheepish. “Am I that obvious?”
“Then we will get this right together.” He let the Brooklyn slip into his voice, “I’m just a simple guy Tony, and you, well you are Tony Stark, my ma would say I’m getting the better end of the deal.”
Its a renaissance painting, a contrast in power and adoration.
"Thanks but I picked up something," the brown bag in his hand is slightly greasy from the breakfast burrito, he holds it in front of him like a shield hoping he won't be dragged into this but knowing he won't leave.
Hands back in his pockets, Tony rocked back on his heels, a sly smile playing about his lips. “Well I can make an educated guess from that blush,” he said as he followed him into the lift. “By the way are you gymming in your boxers? Not that I don’t approve, -”
“Yes, but it’s definitely got something more to do with the man wearing the white shirt.”
Please leave kudos or a comment. I love hearing feedback :)
He looked back at Steve, eyes liquid with memory. “When Yinsen died, taking the fire that was meant for me, that was my first close hand experience with death. When I saw it was an SI semi-automatic that had taken him out something changed inside. I couldn’t unsee it, the sequence of interwoven links that drew a straight line from his blood to my hands.”
Clint nodded. “And unlike the other payments, it wasn’t funneled through cryptocurrency but by someone who had the power to hide their tracks in fiat. I would take the odds that someone was paying Stane to smooth the wheels for Zola. And, I don’t know about you Cap, but there’s only a handful of parties with the resources to pull this off and I don’t want to end up on the wrong side of any of them.”
“When I came back home, there was just one thought in my mind. I had to make my life worthy of his sacrifice.” He stood, holding his hand out to Steve. “Will you come with me? I want to show you something.”
Swallowing down the arousal that was becoming an ever present companion, Steve busied himself grabbing his water and clothes from the bench.
“Of course he did. I’m a likable guy.”
“Pepper this isn’t what it looks like -” Steve protested as Tony spoke over him.
Steve gripped his shoulder, as he walked around him, gathering up the plates to leave them stacked on the counter for Tony’s cleaners.
“They put a bomb in Stark’s car. What do you think they’re going to do to you? Buy you flowers?”
“You asked Natasha to dinner? Pep she’s scary and she doesn’t like me.”
By the time Tony is back, the kitchen is populated with the team in various states of dishabille going through the familiar noisy paces of breakfast. Steve watches Tony argue with Clint over the last cup of coffee, steal a forkful of Bruce’s pancakes and slide in next to him.
The annoying thing is Steve can't help but like most of Tony's lovers. They are generally pleasant, often interesting and always have more substance than Steve likes to attribute to the social sets that throng around Tony. It remains a mystery why Tony never gets serious with any of them. The thing with Pepper was far in the past now.
Resting his forehead against the cool tiles, he let the hot water sluice off his back, for once giving in to the temptation to just enjoy the champagne pop fizzle coursing through his blood.
“It was all him Pep, it was the captain in the gym with the massive do--”
“Okay so that’s a topic that gets you on the naughty list. Noted for future reference.” Tony tipped his own bottle at her.
Close up Jake is even more beautiful, with thick lashes framing wide set eyes and cream for skin.
Tony hummed in agreement. The reflection of the arc reactor’s faint blue light threw his eyes into deep shadow, highlighting the ridges of his cheekbones. There was an otherworldly quality to him that became more apparent in the shadows and vectors of night lights. An easing in the way he held himself. Steve had a startlingly clear thought.
“I’d listen to Clint, Peter. Her list of broken hearts is almost as long as her case wins,” Steve said into the ensuing laughter.
Steve chuckled, “I’ve asked Bucky to bring me an overnight bag, but I had to make do with what I had. Maybe I can borrow a clean shirt for dinner?”
Tony was leaning against the door, hands in pockets, ankles crossed. At some point he had changed out of his jeans and t-shirt into soft merino wool pants and a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows.
“Says the man who knows exactly what impression he’s giving every second of every day.” Slinging the towel across his shoulder, Steve stepped close to Tony. “I have a weakness for all of it, the suits, the jeans, the band tees and mostly the white shirts.”
"Oh, good for them, then.  Well, here's to friendship!" said Arcadia, holding up her drink for Steve to tap.  She threw back her drink; so did everyone else.
Rhodey sighed. "I'm not here to buy you, kid. Well, I am but... Steve sent me."
"Fall back," repeated Steve in his ear.
"We'd like to meet in a more neutral environment to talk these issues over," said Dr. Brazinski.  She didn't need to say that Tony wandering around with his dick hanging out, drinking cocktails straight from the carton, was not exactly a therapeutic environment.  "...and I want to add,
Suddenly his mind conjured up an image of Donner pleasantly filling out some paperwork for child support, and Gideon's rage at Donner being liberated and having his kid.  Tony accidentally snorted a little. "Sorry... sorry, sorry, I know it's not funny, I'm just... I'm just thinking about how fucking pissed off Gideon is going to be if he keeps that kid and it's his after all..."
Steve heart ached for him. At least they were all dead, he reminded himself, which was a strangely comforting thought. Tony, in his suit, blowing them to smithereens. It was a strange and beautiful kind of justice. "It matters to
his last omega."  Fred seemed a bit drunk even though it was only mid-morning.  Apparently he got fairly morbid when he drank.
"That's Steve's handwriting," said Natasha.
"Alrighty, Donner, hold on," said Richard, patting his arm.  He swept out; Tony snarled at him on the way.
fault you ended up in the ground."  Steve's voice cracked and a few angry tears slid over his face.  Tears that were more from frustration than actual sadness.
"I don't really care when we leave," admitted Tony.  "I just like being around you.  ...holy
So, Steve didn't really understand what was happening or what he was seeing. All he knew was that there was a loud hissing sound and a bright light and he felt the floor shivering underneath him at the power of it all. Steve sucked in a breath as the light got brighter, so bright he could barely see. It made him think of what he imagined heaven might be like (when he'd still believed in God) and they'd put him in that machine which made him the soldier he was today. In that moment Steve had been sure he was dying- and then, in an instant he'd suddenly never felt more alive.
. She has great theories." Eric was obviously a bit of a fan boy. "She says omegas who act out are actually the most submissive when you break them in."
"Thanks, I might need it," Steve nodded, only half joking himself, and then went to follow Tony down to his workshop.
Fucking hell, how was he hard again?
Steve floored it down the long, winding, almost mile-long drive to the front gates; there were no protesters, only a single black SUV.  Tony's "detail." He waved at them when the gate open, relieved to see it was only Daston and Ido, who waved back and made no move to follow them.  If it had been Beth, she would have followed them for sure.
Steve pushed him away to clean his own hair quickly. "All I have right now is my jeans and shirt from yesterday.  Will they be okay?"
"...he needs me," said Tony hoarsely.  He tried to shoulder past Happy, but Happy blocked him.  Tony felt a surge of anger at him.  Happy wasn't even an Alpha.  How dare he try to take what was rightfully Tony's.  Tony had won him, Tony had stood up to Hammer; Stan was
He couldn't quite believe it had been a year.  A year that he never should have had; his last birthday, he had thought he was going to die.  That it was over. And now he was healthy again and he was bonded; he'd slept nearly every night in a bed with Steve and the thought of living without him, of being alone, of not feeling his emotions, was a foreign concept now.
"...do you mind my asking... did your camp get closed?" asked Phil.
"Maybe...maybe in the morning?" He murmured, words half muffled by the pillow again. "M'kinda dead," he admitted. Steve would usually do this. Run on too little sleep for weeks on end and then his body would just...crash. Need a recharge. His heat had been a mess of fevers and stress dreams and then Tony had been dying. He hadn't gotten enough sleep in about a week and now he was safe and warm and with his Alpha--
Steve was already charging up the steps to the stage.  He walked out and peeked around the corner to view the crowd.  It was chaos. "I'm okay," he said after a beat. "But I have...no idea what's going on.  Send back-up.  A bunch of mech suits by Hammer Industries just went rogue and they're stomping around the expo and we've basically got a right on our hands here."
Donner shook his head and began to back away on the bed, pressing him up against the headboard. "No, no, no... I don't want to get in trouble again. I won't! I won't do this. You can't make me. I need an Alpha."
Tony reached over and hit the disconnect button.
"What do we do?  Have Rhodey buy him?" asked Tony, looking up at Steve.  "Or do we like... put a wire on him, try to bust Gene for whoring him out?  I don't want to compromise Project 84 but we've gotta get Donner out of there, it's our fault that he-- it's
Everyone took a precious second to stare at him.
"You don't have to do this," Steve managed to get out, his voice a little thick. "Tony. Not if-- not if you don't want to."
, Steve.  Call SHIELD, call the National Guard, call... I don't know, call
This dream was new.  Tony had lots of nightmares, but never this one.  He wasn't sure where the fuck it was coming from, because he had been told in no uncertain terms that his parents hadn't suffered.  That they had died on impact. But now, he'd had the dream at least a half-dozen times. The first part was hazy; he was watching the car from the outside.  The part that was clear was the part where his mother was crying. Then he'd reach for her, then he'd wake up.
"Didn't you read his file?" Natasha asked incredulously.
"Our first appointment's at eleven," Steve said as he munched on a piece of fried bread. It was already past ten. He was dressed in a smart pair of jeans and a casual light blue shirt himself. His neck had healed completely from the night before. There was a fresh indent of teeth, but they were faded. There was no sign of any cuts that had caused his gland to leak, thankfully. The bite on Steve's shoulder was also, of course, completely gone.
what they're calling it nowadays?" he asked in a light joke and moved to turn the TV on. Remotes he could handle (he had been acclimatised in a SHIELD institution, after all).
"I'll let you know how valuable the intel ends up being," Natasha added. "But least we're giving them the chase now, not the other way around. If we achieved nothing else you certainly proved that you're something to be reckoned with."
"Yes, sir.
Tony's breath hitched a little when Steve gripped his shoulders and slowly sat on his cock.  Steve was a slippery mess but still a satisfyingly tight fit. He reached out and put his hands on Steve's hips, arching automatically when Steve squeezed himself down onto the knot.  Slowly, delicately, Steve began moving on top of him; despite Steve's size, he was always surprisingly self-aware in bed. Tony wasn't sure whether that was on purpose or not. But Steve had never handled him roughly... though when it came to being fucked, Steve loved it rough and could take it like no other.
"Tony...?"
He was much, much more interested in what the psychologist had just said.  "Omegas can be forced into heat?" he asked.  Was this common knowledge?  Tony wasn't sure, but he was intrigued.
," slurred Tony, giving another kick.  "Who designed these stupid pants?"
Steve couldn't say which sense was tripped next.  There was heat, there was sound, there was light.  For a split second the room was lit up in a halo of light, the only sound was the roar of two repulsors going off at once, the hair-singing heat of the explosion.  Steve, Tony, and Rhodey were all thrown back.  Rhodey smashed into a glass case; Tony slammed into a wall; Steve's shoulder caught a sofa and he was flung against a window that broke on impact.
"CUPID, WE'RE GETTING RESCUED!" called Vim against the door, and gave three sharp knocks.  On the other side of the door, someone gave another three sharp knocks, and Tony thought they sounded enthusiastic.
"Since you appeared on air with Danielle McDavid, there's a lot of speculation that you're aligning yourself with Status Alliance.  You should probably publicly state that you're not affiliated with either them or the Horseshoe Society at this time."
"Why not?  I'm worth twelve
to be here. "So, is he playing?"
DeSoto beamed.
"I love you more than marble," replied Tony hoarsely, body shaking.  He hadn't really been kidding about hurting himself when he was talking with Gleason.  Steve was well-lubricated, yeah, but he was still chafing his dick to hell. Especially the knot.
"What the hell is going on here?" Rumlow demanded.
"Well, override the override!  You answer to me, not her!"
. None of you has been through what Steve had.  Not during the war, but before it.  Steve grew up in a time when omegas weren't even considered people, and he grew up sick and poor with no hope for the future.  How dare you act like he doesn't understand or that your lots are worse than his.  I bet you guys all think you've got it hard, but I've seen your goddamn iPhones.  Especially you Eight! Why the hell buy an iPhone
.  He never stopped fighting.  When they took him, both of us fought.  We fought like hell. They wouldn't take me because I--"
"Omega," said Clint, sticking out his pinkies and bringing one down past the other.
"Last year, the grand prize was Donner Malick.  I suppose because he looks like a certain someone..." said Maggie, a glint in her eye.
"Come on, give me a break, lady, I'm drunk and I'm worried about my mate."
Steve looked about ready to murder him.
Steve's phone went off.
"Oh, dear.  That's a bit... older than we usually accept.  Our program is for children ages ten to seventeen," said Francine.  "Naturally, by bonding age, it's a bit trickier to imprint roles on them."
Steve lightly grabbed his arm before he could slip away entirely, not tight enough to hurt. He stepped closer to him, staring down at Donner's nervous face. "If you ever feel like Gideon isn't taking good care of you, or you don't want to be with me anymore, you come to me - and I'll get you out, okay? I'll get you out." Donner frowned, suddenly looking confused.
"Come on Tony," Steve murmured, voice thick and heady. He tilted his head to the side, offering more skin as Tony nuzzled against it. "Touch me. Please. Anywhere. Just..."
Steve was quiet for a short moment longer and then he spoke up again.
"If I had been a housewife, I would have been a very badly behaved one," Steve said, eyes twinkling. He smiled down at his phone, secretly a little pleased that Nick had texted him personally.
"You can do this," Steve told him as Tony's gaze finally landed on his face, recognising the other person in the room. He drew his hand back from his shoulder, still on one knee in front of him, almost in an echo of old omega manners from the forties. But Steve didn't kneel for just anyone. "I didn't survive a plane crash and being frozen for 70 years to wake up to all my friends dead or dying to watch you die too, Tony Stark." His words wavered in the air. They were Captain's words, not to be messed with. They carried
"Yeah, man!"  Tony suddenly stood up so fast he knocked over the chair he'd been sitting in and upset the table; his helmet rolled onto the floor with a loud metal clang.  Tony's eyes were wild. "Yeah, man," he repeated slowly. "...yeah… man…
.  First you lied to me about who you were.  You spied on me. Then,
"We went to the beach," Steve said simply and walked past everyone in the kitchen: Pepper, Mac, Clint and Natasha. He headed upstairs towards the main bathroom, gently settling Tony down on a bench before he went to run the water hot.
"I'm going to rip out your spine the minute I get out of this thing." His voice...now that didn't sound right. That didn't sound like his.  It was familiar and yet utterly foreign.
Sam let out a long breath. "So where the hell do we go from here, huh?"
"You need to get your squirrel suit on," Steve told Tony, the edge of his lips hinting up in a smile but he couldn't quite manage a proper one. There had been too many revelations for one day. Steve felt like he needed to sit down for... a while.
"Sorry," said Tony.  "I was trying to bite Steve's psychiatrist, not you."
"That's all I ask," said Boswell with a fond smile, ruffling Banksy's hair.
"You gonna pay with cash, then?" asked the bartender, cleaning up the small spill on the counter.
"-see, this arm piece- this is sort of a single piece.  That's because all the circuitry inside is wired up together.  You've got pistons in here that run the whole length of the arm.  But what I'd like to do is have an armor made up of smaller pieces with fixed circuits in nodes or ports that basically click into each other and can self-assemble.  It's like if Clark Kent didn't need a phone booth anymore... it's like... like, can you imagine, if I could just snap my fingers, have the suit at my beck and call?"  Tony was getting a gooey-eyed look normally reserved for new parents talking about their babies.  "...the gantry's always been the big weakness.." he said softly, sorting around the pieces of wire and metal in front of him like a rat rearranging its nest.  "...that was what killed Yinsen."  His voice had taken on a hard edge.  "...it didn't power up fast enough... it was too heavy... it was locked into the platform..."
Steve was red-faced and sweating a little.  Even despite the oil, Tony looked more ready to go than Steve.
"The war's over."
Tony pulled the face plate down, needing to reorient himself, needing to breathe.
Tony flopped onto his back, then rolled to his side to face Steve, propping up his head with his elbow.  "...do you think it's 'cause you're an omega? I mean... no offense, it's just... you guys are... inclined toward...
Excitement seized in his chest and he tore upstairs.
"Hey," he greeted them as he stepped into the kitchen, hands in his pockets. "What can I do for you?"
"How... how long was I in there?" Steve asked with a swallow.
"So when are you two going to have whelps?  Can he have whelps or did the serum ruin that?" shouted John.
The beach at night sounded nice.  Romantic. Quiet. Tony let Steve fix his hair and clothes with minimal fussing, and the two of them descended the stairs together.  Tony smiled--
Tony leaned back and floated away again, staring up at the sun, squinting a little against the brightness.
Tony flipped open a ledger.  At least, he was hoping, at least Jarvis got paid a fair amount.  Howard didn't seem like someone who would pay omegas and Alphas differently.  He flipped through the old family finances, searching for Edwin Jarvis (or Ana Jarvis's) income, not finding them.  Were they on an annual salary instead of a monthly one? Tony kept flipping. Surely having two live-in servants would be in here somewhere.  He saw the wages for his nannies (
"Yes," he whispered back.  Of course he knew the coordinates of all the bases.  That was critical information. He slid their hands together again and rubbed his thumb over the back of Steve's hand.
Several people were staring at Steve and Tony, wide-eyed, gauging their reactions.  Tony had mostly turned out Frond and was sitting with a perfect poker face, still holding on to Steve's hand, brushing his thumb over Steve's knuckles.  He couldn't fucking believe this woman.
"Steve, I swear to God, you'd better have a really good goddamn reason for--"
"It's good to see you David. We'll get Steve to come downstairs as soon as he's... able."
"It's better than nothing," said Natasha.  "How quickly can you have the--"
Tony looked over at Barton, close-up.  "You got any weird secrets you wanna disclose?" he asked.
Had he gotten through to the auctionees? Shit. If they setting up the stage... probably not. Steve's heart sank.
"I don't think that's--"
"No.  There's no third Alpha.  They're talking about
admittedly also probably true--
" she demanded, eyes widening a little.
It was important to him to give kids like James a chance when he hadn't gotten one. It was as if that made it all okay... that it had been worth it, going through all that shit, to get here so James didn't have to.
"But I had a vasectomy."
But he totally was. Despite not being able to hear Clint, it was obvious that he'd said the right thing to Tony. who appeared somewhat mollified. Steve smiled at what Tony said, and looked between the hand and his face. In a flash, Steve stood up and kissed him. He leaned his forehead against Tony's. "Deal," he murmured.
"Bucky,
"Well, there were... tapes.  Sam watched them. Said it was definitely him that--"  Clint gestured to the back of his head. "The guy he answered to, that Colonel Karpov guy... he's missing.  They've been keeping a close eye on the situation and it looks like... you-know-who... is basically missing too.  I don't know if he went with Karpov or if both of them are on the lam. But they don't know where he is any better than us."
"But it wasn't you. And you're here." Steve breathed, rubbing his thumb over the back of his hand. "Being an alpha doesn't make you complicit in this. You didn't send Ty to that camp. His parents did. You've changed so much in the last year Tony and I'm so proud of you. You can't blame someone for their environment, what matters is their willingness to change and understand."
"There will be odd security team in the forest that we can pick out, but the bulk of hostiles will be in the building itself on the higher floors. Lower down will be where the actual lab is. It'll be hard to get into it. I'm hoping Tony can help us with that one."
Steve froze, the words sending a chill down his spine.
.  So we're pretty evenly matched, to be honest with you.  For the record, it's a lot of pressure to be told you're taking a guy out on his first date.  You telling me none of the Howling Commandos ever tried to buy you a drink?  ...question.  Were they all Alphas?  Or is that another historical lie?  And, follow-up, how the hell did you convince a team of Alphas in the forties to follow you into battle?  Hypnosis?  Bribery?  Empty political promises?  Dish."
"Miss Potts is at a judicial hearing regarding Mr. Hammer's attack on your Expo," said JARVIS as he began running steaming hot water.  "Captain Rogers is on a run on the beach and I have informed him that you are awake. Your diplomatic meeting with King T'Chaka is still on schedule for this Friday."
He hoped that Steve would make a reappearance and he could dismiss her, but Steve didn't, and after a light dessert and a few cups of coffee, Tony and Morgan left to discover Steve's motorbike was gone.
"You want me to get that?" asked Tony, pointing to the phone.  The last thing poor Steve needed was to be bothered by God-knows-who; if it was a reporter, Tony was going to go mental.
Tony's stomach turned.  He'd forgotten about that.  "Yeah, okay," said Tony, scanning the skies for his plane.  "He can call her from the plane, I guess..." He couldn't help but feel a tinge of annoyance that Clint and Natasha were talking to Steve and not him.  Maybe it was that omega solidarity thing. Or maybe it was because Tony was kind of a jerk to Clint.
Designing and building things came naturally to him, but Steve's moral compass... Tony couldn't compete with that.
, then you're k-kidding yourself. The only thing killing Bucky will- will-" Steve struggled to speak as Gideon pressed down on his neck and he let out a strangled sort of gasping sound, convulsing a little. Steve's hands clenched and unclenched by his sides.
The crowd was still cheering and snapping pictures of Tony and Steve embracing.
there; there wasn't any room for a baby. And they didn't even
Aria swept over to help Steve.  "Steve, stop-- stop, I told you I'd make you waffles, calm down."
"...you must feel better.  If you're drawing," said Tony cautiously.  A pause. "Aria has your sketchbook, the one that was in Siberia.  She said it was better if SHIELD didn't see it. Natasha gave it to her.  ...in case, y'know, you want it back." Another pause. "...how's your neck feel?" he ventured cautiously.
"Oh?  What project are you with, then?" asked Natasha dangerously.
"You didn't leave him!
They thanked him when it was all over and shook hands before Steve went to clean himself up and leave.
They took up some good seats on the bleachers, facing the range, chatting freely until Fury arrived.  Then they mostly went silent.  Fury leaned against the edge of the bleachers beside them, arms crossed, face serious as he watched one of the range instructors setting out firearms.
Steve was a shade of beet and Tony couldn't even blame him because she was currently presenting a perfect ass to them and Tony was suddenly very conscious of the wedding band on his left hand and the smell of post-heat in the room (which, while pleasant, wasn't Steve's, and therefore strange and uncanny to Tony).
For some reason he couldn't stop thinking about his first simulation. The Winter Soldier raising a gun, saying sorry and then shooting him. Steve remembered waking up trembling, muttering that the Winter Soldier was going to kill him. He believed it then and even with suspicious about Bucky... Steve believed it now. And that thought alone was chilling.
his face for starters... he'd missed that face. But he recognized that tone too and felt something big coming. He exhaled and looked into eyes.
Tony stared at Steve, drinking in the site of him.  He couldn't help but grin. Steve might as well have been wearing a French maid outfit.
Aria snorted. "Steve like never does what I tell him to. He's awful."
"They still love you," said Dr. Gleason with a wry smile.  "...let's take a look at your neck, then, shall we?" He leaned Steve forward while Steve read over the newspaper.  "...Brent Walker really is a magnificent person. He's one of the few Alphas on the Horseshoe Society's council. ...he's a damned good lawyer, too.  You're lucky to have him. Let's see, here..." He pulled back the white bandage and Steve heard a soft hiss. "Well, this certainly doesn't look very comfortable.  I think we should probably aspirate some of the fluid here... your gland is working overtime and it's producing quite a bit of musk..." A pause. Dr Gleason leaned over to look at Steve.  "I'm sorry. I know that you were born before the discovery of the arvicolina. The gland produces a serum that's full of hormones and pheromones, and it's most active during heats and pregnancies and after bonding.  Due to your body's... rather unusual operations and metabolism, it's gotten a bit swollen with that fluid and I think we need to drain it. Besides, it's infected and I don't want any of that bacteria swimming around in there."  He bent down to retrieve a syringe from his bag.
Tony's eye snapped open.  Steve was kneeling (mmmm) by the bed, his expression serious.
uniform was a no-go.
Tony stepped over him, dropping the face plate, making a beeline for Steve.  Steve was already on the floor, kneeling.
"Oh, really?  Is that why we have five of your six soldiers feral and frozen in Siberia?"
"Huh?"
"You might want to hear what the news is saying," Pepper said with a subtle sort of smile. She had a tablet in one hand, the screen teeming with headlines. "They know what you did in there; there's been a very positive response."
Brennan leaned forward. "Do you think you have to be fighting a war? All the time? In some fashion? Whether it's the Alpha conference, Tony, or James. Do you think you have to have something opposing you so you feel like you can move forward?"
"...you gonna... come back to work soon?"
"Thank you, Captain," said Fury, taking the briefcase.  "This information is invaluable."
But he wasn't sure whether Steve just wanted to order in or not.  He was fine with that. It was difficult to pull himself away from the bed when he was with his mate.
"But you said I should wear a squirrel--"
Obviously his brain just got confused and mixed up me with someone else.  Case closed.  ...Steve, you don't have a brother or something who's an Alpha, right?  ...No, obviously, it was just a mix-up.  Case.  Closed."
On his way home Steve ditched his phone (just to clean up the rest of the SHIELD trail) and got a new one, also grabbing a tray of Danish pastries too for a second late breakfast.  Marcus's reassurance had done a lot to ease his misgivings about taking off his shirt.  He stepped into his apartment quietly in case Tony was asleep and left the pastries in the kitchen before going to investigate.
Steve was watching him.
Tony practically purred when Steve came in, looking like an Adonis, wearing virtually nothing and bearing food.
"Gnn-hn," said Tony incoherently.  He had already ejaculated but was still twitching, rutting into Steve, his knot throbbing pleasurably.  Steve's erection was jabbing into his stomach. "Cum," he managed to gasp at Steve, nosing behind his ear.  "P-please... more... omega..."
"Can you walk?" asked one.
Tony put a hand on Steve's shoulder.  He was feeling uncomfortable, but he was pretty sure a lot of that was his mate's feelings.  "Steve, seriously. You don't have to prove anything to Malick. I won't think less of you if you want to back out of this.  Collars have a really long, shitty history and I'm kinda surprised you were as cool as you were in there."
"Oh my gosh.  Oh my gosh," said Steve, panicking.
thought Tony...
The song ended and they stepped back, not committing to another dance. Haley walked back and grabbed her (it could have easily not been hers at this point) wine up from the table. Steve didn't blame her. He couldn't imagine an auction was actually all that interesting. There was a flash of a camera somewhere; he did his best to ignore it.
Steve loved swimming. Once he learned to get over his dislike of water, or rather the
"It's not just them I'm worried-"
a beloved hero," she correct.  But Tony ignored her, still going through headlines.
Steve smiled over at Tony. He looked good. "Did you warn them that you wanted a collar too?"
going out... it's my birthday, after all," said Tony.  He paused and looked down at his hands. He picked at a hangnail, then put his finger in his mouth.  Tony was a nail-biter, something that his manicurists no doubt found very aggravating.
"Right," Steve said and forced a smile to reassure her. But a strange sense of doubt still niggled at the back of his mind. To people like Howard, he'd never really been more than a bit of fun. He was the amusing, uppity omega who didn't do what he was told and he probably became all the more fun when he was a lab rat too.
"Yay," said Tony.  He reached over to fuss with Steve's hair and collar, as if he had any idea what he was doing.  (He didn't.) His fingers lingered for a second on Steve's neck; he examined the bonding mark. It was like their failed mating session had never happened.  Tony's mark was gone; Bucky's mark was bold and unapologetic. Tony squinted; maybe his own teeth marks were a little deeper, but he also might be imagining it.
he thought, beaming at them.  His friends.  So many friends he couldn't name them, didn't even know them all.
"You know, if you're not with SHIELD now, you could totally make yourself one of these."
Everyone crowded around  to read the texts.
Steve spread his legs for Tony to settle between, one lightly curling around his back as he moved closer. Steve's blue eyes were dark, lips parting at the teasing kiss. He tilted his head, lips brushing together open-mouthed. There was a hint of a smile. "I love-
"...Brock wasn't in on it, was he?" asked Mackenzie with surprise.  "He's-- he's always struck me as a good guy, we've worked missions together."
Tony considered Steve's question for a moment before answering.  "Yes and no. It... it's still you. It's subtle. It's still Steve, though.  You're still my omega. I'll get used to it. It's not a bad smell, just... different, is all.  But still you, and that's the most important thing. That you're alive and in one piece and you're back."  He kissed Steve's skin again, then glanced at the back of his neck.
Tony stumbled up, coughing.  The first thing Steve saw was the bright blue glow of the arc reactor through the smoke, then Tony's body materialize around it.  "--I'm fine, everything's fine!" he coughed, waving his hand to try to clear the air.
Wanda was in the bath, eyes closed, head back.  Hot water was a luxury she and Pietro rarely had.
The car was a suddenly quiet space compared to the noise of the party. It was almost an oppressive quiet, the only sound the traffic until Tony finally spoke. It took Steve a while to answer. He just focused on the feeling of Tony blanketed other him, a comforting weight and warmth. He stared up at the car ceiling, the colour of it a murky grey.
Tony didn't think it would be hard to disprove Spiderman's status.  All he had to do was figure out the guy's secret identity.
"We're willing to let your friend here crawl away if you'd cooperate," said the man.
Steve nodded, taking Tony's hand.
The truck had already started under them and they were headed out.  He gripped the bench he was sitting on, watching her closely, because Karpov had told him to.
to me.  You two are betas, you don't have any excuse, and you
"You and me between then," said Pepper, to Aria.  Happy watched the whole thing with interest, not sure what it meant but more than involved in the proceedings.
"He's part of an older generation," said Tony.  "...Alphas in your day were like that. But they're a dying breed.  Come on, think about Banksy and Ty. The world's changing, Steve, and you're here to see it happen."  He leaned his head on Steve's shoulder as the car pulled away, leaving the angry crowd behind.
He dialed Pepper.
"I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound rude, but why is someone from SHIELD personnel getting involved?" Steve asked, ignoring their initial spout about self-destructiveness.
"...are you fucking kidding me?  You've never driven?"
"Don't beat yourself up over this, Tony.  We've got Hammer in custody and no one's blaming you for this.  Things could have been a lot worse."
Tony's shoulders sagged a little.  He already knew the answer.
The male Alpha had come out of seemingly nowhere. He was dominant, perhaps a bit more than Natasha but not on Bucky's or T'Challa's level. He was wearing a smart-looking suit and had a dark beard that was beginning to grey at the edges. He must have come down from some of the residential rooms no one had time to check yet. Locating children had been a priority over the staff. There was something about the Alpha that screamed
"Rex," he returned awkwardly. He stared at Steve's hand for a moment before eventually shaking it back. He gripped Steve's hand tightly. "I saw you in the audience today. Didn't think this place was your kind of...scene."
"Tommy, please--"
' is passed out drunk. So we can either sit here and awkwardly make small talk into the small hours of the morning, or we can spar. Besides, our relationship is like that. We don't trade partners for sport. God knows why you all think this is normal."
Steve poked his side. "We had sex like twenty minutes ago... you can wait. In fact, I'd be impressed if you could get it up already, old man," he said fondly, only half joking. About the being impressed part- not Tony being old. Steve was really in no position to be calling other people
"--I'm pretty good," said Tony.  That was an understatement. Tony was very, very good.  "I just... I'm still... considering..."
"My subconscious is probably a pretty dark place," admitted Tony softly.  He wasn't sure which was worse: Steve on the outside, looking in, or Steve in there with him.
"LET IT GO, TONY."
Steve dropped it, only because he needed to have breakfast and didn’t have time to try to get any info out of Aria at the moment.  As a rule he tried not to eat in front of mixed company; especially in the morning, his metabolism drove him to consume large amounts quickly, and it was often not very pretty.
Maybe spying on his friends was wrong. But spying on SHIELD itself felt alright. He didn't like the way they kept secrets and the way Fury sat at the top, like some sort of puppet master, tugging their strings.  Steve wanted to be able to challenge them. He respected Fury and he knew part of the reason they clashed was that they were actually quite similar people (not that Steve would ever admit that out loud.) But Fury was always willing to go that one step further that Steve just wasn't. And that was what set them apart so very clearly, and that was also why he couldn't trust him.
"Would you have still wanted me if I was still smaller?" he asked, finally speaking after a pregnant silence.
Gently, Tony shifted Steve on his lap and reached down to unzip his pants.  "Steve... I don't ever want you to run off like that again. I mean it. I told you, already, that losing you was... was the worst thing.  That I never, ever want to let you go ahead. Pushing me away like you did... not calling, not telling me where you were... I never want you to do that again, Steve.  Okay?"
Peter sniffed, nodding against Tony’s chest.  “Yeah, it was.  You know I don't care about how much money we have.”
"Well, yeah," Tony said, rolling his eyes. "But that doesn't mean that I actually agree with him when he says it."
Tears welled in Tony's eyes, threatening to spill over. "Steve, does she—does she
"He's proposing to develop a new type of holographic system," said Pepper. "And while there's nothing inherently wrong with the basic premise of it, there's just some aspects of the proposal that I'd really appreciate your input on, if you don't mind."
"Yeah, we're—we're friends," Peter stammered. "She's in all my classes and on the Decathlon team, so… we've gotten to be pretty good friends, and…"
“Yeah, okay, but none of that stuff’s ever been attached to you—I mean, a person!” protests Tony.  “And without JARVIS, how’m I supposed to—?”
And also the hundreds—if not thousands—of photographs he had taken since then. Steve absolutely loved the fact that even at age sixteen—and a half, as Peter liked to remind him—Peter never shied away from cuddling with his father.
And sometimes the midnight snacks for an extra-hungry test pilot.
"That's right," agreed Tony. "As for Strange, he saw over fourteen million possible outcomes while we were on Titan, so I'm guessing that once he reappears up there, he'll already know that he needs to get himself and Pete and the rest down to Wakanda ASAP."
Before the sandman was even fully formed he let out an earth-shattering roar, sending another freezing-cold bolt down Peter's spine just before he swung his massive fist right at Peter's head. Peter ducked just in time, jumping out of the way and launching a web at the sandman's arm, which ended up going right through it.
But hurt seemed like the absolute last thing on Peter’s mind as the doors to the school suddenly burst open and a pack of boisterous kids came rushing out, all whooping and hollering for the start of summer.  Tony’s heart leapt as Peter came racing towards them, jumping into Steve’s arms and burying his face into his chest as Tony wrapped his arms around them both.
"Tony—"
he thought.
The storage compartment made, Tony leaned back, raking a nervous hand through his hair. He had often wondered what he might say to Mr Jarvis if he ever got the chance to speak to him again, and now that he sort of had the chance he found himself too choked up to say anything.
It was a start, at least. But Steve knew he wouldn't be able to truly rest until every last HYDRA agent had been flushed out from their mole tunnels and arrested.
"Yes, we will," Steve agreed. "But how? The other people from that list are probably still out there, and if one of them manages to get his hands on Peter again, then—"
🐰 = it’s so fluffy!
And then, only three months after graduating, winning not one, but
"Well, I s'pose for someone who's lived all her life in Hawaii, New York sounds kind of exciting," he said. "I bet it's a lot busier than where she lives."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yep,” says Tony.
"Well…" Steve stammered, unsure quite what to say. "Sharon mentioned something about your father having to go to work, so maybe she just thought that you might like some company?"
"That's good," said Peter, just before downing the extra milk from his bowl. Then he wiped his chin with the sleeve of his oversized sweatshirt, wincing when he noticed Steve's raised eyebrow. "Sorry, Papa. Um… I'll get a napkin."
Steve had said, in what Peter had come to call his Captain’s voice.
"That's a pretty bold promise, Your Highness," Steve said as they took their seats near the head of the table. "But judging from how you were able to fend off the attack from space, I guess I shouldn't be too surprised."
“Um, it’s called
"Okay, now you're starting to worry me," Tony said. He brushed his thumb across Steve's knuckles, something that Steve always found soothing. "Did someone say something to you while you were in the kitchen? 'Cause if they did, then—"
Another huge thank-you to my wonderful betas jehbeeeh and allthesinnersandallthesaints 💗
“Oh, you don't have to worry about that, Mr Reeves,” Peter said, licking orange dust from his fingertips.  “My school’s one of the best in New York City.”
Baby steps, but still steps.
"Maybe," admitted Steve. "But at this point I'm willing to take any luck that we can get."
No. Steve didn't like it at all. He far preferred helping Tony and Peter recover from their post-battle stress than worrying about his own.
"Stevie? You okay over there?" Bucky said as he knocked on the metal wall separating their shower stalls, pulling Steve from his thoughts. "You haven't drowned, have you?"
It got so bad on one particularly awful night that Tony broke down, begging Steve to call someone, a doctor or someone at the VA who could maybe come and talk to him.  But Steve adamantly refused.  He’d already tried that.  Already tried talking with doctors and counsellors and other vets, and it had only made things worse.
A few seconds later Tony's repulsors sounded again, this time aimed at the southeast guard tower, accompanied a couple seconds later by the sound of a body hitting the ground.
If they got one single tiny little thing even the slightest bit off, then the whole thing would fall apart. And quite possibly take all of them with it.
"Well, it sure didn't seem like she thought you smelled funny back at the school," Uncle Bucky said. "She seemed pretty smitten, if you ask me."
"Nat's right, Cap," Clint piped up. "Trust me, with things the way they are, this is the way to go until we absolutely can't anymore."
But now—
Steve grinned as he reached for Tony's belt buckle, working it loose so he could slide Tony's pants and underwear down his legs. Like Steve, he was already rock-hard, his erection resting flush against his abdomen, and Steve eagerly licked his lips as he reached for it only to have his hand knocked away.
"Pete? You okay? You're not crying, are you?"
A second later a holographic map of the U.S. Eastern Seaboard appeared, the Compound, Tower, and D.C. buildings highlighted in red.
There was a pause, one where Peter could picture Dad's half-amused frown almost as clearly as if he were standing next to him.
?" Tony shrieked. He looked frantically between the father and daughter standing in front of him, trying to discern if they were lying. "He's been missing for an hour and you're just letting me know
"Oh, that'd be awesome!" Peter said. "Thanks!"
"Yeah, I did," he said. "'Cause as soon as I peered my head over the top of the bassinet, Pete opened his eyes, and he looked up at me with this adorable, tiny baby expression that was something like, 'who the hell are you?' But then once the nurse picked him up and put him in my arms, it was like he already knew me. Even the nurse remarked on how comfortable he seemed with me right away. And his eyes… Steve, they were mine. They were the exact same as mine." He sucked in a sharp breath as another tear slowly made its way down his cheek. "And I knew right there, in that very second, that I would do absolutely
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
"Ma," Steve said, cutting through the fog inside Tony's mind. He curled his arm around Tony's waist, giving him an almost imperceptible nod. "This is Tony."
"Eat, Tony," Rhodey suddenly said from his chair, startling Tony such that he almost knocked over his coffee cup. "'Cause in the state you're in right now you're not much good to anyone."
"Yeah, 'cause living in that Tower with a bunch of superheroes has to be just exhausting, right, little prince?" Flash sneered as he slid into his chair behind Peter. "Give me a break. It's not like they're making you scrub the floors like freaking Cinderella or something."
Anything less than that, a bronze in one of those races, or—
"He says as he swipes my last knight!" Uncle Bucky said as he threw up his hands. "Geez!"
Shuddering, Peter folded himself into Tony again, trying to make himself as small as possible. "They can't have me, Daddy. I'm not gonna be… what they're trying to make me be."
"Dad!" Peter called, straining as the alien struggled to get to his feet, his giant pickaxe flailing.
"Uh, okay buddy. Why don't you just start at the beginning then, yeah?"
As the song comes to an end, Steve hits the
Lang audibly gulped, tapping his fingertips together. "Um… Hank said it was some kind of a signal decoy, something that he built during his SHIELD days. He said he needed it to counteract some—"
"Yeah, that's right," said Uncle Bucky. "From what Steve's told us, as soon as he transmitted the code to activate the tesseract, JARVIS just up and disappeared."
Tony thought.
"Let's just enjoy this, okay?" Papa whispered, only loud enough for Peter and Dad to hear, and a knot rose in Peter's throat at his tone. He sounded scared, almost desperate, much like he had in the hospital right after Peter had woken up until he was reassured that Peter was going to be okay. The fun summer had helped him relax a little bit, but now, after the incident at the lake, Papa was back to being afraid.
"You do?" Peter asked, wincing as soon as the words left his mouth. He was in her house, after all, and if she wanted to sit and watch him eat while pretending to read, then she had every right to do so.
“Yeah, but I’m not the only one who thinks you need to take it easier!” insisted Peter.  “Uncle James says so too.  And so does Pepper, and Happy, and—”
But since Steve has no such reputation, and he knows that Ma is watching him right now from her hospital bed, he picks up his warm-up suit, walks right up to Shostakov, and offers him his hand, ignoring the downright evil gleam in the Russian’s eye as he takes it.
Steve had contemplated the possibility of having Carol take over the tesseract part of the mission and training someone else to deploy the satellites with her, but had ended up deciding against it for a few reasons. One: while everyone on the A-shift had trained in the Phoenix simulators, only he, Carol, and Bucky were chosen for the trial space mission. Making a change this late in the game would not only be asking for trouble, it could potentially raise suspicions in the wrong people. Two: as the de facto leader of their team, it was therefore Steve's responsibility to conduct the most important part of the mission. If anything happened to go wrong with the tesseract itself or its deployment, the whole thing would fail.
And you know you don't have to worry about me, but—"
"No, it's not, and Pete knows it," Tony agreed. "Even if he doesn't like it."
Mr Rogers gives him a wide smile, one that Peter just happens to notice causes Dad to blush.  “That’s very kind of you to say, Peter.  It’s nice to meet you too.”  He starts to cross his arms, then stops, hooking his thumbs into his belt loops as he jerks his head towards Peter’s bag.  “So, it looks like you’ve brought your swimming stuff with you?”
"Sounds good, big guy," Tony said. Bruce gave a nod, barely avoiding bouncing off the corner of the counter before making it out the door.
"Copy that," Tony forced past his dry throat, his palm pressed over his hammering heart.
Tony's eyebrows knitted together. "Hang on. You guys have actually handled one of these stones?"
"Copy that," Tony whispered. He sucked in a deep breath as his faceplate closed and his HUD formed in front of his eyes, glancing over at his husband and his son as his heart started to thud.
A single tear rolled down Tony's cheek, catching on his facial hair. "Steve—"
"Oh gods, Pete, I have
Steve let out a chuckle as he dragged himself out of the pilot's chair, stifling the groan that attempted to escape. He'd been doing nothing but sitting for the last twelve hours, but his body still felt like he'd just ran three marathons back to back. Sam had told him multiple times that mental fatigue was just as exhausting as physical fatigue, and Steve could definitely feel it now.
Tony Stark turned out to be the exact cute—
“Uh huh.  I’m fine,” Peter said firmly.  If Papa was brave enough to go on, then Peter was going to be right there with him.  He checked the monitor, relieved to see that Papa’s vitals were doing okay.  “Everything looks good from here, so…”
“Honey, I don't—I don't know if I’m—”
“You're sure you don't need anything, honey?” Dad asked as he attached the final lead.  “I’m sure Pete wouldn't mind lending you one of his polar bears or something.”
Because while Steve has become sort of used to being in constant pain, he’s not a masochist.  If he had a choice, he would much rather bury his head in the proverbial sand than spend the rest of his life having to live with the knowledge that he allowed himself to be used in the worst kind of ways by someone who was supposed to love him.
"Huh?" Peter asked. "Something's moving? Are you sure?"
There was even a tiny flicker of something else in there. Something that, if Tony hadn't known any better, could've almost bordered on admiration.
"All right!" the guy holding him called. "Everybody stay where you are, let's chill the eff out!" He pressed a button on the side of his head, causing his helmet to disintegrate as he pointed his blaster at Dad for a few seconds before returning it to Peter. "I'm gonna ask you this one time. Who the hell are you, and what the hell are you doing here?"
"All right then, little guy, off you go," said Steve. He planted a quick kiss to Peter's forehead, then guided him down the hall to his room, one hand holding Tony's and his other resting protectively on Peter's shoulder. Tony's hands were still shaking as they tucked him in, and he had to force himself to smile as he kissed him goodnight for the second time.
And of course, as a self-proclaimed flyer himself, Peter had insisted on joining in.
Tony opened his mouth, snapped it closed, then glanced over to see Sam's look of curiosity and heaved a tired sigh. He should've known Steve would be able to read it all over his face the moment he saw him.
Steve tipped his head, a soft smile playing on his lips as he trailed the pad of his thumb across Tony's cheekbone, sending a shiver of heat down his spine. It was incredible how worked up Tony could get from such a simple affectionate touch.
"With all six stones I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist," stated Thanos. "I call that… mercy."
"Oh. Well, are you sure?" Peter couldn't imagine why someone as strong as Steve would have trouble climbing a tree, but he wasn't about to pry into something that was obviously bothering him. "'Cause we don't have to. We can pick something else."
Steve's eyebrows knitted together, but he smiled again anyway.
"No, no, New Asgard is fine," said Thor. "Well, at least mostly fine. I swear, trying to keep Loki and Valkyrie from tearing each other apart has become something of a full-time job lately, but… I digress."
When he felt like he could no longer do "it" all day.
Tony blinked as he hung up the phone, still trying to figure out what had gotten Peter so giggly to the point where he was squeaking.
“Sure,” Steve said as a wide smile spread across his lips, revealing a dimple in his right cheek that just about caused Tony to swoon.  “I—I’ll come to dinner.”
"Well, I suppose we'll just have to agree to disagree on that," Davis said, so smugly that Tony had to physically restrain himself from jumping over the table and punching the man. "However, I am also wondering what you can tell us about the assassin known as the Winter Soldier?"
Steve glanced over at Tony, whose look of pure, unadulterated adoration nearly brought him to his knees.
Shostakov Lane 4: 47.74
Steve smiles as he allows Tony’s words to wash over him, chasing away the lingering chill from his body.  Then he tightens his grip on Tony’s hand and closes his eyes, no longer afraid to sleep.
And, according to all the history books, that handful who had experienced it did so under the near-constant threat of war.
"Agreed. And you pretty much just summed up most of our government in a single word. If not all of it."
"Oh, that is so awesome!" Ned said with wide eyes. "Did it work?"
Tony almost cheered when Davis's shoulders sagged at Steve's statement, made even better when Chairman Oklahoma—Tony really ought to have learned his name by now—shot Davis a glowering look.
Gwen pursed her lips, yanking hard on her blonde ponytail. "It's probably better if I don't tell you."
"Again, you assume correct," Tony said with a sigh. "We can't afford to have any of those things offline for even a second, you got that?"
Tony shook his head against Steve's back. "Hell no it's not, and I've already got JARVIS working on it. There's gotta be a commonality in there somewhere, we just haven't found it yet."
"Where exactly was this found?" Steve asked.
Peter rubbed at his nose, fighting against the urge to cry. He was almost twelve, for goodness sake. Far too old to be crying so much.
, Tony, and that's what's killing me," Steve said, so full of agony that Tony's heart nearly cracked right down the middle. "But I can't take any chances, not with either of you. I'm pretty sure that you'll be okay while I'm gone since you'll be there at the base surrounded by people who can protect you, but Peter—sweetheart, he
"Steve?" he heard as soon as the empty, darkened plain appeared before him, dotted with the light of distant stars. It was Tony.
“Okay, Cap, here we go,” Tony says, his fingers tightening around Steve’s ankle and just below his knee.  “Three… two… one… !”
(See the end of the chapter for
As soon as his screen went blank, Peter flopped facedown onto the bed, hard enough to send his polar bear bouncing over the side and onto the floor. Sighing, he leaned over to grab the bear, hauling him back up and setting him down on his pillow. He'd been really hoping that his dads would've come home from D.C. that evening, but for how tired they'd both looked Peter supposed he wasn't surprised they were spending an extra night there.
"Well, I'm sure we're all a bit tired, but since we're only about a month away from the competition I think you might wanna start paying attention a bit more, okay?" said Gwen. "We're almost done for the day."
"Here you are, Scott," Steve said as he offered him the plate. Scott immediately grabbed one of the sandwich halves, biting off a huge chunk and groaning in appreciation.
"That's to help prevent someone else trying to tamper with the program, right?" asked Steve. "Isn't that what you taught me?"
Steve thought for a moment. Ideally they would be able to find this Raxton fellow before he had a chance to get programmed or transformed or whatever it was that had caused the other two attempted assassins to disintegrate, but without a photo or other clear evidence of where he was, he couldn't see how that would be possible.
I'm doing?"
"Okay, so… you wanna tell me what's going on?" he sheepishly asked. "'Cause you seem to be kinda upset, and—"
More tears welled in Peter's eyes, with one escaping to roll down his cheek as Gwen wound her arms around his neck and pulled him into a hug.
"I've heard both the terms," Steve muttered.
about your oath! My son is in danger!" yelled Tony. "And the Avengers have made no such oath, so how dare you stand here and tell us that—!"
"Figures," Tony said. "He's probably going through another growth spurt."
"Thanks, Captain," said Anthony. "So, the first thing we'll run through are the takeoff procedures. Now, following a normal runway takeoff the first thing you'll need to do is…"
"Danvers here."
"No, it wasn't Pete's fault, or our fault, and also why Pete hasn't been anywhere near George Stacy since then," Tony said firmly. "But we've had the girl over here twice now and she hasn't been any trouble, so while I think her old man is a prick with a helluva lot of pent-up resentment and envy, from what I've been able to find I don't think he's a direct threat as long as Spider-Man doesn't show his face anywhere in public again."
Peter glanced at her again, tilting his head. The girl was pretty, there was no denying it. She also seemed a bit aloof, but Peter assumed that was mainly because it was her first day at school and she didn't know anyone yet.
And the two of them hadn't even lasted for half the movie before they were both sound asleep, with Peter wrapped up in Tony's arms and his head resting on his chest, off to the side so as to avoid pressing on the arc reactor.
To Steve's relief, Phillips only nodded as he sat down on a corner of his desk, suddenly looking much older.
"Yeah. You're right."
"Uh huh." Peter huffed out a sharp breath, glancing at his clock. "Well, I guess we better get going."
"Where's Pete?" Tony said, low and tight. "Steve? Where is he?"
"At your service, sir."
"Okay, Papa, I think I've got it," Peter said with only a touch of irritation. "Let's go again."
"Oh, nothing," she said as she giggled again. "Just that you think it's perfectly normal to refer to
"Yeah, and probably where he got his tech too, so I guess that makes sense." Peter paused, wondering if he should even mention the proverbial elephant in the room. Mentioning HYDRA around Papa was touchy, and the last thing Peter wanted was for him to get upset.
"...do you really want to be... taken like that?  Or are you just saying that to make me feel better?  Or trying to punish yourself? Because, believe it or not, I do care about getting my partner off."  Tony was an unapologetically selfish lover who tended to put himself first. However, he also took a certain level of pride in getting his partner off.  He wanted people to walk away with their minds blown, and usually, they were. He'd earned a hell of a reputation because of it.
"Dr. Thompson, with all due respect, no respectable Alpha would likely want her pre-marked.  ...you could perhaps talk to someone about getting her corrective surgery. I believe Lake Sycamore has a program that helps restore omegas.  It's a private school in Michigan that works with younger, troubled omegas. A bit pricey but one of the best. And they do take omegas up to the age of twenty-one."
you!  Steve!"  Tony yanked Steve's arm; Steve had gone pale.
"Drs. Brennan and Brazinski are downstairs for Captain Rogers."
The rest of the day passed in a haze. Some interview was being set up with the
Steve dressed in all black. He had a knife in his boot, on in his wrist and two larger knives at his waist (courtesy of Natasha. A birthday present.) There was no need for a shield against HYDRA. Steve was fed up of being on the defensive. He pulled goggles over his eyes that let him see in the dark and could pick up on heat signatures too. It was StarkTech. Steve didn't like to think about that right now.
"You think of me as a monster?"
Tony sobered up quickly at that.  "Yes. Very tragic," he agreed. "You have my greatest sympathy, your highness."  (Tony clearly had no idea what to call him even though Pepper had already told him.  Twice.)
Tony sipped his beer while Christine had Steve sign her shirt with a permanent marker.
"...that was easy," said Tony with fake bravado.  He crossed the the room towards the ring and picked it up with a pair of pliers.
"Wanna hold her?  When she's done? ...she might throw up on you," warned Donner.
"Well, thank you for coming," said Steve humbly, pulling back, feeling admittedly more sheepish and star-struck than he'd expected to.
"Well... everyone but me has an erection."
"T-Tony...please. I-I..." Steve was shaking, his fingers digging into the sheets.  "You gotta...you gotta do something. I c-can't--"
"Unfortunately, it's rather difficult for us to
The policeman heaved a world-weary sigh and began kicking sand over their fire.
They were seated at a table for two by the window, overlooking coast.  Tony immediately ordered a bottle of wine; Steve was driving, after all.
like last year," she said with a sob.  "Only, last year, instead of a fight, me and Tony and Regan and Mercedes went upstairs... but then he
they could do was fire Malick.
More sympathy noises.
"Yes, this one dates to the Tang dynasty," said the docent.  He looked over Steve and tried to suppress a smile; clearly, he recognized them.  "You know, most people don't
"--Tony?"
Steve glanced down at the text and swallowed.
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and leaned his head on top of his. He sighed softly. He stared at the ghoulish blue glow thrown across the room and the way it made shadows stretch across the walls. He kissed Tony's hair. "Installation piece?" He echoed in a murmur, smile evident in his tone. "I thought it seemed a bit more like vandalism..."
"Live in five," called the cameraman.
"And for the record, I don't take advantage of drunk people," Steve added softly. He noticed the way Tony was looking at the food. "You don't have to eat it."
Tony had not expected Steve to come back; thankfully, he was busy when Steve appeared.  He heard him first, and could smell the faint after-smell of his heat, but his eyes and hands and mind were focused on the circuit board in front of him.  He was wearing torn jeans and a wifebeater; he'd woken to a terrible, burning throb in his chest and retired to his shop as quickly as possible to check his blood toxicity.  Vanko's words floated up again:
"I think one drink wouldn't hurt.  Besides, it'll be good for us all to get to know each other," said Natasha casually.
Karpov was staring at him, his expression a mixture of frustration and sadness.  He heaved a sigh and clapped a hand on the soldier's shoulder. "You see the difference between him and I?  I always forgive you. I always give you a second chance."
"Carter!  Get him out of here!"
Steve wanted to kiss him, but there were children around. He offered Tony a wink before he was led out of sight, poorly suppressing his own grin.
Tony paused, legs and arms making wide, lazy sweeps in the water.  He glanced down. The ankle monitor was wavy beneath the surface. At least they were waterproof, thought Tony vaguely.  Wait, were they? He sure hoped so, otherwise SHIELD was going to have to drive over and give them new ones.
"I'm... I think I'm... more cold than hot, I think.  I... feel..." Tony shook his head. "This is hard."
When the omega turned to him, smiling, and said, "
Boswell rose, passing Tony his half-finished glass of liquor, which Tony took gratefully and poured into his own cup, consolidating them.  "Alright, see you kids out there," said Boswell gruffly.
No wonder Clint, fucking straight-laced G-man Clint, had been so overly willing to put his ass on the line for Steve's civil rights campaign.  Clint supported what Steve was doing because he had some experience. How much? No clue.
"Love you," said Tony, giving his fingers a wiggle.  Steve's body spasmed; Tony slid them out slowly and licked the juice off of them, looking pleased with himself.  He slithered out from under Steve and got up with a smirk. "Okay, I'm ready to go now... how 'bout you, Rogers?"
Nick sighed. "So this all some form of retaliation?" He stepped forward. "I thought you were better than that, Captain."
"Am I expected to say stuff like that?" Steve asked, raising brow as Aria stepped forward to straighten down the collar of his shirt. She smiled a little.
hadn't been an omega captain.  Steve's title had been honorary.  Everyone treated him like a Captain but it was only because he was a super-soldier.  A regular omega would never have been given such a title.  "Can omegas join the army now?" he asked, suddenly curious as he watched Natasha take a dinosaur attack. He almost wanted to ask her the same question:
"--breaking news regarding the live gunmen in downtown Los--" a reporter on the television was saying.
"No." Steve sighed. "Just the usual.  They weren't planning on achieving anything, I don't think. They just wanted to see if it worked."
Aria laughed and patted his arm.  "In style."
Tony looked up at the CCTV's screen, paused on an image of Steve's form lying motionless in the snow, two figures standing over him.  He reached out with one metal-gloved hand and touched it lightly, longingly.
"You do know that Gideon doesn't actually want you back, right, Donner?" Banksy said gently, sitting down on the other side of him. He'd also listened to the recording. Steve had tried to explain the situation to him best he could, that he'd done everything he could think of to try and get through to Donner.
How dare Frond mention him. A man Steve had to drive across state mere days ago to have him put in a freezer because he was a danger to himself. She had no idea. None of these Alphas did. Steve hated it when they patronized him, acted like they were superior...did they know the sacrifice of war? No. Did they know what it was like to have to bury your own friends? No. Did they know what it was like to freeze to death then come back seventy years later? Steve had given him so much to the world. It was laughable that they wanted to take away everything that made him the man that was capable of fighting someone like Johann Schmidt.
have to lock, and I suspect they had a certain image in mind," said Pepper.  "...also, I suspect they'll use any means possible to bar you two from coming when Tony shows up in a collar."
Natasha sighed. "If you come down now I'll do the...
Rhodes grabbed the tag and looked at it.  "..
Guys, I just looked over the massive Word Doc kept by me and my writing partner today.  Looks like we're roughly 3 chapters away from Part 4, which covers:
"For the record. I think it would help if I was in there with you." Steve said as they slipped comfortably into a stream of traffic on a main road. Although Steve soon turned, taking them out of the city and towards the base. He liked getting out of all the chaos and the fumes- even if the base wasn't especially far out. It was something. "It's a very isolating process. You feel so...
One snorted loudly.  "Easy for you to say.  You're famous, and married to a billionaire.  Us? We don't have
In all honesty, Steve wasn't. He'd gotten a lot of confusing feelings around his heat that hadn't really gone away. But Captain America couldn't have an Apha. It wasn't possible. Steve was supposed to represent something, and he couldn't lose that.
Suddenly Tony wondered whether this was about Barnes.  There had been a lot of Barnes-related imagery in his simulation and Steve had been watching.  Remembering Steve's old Alpha made his dander rise automatically, but he didn't want to make Steve feel bad.  Barnes was dead.  Or, if not dead, then missing for sixty-six years and well into his nineties and not a threat.
Tony understood, though, Steve's paranoia of being seen as submissive.  Right now, he was a malleable little puddle of pleasured omega, squirming himself onto Tony's fingers, soft whimpers still falling from his lips.  Somewhere deep in his mind, he made a note to put up some more security measures around the house.  It wasn't only HYDRA who would probably love to discredit him; any tabloid in the world would cream their pants at an opportunity to see Steve like this, helpless in Tony's lap.
"Where are you taking me?" Steve demanded. "Are you taking me home? Have you tried calling Tony yet?"
"It's not
"Did you even listen to the press conference?" demanded Arcadia.  "He's got
It would be easier for him to just turn around so he did, slowly. Steve set his sketch book aside and then moved to kneel down with his back to Tony. But his Alpha wasn't saying anything and that was just making Steve more and more nervous. He wished he could remember it happening. Had he fought against Bucky? Or had he enjoyed it? Both ideas unsettled him.
Behind him, 7UMM-E made a soft whirring noise.
"I was so happy, you know. When we found you and when we found out what you were. I couldn't describe it to anyone who wasn't an O; I don't think they'd understand how much it meant. It meant everything. It meant we could do anything if we could be Captain America."
Steve's mind
Tony rode out his orgasm blissfully, one hand between them, touching Steve; when he'd finished twitching he eased himself down onto Steve's body, still inside him, brushing their lips together.
Alpha and not anyone else.  Not Brooke.  Who was pretty, but not his.
Steve then pulled the phone away and put his hand over it so Bucky wouldn't hear. "Don't you have a safe house, or something?" he hissed at Natasha.
"Well I'd love to be able to pee right now, in all honesty," Steve breathed. It was hard to meet their gazes. It was like...he's betrayed them, or something. But really, he'd just let them down. He'd kind of gone AWOL in the past two months, the calmest period being when he actually took the time to visit Peggy.
"Oh!  Oh, yeah, sure, sorry, yeah... can you sign my phone, it's a Stark phone--"
"Stephen Arnold Ladson."
"But my New Year's--"
"You guys have
Tony brought Steve's hand up to his mouth and kissed his knuckles before giving him a little tug to keep walking.  He was wearing a leather jacket but he was still cold. He wanted to get back to the hotel, maybe get a Hot Toddy at the bar to warm up.  "...you gonna text Clint and tell him about his brother?" he asked, trying to change the subject. "Or should we wait? ...if the guy's... you know... not there after all, it'd be a pretty big let-down."
