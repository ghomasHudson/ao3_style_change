"What the- hey!" Dean almost yelled, annoyed. "Freakin' angels," he said quietly when Cas left him alone again. "I'm calm. I'm fine, damn it. I don't need him anyway," he added, but it was all a lie, especially the last part. Dean did need Cas, and the angel had to know it.
Sam laughed. Dean would never admit to anything. "Yeah? Okay, Dean. Whatever you say." He rolled his eyes. "Look, I'm going out for food. Do you want anything?"
"You're not just a friend to me," Cas said. He wished, more than anything now, that he and Dean were alone. "I fell from Heaven for you. I'm who I am today because you made me see everything I was missing. This is only a small part of what I owe you."
"You thought I'd get pissed? Cas, you're a damn genius." Cas looked up at Dean, surprised.
"I'd do anything you asked of me. Of course I'll stay."
"You are to me, angel," Dean said softly before pulling Cas towards him for a sweet kiss.
"Let's go then, yeah?" Dean asked. "Damn," he said to himself, "never thought I'd see the day I got married. It's freaking crazy."
"I'm here," Cas tried to yell to Dean. "I'm here!"
"I knew you could do it," Cas encouraged him. "Is it done?"
Dean nodded. "Too damn many," he agreed. "But my energy, or whatever the hell you just said-"
It looked good, Cas thought as he took his first bite. He soon found out that it tasted just as good as it looked, if not better. "I agree, this is very good, Dean."
Dean shook his head. He took a step into the portal but held out a hand. "Come on!" he yelled when Cas's face twisted into a grimace.
Dean shook his head even though Sam couldn't see him. "Why the hell would I mind? I'm actually looking forward to having the place to myself," he said, and Sam laughed a little bit.
He took another long sip of beer. He was on his third beer of the night. Dean was seriously considering drinking all the alcohol the bunker had available, because so far he was still thinking about what had caused him to start drinking in the first place.
Dean nodded. "I'll take anything from you," he said. And then, with no warning whatsoever, Dean's lips fell onto his in a tentative, sweet kiss.
"Now I don't, but back then I wondered why you didn't just stay the hell away from me. Even if I'd known that your asshole dad wrote it like that, at least I had you there, you know? I'm freaking ecstatic I have you, Cas. That's one thing he got right."
Dean Winchester would kill God.
"-anything there," Dean said suddenly, coming into the library with his phone to his ear. "Sammy, it's not in the books. Get back here already." He ended the call and turned to see Cas and Jack, gaze falling on the grace and back to Cas again.
"Hello, Jack." Cas smiled and motioned for Jack to join him at a table. "Do you need help with something?"
Castiel was walking around in one of his favorite places around the world. It was a forest, and snow was lightly falling. Maybe he was in Russia, a place he'd often come to in his free time before becoming close with Sam and Dean. The brothers had taken him in as an unofficial Winchester, and now that Cas had gotten a sense of what family really felt like, he spent more time with them instead of by himself.
Twenty minutes later, Dean was opening the front door and Cas was stepping forward to take the brown bag of greasy food from the delivery girl's hands. She didn't leave right away and took her time looking over Cas.
Silently, not wanting to interrupt whatever it was that Dean was doing, Cas watched the hunter walk over to the lance. "Son of a bitch," he said in a hushed voice. Then he said it louder, close to yelling. "Son of a bitch!"
"I know." Jack still wasn't satisfied with Cas's answer. "Then do it."
And the portal disappeared as Dean and Cas emerged in the bunker again. Dean knelt down to inspect Cas's leg. "Shit, you okay?" he asked his angel nervously.
Dean could only nod and smile adoringly at Cas. "I know, angel," he said, kissing the top of his head. "I know."
Familiar faces filled up the rows and columns of chairs outside. Garth was there with Bess and Gertie, his wife and daughter both holding one of the lycanthrope twins. Charlie was seated next to someone who had to be Stevie, her girlfriend that had previously been wiped from existence. She clutched Stevie's hand and squealed when Dean passed by.
Jack had a point. Every glare and insult Dean threw at Cas was keeping the angel around longer, but it still felt like a physical blow each time. "I suppose."
He let Cas take over control of the laptop, scrolling down the page with a narrow-eyed, analytical watchfulness. While that happened, Dean excused himself to go into the kitchen for a beer. With a single acknowledging hum, Cas sent Dean on his way.
When he came back a minute later he was holding two beers and a sandwich on a plate. "I got hungry," he explained through a bite of the sandwich, not even waiting to sit down before he started eating. "Now talk. I'm not leaving until you do," he said in a serious voice before laughing. "But seriously, there's something bugging you, Cas."
Castiel walked towards the window, looking away from Dean.
Dean nods, shifting his weight from one foot to the other, “How did it go?”
“Oh, I’m not coming. There’s only so much estranged-family-time a dying man can take, but you go ahead.”
“No, not that one, that’s the one where I keep the documents and cards. But they only accept cash in lots of those places. Cas, I think I left it on the table.”
“Goodnight.” Cas says, as he turns around and heads towards the stairs, leaving Dean standing alone in the living room.
Dean, who wasn’t exactly at his most stable point, felt tears pricking his eyes.
Sam always wanted more than what they had: a degree, a career as a lawyer, a stable relationship, but, above all, space, agency. After their father died, though, they had found each other again, both in terrible need for some help, some comfort. So they had decided to permanently move out of Jersey to New York. It was only temporary, Sam had felt the need to clarify multiple times, yet years had passed and neither of them, until that moment, had shown any intention to find another place to live.
Jack nods deeply, “He made a deal so that I could live, and I intend to repay him by offering him the choice to get back here. It’s the least I can do.”
“Do you want me to take you home? You don’t have to come along if you don’t want to.”
“It’s in your backpack, I saw you put it there myself.”
“I’ll be home for dinner.” Sam nodded, quickly pressing his palms on his damp eyes.
He digs his nails a little deeper into the skin of his forearm and takes deep shuddering breaths, maybe closing his eyes will help.
There was a distinctively stronger glow around the man, though, even ignoring the wings. A solemn look which had little to do with Jimmy’s kind eyes.
And Dean knows Jody, more than anyone, maybe even more than Sam, is the one who had to fill the gaps left by Cas and mend the bruises caused by his absence, both on Claire and on Dean. So, yes. She definitely missed him.
Dean didn’t remember what it felt like to be free from pain, even his dreams were stained with the horror of disease; it was either in his body or outside of it, leaking from the walls. That dream, however, was different. He could get up from the sofa and reach the mirror without having to bite his lips not to scream while he did that, pain was simply not there.
Dean got closer to the book, words were crowding his mind and his heart, submerging him in the impenetrable fog of revelation.
It wasn’t the first time he had heard that voice, loud and intimidating, but it never seemed as real. So real he had involuntarily allowed himself to hope it was his brother who was talking to him. But it wasn’t him. It was no one, as far as Dean knew.
There’s a cut in the web wrapped around Dean’s lungs and the gust of fresh air blinds him for a second. “Well, - Cas begins, conclusively, patting the blanket and starting to get up – I should let you sleep.”
“Yeah, so they say.”
Cas is sitting next to Dean on the passenger seat and the kids are bickering over Henry Cavill’s wig in The Witcher, which Dean thinks isn’t too bad, but he usually picks Claire’s side on silly arguments, so he keeps his opinion to himself. He sometimes turns around to look at Cas, who smiles delightfully whenever he notices Dean’s eyes on him.
“Dude, you’re gonna have to never say that again. – Dean laughed, shaking his head -- But thank you, I appreciate that.”
Claire seems to ponder the question for a seconds, then she jerks her head in Dean’s direction.
Claire seems to consider Dean’s offer for a long time, then she whispers, “Seems scary either way. But I’d rather not play the damsel in distress.”
Jody laughs softly, “Here,” she says, handing him a steaming cup of coffee, “but, darling, Donna didn’t come back from the dead after seven months, I have seen her only last week.”
“Dean, - and then Charlie’s voice was softer, no more irony or firmness - you shouldn’t worry about this right now, to be fair, you could say this whole situation sort of cancelled out the need for a coming out.”
“You heard that?” Claire’s voice reaches Dean from the state of suspension he has managed to reach and snaps him right out of it. He turns around to see her standing in the doorstep, about to leave and get to the backyard. “He’s here!”
Jack can see Dean going through his pockets.
“Well, my mental well-being doesn’t seem particularly high up on the priority list at the moment.”
“You’re wrong. I’m not righteous and most certainly I’m not a prophet. Find someone else. Someone who is not dying – or losing their mind.”
“She won’t mind a few days out; I was thinking to go on my own anyway. Hunting drains her, I think she does it mostly to spend time together, but I’m not sure it will last if I keep dragging her around the country. So, are you in?”
“You are all remarkably brilliant young minds.” Cas states from the passenger seat.
Dean almost doesn’t notice that it’s the first time he hears his name on Claire’s lips since he died.
Dean shrugs, unable to unleash a certain tightness to his chest. It can’t possibly be that the rush of happiness from getting Cas back didn’t even last a whole day, he can’t be
“How did it go with Bobby? Are you alright?”
Dean does end up falling asleep almost as soon as his body touches the couch and wakes up only to the creaking sound of the wooden stairs. He assumes it’s someone who came downstairs to drink a glass of water, so he doesn’t move, pretending to be sleeping. “Dean?”
“Angels have been cast out of the Empty?” Dean can barely form a sentence with the little air he has left in his lungs.
“Evaporated?” Dean asks, with his heart beating in his throat.
“You really should take the bed; I can’t sleep anyway.” Dean eventually opens his eyes, and it takes him a while to focus Cas, standing in the half-light of the living room, he really should make up his mind and buy a decent pair of glasses.
“Persisting?”
“Yeah, Melchizedek told the story of the rings to answer the question regarding which religion, between Muslim, Christian and Jewish, was the best, remember? Or did you fall asleep mid-story, smartass?”
“What do you want me to say?” he’s terrified by how flatly he delivers his answer.
With Jack, it feels like he is always trying to fix whatever is broken between them, whatever
“I’m not your nurse.” Castiel’s eyes went back to the normal, quiet, blue Dean had come to know very well.
“I’m good.”
“Theology?”
“Hold on, I’ll give you something to sleep.” Dean says instinctively, opening his bag and starting to look for something clean. “Here,” he hands Cas a t-shirt and a pair of sweatpants.
He said it. Dean couldn’t, he danced around the word, dreaded it when it was on other people’s mouth. He had never really pronounced it aloud, he thought. Saying it would make it oddly real. And yes, his headaches, his aching leg, his blood
Ever since Dean could remember Charlie was always in a rush, carrying half open bags and eating lunch on her way to practically anywhere. When she entered Dean’s room, she was drinking from a large cup full of green liquid.
“Who is that?”
They all remain silent for a while, before Kaia comments. “The population of this car looks like the human embodiment of a republican’s worst nightmare, the true downfall of neoliberalism and the nuclear family.”
“Sorry, what did you say?” he manages to ask.
“Listen, guys. – Jody continues, now looking at both Cas and Dean – I hate to do this to you, but Donna and I are both working nights and I’m nervous about leaving these two on their own, they seem mellow now, but, you know, you can never be too careful.”
But as the nurse looked up, his eyes were bright blue, like a neon sign in the night, making it impossible for Dean to keep eye-contact.
“Dean, are you – are you sure?” he asks, tilting his head to one side. Dean is so tense at that point that he lets out a small chuckle.
“Hello?”
Sam was trying to remain calm, Dean could see that, but his voice shook when he asked: “Are you sure?”
“Is Sam not - but then he was hit with realization - he moved out, hasn’t he?”
Claire gives him a crooked smile, throwing the jacket on the backseat. “You really want to win me back, huh?”
“I am. — I, I’ve been thinking about the endless cycle of suffering my family has been subjected to, you know. From our grandparents, through our mother dying at thirty and our father at, what? 55? Hell, I don’t remember. And now Dean. So I’m wondering, what if there is a meaning, something that yet escapes us? What if it was always my destiny to overcome all of God’s trials? Maybe my faith is being tested. There must be a meaning, there must be. So I’m persisting.”
“We’re going camping, Dean. What could we possibly buy?” Claire rolls her eyes, walking towards the door.
What is this, your stage name?”
“We don’t have much time.”
“Stay back, Jody. This place is a death trap.” Dean warns here.
Dean chuckled, trying to mask the sense of reverence he felt creeping up his throat.
He was expecting a burst of anger, sharp words and hurt flooding the hospital floor, instead, Bobby sat at the feet of the bed and asked: “How are you?”
. And I certainly owe you this. I owe you the truth, even if it terrifies me. Because I am fucking sick of mourning you and piling up regrets, when all I want is for us to be together. I’ve been praying for it for longer than I’m proud to admit and I don’t know if you ever heard me, but I’m telling you now. I think we should try this.”
“You know Sam, it just came to me that if both you and Dean are off limit topics we don’t have much to talk about.”
“Well,”
“Why now? Well, I figured as long as we’re on the subject of death.”
“Just three…”
Dean doesn’t have to ask Cas twice before he accepts to join him on a day out, eagerly following him all the way to the garage. There is not much he wants to know either, if Dean is alright, if he remembered to take his wallet, just the regular things. And Dean’s chest tightens when he thinks of how little Cas knows of what is to come.
appeared on the screen. Except no relief came.
It had been a few days since Sam’s visit ended. He was happy to see his brother, even though he never wanted Sam to see him like this. Of course Sam is too damn stubborn for his own good.
for him. He parts his lips, taking a quick breath in "I can do this... and..." He cuts himself off with a silent sob before sucking another shallow breath in.
”What’s going on?” He murmurs, voice thick with exhaustion.
Smiling wide, Dean nods. “I just fucking love you, so damn much.” He says, honest and raw. His face flaming with anxiety as he allows himself to fret that Castiel may not say it back; that it’s too early to say that.
And Castiel wasn’t going to forget it.
Castiel stares hard at the car. He knew this car had value to Dean. More than just dollar signs. He glances at Dean who is already looking at him to see his reaction. Castiel smiles sweetly towards him. “She’s lovely, Dean.” He says, honest.
Dean nods a quick thanks and presses call on Sam's contact, anxious for what was about to go down. How would he word it? Surprise Sammy, I might die soon. That wouldn't go over well and Dean didn't want to give his brother anymore reason to worry about him than what he had to tell him. He would tell him minimal as possible and to not leave California because at this point, Dean was fine. Dean almost didn't notice that Sam had picked up and muttered a 'hello' into the phone.
Suggestive tones.
Dean felt the affects of the orgasm quickly, his head practically spinning from how hard he finished and his body started to slump slightly more into the pillows until he remembered that Castiel was still pounding into him and he could feel Cas' hips stutter and soon enough he was hitting his orgasm. Dean practically sobs in pleasure, even if this wasn't 100% real, sure felt amazing.
Billie was staring at him, silent, expressionless, as usual. “Castiel, can I take you somewhere and can you promise to listen to why I have to say?” She says slowly and those words alone make Castiel swallow thickly, nodding without voice.
Dean flashes Cas a smile, before looking down. "I'm sorry, that was stupid of me to say-" He starts to ramble before Castiel silences him by putting his mouth on Dean's.
"I'm in the hospital. I'm... I'm sick, Sammy. Somethin' called Pulmonary fibrosis. It, well, it's killin me slowly. But don't worry, we both know I'm too stubborn to die." He says quickly.
Cas: Just you wait, Dean Winchester (;
The kitchen was amazing to look at, but he moved through another open way and headed to what looked to be the living room. His hands traced along the back of the couch, authentic brown leather. Dean approved. And he also approved of the brick fireplace that had picture frames placed along the ledge of it. Picking one up, he smiled.
He replies slowly, Dean could hear the confusion going into his voice.
”Ready for a drive? Cas and I were going to head up to see Mom and Dad, you and Eileen should come. Make it a whole family dinner, but Cas gets shotgun.” He says with a small smirk.
Taking as deep of a breath as he can, a choked sob leaves his lips and his body trembles with the emotional pain making a physical appearance.
wrong. Dean took notice of his surroundings which was very posh and sanitized. The couch he was sitting on was a weird lavender colour and he wasn't sure what to think of that, the rest of the living room seemed to be based off that shade of purple as well. There was a small piece of paper beside a silver photo frame of a family that Dean had never seen before. He picks it up quickly, needing to find out everything he could about the clean freak show of a house he was in; Dean reads over the paper quickly.
”Thanks for the coffee- let me get out of here without emotional trauma!” Eileen chimes as she gets out of the chair and heads to the door.
After going through the storage room for a record, Dean only found one. Why the Men of Letters had a record player but not many actual records to play on it, he had no idea.
"You said the case wasn't difficult," Cas said, confused.
"I would love nothing more than for that to be the case, Jack, but there might not be a way out of this. Some things can't be stopped or changed."
"That's good, right?" Dean knelt down again. He lifted Cas's head up and onto his legs. The angel didn't fight it, instead just letting Dean do what he was going to do.
you more than anything." Dean didn't look away from Cas's face, trying to commit everything about the angel to memory: his perfect pink lips that looked chapped, but were probably so soft. His eyes, which were the most beautiful shade of blue Dean had ever seen, and were now gazing at Dean with obvious adoration. His dark hair that Dean wanted to run his fingers through while pulling Cas close, closer than before, so he could kiss him at least once.
"Talk later," Cas gently commanded before he pressed his lips to Dean's.
Cas spent the time leading up to Dean, Sam and Jack's return half lost in thought as he looked through some books. The ring was just as beautiful inside and under lights as it was in the outside world, maybe even more so.
Dean inhaled, taking a moment to collect himself. It was quiet, the sound nearly nonexistent, but Cas had loved Dean for twelve years, before he knew that it was love he was feeling. He'd be able to hear Dean anywhere and at any volume.
Well, that would have to change, Dean decided.
Crowley was also present, looking bothered by the fact he was there. Gavin smiled next to his father and waved in his seat, turning around to meet Dean's eye. Benny, Andrea, Kevin, Jody, Bobby—all there.
Cas held back a pained cry and collapsed to his knees. "Dean. Go!" he commanded.
Dean’s mind refuses to process any of the information he is receiving, holding his breath until the world goes blurry. And then he is here, a gleam of blinding light, and a body lying among the weeds and wildflowers.
Dean can’t pinpoint the reason just yet, but he feels anger heating the back of his neck.
The shakes are worse when he’s driving, and he knows withdrawal is partially to blame, after all the decision to stay away from alcohol – or sleep, as much as possible in order to prevent Michael from taking over in a moment of weakness, inevitably comes at a cost. What he is about to do, though, eclipses any celestial possession or death sentence, in its gruesome power to overturn Dean’s life, or whatever is left of it, just with a couple of words.
Dean thinks about his last case: the broken knee and the blood soaking the wooden floor, the breakdown it triggered. He also thinks of Cas, the two of them wandering around a town they barely knew, trying to find the perfect gift for Claire and ending up settling for a stuffed animal Cas was sure she was going to hate. He’d want him to say yes.
“You must have a really high fever. I should call an ambulance.”
“Thanks for the coffee.”
Dean didn’t remember falling asleep, but it didn’t take him long to figure out he couldn’t be awake either. He was in his hospital room, which at that point had become the setting to most of his dreams. He was sitting straight, straighter than he could manage with the oxygen tube. He blinked and in a second something magnificent and barely conceivable was standing right in front of his bed. A huge set of wings were occupying most of the room, which seemingly belonged to his nurse Jimmy, or at least
“Oh, actually, there’s no need. I think the kids are right, I must have put in the bag.” Dean exhales, a little nervous laughter accompanying his words.
It takes him a few more deep breaths than he originally planned to get the words out, “What we had before was nice, I thought maybe we could try to fix this, if you can forgive me.”
Sam found Dean lying down, unconscious.
“Not like this.” Sam said weakly, looking down, almost as if he was regretting his words already.
“I think I should buy some new clothes.” Cas says, looking down at the coat.
“So have you sent your application yet?” Dean asks to a still a barely awake Sam.
“I have to check something out.”
The room they entered was even darker, only lightened by a handful of candles, with a circular table standing in the middle.
Dean, what’s going on?”
Eventually he spits it out, harsh and quick, before he can stop himself.
“Oh no, he should be here in a second. I had to slow down the fall, you know, not to hurt him.”
Sam didn’t say anything, just nodded. He knew the nurse was right, for most people, at least. However, what was consuming him had nothing to do with Dean sleeping with men, nothing he hadn’t known for years already and that was never spoken about only because Dean would change the subject whenever Sam tried to bring it up. Dean had been a father, a brother and a mother for him for as long as Sam had memory, ever since Mary, their mom, had died and their dad had had  to take on two jobs, travelling all the time, leaving Sam and Dean alone in their apartment as soon as Dean had become able to feed and wash Sam. So in that hospital bed Sam saw his whole family, condensed in one weak, dying, body, quickly fading away before his eyes and he wanted to be anywhere but there to witness it.
“You don’t mean like a deranged homosexual? Because that’s what it sounds like, Sammy. You know I’m not — I mean, that’s not how —“ Dean stumbled halfway through his reply which failed to be fierce and failed to be bold. He was still a coward, after all.
“I’m here, okay? It’s just me, please stay with me.” Cas repeats, over and over until Dean eventually opens his eyes, only to be confronted with blue and worry.
“Yeah?”
“It’s getting late.”
“He was of no use. He’d already told us everything we needed to know
And it was a lie, they both were aware, but what was a small, fragile lie to the enormity of the darkness they were stepping into?
“This isn’t your responsibility, kid. If you don’t feel like doing it, that’s absolutely okay. Cas is probably somewhere better now.” Dean hates how rehearsed his words sound, almost as if he was reading from a poorly-written script.
“The boy?” Claire asks, blood is running down her chin, but she quickly wipes it away with the back of her hand.
“A psychotic break won’t help your physical health either. It’s surely the drugs, though.”
“I wanna go back to Heaven. I serve Heaven.”
– he echoes Dean’s words –, visiting the places from your childhood. I know you feel hopeless, I can see it. But this doesn’t have to be the end.”
“What’s the matter? – he paused, inclining his head to the left in a sign of sudden realization -- You don’t think you deserve to be saved.”
“I will be sent back. And we will have to try and find another way. But I should make it, I have to.” Jack’s voice cracks a little on his last words, the mask of serene bravery he has been wearing slipping for a second.
Before he closed the door, Dean heard Sam crying.
When they reach Jody’s house it’s almost midnight, but a trembling light comes from the TV in the living room and Dean can make out the outline of someone sitting on the couch.
“It’s not about forgiveness. – her voice cracks, frustration slipping through –  I can forgive and still look at you and see
“You could say that.”
As he settled with the idea of death and the boredom of the wait, he realized he was looking forward to hearing that voice again.
Dean chuckled, most of all for Charlie’s intricate eyebrows movements than for the comfort of her words.
When he reaches Jody’s driveway, he sees that Claire’s car is parked outside and his heart skips a beat. They haven’t been around each other much since Cas, which frankly isn’t Claire’s fault, it wasn’t an easy thing to be around Dean those first months. He sends her a text every once in a while, although she hardly answers back, and, if she’s home when he visits, she always makes sure to never be in the kitchen alone with him. Dean wishes he could fix it, he really does, if not just for himself, at least for Cas. He would hate all the resentment hanging in the air.
Dean felt his heart shriek inside his ribcage.
Over the months Dean has fallen in pretty much every trap that was ever set for him, from Lucifer himself to an insignificant demon making fun of him out of pure spite. It is more or less a conscious decision at that point; better to be deceived, trapped and beaten than to risk walking away on Cas, or on the solution he has been so desperate to find, after all what is the worst that could happen? Getting himself killed?
“Threshold of revelation. This happens sometimes when my soul leaves my body. I can see things, like how sick you are. Do you see anything about me?”
“I know, I need some air — and some sleep, too. Sorry, please, tell him I’m so sorry.” And then he picked up his jacket from a chair near Dean’s bed, but didn’t look at him, he couldn’t. If he did look at his face, stuck with tubes and white as his bedsheets, he would have died too. He didn’t look at Jimmy either, or his disappointment would wake him up from the state of detached confusion he had made himself slip into, similar to what he used to do as kid while his father beat Dean up. Trying to get to the maximum level of numbness he could reach, hoping it would shield him from getting hurt.
And Dean has to walk away before Sam catches him choking back tears.
Dean hesitated, words crowding on his tongue, thoughts he didn’t recall passing through his brain, now suddenly coming out of his mouth.
The kind of unfaltering love Bobby was once again offering him left Dean unable to say anything for a while.
Castiel’s voice echoed in the stillness of the scene:
“I’m not taking the shoes. – Dean states solemnly, walking down the stairs. – Cas, I’ve put yours inside my backpack, but I simply don’t think it will rain, so I’m saving space in case we wanna buy anything.”
“I found a new church, had my virginity restored. There’s no girl.”
has broken. Jack, on his side, is so painfully forgiving that it makes Dean’s head spin whenever he thinks of all the ways he has hurt him.
“What?”
“Oh, for real?” Dean asks with fake annoyance, but nobody is listening to him. This is their song, they once had a road trip all together to visit Garth, and Jack asked them to play it about twenty times in a row, so now they all know the lyrics by heart.
Before they left the café, Sam asked: “How is he?”
“We still have to bury aunt Margaret.”
“You’re coughing blood, this is bad.”
Alice
“I think we could take them by surprise, I’ll let them find me alone and then you’ll come and stab them, or the other way around if you prefer.”
“I’m dying.”
“Won’t you catch a cold?”
“What’s wrong?” Cas asks.
Dean is glad when a chuckle comes almost naturally to him. “Things have always been weird and tense between us, in a way.”
Sam was standing next to Dean’s hospital bed, his legs tired from walking around the room for hours, when Dean’s nurse, his name was Jimmy, got inside:
If Dean wasn’t busy fighting the urge to lock himself in the bathroom to crawl on the floor and scream, or cry, or both, he would probably fall asleep. His body functioning on anxiety and several cups of coffee alone after more than 24 hours without sleep.
A part of him felt that it was his fault for the situation he was in, had he told Sam sooner about his condition he might have had the time to process what was going on. But, after all, despite the anger and sadness which sometimes came crashing through his chest, a part of Dean was relieved Sam wouldn’t have to see this, that wherever he was, the Winchester curse would die with Dean.
“I can go to Heaven, I think.” Jack explains, calmy. “If it’s still how it used to be I can easily get inside, but even if they added fortifications, Duma taught me how to access it without going through the gates, it’s taxing, but I haven’t used my powers in months so I should be strong enough.”
“A voice.”
“Why don’t you go see that for yourself?”
Dean read once that in confession, through the verbalization of one’s desires, which in part are precisely to confess, people tend to seek both to affirm the self and to disengage from it, because confession means making those desires more real and at the same time give a sense of closure to them. Dean sees what the author meant now, because to make his desires public through language means in a way acting on them, not swallowing down at the bottom of his wretched stomach. He also read about a type of self-inflected psychological punishment, a dark guilt that preexists the action and leads to the confession, one he has felt for years, even right then, sitting in front of Cas’ frowned brows and piercing blue eyes. He has envisioned the judgment he would be subjected to a million times already, but that feeling will always live within his bones, he knows that now, so he might as well suck it up and dare to defy his senseless boundaries.
"Eh, I don't really care either way," Chuck said, shrugging. "But it's what I wrote, so he has to die. You get it, right?"
"You allowed no room for negative thoughts or doubts. You were so hopeful that you would keep me alive and help me to get better." Cas looked down at himself and laughed. "I discounted it as wishful thinking, yet I believe it was exactly that that saved me."
Sam laid out the ingredients to the spell. Dean hadn't even noticed he was holding them. "You can wait a little longer, Dean."
Dean's heart beat a bit faster at the prospect of giving the angel everything.
"Well, I won't let you be a self-hating dumbass," Dean insisted. "You're gonna have to learn that pretty damn soon, got it?"
the hunter said.
"I have a lot to teach you, kid," Dean said. He broke out into a grin when he saw Cas. Jack followed Dean's gaze and waved, smiling brightly.
"I've been human before," Cas pointed out. "I hardly need lessons."
When Dean looked at Jack, the nephilim looked pensive. "Cas?" the kid asked, uncertain but willing to believe.
He did temporarily stop it when Sam arrived, putting a bag of greasy fast food on the map table and telling Dean he'd call when he got to Eileen's motel.
Cas smiled. "I like this."
"Screw off, Sammy." Dean flipped his brother off, Sam laughing in response. "But yes, okay?"
"Yes, I am." Cas felt himself start to blush. "Let's find something to watch. I want to find something we can agree on, if you don't mind."
Then there was nothing separating their lips. There was just the most perfect, genuine kiss Dean had ever experienced. He let go of Cas's hand to cup the side of his angel's face.
"Dean," Cas whispered back, shifting in the hunter's arms. "I-"
Cas watched Dean the whole time he chewed and swallowed that first bite. Dean tried not to feel self conscious; after all, Cas always looked at him like this, but it was like the guy was seeing everything about Dean all at once.
Now, though, Sam and Dean were on a case with Jack, and it was supposedly an easy job, so Cas had said he'd only help if the situation got out of control. So far everything seemed to be going well.
"Dean!" Sam nearly yelled, no doubt afraid that Dean had drank until he was either dead or passed out. "Dean?!"
Dean shook his head. "You'll just say I'm being a dumbass anyway, so I'm fine, Sammy."
"I have no choice, do I?" Cas asked drily. "Alright. I'll be there soon."
Sam, taken aback, shook his head. "We haven't been in love for twelve years," he reminded Dean.
"Do you want a sandwich?" Jack asked Cas. "I just Googled how to make a grilled cheese."
It was a ring. It wasn't thin or jeweled like women's rings, but a simple band of silver with engravements all around it. There were no words in any language, but more like a design of sorts.
"I'll actually talk about my feelings for once if you do, because there's something you should know, Cas." Dean relaxed (as much as he could, anyway) in the chair. Cas smiled softly. It wasn't often he saw Dean like this.
"Don't act like you're so damn righteous or some crap like that. You literally drank a whole bar once, remember that?"
"I have no intention of leaving you." Even though the words weren't entirely true, they made Dean happy, and only made Cas feel guilty.
"Castiel, do you really want me in bed already?" Dean teased, and Cas knew he was starting to blush. "Go ahead."
"It's not as painful now," Cas admitted. "I can't describe it, but something's lessened the pain."
"Hm? Oh, I liked it, Dean." Cas relaxed against him even more. "I was much more interested in you, however."
"Who's there?" Cas called out, his voice moderately loud. "Hello?"
"It'll be okay, yeah? We've got this," Dean said in an attempt to lift Jack's mood. He looked over to Sam. "What're we even waiting for?" he asked. "Let's freaking go already."
Dean pulled Cas along behind him when the gap between them and Billie was wide enough. Grunting, Cas let himself be pulled through-
Images of Cas's dark hair, pink lips that always looked chapped, and stormy eyes filled Dean's mind. He wanted to see that son of a bitch again so badly it hurt; now his hesitance had been replaced by eagerness. Beer was the furthest thing from his mind for once. "I know, but I really want to see that feathery asshole again," Dean said honestly.
No amount of words in any language Dean could list (including the ones he didn't speak) could accurately describe the tenderness and gentle passion that sparked between them at that first contact of his mouth against Cas's. It left the hunter stunned until Cas put one hand to the back of Dean's neck and his short nails caught on skin in their quest to thread in Dean's hair.
Dean had no idea what to say when Sam started chuckling and shaking his head. "You don't get it, do you, Dean?"
"You already know I love you, Dean, and I hope I can continue to tell you and show you so you never doubt my devotion. When we first met, I was set on a mission from my father, and I was convinced what I was doing was right until you showed me the truth and made me turn against everything I had believed in. I'm irrevocably changed because of you and have become a better version of myself with you by my side. You are everything to me, Dean Winchester."
"You know why I'm not even gonna try? Because Cas loved me, and I'm feeling so damn guilty because I never told him the same! I said 'Cas, don't do this' as he was crying and I freaking hate it! I never told him that--" Dean cut himself off before continuing-- "that I loved him too, do you know how that feels?!
"Don't worry. I'm not leaving," Dean promised. "I'm getting Sammy's laptop."
Jack brightened up with an idea, Cas heard it in the hopeful tones of his voice.
"I've been looking for you, Cas!" Jack said, smiling cheerfully as he joined the angel in the bunker's library.
When Dean turned to leave the kitchen, Sam's footsteps quickly caught up with him. "Wait, Dean. Just listen to me, okay?"
But instead of the angel's ideal outcome-- Dean running as fast as his feet could take him, the sight of Dean's emerald green eyes shining with tears, the all-too-familiar feeling of Dean's arms wrapping around him as if he would never let go-- there was nothing. Nothing but a choked-sounding concealed sob. Cas's heart broke into a million pieces.
"Not everybody has to raise their voice to show they're not happy, Jack," Cas reasoned. Jack nodded, his face serious like this was a life lesson of grave importance. "I promise they will know what I did."
So instead of thinking and saying no, Cas kissed Dean harder this time, wanting to forget everything about his deal if only for a few more blissful seconds. Clearly, Dean was on board, because he responded eagerly.
Cas looked up at Dean. "We simply had a disagreement. It's fine."
"Yes," Cas found himself saying.
"Then you won't leave me, right? Right?! You know that I want you,
"It's freaking awesome, Cas, but you don't just do this, you know?" Dean looked down at the floor, or at his shoes.
"Not necessarily. For that to be the case Dean and I would need to be married, but I know he's like your parent already, Jack."
As Cas shrugged off his jacket and set it on the arm of the couch, Dean tried not to notice how the tension melted from his friend's face when Cas looked over his shoulder at Dean and smiled.
"Could be worse," Dean admitted casually. "But we're not here to talk about me, yeah? This is for you."
Sam said the words according to the book, and then it happened. Black goo-like liquid opened like a black hole next to Dean and Jack, following Jack's grace like a stalker following their victim. It took shape steadily in wet phases, and the end result was an oval of nothingness waiting to welcome the nephilim and the hunter along for the ride.
Damn, he was gorgeous. Everything about Cas was absolutely perfect in this moment-- his bluer-than-blue eyes, his pink lips that looked chapped but still so soft, even his hair was a hot mess. This close, the angel's natural scent took over his senses. He smelled like rain, cold steel, something Dean could only describe as clean, and the tiniest hint of honey.
The appearance of April in Cas's life forced Dean to bury his feelings toward the guy, but after they broke up (which Dean had been thrilled about but didn't let it show), those feelings popped right back up. And since Cas hadn't dated anyone after that—at least nobody that Dean knew of—the feelings were there to stay, at least for now.
"You must have been hurt very deeply," Cas said solemnly. "Remember that movie you made me watch with you?"
He gasped. Dean loved him... and while Cas had already known that deep down, the confirmation was music to his ears.
The angel smiled softly. "Of course. I'll see you soon, Dean."
"When will you be back?" Cas asked, his gaze falling on the ring, which he'd set on a table in front of him in the library. This was one of his favorite rooms in the bunker. So much to read and learn, all in one place.
He always missed Dean when the hunter wasn't around. Cas had grown fond of everything he did, for example: singing along to his classic rock music when he thought no one was nearby.
"I am. I miss him too," Jack admitted, looking down sadly but trying to hide it. Now there was yet another person whose feelings Dean had neglected. And Jack had been Cas's kid, practically. Dean mentally kicked himself.
The Empty wouldn't come for Cas yet, right? He could enjoy this time with Dean, couldn't he? This was everything he'd ever wanted... he had to take advantage of it now before it was too late.
When Dean found the record player, it was by complete accident. Sammy had asked him to get some cursed object from the bunker's storage room and there it was, next to said object and in perfect condition. At most, it was lightly used. So Dean made an extra trip to the storage room just for the record player.
"It's just Cas," Sam said from over his shoulder. "He won't mind a wrinkle or two in your suit, Dean."
Cas looked back hesitantly. "I believe it's-"
"You said yourself that you don't feel intoxicated," Cas countered. "I won't use my grace on you for something like this."
"Answer me, Dean." Cas sighed. He met Dean's eyes and damn, way to make a guy feel bad. Those blue-blue eyes were looking at him with concern and no judgement whatsoever. He was freaking guilting Dean into confessing.
"You're not my mom," Dean huffed. "But fine, damn it. Like five beers. But I'm feeling none of 'em."
"Everything. You changed everything for me. I had no idea my judgement used to be so flawed. Humanity is a beautiful thing." Cas shyly looked at Dean. His Dean. "You especially."
"Wanna watch a movie, angel?" Dean asked Cas a little later. "You can choose if you want. You've seen all my stuff already."
He wasn't alone.
"I never imagined he would be more than a good friend. This is what I've wanted for a long time." Cas found himself smiling.
Something had changed since Purgatory and the Leviathan flower. Almost losing Cas in a completely different world was so much worse than losing him in the regular world. And now, Dean was feeling so much crap where the angel was concerned. It felt like he was losing his mind.
"I know that," Jack nodded. "Why? What's going on?" He put the phone down, confused.
"It won't be just you, Dean." Dean could hear Sammy rolling his eyes. "Cas, remember?"
"Is there a reason you called?" Cas asked.
"If this doesn't work, then damnit, it'll kill me, Sam!" Dean yelled with tears filling his eyes. "Don't make me hope for some crap that has no way in hell of working."
"Excuse me?" Cas asked, confused. He took the beer Dean held out for him.
Dean shot him a warning glare that was more of an empty threat than anything else.
"Get used to it. I'm not letting you go," Dean said into his hair. "I mean, damn, I've waited way too long already."
It had been a week or so since Castiel last came. But Dean wasn’t worried, they texted everyday and FaceTimed and overall it was a stable relationship.
”Whatever happened to my camcorder?” He asks, a soft teasing smile on his lips as he quirks and eyebrow and Dean falls into a little fit of giggles that end with a few wheezes and a soft cough into his arm.
”Relax, love,” Castiel urges Dean gently, giving a loving smile in his direction as Dean pulls Cas’ hand that was holding his to his mouth to press a kiss to the top of his hand.
When Dean doesn't respond, Castiel's hands gently move over him. "Your freckles give you character," Dean scoffs, but Castiel keeps going "I don't see them as your mistakes, I see them as all your wins." He says, keeping his voice soft, but confident in what he was saying.
Dean didn't want to remind Castiel of his hospital experience.
Castiel’s shaking and crying at the end, but he’s laughing too. Dean, the love of his life. Managed to send him one more blessing without him knowing it. The little things that Dean did. Castiel didn’t even realize the television wasn’t on, but Dean had adamantly not had it on. He had been actively listening and he had been there.
However, the male understands what he's trying to motion and nods. "Go ahead, I would say I will not eavesdrop... but we are in close proximity and even the curtain provides little privacy for conversation." He says with a gentle smile playing his very full soft pink lips that Dean may or may not have been staring at.
Barely hearing anything after that except
Dean was far from knowing anything about his condition or how it would turn out. But he knew that as long as he had some sort of fight left in him. He was going to use it to show Castiel that he was more than just an expiration date.
Castiel argued and debated with himself through the pain. He could see Dean’s little smile on the pixelated screen. He clicks it quickly, trying to grasp him as much as he could.
Castiel laughs at Dean's question before nodding. "He owns a candy shop," He rephrases with a smile.
Dean listened intently to every detail, listening to the gravel of his voice and his words how they slurred together a bit, but were still understandable. Dean was happy to listen to this man forever. Even though he didn't even know him.
Dean laughs, relieved and sneaks a kiss to Cas’ lips before Castiel is reprimanding him,
"Dean... It's been spreading and building for a year and a half, maybe more. There's nothing that exists that can stop it." Dr. Jackie says, putting a gloved hand softly on his shoulder.
He calls for Fawn back and is lead to his new room, it smelled bleached but sanitized. He's placed in a new bed, a comfier bed in his opinion and placed on a few extra drugs as Fawn noticed he was moving a bit more stiffly than usual and apparently he looked extra tired. "You gotta get your beauty sleep for your trench coat angel," She teased and Dean tilted his head curiously, drifting but aware.
"Uh... like what it would be like if we kissed." Dean says anxiously, but life was too short to keep it in any longer.
Blinking tiredly, he squints his eyes open at her. She was smiling brightly and seemed very bouncy. Holding a bag and a.
”I just wanted to hear you say it, Cas,” Dean murmurs into the phone, something that has Castiel tilting his head.
The kiss continues after those words, and the kiss deepens until Castiel has Dean under him for the second time that day.
Castiel smiles softly at Dean, watching him with patient eyes. “I assure you, he is, you allowed him to see death as something he can be comfortable with now. He can know that his loved ones are where they should be,” he assures as he rubs his thumb across Dean’s knuckle.
Sam gives a humourless chuckle as his eyes study Dean's and he shakes his head firmly. "This isn't a good ending, Dean. You're dying! I-I can't do this without you, please, Dean." He says shakily, staring down at him, the tears now falling freely.
Dean awoke a bit later from his presumably short cat-nap. It was either too much sleep or too little sleep, judging by the sunlight outside it was too little. He shifts and glances around the room, momentarily confused at why it was just him.
Dean couldn’t help but be a little bit envious, he was happy for him, but he longed to do stuff like that. Minus jogging, gross.
Castiel pulled his lips away, but kept his touch on Dean, kept him close. "Let me take care of you," he repeats softly, "I want to show you that you are amazing, Dean Winchester. I want to show you how to love yourself how I love you." He says gently, letting his lips brush Dean's; reveling in the fact that Dean's eyes fluttered and his face flushed with every touch of their mouths.
Castiel goes right to tracing along Dean's side slightly, keeping his other hand in his hair; Dean leaned into the touch, shuddering, touch deprived it felt like. Dean's eyes fluttered closed at the motion of Cas running his fingers through Dean's hair, but his eyes open quickly went he realizes that Cas is leaning over him now. Trench-coat was removed, leaving on everything else. The black blazer hugged his shoulders and made them look more broad, it also showed just how much the fabric hugged the angel's body. Castiel tilts Dean's chin to make him meet his eyes. "We are not focusing on me right now, Dean, I want to focus on you. All. Of. You." He was kissing his lips now, gentle, but urging.
Dean looks down at his clothes. He's wearing a tight grey v-neck t-shirt, and very loose sweatpants, but, that's not the weirdest part. He's not wearing shoes, and he ain't wearing boxers. "What the hell is this?" He grumbles, starting to get grumpy and awkward because now he's just so
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean was currently watching Doctor Sexy on the tv hanging off the wall. Entranced by the way the doctor seemed to know exactly what he was doing whether it was surgically healing someone or screwing someone in the elevator.
Castiel had apparently coated himself in lube while Dean was in the midst of being a full bottom. "Don't worry, cutie, I'm giving you the full pizza man package." Castiel replies smoothly as he starts to move in and out of Dean.
He shakily tried to move his fingertips. Barely doing anything.
Dean swallows hard, eyes studying Castiel as if not believing he was actually there. Flashbacks of Castiel being taken go over his mind, but he focuses back on the moment. His lips part, trying to form words.
He looks at his hand for a moment, biting his lip to stop it from quivering. Watching his hand tremble slightly as it grips a piece of paper, seeing the dark red coating it and his hand. He carefully holds it against his heart. Dean looks up again, holding his breath.
"Go right ahead, baby" He murmurs against Dean's shoulder and pulls all the way out then pushes all the way back into him and that's when Dean was a goner.
Dean's eyebrows pull together, unsure. "What-" He starts, but was interrupted by Cas' lips gently pressing against his, the older male's hands going from holding Dean close, to keeping him still by holding his sides of his face.
him now  and he can't help but admit that it feels friggin awesome from this angle. His head falls back against Castiel's shoulder and he moans loudly, one of his hands going over Cas' hand that was on his waist.
They spend a few hours watching Doctor Sexy and playing Monopoly (which Castiel kicks his ass at, but it’s only because Dean let him win). They eat a lot of food and Castiel bakes him a pie while Dean eats the pie filling when he isn’t looking. The afternoon was finishing and the early evening was upon them quickly.
He heads home, feeling heavier than usual after leaving Dean alone in the hospital.
Dean smiles shyly, feeling Cas' mouth against his head. "Why are you in the hospital? For pneumonia?" He questions, nervous that it was insulting or rude.
Dean smiles at her optimism in the morning and eats quietly as she leaves.
"It seems like Sam is worried about you." The male says from his bed and Dean glances over.
Both burst into a fit of soft Laughter. Both the girls smile at them, but give them a soft reminder to take an easy because of their breathing conditions. They also hand them dinners. Which are microwave steak and French fries. They leave after putting the plates down.
His feet slap lightly against the cool wooden floors as he makes his way to the kitchen. Wooden planks turn into marble tile and he smiles as Dean moves around the kitchen. His movements are a bit awkward because every few moments his tank gets in the way or the oxygen tube gets tangled, but he looks adorable in the domestic scene.
Dean is allowed a sleepover away from the hospital for ONE night.
He barely notices he’s back in his house until he realizes he’s staring at the camcorder on the counter top. The last thing Dean gave him besides a kiss. He wanted him to have it back. Moving over to it, he touches the frame gently and wraps his hand around it, opening the screen.
Dean felt his sides be stroked gently and then he was being lightly lifted and moved to a new location. He realized quickly that this new location was bent over Castiel's very naked lap. "Ready, sweetheart?" Castiel says slowly as his hand brushes gently over Dean's ass.
“I can turn the tv on for you and then after that you should shower.” She chimes with a playful scrunched face to act like he stunk, then switches the screen on.
"About... us." He whispers, blushing darker, nervous.
"God wanted you to be a living embodiment of stars." He kisses Dean after those words and smiles as the male allows himself to sink into the kiss and stay close.
Castiel pulls away with a smile before sitting up, looking at his phone which he had pulled out of his pocket. "My Uber is here, I'll see you soon, okay?" He says as he runs a hand through Dean's hair and grins brighter as Dean purrs against the touch.
”Stop with the chick-flick moments.” He huffs with a grin, making Sam roll his eyes.
Castiel smiled and pressed his lips to Dean’s temple and stayed close. Running his hand through Dean’s and holding him. Dean accepted the touches and squeezed Cas’ hand that was wrapped around him gently.
And while Dean fell asleep extremely fast, Castiel barely blinked until he was sure Dean's breathing was stable enough to make it through the night.
”I’m going to teach you how to take care of her the way he taught me and then, we’re gonna take her on a drive, she hasn’t been out in awhile.” He says as runs his hand along her sleek body, not a rust spot in sight.
The room matched the mood they had been for a good amount of the day, fairy lights were stringed along the walls and the glow was soft against the pale cyan of the bedding and walls. It was nice and Dean instantly felt calmed and safer than he usually felt. Castiel squeezed his hand gently and Dean flickers his gaze up to him as Castiel brings him to the bed and lays him down. "Is this still okay, Dean?" He whispers.
Castiel let out a gentle laugh and gently kisses Dean again, just a peck, still holding him close.
Smut!
Before he could even start his car, the phone started ringing.
"Well, my immune system isn't as strong as the normal person's so when I got sick with it, because I was around a lot of fumes... It hit me a bit harder and it shut my body down, so I had to come to the hospital. It was a bit of a process because they didn't want to release me too early and have something else enter my system while I was already compromised." He explains, calm and happy.
Castiel pulls him closer, cleaning his hand with a napkin he had shoved in his jacket. "Let's go find heart rocks and stick our feet in the water." Castiel says and pulls him gently into his arms and leads him to the water, both of them giggling excitedly as they head to the open sea.
Castiel gives Dean a smile and raises an eyebrow in question. “Yes, Dean?” he asks with a tilted head and a curious gaze, the curious gaze that made Dean fall in love in the first place.
”Cas, I... I make you happy, right?” He says, keeping his voice light, keeping his eyes closed, head tilted back to press against the door of Baby.
Castiel doesn't stop until Dean's whining so much that his words are barely understandable, but he's still lucid. He rubs Dean's probably very sore ass, but smiles at the male who shudders until the gentle touch. "Did that feel good?" He whispers gently to Dean, who nods in response.
Dean hadn't lasted long and had released into Castiel's mouth with a groan and his hands tightened around the sheets. He was panting. Castiel moved back up his body and he looked at Dean as he sucked a mark right into his freckled shoulder, then into his collarbone, taking in the shaky moan he gave. He blew on the mark when it was dark enough. "I need you." Dean says softly, the few words he's said.
Dean sighs and nods, grabbing the page, thanking the doctor, and heading to the hospital.
It was on the 9th call and the 9th voice message when something changed.
-Dean does question Castiel's faith a bit in case that's a trigger for anyone
”Castiel?” The voice comes through, it’s shaky like how he feels and watery with tears.
"You wish, Novak!" He smiles and grabs his playing deck of cards.
“Why are your feet so dirty?” He asks shyly, as if Castiel might close up and tell him that it isn’t his business, but Dean knew they were passed hiding things now.
Commotion was present, he could make out footsteps and someone calling his name through the loud waves of rushing water in his ears. But he wasn’t underwater.
Castiel wastes little time to respond, his arms snaking around Dean’s waist, fingers circling around Dean’s belt loops  as he twists his arms as tight as he can get them around Dean and kisses back with the same amount of want and need.
Castiel whispers, watching the red flush travel from the tips to Dean's ears and down his neck; he watches Dean shake his head after a second.
Eileen takes Sam’s hand and Sam smiles down at her.
Dean feels Cas' hand leave his face and instead trace over Dean's shoulder where an annoying amount of freckles were placed. "I see these ones as all the times you placed others before yourself," Castiel presses his lips gently to where his thumb was to kiss over his shoulder, "All the times you cared for people, in general." He kisses across Dean's collarbone to his other shoulder. "How many times you saved people, throwing yourself in danger, even if it was reckless." He presses his lips slowly to Dean's skin, savoring the moment where Dean started to relax a bit from under him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean knew about Cas' childhood, how it had mostly been him and his older brother, Gabriel. He learned that Castiel was 27 wanted to be an English teacher, but had to pull out of school because of his pneumonia. He knew Castiel's favourite colour was yellow and he was obsessed with bees. Castiel had learned a fair amount of stuff about Dean as well, which was good. Dean did sometimes like opening up about his life. Especially since this was his life now.
Dean nods slowly in consent and Castiel moves Dean to face the mirror, on his hands and knees, watching as Dean's cheeks flame a red as Castiel moves behind him and pushes into him gently, leaning slightly over him. Castiel's chest to Dean's back. Castiel watches as Dean does a full body shudder when he's bottomed out, he was listening to the soft voice crack Dean had when he said Castiel's name. Castiel couldn't leave the needy Winchester unsatisfied or waiting for too long, so he starts to move out of him and back in. Dean's back arched more when he did it and he goes to bury his face into his arms and the blankets, which Castiel stops with a grip in his hair, tugging until Dean's eyes meet his through the mirror.
Billie looked a little bit more sympathetic now, nodding as she glances down at Dean’s soulless being now. “I will,” She days and holds out her hand.
." He says, Castiel's low grumbled voice soft and caring,
”He’s always proud of you, Sam,” Eileen says and Sam smiles, eyes still teary as he leans to give her a kiss.
Dean wasn't sure what to think, he wasn't thinking at all. He was becoming crazy, his mind hated him and he was dreaming. Or having a nightmare. One where Castiel is there and then he changes his mind and leaves Dean all alone,
He looks down at it, there was dried red tinted colours on it but he carefully opens it, ignoring the stains.
Castiel lays them both down and kissing along Dean's cheeks and nose where the freckle game is strong. "Dean Winchester, you are a body of stardust. All the freckles add to your natural beauty. Space is gorgeous, but it's even more amazing when the stars pull together to become the final touch." He murmurs softly, Dean almost doesn't hear it.
It felt surreal.
Sam shakes his head, a soft sniffle to try and maintain the composure he knew he didn't need in front of his brother. "I can't, Dean-" He starts to protest, his voice cracking.
Dean kissed back gently, feeling arms around his waist. His lips were so soft and warm, Dean couldn't help but lick gently at Cas' mouth and Castiel hums, pressing his body against Dean's and successfully pinning him to the car (which was a weird pimp car).
”Bitch.”
”He usually appears around lunch. Sometimes he brings McDonald’s burgers, hopefully this is one of those times.” He says with a hopeful sigh.
"And I'll be okay without you." He whispers weakly, giving another shaky smile, "It's okay, you can go." He says with a soft smile and soft eyes towards his brother.
Castiel was there, in all his angel glory. His trench-coat around him, his tie twisted in a way that usually irked Dean, but whenever he fixed it, it somehow got tangled again. Castiel was searching his gaze though, ocean blue boring into forest green and then Castiel's gaze dropped down to Dean's fingers which were still twitching to itch again. "Dean," The male rumbled, looking at him with concern, gently pulling Dean's hands away from each other and resting one of his hands in each of his own.
They were there when he fell in love for the last time because he fell in love permanently and Sam was there to hold him at Eileen’s funeral a healthy amount of time later.
It was quiet as they ate, but the peaceful silence was broken when Dean spoke up, mouth full of food, but voice coming through anyway. “I want to take you on a drive in Baby.” He says softly, gaze finally going to Castiel for the first time since they sat down for the delicious meal.
”Stop being so frantic, give me a damn hug.” Dean opens his arms after placing the camcorder to the side.
Castiel nods towards her as his own sign of hello and she waves, studying quiet as she leans against the wooden barrier, keeping them from going over into the waters below.
Like home. Like his future.
Billie touches his shoulder and soon they’re in front of the impala. Castiel isn’t sure what to feel when he sees it, it’s there. In front of him, but there’s no Dean and his gaze goes over to Billie, who wasn’t looking at him right now. She was looking past him and the impala.
Eileen and Sam taught him hunting when he was starting to get too curious for his own good, they properly trained him and made sure he knew the importance of working together instead of solo.
Blinking hard, Dean allows the words to settle in. “What does that mean?” He says, just to make sure he wasn’t getting anything wrong.
Dean stands up, wincing at the ache under his skin and gives a light wave towards the woman and then follows her through the long and narrow walkway. She motions him to head into a very sterile room. "Just sit down on the patient bed, the doctor will be right with you." She says with a small smile and then closes the door once Dean has moved to sit on the uncomfortable parchment papered bed.
It goes well, he doesn’t stutter or run out of breath before he finishes the sentence, hell, he even manages not to mention Cas. It’s still painful, but at least he had the time to rehearsal before Claire arrived.
(See the end of the chapter for
He needs a routine, though, a schedule, something to be able to drag himself out of bed at least half the times. While getting a real job still seems far too overwhelming, with timetables and paychecks, bosses and strict rules, he figures college might be exactly the solution he was looking for.
Dean tried to get back on his feet to bid farewell to that surreal stranger, but as he did that his head started spinning so violently that he felt his stomach tightening.
“What are you doing down there?” he instinctively asks, before he remembers they no longer use that tone with each other.
Sam nods, a small chuckle coming out of his mouth.
Cas shrugs, and Dean sees how different, how terribly human he looks, in a t-shirt slightly too big for him and disheveled hair.
Sam stared at him, regret in his eyes, then he walked inside the kitchen, as much as a the wire allowed him to.
“Isn’t he already walking among us?”
“It’s okay.” She answers, but to Dean it still sounds like something along the lines of
“You wanna go back to the Empty? I can kill you right away.” Dean swallows the sour taste of frustration.
“I promise.” Dean answered before she walked out the door, not entirely sure of what he was promising.
“I’m here to raise you from perdition.” There was no hardness in his voice as he said that, on the contrary, he seemed rather content, blissful.
