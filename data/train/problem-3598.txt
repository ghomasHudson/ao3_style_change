Her mentor audibly gulps. “Not blocking them out gets you killed. That’s how I got my father killed.”
And their maternal grandfather, Samuel Campbell, was the first
“You left quickly the other day,” Jack whispers. His eyes glow and the dog fall asleep. “If I ever said anything wrong—”
Jack shakes Bobby’s hand excitedly, not noticing him wince at the sudden movement. “Dad! It’s Castle! Is he your surprise?!”
“Is there something on my face?” Jesse asks.
just adds more confusion, and anger, and questions in Sam’s head. That Mark is like the equivalent of a Berserker-class’s Mad Enhancement, and it made Dean kill innocent people before.
“You can use the original?” Sam says, almost as excitedly as his brother. Almost. He catches a glimpse of an imprint in Dean’s right arm and it changes his mood entirely. It looks familiar.
He rubs his face several times and walks away. “Hold on to your questions, Cas. Plenty of time later,” Dean says, making his way to the dungeon.
The old lady clears her throat loud enough that it reverberates throughout the chapel. Jack was ready for her to reprimand them for their blatant display of homosexuality in a Catholic institution but she merely says “Times maybe different but that is still to be done in a room.” She then angrily walks out the front entrance. It was a sigh of relief.
The younger Master gulps down and drinks from the glass of water beside him. “You’re Sam Winchester right?” he asks back.
He was as shocked as Jesse was. For a moment Jesse didn’t think it was Castiel because he didn’t have any wings. But the man said his name, “Jesse Turner?”
“Hello, Lisa.”
Dean hopes he doesn’t enjoy this.
His eyes glow once more and he faces the victims. One by one, he does what Cherub asks of him, and all of the ambulance personnel give him smiles of approval.
“He’s training me so I wouldn’t,” Claire says, the certainty in her voice assuring. “Dean’s teaching me everything he knows so I won’t repeat his mistakes. He’s determined to take back the Hunter name.”
“Clive Dylan?!” Charlie hears the leather-clad woman say.
He thinks for a moment. “I guess we just missed each other by a minute or two,” answers Jack.
After brushing his teeth he makes his way to the kitchen. That’s where Eileen usually haunts after a hunt, preferring to be surrounded by all the food and drinks that she could want after a possibly stressful job.
When Angel looks up, a bright white light begins to envelop the cluster of buildings. When he tries to get up, he winces in pain and realizes his wing is broken.
Castiel’s eyes glow and then his wings materialize. He missed seeing these raven beauties at rest and not in action. But worry fills Dean seeing how Cas’s left wing sags down, restrained by a splint.
Styne to talk.
Kaia sees Claire avert her gaze when her father spoke and she puts a hand on her arm, squeezing tight.
“Okay,” Sam says, defeated.
Castiel puts a hand on Jack’s back and pushes him forward, “This is my Master. Jack Kline.”
“What do you want?” Claire shouts, knowing that it would sound as loud in her Master's head, as if they were talking in person. She drops down on to her apartments sofa and grunts loudly. “I'm at home.”
He remembers when it broke. It was during the week he last called this house his home. In his travels with Claire and Kaia, Jack knew now that home is where your family is. So where is his father? No one seems to be home. He expected that with the advanced door something would alert anyone inside if someone had let themself in.
The kid turns around. A young boy wearing thick rimmed glasses. He was sobbing furiously. “She’s here,” he pleads.
Dean took Castiel’s hand in his and squeezed tight. “Oh it isn’t finished yet,” he said.
with.
This new suit is so far-removed from his original uniform but it is still truthful to his original vision. And in this moment, seeing the proud look in his son’s eyes, Castiel feels most powerful.
Claire rolled her eyes before returning her attention to her phone screen.
“Your grandfather Isaac was never like this. I wonder what Avicebron might think of his lineage now.”
“I’ve been providing magical energy for that hunk of mud for over two decades now,” he says, and the Golem throws a small piece of clay at him.
Sam scowls, “I don’t know but she could be related. Many enhanced individuals have light-based abilities. A lot of them function the same. But one thing’s for sure. Us Men of Letters wouldn’t be the only group to know about this.”
“Well, they do for family,” Jesse looks at the blond with a tight-lip smile. “Patience is my cousin.”
“Don’t you love Riverdale?” Ben asked, shifting from how he laid down on the sofa to reach for the beer Dean let him have since he was staying the night.
“What?” Lisa smiled, ear to ear, amused and confused. “What’s Jack going to do?” she asked.
And then succeeding headlines just referred to him as
And then there was the last picture. Jody was holding a baby in her hands (who she assumed again was Alex). But there were several people beside her. To her right was a blonde who looked like a cop, and behind her were two old men who appear to be arguing. Behind Jody, towering over everyone, was a long-haired man with a huge smile on his face. And to Jody's left was her dad and Dean Winchester, both distracted by the baby in Sheriff Jody Mills' arms.
“Hello, Jesse,” Jack says, lowering himself on the ground and the dogs lick his face.
“Good morning, Angel,” she says, her white prosthetic eyes boring into him.
“Damn right it is!” Dean yells, slamming his hands on the table.
“Is there what?”
Charlie anxiously waits for the elevator doors to open.
“Excuse me, what?”
“I’m happy to hear that.”
Everyone else, except for Jack, scoffs at Gabriel. “Oh, please, I can smell hundreds of other women’s perfume on you,” Rowena dismisses.
?” the Hunter repeats himself.
Dean continues, not noticing the change in his brother, “This gives us an edge in this War. How many Servants can say that they have their original Noble Phantasms? Very few!” Dean turns to Eileen and explains “The originals are always more powerful than copies that Servants pull from their own legends. I can basically use Baby’s full power without calling her true name!”
“You can’t save everyone, Jack,” is the only thing Jesse can think of saying.
Kaia laughed. Loud and pointed. Claire threw a piece of meat at her, “That is not real laughter.”
Jesse knows this voice, he knows the smell of this man's hair, and the way his arms are rigid whenever he gave hugs. “I missed you too, babe,” he tells Jack, returning the hug with as much gusto. “How'd you find us here? Also, why are you here, babe?”
“She’s definitely still in the War but her Servant kinda went rogue. She’ll help, but if we help her find her Servant first.”
The boy takes a sip of the glass of water Jesse didn’t notice he was holding. “I can see that,” the boy states. “You were flickering in and out.”
Sam clears his throat before speaking up. “Well, Kaia, do you remember Jesse Turner?”
“Sammy,” Dean says, his smile never fading when he turns to his sorely-missed baby brother.
Charlie returns to her keyboard. Gabriel cackles standing up, and makes his way to the stairs. Castiel was caught off-guard. He was expecting Jack to ask about all the names they mentioned or Purgatory, not his relationship with Dean.
at Dean. “I like Jesse’s hair.”
Seeing the living room unchanged is one thing, he has to see the rest of the house to know for sure.
Jack, who immediately knew where this was headed, said “Who?” as he took a sip of his hot chocolate drink. He imagined the Ahsoka print on his mug that reached out was wielding the Force to make his family drop the just opened conversation.
Jack pulls away, a teary-eyed smile etching his face. “I missed you,” he manages to pull from his throat.
He hears a flap of wings above him and he looks up. It’s his fath—Angel.
Kidding aside here some personal notes.
“What was that about?” Her girlfriend asks.
And much like that piece of meat, a small laughter escaped Jack’s lips. “Dad, you’re not really setting a good example,” he said.
Kaia shrugs, “I mean how could I not? Our cells were right next to each other…” Kaia stops herself and stares at her artwork. “Oh!”
Charlie pulls the zipper to Castiel’s suit gently, making sure none of his feathers get snagged in between the teeth. Once she pulls the zipper taut, she hastily fastens the locking mechanism in place.
Jack nodded to that. He did want to learn how to move boulders with his mind. Or at the very least a #2 pencil.
“You can’t protect her if you're dead,” Renee countered. Claire can't argue with that logic. But it was Claire's purpose to protect Kaia, no matter what she was. The World itself wills it. “Alaya wouldn't have let me do it if it didn't know Kaia would be safe.”
“Who is that?” Jack squints at the footage.
There’s a clip of Valentine inside a prison cell. She tries to change shape several times but her body keeps reverting back into her black woman form whenever white light flashes.
Berserker slaps Rider’s hand on the table between the two of them. “Be polite,” he reprimands.
Jack dips a little at the height difference between him and his uncle. “Really?” he says excitedly.
“You.”
“Yes, Charlie,” Gabriel answers as he makes his way towards one of the chairs by the screen, “this is your boss’s Unico hijo.”
“What did you do that for?!” Aaron asks the Golem when he sees it holding on to two rifles like Rambo.
“I’m sorry,” he pouts. “I just needed to clear my head.”
Yet there are some codenames that are more complicated in origin. Jack thinks about the legendary Superhero who made his father’s current suit, Bobby Singer, who everyone calls
“Are we even allowed here?” Jack says, alarmed.
Ash pushes a button on a remote he’s holding and smoke comes out from the sides of the container. He makes whooshing sounds and looks at Bobby, he waggles his fingers and whispers, “Flourish.”
His father turns to him with a fond smile, “Jack!” Castiel says, putting a steady hand on his shoulder. “I have a surprise that you’ll definitely love. Remember my trip to Sioux Falls the other day?”
“I wasn't! I was visiting my comatose girlfriend in the hospital.”
She and Kaia share a look. “Yeah, isn’t that Patience’s thing? It isn’t really mindboggling once you get used to it,” says Kaia.
“You have got to show me what you can do!”
“They used to have sex,” Charlie clarifies.
He doesn’t know why but Jesse blushes and turns his head away from the boy. He slowly looks at his gracious host when he feels his blush calm down. “You’re awfully okay ‘bout it. Excited even.”
“Isn’t he a bright one?” the Golem whispers to Delphine. “A fool, I tell you.”
Jack looks at her and then back at the screen. “The
“I wanted to check in. Waited ‘til your dad’s out. Now I’m here,” Jesse answers in one breath.
“He was asleep as soon as he got here.”
Everyone turns to look at the young blond. Castiel is the first to speak up, “What is it, Jack?”
EMIYA Family - The Emiya family is the primary protagonist of many of the Fate series games and anime. Two of them have been contracted by the Counterforce to be Counter Guardians, and many have been used as vessels for Servant summonings.
There’s something endearing about this boy’s enthusiasm but Jesse can’t quite pin it down. So, he goes for, “Can you
“Cats?” Jack’s brows furrowed, “You just told me that not 30 minutes ago.”
He feels defeated even though he hasn’t fought anyone yet. Well, he blames himself for filling his own mind with delusions and flights of fancy.
The three stop and the two women stare at Sam whose face is aghast from seeing his supposedly dead brother.
The Kline family wasn’t a mage family (they think Jack’s magic comes from his father’s side). But they were considered as a political asset. His forefathers, and even his own mother, were able to help seat people into the presidency. Which led to the fossil in his hands be in the possession of the Klines.
“A little help, Clarence!” she shouts.
“In the library,” he hears Sam shout.
He and Jack laughed harder and with a flick of Jesse’s wrist the rainclouds part right above them and moonlight now pours down on them like the rain before.
She was following a lead on who–what might've taken her mother and stumbled on a local vampire mauling while she was passing through Sioux Falls. Claire initially thought there was one culprit and she dove in, dumb un-planning-self first, rusty machete second, in the partially unkempt bungalow. As it turns out, it was a small nest of five and she was new to hunting (only two salt-and-burns under her belt), only finding out about vampires from another hunter named Krissy. Luckily, Jody and Alex came crashing through the front door and began stabbing the vamps’ necks with syringes. Claire later found out they contained a dead man's blood.
are trying new things,” said Dean. His voice was loud enough to startle Claire, she almost dropped the jar.
“Quite the downgrade from Grand Archer don’t you think?” Sam says, cocking his head towards Rider and Jack chuckles.
Dean scoffed at her, “Maybe in some alternate universe.” In his mind he imagined himself as a monster hunter in that universe.
“You’re right, I better head to Bobby’s” he says standing up, wings at the ready.
(Anna Milton). The writing spells in all caps “YELLOW EYES, HUNTING YOU NEXT!” Dean said this was his mom’s work.
“Where is my father?” Jack inquires, looking towards the entrance to the kitchen.
6. I wrote some references here to other pop media. Some blatant and some written in the mosf subtle way I could.
Alaya - The collective unconscious representing humanity's desire for self-preservation.
Jesse shrugs. “Well, you’re blond, your eyes glow gold when you use your powers, and you are Angel’s son. You’re probably a prodigy,” he enumerates.
“Yes, and no?” she asks, putting her hands in her pocket, confused.
On his phone call with his father yesterday, he mentioned that the seemingly old-fashioned door was voice-activated and that his voice was registered in the system. He has no idea how his father managed to get a clear recording of his voice but he doesn’t question it. For a moment he stood there, with his left hand pressed against the door, brows collided, eyes squinting at the uneven paintjob.
century where the Three head families that hosts the ritual gifted an ecclesiastical province of the Catholic Church in Kansas a fragment of the Greater Grail as a political move.
A few seconds later, Dean comes in, carrying a small dry box on one shoulder and a black box on the opposite hand. Ash is behind him, pushing a dolly cart carrying a tall cabinet-looking container. And behind him is Bobby, carrying his tablet, squawking at how slow Ash is walking in front of him.
Jack smiled at her and turned to his brother.
“Hey, champ,” Claire waved. “Alright, come here!” She said when she saw the look on his face, expecting a hug. In her head she laughed at how past!Dean Ben’s reluctance to show affection in public is.
Frankenstein backs away and his crew engages in a melee against Angel and the Hunter.
Castiel looks at his son, proud of his way with words and sweetness. If only he could embrace Claire at this moment so he could thank her for raising her brother in his absence.
“I guess you’re right,” said Jack, staring at the carpet. And then it dawned on him. “Wait, what?”
alone, hardly needs the marketing.”
With the length of his legs, he can only sit upright, not even able to go lower or he’ll entirely dip, and neither can he push himself up into the air because he’s too heavy. The stones that used to be displaced as his kid-self kick his seat up, are now sandwich in between his feet and the weathered soil underneath.
“Great. Now I have to go to a church.”
The blond boy chuckles, “I don’t think so…?”
Two Servants in the Holy Grail War unexpectedly meet. A clash of Heroic Spirits inevitably happen and details of the previous Holy Grail War are revealed.
His uniform looks similar to Dean’s, except it was maroon and black, and his helmet was a crash helmet with an ablaze anchor spray-painted in white.
Ben nodded, lips pouting in agreement. But the nod and pout meant that what Jack said was indisputable. “True. But I’d prefer to use a weapon I can actually touch,” he said.
Dean laughs and he puts a hand around Cas’s shoulders. “What do you think of me and your best buddy here?” he asks, face smug.
And then Jack’s eyes widen into saucers when he sees the man by the front of the truck as he turns around. And he can’t help himself but run towards him.
This was a lot to take in and Claire isn’t even sure she was actually following. “So what? You guys never reacted like this when Kaia or Patience talked to Jack. And they were in Purgatory too!” she points out.
“You’re going to make me barf,” Meg derides them.
floor of the building. One least affected by the earlier blasts. He is horrified with what he sees. Dozens of dead bodies laying around him. None of them suffered burn marks or crushed by falling debris. They were bloodied and showed signs of torture.
When Mrs. Butters finishes passing around the food, they make small talk. Mostly Sam catches Dean up with what he’s been doing the past two decades. Dean congratulates them for getting married and he asks how different the world is when he was still alive.
“Yes?” he says, unsure of how to answer. A lot of filthy thoughts run through his mind at the mention of “Master” so one word is the safest response he could think of.
The last time he was in a room this lifeless was during the Purgatory Incident seven years ago. He was fifteen then, terrified and there were shadows whispering just outside his door. He looked around the room and aside from himself, there was nothing there, nothing to count other than the door and the four walls that towered over him. He closed his eyes and wished to be away, normally it would work, he’d done it countless times. An inconspicuous disc flashed white light above the door and went away. When he tried to leave the room again nothing happened save for his labored breathing and that white light. When he had started panicking, the door opened, and entered a tall man that spoke in a Texan accent. As a fan of heroes and villains he knew who this was; Frankenstein.
“Jesus! Gross” Claire said, making barfing noises after.
When the man turns around that’s when he speaks. “Hello!” Jack says, with an ear-to-ear smile and his right hand raised, stationary beside his head.
“Industrial building two corners East,” Gabriel directs their hero.
Despite being on a call, there was comfortable silence. But Jack felt he needed to speak, “I’d be happier if we had lunch tomorrow together at school.”
He wonders if his grandpap is still awake. He doesn’t exactly know Jesse’s back in this hemisphere. When he popped in, a flyer of a dog track flew right in his face, and instead of heading straight home, he liberated all the greyhounds that they housed. Now he’s surrounded by them, asleep, just two miles from home. Jesse wonders if his grandpap would like more dogs. About a dozen of them.
Once they sat down Jesse shivered as he felt a hand touch his hair, the events earlier still in his mind. “Please don’t do that,” he asked, his fingers closing in on themselves.
Maggie took a half-bitten chicken nugget and threw it square on Ben’s face.
“I need to head home now,” Castiel says, slowly getting up, the blanket falling onto his chair. “Meg, you too! The DA will be mad at both of us if news gets out and we’re not home.”
She pulls away and stands with Jack and Rowena. All of them marveling at Castiel in all his glory.
Castiel looks over his shoulder, “Hello, Gadreel.”
“Ease your heart rate bro,” he hears Gabriel say. “Kid, zapped back here. Charlie’s giving him the talk now.”
They see Cherub already returned to providing first aid. Judging from the scene, the explosion injured more people but luckily there were no additional casualties. Or so he thinks.
The woman laughs. As she’s brought down she says, “Well, it’s nice to see you too again, old friend.”
“Of course, Jack! It’s yours,” Castiel replies almost immediately.
The bully turned to look at the other boy with him and spoke loudly for everyone in the hallway to hear. “Did you hear that? He called Winchester handsome.”
He takes a massive bite.
Sometimes she misses those beginning days where the only thing Dean had her do was do a perfect split. When she questioned him if he could do it himself, he raised his leg all the way up to his head, with a shit-eating grin on his face, and told her to start stretching.
from Crowley?”
. It started out as a headline when he was just a newbie hero: “
“Rowena, it’s been so long—”
“Yeah, Gabe. Even I got more game than you,” Charlie adds. “And I don’t even date very often.”
Dean props himself up on one elbow. “What is this about, Sammy? It’s…” he looks at his phone, “it’s 7AM on a Saturday.”
Bobby looks at him all smug and knowing, “Two actually. Just the suits though. Any other supplementary equipment is out of the question.”
guess
This is what he’s been waiting for. After years of online pre-law classes and Claire teaching him whatever she’s learned from whoever’s training her, it’s finally happening. He’s making his debut.
dads.”
“Touché!”
“Excuse me?”
“Masters?” Jack says, obvious confusion masking his face. “Wasn’t Don Stark her Master?”
They dropped the woman they saved into a hospital earlier after burning the bodies of the dead Thules. Hopefully it takes them more than decade to come back this time. He should probably research a way to close the resurrection loop the Thule have been exploiting for centuries.
The angel shakes Jack’s hand, “Then I am your Servant in this Holy Grail War.” The light from his eyes and the short sword disappears. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Jack Kline. My name is Castiel. I am an Angel of the Lord.”
“So your plan was to use both Noble Phantasms together to eliminate the competition? So the two Servants left could battle it out in a fair fight,” Jack says, able to predict the outcome of the story even though it was never in the Clocktower records. “That’s smart, really.”
“Hey, Sammy. Were you the one who summoned me?” Dean says, his hands pointing to the Command Spells on Sam’s right hand, effectively pulling Sam away from the myriad thoughts running through his head.
“Castiel! Or should I say Berserker? I can’t believe that you’re a Servant,” the pastor says. “I guess no great deed goes unpunished. Just like Rider here,” he adds, pointing to Dean.
Aaron cautiously approaches the woman, his knife outstretched to prevent the other remaining Thule from coming closer. The woman scrambles towards him and Aaron pulls her close. “Still doesn’t answer my question.”
“Good enough for me.”
“You must be Jesse,” Castiel said. Smiled and he turned to reenter the house but stopped halfway, “Jack, dinner’s almost ready. Better head on in.”
His mouth pressed on the burger a little too hard. The oils from the patty oozes onto his right hand and slides all the way down to his elbow, “Fuck!”
“Solo! Definitely sold on riding the Millenium Falcon!” Ben said. After a few finger guns at the different decorations and furniture in the living room he turned to Jack. “And you could be Luke!”
Jack faced towards her direction, “Yes, Lisa?”
“I would love to, Jesse.”
will make me go weewee.”
“Why Golden Boy though?” Jack says, putting a finger on his chin.
Castiel lights up at the mention of her name. They have been so much together since Meg’s shift from villain to anti-hero. The masses would go crazy whenever Angel and
“Hello, Dean,” Cas’s canyon-deep voice, wash over him. And he falls again. He kisses Cas’s cheek, unsure of how to utter all of the praises he has for the—
“You’re kinda a dork like Luke.”
They hear Gabriel whistle at them, apparently done with all of the sandwiches in the almost-two minutes they were talking. “You two get over here. We have a job to do.”
As they make their way to the screen, Jack asks “What do you do
“That’s Cyrus Styne!” Gabriel shouts from the earpiece.
After all, not everyone on the list is a registered Enhanced. The UN made sure that registration is on a voluntary basis to prevent exploitation.
From the stove, Dean turned around holding a fresh pot of the oxtail stew he found online and decided to cook. “Hey, Jody!” he said, dropping the pot on the kitchen table.
Cherub looks up, and she immediately recognizes her nephew but pushes the thought away. “We need help with the rest of the victims there are far too many! And too few of us. They’re panicking. I know you can do what I do. Just accelerate healing for victims you come across and let the paramedics do the rest!”
A loud ringing sounds off in her head and Claire gets pulled away from her memories. “Where are you, Saber?” asks a velvety voice with hints of a Guayaquil accent. Her Master—Renee Mendez.
“Exactly the same age as you,” Sam huffs. “Anyway, I was pretty inexperienced. Luckily Rider and Berserker were there to help me in fights… back when they were alive. I didn’t know any of the other Masters and Grand Archer wasn’t really keen on any Kumbaya business. But the Masters of Grand Caster…”
Dean throws a bottle cap at his brother, “I swear you’re going to wake up bald one of these days.”
Dean returns his embrace, also missing his brother that he cared for in life.
The man—Dean laughed, “Exactly like superheroes, kid.” Later that day, Dean and his father would drop them off at their house and she promised both of them she would protect and care for her mother. They didn't ask her to, but she thought that that’s what Superheroes would do.
his look is complete.
“Look at you, baby wings, looking exactly like baby bro when he was in college,” Gabriel says as he ruffled Jack’s hair. “Except for the blond mop though.”
“THEY’RE ALL DEAD!” the mad alchemist screams. Then he pulls his gun to the side of his neck and Castiel and Henriksen make shouts of protest. When he pulls the trigger, the bullet goes through his neck, and some other thing gets pushed out and drops to the floor.
Claire takes a seat on the table. “I read about that. Even terrorist groups ordered a ceasefire then.”
“I don't think so,” says Jesse, sighing.
Henriksen and Nancy pulls up some chairs from the side of the room and sit. While Dean and Meg each pick something from the weapon’s rack closest to them.
Please don't forget to leave kudos if you liked this chapter! Feel free to leave comments if you liked it or if you have ideas on how it could go or if you just want to say something!
“I won’t tolerate that kind of language when Jack gets here,” declares Castiel. His brother is
He gives her a warm embrace, “I missed you.”
“She’s a fan girl,” Gabriel shouts as much as he could while chewing.
“And I never check out guys,” Kaia added, sipping on her glass of iced tea.
“So, we think it’s her?” asks Claire?
. A battle royale style competition ritual from the far East that grants the winning Servant-Master pair a wish from the Holy Grail. The ultimate stage where mages and other magical practitioners get to test the limits of their abilities. And Jack Kline will take part in it.
“Regret what?”
“For the record, I am one of the few Servants to actually qualify and not just conform to the Berserker class.”
When he manages to catch up to Angel, he flies faster and does odd twists and turns. The Superhero would close his wings and dip down and then glide right above the city line, and he would fly in between the buildings. He’d occasionally slow down and greet office workers with a wave and then speed away before they can even take a photo. And Jack sees what he was doing. He was testing his maneuverability in the air and sharp turns.
According to Lord El-Melloi II, North America’s leylines are weaker, more brittle, than those of South America and Asia. It was a fact that prevented American magic associations to recreate the ritual from the far East. But that was only until the late 19
Jesse looked at him, a soft gaze. Jack could see there was no judgment in the boy’s eyes and he smiled. “A year and a half later my dads signed adoption papers.”
In that momentary distraction, Angel did not notice Frankenstein pointing a gun to his head. The Hunter slices off the other villain’s arm before he gets to shoot. But the jerking action still manages to pull the gun’s trigger and shoot at the unconscious man’s thigh as it falls down.
“We talked about this! Grandma was okay with it and we never failed to tell you where we were.”
The Golem is busy cleaning up his side of the perimeter. There were quite a few Thule pretending to be loiterers around these parts and they both decided to split up to cover more ground and reduce enemy numbers faster.
“I swear both of you eat like you’ve never had a proper kitchen growing up,” Lisa said as she filled her plate.
As his brother continues babbling about the Impala as his Noble Phantasm, Sam stands up and makes his way to Dean’s side. His brother and his wife don’t seem to notice but Mrs. Butters whispers his name, sensing what’s in his mind.
“I'm still pissed at you, Renee. I agreed that you turn me into a Servant so I could protect Kaia! Pulling me out of there with a Command Spell is dangerously coming close to crossing the line,” Claire complained, voice cracking in frustration.
He counted forty-six steps (including the two flat landings) before they reach a large sublevel that he never knew existed.
—sitting by the kitchen table, waiting for his family to wake up.
Claire nods. Immediately her eyes jump away from the screen when she notices Dean and Sam stare at each other, faces etched with concern, and look back at them. “What is it?” she asks.
Clive Dylan was this gentle soul that she offered to stay with her when he no longer had a place to stay in or to go to. He was in his senior years and had just found himself homeless and alone when he and Charlie met. So, she offered him the guest bedroom. She never asked anything in return but in the month and a half they've known each other he has cared for her like a father would his daughter.
“Do you think it’s
Angel looks around and sees Demoness, straining under the weight of an entire building.
Sam just observes his brother stand up and inspect the first tome he sees and explain how it’s possible that the shoddy writing about their lives from a long-dead prophet could’ve gained him enough fanfare to catch the Counter Force’s attention. That and the fact that they’ve saved many people and stopped an Apocalypse or two, and, despite promises, people talk.
“Who’s gone on one date with who?”
“Relax,” the woman says. “I am Delphine Seydoux. Are you the Master that summoned me?” she asks Aaron.

“Thank you,” he says, looking down so Jesse doesn’t see his reddening cheeks.
the family business after all. He just doesn’t know if it’s still a family business if only he and his wife Eileen are the ones in it.
him in the body bag. But he left the hospital before he could talk to anyone,” he says, a little quiver to his voice.
He could get used to this. He wants to know more about Jack. But he needs Jack to know first.
Jack walks towards the man and embraces him. “I missed you, uncle Gabe.”
Jack didn’t waste time to reply and called him as soon as he read the text.
Dean and Lisa exchanged knowing glances. Dean nodded and she continued with her story. “I asked your dad “What now?” and he stared at the wall and said—”
He makes his way to the flight of stairs and pushes the metallic yellow door with a dark red “CW” label on it.
Cas just stares as she disappears from the hall. “Dean, why is Kaia here? She was supposed to be in Canada with Claire,” he says, brows furrowed.
But when he steels himself, making the turn to the kitchen, he sees his brother’s face red from hard laughter and pleasant company.
Dean looks at the black iridescent feather on one of the shelves and smiles to himself. “Yeah, well, we went through Purgatory together.”
“I will not repeat myself again. Are you the one who summoned me? My master?” he asks, his voice more commanding.
Jack got confused for a second, “I don’t think they ever explicitly say he was gay.”
Sam had ordered a salad and both the Servants ordered a burger. He still doesn’t understand Berserker’s insistence on eating but him consuming food would lessen the load of providing energy for the Servant. That’s until he realizes that he ordered a second one not for himself but for Rider, who picked up Berserker’s plate after quickly devouring his own.
“What do you plan to do in college,” Lisa, to Jack’s relief, asked earnestly.
“His boyfriend,” Ben said as he bit down on his filled up spoon.
“You’re Bobby Singer!” Jack practically screams, startling the man in question.
He extends his hand and his eyes glow bright blue. He bites on his lips and powers through the pain. He seldom does this but with Demoness holding everything in place, he’d allow himself. As his eyes become bluer and brighter, he emits a deafening high-pitched ringing. The debris disintegrate into dust and Demoness lets go.
“That was a good one,” said Ben, composing himself from laughter.
“But we're here already. It’s not like we can just go back to Indiana to your mom before leaving again for the Clock Tower.”
Sam drives a 1967 Chevrolet Impala. He got it from Dean when he died, and Dean got it from their dad before that. They grew up in it from childhood to adulthood until Sam up and went, tired of the family business. They begun hunting together in it when they were reunited, driving around, looking for their missing father. Heck, it was even in every cover of the Supernatural books. Dean loved that car like it was the most important thing in the world, second only to Sam and—
get,” she said.
He walks into the library and there was Cas, in his full glorious uniform, looking like a fresco masterpiece despite not having his wings out. He’s holding on to Dean’s most prized possession, Castiel’s feather, and looking at the framed articles below the preppers.
it read. It was an image of Dean beating Yellow Eyes’ dead body while it hangs by a noose on a half-tipped lamppost. The daylight casting on the dust and rubble gives the scene an undeniably macabre feel as onlookers watch Dean end a decades old rivalry.
Dean rolled his eyes and drank from the bottle of beer he was nursing since they got to the diner. “Don’t pressure the kid, angel.”
what she saw in her dream. She said I was in a fight with a villain,” Jack says, the energy spilling out of his words. But when he turns to look at Jesse, he sees the forlorn look on his friend’s face.
The Church then approached different groups—religious, ethnic, scientific, government, and the Mage Association—to help cultivate the fragment into a true receiver connected to the Root. In a span of a decade their Greater Grail was ready, and there has been three stateside Holy Grail Wars since.
“I’m sorry, son,” he says to Jack.
A grenade launches at the two and Angel immediately covers the Hunter with his wings. Frankenstein makes a break for it and runs away, unknowingly running towards the positioned cops.

Jack frowned and flipped his laptop so it was facing Dean in the doorway.

“Jesse is powerful. He can alter certain aspects of reality to an extent without even thinking—
Claire pointed to her phone as soon as she heard Jody’s voice, raising both eyebrows very much like Castiel.
“So, Meg,” Dean breaks the silence.
Ben sat up, “Hey, answer our questions first.”
“See, the suit? Remember Patience’s vision about Jack that I painted?” Kaia tells her.
He hears laughter, Eileen’s and Mrs. Butter’s.
“Didn’t feel like it.”
And with that, the ringing in Claire's thoughts fade out. She stares at the ceiling, contemplating her next course of action. She reaches up, and with a flick of her wrist a silver and brass, triple-edged longsword materializes in her grasp.
A massive explosion happens and the two Masters are thrown back by the terrible display of raw power. Jack uses the energy he has left to lift his head up and stare at the converging Noble Phantasms. If this is Rider’s power, just blowing off steam, able to go toe-to-toe with a near-Divine Spirit like Berserker, he prays that the other Servants aren’t this powerful. If these two are just from the Cavalry-classes, what power could the Knight-classes could even possibly possess.
“You have an older sister?”
Jack grunted and everyone else on the table laughed.
Jack hears his father almost growling, “Why is Dean here? Who said to stop monitoring him?”
One of the chairs turned around to reveal a redheaded girl wearing a purple jacket and a shirt with a print of… his dad’s face?
“Let me guess, we are in the Bunker? I recognize the acrid stench of pathetic Winchester failure,” Styne quips.
“That’s not what I meant. We didn’t kiss,” he protested. He stared at his plate, 4 different sauces smeared on a few pieces of chicken nuggets and fries. He needed to word his thoughts carefully so his dads didn’t misunderstood. That would only prompt Castiel’s overprotectiveness and Dean’s overeager teasing.
“Maybe keeping their distance,” Ben says, mostly to himself. “Jesus, these people are out for blood.”
Jack turned to look back at her. He saw his siblings staring at him as well. “What’s with all the questions?”
Dean grimaces, “Correction!” He props up his feet on the table. “Cas, stopped me from killing anyone today.”
Dean looked at Jack, “All I’m saying is that you got that from your father here.” Jack smiled at that, feeling validated. “If that could make me fall in love with my angel, maybe it could do the same for you.”
Jack looks around them and marvels at the soft stone at their feet, “Where are we?”
he has a
“Shut up!” Jesse barks. “Well…?”

Aaron hums in acknowledgement, “And the last one?”
“I don’t know,” Dean said calmly, knowing every moment of that night and being at peace with them.
Claire rolls her eyes, “You say that like you haven’t kissed him before.”
Jesse leans on the backrest of his armchair, “Sure, buddy.”
Then Jack spreads his wings and he disappears.
Jack is now standing in his living room, all furniture pushed to the walls. He stood at the center of concentric chalk rings riddled with Enochian symbols. At the edge of the rings are various numerous blue gemstones, all acting as magical circuit breakers. And in his hands, is an eons old fossilized feather (far older than when proto-feathers in animals even existed).
“Christ,” Ben breathes, “Stop doing that, Jesse.”
Valentine smiles and pulls the trigger, “No, I’m shooting you.”
“Just our luck, boys! Fetish Odbody and Psycho Ken Carter are out to put an end to our operation,” asserts Frankenstein. He puts a hand on one of his men as the psychopath in the helmet approaches them. “What do you say?” he says the smoothest his Texan drawl effortlessly allows him.
“So is Golden Boy!”
“What is it?” Jack asks, turning to the screen.
Sometimes Claire marvels at how Sam could read her as easily as he could read his brother. Kaia pulls on her hand holding her slice of pizza and takes a bite, also not taking her eyes off her cellphone.
He hasn't eaten since last night, too exhausted from their long drive from Indiana. They went straight to Pastor Jim right after entering the Stateline, bought supplies from a local hunter shop and the grocery store, and drove around the city before ultimately stopping at a motel near the city outskirts. He can hear his mom warning him about cholesterol levels at the back of his mind. But he deserves this after his busy yesterday.
“Sorry, boss.”
Castiel sighed. “I
“Is that my face you’re imagining?” he asks.
“But why Dean?” Castiel sighs. “Why a Supervillain?”
“Excuse me?” Angel tilts his head.
She makes her way to him and hugs him tight. At first, he was caught unawares but he lets himself sink into the embrace. It has been years since they had last seen each other. When she pulls away, Castiel can’t help but smile.
This will be the first time he’ll be doing a summoning ritual, and he doesn’t want to overload his magic circuits. So every part of the circle was planned and every bit of the incantation and fossil was analyzed and researched.
“We don't know what might happen to you if you merge!” Ben protested. They argued for a bit about individuality and consciousness melding and losing his soul in the process. But Jesse remembers Lord El-Melloi mentioning the Einzbern family's Third Magic.
Delphine holds out her right hand to Aaron and he takes it, holding it firm. “Are you willing to be my Master, Aaron?”
“Eckhart?” Aaron shouts in disbelief, removing his own mask, “What are you doing here?”
“Jack went on his first date the other day,” Castiel said with more enthusiasm than Jack would usually expect from him. “A cute boy from his school asked him out.”
“The Supernatural Books maybe?” Deans says, averting Sam’s gaze by pretending to look at the different books around them.
Angel returns to the scene as the Hunter slices the neck of one of the goons before jumping back, pulls the grenade launcher from his back, and aims for the vehicle. In that instant Angel rushes in and pushes the launcher to point upwards as the Hunter pulls on the trigger. With a backward thrust of his wings, the explosive is launched far higher than the adjacent buildings and detonates safely away from any property.
underneath the piercing glare he gave her. “Tell me she isn’t, Jody.”
“Who did this?” he asks, his face grim with killing intent.
Bobby notices him and signals to stop whatever test they are conducting. “Okay, cool it off and then pull it out,” Castiel hears Bobby instruct Ash as he approached them. He is wearing his favorite dirtied baseball cap that is older than Castiel’s children, and his trademarked vest underneath his laboratory coat.
At the moment he says that he makes the pitcher of water fill Jesse’s glass with more. Jesse gulps it down, and then, using his own powers he makes the glass float to the sink.
“I had fun too, Jesse.”
Angel to speak with him directly. “Oh, my wife works at my construction company’s office. It’s take-your-kid-to-work day.”
“See you at school,” said Jack as he let go of Jesse and went towards his front door.
but he’s still dumbfounded. A literal angel stands in front of him. He stands up and dusts himself and straightens his clothes.
She is on the edge of her seat, watching the season finale to her current TV obsession. Three of the superheroines are beating up an un-aging Nazi that pretended to be one of the good guys. But was a total bitch right from the get-go if she says so herself.
Sam stops by the library’s entrance, “Will follow up on a lead on a new case.”
The young Master heads down to the kitchen and sees Castiel sitting by the table drinking coffee. Which baffles him, Servants don’t normally need to consume food for sustenance. They have their Masters to provide magical energy for them.
. The accompanying image is a shot of Jack helping a paramedic apply a tourniquet to victims broken leg. “Read the article. Survivors of the incident claim that’s what you said.”
“What?” says Henriksen.
Charlie passes out.
“He’s here!” Charlie proclaims from the doorway, waving both hands at Jack making his signature hand wave at Rowena.
But if Jack was with them in Purgatory he would’ve remembered. He’d never forget that cute face.
“The entire West Coast won’t come to me and call me friend while you’re here, won’t they?” he laughs, trying to ease Jack’s thoughts.
“Nah, I think I do,” the officer replies and their face changes into a black woman with doe eyes and for a moment her eyes flash silver.
“Like Superheroes?!” Claire's eyes widened like saucers.
After Jesse returned Jack’s soft smile he turned to Ben. “So you live together?”
“Show me the damn wings, Cas.”
Castiel stands up and grabs the loaf of bread from the kitchen cabinet, a butter-knife from the drying rack, and cheese spread from the fridge, and places them in front of Jack. “I’ll tell you some other time. Eat. We must meet with the War supervisor,” he says, making his way to the door.
(See the end of the chapter for

I am the center, wherever I tread is the eye of the universe. Wherever I am is the world. Oh, Divine Spirit, fill this circle with a proper vessel, fill, fill, fill, and fill again. Until a contract with you a vessel makes.
Jack stares at him, searching for answers. They barely know each other but he can tell that Jack genuinely believes he has something to say sorry for. The boy’s brows were creased, his lips bitten between teeth, neck stiff with not knowing what’s going through Jesse’s head.
It is there he found out he had a magic core instead of circuits. Magic circuits allowed a person to convert life force into magical energy, which is how most mages differ from other magical practitioners. But his magic core, likely stemming from his demonic heritage, generates unfathomable amounts of magical energy.
There was no doubt in Jesse's mind.
Claire is walking around the library, scanning every object and book her eyes land on. On one of the shelves is an iridescent black feather encased in clear resin.
“Just a few toys and a suit,” Bobby wheezes. He turns to Castiel and taps his temple with one finger, “I’m a paranoid bastard, Cas. A plan on paper beats anyone dumb as a rock to rely on brute force.”
“No—I mean yes,” and then Jesse paused, took time to collect his thoughts. “Yes, I think Cats is a good movie. But “Those People” is a good film too.”

Before Claire could complain, Kaia’s phone buzzes. It’s a text from Sam saying that the

Sam’s presence beside Jack is suddenly sounding alarms. Jack jumps back and readies a spell to strike the other Master. But Sam raises his hands, alerting Jack he isn’t a threat. “Easy! No actual fighting yet. They just need to blow off steam,” Sam says and darts his eyes back to the Servants.
“Gabriel! Charlie!” shouts Castiel from his end.
After pulling off Claire’s last gauntlet, Kaia tries to excuse herself. Tries. “No! Sit down!” Castiel commands her. “You’re her partner and you’re accomplice to this.
The man pulls his hands up to cup Berserker’s face, “Hey, Angel.”

BUT there are some that chose their names during their debuts. Like the first Supervillain Nick Morningstar who told the police “Call me
An hour later Claire and Kaia are sitting side by side in the library, eating pizza Sam had ordered earlier. The giant man struggles to eat his slice, not taking his eyes off his laptop, reading a brand-new case file or the news or some article about green foods. She doesn’t know. Claire doesn’t really care what Sam does. What she does care about is what Dean is doing? He told them that they’re having guests.
“You could’ve texted them,” Kaia suggests.
Sam and Henriksen cringe from secondhand embarrassment. And even the other agents laugh at Dean’s futility.
“Proposal?” Jack asks, his squinting eyes demanding further elaboration.
They’re eating at a diner somewhere in Lebanon. The brothers told Jack that their home base is just a few blocks away from the establishment. At first he was worried to be riding a car with Rider and his Master but Berserker assured him they would be safe. So he sat in the back seat with his Servant, and kept quiet the whole drive to the diner.
As the smell from fresh bacons wafted into his room he decided to go downstairs, expecting Dean to already have a plate prepared for him.
“Alay—” Sam buckles. Sam has had it, “Dean, I held you when you were dying on that rebar and you told me you were at peace with it. You told me to go save the kid first and when I returned… You—you were still standing, pressed to that rotten column, dead but smiling.”
“So, we’re prepping family dinner!” Claire said as she walked in the kitchen, raising her arm so her phone’s front camera could cover everything around her.
“You didn’t tell him you do cocaine, did you?” Kaia said laughing. Jack was trying to convince his sister’s cool new girlfriend that he was punk when they first met and it backfired with one dad scolding him about lying and the other laughing himself breathless.

The Servant had teleported them to the location as soon as Jack finished eating his breakfast. The young Master knew that angels were capable of instantaneous translocation but knowing and experiencing it were two entirely different things.

“Unfortunately for me, whatever fundamental forces in the universe that saw Eileen resurrected, has closed that loophole in life,” she adds.
Castiel eyes glow blue and he manifest one of his wings to slap Gabriel. He makes it disappear right away. He inhales deeper than he has all week. “Rowena,” her name the only thing he could muster to say.
“And those bursts of energy happen at exactly every 0.31 seconds,” Charlie adds.
When Angel looks at the backstreet, Valentine and the Hunter are no longer there. “Angel to Garrison, I need eyes on the rogues.”
The young Winchester couldn’t help but agree. “True. But I’m glad you took your chance,” Jack confessed.
“Look at you wayward girls,” Dean says excitedly.
There are still bystanders and reporters even after Jack used his powers earlier. With his wing broken he wouldn’t be able to shield them all if ever that white light
It’s for this very reason that he hates mages. Witches and shamans he could tolerate, they adhere to codes that are human in nature; survival, worship, devotion, and desperation. Mages, like the Thule, seek power for the sake of power.
She picked up the painting to double check as Alex came into the living room.
Ben Braeden is in his car, parked somewhere near Rainbow Blvd, eating a way too greasy quarter-pounder. He's supposed to be on the look out for anything strange that's coming from or going to KU Hospital. His Servant is—somewhere out there scouting the surrounding area.
Sam pockets his phone and presses on the blinking dots to confirm, the radiation readings and location, popping up on a small space at the side of the table.
follow him but if his powers brought him here… then it’s worth the shot.
The doorbell rang and Jack jumped, giddy and brimming with excitement. Castiel took the remote and paused the TV as the kid ran to the front door.
“I don’t think liking the Cats movie is a deep dark secret,” Jack said, laughing at how absurd he thinks Jesse right now.
Jack and Ben laughed at the same time. “Nah,” Ben answered. “Mom knew Dean was hella gay for Cass. Was determined to raise me on her own.”
He cared for her but he didn't love her (romantically, at least). So, she never told him she was pregnant. She admits, it was a selfish decision back then. She would’ve given anything for Ben to have a complete family. But by the time she got the sense to tell him, it was too late. She told him he died in a hunting accident a year after he was born.

“You hear that, Gabriel?” the witch says. “That’s how you properly compliment a woman.”

“Are there other heroes on the scene?” Jack asks and it elicits a smile from Angel. And he can’t help but glow that he was right for asking.
“Oh, okay,” Jack says, and he returns to his work.

Servant. And newer Servants are generally weaker because their stories and legends haven’t taken root in the world or they haven’t gained much popularity yet. At least that kind of(?) explains the outfit.
“But that wasn’t exactly what happened,” says Sam, giving a weary look at the two Servants. Rider squeezes Berserker’s hand tight and offers him a soothing smile.
“Jack,” he hears his uncle call out to him.
“We had a thing back then,” Gabriel says, eyebrows wiggling in their suggestiveness.
The man smiled at her, “I'm Dean.”
“Well, let’s get home,” Gabriel says, putting an arm around Jack. “Your dad has something that could cheer you up.”
In the three years she’s been training, Dean has taught her in multiple fighting disciplines, weapons training (both melee and firearms), and some military strategy and war theory. Now, they’re training how to do those different fighting styles in tandem with each other.
When Castiel was new to the scene, he was lauded for being competent, but no one put much import to his work because he hadn’t done anything noteworthy. The occasional trapped-in-a-fire stories here and there, but nothing special. He was content at little-picture crusades
“Yes, good-looking,” said Jesse, a gummy smile presented on his face. “It’s a date. Good night, Jack”
“It’s a guilty pleasure,” Jack said. He didn’t even try to deny it.
“Well, I’ve already talked to another Master,” Sam says.
Claire just stares at him, readjusting her gloves.
And he was right. He entered the kitchen as Dean dropped scrambled eggs on one of the plates. His dad looked up and saw him beaming, “Hey, sport. You’re awfully cheerful this morning?”
“I haven't felt his thoughts since we made the contract,” the Living Servant admits.
Jack almost jumped when two arms flew right before him, reaching for whatever was hidden by his shock.
“If I felt it, my family would’ve felt it too,” says Castiel. “Maybe we can ask Rowena for help since magic was involved.”
Who is this Kaia Nieves and her Servant that has gotten the other Servant-Master pairs stumped?
Which was the headline of the next framed image from an international publication. “
lets the silver gleam of moonlight wash over him. He’s on a cliffside in Perth, overlooking the Indian Ocean shimmering in the cloudless navy sky. Along the coast, residential houses twinkled like lightning bugs.
Jack discovers his Superhero father, Castiel, has a secret romance with the Supervillain Dean Winchester.
Jesse’s voice snapped him out of his trance. He was staring at the boy on his laptop screen and apparently he had been silent this entire time. “Yes, Jesse?”
After an internal debate Ben did hug her. Him being a little shorter than Claire had his cheek pressed against her shoulder in their tight embrace. “I missed you, sis,” he said. And he angled himself to wave at Kaia who returned the greeting with a nod.
dying again. They tried to reason with him, he didn't have to make a wish if they won. “Hell! You can wish to never be summoned again,” is what Ben said. He then tells them that that's not how any of the Greater Grails work. Once the winning Servant makes contact with the Greater Grail they are given physical forms. And there’s no telling if they'll be removed from the Throne or not. Then Eliot stopped yammering for a moment. He looked at Jesse and asked him what he was exactly. Ben said it was rude but Jesse chastised him. It was, but an idea sprung up in his head.
She just now notices that the patient-Master was unconscious or comatose. She's alone in this fight. She's terrified, it wasn't uncommon for competitors to take out the Masters first. She can't die before she even had a fighting chance. She had a deal with Sam and Dean. She wanted to win. Her mom was in another room with Clive, she needs to win for both of them. She needs to succeed. She is crying.
“What you guys are doing is dangerous,” Sam says, tight-lipped.
He hears the sound of fluttering wings and turns to look behind him.
As the Nazi-Necromancers open fire at them, the Golem takes the brunt of the damage. But it was unharmed, being made of clay, and its body absorbing the impact as the bullets hit it. The Golem makes short work of them and turns to the five remaining members who continued whatever ritual they were doing despite the current encounter.
The Hunter was always the Anti-Hero, not being afraid to kill for justice. Most would just outright say Villain. But after going toe-to-toe with Yellow Eyes and winning, the world finally called the Hunter a

“I don’t know that one,” Jack said.
“Oh, yeah?” Claire smirked, “Bet you did that weird stationary hand wave you do when you meet up.”
When Jack first showed signs of natural magecraft, his grandparents were so supportive, they enrolled him in The Clock Tower. Now over a decade later, right after graduating and coming home, Command Spells appeared on his right hand. They looked like a tattoo of a sword between outstretched wings.
Jack rushes towards him, and without a word, hugs him. He reciprocates and kisses his son’s hair, “Hello, Jack.”
Bobby scoffs at him, “You sure you and Dean don’t meet every day? You’re starting to sound an awful lot like him.”
Dean gave the boy on the screen a quick salute, “You must be Jesse!”
Bobby pulls out a flask and drinks from it.

wakes up gasping for air. He’s laying on a stiff bed with his right hand cuffed to the railing. It’s dark, but from the soft light spilling through the window blinds, the steady hum and beeping to his side, and the cold that only miserable interior design brings, he knows he’s at a hospital.
Jack pouts. “That’s rude. If you don’t like Kaia’s art you should’ve told me instead,” he says, offended on behalf of his friend.
The man is shocked. He didn’t expect
Sunday evening. They were eating at a diner they frequented for small occasions.
Angel approaches the Hunter, invading his personal space. “Dammit,” he grinds behind his lips. “No names while on the field.”
“Dude, stop it,” she jokingly pretends to throw the apple at him. “I'm not asking for anything in return, Clive,” she assures him, placing a hand on his wrist.
The explosion does happen. Angel tries to extend his broken wing as much as he can and his power’s area of effect, but he struggles. There was no fire, or extreme heat. Just a deafening thunderclap and the concrete structures scatter and propel themselves.  But neither was there an impact. The debris, snared in stasis, float just above him. When a ray of sunlight hits a piece of rubble, a purple light around it gleams.
“The young man you managed to save earlier today…” Sam pauses.
The boy shakes, like he was pulled away from his thoughts. “Oh, no! I was just thinking about something,” he says. “Well, I was thinking two things actually.”
Charlie looks at an unimpressed Bobby. “What? Presentation…” she mumbles.
Delphine sits in front of the Golem and helps him finish with restoring his torso. “The Holy Grail Wars are ritual competitions aimed to recreate the first ever battle for
Bobby shakes his head, “This is a working prototype from a line I’m currently working on. Had it customized to what Dean thought you wanted.”
Superhero.
“So why did you leave?”
And then there was that woman earlier that manage to break his wing. He looks at Demoness who was clueless as to what was happening.
“Why don’t you go shower and get dressed, babe?” Kaia suggested.
. “I’ll be forever grateful, Bobby.”
“I’m pretty sure it isn’t.”
And on the dot, Ash presses a few buttons on the container and it opens to reveal a black suit that looks a lot like Dean’s but in mint condition. She sees the suit’s chest, and instead of a green downwards triangle, there are two lapis-colored fangs that converge just below the chest.
Angel then stops above a building somewhere in Springfield and hugs Jack.
Dean claps once and points at her, enthused, “That’s my girl! Be back in an hour, get yourselves settled. I cleaned up your room yesterday.”
“What’s that?”
Jack thought to himself. How would he explain things to Jesse? “It’s kinda complicated—”
Charlie stands up and takes the bag of produce from his housemate. “Clive, you know your blood pressure can't afford to go higher,” she scolds him, making her way to the kitchen.
“She was there,” Castiel says, turning his already tense body towards the screen. “This complicates things. Charlie, I want a list of detainees and their backgrounds, cross-referenced with other databases for possible relations to Dean or Valentine outside of the Purgatory Incident.”
“You sat there all day,” Claire reminds her.
“So all we have to do is eliminate the other Servant-Master pairs to win, right?”
Jesse surrenders. “Right!” he says. “What do you want your look to be? Let’s start from there!”
“As much as I love to watch you fudge-bangers flirt…” both Angel and the Hunter turn to look at Frankenstein, now holding the grenade launcher, “I really have to go before I vomit.”
Sam scoffs, “Jerk.”
“Well, I like the company,” when Jack looks up at him, he sees the confused look on his face. “I don’t have much friends. You are my friend, right?”
“I’m just happy,” he declared. He took his seat and immediately bit down on some bacon.
wasn’t there to protect them because Jack was being born at that very moment. And she could never blame her brother for something that had nothing to do with him. Then Kaia told her “
The old friends turn around when Bobby continues talking about whatever is under Ash’s blanket. “We had to repeat all tests when we did your cosmetic specifications.”
As if on cue his other hand took the now free plate, “Damn right, angel.” He turned to his giggling son.
When his uncle responds, Jack realizes that it’s like a phone call and he couldn’t stop himself from speaking, “Hi, dad!”
“I didn’t take Dean’s—my dad who is also one of his dads—last name,” said Ben in one go, still at his mini-food fight with Maggie.
Mrs. Butters hands Dean the glass. “Mrs. B, you know cholesterol is not a problem now that I’m a Servant, right?” says the Heroic Spirit.
Maybe if her dad and Dean retire early, they could finally spend the rest of their lives together. But first, she has to tell her father that she personally knows Dean. Does he even know that she
Sam stares at him unimpressed. “
They had the car parked in front of the school, Claire and Jack sat on the hood while Kaia remained in the front seat. She wanted to surprise Ben, never telling him that she got back this morning.

Dean’s been overprotective of Claire when he found out that she was Castiel’s daughter.
Jack is fully dressed in his costume—
“No, that’s not what I meant,” Jesse sighs. He thinks maybe showing is better than telling.
3. Hero work in this universe is a non-specialized active-duty occupation. That's why aspiring heroes need a license. More on this in Part 3.
Jack looks hesitant but he pulls one of the balls of light to him and stares at it. After a moment, “On my first patrol with my father, something bad happened. I’m not allowed to know the full details because I’m not a licensed hero yet,” he says. “It started out as a fire, I thought I was doing a good job following orders.
Berserker fully materializes his wings and flies high up into the sky, his trench coat flapping along with his wings as he rises high above everyone else. “I gave everything for you! And this is what you give to me?!”
And it is basically just
“So we’re counting now?” Rider shouts, the First Blade disappearing and his eyes return to their iridescent jade green. “How about all the times you’ve stupidly left me just to get yourself killed?”
“Do you regret it?” Ben breaks the silence.
Dean smiled widely and turned to his husband, “He
Clive leans back on his chair and he laughs, turning almost as red as the apple in Charlie's hand. He contains his laughter and looks at her with a fondness he never knew he'd ever have. “That's an amazing deal, Charlie.”
After the Purgatory Incident, Dean massacred most of the Stynes to quench his rage. Cas had appeared then, apparently tracking him. He almost broke one of his rules that night. He already had his gun to a little kid’s head but Cas asked him to stop.

teamed up and they always found it amusing.
He takes a look at his surrounding and sees a cabinet filled with things he couldn’t make out in the partial darkness, old furniture, and two frames on top of a fireplace that looks like it has never been used.
“Aha!” shouted Claire, her finger pointing directly at Jack. “Ben never said it was Jesse!”
Sam breathes, “The Purgatory Incident set off a daisy chain of Enhanced-related events the next three years. One of which are two very powerful unidentified Supers that duked it out in Iraq. Any military force that approached were either swallowed by darkness or obliterated by pure white light.”
. His back just bursts into flames and glows really bright!”
He puts on the mask and
“Wait, what?” Jesse says, probably as confused as Jack was when he answered the door for the two Karens.
Jack’s eyes glow gold for a moment and then his wings appear behind him, fully corporeal. There was a sense of relief in releasing his wings. Immediately he can feel that the energy his body was using to keep his wings basically non-existent, are now stored somewhere in him waiting for other more practical uses. He feels lighter despite the suit weighing about twenty-six pounds.
“Angel to Garrison. Are you seeing this?”
Dean sits up and just stays there, aghast. He does not have the right mental capacity to deal with (probably) government officials and cops, and frigging Frankenstein right now. And he doesn’t want to wear his helmet inside the Bunker.
He’d been targeting their entire family for months when he got a taste of Castiel’s blood in one encounter. Her uncle Gadreel was there to protect them. But he made the wrong decision to follow the villain when he tried to escape. Unfortunately for them, Gorgon’s pet (which was a massive intelligent snake), snuck into the house and pounced at them.
After nodding in agreement with him, Jesse returns his gaze on the image. The scene shows Jack lunging at someone on the floor with a hand extended upwards, their face hidden by the black smoke and swirls that envelop the rest of the illustration.
Bobby raises a brow at him, “There’s a back plate for the wings, shoulder pads, and a chest plate that comes with the suit. Balls, to hell with it! I’ll throw in some boots.”
“So how does this whole Master and Holy Grail War work?”
“I recognize that voice,” the woman says. “Hello, Torvald,” she smiles. Two black iron Nambu pistols materialize in her hands and she shoots at the three remaining Thule members faster than Aaron could register what was happening.
“Kinda,” Jesse repeats. “You’re not sure?”
“What’s up, back-alley!” Jesse was a cut off by one of the boys from one of the athletics teams. Jack wasn’t sure which one. The boy smacked the back of Jesse’s head as they passed them. His smile faltered and Jack felt his insides cave in.
“A Servant, Dean?!” Berserker shouts. “I wanted you to have a life!” The silver short sword drops down from his sleeves and he grips it tight, raising it forward. His eyes glow the same bluish white from when he was summoned. And behind him, light seems to bounce off invisible wings. “Not some quasi-existence! How many times have you been summoned as a Servant?!”
Jack stood up and began walking towards the stairs.
“Hell, yeah!”
It’s been around local, national, and international news sites since the first clear photo of his father in action circulated the internet. The media thinks it’s his father with outstretched wings but he knows it isn’t. It’s his father’s favorite trench coat, blown by the wind, with the silver short sword in the display cabinet upstairs nestled in the middle. He knows this because he drew it when he was nine years old. His father loved that dirty old coat. The short sword was just his kid fantasies of heroes and monsters taking over.
Sam Winchester-Leahy was a Master in the previous Holy Grail War, that's why he doesn't know why the Greater Grail has chosen him once again as a Master for the fourth iteration of this ritual competition. As memories of his late brother and loved ones flood him, will another chance at the wish-granting machine be worth it?
“So how do you think you know me?” Sam asks, laughing a bit at Rider and Berserker’s interactions. He missed seeing them like this.
family. I even blamed you for Jimmy and Amelia’s deaths. I also blamed you for what happened to Kevin. And part of my decision to be a hero was in part wanting to be better at it than you. Sometimes I wish I was the one born without powers, and not Jimmy.
Rowena, Gabriel, and Charlie all look at Castiel when Jack stared at them, waiting for an answer. Castiel relents and turns to his son, “Sam is Dean’s brother.”
“Jack, why are you still up—” Jesse hears a deep voice coming from behind him. When he turns around, he was in shock. He knows that face, it’s haunted him in his dreams ever since the Purgatory Incident. He dreaded sleeping because he’d face the scary man with the silver blade. The Superhero that helped liberate everyone in Purgatory: The Angel.
With this revelation, not only were Jack’s expectations not met last night, he even got assigned a
Delphine,” the Servant proclaims, stretching a hand forward and the chains wrap around all three people in the air. Before fully constricting his victims the young Clive looks up, distracted.
Angel wants to shout his name and call out to him. But he couldn’t.
“People stopped lying because I said so?” the boy says slowly.
“Hey, there’s nothing wrong with stories over dinner,” Castiel told his son.
your boy?” Rowena inquires. “It would be nice to put a face to the name.”
The bright light reaching its zenith catches Jack’s attention. He sees Cherub fly to a part of the perimeter and hover in the air, between the buildings, first responders, and civilians, spreading her wings. He looks at the people around him; they were all EMTs and victims. None of them will be able to run away in time. So, he follows suit, lets his ability to further enhance others reach out to Cherub, and then they all brace for impact.
“You could’ve told me! He might have heard some of my darkest secrets,” said Jesse, his voice getting softer with each other near the end.
“Alaya appeared before me after you left. I made a deal with the Counter Force; a place in the Throne of Heroes in exchange for preserving the Human Order,” Dean says, his voice shaking, trying to stop himself from speaking but due to the Command Spell the best he could do was break words, syncopated.
Jack just nods. He stares at the distance; his lashes reflect the soft glow from Jesse’s light constructs. “Well, until that day comes, we remain friends.”
Claire looked at Alex, who patiently waited for clarification. She pointed to the man in a trench coat, “There, beside Dean Winchester. That's my dad.”
—World—
Three? Charlie’s eyes dart around the room. The first thing she finds is the chicken scratches on the bearded man's right hand. Then she looks at the patient's hand; it's practically covered by the IV but a symbol peeks behind the bandages. Command Spells. She needs to make a decisive move.
Jack is unsure if he could do what Cherub asks. Angel has brought out most of the residents in all affected buildings in blinding speed. The FD hasn’t put out the fire in the first one that burned. And teams from the other cities have now arrive to quench the other ones affected but still, it looks like it isn’t enough.
Alistair. It was during the months he went undercover, trying to get close to Yellow Eyes. Dean had this rule that he’ll never hurt someone unable to fight. But when Alistair had a loose-mouth hanged on a rack, and Dean accepted a barber’s blade from him, he relished in the screams.
“He had trouble with school and zero friends. Of course, I never told him,” Claire says, a bit of regret in her voice. “Who knows what he’d do for attention?”
Dean audibly gulps down. He clears his throat, “You mean how am I a Servant?”
Castiel’s new uniform is nearly identical to Dean’s. Most of the differences are cosmetic, and to accommodate his wings Bobby converted it to a two-piece body suit. The majority of the suit is a sky-blue hue; except for the ribbing on the sides which is a deep navy color; and the insignia on his chest is a tan color that matched his favorite trench coat. His visor covers the top half of his face and tapers to a soft point just below his nose. And his combat boots have a black sheen that match his raven wings.
Kaia forces laughter to drive home the point.
“And you’re obviously into that telekinesis business.”
Dean sits down from across his brother, “You know I can’t do that. I’m your big brother.”
“Hey, Claire,” the man said. A little softer than what his voice sounded like earlier.
He appears above a massive sandstone formation amidst vast plains in every direction. There seems to be thick clouds above them.
“Don’t worry about us kid,” Rider says while marveling at the third burger just placed in front of him. “I took out a Servant even before being one. And he,” Rider points to Berserker, “Is a friggin’ Angel.”
“Good morning,” his son says.
The suit is a newer design courtesy of Bobby Singer. The new specifications were expensive and Castiel debated with the old drunk that he pays in full. But Bobby said that getting Dean to kill less people is payment enough. He recalls Dean telling him stories of how his dad would leave him and Sam in Bobby’s care when he was the Hunter. And justly so, Bobby made the current uniform that Dean wears nowadays.
It’s been a long time since Jesse used his powers in such a large scale, like what he’s about to do now. He stands up and his eyes go pitch dark. He raises both his arms in opposite directions, but both towards the thick rain clouds. And then jet-black tendrils of smoke jut out of him towards the clouds and the plains around Uluru. The clouds dissipate and the massive stone formation becomes dry as all incorporated water transform into glowing balls of light around him and Jack. Then his eyes return to their natural hazel state and the dark smoke from him disappears.
As if to save the day, Mrs. Butters comes in holding a tray of burgers (a veggie burger for Sam), fries, and a couple of bottles of beer (but Dean gets a glass of prune juice).
Sam laughs, “That too.”
Claire nudged Jack’s shoulder, “What did you guys do, huh?”
“A civilian maybe?” Castiel wonders. “Charlie.”
“But it doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt. Remember I was in a coma for a week after that,” he tries justifying his complaint.
Eileen raises a finger, catching everyone’s attention. She reads the newly produced paper from the typewriter, “Mick says their satellite readings indicate high amounts of CMB radiation in Uluru. An entire low-pressure area was dispersed in a matter of seconds. And a moment after the spike it rose again but nearly not as much.”
“Or B: you can go to the testing floor and meet Bobby in room CW,” she says, clapping his shoulder.
Jesse’s eyes widened and his mouth gaped. This is an opportunity he couldn’t miss. “We can watch it together,” Jesse said, his voice rising in excitement.
Dean swallows hard. “Jesse Turner is Patience’s cousin. He was there with Kaia, almost got killed by Cas. But your dad wasn’t in control then, don’t worry. He was kidnapped by Styne again recently. Me and Cas managed to save him, only we didn’t know it
Ben knows she didn't tell him everything. With all the protective sigils and silverware in their house, he knows his dad was a
She sits on one of the benches beside Kaia who was visibly uncomfortable. Her girlfriend assists her with taking off the gauntlet as she continues to argue with her father. “You sent me and Jack to grandma’s when a cat-burglar broke our coffee table,” Claire huffs. “I doubt I’d ever get any training from you. You were so hung up on what happened with Jimmy and mom that you sent me and Jack to grandmas after that!”
“This kid’s good,” Bobby says. “This is why I never had kids,” the retired hero says to his father.
Claire was in college taking up Mechanical Engineering so she was only ever home during the holidays. So when he heard that she was going to take the semester off and stay home for a while he was ecstatic. Even with all the teasing and big sister hovering to come. Everyone they knew said that they were mixed and matched from their dads’ parts, albeit built differently from one another.
Dean knew Meg before he knew Cas. She was Yellow Eyes’ daughter. But he didn’t have beef with her. And they didn’t have much in common either so he just left her alone. Well, except for one thing: they both learned the art of torture from the
“You take that crummy apology and shove it up your ass,” Pamela continues, smirking. “Quit blaming yourself for what happened in Purgatory, Cas. Rowena and your brother were right! You have nothing to be sorry for.”
“Jack? Is that you? When did you arrive? I just left Pontiac fifteen minutes ago.”
. It was a perfect contrast to Dean’s black Impalla called
“Why did you leave when my father recognized you?” Jack questions, doe eyes wide and searching.
He then closes his eyes and thinks hard, he needs to go home. How long did Frankenstein have him this time?
