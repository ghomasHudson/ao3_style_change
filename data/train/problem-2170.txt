They investigated each of them. Finding more figures. Pebbles mortared together into spiraling shapes that looked not unlike DNA. Hundreds of thousands of them. One or two words in a script that niggled at his memory were written on them. He could read them, but they didn't mean anything to him. Veema. Pavan. Just words.
That weekend, when her mom came to visit, she was very upset about something. When Eva asked if this was about her dad, she snapped at Eva. Told her afterwards, "I'm sorry for shouting sweetie. Nothing to do with your father. I did get word that your father's ship was lost, but that Doctor Watson saved him. Everyone's talking about it."
John couldn't help but look at Sherlock's body standing still and silent next to him. "Where are you?"
Which made her next choice all the more difficult, but really she couldn't see another way through the situation.
She was feeling much calmer and sweatier when Lucy asked her to come to the Botany lab.
Tripping his temper.
Billy lowered his voice. "You should all take the shuttle and go as far away from here as you can. We could..." he looked nervously around the hallway, "We could go with you." Billy said even more quietly. "They've turned on us before."
The Breen warbled at each other from the ground and didn't fire as they took off running out of the lift. Three corridors later and John still didn't quite know where they were. Billy tossed John the disruptor. "Will this disrupt the tracker?"
This seemed to capture Lurin's attention. "I will need a stake to start over."
Hudson might have done more research. While John was keeping his word about searching for information about their common genetics. About the trait that could turn Connor's teen years into a spiraling horror. Billy could remember Anthea pleading with him to be careful. All the times, Billy had run away from his latest safe place. Miscarriages on a filthy bed with only Anthea to help him. Then Connor that last time.
What did occur was a communique from Starfleet. All Augment personnel were to report to the nearest Starbase for questioning, while the Bakerstreet was to continue tediously charting the Teveda Nebula.
He could have a vial full of death or a vial full of cure.
"Oh, did you follow the plot line about the immigrant lovers," Lucy clutched her own souvenir, a wide gold cup. "They were exiled from China, after crossing the pirate queen Chin Singh of the Bloody Hands, and needed our help finding the kissing cups of the pirate queen, who allowed nothing to get in the way of marrying her lover. Not even… John are you listening?"
Giggled further as Sarabeth straddled her, and whispered, "Save some for me."
John sighed. "I think so. But it's not going to be fun." He set it to a low setting and tried on his own arm first. The glowing numbers faded. He also couldn't feel his right arm. Fortunately, he was left handed. He did the same to Billy and Connor.
"Yeah, I can see where that was their primary problem," said John. "Since I'm now on permanent leave, I should get back to that."
Sherlock looked at his own cum decorating John's chest. He slowly, languorously, licked John clean. Before rolling them over to spoon beneath the covers.
"Don't worry," said Lucy. "Captain Holmes and Doctor Watson will think of something. Don't worry." She hoped very fiercely and put a smile on her face to keep everyone calm.
One of the Breen tapped a control on their ridiculous helmet. "Where are Billy and Connor?"
He was brought down by laser blast from a spear tip that separated his leg from the rest of him. Cauterized the wound. Donovan flinched. She should have figured that a universe where the Khans took over some part of the Federation would be fucked, but she'd been distracted by the stupid sash into thinking it was all a bit of an adventure. Not a mistake she'd make again.
"Then don't you think it's time you did?"
"Which brings me back to that first best option."
"You're not listening," said Eva. She burst into tears. "It's the good part."
Trelane sniffled. "John, how do I know if someone is my one and only? The one I'm meant to be with forever and ever?"
John ended up with a permanent black mark on his record for punching a superior officer and breaking out of and into a secure facility. They weren't too happy about his lengthy discussion of his sexual activities at the academy, which earned him a black mark for conduct unbecoming an officer. Worth it.
Chin could almost have resented Sherlock for escaping and defeating the Borg.
John put his hand over his belly, already noticeably firm and slightly round with their growing litter. John bared his teeth, but stayed away from the pit. That was good. Omegas could lose their young if they were exposed to the scent of an adult alpha who had not bred with them. The juvenile and the sick alpha were fine, their scents wouldn't affect John, but this was a healthy mature adult. There was nothing weak in her pheromones at all.
For the honeymoon, Violet caught a transport to her new ship. A Constitution class ship under the command of a captain from Alpha Centauri's planetary defense. She smiled a little sadly to think that Vi would have loved seeing such a grand old ship.
"Please, you abandoned Mycroft without a thought." Sherlock repressed his own understanding that he hadn’t given a thought when he’d carried John through the portal. He remembered that much.
Which meant he hadn't killed Victor a moment too soon. He knew that was the moment Sherlock's brain caught up to what he must be sensing, because his eyes widened. Especially now that there wasn't the scent of any number of dead bodies to interfere.
"Yes, I can help with that." Chin snapped her fingers and pointed at the next room. Her strike squad, their expressions hidden by their armor, certainly unable due to her position to remonstrate her for her egregious breach in protocol for removing her helmet, followed the reluctant Connor into the next chamber.
"Yes." Sherlock shifted his hands around John's. "And I love you." He rested his forehead against John's.
Connor had to start somewhere, so he sat down and ate a spoonful of Andorian fish stew. "What do you like to do for fun?"
At least Connor had been safe. Not hiding in a war zone. No one had been hurt. At least there was that.
Voices telling Sherlock to leave.
The largest Klingon pounded his chest. "Weak Human slave. Try to break free so I can pick my teeth with your bones." The Klingons were bored, which was good. That meant they were sloppy.
"Exactly," said Prince Sparkles. "Precisely. You must deal with them swiftly and decisively. Show them who is in charge."
He was only twenty-six.
He'd learned the words to the song that the other alignments sang the year he'd learned what Mummy knew.
She was thinking that she might have to grow up again.
It was going to be amazing.
Sherlock perked up.
"That's what I said," said John. "Sort of."
It didn't help them.

Yao was correct. The burden of proof was being put upon them to prove that something had not occurred. Difficult, if not impossible under the circumstances.
Finney looked him up and down. "Twig like you?"
Still, after a further month of running around mountain terrain avoiding murder clans, John should have been in terrible condition. Washington had spent the entire time training the Yang in military strategy and sleeping in a bed, but looked like he’d been dragged backwards through a hedge. The training was maybe a violation of the Prime Directive, but John was under the impression that was more honored in the breach. John, who as long as he had to sleep with Sherlock for warmth each night, had taken advantage of the opportunity to shag him every night, felt and knew he looked fantastic. His skin was clear and glowing. His hair was rose water spa soft.
“And what did you do?”  Mycroft prompts.
Despite all the cameras and checks he died in his cell without anyone noticing for over half an hour.
that not even I understand.  The
We get great joy at watching Rosie gallop across the fields, and sometimes on the warm days, I even trot down the lanes with her on the old city carriage horse that we adopted to keep her thoroughbred company.
Someone grabs my wrist.  I try to fight.  I see them inject more drugs.  I fight that too.  I’m not allowed to sleep.  I know that much.  I force my eyes open.  Bad
He runs his finger along one of the long marks on my lower back.  “How did this one happen?”
I nod again, smiling.  I need him to lead, to take the initiative, I can’t do it.  I am too locked up in my fear of my past and apprehension about the moment to do much more than be guided through this.
He nods and I run my fingertips over his skin.  The textures change from soft and warm to smooth and tight, almost like plastic.  Ripples of hard-fought healing beneath the skin.  I trace a line from the exit wound across the top of his shoulder in search of the entry wound.  The depression that I am looking for is lower than I expect.  It must have gone through his scapular.  He lets me explore without complaint.
“That’s very hypocritical.”  He snaps.
There is another long period of silence.
“Seriously?”  It is half question and half exclamation.
“It doesn’t matter who started it; I heard what you said, and it was uncalled for.  Stay out of other people’s relationships.”
Our life is simple and comfortable there.  The fresh air agrees with my failing lungs in a way that the London smog could not.
He opens his eyes.  Rolls them a bit, but despite his best efforts not to, he smiles at me.
A bonus microchapter for you.
“He used staples to attach the electrical cables to my skin.”
“You’re not...put off by this.”  I don’t even know what this is.
“I don’t care about you bloody Hannibal moths.  Look at the state of you.”  John says with exasperation.
He mumbles something that sounds like a bit like piss off.
“Yes, of course.”  He agrees, breaking free and striding out of the room.  “I never stopped.”
Sherlock looks confused for a moment.  Then realisation strikes.  His eyes go wide.
I toss one of his dressing gowns at him.  The one he left on the kitchen table.  It hits him in the chest; he never even bothers to catch it.  He just heads for the stairs.  His bare back and arse and those long, long legs drawing my eye.  I sigh, not with exasperation this time, but with defeat.
“I couldn’t tell them who I was.  That would have put you in danger.  And Greg and Mrs Hudson.  Molly too if they figured that part out.
“You’re lucky she missed your eye.”  I tell Sherlock, referring to where Constable Jane Boden’s engagement ring has gouged out a deep furrow just above his eyebrow.
“You could have called me, you know?”  He exasperates me to no end.
“It was unpleasant.”  I downplay.
“You’re seeing someone?”
I am too apprehensive to ask and not presumptuous enough to just get into his bed.  Boundaries: he is fond of such things.
Big love to you all xx
Harry had always seemed to know she was gay.  From the age of fifteen she was out and open about her sexuality.  It never once seemed to bother her, even when she was teased or ridiculed, even when she got thrown out of bars for being there with another woman, even when she got bashed at a club by an irate guy she turned down with a snappy retort.  She just knew.  I thought I did too.  Now, I’m not so sure.  I wish it was as easy for me now as she made it seem back then.
“Now?”  Asks Greg’s weary and exasperated voice, the phone must have woken him up.  “I expect this from Sherlock, but really John, it’s half four?”
He watches me so carefully, waiting for me to break down.  His scrutiny is almost too much.  I pull him down by his open shirt and he bends to kiss me.  Our cocks brush against one another for the first time.  Soft skin over hard heat.  I roll my hips.  The movement involuntary.  “I’m alright.”
At least that is something to do.  It is better than trying to sleep.  As was expected, it shows nothing suspicious, nor any change from the previous scan.
“John, you can take it from here, I trust?”  Mycroft says.  “I have a diplomatic situation to take care of.”
“The nurses were too busy flirting with you.”  I joke, trying to deflect, I don’t want him to know that I told them not to.
I laugh a little at her blunt statement and oversimplification.  True to her nature; saying it exactly how it is.  But when I say, “yeah.”  I sound as deflated as I feel.  She makes it sound so simple.  It can’t be that easy, can it?
I never requested it.  I had asked them to throw everything that could not be donated into the rubbish.  I thought that they couldn’t bare to throw it away, but now I wonder if perhaps he wanted me to have it.  One last dig at me from beyond the grave.
John is drinking another beer when I come through the kitchen.
“Seven to ten days.” John drops the bag on the coffee table and turns to give me a stern look.
My head hurts too much to read, I can’t focus on the words.  I can’t string together enough thoughts to work the cold case I have been tinkering with.  I don’t think there is enough to go on anyway.  It is one of those cases that is probably destined to go into the old chest that holds all my failures locked up together.
“Sherlock,” I call out, “you know what will happen if you get pneumonia again.  Don’t make me go through that.  Don’t make Rosie go through that.  Not again.”
“Yeah.”
I lay there staring at the roof, contemplating whether the kiss means there has been a change in gears in our relationship, when John climbs into his side of the bed.  He rolls towards me and slowly places his hand on my chest.  He is careful when he touches me, and I appreciate it.  I think we are both scared.  Scared of what it means, of how it could go wrong, of how I might react.  I wonder if he can feel my heart rate quicken.
“Oh, like the detective.”  The younger one says.
“No, no, I won’t, I can’t let anything like that ever happen again.”  Especially after what he has told me about Serbia.  “I don’t even want to shout again.  I want to do better.  I feel awful about it.  That’s why I’m here.”
I didn’t see what had led up to the incident, but I did see it happen.  I had left to use the loo and I came back into the main office area at the yard to hear Sherlock destroying Jane with his familiar deductive tone.
“You want to tell me about it.”  John asks softly squeezing my hand.  I try to regulate my breathing as I consider whether telling him will help or hurt.
I recognise the irresistible draw of narcotic
I don’t open my eyes when he runs the water back to temperature, I concentrate on breathing slowly.  John uses the mug to carefully rinse out the soap.
John takes his time rubbing the shampoo in leaning over me and picking through my hair.  I was right, there is still plenty of evidence of being at close range to someone who suffered a close-range ballistic trauma to the head.  I try not to think about it and to lose myself in the sensation of his finger on my scalp.  It feels quite intimate with John standing so close by my side.  I let my eyes close and I sink down in the chair further so that the edge of the bench supports my head.  I am almost relaxed by the time he has worked his way through most of my hair.
“Bloody hell.”  John says as he comes at me with the blanket snatches off the back of the couch.  “Your teeth are chattering.”
“Earth to Sherlock.”  He says loudly.  He is carrying a duffle bag.  My duffle bag.
“What happened?”  I ask him when I am done drinking.
“With a stapler, obviously.”
Out in the street again I am glad for fresh air.  I dial the number on the card and arrange to meet Linda, the gruff sounding head cleaner, at Baker Street in half an hour.
By the end of the next week the surgery has a healthy offer made on it.  By Christmas it is all settled, and I am free to spend my days as I please with Rosie and Sherlock.
“How did you know you were gay?” I ask in a rush.  It must sound blunt.  I wince at my own insensitivity.  Calling out of the blue to ask something so personal is a dick act, but I have no one else to ask.
takes
“Ok, that’s good, tell me the specific things that get to you then?”
I turn his hand over slowly and gently.  I’m aware that his shoulder must still be sore.  I see the marks on his arm.  Six or eight of them, where he has dug under the skin, trying to get a useful vein.  His hand is cold.  The tubing has been on for too long.
my eyes open.  Talking.  Can’t focus
My hand shoots out to grab his wrist.  The movement is without any forethought or planning.  I’m just reacting now.  I have him pushed up against the fridge, his arm jammed up behind his back before I know what I am doing.  Water drips from my hair and runs down my face.  I am choking, then coughing.  My shoulder protests, my head feels like it is in a vice.
“Thank God for that.”  Greg says, still sounding concerned.  “Will he be alright?
pull away.  They are strong.  Restraining hands holds me.
“Nasty head injury.”
Maybe I need to know that it is real, unlike the spacey quality of the dreams and flashbacks.  Maybe I need to know he is real and that, and unlike my dreams, he was beatable, and that he really is gone from this world.  Maybe I need to remember that his life was hard.  Maybe I’m just a masochist.
“It’s beautiful there.”  I say, remembering the brief visit there from our honeymoon.  Mary had loved it there.
“All right, all right, give me a second.”
“I’ll brink you up some tea.”  She offers.
“Sherlock, you alright mate?”  John asked.  Sherlock drew his knees up, held his arms around himself tighter, but he didn’t answer.  John brushed the hair back off his face.  Hoping to read something on his face.  “Did something happen?”
“Finally!”  I smile, ducking as he swings a leg awkwardly over my head.
“Enhanced interrogation techniques were used,” I begin, if I talk about it clinically maybe I can explain, “Water, especially on my face triggers a stress response.  The position I was in and the addition of the towel were too…familiar.”
The elephant in the room, the little divot and the long incision from the right anterolateral thoracotomy that saved my life after Mary shot me, and then saved me again a week later when they opened my chest again to stop the bleeding.
The dream is still too closed tight around me.
It is so natural in that moment to lean in and kiss him.  The kiss is soft and warm and slow.  For a moment everything is all right.  I want this to last.
He meant it.  He wished that Sherlock would believe him.  He suspected that was too much to ask after everything they’d been through; everything he’d put Sherlock through.
I lay down in the soft blue glow that fills my room.  I watch the jellyfish as they drift around their tank in the soft luminescence that keeps me from losing my mind.  I do my best to look like I am asleep
(See the end of the chapter for
I am still rooted in place with my back turned to him.  The shock of what I had just heard paralyses me.  I knew something serious had happened to him.  Mycroft had indicated that at the hospital, Sherlock had said as much when I had spilt the water on him, but I had no idea that he was… abused to that extent.  I still fear that moving will break the spell.  He never talks like this.  He is never this candid about anything outside of a case or an experiment.  In the silence of the room I summon up the courage to turn towards him.  I need to be closer to him, I need to offer him some comfort.  I am glad for the darkness of the room that hides the tears that are streaking down my face.
I go to the other side of the bed.  The sheets are cool, and it feels foreign to lay on this side of my own bed.  I don’t know how to feel about this.  Does it mean anything, is it weird, should it feel strange to share a bed with my best friend?
“Caught in the act.”  He chuckles softly, before becoming fully animated.  Practically bouncing as he tells me about the stupid moths.  “They came.  There were five of them at the hive by the creek.  The one sheltered under the big tree.  Perfect specimens.  Large and bright.  Two males and three females from what I could tell.  I could hear them squeak.”
I hate this god damned brain for all the crazy shit it can cook up.  I can’t stay in bed any longer.  The new sheets are scratchy, and the mattress doesn’t feel right yet, it all serves as a reminder of what happened here.  Of how close I came to being killed or worse yet, raped again.  I had told myself, repeatedly; that what happened in Serbia was an isolated event, that nothing like that would ever happen again, could ever happen again.  I hinged everything on that notion and now that it came so close to happening again, I am doubting everything I thought I knew.  And that scares  the hell out of me.
I try not to thrust into his touch.  My legs shaking with the effort.  My fingers gripping his flesh.  The twist of his slick wet hand wrings a spasm from me.  It has only taken moments but, I’m so close to the edge.  I want this to last.
“Ahh, well, you were closer, John.  You win.”
He still gave no answer, just turned his face into the mattress.  John could tell he was embarrassed about something.  As embarrassed as Sherlock gets.
“How are you feeling?”  I ask as I plonk down heavily in the chair beside him.
“You wouldn’t be asking otherwise.:
“Thank you.”
they say.  I ignore them, hoping they will go away.  Hurts so much.  I hope I can resist them.
“I know, but you love it.”  He chuckles.  “Get in here.”
“How can I make it better?”
I know that the days are dragging because I am worried about Sherlock.  This has been hard on him.  The concussion has caused him to be in a state of unnatural confusion and that confusion seems to have plagued him with anxiety.  I’ve seen him agitated in the past but never for so long.  It was usually a fleeting emotion, not a consistent state.
The letter is written in large shaky handwriting and poor English.  It reads:
The water is cool when I clamber awkwardly out, waking him up as I fumble to my feet.  The bathroom mat is soaked and there are puddles and bubbles.  I help him out of the tub, careful that neither of us slip.  I get more towels from the beneath the sink and wrap them around him.  He grunts as I push him towards the bedroom.
John pulls back the plain grey covers and when I stand staring at him.  He tells me to “get in.”
“Lestrade cancelled on me.  He got called out on a double homicide and wouldn’t let me go along.”  Sherlock announced loudly as he barges through the door.  “Anyone would think…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No.  Can’t…”  Sherlock cut him off, before he paused.  John could tell he was still disturbed by what his brain had conjured up.  Sherlock changed the subject suddenly, talking in a rush, “Stevie left.  She came down to the kitchen for a glass of water.  She said to say thank you  She was nice, but I don’t think she is coming back.  She’s not right for you anyway.  I called her a cab.”
“Power cord, I think it was off a kettle.”
I go to shut the album knowing there will be nothing else inside.  I pause.  One of the photos is missing.  In the space that the envelope took up.  It is the one with the deer and the rifle.  I shudder but I shake off the feeling as I snap the album shut.
Sherlock reaches out across the chasm between us and takes my hand.  “Stop thinking.  I need to sleep.”
He is sitting up now with his knees to his chest, staring at the empty fireplace.  He doesn’t blink.  Just stares with fixed eyes.  I hold the mug of water out to him.  Still no response.  I clear my throat.  Nothing.
Thank you all for taking this journey with me.  You have given me great joy.
Still nothing.  When I touch him on the knee, he nearly levitates.  I jump too.  Water runs down my fingers.
“Nice idea,” I say, rubbing his back, “but I can hardly afford to be out of a job.”
He goes quiet and I am almost going to suggest we go somewhere warmer, maybe even get a cuppa, when he starts talking again.
or does it all sound rubbish and you really want to read something else.  I don't really do prompts, but you never know where inspiration will strike.  Inspire me you clever souls.
Sherlock sinks down in his chair.  Rosie is still calling to him and waving her arms to get his attention.  Sherlock doesn’t notice.  He is looking into the empty fireplace.
“That’s it.  That’s what happened.  That is why I have been such a mess since I got back.”
I am not prepared for what I find inside the envelope.  My eyes flick between the disturbing photo, made all the more unsettling for the knife wound that is now through the neck of the Sherlock effigy.  It is clear who the cruel words are from.  My heart is pounding against my ribs as I read through it and realise all the implications of what is said.  The holding a piece of tangible evidence of the continued indignities Sherlock has suffered at this man’s hands brings everything home with a sense of shocking reality.  The knowledge that his rapist witnessed him calling out for me in desperation cuts deeply.  I flush hot and my skin prickles with fluctuating quantities of rage that I understand clearly and embarrassment that I don’t.
“Yes, um, no, sporadically.  Mostly be have been good friends.”
“What…was that?”  John sounds unsure of himself as he asks.
I didn’t sleep well last night.  I cannot stop thinking about it.  I thought I was past reliving every moment from that hell hole in Serbia, but I’m not.  It is all back again with a few additional interruptions.  This time, when I dream about being waterboarded it is blood they are pouring over my face.  It’s Magnussen that has the stapler and the car battery.  It is not Claire’s death I am trying to avenge, but Mary’s.  It is John who sits there and watches while they beat me, while Rimac rapes me.
While I wait for my body to sort out its internal dramas my thoughts wonder to John.  How is he coping with the things I told him?  It was a lot to take it.
“You get my point, though, right?  It’s not all about genitals; no one loves someone just for their bits.  If you love him, it doesn’t matter what equipment he has.  You’ll figure it out in the bedroom.  I’m sure you have practiced with a dick and balls before, you’ll be fine.”
“It’s ok, Blossom, I’ve got you.”  I mumble into her hair, trying to sound soothing, but I think it might be her who is soothing me.  I wonder how long I can do this for; this living in a limbo between fear and pseudo normality.  I used to enjoy things that were novel and extreme and intense and volatile.  I want that again  I want to get back to work, to playing my violin, to do chemistry that makes sense, to have urgent calls from Lestrade and late nights solving problems, and to having John by my side the way it used to be before we both made such a mess of things.
Another fit of laughter makes me pause again.  At least the anaesthetic has really kicked in by the time I am composed enough to work.  Sherlock allows me to concentrate, lying back and shutting his eyes.  I don’t want him to have any more scars so I take my time and do the finest stitches I can manage.
John begged of his employer: did he know of rare medicaments to be had anywhere, anywhere at all? But the eminent physicians his employer named shook their heads regretfully and could not help.
My leg would not allow me to maintain this position for long, but I expected I would not have to. I laid the fingertips of my left hand upon his parted lips and pressed there; at once, I felt his tongue move delicately against the pads of my fingers, one by one, and then he started over again with my forefinger and drew each finger in turn into his mouth, pushing his tongue up and sucking as he would my prick. “Yes,” I said, “that’s good, and now how about this” — I bent to worry with my teeth at his nipple, so tender and ruddy a bonbon, and drew my free hand down his side to hold his hip.
Terror made the room whoosh out and then back in. “Oh,” Sherlock replied, mastering himself, taking a calm and ordinary breath, “was that a mistake? I thought it more in the nature of an investment — ‘He did just what he said he’d do, he didn’t string me along,’ impressing all her equally feeble-minded friends with my probity. No?”
“No,” Sherlock said. “I can’t tell you.”
” — Sherlock rolled his eyes, which made him retch again, three cheers for heroin and the withdrawal from same — “and fancied himself not quite domesticated. I told him I didn’t want a record made, and he never generated one.” A cramp struck, but Sherlock tried not to show it, in case Jim thought he was overdramatizing to hide a lie. There was so much sweat at the base of his spine now that it was soaking through the duvet.
,” Jim said. He was holding the envelope between the fingers of both hands, walking the fingers up and down the paper. Watching him was like biting metal, Sherlock thought. “But I just don’t know, Will. You let her off so easy!”
the fox replied.
Of course, he would need to employ certain costly ingredients.
The year was 1899, the month September; the precise date escapes me, but I remember how I dawdled over my breakfast, luxuriating in the fact that on this, the first fine day after a week of unremitting rain, I had no patients to visit. Dawdling over my breakfast meant dawdling over the papers, as well; I liked, when I had time, to pore through the advertisements and trivial-seeming items, for I made something of a game of attempting to spot what might catch my friend’s interest. I flatter myself that over the years of our acquaintanceship my skills have improved, though in my mind’s ear I hear him tease me: “Indeed you do flatter yourself, my boy.”
things.”
He spent part of the day on the bench overlooking the road. Weeks had passed since more wounded had been brought in: the war was over, someone had won it, there would be a new ruler or there would not. Soon, perhaps, the road would see farm carts, travelers’ carriages, the coach that bore the mail. In the afternoon John took his cane and walked for a while, aimlessly, passing between sun and shade and wondering where he might go and what he might do. His fever did not return, nor did the dreams, that evening or the next or the next; he spent some weeks helping the nurses tend the last of the wounded, and when finally the paymaster counted out the coin he was owed for his service he took up his cane and his rucksack and turned his steps toward the city.
Somewhere a klaxon was going off.
), but now hope has split him open.
Sherlock shook his head.
is what John hears, plain as the doorbell, or as the smell of Superglue. “Of course,” Sherlock says, and again: “Cases.” John steals a look; he’s not sure whether he can see the small vertical line between Sherlock’s brows, the little scrunch in his nose, or whether the light is insufficient and it’s only that John knows the expression is there. Sherlock frowning over a deduction. What is there for Sherlock to frown about here? The situation is perfectly clear to John, therefore there cannot possibly be any mystery to Sherlock.
Sherlock’s organizing his forensics texts and doesn’t turn. “Or you could omit the intermediate steps. The place is habitable now. Move in.”
. Perhaps that would be enough to persuade him to remain with me; a man cannot help his nature, perhaps, but he may choose not to act on its urgings — and Holmes deserved to know to what sort of man he had bound his life —
Not so much as a broken black feather did John find: no wound. Her plumage shimmered with a thousand fragments of moonlight. Around her and John, a breeze began to lift; the raven lowered her head, drew her body forward, and spread her wings.
he thought on waking, always
seem to be real, as is the attempted coup in Montenegro.
I have always liked the way even a small pain has a dramatic effect on Holmes. I bit him; he raised his head and tried to suck down my entire hand. No one but me has ever seen this libertine Holmes. No one but me knows how quickly his mouth grows wet and how his lips shine like a Cleveland Street whore’s. “If I had three hands,” I said, “I could fuck your mouth with one and pinch both your teats.” He was lapping at my fingers like a thirsty dog and I was tempted to remain as I was but I had not completed my demonstration by any means.
of you?”
Tuesday afternoon Willis phoned on the burner Jim had supplied him with for the job. “Mr. Jenkins, the stuff's gone and I don't know where. I don't know what — ” His voice was thin, getting down near the whistle end of things.
In the hospital tent someone placed a cool cloth over John Watson’s forehead, and he stirred.
“Suppose,” I continued, shifting about, “I had a hand to frig you with, and another to roll your stones in, like this” — he gasped and pushed up into my grip — “and two to pinch you, as I did before? Suppose I fucked your mouth with one hand and your arse with the other? That’s only six hands, Sherlock; what might I do with the other two? Hold you down, perhaps, or spank you?  And I’d still have my mouth free for all the filth you like to hear from me.”
Mycroft moved the corners of his lips to acknowledge their expectancy, and went on. “
But Wiggins wasn't Jim.
John reminds himself, blinking, trying not to cry out against the pain: there’s no malice, not even any anger, in Sherlock’s voice; “no longer lovers” merely states a fact which he, John, brought into existence with words, like the last spell someone with no magic left could cast. He sits down. Sherlock has invited him to.
Wiggins), partly by telegram, and at last
the current says: he cannot be a doctor without magic. He cannot be — what can he be? His mind flings up possibilities.
“Not possible,” Sherlock heard himself say. He had just become aware of every minute of the time since he had fixed. What was he doing here? He needed to get back to the flat. Jim might have come back while he was out, might have removed the precious packet that Sherlock had left behind when he went out.
“I believe that the sensations I experience with respect to you resemble those humans call love, also loneliness,” Sherlock says, with the same courteous manner as before.
What time was it what time was it what time was it —
“Which?” she said, absently, drawing out a piece of the liver.
Then the hooves, the horn, the baying red-eyed hounds were gone, and John Watson stood once again beside an empty silent road, on a dark plain, in the moonlight.
When he has moved in, he stands for some time at the window, with Rosie in his arms, looking at the familiar long view over the low roofs behind. Sherlock is downstairs, scoffing at emails under his breath and rapid-fire typing out the answers to the “ludicrously simple” problems they present. The room accommodates, closely spaced, John’s new bed, his blocky dark brown wardrobe, a rocking chair, Rosie’s crib, and a chest of drawers in white pressboard. The matching toy chest rests in the sitting room downstairs, blocking the fireplace for safety’s sake. The old cow skull was destroyed in the explosion, so Rosie’s toy chest is watched over by the articulated skeleton of a Tower raven: a Mycroftian house-warmer.
have failed.
“Aw,” Jim said.
He was ready. It would all go quickly. Down and done. The train’s operator would likely never see him anyway. It would not do to think of those on the platform watching, so Sherlock didn’t think of them.
“What d’you . . . ?” John asks, dumbly, and now Sherlock turns to look at him again.
... glory.
“Yes,” says the tired mother, in a voice of certainty. She conveys Beakley, on her finger, to the aviary’s open door.
“Sorry?” But Jim’s meaning was obvious, of course, and Sherlock should have seen this coming: he could hardly play aide-de-camp to Andrew Rockham while absenting himself at scheduled intervals to shoot up. The relief of fixing evaporated, but he managed a nod and a shrug. “Needs must.”
The note inside bears no salutation.
She spoke with entire conviction; I was too appalled to do more than gasp. As for Holmes, he actually drew back his lip in scorn. “I should have thought blackmail beneath you,” he said.
“Hey, that was a good first outing, but Don’t. Get. Cocky. All right?”
He passes off the effects of Make-it-better as those of a hug and a soothing voice, which he should have been providing anyway, as he would have done if not for his own arse-over-teakettle interior state. He feeds the rest of his assigned patients on automatic and doesn’t try any more spells: he isn’t ready to make medical history just yet — in imagining which it occurs to him, given Sherlock is capable of devising a counter to Superglue, he’s also capable of tailoring that counter precisely to John, like one of those individualized cancer-treatment potions based on a patient’s own DNA. “No,” Sherlock would say, frowning puzzled at some number of assembled scientists (tablets in hand; agog), “I didn’t make the counterpotion useful to patients in general; why should I have?”
TKDT reuptake inhibitors take effect in weeks, not minutes, he reminds himself. He puts the chicken and potatoes in a pan to heat on the stove, then forgets about them till he smells smoke, because all he can think is
But the spaces and textures of the flat are proxies for what John misses most. Sherlock has arranged himself in his leather chair, feet flat on the floor, hands folded together and resting on his right thigh; he’s looking at John with an expression of mild interest. The only aspect of his demeanor to convey that he might have a stake in whatever John may do or say is his utter stillness.
Sherlock was horrified to hear his breath whistle in his tightened throat.
John is clutching Sherlock’s arm as hard as he can, and biting his lip. Sherlock takes a worried look at him: John’s eyes are shining and he draws, if possible, closer to his friend.
—to —
“Bored yet?” said the voice. It wasn’t directed at Sherlock this time. “Heave-ho, me hearties — ”
But of course, my tales of Holmes’s cases had more than once hinted that he thought little of women — the very fact that Miss Irene Adler was
Rockham hadn’t moved his gaze, hadn’t pointed, hadn’t — Oh, he was a clever man, clever indeed. He had, of course, picked the one person in the room whom he could be almost entirely confident Sherlock didn’t already know. Precisely: the blonde.
Sherlock shrugged. “And yet it has led both of us to the same conclusion.”
John tries to think of it like this: there was the time after the army and before Sherlock; he had been alone during those months. Then Sherlock cured his limp and, for a while, standing, eating, sleeping beside all that imperious beauty, John had felt whole and important again. He’d been wrong, it turned out, about the importance, but for as long as that feeling had lasted — as long as that silk cord had seemed to run between himself and Sherlock — it had been ...
to say, “What is it, old man?”
He gathered up the crumpled loo paper from the floor and flushed it away. There was a package of four rolls under the bathroom sink but he had gone through one entire roll, wiping his eyes and nose and mouth, already. He tried to consider the question whether Jim would be suspicious if he asked for an extra package this week; how long was the runny nose meant to last? He couldn’t remember that from rehab, probably because once the cramps and the trots started they subsumed awareness of everything else. Another thing to consider: If the cramps started soon, would they end sooner, or would an early start only mean a longer bout of cramps?
A page of the
John set the fox down on the moon-tipped grass of the roadside and looked at him. The fox rested on his haunches and looked back at John. Fox grin. The blood had vanished; the fox’s untorn flanks were smooth. John turned his hands over and over: they should have been sticky with blood, but they were as clean as the fox’s black-tipped coat. He reached down and stroked the fox along his back. Along his right side. Along his left side. The fox sat up, lifting his lip —
even if his coordination wasn’t everything it could have been, and then the voice had abandoned piratical inflections in favor of a near-falsetto “Oopsy-daisy,” and then there was a car door opening, but why didn’t they leave him alone, and what about his gear? He twisted and, with some success, bucked — “Needs a top-up,” said the voice at his feet. A baritone like Sherlock’s own, so the rumble came right through the hands and into Sherlock’s ankles.
“As I have said,” Mycroft resumed, “the logical next step is to provoke outright civil disorder in as many of the NATO states as possible. What we lack, thanks to what I might call either the colossal failures of our intelligence services” — here the JIO chairman rolled his eyes; he really was not bad at the double act — “or the stupendous success of the Russians’, is any inkling of how they intend to proceed toward it.
Now the days were filled with talk. Day after day: My dog/cat/bird/husband/wife/boyfriend/girlfriend/daughter/son/demented grandparent is ill/missing/dead; can you help me find them/cure them/speak with them? What shall I do about my job? Is my husband cheating on me?
first thing, even before he came after her, and he got trolleyed and then passed out under some shrubberies on Hampstead Heath, but it was a cold night and he died of hypothermia, which would have been fine only ever since he had been trying to come home, you see, and so he had been haunting her.
The website belongs to Greater London Lovebird Rescue. Sherlock regards it with pleasure. Photographs depict lovebirds of several species, flying about well-lit aviaries large enough to hold small trees, a fountain, and plenty of toys and puzzles. The caption explains how the toys and puzzles are switched out every few days, to preserve the birds’ interest in them by keeping them novel. To the right of the last photograph of the aviary is one of a young man who hones his arts-and-crafts skills by inventing additional, clever birdy puzzles.
There was no reason to conclude, in the absence of further data, that there had been a murder; especially there was no reason to conclude that, had there been a murder, the victim was anyone known to Sherlock. He kept going up Chalk Farm Road to the next entry. It was open; Sherlock went in and then circled along the horse stalls and toward Camden Lock Place till he hit the backside of the crime scene. From here he could see the screen that had been put up in front of the Tibetan handicrafts stall. There was a gray-haired man in mufti, looking tired and in charge, talking with a couple of women in Tyvek suits; after some time, a body bag on a wheeled stretcher emerged.
Always, John. Always.]
Head-tilt of agreement. “It was impossible to know what imaging would disclose without undergoing imaging.”
Watson has always had the gift of goading me into high spirits.
John reminded himself.
Sherlock is sat on the edge of the pushed-together cots, wearing only his pants. At John’s entrance he delivers his sharkiest grin, the one he otherwise reserves for lying witnesses, and shifts his legs even farther apart than they already are. On the bedside table are two key cards.
The stuff of John’s days took on a translucency — he felt he could, if he looked hard enough, see through to a doubled world behind every stone, every gateway, every wall. A wooden door, painted green, with a transom of green glass overhead: did it not have an air of mystery, somehow?
This wish not having been granted, he tried again: “
There was this to be said: in rehab, they gave you different drugs so as to mitigate the effects of withdrawal from the drugs you preferred. Sherlock knew Jim too well by now to imagine that mercy would be offered him; far too much fun to be had in watching someone writhe and snivel, even when Jim wasn’t producing those effects with any tools he wielded himself. Sherlock was going to beg, and Jim was going to enjoy his begging; there was nothing more to say about that.
Sherlock watched the currents of the room for a while, seeing how they flowed around Rockham, noting where Rockham’s attention lingered, to whom and what it returned. The people in the room who weren’t rich investors mainly gave him a wide berth, but Masters of the Universe always thought they were sexy even if they weren’t, and those in their vicinity usually picked up on the vibe even if they didn’t like it. There was a certain amount of appreciativeness aimed Rockham’s way. Not all of it was unwilling, not all of it came from women, and most of those feeling it would probably have denied it.
“Still, it’s a promotion and I know you’ll see it that way. The really big things are coming soon. Sooner than you think.
Once upon a time, John might have been the generous medical director, buying the staff lunch a couple of times a year. Now he’s the recipient of their generosity, and he’s grateful for it, and also embarrassed and ashamed at how he sometimes forgets himself — forgets that he’s not a doctor anymore, not the man in authority; that, in fact, the aides are good at what they do and more able than he will ever be.
“You were — ” John began, and stopped himself from saying
Or: “Watson,” he says, “that color is called indigo, and this one violet.”
Sherlock settles into his new life.
but now — “Christ,” he says, “Christ, I’m going to be on the fucking dole for the rest of my fucking life.”
” Wasn’t it supposed to be the
And the most important question:
“Yes.” An itch was setting up in the skin of Sherlock’s forearms. He found himself reluctant to scratch it when John Watson could see. Was there something else he should say? “And are you enjoying your life free of trouble?”
But John did not shrink back. He made himself stand straight though he shuddered under the riders’ empty gaze. The horses thundered on.
John is laying Tranquilium for a patient who presents with migraine. In the form he’s using, Tranquilium downregulates production of the neurotransmitter triskaidekotonin, TKDT, high levels of which are implicated in migraine and normal levels of which mediate neocortical activity associated with the exercise of magic.
Chapter title from Louise Bogan's poem
So now John could clean, stitch, dress, and bandage a wound. It was not nothing — he was useful, and also the physician began to pay him more. But sometimes he sat at the window in his smallish darkish room, remembering the war — but it was good that the war was over — and the dreams that had come to him with his fevers. He began to think that the raven’s feather, the fox’s whisker, and the serpent’s scale had come to him by earthly chance, not from that other world. Nevertheless, he kept them.
“At least four,” the chairman replied sourly; “five, if the silence from our man in the Russian Defence Ministry means what I think we all suspect it does.”
He had, as usual, aggrandized the paper to himself, so I had not yet seen it, and naturally I feared that there was some news, even more dreadful than usual, of the War; but his look was one of annoyance rather than of distress. “Have a care not to look at your bees with that expression,” I therefore told him; “they’ll flee their hives, never to return.”  Holmes had unbent a great deal since the happy change in our relations a decade and a half before, and I delighted thus to rally him. His own amusement at my teasing seemed sometimes to surprise him; he would shake his head, smiling downward, almost abashed. The effect enchanted me.
which he had found, he told her, in a section of the British Library to which access was scarcely ever granted, and which had furnished him with valuable insights that were informing his work as he developed a ritual suitable for her.
“Four. These small and militarily weak nations were vassals of the USSR, and Putin would like nothing better than to see them vassal states — and buffers against invasion from the west — once more.
“Nah,” Jim said, “you shouldn’t have caffeine late at night, it’s no good for you.”
In the ragged hours of the night, John Watson sprang awake, listening. There was nothing to hear, and then a gasp, the flat thump of fists against flesh, a body falling. The back alley was empty: where had the sounds come from, then? And no one else in the house had been roused, it seemed. John buckled on his knife, meaning to take himself downstairs — but there, leaning against the corridor wall next to John’s door and bent to hold back the blood streaming from his thigh —
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock is staring at him, mouth open. “But — ”
“Give me the wallet.”
The trial continues for three months. John tries to hope that he’s in the placebo arm, because the foam-ball tests make it clear that he’s had no return at all of magical function — if he’s getting TKDT, and if the TKDT is passing into his brain, it’s not accomplishing a thing when it gets there — but when the results are unblinded it turns out that what arm he was in doesn’t matter: the new delivery method has failed.
“I told you you’d take to the work like a duck to water,” Jim replied.
Mycroft once told John that Ella was an idiot, but the events at Sherrinford had made many things clear, among them the fact that the genius of Sherlock’s older brother didn’t extend as fully as he thought it did to the workings of actual human persons. John did miss the war: Mycroft was right about that. But Ella had been right about the trust issues, she had been right about the PTSD, and she had not exactly been wrong about the blog, either, had she, though John’s efforts in that department hadn’t worked as she might have hoped. John could write about Sherlock, he could write about their cases, he could respond lightly or sternly to comments; what the blog couldn’t teach him to do was to look at a feeling and name it.
John says, “I don’t know which should come first, the apology or the thanks.”
“Oh,” Sherlock says, only that. He gets up and crosses the small space of floor between his chair and John’s. John’s heart clamors; he stands up into Sherlock’s space, still looking at him, trying to send out toward Sherlock each grain and every atom of his wordless love, and as Sherlock studies his face John sees his own emotions mirrored there, fear desire admiration tenderness yearning delight, in sequence, in combination after combination, one blending into another until finally Sherlock has learnt all of them and they resolve into joy — and Sherlock, who from the first moment John saw him has been working magic that no one else can do, says, “Yes. Of course, yes,” and John kisses him.
Needle in, needle through . . .
he thought: for he seemed to see the archer look toward him as the riders drove by, and there came the sound of the horn.
Evening by evening, night by night, the crescent moon grew toward the full, and night by night Sherlock lay with John in the narrow bed. John’s employer rallied him: “My friend, I see you’re dull of a morning but you brighten with the afternoon. You’ve got someone at home, then, have you? And eager to get back to her?”
The snake put out its tongue, testing. John didn’t move, except for the hand with which he caressed the coils around his arm.
He could avail himself of TFL’s convenient, cheap euthanasia service another time, if it became necessary.
: because Rockham’s tone was not entirely flat, and he didn’t turn away. His eyes were sharp on Sherlock’s face. Neither of them looked at the blond woman on his other arm.
“John,” said Holmes the night after Lestrade’s case had concluded, “I can’t help but wonder about — well, your early writings, let’s call them.” He was, at that moment, resting his head against my breast, and he must have heard my heart quicken, for he raised himself up and turned his face toward me, looking troubled.
This doesn’t quite seem to make sense, and the next thing Sherlock says, almost under his breath, is genuinely baffling: “How did I ever think I could pull this off?”
On second thought, all-round extreme incompetence was not interesting but merely tiresome. Mycroft returned his head to the vertical and allowed himself to look bored: as a rule, this had the effect of making hostile interlocutors quail. The Foreign Secretary stared back.
“Really, this is too much.” He was now laughing into the sleeve of his dressing gown.
There was time to remember that once he had had not only relief but also pleasure, and just time to set that thought aside. He told the walls, “I’ll need access to the Internet”; then he put his head down.
It occurs to John, too, to wonder whether the reversal of Superglue is permanent. Not that that matters, really, because if he needs to take Sherlock’s potion in perpetuity, if his magicless state is like a chronic disease, then Sherlock will simply make more —
“You see how her dress doesn’t hang quite smoothly? That’s the less-than-perfect bias cut. And from close up you’ll find that the seams don’t lie flat,” Sherlock said. “So now you do know something about women’s clothing. Call that an informational aperitif.
He finished dressing himself just before the doorbell rang. The heroin-delivery minion looked at him hard.
Jim squatted, to shout directly into Sherlock’s face. His breath was minty. Sherlock forced himself not to lean away. “Cute, Will.
“Like it?” Jim extended an arm to encompass the space: he was an estate agent, or — a more unsettling notion — a naughty-weekend hotelier. Sherlock thought it was the former; Jim’s interest in him was invasive enough, intimate even, but not specifically sexual. It was only Sherlock’s mind that he wanted to slip his fingers into. Arse-fuck or mind-fuck, Sherlock could handle either one, but both together, and with Jim . . . The voice he didn’t like, the voice that used the word
Everything John did up to that point was fine, it was okay, he was preventing a murder — come to that, he was protecting Sherlock, too, because how many killings could even Mycroft cover up, not to mention how Sherlock himself would feel, later, because the killing of Magnussen was one thing, it protected John’s little family when there was no other means available; but this, this would have been murder through and through, and not only in the eyes of the law.
“No, shut up,” John says, feeling himself go crimson.
Holmes had, I feared, begun to suspect that something was amiss, though as yet he had not voiced any anxieties, and I did not know what I dreaded more: that he would come to the right conclusion; or that he would come to any of several plausible wrong conclusions. That I wearied of him. That I wished to indulge myself with others. That I had come to feel distaste for our shared pleasures — for I didn’t! But one may find a dish delicious and yet feel that it would be enhanced by a sprinkling from the salt cellar.
As one, they turn toward the enmarbled animate again. “This,” Sherlock says, “is the product of meticulous labor. One is tempted to call it passionate. The same, of course, could be said of the slashed throat. Passionate, I mean; you certainly couldn’t call a knife to the throat ‘meticulous.’”

), whistled as he might whistle up his dog —
“I hate all of you,” the second-youngest says, meaning that he knows they’re right.
“Only a general disdain for the sex, never publicly disavowed.”
Two days after John returned the lovebird, he was walking around and around London, and what if Sherlock hadn’t been knocked over by that scooter? The empty room in his Mind Palace, the one with the list headed “Things I would like in a friend,” would still be empty. John sees the look on Sherlock’s face and says “It’s all right, I’m here,” and presses Sherlock to himself and then both of them are distracted by subsequent events that don’t involve breakfast except in connection with the spreadability of jam, so that John forgets all about the conversation.
“Well.” John sat in the space Sherlock had made. “You’re . . . an enchanted laundress, then?”
It is signed
And all their voices, quiet or laughing, from time to time sharp with annoyance, often eager with explanation, almost always warm.
The driver dropped John and Rosie off at the flat he had moved into with her after Mary died. It didn’t occur to John till later that he had no idea where Sherlock was staying.

Sherlock is not able to act casual well enough to fool John, who side-eyes him and protests: “You can’t go
“You’re not a superspy, either. You know how I know that?”
Two hours later, there came a telegram from Watson:

He did, somehow, fall asleep.
Jim’s mouth made a surprised O although the rest of his face didn’t change. “Testy! Well, I can understand — all those hours spent sadly jonesing away. And me with such a treat for you.”
“They won’t know.”
I shook my head.
Jim touched the tip of his tongue to his forefinger and then touched the forefinger to his own leg with a hiss. “You’re on fire!”
Watson shrugged, but his hand remained steady on Sherlock’s arm. “You did say I crave danger, didn’t you? So, I’ll take the risk that nobody doing inventory notices one unaccounted-for suture kit and a local.” They walked on a few more paces; then: “As long as we’re being unofficial, I’m John.”
“On your way out ask Mrs Hudson to send up a fresh pot of tea, and mind where you drop the paper tomorrow.”
Macdermid and Zardari were assets: competent, and capable of independent thought. Skeffings, the Defence Secretary, was useful when well managed. About Cyril de la Pole there was nothing to be done but to ignore him and wait for the Prime Minister to see fit to attend briefings himself. Hareton, now — Hareton was neither here nor there unless he took it into his head that he understood a situation, but that was exactly what he had done.
“It’s such a relief,” Delia Smithson went on, “that you can see it. My aura, I mean. It feels — just gray to me. He’s everywhere I go, Mr. Holmes. Showing his face just for a moment and then he’s gone. Around a corner or in a crowd . . . It’s worst in the tube; nobody notices one extra figure. I’ve even asked people standing near him to get hold of him, you know, so I could confront him, because I would, but of course he’s a disembodied
“Ah, John! In Piccadilly he would be a needle in a haystack; better for him to continue here, for I mean to have Wiggins look for him tomorrow. If Wiggins thinks him quick enough, and forms a good opinion of his character, we might make a place for him among the Irregulars.”

All present stare at him, eliciting the inevitable sigh and eye-roll.
One might think that my years in the Army, and more recently my years as Sherlock Holmes’s enthusiastic partner in what we are taught to regard as unnatural acts, had stripped me of such reticences. In any case I knew perfectly well that Holmes would never allow my retreat to pass uninvestigated.
“I reckon Mr. Holmes knows me,” she replied. “Don’t
The tired mother gets a warm hello when she phones Greater London Lovebird Rescue, arrangements are made for the family to bring Beakley in the next afternoon, and Sherlock is briefly tempted to pump his fist in the air when he gets the text from the rescue group’s director. He recovers his dignity in time and spends the evening in the kitchen, producing small, controlled explosions to stand in for fireworks. It remains only to shanghai John, which is easily done because John generally prefers to be wherever Sherlock is and also has not got work the next day, so there will be no need to wheedle him into phoning in sick or to kidnap his patients and thereby prevent them from turning up for their appointments.
“I am constrained to agree with Ms. Zardari,” said Macdermid. “To cultivate specific well-placed informants is one thing, but to encourage all to inform against all . . .”
Jim put his head around the door before Sherlock had been at his desk an hour. “A little bird told me you had a rough night, so I canceled your afternoon clients for you,” he said. “Want to take a guess who this is?”
As for the clients: information about how phony clairvoyants produced their effects was widely available — even Wikipedia had quite a serviceable article about cold reading; if people chose to remain ignorant of these facts, and to allow themselves to be misled, that was hardly Sherlock’s lookout.
— No. “Stupid stupid stupid,” he repeated, until the word stopped meaning anything. He put his right hand in his jacket pocket and rubbed his thumb against the side of his forefinger, and eventually the meaningless sound and the rubbing combined to enable him to think further.
“It’s not a very impressive deduction,” Sherlock replied.
voice, offering indecencies that I don’t care to set down even here, though I have set down so much else. I believe both Holmes and I blushed scarlet; but on Miss Winter’s face I could see, until her impersonation was done, only salaciousness — salaciousness, and the despair of one who knows not when he will next be warm, and dry, and fed.
“I’m not altogether sure how to feel about that,” said the chairman drily. “. . . You really have nothing?”
Wiggins was weighing out powder and tipping it into glassine bags, which he held open awkwardly between the pinky and thumb of his right hand because the forefinger and middle finger had been splinted. The air in his flat smelled of antiseptic from A&E. “Ah,” Wiggins said when Sherlock let himself in, “you fuck off out of here, man.” Both Wiggins’s parents taught at Cambridge, but he liked to affect working-class authenticity around Sherlock, to emphasize that Sherlock was slumming.
He left unsaid
“Subfolder of ‘Open Cases.’” She turned toward the screen, keeping her bloody-gloved hands well away from her companion. “Next to the one with ‘Weird’ on it.”
The morning grayed and brightened, and as day came on John’s fever dropped.
“I don’t think it’s true,” Sherlock said. “That you’re enjoying your life free of trouble.”
“This end was inevitable, John — since you’ve worked it out, you must see that. I’m not a human being but a product of illicit magic. My entire legal existence is based on documentation I myself forged, or else bought with money I stole from my — from Andreas Coburne, when I ran away. Even supposing I had enforceable rights, a nonexistent — being — can easily be made to vanish, and of course the scientific interest — ”
“And he beat Harry,” John continues. “He didn’t beat me. But I beat you. Why . . .”
Two more rings and the call would go to voicemail. Sherlock swiped Answer. “Hello, Mr. Holmes,” said Andrew Rockham.
He had trailed a red-scarfed woman no farther than Montague Place before a man in a safety-orange jacket appeared, heading west. Sherlock peeled off from Red Scarf to follow him; the jacket was like a lantern in the crowd. They were nearly at the Tottenham Court Road when it occurred to Sherlock that he was not following his plan of action, for several people wearing garments yellow at least in part had passed.
Sherlock had never been able to hold a job, never really tried, but this wasn’t quite a job; it was more in the nature of a consultancy, surely, and one well matched to Sherlock’s talents, at that.
He had stripped out of the wet clothes, never mind who might see, put the thermal shirt on backward twice, panting, then finally getting it right on the third try. Sherlock sat in the back of the ambulance with Rosie tucked under his coat and his knees bent up to make a palisade in front of them, swaying a little. He must have been exhausted. When John was dressed, he handed Rosie back and took off his coat to drape it over all of them. Under it he drew his arm over John’s shoulders and squeezed, once, lightly, then withdrew and wrapped himself around his own legs and put his head down, and that was how they waited till one of Mycroft’s cars came to take all of them home.
“Not bad,” Sherlock said, with complete sincerity.
“You want me to run cons — specifically, you’re thinking that a psychic would usefully diversify your business.”
I'm participating in the Fandom Trumps Hate auction, for which bidding starts this Thursday, January 12.
“It” was two first-floor rooms on Montague Street, above the shopfront where Sherlock was to ply his trade. The flat was furnished in the same style as the room where Sherlock had been kept two days before, neutrally tasteful, like the pied-à-terre a large corporation might keep for traveling executives. On the walls hung black-and-white “art” photos: a leaf, printed in high contrast to make the veins stand out; a nautilus, printed in high contrast to make the divisions in the shell stand out. They set Sherlock’s teeth on edge.
“‘Attention,’” she repeated, scoffingly. “No. ‘Attention’ might be watching the sway of a girl’s hips as she passes, and giving her a wink. Or giving her a card with sentimental verses out of a guide to courting. That’s flattering enough in its way, but plain flattery wasn’t Adelbert’s trick. No, what he did was to make us feel ourselves seen — seen as real, proper persons, I mean. We women are desperate to be seen, Dr. Watson. You can’t imagine how rarely it happens or how it enlarges our spirits to feel it.”

It doesn’t. There’s an aftertaste something like cardamom; the cold water washes it away. John can’t remember another time when he was this frightened, unless it was the moment in Afghanistan, as he lay in the sand having given up, when he came to for a moment hearing medics’ voices: so he had something to lose again, after all.
Sherlock says, “But the information — ”
It’s been a year since John didn’t blow his brains out in some secret place and he still can’t sleep in the dark, but he has a new lamp with a dimmer control to help him work his way through the shades of dusk. He doesn’t know why it’s so important to him to be able to sleep in the dark but it is.

(June, 1917)
The sound the soldier made now was very like it.
And what of those seemingly unguarded moments like the one at the Ladies’ Bathing Pond, the moments when Sherlock, looking at the remains of what had once been alive and had suffered, could say “it”?
was a post-WWI right-wing German narrative, false of course, that the German military hadn’t lost the war but had been betrayed by German civilians, specifically republicans (the lower-case kind) and Jews. Needless to say, the Nazis ate up and exploited the “stab in the back.” It's interesting to note the myth's
The anticipated telegram arrived even before I had finished with Goldschmidt’s paper:
“I can manage without your medical history. You allergic to lidocaine or latex?”
Was in John’s arms.
The thaumatology consultant had, as promised, enrolled John in a first-phase clinical trial of a new means of delivering TKDT that, it’s hoped, will enable it to cross the blood–brain barrier. Every day he takes twenty milliliters of a tasteless pale-pink liquid that may or may not be a suspension of TKDT, and once a week he visits the neurothaumatology lab at UCLH, high in the glass-walled biomedical research tower, where he repeats the imaging and function tests done at A&E the day of his accident. Prince Charles probably hates the tower, but its structure, two shallow curves of wing separated by a central column, reminds John of the architecture of a human skeleton, as no doubt it’s supposed to do; he finds it elegant. Graceful, even.
“Catch you later,” Jim said, and he and the guards went out.
There being little more to be made of this cryptic communication, if indeed it was a communication, I deemed it best to wait upon events.
The very youngest child says nothing and only watches with her mouth hanging open.

“Keep that wound clean,” John Watson said. “The sutures can come out in eight or ten days and I’m going to take a guess you’ll take care of them yourself.”
Jim decides to expand Sherlock's horizons.
Instead, he took a nap after his first fix, woke properly in the early afternoon, with the light from the street-side windows shifting cloud-sun-cloud in a high breeze, and went downstairs to relieve the day’s two scheduled marks of their money. Andrew Rockham’s existence had gone some way toward answering the question of why Jim had invested so much time and money in setting Sherlock up as, when it came down to it, a small-potatoes grifter: the cold reading, the shamming of interest and fellow-feeling, were all meant as practice for whatever enterprise Jim had in mind with Andrew Rockham as the mark. Sherlock was very good at scamming people now.
John looked up: the raven was perched on Sherlock’s motionless wrist.
It was really very bad of Watson to distract me from my studies. I donned my warmest coat and made for the Diogenes Club, with a view to sitting quietly in the company of others who were also sitting quietly. Later, Mycroft and I made dinner of a joint and some roast potatoes, and I returned to Baker Street quite late.
The Defence Minister nodded meekly.

Eating the delicious meals provided from Jim’s restaurants:
In the evening, once again, his fever rose.
It was a gamble, but people must constantly have been trying to climb Rockham’s ladder, and Sherlock’s bet was that every last one pretended they were only interested in the view.
“You said to string them along,” he reminded Jim one evening. “But — these are small fry who come in. Your profit, once you’ve paid for this building and my food and — and other expenses, must come to less than nothing. So why?”
Sherlock woke in the early evening and at once thought with pleasure of how he might pass the next hours; with two bags left and most of Jim’s money still in hand, there was no need to go busk for the tourists in Trafalgar Square, or to pick pockets on the tube. He took a shower — in the luxury of knowing he could top up any time, he almost enjoyed the metronymic want
We were, then, contentedly browsing over our papers and journals, anticipating a day of doing nothing much — Holmes had proposed a visit to the Natural History Museum — when Mrs. Hudson appeared to announce the arrival of a lady. Well! I have said we did not
He could pass Dr. Watson’s clinic the next time he took a walk.
One evening in March there was a late snow. Sherlock — casually, so casually — left open the door of the consulting room; from his desk, he had a line of sight to the front windows. Between the curtains, drawn together to reassure clients of their counselor's care for privacy, was a gap of a few inches through which, if he glanced in that direction from time to time, as if aimlessly, or as if raising his head from the screen, say to rest his eyes or to follow out a train of thought, Sherlock could catch — oh, a film frame's worth of soft-wet massy flakes as they drifted along that gap, slow-fleeting, made brilliant by street lamps and headlights that were themselves out of view.
But it was not. He sat and watched until he felt the ache in his bones that meant the fever was coming on.

(Migraine sufferers, as a rule, have stronger-than-average magic; neurologists have been studying the phenomenon for decades now, hoping to uncouple magic from misery, and failing. Practitioners who, like Sherlock, display powerful magic and no evidence of migraine, are research gold. Sherlock has coldly ignored all John's urgings to enroll in a study.)
Animatio has been illegal for a hundred and seventy years. “It is no more,” William Wilberforce had said, “than a means to create slaves from stone when flesh and blood are free,” and the aftermath of human slavery’s abolition proved him, posthumously, right. Animate servants were something of a fad, for a time, till in 1845 public revulsion put an end to the making of more; the last one had — died — in 1886. You could go, if you liked, to the warehouse in Nottinghamshire that sheltered all their remains, piled willy-nilly like rubble, which of course they were. From time to time someone tried to gin up a movement to repurpose them for builders’ stone.

Jim’s hand came down again, gently this time, thumb and forefinger delicately pinched around another envelope. “You’ll find this is much better quality than that dumb Niall ever sold.” He let the envelope drop the last few inches to the table; Sherlock managed not to snatch at it, but of course Jim saw the abortive movement. Sherlock thought he might grow to detest that
Sherlock mustered a dry “Thank you” at this.
“Was he queer? Or, you know, could he be? Given incentive.” Jim had stood again and was now beaming down at Sherlock.
“But then how — You know what, never mind. That laceration really needs seeing to. If I take you to the A & E at UCH you’ll be ages, but my clinic’s round the corner and I’m on my lunch break anyhow. I can get you cleaned up and stitched in half an hour and you can be on your way.”

So John looks at Sherlock as sternly as he can, which is not very sternly, in retaliation for Sherlock’s being ridiculous. He describes the house, four doors away from the awful flat he shared with Charlotte and Colin the Warlock, the lion door knocker that summoned no one, the Legos all over the floor, the tired mother, the five children. As he talks he drifts back to that day and his voice loses its color. When he gets to the part about how Beakley tried to stay in the shoe box instead of going in his cage, he has to stop.
The period of my connection with certain Holywell Street booksellers was not entirely a happy one, but it had in its way been adventurous, and I was sorry to think of the area, with all the memories it held for me, vanished from London’s map. And of course those memories were also memories of my youth, impecunious and sometimes desperate though it had been. I sighed, perhaps, or tutted — Holmes looked up from his own perusal of the

it. They were kids.”
Sherlock, who has been staring at it
Neither of us for an instant believed the other. We went on our way still smiling; it really was a lovely night.
John knows exactly what Lestrade is thinking — it’s what he’s thinking too:
He had at present a sole advantage, and that a fleeting one: Whatever he did in the flat for the next while was his alone. Without wifi, without a phone, with no access therefore to the news, he could only guess at how long that while might be.
After the door locks behind Sherlock, the little lovebird hops down from his one perch and begins, tentatively, to poke at the paper.
But the sitting room is dark, the kitchen shadows are cast only by streetlights, no light spills along the brief corridor to Sherlock’s room. John closes the bathroom door behind himself as quietly as he can, washes his face, brushes his teeth, then finds himself sitting on the closed lid of the toilet, unable to stand up. A little time passes before Sherlock comes in.
As Sherlock asleep is different from Sherlock waking, so Sherlock naked is different from Sherlock clad. To see Sherlock dressed, you would think he was made of smooth cream all over. In fact he is much scarred. He had been relatively careful about needles but the cocaine time was long, and then long again, plenty of opportunity for missteps, so faded purple clusters mark the crooks of his elbows, and his forearms are trailed with purple. Both his elbows and both his forearms, because Sherlock in his thoroughness taught himself to be ambidextrous. He was stabbed in the thigh once, when he was twenty-six, and then again in Switzerland by one of Moriarty’s people, while he was away. Astonishingly, no one had thought to break his fingers, but he has been burned with cigarettes: Serbia. There is a flat white splash of acid burn on the inside of his left wrist: Cambridge. White threads crisscross his back: Serbia again.
, “Or I could hold you like this, I could keep you still, with my hands on your hands, and my hands on your hips, and I could bring myself off on your belly and tease you too, so that you were frantic with it and imploring me to let you spend — would you like that?”
“Thank you,” John says now. “Yes, I’d like that. I’d — ” But the end of the sentence is a precipice, and drops away.
for Holmes had already set the book on his bedside table. “Do go on, Doctor,” he said.
The limp and the bleeding would make him conspicuous. Thus no pickpocketing, no Oyster card, and no speedy exit courtesy of Transport for London. There was nothing to do except to get up and go back to the flat, leaving a trail of blood apparently. The prospect didn’t appeal. Sherlock turned toward the person, the man, who had spoken.
Now he had another to add to those:
The thought floated up in the back of his mind that
“Oh! No, sir, you mistake me.” She clasped her hands together in her lap, evidently trying to find some better form of words. The minute easing of tension on Holmes’s face informed me that he and I had arrived at similar hypotheses concerning what she meant to say, and in the next moment we were proved right:
On Friday morning his phone woke him: an unfamiliar number. Sherlock frowned at it through two rings, three, four. If Jim felt like taunting him, he would show up in person, or Skype at least: what was the fun in making someone squirm if you couldn’t watch them do it?
“Sorry, do you — Have we met?”
John got up and opened his rucksack to find the envelope he had brought with him from the hospital tent. The whisker and the scale remained.
After several hazy moments of this John took pity on Sherlock’s visibly wrecked form, his words had long stopped making any kind of sense, and his cock was on the verge of bursting, angry red and leaking copious amounts of pre-come onto his flat stomach.
He sunk onto the floor and pressed his back against the wood. Waiting.
John tried to take a step back but stumbled upon one of the many small tables Sherlock had lying around with paint palettes and paintbrushes. John staggered back, pulling Sherlock with him and they fell in one tangled heap onto the ground, clutching each other in surprise.
And he, of course, just decided to wear his very best suit because it was the last class of the week and It was a nice way to end the week before his long weekend. Of course. Nothing of this had to do with John of course. It not like John would be wearing anything anyway!
John turned to Sherlock, who was fidgeting in his spot, unsure. John smiled. “Come over here, you”. He reached for him, wrapping his arms around his waist and pressing them together again chest to chest before he leaned in. He nudged at Sherlock’s face with his own and followed the warm damp breaths from his lips, and chased them with his lips.
Wincing internally Sherlock waited for the scalding remark John was bound to make. This is what always happened.
Mr John Hamish Watson.
And then they made out. Not really. Soon though. SOOOOOON.
“Hey, John!”
He breathed in deeply, counted to three and turned to look at John.
Much later that night John headed back to his room. Sherlock headed back to his own temporary common room with the Ravenclaws, though not before they both shared a charged goodbye that left John in something not unlike a trance throughout the entire walk to the Gryffindor common room.
Im sorry this took so long. Life got in the way and I had a very hard time with this chapter- not sure why. Anyway, thank you so much for reading and commenting. Please be nice to me, i'm scared haha
Sherlock was currently having a shouting match with Dimmock, showing him the results he’d gotten from the blood samples and slowly making him realize he was, of course, completely incorrect in almost all the information they had gathered before the artist had shown up. Annoyingly, Dimmock was being extra-thickheaded today and so was trying his best to find any tiny loopholes in Sherlock’s iron thick deductions. The artist rolled his eyes and tuned him out, scanning the crowd for John.
“Oh. Uh- yeah. Sure”
Let's pretend I didn't take a full month to update again ok?
Sherlock tried not to look but his eyes shifted to his left where he could see slivers of John’s skin through the thin gaps between the wooden plates of the screen. ‘
“Victor Trevor” the critic gritted out through his teeth, an equally pained grin pulling at his mouth. He gripped John’s hand tightly, John answering with an even tighter hold, Sherlock watching their hands tensed against each other unwilling to give in first.
Of course Sherlock's smitten from the very beginning. And of course he has no idea.
There it was again. That feeling. What was it? The same as the shimmering of energy one year ago under the tree in the backyard. The rush of heat pushing against his heart and forcing it to pump harder, to make itself heard. A melody… Crying out to be heard from the surface of his chest and his heart beating frantically to follow its rhythm. Electricity. Rushing from his chest to his toes and back up. And warmth. So much warmth crawling to his stomach and up his throat into his cheeks. What was that? He had no name for this. No recognition. He looked into John’s eyes with confusion, hoping to find the answers there but found echoing questions. Two hearts beating in time but not knowing the song.
He steeled himself. Into battle, then.
John walked into the Great Hall the next morning, already scanning the tables and rows of students for a familiar curly head. Anticipation thrummed low in his stomach. But after a quick scan and another more careful plucking out of individual faces and hair styles John didn’t spot Sherlock anywhere.
John cupped Sherlock’s face in his hands and once again touched his forehead to Sherlock’s. The taller boy was trembling under his fingertips, silent tears rolling down his cheeks as he felt waves of past pain that still stung low in the core of his heart. Burning memories of the lonely years without anyone that understood him, or even bothered trying to. They both had their eyes tightly shut, the only sense surrounding them both was the overwhelming feeling of being in each other's arms at last.
“Please tell me… how can I help? What happened?”
“Sherlock Holmes is a brilliant boy there’s no doubting that…. I just hope he will someday be a good one” Greg had shrugged.
Sherlock grinned, trying but failing to contain the immense joy he had by seeing that look on the Gryffindor’s face. He threw his arms over John again and held him tightly. His colossal relief was so immense it was as if the years he had not seen John were ones he had spent holding his breath. He was so overwhelmed, completely dizzy with it. How had he not remembered how blue John’s eyes were? Or how tanned his skin was? How his brow crinkled delicately when he laughed-
“Here… It’s black tea. I hope that’s alright. No sugar right?” Sherlock appeared into the living room again, arm reaching out to hand John a steaming cup of tea.
“CHRIST. Sherlock!” John stood up trying to see if there was any other way out of the room. He couldn’t see anything.
“I need to hear you say it love” John murmured, kissing the inside of his thigh and pulling it above his shoulder as he braced himself.
Sherlock snorted, rolling his eyes at John’s ridiculous dance, ignoring the weird lurch his heart made at John’s shirt riding up and revealing a sliver of tan skin on his flat abdomen. He looked away, clearing his throat.
“Yeah?”
“I mean… what are the chances of there being an infestation at Beauxbatons! That you finally get to come here!” John shook his head and stared at Sherlock as if still expecting him to disappear like a mirage.
“This is harder than I thought it would be”, John spoke softly, “I just want to go there with you” his gaze trailed down Sherlock’s body greedily.
The moment John had been waiting for what felt like an eternity had arrived. Maybe not THE moment but certainly one of the top ones.
how Sherlock felt. They would never recover.
“Absolutely. Let’s head to your gallery and astound others with how amazing you are okay?”
Judging by the way the blonde had reacted to him so far today he would say he would most likely not be against such behavior. Then again... was that all John wanted? Someone to… shag? They had never really gotten around to talk, being far too absorbed in a repeat performance the morning after, when Sherlock had wrapped his lips and tongue around John’s cock and…
Irene was, without a doubt, the hottest girl in the whole castle, with her dark long curls and her blood-red lips, but since Sherlock was not showing even the sign of interest in the conversation John was starting to feel better and was considering getting up from this ridiculous hiding spot and just tear Sherlock away from her and into the gardens around the lake where they would spend hours talking or just sitting together in comfortable silence. That was...until she whispered something in his ear, and he snapped his head towards her grey eyes wide, appraising and shocked and before John had blinked Irene was grinning triumphantly and they were walking out of the library together. John’s stomach instantly dropped in cold shock.
John had always been surrounded by many friends, finding social interactions an easy give and take he was familiar with. Plus, it drowned out the quiet of the nothingness at home. However, he’d never been one for actual... conversations? His friends at school only seemed interested in playing hide and seek and shooting at each other with their toy guns and usually, John was more than happy to oblige. But he’d spent all day talking and listening to Sherlock, learning about this new place and it’s rules and wonders and had found himself nothing but utterly captivated.
“Should we get the check?” John murmured.
There was no room for…
Time slowed as the familiar body of Sherlock Holmes fell through the door frame, all ruffled curls and frowning scowls scrunching up his face. He straightened up, still not tearing his gaze away from Professor Septima. And by
fault that they had lost contact and their friendship. Not to mention that he was back in their family now. He couldn't believe that Sherlock’s mother had taken him back after everything that he had done, because of how ingrained that asshole had implanted himself and his selfish ideas on that poor family.
“Go on then.”  He encourages.
“Yeah,” I sigh, “tired.”
Of course.  She is always welcome.
makes me feel sick.  Head hurts.  Light
I swallow and it hurts, my neck feels bruised inside and out.
“You deserve better.  Both of you.  I’m going to do better.”  He nods once to himself.  The decision is made.  I know his apology is genuine.  I know that once he sets his mind to something, he will follow it through.  We both know it takes more than a decision but that it is also where things begin.
“However you react, it’s fine.  We can stop any time.  Just don’t wait so long before you ask me to stop, tell me as soon as you are uncomfortable.”
His skin feels warm against my fingertips.  I fight to keep myself in the moment.  His hand pushes up my t-shirt as he traces ribs and scars with a delicate touch.  I feel a pleasant ripple beneath my skin.  My cock yearns to be touched in a way I thought it had forgotten.
For three nights I lay in bed waiting for him to come.  It is the same each night.  I make sure the lights are off and the drapes are drawn and that I am tucked up in bed like all the good boring people of London.  I want to get up and tinker with the experiment in the kitchen.  I don’t really need to do anything to keep the crystals growing.  I’m just bored with waiting, but I know if he is going to come after me, it has to look convincing, so I lay in bed waiting, with boredom grating against my nerves.
With a huff that I very much hope he hears I head to the kitchen to put the kettle on.
“Where were they?”  Mycroft asks.
“You should really try to get some sleep.  You must be exhausted.”
Now, I've been tinkering about in the background with a bunch of other stories.  There must be more than twenty unfinished works in my Sherlock file.  To help me get inspired to finish some I thought I'd ask what you want to read next (or at some time down the track)?
“Hearing me out.”
Of course, we have kept the rooms at Baker Street; it is far too valuable to have access to convenient lodging in London.  Plus, it will be perfect for Rosie next year.  She has plans to study medicine at UCL next year, it should only take her a few minutes to walk there from Baker Street.  I have a strong suspicion that rather than following in John’s footsteps, she will pursue Molly’s.  She has been like a surrogate mother to Rosie since the earliest days after Mary’s death.  Now they are even closer still, acting more like best friends than mother and daughter.  It is not unusual for Molly to travel out here so that they can spend hours shopping or going out to movies together.  Inevitably, they end up back at the cottage for dinner.  Usually, bringing with them a ridiculous dessert of some sort or another.
Then twenty minutes later
“We often find ourselves falling for people who are not easy to be with.”  She says with a kind smile.  “Have you argued in the past or is this something new.”
“Me too.” I cut him off, I don’t want to think about it either.  “Are you finished at Baker Street?  I want to get it cleaned up”
I slip out as quietly as I can.  He needs to rest, and I need to get to Greg’s office and give a statement before he has me arrested.
Thank you for being the ones to leave the kind words, the kudos and for lurking in the shadows.  This would not be as much fun without you.
“That was one of the first.  Bicycle chain.”  That one had hurt so much I gagged.
He scoffs.  Knowing that it is my way of agreeing.  Then he whispers, “please don’t let there be any more.”
Our sexual encounters have been limited.  And they have had varying degrees of success.  We are like two fumbling teenagers who don’t know what they are doing.  Mostly, I cannot calm the chaos in my mind and have to stop.  Then, I find myself frustrated at my lack of control.  John is excellent and always gives me the space that I need, but I can tell he is frustrated that he doesn’t know how to help me through it.  Surely, he must be sexually frustrated as well.
“Yes, very much.”
“Again, I just need to ask.  This is not an accusation.  Do you ever worry that you might harm your daughter?”
He doesn’t say anything.
“Who?  Which one?”  I can hear anger in John’s voice.  He hates the people who hurt me as much as I do, maybe more.  It is still raw for him.
“I can’t.” I shake my head.  Dammit, it bloody hurts.
I can hear John talking but he sounds far away, and the words don’t have any meaning.  I will my brain to come back online.  Then John is gone.  I roll on my side, still shivering, and curl up in a ball.
“You are a fool.  It already has.”  He tells me, and his words feel true.
“I stayed upstairs last night.”  I say.  “I slept late.”
“I’m telling you now.”  I roll my eyes.  “I was going to ring you when I got home, warn you to stay away.  I was planning to be home earlier, the flight got delayed.  Terrible weather.”
“Would you like me to return the favour?” I ask hopeful that he wants to continue.  Watching him come undone is such a rare pleasure.
From the top of the stairs I can hear the bath running.  At least that will warm him up.
“It’s fine.”  I say too quickly.  “We are both going to struggle with this, in our own way.”
how many there are.
“Does this feel the same?”  She asks in a gentle voice.
“I know Greg, it’s fine, really.”
All night these questions and concerns scrolled through my head and despite the hours I involuntarily committed to it, I have gained not a single answer.  All those sleepless hours have just allowed me to collate a list of worries that seem to be hellbent on pointlessly repeating through my brain.
“I know.”  He breathes into my ear.  His hands run up my thighs, ghost along my hips and across my stomach.  My skin ripples under the warm water.  I suck in a breath.  It sounds sharp and hollow, bouncing off the bathroom walls.
“You ok?  He asks.  Looking at me.  Scrutinising me.  “Bad dream?”
I wonder why John is here, not that I mind; it is always nice to have him around for a visit.  Rosie must still be at home with one of John’s team of babysitters, it is well and truly too quiet, and it is well past her bedtime.  Shame really, I could have done with some time playing with her or reading her a book.
Moving.  Rolling movement.  Strapped down.  Moving
The morning drags on and I don’t dare look at my phone.  I don’t want to see a message that says, ‘I don’t want to see you ever again.’  I couldn’t handle that.
Another one that I edited quite a lot, so all the mistakes are mine.
I answer his questions and by the time he is satisfied my eyelids are drooping.  I am unbelievably tired.
The scars are almost invisible these days.  They have faded to inconspicuousness much like the emotional ones.  They are still there.  If you know where to look.  If he is prepared to let you see.  He shows them to me and for that I feel humble and honoured.
His hands don’t falter at the scars though.  They carry on until they find a knot in the tight muscles.  Then he works at it until the knot crackles and fades beneath his firm touch.  Then he moves onto the next one.  Soon I feel heavy and relaxed.
“Is there anything that usually leads to you getting angry?”
The psychologist calls out to me in the waiting room.  She is a small woman with curly brown hair.  She introduces herself as Janette.
I wake up sitting upright and breathing hard.  My mind feels fuzzy.  I try to remember, what did I take?  How much?
I hold the open notebook out towards him, showing him the notes.  He is not at all interested in any of my scribbles about the moths.  He can, however, be convinced to take a bath with me, so all is not lost.  Once I am warm again, with him reclining against my chest, I even manage to short circuit another lecture on the dangers of having another bout of pneumonia.  All it takes to distract him is a writhing, leg shaking climax that I create for him with slow strokes of my slippery hands.  He offers to reciprocate but my enjoyment really lies in witnessing his own.  Now that he is quiet and satisfied, the warmth of the steamy room is making me dozy.  I suggest that I might nap for a while; being up all night has done me in.
“Ok, they can come out, wait here.”
He grabs my hand and holds me there.
I had no qualms about shooting the man who attacked Sherlock and I would do it again tonight if I have to but, Christ, I could do without the subsequent interrogation.
“My partner can be very trying.”
I have hardly slept for days, a week nearly, just dozing occasionally while I wait for him.  All his attacks have occurred after one am, he breaks in during the day, hides himself and then attacks once everyone is sound asleep.  There is no reason he will break that tradition if he comes here.  Plus, I am sure that I will notice the signs of his being here if he was here.  He might have been able to hide from them, but he won’t find it so easy if he comes here.
He squeezes my hand a little.  “Look at us, we’re a proper mess.”
I rub my face.  “I think I might have feelings for my friend, my guy friend.”
“Yes.”  My throat feels like it will lock up.
“Yeah it is, sorry to call you after so long.”  My voice sounds as shaky as I feel.
“Sherlock,” the woman asks, “have you ever dislocated your shoulder before?”
“Now, let’s make a plan, you mentioned you’d like to be better at regulating you anger, is that right?”
Of course, he asks a question rather than giving an explanation.  “Is Sherlock usually combative, under normal circumstances?”
Jesus, did he really need to say that.  I rub my face as the lift takes me down to the lobby, hoping that this all just goes away.
I cannot help but to smile a little as I ask playfully, “just quite, is that all?  Not very good looking or incredibly good looking or…”
I feel his chuckle against my back more than I hear it.  Slow feather light touches speed up my breathing.  The water feels hotter, but I know it’s my temperature that has changed.  I run my hand along the outer expanse of his long thighs, encouraging, coaxing, teasing.
“Sit down, I will grab your shampoo.”
He stops when he sees the letter and the photograph in my hands.  Without a word snatches it from my hand and calmly folds it back into the envelope and puts it back where I found it.  I flinch as he stabs the knife savagely back through it.
“All of it.”  I admit.  I wasn’t planning on getting into this, but it all just spills out.  “It’s complicated but we have known each other for a long time, and we have just decided to try to make a go of things.  It hasn’t been easy.  Yesterday I got mad; he thought I was going to hit him…  He thought that, because I have done it before.”
Stillness.  But still spinning.  Doors slamming.  Noise reverberates through my skull.  Mouth dry.  Throat feels tight.
Anyhoo,  It is a rare treat to interact with all you strangers on the other side of the internet.  I am loving all your beautiful comments.  They are my seven percent solution, truly addictive and a great buzz.
I sit up to hitch the leg of my pyjama pants up to show him the raised welts and deep notches where chunks were torn from my right leg.  They are by far the worst of the scars from Serbia.  “These were made with a pair of pliers.  Mycroft picked them from amongst a selection of other tools.  He was not expecting them to be used with such enthusiasm.”
I enter the room when I get no reply.  I look closely at his face.  He is still, his face is pale and motionless, but something flickers behind his eyes.  I’m not sure which is worse.  When he was agitated, it was like there was something of himself present, at least.  Now, despite being in possession of himself, it’s like he is not here at all.
can't be him.  He can’t be here.  If he was, he would never let them do
“Shit, sorry.”  John says.  I hear him but only faintly through my rising panic.  My throat feels like it is closing up.  I freeze.  I hear the shouts of men that are not here.
“I thought that was my job.”  He is standing now, the newspaper fluttering to the floor.  He is angry because he feels left out.  I look up at him from my chair.  I realise that I have hurt him, but I don’t know a way back from here.
I wake up heaving like a racehorse.  Teeth clenched. Muscles clenched.  Fists clenched.  John mumbles something; reaches out to me.  His hand ghosts across the scars Mary gifted me.  I push his hand away, but keep it gripped tightly in mine.
“I don’t know.  I just… I don’t know.”
“You cannot afford another concussion right now.  You’re still recovering from the last one.”  He rolls his eyes and I tell him to stay still.  “Why did you have to do that?  Why did you have to stir her up?”
As much as the injuries have taken their toll and as traumatic as the night-time attack had been, I get the feeling that these are not the sole causes of the distress.  Not even the primary cause.  Increasingly it seems that they are just the catalyst.
“Night, John,” I say, while I am still facing the mirror.  I see his reflection as he turns.  Emotions slide across his face.  He goes from quizzical to worried to disappointed all in a brief moment.
You asked and you received.  It won't be a regular thing, but you have all been so jolly nice that I couldn't help myself.
“Still.”  He whispers, his breath hot in my ear and I have to fight no to buck up into his fist.
The letter with the knife through it catches my eye.  It wasn’t there the other day and it was not among any of the other mail I have brought up.  Sherlock doesn’t bring the mail up.  The writing on the front of the envelope is messy, just Sherlock’s name and no address.  I wonder how it came to be here.
“I made sure he was locked up and uncomfortable for the rest of his life.”  Sherlock says simply.
Emotion creeps into my voice for the first time.
“My partner, he told me, I don’t think it is fair to go into details, but he recently told me that he has been through something really terrible.  It’s done him a lot of damage.  I think that has been weighing on me too.”  My voice shakes as I say this.
With a sigh, he relaxed back into the mattress, glad he’d put some pants on when he went to the loo late in the night when the reality of too many beers made itself known.  Then the exasperation crept in.  He was exasperated at Sherlock’s lack of boundaries.  Moments later he realised he was slightly too drunk to really care.  Then slightly worried.  Crossing boundaries was one thing but, this level of boundary hopping was out of the ordinary.
I wake up and I don’t remember where I am.  Why does my head hurt so much?  I bring my hands up to cover my eyes; the light from the doorway is too bright.  My shoulder screams.  I do too.  I remind myself that I’m not in Serbia anymore.  Mycroft helped me escape.  Was that yesterday or the day before?  I look for the American man in the Hawaiian shirt.  The doctor: the one Mycroft brought along instead of John.  What was his name?  Doc, how original.  I call out for him.  He must not be too far away.  He has barely left the room since I woke up.
“You mean he really is chubby?  I thought you were just being mean.”
Seeing him so unwell, grey and gasping, knowing how close he came to needing to go onto a respirator, had taken its toll on me.  On the second day of hospitalisation I had been so sure that he wasn’t going to make it out of there, that I went to our solicitor to make sure that his will was in order.
Irene looked startled “He kissed you? Then what’s the problem?” She hopped onto the table and sat across from him with her legs cross, her lips pulled up into a shocked and proud smile.
Oh god no.
“Hello, mummy. Yes, mummy… yes I know he’s very nice,
John would hastily comply, not willing to delve back into whatever had happened that night. It was a little murky in his mind. The hurt, the followed comfort and then Sherringford’s interruption, his anger. Anger at what? Sherlock? John didn’t understand. Had it been wrong to comfort Sherlock? Somehow… bad? But, why?
Not that he hadn’t wanted to, of course. In that moment John had not been able to think about anything other than pushing Sherlock against a wall and claiming his mouth for hours and hours on end. But Sherlock… had not kissed back. Truthfully John had only started kissing him but he had felt the suddenness of the tension in Sherlock’s body. Almost as if he had never been kissed before. And John had just thrown himself at him without any kind of permission on Sherlock’s part. John. His model. How inappropriate! He groaned, trying his best to remember the breathing pattern to slow down his heart rate.
Every second of the day replayed in his head in a loop. Objectively, Sherlock knew that his interaction with John had been nothing out of the ordinary for a first meeting. There had been nothing extraordinary about it. And yet, he could not stop thinking about him.
“Hi,” John finally said, his voice soft and gentle. “Glad you texted” he smiled, a little more like himself this time but still cautious.
“It’s okay mummy, and yes.” Sherlock answered, “But it's John. not Johnny. As I’ve said before” he added exasperatedly. From the corner of his eye, he could see John smirking good-naturedly. John himself was barely dressed more than Sherlock, the domesticity that had settled around them in these past months enveloping them.
“Oh!” John exclaimed. His eyes and smile widened. “Thank you so much!” he took the cane from Angelo’s extended hand.
John’s high laugh echoed through the staircase as they approached Sherlock’s flat, Sherlock’s rumbling chuckle right behind it.
He certainly didn’t feel like that now.
Sherlock smiled and burrowed into his mother’s embrace. Perhaps coming with Mycroft had been the best idea.
“Oh, yeah ‘m fine” John smiled
“Oh GOD. What-“ gasp “How did you- What did- oh”
“Well. I- I mean. I- “
As soon as the room was empty a heavy silence fell once more. John discretely put his robe back on and tied it carefully with the string, jumping off the platform with ease. Sherlock’s breath hitched as he heard John’s steps nearing his desk, not daring to look up.
“See, observe here” Sherlock was saying “John’s biceps are obviously larger than how you drew them here Paul!”
Sherlock laughed softly. “Okay. Alright. Let’s walk”.
John smiled predatorily. “Right. Fall
“He- uh. He’s the new model for my figure drawing class. I just happened to accompany him to his bus stop.” He answered, still looking into the depths of his steaming cup of tea instead of her.
“I’ll use your owl! That what we’ve done in the past!”
“Mrs Hudson” Sherlock interrupted her “Don’t you have some other thing to be attending to? Your herbal soothers maybe?” he deadpanned
“Sherlock? You alright?”
But aside from all that… John was also immensely relieved. Relieved that Sherlock was now here with him, safe in his arms. That they had finally spoken about all these things that should've been said so long ago. That Sherlock had not forgotten about him or abandoned him, that he no longer thought John had done those same things to him. He kissed Sherlock softly, tenderly, relishing on finally...
John seemed oblivious to the woman’s interest, or at least Sherlock hoped so. He was still talking rapidly, gesturing about something around himself and then pressing his hands to his chest as if talking about something emotional. She nodded, smile still perfectly intact and responded with equal enthusiasm, throwing in a wink in his direction and then reaching her hand out as if preparing to receive something. Sherlock’s heart was thumping rapidly in his chest, this time so forcefully and so uncomfortably… different to the nerves John usually sparked inside his body. His eyebrows rose slowly in alarm as the blonde handed her his cellphone. She took it with a smile and began typing something onto it, John peered onto the screen to observe.
“I was going to the loo, just needed a bit of a sit down on the way.  Got dizzy.”  I confess, embarrassed by this revelation.
I say it out loud.  I want to.  I want to scream for him.
Rosie has jam on her face when I pop back in to relieve Mrs Hudson from childcare duties.  She is a saint, that woman.
“What happened to ‘married to your work’?”  I ask, feeling a bit lighter.
But as time passes the thrill of solving cases diminishes.  Criminals become boring as their inability to do anything at all original seems to increase exponentially with every year.  The cases I would have once classed as a seven or even an eight, now fail to raise my heart rate.  Private clients still provide occasional thrills and Mycroft sends me something titillating every now and again.  Like that little exercise in America that ate up two years of our time, but mostly I am not as enthralled by the work as I used to be.
“I struggled so hard against the electric shocks that I shattered a molar.  I heard my wrist crack.  They kept going until I passed out.  At least that saved me from telling them something I shouldn’t have.”
“Just get in the bed, John?”  He says, but there is tension to his voice.  I suspect it is caused by uncertainty I am feeling.
“Yes, I think that would be helpful.”
“Greg, hi.  Sorry, I know its late, um early.”  I say into the phone.  “We are going to need you at Baker Street.”
He stirs pushing the blankets away and mumbles my name.
I take his hand and direct it to the little indentation below my collar bone.  His warm fingers manipulate the dimpled scar.
My breathing is a bit more controlled by the time the doctor comes in.  She is young and has two cats and a girlfriend she doesn’t get to see much because she works too many nights.
I get up immediately, feeling the thick tension in the room.  It makes me cringe.
“Oh,” he sighs, realising his mistake, then continues almost flippantly, “apparently, I don’t remember, but it would hardly surprise me if I did.  The thought of coming home to you was the only thing keeping me going.”
“Not much to say.  She died.  A bit over two years ago.”
I sit down across from John and take my violin out of its case as John reads the article.  Nothing in it is at all surprising.   Typically, the press had done a bland job of reporting all the basic information in a way that will sell papers and whip the public into indignant rage and horrible fear, all while telling them absolutely nothing of use.  The part that they glaringly omit is that the criminal breaks into the homes while the residents are out and hides in wait for them to go to sleep before he attacks them.  He terrorises his victims before murdering them, subduing them with blunt force trauma to the head before tying them up and torturing them.  They also have not mentioned that he sexually assaults most of the victims with an unknown weapon both before and after they are deceased.  The burglaries are a distraction.  They are clearly not his motivation.  All this is information that has been withheld from the press.  As was my continued involvement; I had been on the case since the beginning.  I had decided to leak my involvement to the press yesterday.
He gives me an odd look as he comes back in balancing the plates and cups.  “Yeah, you sent me a text.”
“They are my favourites.”  I say.
“Nope.  No screens, you need to rest.  I have a toothbrush and some pyjamas and a change of clothing for when you get discharged.”
London is largely populated by those who owe Sherlock favors. The roster of the beholden includes Maria Wiesner, Ph.D., the woman in charge of the London Zoo’s Blackburn Pavilion, where birds fly about in an ersatz but pleasant rainforest and cloud forest –
It can’t.
“Where — ”
Which reminds him that Sherlock had let them into their room, before, and that he isn’t quite sure where he put his key card. He pats down every pocket, pats them all down again, digs to the bottom seam and corners of each one, even of the bloody coin pocket of his bloody trousers which is too small to possibly fit a key card, even if you folded said key card into fourths which you can’t do, God damn it, and finally has to concede that the bloody fucking thing has vanished.
“Adelbert Gruner paid you attention, then.”
Sherlock says, “ — not?”
John says, not under his breath; Sherlock shrugs.
gives up trying to wring any further headlines from the case.
“But I’m not sure he’s happy.” The tired mother shows the second-youngest, the middle, and the two oldest Sherlock’s brochure, with its color photos taken from the lovebird rescue group’s files. Lovebirds make merry in trees, on perches, on wooden ladders, in the air. Lovebirds chew sticks. Lovebirds roll balls along the aviary floor. “Look at the birds in these pictures, and look at Beakley. What do you think?”
You had to admire Jim, really. He knew how to suspend a person exactly between the terrified urge toward self-preservation, on one side, and the crawling, nagging, self-loathing hunger to escape by whatever means were available, on the other. On Sunday Sherlock’s heroin ration appeared as usual and he reminded himself that if he wasn’t getting junk sick every time he went six hours without a fix that would make one less hold Jim had over him. One less puppet wire.
“No, Mr. Holmes, I don’t. — You understand, I can tell how it is with you and Dr. Watson —”
A little of the delight had withdrawn from the stranger’s expression. (Why had there been delight, why was John sorry to see it go?) The stranger said: “You don’t look envious in the least, to begin with. And you stand like a soldier — but no, that’s not it. Not every soldier’s suited to that life. You
The thought discomfited him.
ugh. Time to lose that colorful sobriquet.
Wiggins held up his right hand and turned it side to side, showing the splints from all angles. “You see that, yeah? That was a warning, and I did not like the receiving of it. I sell to you, they come back and take these off altogether. Not meaning the splints. So, what I said: Fuck off out of here.”
Delia Smithson was a foretaste of . . . at first, nothing much. Days upon days passed, which Sherlock spent almost alone — food and heroin delivery apart; on three occasions Jim paid a call. Sherlock got used to that, more or less, meaning that as long as Jim didn’t show him any videos or hint at feeling dissatisfaction with Sherlock’s job performance, Sherlock could keep his breathing even and would sweat only a little, under his arms and behind his knees. Meanwhile he had hours and hours to spend on the Internet, absorbing the lessons of famous psychics and con artists before him. Jim applauded, the evening when Sherlock proposed putting a donation box in the waiting room, labeled with the name of a charity funding dream trips for fatally ill children with winsome expressions, these children being also depicted on the sides of the box. “Ooh, that’s not bad, Will!” Jim said. “Not bad at all,” and not only a box but some brochures and pre-addressed envelopes, for cheques, appeared with the food delivery the next day. Naturally there was also a web address, with a button for donations by credit card. Sherlock looked at this, and then realized he had been looking at it long enough that Jim might take note of his looking and draw a potentially dangerous conclusion, so he closed the tab and returned to his studies.
Look back, and be transubstantiated into a pillar of salt.
By now, of course, I knew to expect some jape or other, to be delivered by Wiggins on Watson’s behalf with the attendant disingenuous professions of ignorance. Indeed, just after breakfast my reading of Hans Goldschmidt’s paper upon the thermite reaction was interrupted by that young reprobate, in possession of a pair of bellows.
But it is barren. There is no cuttlefish. There is no bell to ring. There is no climbing chain or food-puzzle toy. There is not even a mirror. There is a perch, and there is a bowl of food, and there is a bowl of fresh water. Sherlock wishes he could unmake his promise not to steal Beakley, a winged sociable creature of trees and plains who exists in a desert of boredom. Beakley would probably become a cocaine addict at once if given the opportunity. His feathers are shabby and all in all he looks much the way John’s voice sounded when he told the story.
— begins —
“Good,” Sherlock said. He shot his cuffs and glanced toward the door.
He gently pushes me on to my back.  He lowers my pants until they are down my thighs.  I lift my hips to help him.  I suck in a breath as my erection is freed from the confines of my pants.  He rubs both his hot palms up my thighs and encircles my erection.  His touch is electric.  His movements practiced but so different from my own.  I am paralysed by pleasure and by other emotions that I push away.
It scares the hell out of me.
“When did you sleep last?”
I am surprised to see it is a bit after six when John come in juggling Rosie, a nappy bag and a package of fish and chips.  I hadn’t realised it was so late.
“I don’t care about your bloody Hannibal moths.  Look at the state of you.”  I say, half to wind him up and half out of exasperation.  The result is that he then proceeds to tell me all the reasons why his precious moths have nothing to do with any block buster movies and why they are so incredible.
I doze for the ten-minute reprieve that the snooze button allows me.  Warm and comfortable.
I take a break for morning tea.  I’m not hungry, I just need a minute.  I sit on the back step at my clinic in the weak sunshine.  I finally take out my phone bracing myself for the message.
My relief is palpable.  I reply with a time frame and a wilted sigh.  It is as if the stress of wondering was all that was keeping me inflated.
I pause to consider this.  “I don’t know really, I guess being ignored.  That is what set me off yesterday.”
“Stop this now.”  Mycroft intervenes.  “Doctor Pawson, a word with you, outside, now.”
He sounds frustrated when he replies.  “When exactly?  When you were trying to cope with your wife’s secrets?  Or when I was assigned to a suicide mission?  Or when you had a newborn?  Or when I got Mary killed?  When I drugged myself up to the eyeballs?  Or, when my homicidal sister resurfaced to terrorise us?  There was never a good time.”
“The one that raped me.”
He looks up at me for a second, and then speaks to the floor.  “My hands are shaking too much.  I can’t, wanted to, but I can’t get a vein.”
He shakes his head.  I can see him fighting some internal battle.
It had taken weeks of antibiotics and pleural drains and he had still come away a shadow of what he had been before.  He’d coughed so much he had broken two ribs, he had lost ten kilos and he had barely been able to stand up without assistance.  It was like watching a skeleton mope around Baker Street.
“She said ‘the little one is quite good looking; I’d have a crack at him myself if he wasn’t so busy bumming the freak.’  Even Donovan had the respect to look guilty.”  He voice is bitter and flat as he tells me.
He looks reluctant but agrees.  I am glad of the privacy.  I can feel composure unravelling like a dropped ribbon.  I don’t even know why I feel so stressed.
“Did you both engage in these fights?”
“That’s not what brings you here today, though, is it, John?  Not directly anyway.”  Janette says.  “Why don’t you tell me why you’ve come to see me?”
“Why?”  He looks desperately uncomfortable.
I follow John, as if on auto pilot.  I assume that he will lead me to the couch again, but he goes out the kitchen door that leads to the landing.  Through the fog in my brain I realise that he means for me to sleep in his room.  I am too tired, too emotionally drained, to question his wisdom, so I just follow him up the stairs.
Sherlock put a hand to his face; covered his eyes.  “Smith.”
“He probably won’t come here, Sherlock.”  John says, as he contemplates it.  “He never targets apartments, only homes and people with much more money.”
John swears loudly.  Rosie wails louder still.
I try, I really do; it’s boring but it’s not even the boredom that gets to me.  Whenever it has a chance my mind wonders to places that I really don’t want it to go.
When I stop shaking and start thinking again, he asks me what happened.
Lestrade’s and poor John’s lives too.
“Nothing.”  I concede as my hips jerk involuntarily, seeking friction, touch, pleasure.  The tip of my cock breaches the surface of the water.  The contrast of the warm water, then cold air, then warm water again it beautifully alarming.
It takes me minutes to catch my breath.
He indulges me and my body pumps pre come in response.  Both his hands pump my cock of three or four divine strokes, root to tip.
“I know.”  John agrees.  “She liked you, you know?”
John rolls his eyes at me.  “I’ll help you wash the bad bits out.  Come on.”
“Squeeze my hand.”  I tell him, putting my free hand, the one not holding the towel to his bleeding scalp, against his clammy palm.  It takes him a few moments for him to rally his energy and focus toward the task, but he manages a feeble grip.  “Ok, you can let go now.”
How will work out though?  How can it possibly work out?  I have no idea what I am doing.  I have no idea how to be in love with another person after Mary, and I especially have no idea how to be in love with another guy.  I have no idea how to raise a child.  I have no idea how to raise a child alone, or in a relationship.  I have no idea how to redesign my identity.   I have no idea how to look after someone who has faced the kinds of trauma that Sherlock has.  I have no idea how to be with him, but worst of all I have no idea how to be without him.
“It was unseasonably warm last night.”  He argues.
Heads up for a shift in perspective.  It is John's turn to tell the story for a while.
The scent of sex meets my nostrils.  A breath shudders out of me.  I tense.  John notices.  I grip his shirt.
“Are you ok?  He asks me in a low voice.
“Ok good, I’ll send you a phone number.  They do good work there; I send a lot of my rehab patients to them, the ones with anger issues.  Call them John.  Do what they say, commit to it.  He sounds like he is worth it.”
“What are some of the things you have argued about?”
I haven’t spoken about the details of what happened to me in Serbia.  I know that if I tell him what I cannot face, the implications of what I was subjected to will be clear to him.
I’m miserable by the time we arrive home.  Irritable too; spending the better part of two days in hospital can have that effect.  The cab ride had seemed longer than it should have.  The cabbie’s radio blaring Bollywood music and the sunlight splintering off the scratched windshield have done nothing for the splitting headache that just will not go away.
Another wave
“Fifteen.”  Sherlock says.  He voice is a little clearer now.
“Yes.  Sherlock.” Mycroft says, in a relieved voice.  “How many times was she stabbed?”
“Sherlock.  Open your eyes.”  I say loudly.  He ignores me.  I am certain he has heard.  “I need you, for once in your life, to follow my instructions for just a minute.  Open your eyes”
“I knew something had happened while you were gone, something serious.  You were different.  Quieter.  Less self-confident.  Sadder.  I was so caught up in my life.  I should have asked you, but there was a part of me that really didn’t want to know.  I was scared to know what it was.”  I am rambling; the words gush out faster than my brain can work.  Then I realise.  My heart sinks.  And a moment ago I didn’t think it could get any lower.  “Oh God.  I hit you.  Oh, no.  I’m awful.  I was so angry when you turned up at the restaurant.  You tried to tell me why and I wouldn’t listen.”
John is there moments later.  This tells me everything I need to know about how loud I was.
Horrified, I step away from John, from the fridge.  I lean forward to cough; I gag once before I can pull myself together.
“You can make more.”  John told him with a grimace.  The very thought of anything alcoholic made him feel queasy.  Sherlock was just trying to distract him though.  Trying to keep him from asking about the nightmare.  “You can tell me.  If something is bothering you.”
“Text me later when you decide.”  He says.  “Drink some water today.  Dehydration won’t help your head any.”
But he doesn’t.  He would never admit it, but I think it comforts him to have me here while he is feeling so dreadful.
“Not all that much.  It is just release.  I find it hard to stay in the moment, especially since...”  I admit, hot with the embarrassment of these revelations.
Rosie is calling “hi, hi, hi, hi” in a shrill voice.  She wants Sherlock to pick her up.
“The ambulance is here.  These guys will look after you now.”  I tell him.
“What about, you know, by yourself?”
He leads me into the kitchen and pulls a chair up to the sink.  The legs scrape on the floor and I wince at the sound.
“It was nearly always perfect.”  Janette says with a soft smile.  “You looked sad when you spoke about your wife.  Do you want to talk about that?”
“Do that again.”
He wraps his hands around mine.  I realise that I am still holding the damp towel.
I am surprised how secure I feel beneath him as if under the protection of a weighted blanket.  He works his pants down too.  His cock springs free and bobs up against his belly.  He gently guides my hand towards him.  He groans as I cup his balls, rolling them.  Emboldened by my own arousal.
“John?  John?”
The water is warm, and surprisingly comfortable.  We breathe in sync with one another.  That is how it feels now, and has for a long time, like we are in sync.
It is the first time that I have considered anything beyond the next few moments.
“I love you.”  He breathes into my ear as he works me through the paroxysm of ecstasy, prolonging it.
maybe.  They keep jostling me.  Touching me.  I try
“When was that?  She asks.
It's coming towards the end and I am already feeling conflicted about that.  Thanks for taking this journey with me.  I'll miss this when it's over.
John comes back in with the shampoo and a towel.  I tip my head back over the sink as best I can.  The cupboard above has nothing to hold my attention, but I try to focus on it.
“Don’t be stupid.  It was just a dream.  I don’t believe any of the things my brain cooks up to torment me.”  It doesn’t stop them from feeling real though.  I should be used to this by now.
“No, only at home really.”
“Jesus.”  John mutters.  “How are you still alive?”
I see the exact moment realisation dawns on him.
“I’ll make sure he comes by in a few days.”
Looking out at the sea.  Watching the foaming white waves roll in.  With the cold wind in my face and John’s hand warm within my own.  This is where I am at my most content.  Knowing that all the sacrifices I have made are all worth it.  I am able to recognise the gifts I have been given.  So many second chances.  The chance to watch Rosie blossom into a strong capable young lady.  So many thrilling chases.  So many good friends.  But the biggest, grandest gift of all is that I am loved by the man that I love more than anything in this world.
