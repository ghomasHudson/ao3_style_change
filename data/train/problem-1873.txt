"No."
"Guilty~~!" He shouts. "It's both. Was it that noticeable?"
"Come now, Sherlock. Eating is important~." Her arm waves the apple in front of me, I just grab my cigarette out my mouth and blow out some smoke.
"It is. What happened, I must've drank too much please, explain what happened. My memory can only serve me to a certain extent... I can remember faintly, having some food with you and judging by the smell in the kitchen, it was noodles. Also, there is some whiskey on the counter, almost empty. I must've eaten in the lounge because that is where my bowl remained. So, enlighten me."
"Sure, see you later." This is unbearably uncomfortable! I need some kind of help but, how?! This never happened before. Fucking, Moriarty! I exit quickly, running back home. Quick, run home, I need to find help. Maybe John would know what to do. I eventually, arrive home. I stumble on my keys while trying to unlock the door. I race up the stairs and enter the flat, shutting the door behind me. "John?" I call.
"What you need to do, is to... cause friction on your penis... and keep the contact up until, you feel close to coming and eventually, do so."
"Say hello, greet her." He hisses. I grab John by his collar and pull him towards me so my mouth is next to his ear.
"Ha. Seriously, what did you say?"
"No one of you concern, Watson." I grumble. John just shakes his head and goes back to reading his paper. Another set of footsteps come up the stairs, different, unsure and fumbling. That's him. Bill Wiggins. He opens the door and enters, he's a tall kid, same height as me but, he looks scrappy and dirty. He's wearing a grey hoody, dark blue top, grey sweatpants and a pair of whit socks and black trainers, that look battered and worn out.
"We need to stop this, Sherlock." I whisper.
do you know my name?!" I snap, walking toward him until, I'm face to face with him. Well, chin to face, he's slightly taller which doesn't make me look intimidating to him at all. He sighs.
"Ok, so, how do I lead to that from friction?"
"I see you've read the note?" Mycroft responded, as I scoffed.
"We'll see..." I smile shutting the bathroom door. Time for some best friend fun.
"... My turn to ask you a question; you promised."
"Liar."
"WHAT THE FUCK!!!??" I shout. It wakes up John who looks at me worriedly.
"Have you eaten, Watson?" I say more sternly.
"W-who are y-you and- and why have you been f-f-following me and my husband?" He stutters. I smile with satisfaction with his answer.
"What a waste of a question, you could've asked anything and you chose that?"
"Little brother, stop thinking about these things. I'm fine, you're fine, Mother's fine, Father's fine. We're all fine."
"Mycroft, please don't-."
"I don't?" My hand rubs on my lips and I look at it, red. Red lipstick. The girl.
"I was supposed to help you..." He mumbles sleepily.
"Have a guess, Watson. Your Father's a doctor, right. And you're taking all the science at school, deduce~~!"
"Hehe... why- why are you crying, John?" He laughs.
"It's a simple question, just answer it and then, you can ask me a question."
"God- ah... Sherlock, please! Please, I need you, please!" He pleads, I kiss his forehead and chuckle.
"You can't be serious." He slows down laughing.
"H-hello, Miss. I-I'm John, John Watson." John stutters.
a bit funny though...
"I'm not like you, Sherlock, I cannot deduce."
"What about my
"Oh..."
No reply.
"Because... you're a fucking asshole, Sherlock!" I shout before, I throw myself towards him and hug him. "And that's why I can't lose you! Why, Sherlock... Why do you do this?!" I plead. He doesn't respond, his arms don't move from his sides.
"licence, please." And just like that, I walk out the shop with the whiskey and stationary. I make my way back to the flat. Eventually, I arrive back at 221b. I slam the door behind me and I head up the stairs. I enter the flat and I check the clock, 7:58. John is in his chair eating instant noodles.
"Ok, think of it like this then. What if John loves you?"
"And what is that?"
"Because, Sherlock! I care! I'm worried, I'm scared, I'm- I'm so confused!" He shouts back at me. I rub the bridge of my nose and sigh aloud.
"Nice to meet you, Bill." He replies suspiciously.
"Brilliant, do you reckon Moriarty will be at school?"
"I did this mainly to gain the information needed, which I've collected effortlessly. However, if you would like me to help you, I'm happy to do so." He sounds bored, almost as if I was no pleasure what so ever. How dare he think I am disappointing, he thinks I'm not man enough! I shove him on his back and I pin him down.
"Uh, asleep."
"What did you say?"
just happened?!" I pant, looking at the oddly calm boy.
"Nope." I put my coat on.
"So... what you're saying is, you know that he has no feelings for you romantically but, you leave out your own feelings?"
"No, you're going to have a nap plus, it gives me time to take a rest as well. If you don't rest, I won't and you always go one about how I need to take a break."
"Do I look like I'm joking?"
glad you arrived. It's very touching." He smiles sincerely.
"You're taking drugs...?" My throat is dry. Please say no, drinking is enough, smoking is a step further across the line, cutting is awful, abuse is horrific, not drugs too... please let me be wrong. His face lights up.
"Do you want me to make you something?"
Really, it is. Now, without further a due, see. You. Later~." I salute, walking away to my left but, to be stopped by the strong looking boy stops me.
"Give me a minute." I walk to the fridge, I take out the whiskey and I grab a glass. I return back to John and his eyes widened. "I bought this as well."
"How about deductions?" I smile. "A pound bets I can win~." A large grin on my face forms as does one on his face.
"Just sit on the bloody bed!" He snaps at me. Looking at him, I comply sitting on the edge of the bed. He goes in between my legs and starts scrubbing at the patch of tea. I look down at him, his dirty blond hair looks more soft up close than from a distance, it almost makes me want to touch it. His slightly tanned skin looks so soft yet rough on his hands, cheeks, neck and some on his forearm of his left arm from, what appears, to be cuts and bruises from where his bullies beat him up. Something about seeing those inflicted marks sets off pangs of anger. On top of that anger, there's an unknown, tight feeling in my chest that feels like it's rising to my throat, almost suffocating me. I just cough a bit to try and get rid of it, it helps slightly but, not for long as John accidently brushes off my inner leg near... near my...my...
"Ah, the news paper, mind if I have a look?"
"Yes. Like, no signs of love affection if we are in a public place. We, more like you, can have relationships with other people without either of us being jealous. No hard feelings if we are unable to actually go out. And finally, we keep doing what we did today because honestly, I thoroughly enjoy seeing all of your beautiful body and I do find your moans delightful and there is more to your body I wish to look at and try."
"W-what are you doing?" I demand an answer. He just shushes me and tells me to hold still once again, I do as told and keep still. He curves around me and again, meeting me back into the same stance as he was before. Then he puts a hand on my shoulder, tightening his grip slightly and staring intently at it. He then does the same with his other hand but, this one is on my right, hand, shoulder. His hands slowly drift down my arm, slowly, slowly. I just look at him confused at how intently he's looking at his hands move. My face goes warm as his hands reach mine, he lifts them up to his face height. Shortly, after examining them, he puts my left arm down and keeps my right hand, holding my arm with his left hand. Slowly, his right hand goes up and he intertwines his fingers with mine. His hands are cold and thin but, yet, I like... it, how he holds my hand. My face is clearly red and confused. He looks away from mine and his hands to look at me. God, his eyes look dark even though, his eyes are usually a pale blue, they look distant. To stop myself from getting redder I look away from him at our hands, this must be a dream, what is he doing? This isn't Sherlock. It can't be, he must be really drunk, too drunk, too know what he's doing. I look at his hand when, something catches my eye, his sleeve is slightly rolled up and I can see something, it looks like a cut or scar or something. My curiosity gets the best of me so, I roll his sleeve the rest of the way up. What I see is shocking. I look at him then back down at his arm then, back to him.
"What did he want; you never talk to him unless it's imperative."
"Female." Agitation showing in his voice.
"Nothing of importance, my dear Watson. Let's go to my locker."
"You not dying any time soon, not while you're going to attend it."
"6:49. We should get our things ready, just pack the essentials and anything you want to occupy you. This includes school bag, books, pencil case etc." He lists monotonously. I let out a long groan and move my fingers and my thumb up and down mockingly.
"John~~~!!!"
"Because I don't want to. I don't want to be explaining sex with my roommate."
"Just give his phone back." He walks over to me.
"Go on then, humour me." He lies his head down on John's shoulder.
"I'm joking, Watson!" I call from the kitchen. My phone if flashing, again. Moriarty.
"HAHahahaha! Busy last night were you, Little Brother!? HAgahahahah, since when do you give into sentiment?!" He roars. I just sigh and put my head into my hands, not in embarrassment but, in pity for John, it
"Sister!" I shout whispering to myself in disappointment. "Wait so, she's...?"
"Love you too, John." I get through the other drink. Four!
"Naturally. We have to pack some clothes and essentials so, we are ready to go to stay with... uh... Mrs Hulson?"
"He came back drunk."
"I'll explain later."
"Just do it, it won't take a lot of effort, it's only an hour session."
"I'm so sorry, John. I didn't know this would happen."
"You wanted to stop? Were you thinking of Johnny? I bet you feel so bad for getting hard because of me and losing your first kiss to me and not John." He chuckles breathlessly. I calm my breathing down. Maybe, John would look as much of a mess, if I were to kiss him, as Moriarty looks now. Imagine that, John sweaty, panting, wanting, needing. Nggg! What is that feeling?! … and … that's new... "I would say that I should get going however, leaving you in this state wouldn't be very kind, would it?" He looks down in-between my legs at a thing sticking up from my trousers.
"John... you told me that I held your hand last night after, I rubbed your shoulders and arms." He shuffles nervously.
"Whoa! What the hel- mphmmm?!" I've just been grabbed and shoved against the inside of the school wall, they're behind me and they've put their hand over my mouth, holding me so I can't move.
There's a phone number underneath and the letter ends with:
just stares at me the whole time, like she's looking through me. I stand up and walk away.
"Hi~~. Fancy seeing you here, Sherly." The well dressed boy cooed. I stay silent. "Oh? Is little, Sherlock nervous? Did you miss me, while I was gone?" I cough, clearing my throat, standing up. Analysing the guard and where his organs are placed I try a figure out a plan of action. Distract Moriarty, strike legs to trip him up, gives me time to take out the guard. He would start attacking, lunges forward,
"Do you need the sharpener by any chance?"
I turn my phone off. Why would she want me to have dinner with her, she's being stupid. Sentiment doesn't show someone is strong, it only heightens their weakness and insecurities. It is only ever found on the losing side of things. The kettle clicks done and the water is left boiling. I'll make one for John as well, he'll be up soon anyway.
"Since the day you were born, Sherlock. You say you aren't human and you don't have feelings but, in fact you do. Whether you like it or not."
"Thank you." He sits down in John's chair.
"Hold that thought, Watson. I just need to take care of something." I disrupt him midsentence.
"What is it then? Why're you laughing?" He asks, stopping giggling.
We walk outside together and John is talking to me about what happened in his maths lesson. I, obviously, don't listen because my mind is set on having another cigarette, I'm bored... it's boring here, nothing interesting is happening! I need excitement!
"Why, what?" I ask irritably.
"You just became a little drunk, that's all."
"I'm not being childish! John is apart of the equation with my addictions, he carries that on his back as well as me!"
"Tea?"
"... because I'm a ... hehe... a mess..." His voice cracks and I feel him break down on my shoulder, crying. Then, I feel something warm on my back... Sherlock's arms... I squeeze him tighter and as does he.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Excuse me?" He chokes on his cereal slightly and looks at me peeved, wiping a splatter of milk off his chin with a napkin.
"Wiggins. How are you?" I ask stopping pacing.
"Yeah?" He asks, grabbing his underwear.
"Sherlock..." I say calmly.
"Woah- ok, what's wrong? Did something go wrong?" He turns to look at me.
"Are you ok, Sherlock?" John asks taking his own blazer.
"So, you set the alarm for... 6 o'clock?!" I huff pulling up my trousers.
"Husband."
"Seems, then, the thing that has been muted is slowly turning up."
? They aren't useful and irrelevant in helping with my school work, why listen to something that has already been muted?" I begin making my tea.
"I mean it, John. It's not ok, I know it's not ok. I'm sorry I've bought you down with me. However, even though things aren't ok, doesn't mean you don't make them like that, in fact, you make things better. Now, can you eat?" I ask.
"Why do you keep obeying them, Mycroft?"
"What kind of friends do that?"
"What do you mean? I don't understand, Sherlock, explain."
"No. I'm putting my foot down, John, I'll wake you up, I promise. Do it for me... please..." I hear him sigh.
"Go ahead but, you really don't have to." I lick my finger and I lick off, it taste sweet and salty but, nice. It tastes of John and that's why I love it. I lick the rest of it off yet, I crave for more. John tries to sit up but, I push him back down again. "What are you doing Sherlock?" I pull his pants off.
." Mycroft looks at me with his eyebrows raised.
"What did he ask?" I sit in my chair.
"I know him better than anyone else... I've known him long enough. Breakfast?"
I grunt and storm to him, standing in front of him.
"Go on, some time today would be good."
"You never gave me chance to say this but, you're wrong. I have a sister, not brother."
"Hello, John." It is awkward.
"What?"
"Not without you." He chuckles. I push him away and I look down to check my trousers... shit. Hold on- he's the same. No, don't get distracted. Footsteps. Who's footsteps? Shit, ah, what do I do?!
"... W-what-what the
"'Who doesn't?'" He laughs again.
"... This isn't you Sherlock." He leans his head and rests it on my shoulder and mumbles into my ear.
"What is it, Sherlock?" John asks. I just shake my head putting the apple back into the bag, I throw it in the bin.
"I'm not joking."
"I'll be fine, Sherlock." He groans into my shoulder.
"You're drunk."
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way. Thank you, though, for caring."
"Thank you, Sherlock." John stutters into my neck, he seems really worked up, maybe this meant a lot to him... Feeling his breath on my neck makes me feel weird again but, this time it's more like a... fuzzy feeling. I can't describe it however, it feels... nice...
I reply to the message.
I cringe at the note and open the fridge with disgust. After I poured the milk into the bowl of cereal, I return it back to the fridge, ripping the post-it off it and returned with it and the bowl back to the table.
"... Apparently so." I reply bluntly.
"You had a friend round?" He looks at the tea.
"Either way, it will be me, who will be putting you there."
"Aww this is touching. Expect to hear from me, Sherlock. You have my number, you know who to call. Just know that this game must end some time and I will be the one putting you in check mate. I better be off then. See you, later~~!" He walks past me and knocks a tune on the door and it is unlocked. John and I are left alone. John falls to the floor and lays on his back.
"I don't have to justify my actions to you, Watson! Leave me to my own devices, I know what I'm doing and I know why I a doing it so, why do you need to know?!" I snap.
"You only say my first name when you're telling the truth or being serious with me."
"Hey. What wakes you up so early?" He asks, rubbing his eyes.
"Good night, Mycroft." He walks away and I hear the door shut and the foot steps descending down the stairs.
"Just to the park and maybe we'll get a drink or something at the off-licence."
"But Sherlock-"
"Cross my heart." The room goes silent, me and john still embraced. I shift my head a bit to try and look at him. He's asleep, I knew he was tired, probably due to school and looking after me. I shuffle over to the edge of the bed to retrieve the duvet and I lay down slowly, aligning my head with the pillow, John, still on my chest. I manage to lie down and lay the covers on top of us and I relax. Finally, my back won't kill me anymore, I might as well go on my phone for a bit before I rest also. I grab my phone out my trouser pocket and I turn it on, a message pops up on the home page, as I begin to type the password. As soon as I enter my phone, I open up my messages and click on the number.
"Bullshit." I laugh. "What did you say John."
"No, Sherlock, my answer is no. I can't. You need to sleep."
"I can agree with all of them, if you can."
"You're such a hypocrite." I chuckle dryly.
John explains to me and Mycroft the situation of last night's events, apparently I was drunk, high and I smoked. I admit having a cigarette or 2 and then having a few pints then, nothing. I honestly have no recollection of what happened. I also, apparently, was acting really weird and when John took me to his bedroom, as mine was locked and I had lost the key, I asked him to stay with me, I begged him. ME. BEGGING. That's new even for me.
"How are things with Lestrade?"
"Awwww, John, you jealous I wasn't with youuuuu~~~." The drunk boy drawls. I sigh and shake my head.
"Why would it matter?"
"I know just the amount it will take until I will forget tomorrow. 4- 5 glasses. So, begin." I pour my first glass full and I swallow half of it down. "Wow, good stuff. Come on spit it out." I drink the rest of the glass and I pour another one.
"No- I didn't- I slipped up on my words." I inhale deeply and I get up, slamming my noodles on the table.
"No, we haven't fallen out, he's just... out with another friend. That doesn't mean we aren't going either."
"Give it!" I shout, pulling it towards me. He hugs it back to his chest and shouts back at me.
"I know, I know."
is he packing more than just a pistol." He edges closer to John, breathing over his shoulder next to his cheek. "Do you get him to beg John? Or is it the other way round, does he get you on all fours~?"
"How- how do you know my name?" He rolls his eyes at my comment and carries on, attempting, to tie his tie up.
"Oh, Sherlock, you're being childish, this is a matter your addictions and it is your problem alone." Mycroft hisses.
"What?"
"Tomorrow? The day after? I don't know just, not now..."
"Maybe a restraining order, might suffice?"
"Sherlock, keep your clothes on." Mycroft groans.
"No, of course I don't."
"It's up to you."
"You're missing what the point of the question, what if he does love you?"
Sorry this chapter is short the next one will be longer it just really early and I wanted to get this done.
"Does that stop you from drinking and taking drugs?"
"Kind of, yes, a bit."
John and I haven't spoken after that night, it's been 2 days. The only point we've spoken was when I asked him if he wanted tea and then, he only gave me a hum in approval. I haven't seen Moriarty at school since, either, he's up to something and that has to be my main priority at the moment, not the social side of things, I must stay on track and in control.
"What is it, Sherlock?"
"Because... he knows that you are important to me... he knows you are my weak point..."
"I made you some as well, they're in the microwave. I had to move some eyes out of there but, I put them in the fridge for you." How will I get around this? Think. Ok, to avoid being suspicious, I'm going to have to eat the noodles and then, I can retire to my room. I keep the alcohol hidden behind my back. "What did you get?"
"What do you want?" Damn his height, why is it he gets to be 5"5 and I have to be 5"2... it's not fair.
"The problem is, that's not now." I feel something rising in my trousers.
"I'm arranging for your therapy again, Sherlock. You may have stopped from when we left but, you're starting again whether you like it or not. No protests, no whining, you are going, get changed. John speak to me at school later. Goodbye." He leaves before either of our responses. John gets changed in silence, he seems to feel tense. I go to ask him if he's ok but, he speaks before me.
"Not at all, I'm fine."
John, Mycroft and I walk back from school together. We keep in silence for the most time, there's some idle chit-chat here and there from John talking about what happened in what lesson.
"Oh get over yourself, John! Just look for god sake!" I snap. His eyes drop to my trousers and immediately chokes back a laugh.
"And why is that?"
"Good, let's get ready then." I smile. He smiles back in confusion and walks away. My smile drains away and I sigh.
"Because you made yourself significant! You made yourself relevant and worth my protection!"
"Where you going, Sherlock?" John shouts.
"If I hadn't of helped him, where do you think he would be now?" I look down to the floor.
It has been a month since me and John had attended the same school together and lived in the same house. So far I've met some people, some I can tolerate others, I despise. On my good list I have Molly Hooper, a girl in all of my science classes, she isn't the most good at conversations however, I have no place to talk in that area. Then, I have Lestrade, he's a strong minded fellow, not really at my level of intelligence but, still a good speaker at that, he's in my form room, English class and one of my science classes; Physics. Stamford as well, I don't talk to him often but, he's a good source for information as he's more of a background character who can slip around easily, getting useful information. To finish off the list, there is, of course, John. I've learned a lot about John, not just his past or his everyday routine but, his personality. It is compelling and interesting. His independent vibe, the strong, self assured stance, even though at times he can be very clueless and a fumbling idiot, he could actually come into use some time, some day.
"Good, I worry about him... constantly. Come on, Sherlock, get into bed." He grabs the drunk boy's hand and lowers him down. He picks the covers up for Sherlock and he then places the sheet on top of him. And just like that Sherlock settles down to sleep.
"John... p-please stay. I need you here, I won't be able to sleep without you." His voice becomes stern and mellow with disappointment. "Please." He begs. I can't say no, I'll feel bad plus just sleeping next to him can't hurt... right? It doesn't make me gay, does it? No. No it doesn't.
"Hehe, well, I'll fix it." He starts doing my tie up and pats it when he's finished. "There. Much better." He smiles.
"God, you're beautiful, John. You're perfect." I praise, reaction? He reattaches our lips and I see his hips grinding up and down, needing contact. Definite reaction. I take off my tie and shirt.He wraps his arms and legs around me and pulls me onto him further so, he can get more friction. I lower my kisses down to his jaw and then, to his shoulder and soon to his stomach; everyone has a soft spot; I need to find his. His moans are music, they are amazing, I want to hear more of them. I want him to scream my name, to beg me for more. Control yourself, Sherlock, focus. I move back up to his head; his ear, sensitive. I lean next to his ear and I lick his ear lobe and I nip at it. I breathe down his ear and the reaction I received is amazing. He is whining and his hips thrusted up as soon as I breathed; sweet spot found. I move back down and begin kissing. He is in his underwear and I, in just my trousers, something isn't quite real about this, I need to ask John for his consent. "Are you sure you want this, John?" I stop kissing him and he relaxes on the bed, breathless. "What if this can't work out, what if we become too attached?" He breathes out heavily and smiles lightly.
"What do you mean?" I ask, squinting my eyes. She once again chuckles.
"Just needed to borrow it." He smiles. "Where is he?"
"Why would I care?"
"Tomorrow is school, right?"
"I wouldn't be asking you to help me or say 'I want you' if I didn't."
"Hahaha, some of it is me, some of it isn't either way they all belong to me hahaha." He laughs through his tears. His sudden mood swing is almost scary and chilling. To know this boy did some harm to himself, this brilliant minded, boy did this, is painful even towards me.
"There's nothing to answer, I speak to him sometimes, nothing more."
"Yes, Watson?" I reply.
I walk over to the sleeping boy and I sit next to him. I put my hand in Sherlock's hair, it's so soft and curly, I love it.
"Yep. I liked her girlfriend because she would listen to me and when she left I had no one else and you're right, I wanted people to know and understand so, I would actually be cared about for once, by someone. Anyone. But, you know, don't tell anyone, I'm not an attention seeker or anything... plus, I thought we were on the subject of you suppressing your feelings. Not me-"
"How will we go about this? I can't get into a relationship because, as much as I would love to do that, I can't get attached to people as you know I have enemies; Moriarty etc..." He pulls his underwear the rest of the way up and sits back down on the bed.
"Yes, her. Turns out we'll be staying with her while we attend the school because of how far it is away from our house. We couldn't go to any other school as there are non close by so, Baker Street Middle is the closest. We have to arrive there at school by 8:30am." I check the alarm clock, IT'S BLOODY 6:37 am!
"Easily gotten out of."
"Shall we go, then?" John asks. I just follow as they lead off down the corridor. She's planning something and I don't know what it is, why can't I figure her out, I can't even tell what her parents do. It hurts not knowing... that's what she makes me feel... unsure. I feel unsure. How has this one girl made me feel unsure? I've only just met her and she's already gotten to me. We walk through the lunch hall doors and we sit down at a table, John and
Sorry this was late, I've been having some difficulties in updating this but, here you go. Enjoy :)
"Yes it is, if she can't handle it then, she is too sensitive for her own good. Blazer?" I keep 2 conversations at once to save time.
"Wait, Sherlock, now." I sigh and stop. He walks towards me until stood in front of me; he's so short. "Your tie, it's messy, can you not tie, ties?" He chuckles.
"Who is it, Sherlock?"
"I hope you sleep well, Sherlock. I'll be in the other room if you need me." He just hums and I walk away towards the door. "G'night, Sherlock." I pull the door behind me until, a shout stops me.
"To chat, of course, is it illegal for enemies to talk, now?"
"You want to clean up don't you? I find no trouble in helping you with that, even if my schedule is extremely full, I can spear a couple more hours of time for you." I walk into the bathroom with him and I place him in the bath.
"You are so amazing. You did so well, I'm so proud of you." I breathe out. He just lays on the bed, breathless and just coming down from his high. I'm know praising him is the best thing to help him. Just watching him is making me on the verge of coming. I remove my hand from his underwear to find my hand coated in his body fluid. "John?"
"I maybe bad at names, brother dear, but, you are terrible at tying things. Let me help you." He laughs back at me. "Also, do not forget your hankie, don't want you going out your classes to get tissue." He says, taking a hand off my tie, taking out a hankie from his pocket, relocating it into my pocket. I mumble under my breath, cursing him.
"Thank you. Just before you explain, why did this just happen, I didn't feel like I was getting any stimulation to cause this..."
"Yeah- yeah I'm fine..." He sounds as if a massive weight has just been lifted off his lungs.
"My problems are my own! Do you hear me, John?! Hum!? Do you understand my words?! They are
"Why, these? Well, heh, this is where I help
"Hum?" He pants.
"I don't care anymore, John. It's pointless to dwell on something so insignificant in my life." I blow on my drink to cool it.
"Too, noticeable..." I squint at the thought however, I just take a deep breath in. "Well, this has been fun and all but, I have class in..." I check my watch. " ...10 minutes, so I better be off.
"John, I do not like where this is going, I do not give into sentiment however, that is an area where you fail to full fill. Now just leave me be." I shout whispering in his ear. He pushes me away and sakes his head.
"Just answer one thing... why?"
"How's that news paper, Brother dear?" Mycroft steps into the room.
"Thank you. How would you know what isn't sentiment? Since when can you detect what isn't love?" He grabs his cup and saucer and pours the dilated tea and watches it mix with the sugar.
"You're here, with me, you're not dead, you are a living, breathing, organism. You keep all these normal human functions inside you and it's unhealthy. You may not be dead now, but you are killing yourself slowly!"
"Send him up." I sigh, pacing back and forth. Mycroft groans and goes back down the stairs, shutting the door behind him. John looks at me in bewilderment.
cruel, aren't you? I like it." He jeers.
sit next to each other and I sit opposite. I feel weird about this situation, it makes me uneasy, it makes me worried...
"Did I stutter, big brother? Unbutton. Your. Shirt." I repeat sternly. He just looks at me in complete confusion until, a wave of awareness hits him. His body tenses up at the acknowledgment of what I was trying to say. We sit in silence for a short amount of time until, Mycroft croaks something out.
"Of course I would, could and can want you, John. I, in fact, need you. More than anything, to the point that it's becoming a terrible inconvenience." This is a quick turn of events to sentiment. We keep quiet for a while, both of us contemplating on what to do next. "Even if it's just tonight, just show me, let me feel something more than drugs and booze, let me feel you. I do find that I'm in need of a closer view of the human body and its functions and what better way to do so than, to have full contact with one. Let me explore you, John."
"Heh, I love you too, you pillock." I smile. I can't believe he's set me off like this, my erection is getting better but, not at the same time. I need to sort myself out, Jesus... I'm so disgusting, liking my room mate in this way isn't right! It's dirty and wrong and lewd and IM TOO YOUNG!! I just want him so much, it hurts, it hurts me to know that I can never have him yet, he got himself drunk just for me... if that isn't commitment then, I don't know what is. But, still, that doesn't mean he loves me. I just want him, to be mine, even if he would rather have a drink and some drugs instead of me, behind all of that there's me, wanting him... when will he see that? Maybe he did what he did more so, for himself rather than, for me...
"... Let's talk about this later, it's killing the mood a little."
"Yes, Sherlock." I sigh.
"If you do not attend, you will go into rehab."
"I DON'T FUCKING CARE!" My tea spills onto my lap and on the bed. A hiss of pain escapes my lips as I try to rub it off and slamming the tea cup on the table. My body jerks off the bed, John isn't in the room anymore. He returns quickly with a wet towel. I just rub at the fabric in pain.
"Make me!" I shout. Mycroft takes a sharp inhale and exhales slowly. He rubs his eyes with his right index finger and thumb.
"Well, then, it doesn't matter anyway, you've seen and it isn't a secret to you anymore. Just don't tell anyone, understand?"
"Where is he!?" One shouts. Their voice is deep and mellow, a strong British voice.
"You're drunk, Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson are down stairs."
"Well, you being this sociable with people, it's not like you."
"Thank you. Anyway, I'll be back later." I get up and head for the door and I grab my wallet and a hat, forgetting about my coat and scarf.
, not even one kiss to say goodbye?" He puckers his lips tauntingly.
"Enough of that, Sherlock is drunk in his bedroom go look for yourself." He walks into Sherlock's bedroom. I follow him as I walk in I see Sherlock standing up on the bed and taking off his clothes.
"Well, it's a good thing I'm planning on working at a hospital because then, I can be your doctor and you can be my patient." He whispers, as he reaches his hand into my pocket. My body jerks at his action into a stiff, posture. His hand exits my pocket holding his mobile phone. "Some toast please, Sherlock." He says sitting down again, turning on his phone. I walk back into the kitchen and put 4 pieces of toast into the toaster, calming myself down. He's going to be bugging me about this for a long time to come.
"Sorry but, I'll have to decline!" I shout, plan of action a go. Take out Moriarty, hankie could come in use. I put my hand into my pocket drawing out my hankie, I run over to Moriarty and throw it in his face. He stumbles back and I take my chance to swipe my leg across his knees, tripping him up. The other boy runs at me from behind, I quickly dodge him and curve around him. He turns around confused, my two hands fly up hitting him both side of his head on his temples. He throws his hands to his head in agony and I take my chance to attack his stomach. Then, he curves his back, closing his body together, bending his knees. I then push him back, tripping him up falling over Moriarty as he gets back up again, he is taken down once again by the gigantic lump. I run for dear life away from the two, dumbfounded boys and make my way out the gates. The path leading to the main office isn't too far away so, I stick to my plan of running there. I reach the wall and run through the open gated entrance. Without looking, I instinctively grab something and turn the corner holding it tightly against my body.
"With your hand. Rub it."
"Sherlock?" I pause.
"Sherlock, go to bed, please. Come on."
"Maybe, I could help you too, perfect opportunity." He smiles.
"'Do you love Sherlock?'" He laughs and I smile at him.
"Don't you dare patronise me, Moriarty. There will be serious consequences from that."
"Fine. I'll stay, Sherlock." His face lights up to those words, he looks like a child at Christmas. I it on the other side of the bed taking my socks off. I go to take my shirt off however, I stop, I can't do that it'll be wrong.
"Uncharacteristic? Sherlock, you have every characteristic I can think of, what can be out of character for you?" I place my hand on his hair, tangling my fingers into each strand. "...except... that...." Taking a deep breath in and out I cough.
"Yes I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be? I'm fine! Ok!? I'm fine!" I shout.
"Good night, Sherlock." I say, yawning as I set an alarm on my phone.
"Also, I have therapy in a couple of days, you still up to going with me."
"Ah! Yes! Sherlock! Please! I need to- I need to-!" He cries, muffled by my fingers, I curve my hand around his mouth- I don't want Mrs Hudson and or Mycroft to hear. I keep pumping him until, a muffled moan comes from him and his hips buck upwards into my hand, he has hit climax. I feel the boy's liquid flow down the head of his cock and onto my hand. He is breathing rapidly and his hips continue to buck into my hand, trying to pump more and more out of him. I kiss him gently, easing him down.
"Nothing, I'm- I'm fine." Trying to keep calm I take a deep breath in and out. Stop, feeling this. It's highly annoying she's making me feel. I manage to compose myself and return to my regular posture. John just shrugs it off and continues with his sandwich.
"Yes, it looks alright. What's the time?" I see Mycroft check his watch and go back to sorting his hair out.
"What is it, brother Dear!" I shout before he can knock on the closed door. It opens and Mycroft enters the room.
"No more." He walks away with the glass. Awwwwwww. He makes me sad. Hmmmmmm... lemme try something. Hehe.
"You're being dumb now, John. Look at my crotch!"
A female enrols at John's and Sherlock's school however, how much trouble will she cause and why is she causing it?
"Oh?"
"Which, Hell or prison?"
"No you look like your hard but, either will do." He smiles.
"Maybe, but, the only reason is because no body likes me."
"... I'll say one thing but, then you have to eat..."
"I want you to know how much I love you because you are so kind and so helpful and you are always there for me and I will always be there for you. You probably don't like me back because of how many times I have fallen out with you but, it was because I was scared. I was scared of you rejecting me and only using me only for the fact that you had to."
"Nothing." I sigh. "The bell's going to go in a minute we should get out things.
"Ok-ok." He sighs, putting his hands to his face.
"I am unaware..."
"Are you seriously this dense?!" I take in a deep breath to calm myself down and whisper 'ok' under my breath. "Unbutton your shirt, Mycroft..." I say calmly.
"You want to test me. You want to see whether I will leave John and save myself or die for John or save him, there are multiple out comes and multiple ways to find those out comes in a plethora of different ways. However, you are looking for just one in order to get what you want, the information you need."
"Fine, 10 minutes, no longer."
"However, you will be ending up in hell earlier than me, prison is much easier because then, I could see you before that inevitable day."
"REMEMBER WHAT?!" I shout again... wait... "Watson... did we... have sex?" I ask. John's face goes red before he blurts out.
"No." He mumbles again.
"You'll have sperm coming out of your penis and the tension will be no longer there."
"Mycroft! Open up your eyes! Mother doesn't give a shit about us! She says she does but, in reality she's scared, she's a coward, she's isn't bothered! Father! Oh, don't even get me started on
"I don't care if
"I know, I don't expect it to be, I'm just glad you care so much."
"Ding, ding, ding~~ We have a winnerrrrrr!!" He laughs. How can he say that, with a smile!? Why- how- this cant be happening, my best friend is a drug addict, a smoker, a cutter, a drinker and a genius... how does this make sense?! "Nothing makes sense, Watson..." His voice becomes serious and mellow. "If you only have one conclusion it must be correct, no matter how improbable. Let it sink in, John it's hard, I know. I'm sorry, John."
"Come on, Watson, don't do this, this morning." I moan.
"I want you, Sherlock. We will work it out." He cups my cheek.
"Why do you ask?" Shit. Does he know?
"I could've died... I could've died!" He cries into his hands.
"Ok, I promise." He crosses his heart with his index finger.
"Why would you care about someone so insignificant in your life!"
"I promise. Don't worry." I get up and I grab my coat.
"I can do it for you, if you want. I don't mind." He smiles, picking up the tray.
"But, what about you?"
"Please~, call me Irene, John." He voice is like velvet yet, he words are like a python, suffocating me slowly and purely, both at the same time. She looks almost intimidating.
"Thank you, John." I turn to make my leave.
I put the note into my pocket and reach for the item inside the bag. It's an apple... with three bite marks engraved in it.
"Do. You. Want. This?" He seems to have a more darker look in his eyes.
"Don't be clever, Sherlock! Don't you dare even try to make this into a joke!"
"Didn't you listen in sex ED?"
"You don't have to do that! That's going to far!"
Is this what karma is? I wanted some fun because school is boring and now I'm messing with fire. I have to go, or else who know what would happen. I take another drag of my cigarette. The woman... he hired her... why. Later. I need to go back to John; he'll be suspicious.
"Why aren't you telling me where, though?"
"Actually, I was just about to go out after I cleaned up the cups."
"No... I'm just... in a rush."
"Some friends do."
"Mmmmm. not tired."
"...no..." He mumbles.
"What is it, Sherlock?" I get up to find him.
"It's fine, John. It doesn't matter, let's just get back to the flat, we can talk there; where there are no snakes hissing around." I grumble. The rest of the way home is silent, an uncomfortable one at that. We arrive 5 minutes later, Mycroft goes to his room, me and John head up the creaky steps. We head into our flat and I shut the door after us, slamming it. I chuck my coat and blazer on the floor and undo my top buttons. John picks up the clothes off the floor and hangs them up.
"Funny... you said the same thing last night when I told you ' Its ok'." He says, sipping again at his tea.
"No-no it's not ok! It's never ok!" I snap.
I apparently have stimulant to moans well, John's moans. The feel of him, is actually... arousing.
"Yeah, I know, it's not really a priority at the moment." I grumble. She comes even closer to me.
"Give me 3 minutes, Watson!" I shout starting to walking away quickly, soon after, I begin running. I make sure he doesn't follow me as I turn the corner, I just see him sitting down on a bench. The same place as last time would be a good place to go so, I run towards the back of the school. Once I arrive, I immediately lean against the wall to catch my breath, as I do I reach into my pocket for my cigarettes and my lighter. However, as I do, I grab another object. A piece of paper or (more specifically) a letter. It looks like it's been in a book, one that is open regularly and subjected to dirty water, causing it to have been slightly damaged. Must've been dropped in a puddle so, taken out the house. Could've been kept in a contact book or notepad, not a reading book because it has been dropped slightly in a puddle and people, rarely, read outside. It's an A4 piece of paper written in portrait position and folded horizontally. The crease from where it has been folded looks like it's been flattened so, it wouldn't open on it's own without being opened by hand which means it must be private. There's also a fold on the top left hand corner which has also been pressed down... continuously, by a finger nail; nerves. Before I open the letter I'm going to light my cigarette. I do so and put my lighter back into my pocket as well as the pack of cigarettes. I open up the note and read it in my head.
"You want to have a nap before dinner?"
"Sherlock, what're you doing now?" I ask.
I slam my locker shut, holding my apple in my left hand.
I plug my phone in, in the kitchen and I click the kettle on. It smells strongly as instant noodles, ah 2 bowl that used to be filled with them... delicious. Also, I spot my whiskey I must've bought last night, no wonder I cant remember, its almost empty. As the kettle proceeds to do it's job, I check my phone. Message from: The Woman.
"Ok. Ok. I'm done with being nice. How the
"Yeah sure, I'm guessing I'll have to go so, I'll get changed and get my shoes on. What would you like?" He gets up and heads for the door way.
"Moving on, I heard, you cannot feel sexual desire from females. Is that true?"
"Oh, Sherlock."
"I know but, that's what I fear the most. Never mind, get some sleep and sort out your problem as I think seeing Sherlock like that has probably made you worst. I'll be taking my leave now. Good night, Mr. Watson."
"I will if you answer my question from earlier."
"Of course I do."
"Put some clothes on." I look down, oh god.
"Cum? Well, I don't know."
Mycroft lets out a sigh of frustration and grabs a small pile of clothes, folded into a square shape. He throws them into my arms and grabs another pile of clothes.
"Because you wouldn't want me."
I check the time, it's 10:10pm. He's late. God where is he? I pace the floor worriedly, what if something bad happened? What if he's hurt? Why am I getting so worked up about it, this is Sherlock I'm talking about, he'll be fine. Right? After a few more times pacing, I hear the down stairs front door slam shut, this has to be Sherlock! I run out the door and down the stairs to see him. It is him! However, I stop at the top of the stairs before I greet him, there's something off. There's a smell I can't lay my finger on, it smells like tar, like a thick smoke from burning wood but, worse... smoke... tar... hold on. Has he been smoking?! He looks dizzy and like he hasn't an idea where he is or where he's been.
"R-really?" I stutter slightly, why am I so taken back by a single compliment, by a boy of whom I've just met? Sentiment... it's getting the best of me... calm down... calm down... stay calm.
"You wouldn't, couldn't and can't want this from me, of all people." He laughs sadly.
you. I need you."
"Sh-Sherlock, I-I can't. I-it's wrong." I protest. The offer is so tempting and I don't know why. "I'll only be in the other room, not too far away." He looks at me sadly yet, sternly.
"Can- can you stay here, with me." I can't watch you all night, Sherlock."
"How do you know?"
"Ah- well..." He grabs his tea and sips it. "You have therapy tomorrow so, we can sort this out."
"Just be careful because the longer you love him the stronger it will become and the stronger it becomes the easier it'll be for him to hurt you." He walks away without another word. The door shuts.
"Oh, am I not sexy or sensual enough for you?"
"You wanted help with something else, though." He says smugly as the kettle clicks off, I pour the water in the teapot, that is positioned on a tray as well as 2 saucers and twin teacups- one with one teaspoon full of sugar and the other with two- and a small pot of milk. I place 3 tea bags in the teapot and I grab 3 teaspoons; one to stir the teabags in the pot of tea and the other 2 for me and my brother for our cups.
"Come on." He prompts.
"Well, if you must know my friend here wasn't too happy in middle school when you damaged him so, he wanted revenge and obviously I didn't want to miss the opportunity to see my loyal play thing so, I'm here to even things out between us, call it a token of my affection." His Irish accent rolls off his tongue like a python. I look him over, there is something in his trouser pocket.
Fuck... my head... I feel so dizzy, I feel sick and tired. My eyes are heavy as I open them, my vision is blurred and unclear. I'm in my bed. How? I only remember going out last night to the shops for... uh I think booze and... what's the time?... Where is my phone?! I need to find it. I get up out my bed and walk through the broken door frame to eventually look in the living room. I check the clock on the mantelpiece, 6:41am, why this early? Oh well, can't dwell on that, I need my phone. Uhh... where did I see it last... I was with Mycroft? He could've taken my phone, highly likely, as I wouldn't have misplaced it myself. So, he would've gave it back after he did what he needed to do... and because I was intoxicated, due to the signs I have of a hang over, the other person he would give it to is John.
"Hello." I greet him.
"A-ahahaha..." He laughs embarrassedly. "I- uh- I said I'm your friend."
"You know what happened in middle school, Mycroft. You wouldn't understand what he can do..." Just thinking of what happened makes me feel queasy, it never happened to my brother, he was never bullied. He builds reputations and a social standing and yet, keeps people distant, like they don't mean anything to him. However, me, on the other hand, I don't want people to get too close to me, I have the odd person here and there, who I actually like but, even then, I keep them distant. People are difficult, too much work and effort and... pain. I prefer being alone. Mother and father think I have something wrong with me because of my constant distant attitude to them and sadness and therefore, sends to me therapy. I want to leave but, they say 'It's for the best, Sherlock.' Some days I like going there, other days I don't, it all depends. I go there once every 3 weeks so, not too often.
"No, male." I snap.
"Then, don't watch, sleep, here, next to me." A large blush creeps up on my face, I try to cover it with my hand and I look away.
"Right," I cough. "I need to get my phone, I may have thrown it and we also need to have dinner." I say, moving John onto the bed. John just sits up again and yawns. I retrieve my phone, there's a few cracks on the screen but, not fatal so, it'll still be good to use. The time's 5:12 pm. "What do you want for dinner, John?"
"Can't you just show me?"
"Yes, ok. See you later." I spray some after-shave and I put my coat and scarf on.
I want to know did you kiss her back?" His hands clutch together. Where is he trying to get with this?
"Hello, sir, could you help me with something just a bit, it shan't take long." I plead.
"I- I don't actually know. I thought you would like her and stop spending time with me." He mumbles.
John's room. He's not the cleanest of boys, considering he has father, who is apart of the military. I tread on a few of John's clothes while trying to get to his bed. After tripping over one or two of his things, I get to his bedside table where I see my phone; it's flashing. I have a message. John in nothing but his pants... interesting... anyway I should sort him out. MY PHONE out, my phone out- sort my phone out... yes that's what I meant. I'll also make John some tea while I'm at him-it! IT! OBJECT! IT! This is cringe even for me... I really have stooped to a new low of thinking lewd things about my flatmate.
"Look down." I moan.
"... In the friendship- John, last time I checked, 'natural friends' don't want to do these things with each other."
"And you care because...?"
"..." We don't speak for a while, we have a moments of silence. We both finish our tea in that time. Mycroft gets up and stands for a couple of seconds and begins to speak.
".... Fine, but, we're not doing this when we're at, Mrs Hudson's house. Speaking of, will there be any other children there? Last time, there was a girl who went there but, stopped because she was over sensitive..." He looks up at me and breaths out a laugh.
I wait for a reply, 5 minutes I get one.
"Once every week." He sips his tea again.
"...It's ok..."
"Yes." I lean down and kiss him again. I mumble into his lips.
that their dad is cheating on their mum. Aaaaaaand... done" The smiling man steps up and straightens his own shirt and tie to make it look presentable.
"Have you never had an erection before?" He gets up, putting his laptop down on the floor.
"Looks like we have French together, Holmes. Would you mind escorting me there~?" Her breath is minty fresh, it hits my nostrils like a bullet to the head. I flinch to look at her.
"List? List of what? Shopping? On the counter in the kitchen, we could do with some milk-"
"I've heard of them but, no, I have not."
"Naturally, I could never worry my fragile friend, John Watson."
What about you? I see you have a bit of 'pleasure' in your trousers as well." We both draw our guns.
"That's only because I don't need you."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes, we've eaten." Mycroft replies for us both as he knows I will not respond.
"Mhmhh."
"Sherlock?" His words make me jump out of my thoughts and I stare at the tired looking boy as he rubs his eye and yawns. "I'm sorry if I startled you but, how come I'm still... here...?
"I don't think it's because I'm weak, brother dear~" I coo.
I can't believe I'm standing outside of Baker Street High. It's a public school but, their ratings from Ofsted are brilliant! My Sister said I wouldn't get in, but look at me now! John Watson, in the prestigious, notorious, Baker Street High! The uniform looks great, navy jumper; silk shirt; red and green tie; comfortable black, cotton trousers and (to top it of) leather, black, shoes. The main gate is so, large and mysterious and-
"By that you mean?"
"Sherlock!" I hear him shout from the lounge, I frown and grab my shoes to put them on.
"I don't want to go to school. It's boring and useless. Can I just stay here and miss it?" I stuff my face into my pillow and shut my eyes. However, before I can settle down I feel my brother grab my sheets off my back, allowing the cold, morning air to hit my back. Goosebumps wave over my body, faster than the common cold spreads, even from under my night clothes it's freezing cold.
"This might look bad, Mycroft, I know what your thinking and you have incorrect data." I defend.
"No." I get up and grab my coat and scarf. "I'll get rid of you once and for all." I wrap my scarf around my neck.
"... google it. I'm not explaining it."
"Y-yes, I-I did." He replies, he's embarrassed. What happened in that lesson? I don't want to know. However, the more I don't want to know, the more my brain interprets what happened. It makes me feel sick, I put a hand to my mouth. "What's up, Sherlock?" John asks, eating his sandwich.
"Yep, that's what embarrassment is, John. Have you forgotten who you're talking to? I'm your best friend. I am in need of some assistance, I would help you too, even if it is this situation. It is aching, I need some kind of thing to help this rising feeling. Google won't give me release." I see John groan and sigh heavily. "Please."
"You knew what was going on at that time and he just wanted to help me!"
"...don't remind me..." I shiver just thinking about it.
"What about your coat?!" John calls after me. I ignore him. I get to the door downstairs and I exit after hearing Mycroft call after me. It's cold but, I need to find Bill or someone. I can't get drugs this time, I promised John... why would I care what I promised John?! Anyway, I don't think drugs will cut it this time. Cut, yes, cut. I'll just buy a sharpener and I can then unscrew the blade but, it's too cold to stay out here. John and Mycroft will come looking for me and I don't want that but, why would they care? I will head home as soon a I buy it, my bedroom should suffice. My height does a great roll in making the clerk think I'm older and my fake ID will throw them off completely. I managed to get one from a drug dealer I saved from getting arrested back when I was in year 8. He was in a lot of trouble and I had my ways in getting him out of it so, he had one of his buyers get me a fake ID as a 'thank you'.
"God, you're a light weight, aren't you?"
"Hahaha! You make it sound like I'm gonna' die!" He laughs maniacally. It just makes me angry.
"Sherlock-"
"You are stupid aren't you? What has he done for you since you met him?"
"Uh... what?" He smiles confused. "Your jacket?"
"Nothing. I don't feel anything." She chuckles.
"I didn't tell you the whole story..." He mutters.
"Fine! I will attend but, John is coming with me." John's head whips towards my direction.
"Hm?" He sounds tired and lazy.
"Yeah, I remembered. Mycroft told me yesterday. Yes, I'll still be there."
"On my way, John!" I reply. I slip my shoes on quickly and run through the door.
"Why're ya askin' me, kid?" He blushes slightly yet, it's not enough evidence. I hear Mycroft coming up slightly behind me but stops to keep his distance.
"Sherlock." I groan.
"They should be in order..." I mumble. I see his facial expressions change as he reads through the list of drugs. He sighs heavily, putting the paper in his school trouser pocket.
"Oh, want me to cook some food for us? I went shopping the other day so, we should have some stuff in."
"You know what I'm going to say and that's why you're asking this, stop it."
--------*John's POV*--------
"Say that to the time you slept with him." He smirks.
kissed
"I'm sorry, I wish I could tell you but, I can't. I'll say one thing though, to keep you one edge~." She puts her head next to my ear. "Did you miss me?" She whispers. I look straight ahead of me in realisation as soon as those words leave her lips. She kisses my cheek and leaves.
"Give. Me. My. Sheet."
"Eh, it's more likely I'll be in hell before, I end up in prison."
"No." I defend.
"Of course, slow means I will have you longer." I walk to him, slipping my coat off and then, my scarf. My right hand reaches his stomach and it snakes to his back, tracing over his curves. My other hand does the same however, lower; his hip. My left hand is cupped gently on his ass. I pull him closer, pushing his body against mine, sharing our body heats. His hands wrap around my neck, bringing our faces closer, closer still, until I feel his breath upon my skin. I admire his eyes, his lips, his cheeks, his neck, all of him. He is so unique and I want to explore every part of him. Before I know it, our lips attach and we start slowly kissing until, the kiss becomes more wanting and hungry and I accidentally moan into John's mouth. He doesn't seem to care, he seems like he enjoyed it more than anything. Interesting, stimulation to unspoken praise and noises. The way our bodies are positioned isn't enough for me, I need to explore more. I pick him up and carry him into my room and he lies down on my bed and I tower over him, kissing him again. Eventually, our tongues intertwine and I begin unbuttoning his shirt and I force it to come off. He shuffles his trousers off at the same time. I exit the kiss to look at him.
"Why are you relieved?"
"Hello, Sherlock."
"You really have been doing your homework, haven't you, Sherly? But, what do I want?" That is the question. What does he want? He doesn't want to kill us, he has too many plans to kill us now. He wants something from me, information. It must be something to do with John. No one else but, John... "Aw, you're slowing down on me, Sherlock. John, give him some motivation." John. John. What about John. 'Thank you, Sherlock. I can leave John alone now. You've made this easier.' The Woman. 'Trust me, John, the last thing I would do is give into sentiment to other people.' Sentiment. John. Sentiment towards John. Feelings for John Watson.
"The matter of fact, yes, yes he is."
"See you later, Sherlock~~." And she's gone. I stand there in shock. She works for Moriarty. How did I not know that? He's planning something, something big.
"Well, I think someone is slightly heavy and is trying to start a diet~. Is that correct, brother dear?" I look at his face, I can tell he is taken aback by the remark as he has 'hurt' written all over his face. His grip loosens but, doesn't go completely and still manages to pin me. The look in his eyes looks distant and fuzzy, yet his eye contact with me stays connected and sharp. He and I stay like that for 1 minute and 23 seconds, as I have calculated, until he blinks and takes in a deep breath. "Welcome back, brother. How was your trip to, what is it called, Mind Land?"
"Yes? What is it, Watson?"
"Nothing, it just kind of happened. What do I do? What is this?"
A strange boy has just walked into our flat and my roommate has just locked himself in his room with him. Why does all this set off alarm bells for me? Bill looks like...like... a junkie! A homeless boy. Should I intervene or should I just trust, Sherlock?
"Hello to you too, John. I came to return Sherlock's phone. He ran out earlier and I was going to return it then however, I became distracted and so, here I am. Where is he?"
" 'aright, Shez?" His accent is lacking in formality and he talks in slag quite a lot but, that's natural for him. He goes to our school but, he's mainly in the background and slips around a lot, he's like Stamford but, there is a lot of differences between them two.
"I'm not lonely."
"You can just, tryyyy, come onnnnn." He wines laughing still. Ok, if I am to find out I have to look. These have been made by a syringe, one is slightly infected and some are fairly new and only just mending, so not done professionally. '
"Say what you said."
"John!" I shout from my bedroom, tying my shoe up. "JOHN!" I quickly shove my pistol into my trouser pocket before he comes in.
"Please..."
"Your buttons?"
"Don't worry, good sir, thank you for your time." I thank as his phone starts beeping from another call. "You better get that, sir, you have a business to run here wouldn't want your boss or, worst, your husband to have...
I put a smile on my face, as mischievous as I can. As my brother did, I start laughing as well.
"Do you know where the key is?" I ask.
Now onto the bad list. Anderson and Donovan, they hated me by the first day and I them. Turns out they're mine and John's form and in all my science lessons and my chemistry lessons so, that's fun. Obviously, Moriarty is on my bad list however, he's been making friends at school left, right and centre, I have no idea what he's planning so, that's why it's good to have some people to be around school keeping their wit about them.
"Male!" I shout. It carries on like that for the rest of the journey, us two arguing on his partner. However, we finally get to Baker Street and there, it is time to get out. We disperse out the cab but, before I go to the house door, I return to the cab and ask:
"Deal!" He shouts enthusiastically. "Cab driver, lets go, ladies first~." I groan however, take my opportunity to go first.
"I dunno'. Maybe he's gone to the park." The other voice is lighter and there's a tint of Irish leaking through when they say I's and R's. There are rapid footsteps following his comment and they start fading away. So, this person's a male. He looks around the corner and sighs heavily, removing his grip round my body and mouth. I can feel my cheeks going red because of his grip on my body, I don't know whether it's because I'm angry or because of something else ... no just angry... just angry. I throw myself away from him and put my hands up, breathing rapidly. He's just straightening his jumper out. He notices his tie is undone and starts trying doing it up again.
"Yeah, sure, Shez." He mumbles, scratching irately at his hand. I see John behind me looking at us in confusion.
"No, I just rather not talk about it."
"Oh, don't play dumb, Sherlock. You couldn't see pleasure even if it came up to you and shot you in the head. That's why you have Johnny Boy and I can see why you keep him, army boy, right? I bet he's rough isn't he and,
"Is that a pocket knife you've got there, or are you just happy to see me?" I ask playfully serious.
"I-I can't..."
"Why do you look so unsettled then? Something startled you?"
! He hurts us, Mycroft! Not out of love, not because he 'accidentally' punches us, pulls a knife out on us, strangles us, lashes us with his belt, burns us with his cigarettes! He purposely does it! You are such an idiot!" My breathing is heavy and rapid, my pulse is racing, my vision is fuzzy almost, blurred. Everything comes into focus and I can see my bother sitting back and just staring me, with a bored expression.
"No, no."
"Why do you have his phone?" I cough.
"Sorry?"
"Yeah, well, I was with Anderson during lesson and he kinda, stole mine." He chuckles.
"I can't, Sherlock, I'm too young."
can, and I will, Sherlock. Do not test me." I groan hard, messing up my hair.
The bell has gone for the beginning of form time with our tutor called Mr Smith, Culverton Smith, I don't like him, not at all. There's something about him that makes me feel uneasy and on edge. I shake it off as just growing up hormones however, I'm still going to keep an eye on him anyway. He doesn't make us do any work or activities in form so usually we just talk. Me and john sit in our places next to each other, Molly opposite John and Donavan and Anderson to the left of me on the other side of the table. Mr Smith is at the front of the class doing the register but, the thing that catches my eye is that there is someone standing next to him, a female.
"I'm not interested, Miss Adler. You may have John in you hold but, I am not."
"Ok, no more now." He takes my cup and bottle awayyyyy, nooooooo.
"I can sort it later, if you begin now, you'll end up burning the whole flat down so, I suggest you don't."
"All god, mate. Listen, I've got your ord-" I cut him off before he can say anymore.
"No, I'm not."
"Stay still." He puts his hands on my cheeks and they descends down to my neck and then to my shoulders.
"Mhmhh, just wanted to tell ya." He hums sleepily.
"Good night, Watson."
"I'm sorryyyyy~~~" He wines, I sight thinking what to do.
"Sherlock..." My vision becomes blurred and glossy, tears roll down my cheeks, my mouth tastes like blood and my face is red hot. Why, Sherlock. How did I not know?!
"What did I say to you?" This worries me, I could've said anything to him, things that he can't know like Moriarty and such on... oh no...
"Oh, I ran out of stationary so, I just ran to the shops and bought some."
"Too hot." He whines back as he takes off his trousers. Mycroft looks back at me.
"How?!"
"Where's the list, Sherlock?" He asks.
"Ok, look, I'm sorry, John. I didn't mean for this to effect you like that. Ok?"
"Why are you dressing up so smartly?" John asks, leaning against my door frame.
"What are you thinking about, Mycroft?" I ask without notice. He hums and still sits still, I roll my head back in boredom until, an idea springs to mind. "Wanna play a game, Brother?" I purr. Now that attracts his attention.
"Do you not want this?" He smiles.
"Stay away from Watson." I grumble. She just grins.
"It would with John."
"Yes, yes it really was. Has anyone told me about you? How did you know any of these things?" He asks, naming list after list of questions.
"Hah, I forgot about that. So, that's why you were distracted." I smirk.
"y-yeah but, still you were drunk... drunk people do weird stuff.."
"No he has a husband, clearly. In that picture you see, that is his sister, not wife. Why would he have a picture of his wife on his keys if he wants to get with other people? Also, if you looked at his right ring finger, the finger, some, gay couples have their ring on, it is slightly lighter tone than the rest of his hand. Children were adopted. Your turn.
"Mhmhh."
"So, John, did you enjoy English~?" She coos, lying her head on his shoulder. His back straightens up and he sits with more posture, a sign he is tense.
"Now that's a difficult decision... ok, you have a deal." He smiles back at me and sits up. We stay in silence for a bit. "We should get cleaned up. We're all sweaty and we smell like sex." He laughs.
"I'll answer all later, Watson. It's time for school. We'll speak after school, at Mrs. Hudson's house. Come along!" I start walking and I hear his voice shout behind me.
"I'm not going."
"Such harsh words. Hell would work better for me, though. As I know, we'll both end up there."
"Give me back my sheet." I growl, I'm not in the mood for this, this morning for something this stupid.
"Boys!" We hear a third voice interrupt. We both look at John, turns out we both stopped walking and Mycroft and I are face to face. We just begin walking again and John scurries behind to catch up again. "Listen, I don't mind coming with Sherlock to- whatever it is. I can keep an eye on him, make sure he tells me where he's going and who he has round the flat. However, as his brother, Mycroft, this should be your job."
"But the whole reason we actually did this was for you."
"He'd be dead in an abandoned building." John looks at me as he heard the word 'dead'. I keep my head down, snarling to myself. "That's why he makes a list of all the drugs he's had because that day he was shaken up and I hope it'll be a lesson learnt to him."
"Of course I listened, Mycroft... I just deleted it from my hard drive." I smile at him, looking up from the uniform. It's a white shirt, black trousers with a pocket on both the left leg and right legs, a pair of white socks and finally and tie. It has white stripes over a dark navy back ground; around the outskirt of the white stripes there's light blue surrounding them.
"Don't make say the same sentence again, I swear to fucking god! NOTHING IS EVER OK! IT WILL NEVER BE OK!" John jumps at the loudness of my voice. I just sigh and storm off into my bedroom. Just before I'm gone I hear john breath:
"Get dressed for school, then." He just doesn't quit, does he?
"I don't need an explanation. Did you kiss her?"
"I see... may I do something... uncharacteristic for me to do..." I ask.
"How? He doesn't like me anyway, why would he?" He laughs dryly.
"Yes, yes, I know... wait- "... Sorry, can you repeat that?" John puts his head in his hands and moans.
"Don't worry about what just happened, you're in the clear because I helped you."
"Are you serious?"
I put my phone down. This is interesting.
I cough, taken aback by the remark.
"You will live there for however long it takes for you to stop being addicted. Even if it means for you to stay there until graduation." He states sternly.
"God, that sounds like the most idiotic thing..." I look at John, he's looking back at me with one of his disapproving looks. "... however, it fits our situation perfectly. We just have to put some rules down."
"But, we are young, John."
"No, this is perfectly fine. Just give me his phone and I'll give it him."
"What's the differ-"
"God- Sherlock. No! I can't, not again- you need... shit... you need to cum now." I ignore him and I continue, I move my hands to land onto his chest. I find one of his nipples and begin touching it, twisting it. He moans and gives into the pleasure of my contact and attention so, I give him what he wants. I speed up my pace, his grip tightens on my hair and his moans more loud. Too loud. I stop and move up close to his face.
however, there is no alarm clock there and the alarm keeps beeping. I hiss in pain from hitting the table I locate where it is coming from, it's on the other bed side table but, it's a phone... not mine... neither is this bed... and who is that next to me? I lift the covers away from their face... IT'S JOHN!!!
"It's settled then." I spring up from off the bed and pick John up from off the bed to carry him.
"Answer the question."
"Right." He rolls his eye. "I, most likely, won't go out so, want me to wait up?"
"How do I know if I've came?"
"You are going to school, Sherlock." Mycroft says sternly, throwing the sheets to the floor. This is the kind of things Mycroft does to piss me off. I get up out of bed and look him dead in the eyes.
"John, I can explain-"
"You know everything! You knew you needed to meet this son of a bitch here! You said he gave you an invitation! Did you want to see me get blown into fucking smithereens!?"
I know I'm slipping up, I can't love him. I don't love him. The front door from down stairs opens, it's John. He walks up the stairs slowly and before long, he opens the door. 7:43.
"I can look after him. I am capable." I reply.
"How do you know what love is, you're too alone to understand the concepts of it."
human?"
"John! Where are youuuuu?!" He slurs.
"Masturbation?"
"Well, I've died long since I was bought onto this pitiful, loathsome, disgusting parasite of a planet!" I sneer.
"You have to promise me."
"I'll get it back, don't worry. I do need the sharpener, though."
The bell rings. I grab my contact book, note book and pencil case, before I get up to leave to go to French someone grabs my arm,
"Sherlock. So, so,
"Yes, as serious as I can be." He stands there processing the information. "John? Hello?"
"No, John I didn't kiss her back. I didn't do anything, I assure you." I notice he calms down slightly at my reassurance.
He settles himself underneath the covers and snuggles into the sheets inhaling the scent of the fabric and humming with approval. I walk towards him .
"Sherlock!" He growls.
"Please John."
"Yeah, yeah I'm fine. I'm just...relieved."
"What game, Brother Dearest?" He replies. Mycroft loves games, he always has but, not the normal games, he enjoys
"Good boy. I should give you a reward. I'm not going to kill John..." He backs away from John and puts his hands in the air showing he's unarmed. I run towards John and I try and undo the bomb with success and I slip the bomb away.
"Apparently so." I nod. John's face goes red. "Problem?" He is quick to wave his hands.
"Well, then, do this for me then... promise me a next time." I smirk.
"Yes…" I close my eyes. "Possibly... but, John?"
"The same reason you woke up, my eyes decided to open, causing my body to become active and aware. Also, I couldn't keep asleep, I'm not sure what happened last night, I think I might have had too much to drink or something."
"Oh? And why is that?"
"Thank you, I'm glad you have understood what happened now." I cant deal with this. I feel so much pain in my chest. I feel like I'm drowning.
"Sure you're not... to bed now." I start pushing him towards his bedroom, damn it, we need to fix his door. I push him onto his bed. I hear the door knock. "One moment please!" I quickly rush back into the lounge and I sit onto my chair however, I notice my 'problem.' SHIT- what do I do to hide this, uh uh uh uh uh... news paper! I grab the newspaper and I put it on my lap. "Come in!" The person opens the door to reveal, Mycroft. "What are you doing up here so late?"
Lesson is boring. They're literally teaching me things I already know! Maths is so boring. I'm sitting next to a class moron, who I don't even know. It pisses me off to think that teachers give us seating arrangements. John isn't in top set with me, he's in second set, however. The bell finally goes and I'm out of there as soon as it does, the teacher tells the others to clean the room up but, I don't stay around for that, I just rush to put my things into my next lesson, English, and I go to John's maths room to wait for him because he stays to clean up most the things in the class. I lean against the wall and look at some other students walking past from some of the other classes. I huff bored of waiting for John. Before I manage to stop leaning against the wall, someone runs into me and he leaves as soon as he came, I, on the other hand, am on the wall again, holding onto the bricks to stop myself from falling over.
"Right so, what about males?" He smirks.
"What does this taste like?"
"Sorry, you got me distracted. How can I help it though, seeing John like this and you like that? It really cocks my pistol." He growls. "But, anyway, onto the game. Throw the gun down, there's no use for them. Where's the fun in that?" He throws his gun first and I tuck mine back into my pocket. "Now, you know why I'm doing this by now, don't you?"
"Mmm I love you... John." He mumbles.
Sherlock finds out what happened last night however, gets defensive as to why.
"What were you thinking about?"
"Give me the knife." He changes his tone, stretching his arm out.
"Take back what you said." I put my tea down.
"Why do you want to know?"
"Well, I didn't want to wake you up so, I though I should just leave you to sleep and to keep you warm and comfortable. Is that so wrong to do?" I hear him laugh groggily.
No. No. No.
"It's not like I have a say in this so, why not?" His grip on my arm doesn't leave me and he guides me into the gymnasium to when he finally lets go of me and shuts and locks the door behind him. It's dark and the only lights I can see is the street lights outside. I walk forward, taking long, slow, strides as I do. "What do you want then?!" I shout. "I received your little invitation and it looks like your 'friends' were expecting me. So, why not just... come out-" The lights turn on to reveal a person, my age, short. Not Moriarty. "John?" It's summer and he's wearing a large coat with fur on the inside. He's not cold... he's hiding something.
"No! John, why would I ever want that?! I don't hate you, I would never want to see you get hurt!"
games.
"Yeah keep telling yourself that..." I grumble.
"How about we just get some fish and chips from the chip shop down the road?" I suggest as I shove my phone back into my pocket and sitting on the bed.
"Ok, let's go then." We walk back through the door, entering the building. We go to John's locker first, to get his things however, he turns to me handing me a bag. "It has your name on it?" I take the bag looking inside it. There's a letter inside.
"Not 'or', Little Brother, 'and' is correct; he likes both men and women, bisexual. Smoker, fingers are coloured orange from where he holds it, as are his lips. Has 3 grand children, 2 children of is own however, 1 now, the other died. Hates his job so, he takes his chance to get with people. Clearly, his relationship with his wife is bad. Yes, wife, picture of woman in a photo on his car keys, not daughter, too old, too new, daughter was the one who died any way so, he has a son. Your turn."
No reply.
"You know what I've noticed about you, Sherlock?" He asks, placing his head back to- near enough- his original position.
"This isn't going to be an everyday thing, Watson if that's what you're thinking."
"Perfect!" He shouts in glee. "Now, let's chat about something else. Hum~? Ah! I know." He sits down next to me and puts his hand on my thigh. "Let's talk about you."
"Mrs Hudson says there's someone at the door for you, Sherlock." I get up, I know who this is but, I didn't realise he'd come today.
"You know small talk is awfully tedious." I groan, removing his hand from my leg. "Keep your hands to yourself."
"Because sometimes they can occur when thinking about something or someone that they find sexually arousing."
"Have you had breakfast, Watson?" I ask, heading into the kitchen.
the pain, hehe. Ya know that guy who came in earlier? Wiggins? He is my therapist but, they come at a price if you want to fell better~ hehe." What the hell is he on about?
"No, I- uh- give Sherlock his phone if he's awake."
Sorry, if this is a bit shit and messy, I'm working hard on progressing the story and the plot. Just bare with me. Thanks for reading so far. THERE IS MORE TO COME.
John just looks at his phone, not even caring that I'm in front of him. I grab his phone out of his hand and turn it of, putting it into my pocket. He just glares at me, sipping his tea.
"Ugh- we were getting somewhere. Ok, ask away." He sips his tea.
"What is his age?" I enquire.
"What are you-" I become extremely uncomfortable because she licks the area where I bit into the apple. My hands clench together and I swallow what's left of the apple I bit off. She just licks it and then she sucks the juice out of it. My lips become dry so, I lick them in response. Suddenly, she bites down on the apple, taking a chunk off it. My shoulders flinch from the sudden movement and I gulp. The girl then looks at me with dark eyes, she licks her lips. Before I try and respond, she looks down and comments.
