“I was just bidding my time. I knew you'd show up.” Sherlock said smugly and moved his coffee closer to the edge of the table as the waitress came over to re-fill his cup.
The room gave an “awww”
Maybe once I finish the fic I'll draw things and add them at the end so you can see what my brain saw.
“No it's a fact. I've been told on several occasions... you want to er... come too John?” Mary asked, finally looking at him.
“I learned many skills when I worked in commitments for Mycroft.” Sherlock spoke smoothly as he answered. Almost too smoothly... probably a lie then.
he thought.
The cabby gave Sherlock a wicked smile through the mirror then and pulled out another bottle. “One for you, and one for me. One is poisoned, one is not. Just like in a marriage, isn't that right, Mr. Holmes?” The Cabby's smirk grew larger, “You take one and I take one, kind of like a vow.”
John waited a moment as Sherlock settled himself. Finally Sherlock sat forward and began grinding on him. It started slow and teasing at first then quickened when he moved his hands up over his own body running them up the expanse of his chest, one hand over each nipple, moving up towards his neck and higher still, to push his hair out of his face again.
, he answered in a calm yet incredibly grating voice, “
“She’s been as insufferable as the lot of you. Thanks for that, by the way, Craig, Bruno. I do hope you enjoy my performance this week as I’ve made it just a touch more personal, which I hope everyone will appreciate.”
John Watson feels himself gulp. He clears his throat and licks his lips before saying anything again, “What about your boyfriend then?”
She gives him a look that clearly asks “what?”
“Promise?” Irene asks, though she admittedly feels a little shiver run down her back at the name.
“It's not important. Let's just say I'm an idiot and leave it at that...” Sherlock frowned, “but more to the point, how did you find out? Mycroft didn't call you did he? I'll hang him if he did.” He looked back to John to check he didn't lie to him as he responded,
You’re welcome. But also sorry in advance. Don’t hate me.
Irene’s evil grin spreads across her face, “I see you decided to breed,” she says, tilting her head in John’s direction.
he thought, but he couldn't get the words out.
— She smirks knowingly as she stares at the new reply beginning to form because the little doctor is likely thinking about all the other things she could have meant. He’ll probably even think about it all night and he won’t know why.
He takes his phone with him as he returns to the living room with Rosie, putting her down as they get there. Rosie wriggles out of his grasp only to grab a large stuffed bee and then come barreling back to the couch asking John to pick her up so she can sit by him and watch her cartoons.
Sherlock chuckled, “You should be flattered, she didn't want you standing there looking gorgeous while she married another man.”
“No.” It came faster this time, more confident.
“You can’t expect me to solve a case if I don’t have all the relevant data!” Sherlock had screamed back, frustrated. He’d mussed his hands through his hair and had growled at her, “I knew you were infuriating but I’ve never thought you were an idiot, Irene.”

First he’d said he was married to his work... and now here he is,
Sherlock smiled ruefully, “Oh detective, if only it were so easy.”
“God, Harriet, you don't care.” John said facing her as he spoke, and pointed at her “You don't give a shit about anyone but yourself, do you? I have made excuses for you ever since father died when you were little but enough is enough.” He finished angrily and started storming out.
John felt himself getting calmer and calmer as he walked with purpose towards Mary, already planning his approach. He was going to grab her, kiss her senseless and tell her exactly how in love with her he was.
“Fuck,” John whispers, his forehead pressed against Sherlock’s for a second time this evening. He pants into Sherlock’s mouth as the other man first presses a finger against the tip of his cock, teasing him and then begins to stroke it slowly and deliberately, his long nimble fingers wrapped securely around it in a perfect ring. “My god,” John gasps while Sherlock jerks him in that same slow pace.
First: this is similar to the dress I pictured, except with the dainty frilled bust and straps. Also the ribbon is not silk. Also there are the little flowers with the slim ribbons. www - pinterest - com/ pin /413557178258098420/
Sherlock hung up the phone and lay back on the couch in his pyjamas and blue silk robe. His eyelids felt heavy. He just wanted to sleep.
Sherlock surprises John again by tightening his arm around her. “She’s fine.” He says simply, and cuts a small piece of egg to feed her. Rosie chews it greedily.
John blinks but then leans down to give Sherlock a light peck on his lips before standing and saying, “Sherlock Holmes, you are a fantastic genius.”
, “Why?” He returns Sherlock’s one-word answers with a one-word question.
Sherlock doesn’t answer. Instead he stands and walks over to his phone and the little Bluetooth radio. He puts on the song for this week’s performance - Frank Sinatra’s “
Irene groans and pulls away from him, “Sherlock, no! I am
John turned to him, frowning “Excuse me?”
“Well... I don't remember it.”
Mary smiled and the table grew silent for a moment. A waiter came over and took away the used plates.
, John, just like that.” Sherlock groaned arching his back and sinking down faster and faster, his own cock bouncing up and down along with the rhythm as they moved. John pushed himself forward then and grasped Sherlock's ass with both hands, pulling him tight against himself and latching onto that long beautiful neck. Sherlock continued riding him and ground his body against John's stomach, reaching between them and touching himself as John fucked him.
“I did
John just laughed and went to change. The next outfit he tried on was a velvet navy blue French frock coat with silver brocade, a white shirt and black pants. Sherlock was laughing so hard tears came out of his eyes.
That's it. I'm done. Fiiiiiinito. *bows* Thank you, thank you it's been a pleasure plagiarizing 90% of a movie for you and then 5% of BBC Sherlock while adding Johnlock.
The nurse looked at John, about to ask him to leave, but John made a b-line towards Mycroft and was at his side in one swift movement.
John clicks on another link. This one is an interview of Sherlock - a sort of introduction of him to the show. John watches in amusement at Sherlock’s antics. He’s a good actor, he’ll give him that, anyone else would be fooled by his false charm and cheery smiles, but John isn’t. That false charm makes his brow wrinkle a bit and really makes him wonder why Sherlock is even on this show. Because there
“The song,” Sherlock explains, seemingly also in a haze.
Yeah. I know. Leaving you here, with this short chapter like this is a dick move on my part. I’m the worst. Muahaha.
Eventually, Tony returns to their table, somehow managing to carry all three plates of food with him; John’s plate and Rosie’s are balanced along the length of one arm and Sherlock’s in the other. Because of this, Sherlock is served first, then Rosie, and finally John.
Week 5: Foxtrot – Habits: Post Modern Jukebox
Sherlock raised a brow and gave a slightly flirtatious smile, “What
ENJOY! (????)
“Okay, right?” John agrees, excited that his lover agrees, and he turns to her to express the excitement.
Sherlock blinks for several seconds, seeming like a deer caught in headlights, “Why… to everything…” he repeats, and John nods, urging him to continue. “Right well I suppose I did say I would explain,” Sherlock mumbles, almost as if to himself.
_________
“Of course it's a set up. Someone is dressing this up to make it look like one of the suicides... the question is, who could possibly know enough about them to be able to disguise them so well? The police haven't released that much information on how it's being done to the general public.”
“It's just... I wanted to ask...” Sherlock hesitated, “... about... her. About... Mary. I- you don't have to... that is... I'm just... curious, I suppose.”
Mary giggled her agreement, “Yes especially when you've got a party to attend and have absolutely nothing to wear.”
He feels his blush burn deeper as he remembers last night (or this morning’s depending on the way you look at it), text conversation – there had been a bit of innuendo in that one as well. John had almost coughed out his lungs as he lay in the guest bedroom texting him last night. The words from his dream make more sense as he remembers just what Sherlock had said, “
. A more accurate statement would be 'most overly romantic women in london rip open that page'. Third and most importantly, I've said it once and I'll say it again, girls are not really my area, nor do I want them to be.”
“You think
“Now!” She repeated as John just stood there, nodding.
Sherlock twists more pasta onto Rosie’s fork and feeds it to her, “It wasn’t necessarily a secret,” he explains, “I just… never told anyone? It’s not like I didn’t use the skill when I got the chance. It just sort of never came up,” and it’s his turn to smirk as he says, “I did try to teach you to waltz, didn’t I?”
“She helped me fake my death and kept it a secret for two years, Iris” Sherlock says, seeming to stumble on the Dancer’s name nervously as he says, pleadingly, “We can trust Molly. I trust Molly. The more help we have the better.”
“Kay.” Jim said and went back to typing.
Fuck, it really was like a punch to the gut.
for the Quickstep - Come back to me by: Frank Sinatra Sinatra
“He lives out in the middle of nowhere, Sherlock, he probably hasn't gotten the mail yet.” John assured him, “
Molly stays.
He emerges from his bedroom refreshed and ready for the day, dressed in an overly large v-neck t-shirt, a light jacket, and soft sweatpants. They’re going to be rehearsing a group dance as well as their rumba today. Sherlock and Irene have to decide on their new song choice since the one on Sherlock’s original list likely won’t do. It’s clear the judges are a bit tired of seeing Sherlock dance to songs about lost love, so he’ll just have to switch it up here and there, or otherwise make sure his and Irene’s routines are perfect. They’re only on the seventh week, after all, and while they haven’t found their Hallward, they’ll need to stay on the show.
He moves to boldly caress her face while he pushes a strand of Molly’s own hair out of her face, “And I’d much rather live in the present,” he tells her.
“Irene?”
John huffs in return, his own breath puffing against Sherlock’s neck before he speaks. His hand is still on Sherlock’s shoulder when he does this and he feels Sherlock give a slight shiver. “This was your idea, you numpty,” John teases.
“Oh!” Molly gasps, hardly being able to believe that the celebrity dancer is in the room with her. “Er, hi, yes, I’m - My name’s Molly,” she stutters.
” John gave his sister a meaningful look.
“Mainly because you’re the youngest and prettiest,” Algy comments from his post on the couch. He gets up and walks over, grinning with an arm around Gwen on one side and the other around Cecily.
"Mmm, go ahead," Sherlock says, a little wrinkle forming in his brow, but his attention still seemingly not on John.
Week 6: Jive – Someone Like You: Paul Mad Gang
“–Oh she’ll have to deal with it,” the dark-haired judge laughs, “It was really refreshing actually, to have you two jive to that song. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen the same tired performance of songs like jailhouse rock–“ Some people in the audience start to grumble but the judge speaks over them - “Not that there’s anything
Mary kneeled in front of her, holding her hand in one of her own, “So... I've no idea how my parents met because as you know, I'm an orphan, but I like to imagine they were married for many happy years even if I didn't get to be a part of their family. I... I've been waiting my whole life to feel the way I always imagined my parents would feel for each other, and for the most part I know I've been busy making something of myself but, I think I miss someone sometimes and Harry... Harry the moment I saw you I knew that we could be great together. So, um... Harriet Watson...” Mary opened the bos with a beautiful ring in it, “will you do me the honour of becoming my bride?”
Sherlock smiles ruefully and looks down at his plate, “yes well…  so am I, if you think about it, so I guess our friendship makes sense.”
“Ah there you are Archie!” Mary popped into John's office, smiling at little Archie, followed by Harry. “This is Archie, he's basically my adopted son.” Mary explained.
and in John’s voice he hears a soft,
You think my life is
“It’s Kate.” She’d said, as soon as Sherlock had sat down at the little table while she had poured herself a drink. Her eyes had been red-rimmed as she’d said it.
! He swallowed against a sudden lump in his throat.
Sherlock laughed nervously, “Yes, well... statistically that was bound to happen... eventually.”
“You practically beg Mycroft for months and now you want to hold it?” Anthea asked.
“So that's what it's come down to then, brother,” Sherlock replied, “making money.”
John stood at attention immediately, “Hi!” Irene gave him a look, he tried to relax a bit but found he was still smiling very wide. John tried to ignore the feeling of his cheeks flaring up and went forward in his greeting. “How was it?” He asked Mary as she entered the office.
John gives Sherlock a look that indicates a slight bit of entertainment, “You know you’ll have to learn her name eventually.” He comments before taking a bite of his food.
“Morning breath.” Sherlock states in his ‘Isn’t it obvious?’ voice.
The nurse gave a nervous squawk in surprise. Mycroft glared at her. “Well? Get going!” He commanded.
Sherlock frowns, still looking at the ceiling and asks, in complete seriousness, “Who in the
“Yes. Heart-shaped, obviously only a romantic could own such an item. The woman in the picture looks young, and bears resemblance to you, but obviously this is a much older photograph. It's in black and white and though she looks like you, she also looks like your sister, but not like both of you for similar reasons. So mother of both and confirming that the woman I saw in the photograph was indeed your sister.
. John isn’t sure he’s ever seen anything like it. He feels his cheeks go red as he tries to open the app to find the video again. He finds his hands are a little shaky and his palms are sweaty as he taps the screen. Dear God… was that really Sherlock Holmes?
Sherlock stood outside the wedding hall making a phone call to his colleague, Molly, at the paper, and taking the occasional drags out of his cigarette. “What time is it now? No... I'm just going to be over there in about four hours so don't –” And then Sherlock saw him again, the Best Man. He'd disappeared for a few hours between the intermission in which the guests and the entire wedding party prepared themselves to move from the church into the dining hall. Sherlock had wondered where he'd gone and had been incredibly surprised to see the man suddenly appear come speech time. At first Sherlock thought that perhaps the man had gone off with one of the guests, during the interim but had found that all guests seemed to be accounted for and then he'd thought perhaps he'd had an appointment of some sort, but now here he was, running out again... “Listen, Molly, I'll uh... I'll call you back...” Sherlock followed John, noticing that he no longer carried his cane as he ran out towards the curb and straight towards a cab.
John blushed a little, “So then, who do you think it was?” John asked.
eidetic.
Sherlock’s blush deepens and he kisses the top of Rosie’s head as an excuse to hide his rouged cheeks from John - despite the fact that John has probably already noticed. John gives him another peck on the cheek followed by one for Rosie and whispers, “I love you. I love you both so much.”
John glared, “Fine, fine, yes, that sounds good.”
“Your little secret. Whatever it is.” John answered, registering a chic looking lamp, and started listing off things, “Your parents got divorced-”
“Need to work on your side of the Church, John it's looking a bit thin.” Sherlock commented as he stared at the wall behind their couch. He was standing in front of it with his hands on his hips and a deep frown of concentration on his face. On the victorian wall-paper Sherlock had pinned all their wedding plans, just like he usually pinned a murder board whenever he and John had an investigation. John raised his eyebrows, from his chair next to the table. He was examining the mail and checking over the seating plan, “The wedding's not for two months Sherlock, people need time to RSVP.”
John had smiled as Sherlock had left that night. He knew as he walked away that Sherlock would be true to his word, and there was an honour in that which John appreciated. Finally, he looked down and picked up the mobile phone, thoughtfully.
“He wasn’t famous back then, though he’s always had money, I suppose,” Sherlock says, shrugging one shoulder, “We think it might have something to do with Dorian’s conservative grandfather, considering his varied sexual preferences, I suspect the old man may have cut Dorian off for a period of time. The point is – we think Henry might have been trying to keep Hallward and Gray apart and if Francis died mysteriously- well maybe he knew something about it?”
John watches as Sherlock goes over to the barista’s counter and speaks to him calmly, gesturing at the baby in his arms. The man calls over a sweet looking waitress who coos over Rosie immediately. Sherlock smiles at her civilly and at once all of the anger is ebbed out of John. Dammit, he was an idiot. He gets up, leaving his coat on the table and sneaks towards the back of the restaurant, through the door he’d seen Josh exit. He finds the blonde man just outside a door down the hall leading to an alley behind the restaurant. The guy is smoking and fingering a piece of paper in his other hand nervously. When he notices it’s John who’s walked out, he startles.
Lastly... it was getting awfully hot in that bar... so i thought, I've
Sherlock is entertaining and John needs a babysitter.
“Nope, never,” John says, leaning slightly so he can talk back, “Sherlock says I can barely do a box step – he told Dorian earlier that I have two left feet.”
Ah. That’s what he meant.
Irene wrinkles her nose. “I suppose asking him what he’s wearing is out of the question?”
“I...” Sherlock stuttered, he had no idea why, but suddenly having his article on John run was the last thing he wanted, “I just... It's not up to par. I'm not convinced it's ready yet. I'd ... I'd prefer to get it right. Perhaps you can hold it for a week?”
’ John smiles, ‘Guess so,’ his inner voice answers.
“Alright, you come here,” Their mother gave Harry a light tap on the arm and held her hand, “Let's go upstairs, Johnny why don't you bring up those groceries, let's see if we can't make something nice for lunch.”
Molly blushes, “Oh god, John I’ve wanted to since I saw it but I just don’t know how to bring it up! ‘Hello Sherlock, is there a reason you’re dressing up in sequinned tights and dancing on live tv?’”
“You’d better,” Claudia teases.
This is also apparently, the wrong thing to say, “And that makes it okay?”
“It was just so old fashioned,” Harry continued, “So we were only able to use a few parts here and there.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “
John rolled his eyes.
On the screen, Sherlock and Irene share a nervous look but don’t argue with the judge. They wait patiently as the audience quiets down when Craig lifts a hand in order to finally speak. “Now you’re still my favorites, and don’t be angry with me, but I’m afraid that this week, I’m going to have to give you seven–” The audience explodes into jeers again, and John feels himself stiffen indignantly on Sherlock and Irene’s behalf, “A SEVEN,” Craig continues, “and I’m being generous. I expect better from you two at this stage, Iris and Sherlock. You’re brilliant dancers, both of you, but don’t get cocky on me, alright?”
John glances sideways at her, but he admits to himself that, yeah, she’s right. John had prayed for Sherlock to be polite but he’s utterly floored by the fact that he was. He honestly expected him to go off on the man on public television. Of course, this is a contest. Sherlock must really want to win if he hasn’t spoken back. To think, the man had had no issue practically flaying a court judge with his words during the Moriarty trial… Well, this was certainly a surprise. “Yeah,” John finally says, “Yeah I did not see that coming,”
“Thought we were on table four...”
“Pick this one!” Rosie says as a new song comes on, a man singing something about being a ‘sucker’.
Sherlock lets his body guide him, feeling as if his heart is beating along to the sound of the music. He’d be lying to himself if he said he wasn’t taking every opportunity he had right now to rub up against John - to touch him the way he’s always wanted to touch him – the way he wished he had during their “not-a-date”. John, on the other hand, is resisting Sherlock’s touches. He pulls away when certain parts of themselves get too close. He moves slightly clumsily to the music, but he doesn’t take a single opportunity to touch Sherlock in return. He simply maneuvers him strategically away when he feels the need to. Sherlock begins to second-guess himself. His movements begin to subconsciously become shyer as they dance their way further into the crowd. Had he been wrong about everything the other night? He’d thought that perhaps John might finally feel something for him in return. Had he just been imagining it? Was it just wishful thinking?
Josh finishes Sherlock’s question for him. “Doing here? I
” John reprimanded. He was stunned that Sherlock spoke ill of a woman who was lying dead at their feet so casually. It was a little unnerving.
Irene lifts a brow, “Shall I ask Molly to bring her?”
“Alright, you can get up now,” the man said, urging John to sit up.
“It's my pleasure!” Mary beamed as Mrs. Watson stood to wipe the tears from her eyes. “You've a couple of amazing children.”
Sherlock ruffles her hair, chuckling,  “Alright, well, I’m sure spaghetti can be arranged.” His eyes are bright when he looks up at John and it fills John’s heart with warmth to see him look so happy. He feels his own expression change to match Sherlock’s as he looks back at him. Sherlock lowers his eyes shyly just as Angelo arrives with their menus, a bottle of wine and a juice box.
John arched a brow at the old woman, “Yes, yes it is pretty hard,” He said in a false friendly tone, “But then I remember that I still get to have hot hate-sex with random strangers of all genders and I feel
“Waiting on someone important?” A deep melodious voice whispers from beside her. It belongs to one of the other VIP guests seated in the same area as Molly. The man is probably in his late forties. He’s quite handsome, with his long and wavy salt and pepper hair, dark eyes and seductive smile, though his lips are somewhat obstructed by his facial hair.
Sherlock enters his flat with his face still flushed red in slight embarrassment. He can hear the shower running and figures his partner from last night must be in there.
(See the end of the chapter for
John laughs. That’s too cute. “That settles it then. We’ll see him later tonight. How does that sound?”
And then John smirks, remembering Sherlock’s earlier confession, “You said you couldn’t tell with me...” he begins, moving up to grin at Sherlock...
). He looked back at the best man, just to make sure he wasn't imagining things. He wasn't. The man was still anxious, still bouncing, and still checking his watch. What could it be? What could be so important he was worried about being late but not so important as to have the man run out of church right this second? Sherlock just couldn't put his finger on it...
“Ugh please–” John cut him off half-way as Sherlock continued, “–believe me–” John raised his voice with a sense of finality, “–you
“No! John, look, please!” Sherlock followed after him and said, “Come here, listen to me,” as he grabbed John's hand and pulled him back to face him.
Before Sherlock can turn around to check behind him an arm sneaks around his midriff and Gray slips into his side like a curly-haired blond snake. The boy leans into Sherlock like he thinks he owns him. John wants to grab him by his scrawny girlish neck and tear him away. He doesn’t — but it’s a near thing.
Henry turns to her, a brow raised, “Oh?” He asks.
“Yeah alright then, careful Mike.” John held in a smile
“You going to see her again?” Archie asked in a very casual and grown-up manner.
“Yeah, okay that's going to happen...” John hung up the phone, “...in your fucking dreams you annoying twat.”
?” He gaped.
---------
Sherlock laughs and Rosie babbles happily when he passes her another tiny piece of his eggs.
“Yes! I’m dancing too!” Rosie confirms.
A few minutes later John was walking into an empty Italian restaurant holding Mary's purse when music began to play, and the musicians started to walk out from behind a curtain. Two waiters unravelled a cloth sign with the words “Will you Marry me, Harry?” On them.
Sherlock looks visibly relieved, “Good. That’s good.”
John takes a cab to the clinic. Now that he’s no longer worried about Rosie, however, he finds his mind wandering to his best friend. He’d said he needed help putting up some shelves? It‘s odd, thinking about Sherlock doing something as mundane as re-decorating, but he supposes Sherlock does have his own tastes. After all, Sherlock was the one who had brought in all of their weird mis-matched furniture, curtains and other Knick-knacks to the flat in the first place. Still it was odd of him to invite the man when he was merely thinking about redecorating. Maybe he works in interior design? John can’t picture Sherlock hiring someone to redesign the space but John decides to shrug it off. Who could ever claim to know what goes on in Sherlock’s head anyway? (Well, besides Mrs. Hudson.) Probably he just needs to make more space for his ever-expanding collection of science equipment. He smiles inwardly, thinking about the fact that the collection has recently expanded to include children’s chemistry sets as well. Sherlock’s enthusiasm for teaching Rosie is heartwarming. John never thought he’d get so attached to her, especially since they were so distant from each other in her early years of life, for a variety of reasons.
“You wanted to get married at St. Audrie's in Father's tux too, I know,” Harry gave John a sympathetic look.
Not beta’d. Not britpicked.
“With the man who bullied me in college, by the way, so I think you get an extra prize for that.” Sherlock smiled ruefully at John.
“This way,” Greg instructs, herding John towards the dancefloor.
“Sorry – sorry,” He shouts at the person he’s stumbled into, turning to steady them.
do this, I
And yes, they went pretty fast, (
“You read my diary?” John frowned at William.
“Clara said she wanted to come back to London with me, of course...” She continued as John led her through the door, “But I told her that I needed space
Greg frowns at that, “Sally…” he warns.
They sat back in their seats quietly for a few more minutes.
Oh this is Getting rather fun, isn’t it?
“I made a list.” Sherlock handed him said list.
“Anything?” Dimock clarified, also standing. He hugged his arms around him and moved closer to John to hide in the sanctuary of the umbrella. The poor bloke looked like he was freezing in his thick rain-soaked jumper.
if he goes on his this John definitely won’t last. He moves his hand to Sherlock’s hair and tugs, gently. “Stop,” he says huskily, “Stop or I won’t be able to stop you, and I don’t want this to end yet.”
His friend nods in approval at the news, “The more the merrier,” he answers before he’s roped into a conversation Irene is having with Henry, who has now seated himself on Molly’s other side and is enthusiastically discussing the production of his newest project.
John couldn't suppress the smile the silly comment brought to his lips. He sighed, “Fine, be a twat. All I'm saying is that this isn't just rubbish, these are the things that Harry believes make-up a life together.”
Sherlock looks back at him after wiping away some spaghetti sauce from Rosie’s cheek, “What do you want to know?”
John made to argue, but then stopped himself. If there was any way he was going to get through that wedding it was going to be with Irene's help and it'd be easier if she were beside him for that. “Sure,” He sighed, “of course.”
pick her up and the evidence is in your trunk. Pink suitcase, and inside it, likely her missing phone.”
Amazingly enough, it’s Sherlock who caves first. He rolls his eyes and sighs out, “Fine – but I’ll be feeding it to you, alright?”
“John is one of my top doctors, and occasionally doubles as my assistant. Kind of like my right hand.” Mary explained.
Sherlock looks back at him just as steadily. He blinks slowly and for a moment, John thinks that his eyes flick down to look at John’s mouth. “Kiss me,” Sherlock murmurs.
“J-John.” Sherlock finally heard himself rasp. Where was John? Where had John gone? Sherlock wanted John back.
“Not that bad? I'd like to see one of them that's not that bad.” Sherlock answered.
“Then, why exactly were you wearing your engagement ring?” Mary asked, getting frustrated.
John arrives at the nightclub in a cab as Sherlock had suggested. He figured it was probably best not to show up in his car anywhere near the celebrity club and risk not being let in by a bunch of snobs, even if Sherlock had promised to come and get him. He takes a deep breath and hopes that the outfit he’s chosen is good enough. He’d decided that since Sherlock hadn’t specified about the club’s dress code that he would go with something simple. He wore a light smoked salmon coloured top with a dark navy jacket and burgundy trousers that stopped just above his ankles, along with chestnut coloured loafers and a matching belt. He’d forgone wearing a tie, thinking it was probably best that he looked laid back. He’d also run just a bit of product into his hair again, though he hadn’t been able to shave his stubble because his shaving kit had been in the master bathroom. He did regret not bringing a coat though, as the night air was somewhat cold.
They were talking even as they walked into the grass and John knew then that it was Sherlock. Though he couldn't hear the words that deep rumble was unmistakeable. When John saw the beam of light move out in front of the two men and something shiny appeared in the distance John found that this place was a bit familiar... in fact it was very, very familiar. John very smoothly got off the bike. He took the radio from the back, the one Dimock had given them and prayed to God in Heaven that the darned thing worked.
Gwen snorts in a very unladylike manner, “Dorian you shady bitch,”
It’s then that John notices they’re near a tight circle of people and that some of them have made an empty space into the dancefloor just as John had seen in the video the boy had posted of Sherlock participating in some kind of dance-off. Shit. John had been internally shaking as Sherlock had begun to dance with him. At first, he’d been unsure. He’d danced against Sherlock but had tried not to touch him, but the bodies around him had pushed them close together and John had felt this heat inside of himself – this wild desire burning him up with Sherlock’s proximity. He had had his face so close to Sherlock’s neck as the man had bent low against him while they had pushed and pushed themselves deeper into the masses. He had wanted so
The lyrics are about the singer asking to be kissed. Technically the song's title translates to "Kiss me a lot."
Sherlock’s face seems to pale at that, but still he says nothing, only nodding minutely for the judge to continue.
“That was so heart-breaking,” the blonde judge, Darcey, comments, “And yet so beautiful and so romantic. I could hardly concentrate on the two of you! There was so much of you in that dance! It was very breathtaking.”
people on planes!” Harry explained, smiling at the gentleman.
It was Sherlock's turn to gap.
Irene just gives him her typical seductive smile, “Do you really have to ask?”
John closes his eyes again. ‘
Eurus encounters True Love
“So…” John’s girlfriend comments as John sits staring at the screen along with Rosie, waiting for Sherlock’s turn on stage. Rosie is seemingly also transfixed, “Whatcha watchin’?”
“Let me guess... a new girl has enchanted our darling Harriet.” John's mother sighed.
“It's okay if you do, John–”
Week 4: Charleston – I’ll never forget you: Post Modern Jukebox
The judges begin talking to them about their performance.
. She’s smart and funny and she helps me feel better when...” Sherlock hesitates (
Sherlock rolls his eyes and says, “Fine,” his exclamation sounding fondly exasperated enough that the rest of the dancers buy it and they all cheer as they come together to chat excitedly before Claudia can bring the other contestants up and the Cameras will be switched on again.
John visibly fumed and his cheeks flared pink, “They're both really good mates of mine and they had their wedding on the same night, what was I supposed to do?”
John hears his mistake as it is repeated back to him and tries to calm the explosion that is sure to erupt at any moment, he raises his hands, placating, “No, Sherlock that’s not what I–”
She’s asked him to write her a song about it, though and Sherlock is a little put off by that. How do you write a song about pleasure and desire for your sister? Sherlock is sure she doesn’t mean her prying to be quite so... invasive, and considering she’s had no proper societal lessons, he’s honestly not at all surprised or appalled by her boldness. Much as she and Mycroft both dislike each other they certainly do have one thing in common - they both have a proclivity for being meddlesome in Sherlock's affairs. Sherlock supposes that at least with Eurus it’s kind of a nice meddling (now that she isn’t actively trying to torture or maim him), and having someone to talk to about these things (in a way), even if she is a little bit... extraordinary is certainly a breath of fresh air. He can never discuss emotions with Mycroft like this without him getting extremely uncomfortable and that, at least, makes Sherlock somewhat thankful for Eurus.
Sherlock had let that comment appear as if it skated off him (though it had given him nightmares for weeks after she’d said it), and had instead smiled and said, “I love you too, sister. Shall we play?”
Molly frowns at Sherlock’s question and says, a little more confidently, “No, so don’t even think about it, Sherlock Holmes.”
“It looks like it,” A woman said.
“Are you sure? I feel like I’m doing brilliantly,” Sherlock teases as he nods his head to the song and lifts his belly so that Rosie will be raised a little off the ground.
“Say no.” William said simply, “You have said no to people before, haven't you John?”
to read it, but you've got rather messy writing, you know, being a doctor and all. You know, they do have these new fangled inventions, they call them 'smart phones' and they take care of everything quite nicely for you.” William informed.
Sherlock takes another soft breath thinking,
Ps. If you haven’t guessed already the movie they’re watching is the 1946 film “It’s a wonderful life” - if you’ve never heard of it (gasp!) the movie is about a really nice self-less man who spends his life making other people happy despite his sacrifices getting in the way of his dreams. At one point he ends up very down on his luck and he decides to commit suicide, thinking everyone will be better off without him. I thought that it rather paralleled Sherlock in that sense. The main reason I chose this film, however, is George’s (the main character) speech to Mary. I think it’s one of the most romantic moments in film history, and that’s nothing to say of the desperate love confession that comes later. If you haven’t seen it and you’re curious, I highly recommend it. It’s sweet, despite its old age. It’s not necessarily a completely romantic film, but it’s a nice one. It’s cute anyway.
John sighs, releasing some of the tension that has taken over his body, “Look, as the man who loves you and the man who put you through so much pain when I should have been there for you - what you’ve done and who you’ve done it with doesn’t bother me so long as none of it has put you at any kind of risk or harm... alright?” He says, looking back at Sherlock, “but I am your doctor after all, so as your
Sherlock groans, “To hell with decent,” he replies, “I want you… and she woke herself up. Practically pushed me in here herself – the interfering old buzzard.”
Sherlock says nothing, and John realizes his hand is still resting on Sherlock’s. He takes it back without being too obvious about it and opens up his menu as he says, “That would be great, thanks.”
“Hungry,” she states with a smile and makes grabby hands for her plate.
John had moved into Sherlock's cozy flat at 221B baker street about five months ago. Since he'd quit his job with Mary at the clinic, he had begun his own wedding planning service. It was going quite brilliantly, actually. Sherlock had gone back to work for Mycroft, but this time as an investigative journalist. John of course, lived a precarious double life planning weddings by day and helping Sherlock solve crimes for his journal by night.
John decides not to text Sherlock asking about the show. He has this biting feeling inside of him that Sherlock doesn’t want him to ask. He does still text him on occasion – normal things – stuff he normally texts Sherlock, such as “Hi, how are you?” or “How’s your day going?” along with occasional photos of Rosie doing something cute. Sherlock, as usual doesn’t respond to most of John’s texts, especially the mundane ones that ask about his day. He’ll text back maybe hours or days later with simple responses.
! That’s him standing there among the other competitors on the screen! This is - well it
” He read, getting progressively more exasperated with each mention of the man's name, “
“That selfish little weasel!” Irene exclaimed during morning Yoga.
The first judge, Bruno, rises from his seat and looks over at ‘Craig’ in understanding – “Oh, yes! I caught that too!” He exclaims.
“Don’t, Irene. I know it’s… but I —Can’t. I’ve tried, I just. I can’t alright?” Sherlock sighs, suddenly very sleepy. “Let’s just go home.”
“Say ‘ah’,” He instructs, ignoring Rosie’s comment.
is what I wanted to wri– John, I wrote that article because you interested me so much when I first met you, and yes, it wasn't kind, because I didn't know you any better then, and I wanted to believe that your beliefs were childish and stupid but I - I did
“I think I just died,” John tells Sherlock.
Sherlock grins charmingly, hoping his relief at the young man’s absence isn’t too apparent. “Ah…  don’t worry about texting him, Henry. I’m sure Dorian won’t be too upset with me if I have a few drinks with you to celebrate before I join him.”
me to get ahead in your career!”
Sherlock made a face of mock-surprise, doing his best to look offended, “John, you wound me! I did
Sherlock pouts slightly, but complies, pulling back and off of John in one last long motion. He kisses the head of John’s cock once more but then crawls back up over John’s body and lays on him. He has half his face pressed against John’s chest and he brings a hand up to trace a pattern on his pectorals.
John rolled his eyes, “Could you stop talking about it so loudly, nobody knows.”
“Oh! Good morning loves!” She coos, “I didn’t realize John had stayed over,” She adds towards Sherlock, though there’s something in the way she says it that makes Sherlock think that she might not be being altogether honest about that.
Sherlock did his best to hide a smirk. He was not succeeding. John glared.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, “I shall never use that word and
“I... you know... William... thank you for bringing back my diary, I really appreciate that–”
His blind faith in Sherlock’s moral character was really quite... sweet. Much like that first night they met, Sherlock continues to just
Molly almost protests, but then Iris takes her hand again and says, “My apologies. He’s right. Please, stay.”
I have a suspect. What do you think all this is
... And then Mary was there, and she was
– but finally, when he’d felt one of Sherlock’s legs come a little too close to him when his hips had almost ground into John’s own to feel the evidence of John’s need for him, John had stopped him. His hands had at once found courage and he’d gripped Sherlock’s hips, holding him at a distance. He couldn’t know – he mustn’t.
“John!” Sherlock startles, “We didn’t hear you come in!”
The woman, Anthea, sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose with her fingertips. “Look... I already told you, I don't know.” She looked over at John, “But it has to have something to do with you. He's not been in since Mycroft promoted him to investigation.”
“Right away, sir.” The cabby answered.
Irene clears her throat, and both men look at her, “Right, well, this is fun and all, but I should be going. Don’t wait up, Holmes,” She directs at Sherlock while starting towards the door. Just before she leaves, she turns and looks towards John and Rosie, “Watson… child,” she says in goodbye.
.” The voice murmurs.
Sherlock is fast asleep. Distantly he’s aware that he’s a little uncomfortable and maybe a little too warm, but he doesn’t feel like moving or stirring just yet, knowing that if he follows the discomfort he’ll be fully awake. Sherlock doesn’t want to wake up quite yet. He might be a little too warm and his neck might feel like it’s developing a little crick that will be there for the rest of the day but he also still feels quite sated. All his John-related stresses are simply not there to disturb him right now. This moment is pure bliss or at least it is until his brain registers some kind of annoying tapping sound. Eventually the tapping sound stops though and Sherlock is relieved to feel his brain falling back asleep.
Sherlock thought for a moment. “I don't think it was the wife,” he said, “But it's clear that Jennifer Wilson and Carter were having an affair. Carter might have an alibi if Time of Death doesn't add up, but that doesn't necessarily mean it wasn't him. I need a bit more information though. This isn't making any sense.”
But Harry wasn't wearing mum's dress or father's suit. She was in a long elegant white-blue dress with thin straps, a light blue top with white lace over-lay, dainty elegant frills on the bust, a blue ribbon at the waist and a cascading chiffon skirt that looked like a rolling ocean wave billowing downwards from where the dart was emphasized with three small fabric flowers along with slim ribbons hanging on the side.* She looked stunning, but John was confused.
“I love her the same way I love Irene.” Sherlock continues, pushing through John’s thoughts, “Don’t you see?”
“Amazing,” John whispers against Sherlock’s skin, “you are fantastic, you are extraordinary, beautiful, perfect, wonderful,” he adds between sucking and licking at him.
John watched him, maintaining the door in the corner of his eye in case anyone left so he could warn Sherlock.
Len smiled, “You're a good man now, Johnny, very clever. I know you won't let me down.”
John smiles nervously, looking up at the upside-down image of Sherlock's face from his position. He pauses, gets his bearings and finally asks, "What did The Woman want?"
me to watch the exit. And how –”
And that's how John found himself running around the pub interviewing people and writing notes for Sherlock Holmes as the people in the pub got progressively more and more pissed. Sherlock had gone upstairs to search for clues as John made most of the rounds doing interviews. John had spotted him come back a few minutes ago though, and saw him interviewing a man by the bar. The man didn't really seem too forthcoming. There was something about him that was vaguely familiar. John frowned. How had this day gone from planning Harry's wedding to illegally crime-solving with Sherlock Holmes, the bloody commitments columnist? He was starting to feel very paranoid.
“Two hundred and forty three. And, yes, Anthea that information is vital! Hundreds of people round the world are either being taken advantage of by their tobacco addicted partners or spouses and just as many are being murdered by them, and they could all avoid such trouble if they simply learned to observe! I'm doing them a favour! Isn't that kinder? The statistics are really quite ridiculous, I know, I did the research, Anthea.
“Yeah, I thought so too, just not quite that... ermm” Harry didn't finish her sentence, eyeing John suspiciously.
John laughed a little, waving him off “It's ok Len. Da used to swear all the time.”
“Oh.” John replies, then he smirks, “because they weren’t me?”
They laughed. And stared at each other for a moment.
“Ah, interesting choice...” The Cabby said, opening his fists, “Well then, Mr. Holmes,
With a happy sigh, John finally comes away from them. “Well.” He says, “better finish cleaning this up or I’ll never do it.”
Next month: Photo of Harry on Mary's desktop screen. (John breaks the syringe he's holding as Mary talks on the phone.)
“Hello. Fine.”
“Mycroft.”
Mary turned her attention to the ads laid out on the desk, “Hmm, I think they're a bit too, you know,” She made a gesture with her hand flicking her nose up.
John huffed out a breath through his smile, “Yeah... horrible, mad, crush. Mad. Absolutely insane,” he sighed, “but you'll be fine Mary.” He patted her arm as he opened the door, “You'll get somebody in this position who will stay for two years, maximum, because that's what acceptable and appropriate–” Mary stopped him then as she crowded in closer to him, pulled his shirt towards her and kissed him awkwardly.
“Yeah okay... Harry...” John said, his face feeling hot as Sherlock turned to look at him with a wide grin on his face.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and spoke into his recording device, “He's slightly delusional and will believe anything he's told.”
“Hush, John!” Sherlock hissed, imploring him with his eyes to remain silent. “DI, Dimock?” Sherlock asked as he noticed the young detective hesitating.
“Hewo awchie and how awe you doing today wickle man?” Harry cooed and pinched his cheeks.
Sherlock shrugs, “If she’s going to be a criminal, she might as well be a good one.”
“You foul fucking snake! You didn't even give me a chance to tell him! He was ambushed!”
. He feels himself vibrating with the pleasure and excitement of it. “Perhaps...” he says, quietly - voice slightly muffled by its place by Rosie’s little arm - “... partner?”
’ Irene types, and breaking her promise keeps the phone out of Sherlock’s grasp for a few seconds while she lets the implication of her words sink into John Watson’s tiny mind. It seems to be working as Watson’s dots appear and disappear on the screen. On the ground, Sherlock begins to tap a finger but doesn’t protest Irene continuing to not surrender the phone.
John can’t help it. He giggles and swats Sherlock’s shoulder, “You’re the one that moved, you wanker.”
Rumor Has It – an EDM remix by David Guetta,
that's it. that's the chapter.
“Huh? Oh. No nothing. It's just sad.” John answered.
Sherlock grins at her, “With all the emotional exhaustion coming from my secret being spilled last week on television I may have welcomed it.” He winks.
“In your dreams,
Harriet's footsteps came clattering back towards them. John looked up and opened his mouth to apologize, as he saw her red-rimmed eyes glistening with unshed tears, but Harry spoke first, “The wedding's off. I hope you're happy.” She croaked and walked away.
“…performing the fox trot this week – Sherlock and Iris.”
Sherlock Holmes.” The cabby said, clapping. “Very good, very enlightening. I suppose it's only fair. You've won... so you get to choose your bottle.” The cabby laughed and put hands behind his back, mixing the bottles up in his hands, he then put both hands forward in fists. “Time to pick your poison.”
His thought is confirmed and his expectations are even surpassed when the man finally starts fucking him. Sherlock loses himself in the heat of it, pushing all memories and thoughts of his recent case with John as far away as he can until he is just Sherlock, living in this moment, feeling everything and his mind is blank, free of all his heartbroken agony. The body against him is warm and strong. It isn’t John, and there was no romance behind it - just pure carnal pleasure, but it is perfect. It is what he wants - what he needs right now. His eyes sting a little but he doesn’t pay them any mind. Instead, he keeps them shut and pulls the warm body of his anonymous lover against him. He holds tightly as the other man fucks him into sweet oblivion. Sherlock comes with a loud shout and his partner quickly follows, collapsing over him. Sherlock puffs and the rearrange each other more comfortably. The other man sighs contentedly and pulls the throw blanket over them, boneless and spent just like Sherlock.
“Just like?” John asked
John nodded awkwardly. He couldn't meet Mary's eye for a second. He knew, after all, how much Harry lied to Mary on a daily basis, and with his constant need to protect everyone, John had said nothing because he feared that he'd end up hurting the people he loved. One way or another it had thus far been best for him to stay out of it, keep his mouth shut... but Mary... Mary was in love with Harriet for being
Sherlock looks directly at Molly with his own scrutinizing gaze and a raised brow while Iris’ wolffish grin grows bigger. “Of sorts...” Sherlock finally answers, giving Molly a suspicious look while Molly studiously ignores not looking at Iris’ almost predatory smile. He holds a hand in Iris’ direction, “Iris, meet Molly, Molly, meet Iris.”
The lovers wake up in each others' arms all cute and sweet and d'awww. And then the shit hits the fan.
. He stormed towards the bar of the little pub and slammed a hand on the counter, “Your telephone is out of order!”
“So far so good. We’re in at least. John is coming. He’ll be texting once he gets here,” Sherlock replies, leaning closer to Lestrade.
“Well what does he want?”
John allows himself to wrap his own arms around Sherlock. He tries not to linger on the thought of his finely muscled frame as his friend holds him closely.“Oh I don’t know,” he comments “You seemed to be doing just fine without me,” and he knows it’s kind of petty but apparently his mouth has a mind of its own..
It was John, he had broken the window with, most likely, the butt of his gun, grabbed the cabby and pulled him through and out into the rain. He had him face down on the ground now, arms pinned to his back, with one hand and with the other he pointed a gun at the man's head. Sherlock gaped. So
Sherlock and Irene drop to the floor of the now-empty studio panting and stinking of sweat. The other competitors had each trickled out pair by pair earlier as the filming had stopped. Eventually, it had just been the two of them left but Sherlock had kept them on a strict schedule of fifteen-minute breaks and then lifting getting back up to dance again. As he lies on the ground now next to an oddly quiet Irene he’s starting to feel regret for pushing her and himself to such an extreme, especially when they had both begun the day exhausted and hungover.
before he finally replies, “No, Dorian, not at all. I’m just feeling a little overwhelmed. There are… a lot of people around,” and technically that’s not a lie.
“Mmmm!” William smiled around the glass as he finished downing it, holding up a finger.
Sherlock hesitated, “... freak.” He said, speaking softly, then, more cheerily “But come on, John! We've a murder to solve.”
John arrives at five minutes past six, having texted Sherlock that he and Rosie were running late. Sherlock, oddly, had replied with a thumbs-up emoji, which should have been his first clue that something wasn’t quite right. When John rings that doorbell with Rosie in his arms and a blonde woman opens the door he suddenly remembers – Irene Adler is in town. He frowns as another realization hits him – she’s staying with Sherlock?
--------
Sherlock blinks blearily and stares at the tray, “Thhhhhat’s breakfast.” He replies.
Irene glared, “There's no sign that says 'no talking.'” She muttered.
“What? Why are you looking at me like that? Did I say something wrong?” He asked, his face flushing in embarrassment.
“Oh, that's easy.” John smiled, “You know when the music starts and the Bride makes her big entrance and everyone turns to look at her?”
Mary visibly relaxed, “Oh good. Any chance he'll actually believe it's from me?”
When John stopped at the end of the hall watching as Archie cleaned the living room Harry spoke quickly, “He was bored and asked me what I thought he should do.”
“Anaphylactic shock?” Sherlock asks Molly of the body as she tries to recover from what she’s just said and attempts to ignore Iris’ mischievous expression at her response.
“I struggled with it for years, my addiction, and I couldn’t be where I am today if not for the faith and support of my good friends. I always thought sentiment was some kind of chemical defect found on the losing side… but it appears I was quite wrong. The love and care I have received from those around me has saved me more times than I could ever count.” Sherlock’s voice cracks and the video ends. John feels a lump in his throat as he swallows at Sherlock’s admission. He’d never said something like that in John’s presence, and it feels wrong to hear him say it on live television like that. He looks so open and so vulnerable.
John and Sherlock sit with Rosie out in the patio of rather swanky café. Their hostess has just left them with the menus and has swept off but not before bringing Rosie something to entertain herself with. Rosie distractedly plays with some crayons the woman has brought her and scribbles with not a single ounce of hand-eye co-ordination all over the blank white paper set as a table cloth before her, murmuring to herself in awe. The men await the arrival of their waiter as their eyes stray to one another over the tops of the tall elegant cards causing them to break out into stupid goofy grins and cut-off eye contact, lest they begin to giggle helplessly.
heheheh) because it's one of those quick and dirty fucks like Jane and Kevin's sexy car moment, so that was intentional. I swear it wasn't me trying to get it over with. I really hope you guys weren't expecting a cutey fluffy romantic adorable scene of cuteness for the sexy because I did
going to get one, you pompous good-for-nothing, cock-sucking,
ps. I have not edited this at all. I'm sleepy. goodnight.
John lies awake all night after bringing Rosie home. His inability to sleep tonight confounds him. He was sure that after the exhausting case he’d had with Sherlock that he’d be more tired by now, but he just can’t shake this odd feeling that’s been with him ever since he and Sherlock had been on this recent case.
“Uh huh”
Sherlock yawns, suddenly very tired. "You'd better," he mumbles sleepily.
“Nice.” John answered sarcastically, then added, with a hint of wickedness in his voice, “Let's stick her by the bogs.”
“Ugh... how sweet.” Irene commented as they separated. “Sickeningly so.”
Sherlock saw then that John would never forgive him. He felt his throat constrict and he knew his eyes must be glossing over right about now. He looked back behind John's face in an attempt to hide the distress he felt and a quiet sound, almost like a breath and a sob escaped his lips as he looked into John's clear blue eyes for what he intended to be the last time and began walking away.
“You got them champagne glasses and a bottle of crystal” John reassured her.
John looked at the way her face lit up when she said the name.
“Same club as the first night?” She asks in her accented voice.
Sherlock chuckles and calls back, “As if she fully understands you yet,” and he begins their descent down the stairs.
Molly groans. “I don’t know, John,” She explains, “All I know is, I was watching the introductory episode two weeks ago when you asked me to watch Rosie and there he was! At first I didn’t really want to believe it but then I saw that it was actually him and then I couldn’t not watch it - I mean it’s Sherlock and, and, and,
John scowls, “Well then what the hell is he? Why were you sleeping with him?”
“Aren't you meant to be gay?” John sighed.
All my love,
”- and then returns to Irene, who is still kneeling on the floor. He raises an eyebrow and offers her his hand. ‘
She wrings her hands in her lap, barely concentrating on the show and even missing the big musical celebrity number as she considers whether or not to tell John when he comes home to get Rosie. Would Sherlock be terribly upset with her if she told?
Sherlock puts on a thoughtful expression, “Hm…” he starts, “How long have you known Henry?”
“No, nope. None taken,” John laughed, “It should feel... when you're with the person you're meant to be with there should be–” He tried to explain, but couldn't think of any words to describe what it should feel like. All he knew was that he'd felt it once before, and it was not with Mary or any of the girls or lads from the army he'd been with, but like it was when... when he'd kissed...
’ he hears a voice in his head tell him. The voice sounds suspiciously like Mycroft’s).
John shakes his head, passing her back her mobile. “Sorry,” he says, “Sorry, I guess I’m just...”
go by without a teensy weensy bit of vengeance. If he does, then clearly he doesn’t know her very well. She takes the device the first chance that she gets. Sherlock is asleep, but unlike Irene, he doesn’t hide his phone from her. Why would he need to? He leaves the thing on his bedside table before they turn in for the night. At first, Irene thinks he’s trying to tempt her. Later she learns that he actually just doesn’t care. He doesn’t often use it. Either way, she decides to steal the phone despite his lack of care for it and she snoops through it every chance she gets.
“At this point I'll believe anything...” John said. Of course
“Ah, so you admit that believing in marriage is like the childish belief in Father Christmas?” Sherlock gave John a triumphant smile,
John smiled at her indulgently and wheeled the rather large suit cases stacked on top of each other into the hall.
Henry laughs, apparently seeing right through Sherlock because his eyes smile with a secret mirth while he says, “Yes, of course, my dear man, take all the time you need,” then he adds, “Of course, you know, when he finds out I didn’t contact him immediately after you arrived I shall have to blame you entirely for it.”
Greg has been working on talking to a few of Henry’s music industry friends and a few people who went to Oxford with them, just to see what they can tell us about Henry’s character or about any observations in their relationships. Molly is working on talking to Henry himself. He hasn’t left her side all evening, and Sally is sort of floating around making sure Molly isn’t alone with him in case he tries something, but hopefully Molly can get something out of him.
!”  The hostess of the show, Tess, begins as the screen turns to her while she stands with the microphone next to Sherlock and Irene.
--------------
“Eurus, I’m not-“ Sherlock tries,
“Sure, yeah,” John answered as a waiter came up to them and offered them some hors d'oeuvres, “Oh! Look!” John said, grabbing one in false excitement, “Pigs in a blanket! Want one Harry?” He asked, shoving it under John's nose.
Sherlock smiled at John then, “Oh very good John, you follow.”
Sherlock complied.
to do. You like to help people while they put their lives together... I... enjoy solving the puzzles they leave when there's no way you can ask them for a clue. Sometimes, if I'm lucky there's also a sort of justice for them once I've solved it. Admittedly what I always cared for more, was always the game, but... the results, if I'm successful, I find I... well. It's good if things end well.”
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Sherlock chuckled and waited for the serious answer.
Sherlock stood there confused with the drink in his hand as he watched Doctor Watson limp his way through the crowd and open a door at the nearest side of the club.
but I suspect it may also be because her own brother is still so close with Dorian. Now, tonight… I think I last saw Jack at the bar downstairs...”
He’s said in disbelief.
“I know!” Sally repeats, her voice a mixture of excitement and disbelief, “He’s on again tonight, and look – apparently, he’s been doing this for five weeks now! The one you’re watching now is from last week, he performed a Charleston, and the week before that a quickstep – but it’s the salsa one you’re going to wat to really see.” Sally takes the phone back and taps the screen until the right video comes on, then turns in back for Greg to see.
“Here!” DI Dimock's voice shouted in the distance, “That's my bike! They must be around here!”
successful relationships?” Harry spat.
“Sherlock? Sherlock Holmes?” John's voice sounded fuzzy and distant.
Sherlock’s eyes sparkle with mirth as John rolls his eyes and gets on his knees as well. They take turns twirling and dipping her around the room, neither man unable to hold back a grin.
His girlfriend nods in agreement, “Especially after that bullshit score. I mean, I haven’t seen his other performances, but I’ve seen other people do jives on Strictly before and from what I just saw, Sherlock would decimate any of them.”
“There's no such thing as chance, John. It was a nice deduction, on your part, even if it was an unconscious one. Shot in the dark, perhaps, good one, though. For someone who has little insight into himself, you managed to –what's that saying?– 'hit the nail on the head'?”
Sherlock raises a brow at her, “If you think I’m falling for that, Watson, you have another thing coming,”
marriage, but also her own. You'd seen the ring on her finger when you'd picked her up. She was dressed all in pink, like on her wedding day, when she lied to your sister's face and told her she was wrong... but you knew your sister wasn't. Everyone in town knew. They weren't exactly subtle, Jennifer and Carter. But you killed Jennifer, not because you didn't hate Carter for hurting your sister, but because you knew that even if you killed Jennifer here, it'd be more difficult to suspect you. You've only killed in London so far, so you knew that if the police thought this was a suicide much like the London ones they still wouldn't link this death to you, because after Jennifer you planned to go back to killing in London and she would be an outlier in your only established pattern. The police would see this incident with Jennifer as not only a set-up but an inside job as no one other than the police and the killer could know the details of the case so well. Your brother in law would be implicated for Jennifer's murder because of his affair with Jennifer and after her death you'd get them both away from hurting your sister ever again.
“Bit not good, yeah.” John said.
The hostess moves down the line to two other judges, both female, whom both say similar things, clapping proudly. When the hostess reaches the last host, a more severe looking man… John thinks he had at some point read that he was called Craig, or something like that? – ‘Craig’ stands and claps.
Ever since Eurus Sherlock has decided to start exploring himself emotionally and physically. He’s realized that shutting down his emotions as he’d been doing before is not healthy for him and that suppressing his desires is equally harmful. Eurus has helped with that, in her own way. She has shown him what free reign of his emotions could do to him and to others. He always feels drained when he visits her for that reason. Eurus, unlike Mycroft, to put it mildly, is extremely mischievous (read: chaotic). She encourages Sherlock to free himself emotionally through their music and also through short conversations.
Ps. I’m planning a short epilogue with Eurus, btw. Hopefully it gets done, but if it doesn’t, enjoy this as your ending chapter. The smut and copious kisses are my gift to you. Thank you for your patience, love and support of this short story.
that needs to be wooed. I told you, Sherlock, this is what I do. I know what people like. He’s a soldier, I think the wooing could be a little less gentle, but since it’s
“I'm so sorry about that!” John looked absolutely ashamed, “I will personally–”
Sherlock attempts to protest but Irene silences him with a quelling stare. He’s not afraid of her. He could take the phone if he wanted to, and break several of her delicate bones in the process, but he won’t. She’s crazy, but aside from John, Molly and Greg, she’s one of his favourite people. He sighs and lies down mumbling, “Fine. One thing.
Sherlock feels a lump in his throat at John’s kind words. There are too many emotions running rampant inside him right now. The pain of memories loss, the shock of victor’s loss still fresh within him because he never allowed himself to suffer for it before. The heartbreak at Eurus’ betrayal and mental health - her torture of himself and of his friend’s haunting him til now. But worst of all is the longing he has for the love of John Watson. He turns away from the doctor, looking resolutely at the screen instead of answering him. He can’t talk about it right now. He’d break down. He knows he would, and today had been such a lovely day after he’d come home from Eurus. Waking up to John and little Rosie was like a dream. And John had even made him breakfast in bed! Sherlock didn’t want today to end, ever.
“BAH!” Rosie interrupts, pouncing on Sherlock’s stomach and effectively bringing him back down to earth. Leave it to Watson to lighten the moment. Sherlock inwardly thanks Mary for giving them a Rosie, even if her doing so had broken Sherlock’s heart a little at the time.
Irene glares at him but Sherlock just gestures towards the mirror above the mantel. Irene stands on Sherlock’s chair to get a better view of herself in it, growls in frustration and stomps to the bedroom —presumably to retrieve her necklace. Lestrade turns back to Molly with an appropriately amused look which she returns.
“Er...?” John blushed.
Sherlock smiled at everyone and, having successfully garnered the entire bar's attention, he addressed them all loudly, spreading his his arms out to his sides in an friendly manner telling them, “As I said, there's no need to panic. Everything is under control. The police are handling it, please everyone, just go back to your evening, everything will be okay.”
“You have got to be bloody joking!” Irene broke pose to look John in the face.
“Hope you don’t mind,” he breathes against Sherlock. “That was- you were... fuck! Can’t talk and I definitely can’t move right now.”
“Sure,” John answered distractedly, then realized his mistake as William drank form his glass, “NO!” He exclaimed.
“As I said. They still talk about you. You've a very unusual look, for a crime-fighter, almost like you're daring for retaliation. The arrogance. But tonight your hubris will destroy you. It's no secret you daylight as a love journalist and moonlight as a vigilante detective. I even read some of your articles. I know who to avoid if I don't want to arouse suspicion. But you got in the car with him. Saw him home safely, despite your grumbling. And when he left and you gave me the address, the London Journal, I knew for sure it was you. True I could have ended this then, but I had no reason to. In fact, in all honesty I still don't really want to do this. See I know, even if you won't admit it now, that you do believe in the same thing I do. I know it because I saw the way you looked as I drove you home after meeting him that night. The way you looked at him this very night confirms it. But... You leave me no choice, Mr. Holmes. I didn't want to do this to either of you.”
-------------
But John made the mistake of looking into her eyes as he said it, she looked so in love,
John climbs up the stairs to 221B, a sleeping Rosie in one arm and her day bag strapped over the other shoulder. Remembering this morning John knocks on the door and listens carefully for any noise inside.
“Alright geez! Alright!”
for not seeing it before. Dammit Sherlock, he thinks, what did they do to you?
John jumps slightly, but smirks as he turns around, “Hello, Detective Sherlock Holmes,” he greets as he turns around to fully appreciate the sight of Sherlock’s naked and soon to be wet body. He lets his eyes bore every bit of heat he’s feeling for the man into those observant grey irises.
Sherlock chokes, “Why?” He sputters, “What d’you mean
“But if I didn't–,” John tried,
The swiftness with which the other had retrieves the items is almost comical but in Sherlock’s current state, he is glad of it. Soon the man is making Sherlock keen and grasp at the fabric of the throw blanket sitting on the back of the couch. The man is slow and methodical as he prepares Sherlock teasing him lightly and keeping him just on the edge of pleasure. Oh, he had chosen well tonight.
John just shakes his head, whispering, “Dunno,” and continues to watch the dance while Rosie giggles and bounces along to the quick rhythm. The audience on the screen cheers and claps at the impressive dancing couple. John is amazed at the wide grin on Sherlock’s face despite what the lyrics of the song imply. He watches in astonishment as Sherlock and Irene make one final spin and end the song with Irene feeding a cherry to a cardboard cut-out of a man behind the prop bar and Sherlock leaning over the other side of the bar, a hand under his chin watching her, both panting and still grinning.
As the men attempt to distract themselves by staring at anything but each other, clearing their throats in a transparent show of both shyness and excitement, a voice interrupts them saying, “Hi, welcome to our café, I’ll be your waiter, my name is –” and as the two men begin to turn their attention towards the speaker. The owner of the voice – their waiter – gasps in recognition, “Sherls?” He asks.
“You're right Carter. Here are the keys. You can take the car. Drive safe. I'll ride out with Fred when he gets here. And here're the keys to the house– just let yourself in.”
Just as he’s about to start panicking John replies to Sherlock’s text,
“MOLLY!” He gasps with a large nervous grin, shoving the person that’s with him behind his back. “Doing an autopsy at this hour?”
John is secretly pleased that Sherlock is so opposed to the idea that he could date Dorian. He’s especially pleased because not once has Sherlock ever made that argument in regards to John whenever it’s been suggested that they might be together. It could mean nothing at all, but it still pleases him. “He’s never going to let that go,” John tells Sherlock, teasing.
John kissed his mother as she walked away while Sherlock raised an eyebrow at Mycroft, who bowed subtly and took Mrs. Watson's hand as they descended the steps of the Chancel towards their seats.
“Heh, yeah.” John turned back towards his office as Mary closed the door to hers. Irene followed him in, “Oh. My. God. John Watson, you poor soul,” She commented.
Sherlock, without noticing he’s doing it, leans forward on the table, a hand under his chin as he squints at John, challenging him in return, “Really, John? Confident in your ability to do that are you?”
“Okay, no worries, I'll uh, get them from the doctor myself.”
“That girl from Cardiff? The one in the pink?” Another voice shot out.
“...so thanks John!”
John considers firing off a text to Sherlock to ask him about it but as he unlocks the screen on his phone he notices the time. It’s well-past midnight and while John is sure Sherlock is awake (especially if this
Sherlock gives Molly that funny little smirk that makes her heart skip a beat. “I’m sure I’ve no idea what you mean, Molly.” It was nice, this. Molly was glad that their friendship had recuperated since that phone call years ago. She can’t imagine what it would be like, not seeing Sherlock in her morgue just waiting to filch some body parts for his many odd experiments.
He tries not to look too forlorn as John’s hands keep Sherlock’s hips firmly at a distance from himself, pushing him firmly through the dancefloor. He tries not to look at him as his mind conjures images of John holding his hips firmly for a different purpose. Of his hands pushing Sherlock away in a different setting, only to pull him back and – oh, god he really needs to stop thinking about this. Damn Irene and damn Molly for putting these thoughts – these hopes back into Sherlock’s head. “
Mary nodded.
Molly continues to humming her song as she finishes stitching the Y incision on the body up. As she cuts that last thread she hears muffled voices coming towards her from down the hall.
Sherlock, I mean it – I – It's been a while I-I –
Sherlock, when he finally opens his own eyes almost chokes. He definitely loses his footing and he hears Algernon and Jack cheer for John behind him, wolf whistling as John removes the jacket he’s wearing and tosses it aside, moving into Sherlock’s space without quite touching him, looking as if he’s five seconds away from doing so. Sherlock finally regains composure after mentally shaking himself. He steps close to John, daring him to touch him, begging him with his mind to please open his eyes. But John is facing the floor, almost as if feeling the music deep inside of himself. Sherlock frowns and steps closer. John gasps and Sherlock feels his breath even through his shirt. He leans over John while he moves deeper into John’s space and pants against John’s neck. John gives another gasp but this time the gasp is followed by a growl.
“Hmm,” John intones, his nose drifting over Sherlock’s shoulder as the other man rubs his cheek against the side of John’s face. “Well, Consulting Detective Holmes… I hope,” he pauses to kiss Sherlock’s shoulder, “That you didn’t wake up the landlady just so you could come in here…” another kiss, this one on his neck, “because that might be considered by some…” this kiss is on Sherlock’s jaw, “to be a bit not decent.”
.” Sherlock heard the click of a gun from behind him.
rings in his mind on an echo as he awaits Sherlock’s next message. The echo only breaks when his phone dings with Sherlock’s next response.
“Delete– Sherlock, how can you not? It was the anniversary of the father's death, the groom had been previously wounded in Afghanistan in a tragic accident involving crows, and the bride stuck by him even through all the death threats – you cannot fake emotion like that!”
Sherlock and Irene nod politely as Algernon runs downstairs.
“Oh?” Sherlock asked, giving John his shot.
“Come here.” John instructs Sherlock, shifting so he can reach for Sherlock’s face. He has a sudden overwhelming urge to kiss the skinny bastard.
does. Your gross exaggeration of that fact is not only incorrect but incredibly sexist, and quite frankly I am appalled if not offended on your sex's behalf." (Molly smacked him playfully at that as Sherlock smirked and dodged the hit), "Second, you overestimate how far our readership actually reaches. We're the London journal, Molly.
. “Heyyyy.” Sherlock greeted suddenly feeling awkward.
John spent half of the morning seeing patients in and out of his office, calling up that doctor for those missing x-rays and looking all over his office for that damned diary. He had a back up of his schedule on his computer calendar, of course, but he needed to see some notes, and quite frankly he preferred having something physical to write in.
John releases a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. He grins widely and takes a step towards the two people he loves most in the world.  “Yes, yes I think that’s alright,” he says in a hushed tone. He reaches a hand towards Sherlock, who slowly brings his face back into view, revealing an adorable pink dusting on his cheeks, the remnants of a blush. Sherlock takes John’s hand and pulls him forward until their foreheads touch and their lips are only a couple of inches apart.
Gladys giggles and finally speaks, grabbing hold of Sherlock’s other side, “That’s right Algy. You shall be quite sorry. Come, boys, let’s go step into the circle.”
Also: I've changed the setlist... AGAIN – I think I'll create a playlist on youtube or Spotify when I finish writing the fic with only the songs I'm using. I have a playlist right now but it's gotten messy with all the ones I wanted to add.
The clip shows Sherlock in a dark suit with a long black bedazzled coat and a shiny purple shirt beneath the black suit jacket between the shirt and the coat. He is smiling insincerely and running down some stairs from among a few other people (John correctly assumes they are other contestants) to stand by the blonde hostess. The audience claps and cheers, many holding up ‘I -heart- Sherlock’ signs and wearing deerstalker hats. John wonders how they even knew about this when he didn’t know a thing and is again a little hurt about being excluded. Still he watches curiously, recognizing this as likely being the video Molly had shown him a clip of earlier.
John stood uselessly between the two of them.
Finally, Sherlock asks, still not looking at his phone, “so what was it? Another cheating life-partner?” His eyes twinkle in mischief as he looks to her for an answer.
“...no” The Cabby rolled his eyes. They made it back just in time.
Harry gasped, “Oh! Mother! They're both so perfect! Oh mum... thank you! Really it's an honour!” She stood and wrapped her arms around her mother tight.
“Finally,” John whispers to Sherlock, looking up at him with a tired smile.
Irene squeals, claps her hands happily, and gives an uncharacteristic, “Yay!”
were a
Irene and Lestrade make space for Sherlock and Molly to sit near them. Sherlock chooses a spot beside Greg so that Molly can sit with Irene. Lestrade is seated in a laid back pose, both arms resting on the back of the seat, one hand curled protectively towards Irene to continue the illusion of dating her.
” Sherlock’s rhythmic gestures beg for his paramour to join him below. In response, she bounces her way down the steps as the prop rotates and she climbs down to clasp hands with him. She places a delicate hand on his arm while he holds her waist and grasps her free hand in his, and they hop into their hold to twirl about the stage. They make wide arcs around the dance floor, never missing a beat, never missing a step. Their hold is relaxed and perfect. Sherlock can’t help but grin as he and his partner move gracefully around the area. He’s thankful for the extra practice time he’d insisted on because they are sure to do better today than they did last week. It’s absolutely transparent that they will be scoring high tonight, especially with Sherlock’s new plan on faking his passion for his partner.
been telling
Sherlock is watching John intently now, a confused wrinkle on his brow as John looks back, his eyes calm and inviting while at the same time managing to look like they’re hiding a storm behind them, wild and ready to bear down on Sherlock at any moment. His lips are equally inviting, curved upwards in a small sensual smile. Sherlock feels a shiver down his spine.
The stage is bathed in bright blue and white lights. They wear classic looking ensembles for tonight’s performance (Sherlock in a tuxedo with some tasteful extremely thin flecks of dark blue glitter smattering the black suit and his partner in a long white dress with light flecks of silver glitter) and as the loud trumpets and the strong romantic voice fills the room Sherlock begins dancing to their arranged choreography in the center of the stage by a large prop building while his partner sits on top of it, as if she were dining on a roof top patio, wiggling her shoulders to the tune.
John sits on the couch, staring at Rosie without really looking at her, his mouth agape.
“But back to your question... no matter who I marry, I want people to look at my partner.” John's eyes twinkled with a little bit of self-depreciating mischief, “Please make sure that poor sucker is either still standing there, or still making her way towards me.”
The third week of that month: Photograph of Harry and Mary with the london eye in the background on Mary's desktop screen. (John gives up on Mary doing any of her paper work that day.)
“I know, mum,” John answered, “But I'm telling you she really doesn't want to speak with me.”
“Nonsense, nonsense, your money is no good here, you know that,” Angelo argues with a grin.
Also, there's a lot of dialogue in this one.
So, when John’s girlfriend decides that they should take a trip Dublin with Rosie in order to attend a conference with many of their colleagues, John agrees immediately. Being away from London for a bit will at least keep him from the temptation of following up on Sherlock’s activities, or worse finally cracking and deciding to go visit him. John packs his and Rosie’s things and they leave the city to be away for at least a couple of weeks.
John glared at Sherlock and pulled his arm back and using it to punch Sherlock in the face, shoving him back a few paces on the pavement. “No, Sherlock! No! You don't touch me! You don't
Noticing his silence Harry turned to him, upset, “Uh... you
“You know her?” Dimock asked, crouching down beside Sherlock. John moved to stand over them with the umbrella, if only so they'd get less wet.
He asked himself in his mind as he read through them.
“Lucky him.” Harry flirted. John smiled before her words registered then gave her a look.
“Even if it’s a verified fact?” John teases.
“Oof!” Sherlock grins and removes his arm from his face in order to reach down with both hands and pick her up, holding her up high and then bringing her down for a kiss on her chubby little cheek. She giggles happily and returns his kiss with her own sloppy kisses. Sherlock sits up again, happy toddler in his arms and finally dares to look at John. He doesn’t know what else to say so he just murmurs “Thank you, John,” his tone coming off more timid than he thought it would.
This makes Sherlock laugh, and his soft baritone chuckle brings with it a storm of butterflies that burst around in John’s stomach, “I suppose you’re right,” he says, then adds, as an afterthought, “Do you remember the time he brought us the giant sh–”
“Right... you're terrified.” John said flatly, setting down the mugs on the coffee table and sitting next to Sherlock.
He once again lifts his drink in the air to cover for the fact he doesn’t much feel like smiling brightly with them all. Dorian seems satisfied though, as he instantly posts the photo online to his private social media account. “Can’t share much on the public one because of the Strictly contract, but I think i might take a few pictures for the official PR page later,” he says, by way of explanation when he catches Sherlock looking, then, putting the phone away and his empty glass by the bar adds, “Do you want to dance?”
?” Sherlock sputters, incredulous.
The song was pure joy. It was the golden light of the sun on a summer’s day. It was the magic of the first snowfall of winter. It was the blossoms blooming in spring. It was the warmth of cinnamon and the crunch of leaves beneath your feet in the fall. It was beauty and life and freedom. And it was more than that as well. It was pleasure, such as she had never known. It was an euphoria so pure and yet so bold and scorching with the flame of desire. The song carries with it a feeling such as Eurus has never experienced herself. The closest emotion she could mention is the feeling of her brother’s arms around her when he’s finally solved her puzzle and saved her from herself, but even that feeling was nothing compared to the purity and the sheer joy of this song and she certainly felt no desire for him in that way. No, this song was special. This song was what the other composers, the ones she’d thought she understood, aspired to create. It was a masterpiece, and it brought tears to her eyes in a soft envy.
“Holy shit,” John’s girlfriend comments, “if they didn’t literally call him by his name or label it on the screen I almost wouldn’t believe it’s him.”
“He's your number one fan!” Harry continued and finally caught a look at John's face as Sherlock's smile faltered while he looked at him. John looked mortified. “–Oh!” She exclaimed, misunderstanding, “Not in a creepy way, though!”
John thought as the women scattered away.
“Nothing in particular, John, I assure you. What do you need?”
John returns. He and Sherlock have a bit of a long-standing joke. If Sherlock ever says anything that implies a sort of failing on Rosie’s part (impossible, as Rosie is perfect), John threatens him with death as is his duty as a protective father.
to be
Sherlock shrugs, “Honestly I was thinking you could help me play along with a little ruse – it’ll probably work best if he thinks I’m drunk. I should get more alcohol before we go get him.”
Sherlock allows the boy to latch himself onto his side as he’d been doing the whole evening earlier. He lets the emptiness of John’s distance be replaced with the warmth of Dorian’s admiration. And while, yes, Sherlock finds his attentions a tad bit annoying, he’ll take them right now over being pushed away.
They stuck their mobiles out of the window.
Sherlock feels his cheeks glow for what feels like the hundredth time this morning and he finds he’s still grinning stupidly when he replies, “Yes, well. They came over after he picked Watson up from yours yesterday. He made dinner and then we watched a film. He... stayed quite late and Rosie was asleep so... He’s having a shower at the moment and then we’re taking Rosie out for breakfast.”
On that note, I feel I should warn that Sherlock, John, Irene, Molly and yes, the Wildean characters, are all a bit OOC in many parts but in my defense, I'm also writing a completely unrealistic scenario of Sherlock being invited onto Strictly comes dancing so like... gimme a break. Also, I've never actually watched Strictly I just know it's similar to Dancing with the Stars (which I've also never seen HAHAHAHA) but I knew it was a thing and I really wanted to write it so... here you are. I'm sorry if I messed it up but also I'm not that sorry, sorry.
me.” John’s grin feels like it’s been permanently fixed to his face. Sherlock blushes prettily but doesn’t respond. John’s smile grows wider and he hungrily takes another deep kiss from Sherlock’s lips. He feels almost drunk on the taste of him as he tells him, “I love you too, Sherlock. You know that now, right? You
And again, because Sherlock was an
“Hmm.” Sherlock said quietly, looking at the door to the pub.
“Jesus Christ Irene you're going to kill us!” John screamed.
“Sure?”
because she said she didn't want to deal with a
“Excuse me,” Mary smiled and walked back over to her friends.
Sherlock topples a little and Rosie climbs up on his stomach giggling and bouncing, yelling, “Up, up, Sherrock, get up!”
John let her, and kissed her in return. This is what he'd been waiting for all this time... this was what he'd wanted all these years... but... somehow, even as her lips brushed against his he felt nothing. It felt odd... and wrong... somehow.
” John spoke over Sherlock loudly, “that Harry'll take out whenever Mary sends her flowers, just because she felt like it.”
“Forget it! I'll fix it when we get there! Drive!” John urged as he put on his seatbelt.
_____________________________________
Sherlock’s shy smile turns into a full-blown grin and he stands up to pick up Irene and twirl her round in a circle before putting her down and kissing her cheek.
“It’s lovely,” John comments softly, “the song, I mean.”
Suddenly he looked up and noticed the silence in the alley as well as a bunch of smokers staring at him. John blinked and felt himself flush in embarrassment.
Sherlock is finally broken out of his reverie when Rosie awakens with a soft cry. She calls out for John at first, then seems to recognize she’s in Sherlock’s home.
“Ooooh, you're looking quite delectable tonight, John,” She teased, taking a sip of her vodka, “I might even want a bite,” She smiled and clicked her teeth as she bit the air in a provocative manner.
Sherlock hesitates, “it’s not that simple,” he replies.
Sherlock has turned his face back towards Rosie as he allows her to cover him in slobbery toddler kisses, but his brow wrinkles in slight confusion at John’s words, “Client?” He asks quietly, still looking at Rosie.
“Obviously,” comes Sherlock’s deadpan response.
Right on cue, Irene – while dragging Greg along with her – makes a b-line to Henry’s wife, Victoria, who is seated with a few people nearby. She puts on her false heavily Russian accent and calls, “Victoria, my dear friend, how are you?”
. “Fine.”
John moans at the feeling of Sherlock working at him.
“Sherlock, there's a woman lying dead somewhere in the rain.”
Harry gave her an appreciative look that said everything she thought about the idea of Mary wearing nothing and answered with a giggle, “Right.”
he’d said in response to John’s query about girlfriends, yet he and Irene somehow had an odd relationship that John wouldn’t categorize as lacking in sexual tension. Still, Sherlock never denied being gay whenever it was implied… John didn’t know what to think. Add to all that the picture of Sherlock with the young blond boy with his hand stuck in his shirt and laughing and John’s mind found itself in complete disarray.
“I'll have another Scotch.” Sherlock asked the bartender.
John smiled, his expression shy, “If you'll let me,” he said, then his expression grew bold, “And if you don't, I'll tell him anyway.”
“Always?” Sherlock inhales after asking the question, turning his head slightly towards the man to give him a questioning glance.
“Oh, dear god, let me think...” Sherlock rolled his eyes, “The bride wore a gown that sparkled like the groom's eyes as he saw her approaching through a shower of rose petals... or something equally as preposterous.”
“How are you two feeling?” Claudia asks. Irene barely stops herself from glaring as the woman pulls away.
High heeled footsteps announced the arrival of Harry before she spoke “Hi, Mary, so sorry I'm late I-”
John doesn’t respond. He keeps his eyes glued to the screen, watching the dance unfold. He’d wondered if Sherlock would continue with his so-called “Heartbreak Theme,” this week. It appears as if things with Irene aren’t going as well as Sherlock might hope if this week’s song choice is any indication. Still, they seem to be very in-sync in their dance. Sherlock expertly lifts and spins Irene, both kicking their legs in the iconic rock-and-roll style movements while the singer continues in his deep country tones to sing his cover of this song. “
“Hmm...” John gave Harry a knowing look and put his arm around her, “Come on I parked in P9” he said, letting the man continue to carry Harry's luggage. Harry giggled and followed John along, gesturing the man to follow.
Sherlock's phone rang. He was smirking before he even confirmed his suspicion. “What did I tell you?” He winked and showed the screen to his friends, “Right on schedule... Hello, you've reached Will Scott.”
Finally John seems to understand. As Sherlock kisses him desperately once more, he gets it. Sherlock doesn’t want to think about it. It’s probably too painful a memory and if John can give this to him to help him forget, even for a little while, then he will. He’ll do everything he can to show Sherlock how much he loves him. He grasps onto Sherlock firmly, pulls him over his body and begins running his hands over Sherlock’s skin again, his hands rubbing lightly at the side of his ribs and then spreading over his back. He sucks on Sherlock’s neck, bites the end of an ear, licks inside his mouth, nips at his lips, clings to him and writhes against the other man as he responds with panting and groaning. He feels his cock begin to swell again and Sherlock’s stiffness is there against his leg.
“Come on,” Sherlock finally says around a smile, tapping John’s shoulder and straightening up his body, “Shove over so I can get clean. We won’t make it to breakfast if we dawdle any longer.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Kiss me, kiss me a lot, kiss me as if this night were the last time,"
“Couldn't you just ask me what you want to ask me now? Or would you prefer to lie some more?” John gritted out.
Irene stopped swirling in the chair and looked at him, raising an eyebrow, “Twice.” She declared, “Tell me that cute little crush is the reason you work yourself to the bone, because it's a little disturbing.”
“You're a dick.” John said.
The boy grins excitedly and finally detaches himself from Sherlock to jump into John in an unexpected hug as a greeting. He smells of something sweet yet distinctly masculine that should be nice but only makes John crinkle his nose in disgust. He must be wearing too much. John gets a strong whiff of it as the boy speaks into his ear, almost making him sneeze, “It’s an honour Doctor Watson,” the boy praises, “I’m a huge fan of your stories!”
Sherlock blinks in confusion at the sudden anger and disdain dripping from John’s voice. “What?!” He asks, his tone equally as appalled as it is confounded. “What in the hell are you on about?”
“What? Sh–” Sherlock gave John a look, “–
“No problem,” William smiled and helped John stand. “You good?” He asked.
) and put them on, followed by a little magnifying glass which he used to inspect Jenny's face, neck and hands.
Sherlock got into the driver's side of the car, as directed by the cabby, while the man sat behind him. Sherlock saw him reach into his pocket through the rear-view mirror. He took out a little glass bottle, inside it, a single white speckled pill.
“Okay,” the man answered as he took the computer with him.
“Getting to it John. Patience.” Sherlock answered him then, his voice husky as he winked at John, because
to get Sherlock naked,
“You’re no fun.” She pouts.
Sherlock grins, “That’s the spirit, John,” he says, handing John his phone, which Greg has been gracious enough to hand back to him, unlocked to feature the picture of a man in around his early fifties dressed in a tuxedo and carrying a tray of tall glasses filled with a pink liquid. “This is Francis,” Sherlock explains, “He was a butler of Henry’s and the last one to see Hallward. Basil had apparently gone looking for Gray on the night he was supposed to take a midnight train to Paris. Unfortunately for Basil, Dorian wasn’t home the evening he went to see him. He had apparently waited until eleven p.m. for Gray to come home, but seeing as Dorian never showed up he’d left before having a chance to see him. Dorian didn’t make it home until two in the morning. We know that the servant died, but we don’t know
?” He emphasizes.
“Yeah? Er, the man that was just leaving?” John responds as he walks to the door, “boring case?”
John blushed “Yeah, probably.”
Molly clears her throat pointedly while Irene brings her newspaper down just to raise a brow at him. Sherlock feels his ears burn with his blush and tries to cough it away, “Yes, well, um, that’s nice Rosie. I promise to call him soon, does that sound alright with you?”
“Thank you, John.”
“God he was furious with us,” John says. The couple had gotten away in the end, but Sherlock had been thrilled at solving the mystery and after chasing them around had eventually just laughed and told John he was hungry. They’d left poor Greg in the house until five am when his cell finally got signal and he’d yelled that he was going to kill them for abandoning him.
To Sherlock’s relief John answers him right away, “Yeah, hi, Sherlock. It’s nothing serious. Just can’t text very well with a wiggling toddler in my arms,”
can hear it screaming.
“Sherlock!” The heavily accented voice of Iris says from behind him, and the Russian beauty walks into the room looking huffy. She has a red beret on her head covering all of her golden locks and wears a long dark blue coat very similar to Sherlock’s. Her hazel eyes take in the room as she enters it, poking his ribs, “Careful! You will break my delicate ankles,” she scolds. “Hello, dear,” She continues, turning her attention to Molly, “And are you a friend of Sherlock’s?”
Sherlock stared at him yelling from a distance, slightly shocked.
“And today,” John was said, a false smile still plastered on his face, “Harriet and Mary still share the same values.” A photograph of Mary and Redbeard playing and a photograph of Harry messily devouring some ribs.
John goes first points to his chosen meal on the menu as he speaks, “I’ll have the risotto with the scallops and Caprese salad, please.”
In the next one (a 1920's male tailcoat complete with black top hat and monocle), John danced with a cane and did tricks with the hat.
“Is he on a case?” He’d asked casually (not casually enough) as he had speared a piece of crispy lettuce on a fork and brought it to his lips.
The Woman had looked at Sherlock with a sickening fear in her eyes and had remained silent.
“This one.” Sherlock said, tapping the cabby lightly on the hand.
was an odd coincidence.
“Yeah, they won't call you, they won't bother you, they'll pretend they've never even met you. You can't beat that.” Greg answered.
“Fine.” Sherlock conceded, and gave himself away when he blinked before he started, “I once broke an alibi by demonstrating the exact–”
“I’m appalled at you, Miss Hooper,” Henry replies, mock wounded, “age is everything. Every day I grow older is another stab to my heart.”
John stared at him for a second. “How did you...”
I might merge this and Chapter 11 together. And I might merge chapter 11 and chapter 10 together too... so they might become chapter 10 and that would be the end... But for now... Chapter 12 is the last one. Or I might merge chapter 10 & 11 into one chapter and the beginning of this with chapter with that one, making this Chapter 11 and the very last one. we'll see.
“I know, sweetheart, I know,” Molly croons as she bounces the baby attempting to placate her.
“No, but you are.” The man smiled.
“No. It’s not finished, silly Sherrock,” Rosie admonishes Sherlock, though she is grinning when she looks at him.
“Yes, they’re very talented. You’re here for one of them?” She asks, conversationally. She’s not sure why she asks, but there’s something charming about the stranger that makes her want to keep talking to him.
“Mother FUCKER!” John Screamed.
“Is it?” John asked, quite clearly remembering Harry having eaten a pile of bacon that morning.
John Watson) was saying, “Now, I am going to get up, and I'm going to take a glance into that car, and you had better hope that Sherlock Holmes is still breathing or I
. And he had to be honest, just a bit exciting.
“Gentlemen,” Algernon greets with a charming smile, “Is this fresh meat I spy?” He says gesturing at John with his glass.
The stage is lit in golden lights. Sherlock stands in the center of the stage in a black suit with a tight white shirt and a shiny golden tie. One of his hands reaches slowly above him as a woman’s voice begins singing “
John holds still and allows Sherlock to do what he wants. Whatever he wants. It’s fine. It’s all fine.
Sherlock mentally shakes himself, no longer preoccupied with his partner’s actions, pleasurable as they may be.
John sighed.
!” He practically mewled in John's arms.
A similar thing had happened at Bill's wedding, where John had held onto the man's suit jacket while Bill staggered doing his best not to miss the urinal.
“Dammit!” John laughed.
Sherlock clapped, saying, “Yes! There we go, now we've got something to dance to!” as an upbeat mix of David Bowie's 'Let's Dance' started to play. John laughed along with a few others in the pub as Sherlock began to dance to the music gracelessly. A couple of minutes in two girls got up and joined him. The three of them began to sing along with the lyrics, laughing. Sherlock beckoned John to join them. He shook his head to decline and held up his glass as an excuse. Sherlock simply shrugged and continued to dance with the girls. They
Sherlock frowned but continued talking, “John the reason I'm here tonight is because I knew this would be hard for you, and for the first time in a really long time I wanted to be there for somebody. I wanted to be here for you John, even if you don't want me...” John gave him a look of disbelief, but his feet remained rooted to the spot as he listened, “I know I screwed things up. I mean really, really messed everything up and
child you’re taking care of, he’ll probably tie you up and fuck you over the coffee table as soon as the child is removed from the room. Parents love it when you coddle their kids.”
” Sherlock and Irene expertly maneuver around a set that is styled like a country bar. Sherlock is dressed in the red shirt from the photograph on the social media page and the black suspenders. His hair is slicked back with gel and his trousers appear to be made of leather, though they must be of a more pliable material since he appears to be dancing to the quick rhythm with ease. Irene is dressed in a poodle skirt, a plaid top and a hairband, her temporarily blonde hair up in a high fifties-style ponytail. Together they look like they’ve stepped out of an old soda-pop bar located in some American countryside.
“Oh, well, why don't I just go with you and Mary can take my car?” Sherlock asked, looking at John.
A snapping noise and a flash interrupted John's reverie, “Sorry.” Sherlock mumbled.
Sherlock walked back into the inn to pay the bill. Once inside he was cornered by DI Dimock who had brought him all the paper work for Sherlock's and John's statements.
“I’d love to keep her all day,” Sherlock says, wistfully.
“Yeah, they’re always like that.” She informs him.
After a few more minutes, right after John has snapped a particularly cute photo of Rosie chewing, Sherlock finally glances up at John. On reflex, John captures his sweet expression on camera. Sherlock has a kind smile on his face and a light flush in his cheeks, the combination making him look years younger. John puts his phone in his pocket and grins at his friend. “Hi, you,” he says, not completely unaware that the tone comes out a little flirtatious.
Dorian looks sceptical, but doesn’t argue, “If you’re sure…” he says.
About an hour earlier, at his office, Sherlock found himself in a unique predicament. His brother had approved his story but now Sherlock didn't want him to run it. He had this horrible feeling in his chest every time he thought about John reading it before Sherlock had a chance to explain. In a fit of madness he'd decided that what was best was to tell John the truth and he had made a phone call to Harry, hoping she's give him a clue as to where he could find John. Luckily Harry had told him exactly what he'd needed to know without him asking,
Sherlock chuckles and argues, “Oh no, Rosie, I can’t get up. I think shall have to dance from down here!”
The other man gives Sherlock a meek smile as he opens the door to exit, “Well, alright, I understand, but, er, you have my number, you know, in case you change your mind,” he says. He pulls on his maroon leather jacket over the tight white t-shirt he’d just put on and walks down the stairs.
Sherlock flaps a hand in her direction but finds it takes up too much of his energy. He lets it drop beside him and exhales, “No, nothing, just… sorry.”
This response gives John pause, “A... neighbor? Since when d’you talk to our neighbors?” He inquires, turning slightly to ask the question, a look of disbelief in his eyes.
“You'll recognize her too John, that woman there is Jennifer Wilson. She was the bride featured for one of my articles in the commitments column called 'A Marvel in Pink.' She was the one who had that horrible cotton-candy wedding. God it was torture.”
“Well,” John said, through his food, “I'm going to go put on that slide show!” The look in his eye giving away all the insults he wanted to hurl at his sister in that moment.
Carter smiled weakly and left, “Thanks.”
John stares at Sherlock as he talks. Sherlock waves his ever-moving hands in the air as he speaks rapid-fire, trying to retrace his steps and sort through his memories of the evening so far. John’s a little self-conscious about the sensation of his lips tugging in what is probably a dopey looking smile, but… God, he’d missed this.
Dorian grips Sherlock’s arm with a surprisingly strong grip of his own. “Sherlock!” The boy shouts, delighted to see him, “What luck! I was just going to come looking for you!”
“What the fuck?” John said as he turned the page seeing a collage of photos of himself in a variety of his ridiculous groomsman suits strewn across the page.
“John?”
While John went to change Sherlock went over to the closet to snap more photos and toss around some odd looking frilled suits and cravats. John came out of his room in that moment dressed in a neon-green suit with a purple shirt, but didn't see Sherlock, “Holmes?” He called and Sherlock popped his head out of the closet to see, almost instantly recoiling and half shielding his eyes while he took a picture, “That, is vile.” He stated, then pulling out out a suit with leather pants that seemed a tad tight for John and asked, “What was the theme here?”
“That's it?”
“You got anything?” Sherlock asked quietly, in his least 'irritating' voice.
“Hi, Sherlock,” the little twat simpers, “I hope you don’t mind me coming over. You said you’d be gone for just a moment and I
When he finally begins to calm down he notices she is frowning, “Why are you crying?”
John looks at Sherlock sadly, “Don’t you?” He asks from where he sits. For once, the look on John’s face is open. It’s open and clear and Sherlock thinks – or he hopes that he’s reading it correctly. “John, you know I don’t.” Sherlock repeats, gently.
“You mean to men who are about to get married...?” Sherlock asked.
“Dear god... we have something in common.” John said, suppressing a smile as he looked back to the bar.
John moved out of the way.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and replies loudly, “What, can’t keep up, old man?”
John says, then adds,
“Um... Molly...” John asks cautiously, “What is this?”
The man rolled his eyes, imperiously “Your speech, John. Lovely story about your comradely with our Bill.”
Dinner and Dancing
The cabby thought for a moment, “What game?” He asked, finally.
’ He thinks, but doesn’t voice the thought.
Sherlock nodded and shook his hand, “The woman?” He asked Wanda.
“Yeah...?” The cabby asked, rudely. Sherlock didn't know it but the cabby disapproved of the way Sherlock had mocked John. He'd been a nice guy, and there was nothing wrong with being a little romantic.
Mary rested her head against her hand, her eyes locked on the photograph of Harriet eating.
“You know what,
“You know what? Can you please, please find someone else to be creepy with?”
“What about the invitation mock-ups?
I'm not sure if you've figured out Irene's text from the previous chapter. I won't reveal the answer just yet, as I plan on having her reveal it later on in the story to someone else, but congrats to those of you that have bothered to even try or who already figured it out. It's not really that important anyway XD
John frowns, “Their? As in
John snorts,“You do remember that you and large amounts of alcohol are not a good combination don’t you?”
I remember him. Not a night you forget too easy. When I remembered him I remembered you. I knew it couldn't be a coincidence. You in my cab that night and you here today. You were just as arrogant then. And equally as theatrical.”
“Oh are you going to check my finger work now?” Harry called back as she jogged towards Mary and disappeared behind the curtain. John had never wanted to shoot himself more in his entire life.
Sherlock wonders, but doesn’t type that into a text, instead he types, mentally reciting Irene’s recent advice,
Sherlock beamed manically, “
“You think I'm
Mycroft smiled then, “Ah, the bravery of the soldier. Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don't you think?”
“Out?”
. Soon, an older couple joined them on the dance floor too, and then a few more people. Pretty quickly half the bar was up and dancing and singing along with Sherlock.
', which leads me to believe that not very many of you interacted with her. This is a small town, so I'm assuming if many of you had, you'd know her well by now. What I'd like to know is if you know anyone in town she was here to see in particular, perhaps they can shine some light on the situation?”
“He’s relentless,” Sherlock says, looking put-upon.
Sally grimaces looking disgusted and Greg laughs saying, “I was going to say bold.” He looks at Sally with a wide smile, “D’you think John knows?”
” is actually Irene disturbs him so much. That little dark part of himself that had earlier whispered
“Oh Thank god you're here!” One of the groomsmen exhaled, grabbing John and turning John around to face him “Mike is freaking out about the wedding,” (
“I said

So uh, it’s smut but it’s kind of sad at the end there, eh? I’m sorry I can’t resist the angst. I know you’re here, angst, you’ve got some feels of ours and It calls to us~
