“Dean, aren’t you supposed to be at work?” Castiel asked with his worried voice. Dean rolled his eyes with a smile.
“We watch it all the time!” Charlie says, cleaning up her coffee table. “Sorry for the mess, I’m kind of a wreck right now.” She says.
“I have friends! I just don’t know them all that well...” Sam trailed off, he was now realizing that Castile was probably hearing all of this. That’s embarrassing.
“Did you have to do that, Sam?”
“Dude! Nice. So why are you upset? Isn’t that a good thing? I thought we had mostly gotten over your sexuality crisis, Dean,” She ended with a pouty tone.
“Is something wrong?” Cas looked at him concerned.
“You tricked me! You only did that in some lame attempt to help me. I don’t need your pity or help.”
Hey! I'm so sorry for the delay in writing this! I had major writer's block and then I hyperfixated on Star Wars and fell out of the Supernatural fandom for a bit. I managed to break my writer's block and finish this chapter, even though it's a bit late.
Dean is here. How is Dean here? Should I say something to him? What the hell is Dean doing here? Learning obviously, but why here? Why did he have to transfer to Dean’s school?
“You shouldn’t have said that, dickwad. Now give the nice lady a tip for her work, or we are going to have a problem.”
“Outside, after I fell.”
“Oh the horror.” Cas deadpanned back at him.
“Yes, because I do not need to hear that,” Sam said gesturing at Dean and Cas. “Look man, congratulations on finally getting together, but if you two wanna fuck, do it in your own rooms, not the middle of the bunker.”
“I was wrong. You’re a terrible kisser, Dean.” Cas smirked back, obviously joking.
“I am almost done. I wanted to put up some decorations and you two weren’t doing it.”
“Is that? Crowley?”
“Just hold the lights so they don’t break.”
“Your siblings?” Dean asked, trying to change the subject.
Cas climbed halfway up the ladder and stretched his arm out to Dean. “Hand me the end of the lights.”
“If you insist,” she relented, finally sitting down and placing her laptop on the table.
“Were you listening to me?”
“It really is no trouble, come, sit,” he reassured.
“Dean stabbed me in the chest.”
“I am an angel of the lord. I know how to keep my balance.”
“Ummm...I don’t know”
If every Christmas season was going to be as good as this, Dean could see himself really getting into the “holiday spirit” that everyone always talked about.
“Hopefully that was a good woah?”
“Mnf-”
“Hey!” a voice shouted, “The show’s over, get lost you little punks!”
So he made a decision. The campus was big enough, so he was unlikely to even see Dean again. Right?
Cas turned back to him after the person passed. He looked at Dean and squinted. Under the deep blue gaze, Dean began to worry at his lip in nervousness.
“Of course, Dean. Anything for you.” Cas said softly. If a girl in a bar had looked at him the same way that Cas was looking at him right now, he would be getting laid.
“Dean.”
“So, let me get this straight, or not straight in this case but you know what I mean, anyway, you met a crazy hot guy and didn’t get rejected, so what happened?” Charlie rambled.
“I think so,” Cas said, attempting to stand up.
“But you’re busy. I don’t wanna distract you.” She protested.
“Nonsense! You’re coming with me!” Dean said, not leaving any room for discussion.
He spun around and his jaw dropped.
“Yeah?”
The waitress came back with some pie, “as a thank you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
So it was with Cas’ laughter and another faint “Goodbye, Dean” that Dean finally left, got into his car and drove off.
When Dean got to where he was supposed to meet up with his friends and Charlie, he found Benny, Lee, Garth, Ash, and Charlie already there. He noticed Charlie’s familiar flash of red hair and suddenly she was jumping at him, shouting, “Dean!” in excitement.
“I mean, I wouldn’t turn down a blow job if you’re offering.” Cas rumbled in his ear, filling him with warmth. He hadn’t even noticed how they were slowly drifting closer to each other.
When they get settled in the Impala, he turns to look at Cas.
They ordered their drinks and looked at the menu for what to order. He chose the bacon cheeseburger, obviously, and Sam got some lame salad, the freak.
But this was Cas, and Cas didn’t feel that way about him. Sure, he caught Cas staring at him a lot of the time, and Cas always stood too close to him, but that is because Cas doesn’t know any better. There was no way that Cas could reciprocate what Dean felt for him.
Chapter title from "Missing You" by Green Day.
Sam walked out of the bathroom to find them making out in the back seat. “Finally,” Sam smiled softly as he slid into the driver's seat and began the drive home.
Charlie: Hhhmmmmm
“Do they have peanut butter and jelly?”
Sam, Cas, and Dean sat back down and Cas started fussing over him once again.
Ash (Dean doesn’t know his last name / 21 y/o / held back 2 years / supplies drinks and cigs / supportive stoner friend / fav band is metallic)
----------------
He quickly got to work after settling down at what seemed to be one of the last remaining tables in the library. The atmosphere of the library provided the perfect conditions to stay focused. Less than an hour later, he was broken from his focus by a redheaded girl leaning a hand on the table and tapping on his shoulder. Not that it was very hard, he was already starting to zone out a bit.
I'm writing/posting this at like 2 in the morning, so if there are any grammatical errors, please let me know.
Immediately, he felt bad for his outburst. “Sorry, Cas. I’m just hungry.”
…………….
“Oh no, you shouldn’t have to move your stuff for me, it’s totally fine,” She was cool. He liked this one.
He sighs in relief that Sam was able to think of something quickly. Sam laughs at his sigh, the jerk, and Cas continues to fuss over him. He enjoys his pie and makes sure to leave a big tip.
“Hey, I’m Dean. Is this your first time here too?” he asked hopefully because it would be good to not be the only one not knowing entirely what to expect.
“I’ve been in the community for a while. I know a sexuality crisis when I see one. From what you told me, I’m guessing that you’re, what, bi-curious?” Cas said, placing a hand on his upper bicep near his shoulder.
---------------
"I just saw you practically suck his face off?" Sam looked at him in confusion.
“I love the Good Omens reference. It’s such a great book.”
Castiel: Bowling For Soup. They are the ones that did the Phineas and Ferb theme song.
As he entered, he thought that trench coat dude’s eyes flashed briefly with recognition, but he just ignored it, because why would this random dude know him?
Cas climbed up and silently began working on setting up the lights. Snow was starting to fall, and Dean moved below the eves to avoid freezing to death.
“Since when do you listen to Bowling For Soup?” Charlie asked him as soon as they left the store.
"No you didn't." he replied petulantly.
Cas blushed at his tone and Dean giggled. “Ya know, your blush ain’t so bad either, hot stuff.” Cas flushed even brighter red and smirked at Dean.
“Why would he hand you porn? Was it like a prank or something? Or is your brother messed up in the head?” Charlie looked confused. He often forgot how strange his family could appear to outsiders.
The feeling of Cas’ slightly chapped lips pressed against his own was amazing and he quickly kissed back, happy to finally be kissing Cas after pining for years. He had been waiting for this moment for years and finally, it was happening. Their lips slotted together in a way that made Dean feel like he was made for the sole purpose of kissing Cas.
“That sucks, man. And there’s no way of finding him?”
Before Dean had enough time to think about just how hot it was to hear an angel say ‘fuck’, Cas was kissing him. CAS WAS KISSING HIM.
“I thought this was your favorite band?” Dean asked.
“Well, why don’t you dress like this at school, Cas? You’re hot as hell. Maybe even hotter, and I would have realized it was you a lot sooner.” He started with a simple question. Maybe as a way of stalling more of the feelings talk, but he would never admit that.
Kevin Tran (18 y/o / skipped a grade / booksmart but no common sense / sees Cas in the library regularly / fav band is P!ATD / pan? or ace?)
Castiel: Even if he lived, JK’s a coward and wouldn’t do it.
And so, Dean shut his mouth after being told to for the first time in his life. And while it was odd to immediately obey, it was important to Cas, so he cared. He didn’t bother to reflect on how he cared so much already for this almost-stranger beside him, and he simply threw an arm around Cas’ shoulders.
Dean worked hard in his classes to maintain a somewhat decent grade. In classes like calculus, he usually struggled, but Charlie suddenly started doing well in the class so now he usually copies off of her. He saw Castiel around campus a few more times, and also in his classes, and every time, the guy was wearing his stupid trench coat. Thoughts of the Cas from the concert were quickly pushed from his mind as he was given more and more assignments.
“No, Sorry Cas. How about grilled cheese?”
Cas had the audacity to look confused, and dammit, he looked even cuter with his squint and little head tilt. “What? Did I do something wrong? I apologize for not asking first, I must have misread the situation.”
“Assbutt!” Cas yelled a second later.
His brain must be malfunctioning because he suddenly blurts out “I mean, I wouldn’t mind if...” He quickly cut himself off, blushing profusely as he realized what he said.
“I thought you said your parents didn’t care?” he asked, confused.
And if Sam immediately pulled out his laptop to order noise-canceling headphones off of Amazon, well, Dean and Cas were none the wiser.
Burying his lingering disappointment, he grabbed everything we would need to spend a day with his best friend.
“Dean.” Cas’s voice distracts Dean and he felt himself get punched in the nose. Before he has a chance to retaliate, Sam grabs him and shoves him into Cas.
“When are we ever careful?” Cas said from below him in a weak voice.
“What do you want it for?” Lee asked, annoyed.
I worked hard on some bits in my outline or on deleted scenes, so I wanted to share them with you!
"Ok, Sammy, let's do this, and you better listen up because I'm only going to say this once, this is my boyfriend Cas, I'm bi, and you are really annoying."
“Then I say yes.”
“We can share, just stay, please.”
“Yeah.” He paused, “Why do people always think that?”
“I wish I had siblings. I grew up an only child, but my best friend and I have known each other since we were kids, and we’re super close, so he’s basically my brother.”
“Oh, well I don’t want that to happen,” he said with a chuckle, handing over his schedule.
Charlie’s laughter burst out of her smiling face and she snorted. “....That’s really funny, man. Did he like, scribble out all the letters but your name or something?”
Crowley Macleod (sassy pansexual / will fight people / very clever / fav band is Queen)
“Shit! Cas!” He ran over to Cas who lay unmoving and face down in a pile of snow.
Dean takes a bite of his pie and slightly winces at the pain in his jaw but groans in happiness at the explosion of flavor.
They worked in near silence for about an hour before he heard a growl of frustration across from him.
It sounded like he was going to introduce himself as Cas.
Sam steps forward and takes the man by the collar of his shirt, easily lifting him off the ground. Sam walks the other man to the door, subtly reveals his gun and the man takes off running.
“Yeah, see ya later, Char,” he said as he hung up the phone.
“Um… yeah. I’ve liked you for a while.” He said rubbing the back of his head nervously.
It was already going to be hard enough to navigate an entirely new school during his sophomore year, but Dean would only make it worse, keeping him distracted much like the thought of him did during the summer. If the thought of him was enough to almost have Cas distractedly reveal his true self to his parents, then what would the actual real, live Dean do to him.
“Bitch!” He shouted back.
Cas was shifting in his seat as he settled down and his elbow kept bumping into Dean.
Each kiss seemed to last until they could no longer breathe, but every moment they were not kissing was considered a momentary waste of time, so he continued to kiss Cas senseless in the backseat.
Dean was cut off by Cas softly kissing his lips. He sat confused for a moment, but quickly grabbed Cas’ face and deepened the kiss.
“Castiel,” She replied.
Dean growled and tackled the man, slamming him into a table.
“It’s for calculus two, and it’s just really confusing.”
“I can’t believe you, you son of a bitch.” he bristled.
When the waitress came to their table with the drinks, plain old water for Sam (lame), coffee for Dean (he needed caffeine), and tea for Cas, she asked what they wanted to order. Sam ordered his boring ass salad, Dean ordered their “famous bacon cheeseburger” and their waiter nodded with a smile. She turned to Cas, “What would you like to order, hun?”
“Did that give you any answers, mr. bi-curious?” His veins turned to ice and hurt spread through him. Cas just did that to prove a point.
“Aaannndddd done,” Charlie said once she finished, “Thanks a bunch, Castiel. I owe ya big time.”
“Sure, but you better answer the question, Dean.” So Charlie hadn’t seen through his poor deflection attempt. He should have known that his friend would be smarter than that.
“So….” Cas hesitated, figuring out the right words to say, “..would you be amenable to kissing again? ‘Cuz, you’re a pretty good kisser.” Cas was flustered. How did Dean possibly end up here, flirting with an adorable idiot at a rock concert. Sure he could charm the pants off of most women, not that he wanted to, but it was different with guys - or so he thought.
It hurt whenever he tried to send a kind smile during class to Dean and he turned away, or when he never even saw a flash of recognition in Dean’s eyes. But he understood that Dean most likely wanted space, so he gave it to him.
“What assignment?”
Charlie laughed at him. Rude. “We’re leaving for food. Let’s go.”
“Cas, i’m fine. It’s just a broken nose and maybe a bruised jaw.”
“Yeah, since when do you just go around kissing guys?” Ash added.
His friends quickly became occupied in bickering over what store to visit first. He sighed in relief and slumped against Cas, who caught him just like he expected. It was strange to already have this much trust in a near stranger, but with Cas, it just makes sense.
“To be fair to Dean though, I do look and act completely different when we are at school.” Cas chimed in from beside him.
“Thanks. Bye, Castiel.”
Bobby Singer (Dean’s adopted father after J*hn died / ally / doesn’t have a fav band but does like classic rock / grumpy but kind / supportive)
“Yeah, yeah, shut it, Lee. I’ll see ya in Spanish. Now get lost.” he said, tossing the schedule back to his friend.
“Sap,” Charlie teased and for a moment, everything was back to normal.
Once they were finished, the waitress came back to their table “Can I get you anything else?”
He was not expecting any big surprises when he walked into the Hunter Academy College because it was an ordinary school with ordinary buildings, ordinary staff, and ordinary people. Or so he thought because when he was walking to his new dorm one day, he walked past Dean. The same Dean that he had kissed at that concert. The same Dean that had kissed him at that concert.
“Rejected by a cute guy?” she asked instead.
“Come here, Dean” Cas said softly after what looked like a moment of contemplation.
“He lives in a completely different state, Char.”
Dean couldn’t get any of his friends to come to The Rock Show with him, and while he was bummed about not sharing the experience with Benny, Kevin, Charlie, Lee, and the rest of his group, he wasn’t too torn up about it. He drove from his small town of Lawrence, Kansas to Chicago, Illinois, blasting his music the whole time.
Normally, he would have turned down a stranger that wanted to sit with him, but he could completely understand the love for the library’s atmosphere, and the Harry Potter reference helped too. “Sure, let me just scoot my stuff a bit, and then you can have more room.”
The angel whispered a quiet, “Sorry, Dean.” and stopped wiggling, lowering his head.
“I wish that I was able to heal you, Dean.”
“What did you hear?”
I'm alive!! sorry for the delay with this chapter! I'll let you get right to it.
Charlie caught his eye, instantly understanding his discomfort at being the center of attention. “Yeah, let’s go shopping or something! I wanna go to Hot Topic!”
In the end, Charlie ended up getting a few graphic tees depicting different Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings images or sayings. Dean grabbed a Led Zeppelin, Green Day, and a Queen tee, and was just about to pay when he saw a bowling for soup tee. He grabbed it with a smile.
“I am fine.”
And then Cas’ lips were on his and woah. The smooth glide paired with the slightly chapped lips against his own set off every nerve in his body. They pulled closer and were pressed against one another. Neither rushed to deepen the kiss, but the lingering calmness promised more to come.
“Is ass all you do?”
Benny Lafitte (supportive / close friends with Dean / protective and very loyal to his friends / 20 y/o / likes horror movies / doesn’t like labels, but likes males and females / likes Blink-182 and Sum 41)
“What! That’s a great insult. Better than assbutt!” he defended.
As Dean stewed over this cute asshole in front of him, he nearly missed Cas’ response. “-I didn’t trick you. I kissed you because I wanted to. I did want to help, but that wasn’t the only reason.”
With their lips nearly brushing, Dean lost his patience and surged forward, capturing his lips. Their lips slotted together and any connection to the rest of the world was once again lost with the slide of their lips. Everything felt right about this, the perfect slide, Cas’ slightly chapped lips, the teeth nipping lightly at his bottom lip, and - oh - that was a tongue. Without a second thought, he opened his mouth and they deepened the kiss.
“Sure did.” Cas smirked before nipping at his ear.
Castiel: I went to this concert near my hometown this summer, and there was this guy there that was crazy hot and we ended up making out. And, my favorite band played a lot of my favorite songs. It was a great night. Forgot to get the guy’s number though.
Charlie: Ohhh, definitely Bellatrix Lestrange because she tortured my girl Hermione and also killed Sirius and crushed my wolfstar dreams
Cas was standing in front of him. Cas was standing in front of him! There he was standing there in all his glory, messy sex hair, electric blue eyeshadow, black eyeliner, full punk clothing, all of it, exactly as he remembered seeing him. Sure, the clothes were different than before, it would be weird if they were the same, but it was him. He found him. He found Cas.
“Fuck it,” Cas said, leaning in, and damn it was hot to hear the angel curse.
“Okay?” He asked, climbing into the back seat so he could be closer to him.
The waitress’s eyes widen in shock and Cas continues.
The name had sparked a memory in Dean. The memory of a man that had slipped to the back of his mind. While not necessarily painful, after having a few weeks to get over it, it still hurts to think about how he missed his chance with Hot Concert Guy Cas. But there is no way the two are the same, after all, the concert was all the way across the country, and plus, the hot concert guy dressed and acted completely different than the stuck-up trench-coated dude in front of him. So, Dean pushed off the idea and convinced himself the brief flash of recognition in the dude’s bright blue eyes was just his imagination. After all, why expect kindness from an unjust universe?
“You know, she thought that we were a couple.”
Dean finally managed to swallow most of his mouthful of food, but the damage was already done.
“I still love her Cassie.”
“Thank you, it’s been going well.” He says, and he’s not even putting on a fake smile anymore. They continue to work on their portfolios as Dean waits for his food.
“Castiel?” Dean asked, confused at the name. The way his lips said the unfamiliar word automatically felt normal. Like it was something he always knew, but was unaware of.
“Alright Sammy, what seems to be the problem?” Dean walked in looking around at all of the things Sam and Castiel had gathered since Dean had last been here.
“I’m Charlie, room 4B. Otherwise known as the fool who’s been crying all week. Sorry for the noise, I got a noise complaint from the old lady in 6B.” She answered, and Dean immediately felt bad for being angry with her.
“I have my class in about twelve minutes, then another class, then a study group with some other pre law students.” Castiel nodded and took his coat off, hanging it off the end of the bed.
“Hey, we’re just watching tv, would you Wanna join?” Charlie offered him. Dean looked surprised for a moment then smiled.
He was teased every school he went to. For whatever reason. He was too small, too smart, too quiet, too weird looking, his hair was too long, his brother was too loud. And everyone knew that his brother got all those bruises from somewhere. But Sam was always bruise free.
“Mm not everything.”
The quietness of the night outside soothed Cas to peace, though his heart rate wasn’t close to resting.
“Come on, I’m not gonna bite.” She insists. He gives in and shakes her hand.
“Thanks man, you really didn’t need to wash it though.” Cas shrugs and looks around his apartment a little.
“Just pepperoni is fine,” Charlie shouted.
“Hey you’re still wearing my shirt.” He notices with a smile. Cas looks down, he keeps forgetting about it.
“You’re breaking my heart Cas,” Dean puts a hand to his left peck.
“Okay let’s switch it up. Go the other way now!” Charlie said. They both agreed and Dean finished his bite so he could ask.
“You don’t have any friends to get an apartment with?” Dean asked bluntly. Sam put his head in his hands, but Castiel just laughed.
“Oh, okay then. What’s up? I’m still at work.” Dean grumbled through the phone. Sam could hear the background noises of gears and hammers.
“Yes, Jessica seems very nice. She’s in pre-law with you, correct?” Castiel asked him. Sam nodded awkwardly. Castiel started to put his books away on his desk.
“Thanks man,” Dean’s pretty distracted but doesn’t want to completely brush off this guy. He seems nice enough and Dean could always have more friends.
“Nope! I kissed a guy on the cheek in seventh grade and that’s it. I knew pretty much my whole life that I was only into women.”
Please tell me if you noticed any mistakes, have any questions, or have any feedback!
“Oh, yeah. I’m a total raging lesbian, so I perfectly fit the ‘gay people can’t do math’ stereotype,” she chuckled. Only just now did he then notice her lesbian flag pin attached to her bag.
Cas was struggling to decide on what to order because he was new to the wonderful experience that was eating food.
“Stay.”
He always wore ripped jeans and had his shirt opened just enough to look artfully ruffled. He tried his best to keep his style, even when he was in a rush while getting dressed. Today was just the same, having made enough effort in his outfit to appear like no effort was put into it - just the way he liked it.
Castiel eventually falls asleep during the tenth episode. When he wakes up a few hours later the tv is off, the lights are all out, and Charlie isn’t in the room. Dean is also asleep on his side of the couch. Castiel gets up and walks around the apartment to find Charlie.
“Stand up and spin in a circle five times.”
“Jesus” Cas continues to grumble under his breath. His nice white button down is now all wet. Great, he thought. He packed and over night bag, but it only had pajama pants, a change or underwear, and his toothbrush. He usually just wore this to bed when he was at Charlie’s.
“He spilled beer on himself!” Dean defends himself, doing exactly what Sam thought he would.
Cas has a whole thing with punctuality and whenever he’s late it bothers him to no end. Dean finds it almost endearing though.
He knew what was happening but didn’t do it on purpose. Like part of his brain was put on autopilot, but the other part wasn’t even aware.
“What? I can’t spend time with my older brother for no reason?” Sam asked, almost offended. He sat on his bed and crossed his arms.
“Dean? Like Dean Winchester?”
“Well technically he’s not. But he practically raised us so as far as I’m concerned he’s family.” Cas nods as the movie actually starts.
“Truth”
“Fine, mom.” He did the dare slowly, as not to upset his stomach.
“Whatever, if you can get into a party without anyone noticing that you don’t go actually go here than go for it.”
Maybe he thought it would be the same as speaking aloud while alone. Like the darkness of the room would eat up his words like they did most nights when Dean talked to himself.
Sam had never been so nervous about asking someone out, but Jessica was his friend first. He’d known her for about a month and they were actually friends. Growing up he’d moved so often he never bothered making friends. Even in the past two years when he lived in Lebanon, he didn’t bother getting to know anyone.
“Oh, Are either of you sloppy drunks? I feel like that’s important to know. Cause then we should put all our phones away somewhere...” Dean says.
“That would take a while Dean, maybe when we have more time.” Dean smiles and nods. He finishes up his lunch quickly, he’s always been a fast eater.
“I guess we’ll see then.” Dean locks eyes with Cas, neither look away. Charlie has to start the show herself.
“Sounds fun. I’m Meg, by the way.” She puts out her hand for him to shake. Sam looks at it quickly, then back to the Professor.
Dean is working on the last bit of a repair before he heads on home. It’s about six right now, he’s working a little overtime today. The boss won’t care though, he hardly notices the workers.
“You don’t even know he’s gay, or if he’s my type.” Now Charlie rolled her eyes.
“We met at Stanford two years ago, I’m a tech major there.” Charlie offered, Dean nodded. He looked tired.
“Did you fuck my roommate?” Sam asked point blank.
“You better not be. Now did you actually need anything?” Dean started working again.
“Uh yeah, I’m Dean. What’s your name?” He asked, holding his hand out.
Charlie, the ever-perceptive friend that she is, noticed his muted tone right away. “What’s wrong?” she asked, “Get rejected by a cute girl or something?”
“Yes.”
Cas was not surprised often but when it did happen, however, he would be able to school his features easily to hide his surprise. Years of practice hiding his true feelings and emotions from his family had helped him master the skill.
He groaned. Why would Charlie invite that posh, stuck up, boring guy to hang out with-
“Ok, my devastatingly handsome friend here will have a bacon cheeseburger, same as me.”
“Hm? Yeah, I’m Charlie. How do you know my name? Do I know you?” She looked at him confused.
“Years.”
----------------
The energy in the concert area was electrifying, the loud music blasting, the smell of glorious food, the cheers and singing of the crowd. Channeling this energy, he leaned forward to initiate their second kiss of the night. It was more passionate than the last while also somehow being more tender. They broke apart after a moment and each took half a step back to avoid overcrowding each other.
“It’s fine, Cas.”
Charlie: True, true. Your turn to ask
Not good at being put on the spot, he panicked and nearly introduced himself as Cas before remembering to say the full Castiel. Hopefully, he managed to play it off as a strange stutter or something. Unable to think of an interesting fact about himself on the spot, he just mentioned that he used to work at the library back in Pontiac. His introduction was a bit stiff compared to others, but he stayed calm and collected so all was good.
“I’ll just have to make you stop then.” Cas replied smoothly, leaning in slowly and getting less than an inch from his face.
Dean smiled fondly and waited a couple minutes before leaning close to Cas’ ear. He quietly whispered a drawn out, “Asssbuttt.”
They got back to Charlie’s house and promptly plopped down to play video games until dinner. Dean (and Sam!) had a standing invitation to dinner with the Bradbury family whenever they wanted. It had been this way for years, as soon as Charlie’s parents found out what John Winchester was like, they insisted that Sam and Dean would be welcome any time they wanted. This invitation spanned all the way through the years, and still stands even when they are at college.
Claire Novak (18 y/o / smol gay that Cas ‘adopts’ as his own / short angry bisexual with preference towards females / will fight for a donut / feminist / will fight all homophobes, transphobes, racists, etc.)
“Whatever, Sammy,” Dean said as he walked outside, Cas holding the door open for him.
“Jerk!”
They soon got caught up in their back-to-school shopping, buying new clothes and a few other supplies. He breathed another sigh of relief as they left the last store, even though Charlie’s ‘montage’ of different outfits was pretty funny.
“Fine, but you are getting me pie for this.” He grumbled in annoyance. Cas handed him the lights with a small smile and set up the ladder against the building.
Charlie Bradbury (First person Dean comes out to/ meets Cas in the library one day and befriends him / Invites Cas to hang with them / 19 y/o / openly lesbian - obv / fav band is Green Day or AC/DC)
“Look, I get it if you want to leave or if you want to smite me or whatever but-”
“Lemme see your classes or I’ll have you thrown in the dungeons!” Charlie playfully demanded.
“Really?” he asked incredulously. Because who could possibly want to date him? With all of his problems, emotional baggage, and the way he constantly puts himself in danger. It just didn’t seem possible.
Cas begins fussing over Dean who wiggles to escape his grip. Once free, he moves to comfort the waitress who is silently crying.
“I forgot to get his number,” he sighed in resignation of his bad luck.
Classes didn’t start for another week, giving time for everyone to get settled onto campus and grow familiar with the layout of the school. He spent one day sprucing up his dorm and checking where all his classes were and spent the rest with his friends.
“That’s one of the classes we share. I already finished the homework. It was confusing at first, but I figured out a good technique. I can teach you if you want?” he offered, wanting to help.
“Alright, I guess I’ve gotta go. I have a long drive ahead of me.”
“I thought the day could not get any better, but this is pretty great.”
“Is this your way of asking me out, Dean Winchester?” Cas smirked.
He sighed, “Yes, he did.”
And it just got more amazing because suddenly Cas had him pressed against the wall and was inches away from his face. He flushed, wanting Cas to kiss him already.
Raising his hands in surrender, Dean laughed. “No problem here, Cas. Just asking.”
Cas let out a small chuckle. “None of my friends are into this kind of music, and to be honest,” he took what seemed like a calming breath, “to be honest, I’m not into girls. But to answer your question, no I didn’t bring a boyfriend, nor do I have one at the moment.”
Dean angrily stalked over to the guy. “Hey, she is being a great server, why don’t you tip like a gentleman?”
“Cas from the concert?” he asked, seeking confirmation that he hadn’t fully lost his mind and Cas was actually standing in front of him.
“What?” Cas said, trying to look innocent.
Once his history class ended, he caught up to Nico to see if they had a group to hang out with at lunch, explaining how he just knew that Nico would get along great with Charlie and the others.
Hope you enjoy   :)
“Let’s go get pretzels.”

“So didn’t we have plans or….” Garth asked. Bless Garth for not interrogating him and changing the subject, intentional or not.
It was Wednesday night, the week after they met, and they had been sending random questions for about twenty minutes now. They had already established that he used to live in Pontiac, Illinois, earning a cryptic ‘hmm’ from Charlie, that he liked rock and punk music, and plenty of other things. Nothing too deep, but a level above mere small talk, which should normally be reserved for criminals and con men, but they were willing to make an exception.
“Hello Sam, Dean told me that you asked Jessica out. Congratulations, I know you were nervous about it.” Castiel said as he put his coat away and changed shirts.
“My eyes?” He asks her incredulously. She smiles without her teeth and nods.
He and her had gotten along much better since Dean told her they were dating. It seemed to get through to her that he wasn’t interested in her. And now they were friends with out any weirdness. She even asked about Dean every once in a while, out of politeness. He didn’t have the heart to tell her that they weren’t actually dating. He’d probably pretend to have a break up in a month or two, by then she’ll get the idea.
He heads over to the student lounge in Kevin’s dorm building, that’s where they hold their study group. He’s the first one here today.
“What about you though? You haven’t told me anything about any lucky person, but I’ve certainly heard something through these walls.” She jokes, Dean almost blushes from embarrassment. He hadn’t even slept with as many people as he usually would, but it’s still embarrassing she could hear them.
“Uh, I’m not sure. It hasn’t been too long though, don’t worry about me. Really I’m fine.” Kevin says unconvincingly. Sam squints at him but doesn’t press any further.
“Hey Castiel!” Jess said once she noticed him. He waved at the two of them.
When he got to his room Jess was on her way out. They bumped into each other in the hallway.
“It was about some friend of yours, his name was um... Lee.” Dean’s jaw tensed, he put down the pen.
“Heh, sounds like Cas here.” Dean says and puts his hand on Cas’s shoulder. Dean’s eyes then went down to Castiel’s shirt.
“Uh hey man, are you Castiel?” Sam asked excitedly. Dean could see his brother’s smile and could practically feel the excited energy coming from him. To be honest, it kind of bummed him out.
“I’m pre-law.” Sam informed him, and Castiel provided a polite smile.
The two of them were sitting together in Sam’s bed, technically they were studying, but mostly they were staring at the pages trying to study. They kept getting distracted by each other, continually stealing glances and grazing finger tips.
Sure. Totally
“What’s your body count?” She asked him. Cas was fairly certain she knew, but it seemed only fair since she had asked Dean the same. Though Cas and Dean had wildly different answers.
“Cas you’re up.”
“You went to a party?” Sam asks Castiel in disbelief. He did not seem like the type to party, and especially not with Dean.
“Heh, yeah. I think his parents were super religious or something? So like, an Angel name? Not sure.”
“Lee was stupid, and cute. It’s honestly his fault.”
“Yeah you too man.”
“It’s a girl Dean. She just went through a break up.” Dean nodded and Castiel left.
“Sammy got a date!” He exclaimed loudly.
Dean had made Charlie and Cas a quick breakfast before he had to run to work. Cas woke up alone on the couch, with Dean in the kitchen. Not his ideal start to a morning, but at least he was still there. Charlie had an class at nine, and Cas had one at ten.
“What?”
“Well it suits you.” She continues to smile at him with a glimmer in her eyes. “I have to go, it was good seeing you again.” She waved and walked off. Castiel stood in the hallway confused for a moment before going back to his room.
“Anyway, why am I here?” Dean asked him impatiently.
“I have to go, I’ll see you around.” Sam starts to exit the room, but stops while opening the door. “Oh, tell Dean I said hi.” He smirks while pointing at Castiel’s shirt, then leaves before Cas can say anything.
Dean makes himself a couple quesadillas on his stove, and makes sure to add some salsa. He usually grabs fast food for dinner, or eats whatever Charlie has. But tonight he didn’t feel like he could wait any longer for some food.
Castiel made popcorn for them while the first episode of the season started, Charlie sat on the couch with a box of tissues and a water bottle with her. At least she was staying hydrated, Castiel thought.
“Truth or dare!” She pointed at Dean.
They hadn’t even finished the episode when Charlie started talking about something unrelated.
“No, it’s a fair question. I lived in the dorms both freshmen and sophomore year and I was doing study abroad last year. Dorms are just familiar I suppose.” Castiel didn’t mind answering questions, though he thought it a bit odd how protective Sam’s brother was.
“Okay, I’m gonna grab a coffee. Anyone want anything?” Sam asks after suddenly standing up. Kevin and Brady ask for something, he looks to Jess. She Just lifts up a portable mug and shakes it. He hears the liquid and moves around all the students to get out of the room.
“The auto shop around the corner. We have great deals if you ever need work done on your vehicle.” He shamelessly advertised, she laughed at his charm.
“Yeah, your tattoo.” Cas didn’t realize Dean had seen the tattoo. He didn’t mind too much though.
“Sam tells me you’re a senior?” Dean asks him.
“Let’s skip the format though, gets repetitive.” Charlie starts. “Fucked a boy.”
“Truth, my head is still spinning.” He chokes out a laugh.
“I’m Sam.”
“Dean?”
“It’s nice that he lives so close.” Castiel concluded.
“Why is that so surprising?” Cas asked, sounding offended. Dean poked his stomach as if to see how strong he was. Cas wasn’t flexing at the moment so it hurt.
“Against my will.” Castiel responded, not looking up from his book. Sam could see Dean smiling out of the corner of his eye. But when he looked back at him, the smile was gone.
“Okay, okay, it’s good to see you too.” He said after a minute.
“She’s in all my pre law classes. We usually partner up for projects and sometimes study together. We go on walks together sometimes, just around campus at night. She’s, amazing Dean.”
“I have two classes, then a meeting with one of my professors. Then I think I will be studying with Hannah between classes and the meeting.” Castiel informed him. Sam nodded along, Castiel gave him a look that asked the same question.
“Cas truth or dare?”
He tried not to move too much, he didn’t want to wake Dean up. But he took a deep breath. So many things in his life have led to him being who he currently is. Should he be thankful for all the bad things that have happened? They all made him, him. Maybe that doesn’t justify evil. Maybe it does.
“This is my dorm building,” she said, pointing to a building in front of us.
He said his goodbyes to Ellen and Bobby of course. He briefly saw Ash before he left as well. Jo was on a road trip with her friends but Dean made sure to let her know that they’d see each other again.
“Meg, Daphne, Benjamin, and Jimmy.” Cas was about to move on before Dean stopped him.
He has a whole shelf dedicated to cowboy movies. He had been obsessed with them since he was a kid. The adventure and the cheesiness of them was priceless. Where else was he supposed to watch two guys have a shoot out in a quite ghost town, with the entire town watching on.
“You barely talk to Sam! How do you even know he’s not gay?”
“Twenty exactly.”
“You can tell me anything, you know that right?” Sam offered. Dean plastered on a smile and leaned back in his chair, picking up a pen again.
Also I hope you don’t mind, Cas is coming over to watch Tombstone
“Castiel! You ready?” Hannah asked when she met up with him after class. Castiel snapped from his thoughts and nodded with a smile.
And of course there was Jessica. She was amazing. She was sweet, smart, caring, and funny. And Sam definitely had a stupid crush on her. Any time they talked he got all flustered and said something stupid. She usually just laughed it off, but it was pretty embarrassing.
“We’re great! How are you Cas? Sorry, can I call you Cas?” She asked.
Dean got a text after episode two that had him jump off the couch with excitement.
“Huh, not what I was expecting. I thought you were gonna say she like, left wet towels on the floor or something.”
“What? I haven’t! And I’m pretty sure at least one of you has.”
“Yes, thank you. I’m afraid I’ve made a bit of a mess.” Dean chuckles and grabs his keys from his jacket pocket before heading out to his room. He stumbles around a bit, he’s obviously more drunk than he’s letting on.
“Cas, buddy, I am not even wearing socks right now.” Dean says while looking for the remote.
About twenty minutes later the food arrived and they were all stuffing their faces. Cas also got everyone a glass of water, he was certain they all needed it.
“Dare, while I’m still awake.”
“Well sorry for outing you man.” He seemed pretty casual, so that’s good at least.
“Jerk,” Sam says before Dean hangs up on him.
“I don’t know, I guess I just imagine you as this little nerdy guy. Didn’t think that you could probably beat someone up.” Dean says, pushing Cas’s shoulder a little. Cas smiles and rolls his eyes.
“Oh hey Cas,” he said, while giving Castiel a quick head nod and his signature smirk. Castiel looked up from his book and smiled just slightly.
“It’s for my friends, we’re studying.” He elaborates, though he’s not sure why he cares enough to do so.
“So... Tombstone?” Dean said moving on. Castiel tilted his head.
Sam is sort of hard to be friends with, he’s always busy. Castiel always feels like he’s annoying or distracting Sam. He is determined to be friends with him before the year ends though.
“I’ll grab us some seats, will you get our orders?” Hannah offered Castiel, he nodded and they moved to separate.
“Castiel is a senior.”
“Okay truth or dare Charlie.”
“No dude. First of all, I’m not gay. Second of all, I would never sleep with your roommate. Even if I was gay.” Dean still didn’t look at him.
“Yeah Dean, I’m fine.”
“It’s funny, I was just thinking how pretty your eyes look in the sun. They light up.” She blushes but doesn’t look away. She actually moves closer to him, making their arms flush as she leans on him.
He didn’t finish high school, but he was pretty good with cars so he was confident he could find a job as a mechanic somewhere close to Sam’s university. He worked briefly as a mechanics assistant for his Uncle Bobby while Sam was finishing up high school. How hard could it be to find a job and a place to live close to Sam?
“My friend forced me. Then immediately went upstairs with her boyfriend.” He tried to sound annoyed and not pathetic, he cared a great deal about what Dean though of him for some reason.
“Okay, here’s the name of the game. We drink anytime Angel makes a bad decision, anytime we’re annoyed by Darla, whenever our favorite character says something stupid, If Cordelia gets a vision, and if the bad guy of the episode is a vampire.” Dean rattles off.
But for the most part, his childhood was cold. In every meaning of the word.
“Okay, three options. Truth or dare, and if you don’t answer or don’t do the dare, you have to drink. Another reason to play after you’re already drunk, if you don’t play you might pass out.” She slapped her legs in excitement.
“Thanks to you.”
“Truth!”
“Oh Dean loves that show.” Sam says.
“Sam?” She asked after a minute.
“Okay tell us about Cassie, Lisa, and Kaylee.” Charlie prompted him more. Dean seemed to shift slightly, like he wanted an out. Cas noticed the change in name, but Dean didn’t correct her. Maybe Lee was a nickname.
It’s stupid that he’s nervous around her. They’re officially dating now. She is his girlfriend. He is her boyfriend. It’s Sam’s first official girlfriend though, and that’s the reasoning he uses as to why she makes him so nervous.
“Whoa whoa whoa, I had to go into details so do you. Lay it out there buddy.” Dean gestured to the table with his hand.
Right? Neither of them thought of each other that way? He was almost certain of it. But why only almost? He laid down in his bed, staring at the ceiling.
“No problem Cas.” His smile got bigger as he patted Castiel on the back. Castiel tilted his head and squinted his eyes. No one had ever called him that.
“I don’t think anyone has ever considered me a nickname person.” He looked at the ground, barely blushing.
“I didn’t know you were seeing someone,” Dean nodded at Castiel. Castiel just rolled his eyes.
“What is?”
“Smoked weed.” Dean said. Charlie put a finger down and Cas drank.
Castiel wasn’t sure where that nickname came from, but he didn’t mind it. He also didn’t mind anything about that lunch. It seemed so natural yet Hannah didn’t suspect that they were just friends. Maybe romantic partners are really just friends when in public.
“Man I’ve been there.” He shook his head like he was remembering something, then took another sip of his beer.
“Go get em’! I’m gonna head on home alright?” Sam nodded, grabbing a jacket.
“No, you?”
He pulled the shirt off and folded it neatly in his bag before picking up Dean’s shirt.
“I actually went to a cafe. Right by your campus. Saw Cas there with his friend Hannah.” Dean is obviously distracted by whatever he’s working on.
“Uh, yeah. Couple times actually.” He didn’t offer up anything else and none of us pushed him to share. Cas wasn’t sure what he was feeling in his stomach, maybe he was getting drunk.
“Gilda was important to you. You guys were in love. It’s normal to be heart broken now that she’s gone.”
Dean shook his thoughts aside and moved to put his things away.
“Don’t worry about it.” Dean says. They watch a couple episodes together, talking during it cause they’ve all seen it before.
His apartment wasn’t too bad either. It was a nice place to go after his tiring day of work. Something about the crappy bed that he fell into every night just felt right. Even if he could feel the springs in the bed. It was still the first place he’d ever had all to himself.
“Yeah I know,” he grumbles to his stomach. He’s going to grab some food- but only after a nice and long shower. That last car left him feeling especially covered in grease.
“I’m Dean, Sam’s older brother.” Dean moved Sam to shake the new guy’s hand. Dean noticed the sincerity in his handshake, a firm but not rough shake. He also noticed the curiosity in the man’s eyes. The bright blue eyes, he noted, that were staring right into his.
Sam opened the door of his dorm when his brother knocked on it. Dean walked in without any hesitation. Seemed about right.
“Charlie, she’s your best friend right?” Jess asked him. The two of them had grown close over the past couple weeks, since Jess had been in and out of the room often.
“I can wait until your break if that’d be better?” Sam asks him.
Sam had been going to classes for about a week, and had been on campus for about two weeks. He loves it, it’s so different from back home. People here are so much more open minded. Which is pretty important when wanting to be lawyer. He had even made a few friends! Okay, that’s not exactly true. He considered himself friends with Castiel, and he talked to Madison and Jessica pretty much everyday, but only in class. He hadn’t gone to any parties, which greatly surprised Dean.
Wrong. On his first few days, Cas made sure to be early for class, to scope out seats and the rooms themselves. As much as he tried to avoid Dean, there he was, walking through the door. Shit.
Random Shark Fact of the day: The Mako Shark (my favorite shark) has the largest brain-to-body ratio of any shark and is also the fastest shark in the ocean.
“Oh, that happened a long time ago,” Cas responded before kissing Dean.
“Yes.”
Cas starts to say something but Dean claps his hand over his mouth.
He chuckled and shook his head, glad to have made a new friend.
Glad to be allowed to spend the night with his friend, he scarfed down dinner when it was given to him and they both stayed up all night gaming, and during this time he had managed to earn the half fond, half teasing nickname of ‘handmaiden’. Sometime during the night, all thoughts of Cas were pushed to the back of his mind as he fell back into his usual routine.
Before they could say anything, a rude customer at another table stood up and tapped the waitress on the shoulder demanding that the waitress “give him the check right this instant”.
“I believe it is,” Cas responded to Sam who laughed and left the room.
School starts next week, so I may not update for two weeks or something, but I will try to finish the next chapter before that.
“Cute,” Cas said in that rough voice of his, and thoughts of what that voice would sound like in bed made him blush. He is glad that the cold is hiding his blush, but that is all that the snow is good for.
Random Shark Fact: Thresher sharks use their tails as a whip to stun and kill their prey.
Castiel Milton (smart / hard working / dedicated / loyal / works at the school library / acts all proper at school, but actually dresses like a punk straight out of hot topic - or well, not straight, more like gay out of hot topic / kind / 19 y/o /  openly gay / has siblings - Anna 24, Lucien (Luci or Luc) 23, Gabe 21 / fav band is Bowling For Soup)
The sudden cheers of the crowd surprised him, and he snapped his neck up quickly, breaking their eye contact. After collecting his bearings, he let out a soft, “woah”
“I’m not gonna copy off ya, but I might take you up on your offer a couple times.”
“I’m stuck on an assignment, nothing much. I’m used to it.”
"Love you too Jerk, tell me when you are available to hang out." Sam said, heading towards the door.
“I will. Goodbye, Cas.”
“Watch your elbows, Cas!” Dean hissed angrily after getting poked in the ribs a few times too many.
Garth Fitzgerald IV (token straight / ally / very kind / dog person / dating Bess) Yes, Garth is a dog person because he is a werewolf, and yes I do think I am very clever for thinking of that.
“Hi,” she whispered, “Um, I was wondering if I could sit here? All the other tables are full and I really need to get work done. I’d do it at my dorm, but I just love the atmosphere of the library. It’s super Hermione of me, but it’s true,” she rambled, still in a soft whisper. He recognized the girl from some of his classes, her name was Charlie.
“This guy was really hot, Charlie.”
“I can order for you, I know what you like.”
“Sorry, the snow froze my brain.” He joked.
They shrugged and restarted their earlier conversation. When they heard the man say that he was “Not leaving a tip because real men don’t tip,” Dean stood up in anger.
“But I know that’s what you meant. And hey, if you don’t mind me saying, you’re not so bad yourself.”
“Cas,” he said, choosing to stare at him instead of coming up with an explanation.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not exactly rejected…” he trailed off, wondering how to explain the situation well enough.
“I don’t know.”
“No offence, but your parents sound like paranoid dickbags.
He shouted in surprise. “Cas?!?”
“When?” Dean asked, hoping that Cas had not heard his crying confession.
“Well, I’m bi so… yeah. I like guys and chicks.” Dean responded shyly, “And, uh, Cas and I met over the summer at the concert you guys bailed on, but I had no idea he would be transferring to our school, and I just couldn’t believe the universe would do something good for me. I never expected to see him again, and my denial made me overlook the obvious.”
When they finally separated, they were in similar states of disarray, with Dean’s shirt wrinkled and his fly unzipped - exactly when that happened, he had no idea. A quick look at Cas proved that he was in a similar state. Cas’ lips were swollen and red, and oh god, his hair. His hair already looked messy, but now it was almost obscene. This gorgeous man before him had some of the hottest sex hair he had ever seen in his life. And they didn’t even have sex!
“Yes?”
He ended up in three classes with Dean. Because of course he did. That was just his luck. But hey, who complains when he gets to be with a hot guy for half of his classes. Not him.
“My parents would take the word of myself and my siblings over the word of a stranger.” Cas replied tensely.
"Shut it you sasquatch." Dean grumbled.
“What?” Dean looks at him more intently, “Oh.”
Charlie was smirking at him, humor sparkling in her eyes. Benny and Garth were smiling in proud confusion, Ash had his head tilted, and Lee’s expression was difficult to read.
He twisted and connected his lips to Cas’, quickly slipping into his mouth. A hand grabbed his waist and pulled him closer so they were as completely pressed together as they could be while inside a car. Cas grabbed a fistful of his hair and pulled, sending sparks of pleasure through his body. Oh, that felt good. He moaned into Cas’ mouth before pulling away to rest their foreheads together. Seeing Cas’ lips swollen by his kiss sent waves of satisfaction rolling through him.
Cas and Dean were too otherwise occupied to notice that they were even moving.
And if, when they got home, they went immediately to Dean’s room, well, nobody else had to know.
Dean was completely closeted, even partially to himself, so he may not even be out to his friends yet. And what would I even say? ‘Hello, Dean. Remember me? It’s Cas, ya know, from the concert? Aka the night where I had the best kiss of my life. Wanna do it again?’ Yeah, like that’s gonna work.
“He wants to make sure he isn’t stuck in any classes with your dumb ass,” Crowley said in that posh way that he always insulted people in.
“What show?”
“You look cute when you blush.” Cas whispered in reverence.
“I need a break anyway, and I always like helping. I insist.”
Dean’s mouth is full of delicious pie so he can’t respond to explain the situation, but Cas responds quickly.
“One more person is coming,” Charlie said with a smirk. And not her fun, half-smile smirk either, her mischief smirk - the one that meant trouble.
Dean attempted to feel a pulse, but his hands were too numb from the cold to feel anything.
“Hey, hey It’s ok.” he pulls out his wallet and hands the waitress a $50 that was inside. “This should cover that asshole’s tip, I believe.”
“Yeah. You got a problem with that, Dean?”
“Hey, Cas, do you have a ride home?”
“Hey, I’m here. sorry for being late.” a voice said behind him, cutting off his inner thoughts.
“They played last night.”
Notes on characters + some characters that didn't make it in:
“Thank you for being so good to your friend. All I had was my brother, Gabriel. He helped me out by pretty much handing me a huge stack of porn and said ‘have fun’ before he bolted out of my room.”
“What are you talking about, he loves me!” Lee said with a little too much glee for 7:00 in the morning. “Don't cha, Dean,” he asked.
Just a deleted scene or two that I liked, but couldn't fit into the story and also some notes I had written down about this.
“What song is this? I haven’t heard it before.” Dean whispered as Cas sang loudly along with the crowd.
“That sounds interesting.”
Cas nodded in understanding and smiled at Dean.
Looking up to meet Cas’ eyes made him once again realize how blue they were. They were sparkling in the dim, evening light, and they were the most beautiful shade of blue that Dean had ever seen in his life.
“His name is Dean. He was in a couple of the classes that you and I have together.
His change in subject seemed to have worked. “Yeah, I have three siblings. Anna, the oldest, is twenty-four and she practically raised us considering how much our father traveled for business and our mother was indifferent about our existence. Then there’s Lucien, but we call him Luci or Luc, and he is twenty-three. He has had some...incidents with the law, the result of which is what made me realize that my parents can never know the true me. My favorite brother is twenty-one and named Gabriel but everybody calls him Gabe. I’m the closest to him and he helps cover for me the most and he also helped me out when I realized how I wanted to dress and act was not fit to my parents’ standards.”

“Best kiss of my life Cas?” He asked, not trusting the universe to grant him this small miracle. Why would he, Dean Winchester, be given the man he had pined for all summer? Nothing good ever happened to him, so why would it happen to him now?
“I guess I could say that you fell for me.” Dean smiled.
As they are walking out, he hears Sam say his name. “Hey, I have to go to the bathroom,” Sam said, gesturing behind him, “You guys can wait in the car.”
Meg Masters (friends with Cas / flirty Omnisexual / like Jack Harkness / kinda butts heads with Dean but they don’t fight / 19 y/o / Rachel Miner Meg)
He waited for about ten minutes while Cas worked in silence, but he was startled by a shout from Cas followed by a thump.
Castiel: My worst class is probably physics, and my best class is probably history. Seriously, sometimes it feels like I've lived through it.
A spike of embarrassment flashed through him and his cheeks flushed slightly. “That obvious huh?”
The last few weeks of summer were a great distraction to keep his mind off of Cas; all the shopping for clothes and supplies for his dorm and the checking of supply lists and the double-checking of supply lists along with the usual end of summer distractions were keeping him quite busy.
After about a half hour of talking and joking around, they both wandered up the steps to go to the bathroom before their drives back home. They finished up quickly and walked back outside.
Cas turns to him worried, beginning to fuss over him again when the waitress coos at the sight.
*Sam randomly stops by for a visit and walks in on Dean and Cas making out on the couch.*
His eyes snapped up from his shoes and he looked Cas in his blue, blue eyes. Dean’s cheeks flushed even more and he nodded. Dean gasped quietly as Cas moved his other hand to Dean’s cheek, never breaking their eye contact.
“Good. I suppose it was worth it to fall off the roof.”
Cas slowly cupped his face and he leaned into the soft touch almost immediately.
“We flirted a bit, then all of a sudden he was kissing me, and god, Charlie, he was such a good kisser. It was like the best kiss of my life. And we kissed more than once too. He even kissed me goodbye!”
