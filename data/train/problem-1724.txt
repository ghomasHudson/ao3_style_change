His face does look a bit greenish, and Sherlock’s anger deflates. It’s odd to think that the same event that kick-started Sherlock’s sex life ended John’s. It seems to have pushed the two of them to the opposite ends of the sexuality spectrum; Sherlock’s libido speaks loud and clear to him now, demanding to be fed at regular intervals, while John “Three Continents” Watson seems to have become more sex-repulsed than Sherlock had ever been. Sherlock isn’t sure how he feels about that. Before, he would have been pleased if John decided not to pursue any more relationships, but now it makes him feel uncomfortable – one more indication of how wrong things have become.
“God, Sherlock,” John sighed and shimmied his hips, tugging clumsily at his pants and pulling them down, giving Sherlock better access.
Sherlock doesn’t answer when John calls his name at the door, so he enters and finds him sitting at the kitchen table, staring at a cup of tea.
benefit from each other’s presence, like they used to in the past.
“Yeah, that’s it, keep moving,” Terry gasps before Sherlock has noticed that he
“Adorable and hot,” John added, burying his hands in Sherlock hair to ruffle it even more and bring Sherlock’s head down to kiss him again. John’s tongue was slick and hot as it licked into Sherlock’s mouth, his lips hungry, but nothing about the way he kissed Sherlock felt insistent or demanding – it was more like an offering, all his love and desire laid out for Sherlock to take whatever he wanted from it.
“That sounds… reasonable,” he says, struggling to get the words out. His throat is pinhole tight and a strange sort of cotton fog seems to be filling his mind. He and John, talking and
“Lie still,” John tells him as he positions himself between Sherlock legs. “Come for me.” And before Sherlock’s dazed brain can process what’s going on, John swallows him to the hilt. Sherlock feels his cock hit the back of John’s throat and he all but screams, pleasure reaching an impossible height as John pushes two fingers where Sherlock is filled with John’s come. Sherlock’s back arches as John hollows his cheeks, sucking hard,  and crooks his fingers just
is a mess. It’s all him, isn’t it? He’s the one who has to fix it. He has to fix it before he can even begin to be a friend to Sherlock worthy of the name, let alone contemplate being anything else.
He doesn’t say what he needs, which makes Sherlock want to give it to him even more. He pushes at John’s shoulders, reversing their positions. Oral sex might be a little unimaginative, considering it’s what they did the last time, but Sherlock’s options are limited, and he isn’t prepared for anything else.
John’s mouth attaches itself to Sherlock’s uncovered nipple before he can answer, and he moans in pleasure. He’d forgotten how good his body can feel. He wants more of it, wants everything, wants John.
“On your forehead,” John explains, then picks up a napkin from the table and wipes something off Sherlock’s forehead. Sherlock ducks his head, feeling a blush rise up in his cheeks.
“So pretty,” John whispers, pleased by the shiver that runs through Sherlock when John’s breath hits his heated skin. Inspired, John breathes a hot puff of breath directly against Sherlock’s entrance, and he’s rewarded by a desperate sound that tears itself from Sherlock’s throat.
“Are you a screamer, then?” he pants, rocking his hips forward.
Sherlock stays where he is as John comes down, stroking John’s thighs, utterly at a loss for what to do now.
This is how it’s supposed to be, Sherlock thinks or maybe just
. Why shouldn’t he look for someone who’d be able to provide more of the same? He’s supposed to seek out positive things, after all.
“Touch yourself,” he tells Sherlock as he begins to thrust faster, unable to pace himself any longer
He’s been experimenting on his own ever since Bristol, first with his fingers, then a slim beginner’s prostate massager he’s purchased. The beginnings were not bad, strictly speaking, but uncomfortable and made him feel awkward and embarrassed even though he was alone and no one would ever know how long he spent with just the tip of his little finger inside of himself, breathing fast and shallow. He was impatient and annoyed at his inability to just relax and do it, but he forced himself to give himself time, and eventually he got the hang of it and started to really enjoy himself and even progressed to a slightly larger toy. Prostate stimulation feels extremely good, he’s discovered, and even just having something inside of him, the stretch and fullness, is quite pleasurable with sufficient preparation and lubrication. He’s determined to experience it with a partner: normal, good sex, enjoyable for both parties. Or perhaps not even good – it may be awkward and messy and not entirely satisfying, but it will be safe and fully consensual and done out of mutual attraction and desire. He wants that. He
Sherlock whimpers, utterly unable to articulate an answer. He feels like his mind his full of woolly fog, empty but for John.
“Yes,” John says, soft but firm as he pulls Sherlock into his arms again. “We can.”
John returns his attentions to Sherlock’s lips at that, but he’s a little gentler now, and the kiss doesn’t last nearly as long as Sherlock would want it to before John pulls away, actually pulls away, extricating himself from Sherlock’s arms and sitting up.
John smiles at him, like Sherlock’s answer actually makes him happy, and Sherlock can’t help but smile back.
, and Sherlock can rest.
“We can do it, though.”
“What would you like?” he asks.
Finally, John’s hips move in a rapid succession of sharp, powerful stabs until he buries himself deep inside Sherlock and comes, unabashedly vocal in his release.
Sherlock can’t fathom what it means. Why would John want to live with Harry, of all people? He wasn’t willing to go to her when he was fresh out of Afghanistan, but now he is? Why? And apparently he left shortly after Sherlock did – was it for the same reason? Did he want to get away from Sherlock too? But why cut contact with Molly, too? Does he want to distance himself from Sherlock so much that he doesn’t want them to have any friends in common? … Or is he ashamed? Sherlock wonders for the umpteenth time what John’s feelings are about what happened between them, but Molly’s news don’t really help him find the answer.
In the kitchen, he finds Molly, humming to herself to the rhythm of the song and… cleaning the fridge?
He did it quickly, ignoring any discomfort he felt. His fingers were larger than John’s and having two of them inside him already made him feel uncomfortably full, but he forced himself to accept a third – John would be much wider. He wasn’t nearly as thorough as John would have been and he knew it would probably hurt when John entered him, but that didn’t matter: he had to be quick and efficient now, not give himself time to think about it too much and lose his nerve.
Sherlock freezes, blinks into the semi-darkness tinged orange by the street lamps. John has his face in his hands and there is a glass and a bottle on the side table (the port Sherlock got after the dognapping case two weeks ago). It’s too dark for Sherlock to tell how much of the contents are gone. What does this mean?
Irene inclines her head to the side, narrowing her eyes slightly, clearly trying to figure out the reasons behind Sherlock’s questions. “That you were afraid of making yourself vulnerable and would only sleep with someone you trusted completely. That deep down, you were a hopeless romantic and would only give your body to the one who already had your heart, and it was obvious who
“Oh, um.” Molly blushes harder, looking down at her hands. “Yes. Well, no. I made my move, actually.” She looks up at him, smiling shyly. “It’s only been two weeks, but. It’s good.”
He lies in bed that night thinking about what
When he came back to the bedroom John had decided that in fact he needed the bathroom too, so Sherlock was left sitting on the edge of the bed, waiting, so, naturally, he had plenty of time for his nerves to come back. It was different this time, of course, because now he knew he wouldn’t have to go out of his comfort zone to please John, but that didn’t mean he’d be any good.
“Come on, then” John breathed against Sherlock’s mouth, and then took Sherlock’s mouth in his, leading him to Sherlock’s bedroom.
“God, like this, yes,
“John,” he says carefully, “I understand what you’re saying, but I… I want you to know that I feel safe with you nevertheless. You’ve made tremendous progress since you started the therapy, don’t think I haven’t noticed. You now react with anger to only 36 percent of the situations that you would have before, and when you do get angry, it takes you significantly longer to get there and the intensity is lower. I don’t believe there’s anything in you that deserves to be called a monster, but if there was, I have complete faith that you now have the ability to reign it in. And… I believe you won’t hurt me because I’m... asking you not to. I don’t want you to.  Should I change my mind about this, I’ll let you know in explicit terms. Unless I do that, you should assume I don’t… consent, even if I don’t do anything to stop you.”
The case took two days and there wasn’t much time to focus on anything else, but there was a strange new undercurrent between them now, the knowledge that soon, soon, they would make love. Sherlock certainly wasn’t planning on waiting, even though he knew he could. He wanted to give John what he deserved.
There is only one small problem: it seems that John doesn’t want to have sex with him.
coming like an avalanche, his whole body convulsing.
They rest for almost an hour, and John is stirred from a light doze when Sherlock begins squirming in his arms.
John picks up Rosie from the Stamfords exactly at the agreed time.
When Sherlock first moved to his quaint little rented cottage, the first thing he noticed was that there were beehives in his closest neighbour’s garden. He was immediately and vividly reminded of childhood summers spent in the Sussex Downs with his beekeeper grandfather, and how he imagined that when he was old, he would do exactly the same – live a little cottage and keep bees. He’d set off for the Cotswolds with the intention pursue things he already knew gave him pleasure, but to also look for new ones, and beekeeping seemed like something that was sure to fit the bill. And so once he had settled in, he asked his neighbour to introduce him to the art of beekeeping.
“I can assure you I haven’t taken anything you might object to,” Sherlock snaps and stands up brusquely. He hasn’t noticed his dressing down had nearly come undone in his sleep, and he panics a little as it threatens to unveil his nudity, but he manages to tie it again just in time. (Not that John would care. Seeing Sherlock naked would do exactly nothing for him.) Not looking at John, Sherlock stalks to the bathroom before John can say anything about the fact that the only reason he’s come is the fact that Sherlock is an irresponsible drug addict.
Gradually, as Sherlock slowly catalogued every single aspect of the situation that felt good, he became aware that there was John’s erection pressing into his backside. He froze for a moment, but then relaxed almost immediately – this was a normal physiological reaction, quite commonplace in the morning. Additionally, he found that now that he wasn’t worried about being split open by it, the size was quite a turn-on. He shifted experimentally, and felt his own cock react in interest.
Sherlock hands John his cup of tea. He doesn’t know what to say, so he says nothing. John takes the mug and looks at it intently as if looking for answers, or inspiration.
Sherlock’s climax is explosive. He screams John’s name and thrashes about violently, nearly dislodging John’s grip on him and producing far more come than should be possible for a fourth orgasm. It seems to go on forever, the vibrations drawing additional ripples of pleasure from Sherlock’s body as John strokes him through it. Before stimulation can give way to pain, though, John lets go of Sherlock’s cock and turns the vibrations off, and Sherlock sags limply into John’s embrace. He’s breathing hard, releasing a soft keening sound on every exhale.
“Right,” John says, and then again, “Oh! Right.” as he reaches the wrong conclusion. It’s dark enough and the dressing gown is loose enough for John not to notice that Sherlock is still hard. It’s better this way – the desire to feel John’s hand on him is strong, but he couldn’t bear to let John touch him and know that he must be suppressing disgust. Better let John believe Sherlock came untouched.
Sherlock swallows around a lump in his throat. It’s… unexpectedly touching to hear John say that. The urge to touch him is stronger than ever, but he resists.
“You don’t know what I was going to say.”
If Sherlock still held on to the belief that he’s above base human urges, he’d have to abandon that belief now once and for all, because Terry’s words work on him despite his fear. Something male and primal in him responds to the invitation to
“Sherlock – there’s some on yours too.”
Sherlock nods, grateful that John suggested Molly rather than himself. “Yes. That would be… acceptable.”
“More than sure. I want it.”
, and he’s using it to give him pleasure, to make him beg for more and meet his thrusts with vigour. It’s heady, almost more arousing than the actual feeling of Terry’s passage squeezing and rubbing him, the knowledge that he’s the one doing this, making someone feel good. John couldn’t have felt anything remotely like this. His cock feels fuller than ever as he thrusts harder, making Terry moan louder. He feels on the brink of orgasm but he does his best to hold on, wanting to let Terry come first – it just seems right that way.
Sherlock laughs, preening at the admiration for John. “I don’t think that suggestion would go over well. And anyway… I don’t like to share.” He knows he would never be able to do what Sam and Patrick do. He wants John for himself, to build the kind of intimacy where no one else can be admitted.
John leans in to kiss him, gentle but with unmistakable intent.
They stare at him, the excited, slightly leering expressions disappearing off their faces. Sherlock shuffles his feet awkwardly.
He looks up at John, who is watching him expectantly.
There’s silence between them, interrupted only by the ambient sound of the restaurant. Irene’s beautiful eyes seem deeply sad.
John isn’t going to last very long, not with the noises Sherlock’s making, but he doesn’t have to. Sherlock lets out a series of escalating moans that can only mean one thing, and the knowledge that he’s about to give Sherlock his second orgasm in such a short time would be enough to push John over the edge even if he hadn’t been holding himself off for ages. The pleasure that has been pooling at the bottom of his stomach brims and spills, knocking the wind out of him with its intensity.
“Well, let’s not pretend it didn’t take you literal years to finally accept my invitation.”
He believes him, and the feeling is so disarming he has to pull John closer again, hide his face in his shoulder.
me do anything I didn’t want. I made my own decisions and I did it all willingly.”
“And for what it’s worth, we’re not opposed to foursomes, just so you know,” Sam says, wiggling his eyebrows. “Watson seemed pretty hot in some of the pictures.”
like that, like that, yes! You’re
He watches himself disappear between Terry’s firm buttocks, and somehow the sheer erotic charge of that visual combined with the tightness and Terry’s nearly pornographic moan (probably exaggerated for Sherlock’s benefit, but that doesn’t matter) helps him leave the anxious headspace and let his bodily sensations override everything else. He cries out and begins thrusting, trying to angle his hips to target Terry’s prostate as much as possible.
and he couldn’t get any of it. His cock was sliding against wet cotton and it was not enough John’s fingers were driving into him and it was too much and his only points of contact with John were the fingers inside him and the hand on his hip and the lube made ugly squelching noises and John was murmuring incomprehensible words and Sherlock was moaning, loud desperate keening sounds, and he couldn’t breathe, his heart was hammering, he was going to hyperventilate and have a panic attack unless he stopped it, he had to stop it, he couldn’t ruin this for John, he couldn’t he couldn’t he couldn’t—
John laughs, but then seems to hesitate and sits up straighter. He looks at Sherlock with unexpected seriousness.
Sherlock’s movements get frantic and his voice louder, the thrusts of his hips so powerful that John has trouble keeping his foot in place.
He relieves his bladder and splashes water over his face to wake up properly, and only then does he notice that the water from the bath has been drained and the floor is dry. Which means that John must have done it.
He kissed him, and Sherlock used all his remaining strength to kiss back, hoping to show John without words that he was thankful too, for John’s patience and care and understanding. That John loved him so much would never cease to amaze him.
“What
Sherlock takes hold of John’s cock and slowly sinks down on it, brimming with need. He moans loudly as it fills him, unable to keep quiet.
“Don’t” John tells him, and he gently pries Sherlock’s lip from between his teeth. “Don’t hold yourself back.”
He’s despicable.
He doesn’t say he forgives John, and he knows John hears him not saying it.
. At this angle, he doesn’t really hit John’s prostate, but that’s for the best, really, because John doesn’t want to come yet, but it’s amazing anyway, to feel Sherlock so unrestrained. John’s going to feel this for days, but he doesn’t care, he only wants to give Sherlock the pleasure he needs.
As much as Sherlock enjoys spending time with John and Rosie, it always makes him a little nervous when it’s in public, because people sometimes tend to assume that he’s Rosie’s other parent. John no longer jumps in immediately to insist that he’s not gay and usually doesn’t correct people unless not correcting them would lead to further misunderstandings and awkwardness (clearly out of consideration for Sherlock, to avoid drawing more attention that necessary to the fact that they’re not a couple), but it obviously makes him uncomfortable.
he was when fully erect. Before, thinking about John’s above-average endowment had been mouth-wateringly arousing. Now, when it was no longer just a fantasy, it was… still arousing, but also just plain terrifying at the same time. Sherlock couldn’t imagine how something that big could possibly fit inside him… and that was most certainly what was going to happen.
—you—
“Nothing like what you’re thinking. I don’t like pain,” Sherlock gets out finally. “I don’t mind if things get a little rough, but I don’t like purposefully inflicted pain. I can bear it, but I don’t get off on it. I don’t like being restrained. I don’t like any form of humiliation, verbal or physical. But I understand all of that is generally part of the deal.”
“Okay, love,” John said, holding Sherlock tighter. “Whatever you need. I’ll always ask you before I do something, does that sound good? And you’ll tell me if there’s anything you don’t like, or anything you’d like to change, all right?”
“A vampire, huh? And you willing to give him the time of day?”
His first meeting with his therapist is the following day. He doesn’t really believe some idiot with a psychology degree can help him, that

“John. You
—John—John—I need—Jo-
He grabs a tube of lubricant from the bedside table and positions himself behind Sherlock, where he can see Sherlock’s hole still glistening with John’s saliva. He slicks himself up quickly and then presses inside without preamble.
There is a short pause.
“No,” Sherlock says quickly. “But I. I haven’t actually… done that. Before.”
John huffs out a laugh and Sherlock’s heart lurches in his chest. He loves that sound. He’d forgotten how much he loved that sound.
“No,” John says quietly. “That part of my life is over, I think.” Sherlock wants to point out that that part of John’s life hasn’t even properly begun, but John continues. “I really don’t think I can be… intimate... with
He startles from his contemplation when he hears footsteps on the stairs. Molly’s on duty today, and she usually doesn’t come before six, so it’s unexpected to hear someone coming so early in the afternoon, but it becomes almost immediately obvious that this isn’t Molly’s tread. It’s John.
But then, just when John begins to feel his orgasm building, Sherlock stops, and when John opens his eyes, he finds Sherlock straddling him and getting ready to sink down on John’s cock.
“Okay,” Sherlock says, trying not to make his relief too obvious. “That’s… good.”
It really isn’t Sherlock’s area, but he assumes there are five possible reasons for this:
By the afternoon it was beginning to look like he would work himself into a panic before they even started, so he had to act. He’d been vaguely hoping they could maybe do it in the dark so that at least he wouldn’t have to worry so much about what he looked like to John, but he couldn’t risk waiting any longer, and so when he was (pretending to be) reading on the sofa and John joined him for a bit of a cuddle, he used the opportunity.
She clearly realises how rattled he is and doesn’t push him too hard, but she does ask him to tell her his true name and to be honest with her because she can’t help him otherwise. They don’t talk about anything too serious, she introduces him to how things work at Haus Talblick and what additional therapies and activities he can choose to complement their daily sessions, Sherlock tells her briefly who he is and outlines his drug history without going into details. But he tells her the truth because there’s no point in hiding – it’s simultaneously terrifying and liberating.
He nods. “Thank you.”
“Yes,” Sherlock breathed. Just the thought of John’s hand on his penis was overpowering – John had never actually done that before, not skin on skin, and Sherlock felt himself go a little faint in anticipation as his heartrate increased further and his breathing went shallower – he could barely move as he struggled out of his pyjama bottoms.
“It’s all right, love, I’m here.” He slides back under the covers, pulling Sherlock close. Sherlock latches onto him, letting out a dry sob. “I’m so sorry, darling, I’m back now and won’t leave again, I promise. Here, I brought you some water. You’ll drink a bit, won’t you?”
Molly looks at him as if he had just asked why she thought rain had anything to do with clouds. “He didn’t even know you’d gone. You wrote him a
“It’s all right if you can’t,” John assures him, because the key to Sherlock’s pleasure is making sure he doesn’t feel pressured. “I can make you come in other ways. But I think you can. You’re halfway there already, aren’t you, just from the thought of it.”
John making love to him. Rewriting the memories of the assault with tenderness, erasing bruises with caresses, dissolving anger and pain with mutual desire and care.
taken anything not sanctioned by the NHS, and that’s all. He doesn’t want to talk about anything of import, (not Mary, not Rosie, not how he’s feeling or what he’s doing with his life), he doesn’t want to join Sherlock on cases and he listens to Sherlock talking about the ones he solved on his own with only half an ear. He’s morose at best angry the rest of the time, and usually comes to Baker Street via a pub, as if he couldn’t bear to look at Sherlock sober.
“Hey,” John says softly, ever the caring friend even when he must be utterly disgusted. “You all right?”
“I… uh…” he stammers, but Maggie just pats his hand and smiles.
When John settles between Sherlock’s spread legs and their erection slot next to each other, it’s perfection. They gasp into each other’s mouths as they begin moving in a delicious rhythm. John was right when he said it’s different when it’s with someone you love – this is simple friction, but with John, it feels like magic.
Sherlock wakes in pale early morning light with John’s arm thrown around his waist, John’s breath tickling his neck. His bladder is full, his throat parched and he’s a little too warm, but he doesn’t do anything about it for long moments, relishing the fact that he’s in bed with John Watson, waking up after a night of passion. Just a few weeks ago, this would have been a painful fantasy, and now it’s true. This is his life now.
“Yeah,” he says, and at least has the decency to go faintly pink. “I’m sorry, but that was way too hot.”
of issues to work through but I’m getting better, I think. I don’t want to be that person anymore. I don’t think you really want to have anything to do with me anymore but I want you to know that I
It’s like what he’s done on his own many times and at the same time completely different when Robert begins opening him up with gentle fingers. It’s wonderfully thrilling not to know exactly where Robert’s fingers are going to press next, how hard, how deep. Then Robert swallows him to the root and Sherlock loses himself in the sensations, and it’s only because he’s so keyed up that he doesn’t come just from that unexpectedly wonderful mix of stimuli.
trust himself not to revert to his old patterns?
He leaves the dressing gown on the floor and slips under the covers. The feel of lube between his buttocks is uncomfortable. Has he used too much of it? Or maybe too little. How long can he stay adequately stretched? He hopes John will hurry if he wants to join him, before Sherlock can actually work himself into a panic. He hates how nervous it makes him feel – it’s all just transport, after all, and he should be glad if he gets to use it to give John pleasure.
There was a hand on his hip, steadying him, positioning him.
Despite how tempting John looked, Sherlock knew he’d just keep worrying about his breath if he didn’t brush his teeth now and that really wouldn’t help him to behave like a functional human being capable of having sex. He slipped to the bathroom and brushed his teeth quickly, and then wet a flannel and wiped down under his arms and between his legs – better safe than sorry.
did).
“John,
“No,” he whispers, “not like this anymore.” He takes Sherlock’s hand and leads him to his bedroom.
“I know,” Sherlock says, because he does – the knowledge is rather overwhelming, but it’s crystal clear.
“Want one?” Terry asks, offering Sherlock a half-full box of cigarettes. Sherlock hesitates – he shouldn’t, he told himself he’d stop smoking too, but this is a clear invitation for him not to leave just yet. He takes a cigarette and gratefully slides back in bed next to Terry, leaning against the headboard.
It’s not unexpected – Sherlock has known it would happen ever since the start – but the rejection still feels like a kick.
“Fuck!” John groans as Sherlock’s lips wrap around the tip of his cock, his hips jerking. Sherlock has no experience to draw on, but it isn’t difficult to follow the cues of John’s body, to find out what John likes, how hard to suck, where to press his tongue. John’s cock is thick and heavy in Sherlock’s mouth and Sherlock’s world narrows down just to the feeling of it sliding between his lips, just to the overpowering need to give John what he wants.
, Sherlock has wanted this for so long, to have John in his arms, finally, touching him, kissing him—
“Okay, so it’s not very good manners, but it’s not like you did it on purpose, and I knew there had to be someone anyway.”
Sherlock freezes. He can physically feel his erection flagging. In his focus on avoiding anyone who’d only be interested in putting their penis in
,” he groans as he buries himself in John’s body. He folds himself around John, pressing his chest against John’s back, hugging John to him. “John, John.”
“Are they clean?” John asks, and when Sherlock nods, he takes out the butt plug and reaches for the lube. “Come back here.”
He gasps when the first finger breaches him, slick but uncompromising. He fights his body’s instinctive reaction to clench and resist the intrusion and tries to relax as much as he can. The finger moves in and out, in and out a few times at fast, rough pace but it’s not too bad. All too soon, however, it’s joined by another one and that burns a little, pushing at his inner walls, stretching him, working him open without finesse.
John sags against him and Sherlock wraps his arms around him more firmly, unwilling to let him move away. He’s heavy, but his weight feels grounding and comforting.
They barely make it back to bed, kissing hungrily all the way from the kitchen. Sherlock’s gasping and moaning already, but despite his obvious arousal and impatience, he prepares John very thoroughly, his long fingers stretching him and opening him up with the utmost care.  He watches his fingers disappearing inside John like it’s the most fascinating thing he’s ever seen.
John nods, clearly understanding that avoidance won’t help. He looks at his tea a while longer and then sets the mug on the table when the hand holding it starts shaking.
“It’s not fine! How can you say that?”
“Your unrequited feelings for your flatmate.”
“Once again, louder.”
“Baka!” Rosie says happily, whatever it means.
Sherlock is asleep within minutes, puffing hot breath on John’s chest. John knows he should do something to clean them up a bit, but he really doesn’t want to move, and he figures that at this point it really doesn’t matter that they’re covered in dried sweat and come. He presses a kiss to the top of Sherlock’s head and finally lets himself relax and drift off, too.
“No, but I don’t think it’s our place to point that out, especially when he’s naked in our bed!”
Sherlock nods dumbly as he tries to catch his breath, his confusion mounting. First rage, then kissing and groping and now John’s going to cook?
to do something to please me.”
. He’s been here, all this time, lapping up Robert’s kindness and generosity, and he’s apparently repaid him by moaning another man’s name in the throes of passion. Repeatedly.
Taking a deep breath, he pressed on.
want it, or are you just trying to prove something to me?”
Sherlock always feels things so much more than John expects him to. How many times has John accidentally hurt him simply because he didn’t think Sherlock
John was sitting at the kitchen table, doing a crossword.
It’s a lovely kiss – slow and deep, not so obviously driven by nothing more than sexual need. Sherlock wishes they could do just this for the rest of the night, but that’s a ridiculous, sentimental notion. He lets the kiss calm his jangled nerves a little but tears himself away as soon as he can bring himself to. This is for John. He turns to lie on his front, placing a pillow under his hips, and spreads his legs. John’s for the taking.
Sherlock continues to think about his need for John’s touch even after John has left. It’s even stronger now than it used to. He’s wanted John’s touch for as long as he can remember, before he was even able to put a name to his feelings, but now it’s a visceral need: he wants John’s hands to heal the wounds John’s hands have inflicted.
Sherlock kept going, pulling at John’s cock relentlessly, noting how John liked a much firmer grip and faster strokes than Sherlock did. And then he knew John was about to come, his breathing sped up, his cock hardened even more in Sherlock’s hand and his hips started to actually lift off the bed and Sherlock sped up his movements, breathless with the need to give John an orgasm, and then suddenly it was there, John froze and groaned and his release spilled over Sherlock’s hand.
They break apart when they’re interrupted by an arriving group of tourists and they make their way back to the top station of the funicular, with frequent stops for more kissing. Every square inch of Sherlock’s skin seems to be screaming to be touched and he’s almost light-headed with it - he didn’t know he could feel this sort of hunger for someone he barely even knows. He doesn’t think about anything besides his sudden overwhelming need for closeness until they get back to Haus Talblick, when the reality of what they’re about to do once they sneak to his room hits him. His hands shake as he struggles to unlock his door.
“Or my mouth,” he added weakly. “I could try—“
“Hey, Scott, are you all right?” Patrick asks him as soon as Sherlock steps inside their unbearably domestic living room. He really must look awful, if they both immediately ask him how he is.
“Okay then.”
“I thought you and Irene…” he mumbles, and that, finally, gets him a proper reaction. Sherlock’s head shoots up, and the look he gives John shocks him with the steel in it.
He thinks about going to the window, but he succumbs to exhaustion and despair before he can muster enough energy to move.
John let his hand drop from Sherlock’s hair, and both of his hands found their way underneath Sherlock’s dressing gown, up and up his thighs until they reached his cotton-clad buttocks and pulled his hips forward, fingers splaying possessively.  Sherlock couldn’t help but moan into John’s mouth as he met the hard denim-covered bulge again and again and again as John guided his pelvis forward. And then John’s hips were moving too, thrusting up to meet Sherlock and send sparks of liquid desire through Sherlock’s body. They were rutting together like animals but it felt so good so good so good, Sherlock had to stop kissing John in order to breathe as his hips drove forward of their own accord now, faster and faster and—
Sherlock comes with a hoarse shout, followed a long, loud moan as John’s body moves on autopilot and fucks him through his orgasm, drawing it out until, finally, he stills.
“There’s nothing I’m more ashamed of than the I treated you after you came back. I was angry with you because it was easier than being angry with myself and I blamed you for things that were my fault.”
“Wait, not so fast,” John grabs his arm before Sherlock can move away. “Look at me. Are you clean?”
When the blinding intensity of his orgasm dissipates he finds himself in John’s arms, being held close, protected and loved.
. He checks that Sherlock has eaten and taken his medication and
Then John’s hand that isn’t maintaining a firm grip on Sherlock’s hair drops down between their bodies and cups Sherlock through the thin fabric of his pyjama bottoms, squeezing roughly just when John’s lips leave Sherlock’s mouth and attach themselves instead to the side of his neck, and Sherlock’s whimpering yelp has nothing to be muffled against. His whole body’s shuddering uncontrollably, it’s too much too fast and it’s wrong, it’s wrong, John’s not gay and he wants neither Sherlock’s love nor his body, so why is he palming Sherlock’s erection through flimsy cotton, here in the kitchen moments after telling him he didn’t know what love was? It makes no sense, it makes no sense, it’s wrong and John will hate himself
“What you two have,” Sherlock murmurs. “Yes.”
His mind palace was quiet and calm. Redbeard ran to him and licked his face and Sherlock’s heartbeat slowed as he took a deep, steady breath.
He lets things develop naturally. He gets closer to Rosie, the conversations with John grow longer and less stilted. He continues to see Ella regularly and he thinks it helps him feel a bit more grounded. He solves a few cases. He eventually decides to take Sam and Patrick up on their offer and spends another night with them, and then another, and another. He’s intrigued by their dynamic and since it’s clear he can’t have anything like that himself now (or perhaps ever, but he prefers not to think about that), observing their relationship seems like the next best thing. He still doesn’t really understand why they like having a third person there – he’s certain he wouldn’t want to share in their position – but he’s glad that they do. Seeing their love and trust for each other up close somehow makes Sherlock feel better about the world, gives him hope for he’s not sure what. They never get quite as rough with each other as they did the first night (Sherlock thinks he probably made them a bit uncomfortable with his questions) but there are still clear traces of that dynamic of their interaction – the way Sam sometimes manhandles Patrick who turns into putty in his hands, the way Patrick scrambles to obey when Sam tells him to do something in a particular tone of voice, the way everything Sam does seems to be driven by the need to make sure Patrick’s enjoying himself. Sherlock wonders what they’re like when they’re alone together and yearns to have something like that for himself one day.
Sherlock felt like he should object to being called adorable, but couldn’t really muster enough determination to say anything, not with John looking at him like that.
“Afraid of vampires, are you?” John asks, trying for a light-hearted tone and failing miserably.
“Sherlock, look at me.”
be ready for that. He can’t imagine John in the same room with anyone Sherlock has slept with, but he’s happy that Patrick and Sam want to stay in touch.
“That makes sense,” John said thoughtfully. “I should’ve thought of that, you’re—such a private person. But, look.” John set his own cup down and reached for Sherlock’s hand instead, squeezing it. “If you’re embarrassed about what you look like, or how you sound or whatever – chances are it’s probably incredibly hot to me. So try thinking about that? And even if it isn’t hot, no one will ever know but me, and I won’t… laugh at you, if that’s what you’re worried about. Maybe it’ll be funny and then we’ll
“Can I… Can I hug you?” John asks, his thumb still stroking over Sherlock’s cheekbone. “I’d like to hug you.”
Hearing John say his name is all it takes: Sherlock’s pleasure peaks in one sharp spike, and the world explodes behind his eyes as he spills over their hands, his head thrown back in a shout that never manages to leave his lungs.
“Yes, John,” Sherlock said, lifting his head from John’s chest to look up at him. It felt like a huge weight had lifted from his chest: he’d laid himself bare for John, and John had accepted him.
“Oh no. Rather the opposite. But she’s always been good at telling what people like, seemed safer to ask her rather than make my own judgement. It’s not really my area.”
John breath in sharply, and Sherlock can tell, even just by the rhythm of his breathing, that he was hoping they would never address that. Well, too bad. Sherlock doesn’t want to talk about it either, but he needs to know. In his peripheral vision he sees John’s fist clench, his weight shift from one leg to the other.
he confronts John about this, because he’s going to, he’s entitled to the truth – what does he want John’s reaction to be?
“Sherlock,” John exhales when they break apart, barely a whisper. His eyes are huge and sad. “You can’t seriously still want this.”
. It’s not a thing John would say lightly – but it can’t be true, how could it be true? He can almost feel his brain grind to a halt at the cognitive dissonance of it.
, overall. And if this is what Sherlock voicing his feelings has led to, then he can’t regret it, even if he doesn’t really understand John’s reasoning behind it. The initial awkwardness has dissipated and things are better now than they used to be.
John’s eyes close for a brief second, but when he opens them his gaze is unflinching. The mix of pain and determination in his face reminds Sherlock of the terrible night when Magnussen flicked his face, and John approaches this with the same kind of determination
“Please, John. Just go. Please.”
There was something about John’s tone of voice that made Sherlock lift his gaze to John’s face immediately. John’s pupils were blown wide and his face was flushed and the way he was looking at Sherlock was heart-stopping.
“Sit down; you’re shaking.” It was true, Sherlock noticed as John said it: his body was wracked with tremors.
“It might feel a bit uncomfortable at first,” John said as he stroked Sherlock’s hip with one hand and the fingers of the other slipped between Sherlock’s arse cheeks, coated in cool lubricant, “but I promise I won’t hurt you. Just try to relax for me.”
Sherlock nearly trips over his own feet on before he manages to sit down in front of the mirror. Here’s a man who finds him attractive – it shakes Sherlock to the core. He’s aware he’s attractive to some people, of course, and he has used the fact to his advantage numerous times. But this is the first time he’s detected admiration in someone’s eyes at a time when could be receptive to the attention, and he’s been feeling so awful lately that just the thought he’s somehow managed to elicit any sort of positive feeling in someone is like a balm. And while he knows how to flirt for a case, to extract information, to obtain a favour, he finds he has no idea how two strangers who like the look of each other might actually progress from there. He sits down in the chair, his pulse hammering.
“John… it’s okay. It’s forgiven. It was a difficult time, you weren’t yourself. I understood.”
It’s all right. They have a dog and a toddler there who are enough of a distraction. They talk mostly to Rosie and Jack rather than to each other and they always maintain respectable distance from each other. They are both careful and wary and polite, John especially so, as if he expected Sherlock to storm off at any moment. But they are there, together.
“Fine,” Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Poison.”
him to stay the night and then run into his flatmate in the morning. To show the flatmate that Terry has a sex life too, to try and make him jealous, or perhaps just to make Terry feel better.
“What are you doing?” John asks, apparently utterly incredulous.
“Ah,” John says, like he’s been expecting Sherlock to bring it up at some point, and he looks down at his cup of tea.
“I’ve been meaning to go see the Falls,” Sherlock says. He hesitates slightly, then gathers his courage. “I could use a guide.”
John come within him, twitching and spurting, and it sends new wave of pleasure through him, drawing his climax out as he screams himself hoarse and his cock gushes in John’s hand, again and again and again.
, but he’s had a lovely, intimate experience with someone who’s only been gentle and kind with him even though there’s nothing but superficial physical attraction between them. But
“You didn’t want to embarrass me?” Sherlock suggests, feeling suddenly rather wrong-footed.
“You don’t have to keep apologising, I get that you didn’t mean to do that. But I need to know when things aren’t okay for you. I’d much rather stop than have you panicking.”
He remembers the nondescript name, Haus Talblick, and he googles it on his phone standing up in the bathroom, unwilling to try sitting down with his laptop. They offer “healing retreats” with addiction counselling, which sounds like precisely the kind of thing he needs. Healing. Checking the map, he notices that the place is located quite close to the Reichenbach Falls, and if he were a person to believe that sort of thing, he’d think it’s a sign that it’s where he’s meant to go. He dials the number on the website before he can change his mind. It’s late and even later in Switzerland, but the receptionist doesn’t seem to mind, confirming that they have rooms available and obligingly booking their six-week programme for Sherlock (or rather, Scott Siegerson, which is the name he gives) starting tomorrow. He isn’t sure he’ll want to stay that long, but right now, he wants to be as far as possible for as long as possible. His stay arranged, he books the earliest available flight out of London, tomorrow at 6 a.m.
“There you are, beautiful,” John smiled at him as if Sherlock wasn’t being completely irrational, and kissed his lips. “You okay?”
“Yes,” Sherlock breathes, and then his tongue moves of its own accord and this time he doesn’t manage to stop it in time: “Thank you.” He cringes immediately and closes his eyes to avoid seeing Robert’s reaction, because what a stupid thing to say at this moment, no matter how much he means it.
“All right?” John asks quietly, still out of breath, as he moves his hand to Sherlock’s hair again. “What would you--?”
the intrusion.
John stilled but made sure to keep some distance between his groin and Sherlock’s arse, so Sherlock pushed back determinedly.
just because John… got a little angry with him? He got a bit hurt so now he needs a holiday? Preposterous.
He drops his phone immediately after sending the text as if it could explode at any moment. There. He’s done it. It was up to him to extend an invitation – he knows very well that John would never try to force himself back into Sherlock’s life, Sherlock had to ask him to. And he thinks he might be ready now – for

. She’s John’s friend, too. Maybe she has a right to know. And maybe… Sherlock has a right not to have to do this alone.
“Not necessarily, but it would be preferable.” Best if he doesn’t have time to panic.
“What would work for you, darling?” John asked. “Could you maybe… touch yourself? Show me how you like it? Would that be okay?”

“Of course I do. You’re sorry but you’re not gay, only ever thought of me as a friend, blah blah blah. Trust me,
“I’ll give you what you need soon,” John promises. “You’re gorgeous, you know? I can’t wait to be inside you. But get yourself nice and ready first. Go on.”
Irene shakes her head with conviction.. “He was. It was obvious.”
Sherlock
The intensity of the feeling surprises him – to what extent he still wants to be there for John, help him, do everything in his power to make John’s life easier, better. Is that wrong? Should he not feel like that anymore? He trusts himself to put an end to things if necessary, he won’t let himself be mistreated anymore, but he still wants John’s happiness more than anything. He still wants John to touch him – with kindness. With love.
“I’d rather not talk about it,” he says eventually. “Sorry.”
“John,” Sherlock moans softly and then throws his head back when he finally finds the right angle and begins rocking with more purpose. “
The sheer

being happy again. But Dr Schneider tells him happiness doesn’t have to be a grand thing or a permanent state of being and encourages him to look for small things that bring him joy, however fleeting, and then to try incorporating them into his life as much as possible. It sounds a bit trite, but Sherlock is, frankly, tired of being miserable, and so he tries. After his therapy sessions, between yoga classes and aromatherapy and massages and art therapy and horse riding and country walks and boxing in the underground gym, he looks for little things that make him happy.
“Here you go.” John handed him a mug of tea and sat down next to him. He was fully dressed but he looked careworn, and Sherlock hated that he’d done this to him – caused so much unnecessary trouble.
John closes the door and turns off the overhead light, leaving only the bedside lamp on. He likes to see Sherlock, but Sherlock prefers the lighting to be more intimate, and isn’t going to deny him this. He sets the bottle and flannel on the bedside table, never taking his eyes off Sherlock, making his desire obvious.
“Stop now,” John tells him, and Sherlock does, even if a disappointed sound escapes him as his fingers leave him. “You’ve done so well. You’re ready now, aren’t you? Ready for me to fuck you?”
“A bit,” Sherlock admitted.
“No, no, love.” John reaches for him, lifting Sherlock’s head gently and looking into his eyes. “I am
. Sherlock’s hips stuttered forward, his own modest erection meeting John’s impressive one, and he yelped.
“Hmm?”
The intensity of their eye contact makes him feel rather awkward, and after a few more seconds he has to clear his throat and look away, occupy himself with wiping Rosie’s mouth. He feels lighter than he has in weeks.
“I just want to finish reading this article,” John lies. “You keep touching yourself, I know how much you need it.”
John slowly crosses the room to the chair opposite Sherlock’s, the chair Sherlock keeps trying and failing not to think of as
, but that’s just a question of terminology). He’s a self-hating, lonely man with no concept of self-worth who’s so desperate for any scraps of attention from the man he loves and is pathologically dependent on that he lets himself be abused.
John said nothing. It was probably a stupid idea. John had seemed to like it when Sherlock stroked him yesterday, but what could Sherlock’s inexperienced hands offer that John couldn’t do better himself?
how he expected today to go. They were just supposed to work on a case.
“I don’t find it easy to say these things,” John continues, stepping closer to Sherlock. “But I should have told you at the start. I love you. I thought you must have… deduced that.”
No, no. Don’t think about that. Don’t think about John. He’s with Terry now. Terry, who’s obviously loving this, bouncing on Sherlock’s cock with his head thrown back, his chest flushed and his hard, swollen cock leaking pearly fluid, wholly unashamed in his pleasure.
Robert looks at him for a long moment, then he seems to make up his mind. He removes his hand from Sherlock’s hair and says, “Who’s John?”
“Sherlock.”
“All right?” Robert asks when he’s an inch in or halfway in or fully in – it’s impossible to judge.
Robert nods, bites his lip. “I just want you to know that… if anything. Happened. I’ll come and punch him in the face.”
, watching Sherlock’s reactions to his voice: his flush deepens, his pupils blow wide, his breathing grows fast and audible.
“No,” Sherlock said. He didn’t have any strength to move, and he certainly wasn’t letting John go anywhere.
John nods, more to himself than to Sherlock, and looks up again.
“What about me touching you?” John asked. “Is that okay, or would it be overwhelming?”
“Okay, now getting back to what matters here,
Sherlock freezes in shock, his brain grinding to a halt. John is kissing him. Kissing him, not hitting him. How did that happen? The kiss is none too gentle, lips and teeth clashing together, one of John’s hands keeps a firm grip on the front of Sherlock’s shirt and the other finds its way to Sherlock’s hair, grabbing a fistful and pulling his head to the required angle. Sherlock gasps and John uses that opportunity to plunge his tongue deep inside Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock tries to kiss back as best as he can but he’s almost light-headed with shock at this turn of events, and the forcefulness and insistence of John’s lips and hands and tongue make it difficult for him to do anything, he can barely catch a breath. Then John presses closer, inserting his knee between Sherlock’s legs and his groin comes in contact with Sherlock’s hip and oh god, oh god, he’s hard. John is hard.
He relaxes more fully against the pillows. He’ll have to get up soon and go home to Jack, but there’s still time to enjoy the afterglow and the company. “You know, I might take you up on that offer.”
Except not really, he knows from experience how these places drive him crazy with their strict regimes and rules and inane mantras and group sessions, he couldn’t bear it, he’d be bound to shoot up simply out of sheer frustration. But something more low-key, something that could help him stay clean and where he could somehow put himself together, because right now he feels like he’s falling apart at the seams. Somewhere far from everything.
“Greg? Why?”
Anger bubbles up inside Sherlock: he’s not a
“You?” John says, not understanding, and then it dawns on him. The only explication: the man must have been a therapist. Had Sherlock been feeling so bad he decided he needed a new therapist and John didn’t notice? Oh god.
John chose this particular way remains unanswered, and it’s not one Dr Schneider can help him solve because she doesn’t know John. She can only make the assumption that Sherlock would make in different circumstances, the same deduction he made when one of his Serbian captors threatened to rape him (and fortunately never got the chance): repressed homosexual leanings that can only be expressed when they can be framed as an act of violence. But that interpretation makes no sense with respect to John. His constant protestations of heterosexuality could perhaps be taken as a sign of self-denial, but John has never shown any signs of being attracted to men and definitely not to Sherlock. This explanation simply cannot be true. But then, the only remaining possibility is that John chose to do what he did because he knew it would hurt Sherlock the most and thus be a more effective punishment than a beating. That thought seems excessively cruel, and Sherlock desperately hopes there’s another explanation he hasn’t thought of.
—didn’t need to orgasm more than two or three times.”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock blurts, unable to bear it any longer.
He has no idea what to do with the knowledge that apparently John didn’t love Mary as much as Sherlock thought he did. Sherlock liked Mary, truly, and considered her his friend in her own right (even though, in hindsight, he thinks that a friend probably shouldn’t have shot him in the chest), but he’s well aware that most of his appreciation came from the fact that he believed that she made John happy, that she was what John wanted. And now it turns out that none of that was true.
“I mean – it’s completely fine with me if you want to wait, for whatever reason,” Sherlock hastens to add. “But I just wanted to ask if there’s anything about me you find… unappealing, or if there’s something I can do, or should do. I’d do anything you need me to.”
Sherlock felt himself turn crimson, and he couldn’t look at John for the life of him. “It’s… I… I feel like… I shouldn’t be seen like that,” he got out with difficulty, and he had to put his tea on the coffee table to avoid spilling it in his shaking hands.
“Scott, stop panicking. It’s fine.”
John says nothing, perhaps surmising that Sherlock came without direct stimulation again, or perhaps just grateful that he doesn’t have to touch him. He keeps stroking Sherlock’s hair, though, and Sherlock is so out of sorts that he takes the liberty of leaning into the touch a little, and then pressing a kiss to the inside of John’s wrist.
“I like to be close to you. Whatever we do, I think I’d prefer to be face to face. And… touch you. I want to be able to touch you everywhere.” He felt his cheeks redden and he turned his head to hide his face against John’s chest.
John shakes his head, uncompromising. “Eat, you need your strength. I don’t want you to pass out while you’re fucking me.”
“I’m always brilliant,” Sherlock counters as John mouths at his neck, but his voiced is filled with desire instead of the usual hauteur.
It’s unexpected, but Sherlock’s happy to go along with it. He’s ready to do anything to make up for his failure – until John’s hand moves between Sherlock’s legs and squeezes.
“Spread your legs,” John instructs him, almost light-headed from the effect his ministrations are having on Sherlock. “Like that, that’s enough. Now lift.”
That’s all he does, though – looking. He could approach them, flirt, find out if the first stir of attraction could lead anywhere, but he doesn’t want to. He doesn’t need to. He’s been having semi-regular sex since shortly after he arrived to the village, and he feels no need to search for other partners.
Sherlock blinks. Out of all the things John could have said, Sherlock really didn’t expect this. “Hurt me?” he repeats stupidly.
Sherlock lifts a hand to the back of his head, touching his short hair self-consciously. He had Florian cut it short and dye it a rich auburn before he left Switzerland. People don’t
“You’ve made it clear on numerous occasions that you aren’t interested in men generally and me particularly,” he points out, trying to find a semblance of sense.
“I won’t,” John promises, tightening his arms around him. “Go to sleep, love, hmm? I’ll be right here and never let you go.”
“You clearly
“I’m afraid so,” Sherlock says in his mortification and disengages from John’s embrace. “Excuse me.”
“John,” he says and he hates the eager, needy undertone that slips into his voice. “I wasn’t expecting you.”
Once they stood up, John straightened Sherlock’s dressing gown, tightening it around his waist. Sherlock felt foolish, essentially getting dressed by John, but also…
Sherlock wishes the ground would swallow him. “Sorry. I’m fine. I’ll just go.”
Sherlock opens his kiss-swollen mouth and says the words like he never thought he would – not a painful admission of secret, hidden feelings but an easy, joyful offering that’s accepted and wanted: “I love you.”
Sherlock looked at himself in the mirror, trying to calm his nerves. He was almost forty, for god’s sake, he thought impatiently, but of course, that was part of the problem: he was almost forty and he was about to have the first sexual experience of his life.
Sherlock had never allowed himself to imagine what kissing John might be like, but if he had he most probably wouldn’t have imagined it like this – wet and salty but perfect anyway, soft and gentle and reverent, one kiss blending into the next, separating only to meet again, chaste pecks turning into slick slides of tongue against tongue and then gentling again in a glorious cycle, over and over until Sherlock’s lips tingle and he’s smiling into the kisses, until he’s smiling so wide he can’t kiss anymore.
, don’t—
“No,” Sherlock says immediately, and perhaps with a bit too much firmness. One thing he’s certain about is that he doesn’t want to have his back to Robert. His scars are not much of a turn on, for one. Robert has seen them, of course, Sherlock could hardly have kept them hidden for so long, but that doesn’t mean he particularly likes him looking at them. And aside from that… having his partner behind him would probably be a bit too much for the first time.
” he begs, and John doesn’t waste any more time. He adds some more lube on his hand and then plunges two fingers in at once, knowing Sherlock can take it.
“Yes, we’d have to ask your Daddy if he agrees. But I’m sure he’d say yes because he loves you very much and he knows you’re a very smart young lady. Then we could do experiments together, wouldn’t that be fun?”
, and he just wants it all to stop, he wants to forget, at least for a moment, make it all just a little bit more bearable. He’ll text Wiggins and…
“Did you use toys?” he asks, stopping all movement.
Sherlock nods. This may not be the best moment, perhaps, but he needs to be honest. “Indeed.”
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed, finally looking up at John, grateful that John had found such a neat way to phrase it.
“You feel so good,” he murmurs, and takes Sherlock’s left nipple into his mouth
He pads back to the kitchen to get another glass of water for John and then returns to the bedroom, impatient to get back to bed.
And then one afternoon they’re kissing enthusiastically on the sofa with Sherlock lying on top of John, and they have gone as far as removing each other’s shirts. Sherlock is enjoying kissing John’s neck while John’s hands roam his back and his level of arousal is significant but not uncomfortably high, which is why it comes as a surprise when John moves his hands to Sherlock’s buttocks and
John straightens, clears his throat. “Hey.”
Sherlock thought with even more intensity, and reached to the bedside table for a condom.
“I’m going to fuck your mouth now, you perfect creature, ” John grunts, and Sherlock’s vision whitens with arousal as John’s hips start moving. He moans around John’s cock, and John’s thrusts turn harder, his cock sliding across Sherlock’s tongue and hard palate with force, but never going deeper than Sherlock had initially taken him. Sherlock’s body is aglow with bottomless devotion, he feels like there is warm honey flowing through his veins, dulling the intensity of his arousal so that he can focus on this, on the perfect slide of John’s cock in his mouth, on the noises John is making, on being nothing more than the source of John’s pleasure.
He feels his cheeks heat and he looks away from Terry’s face in embarrassment, but not before he sees a brief flash of disappointment flicker over his features.
His steps falter on the top of the stairs when he realises he hears music coming from the flat, something light and poppy that doesn’t sound like Sherlock’s taste at all. He knocks, feeling he’s lost any right he may have had to just barge in, but when he gets no reply he opens the door and follows the sound of the music to the kitchen, even though he’d rather never set his foot there as long as he lives.
It’s less than ten minutes before he hears John’s hesitant steps, and then John’s standing in the doorway, looking at Sherlock with an intensity that makes it hard to breathe.
“Could you do that?” John whispered to his ear. “Rub yourself against me, make yourself feel good?” Sherlock felt himself blush at John’s words, but he was too desperate for release to care. Hesitantly, he lowered his hips again, letting his leaking cock smear pre-ejaculate on John’s thigh.
“Is there someone?” Sherlock asks, pleased how in control he sounds.
He walks the rest of the way to his hotel with significantly more spring in his step. Once he gets to his room he draws a hot bath and orders room service (hot chips and a cheesecake) – if he has no one to hold him, he’s going to make the most of other sources of comfort. When he gets in bed he very consciously doesn’t pretend that the duvet is someone’s arms holding him close, and instead he thinks about the things he has planned for the near future: the sex toys, a little cottage in the Cotswolds near an animal rescue centre where he hopes to volunteer, a new composition he’d like to start working on. And other things he hasn’t discovered yet. He snuggles deeper into the covers and lets himself feel a little bit hopeful.
, he forced himself to think the words—Sherlock wasn’t going to ruin it for John by his misgivings or off-putting noises or by coming far too early in the proceedings in a totally inappropriate manner.
It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but the stretch and discomfort is sudden and significant enough to make Sherlock gasp, even though he meant to stay quiet. John lets out a grunt at the exact same moment, though, so hopefully he doesn’t notice. Logically, Sherlock knows that John can’t be very deep inside him yet, but he already feels so
“Do you imagine it’s my hand on you? Do you finger yourself, wish it was my cock?”
“And what do you use it for? Tell me. To stroke yourself?”
He wants it now more than he ever has in the past, because now it seems possible, almost within reach. Maybe it’s not so outlandish after all, maybe he could have it now, be John’s partner, lover, boyfriend, husband. The person John wants to share his life with.
It never ended like that in Sherlock’s treacherous fantasies – there were sleepy kisses, and warm bodies close together, and soft whispered words. Not this.
John notices the extra tube of lubricant Sherlock had placed on the bedside table in case his preparations in the bathroom weren’t enough, and uses it to slick himself, and then he’s stroking Sherlock’s sides soothingly and positioning himself between Sherlock’s legs and Sherlock can feel the blunt tip of John’s cock against his entrance and he must relax and
Sherlock begs and then shouts in relief when the plug slips all the way in. Immediately, he shifts, sitting on the plug so that it presses more firmly against his prostate, and begins rocking slightly.
He stopped and stood in the middle of the living room, breathing heavily. Sherlock was too shocked by the outburst to do anything but stare.
He goes home.
Sherlock jerks his head back fast enough to nearly give himself whiplash, a sudden flood of panic rising in his chest.
of miscommunication and pain, when we’ve finally reached a point where we’re both able to admit what we feel for each other, we should finally just try to be happy? I think we’ve earned the right.”
“Harder,” John tells, not because
He’s lying in bed with his head on Robert’s broad chest, heavy with the kind of sated exhaustion he’s come to associate with a particularly good shag. He’d definitely going to feel his thighs tomorrow after the workout they got as he rode Robert hard and fast, his body sinking down on Robert’s length with practiced ease now. Robert’s playing idly with his hair, which Sherlock loves, and he’s happy to just lie there for now, lulled by endorphins and lassitude. It takes him an embarrassingly long time to realise that something’s not quite right: Robert should have long nodded off by now, especially after such a vigorous performance. Sherlock looks at him and finds him staring into the middle distance, a frown creasing his brow.
John keeps shaking Sherlock’s body as he shouts, his face inches from Sherlock’s, and Sherlock lets him. John’s words hurt worse than anything physical John could inflict on him, but John’s right. What right does Sherlock have to profess his love for John after what he did to him? He deserves John’s anger, his disgust, his hatred. That’s all he’s ever deserved. He lets his body go lax, waiting for the first punch to land. A broken nose is inevitable, he thinks. A split lip, a fractured rib, perhaps. It doesn’t matter.
“That’s what I thought, too. I don’t know. She seems nice enough, though.”
“Hey,” Florian says softly when Sherlock drops his key card. “I don’t have to go in if you don’t want me to. I had a great time today, but it’s fine if you don’t want anything more.”
