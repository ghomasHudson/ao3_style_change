Hill crossed her arms, “You agree to help and we’ll give you the full briefing. But you make that choice now--and if it’s a no you’re under arrest.”
Right after the divorce, Peter refused to leave Steve’s side, loud noises terrified him, and he had nightmares nearly every night. It took him a half a year to even fully open up to Sam. Luckily, the other helped a lot and Peter started to ask if he could sleep with both Sam and Papa (which was how the two of them began sharing a bed). After another year, Peter was still shy around new adults, but all sense of fear and trauma seemed to be gone.
People use Tony Stark. They treat him terribly and use his body and his mind when they need it and kick him to the curb when he finally gets to be too much for them to handle, but people don’t turn down Tony Stark.
He was a fucking idiot for tossing that baggie. And all for what--because he wanted to feel like he was in control? Because he wanted to prove to The Captain that he wasn’t some sort of drug-dependent loser? Fuck The Captain. All of Tony’s misery seemed to be coming back to The Captain.
He very nearly dropped the phone as Sam shot to his feet next to him. “Nice save, Pete! Do the spidey kick!”
The coke worked wonders on his busy mind. It gave him tunnel vision of sorts, at least for information. It let him focus on just one thing, working as fast as his mind seemed to go, and he got shit done. So what if he was destroying his body? He always had a feeling he was gonna die young anyway. He might as well get some shit done in the meantime.
Tony felt alone in the club. He could feel Fandral: the heat of his body, the press of his outlined muscles against him, his hands moving from his hips lower and lower, his cock hard and wanting against his ass, but Tony felt disconnected from it all. The music took control of his body, making him sway his hips and grind back with the beat. He could hear the bass in the middle of his throat, but he couldn’t find the words.
Steve glanced down at his phone from where he sat in the stands at Peter’s game. He had to do a double take at the message. Two days later and he was finally hearing from Tony? His eyes were glued to the notification, the teasing pulse of “slide to unlock”.
Thor spoke before Tony could fuck up the situation any more, “Captain! I didn’t know you were coming in tonight, we were just having a little fun, that’s all.”
“I can be yours,” Tony tempted, his breath hitching as the Captain flicked his thumb over his slit, sending a shiver down his spine.
Tony’s eyebrow pulled together in frustration and confusion. However, Thor was quick to appear and explain, “You’ve been blacklisted, little one,” He informed the man. “Captain’s orders. You’re not getting any Valhalla any time soon.”
“Hey--stop, fuck off--” Tony started to complain but the heavyweight of the blanket around him felt like a huge wall of protection and helped him calm even more. He shuts his mouth, looking down at the end of the bed and pointedly not at The Captain. After what felt like a lifetime (but was probably only 5 minutes), Tony spoke again. “I know you’re not real.”
Aside from a few drunken calls from Tony (Tony only ever had the nerve to call when he was drunk), Steve was happy. Sam made him happy, and Peter loved him… and Steve wanted to.
The door slammed open, and Detective hill was standing there, one hand on her hip, close to her gun, and the other holding a file in a clenched fist. “Up,” She ordered, “Hands above your head, step away from the desk.”
The Captain, Tony suddenly realized, turned his piercing gaze from to Fandral and Thor as his frown deepened. “Who the fuck is that.”
Tony looked down, feigning a blush as he pulled on his pants. What the fuck was he getting himself into? “Yeah, sure, you got my number?”
Steve’s vision blurred against his will but he had already packed enough clothes for a few days. The blond went to the bed, picking Peter up and resting the little one on his hip.
Tony licked his lips, squirming on his lap and resting his hands on his chest. Jesus he was jacked! He could probably fuck Tony while holding him, absolutely destroy him without breaking a sweat…
Anger flared behind his eyes but he didn’t break his disinterested composure.“You ask a lot of questions.”
Tony found himself pressed up against the bathroom stall door with Fandral kissing his neck. There was a hard leg between his own, and Tony only realized then that he was also interested. He took the time to grind against it, moaning and dropping his head to the side.
“Now now, Firebird,” Fandral sighed, stepping back and putting space between the two of them. “Trust me, I would love to. But I think you’ll have to talk to the boss.”
When the adoption papers went through, Steve had never looked happier, not even after Tony proposed. They moved out of little apartment in the city, bought a cute house in the burbs with a big yard and baby proof everything, and Tony swore he was happy! He wanted to be, at least. Steve was so happy, he couldn’t just tell him he’d changed his mind.
“Firebird, you’re such a good sight to see, it’s been a long day…” Tony smirked at the praise, and felt his body flush as Fandral groped his ass openly.
Steve knew he would start asking about Tony again, it was bound to happen and two years seemed like plenty of time to get curious. Yet somehow, Steve had figured it would happen much much later--after things were magically fixed.
He shivered and licked his lips, staring up at him with big eyes, “Yes,” he croaked, “I love big cock.” Okay, a little cheesey but if it got what he wanted he was fine with it. Before Thor could make him say anything else he busied himself, taking the head into his mouth and moaning around it. He wrapped his hands around the base since there was no way he was going to be able to take that all down his throat. Above him Thor groaned.
He looked up and he saw that stone-cold expression remained. There was a flicker of emotion behind his eyes but it felt impossible to pin down. Understanding? Irritation? Dare he say… remorse?
The divorce had been the worst month of Steve’s life. Tony begged him to stay, and God did he want to. But he couldn’t; a drunken Tony was a danger to his son and Steve wouldn’t force Peter into a childhood just like his own. Tony said he would sober up, and Steve almost believed him, but getting sober was a process, one that he wouldn’t make Peter be around for.
Tony looked down at the phone, still able to hear the yelling from his hand and hung up on the caller without much else. Obviously the message wasn’t for him… but in that case, where the hell was Fandral?
Steve tensed just a bit, taking the moment to press his face into the other’s neck before speaking again. “We made pancakes,” He listed, “and went to the park, and listened to Harry Potter on tape, and, uh…” He paused, “And Peter asked if Tony could come to his piano recital…”
Steve let the two of them take their time. It was nice just to see Tony sober. While it stung that he himself wasn’t a good enough reason, he was proud to see Peter was. Finally the two let go, and Peter took his hand once more. “Come on, Little Bug, let’s get you in the car…”
“Hey, big guy!” Tony smiled down at his son, ruffling his hair (the hair he and Sam took an hour to comb, damn it!), “You look great!”
“I hope you know I’m not going to call you Firebird,” He greeted Tony with an eye roll, “Just come in.”
“Tony,” Peter gave him a firm look. He seemed a lot older, out of his police uniform and in normal clothing. “You’re a civilian, you’ve been hurt. We need to take you to the hospital.”
Okay. I really thought that this story was in my fic graveyard. I reached a total dead end with writer's block and I had basically written banished this off to my hiatus folder. But every now and then I would get those little kudos emails and I recently went back and read the comments and it sounds cheesy but I remembered why I started writing this fic. So buckle up, we're riding this bitch out to the end.
A new routine started. Tony went into the city and Steve stayed home with the baby. Tony’s little drinks turned into big ones. Buzzed became plastered. Day trips turned into weekends.
Tony wrinkled his nose, “Okay, well, I’m glad you’re taking this whole ‘keeping tabs on Tony’ thing seriously... but I went out. I had a stressful day. Is that so bad?”
They continued like that for a while, and more and more often, Steve pretended it wasn’t happening. He desperately tried not to notice how Peter got quieter and ran to Steve far more often than he ran to Tony. He knew they were barely holding everything together and their balancing act wouldn’t last forever.
Just when he thought he was finally asleep once more, Tony shot straight up with a desperate, gulping, breath for air. Something was wrong. Something was wrong with him, his heart felt like it was beating out of his chest and he could see the blood pumping in his veins. His skin looked like it was crawling and when he slapped at his bare arms he couldn’t get it to go away.
Steve didn’t know how to invite Tony. Sure, he knew how to contact him, but how? Asking him in person was 100% out of the question; Steve didn’t trust himself. He would get all choked up and forget how to talk and say something stupid that he would regret. Calling him didn’t seem like a good idea, either. It would be easier than seeing him in person, sure, but he would still get flustered and say the wrong thing.
Peter stopped, wide eyed and suddenly bashful, right in front of Steve’s plush armchair. “You, you know I, uh, I have my, um, my piano recital Sunday?” He mumbled.
“Tony, hey come on, where are you going?” Peter spoke in his ear, but Tony just reached up, yanked it out and tossed it on the ground. Fuck if he was going to listen to some stupid cops right now telling him about everything he did wrong. He fucked up and he knew it, he didn’t need to see Hill’s stupid fucking face when she told him.
“Can we go get ice cream?!” He bounced as he walked. Steve and Sam could have predicted it; ice cream was Peter’s favorite way to celebrate.
With a little more courage inside of him, Tony spotted the roped off VIP section towards the back of the bar. Well, if there was anywhere he belonged it was going to be there. He marched his way over, giving the bouncer a smirk and reporting that he was here for Fandral. Before he had to think of anymore questions a voice was calling out to him,
“Stop trying to cover your ass, Parker, I’m fine,” He rolled his eyes and turned to start walking, but Peter yanked him around again. Fuck, he actually did have a pretty shitty head wound and all this yanking was making his head pound even more. “Knock it off, Parker!” He snapped, “I said leave me alone!”
“Fuck it…” Tony hissed, ripping open the baggie and using his arm to make a line. The moment the drugs hit his system again he felt like he could breathe once more. His eyes went out of focus as he stared up at the ceiling. Quiet. Finally.
“Uh, you know I have constitutional rights. You can’t just randomly test me,” Tony rolled his eyes, staying the hell away from that cup.
There was a long pause, and Tony almost made it to the door before Hill spoke, “Oh, Tony… Is that what this is about?”
“Do you ever stop talking?” The Captain didn’t look at him while he spoke, just stared out the window to the forest outside. This seemed much more on-brand for the ruthless mob boss he’d experienced before. Whatever just happened there… was some sort of freak accident. No matter, lightning doesn’t strike twice.
“Thor Odinson. Thirty years old, and a citizen of both the United States and Norway. He does a lot of traveling between the two countries, smuggling money and his own notable strain of drugs called, ‘Valhalla’,” Parker read off to Tony, “He’s bringing in the drug, then switching to the much cheaper black tar once his customers are hooked. Now, we don’t want any heroin running around our city but this stuff is bad news. It’s really low quality and causes a lot of overdoses. Since he’s been in the area, we’ve seen a 40% spike in drug related deaths.”
The third time Tony came home drunk, Steve was furious. Tony had promised he was getting clean--that he was in AA! They fought, yelling as loud as they dared with Peter sleeping.
Loki looked over his shoulder as he stood in front of a little desk. “No sense of decorum, I see. Straight to the point. I guess that’s why that oaf likes you.” He turned around with a sigh, holding out a clear vial, filled with what looked like black liquid. “250.”
“Tony, get out of there,” Parker warned him in his ear again but he didn’t care, he felt like he was floating and the Captain’s hands were under his pants now, massaging and kneading at his ass.
Steve nodded, chewing his lip as he looked up at him. “Yeah… and I think he really wants him to be there.”
“Peter’s down,” Steve announced as he came back into the kitchen. As the nightmares became less common, they’d managed to get Peter sleeping in his own room again. Sam and Steve had continued their sleeping routine, though. He slipped behind Sam, circling his arms around his waist and resting his head on his shoulder. “And out bedtime isn’t for another three hours.”
Getting a shirt that didn’t look like it belonged to either a 13 year old or a 70 year old proved to be a little difficult. But after ten minutes of yanking shit from hangers and shoving them back into whatever nooks and crannies he could find, Tony found a plain green one that wasn’t horrible. He changed right there in the store, pulling out a ten and passing it to the woman on the counter.
“There, now that’s a good boy,” he praised softly. Tony swallowed, the words going straight to his dick. “What are you doing here, good boy?”
The blond man had his hair pulled back into a low bun and a wicked grin on his face. Tony shivered; he was huge.
“Now you want to draw a little attention to yourself as possible, Tony,” Peter reminded him for about the tenth time, “Seriously. Just keep your mouth shut and listen. These guys are pretty extreme and we’ll be around the block to pick you up if you get in a little trouble but you’re going into the lion’s den. You need to be safe.”
“Hey,” Sam slipped a hand around his waist, giving him a comforting squeeze, “breathe.” Steve did his best to follow his orders, but he couldn’t help glancing back at the door.
“You know,” The blond drawled, “we have some… recreational fun.” Once more, Tony fought the urge to roll his eyes. After five minutes with the dude he could tell he had drugs on him, and thirty minutes of alluding to it later, Tony was sick and tired of sober flirting.
“Tony, you don’t have to do that, seriously,” the voice in his ear warned and Tony wanted to laugh. Didn’t they know by now that he was a good for nothing junkie? Didn’t they put two and two together and realize he was a worthless slut? Yes. He did have to do this.
“Oh, Peter,” Steve scooped him up in his arms where the five year old curled into him, pressing his face into his neck.
“You threatening me, Parker?” He hissed, his eyes narrowing as he quickly lost control of the situation.
The first time Tony came home drunk, he had managed to stay conscious for a total of 60 seconds before passing out in his husband’s arms. Steve had been mortified. In fact, he’d been about to call 9-1-1 when he’d smelt the booze on his breath. He tucked Tony into bed and swore they would talk about it in the morning…. But then Peter got the sniffles and Steve had to rush him off to his doctor. By the time Steve joined Tony in bed that night, he was already asleep.
Pity. Tony recognized it at once and it made his stomach churn. “Look,” He spun back around, his eyes flaring and his head just wouldn’t stop
While he’d been able to put it off for three days by means of that little problem, he couldn’t any longer. Sunday was approaching and Steve would have to at least do good by Peter and ask.
“Maybe you should find out, then.” The Captain chuckled, and Tony tilted his head to the side for a moment.
“Where’s Daddy?” Peter asked, squirming in his seat to look around, his bright blue piano book held close to his chest.
“I don’t like liars,” The Captain spoke to him in a deadly low voice, “Now how fucking old are you?”
Was that a panic attack? He’d started to think that it was just something that special snowflakes on the internet threw around as an excuse but that suddenly seemed like a very likely answer. While he could breathe once more, he was still shaking and his cheeks were hit with the cold air in the room, feeling it even more now that they were tear-stained. How pathetic, crying his eyes out in front of a Captain that may or may not be real.
“I don’t want to talk right now, Baby Face,” He snapped at him. He didn’t look up to see the hurt flash across his face. He didn’t need to.
Steve squeezed him tight, hating to see his baby boy so upset. “I don’t know, baby,” He admitted. “I’ll invite him, okay? But he might be too sick to come, Little Bug.”
“Yeah, well you’ve created a rather confusing situation, Dickwad.” Tony watched as The Captain ground his teeth together. Interesting. He sure as hell didn’t seem like the type of person to hold back anything. What caused his change of heart? Distantly, Tony wondered if this was a trap.
Tony fought the urge to snap at her about it, knowing that his declining mood wasn’t her fault--god he felt itchy. “Yeah--I guess I am. Here, I’ll uh.. donate this one.” He tossed the old shirt over the counter, “I don’t really need it any more, uh, keep the change--” He was already walking out the store door as the woman tried to protest (and who could blame her, who wanted his booze infested shirt? No matter how cool it looked…), rushing down the street before she could stop him.
“Fuck!” Fandral slammed into him again, Tony’s head crashing into the wall behind him. “Fuck! Yes, hgnn, yes…”
Peter visibly deflated, “I-I was just--I wanted--” His lower lip began to tremble and he had to cut himself off.
Detective Hill paused, looking at the paperwork before her, then back at Tony. “We can search your person, your apartment. We can put you away for a long time, Tony. We just need some help.”
He was on the Brooklyn Bridge. He didn’t know how he got there. He remembered walking at some point, and kind of remembered falling down in the kitchen. He glanced at his arm, bleeding through his shirt. Shit, what had he done?
He wanted to continue but he but was left stuttering. His throat was raw and he couldn’t find words to express his pure rage and pain and panic and fear. All that escaped him were animalistic sobs as he once more humiliated himself in front of The Captain. Tony looked up to see the disgusted snarl and hear him once again called him pathetic but… it didn’t happen.
“People died, Tony…” Peter sighed, rubbing his eyes. “And if we can get something on the Captain from this, or any of the Howling Commandos we can put them away before it gets worse. So that’s what we need.”
“Come on, kid, get out of here. I’ll even let you leave in one piece if you just turn around and walk out right now. No need to make a scene.”
Tony apologized the next morning, and when Steve came back from the park with Peter, there were ten crystal vases on the table. Tony even made dinner! (Which was horrible-- they ditched the meal and ordered Thai food instead). Everything was going to be fine. It was a rough patch, that was all. Tony was just having trouble getting sober.
Peter continued to retell the game in vivid detail for the rest of dinner, Sam and Steve lingering on his every word. Once he calmed, Steve decided it was time to speak up.
’ in all of that. Peter must already know he was hooked. Did he see how much his hands were shaking? Did he know how scared Tony was that he wouldn’t be able to get another fix?
“Can Daddy come!?” Peter looked up at him with wide eyes; big, blue, and full of excitement Steve didn’t see as often as he wished. It broke his heart.
But that, it was proving, would be rather difficult. Since he got an apartment in New York, that stupid Detective Hill and her stupid partner Detective Fury almost never left him alone. They told him he had to be sober for the job and Tony told him that just wasn’t gonna fly. He couldn’t focus without the drugs. They wouldn’t get it, no one did. There was so much information in his mind, so many things flying around, that most of the time Tony couldn’t even grasp it.
“Stark,” Hill turned back to him, “You got an in with this guy? Think he would meet up with you again?”
A smirk pulled at the corner of Tony’s mouth and he crossed his arms over his chest. Okay. So he was putting this together a little faster than the cops. Well, not too out there considering he was a bit of a genius. “I want immunity,” He demanded, “I’ll work with you, I’ll tell you what I know and I’ll help you bring them in but I want immunity and I want to do this my way.”
“Not really,” He somehow managed to quip, “that’s kinda my shtick.” Tony even dared to sit up as he looked at The Captain’s back. He was an asshole… but damn if he wasn’t built. Tony glanced across the room, finally able to focus enough and see where he was.
“If this is who you are now--I don’t think I’d like to remember.” Steve spoke carefully. No, not Tony… God let this be a nightmare… Steve pursed his lips. “I’m taking Peter and we are staying at Sam’s tonight,” He told him as calmly as he could manage- before turning and running into his poor baby’s room.
“Mmhmm,” Thor nodded, “His name is Loki, he’s an associate of mine. It’s not as good as my mix, but it will help with those jitters.” He pointed at Tony’s hands, shaking at his sides. He flushed a deep red, shoving them into his pockets.
Fandral laughed, dragging him into the back lounge where Tony took a happy seat on his lap. There were about ten other men in the lounge, cigar smoke hanging heavy, and there was a girl with another man in the corner. She looked completely out of it, with glazed over eyes as she sat on his lap. He watched for a moment before he realized she was riding the other man and quickly squirmed around to pay attention to his own date. Right. Okay.
Steve looked up as Peter came puddling in, marking his page and putting his book aside. “What is it, Little Bug?”
“Get the fuck outta my club, you hear me?” The Captain leaned down over him now, and Tony felt completely cold. “Don’t come back, don’t talk to Fandral, don’t talk to Thor, and if I see you here again I’ll cut you fucking hand off, understood?”
Steve’s heart dropped. All this time he had been worried about what it would be like with Tony there--all the “what if’s”. He’d forgotten: What if Tony doesn’t show? It would break Peter’s heart, he was sure of it. What kid wouldn’t be devastated? Anger bubbled up and he clenched his jaw.
Tony swallowed. He never meant to get into the big stuff. Sure, cocaine wasn’t really minor league drugs, but heroin was… well that was bad shit. Still.. his high from the night before was amazing. The rush was instant, the power of it… and it wasn’t like he was shooting up, snorting heroin wasn’t as bad as shooting it. Not to mention, that Valhalla stuff actually seemed to make his brain shut the fuck up for a little bit… “Yeah,” He nodded, “Great stuff.”
“I’ll remind you that my sexuality is none of your business, Tony,” Parker told him, looking back at his own work.
The younger man pulled his arms closer around himself, breaking into a light jog to get away, but Peter was faster and yanked him around.
God, he already felt like shit, the last thing he needed was for this bitch to throw his head in a god damn blender.
Tony rolled his eyes, “Yeah, he was a dealer he had a big supply but clearly not the guy in charge if that’s what you’re asking.”
“I, uh, I wanted to have some fun,” he admitted, his eyes going right back to the Captain’s lips. They were a deep red, plum, and looked like they would be a lot of fun to kiss.
“Ask someone for a gin and tonic, yeah I know,” Tony assured him. He poked at the tiny device embedded in his ear, “You sure no one is going to see this?”
Tony shivered under his gaze. The Captain had frighteningly blue eyes, like a husky. It felt like he could see completely through him, and Tony quickly realized he was going to die here. “Nineteen,” He corrected himself in a soft voice.
“Hey,” He greeted back, but didn’t get a chance to say much else before Peter took notice of the new comer.
“I’ll text you later, okay?” Fandral pulled his shirt on, tossing Tony his own so that he could get dressed. “I’m running a little late to work--they were probably who was calling--but I’d love to take you out again tonight. You’re a real nice dancer, Firebird.”
Tony’s stomach dropped into his feet. Yeah right, like that was a good idea. He had taken a quick hit before he’d left Fandral’s, it was too tempting not to. He knew he would test positive for heroin and cocaine if he peed in this damn cup, but that was better than them finding out he had Valhalla stuffed into his pockets and a super secret flash drive hidden away in his lock box...right?
“I’m going to the bathroom,” He told Parker, ignoring his worried look as Tony left the room. Once he made it into the stall he pulled out a packet from Fandral, turning it over a few times in his hands. Why the hell did he even do this to himself?
for letting it all get to him. His life was a joke, he was a worthless piece of shit and no amount of drugs and stupid jokes could change that about him.
Tony froze, but so did Thor, who was still holding him down. He tried to turn around but was a little preoccupied with a cock down his throat. The man who spoke moved around, and Tony finally got a good look at him.
“I know some people,” Fandral shrugged, “They get some really quality stuff made, it’s a great mix, don’t you think?” Tony nodded. “H is a magical thing…”
“Firebird!” He greeted with a smile, “I didn’t think I would see you here--and so early in the night! What’s wrong?” His tone went from happy to a little irritated when he saw the state that Tony was in. He was pale, his eyes looked dead, and he couldn’t bring himself to even pretend to like the other man.
“Understood?” He snapped again. This time Tony nodded. The Captain rolled his eyes, turned on his heel, and stormed out. The teen brought his hand to his head, it was bloody, but nothing too bad. The silence was deafening, and Tony needed a fucking drink.
The minute Tony stepped into Brooklyn’s Finest he felt like he had been transported into another time. The whole place looked like a 1920s speakeasy; complete with heavy smoke, cloudy mirrors, scantily clad dancers, and an eerie red light around the entire bar. He walked up to the bar, checking himself out in the mirror and frowning. He looked way too fucking sober for this shit… He glanced to the left, watching a woman take the hand of a man from the bar. He slipped her a twenty and she pulled him away behind a curtain. Tony ordered a vodka.
!” He screamed, kept screaming, until his throat felt raw and he leaned heavily on the railing of the bridge. Fuck his life. Fuck his father. Fuck
“Okay, so the mic is in your necklace,” Peter informed Tony, “Make sure you don’t take it off, or this whole thing is pointless. Try not to tuck it into your shirt, either, so we can have clear audio.”
Steve was at Peter’s door in a flash, shoving his husband away. “Who are you?” He gawked, “I don’t know you anymore.”
Tony thought that maybe he was through the worst of it. He felt a little more in control of his body, and when he felt like he needed to run to the toilet, he at least was able to make it there in time--which was a hell of a step up from making a mess on the bed.
“Here, shh... “ Fandral kissed his neck, making Tony tilt his head back once more. There was a tickling sensation a little lower and when Tony moved to see what it was, a strong hand held him in place. It tickled as Fandral snorted the line off of his skin, and he couldn’t help but laugh again.
“You’re going to make yourself pass out again,” He simply sighed. He wasn’t angry, he wasn’t caring, he almost sounded bored. He began the same hand motion as he did last time to guide Tony’s breathing. Tony hated that he quickly fell into the motions of it.
Tony didn’t bother even pretending this wasn’t what he was here for. He walked up to the VIP section, slipping past the bar and almost right into Fandral.
Tony rolled his eyes, but stood up to snatch the packets for him before he could name a price or something. Perks of sleeping with the man. “Well let’s say I hadn’t in awhile. But damn, that stuff was good--where did you get it?”
So he pushed. And pushed. And pushed. For months, Steve dominated every conversation with “operation baby”. And finally, Tony broke.
“Tony, please, you’re bleeding and you’re probably gonna have some nasty bruises, let me get you checked out, okay?” Peter was begging with him at this point, and despite not wanting to be anywhere near anyone else right now, Tony had to admit he had begun to care for the puckly young cop. Just a little bit.
So they brought him into the station and had him work in this death room with an officer to “keep him company”. The damn guy wouldn’t stop staring at him the second he turned to his computer. If Tony was going to get his data back to his apartment so that he could hack it in peace (hack, god, what a dated term…), he needed a distraction.
“It’s been a long day for me, too,” He sighed, blinking up at the bigger man as temptingly as he could, “think you got something to take the edge off?”
Tony closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. She was giving him a lot of leeway, he could easily just skip town tonight and be in the wind before they realized. Hell, he could leave the
But Tony just moaned again, and Fandral took the chance to silence him with his lips. He wasn’t the best kisser, but anything right now made Tony feel like he was flying. He deepened the kiss, and the blond’s lips tasted purple--he loved it.
“You took Valhalla last night, how the hell did you get that?” She hissed. Peter reacted sharply to her words, standing up as well and staring at Tony in shock.
“What do you wanna do to celebrate, Little Bug?” Steve held the proud five year old’s hand, walking him out of the church.
“I bet you fuck Peter!” Tony shouted and shoved past Steve, reaching his son’s bedroom door. “Peter!” He yelled, pouting against it with his fist, “Peter! Does Papa fuck you?!”
“Don’t really sound like a problem to me, they did your job better than you,” Tony snorted. He was sure there was a downside, things with Howard always sounded better than they were. “So what happened?”
Tony ran his hands down his thighs, rubbing the dealer through his pants and gulped nervously. He was already half hard under there and he was huge. Tony liked a big cock as much as the next guy, but he had to admit it was a little intimidating.
Tony hummed, rocking into his hand as the world around him seemed to fade away, “I would do it for less,” He admitted, not even realizing the words as he said them, “maybe just some company…”
Tony stepped closer, reaching out to inspect the bottle but it was yanked away by the dealer. He frowned at the taller man. “What
“That’s it, Firebird. You like a big cock, don’t you?” Thor taunted. Tony didn’t say anything and the older man yanked at his hair, “Come on, little one. Say it.”
Tony swallowed, looking at Fandral, then Thor, and back to the Captain. “Uh, Tony,” Fandral told him.
“Go on, Little Bug,” Steve nodded, giving him a warm smile. Peter ran forward, wrapping his arms around his legs. For a moment, Steve could pretend that this was them--that this was always them.
Tony turned in his semi-awake state, the words around him fading in and out as he started listening less and less to them. The more he was asleep, the better. The less he had to feel. The less he had to see.
Tony’s hand curled around his neck, supporting his head and holding him close; tight like he might slip away. “I love you, too, Peter.”
“Come on, Tony,” The younger man sighed, jogging to catch up with him. Come on, Parker. What did he have to do to push this one away? How long would it take for him to stop caring? Maybe he could set a new record.
“Alright, Captain,” He snarled before he could talk himself out of it, “You got some questions to answer, asshole. What the fuck do you want with me?”
“Maybe they’ll translate,” Tony suggested, but he wasn’t hopeful. The allowance they received from Obadiah wasn’t really enough to be able to experiment. They had to eat what he cooked, and if what he made was inedible, they went hungry that night.
sorry for what I said earlier. And I hope you have a plan because I sure as hell didn’t beyond ‘get Tony away from the party.’”
“C-Can I write the telegram to Steve that you’ll send?” Tony asked after considering the plan again. “So—so he knows it’s genuine, since he knows how I write,” he added when Victor looked at him in confusion. He did not want to throw the other omega’s kindness back into his face by telling him that he didn’t want to send Steve a telegram that was probably more expensive than his house.
“HA!” Jan snorted, pointing at him, then ducked her head demurely when Jarvis shot her a look. “I mean. Oops. Bad luck, Tony.”
Tony ducked his head to try and hide his pleased flush. “Yes, I did,” he agreed. He couldn’t wait to get to know Steve better.
Tony did nothing but nod, because he didn’t want to make Victor more uncomfortable. He’d always seemed a little cold, but with the knowledge that he’d been kept from close friendships as a child for fear of kidnapping, it made a little more sense why he was… the way he was. Instead, he said, “I was surprised to get your telegram.”
Somehow, something in Tony settled with Jim’s reassurance. He was still frightened, of course—he probably would be until well after they were married, until Obadiah would no longer have a claim on him. But he was no longer scared that Steve would change his mind about him when he saw him, or that they wouldn’t be a good match when they met in person. Jim was just a bystander, so his views were probably at least a little flawed, but he’d admitted that when he’d talked to him. He was an outsider to Tony, too, but he’d thought they’d be good for each other. That had to mean something, didn’t it?
Tony immediately flushed bright red, and he wasn’t even entirely sure why, except that maybe he hadn’t really expected Steve to be so familiar immediately. Then again, he thought, smiling to himself a little as he looked back down at his feet. They’d shared enough letters to be that familiar, hadn’t they?
“Steve,” the waitress gasped in affront as she brought their food out. “Have you made your beau cry already? You’re never going to get married, you idiot!”
Tony flushed immediately at the connotation, and then in embarrassment at how obviously smitten he was. Ana laughed a little, then squealed, startled. Tony and Jan stared at her as she flushed and fled the room before whipping around to look at Jarvis.
Tony cleared his throat and busied himself taking a sip of the drink Ana shoved at him as well. Oh good. She’d put bourbon in it too. He was going to get gloriously drunk before noon and then he’d be too ill to go to the party he was expected at. Anything to avoid Ezekiel, and it would have the added bonus of making him forget Steve’s letter.
Tony had imagined Steve’s face for months, but nothing he’d dreamed of could have prepared him for the real thing. He wondered, in the back of his mind, if he’d been too afraid to hope that Steve would be earnest, kind,
much to offer. You’re clever, and kind, and resourceful. I’m sure you’d figure something out. But I’ll teach you, as much as I can before you leave. I’ll teach you everything you need to know.”
“Your parents had just very suddenly died, Anthony,” Jarvis cut in sharply. “I think we can all be forgiven for being distraught after their gruesome demises. Of course Obadiah would swoop in while we were hurting, telling us he’d take care of everything. The sneaky son of a—”
Tony picked up the scrap of paper with a splash of yellow paint on it again, humming thoughtfully. Steve liked lemon chiffon yellow.
He felt Jan hesitate before she grabbed one of his hands and gave it a squeeze, whispering back, “I am, too.”
“I’m sure it’s a very handsome suit,” Hank said, and then, “Probably some daring color that I would never wear. I should thank you for that—she’s so busy making clothes for you that she doesn’t have time to make more than one suit every once in a while for me.”
Jan’s face did something supremely unattractive, but no one was foolish enough to point it out. “Reed,” she hissed. “Apologize.”
Instead, he was the kind of beta who invested Tony’s fortune without discussing it, who paid Tony’s bills but gave him pittance for an allowance, and who thought it was appropriate to keep throwing his ne’er-do-well alpha son at him. Ezekiel wouldn’t know how to keep his hands to himself if his life depended on it, and Tony was raised just properly enough that he could only brush him off. Good omegas didn’t curse, or fight, or make a scene. Especially when the father of the alpha harassing them had control of their finances.
“I guess… I guess it’s really only just now sinking in,” Tony admitted, finally loosening his grip on the letter. “That I’m going to marry one of these people. I’m going to leave my home, leave New York, everything I’ve ever known. And for what? A person I don’t even really know. A person I can’t even really know until I meet them face-to-face.”
Jan snorted, patting his shoulder fondly. “You may not know his favorite color or what he looks like, but you know he’s modest, and kind, and that he’ll provide for you. You know he’s a great artist, and he enjoys reading, and he’s a hopeless romantic. You know he’ll be kind to you. Think about all the things you know about him.”
It took a moment for the haze of anger to pass, and for Tony to realize what he’d said, and for him to notice how quiet it had gotten around him. He turned his head a little, mortified when he saw all of the other partygoers staring at him in shock. He looked back up at Ezekiel, terrified. Ezekiel still looked angry, but he also looked stunned, as if Tony had slapped him, his grip on his shoulders going lax.
“Timely,” he finally answered. If Jim was also leaving the station, he’d probably not come into contact with anyone looking for him, anyway.
If you’re wondering why Tony is so weak here: This society omega was never allowed to do anything physically strenuous in his life. Rest assured, on the ranch, he will be required to do some heavy lifting, and he will love it. (And Steve will also love it.)
Ana sat down at the table as well, reaching out to refill his glass with the pitcher. “You don’t have to send back a response immediately,” she reminded him gently. “Janet is right. Take some time and just think about it, Anthony. Answer some other letters. Read the newspaper. Take a walk in the gardens. I’m sure that Steve isn’t expecting you to put pen to paper immediately after reading his letter. He’d probably
Ana frowned. Edwin didn’t usually snap about her cutting personal ads out of the paper, nor did he usually turn his back on her when he was obviously upset. She stood up and walked over to gently place her hands on his tense shoulders. “Not good news, then?”
“Does she get an awful lot of answers?” Tony asked, frowning. What if he didn’t get any responses at all?
Steve swallowed thickly, and Tony waited with bated breath to find out if he was disappointed or not. “You’re so much prettier than I imagined,” he finally breathed.
Jarvis, ever prepared, handed the omega the bedpan that had been sitting on his bedside table. Tony bent over it with a loud ‘hurk.’
“We’re not five anymore, Jan,” Tony said, but he was fighting a smile. “I’m not a big crybaby who needs to be protected anymore.”
Tony turned back to the mouthpiece of the phone. “Yes, I’m quite alright. Janet, I’m going to do something duplicitous and I need your help.”
“I suppose,” Tony said, lifting his hand to try and stifle an amused giggle. He wasn’t sure it entirely worked, but Steve appeared charmed by the action, so he didn’t feel too badly about it. He blinked in surprise as he felt paper crumpling against his face and pulled his hand back quickly.
Tony sighed and ran a hand through his hair, frowning. He knew they were right. He really did need to just… think. Could he give Steve those things, or not? Could he manage a life out west? What was he really afraid of?
“Come hold this lace for me,” Jan ordered, and waited for him to obey before asking, “What are you worried about?”
Mr. Jarvis’s tea,” Jan sniffed. She snatched up the tray of bread and jam too. “And I’m going to snoop through what you’ve been reading about.”
Tony sighed, leaning back to look at her. “I think I knew from the moment I started writing letters, I was going to make this choice eventually.”
“It would,” Tony admitted, burying his face into her soft, clean hair. He took a deep breath and let it back out in a sigh, because how often growing up had he looked at Jan and thought the same thing? That if only he was an alpha, she wouldn’t have to put up with everything that she did? He wondered if it was the same for everyone that was born an omega.  “It would. I’m sorry, Jan.”
“Oh, pish posh,” Jan cut in, waving him away. “You know each other well enough. It’s not like I was going to sit in your lap anyway, Hank.”
Tony paused, hand hovering over where he’d just signed his name. Could he even really send these letters? Obadiah would probably look for him even after he was married, and he would be a fool not to have an eye out for any incoming mail for Jan. And Jan had left town with Victor, so Obadiah was probably keeping an eye on Victor’s mail, too. Tony frowned, trying to come up with someone he could send the letters to, but any time he thought of someone, he realized that he would either be putting them in danger because they were his known friends, or he didn’t actually trust them to hide his secret and get the letters to his friends.
Jan wasn’t too bothered. The beta had been sweet, but she’d seen how smitten Tony was with Steve. She’d known that Tony jumped into things wholeheartedly and feet-first and just hoped for the best. As soon as Steve had sent Tony that drawing, Tony’s mind had been made up–he just hadn’t realized it yet.
“I just—want to do everything right,” Steve admitted, turning toward him with a frown. “Especially after everything you told me. I don’t want to offend you, or hurt you, or—”
“Oh,” Tony said, beginning to stand, before all the strength left him at once and he slumped back down. He clutched the letter to his chest. “Oh, oh, oh. Oh my God. Jan. Jan?” He turned toward the door, voice cracking as he shouted, “Jan?!”
“One day you’ll get him fully trained,” Tony joked. “Although having his life flash before his eyes will probably keep him from mentioning how awful my life is to my face ever again.”
Tony shrugged helplessly. “I mean… by the time I realized you were saying ‘Janice’ instead of ‘Janet’ it had already been a few months. I figured Jan would tell you.”
” Victor gasped suddenly, scandalized, and it actually shocked both Jan and Tony into silence. It was too bad that he was so upset he couldn’t truly appreciate that, because it rarely ever happened.
Except he wasn’t sure he could even offer Steve the barest bones of what he was looking for in a mate.
“Thank you, Jim,” Tony said again, and wondered if he’d ever know how much he meant it. “I hope yours is pleasant, too.”
Jan crawled onto the bed behind him, curled up against his back, and pressed her forehead to the back of his neck. “Talk to me, honey,” she whispered, lifting one hand to pet his hair, the other gripping the back of his shirt.
Ana and Jan kept glancing at him worriedly, but Jarvis simply waited, quiet, a soothing presence, until finally he set down one of the letters he was reading and looked at Tony with soft eyes. “Anthony, putting it off isn’t doing you or your beau any good.”
“I’m sorry,” Reed cut in before Tony could say anything, looking out the door nervously. “But we don’t have much time.”
“I think you’ll be good for him,” Jim added as he led Tony over to the steps leading onto the train. “And maybe he’ll be good for you, too. I wish you luck. And knowing it’s Steve, I’ll definitely come around for supper the next time I visit. He’s one of the most easygoing alphas I’ve ever met, so long as you’re not a bully.”
Victor coughed and looked away from them, cheeks going pink as he snatched his hand back. “Father asked me to visit Aunt Agatha at some point while I was here. It’s not putting me out at all.”
Once Tony felt the train moving underneath him, he decided to reward himself with a quarter of his cucumber sandwich.
Tony kept the drawing on hand. He couldn’t stop looking at it. It was beautiful, and the scene it depicted was so incredibly charming. He wished he could frame it, but he was afraid someone would notice it and ask about it, and he felt uncomfortable making up a story for it—not when it was given to him with such sweet intentions.
Jarvis stopped rubbing his back, but he let his hand linger, and Tony was certain it wasn’t his imagination that his hand was shaking. “I’m sure you will.”
Tony doubted they would hurt Jarvis too much, but he hurriedly snatched them from her grasp anyway. It would be just their luck if Jarvis got a nasty paper cut to the face. “Thank you for your help. I’m sure they’re fine now.”
“Thanks,” Tony said again, and offered her the best smile he had in him to give before he curled up on the bottom of the trunk, feet pressed to the carpet bags at the bottom, hugging himself when he realized he didn’t know what to do with his hands. He squeezed his eyes shut as he felt her begin laying clothes on top of him, whispering, “Jan, I’m scared.”
“I’m not your fiancée,” Tony whispered harshly. “And you’re not mine. Take your hands off of me at once. You have no right to be so familiar with me.”
Jan paused when she heard his breath hitch, then ran a hand up and down his back. “Are you okay, Tony?”
“Sir, if your engagement falls through,” Samantha began, then stopped, and instead reached out to grab his hands. She gave them a squeeze, looking deeply upset, before fleeing the room.
Tony got up and hovered over the books, peeking through them thoughtfully. Finally, he decided on a few with interesting titles, and a couple he knew he definitely liked. He couldn’t help but look them over proudly. He was coming to Steve with so little, even just these few things made him feel like he was providing for himself more. Maybe Steve would like these books, too. It would be nice to be able to talk about them with someone. Ana had preferred mysteries, and Jarvis and Jan enjoyed romances.
“Are all Americans gossips?” Victor complained immediately. “Susan asked the same thing. So unrepentantly nosy. It’s none of your business!”
“With a wagon that has an anvil in it,” Steve replied, amusement clear in his tone. “You said you could ride in your first letter. It’s much faster riding on a horse than in a wagon.”
“You have skills,” Jarvis scoffed, offended on his behalf. “If nothing else, you could be a tutor. You know your maths quite handily, and reading and writing, and you keep up on what’s going on in the scientific world. You speak French beautifully.” He paused, thoughtful. “…If you can’t find a husband, perhaps you could find a job as a teacher. I’m sure Ms. Van Dyne wouldn’t mind spotting you some money to get out west.”
Ana shrugged, reaching out to smooth his hair out of his eyes. “Just… if anyone ever asked how you met him, what would you say?”
Finally, impatient, he peeled it open, letting out the quietest of curses and then frantically looking around just in case someone heard. Then he remembered he wasn’t at home and there was no Jarvis to box his ears over it, and hurriedly turned back to the letter, nearly bouncing in his seat when he realized there was another drawing in the envelope.
Tony couldn’t help but swallow at the thought of Jarvis and Ana, wondering if the hurt would ever fade. “Yes,” he answered. “Let’s start there. I suppose that’s how we ended up here, after all.” He took another deep breath. “I can understand if you change your mind after this, Steve.”
to the imagination. Tony didn’t really have any idea who to look for. And maybe—maybe he was getting nervous again. He looked around the platform, frowning, wondering if he’d know Steve if he saw him. All he really had to go on with a brown blob with yellow hair, and Jim's halting description of ‘alpha with a face that isn't necessarily bad looking.’
“It’s true,” Tony added when Victor looked disbelieving. “One way or another, Jan learns everything. She’s someone you definitely want on your side, though. She recently threatened Reed with a shrimp fork.”
He wouldn’t lie and say he wasn’t nervous, because he was, a lot. He’d practiced with Jan and could unscrew the lock from inside by feel so he could get it open, but that was only if his trunk weren’t on the bottom of a pile of luggage. If that happened, he could only count on the two small holes on each end that her father had drilled for air. Jan had called the train station and they’d estimated the trip to Maine would be at least six hours, maybe longer, since she didn’t know which exact stop. He was scared of being locked in a trunk for that long.
“I’m sure he didn’t mean that to be as offensive as it came out,” Susan said hurriedly as Ben yanked Reed away before Jan could stab his eye out with her cocktail fork. “I’m sorry Tony. Please don’t let Jan stab Reed’s eye out.”
Tony turned to look up at her, frowning. He reached out to cup her cheek, thumb coming up to brush the tears from her eye. “Don’t cry, Jan.”
“I’d always go out of my way to help a friend, Tony,” Jan added, and reached out for his hands. “Especially you.”
She smiled sadly and whispered, “Too many to count,” before she gave him one last kiss on the cheek and took her leave of him.
chose.” She smirked. “Remember, omegas and betas of high society still love romance, and won’t it be
“Nice to meet you,” Jim replied, either missing or choosing to ignore his hesitation. “Do you have a chaperone or something? I don’t think I’ve seen an omega traveling alone. Not one who wasn’t wearing mourning clothes.”
Tony sat at Jan’s desk and clasped his hands in his lap to try and stop them shaking. He didn’t want Jan to see how upset he was. She’d doubtlessly demand to know why, and he’d never been good at lying to her. She’d probably go and interrogate the maids for more information. There was no reason to worry about that now. He was engaged to marry Steve. And if… if somehow it did fall through, the beta he’d been corresponding with had volunteered to house him on the west coast. He wasn’t trapped here.
He should have asked for Jarvis to be his guardian. Jarvis knew him, knew what he was thinking and feeling, without even having to say a word. Jarvis was better to him than even his own father had been.
Tony flinched. He didn’t need reminding that Ana had fled from war and persecution. “Obadiah is no war,” he managed to say.
Ana yelped as Jan ducked past her, then grunted as she had to spin with the motion to avoid Tony and his floury hands, too, holding the bag of groceries she’d bought over her head. “Children!” she shouted after them, like she had so many times before, and smiled when they shouted happy, giggly apologies over their shoulders.
Ana smiled, and it was the saddest one Jan had ever had the misfortune of seeing on her. “It’s not selfish, Janet. It just means you care. The only way it would be selfish would be if you disallowed him the chance to strike out on his own. Whether he succeeds or fails is on him—but it’s up to us to allow him the choice to do so, and believe in him. Especially because no one else has.”
“…What about Johnny?” Jan asked after a brief pause to get her bearings. “Other than he needs to stop teasing me about Hank.”
Tony smiled a little down at his stationery. Well, Jarvis had just been trying to help, even if it had fallen flat. At least he’d gotten a good laugh out of it. He picked up his pen, twisting it in his fingers as he tried to figure out what to say, but couldn’t make it further than ‘Dear Steve’ without blushing and letting a high-pitched noise pass his lips.
“…He would let you marry an alpha bachelor of ability,” Ana murmured, and then said, louder, “An alpha of ability.”
Obadiah to take over his finances. It made sense; his parents had had a lot of stocks and bonds, and Obadiah had the business savvy to take care of his interests. Tony would continue living in his parents’ mansion, and Obadiah would take care of his money until he found a suitable spouse. Jarvis, of course, had stayed on to take care of him—Obadiah couldn’t be expected to do
“Hush, Edwin,” she said, getting up from her seat and hurrying over to the drawer where she kept her envelope for her niece. “You married me because you knew I was wild enough to smooth your square edges.” She pulled out the envelope and peeked inside it. There were at least a dozen ads in it, and she was certain she could find more if she looked hard enough with someone else in mind. “And I’ve got just the idea to get our sweet Anthony if not his money, then to safety.”
it doesn’t change my mind. And if Obadiah tries to come and take you back, I won’t let him.” He frowned, brows furrowing together in concern. “Were you worried about that? I don’t want to sound flippant, but… don’t be. His opinion means nothing to me. It’s yours I’m worried about, and you’ve expressed that you want to make a life together. So. Let’s do that.”
But with Steve… Steve had said that if Tony didn’t really want to have children, that that was okay. That was more than most alphas would allow. And it wasn’t like he was… opposed to children. Just… to children with Ezekiel. Steve seemed like a good, kind man. Tony thought perhaps that Steve would… would be a good father. And perhaps he himself might be a good mother, with a supportive mate instead of a selfish one. And of course, after all, Steve had only asked to discuss it. They were still going to get to know each other after he arrived in Timely.
“One of these days she’s going to decide you’re not cute enough to forgive,” Jarvis said mildly. He began to eat again and carefully didn’t wince when he realized his food had gone cold.
Jan sniffled and turned toward him, eyes full of angry tears. “I can’t help it. You shouldn’t be dealing with this. Your options shouldn’t be ‘marry Ezekiel or become a pauper.’ It’s not fair! It’s not!”
Tony fought reflexively as he was dragged down the front steps at a run, but stopped when he recognized who had a grip on him. “Reed!”
Ezekiel jerked him back towards him, smile going mean around the edges. “Tony, come on. You’ve missed two parties. I can’t have my fiancée turn down a dance with me when we’re finally at a party together. People will talk.”
“Ana might know a few recipes,” Jarvis said after some more thought. “I know more mutton dishes than beef.”
Tony took the other bag from Ana’s shaking hand and allowed them to gently push him toward the door. Reed reached out to take the bags, looking pained, and carried them to his car. Tony turned and gave Jarvis one last kiss and lingering hug before turning to step out the door. He would never be able to come home after this.
Victor looked back and forth between them, looking so completely out of his depth that it was almost funny, except for the fact that he’d been calling her ‘Janice’ since they’d met. “It’s her name. Why wouldn’t I call her by her name?”
Tony’s shoulders hunched, and he set his clasped hands in his lap to hide how much they were shaking. “What if what he wants is something I can’t give him?”
Tony paused in refolding the letter, then smoothed it back open, frowning. It really was so impersonal. He hoped Steve wouldn’t be offended. He really was just trying to protect himself. He was pretty sure that Steve would respect that. Steve seemed like the kind of alpha who would want someone to be safe and happy. Tony stared at the letter a little longer. Perhaps Jan was right. Maybe he did know Steve better than he thought.
“In the meantime,” he continued before either of them could cut in. “There’s a stop in Manchester long enough for me to send a telegram to your fiancé and for you to get onto a train going to Chicago. I’ve already made arrangements for you, and I’ll give you enough money to buy a train ticket wherever you need to go once you’ve gotten a response from your fiancé so that he knows to receive you.”
Steve reached across the table and took his hand before he could stop himself. “Tony, all you just told me was how strong you were to escape all that and leave the only support you had behind. Of
“This is really good, Tony,” Jan said, slathering some apricot jam on a slice of bread. “At least you’ll be able to make bread for Steve, if nothing else.”
“Should I get someone to help?” Tony couldn’t help but fret. Jim had been able to push the cart with his trunk with ease, but he’d had wheels to help him at the time. There didn’t look to be any carts handy, and he doubted he’d be much assistance when he’d barely been able to move the cart himself.
Steve smiled even as he rolled his eyes a little. “There won’t be another train stopping for another sixteen hours. I think it’s fine.”
“Oh, yes,” Tony began, leaning down to pick them up, but before he could even reach them, Steve had grabbed them, moving the two carpet bags to one hand. He couldn’t help but stare. The handles were so wide that he couldn’t hold both bags in one hand, and Steve was apparently doing it with ease. He couldn’t help flushing a little when Steve offered him his free arm, reaching out to delicately slip his hand around it. He could feel Steve’s muscles ripple under his palm. He had no idea why he hadn’t thought Steve would be strong. Steve had mentioned manual labor in his letters, after all.
“Aunt Agatha enjoys being scandalized, so it wasn’t an accident that I made you sound like a tart,” Victor deadpanned. “Also, if she’s scandalized it’ll help her remember it. She’ll even make up her own details, and since they’re made up, they’ll all be wrong, and Janice and I will just agree with them.
“Thanks, Jan,” Tony said blandly, copying his notes from making bread over into a clean notebook. “I really appreciate that.”
“And Edwin was so charming,” she sighed, and covered her mouth for a moment. “So sweet, and kind. I fell in love with him immediately. Of course, I did play hard to get,” she added hurriedly. “And my mother didn’t approve, but… then the unrest started happening, and I was frightened—everyone was. So my mother told me she approved, and I went to Edwin, and we married immediately and followed your father to Italy. He paid for our honeymoon. He struggled to show his emotions, but… I think he did try to show Edwin that he was happy for him in his own way. We were so happy.” She stroked her thumb up and down the back of Tony’s neck gently. “We’re
Ana gave him a knowing smile and went back to her own supper, reaching out to give Tony a gentle pat on the back as he came back to his seat to eat.
Could he really just say ‘that makes me really happy?’ It seemed like it wasn’t nearly enough. He wasn’t just happy—he was elated, excited, relieved. He was nervous and scared out of his wits to fail. He was afraid to leave the city life he’d always known, but Steve had made ranch life sound so romantic, if a little lonely. And Jan was right—he was also a little afraid that he’d thrive away from everything and everyone he’d known.
“Maybe the next time you’re in Timely, I can repay you for the rest of my ticket,” Tony replied, feeling guilty that he’d had to offer it so Tony wouldn’t have to pull out anymore money, try to show that he wasn’t carrying more money than he knew what to do with. “Or, um—you could come to supper?”
“Poke it,” Tony repeated, reaching over for his pen to jot that down too. His pen and the paper he was writing on were already covered in flour, but now his pen had a smear of sticky dough on it.
During that time Steve had trials of his own. Like visiting his friends, Bucky and Gail, who expected to hear about his adventures. That first time Steve chickened out and didn’t tell them about him and Antonio, but the next went better. Tony had somehow found time to buy them new rings, to replace those which were left behind, because they never took their wedding bands with them to the missions. Steve had a brief vision how the other Steve would collect the rings from their nightstands in Stark Tower, putting them into the safe, to wait for their possible return. These new ones looked the same: plain platinum with only their names and the wedding date inscribed inside.
After his resurrection, he had seen and experienced all kind of strange things, but if he was honest with himself, this one almost got him to shit himself. Had Janet suddenly turned into a giant? That was a very human and natural first thought, but then he saw those just as big cars, brick walls which seemed to stretch to the skies. She hadn’t grown, it was him who had gotten smaller, turned into an insignificant ant, which Janet was now trying to shake off from her glove. He took a grip, even bit his teeth around the leather, trying not to fall...
“Sit still. Don’t let yourself fall down. That is Tony’s protein shake. He is a master at forgetting to eat anything solid. Drink all of it. I will put a few butterflies onto your back. When you get some food in you the wound should start healing more quickly.”
They were here. He had talked with the other Tony almost daily and they were no closer of getting them home. Steve was with him here, in a strange universe, without his occasional girlfriend Janet or his best friends Bucky and Gail. No wonder he felt confused. No wonder he reached out to Tony, and what had he done. That is right, straight to the dick, when even a high schooler knew that you have to do some snogging before you even thought about the third base.
Steve slept like a roadkill (smelling but not especially in pain) and after he woke up, he gave himself a thorough rub in the shower. It made some of his bigger wounds bleed a little, but the other Steve had foreseen that possibility and left him with a first aid kit. Overall, his bruises and wounds were much better than yesterday and would probably disappear altogether during the next twelve hours.
She went death still. Nothing happened, though, except the man continued. An accusatory tone of his voice made her flinch inside: “You are not like that poor boy. You are one of them.
“Your funeral”, Sam mumbled. He had been warming leftover pancakes in the microwave and came now sitting next to Clint, who had pushed the pause button to talk with Sam.“What are you watching… Oh crap, Clint! Don’t say you were going to show that to a WW2 veteran.”
“I am sorry”, Steve said, because he really was. That was one thing he didn’t miss from the past, those nasty, waggling tongues of people who wouldn’t mind their own business. “That must have been rough.”
Yes, Fury know. So there was a team in that parallel universe, lead by that other Captain and organized by that other Fury (and wasn’t that the most creepiest thought today) and it contained peoples like their Ultimates. The archer. The Widow. The Wasp. The Falcon. Thor. James Buchanan Barnes. Who in that universe was called the Winter Soldier, and who was not a tiny old man, but a tall thirty something with lethal assassin skills and prosthetic arm which crushed metal as easily as a desperate writer crushes draft papers.
He buried his face against Tony’s chest and then he cried, cried like a dame in front of a man, who he had been so long in love with, even if he had actively tried to purify those thoughts from his mind.
“We gave him a pig”, Fury protested, looking offended. “Bruce said he would probably want to hunt his meal.”

“I tried to put you down to avoid this one”, Janet said calmly, rubbing her arm which had been squeezed under the edge of his shield.
An ambulance, maybe he should have risked it and ask for an ambulance, but his head… No meds, no booze, the headache the tumor raised behind his eyes made thinking almost impossible. And then he started to shake.
Steve seemed to understand. He came closer, Antonio could feel the moist of his breath on his skin. The warmth, which his weird super metabolism produced, radiated from him as if he was a star, and he really was, a liquid sun, for planet Antonio to circle and taste…
Antonio Stark came around his head pounding. That was nothing unusual per se, he was a friend of flashy parties and those bedtime after parties, even if he was not particularly fond of those day after gatherings which usually included just him and a toilet bowl. Nowadays there had been less and less those nicer activities and more and more the unsavory part. But shouldn’t it still be almost a week for his next chemo? Was he now getting nausea both before and after the treatment? How convenient.
The other Steve didn’t sound like he was teasing, but he didn’t want to take a risk. And talking, that was Tony’s forte anyway. He shook his head, happy that the T-shirt he was putting on covered his expressions.
“You have seen this a few times... What is happening, buddy? Nat told me you have been acting strange today. I thought you would be sipping imported beers right now with that singer friend of yours. Weren’t you planning to tour with him and his band this weekend? I bet he is not happy to be let down by his best groupie.”
It was Captain Rogers, and he wasn’t at the same time. Like those other figures were not Janet Pym, Tony Stark, or James Barnes. Their Stark had been right. This newcomer could have fooled them. He was so much like their Rogers he could have been an illegal clone.
Oh how Steve was being cocky! He slid his hand slowly down over his stomach, turning his sensible words into a pure filth. Tony god honest whimpered. His neck was blushed and he moistened his lips. Howard had been a handsome fella in a slick, big city way Steve could appreciate, but his son was something else. If there were male sirens, Tony was a descent of those. He didn’t want nothing more than to mess Tony’s combed hair again and suck that delicious looking skin until his pulse points throbbed beneath his probing tongue. But Fury had decided Steve was going to be the leader of the Avengers. A proper leader couldn’t do decisions only with his dick.
What wouldn’t he had given to take it back. That’s right, nothing. In his own universe, Antonio Stark was one of the wealthiest men in the world, in top ten, actually, but here he had nothing of his own. Even the cloths on his back were a courtesy of their hosts. The accommodation, the medical care, the food they were eating, everything. Still, it had felt like he had gained so much, that he had all he needed just in his hand’s reach. It had worked, hadn’t it? Until he had opened his stupid mouth, and said… something. He wasn’t sure what it was, but Steve had left his bed and he hadn’t come back.
The speculations stormed wild for a while. Some romantically orientated were flashing the possibility that Rogers and Stark were decided to quit their day jobs as national superheroes and eloped together, now living in some remote place, keeping a gift shop and helping cats out of trees. They had found pictures were Captain looked at Iron Man more keenly than was necessary if they were only comrade in arms, changing details of their next strategic decisions. Those pictures were impressive as an evidence, if one didn’t know the intense stare Rogers was giving was in truth his usual angry glow to his annoying teammate, and Stark would in no circumstances be satisfied with only one dick, even if it was bigger than his own.
Before the countdown died there was that nasty hurl again. The room was sealed with the best of Stark tech, and it could handle multidimensional travel. It was still unpleasant. There was this strange pressure like somebody unwanted was pushing against your naked body. It lasted only seconds, but the power behind the phenomenon left Fury staggering. He saw from the observation deck how there were now four figures standing down in the target area. The doors opened and agents poured in the room.
“Yes, I told you. That was stupid of me, and this is not because of you. Never because of you, it is because of them. Those Avengers. This shithole universe.” His tone had gotten so much venom he was suffocating from it. “Tony, I thought we got more time, to plan something out, but things got really bad, really quickly. I saw no other choice, but… I am sorry, Tony. You are so fine. I am sorry I wasn’t smarter and stronger and couldn’t get us out of this mess.”
“I called SHIELD to pick it up. Just a few things… Keep your hands in front of your face, the air, the sand pebbles, the insects, they can’t hurt you because of your compacted body mass, but everything will feel very uncomfortable before you get used to it. When we will get there and I will let you drop, it is a sign you are going to gain your normal size. You good to go?”
Maybe he could manage that question if he thought very hard she was meaning home repairs. But of course not. Was this really a good time for his mind to browse stupid memories from his childhood? There had been a birthday card for his mother, her praising his talent to his father who had given him an amused look with a conspiratorial wink. Yes, he had instinctively known that drawing and painting were the tasks better left for girls and women, let them watercolor their little notebooks and write their poems...
Steve noticed he had started laughing. It turned soon an uncontrollable double giggle fit, as the other Steve joined in his burst of mirth. This was… maybe he had missed just this, this rude and honest and playful soldier talk. Camaraderie and dirty jokes.
“Hi”, a familiar voice said. “I thought you and Janet were going on a shopping spree. You too had a change of plans?”
There it was again. A burst of hormones, musk, and sweat which only a stressed out human male could produce.
“Why would I trust some commie cunt, who has sucked treason from the tits of Mother Russia! You pox-ridden whore! You think this is because I am little sore at you. Never mind that SHIELD captured and tortured me because of your crimes. You betrayed Tony! He was your fiance and you tried to steal his fortune and kill him! You let your cronies butcher Clint’s wife and children! You shot Jarvis in the head and plotted with our enemies to conquer our nation!”
“You must be shitting me”, he hissed, standing up. Maybe some hasty steps around the room helped and he had time to modify his words a little. “Rogers, if you wanted to play an eligible bachelor, I could have vetted suitable candidates and sent them to your doorstep as a candy gram. You didn’t have to take the first available... Stark, you nasty little shit! How could you? Seducing and molesting our national icon! You should know yourself already, what do you think will happen when your wandering dick catches another bounty? Do you honestly think Rogers will be gentleman about it and break up with your whorish ass without any fuss? Shut up!” he ordered when Stark tried to speak again. “I don’t care how much dental you will have to buy after that, but I really mind bad publicity which will fall over your team! After that PR-catastrophe with Janet and Hank...”
It had been really nice, this last week. Steve hovering around him like a diligent nurse, raiding nice foods from the kitchen for him. Steve sitting beside his bed, watching TV with him… a companion or a watchdog, any way you like it, so endearing however. Tony could hardly keep himself in check when those big, warm hands were fluffing his pillow or helping him with a T-shirt. Every touch of Steve’s skin made the memory of that kiss raise to surface.
Then there was Steve who could say things like: I-would-have-killed-my-best-friend-and-then-butchered-all-the-evil-men.
“So what do you think, Tony?” Steve-standing-now-besides-Steve-sitting said. “Some brainwashed Skrull duplicate? Malfunctioning AIM drone?”
That was 240 lbs stuttering embarrassment right before Tony’s eyes. He wanted… with Tony? Not for Janet… Oh shit, what had she said to him?
She started to cry. She took in big, ugly gulps of air, which made her body stutter. The man, the monster sat still in front of her and waited for her to calm down on her own.
“I have it here”, the man said pushing towards them a scuffed carryall he had kept hanging over his shoulder. Only Janet’s hand grabbing his arm prevented him to smack the guy in his face and then throw that possible threat far, far from them.
Tech people and Stark were now out of the room. Fury didn’t let his guard down but he relaxed a bit for he was now only one left who would get hurt if something happened. The thing lifted its head and stared for a moment right at Fury. Its brows wrinkled in confusion. Then its gaze dropped downwards to the gun pointing at its direction.
“Well, yes and no. The computer model the Richards are making is almost complete, but there was a little hiccup. Reed needed to consult another expert because of the problems he noticed in one of the equations. Someone he designed the original theory with. Victor von Doom.”
It was an enormous task to raise his hand. Probably there wasn’t even anything, no Steve, but why not to try. What was the worst what could happen, right? He reached with his fingers, and for his confused delight, he felt something touching his skin. Something warm, a warm cheek, his hand was on Steve’s face and then Steve’s massive paw surrounded his hand.
And if they didn’t, then what. He wanted to run out of the door and start looking, and he would have probably done that if he had had even a faintest hint from where to start.
No taxi, but maybe something. Tony was again so out of it, but he had a right idea. The black SUV which had been waiting outside the bar was coming back. Fortunately, they were already out of the seeing range from the gates, and Steve made an impromptu decision, lifted his hand. The car stopped and a man in civilian clothes looked at him with curious delight. He seemed to be a runner of some kind.
He had known Steve was one of his toughest and most complex mission there was, but surprise, surprise, still he had let his dick chose the beat and he had now screwed everything up, naturally. God, if he could at least accuse his medication or lack of booze… but no, it had been only him. Impatient as always, wanting everything right away, not being able to savor the moment. But to see Steve like that... it had been almost too much. So inspirational. Tony had been Tony, unhinged and obviously, Steve had fled.
Steve had been in a war, seen guys acting this erratic when they were stressed out and bone deep tired. He didn’t comment and Tony pulled his shirt back down, took a few staggering step towards metal door, which had been hidden behind shelves full of storage boxes. It was a private elevator. They rode in silence until they came to the right floor. Steve had not been there before, and it could be his other teammates had not been invited either. The rooms were big but scantily furnished, sporting no other colors than whites, grays, and brows. Steve’s mother would have been scandalized. For her the place would not have been a home at all, looking like that, but Steve had already seen stranger things, maybe it was how rich people lived nowadays, or Tony just didn’t care. His bedroom consisted of a walk-in closet, a nightstand, a big bed and not much anything else.
“You should buy a cat to pet”, Tony mumbled coming besides the bed. “Or are you practicing your soft touch? Don’t bother. As Barton stated, I can take it rough.”
Natasha had come to the garage. Maybe she should borrow one of Tony’s cars. To drive a little, to get her head straight again.
No fucking way he would have done this! He was not a damn sheep, there had always been laws which were full of crap. This was not right. Antonio hadn’t harmed anybody. How dare they treat him the same like a common murderer?
“You seem to be awfully calm, darling. Are you really okay with this? Your arms feel tense. If you are going to faint, big guy, I am probably not capable of keeping you upright.”
When it was put in that way, it sounded pathetic. Like being tough meant he was making himself weak, maybe not in the body, but in many other aspects of life.
Richards’s vague stare didn’t turn into a lewd grin. He was still sure he had heard right as a rush of adrenaline from some hidden last resort tried to push his spine straighter. It was an impossible task, he was as stiff as he ever could be.
Alright, Fury said to himself. It was Tuesday. Captain America spitting a severed finger out of his mouth? It was inconvenient, but it wasn’t a visit from Galactus, was it?
Miracles indeed happen. Stark was silent the whole next hour when Rogers gave a detailed report of their doings during the last eighteen months. Fury listened, but he had also time to observe the two men sitting in front of him. Rogers was his usual hunky self, and after they had shaved his beard and hair he had also started to look that way. What was changed most was Stark. The arms below the shirt leaves had more muscle Fury had ever seen him sporting and his skin looked eerily healthy; no dark circles around his eyes from chemo or red blotches over his cheeks from binge drinking.
It was a large carry-all, full of clothes. They had taken away what was left of his uniform and given him lots of gray sport trousers and white, short sleeved shirts, but that was not the case now. Uppermost lay a uniform top like the one he was familiar with. All those other things were there too, boots, helmet, trousers. All fine and better than ever, but Steve’s heart grew cold as he pondered what it probably meant.
“No need.” Steve was now on the spot to assess the situation. “Clint, guide the medics to the second floor. Let’s wait until their examination before trying to move him. I think he has at least a few broken bones and I don’t like the sound of his breathing or that wound in his abdomen. It seems to be deep.”
“That is an easy thing to change”, Sam said briskly. “Hey, you! Yes, you. Open your eyes when I am talking! You want us to help you out of there? Yes? Tell us how the rest of your armor opens, and we will leave and let you be.”
“What is with the attitude, Captain? Or do you think ditching your original colors would wash away a chain of command too?”
“I can’t say for sure”, Tony hesitated. “I mean, he could be a bad guy there. He could be some Hydra subplot, but...”
Oh Antonio. This time Steve didn’t try to hold back his tears, when he stepped in the car and started pushing the address into the GPS device (which was not a useless and annoying device with too many buttons like so many other things in this era, but an ingenious talking map.) To go home, that was a good plan. The only plan, actually. Too bad it was impossible to carry out. But maybe…
It was the fact he was somewhat badly hurt. His head… maybe he was just imagining this conversation, because… What… Potts woman? They couldn’t mean his assistant, could they? And... Iron Patriot? Sex tape? Why did they think he was somebody else? Was his face so badly mangled he was unrecognizable?
Sam slid his hand between the cushions and showed his finding to Clint. “No, that is his. It’s Steve. Put him on the speakerphone.”
“Director, there is no concealing the magical rot of living dead. There should be a clear evil presence. Even hair should stand in your head and blood curl in your veins, if we are talking about a vampire strong enough to pull off a feat Captain performed in the lab. But there is nothing. Whatever he is, he is not a vampire in a way our dimension has used to deal with those dead husks and their malignant spirits. Magically I could as well be looking at an average human being. His aura looks quite nice, actually. A perfect balance on his every hue. His reds for example: so grounded, strong-willed, energetic, sexual, and passionate. But also sensitive, artistic...”
Something flashed in Steve’s eyes and Nat felt a faint hope he would suddenly come to his senses and stop his folly. That chance passed when Steve took a fast step forward and pulled his gun out again. Nat raised her arms. That gave Steve a pause and she had time to jump backwards and out of the roof and the line of his bullets. It was a seven-story building, but as Nat had known, Tony was hovering there, ready to catch her up.
“N-no...” he was able to get out. He put his shaking fingers to Tony’s lips, and he seemed to understand, at least he grew quiet. More of those words, and that would certainly be the end of him. Steve shook like a dog in a downpour when his body tried to pump more fluids out of his already empty balls. His arms trembled so badly he let himself collapse beside Tony on the bed. Good it was wide enough, he didn’t want to squeeze Tony beneath him.
“That’s the thing, Doctor. I would be the worst teacher you could find, or maybe the best, I don’t know. I was praying, yeah, that is what we Catholics do when we are taken prisoners by the Nazi collaborators. Or what we thought were… Yes, I talk with our Lord and because he is usually occupied with more important things than my whining, I ask Holy Mother of Jesus Christ to put me in the waiting line. They teach these things in Sunday School. You don’t need me to manage that, and I am a lousy example of Christian virtues anyway. Maybe try that other thing instead.”
“Yes, honey”, Gail helped, when it seemed Bucky wasn’t going to get it. “Steve and Tony, they have gotten married.”
“It was in my garage. Behind the tool cabinet. Are those aliens now leaving these kind of things in people’s homes? Is this some kind of mind control device? Are we going to be invaded again?”
Who was he kidding? He could be a dumb soldier boy from the by-gone era, but even he realized that those nanoparticles and locators could be used to find them as easily as they had found Antonio and the parts of his armor. In this universe, there was no place for them to hide.
“You can think us like a police force. A superpowered one. There are lots of superpowered criminals, you see, and alien invasions and mad scientist and would-be conquers of the world.”
It had been just some guy. An ordinary man, a thirty-something electrician, who was writing how he had been thinking about suicide, but if a man from the 40s can live his life as an openly gay man so could he and his family and relatives be damned.
Steve let go. For a moment he was so confused, scared, and full of hope, he only lay on the floor and breathed. It couldn’t be. He must have heard wrong. A plot. It had to be. He had bested their champion and now they tried to confuse him.
His musing were interrupted when Tony stepped in front of him. The older man was much shorter than him, the top of his head came a little over his shoulders, but his stormy visage and taunt back added to him some extra high.
The comment was rewarded with a laugh which sounded like an asthmatic donkey. “Your daddy let you play with his toys, bum boy?” Not-Jake continued. “Well, you screwed something up really bad. No joyride for you, fella.”
There was a tiny box, which he was passing to Rogers. Fury bent forward like doing that he would see better. But damn, maybe it was something dangerous, and if not that, stupid and inconvenient.
“Yes, guess what, he is our landlord”, Barton piped up. “And the maker of our awesome weapons. That is why we badmouth him only behind his back.”
“Steve…” Antonio said and now he started to sound worried. Maybe he thought like those Avengers that he would be triggered by any worse word. Maybe he would, and what would then happen? Would he break the wall? Break Tony? Start to cry like some dame?
“Yes, Tony we are talking about sex. I thought… these modern woman, they are not always such ladies, and I thought she has told you…. About me, I mean.”
It was both eerie and reassuring to see her friend’s face looking so kind again. Steve noticed something was bothering her and his handsome visage froze as he scanned the garage quickly to detect a possible threat. Not finding anything, Steve continued his unpacking.
The other Tony was staring at him, a nervous twist in the corner of this lips. “Maybe he really hates that wall”, he whispered to Barton, who nodded, mock serious.
“Doctor Banner… I… I am not sure. If this would be a patient, I mean, a living patient, I would say we have a faint heartbeat. It is probably just...”
“This is mine. You can take a shower too. Help yourself with the clothes you find in the closet. I will be in the kitchen doing us something to eat.”
“Captain Danvers. Take a memo. Start vetting suitable orphaned children. Call a heads up to the PR-department, and… they probably suggest the kid should be PoC, I think. Well...”
“Alright, what was it? Was it the Kardashians? I said to Bruce we should leave them out, but he insisted. Oh well.”
“My brain is fine. I even remember the Avengers Initiative is not officially started, so technically Bruce and I are not teammates. Close acquaintances? Yes. But...”
“They bid me to ask you slyly are we talking about biblical Cain. I assume from their tones they don’t like much about the man.”
“I knew it! Sam, I told you… he looked so much like Stark, that guy must have been a son of one of his mistresses’...”
It was a face again, a telephone call with a moving picture. He recognized the negro officer who had shot him in the science lab. “Stark! You idiotic little shit! What the hell do you think you are doing!”
It shouldn’t hurt. That was what he had always admired in Steve. His honesty and loyalty. Even if Janet and he were not really together, they were not being either. “That is totally understandable. This situation… it is no wonder you miss her.”
“If we are lucky”, Tony snorted, hearing their conversation. “That would be easier than the Microverse… oh hi, fellow genius”, he said to somebody on the line, turning his attention back to his tablet. “We were speculating if you are on Earth… Do you have a moment? We are in a bit of a jam around here.”
“It is much more comfortable than my old one. Thank you, sir. Please deliver my thanks to Mr Stark also.”
She halted as the scene at the kitchen table finally registered in her mind. Maybe now was the time to say something. Apologize. Yes, the silent storm brewing on that pretty face demanded apology, preferably right now. He almost raised his hand like a kid in the classroom.
“Oh god, Steve. You are a star pupil… alright soldier… you recon… you execute… I have to say… We usually use condoms… when we do things… like this… but… your… immunity…. Yes, just like that… oh god! You are killing me darling… yes, yes, a little more pressure… Oh fuck! Oh fuck! Darling, you don’t have to… oh god, that is my brave soldier boy… a head first to the unknown… oh! Oh! Oh! Please… careful with the teeth, love… yes, just like that… Don’t… don’t… you will gag… Oh, you don’t… oh god, so good… Steve! Steve, pull away… I can’t… I will...”
Had the other Steve heard his moaning and panting? Of course he had, the enhanced fucking hearing. Just as he thought his humiliation wouldn’t go any deeper, and the other Steve, sitting there like begging a fist into that mug face of his. But he couldn’t do even that, could he? The Avengers had let them stay, they were taking care of Tony even if Steve had let them no reason to act so charitably. What if he now went ballistic and they thought it was the last straw? How could he help Tony only by himself?
“Never mind.” For his surprise she really seemed to mean that, even gave him an impish smile. “Your Janet never used Pym particles like this?”
“You want me to return the favor?” he asked, his heart pounding. He was already moving his hand, the question had been only common courtesy. Why wouldn’t Tony want to orgasm? But Tony’s next flippant words put the end to his movement as efficiently as somebody had severed his arm.
“He was among those American soldiers who reached the first Nazi concentration camps”, she explained through her gritted teeth. “He must have seen how his comrades in arms gave their chocolate rations to the prisoners. Do you know what happens when you eat too much or too fast after months of starvation? You die, that was what happened to some of those children. They died, Fury, on the arms of their saviors who had become their killers instead.”
That seemed to take Steve back. “So… it is really no then? The other Steve said maybe I understood it wrong.”
“Yes”, Janet said. “I can see you got it. Can you stand? At all? We have to go outside and explain this to your Steve before something worse happens.”
“What?” Steve panted, sitting down on the corridor floor, waiting his body to stop burning. “Have you all become mad… what is wrong with you? Don’t you see...”
As if they had been only waiting Nat’s sure words, meters started blinking on the left corner of the dashboard.
That was him. Either a full throttle or no movement at all. He took Tony’s hand and kissed carefully those strong and restless fingers.
“But it is because of famous Nicholas Fury paranoia”, Janet continued, shaking her head. “Yes, we know.”
Maybe Steve was taken back by the facts in her speech, but seeing that hated face up close, her expressions showing faked understanding and worry, made him blow a gasket.
SteveToo fired again and then moved like a fox in the bushes. The mansion grounds were quite a maze, lots of trees and statues and other things which made excellent covers, but it was still starting to be ridiculous.
in your universe? That is epic! It would be fun, when it seems there will be no public executions scheduled today.”
“Against those losers?” It was so odd to see the archer grinning. Barton hadn’t had nothing much to laugh about recently. “I bet Spidey could have handled them alone, but Steve is always such a mother hen. Or adrenaline junkie. Maybe both. What do you wanna watch? A war movie? Hey, do you have
“Keep him out. I am not in a mood for any manly hysterics. He can break his knuckles on the walls when we get his friend to the SHIELD base… oh damn!”
“Stark doesn’t eat this slop”, Barton could say and smirk at Banner whose kitchen turn it had been. “He is probably stuffing his face in some Michelin star place right now. Or stuffing his face with desert, you know.”
“Don’t you dare”, Tony hissed. “Come on. Nobody wants anything from me except money or joyride. Is that it? You want to finish our little session?”
The street was a dead end. Both sides of the road were full of cars, which were so run-down looking that maybe they had been left there in a vain hope somebody would steal them and take them away. There had been no onlookers to see their extraordinary appearance. Maybe they had just watched them from the windows, because they didn’t have to do more than walk across the street, and there was a man coming to greet them. He took a firmer grip of his shield, but the guy seemed to pose no threat; he was middle-aged and tout and more anxious than angry.
How Steve hated those words! He had heard them too often from his own lips too. Tony’s hands were curled to protect his chest. The duvet was down on his hips and Steve saw glimpses of big, ugly scars like somebody had tried to rip Tony’s heart out.
That was Reed Richards? He was sporting a beard. No snarky or cruel twist on his lips, only a familiar, vacant air of a genius. Like his mind was going million miles a minute while he was talking with them.
“Believe me, he is here, in the City, and he is pissed. He tried to decapitate me with his shield. Fortunately, the bus tossed him...”
“I meant I can give him to you if you want to pet him. I though to ask first because you don’t look like a farmer’s daughter. More like a fancy lady. Moody little missy.”
Yes, that. Not his proudest moment. But Howard wouldn’t have given him that magnificent shield otherwise, and there had been a battle coming. Their superiors had been hushed about future plans, but they all knew their next fight would be a big and bad one. And it was, the one they called Omaha beach now. So Steve had lied. Or not exactly lied, but went on with Howard’s silliness. And Howard. With him it was always good food, tasty drinks, and he looking at Steve like he wanted to eat him alive. He liked that. It was nice to be admired and wanted and not in pain and scared all the time. To feel like a male Cinderella. Even if it was all just hoax, for a little while he could pretend it wasn’t. That Howard really wanted him, and not only things he thought Steve could do to him.
He passed out again. This time when he woke up, he almost longed that nauseating swaying. Something was rocking him hard, drilling his armor, making it vibrate. He gritted his teeth together, but his head felt like it was breaking apart. The ache in his chest was suddenly too much and he puked out of pain, which was unusual, the pain was one thing he had used to live with after his cancer diagnosis. It was only a little whiskey and gastronomic fluids, but it earned him a tap on his head anyway.
Tony had been poking Fury’s side for a while now. “We could… yes, we don’t have to make clones, like they have done with those prehistorical animals. If he is in such a good condition, they can have his sperm samples.”
“How do you control it?” Banner mumbled like fearing somebody else was listening their conversation. “How can you control that monster inside you so effortlessly? I mean… you were… You and Tony… And your fight with Thor. You were very drunk… in spite of that you didn’t go rabid either time.”
Normal alcohol had no effect on Steve. This was something else. Asgardian fire wine, Thor had called it. Steve felt a light alarm when he realized he too was starting to be God’s honest drunk. Thor proved to be the type of man who cried into his pint. He was also a man who took any opportunity to boast about his prowess.
That this Tony was not courting Natasha he could understand. He had never liked that smarmy smiling spider, not even before her betrayal. It told something about his tiredness he started to wonder aloud girly things like that. “I mean… Isn’t she a… I don’t know, I have already seen that both Tonys have quite big personalities. One would think she would be a tad plain for his taste.”
It had been almost eighteen months now. The newspapers had milked all there was to write about that faithful battle in Long Island, and only clickbaits tried anymore. There were texts about alien abduction, which was not far from the truth, when you thought about it. They had searched the battleground right after their assets’ disappearance and found lingering residues, which were suggesting the presence of a localized space-time continuum anomaly, or a worm hole, as the general public liked to name the thing. The SHIELD (and Fury) had kept the information from the news and been very tight-lipped about things in general.
Yes, after his catastrophic relationship attempts with Gail and their Janet Antonio was maybe allowed to say things like that to him. It still made Steve want to hit his fist in the wall. This was exactly what he was talking about. So confusing. If Antonio liked women too why did he then…
Then a horrid idea came to Antonio. What if it really had been Steve’s first time, not just with Tony, but overall… no, it couldn’t be, Steve had been with Janet, or our Janet, as he added in his mind. A funny habit, which were not so funny after all when one thought…
That announcement left Fury flabbergasted. “But how can it be? He is a fucking vampire! Anderson, if you can’t feel it, maybe it just means that thing is good at concealing itself.”
Then there was only the dressing problem left. He almost fell on his ass when he opened the door of the walk-in closet. There were half a dozen expensive looking suits and almost twenty different dress shirts and button downs, shoes and boots and sneakers, piles of T-shirts and jeans, sports wear and underwear and accessories. He wondered how his counterpart could had afforded this all, when he himself had came out of ice having nothing. The salary SHIELD paid him wasn’t nothing much either, but he could afford one good suit and some other necessaries.
Fury didn’t answer. If the glass broke that thing with Steve Rogers’s face would be the last of their worries. The pink mist filling the room would kill them both before those teeth would be anywhere near their jugulars.
Incredible was one way to describe it. For those other ways Fury had his gun in his hand. It would took only a fraction of second to shoot at that thing through his grubs. Captain didn’t move from the table, but sat his head hanging, only occasional coughing fits making his body stutter. That would give Fury some time to evacuate the room.
Would the other Steve have done that? Killed her? Really? He could be rough, bordering sadistic, as Janet had seen when they interrogated the goon who had taken Antonio. The thought made her shiver as she remembered their team leader’s other words.
“What everloving… Is that guy for real? That was the worst case of gaypanic I have seen for ages. But why did they run? Did he get scared we would punish them for pummeling that idiot? What the hell kind of universe are they from?”
Steve had to snort at that. “Well, we will see about it. The history is written by the winners. That can lead to unexpected results. The good will or heart doesn’t matter, even bravery is not enough, if you don’t have power to back it off.”
That was not Tony’s usual non-flirting, that was a real thing and like a fool he fell for it. He bent down and touched carefully those waiting lips and felt how they yielded beneath him. Tony’s goatee was neat again, maybe the nurse had done that too, but he felt its raspy presence, which was so different than those softer faces of Gail or Janet. So different… so fine. Tony opened his mouth and Steve felt how something wet and careful touched his upper lip. It moved over, and Steve opened up, maybe because of surprise and cautious wonder. What it would be alike to feel Tony inside of him like that, his whole tongue, touching his, roaming inside of his mouth, searching, probing… Steve was never before kissed like that. Janet hadn’t like to kiss him and Gail had kept her lips closed like he himself had done. Maybe he had seen people kissing open mouthed in the movies, and that had felt… odd, to but it mildly. It looked like it couldn’t be pleasant, but it was, how it was!
The leftover pair had frozen in the couch, their game forgotten. Janet stepped calmly forward and took a remote control. The screen grew quiet.
“This is nanotech we are talking about.” Richards seemed to find his bearings when they moved from social relations back to the safer ground of science talk. “Those particles can't be seen with plain eyes nor will they all disappear without special cleaning procedures. If you have used your uniform even once in the vicinity of that technology, we will have all the samples we need from it. Do you like to watch police series, Captain?”
“No need to stop for that, Nat”, the leader of the team advised. “We are doing this in an old-fashioned way. You all know that only sissy boys use parachutes. Happy landing!”
Tony let the phone slump between them on the mattress as he hid his face with his arm. “I think I broke my Assistant Director.”
Antonio gave his customary smirk, and if it was a bit strained, well, then it was. “It is you, isn’t it? The other Steve? What is this? Are you two bonding through pranks now?”
The elevator binged, coming to the upper lever. One flight of stairs and they would be outside as he remembered from his previous journey. Had it been only yesterday? He took a quick glimpse from the corner of his eye to the woman who was now giving him the same airs as his Janet when he said or did something that made her call him insensitive or stupid, old-fashioned oaf.
Don’t think… you have been so good recently, not making pass on guys, he had been careful not to spook Steve. And honestly, who other guy could ever compare?
, Fury had time to think. Where were those sparkling vampires who idled their days away pining over little high school girls? Why did Fury always get only that other kind?
The billionaire genius had kept his visor up, so Steve saw how his features sank, his big brown eyes got a vacant look. Tony seemed to be deep in thought, and more than a tad worried.
Sam Wilson had a light emphatic ability which enabled him to connect with the bird life. For some reason, Janet had always took that as an ability be more intuitive than average people.
“Yes, Nat told me. His story of her nastier skills I can comprehend, we all know Nat could take over the world if she wanted to, but that some poor woman would have made children with Barton, that thought is like from some tragicomic fairy tale.”
Antonio was awake. He seemed lucid, but Steve couldn’t be sure. He reached and touched Antonio’s cheek and found out how cold it was. Long and delicate fingers raised to cover his paw as Antonio’s lids fluttered. “Hey. Are you… you are here?”
They were still side by side so Steve felt as Tony’s arm tensed. “Isn’t that obvious, darling. You seem to like when I speak.”
She was starting to explain. How this all was just one big understanding, how she was sorry they had been busy, that even if Antonio had never officially met her, he should listen. She was indeed going to say all those right things, but then he noticed what Antonio was squeezing in his left hand. A grenade. He had already pulled its pin out and pushed now his hand against his chest.
“There is that”, Steve admitted. “If there is no shady purpose, why of all the addresses in the City they chose 890 Fifth Avenue?”
Steve nipped that other ass to drive his point home. Tony whimpered, turning to look Steve over his shoulder. He stared at him for a long seconds as if trying to find falsehood from his words. Then Tony reached to his nightstand and grabbed his phone.
“Yes, Nat. A good point. Now, maybe… should we call Fury and ask him to remove that… whatever he is. Shit, maybe I better…”
Then she was given an order which would turn her life upside down. She should expose and kill an American superhero, Iron Man.
The door to the observation deck opened, and there he stood. Not a hair out of place, in his Tom Ford suit, because the occasion wasn’t worth of his hundred thousand bucks Alexander Amosu Vanquish II Bespoke. Or so he still thought. If he had known what Fury’s call had been about, he would have brought his fifty-two year old single malt Scotch with him. A hundred thousand again, but who was counting. Maybe he would have given Fury a sip too. Just because Fury had called him and told him the news.
Steve saw no problem in that. When Ralph passed a proper weight limit, they would eat him. But for that proposition Clint looked he was about to feint, and Bruce didn’t seem happy either. Steve learned new things every day, and that day’s lesson was people in the future ate meat, but were squeamish when they started to think where it came from.
Now their commanding officer chose not to shut up Barton? Or was this usual in the future? To make small talk about your sexual habits? Maybe it was just that Fury enjoyed to listen how his team bashed Tony Stark.
“Surrender!” Steve ordered, still pummeling his counterpart. “Surrender, you have no weapons or your shield, you don’t want us to hurt you as badly as you deserve!”
So Antonio was healing well, the Avengers had found his missing armor parts, it would have been so much easier for all of them if they could just go home. Except they couldn’t, of course. They were still stuck in this universe until Richards and Stark came up with something, and it made it all worse. At home there would be another mission, another catastrophe, and Steve could have tried to forget what had happened. But no. He was here, and Antonio was here, and all in this place made him remember how he had bent over Antonio, who was lying helpless in the four poster bed, lying there in pain and confusion when Steve had kissed him, a hand around his neck, ready to twist or squeeze.
Stark was standing there his phone in his hand, taking time. Fury was still shaking in his boots. He didn’t appreciate the gleeful tone in Stark’s voice. “Team, wait my signal. Our guest has to be moved to our Hulk safe luxury suite before he wakes up.”
The next morning something strange happened. More strange than flying magic hammers and having a visit from a viking god, perhaps.
His words made the man’s face blush and the blood bump in his veins. Somebody calling his stupid? Saying him no? Was that all it would take to make his breath catch and manhood swollen?
It had been only an hour when Tony started whimpering and trashing in his bed. A measly hour. No wonder Tony didn’t want to sleep. Why bother, when you didn’t rest anyway?
“It is the same. In the trunk, the equipment are picking up faint noises, like somebody was kicking the trunk cover.”
The Avengers. What a strange name. What would they be avenging? “Yes, we too have a team, and Tony and I are part of it. We are called the Ultimates.”
Steve tried to digest that. He and Bucky… no, not even when they were young. It was almost impossible to imagine his little pal as a sexual partner. But maybe Tony was right. He was a big fluffy romantic inside, because the other Steve finding his Bucky didn’t feel bad at all. This James… he had to be as old as his Bucky and Gail were now. No wonder the other Steve was pissed off that his counterpart had run away after sex, he probably didn’t have any if he wanted to be faithful to his sweetheart. And he was, Steve guessed. They wouldn’t be that different. James was the one, and there was nobody else. He had thought Gail that way, even if he was seeing now he had been only going through the motions. Find a girl, have a family. As was expected. No fucking across Europe for him. Maybe he should have. Maybe if he had been more skillful Antonio would have given him some lack.
There was no way around it here. Nothing to distract him from his thoughts, so he sneaked to the fridge to get food, sneaked to the room the other Steve had arranged for him, hovered at the door of Antonio’s room, watching the nurse, who was chancing his drip. And Steve was thinking: that bed could be empty, Antonio could be dead. Not because of Barton, who was wise enough to stay elsewhere after the incident. Not because of the other Steve, but because of him. He had almost done that to Antonio.
“Open it up for us. Do it, or I will mash your pretty little face and take it anyway. We can always empty your armor like a soup can.”
“Yes, but we are not in that stage yet. That we start to eat each others, I mean. If I promise you can gobble me up first, would that be better?”
Steve listened (somehow he always seemed to listen very carefully when Tony talked, expecting some kind of gay trap, perhaps?) and he seemed to buy it. Of course. It probably wouldn’t occur to Steve that his teammate would be dishonest enough to lie to him. Or to bend the truth for his own benefit, even if in his mind Tony said he was doing it for Steve.
“What are you talking about? He left for his road-trip, I watched through the security cam how that sexy, jeans-clad behind embraced the saddle of his motorbike… He should be in Philly already.”
Barton whistled. “Oh shit, Nat. I knew your feelings were hurt when Steve here started name calling, but you shouldn’t need to make us a new one. What if he hates you too? Then we have to listen to them in stereo, and he is so old I doubt he comes with DTS sound.”
“Copy that, Agent Taylor. The subject’s vehicle is continuing their designated trail, as expected according the coordinates of their GPS device.”
Steve checked again that the guy in the trunk was still breathing. Then he helped the gate to open with his shield and as usual, the ordinary metal bent and broke under his ministrations. Something was wrong, though. Let’s call it instinct, he scanned the perimeter with his gaze but didn’t see anything unusual. No movement, nobody came to ask what the hell he was doing. Only that… There was something mildly off about the sky behind those trees, but now was not the time to investigate it any further.
He pushed the door open and then they were on the roof. The flying vehicle was in the usual place, its hatch door now open. There were two figures standing on the ramp, the other Steve and some unfamiliar black guy in a red and white uniform. They seemed to be deep in conversation, which ended when he and Janet came along.
Steve sighed. He had gone through this with Tony, when the man was still drinking. The addicts were hard to be friends with. Even when they were only not so close acquaintances, like friends of his friends. Maybe it would be better for Steve to forget the whole mess. But of course he couldn’t. He was Captain America. Always fair, always trying to make it better for everyman.
“And this other matter our Tony mentions? If it is true, I don’t want any high school drama. Again”, Fury added, giving him a meaningful stare from his only eye.
Steve blinked. He had realized the time passing, but in his greed to see more wonders and horrors he hadn’t stopped to think what it all meant. Not to the world, but to him, personally. Now it all rushed into his mind. Seven decades had passed. His whole world had gone just like that. Not destroyed by the bomb, but forgotten in the stream of time.
If it was all just one big lie, it was so skillfully made it was like magic. He shouted in surprise when the film suddenly gained color. The face behind the calm male voice was reveled. The narrator was a middle aged man, who looked like a college professor.
First Count Nefaria fiasco and now this. If they were a corporation, one could say their quarter report sucked.
That made his lips almost twist in their own accord. “We could do the roof”, he said and almost spooked himself. Why had he suggested something like that?
“Oh God”, Tony moaned, closing his eyes. He was going commando. Steve let his hands roam over Tony’s hips and ass, which he remembered to be so nice and firm. “Oh yes”, Tony wailed, as Steve pushed his trousers down to his thighs, sliding onto his knees in front of Tony and nuzzling his groin with his nose and cheeks. Oh that smell and warmth! It was driving Steve wild. Taking a good grip of Tony’s ass, he licked the side of his member from top to root. Tony trembled when Steve’s breath caressed the wet stripe. Satisfied with the response, Steve took turns to lick Tony’s dick and balls and nibble his inner thighs with his teeth. His fangs pushed, but didn’t break the skin as Steve sucked dark dots on that smooth skin, teasing them both by pulling blood closer the surface.
The nurse Charlie had took a drip away this morning. He imagined what it could have been alike, if Steve had… oh god, those hands, touching him like he had fantasized so many times. Steve’s moist breath on his skin, a hand sliding his foreskin away to get to play with the knob. That calloused thump sliding lowly over his open slid...
“Alright. Can I connect the other Steve to our comms now or do you still want to keep him out of the loop?”
It had been that famous one time between them, but what most people didn’t know, their fumbling, painful act of love and curiosity had its severe consequences. After Steve had gone missing, Gail noticed she was pregnant. The government didn’t want a scandal which a bastard child of their national icon would have been during those days. They took her son away and lied to her he had been adopted into a decent family. In reality, he grew up in a military base with soldiers and scientist until adulthood. His leaving home was something else though. It turned out he had just played a role of an obedient soldier boy, biting his time, and when that time came, he killed every living soul in the camp, making it a flashy start for his career as a psychotic, murdering gun for hire.
If the other Steve heard one word wrong, maybe that was how Steve had planned it. He was no amateur in the psychological warfare, and he was nowadays able to use non-discriminating language while doing it. SteveToo was fending off Iron Man’s blasts like they were just an afterthought, his shield moving fast as a snake’s head while he rushed towards taunting figure in the middle of the opening, and then he was on Steve and they were pummeling each others like there was no tomorrow.
“You understand me wrong, Steve. I wasn’t judging you. I just thought after all this time you deserve something good for once, big guy.”
Somehow he found power to turn the shower tap. He shook under the water until his feet gave out and he collapsed on his knees. The water pouring over his head and nose made him gasp for breath.
Maybe it was that all-knowing eyebrow. It was like the other Steve had sat inside his head, knowing what he was thinking before he himself knew it.
That was an address better know as the Avengers mansion. It was empty now, had been abandoned for years after their team relocated itself into Stark Tower.
The giant seemed not too eager to follow his line of thinking. There was that buzz of talk and then:
Tony didn’t throw anything, but took several gulps from his mug. The coffee calmed him down. Or at least he fell silent. Somehow, it wasn’t much better.
The other Tony chuckled. And he had thought that Barton fellow was the only sadistic bastard of this group. “Oh yeah”, Iron Dickhead said, licking his lower lip. “It really seems you guys have some fight ahead. If it is hard or not, I think that depends solely on you, Captain.”
He didn’t know? Steve who had fought four years in the biggest war seen by mankind? He who had risked the existence of his very race to make the horror and slaughter stop faster? The plan of the Elders had been a clever one. Elder Erskine was supposed to invent a so called super soldier serum, which would then “change” the young ones of their clan to superpowered champions of the nation. And then, maybe then they would be again like their ancestors had been under the rule of the great Alexander the Conqueror. They would be respected for their skills and power, not feared and persecuted like some fairy tale monsters lurking in the darkness.
“Tony,” Jim whispered harshly, putting his hand over the purse so he could block any wandering eyes.
a real firecracker, dear,” Ana said, and stood. “I’m going to go look through some of my powders. Surely one of them will go with your skin tone to make you look pallid without it being obviously fake.”
And taking care of the house? He could do that. If he had all day to do it, he could probably even manage to make his work look passable. Steve had said he could entertain, too, so… so maybe if Tony made friends, he could do that. Steve seemed to really want him to like Timely and the people in it, so he would probably make friends to spend time with. Surely someone would be his friend. He hoped he didn’t come off as stuck-up. He’d heard that sometimes city manners didn’t translate well in the west. Hopefully the people of the town were as kind as Steve himself was.
“Mail call!” Jan shouted gleefully as she pranced into the kitchen with the letters held triumphantly above her head, then paused, hand slowly sinking until the letters were pressed to her chest. “Oh. Am I interrupting something?”
Tony read the letter over and considered inking out the entire sentence, but… it was the truth, after all. He did want Steve to be comfortable with him. And maybe he wanted Steve to know that, even if it
