“Yeah give me a history lesson. You’re the best for this, and not the two people under my roof that were born in the twenties or something.”
Steve laughed, while making himself a coffee. “That’s called connecting, you get to know new people. It’s usually fun.”
“Sit down on the couch. I make hot chocolate, then we talk.” Steve decided and sat his boyfriend down on the couch before heading into the kitchen.
“Multiple reasons to be honest. I had a few ideas for my future. The army was the most secure, financially speaking. I was 18 and alone, my parents didn’t really leave much behind at least not enough to pay off college. Another maybe silly reason was that I wanted to honor my dad. He hadn’t really a choice either, grew up poor so he went to the army. He wanted to retire from the army after his last deployment.”
“Yeah, yes, I am, and I would really like to stay, Tones.” He said softly. “But this is something bigger than me, bigger than anything I ever had to do.”
“Don’t call yourself that.” Tony said silently, laying down his tools. “I’m serious. I’m good at maths, physics, robotics, but you are good with people. That’s so much more important than my skills. I’m no good with people, I’ve never been. They don’t understand me, and I don’t understand them. Rhodey and Pepper are the only friends I ever had, because they made a lot of effort, no thanks to me at all. And thanks to them, I got myself a group of friends. I threw parties and stuff, had lots of one-night-stands, but for those it’s just the look that is important. Not me.”
They slept well into the morning, having a relaxed and peaceful sleep. Steve was the first to wake, eyes opening to a great sight. Rays of light poked in through their window, laying delicately on Tony's face. He reached out to stroke the man's cheek in a feather-light caress.
I can fuck this up. Hopefully," Tony babbled, staring at Steve's hands, "If I do, oh well, I tried. All's fair in love and war-- God, I'm just blubbering on, hold up--"
The blond groaned as he felt Tony starting to clench around him, pleasure building up in his body wave after wave. He reached around, pulling off the cock ring and taking Tony in his hand.
The boy eventually nodded, cries subsiding to sniffles as he hunkered down under the covers, face a little blotchy from the tear tracks.
Peter's pile, of course, was marginally bigger than everyone else's, but Tony grinned as he motioned for the others to open theirs first.
"Are you complaining?" Tony asked, an amused smirk on his face, "It's one of the have-to’s of dominance, I guess. Being gentle when not screwing around." He shrugged, pushing Steve's bangs to the side.
“Love you, too." Steve hummed, back arching at the touches and kisses. He ran his hands up and down along Tony's upper back sweetly, keeping them held close together.
Peter let out a shrieking giggle at the kisses, wriggling in Tony's arms. "Daaaaaddy! Quit!" He squeaked.
Steve asked himself, examining his thinner frame. He was much smaller. Far shorter, which he was sure wasn't because of his lack of a tail. Any muscle he had before was completely gone, his face looking well rested but slim.
Tony finished up dinner before poking his head into the guest room, smiling fondly at the tiny notes left for him from Pepper and Natasha; he tossed their sheets in the laundry room and grabbed the huge stack of papers left for him, swiping the windex and making his way upstairs. He couldn’t hold back his grin at watching Steve sleep, wiping down the desk before starting on his mound of homework.
Steve thought for a moment as those words clicked in his mind. A soft smile came onto his lips and he ducked his head under the blankets as well to meet Tony's face.
"Not a problem, Tony..." Steve whispered back, continuing to soothe and waiting to hear Tony softly snoring once more before falling back into sleep of his own.
"No kidding. To put it in terms for Steve, the place would probably look like a painting by Jackson Pollock." Bucky chuckled, Steve giving him a playful punch in the arm.
"Yeah, Peter. You didn't even get to really eat your lunch. You've gotta be hungry, bubba." Steve said softly, heading towards the kitchen. "I'll warm up some macaroni for us, all right?"
Tony reached a hand up into Steve's hair, kissing his cheek before moving faster, reaching down to pump Steve in time with his thrusts.
He grinned and had Steve sit up, pushing him against the headboard so his legs went over his shoulders.
"I have an idea of it," she hummed, a tiny smile on her lips, "But, to finish this little shindig--"
"I feel the same. Just after my growth spurt." Steve chuckled, sighing softly. "But you do make me feel younger. Makes me feel like I'm almost twenty years younger."
"Already breaking out the coffee? And it’s not even seven." He smirked, kissing Tony's cheek before getting out the pasta sauce.
"We'll see about that, Mr. 'I can't run five feet without something giving out.'" He teased, kissing the tip of Tony's nose.
"Once again, I can't wait." Steve hummed sweetly, getting them on the bike and ready to go. "No doubt it will be better than the movie was."
He saw the object floating down heavily into the water. It was the size and shape of a human. He knew humans couldn't breath underwater like he and his people could, so Steve went swimming up in hopes of saving it before something bad happened. When he grabs onto the "human", it feels different. It was made of a harder material and had a brilliant blue glow coming from the middle of the upper body. And it was extremely heavy.
"He probably thought Tony needed to actually talk to someone and that you needed to get laid." Clint said bluntly, Natasha smacking him as he took a drink.
"Okay, okay. Don't gotta beg me. You know too well how to use those eyes to your advantage, and you know it." Tony smirked gently, letting himself lay back on the bed similar to how Steve had been. He unbuckled his pants to shimmy out of them, tossing those and his undergarments off the bed and leaving himself bear for the merman.
"I really don't want to work today, but I know I have to," he grumbled, putting his head on the table, "I hate deadlines."
"Mmm, I know you do, baby," Tony breathed, ducking his face into Steve's neck, "I love it, too-- God, we should get your officer uniform out again--"
"As long as you're okay with it. But still let me know, okay?" He hummed, stroking Tony's hand softly.
"Don't worry, Peter. We'll make it quick, okay? Then we'll get you in your duckie pajamas." Steve hummed, heading upstairs.
Steve smooched his forehead, looking to both brunets. "I think some apologies would be nice from you both, don't you think?"
Steve nodded in understanding then looked back down at Tony. With the look on Tony's face it was easy to tell that he had been exhausted, but at the same time he looked so tranquil and at peace. Steve took in every aspect of the expression. He could use this for the next part of his project.
He trooped to the basement to grab supplies before two cups of coffee for both of them, carefully taking the stairs up to the studio.
Tony smirked, shaking his head with a small chuckle. Thanks to the camera in the face plate, he knew where it was. He just wanted to ruffle Steve's scales a little.
the fucking thing and I have to start all over and-- fuck, it's just annoying," Tony muttered, "Felt good to shout, though."
"We'll get you comfy at home, munchkin. And we'll sleep." The blond hummed as they headed out to the car. "I already threw away the shrimp and things, too, okay?"
"Fine. Then I won’t tell how good I still feel from what you did to me." Steve smirked, buckling his jeans and throwing on a plain t-shirt as he hummed a tune.
He scooped Peter up and they started heading back to the boy's room. "But you had a good day, didn't you? Had a good Christmas, little bear?"
Tony quickly made up a tiny platter of carrots and grabbed a little yogurt with a spoon, bringing it back to the bedroom.
"I--" Tony took a breath, sadly looking at the couch. "I didn't want you to know. I didn't want you to worry any more than you already do and
Steve bucked up into Tony's hand, head falling back onto the headboard. He started to breathe a tad bit heavier, mostly from trying to stay silent. All Steve
Tony gasped, shyly nuzzling at Steve's collar. "Please Sir, I need y'thick cock in me," he whined, "I've been so bad lately, need you--"
"Hey now. Cookies are meant to be eaten, not thrown. I thought we learned that in kindergarten?" Steve chuckled, kissing Tony's head.
"That's it, Stevie. Just like that. Work with what makes you feel good. Chase that feeling, okay?" Tony encouraged, helping guide Steve until there was a consistent pace and an equally consistent amount of soft moans of pleasure leaving the blond's lips.
"Are you sure she'll like me? We haven't even invited her over yet and I'm nervous about meeting her."
"There's mistletoe over our bed, sweetheart," Tony murmured, trailing his fingers up underneath Steve's shirt again, "I'd be more than happy to drag you away, if you want."
Tony waved at the baby as they left, quickly stepping in front of Peter to close his door, turning around with his arms crossed.
"Unless the murderer somehow managed to do it without touching the ground?" Steve queried. "Or he is extremely excellent at hiding his tracks. I vote for the later."
"I would never introduce you to something that could hurt you Steve. I promise." He assured, hearing the doorbell soon after. "And that would be the pizza! Good, I'm starving, aren't you? We can visit them again tomorrow. Now we eat!"
"No, no, life's not bad, I've-- I've never had a better family, but Steve, I have a photographic memory," Tony replied in a cracked voice, gently scooping up Peter and cuddling him close, hoping to soothe his anxiety, "I can tell every time-- every single thing that happened to me since I was five years old. I can tell you in
With great effort, he managed to get to the couch, laying out the blanket first so he wouldn't bleed into the furniture. Steve still had concern baked into his expression as he stood by the couch.
Steve grinned at her, nodding softly. "That there is Peter, he's our oldest. And our newest addition here is Samuel. He just two days old." He said fondly.
Tony hummed appreciatively, relishing in Steve's cock nudging the back of his throat. He scraped his teeth down his length when he pulled off, slipping his tongue into the slit before grinning up at Steve.
"It’s very nice to meet you, Ms. Carter." Steve said with a grin. "We've been excited to meet you since we got the call."
Tony laughed, skipping over to Steve to press a kiss to his cheek and gently rest a hand on his lower back.
'Thank you, JARVIS.' The blond beamed, thinking about what all he could attempt. 'Say, do you know any easy recipes that can also be considered for special occasion?'
"I know, I know. You get babied for a little bit, breakfast and lunch and dinner in bed--I can give you a massage, if you want. It helps," Tony murmured, hand immediately going in to stroke Steve's hair, "You sure you're okay?"
"Oh, honey, it's your fever," Tony murmured, petting his hair, "Just gotta wait for it to break, love."
"Well, it was always one of those things where when you find out that you do have a soulmate somewhere, you wonder what they're going to be like." He hummed softly.
"He said I was dumb f'having two daddies. Dat's what he really likes to pick on me for," Peter's lip wobbled slightly, "He said havin' two daddies wuz w
"Well," he started, " that thing a minute ago was sort of what I wanted to talk about...". Steve's face started to turn a bashful red. "I mean, now I have had some time to think about it, but I still wasn't for sure on a way of putting it out there. I just kind of... reacted...".
“Well, teddy bear's don't make good officers, and by the look of the clock--" Tony laughed, a dopey smile on his face, "--I think you're runnin' a bit late."
"Gra'ma was a nurse?" Peter spoke around his toothbrush, looking at Steve through the mirror, "Can she take care'a Daddy?"
The boy scrunched his nose up and made a face, to which Tony made the face back until he could smell the coffee.
“U? What do have there, sweetie?” Tony asked, carefully moving U’s tail out of the way before he stopped and froze for a moment.
"Buddy, I was just playing, okay? I'm sorry, don't cry." Steve said softly, kneeling in front of the boy and wiping his tears. "You don't have to worry about any of that for a
"Awwwe, bambi, such a sweetie," Tony hummed, pressing a grateful kiss to his forehead, "Love you too, munchkin. Thank you."
"Are you and Daddy gonna have a baby?" He asked innocently, patting Steve's stomach through the blanket, "You's biggah dan usual, Papa."
"Oh. That." Steve murmured quietly. "It’s not that big of a deal, really. I'm just... self-conscious about it."
"He can start to eat better too, once the Doc gives us the go-ahead," he mused, "No more formula for this one."
"Tony, you didn't have to do that. But that was...wow." He stated, completely awestruck at all the righteous fury just exuding from Tony.
He locked himself in the bedroom, turning to face the floor-to-ceiling mirror. Slowly, he stripped himself down to his boxers, gently removed the bandage from his chest and arm. Tony didn't sigh at the scars, but rather, ran his hand over them, feeling the hardened skin under the pads of his fingers. With a hum, Tony threw the bandages away, putting jeans and a wife-beater back on; he could do this. He could show his scars.
"Soulmates? Dere's no'ting left of dem," Peter gasped, looking up at Steve with wide eyes, "M'teacha used t'say dat all deh soulmates were
"He's a kid after my own heart," Tony laughed, picking out another blueberry, "And I eat plenty of fruits, fussy pants. I quite like raspberries and blackberries."
He pulled the plug out and slipped the vibrator in, making sure it was in snug before flicking it on. Steve made a happy, high-pitched hum when the vibrator started, small waves of pleasure thrumming softly up his spine. He laid his face against the blankets on the bed, letting himself enjoy the feeling.
"I think I'll wait for that when you least expect it. That way, I have an advantage," he said playfully.
Steve hummed lightly at that, reaching over to cup Tony's cheek and kissing his lips gently. "I love you. You always make me so happy." He whispered with a smile, booping their noses together.
of us time. I don't like this whole taking-ten-minutes-to-get-prepped thing. I want you nice and loose at the end of our two hours."
"Mm. Maybe one day," Tony replied quietly, closing his eyes to stop himself from leaning into Steve's touch, "I just.... don't feel it, Steve. Don't feel worthy of it. You know that."
Steve shook his head. "Course not. Just think it be nice to have some time to be intimate without getting sweaty and covered in come." He explained. "The sex is great, not going to lie, but it'd be nice just to be together."
"Right. We don't actually have to do much of anything with it, if you don't want. Not right away. I just--the ring makes you mine. Completely. It's cheesy as hell but..." Tony trailed off, nibbling his lip. "...Sometimes I need the reminder," he finished quietly.
The baby took the teether happily, chewing on it like crazy as they headed towards the kitchen for his breakfast.
"I don't know what to do about him acting out, either. It's not okay for him to be like that, but we can't let him get away with it-- I think we should pull him out of school, homeschool him and give him an after school activity."
Steve flinched softly at the smack, a twitch of a smirk on his lips as he headed into the bathroom to clean up.
It was a pattern; Change, show, repeat. Steve would step out and show Tony, trying not to flush from the other's eyes on him and smile in reaction. He would ask him how the clothes felt on his skin, if he could move well in them, and even turn arounds for a full look before either OK'ing or denying an outfit. There were far more yeses than no's, so the blond assumed that was a good thing.
"I have a beard, I know what it's like," Tony laughed, reaching over to help Peter cut up his shrimp, "It's not that bad once you get it to a good trimming length. Just gotta wait it out."
The blond watched with a warm smile, trying not to tear up because he was both proud and witnessing the cutest thing he'd ever seen.
Steve got out of bed and scooped Peter up, carrying him downstairs to the kitchen. Peter grinned as he was carried, pressing a kiss to Steve's cheek.
Steve snapped out of his thoughts when he saw the man start to stir. He knew he couldn't let the human see him. He had to leave fast, before the man's eyes opened. Steve quickly grabbed onto the armor face that had broken off and darted into the water, just as the man started to open his eyes. Steve swam behind a cluster of rocks and kept an eye on the man's actions when he fully regained consciousness.
"Didn't-- wanted to save your hands for this," Tony groaned, slightly widening his stance, "Please-- babe--"
"Well, since you asked so nicely." Steve said, rolling his eyes with a gentle smirk. He slinked down Tony's body, tugging down Tony's sweats as he went. He brushed his lips gently against the brunet's cock before taking the tip in his mouth and suckling softly.
Steve cleared his throat nervously, looking at the two of them. "I'm gonna go change and then we can head out, Petey, okay?" He said quickly, heading out of the room to go change.
"Mmm, well, that part isn't until later, and you'll see why," Tony replied softly, gently necking Steve, "I'd rather let tensions out, if that's okay. Instead of hopping into bed."
"Of course you won't. We'll make sure you won't, sweetheart--" he purred, kissing at the back of Tony's neck as he tied off in a neat little ribbon.
"Alright Pete, we gotta give Sammy back to Ms. Sharon for the night," Tony hummed, taking the baby into his arms so Peter could get down, "We'll come and get him first thing tomorrow, okay?"
"I don't think you will have to worry about that. He's probably thinking the same thing you are. If that's the case, you have to test the waters. Or if you wanna be bolder, trying acknowledging it by placing it in conversation.".
Tony raised himself on tiptoes to reach Steve’s cheek and gave a light kiss on it. “I do.” He whispered. “But unfortunately, I know we have to go.”
“Nobody did. When the public started to wonder where I was, Obie told them I was taking some time off, because I worked too hard in the last time.”
“Maybe. Tony has been trying more and more to go his own way. Well, he used to, before the abduction. Now, the only thing he does out of his free will is his prosthetics program, which Obadiah allowed just because it’s for his PhD.” She took a sip out of her coffee, that after the look on her face, most definitely was already cold.
“You were fifteen when you hit on me.” She laughed. “I was nineteen. That’s a crime. You were cute, though but not in the way you are now. It was the kind of ‘oh little genius boy is walking around with the big boys’ You were sweetly pathetic. Is that combination even possible? Now you’re really sweet and handsome… a little bit grown-up.”
Second of all, let me explain. I worked the whole summer full-time and I had to repass a few exams on top of that, I only had a single week of holiday which I spent abroad with friends so I hadn't even my laptop with me.
Tony sighed, his eyes showed a sadness he was hiding deep down inside of him. “I would rather not go into public, not because of you, well partly. First of all, those reporters are going to kill me and when you’re there they will freak you out and then you’re gone before anything even started.” He scratched his head with his hand full of grease, but he didn’t even care. “And I don’t want to be the reason why you’re feeling uncomfortable in the army. I know those guys, and I understand why you keep in the closet while you’re there. So, I’d rather not go out with you… Not now.”
“Well…” Steve wanted to play it down and not make Tony feel bad about his behavior yesterday, especially since it ended with both of them falling asleep together. But he decided against it, he backed down yesterday for the ‘greater good’ and if he wanted it to work between them he would have to show Tony when he was crossing lines. “Yeah. Yeah, you would have, your bad.”
“You did see the big glass wall?” Tony asked. “Obviously it’s not just glass, but you can totally talk to him without going inside.”
Steve sighed. “You know how crazy it is, that you believe I’m just a hallucination before you think it is actually me?” Tony blinked a few times.
Steve sighed and laid his head back on the headrest, staring on the ceiling. He felt like talking to a five-year-old for the last two weeks. “Let’s put it in numbers, that’s your thing, right? Chances that you’re dying lay by a 100% within the next max of two years without operation. Chances of you dying with the operation are around 40%, that’s what Dr. Yinsen said at least. Do the numbers Tony.”
“It happened a week ago, okay? I didn’t plan to throw myself into the next thing just after Pepper, but it is how it is, Steve’s a great guy, the best. I want Steve to be happy. Yes, Barnes killed my parents, but he spared Steve. He went to Sam’s apartment out of his free will. He didn’t refuse to come back here. He collaborated, well knowing that it might be the end of his life… For the moment being, I’m ready to give him some credit. And if you can’t, you’re free to go, although it would be much easier with your help.”
Tony grinned but before he could answer, the door was torn open and no other but Obadiah Stane stormed in. “What the hell do you think, you’re doing?” He demanded to know.
Steve shot him a glance. “Lesson one. You shut your mouth until I’m done! And then you go down to Bucky, and try to get something out of him, anything. Get him to talk.”
Bucky was also the reason he was in Boston right now. The army granted him a second month leave. He asked for it, after his friend told him about this new project. He would get a robotic arm, financed by the army and produced by Stark Industries. He didn’t want to count that as a win, since Bucky lost his limb but this was the best ending they could have wished for.
“Yep. Rhodey told his general who let Rhodey pick out the guys he wanted for that mission. They were thirty or something. The soldiers that got away from the attack on the convoy were sworn to silence. But that’s why Rhodey is so pissed at me. He saved me, and I’m throwing his gift away.”
“What he said.” Pepper answered. “But, honestly… it’s a really long story, but yes Rhodey and I pretty much hate him. For what he always did but especially when he tried to talk Howard into stopping to look for Tony when he was kidnapped in Afghanistan.”
“We don’t know that Tony, and he did not know his name… HYDRA did something to him… Something is wrong.” Tony swallowed and kept quiet until they were at the hiding place, where Fury awaited them. Tony disappeared and Steve hated the fact, that he could not run after him. Now, it was more important to get the information he needed to take HYDRA and with that, SHIELD down.
She crossed her legs and looked at him for the first time. She frowned when she saw his red face and the swollen eyes. “Are you alright? Did something happen? Did Steve?” Her mother hen characteristic came up within seconds.
Tony stayed silent for a couple of seconds. “I don’t think it comes from trauma… I mean ‘Stark men are made of iron’ is kinda stuck with me forever, but I was a genius, rich kid that was a lot younger than the other kids in school, so I had to hide from bullies. I tried to hide from myself, when my parents died. I didn’t want to admit to myself that I was hurt. Then there was press everywhere and every time. You can’t survive if you show them to much of yourself. I was kidnapped and tortured, one of my oldest friends tried to kill me, multiple times… I can’t show my enemies how I feel, that gives them even more power over me, you know that… I think that's the reason, I'm not sure.” He sighed.
Bucky raised an eyebrow. “It’s you, or not? I remember how in the morning he stood there, little Stevie right in front of you…”
“Yes.” Steve grinned for a moment. “You don’t like him. Rhodey doesn’t either or am I getting the wrong impression?”
Howard Stark nodded too.“Alright, have a good day. See you, Captain.” Obadiah completely ignored them, when they walked off.
Pepper got up fast enough. “No, thanks. I have some meetings.” She turned back to Tony. “Again. I’m sorry. If you need anything, call me, and Rhodey or Happy. Keep me updated.” She was out of the room before the men could say another word.
The only answer he got at first was the sound of the television. He heard how Tony tried to breath calmly as if he would disappear when he was just silent enough. Steve gave him time, knowing what Tony had already been through, it probably wasn’t the nicest story. And nobody could force him to tell it.
“He has a lead to a terrorist’s organization, and that’s all he told me, promise. I’m pretty sure I don’t want any details, I worry enough about Tony, no need to put another one in the mix. It’s enough he’s back down there.”
“Thanks, I appreciate your try to uplift me, but compared to you, I’m a complete douchebag.” Steve laughed.
“I know.” Steve let out a breath. “I hate that.” He stared back into the direction the ambulance disappeared into and wondered if Tony would be alright. He was dead for a couple of minutes. This clearly could happen again, right? He needed to know, if Tony was okay. Stark Industries had contacts to the military, he would find out about Tony’s well-being, maybe Bucky would know something.
Steve shook his head. “Pepper came in first, after that, Bucky, Nat and Clint should have been here. I don’t know exactly, after Dr. Yinsen told us you were alright, I took some fresh air and let the others come in first.”
A tear dropped out of Tony’s eye but he smiled it away. “So, you want pizza or Chinese take-out for lunch?” He asked.
“It’s because of you.” Tony called after him. “Whenever you’re there…” He sighed deeply, and Steve turned back around to see him get up. “I never feel this comfortable with anyone, ever. It took me a long while with Pepper and Rhodey, to fully trust them. Natasha wiggled her way into my heart, and she worked hard to get me to trust her, and Bucky and I… We just understood each other because we had similar experiences. For everybody else…”
The last new face he met was Bruce. At the beginning their conversation was pretty awkward because the second genius in the room felt rather out of place. He was definitely not a crowd person, pretty shy and silent. But when Steve managed to get words out of him, he knew instantly what a brilliant man was behind those glasses.
It killed him not to ask, not to explain how he himself felt. How it was crazy to think that his best friend, his brother, was still alive, after believing he was dead. But Tony must feel miserable. He believed for over twenty years, that his parents died dramatically in a car crash and now… chances were high they were killed by the Winter Soldier, probably brutally and without mercy. Steve refused to call the assassin Bucky, because it was not him. The man he was, did not know who he was. Bucky would never kill innocent people and surely not Howard.
“How are you still alive?” Steve had whispered, after he had stayed silent for an awfully long time. Later, it had taken a lot of effort from Tony and his friends to calm him down, which he still hadn’t. Probably because it wasn’t right in Steve’s mind how a young guy could end up in this position.
Tony laughed, putting a hand on his face as he passed his phone to Steve, showing him Peter's browsing history.
it to be," Tony murmured, "I'm having an urge to buy you more pretty things. Y'know, I might have to steal another closet in this house just for your pretty things. Whaddya think?"
"Hey you, don't eat your fingers," Tony laughed, pulling Peter's thumb from his mouth, "Want me to get your binky to chew on?"
"Uh huh," Peter giggled, hugging Tony's legs back before scooping up his backpack to dash off for the car.
"Yeah, love?" Tony called. He gave Steve a quick kiss before the door opened, smiling fondly at his little boy. "What's up, pipsqueak? Blow something up?"
"Yeah, yeah. I think I do that just because I have a soft spot for you." Steve teased sweetly, kissing Tony back happily as they settled together. "I love you,
"I hope Peter does keep an eye on Little Bit. Help the others with certain things." Steve sighed nervously, picking Sammy up.
"Everyone else's sleeping, right?" Tony murmured, gently pushing Steve back towards their room, "Then yes, definitely, need to warm up--"
"Alright, Scuba Steve. Time to head to the living room." Tony spoke, offering Steve his hand to take as he led the other out and back to the couch.
"I don't mind that. Rest is always good." Steve added, laying back in the bed as he continued to pet Tony's hair. "You could use it since you're used to working late."
"You know you love it, pipsqueak," Tony laughed, getting off the floor and dusting off his jeans, "You
"You don't wanna get into the biting game with me, Stark-Rogers," Tony warned, "I will very much win."
"He's willing to help those close to him whenever and wherever they need it without a second thought." Bucky added.
"Yeah, mhm," Peter rolled his eyes and set his empty bowl aside, standing up on the couch to reach out.
"Good. I want to spend a week just cuddling with you, zero clothes, zero responsibility, just you and me and the moonlight," Tony breathed, ghosting his lips over Steve's, "Whaddya say?"
Peter froze and held his hand up, counting down from three before pointing at the door, watching Tony walk in the room. The brunet stopped and looked around, raising an eyebrow at Steve.
"You and that outfit." Steve said jokingly, shivering slightly at Tony's feet. "But yeah, Bruce and Clint seem cool. And they all seem to be there for you, so that's all I could ask for."
"Exactly. He always knows." Steve agreed, wiping some sauce off of Peter's face. "So you gotta be sure to sleep through the night."
That brought Steve completely over the edge, the volume of his cries uninhibited as he called his lover's name over and over in pure pleasure. Trying to not collapse on Steve's chest, Tony barely held himself upright as Steve tightened around him. He sucked in a breath as he came, burying himself up to the hilt in Steve before letting the euphoria wash over him.
"Yeah, you need a nap," Tony snorted, wrapping his arms around Peter before leaning up, "I'll tuck you in, and come get you in a bit."
"Bucky yelled at me," Tony griped, grabbing his favorite blanket off the bed and wrapping it around himself, "I had a rom-com moment and decided to run through a lightning storm to come confess my love, and now I probably have pneumonia, but that's okay."
"I will be, I swear--" Steve hummed, keeping him hugged close and kissing at the top of his head. "I'll always be here. Cross my heart."
"I can't wait. And I shall attempt to do the same for you." Steve grinned before heading back to his own apartment, humming happily.
"Oh my god, save the singing for pipsqueak, I'll fall asleep," Tony laughed, careful to keep his voice down, "You're such a sap, Stark-Rogers."
Tony cupped Peter's cheek and kissed his temple again, rubbing his back as he brushed the last of his tears away.
“You and Tony finally announcing that you’re boning so we don’t have to deal with all your UST anymore?” Clint asked with a smirk, earning him awkward noises from Steve and a warning look from Natasha.
"Yeah, well I used to not be. In fact, I was completely confused when I got my tattoo." He replied, glancing down at Tony. "I was so skinny and short, it was terrible. Then my tattoo appeared and I couldn't think why anyone would call me handsome. Thankfully, puberty eventually contributed." He chuckled soft.
He leaning up to lick and bite at Steve's soulmate tattoo, trailing his tongue down to the blond's nipple. Steve let out a small groan as Tony worked at his chest, moving a hand up to rake through his husband's hair.
He was joking of course, Tony laughed silently, shaking his head, but Steve still thought it was a little morbid, maybe because Tony had in fact nearly died a couple of times.
“Can you give me something to sleep?” He asked, knowing he wouldn’t calm down if he wouldn’t fall asleep, and he wouldn’t fall asleep without calming down, which was only possible by giving him drugs.
“Don’t you think the first important thing is that he will live? And not Bucky?” Sam’s laugh disappeared.
“Mh, I thought I dreamed about Pepper, maybe I really talked to her.” He sighed and looked around his room. His eyes fell on the flowers on his right sight. “Are those from you?” Tony whispered.
“What you’re doing?” Steve asked laying down on bed next to Tony late that night. The billionaire was still tapping on his laptop.
“He said, a few months until they’ve repaired your cardiac defect. I thought about learning myself some cooking skills, we will be fine.” He scrunched his nose. “Maybe not the first week or two, but after. I won’t poison you.”
That had been enough to convince Bruce. Tony didn’t know what suddenly caused the trust of the doctor, but he was fine to go along with it. He should have known Bruce wouldn’t just accept that.
It worked pretty well. When the two men were alone again, they were still casually chattering. Tony was relaxed, lying on the couch, nearly falling asleep, when he finished explaining to Steve how he preferred the motor of the Porsche over the last Audi, but that in the end the Audi was still better.
He shook his head a few times. A little smile coming up on his lips. "Actually, it does, Tony… I cannot ask you for forgiveness in Bucky’s name. I won’t do that. You decided to let him go. Once again you proved me wrong. I was sure you would kill him, the moment you saw him. A 100%, no doubt there... And then you... you're perf..." He stopped himself.
To concentrate on other things and let the time pass until the genius would wake up, he took the sketch block out of his bag and continued the drawing he had started two days ago. He drew it out of a memory he had from last year Christmas where he had been away from home in Iran. His first Christmas without either his mom or Bucky and he had been very miserable.
That’s why Bucky was here, Steve was confused at first, since Stark Industries headquarters were in New York, but Bucky explained him, that it was Howard Stark’s son building the prosthesis for his second doctor’s degree. Steve knew the name Tony Stark Nobody didn’t know the genius. He was still impressed. He had thought the boy was a lot younger than him, but apparently, he wasn’t, or how could he be doing his second doctorate program?
Bucky frowned and thought about an idea while sipping on his coffee. “Let me think, he is a genius, but still 20 years old, so…”
Steve got up from the bed and held out a hand to pull Tony up. “Says the man that didn’t want to put on a sweater because it’s August.” He rolled his eyes, but the grin on his face just wouldn’t disappear and all of sudden Steve knew why he fell in love with Tony. He finally was himself. He felt like Steve Rogers again.
Pepper shrugged yet again. “We know something is off, but Tony refuses to talk about it and the terrorists that kept him there, either fled or got a bullet in the head, most of them from Rhodey…”
They had played three rounds, Tony winning all of them, although he really had tried to let Steve win the last round. However, he underestimated the soldier. He recognized Tony’s tricking within three plays and shot him a glance. “No need for pity. Give me your best.” He had told the genius, so Tony won the last round too.
Tony looked up, smiled a second and looked back down. “Flirty, but it’s not your best task… Isn’t even necessary since I’ve already fallen for you.”
A whole week passed without even as much as a little change in Howard Stark’s condition, but Steve worried less and less about the older Stark and more and more about his son. Dr. Yinsen wanted to operate him next week, and Tony refused to be under anesthetic with the risk of dying while his father was out. His trust in Obadiah slowly began to fall apart.
Tony sighed. “Can we go back to talk about my parents? I’m afraid you’re going all Winter Soldier on me if we keep on talking about Steve.”
Tony grinned up at him. “Take care, Cap. I’m not burying the national icon.” Tony reached out his hand to say goodbye, but it was not enough for Steve. He was not feeling so well about the situation. He grabbed the man’s hand and pulled him against his chest.
“Why can I see your ribs?” Steve asked calmly. The man shrugged and pulled, without further whining, his hoodie over his head. “Tony, I’m so not letting you out of here without any explanation.”
Bucky and Steve had been talking while Tony had been silently working on some adjustments. It wasn’t the same silence as yesterday. He smiled and murmured to himself. It felt way more relaxed then yesterday.
“Okay.” Steve answered and restrained himself from his tears. They would see each other again, wouldn’t they?
Bruce blinked a few times, clearly not following what Tony was implying, and surely, he didn’t understand for who the Hulk room was needed. “Did you put Cap into the safe room?!” He asked because that seemed to be the only solution. “Did you guys fight again? You need to get your shit together, so we can work as a team. We were lucky last time, but we won’t be every time.”
“I’m sure you reached a stage, where your body doesn’t even know how to tell you he needs food. I understand that you don’t want to, but you need it. Please Tony, do it for me, okay?”
“You’re gonna tell me what James told you that made you so depressed?” Tony changed the subject while leading the way back upstairs.
“I trust you, Tony.” Steve told him that night after he had taken the decision. “You trusted me the last weeks and followed my lead personally and on the mission. I’m working on myself, I have problems when it comes to trusting people, but I can do that with you. You think I can’t do my work properly, that’s fine, I know you have my back.”
“And that’s my personal paradise.” He ended the room tour down in the garage. Steve had been blown away by the fact that his bedroom was probably five times as big as the one he had in Brooklyn and that he had his own bathroom, but this… This was so much more, and he felt as if Tony had just given him the keys to his heart.
"So if you want to do that, we can set you for that, Peter." Steve soothed. "But either way, I am still going to tell your teacher about Flash so we can save another from getting picked on."
"Well, we have our itinerary. Let’s get started." Steve grinned, smooching the boy's hair as they headed towards the room.
"Cibé rud a dúirt tú go raibh go hálainn ... Tá do guth ceol binn." He whispered sweetly. "Is breá liom tú le mo chroí go, Tony. Tá tú go deo ann, nasctha le dom, croí agus anam."
"God, I love you," Tony breathed, gently stroking at the hairs at the nape of Steve's neck, "More than anything. You're
"Yeah, we're trying to have a good time, not get tipsy at dinner." Bucky stated, watching Clint as he poured the glasses.
Steve smirked over at Tony playfully, getting up to come and kiss his cheek real fast. "Go ahead and head on up to the bedroom and I'll meet you up there in a few minutes, alright?"
He turned his head and stared sadly at the wall before getting up, muttering and locking himself in the bathroom, running the faucet hot.
"Thank God." Steve breathed, leaning down and kissing at Tony's face as he tried to calm a little. "I do think we are soulmates. Our marks are so specific. And I felt it. When we first made physical contact, just the brush of our hands. The connection, I felt it." He whispered softly into Tony's hair.
They took the convertible, Tony had decided, pleased to see the joy on Steve's face from the speed and wind in his hair. That smile was simply infectious, and Tony was so glad he could help make a reason for it.
He arrived in front of the dorm and rapidly knocked on the door. He was a little surprised to see Bruce at the door, and apparently Bruce was surprised to see Steve as well.
"I haven't told you?" Tony paused, then shrugged. "I should probably tell you now. Before I'm too conscious and shy away."
"He found screamo music, Steve," Tony wheezed, having to put his hands on his knees to keep himself upright, "He legitimately googled 'adults yelling' and got to rock music."
"Alright you, swallow what's in your mouth and go brush your teeth," Tony laughed, taking his plate from Steve.
"That's what sharks eat. It helps keep the food web balanced." Steve explained softly. "There are plenty of fish in the waters to live on and feed the sharks. It keeps the sharks alive."
"Jay, tell Steve and the boys I'll get it," Tony called, stripping off his mask and covering his arms with metalworking gloves before getting up.
"You'd look real pretty with a huge dildo up your ass, tearing you apart, don't you think?" He asked casually, "Nipple clamps, cock cage, whole shabam. See how far I can push this body of yours."
"I wouldn't doubt it. The food coma is a powerful thing." Steve laughed, setting everything left on table.
Taking off his headphones, Tony stripped off his gloves and picked the squirt up, setting him on his hip.
"I might just take you up on that. I'll probably have my father/son day with Peter tomorrow then." Steve hummed softly as he washed himself off. "Then I can spend the day with you today and I'll have time with both my favorite boys."
"Ah, please, come in, I'll go get him," Tony offered, heart sinking at the possibility that Steve was having an affair.
," Tony grinned, kissing up Steve's neck, "Been such a naughty boy lately--" He left bites down Steve's jaw, drawing him in for a lazy kiss.
Tony sat up and bit his lip in faux nervousness, straddling Steve and putting his hands on his chest.
"Be good for your aunt and uncles," He told them, smooching Peter's cheek, "And no shrimps for you, young man."
"Well, a couple things. I gotta find it though," Tony hummed, carefully sitting up with a groan, "Oh god, I'm going to be so fucking
"That's what babies do, honey," he sighed, "They need a lot of attention because they can't do much for themselves. I'll make sure that Papa spends more time with you, okay? I'll try to work from home more, and take care of Sammy so you two can spend time together, okay?"
"All right. You've earned it, I believe." He hummed, going off to find the lube and coming back to Tony. Steve helped the man stand to get his pants and boxers off, having him kneel again when they were out of the way. "Now, I'm still going to go nice and slow with you, alright?"
"Well, you're sitting. I meant waiting until your ass throbs," Tony laughed before taking the lingerie from Steve, tossing it in the hamper.
Steve grinned over at Tony, wrapping an arm around his shoulders. "I can't take all the credit for sneaking it past you. I had the idea but called up Clint and Natasha to help with the setup. They're quick and quiet and that's just what was needed." He grinned.
remember you telling me you don't have allergies," Tony quipped back, gingerly stepping out of the tub, "No noises, mister. I'm gonna get dressed and make the bed up with winter sheets to keep you warm."
"You said it’s your fault. How?" He asked carefully. "What did you do that it was your fault? What happened, Tony?"
Steve hummed back in appreciation of the praise, leaning with the touch and taking Tony down further. He ran his tongue along the underside and started to bob his head slowly.
Steve continued to nibble, biting away at the parts not covering Tony's current half-erection. He honestly liked getting to play and tease Tony just a little. Never had the time to anymore.
"Why don't you let me know what is and isn't allowed then, baby--?" Steve hummed, slowly slipping a finger in.
"Pete--" Steve said softly, looking a bit distraught. "Never, ever think that I don't love you so much, munchkin. You are so important to me and I love you very much, son."
He watched Tony anxiously and hard as he slicked up his fingers. "Please..." the blond spoke quietly, “Please...”
"You're not too bad yourself, y'know. I mean, your eyes are crazy gorgeous. And the angles of your face, the way the light hits them-- Could I draw you sometime?" He asked with an almost hopeful look.
"Where are you going?" Clint asked, confused as Steve walked towards the door. Steve opened the door and turned back to Clint before leaving.
"We should get a dog." Tony paused. "Or a cat. Like, since children are really far off, puppies are good for coddling, right? Or cats. Cats can be nasty things, though. No turtles--or snakes. Maybe hamsters, but only if it's really cute--"
"Shhh, let’s not talk about it," Tony murmured, smooching Steve's chest, "Don't let it bother you, love. Besides, you already got the best soulmate
"Now Daddy, don't pick on poor Petey. We aren't allowed to tease him about girlfriends or boyfriends yet," Steve cooed, smooching at Peter's red face. "We can pick on him about it tomorrow."
"I--Flash only bullies me b'tween classes an' at recess, an' if it’s in class it's spitballs an' stuff," Peter hiccupped, "The teacha' doesn' know."
"Maybe awkward isn't quite the word to describe how I feel, I guess. I still just blush." He hummed, tilting his neck slightly. "We should probably hide these presents, huh?"
Steve stared at Tony with utter shock on his face. He never saw Tony like this, never thought he was even capable of such things. Tony looked nearly broken, as if he would shatter at the slightest breeze. It hurt Steve to see him like this.
"All right, come here Super Peter." Steve said as he knelt, helping slip on the clothes. "Undies, pants, and then shirt. Got it?"
He pulled away from Steve and crossed his arms, determined to get through the movie without screaming. Or crying. Again.
Tony mentally shook his head. Those were thoughts to think and worry about later. He should enjoy this now, this companionship while he had it before he managed to push it away somehow. For once, he needed to just try and be in the here and now, if only for a little while.
"Uh--" Tony started, a flush forming on the back of his neck from what he could feel "I mean, not officially? What we're doing is typical of people dating, so if you want to be dating, we can be. If you want. I'm not going to pressure you."
"Here we go..." Steve hummed, building almost a nest around them in blankets. He cuddled carefully around Tony, just letting him cry and shedding a few tears himself. Steve felt for him. The best thing that they could do for now was just give time to let Tony grieve.
"And that’s just fine that he is interested in the science and technology like you." Steve explained. "It just-- the way you worded it. It makes me feel like what I am teaching to Peter is a complete waste of time..." He murmured, turning to look back at the baby.
"You.....you cheeseball. That's literally all I can say," Tony sighed, smooching Steve back, "Alright. We can do this. I think. I hope. Stats aren't looking good, but the Stark's have a way with odds." He smiled, one of the first real ones in the past days, burying himself in Steve's warm chest.
Steve moaned quietly as Tony rode him slowly, trying to stay quiet so they didn't wake the boys. "Been busy for a while."
"He was made to help around with different tasks around the workshop. I won first place with him in the contest, and I remember how proud my mother was. I could tell she was truly proud of me. That smile kept me going on to create some of my other inventions...".
"And you doubted your fathering?" Steve hummed, wrapping arms around his waist. "You had practice since you were young and you doubted? You are such a good daddy, Tony." He hummed, nuzzling his neck.
"We'll have time for all of that, Tony. I promise." Steve said with a soft chuckle, kissing Tony softly. "We'll sort things tomorrow and we'll go whenever you want. I want to officially be yours. Officially be your cheeseball." He laughed. "Nothing would make me happier."
"I... I dunno," Tony shrugged, "I've tried everything, but my need for Howard's approval-- it's too set deep in me. I feel inadequate, and now that he's gone.... I can't ever hope to hear him say he's proud of me. And no matter how much support I have, I--I don't think it compares to that childlike desire."
"You love it, Rogers," Tony laughed, smiling happily at the room, "The en suite is amazing, huge jet tub. Could fit us and other people."
"Mmm, you might like them all. Depends on if your pain turns into pleasure," Tony replied, brushing his fingers against Steve's sweet spot, "I'd love to see you all shy and writhing on my desk."
Peter immediately perked up at the sound of that, starting to pull Steve along as they got closer to the park.
Tony purred happily, nuzzling up into the blond with a hum. He smooched Steve's neck, feeling his headache leave as the medicine kicked in.
"Hey, hey it was just a door, sweetie, it’s okay," Tony soothed, bouncing the baby, "You're okay, you're okay--"
Steve felt his phone buzz in his pocket, reading the text with a warm smile as he cleaned up the kitchen.
"Are you serious? Did you pull a freakin' 'Little Mermaid'? Steve, why would-- Look, we can figure this out when we get you inside and in some clothes." the genius explained in aggravation, helping the man on his feet. "Lets get you walking, huh?"
"Exactly what it sounds like, Pep. You've seen the movie right? Read the story?" He murmured, glancing over at Steve for a moment. "He was the one who pulled me out of the water when I was shot out of the sky. I know he doesn't look it, he looks a lot different than when I met him, but he's... He just wanted to see land. What it was like to be human."
"I think he's a restless one," Tony murmured, turning his head to the side, "He probably wants to toddle around. It'd do good to wear him out a little."
"It’s okay, bubba." Steve answered softly. He leaned down to kiss the boy's head and pet at his hair. "Do you want me to stay in here and read to you before bed?"
Peter squirmed out of Tony's arms and handed him the penguin, dashing off the find their bag of goodies. He returned with the hammerhead shark plushie in his hands, exchanging it for the penguin.
"You put up with me and I adore you, so yeah I 'put up with you'." Steve whispered, breathing Tony in and taking the man's other hand in his. "You are brilliant and charming and loving, and I wouldn't want you any other way."
," Tony laughed, quickly pumping his fingers in and out before adding a third one, "We've got precious time, sweetcheeks, and I intend to use it."
Peter furrowed his brow, looking at Steve. "But you's been with plenty a peoples. You's with us right now."
Steve looked around to make sure nobody paid attention to his out burst. He continued the conversation in a more hushed tone.
"Sammy's not diamonds, Petey." He explained to the boy. "But we say he's precious because-- and the same goes for you-- he is very special to us. Plus he is fragile and small and needs gentle touches."
Peter was already fast asleep between them, clearly worn out from his long day. "He was running around with some of my assistants," Tony whispered with a giggle, "Poor kids been playing all day, no wonder he's exhausted."
"That onesie is cute on him. Nice choice." He hummed, cooing at Sammy. "We'll let Peter rest, but not too long. He might get bad from us playing with the baby while he's sleeping."
"No, no, it's okay. Since I was little, I've had a benign tumor in the left lobe of my brain," Sharon explained, "The doctors figured it was so small, that it wasn't an issue. Eventually, it grew and became inoperable, but they still saw it posing no threat. However, it's starting to act up, and I'm starting to have slight bouts of memory loss. I've been started on some antibiotics, but in a few months, they suspect I'll have full-fledged Alzheimer’s."
'Hey, JARVIS?' Steve started, looking up towards the ceiling 'Tony said he would be home by dinner, right?'
"You're alright, it's just--" Tony closed his eyes for a second, waiting for the dizzy spell to pass. "We
"Ha, I guess you're right about that. I kind of sound like a Hallmark. But I do mean it completely. And I'll be happy to remind you whenever you need it." Steve said warmly, closing his eyes at the scratches. "I feel like a dog getting scratched behind the ears." He laughed. "It feels great.”
"Or else you get the Kissy Monster!" Steve laughed, kissing all over Peter's face with a monster growl.
Tony chuckled at the pet name, easily taking Steve down his throat. He nosed at the golden curls nestled at the top of his lover's groin, hollowing his cheeks before pulling off.
"Okay bubba. Let me get rolled over." He told the boy, scooping Sammy up before moving around to color with Peter.
Steve winced at digging fingers, but was moaning from the angle. It had Tony hitting his sweet spot almost every time. "
Steve's eyes seem to sparkle as he saw the blue light still shining from the man's chest. So it was a part of the man and not the armor? Did all humans have lights? What exactly was it for? So many questions Steve wanted to ask but couldn't, given his biological differences to humans. He wouldn't even be able to get anywhere without army crawling everywhere, and that gets exhausting after a while. So he had to settle with what he had for now. It wasn't much really, but it was more than he had before. Steve clutched onto his "souvenir" and swam back down into the waters, planning to add this new discovery to his collection.
"Yes, that mean you and your bubby, squirt." Steve laughed, smooching Sammy's head and then Tony's lips.
The third piece was more believable to him. The face on it scared Tony, but it was a face that seemed more accurate to himself. It was when he had snapped at Steve. The last impression he had let Steve see of him. The canvas was an intense red, the line work harsh and ragged. Some of the lines seem to drip downward, giving it a feeling of hurt.
"Then everybody wins." Steve laughed back. He sighed and laid back in the bed as he thought. "Not as much spoiling soon, though." He stated. "I have work the day after tomorrow."
"Love you. Man, I love you." He breathed back, pulling Tony into another kiss. He hummed against Tony's lips, threading his fingers through dark locks.
Even if it was only there a split second, Steve felt Tony harden against him before he scooted back.
"Speaking of being mature though, Daddy and I wanna talk to you about something important." He said softly, glancing over at Tony.
"Then brush now, silly," Tony laughed, pushing him towards the bathroom, "Your asshole boss can wait a bit. He might appreciate minty breath."
"Is it bad that we barter and stuff for when we want to have sex? Like-- I dunno, it feels weird to me."
"Me. I would have smelled it," Tony grumbled, kissing Steve's shoulder, "I trust it's good, tho-- hey!" He ran up to the bakery window, almost putting his hands on the glass.
"I'm talking about how you think of yourself as a hero. You are nowhere close to being a hero, especially without that suit."
"Already texted her," Tony laughed into his cup, putting his phone on the table, "She's meeting us there in two hours and some."
"Nah, just Peanut Butter. Goes best with pretzel." Steve grinned back, feeding the baby with one hand and eating his sandwich with the other. "Plus its less sticky."
"'Cause you made us go to the guest house early." Clint grumbled, wiping a hand over his face tiredly.
"Then he can use it for when his teeth are coming in. Then that'll be that." Steve hummed, putting sauce and cheese on the dough. "Can you bring him over so he put toppings on?"
"Hey there Sammy," He whispered, letting the baby curl his hand around one of his fingers, "Welcome to the world, little fella."
"I am if you keep doing that." Steve hummed warmly, leaning into the touch. "I know you like them, I just feel like I've hurt you doing that and I don't want to ever hurt you."
"I like topping fine." Steve explained, rolling to his side and looking to Tony. "I like that I can make you feel good. Love the noises you make, too." He smiled back.
Tony sat on his bed, breathing heavily. He turned so he wasn't looking at Steve. After that nightmare, Steve was the last person he wanted to look at.
Tony flushed slightly, biting his lip. "I'll do whatever you want me to do, Sir, please let me pass--anything you want," He begged.
"Man, he was great. I used to collect the comic books all the time. I remember one year on Halloween, I think I was six, my mom made me an all-out Captain America costume. She even helped me paint up a shield made out of a trash can lid. I thought it was the coolest thing ever, tossing it around and pretending to knock out Nazis.".
Steve looked to the other man warmly, unable to stop looking at those eyes, wow. They were large, warm, and welcoming.
"You sleepy, birthday boy?" Steve chuckled, sitting at the edge of the tub and stroking Tony's bangs back softly. "Didn't mean to wear you out so early on your birthday, though. Sorry."
"We dids some exercises w'en we wuz s'posed t'be sleepin'," Peter said proudly, then clapped a hand over his mouth when he realized what he'd said
Tony woke up slowly the next morning, eyes widening when he had realized at some point he had fallen asleep. His brain moved a mile a minute trying to piece together the events the night prior, noticing he was in neither his bedroom nor his lab. He heard a soft groan from the spot next to him that helped jog his memory of having been in the Hulk chamber with a lupine Steve. The warmth of the blankets and the other’s fur must have been what brought him to sleep.
"Would it be weird if I was your assistant? I don't even know the first thing of what to do." Steve asked curiously, being careful with his tone because damn. He usually didn't like other people fighting his battles for him, but Tony was hot when he was mad at other people like that.
"Steve? Steve's m'soulmate," Tony hummed, managing to smile up at Pepper, "I wanted you guys to meet, but we were so busy with moving--"
Steve smirked to him, unbuckling his belt and slipping it off. "You can look but no touching yet. One more question." He purred. "What two states joined and finished up our list of fifty?"
"He's....." Natasha sighed, opening the door more to let them in, "Does he like to paint to draw attention to himself?"
Tony grumbled, nipping Steve's nose lightly in recoil. He had to hold back his laughter at the stunned look on the blond's face.
, Steve--" He only lasted a few more seconds before he came, making a mess of Steve's chest and his hand.
"Maybe, but hey, you're insanely strong mentally. And I love that." Steve purred as they curled up under the covers, reaching over and playing footsie. "I always had a thing for smart guys, y'know--"
"Are you kidding? That's totally going up somewhere. Probably in the lab," Tony snorted, "Unless you want to try and draw it again. I'm
Ooooh my goodness, this is probably the longest chapter in this thing, but hopefully its enjoyable :3
He rifled through the closet for his Black Sabbath shirt, sighing comfortably at the warmth of the shirt.
Sammy giggled at the raspberry, babbling happily as he was picked up. He patted at Tony's chin and beard with a tiny hand, squealing softly.
"Well, when you can't use the toilet yet, it’s what happens." Steve sighed, finishing up the change and spraying some light freshener in the room.
Steve ran off upstairs to Peter's room, knocking lightly on the door. Peter hopped up off the floor and opened the door, looking up at Steve.
"Oh. Well," Steve started as he thought about it "I really like the role play stuff. A lot. And I sort of enjoyed...bottoming quite a bit, too." He flushed softly. "I didn't like being cuffed, though. I like being able to touch you back." He explained.
"Yeah, bubba. Let me just hand your brother to Daddy." The blond hummed, giving Sammy to Tony and scooping Peter up and into his lap for a snuggle.
"This is definitely a common thing with victims of domestic abuse. The fact that your mind doesn't block it all out subconsciously though could be due to the fact that it occurred for such a long period." He explained. "The fact you managed to trust enough to be married after all that is a huge step and definitely helps a bit, but there is still the other half to be dealt with. And it definitely won't be instantaneous to help get over. That'll take baby steps."
“Wanna talk?” He asked softly and quietly to not worse Tony’s headache. The man shook his head and nipped on his tea, because Steve still wouldn’t let him drink coffee. When he put down the cup, Steve took his hand. “I’m here, okay? Even if it was about him, you can talk to me.” Tony nodded and silence found his way back in the kitchen.
“He sure is, ready to go. His dad is against it, as are we. He is just in there, together with Obadiah…” James Rhodes spoke out the name with so much disgrace that Steve didn’t even need to ask about the man.
Steve woke up, when he felt something laying on his shoulder. Like the good soldier he was, it took him barely a second to be fully awake. Through the city light, he could make out Tony standing in front of him. The light shined into the man’s face and Steve could see his wet cheeks and the general sad expression Tony wore. He looked like a child in that moment. A child that needed protection because earth was a bad place for such a soft soul.
“You are really invested in Football.” Steve wondered, he really hadn’t taught it was such a big thing for the Stark, more like a little hobby to get his mind off of engineering from time to time.
Steve was woken up way too early for his liking. He obviously hadn’t slept well, most of the night he didn’t sleep at all. He knew he would have slept better with the genius in his arms, but he was just not brave enough walking to him, fearing another discussion. On the other hand, he knew that Tony definitely would be brave enough but he was so fucking stubborn to admit he wanted to be close to Steve right now.
“He made an AI, out of his brain. I’m not sure how, but anyways, he talked about things with Natasha and me… He showed something…”
“Hey, everything’s fine. We were fine back at Tony’s place, no worries, big guy. You were right, Tony deserves his friends. I’m just concerned because of you. You see why, right?” Bucky pushed him a little away only to take his face in his hands.
The soldier himself spent some time with Bucky and Sam, but mostly he was mother-henning Tony, who didn’t complain at all, well most of the time. While he kept the genius alive, he learned to cook, mostly thanks to Pepper and surprisingly Thor. The brothers only showed up once a week at best, while the rest of the group pretty much was always around in the evenings after school or work to keep them company.
“Hey Dumbass!” Somebody shouted at him and Steve was back in reality. Bucky was looking at him with a raised eyebrow. “Man, this daydreaming has to stop before your back with the army.” Steve rolled his eyes
“Yes.” He whispered. He was still crying, Steve could again feel the wetness on his shirt and he was still not a fan. He would never be, but it was good that the tears dropped on him and not into a lonely bed.
“Man, I totally forgot Sam, I told him I would call him for the mission.” Steve realized. “But you said two visitors? Is Nat with him? I thought she was going to Europe for a while.”
“Anyways, Tony is in a relationship, right?” Natasha just shrugged. She was a spy and she knew more things than anybody else, she could read people pretty well, especially Tony and Steve, but she never understood the relationship between Pepper and him. They loved each other, dearly, but something seemed wrong with it, just as if it was not meant to be.
Steve laughed. He did throw his head back, totally losing his shit and while Tony had no idea what was so hilarious, he totally loved the sound and the motions the man was making. Steve wiped away a tear that had come up in the corner of his eye. “Thanks for saving my life.” Tony said after Steve had calmed down.
“So, Tony didn’t want him to come, right?” Bucky asked into Pepper’s direction after he had taken a sip of his coffee.
“It’s Obadiah. He can if he wants. He’s got lots of fans on the board and legally he is the only CEO right now.”
Tony clapped his hand on his back and walked him to their lab. “That’s last week’s news, you have to catch up, and hey, we’ve got a new member.” Tony stopped in his track. “One question, really important. I mean, you know I love that big guy, right? Course I do, he saved my life… I can still smell his breath… but hey, not a problem.” He sighed. “The Hulk room is occupied. Do you think, you two could get along for the time being?”
“Barnes killed my parents.” Tony declared. “Or rather, HYDRA forced him to do so. And last week, he saved Steve’s life, just minutes after he intended to kill him. I saw him, and I pointed a gun directly in his face, I wanted him dead. He stood there, just watching me… He didn’t try to escape. He didn’t attack me, while I stood there, able to shoot any second. He ran away, when I told him to. He was ready to die. Maybe you can’t trust Steve on this, but I assure you, I don’t have any reasons to protect him.”
“I know you don’t want to, but I thought we could go to our date today and then tomorrow isn’t really the first one, and we would just be frie… acquaintances. Especially since Pepper wants me to play your bodyguards.” He grinned for a second.
“Right now?” Tony asked, starring her down. “It’s you. I will do what I need to do, but as I said, right now other things are more important. Things that are none of your business. Okay, and now, I want to go back to sleep, watch whatever bullshit I can find and enjoy my life for a small amount of time. Thank you very much.”
Steve smiled fondly at him. “You know what? Not even for a second, I could forget you’re a genius, never. But the fact that you’re only twenty and working on your second PhD, that’s shocking, and I only remembered it after seeing this. You’re remarkable, Tony.”
The only thing that hurt was what happened to his best friend Bucky. He lived, Steve had to remind himself more and more often, but he lost his arm. Steve saw him bleeding out in the battlefield more nights than he did not. The pictures weren’t clear in his head anymore. It happened so fast and without warning. The bomb exploded, and the shock wave separated the two friends.
The next morning, Steve was making breakfast while watching his boyfriend sleep on the couch. The TV was still running, Tony might be the genius but Steve wasn’t a moron, apparently it helped Tony sleep when there were sounds around.
Steve had expected lots of people, and also lots of them with cameras to chase after Tony, but there were still more than he could ever have imagined. Apparently, it really was common knowledge that Tony tried to never miss a match.
“You are a child, Tony. Honestly. What would you have done, if I did not show up?” Steve asked when he heard that Tony followed him.
“I was four.” Tony said without hesitation. “And even if I was a clever boy that age, I just didn’t understand when my father told me, my mom wasn’t coming back. Three years ago, my heart started making serious problems and I just couldn’t… I cannot leave my dad alone.”
“Yes and no.” Steve answered the same way Pepper had. “From what I’ve seen, he is pretty mature, more than some of the kids I met in the army, just sometimes he wants to be a kid so bad that he tends to forget all of his responsibilities. I think it’s understandable if you have a look at his history.”
“Don’t discuss maths with Tony, Honey.” Natasha interfered. “Not worth it. And Tony? Wouldn’t you like to see Clint go to the Giants?”
One of the robots came with his claw and picked at his ribs. “That’s Dummy. You have to pet him, or he won’t stop.” Steve did as he was told, still trying to figure out if he wasn’t in a weird science fiction movie.
“Fuck! No. Don’t fucking twist my words!” Bucky screamed at him. “I love Tony, not only because of the prosthetic but also because he helped me through a really dark time. I would give my life for him, if I could. But you are my friend and you’re sensitive. He has people to look after him, a bunch of…”
“Absolutely not!” Tony declared with a firm voice, when Steve broke the idea to him on going to the football match. “When I let you choose the place for our first date, I expected a little more, Rogers.” The genius wasn’t directly angry but definitely distraught, Steve saw his fast breathing and his restless eyes.
“I can’t Steve. I’m sorry, but…” He took a deep breath, closing his eyes for a second. He really did not want to cry in front of Captain America. “We both know he will be there, today. Hill told me about your plan, but I can’t. I know you will spare him Steve. I understand. You will try to save him, but I can’t watch it, not yet. These pictures. One day, maybe. But you’re alone now. I’m sorry.” Tony turned around, wanted to go as far away as possible but Steve grabbed his shoulder.
The other man came up to them and laid an arm around Howards shoulder. This man was far more intimidating than Howard. “These two will stay here, so nobody can just go into Tony’s room and bother him while he recovers.”
As you realized, I really didn't want to make this about Bucky's healing process, it would have been too scientific for a basic love story and also it would have been too long for a story that was never meant to be that long. I love Bucky's story but I just didn't like to force it into this Stony story.
Steve hummed in understanding, continuing to feed Tony. "You don't have to apologize for it, Tony. I'll help out with it whenever you need it. You don't have to say sorry though." He said with a soft smile.
He helped Peter eat a couple bites before returning to his own food, practically shoveling down the delicious alfredo. Looking up, Tony frowned at the look on Steve's face.
dork I know," Tony laughed, letting himself fall onto the bed so Steve could crawl over him, "I mean, if you don't want me to stay, I can most certainly leave--"
"Uh huh, we can gets you a manta ray," Peter giggled, holding tight to Steve's hand, "Cause they'd real gentle cweachas."
"Yes, sleep baby. When you wake up, we'll get the boys and stop by the bakery for some donuts for breakfast." Steve hummed, smooching him back and petting his hair.
"Sounds like a plan, babe." Steve said with a smooch back, sorting clothes into Peter's dresser drawers.
"You know you are asking the wrong person that question." Steve admitted, rubbing at his nose softly. "But we'll see. You could get it, you could not. It'll be a surprise answer."
Steve jolted his eyes open, quickly turning towards the clock. He had about ten minutes before his shift started.
." Steve said in a gentle, warning, singsong voice. "We know you are there, baby. We are just busy." He sighed. "Tony, would you pick him up please?"
Tony merely hummed low in his throat, keeping his hands on Steve's hips to prevent him from bucking up into his mouth. He pulled off with a wet 'pop', flicking his tongue into the slit.
"Shh, no more talk about it while the bear is present," Tony smiled softly, nuzzling at Steve's chest.
Tony tried not to squirm under the pleasure in his spine, blinking away the buildup of tears in his eyes. He waited for Steve to pull him off his lap before laying down on the bed, barely able to resist grinding into the bed.
He motioned his head towards the erection still between Steve's legs, reaching over to gently take Steve's hand in his.
"They pretty much are. That's a separate culture that I never got too deep into." Tony frowned, but his eyes lit up as he got closer to the crops.
"Of course, and you'll be our lil Spidey," Tony hummed, "Maybe Papa will think up a superhero for Sammy, hm?"
"Then let me help you cope, Tony. That’s one of the reasons I'm here." Steve said quietly, moving to pull Tony in his arms and rocking him softly.
"There we go. It'll heal up just fine, bubba." He said, scooping the boy up carefully and setting him on the couch.
"Well thank you for getting it. It's adorable." Steve grinned, finishing rolling out the dough and greasing up the pans.
"We'll have to tell Peter we have to go take care of some business before we leave so he doesn't freak out when it’s just Pepper here."
"Oh! Well, hello little sprout!" She said a bit surprised, glancing up at Steve. "Is he yours, Steven?" She asked curiously.
Tony's voice was slightly hoarse from the breathing apparatus he had slipped down his throat prior, coughing slightly as he retrieved it.
Steve warmly smiled at the younger man. He thought to himself that this whole thing might be good for the both of them.
Steve nodded softly in understanding, starting to do as Tony instructed. He kept an eye on his feet to watch where he was stepping as they moved, only to have and hand under his chin to lift his face up.
He looked at Peter softly, the boy keeping on his job like a good boy. Steve laid Tony down in bed and covered him up, getting some aspirin and water to help.
"It'll be fine." Steve reassured. "We'll start with simple emotions. Let's see, what sort of things make you happy? Like maybe some happy memories?".
The blond gently brushed the device with his fingers, raising an eyebrow at the other before following through.
The first piece read "NOT FOR SALE!". Tony thought and assumed that the artists are allowed to sell their projects if they wished. It seemed appropriate. It would give the students a feel of how it is to have a job as an artist. Tony moved his eyes to the piece of paper below the first one, taking good care to read it.
"Your Daddy is just being dirty. A dirty man. Ignore him." He explained, finishing up the waffles and carrying them to the table.
"Alright, alright, fine. We'll save PDA for later," Tony muttered, making grabby hands for the whiskey, "But I don't want to get buzzed tonight. Only one more shot for me."
The blond stepped out of the room slowing, heading to the workshop. Once he got there and saw Tony, he decided he
Tony thought that he probably should go, despite the whole action going against his original plan. As much as Tony tried to avoid Steve, he felt he needed to go see what Steve had worked so hard on for the past couple months. Also maybe to give Steve an explanation and a proper goodbye. Tony looked to see what time it was.
“Thanks. I don’t need any more details. Anyways, it’s for free.” He closed his now finished bag and looked back to his friend. “But most importantly, I like Tony. I really do. He needs a friend, and although he’s got some great ones, they don’t have time right now. He’s afraid, I try to support him, no one should be alone for this.”
“I can wait. See you guys.” He said and entered Tony’s room. He was indeed asleep, so Steve only silently put the flowers into a glass of water and sat down next to the Stark boy.
Tony rolled his eyes. “You do know who I am, right? Son of Howard Stark? On the 4th of July, we did not celebrate the Independence Day but the birthday of Captain America.”
“You can’t even tell me anymore, if I have to prepare for your death?” Pepper asked, and Steve just couldn’t bear it anymore. He pushed the door open, starring Pepper down the exact moment their eyes met. He was fit to be tied.
“Tony won’t die, not when I’m there.” He looked away from her to find Tony’s brown eyes. He was calming down again. His hands were still shaking, though. “Tony asked you to leave, twice in fact, so Ms. Potts, it would be appreciated if you’d follow his wish, if not, I may have to force you.”
