would plunge him into an abyss of self-loathing, which ended in something … nasty. Little she knew her two sons were doing quite the same
Sherlock’s breath gently stroked the skin above John’s shoulder blade. Sherlock’s sporadic humming noises sent a chill down his spine as he sped up the strokes on himself without realizing it.
Sherlock held the cigarette between his lips while holding himself by the elbows, letting himself be worshipped by his silver-haired doctor, nibbling his way up to the next muscle.
John stood up and went to look around the warehouse to find a pack of braided general use rope. People use this stuff for climbing mountains (ok, maybe not), or maybe to hang clothes; but no, he was going to use it for much more weird “experiments”. God help him, why did he always ended up doing what Sherlock asked?!
“Coming!” – he screamed as loud as he could and ran down the stairs. The sound came from the garden.
"Justifying your mischief arguing that it was for an experiment. Did your experiment include sticking a monstrous dildo up your arse? Because if that's the case, I need to know. A reference like that will be convenient at the moment, so … Sherlock Holmes, is it bigger than John's member?"
Sometimes the tip of each finger managed to brush against John’s prostate; other times, he just felt a slight tingle at the entrance.
“I don’t care in the least what they want to give Craig Saunders; this one will hang in our living room; now ... here is the packing tape?”
He did so… pulling out his long, hot tongue… tracing Mycroft’s slim but incredibly long cock. He moaned in acceptance. Sherlock’s cheeks were flushed, and he dared himself to be adventurous and took Mycroft inside his throat. Since this hadn’t been an order, Mycroft promptly pulled him out, grabbing Sherlock by the hair like a disobedient pet.
“Are you two flirting!?” Greg’s appetite decided to leave the table. Unfortunately, a rising hard-on took its place.
Mycroft stumbled up to him, holding him tight, just as he did with John a few hours ago. He was hoping his own heartbeats would help Sherlock to remember he was still alive, and selfishly needed to stay that way. Lestrade decided to stare them from afar.
“We had gotten three new anatomy books, and they all differed slightly in terms of heart rate at different pressure points in the body, especially in the anterior cervical region …"
But, it wasn't Mycroft's fault that Gregory Lestrade looked so delicious in a 400-pound fitted dark shirt, and it certainly wasn't his fault to have all the resources to buy him another 200! Plus, the way his beautiful platinum hair turned three shades darker when getting soaked after an hour of mutual oral sex in the back of a sedan with tinted windows on their way to Chiswick was more than a valid reason to develop a healthy
Sherlock did so and John tied his wrists together as he passed the knot each time around his forearms until he reached the elbow. Just until then, he felt a bit bold and passed the rope around Sherlocks neck and then, again, rounded the joint of his wrists. He changed sides and repeated the process with the other forearm. If Sherlock just moved a bit too much, the rope in his neck would start to choke him, a risk he seemed willing to take. Sherlock closed his eyes as he felt John’s touch puting the Belstaff on him again.
“Sherlock, please tell me you picked something nice for her… please, you have tons of coats; give her one of the good ones for the charity” – said Watson annoyed, he already knew the answer that was coming.
Mycroft could defend himself, but the fictional butterflies in his stomach differed about the correct way he supposed should react to the inspector's voice.
Even if he couldn’t see what he was doing, the way Greg moved exuded manliness and control; the way his legs supported him and every muscle contracted; the perfection of an exquisite body beyond lithographs, archival images or marble statues. Greg was the perfect image of a muse-embodiment for modern times.
“It’s not like he had something invaluable, right?” John couldn’t stop fidgeting while making a monumental effort to sound reasonable, mostly to himself and his slipping impassiveness.
– he managed to say, his rage was minimized by the sound of John’s laugh, kneeling up extending a hand to Sherlock to sit up.
“so” john inhaled deeply; finally looking at sherlock. “ I kinda cocked up the morning after didn’t I? “
John tried to get his breathing under control which felt like a real challenge at the moment. Sherlock looked up at him. seemed like his loud voice had sobered him up.
“did you seriously take time off work to coddle me?” Sherlock said trying to change the obvious misery in the air. And it worked. John sat up crossing his arms in front of his chest. Frowning at Sherlock. Well that one was defiantly a good sign if he was ready to boss him around.
Lestrade handcuffed lautner to the radiator pipes in the kitchen then  rushed to sherlock’s side with a phone in his hand.
John made his way out of the cab after paying trying to keep track of the plastic bags of grocery. He put the bags near the door and checked his watch before getting the key out. Weird how sherlock never asked for it back. He was twenty minutes early but the sitter had taken rosie and there was no point in sitting in his own house waiting. He could not tolerate peace and quiet for long these days.
“oh okay.” Sherlock said still groggy from his nap. “I don’t know why you people are still doing this. I promise I’m gonna stay clean.” he finished frowning.
Knew. Bitterness. Did his boyfriend cheat on him with john? Possible. Either way sherlock felt that he was not here on a heartfelt purpose to visit john. Sherlock hid his desire to protect john under a mask of friendly curiosity.
Finally, in the light of the living room john had a good look but shelock didn’t seem in pain when he took off his coat, jacket and scarf and missed the hook on the wall.
Sherlock smiled shyly at her. He didn’t know what to say. _I’m sorry john can’t forgive you because of me, but I have an undying love for your husband so I’m kinda okay with it_ didn’t feel like a nice thing to say.
John settled on the couch deciding to have a read before actually sleeping. But he couldn’t focus through the tangle of thoughts in his head. He wanted to apologize. But an apology seemed so ridiculous for what he had done.  Besides, what would he say? Sorry I was an arsehole? If anyone had done what I did to you, I would’ve killed them? It all sounded empty and meaningless.
sherlock drew a deep breath. He never wanted to see john miserable again. he made a vow to himself to always try and make him at least smile if not laugh his ridiculous adorable giggle. Oh how he wanted to kiss that smile. They both leaned in at the same time. Apparently john was thinking the same.
“you did this the last time. You convinced me that she had no other choice… that she was innocent. Why are you trying more than me to save my marriage? “
“We weren’t expecting you for another half an hour or something mate.” Greg stood up and came to the kitchen.
John sat up to look at him waiting. Greg uncomfortably scratched the back of his neck. Looking straight at the floor avoiding john’s eyes.
Sherlock’s bandaged hand came up to john’s face. john pulled away and kissed his palm without opening his eyes. He slid from his uncomfortable position to lie down and hid his face in the crook of sherlock’s neck. He could feel the flutter of his heartbeat on his skin. he breathed in trying to calm himself. to make sense of what was happening.
john was using a voice sherlock hadn’t heard in a long time. Like he actually was worried about him. Like he cared if anything happened to him. He nodded but He actually felt like crying. John seemed to think it was enough.
Sherlock let out the breath he was holding the second the door closed. He knew his cheeks were red. Damn his pale complexion. mycroft was avoiding his gaze. But after a second of awkward silence he said:
Next thing he knew was john’s lips against his own. Even drugged to his eyeballs he knew that this groundbreaking feeling was real. That john, his amazing john had kissed him with his super soft lips. John backed away but his hand was still on sherlock’s face and their foreheads were touching. John kissed him gently again and sat back on his chair holding his hand.
John couldn’t help the little smile at the tone that he hadn’t heard for so long. Seemed like his sherlock was slowly coming back. He’s not YOUR anything Watson pull your head out of your ass you just beat him to a pulp not so long ago. Suddenly not smiling wasn’t that hard anymore.
He didn’t want to think of tomorrow, of what john’s expression would be when he actually thought about tonight. Sherlock’s chest tightened imagining john’s regret, of his repeated “I’m not gay”s. he inhaled sharply. He couldn’t live with that knowing now what it felt like to be wrapped up in john’s sleepy arms. But whatever happened, he still had this. His arm was on john’s back holding him, stealing his warmth through his tshirt. And He WOULD NOT sleep. He focused on john’s rhythmic breathing and his puffs of breath warming his aching side.
Sherlock jerked awake with a pang. It was still dark. At first he didn’t know what might have woken him up but a few second later he heard a muffled moan from the sitting room. John hadn’t listened to him and slept on the sofa anyway then. He tried to ignore it. He wasn’t particularly interested in whatever or whoever john would be moaning for in his dreams. He turned on his other side and tried to go back to sleep but this time the sound came, it was louder and much more distraught.
“I didn’t.” sherlock said firmly. “I’m just happy I got Rosie out of the flat soon enough. And he just shot me.”
“I just wrapped up some interrogations at the yard. Thought I’d come see him. It’s been awhile.” He finished somberly. “how are you holding up?”
“jooohn?” sherlock raised his head like he had just noticed john was there.” Wha arr you doin herrr? “he slurred.
“okay time for bed I guess. I’ve left the baby monitor with rosie so she’ll be fine “ john was looking uncomfortably around the flat. “ I think I’m gonna sleep on the sofa… you know in case you need me.”
sherlock had no intention of sleeping. So he took off his shirt and trousers before getting in bed planning to think about the feeling of john’s body warm and safe in his arms for hours until the alcohol left his system and he could be sure of what was real and not. But the trip to sherrinford, playing for hours and then the emotional turmoil that followed and finally the alcohol took a toll on his body and before he knew he had fallen to a dreamless sleep.
Sherlock was trying to catch up. His muscles weren’t exactly obeying his orders and keeping his head up even for a few minutes were a struggle. He had some delightful exercise to look forward to get the use of his body back. But his mind had more important things to think about. John was getting a divorce. Sherlock couldn’t tell him exactly the reason of his guilt. He could accept he was not the reason of their separation but the joy he felt in the deepest darkest part of his heart was real. And it made him a disgusting person. But john was getting a divorce and he had to try hard not to let hope take much space in his beaten and broken heart.
“Sherlock” his breathed through tears. “listen to me you git. You’re gonna wake up right now. You can’t do this. You just can’t do this to me. People need you here. Mrs. Hudson, your parents, Mycroft… yes even him” he took a deep breath trying to stop the tears. “you should’ve seen him when you were shot. I had never seen him so frightened. Rosie needs you… or who is going to talk to her about types of wool now? …Sherlock.. I need you. I can’t … I can’t do this again.”
Her voice betraying her seemingly professional behavior. Sherlock’s eyes went up in their socket and his eyelids fluttered shut.
Sherlock slowly dragged himself up and sat back in his chair as john made his way back to the fire place.
John had kissed him and sherlock wanted more . he inhaled deeply and put his arms around his shoulders and pulled him in for a proper kiss. sherlock was hot and cold at the same time. Some part of his mind was wondering why he hadn’t done this sooner.  He felt john’s whole body melt into the kiss. He pulled back to look at john’s face. He opened his eyes when sherlock’s hand rested on his jaw. There were tears in his eyes threatening to fall any second. His face was so full of affection that sherlock felt like his heart would burst out of his chest any second.
“I can’t can i? “john’s anger was raising as well. “I can’t go back to my own life. My wife’s past assassin life caught up with her and my best friend paid the price. “
“Yeah um… the sitter got rosie early and she has her for the night so I thought we’d give mrs.hudson the night off.” John said to greg while putting away the groceries.
“there’s um…” sherlock found his voice. “there’s a good chance I won’t remember this when I wake up. “
“It’s always the same place.” Sherlock shocked him out of his stance. they were talking about it then. John braced himself for more details.
“This time? He was holding you over the edge. I was trying to get to you but I couldn’t move. “ sherlock said his voice shaking in the end. “ It was like my feet were cemented in and he was laughing.”
“of course. ” Sherlock offered him a smile hoping that he could feel how much he was missed in his flat and his life.
he didn’t want to blame him, especially now but he couldn’t help it. He also couldn’t help hate himself. John was selfish to bring rosie back to the world of criminals and murderers just because he felt empty without it. Just because life with sherlock was the only thing that ever made him really happy other than his daughter.
“can we sit?  I need to tell you something.” John led them to the chairs around the table in the kitchen. He held sherlock’s both hands in his own and looked down at them for quite a while before he inhaled loudly and looked up to him.
“Good morning to you too.” She said in a grave voice before looking at john. “the sitter has rosie for a few hours. I came to see Sherlock and to … to take you home. “
“same thing it has been last few weeks.” John said with a grave expression. “you getting shot by people and dying in…”
John looked at him expecting him to be talking to sherlock but he was looking directly at john. He hadn’t picked up on it before but he felt the anger now. it was interesting how the only thing he felt was gratitude at him for being sherlock’s friend and watching out for him. He’d liked it more if Greg wasn’t trying to set him up with a hot Italian guy, but who was he kidding. He had no right… no right at all to anything from sherlock. Hell he’d even tried to make him get to Irene Adler yesterday.  Although that didn’t come out the way he really meant, it didn’t change what he said.
“yes I did.. it’s the least I can do.” He finally looked at mary. Who stood up from the chair she was occupying.
“yeah she’s practically unstoppable … you turn around for one second and she’s gone. Today something happened at the work too…”john went on while his phone played in the background.
“I don’t …” Greg stammered, his expression softening. “I don’t hate you john…I understand that you’ve had it so difficult these past few years…I know that... I was there for all of it ... but I’m not gonna let you take it out on sherlock anymore.”
“come here” he said with a shaky voice. Sherlock joined him on the sofa. John closed in for another kiss this time with more urgency. One of his hand’s was roaming sherlock’s back and the other was curled around his neck. It felt like john was trying to fill years of feelings in a kiss.
Sherlock chuckled which triggered john’s ever so adorable giggle.  Tension left sherlock’s bones and he sagged against the pillows. This couldn’t be that bad. Of course if john regretted anything, he wouldn’t be looking at sherlock with so much compassion right?
“sherlock? Wake up” john said loudly. “It’s just a nightmare.” He put his hand on his shoulder and shook him while calling again.
Sherlock slowly pushed aside his sheets and tried to sit up. John’s voice was growing into a shout now. defiantly a nightmare then. Sherlock got up and walked to the sofa as fast as he could while turning on the light in the kitchen. John was sprawled on it with a blanket twisted under his waist and around his legs. the skin on his throat shining with sweat under the lamp light.
“get well soon.” And then they were gone. John exhaled loudly and sherlock’s knees wobbled. He tried to sit back down and felt john’s hand on his elbow steadying him.
“so you can go home right ahead greg thanks for everything.” John said with a serious tone as he was putting away the last of groceries that nobody asked him to buy.
Oh god no... sherlock … he was supposed to be watching rosie today. The grocery bag slipped through his numb fingers but he barely noticed.
“well I’m sorry but it’s …um” sherlock said quietly.” he had to choose the ones who were more probable to survi…”
“though there was a ridiculous one…” Lestrade continued after handing sherlock the water and the tablets and going back to his chair. “I think you’re gonna love this.” he chuckled.
“Fine she’s fine” john cleared his throat. “seems to get along with her current sitter.” Sherlock was looking at him urging him to continue so he did. “I’m thinking about hiring her as a part-time nanny.”
“and then I smiled. “ sherlock said with the same somber tone staring at the ceiling. “then I saw my reflection on the window… I looked like her. “
The sound of footsteps coming down the stairs pulled him out of his mind. Sherlock sat up and slowly got on his feet as john came in the room with the baby monitor in hand.
John gently washed his hand and sat him back down on the tub. he was checking for any forgotten shards in his palm, when greg left the bathroom.
Mary nodded “okay then… keep me posted will you?” she bended over john to wrap her arms around his shoulders. John almost pulled away from her touch. Fortunately, mary left without another word. John couldn’t help but think that Sherlock was struggling to live because of mary because of her past. His anger at her for shooting him in the chest came back full force. Sherlock didn’t deserve this.
“Sherlock? Are you alright? You’re not saying anything… it’s getting a bit scary now.” john whispered.
“So how’s rosie doing? “ sherlock’s voice cut through his gloomy thoughts. He had almost finished his dinner. Thank god he was eating again; he’d gotten so thin.
“I don’t want to impose, you know. You never asked to be woken up by a kid’s cry in the middle of the night. “  john said like he was stating the obvious.
“I know god I know” John said all the energy leaving him. “You can’t possibly hate me more than I do myself.”
Maybe it would help if they both pretended like nothing happened. Sherlock felt like dying all over again. He couldn’t do this now. now that he knew what it was like.
“hey there mate. “ john put his jacket over the chair next to the bed. Sherlock was looking the same. Somebody had shaved him though. Probably his mother had come in to see him today.
“sherlock can you press my hand?” john felt his ever still hand tense in his palm. A sob made his way out of his throat.
The next time he came to himself, he could hear. The beeping sound, someone breathing. His middle was heavy with pain but he managed to open his eyes. The first thing he saw was a bluish light. After his eyes adjusted, he looked around and saw the hospital room he was in. then he noticed the breathing source which looked a lot like john’s gray-blonde head napping on his left hand on the mattress. Sherlock had a strong desire to just run his hand through those strands. He couldn’t find a reason not to, yes his mind was cloudy and yes he didn’t exactly know why he was in the hospital again but this was john. John was good. So he did what he wanted.
“be careful of the glass shards I’ll clean it up in a bit. “ greg said sweeping the few pieces off the floor.
“… your weapon.” Sherlock made the words out over the pain that had taken his body. “… hands in the air…”
“alright” john didn’t want to know what sherlock was dreaming about. He was afraid that it was himself. That he was the villain of sherlock’s nightmares now. it would be more than he could take.
Sherlock was avoiding his eyes pretending to be staring at the gash inside his hand but at that he looked up to find john’s concerned eyes searching his.
“no I had Rosie the last two nights. I guess she’s still getting used to the change in her sleeping place.”
“of course john” sherlcok cut him short. “ her company is always a pleasure. “ he finished with a smile which john returned with a grateful one.
“ok I’ll tell you what.” Lautner said finally with a strange calm over his whole features. “ I’ll tell you what happened and you tell me what you would do if you were me… Jake… My boyfriend…he was too
Suddenly a world of regret opened up under his feet. They could have avoided so much pain so much self-loathing so much suffering. But then he wouldn’t have rosie would he? His beautiful miracle wouldn’t even exist because He wouldn’t spend longer than a day with mary after sherlock came back if he knew what he felt for him. what he could feel for him.
“I was just checking up on rosie… heard her over the monitor I didn’t want to wake you again.” He said his eyes boring in sherlock’s soul. He nodded his understanding.
John was playing with his hair like he did last night. It was like he pulled every thought from his head one by one and filled their place with peace.
“I am sorry” john continued his voice softening. “ you cannot imagine how sorry I am. and… and I am working on it…I’m getting help from professionals to insure that I will never be that person again. And if you…if you let me I will make it up to you the rest of my life.”
“john?” Sherlock asked. Suddenly he put the bags on the chair and wrapped his arms around sherlock’s shoulders and rested his head against his temple. Sherlock held his breath trying to take all of it in . john’s breath on his ear, his tight grip. He weakly tried to raise his arm and return the hug but he only managed to touch john’s shoulder with his right hand.
“hey hey hey “ john turned around crouching and held sherlock’s face in his hands. Those beautiful eyes were not supposed to be so wet. John wouldn’t let it happen anymore. He couldn’t stop himself before kissing sherlock’s temple. Kissing away the tears and then his forehead. He wished he could send what he was feeling and thinking through his kisses. I’m sorry. I should’ve been there for you. I’m here now.
John felt the floor being yanked from under him. But he kept his face unexpressive and gestured the doctor to continue.
“okay all done.” John said. “let’s get you to bed you still need the rest.”  John’s expression had darkened again. The amused smirk gone like smoke.
John and greg came through the door in haste. Sherlock tried to dislodge his hands from the edge of the sink and stand straight but seemed like he was frozen and with any movement he’d fall over. -Pathetic sherlock. And not even when you’re alone too. Can’t even brush you bloody teeth without adult supervision?- The voice inside his head went on.
“if you mean magnussen,” mary’s voice was stone cold now just like her face.” I was perfectly capable of solving that on my own AGAIN if you weren’t involved.”
Sherlock was looking at him with narrowed eyes and a tilted head. Scanning him. The familiarity of the act made john smile but when he realized what might be scanned he stopped smiling.
“ha ha john is shorter than sherlock… how funny.” John said with an annoyed voice but unable to keep up the bad temper for long.
“he actually reminded me of you sherlock the way he dressed the way he noticed the details nobody else would.” Greg continued as john came to sit on his chair. “want me to get his number for you? I’d bet you’d make a scary couple.”
“because I saw it… finally…that we don’t work. And I didn’t want it to work anymore. “he sighed deeply. Maybe it was exhaustion but he was lightheaded and didn’t have the energy for filtering his thoughts. “you’ve been shot twice now and both times because of her… I wasn’t gonna stick around for a third time. “
“you were gone… I … I thought…” he couldn’t finish his sentence. But john seemed to know exactly what he had thought.
“OH FOR GOD’S SAKE” sherlock’s voice cut through the flat. “I don’t need minders twenty-four seven. “
his full bladder was what woke him up and before he was completely awake and aware of the pain in his head he had stumbled to the bathroom and relieved himself. That was when the events of yesterday rushed up into his mind. The bar, the drinking, john waiting for him in baker street. Oh god did john really kiss him?
Sherlock didn’t dare to move. John had him tangled in his limbs and sherlock was enjoying it too much to move a muscle. For the first time in… ever, he felt happy… he felt safe and warm inside his battered and abused heart. The heart that was healing already.he felt home. It had started when the octopus around him, started kissing him and washed away his pain.
“sherlock you have saved my life on more than one occasion but most importantly you have saved my soul and this has taken me a long time and I hate myself for taking this long to see this because I love you.” Sherlock felt tears welling in his eyes. He wouldn’t even imagine this in his wildest dreams.
Sherlock’s eyes closed and he decided to give in. he felt john dropping a gentle kiss against his forehead. And he thought he heard a whisper.
“hey hey hey it’s okay it’s okay” john grabbed his elbow gently and wrapped his other arm around sherlock’s back. Sherlock couldn’t help but lean onto his arms. he didn’t particularly care where john was leading him. He never did actually.
In the back of his mind something was nagging him that he shouldn’t have said that but he was too tired to care. And it couldn’t have been that bad, john was looking at him in a very soft and loving way. So he relaxed and basked in the warmth of john’s smile.
John’s brain was still drawing a blank as he stared down the grown man budged up in the chair. Here he was worrying for hours that his super genius villain of a sister had turned his brain into a mush by torture and his highness was off getting drunk not bothering to even turn his phone on. And he still had the guts to sass john off.
“He.. the shooter…fred lautner .. wasn’t there for sherlock.” Lestrade finally looked at john. “I interrogated him before coming here. He was…. looking for you.”
“maybe I can still surprise you” she tilted her head and said with a smile that Sherlock didn’t like. And before he know it she lifted the gun and aimed at his heart. Sherlock raised his hands.
“it’s alright.”sherlock realized his hand was still on john’s shoulder. He pulled it back reluctantly. Then just to have something to do he stood up with his wobbly knees and brought a glass of cold water back for john. Who was still following him around with his stare. But accepted the glass and drank it at one go. Water trickled down his throat joining the beads of sweat. sherlock couldn’t help but stare.
“I’m sorry.” John added, sorrow filling his heart. “I really am. You pulled me together when I couldn’t see a light at the end of the tunnel and I will always be grateful of that.”
John let out a voice between a sob and a chuckle. the tears finally fell on his cheeks. Sherlock kissed them away like it was the most obvious act in the world.
“oh Sherlock” mary walked over to him and hugged him briefly. “I can’t tell you how happy I am to see you’re fine. Mrs. Hudson told me.”
Sherlock trailed off looking back to his empty plate. John’s heart broke for the millionth time. Sherlock didn’t think he’d trust him to have Rosie by himself but he was still offering to help after the despicable message john had sent him through molly.
Lestrade came to his side wordlessly and got his arm around his shoulder when he tried to get up and keep the grimace off his face. he managed to sit up without a whimper with greg’s help and accepted his plate of dinner. That was when he glanced at john sitting on his own chair with the darkest expression on his face.
Sherlock had spent his first day back home mostly on his chair studying the cold cases lestrade had left for him and occasionally walking over to kitchen and back, to get his mug of tea. which john stubbornly insisted that he had to get up and get himself or he wouldn’t get any. He knew john would finally give up and bring him the tea if he persisted on sitting but he knew that he had to move to recover faster and he couldn’t wait to get back his strength.
“brother mine, I’m delighted to see you awake.” He said with a fake sneer. But Sherlock knew better. His brother was genuinely glad that he was relatively fine.
“at least that’s all he said before a lawyer got there.” Greg took pity on him. “ we can get the details later. “
After john put the water glass back on the side table, he didn’t move from his position of sitting on the bed cross-legged and staring at the pillow.  An odd silence fell. A silence so delicate, felt like it can be broken with a single misspoken word.
“don’t worry she’s safe. Just save your energy alright? “ lestrade sounded frantic his eyes full of worry.
Sherlock eased himself on the armrest of the sofa pulling john on to him. His smaller figure fit perfectly with him. John pulled his face back and rest his head on sherlock’s chest. Both of them breathing heavily held onto each other. Sherlock listened to john and his own breathing until they both drifted off to sleep.
“I’m FINE.” Sherlock said loudly. Greg narrowed his eyes at sherlock at that but seemed to let it go for now. Sherlock tried to stand up while huffing to himself and both john and Greg moved to help him.
Before he knew it john leaned forward and put his palms on each side of sherlock’s face. He had no choice but to stare back at the dark blue eyes. His mind had drawn a blank page and his heart was racing. John closed his eyes and he felt his warm lips touch his own. It was a sweet gentle kiss and before he could react or start to take in the details they were gone.
“It’s okay.”john got up from his position beside the bed. “water? “ sherlock shook his head slightly.
“dr Watson,” Sherlock’s doctor came in. “we have news regarding mr. holmes. He seems to have entered a comatose condition due to the lack of oxygen his brain received. “
“you alright mate?” he asked.” Molly left about an hour ago. She wanted to say goodbye but decided not to wake you.”
Sherlock nodded slightly. John hurried to his bag and got his bottle and a cup. He raised the head of the bed and held the cup for Sherlock to swallow slowly. Nurses and doctors followed by lestrade came into the room they started their own observations and questions but john held sherlock’s hand and didn’t let go knowing how he hated being crowded by strangers. Greg glanced at their joined hands once but didn’t say anything. Now that Sherlock was awake john could not care less about what people might think about them.
“john… it’s about sherlock.” Greg’s tone filled his heart with ice. He had heard sentences like this too many times now.
John shuddered probably thinking what would happen if he had shot sherlock when he was holding rosie.
Rosie was clanking on her xylophone while sherlock sat cross-legged in front of her listening to her concerto, swiping on his emails when he heard the front door’s bell. Mrs Hudson and a man’s muffled voice reached him. It didn’t sound like anybody familiar. Client then, but mrs Hudson had let him up despite sherlock’s rule of no client while he was watching rosie. His gait on the steps were calculated. Interesting.
“Rosie…my  beautiful amazing Rosie… she could’ve…” he struggled to get the words out that were threatening to choke him. He put his face back in his hands.
“I’m okay. just wondering if he is going to be too.” He said as he nodded his head towards sherlock’s still form. “you know most of the time I’m thinking that I could have saved him…I wish I wasn’t so late.”
“you didn’t need to do that john.” Sherlock said not daring to look at mary. This was too much. ‘She must hate me’ he thought.
“SHUT UP.” Lautner was yelling with red eyes. “ It was not his choice…Jake survived but barely.... they came back for him a day later… if he was just taken at first… “ his eyes filled with tears.
Sherlock was vaguely aware of greg hurrying to his room and back and then out again. His palm was dripping blood in the tub, making stunning patterns against the porcelain.
“augh nothing I was shot during my time hunting moriarty’s network.” He tried to keep his voice aloof like he was talking about the weather and not the bleedings and infections and pain. Oh the pain. He was lucky this time he was knocked out for the most painful part.
well here we are... the last bit of angst and whole lot of fluff. I really hope you guys like it. :)
“no thanks. When is dr. Watson coming back? “ lautner asked cautiously while standing behind john’s chair in front of the kitchen obviously in a hurry like he didn’t want to sit down.
“well there’s room for improvement” sherlock chuckled.” but I’ll take it gladly” he dropped a light kiss on top of the blond curls.
“john?” Sherlock said gently sitting on the coffee table. But john didn’t wake up or show any reaction so he tried louder this time. “john wake up you’re just having a nightmare. “
“So back to my story…” He turned to sherlock still lying on the sofa. " yeah he literally swiped the whole floor with the crime scene unit and made them look like morons for messing up the bookcase.”
“Good osservational skills jawn” sherlock slurred more as he went to his chair and curled up on it like a cat.
John was sitting on an uncomfortable hospital chair. It had been three days since Sherlock was shot. And now he was lying almost lifeless in front of john. He had barely talked to mary last few days other than asking her about rosie and waiting long enough in home to shower and change and embrace his daughter close wishing he could breathe her into him. Rosie’s heartbeat was the only thing that made him feel he still had a heart himself.
“he’s right john. I’m fine now. I’ll call if I need anything. Go home, rest, come back with some cold cases. “
Sherlock felt too cold and exposed. He opened his eyes. He was on the sofa it took him a moment to remember why. He took a look at his watch. It was just a little past five. And then panic hit him. John was gone. Was it real? He was sure they had kissed and fell asleep together. Had john woken up to realize that it was just a mistake caused by tangled nightmares? Oh no. if so their friendship would be affected now. he had told him that he loved him. John would feel uncomfortable and want to leave as soon as sherlock recovered.
John pulled away after what seemed like a million years. Sherlock moved himself so he’d lie his head on john’s heart. He felt like he could die from happiness. Like he could stay in this bed on this man his entire life without getting tired.
John took a deep breath went to the kitchen for a glass of water mostly to get himself under control. No matter what, he never wanted to get that angry around sherlock again. And he knew he was clean. he had been for months. It was just low of him to accuse sherlock like that.
“heeey” john protested. Mycroft took a look at john probably seeing the tired eyes and the slow movements. Sherlcok saw them too …that john was tired but he didn’t want him to leave him yet.
“oh now it’s our fault,” john snorted loudly. “ good to know you’re grateful of the person who has saved you on more than one occasion.”
Sherlock couldn’t figure out what john meant. He couldn’t have known what exactly? His thoughts were getting slower by the second.
A big lump in his throat stopped him. Sherlock’s eyes stayed closed but john didn’t let go of his hand.
“yeah why not I’d like to meet anyone who would make an idiot out of your crime scene unit.” Sherlock said.
“heeey.” John couldn’t stop the tears clouding his vision. “it’s okay .. you’re alright… you’re in a hospital… I’m here. “ he held his hand tightly afraid that if he let go Sherlock would sleep and never wake up again.
Slowly sensation came back to his legs and arms and his vision cleared. That was when he felt the new sharp pain in his left palm. he saw the red splattered in the sink among the pieces of his glass.
“sure” Mary put down the bag on a chair and the flowers on sherlock’s bed side table. Then she retrieved rosie from the sling and handed her to sherlock’s waiting arms.
“You’re all I have ever needed. Lestrade can have the foreigner to himself. “ sherlock smiled up at john.
“stay?” john almost didn’t hear him. He couldn’t ....wouldn’t turn him down this way. He stumbled to get in the bed; sherlock moved further to open up space for him. But john didn’t lie down. He sat against the headboard. He hesitated a second before putting his fingers through sherlock’s hair massaging his scalp. He was immensely grateful when he saw sherlock close his eyes, all tension leaving his body.
“yeah maybe I shouldn’t be,” john was calm now.” I shouldn’t have been involved … I don’t think it’s too late now. No need to say Sherlock won’t be either.”
Sherlock’s mind was trying to fill in the sentence that john had left incomplete. It was probably ‘dying in the aquarium’. Guilt rushed to him for being the reason of john’s distraught state. But what bothered him more was that he couldn’t read the expression on john’s face as he was staring at sherlock since he had woken up.
John could have been falling by the hollowness in his heart. He tore his eyes from Greg and felt the back of his head hit the wall behind. He could guess the rest but greg told him either way.
Sherlock had just finished his breakfast. His body was getting used to real food again. He went to his chair easier today and got ready to look in lestrade’s box when he heard his door open and close. He turned his up.
In lautner’s shouting they had missed a newcomer down the stairs talking quietly to mrs. Hudson. John. Sherlock thought to himself. He shouldn’t have come back so soon. he needed to keep this unstable mourner away from john at the moment.
At this sherlock thought back to john’s words…romantic entanglement …will complete you as a human being…if sherlock just casually said no to greg’s suggestion maybe john would start lecturing him again about love and romance and the woman.
John felt his lips pulling into a smile. Greg started telling him about the case in details. And he tried not to imagine Sherlock each second responding to each sentence with questions and odd observations.
“doctor Watson you haven’t slept properly in weeks why don’t you go back home and take a long rest. I’m sure I can provide my brother the assistance he might need.”
Greg sighed deeply. “I was… there… and a bunch of police force. We couldn’t do anything until it was too late.”
“god I’m such an arse… I feel like you’re gonna get hurt whenever I see her too close to you… Is it always gonna be like this?  “john said visibly letting his masks fall away.
“yeah good. Hey how long have you been holding her? Your arms must be killing you now… let me have her for a while.” Sherlock hadn’t noticed the strain in his arms but he figured it might be unsafe for rosie to be held by him for too long. He still didn’t know how much to push his body. So he gently handed her to his father.
“good morning” sherlock said not looking at his eyes and making his way to the bathroom. Only to find his way blocked by john, Who put his left hand on his jaw. Sherlock let out the breath he was holding and finally locked eyes with john.
John took a deep breath inhaling through his mouth. “I’m saying that I think our marriage was a mistake. But I will always be grateful of rosie and always always be there for her as her father… but I don’t think we should do this anymore” john pointed at mary and his own chest.
John thought of all the times Sherlock had probably felt gnawed at by the suffocating absence of something to indicate that he was not going insane with the tumult of voices in his head; he would even bet those voices spoke him in Latin or whatever other language they had to learn.
Scowling gave way to embarrassment. The light warmth creeping up his cheeks gave the man a glimpse of hesitation on how to accept defeat. Not that he was perfect, but he refused to accept that there was no moral of a fable in such humiliation. Indeed, a vacation did not sound bad at all and the prospect of playing with paint as when he was a child and taking advantage of his knowledge in human anatomy (mundane porn, hours and hours of mundane freaky porn), sounded quite good.
He waved the package in front of Mycroft's nose, who was too busy savouring the delights of tar to ruin it with saccharose.
And with that, John stood up to his knees, cradling Sherlock’s head, sticking one thumb down his mouth, watching as his neck veins contracted around it. His lover’s hands stroked down his arse tightening the grip on each cheek.
Mrs. Hudson always had a wonderful habit of helping those in need at Christmas; even her two bitter tenants who, without knowing it, was about to help them take a new step in their relationship; or maybe she did know it.
Mycroft sat on a near sofa as he pulled out his member and pulled back his head, relaxing a bit before the storm. Sherlock approached dog-like, keeping his gaze down as he placed between Mycroft’s legs. With and unknown ability until that moment, Mycroft lifted his right leg letting it rest on Sherlock’s shoulder as the other was standing firmly on the ground, reminding him not to lose control before his little brother.
Two bay windows, framed by terracotta walls, reflecting the sun-fall as specks of dust woke up to welcome them into the enclosure; on the walls, several racks filled with blank canvases as if asleep under the effects of paint thinner. The wooden floor creaked as they explored every corner of a part of Mycroft that until that moment, all were oblivious of (kind of).
As for Mycroft, if it only had been any other person, such question would’ve brought him out of his depths, but since it was the well-known insufferable human he was raised with, it was nothing more than a regular oddity.
"If anyone gives a shit on what I think and how I feel, I just wanna say that as long as no-one tickles me, I'm in."
– John huffed picking a bunch of takeaway flyers and pilling them up above the fridge, still inspecting the one for Chinese food he was trying to avoid.
Mycroft made all the pertinent arrangements to make sure none of the guards ever questioned the monthly visits of his three guests: Greg Lestrade, John Watson and Sherlock Holmes. Special instructions were given to omit any type of interruption, no matter what anyone heard, while the four of them were together inside the flat.
Sherlock’s lack of taste while speaking wasn’t something Mycroft wasn’t used to, but today everything that left his mouth sounded even more annoying.
He was still breathing hard, but that last sentence made him look straight into the eyes of his partner, there was a special touch of tenderness in Sherlock Holmes apologizing. It might not be much for other people, but the way his chest felt warm made up for any misunderstanding.
It hurt like hell that Lestrade was the one kneeling next to him, rubbing his back, gently loosening his hands from John’s body. It hurt so much there would not be more long comforting talks and cups of tea upon arriving to Baker Street after an exhaustive day.
Mycroft had always seen him as a beauty deity, but as his hand fought to keep the pace of his thoughts and heartbeat, he remembered all those moments where he prayed for time to stop between them, moments where they held each other, dreaming of being eternal. He truly loved the insufferable fucker, Mycroft realized.
John parted his lips, letting soft moans escape his chest. He pleasured himself with steady strokes leaning back against Sherlock’s shoulder. He enjoyed the feeling of being with someone who truly seemed to care about his pleasure and well-being. Who would’ve thought the madman, sometimes incorrigible bastard he lived with could be so romantic?
“You’re annoying me. You’ve been annoying me with this self-pity parade you’ve insisted on keeping for the past month, now … get up and come to bed” – Sherlock said as firmly as he could, feeling a knot forming in the middle of his throat, making each swallow difficult to hide.
"How much would it be for a custom piece, Mr Holmes?” Greg smiled but regained the fake seriousness moments after.
John entered the room carrying a vintage doctor bag. He pulled out an old blood pressure meter; and put it around Sherlock’s neck. He started pumping the small valve, as it constricted his partner’s throat more and more with each pump. Sherlock whimpered as air wasn’t coming so easily anymore; there was a thin layer of sweat all over his face. He shut his eyes trying to ease his breathing … calm himself down.
Only one safe place in that cold, sad house served to take refugee; his own mind… and probably the kitchen, mostly his mind while standing next to the sink pouring scotch. Maybe it was one of those days when it was absolutely admissible to become monstrously pedestrian and drink straight from the bottle.
Sherlock was right, the world was going to be a horribly dark place from now on without John Watson in it.
Mycroft approached his baby brother’s temple and pulled back the wet locks of hair falling down Sherlock’s face. – “
“Hold yourself… from me, here”, and Sherlock pulled him a bit as he wrapped John's arms around his waist, letting the man's brain reboot enough to remember how to give a waist-hug. Sweat dripped down Sherlock's back, the scent of hours and hours of mingled fluids and his all so very arousing cologne still present in little notes every time he moved; it felt almost as intoxicating as being held down.
They remained laying on the hardwood floor, panting, naked, soaked in the afterglow of what they can proudly catalogue as mind-blowing intercourse. No, that’s such a dull way to call the utter nerve-wracking fuck both have accomplished.
“Well, more sweet illegality for me” Greg grabbed two more gummies, “Mycroft, you’re someone who could start a civil war because his eggs weren’t poached correctly, and yet you feel horribly guilty about something that until half an hour ago felt like the most natural thing.”
A painting he took three years to complete on a consequence of arthritis ill-effects, solitude and the upmost honest admission about the tragedy supposing his penis not being able to get erect anymore. Craig Saunders definition of life purpose included a passionate desperation to succumb to carnal pleasures while
He listened as the sofa creaked and the elegant pen that had been in charge of recording all its intimate details gave way to a soothing sound of charcoal on paper. The thrill of knowing that his frenzy was being captured by someone who already knew him in a worse than a shameful state, turned out to be a trigger interesting his cock.
Mycroft sipped the most pretentious coffee in the world, careful to fill his mouth more than necessary and swirl the still hot enough liquid around every corner of his mouth. He swallowed some, saving the rest to moist Greg's chilly cock.
A final nervous chuckle escaped Sherlock as he came all over John's hand. The warm, and quite literal, feeling of claim filling him. His body giving up on the pure bliss released with each spur.
John put his hands right below Sherlocks arse as he lifted him. He removed the cock ring with his mouth and started slowly sucking him. It didn’t even take him one minute before coming all over John’s mouth. Sweet taste of pleasure.
– said while approaching and pulling him by the hair to expose his neck. He started to give him small kisses, pausing between each one, breathing small puffs of hot air, warming Sherlocks neck and chest, bit by bit.
John obeyed and arched his back. Once he was naked, Sherlock shifted himself to sit on the carpet and made John do the same, hugging him.
John’s arse faced Lestrade directly, and the DI, too tired and delighted to think, grabbed it with both hands, separating and licking between. John's back arched slightly and nuzzled Sherlock's slowly rising cock, breathing hot and directly to his groin.
– a single word burned his apparently inexistent soul. John was much more than just his friend; it seemed an appropriate label to describe them for years. Now, it seemed so small for what John Watson had really did for him.
After several passcode words and security verifications were given, a baffled Anthea assured him she would do her best to keep everything in order and being instantly promoted to James-Bond level PA. Only after Mycroft assured her over twenty times, he was not being kidnapped, nor it was a trick, the call ended.
– Mycroft said, and as a Pavlovian response to the older Holmes orders, Sherlock moaned before reaching for the man’s cock. He swallowed until his cheeks hurt. Stroking with his tongue as fast as he could, tasting the unmistakable flavor of release as Mycroft came messily.
Sherlock shut his eyes avoiding Lestrade’s gaze. His drool had started to mix with his lip injury and dripped a line that traced down a red streak, gently running down to his aching manhood.
– and with that final statement, John started to move faster while Sherlock loudly moaned and grunted. He pulled himself out at the exact moment to throw his release right into Sherlock’s mouth and perfect curls.
Collapse and crisis seemed inevitable at this point; John had to remember himself that running solely on caffeine and angst could have worked during his teens but not in the dawn of his youthfulness. Now he understood why people inhaled cocaine, very much more practical.
Sherlock involuntarily spread his legs, an invitation that Greg immediately accepted by throwing himself at it. Although he was not a heretic, having him at his mercy for the first time in his life awoke a carnal hunger that owned him on the verge of feeling his fingers were turning into claws, digging without consideration into the white skin. The symphony of moans and spasms it provoked was enough to intoxicate any hint of doubt that remained in his mind.
“I never considered the idea of "going for a walk" was really a perfect opportunity to practice theft.”
Sherlock didn’t say anything but refused to let go as he was tightening the grip on John’s inert body. Everything seemed to be passing in slow motion. Did John had to endure this same amount of suffering when he tried to reach him after the fall? after screaming everyone to let him pass because Sherlock was his friend and he needed to see him? How did he bear the pain?
The sound of water being flushed, and the door opening could’ve made John’s rant to stop but were Sherlock’s words what caught him completely off guard.
John smiled and hugged him back, leaning down his head into Sherlock’s neck crook, memorizing every bit of his scent. In some other time, he would’ve mocked him for being such a snob and use that ridiculously expensive cologne. He couldn’t really put a name on what he smelled, but it was some sort of manly floral blend.
“More wine anyone? Water? Coldwater? Mycroft do you have something stronger. Never mind, I’ll find it.” John’s attempt to adjust his pants discreetly failed as he headed to the kitchen.
At Mycroft's quiet command, several hands reached out, stripping him of the many layers of clothing he was still wearing.
If John had something, he should just tell him. That’s what functional adults do; they speak out loud when something bothers them,
Sherlock traced long desperate kisses down John’s jaw, biting hard at the nape of his neck, making sure everyone will know for the next week (at least) this gorgeous man is loved and cared for. John’s hands held from Sherlock’s shoulders, digging his nails into it with each new bite on his skin. They came together, from just the friction between their legs, collapsing over each other.
John returned his hands to trace the little but perfect musculature in the detective's figure, taking the time to go through each harmonious line which suggested a bold, supple strength. The reward for spending many years running along with the only person capable of turning each day into a mad dance of fear and excitement. In every wound, scar, or mark, Sherlock's body was a testament to the wonder of sharing his witticisms. With his cock brushing Sherlock's tailbone, John realized he was holding him much tighter than necessary.
Carefully, he guided John to the bedroom door before stopping abruptly and turning John into the living room, making him sit in his chair, still protected by his cocoon of cotton.
John came in hard waves over Sherlock’s hand, cuddling himself on Sherlock’s arms as he smiled in content. Sherlock lifted his slick hand staring at John’s spill covering it. He spread it all over like moisturising lotion and licked his thumb to taste more of John.
Fortunately, none of the models was drooling copious amounts of semen on their fellow men or losing grace and style; everything was perfect and beautiful.
Mycroft's thumb moved from Sherlock's temple to each cheekbone, caressing, until it reached his lip; teasing the soft skin making his mouth open involuntarily letting escape a soft whimper he probably didn't know was holding. Then, unexpectedly, Sherlock licked it.
Even calmer than before, he returned to his spot and retook the pencil. It took him a little longer than it should have to settle down and resume activities. The notebook now trying to hide his excitement. John noted with amuse how Mycroft was finding increasingly more challenging to maintain the composure and stoicism he was always supposed to present.
Now Sherlock had an open-mouthed Mycroft at his mercy, "Oh! I think I wasn't supposed to say that … woopsy."
He pulled Sherlock to a sitting position stripping him from the remaining of his clothes with timed precision. Instinctively, Sherlock wrapped his ankles around John's waist, using both hands to leverage and offer himself to be (
He blindfolded Greg as well, giving him a peck on his way back to the seat. He still tasted like the delicious combination of menthol, semen, and probably cherry gummies.
John was sure there must have been a way to save that sound to use as a ringtone later. As Greg continued his ministrations interspersing sizes, textures and lengths of each digit preparing Sherlock, John lowered him to the floor enclosing his face between his hands, forcing him to focus only on his mouth. With each moan, with the relentless effort, his voice quickly became a squeak.
A muffled cry and the sounds coming from Greg and John, making sure not a single corner of their mouths was left unexplored, is the last thing he remembered before deciding it was too much.
John slowed down the pace. Sliding up, excruciatingly slow, up and down Sherlocks palpitating cock. He was awfully wet, leaking on the verge of coming.
His patience had been running out more and more with every single monosyllable that John carefully crafted to respond to every question.
This man was not ageing; he just didn't realise how all his knowledge longed to be applied to a much younger specimen.
With that final statement, John began to walk away to his old room, but before Sherlock could stop himself, the words were leaving him, unleashing the storm.
Sherlock’s obvious mind-reading abilities quickly caught up with John’s turmoil of thoughts, snapping him out with a lewd kiss. A slow and tender progression while he straddled him, resting his chest over his now entwined hands, “Tell me how I can help?”
Finally, Sherlock’s numb hands released the grip and the paramedics took their chance to pull John out of his reach.
“What if…” Sherlock began, “…someone skilled enough recreated the painting? We know the client only specified a few elements, and the rest was left to Saunders creativity. Someone could repaint it.”
How many times do I have to tell you!? If there is no paperwork, the cases are dismissed, I lose my job, my mortgage, and I will have to eat frozen dinners for the next five years, to say the least…
John's negotiation was heard all along the corridor. As soon as he returned to the apartment and closed the door, he prepared to take a nap before returning to the difficult task that was leading with the conviction towards Sherlock.
John released Sherlocks hair as he stood up to stripping himself, didn’t feel the cold anymore. He ripped Sherlock’s underwear with a new strength he didn’t know he had, releasing Sherlock’s cock giving him a few strokes, erecting it a bit more but mostly milking out a bit of pre-come he used to lubricate his own entrance. He shrugged in anticipation as he placed himself over Sherlocks cock, aligning it before impaling himself. He didn’t even have to adjust to Sherlock’s tightness, this was the purest and rawness sensation he ever felt.
than the service personnel, whom by the way, I'm almost certain were forbidden to speak to us more than strictly necessary” Sherlock’s voice dropped a tone, “apparently, silence was the best motivator for the development of our greater intellect and concentration.”
“No, I work better when I can see exactly how my art comes to life. So, I will need models, but more importantly, I
“But that’s how it works”, he smiled, “I haven’t felt the need to kick you out of my side, not once.”
Both of them contemplated the abyss and consequences of letting a candle and two very bored cats unsupervised for fifteen minutes. Well, not unsupervised, supervised by Sherlock, who happened to feel the same as said felines: bored and needful of excitement.
"Indeed, now…" Mycroft returned his undivided attention to Greg, "Where were we? Ah yes, stroke yourself, please?"
This urgency was John’s cue to start penetrating him, angrily. Rude. Raw. Savage. Every thrust much rougher than the previous one – “
Mycroft tried his best to hide the fact that Lestrade's cock had been in his mouth (and arse, sofa, bed, kitchen counter, bath, against the shower wall, stairs, laundry room and the pantry) two days prior, poor housekeeper, the things she had to clean for a few couple thousand pounds a week; discretion and cleaning abilities paid well among posh bastards.
A sleepy tenant ignored them for the sake of keeping the thread for the Spanish soap opera playing on his phone, seemed like the voices of a hysterical woman screaming - ¡¡PERO TE VA A PESAR !!! ¡¡TE VA A PESAAAAAAR !!! (
John couldn’t help the warm feeling building in his lower abdomen. That pair of prominent cheekbones sucking the obscenely phallic shape of the cigarette (which he hadn’t noticed until that precise moment), made him feel suddenly eager to deep throat his way down to Sherlock’s now resting cock. Since when he was willing to offer his mouth in exchange for this Adonis to look at him greet an acknowledging smile, suggesting –
Fucking hell, John Watson! Once again here you are with your damn sentimentality and understanding and ... friendship, damn you! Sherlock couldn’t stop his gaze from blinking repeatedly like trying to brush off the ideas.
John became speechless, his eyes soft with something close to disappointment, “You’re such an arsehole … you know that?”.
Mycroft’s tone was blunt, as if he wasn't the least bit excited even though this whole new arrangement was his idea.
Sherlock was fighting an internal battle to stop arching and surrender to the touch of the long fingers that held him; a small inconvenience that did not allow him to realize what to do with his arms that hung heavily at his sides. A familiar feeling of warmth and admission of defeat began to bend his will. Fucking Mycroft, damn him and his seven more years of life experience and his stupid way of knowing how and where to touch him.
– Mycroft took of his jacket and folded it carefully over a chair, followed by his waistcoat. He removed his cufflinks and gracefully folded his shirt up to his elbows, undoing the first button of it as well – “
New marks will surely appear above a couple of blackish spots, witnesses of their secret encounters over morgue tables, dessert alleys and Lestrade’s office at 3 am (oh, well…). They surrendered to the urge to kiss, an all-consuming frenzy of lust, their groans and heavy panting drowned out every other noise around them.
While both left the room, Greg took a moment to admire the rest of the paintings carefully, but after a quick inspection, the gesture of him suggested there was nothing that interested him enough to hang in a room. Mycroft could not disguise the slight disappointment to his lover minimum levels of emotion.
He rolled over and pushed Sherlock down to the carpet again, pulling off his trousers and parting up his legs, leaning to lick the wet fabric over Sherlock’s prick. His legs muscles were contracting at Johns touch. John tucked Sherlock’s pants down, and gently sucked one of his testicles, swinging it all around his mouth as Sherlock arched his back against the floor, squirming. John let it go and held Sherlock’s hips firmly to prevent him from thrusting against him.
Mycroft kept his hands inside the coat, trying not to wonder how the hell is that Greg was not freezing.
Sherlock started sniffing among his things; even though they were roommates, he wasn’t very fond of visiting Watson’s room. A pile of boxes was pushed against the wall. He opened one revealing a perfectly neat and arranged set of notebooks, each one labeled precisely as: poems, essays, thoughts, random notes and drawings. Sherlock started flipping throw the pages from all of them, one by one.
– Pleading and things being asked nicely weren’t something you could expect to leave Sherlock Holmes’ mouth. John complied and went to find another pack of rope.
His long fingers reached up Sherlock's neck, sliding up along the crests in his skull, digging thumbs on his soft temple. Holding fiercely and massaging at the same time. A silent battle of shallow breaths and narrow stares.
He held out a hand to Sherlock for him to do the same thing. Sherlocks hands were freezing cold and his face a bit paler than usual.
Something thick tugged John’s hands behind Sherlock's lower back… he could keep hugging his ridiculously tiny waist or just let himself go to land on Sherlock's crotch; either way, no matter how he tried, it was useless trying to free from it.
“Because I’m a deducing genius, you’ve just admitted it, Mycroft hasn’t argued and …” he sniffed and lowered his voice, “John might’ve told me.”
– said annoyed. He opened his umbrella and covered Greg and himself while waiting for the car to arrive –
for John’s sanity to never slip away, since when he oversaw fixing them things tend to get a bit messy.
– said a grinning Lestrade as a black car parked just next to them and he opened the door for Mycroft –
He cried out, spilling, shaking, then dropping himself next to John. He was panting, looking at the ceiling; a huge grin appeared on his face.
For his good (or bad) luck; the detective was already waiting for him in the room. He had been organizing John’s military paraphernalia as it was a beautiful museum collection.
Silence elongated for a minute longer, but their gaze never fell Realising that his efforts to continue the sensual vibe would be futile, he returned to his position next to John, face-up facing the ceiling ... indeed, it was a very interesting damp stain.
He took both ends of the rope and made a small but firm knot to it. Sherlock got the hint and gently put his foot on John’s thigh so the doctor could have a better reach of his ankle. John began tying it slowly squeezing it a bit to make sure it wasn’t too tight. He passed the loose end around the ankle and the bottom of the femur, sliding the rope line through the middle of the tie, pulling it with his middle finger securing it with another turn of the rope, locking the first knot like small padlock. He repeated the action with rhythmic but steady moves, pulling and tightening, being careful of it not getting tangled.
They finished, and he dried John covering him with their fluffiest towel saved for special occasions, leaning more than necessary with the excuse to shield him from cold. It was a surprise when John’s arm snaked around Sherlock’s waist and pulled him into a hug. A silent, magnificently sweet hug that Sherlock responded without questioning. Every few seconds, John tightened the grip of his arms, almost afraid to let go of him.
John still couldn't explain how the Holmes managed to pull off that thrilling trick of lowering their voice register at will to assert dominance. He hoped no one would decide to piss on him eventually (or maybe he did hope so?).
They forced him to his knees, well… forced is such a harsh word, more likely they took advantage of John's confusion and arousal to shove him into a kneeled position while the poor guy kept trying to breathe, calming his racing heart long enough to stop himself from coming again all over the floor.
"Fine!" sulked Sherlock, "I would've gone for sex-dungeon, but the alternative is quite picturesque."
His thoughts were interrupted by a voice calling him from what seemed like miles away as he was pulled back in the direction of his house.
- and as Sherlock submitted to the doctor’s orders, a finger was abruptly inserted in him, without any sort of preparation. Sherlock moaned in disgruntle and tried to pull up his head to reprehend John at least with his sight, but Lestrade and Mycroft held him in place. John kept moving his fingers, he was performing a perfect prostatic exam, not minding one-bit Sherlock’s feelings.
John moaned and protested; all his complaints muffled with hotspurs of semen filling his mouth. Greg’s hand prevented him from dropping anything.
John decided to relieve him of his indecision while handling the kissing and reaching for his neglected cock. It had gained an obscene crimson colour. John's new focus was making Sherlock endure long enough for Greg and Mycroft to carry on.
Mycroft slowly placed the mobile on the table and laced his fingers. It was done, although he would lend himself to this ridiculous request, he wasn’t going to fall prey to negotiation with terrorists. His demands would be heard.
Greg blushed. He did know very well someone, but it would require a lot of bribery and expensive wine.
If you've read my other works ... I SPECIALIZE IN BOTTOM JOHN! ... I strongly recommend that if you desperately need a TOP JOHN - PLEASE ask someone else, PLEASE read someone else ... I can write it but will never describe it as good as you need. I love John to be fucked. I'm so sorry! Please, stop telling me, "I hope it gets better and John fucks Sherlock harder."
Sherlock kept doing it, too busy to hear a skilled John opening the cap of a lube bottle, pulling off one of his black gloves, wetting his fingers.
Sherlock repositioned, waiting for his turn to participate, tilting his head back, opening his legs wider, holding John's head… guiding to his rising erection, not minding one bit if his long shaft was too much for John's gag reflex. He was a doctor; after all, he wouldn’t mind.
All of the different sizes with different techniques and poses. Seventeen works of art beautifully framing the perversion of which the body and human mind are capable.
From across the room, John and Greg watch stunned and still naked, almost coming untouched. Amazed at how Sherlock became soft and pliant.
As John helped Sherlock put his coat on, the sound of moving and crashing furniture with other surfaces became quite loud in the echo of Mycroft’s place.
Kissing his way up to John's ear, each by each vertebra, he whispered, “Make him come, but don’t swallow.”
John pulled back his head closing his eyes, leaving both arms hanging stiffly at his sides. He was determined not to fall into his own desires, this wasn’t a safe space anymore; there wasn’t an agreement for things keep happening outside their meeting locations when the four of them were together, watching each other’s back, keeping each other’s secrets.
John was still holding Sherlock by the shirt, pinning him down. His lips went fiercely toward the curve of his neck as his hands unbuttoned the excited man's shirt beneath him, exposing a perfect silky white torso. John would lie if he said he hadn't dreamt of doing this on repeated occasions. He instinctively rubbed himself against Sherlock's rising erection, pulsing uncomfortably below him, not daring to retrieve his lips from the spot where he was nibbling at that precise moment; not able as well to trace a long lick up to Sherlock's earlobe. He tasted sinfully sweet.
The door opened. A super confused Mycroft entered with his hand stuck in an ice bucket, balancing several bottles of water, a mission that failed the moment he realized how his personal movement-reference flesh mannequins dared not waiting for him to continue with recreational activities.
Weeks passed, and John seemed less and less ready, which made Sherlock fucking freak the hell out because (1) poor dear John, what could hurt that much?, (2) he didn’t handle well the fact that he was being ignored, it was a childish assumption to vociferate, but the truth was that … nobody should ignore Sherlock Fucking Holmes, (3) they lived together for Christ’s sake, and the silence was unbearable.
“Thank you, dear! THEY CAN’T GET WARM WITH YOUR SCIENCE TUBES!” –kept yelling as she returned to her apartment; they could still hear the echo of her voice a few minutes later.
John scoffed at the affirmation, the nerves. He thanked the gesture but surely, he stopped being pure a long time ago.
Each and every one of Mycroft's features began to contort, handpicking the best way to take revenge against his own blood.
– Sherlock shouted, all his limbs shaking and twitching, banging his own trying to scold John for his outrageous instructions.
Kindly, Mycroft declined the offer; that week was the 78th time he tried to quit, maybe this time he would succeed. After a few minutes and mesmerized by the sound of burning tobacco, he considered trying one more time for the first time next week.
He was about to put it in his mouth when he suddenly reflected on the ridiculous amount of time he’d spent naked that day… and probably several forthcoming ones.
“That …. sounds like a better plan” - agreeing with Watson was already a traumatizing action – “But don’t touch my dark gray coat”
The way his eyes closed with each drag making his chest contract, his leg bend by the knee. How much this would've helped during med school long study nights. He could have invented a new system to catalogue and explain the Lower Muscular System; 5 quids for a seat.
Where Mycroft has a minor crisis, Greg helps with it while being naked; Sherlock shares an insightful anecdote and (finally) John gets fucked.
Nowadays, that seemed to be the only thing he wanted to do; stare like a zombie to the useless images processing and numbing his brain. A doctor, such a brilliant specimen should never feel as meaningless as John Watson had been feeling, but that was precisely the problem. Sherlock didn’t know what to do about such futile and complicated matters as
After a moment that felt like hours, Sherlock’s body began tensing with the promise of release, ready to make a mess all down John’s jaw and throat, best case scenario, filling his nostrils and making him feel dizzy. Just moments before the blinding whiteness of his exploding orgasm, Greg took John’s jaw and kept him in place.
Sherlock sank onto his knees, spreading John's naked legs watching as his throbbing cock began to drip. He put his hands between John's bottom and the back of the chair, holding himself for dear life. As John hooked his leg above Sherlock's shoulder, the other stayed firmly on the floor, grounding both.
"Whoa! Hang on; I never gave my consent to participate in an orgy. That goes beyond …" Greg's tone of voice began to rise.
With a hand on his forehead, tangled sweaty curls, flushed cheeks, and lips cut from bitting too hard … the younger Holmes attested the perfect pose and scenery for a Renaissance portray; a cherub dropped to earth experiencing carnal pleasure and sin for the first time.
Sherlock grunted as his eyes rolled back for a split second. He was getting used to the incremental pain sensation and made a mental list of new and more savage ways to take revenge when it was Lestrade’s turn. His thoughts were interrupted by the sounds of steps rapidly approaching behind him and putting the same leather belt who had just hit him, in his mouth parting his lips aggressively prohibiting him from speaking. Lestrade secured it with more violence than needed. Sherlock could feel how the DI trapped a bit of his hair just for the sake of punishing him a little more.
Mycroft was already used to people coming to him in search of desperate solutions. Sometimes he liked to imagine himself as a kind of miraculous saint to whom his faithful servants, though few but loyal in the end, frequently came to his door with offerings and tokens of gratitude. His ego throbbed just listening to how the only people who had never succumbed to his "powers" were now metaphorically kneeling in front of him.
They rubbed against each other panting in anticipation. John left Sherlock’s neck for a second to attend more important matters, such as Sherlock’s lovely cupid’s bow. Their kiss was so needy, small peeks between smiles and smirks. It was sensual and tender in a perfect mix. John released Sherlock’s arms, and the detective rushed himself to wrap them around John’s neck, pulling him into a deeper but kind kiss.
Who would’ve known it was so difficult to free yourself from two excited apes when you are quite exhausted.
With what little grace and dignity he had left after his pants decided it was time to quit formalities, Mycroft rummaged among art-supplies. A leather-covered sketchbook, several charcoal pencils and a Meisterstück Mont-Blanc served him as a shield. A thin layer of sweat hurdled his increasingly tensing body, while he rolled up his sleeves.
They decided the best way to celebrate and see the finished work would be to gather in the place where everything happened.
Sherlock rested his head on John’s thigh, breathing heavily, they sure needed a moment to recompose themselves, but there seemed it wasn’t time for that:
The grip hurt. His breath shallowed. Each gasp on the brink of orgasm made him closer to lose the facade and do something he vowed not to do anymore. It was as if Sherlock allowed him to have a role beyond a simple spectator; was this some apology for being an insufferable brat? Perhaps, but before he could discern it, the clutching hand let go.
Sherlock took off the rest of his clothes in silence, until the only thing covering him from shame and embarrassment was a black strand of his own hair falling over his eyes, he sighed – “
John was on the verge of collapse, fighting with the pleasure spreading through his entire body, clinging painfully to Sherlock's waist and fighting not to make a mess with the rest of the makeshift
, but as in I didn’t remember I can’t carry my wallet between my balls and stole a couple of things,
Yes, life had been extremely generous with him asking only as payment, a youth dedicated to sports where the use of extremely tiny shorts was practically mandatory.
To make matters worse, it seemed decades of shame and regretted only got merged between willpower, secret therapy, locked diaries and immeasurable amounts of cash “invested” in booze. Despise the sickening sense of filthiness, Mycroft Holmes was convinced it wouldn’t be the last time it happened; nor that he wanted to.
For Sherlock, it seemed like his brother, who have read the greatest authors of all time, recited, written, declaimed, versed and studied in fine arts and good things, all that could be called posh was possibly in Mycroft’s personal cultural heritage… finally found his better half to fornicate as plebeians, letting the all the neighbours know of their dirty affairs.
“You’re not raping me, you’re not paying me, I’m not a prostitute, and you’re not a creep. Does that cover the whole catalogue of shameful sins you’re breaking down?”
Greg stroke Mycroft’s back inside his jacket; what the hell was the fabric this guy’s suits were made of? Goddammed Holmes’ and their perfectly tailored suits who just happen to ignite Greg’s deepest desires. Mycroft smelled of incense cologne. He couldn’t keep touching Mycroft all over; they hunted for each other’s mouths as they merged in a dance of entwined limbs and moans.
he still had in his mouth. He, of course, had not managed to leave it intact and had swallowed a significant amount that only managed to excite him more, knowing that it came from the man he was clinging to.
Greg finally slipped out and watched with tremendous pleasure as John leaned back to fuck fiercely as he stroked Sherlock's cock.
John, still completely inside Sherlock, was about to shake his hand when a panting, agitated Greg grabbed his wrist, licking the sticky fluid tasting as much as he could.
They picked Sherlock up as best they could; he was practically a puddle of moans and groans begging for permission to come.
The two ran up the stairs, stopping when they saw Sherlock standing in front of John's chest of drawers. They could not see what he had in his hands. Lestrade took the bet.
A few months ago, it was late at night when both burst through to the flat in a rush to retrieve a blood vial recklessly stolen by Sherlock from a perfectly labelled box as
“Now’s not the time to finger-point! Especially since you should be the one asking for Mycroft’s favour since you two have been sucking each other’s dicks for six months now and I’m the one who has to bear it!”
(so, so, so much!). Perfect circumference to hurt if there was no time or desire for proper preparation. If it's true that fortune favours the bold and said ex-military cock decided it wanted to invade enemy territory by introducing "peacefully" into the anatomy of another man; it couldn't be done using just one or two fingers. John Watson was something in need of a special task force operation plan.
Sherlock couldn’t stop panting and shaking from excitement, looking damn gorgeous wrapped in his signature coat as a chrysalis. John realized the tightness of his own pants was getting quite uncomfortable as a noticeable erection was ready to escape.
“Are you alright?”, it didn’t sound accusing; the question just floated behind him as a hand rested on his lower back; why wouldn’t he? He just averted a preposterous recurring thought from becoming truth.
"Greg seriously… don't make me beg, you and John had this wonderful idea of saving an old man's arse and Mycroft's right, I'm just thriving for the thrill of having your gigantic cock inside me.”
Sherlock would’ve been happy to drop dead in that same instant to stop feeling the rising wave of pain in his chest. He was sure he could have a heart attack at that exact moment, and it wouldn’t matter. How overwhelmingly heavy was the burden of someone’s guilt when you realize how your previous decisions hurt others?
- and immersed himself in Lestrade’s crotch, undoing his trousers and pulling down his pants; it was already leaking.
Sherlock glanced at Lestrade, partly ready to berate him for daring to speak like that to his precious piece of fine arse but then again, he was way too turn on to stop and think about John's feelings.
He turned just in time as a very frantic and edged Sherlock punched him on the cheek, making him trip over, just barely maintaining balance by mere willpower, anger and expectation, this was the invitation he had been waiting for ages. He was so going to seize it. John approached the detective, took him by the head and banged him against the wall. The look of shock in Sherlock’s face was incredible; what was he expecting then? John grabbed him by his shirt collar and slammed him against the kitchen table, knocking off all Sherlock’s mad scientist paraphernalia.
Sometimes the bubble needs burst only to re-inflate magnificently, and you … my dearest, keep failing to recognize that it’s ok if your bursts much sooner or frequently than mine. Now, would you please let me take care of you?”.
