Tony couldn’t believe what he was hearing. This was ridiculous. He held up a finger. “Let me get this straight—I’ve been flirting with you for two months, sometimes to an absurd degree, and you didn’t tell me to stop because you actually
He licked his lips, tried not to let on how shaky his breathing actually was, and got to work on the buttons of his dress shirt. Steve shuffled back on the bed, sat on his haunches to watch. Now, Tony was rarely self conscious where other people were involved, but when Steve was watching him like this, so intensely, it made Tony feel sort of nervous, despite the fact that he had essentially given Steve a show every day since the first time they met. This was just different, and for a second Tony thought of Steve’s strength, of the restrained power in his gorgeous body, and how if Steve were less kind, less caring, Tony would truly be at his mercy.
Hopefully, all of this would be sorted out sooner rather than later. He wanted nothing more than to be back in their king, curled up in the soft sheets, with no plans and no worries, like their last date night. That was three weeks ago though, and something told Tony he wouldn’t be getting another one anytime soon.
He could imagine this was a better situation, a genuine embrace. He could imagine that they were two lovers taking a moonlit stroll. He could imagine that Tony’s eyes weren’t filled with tears, that he wasn’t simply in need of a shoulder to cry on, and that he was happy, being here with Steve. He could imagine leaning down, kissing Tony, telling him he loved him and hearing the brunet say it in return, and that things were beautiful and perfect and good. But that wasn’t the case now, wasn’t his reality, and no amount of wishing would change it.
He braced his hands on Steve’s shoulders, pushed at them a little until the blond got the message, drew back.
Ugh. Steve hated how confident Tony was right now, how easily he was grinding Steve’s gears. He hated it because he
Tony’s breathing was a little harsh now, shallow puffs of air which told Steve he was desperately trying to keep it together. He hadn’t said anything in at least half an hour, not since he’d taken more medicine, but it was clear he wasn’t feeling any better, and he couldn’t get to sleep either. He was curled up tight at this point, clearly uncomfortable, and it made Steve’s heart clench in sympathy.
“I wanted to,” Steve replied with a shrug, and brushed a hand through his hair, seemingly unaware of the profound effect he tended to have on the brunet. He sat down next to Tony, looked him over.
“Nat’s right,” he said, though it pained him to do so. He wished they could take the simple way, but it was an impossibility. “They’ll be watching the towns and tapping phone lines. This is the only option we have.”
Tony took his words to heart. He took a deep breath, tried to get more comfortable, tried to forget about the ceaseless pain rattling around in his head. It wasn’t easy, by any means, but knowing that he had Steve here with him made it a fraction easier to bear.
Her own heart was beating fast, muscles tense and feeling a little breathless from the exertion, but it was worth it when Steve finally came, when his back arched off the bed, revealing the gorgeous column of his throat, and he let out a strangled grunt that evolved into a soft whine.
him breathe, but it was so hard. He really didn’t think he could take it anymore, and for an instant wondered if Steve was
“I had planned on doing it a little differently than this, but when does anything ever go according to plan for me?” Tony replied.
He had to keep his pace, had to balance his need to fuck harder with Tony’s limits. They’d never done this before, never tried it, and he was having a damn good time, but he still couldn’t shake the worry. Honestly, there was no reason to worry. Tony was so fucking wet, literally dripping lube, because Steve had been thorough stretching him out. By the time he even got his cock in, Tony was loose enough to fit
, and would turn out to be kind and smart and exactly what was missing from his life? Before meeting Steve, Tony hadn’t been having  a lot of luck in the romance department. He had plenty of Tinder dates and one night stands, but struggled to find a real connection, to find someone he really wanted to be with.
The ring on his left hand felt like a tether now, keeping him grounded, connected, as it so often did. He loved its subtle weight, the promise that it carried.
Tony seemed equally aware of that fact, which was probably why he suggested it in the first place. He looked Steve up and down now, somewhat hungrily, and licked his lips. “You’re on,” he had replied.
Steve’s fur was soft against his back, but his massive erection? Blessedly hard. There were plenty of advantages to having a werewolf for a boyfriend, but his huge dick was certainly near the top of the list. Steve was big in human form too, but the fact that he got
“It’s a deal. I’ll grab you a towel so you can take your shower.” Steve moved to get off the couch, straightened his clothes. They
The rest of the world was unimportant, hardly existed in their minds. All that mattered was the two of them, and the little baby cradled in Tony’s arms, and the renewed promise they were making to each other.
Tony wasn’t a religious guy, but if there really was a god, he had clearly blessed Tony with Steve’s divine presence.
Peter let out a squeal as the waves brushed over his toes and Steve lifted him higher, like a swing. “They’re always good!” Steve called back, and pressed a kiss to his son’s cheek.
Tony licked his lips. “See ya, Cap,” he said, and held out his hand for Steve to shake. He tried not to think about how it’d be the last handshake they would have for a long while.
Tony couldn’t deny that this was a wonderful feeling, maybe the best feeling in the world. He’d always wanted to be here like this, dreamed about it all the fucking time. It made his heart beat faster, but made him feel calm all the same, made him feel
Tony’s hips bucked up at that, eager for the blond’s touch. “Yeah, touch me, please baby,” he gasped. The heat that had pooled in his groin was already unbearable. His cock was hard, straining against its confines, and he knew Steve was there too, could hear it in the way his breath was getting shakier, his pulse quickening.
He still felt himself go a little breathless though, and nodded softly, stared at the buttons on Steve’s shirt. “Okay,” he said softly.
Bucky nodded in return, pulled him into an embrace. Steve seemed to sink into it, exhausted in a way that Bucky had never seen him, even when he was small and sick. He wished he could do more to help, but at present, anything he could do or say may be more of a hindrance than anything. Steve had to figure this out for himself, just as Bucky had to figure himself out, his place in the world.
The brunet laughed a little, dropped his gaze to the table. “I should get this cleaned up,” he sighed.
“You can do the whipping,” Tony said, setting the basket down so he could join Steve. “Both figuratively and literally. I can’t get the hang of baking.”
He could see the challenge forming in Tony’s mouth before he could even get the words out, saw the flash of excitement in his eyes.
“I was supposed to give it to you,” Steve said again, and Tony could see the tears forming in his eyes, spilling over onto his cheeks.
His heart jumped a little at the smile the blond gave him, at how fond and familiar it was, no annoyance, no sense of irritation or disgust, even though Tony had essentially made a fool of himself the night before. Steve hadn’t cared. He didn’t make fun of Tony then and he wouldn’t now, and that was kind of amazing, left him a little speechless.
Tony took the opportunity to switch their positions, straddled Steve’s hips instead. He bent down, kissed him again, just a short kiss, let his hands trace the soldier’s shoulders, the curve of his collarbones, let his fingers brush over his adam’s apple.
Steve let out a groan, tossed his head back as the dildo slid against his walls, at the firm, thick length of it, the steady pressure. God, it felt like so much, and knowing that they’d chosen a dildo approximately his size, knowing that this was how Natasha had to feel every time he fucked
Steve exhaled slowly, satisfied, relieved. “It was good,” he agreed, leaning over and brushing a hand over Tony’s damp bangs, settling it on the curve of his cheek. “So good. You’re so perfect, sweetheart. I love you.”
Tony made him feel like he belonged, like he was connected to something, not just drifting endlessly in an unfamiliar sea. The brunet was his tether, his anchor. Tony always showed him new things, helped him make new discoveries, and find his footing in a changed world, and he never did anything worse than tease Steve a little if he didn’t get something. He treated Steve like a person, instead of a relic or paragon like many others did, and he was always happy to see him. Tony made Steve feel welcome, like he wasn’t just an intruder in everyone’s lives. He made everything easier.
The bruise forming on his hip from where he’d been pushed into Howard’s desk stood out, angry and purple against the brunet’s tanned skin, and it made Steve’s heart clench.
“Yeah, yeah,” Steve said, and pressed a final kiss to the top of the brunet’s head. He rubbed Tony’s back for a second, and shuffled back off the bed. “Take your nap, you evil genius.”
His vision started filling with tears, and his throat felt tight, like hands were locked around it. He almost wished they were. He wished he was dying, or that he was already dead, because he fucking deserved it. It would make everything easier. Maybe everything would be better without him. Tony hated himself, hated every decision that had led him here. He was a failure. He’d always been a failure, and would always
, even after their extreme rough patch, after facing astronomical odds. He hoped he’d never lose him. The last few months had been a welcome relief, a reprieve from years of stress and fear, and they’d grown closer, understood each other better than before. He wanted to hold on to that relief as long as he could.
Tony attempted to track Steve’s flip phone, spent the better part of the evening configuring his own in order to find its companion. He worked fervently, couldn’t help but feel that time was of the essence, because it was, but it was to no avail. The search was unsuccessful. Either Steve’s phone was off or had been destroyed in the crash, making it untraceable. Instinct, the deep sinking feeling in his heart, told him it was the latter. Tony cursed his life for the hundredth time then, shed more angry tears that night than he could count.
“How are you feeling?” Steve asked, scribbling lines onto the sketchbook he’d bought himself two days ago. He’d missed holding a pencil in his hands, and although he hadn’t really drawn anything yet, it offered him a little more comfort than he’d been giving himself all this time.
Thankfully he only had to push a little before it was all over, properly. They’d already cut the umbilical cord. He’d been too out of it to pay attention when it happened, so the mess of placenta between his legs was cleared away in favor of prodding hands, checking him over for injuries. He didn’t have the energy to feel awkward about it. He didn’t have any energy at all.
“I like it because it’s part of you. And, big surprise, I like you,” Steve said, and his tone was light, but earnest, and it soothed Tony’s worry a little.
. It just wasn’t working. It felt like he wasn’t getting anywhere, like he wasn’t making any progress. He let out a frustrated groan; the pressure in his pelvis was intense.
“I love you,” Tony breathed. He turned, wrapped his arms around the soldier in a tight embrace. “God, I fucking love you. How are you even real?”
He was being a brat now, two years into their (more or less secret—pretty much the whole world knew except for Tony’s father) relationship, sitting by the bar in Howard’s summer villa in Sicily. Somewhere along the way, Steve had become Tony’s liaison(babysitter), at the request of Howard, when he couldn’t figure out what else to do with his life, and spent a lot of time around Tony anyway, so that worked out just fine for them, made things easier when it was clear Tony was interested in Steve, and Steve had no plans to rebuff his advances. There were a lot of convenient excuses to be together, and a lot of
By the haunted look in the blond’s eyes, it was clear Steve had asked himself the same question over and over.
But Steve wasn’t done, not even close. He shifted his position a little, readjusted, and kept fucking into him, hard and deep, panting, gasping softly. The blond could feel himself drooling a little, feel the saliva dripping down his muzzle, but Tony never minded, and Steve couldn’t control it, anyway, couldn’t help but be driven wild by his partner’s body, by the delicious sounds he made, the way he smelled, the way he felt. It drove him
The blond rolled his eyes, but lowered himself the last few inches, brushed his lips against the brunet’s. He kissed Tony softly, a quick, chaste kiss, and drew back. “You’re such a brat,” he sighed.
“Uh huh,” Tony replied. “Well then how did a gent like you end up with a troublemaker like me? Didn’t your momma warn you about us dark-haired types?” he asked, leaning low and pressing a kiss to Steve’s jaw.
Tony smiled dreamily at that, his eyes shut. He couldn’t bring himself to fight Steve’s praises anymore, instead let them wash over him, leave him warm and happy again. He felt so blessed that Steve indulged him in times like this, was always willing to make him feel better.
Steve’s hands wrapped around his own then though, warm, kind, and pulled the bucket away and set it down on the floor. “You’re okay,” he said. “It’s okay.”
. He was aware of his strength of course, would never give Tony more than he could handle, but he wasn’t exactly gentle either. He fucked him like he
Steve had a hand wrapped around his leg, lifting it up to spread him wider. The other hand was curled down by his cock, wrapped around the dildo beside it so he could fuck Tony two ways, fuck him good and well.
His throat felt kinda tight, and he sniffled, his nose twitching in the way it often did when he got too emotional and was trying to hide it. “Well, good luck down there,” he said. “People in Washington can be real assholes, I’ll tell you from experience. Try to stay out of trouble.”
“Oh trust me, I do,” Tony said, and patted the star on Steve’s chest lovingly before stepping away. He gestured for Steve to get moving.
Steve didn’t have to hesitate to give in, to give up. He didn’t hesitate to take the path of least resistance, like he fought against so many times in his life, like he’d fought against months ago, at the start of all of this. Not anymore.
old, but that didn’t matter. All he knew was that he liked it, and Steve was way too good at using it.
“I don’t know how you’re going to figure all this out, but you will,” Bucky insisted. “You always figure it out.”
Tony let out a little laugh that was more of a relieved sigh, and Steve smiled softly at him. God, Tony loved him. He scooted up a little, and their lips met.
Steve was still trying to find the right words to apologize. He’d tried already, more than once, but it didn’t seem to be enough, because Sam was still admittedly cold to him, still kept his distance. They had barely spoken in the last week and a half. Nobody was in high spirits in general, though. When was the last time they
“I’ll head to Tunisia immediately,” Vision announced as Rhodey helped Tony out of his seat. “If I find anything helpful, I will inform you immediately. Hopefully there will be something to lead me to them.”
He couldn’t even remember what he was reading about at this point. It was one of his mother’s classic novels—Wuthering Heights? Yeah, that was the one. It wasn’t his kind of thing, really, but it was what he had on hand. He knew at the start of this that he wouldn’t really be able to focus on it anyway, so he’d picked something random. He liked watching Steve work, in general, because the skill that went into his pieces was fascinating and a little awe inspiring, and besides, he knew when he invented this little game that it would take up most of his focus.
He lifted their intertwined hands, looked at Steve with his pretty eyes, dark and full of emotion. Tony had never been that great at talking about his feelings, except with a handful of people. Rhodey could read him really well, always could, but even he took a little bit of coaxing for Tony to open up when something was bothering him. With Steve it felt easier, less painful, to admit what he was feeling, what he was thinking. That was equal parts thrilling and terrifying.
‘Only if you love me back,’ Tony had said, and Steve wondered how he could even ask, even wonder. Of course Steve loved him back. He loved him so much it hurt. How could he not? Tony was beautiful, and smart, and so unique, a star among stars, and Steve would gladly spend his hours basking in his glow. But if he needed to hear it, out loud, to know the depths of the blond’s devotion, Steve would tell him so, every single day.
He paused, took a breath. “There’s…there’s an increased chance for infant mortality, unless things get better. We’re keeping him as close to you as possible; the more love and attention you can give, the better it will be for him, but…Quite frankly, we’re concerned it won’t be enough.”
Maybe it was just the company that made it that much more impactful. Hell, a glass of champagne never tasted better than when Tony could peer at the blond through the bubbles in the glass, and the high-end dinners he had to suffer through were sweet as honey with the soldier at his side. Everything was just better with Steve around.
His patience was wearing thin. It was so easy for Steve, wasn’t it? So easy to just dream up these absurd little ideas, so easy pretending that reality was anything other than what it was. The time for dreaming had long since passed, in Tony’s opinion. They were dealing with the real world.
“You’re right,” Tony replied, turning his head and pressing a kiss to Steve’s cheek. “Just like you’ve been hoping and praying that I’ll
“I am serious,” Steve replied, hoisting Tony up a little higher. It took little effort of course, and he glanced up at the brunet. “Pick some more apples,” he ordered.
Steve watched Tony with fond eyes as the brunet tucked away the camera and added the new photo to the small box he’d brought along to keep each picture out of the wind. They’d eaten lunch out here too, some sandwiches and juice and watermelon, because that was Peter’s favorite fruit at the moment.
The pan sizzled and another wave of the sweet aroma of French toast filled the air, and Tony inhaled it gratefully. It made him feel a little better, a little more at ease. He sighed softly, and worked up the courage to break the silence. “So…”
Bucky didn’t actually know much about Tony. He’d only seen him a handful of times, had never had a proper conversation with him, and had exchanged more punches than smiles, but he knew a thing or two about people, after all these years and all the training he’d been given. Tony didn’t seem like the type to suffer willingly for something or someone he didn’t believe in.
Bucky was at a loss for words when Steve emerged from the office and explained the situation. He wasted no time standing still, instead relaying his tale alongside swift steps back to the throne room, where he would beg for an aircraft to take him,
Steve’s fingers tugged at his hair, and it was the scientist’s turn to moan. It sent chills down his back, and he was getting hard too, could feel himself start to strain his own shorts. He didn’t want to touch himself quite yet though, wanted to leave that to Steve, like he’d requested. He continued his ministrations, sucking his gorgeous husband off at a measured pace, fondling his balls until he could feel them start to pull up a little tighter, could feel the thick cock in his mouth pulse a little.
Steve did just that. He reached around them, adjusted Tony’s blanket with his free hand, continued holding his hand with the other.
Steve’s face was wet with his mate’s sweet slick when he pulled back completely, sat on his haunches. It was practically dripping down his chin at this point, messy and shiny, and he wiped it off with his hands. He cleaned it off of his fingers, sucking the thick liquid from each digit, savoring it like a goddamn dessert. Tony always produced so much slick, when Steve ate him out like this. There was something about it, maybe the prolonged stimulation, maybe Steve’s insistence, his fervor, the way he’d growl deep and low, and dig his fingers into his soft flesh that just made him
If the handshake lasted a little longer than appropriate, and their fingers separated at the last possible second, that was something they planned on keeping just to themselves, something they didn’t want to share with the world.
Pepper had to go back to California for some business, and Happy accompanied her, so Tony really didn’t have a choice but to patch things up with Rhodey anyway, unless he wanted to be entirely alone(which sounded kind of appealing, but he knew it was impossible, given his condition). It ended up being easier than he anticipated to patch things up, but it wasn’t entirely painless.
“I wasn’t sure if it’d be worth the risk,” he said. “I thought it’d be better to just let you go, and I thought I could, but… But when you came for me last night, without hesitation, and you
“Well, if you say so,” Tony said, somewhat amused. The praise only stirred more heat in his belly, and Steve’s hands on him made him squirm a little, made that burning under his skin grow that much hotter, fill him with so much desire it was almost overwhelming. He licked his lips, took a breath to steady himself before he did something stupid like admitting defeat. There was still a game to be played, after all.
minded him making a mess on her. She fucked the soldier slowly through the aftershocks of his orgasm, praised him, stroked his thighs softly.
, and if Steve liked keeping him, if he wanted to keep him in that way. He thought it’d be really nice, and if he weren’t so damn
Tony didn’t have the energy for pleasantries. “What’s the problem?” he asked instead, brow creased with worry.
Steve didn’t think he could handle that right now, with the way he was feeling, how fucking ready he was to cum. He just—He just needed that extra bit, just a little more, just…!
A desperate little whimper left his throat, and he squeezed his eyes shut, but that was when Steve pulled out abruptly, let Tony take a full, heaving breath.
That didn’t stop him from frowning to himself as he hit ‘send,’ and waited patiently for a reply. He would just have to get over it.
His lack of response wasn’t good enough for Steve. He leaned forward a little further, and Tony finally turned his head to look into the blond’s eyes. His blue eyes were soft, beautiful, and earnest, and something about them managed to settle Tony a little again, made him relax. His mate’s next words helped more, soothed the aching in his chest.
He didn’t think he could take seeing Steve off at HQ, so he would say goodbye now, and spend the rest of the afternoon holed up in his room nursing a drink and watching reruns of his favorite show. That was an okay coping mechanism, right?
this much, if he didn’t still love you. He’s angry, and fuck does he have a right to be, after what we did, after so much, but you’ll make it work. I think he wants you to make it work.”
“If he hated you, he wouldn’t have had your kid,” Bucky reminded him, bracing a hand on his shoulder. “I don’t think he’d put himself through this much,
Steve’s arm wound around Tony’s back, held him gently. Steve’s body was warm against his, his cologne subtle and the aroma familiar, stunningly good. He had good taste, and the benefit of Tony’s deep pockets. But Tony would probably love whatever he wore, because it was
Tony could never resist breakfast foods, especially with blueberries in them, and Rhodey knew it. “Yeah,” he replied, and took a step forward.
“Are you kidding me right now?” he complained, slipping his sunglasses back on. He couldn’t help but let out a breathless laugh though.
He hadn’t known Tony was even following him, let alone that the sudden pressure at his back that almost made him drop his phone belonged to a handsome, caring and charismatic guy, who he’d fall for body and soul in a matter of weeks.
His hand slid up Tony’s back, brushed through his hair, the pads of his fingertips ever-so-softly grazing his scalp, and the brunet moaned a little into Steve’s mouth, grasped at the blond’s t-shirt.
“We can go get it if you want,” he offered, anxiously flexed his fingers against the steering wheel. “Besides, I’d like to get a hold of the fuckers who disrespected you, team them a lesson.”
He looked….well, homeless, for one, as his whole team did, but sicker too. Of course he was still a walking slab of muscle, with poster-boy features, but his skin was a little paler, sickly, and his hair long and kind of dark, and his beard clearly needed attention. He looked unkempt, a little wild, a little
had. Their problems, their stupidity had affected him, no matter how hard Tony fought against it all, tried to keep that from happening. Peter was sick, just like Tony, but he was just a little baby, born mere hours ago, without the strength to fight it like Tony could. He needed love, and affection, and physical contact, and worst of all? Tony’s wouldn’t be enough. He needed Steve’s, his voice, his presence. They both did, and he wasn’t fucking here to provide it. He may
“Well, let’s hope it’s in working order,” Rhodey sighed. He paused, eyes scanning over the holographic data in front of them once more. “If it isn’t, we should consider calling Vision back in. Hell, we should call him back in in general. He and Wanda need to know what happened, if they don’t already. Ross will be wanting to hear from him. He’ll probably want him on the search squad.”
Steve sighed a little, frowned softly. “At least one of those things should give you an idea of why I kept my feelings to myself, if not all of them.”
Steve’s hands were heavy and warm on his bare skin, sliding down his shoulders and settling on his ass. Tony buried his face in the plush pillows, his heart in his throat, and let out a little gasp as Steve dragged his hips back and up, got his knees under him.  He spread Tony’s cheeks, a breath ghosting over his entrance, and the brunet shuddered.
“The next time I see Steve, I’m going to kill him,” Tony announced, balling his hands into fists. He leaned back against the couch, closed his eyes and prayed the vomit away.
His fingers tightened on Steve’s shoulders, and Steve moaned in response, threw his head back and started pumping cum into his mate.
“Well don’t worry, your breakfast sandwich didn’t come with any dishes to wash,” Steve assured him, reaching for the bag. “You feeling okay enough to eat?”
Tony thought it over a second. The power was certainly out, but they hadn’t really been doing anything anyway, and it was kind of nice, being wrapped up in each other in the dark. It was a little, dare he say it,
He really didn’t want to admit any of this, hated even thinking of it. It made him feel small, and weak, to give any of this voice, but maybe he had to, to make Rhodey understand. Tony dropped his gaze to the table.
He’d been halfway to a meeting at SI when it set in this time, and though he knew Pepper would be irritated that he had to skip, he wouldn’t be much help doubled over the conference table with the heel of his palm pressed against his eye socket. Happy had turned around to take him back to the Tower while the scientist sank further and further into the back seat, his jaw clenched and brows knit, the pain steadily rising.
Tony raised a brow at him, disbelief clear in his eyes, though he smiled a little. He adjusted his grip on his bags. “Uh, thanks. I’m Tony, by the way.”
He wouldn’t admit it, but his eyes were already searching for his gift. He didn’t like to admit how much he actually enjoyed getting gifts, especially from Tony. He had so little when he was a kid, and nowadays, he had so much. It wasn’t the quantity, or the price of Tony’s gifts that excited him though, it was because Tony always thought so hard on his gifts, tried to give Steve something he would really enjoy. He knew Steve wasn’t a flashy guy, didn’t have a particularly expensive taste except when it came to a few things. He always knew just the right thing for Steve, and it made him feel…seen. It made him feel like Tony knew who he was, who
Tony took another look at the bags he’d brought in. The trip to the grocery store wasn’t really pleasant today: the store was packed, the customers rude, and his favorite ice cream flavor was sold out, so he may have been a little grumpy now, a little more irritated than he wanted to be. Hell, he’d almost gotten into a fight with this old bird in the produce aisle. She had been a real bitch.
remember though, and he ended up describing the garment in too much detail, rambling a little, stumbling over his words.
His companions didn’t have any words to comfort him. Natasha felt just as guilty as Steve was looking, had for a while now, and Sam was still trying to process the whole thing, couldn’t imagine the desperation Tony felt for him to agree to something like this. It was tough to take. Yes, they were no longer wanted, and could come home, but…but what was it all for?
Tony had practically caused a scene only with his expression that day in the Banquet Hall. He skipped the pleasantries at every opportunity, did his best to scandalize the other guests, and
The relief in Tony’s eyes was clear even in the darkness. He smiled just for a moment, but then his face grew sullen again, and he stared down at Steve’s chest. His heart was still hammering anxiously, his thoughts running a mile a minute.
The doctor sighed softly, dropped his eyes to his tablet. “Your child is relatively healthy,” he started. “No birth defects, a good pair of lungs and good heart, ten fingers and toes, and the cute button nose to go with it.” He tried to keep his tone a little light.
He suddenly felt a little uncomfortable in his own clothes, in his own skin, as if the fingerprints, the grips of those bastards were still on him, as if they’d marked him somehow.
He gently stroked the tufts of hair at the nape of his partner’s neck, and stepped towards the tree. “Just pick as many as you can. I’ll handle the ones higher up.”
later. Clear and present was Steve, laying under her, his face red and cock hard, his hair disheveled from their makeout session, from her kissing him, fingering him open. Her hands were smaller than his, so it took longer, took
“Holy shit, I’m sorry!” Tony had said immediately, brown eyes wide, staring up at Steve, and they swept up and down the blond’s form in a way that made Steve feel empty-headed.
Steve didn’t waste any time. He slid his hands down around Tony’s thighs, spread his legs wide and lifted them a little to get a better angle, and started thrusting up into him. One of Tony’s hands reached back around his shoulder to steady himself, and the first deep slide of the blond’s cock had them both groaning.
Tony calling him daddy always did something to him, always made him lose control a little, fill him with possessiveness, and this time, after all that had happened today, it really did it. Tony was
Tony didn’t want to be rude, so he followed suit, pushed his sneakers off by their heels. He almost lost his balance bending over to pick them up but took a deep breath, focused his vision and managed to put them at the door.
Steve wouldn’t bring it up for a while, not until the fires of Tony’s anger dampened a little more, until they were
“There’s a problem. There’s no easy way to say this, so I’m just going to come out and say it. The effects of your Bond Sickness, of the strained relationship between yourself and Captain Rogers, were not limited to your own body. The sickness and its symptoms have passed to your baby as well. His temperature is raised, and he’s showing cold symptoms: runny nose, cough, fussiness.”
“No, you’re not,” Tony replied. He hopped out of his chair, wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist to keep him from walking away. Steve walked a few steps regardless, until Tony sunk his heels into the floor and pulled the opposite direction. “Steve, stop!”
Steve didn’t waste any time then, slipped his hand in Tony’s pants and freed his cock, and Tony did the same for him, and a rush of excitement went through him at feeling the familiar length. They didn’t have any lube so spit would have to do, so he got his hand good and wet, and Steve’s hand wrapped around his, to stroke them off together.
It’d been an hour since they crashed, since they were shot out of the sky, and sailed directly into the ground. The initial impact was hard, and the gunfire they’d taken put everything out of commission. They only had about a minute to recover and evacuate the jet though, and almost didn’t make it to safety. The cracked fuel line and shot electrical system went up in flames pretty quick, quicker than anticipated.
“I bought it two months ago. Figured this was better for right now,” Steve explained, pulling the door open for him. “Plus, the bike’s pretty loud and it’s late.”
of you. I know you’re going to yell at me, damn me, and if you could, you would send me away, and I’m
Plus, Steve, admittedly, definitely wanted to look at him some more. The whole event was out of the ordinary, especially considering he’d walked this path tons of times before. He was curious to see where it would lead him.
By the time he whimpered out “Fourteen,” his ass was on fire and his cock hard and leaking in his pants. He had tried to grind down against the bed a few times already, to relieve the pressure, to get some sense of pleasure, but Steve wasn’t having it. He’d pinned Tony down with a firm hand on the small of his back, all dominant, all business as he spanked his bratty boyfriend.
“’Get on the bed,’” Tony said mockingly, but kicked off his shoes—he wasn’t an animal—and climbed on his bed. It was pretty high up, conveniently the
Steve never had a problem being quiet. He was a fan of plenty of quiet activities, liked moments where nothing was going on and everything was easy and calm. He also, unlike Tony, happened to like rain, and thunderstorms. There was something about the low rumble of thunder, the splashing of raindrops against the windows that soothed him.
He pulled back, opted to fuck Tony’s mouth instead, and Tony seemed just as eager for it, slid his tongue against Steve’s shaft, tried his best to keep up with the brutal but controlled pace that Steve set. His hands fell up over the edge of the bed, fingers twisting in the fabric of Steve’s pants, lacking the coordination they usually did, but
“Beautiful. Perfect,” Steve insisted, a hand dancing up Tony’s back, settling in his dark hair. He tugged on the strands the way he knew Tony loved. Seeing the way he leaned into it, the red spreading over his cheeks made Steve feel warm too, made him shift his hips a little, keenly aware of the weight of Tony on his lap, the gorgeous curve of his ass. “Let me take care of you, baby. Let me make you feel good. Do you want that?”
The brunet didn’t want to back down, but at the same time, he wanted this over with. He’d been humiliated plenty for the day, and wanted nothing more than to get away from Howard, to get as far away as possible. Thank god the villa was as big as it was; he could find plenty of places to avoid the bastard.
Although Tony knew it was impossible, the fantasy, one of many, honestly, was charming enough to have him leaking a little from the head.
“I’m not giving up,” the blond insisted, though he seemed to be doing just that, thrusting forward slowly, and pulling back, savoring the slick slide of the brunet’s walls clenching around him. God, he really wanted to give up, wanted to chase his pleasure, to hear Tony cry out his name, and to make him feel good, finally push him over the edge after so long.
I kinda wanna write more about this AU at some point, either for kinktober or in general, but we'll see lol. Either way Bi King Steve Rogers absolutely gets pegged by his beautiful wife Natasha Stark!! It had to be done.
“Sounds about right,” Tony replied. He looked at Peter too. “He’s just entirely empty battery, huh?”
Tony drew back then, sat up straight once more, a little more serious in his tone. “But right now I’d kinda like to take a shower. Is it okay if I use yours? I probably smell, and my hair feels gross, and it’s bad enough I left my germs all over your bed.”
“I spend my time on you because you’re worth it,” Steve replied, smiling a little, though his cheeks were probably turning pink too. “And I’m not perfect. I don’t like washing dishes,” the blond joked.
“No!” he said before he could stop himself, and his breathing got faster, rushed, and it turned into a little sob. Damn it.
Eventually, Tony gave his answer, and he didn’t have to say anything to give it. He gestured for the blond to lie down beside him, and Steve rolled off of him immediately, settled at his side.
“You probably feel terrible. Do you want to go to my place, or should I take you home?” The soldier asked, praying that the answer was the former. He didn’t want to leave Tony’s side. Not tonight.
“I wanted to,” Tony replied with a shrug. His leg was fidgeting under the table and he hoped it wasn’t noticeable. He’d regained control of his face, but still heard that little voice in the back of his mind, feeding him little lies. Tony swallowed some champagne to drown it out.
But it pleased him, knowing that Steve would stick up for him, protect what little was left of his honor. The same couldn’t be said for some of his previous partners, particularly the first, so long ago when he was still at MIT, so it was nice knowing that he was loved, that Steve thought he deserved only the utmost respect. The rest of the world didn’t seem to think so sometimes.
Steve let out a little gasp. He could admit the thought of Tony stuck on his lap, filled with his cock for hours on end was more than a little enticing. It must have shown in his eyes because Tony tilted his head up a little, grinned at him.
!” he whined, almost a sob, and jerked in the soldier’s grasp. “Ugh, I can’t! I can’t, I’m gonna cum, I’m gonna—!”
Tony slung it over his eyes and forehead, let the heat dull the sensation of pain. Steve curled an arm over his midsection then, tugged him close again. The nausea had abated a little. Tony didn’t think he’d throw up again, which he was very thankful for, even if his throat was raw now and his skin no doubt blotchy. It wouldn’t be the first time he’d vomited so hard that the capillaries in his face broke.
The pace picked up, got a little frantic, honestly, like it always did, because there was always the sense of never enough, that no matter how close they got or how good it felt, they’d never gotten their fill of each other, of the need to be together, and it was equal parts frustrating and beautiful. Tony’s voice got a little higher, breathier, and that always went straight to Steve’s cock, and he let out a whimper, muffled it in Tony’s shoulder.
Steve’s things, that Steve wanted him to now, was amazing. Maybe all the shit he’d been through last night was for a reason. Maybe he had to make it through the bad, needed that extra push, and this, his brand new
Steve nodded in affirmation. “Okay then. I’ll get you a fresh towel. I can also wash your clothes, if you want…”  His cheeks reddened a little then, and his eyes bounced to the side of the couch and back. Whatever he was thinking was getting him flustered, and Tony could feel his smile growing a little, trying to figure out what the blond was going to say next.
“I’m yours,” he replied. “I want to be yours. There’s nothing I want more,” he said, and he brought Tony’s hand to his lips, kissed his knuckles.
Tony and Steve were alone at the bar now, the guests sufficiently distracted by the live band starting up again after their break. The bartender had left to eat his dinner.
exists!” Tony growled, wiping the tears from his eyes. “If Steve still had it, he would’ve responded by now. Either it’s out there somewhere in the wilderness, or that shit stain Ross has it and is building a beautifully detailed case against me as we speak!”
They sat in silence for another minute or two before she announced she was getting tired, rubbed her eyes. He supposed there wasn’t much else to talk about. The show on the television kept droning on, little more than uncomfortable background noise, until they’d had enough.
Tony tried to take his words to heart. Steve was being sincere, he knew, but it was hard to get over that voice in his brain, telling him otherwise. He pushed it down, focused on the task at hand, on diverting his negative feelings. “I’m gonna kick Fury’s ass,” he said.
“Even though our Honeymoon has been interrupted about twenty times?” Steve asked, amused. He shuddered a little under Tony’s deft fingers.
He felt the gasp catch in his throat as he caught sight of his gift. They were a matching pair of cufflinks in gold, pristine, polished, and beautiful. They weren’t any regular pair of cufflinks, though, because Tony had plenty of them, and Steve knew it. These were special, and instantly became Tony’s favorite pair.
He didn’t think he’d ever be able to put into words just how much Steve meant to him, how much their relationship did. It wasn’t perfect by any means, and he was still terrified that it was swiftly coming to an end, but he really hoped it wasn’t. He really hoped he had a lot more time, all the time in the world, and that the blond would continue to be his. He didn’t know if he could go back to living a life without Steve in it. He thought he’d rather die before that happened.
He’d been surprised they fit on it together at all. Steve wasn’t small, by any means, and Tony was of average height, even if he looked small next to Steve. Even pressed together they took up a lot of room. There was a reason they had big beds back at the tower.
Tony licked the cum from his fingers, but huffed at his words. He’d initially felt a little floaty, and it took a few seconds to gather his thoughts, but then his attitude came back.
But part of Tony couldn’t help but worry. Some deep part of him seemed to be terrified right now, a tiny itch scratching and clawing at his heart, only growing bigger as time passed, and Tony tried and failed to quell it.
That wasn’t to say there weren’t any threats at all these days, and once in a while a mission did still spring up even though he and Steve were technically retired, but most of the heavy lifting was left to the rest of the team.
“Look, sir, with all due respect, Tony’s right. We’re doing everything we can,” Rhodey replied, standing himself. He braced Tony’s shoulders, guided him into sitting down again.
Tony looked down into his little boy’s face, finally noticed the flush on his cheeks, the tiny furrow of his brow as he slept. He was sick. There was no way around it, and there was nothing Tony could do about it.
Steve fucked into him at a moderate pace, long, deep strokes that had his back arching, hips wiggling, trying to get more, trying to chase those incredible moments where the blond’s fat cock would press against his prostate and chills would run through him. “Shit, yes, more…”
After putting on a little cologne, he reached in his shirt drawer, slipped his hand under the pile of shirts in the left hand corner, picked up the little jewelry box he’d stashed there a few weeks ago. He debated giving Tony his present now, but thought it’d be better to wait until after dinner.
…!” Tony gasped, squirming beneath him, fighting to take more, to turn that teasing into something more substantial, something to quench the fire in his core. Steve had him pinned down hard though, would probably leave bruises, and he was looming over him, so Tony could hardly even hump the bed properly, couldn’t get enough pressure on his aching cock to finish himself off.
Tony couldn’t get his mouth to work. He sat there, clutching his child, wide eyed as Steve spoke, standing but a few feet away, for the first time in over half a year.
,” Steve confirmed, and he pulled back so he could look down at Tony, run his fingers down the brunet’s chest, grip his hips once more. “Look at your pretty cock, all ready to cum, aren’t you? Hah—oh fuck—But you’re not even touching yourself, always waiting for your daddy to tell you it’s okay, huh?”
“You can leave your germs wherever you want, I’ve got a pretty good washing machine,” Steve replied, a little amused. “But absolutely. I’m sure you already found where the bathroom is…?”
, fucking his mouth until it was a sloppy, wet mess, and he could feel himself climbing over that peak, his cock twitching as it slid in and out of Tony’s pliant mouth. “Shit, oh, I’m—I’m gonna—“
If he was in trouble, how could Tony help without jeopardizing everything they’ve worked for, everything they’ve kept hidden? And it was only a few short weeks until the baby would come. How could Tony handle another unpredictable situation at this time? He wasn’t sure. He needed to know though. He needed to.
Tony’s eyes were deep and dark, and it was so easy to be swallowed up by them now. His lashes were wet, clumped together, and one had fallen on his cheek, swept away by his tears. He looked at Steve as if he were the only good thing left in the world.
Steve set the drinks and bag down on the coffee table in front of Tony. He took off his jacket and shoes next, put them in their proper place.
Steve’s apartment was kind of exactly what Tony anticipated: small, well decorated but humble, and warm and inviting.
“The United Nations has been monitoring communication lines,” T’challa finished for him, nodding a little.
Steve leaned down into it as if pulled by gravity, his eyes fluttering closed. He was relieved, honestly, that Tony didn’t seem to be mad at him. He was worried about it the whole way home, the whole duration of the mission actually, and although Tony seemed better now, he didn’t think the subject was so easily forgotten. Though Tony’s grip on him was firm, welcoming, Steve still couldn’t forget the tears he saw on the brunet’s face, the salt he tasted on his lips from them now, mixed with the champagne he’d been sipping on before Steve arrived. He had a
“No you won’t. You won’t be taking the fall. I’ll be the one taking it, like I always do,” Tony replied bitterly.
But if they weren’t? If the team was in danger? What if something disastrous had happened? What if they’d been caught, or worse,
He’d only been gone for two hours this morning, but with the way Tony was turned from him, how small he looked curled up on the balcony chair… It was clear as day that something went wrong in his absence.
Steve, as always, remained the best blessing. The fact that he was spending his day laying here keeping Tony company when he could be doing literally anything else meant a lot. It’d been over a month since Tony’s last migraine, since he needed company like this, but he still felt like a nuisance. Steve obviously didn’t think so though.
“That’s fifteen,” Steve said, voice low as Tony took in harsh breaths. He ran his hands down the brunet’s ass, massaged his round cheeks. He knew if he pulled Tony’s pants down they’d be red now, and the thought filled him with satisfaction.
“My Tony,” he growled out, nipped at his shoulder, and it made the brunet’s eyes roll back in his head.
Steve never talked much like this. It took a lot of focus on his part, and he wasn’t fond of the way his voice sounded, was always put off by it. He always said his wolf voice was foreign to him, didn’t sound like himself in his ears, and it bothered him.
Steve into anything, he sure as hell (in his opinion) didn’t have to act happy about it when he didn’t get what he wanted. Because he was a brat. Steve didn’t always give in, didn’t want to encourage Tony’s bad behavior, (because let’s be honest, he had to learn at some point) but sometimes Tony won. What choice did Steve have right now? He couldn’t let Tony keep acting out. He was starting to make a scene, honestly, and that was the last thing any of them needed.
On top of everything he’d brought upon himself in the last few months, that hurt most of all. He’d been given so many blessings, so much to be thankful for, and he’d corrupted all of it, hurt everything and everyone he loved.
Steve didn’t seem convinced, but didn’t press the subject any further. No need to start an argument about it—He liked Tony’s height as it was, because he fit perfectly in Steve’s arms that way, but Tony had always been a little sensitive about it. Steve couldn’t blame him; before he’d gotten the serum, he was an embarrassing 5’4” so he wasn’t a stranger to short jokes or being looked down on, literally.
Steve let out a light laugh, and his face turned a little redder at the praise. Tony thought it was adorable.
. He was willing to try now, if it meant Tony’s behavior would improve. He arched a brow, lifted his chin. “You wanna bet?”
him to keep his hands off, took any and every opportunity to get a little frisky, would gladly drown in the sensation of the soldier’s hands on her, his voice in her ear, his lips on her lips.
Steve held him a little tighter, his heart warm and full with Tony in his arms like this. “No thanks required,” he replied. “You needed it, with everything going on lately.”
“I doubt we’ll be that lucky,” Tony replied, rubbing his aching back. When was the last time he felt comfortable in any capacity? He wasn’t sure. He heaved a sigh.
He regarded him with fond eyes, couldn’t help but feel a little fluttery and pleased on top of his embarrassment, his guilt from everything that had happened.
Around the corner he could spy the entrance to the kitchen, and he assumed the bedroom and bathroom were down the hall. He also spotted an easel tucked away between two shelves, and wondered briefly where Steve kept his art supplies. It was a cute place, clean, but clearly lived in. It was very different than his own home (or homes, plural). It felt intimate and beautiful and secret, like a place to hide, instead of a lavish mausoleum like he was used to.
felt tight. Steve still could hardly contain his moans, keep his pace slow and steady against the slippery, smooth heat wrapped around him. Tony was whimpering beneath him, face flushed, hair disheveled. His eyes, when they were open, were dark, kind of glassy, and his lips were parted, red from biting, from trying to stifle his voice.
her to be so careful, wanted to feel the full brunt of her thrusting, of the dildo sliding in and out of his smooth, wet walls, sending starbursts of pleasure through him. His cock was leaking like a faucet between them, and every so often her belly brushed against the sensitive head, just enough pressure to drive him more wild, and fuck, it was building and
In hindsight, he should’ve given up partying all together. Parties never seemed to turn out well for him. It was at a party that he’d met his first boyfriend, at MIT too. That had turned out to be an unpleasant nightmare, which he was lucky enough to be rescued from by Rhodey.
Either way, he was getting his reward now, because Steve’s hands slid down his bare thighs, one braced behind his knee and the other curled around his length. Steve’s hand was absurdly warm, and big, and Tony couldn’t help but let out a little groan at the first touch against his hot, aching cock.
idiot, and…and we love him, don’t we?” Tony asked. Whether he was asking the baby or himself wasn’t entirely clear.
“Last night, the Quinjet was spotted in Italian airspace, departing from an old factory. Our operatives pursued the rogues southward, across the ocean, engaged them. The jet went down in northern Tunisia.”
Why did this kind of stuff happen so much? Why did his life always seem to be spiraling out of control? Why couldn’t he just be normal, be strong, like everyone else? He asked himself a hundred variations of those questions during their car ride, each variation harsher than the last, more self-dejecting. He’d always been good at making himself upset. That never seemed to change.
. It was only in bed that he made desperate little noises: noises that the public would be shocked, scandalized even, to hear, but that Steve got to hear all the time, got to enjoy. The blond prided himself on turning the genius into a babbling mess on occasion, the fact that he
“That makes two of us,” Steve sighed. He put his hands on his belt. At this point, he wasn’t sure he had any redeeming qualities to pass on to his son.
The logo on the side of the cups and the bag told him they were from a local place, maybe a Brooklyn specialty that Tony had never heard of. He rarely found himself in small businesses, especially since leaving MIT, but sometimes he thought about them, about those quaint little shops on street corners with honest, hard-working people, with dedicated customers and a sense of community. He thought about what it’d be like to belong to a community like that, to be himself, honestly, without the pressures of a title or name or a fortune big enough to fund a small country.
Steve drew his hands back then, grabbed the bottle of lube. “Then be a good boy for me, baby, show me your pretty hole.”
“Shoulda grabbed it,” he lamented when Steve settled in the driver’s seat. “Really liked that one. Bought it in Malibu.”
Steve tried to push away his thoughts, before his feelings got the best of him, so late at night. It wouldn’t do him any good, playing pretend.
“I’ll stop, I’ll stop, I promise, just let me cum, please Steve? I can’t fucking take it anymore, I really can’t,” Tony replied, and his voice was so sweet, so earnest, that Steve couldn’t really deny him anymore.
He bit his lip, looked down at his baby bump. Tony let out a little breath. “Just…get back to me, sweetheart. We need you.”
Steve regarded him for a moment, tried to think of what to say. He twisted the towel in his hands anxiously, swallowed hard. There was a beat of silence. “Look, Sam, I know you’re still mad at me,” he started.
Steve loved it whenever Tony was vocal in bed. He was always so well spoken in front of the cameras or during meetings, always knew just what to say or do. It was only when he was losing himself, either through emotion or sensation like now, that he got more tongue-tied, that he started repeating himself, saying whatever came to mind, whatever he
of him, and a lump grew in his throat. The memory was still so vivid, so harsh, and Tony hated it so much. He struggled to force it back down. “I—I just want you to know that,” he added.
“There’s always been speculation. Even when we were still in the same country, there was speculation. Let them talk. They’ll keep each other entertained.”
His regret, his self hatred, only heightened when they made it to Wakanda, and he’d heard what Tony had done.
individuals, Tony stood out like a flashlight in the dark. Steve had been drawn to him like a moth to the flame, and although it was all initially quite innocent, with him simply being curious about Tony and wanting to get to know him, somewhere during the following parties and dinners and visits to Howard’s mansion Steve was getting his heartstrings tugged by those deft (and pampered) little fingers.
They pretended to be surprised. “What?” Tony asked, purposefully widening his eyes. “Wh—where? When?”
He barely slept. He needed less sleep than the others to begin with, but now, with all of this on his mind, with the sense of urgency, he had half a mind to trek on ahead, to forgo sleep entirely in favor of travelling. He was a super soldier, and Sam and Natasha weren’t though. They just physically couldn’t keep up with him. He tried to keep it in mind, knew he had to, but couldn’t help but pace, irritated, anxious, whenever they stopped to rest.
, like he’d wanted to say those words for so long, just as long as Steve had wanted to hear them. He spoke with conviction, and it was in his eyes too, in his expression. He meant the words, and Steve knew it.
He tried to keep his voice calm, even, but he could hear the concern in it, the low hiss of panic. He continued. “
Oh yes, he’d heard all about Tony’s terrible ex-boyfriend, and a little about one of his ex-girlfriends too. Steve had never had the pleasure of meeting either of them, which was to their advantage, because the blond wouldn’t hesitate to introduce them to his fist for all the terrible things they’d put Tony through.
There wasn’t much upstate in the way of big cities, or even entertainment from what he’d seen, but there were places like this, the occasional thriving local business that became a staple for nearby communities. The orchard and cider mill here was a local favorite, according to google, and had the best fresh apple cider in the state. Steve had found it after a few minutes of searching, and Tony agreed to check it out, intent on either proving or disproving the claim.
“You know I don’t like screwing around with the tracker, just in case they have managed to get past my firewalls, but if I have to, I will. You don’t get to disappear on me now, after everything. You call me, Steve Rogers, or you’re gonna have another thing coming,” Tony joked. It wasn’t very funny.
Steve had rushed here as soon as they landed on the other side of the Compound. There was no time to change, or to make himself more presentable beyond what he could on the flight over. He could think of nothing else but this moment, of apologizing, and hoping with all of his heart that Tony would be merciful. Steve would sign the Accords in the morning, agree to follow their demands, and so would the others, because there was no fighting the inevitable anymore.
Natasha sighed. “We don’t even have a way to warn Wanda about all of this. They’ll be looking for her too.”
Steve let out a little puff of air, overwhelmed by the amount of emotion that stirred in his chest. His smile grew, small and earnest.
“Take off your shirt for me, doll,” Steve muttered against the brunet’s throat. “Can you do that for me?”
here, just the two of them, and although they were alone together a lot, on afternoon visits or in between dinner parties or events, their isolation was so much more apparent now, more keenly felt, with it being so late and
to be a fucking joke! They fucking crashed? Oh my god, I told them to recalibrate the retro-reflective panels,
Steve had lots of practice dealing with Tony’s less than respectable behavior, with his little games, but even he couldn’t always easily subdue the brunet’s defiant nature. Sometimes those chaste touches had to turn to something more, when Tony really tried his patience, like he was doing now.
He tried not to be upset. He knew a thing or two about being busy, about meetings or missions running longer than they should. He’d been late to plans more times than he could count, but for the most part, they were just on normal days, so it didn’t really matter. Today, though...Today was special. He couldn’t be blamed for the sinking feeling in his stomach, for the way his eyes were starting to get misty.
him, splitting him open, filling him so much, and fuck, it felt so good. His heart beat was thundering in his ears, and every inch of him felt like it was on fire, like he was going to shatter, and Steve didn’t let up. He just kept
Steve understood thankfully, and never considered forcing Tony to breach the topic. It made him a little nervous too, not for himself, but for Tony. If his parents decided to cut him off, to punish him somehow for the way they felt about each other, Steve had very little to offer him. He worried about it, sometimes. He would do his best to take care of Tony, naturally, but was concerned that he wouldn’t be able to make him happy, that he would have to settle, to live without the beautiful, expensive things he was so used to. Steve thought Tony deserved the world, and never wanted him to go without.
The longer he waited, his forehead pressed against the window, the glass vibrating softly from the insane bass spilling out of the house beside him, the more upset he got, and by the time Steve got back, he’d shed tears again, and struggled to stop. He couldn’t stop until he saw the soldier’s figure approaching, and then rushed to brush them off his face.
Peter laughed a little, waved one hand furiously at the camera, the other tightened in a little fist. ”Cheese!” he said.
The soldier thought on her question for a second, tried to decide what position he wanted, drinking in the sight of her above him. Normally he preferred being on his knees, face down, ass up when getting pegged, but Tasha was so fucking gorgeous tonight, stunning in her lingerie, that he didn’t want to miss a second of staring at her, of being able to touch her.
If only things were different, so long ago. If only none of this had ever happened. If they were still together, maybe it could have all been good. They could have been carefree and eagerly awaiting their little bundle of joy. Tony wouldn’t have spent nights lonely and struggling to sleep. He wouldn’t have spent his days feeling sick and in pain, with his neck burning so intensely he didn’t remember what it was like not to feel pain there. Steve could have held him close each night, reassured him, made him feel safe and loved, instead of overwhelmed and abandoned. Maybe they could have been
Steve let out a little grunt, and his elbow dropped slightly, and the line he was painting came out jagged.
Time dragged on that night, after they discovered the situation. Tony was on edge, which meant, naturally, that Rhodey was too.
“Peter it is,” the midwife agreed, at the side of his bed. “Come on, Peter needs to get cleaned up, and you need to push again.” She leaned down and began to pull the baby from his arms.
“You—you can wear some of mine while you wait for them to wash and dry. Only if you want to, of course.”
Tony thought he was going to die if they didn’t get to it in the next half minute. Steve looked so gorgeous, standing tall and naked, his bangs hanging in his face, his massive cock standing at attention. His mouth practically watered as his boyfriend climbed onto the bed again, fit himself in between Tony’s legs. His big hands settled on the underside of Tony’s thighs, pulled him closer so his legs were splayed on either side of Steve’s waist. His touch was gentle but firm, grounding, and suddenly, Tony got emotional again.
Tony felt oddly like a tourist, looking out the window during the drive, and he felt like a tourist standing in front of their destination too. The lake house was out of the way too, but still close enough to the city that the occasional high rise building and the other commonplace establishments of a city weren’t out of reach. Here, they were practically nonexistent, replaced by small, original homes, some with small yards, picket fences, and others obscured by acres of trees or wide open fields, barn houses and farms. He got the sense that the pace here was a lot different, a lot slower than downstate.
He let out a loud sigh before he could stop himself, so preoccupied with his thoughts. He grimaced in the dark as Steve stirred behind him, and the arm around his waist tightened a little.
“I love you too,” Steve said, and he couldn’t help but let out a soft laugh, relief in his tone. “God, I really, really do.”
stared, whether they admitted it or not, and Steve, either oblivious or too polite to comment on it, said nothing about it, didn’t even seem to notice.
“I’m sorry!” he sighed, slumped back against Steve’s chest. “I’m sorry I acted like that, I’m sorry I’m always acting like that, I just—oh fuck, I-I just like to…it makes me feel good to do it,” Tony admitted, sounding wrecked.
It was a gorgeous dark blue, smarter than big bold red white and blue, because Steve would be going on stealth missions now, and it wouldn’t do him any good to stick out like a firecracker on the 4
“Love you, Steve, love you filling…filling me so good. God, it’s so fucking hot, you know that? It’ll never
Neither did Sam. He hoped never to have a blow up like that day again, for any reason. “Do you… Is there any news from the
“Well, you were always the stupid one,” Bucky sighed, when Steve ran out of words, standing outside of the throne room. Sam and Natasha walked through the massive double doors to relay the situation to T’challa.
“I don’t care if he thinks it’ll work! I’m not sending him to Europe to have secret meet ups with Wanda. God, do you even hear yourself? If he gets caught…”
“I know,” Steve replied. He stopped at a tree to his left, braced his hands on his hips and looked it up and down. “This one looks good,” he said.
Steve’s heart did a flip. He was at a loss for words for a second. Tony was sharing a part of his past, a connection with his parents, which he so rarely talked about, with Steve. He was offering a part of himself to Steve, in a way he wouldn’t for anyone else, trusted Steve with it.
“I’m sorry,” Tony found himself saying before he could stop the words from pouring out. “I’m sorry for making you come. I sh…should’ve called the police or something,” he said, realizing that Steve was
Tony didn’t know what to say. What the fuck was he supposed to say? What could anyone say to hearing something like that? His breath caught in his throat, and Rhodey set a hand on his shoulder, but it didn’t help him breathe, didn’t help him understand. Why was this happening?
Tony settled in the passenger seat of the warm car, let his head fall back against the seat. “Ford,” he mused, catching sight of the logo on the steering wheel, and he brushed a hand over his face. “Of course.”
Apparently last night’s sleep troubles had more of an impact on his boys than Tony anticipated. There were a few toys spread out over the living room carpet, so an attempt to play had been made, but sleep had apparently overcome the two of them.
Tony would admit to seducing Steve, if asked. He touched him whenever possible, saved his best smiles for Steve, made sure he looked extra nice when the blond came around. He would eat his popsicles in the warm summer months
“Which one of these looks the best to you?” Steve asked as they walked down the first row. He wasn’t sure exactly which tree to pick, which one suited him the best.
Celene kept talking. “He’s not going anywhere, we’re not gonna take him from you,” she said. Her Beta scent was sweet and calming, and Tony managed to believe her.
Steve felt the same way. He was terrified of losing Tony, of losing the life they had started to build together. When he awoke in the future a few years ago, he felt entirely lost, and alone, stumbling along a memory-littered path, unable to reach out and form a connection, unable to find his footing. It took so long to find a sense of peace, to stop dreaming about the past that he could never return to. The day the Avengers were formed, the day he met Tony and the others, Steve finally found a sense of hope, and now he had so much more. He had a home, not only a physical one, but a home for his heart, and he wouldn’t trade it for the world.
He could smell his scent halfway down the hall already, beautiful and warm vanilla and whiskey, mouthwatering and comforting like no scent Steve had ever encountered, and that, alongside the words he was hearing, the secret Tony was sharing with none other than
, giving him what he wanted, what he needed. People rarely did that, unless paid to, and it made Tony’s heart squeeze in his chest.
He didn’t read physical books often, but the location made him kind of nostalgic, eager to capture those few easy moments of his childhood. He’d had a pretty hard childhood despite his wealth, more bad memories than good, and he never wanted to go back to those days, and the years of confliction and pain and self-hatred and self-
Tony’s skin felt burning hot, his pulse elevated, the pool of lust in his belly sweeping through him, making his breath come out in little gasps. He was close, could feel it, couldn’t stop the whine from spilling out of his throat when the tension finally snapped.
Peter’s sudden whining at his side pulled Tony from his reverie, and he blinked his burning eyes a few times. He flicked on the lamp on the nightstand, leaned over to pull Peter out of the bassinet as he began to cry.
Tony threw his head back at that; it sent a spark of pleasure right up the base of his spine, shocked his system. He didn’t think it’d take very long to get off today, with his mind clear and body relaxed and his husband’s hands, his
Tony brushed back Steve’s bangs, leaned over him a little, his knees spread wide around the blond’s midsection. “What do you want, honey?” he asked, his voice low and sweet.
But apparently Tony had changed his mind, because this time, Steve was treated to something a little different than usual, something better.
He waited, and waited, and waited. He tried to distract himself, ate dinner, re-folded the new clothes in his baby’s closet, and tried desperately not to open the flip phone every few minutes. An hour passed, and there was no word from Steve.
“I can’t, Jim,” Tony replied, shaking his head, his eyes shut and brows pinched. “I can’t, I—I can’t do it—“
,” Steve said, and it turned into a little bit of a whine that gave her a rush of satisfaction, knowing how much he was enjoying it, how this gorgeous, wonderful man belonged all to her, relied on her to get what he wanted, what he needed. She’d do anything for him, and knew, without a doubt, that he would do anything for her, had proclaimed so at the altar a year and a half ago, and had never faltered in his promise.
. It was a little hard to think, presently, except for how he wanted more, how he wanted Steve to fill him, to take him, to
“How about,” Tony started, and he leaned in closer, so that no one could hear him. “I warm your cock for a while, just sit on that big fat dick, until you actually can’t handle it anymore, and have to fuck me?”
Jesus, that was an insane thought, a crazy fantasy. Sometimes Tony couldn’t believe the kind of stuff he thought up, and often wondered if he was some kind of delinquent. Like honestly, did other people think of such absurd things? He couldn’t have been the only horny bastard in the world. He didn’t really mind the title, though, especially where Steve was involved. What was wrong with being young and in love? Nothing at all, if he had any say about it.
“Turn around,” he said, and scooted back an inch or two as best he could without falling off the bed.
“I know,” Tony replied, and he grimaced a little. “I don’t really wanna go home yet. You sure I can’t just hide here forever?”
, and maybe he could admit that talking to each other again was doing more good than harm. If all off that progress was suddenly thrown out the window, if there could never be any more, if he really, truly could never see or hear from Steve again…
Tony hummed a little in response. Now that he was with Steve, his body had settled down a little, or maybe was simply out of adrenaline. He felt kind of drowsy. He was still sad, still miserable, and his stomach was doing flips, but at least he was with someone he trusted, someone he loved.
“Come on, sweetheart,” he said. “Don’t you want it? Don’t you want me spread around you, filled up with you, like I’m supposed to be?”
Tony’s side. Was there news? Nothing substantial, unfortunately. Certainly nothing that could help them at the moment.
It smelled like him, like his cologne. Tony had smelled it often enough to recognize the scent anywhere, and he would gladly drown in it. He tilted his head, breathed in deeply as Steve walked around the car to the driver’s side.
Steve rolled his eyes a little. “Ha ha,” he replied. “Just trying to get your eyes right. It’s so hard.”
They more or less sat in misery together. Steve took slow sips of his tea, tried to find comfort in the peppermint flavor, but it did nothing to soothe his wandering mind. He couldn’t help but reflect on all of his mistakes, all of the choices that had led him here. God, if he had only been willing to try it all a different way, to
God, there was so much of it by now. It was a hell of a mess they’d have to deal with later, wetting the sheets, making everything sticky, but that was evidently just how Steve wanted it. He didn’t have any complaints about it, in fact, was encouraging it, and Tony couldn’t protest.
Naturally, Steve cut him off by swallowing him down almost to the root, enveloping his cock in wet, intense heat.
“That’s it, that’s it, come on, Tony! Keep going, keep pushing, you’re so close!” she said, and there was excitement in her tone, and he knew she wasn’t just saying it to placate him.
It was true. He doubted there was anything Tony could do that would truly turn Steve away from him, that would ever be powerful enough to permanently negate his affection. The way Tony made Steve feel was incredible, and sometimes a little overwhelming, and full of trouble, but he wouldn’t trade it for anything. He’d realized that today, when that Maximoff girl gave him his vision.
[We don’t really have a choice. You can hate me all you want after the baby’s born, but until then we have to stick it out together.]
So yes, it was safe to say that Steve Rogers was panicking right now, pacing back and forth in the small clearing they were hiding at for the moment, cursing himself and every god out there for his misfortune, for his fucking never-ending punishment, like he had been for at least fifteen minutes now.
wreaked havoc on his body. The change in air pressure made his bones ache, made him irritated and uncomfortable, and made it harder to think. Tony
Natasha laughed, gave him a smile, and nodded a little. “Ain’t that the damn truth. Alright honey, how do you want it?” the brunette asked, let her deft fingers travel down his shoulders, cup his pecs. He had a hickey or two on his skin, near his collarbone, just as her own neck was marked up, and the sight of it sent heat pooling between her legs.
“Well, then I suggest we get going,” she started. “There’s no point in waiting around here. No one’s going to rescue us.”
He followed Tony to the fruit stand, put a hand on his back, ready to play. “You think you could outlast me? You can’t go three days without begging to have me in you,” Steve said quietly, leaning in a little.
When Tony wasn’t being productive, in any fashion, it pissed him off, made him feel like a failure, and Steve knew it. Tony had said so much before, and the blond had argued that there was nothing wrong with taking time for himself, that he
It wasn’t an accident that Steve had left himself out of the equation. He didn’t know if he’d get to come home, if he would properly be in his son’s life. Did he deserve it? Did he still deserve the love of his mate, of his child? He hoped so.
Steve nodded a little. He thought about his own neck, and the bond mark there, still inflamed, still painful. The pain in it had abated just a fraction, but not enough to feel comfortable or to touch easily. He hoped that with time it would feel better, but he wasn’t sure.
Steve gently grasped his hand, gave it a reassuring squeeze. He brushed his thumb over the band-aid still clinging to his skin. “That’s alright with me. I’ll wait as long as you need to,” he replied, and there was promise in his tone. “I’ll never touch you without your permission.”
They looked at each other for a moment, and Rhodey was relieved to see some affection slip back into the brown of Tony’s eyes, into his scent. He was glad the hostility was more or less gone, and that they could carry on normally. They didn’t argue or fight often, but it was always a relief when it was over, and things went back to normal.
Tony loved Steve with all his heart, knew he’d never love anyone more, and the fact that Steve felt the same, that he’d told him so, suddenly made Tony forget all about the shitty turn the morning had taken. It felt like a weight had been lifted off of his shoulders, off of his heart, and he knew that was what Steve intended. He knew he could count on Steve to pick him up when he fell, no matter how hard, and that? That was pretty amazing.
“Yes,” the blond replied, gasping a little, already a little breathless, even though they were just getting started.
“Good,” Steve replied. He brought a hand up, brushed his fingers gently through Tony’s sweaty curls, and shifted a few moments later, prepared to get up. His clothes were practically ruined at this point. He’d have to send Tony over to his room for new clothes. “But we’re kind of gross, and we forgot to lock the door.”
“Can’t get enough of it, can you honey?” Tasha purred, leaning forward a little, watching the blue in Steve’s eyes turn a little darker, a little hazier with the building pleasure, his bangs swept across his forehead. Fuck, he was so gorgeous.
Still, mountains of paperwork and meetings didn’t mix well with taking care of a ten month old. Most days, if he wasn’t careful, and didn’t have enough caffeine, Tony was out like a light by 8:30. He didn’t really mind, because he loved being a parent just as much as he loved being Iron Man(that role had taken a backseat for a long time now which was a blessing and a curse) but sometimes it was a little much, especially when beforehand, he was staying up well past midnight. A lot of things had changed, which was just the nature of parenthood, but sometimes it wore Tony down a little more than he wanted to.
“Yeah. See, statistically, their missions last two hours, two hours and forty-five minutes tops. I added two hours buffer time after that before even checking in, but I wasn’t getting anything back, and I kept texting and then I called, and then I called
The question took Tony off guard, but it was a pleasant one. Of course he’d thought about it. When he came to terms with the fact that he was carrying, that he was truly having a baby, it was something he started thinking about all the time. He started with a pretty big list of names, nothing concrete, which gradually shortened, especially after finding out the baby’s sex.
Tony stuck their new fridge magnet in the pocket of his cardigan, got a little comfier. “Ready for home,” he agreed.
Steve loved when Tony played with him like that, when he got him pissed with his little games, even if he wouldn’t admit it. The thing was, Tony was always sweeter afterwards, more demure, because he’d gotten his way, and Steve more often than not gave it to him just to see the gratitude in his eyes, to see it in his smile. Today Tony wasn’t riling him up, couldn’t if he tried, because that softer side was already here, just under a desperate, kind of needy shell, in a way that went much beyond the physical.
The Kimoyo beads on his bracelet began to glow, vibrated softly, diverted his attention. He lifted his wrist, and raised a brow. “A priority update from the United Nations panel,” he explained.
“Steve, I don’t know what to fucking tell you. That won’t work. There’s no way,” Tony sighed, rubbing his temple.
He had the day off, and so did Steve, and although they had plans to go out, the weather was kind of miserable so they cancelled. It didn’t matter really, because being here, curled up on the couch with Steve sprawled on top of him instead, face tucked against Tony’s chest was just as good if not better than any plans they’d made. He was wearing his comfy clothes, they were ordering Chinese food later, and reruns of his favorite show were playing on the TV.
. A couple of decent conversations the last few days hadn’t changed that. “This whole plan of yours is insane. God, when’s the last time you had a plan that fucking worked?”
himself to Tony. Steve would always be there for him, in whatever capacity he wanted, or needed. Even if he could never confess his true feelings, would have to settle for what he had, he would gladly bear the burden. Tony had quickly become the most important person in Steve’s life, and so it didn’t take more than a moment of consideration tonight for him to hop out of bed, get dressed, and to come find him.
. Yes, Tony liked the sound of that. He’d do anything for Steve, take anything for Steve, no matter how hard or how impossible.
Steve let out a breath, couldn’t help but shift a few inches, a hand bunched around the blanket beneath him.
,” Steve replied, mimicking his tone. “But I happen to like it, so there’s no need to get defensive about it.”
took it gladly instead of world-shattering events and threats that left him battered and bruised and feeling miserable.
She was a little terrified too, honestly. They’d been so careful the last few months, tried to hold it together, and the new normal they’d created for themselves had just been spectacularly disrupted. They were in danger, had cut it pretty close, and it wouldn’t get any safer now. Wakanda was a potential sanctuary. They’d have to work hard to get there, harder than she preferred.
They took a second, just to really look at each other, to let it all sink in. They had a lot to be thankful for, and hoped never to take it for granted. Eventually they broke eye contact and Tony smiled a little, slipped his glasses back on and looked at their basket.
back then, we all did. You didn’t push us into anything. I’ve been blaming you for everything, because…well, because it was damn easier than thinking that I was a fool, that I should’ve just bit the bullet and done my time. I still believe in the team. I still want to do good, but…maybe this wasn’t the way to do it after all.”
Tony didn’t say anything else, but also didn’t protest when Steve guided him towards the apartment building.
“Ssshit…f-feels good,” Tony sighed when he had the coherence to, when the blood stopped rushing in his ears and he could focus on the low heat filling his belly.
He let out a little breath, leaned down a fraction, and pressed his lips against Tony’s for the first time.
“Roger that, Cap,” he replied, tried to keep his voice light, but it didn’t work. He was well aware of the waver in his voice, how pitiful he sounded, and how pitiful he probably looked. He hated being pitied.
Steve sat up, brushed a hand through his hair. “You could never disappoint,” he replied, pulling Tony forward by the arms a little.
When bratty 21 year old Tony Stark humiliates a group of party-goers for the millionth time, his big, beautiful boyfriend Steve (28) has to teach him a lesson about bad behavior.
Steve was thinking on similar lines. Nothing could be done from his side, according to his mate, but maybe Tony would be willing to find some middle ground, for the others. Maybe Tony could strike a bargain, minimize their sentences, or maybe find a way to avoid Secretary Ross finding out at all. Maybe he would find a way to arrange a secret meeting. Then again, maybe he
“I wouldn’t want to hold you like this if you didn’t have any skin,” Steve mumbled casually. “And then where would we be?”
“Oh, you’re a bastard,” Steve replied with a sigh, but pulled his arm back, ready to take care of the groceries. He knew there were some things that had to be refrigerated, because he’d put them on the list himself, so he knew there was no leaving it for later. He wasn’t surprised Tony had tricked him like that; it wasn’t the first time. Not that he really minded. It wouldn’t take long to put the things away, and then he could rejoin his mate and child in their impromptu nap.
“Mm, as long as it takes for either of us to give up,” Tony replied with a shrug, and stepped away from Steve, inspected a crate of fresh strawberries at the stand a few feet away.
“I also got us some breakfast sandwiches. Normally I cook breakfast or just eat cereal, but I didn’t want to make too much noise. You were really out, but I didn’t wanna wake you.”
Tony didn’t need to be told twice. He laughed a little and got to his feet, stretched and looked out the window. The rain hadn’t really settled, but it hadn’t gotten worse, which was a blessing.
Steve had been so deep in his thoughts that he didn’t hear, or smell, the man walk into the room. The blond hastily shut off the water tap, grabbed a towel to dry off the mugs. He was more than a little surprised that Sam was awake, and furthermore, that he wanted to start a conversation, and it made his heart jump in his chest a little. He tried not to let it show.
Steve, apparently thought so too, based on the ridiculous spurt of cum that filled Tony, warm and deep and oh so good.
“My pleasure,” the blond muttered, resting his head against Tony’s, smiling a little. Tony was starting to sound like himself again, more confident, more at ease, and it settled Steve. He was glad he could help, could make Tony feel better again. “You know I’ll always be here for you, right? I’ll always be here,” he said softly, and he meant it.
Tony wasn’t strong enough to stop Steve from moving, but Steve could sense his intention, and stopped in his tracks, frowning towards the door. “He can’t keep doing this to you, Tony! He needs to be stopped!”
“Wakanda,” Steve said, though he didn’t sound excited about it. He let out a sigh, knowing exactly how difficult what he was about to suggest would be. “If…if we can get to Wakanda, T’challa can get us a secure line. We can call Tony, figure something out. The last email we received said Bucky was in the next phase of recovery. He could vouch for us if we need him to.”
have dumped a glass of wine on someone’s shoes when his father wasn’t looking, and Steve had witnessed it all through the crowd, because it had all happened in the span of 10 minutes, shortly before Howard introduced the two of them, and Tony spent the rest of the evening finding new and interesting ways to garner Steve’s attention, to wrap his fingers around his heartstrings.
Steve cut him off by spreading his cheeks once more, spearing his loose, wet hole with his tongue, licking and sucking with even more fervor than before, quick and merciless, an onslaught of sensation. Tony couldn’t help but whimper at it, high and sharp, because of course, it had him leaking even more slick, which the blond gladly lapped up like it belonged to him.
His memory was a little hazy, but not spotty in the least, and he was definitely sober now. The buzz of alcohol was gone, replaced with the same melancholy he usually found, as well as the throbbing in his skull. That didn’t compare to the embarrassment, the knowledge of how he’d acted a few hours ago.
“Just admit it,” Tony replied, turned to brush his lips against Steve’s. “Just admit it and you can have me, I’m all yours.” He rolled his hips ever so slowly, as torturous as it was, and tried to ignore the urgency growing in his core in favor of dragging it out so damn slow he thought he was going to die. He needed Steve to break though, didn’t want to give up the game.
Tony tucked himself further into the couch, his elbow on the arm rest, hand over his eyes. “Steve? Hey, I know I might just be overreacting, or maybe you’ve taken a page out of my book and are giving
He tried not to think about it now. He was safe for the moment, in a bed, with Steve, and that was all that should matter for a few hours.
“Yeah,” Tony replied, slipping his hands out of Steve’s in favor of running them up the blond’s sides, curving around to trace his abs, the ridges of muscle there, not as well defined simply because he was relaxed instead of flexing, the muscle pulled taught, but still impressive, beautiful, like every inch of Steve’s body.
with Steve. At least, Steve hoped he did. Or was he really just speaking to Steve out of necessity now, for the baby? Would he ever look fondly upon or
He liked pushing Steve’s buttons too. He liked pushing everyone’s buttons really, found it absolutely satisfying to rile other people up. He liked making things up, playing with the truth, or simply laying out facts, using his superior intellect to make people second-guess themselves or to get angry with him. He
“I am happy with myself,” he replied when questioned, even though the movement made him a little more desperate too, and he had to reach up to brush hair from his eyes. His curls were somewhat of damp with sweat, and he was sure his face was flushed by now.
He was lucky that he always had a few quarters in the pockets of his jeans for phone calls, alongside his ID card, or else the night would have been even worse. He’d taken the card out to pay his cab driver(of course he wasn’t going to have Jarvis drive him to a party. He wasn’t a fucking kid anymore) and shoved it in his jacket afterwards, thought nothing of it, and with all the excitement, he’d forgotten all about it until now. That was
“Fuck it, don’t stretch, just—I need—“ Tony couldn’t even finish his sentence. He let out a groan of frustration, rocked back against Steve’s firm grip. He really should get stretched, because Steve was just fucking big, but then again, he already felt loose, knew his hole would open right up for him, let him sink in to the hilt. The quicker Steve got in him, the quicker Tony would get to cum. He would deal with the burn later.
