Atlas put her book down and looked and Sherlock with tears in her eyes. Sherlock stood in the centre of the room as Atlas tried to get past him to her room.
"Since when did you become the philosophical one? I thought that was reserved for Aunt Harry," Atlas said back. "And Aunt Eurus."
THE final surprise was one that neither of them knew was coming. As they re-entered the living room they noticed a big picture shaped package wrapped in brown paper and string. Walking over, Sherlock unwrapped the package carefully as John came over and looked over his shoulder as Sherlock looked at a tag.
"Hey." John said as he looked up from the TV before adding. "There's some leftover spaghetti that Mrs Hudson made on the side." Atlas was surprised and somewhat scared by John still choosing to care. She was confused as to why he would care so much and the tension began to build again. Swifty she deposited her things in her room before coming back into the kitchen. She heated up the food in the microwave before wading over and sitting on the floor by her dad's feet.
"But you did, you should have had time to see each other and I feel really bad because I haven't even been back with you a year and I feel like I'm taking up too much of your time and you should be at home with Rosie, not here with me and you should be smiling and you shouldn't be crying and you should be celebrating Rosie coming home from school every day because she needs that and you should be with Sammy because his parents and sister are dead and we're his family now and the world is so cruel but I'm okay and you should just leave me alone to be here and I'm n-" Atlas rambled.
"There is a flower hanging out your jacket pocket and a photo on the mantelpiece in the hall of a young child and inside the frame is a note left by your late wife." Atlas began. "I could go on, but I don't want to."
"You listen to me, you will pass out." Dr Aduba said again before Atlas took the mask and Dr Aduba helped her.
She felt herself toppling and before she knew it she had her dad holding her up. Then he was lifting her back over to the bed and setting her down.
"Christ. You have a beautiful heart Sherlock." John said through his tears before Sherlock scrunched his nose and looked at him. Sensing this, John sat up a bit and looked down at him.
"That would be nice. And I just had a nap." Atlas laughed looking at May and Xerxes as they hopped up onto the bed, whilst Sammy sat next to Atlas and wrapped an arm around her shoulder. She rested her head against his shoulder.
There was a brief pause of quiet. "Atlas?" John asked before Sherlock left and led him through to the dark blue room of Atlas'. She had a double bed, bookcase, nightstand with lamp, window seat and little desk with a laptop on it.
"Come on deduce it." Sherlock smirked, Atlas rolling her eyes. She scanned him for evidence of where they might be headed.
"It would be an honour." Mycroft smiled as he sat in a chair by the bedside. He opened "Midnight's Children" by Salman Rushdie and began.
"Yeah, I'll have a look for it and then we'll watch it on Sunday." John said, smiling as he put a hand on top of her head.
"I have been scared. I have been so scared, so worried. I thought when you came that I was going to be an awful dad. Both times. And I was afraid of my sister when she was going on a little bit of a killing spree."
"Baking normally or by reading a good book," Mycroft smiled as Atlas nodded before looking at her dad.
"I swear to god, Sherlock. If you've gotten another one of your brother's minion's to drive us to our new house, so help me go-" John said before he felt a calming hand to his thigh.
"I'm good," Sammy smiled. "I'm actually really good. I'm happy and this is a pretty good life at the moment."
"Oh Sherlock," Mrs Hudson whispered. "You raised a wonderful daughter and are continuing to do so. Its not your fault."
"No, you need to let me check your wounds." John said pushing her lightly by the shoulders back down onto the kitchen chair. He darted off and got his medical kit from the lab and came back out. Kneeling before him they started an explanation.
"Papi? She calls her dad Papi." Atlas noted quietly as she sat with her book. Sherlock raised his head and looked over at the girl, studying her curiously.
I promise, I can actually write I just use this space as somewhere to store this work because sometimes ideas just need to get out my head and onto paper and then this happens.
Sherlock reached out his hands as soon as he had his hands on the fur of the dog he'd pulled his blindfold off.
"There's your answer," John smiled as Atlas looked back at them with a smile, Sammy looking in the window. Before long, they all crowded themselves into a little booth, Rosie wedged between Atlas, John and Sherlock sat opposite, smiling.
"Yes?" Sherlock asked putting down his rucksack and coming down to sit beside her, removing his shoes.
"You've had Mrs Pertwee on your back, your papa's dad shot himself, Harry and Jo staying with you and now this?" Sammy added.
met." Sherlock said as he looked between the two. It was clear he'd been watching a while as he turned his head to look at them.
"Scrabble." Atlas answered before Eurus hopped onto the bed next to her and they sat opposite Mycroft, who pulled the hospital table between them. Atlas rested her head against Eurus before they began the game.
"She's cooking tea. She was cleaning up my experiments off the table yesterday. And took the eyes out the oven and put them in the cupboard. Totally ruining the experiment I had set up." Sherlock somewhat whined before John gave him a look and they began their walk to their flat.
"We both did," Mycroft said coming in and Atlas looked at him, bursting into tears. "Oh, sweetheart." He gathered her into his arms and just stood there. "Come on, sit down."
Atlas picked up a book from her book shelf. It was The Two Towers by Tolkein, a personal favourite in the genre. Then she made her way into the living room, her chest still sitting heavy as she sat down in the living room.
"Listen to me. I'm going to do everything in my power to stop that from happening. Your too young and too smart to have a life as short. Your too important. I am
"It's alright. I'm probably hard to love. I'm a freak anyway. But the first time I had sex was with him. Why is this so hard? Pathetic. No, go away. Freak. No, go away. Smart arse. Go away. Shut up, shut up, shut up. It was too soon. What have I done?" Sherlock said, becoming more distressed.
"I'm going to go to sleep now." Atlas sighed contentedly, watching as the lady from the family Court moved in the room and took off outside. Her heels clicking softly.
"We haven't told anyone else so-" John said but Timothy just tapped his nose in confirmation as the other two men came back. Sherlock had managed to prize an expensive bottle of wine out of Mycroft's hands and replace it with a less expensive kind. When they got back they were still arguing but a pointed look from Timothy shut them up.
"I'm not going to move you onto your side. We'll ask the paramedics." Sherlock sighed before he sat down beside her. He kept a firm hand on her back and rubbed his thumb over her shoulder blades. She let out a quiet sniffle and Sherlock kept rubbing at her back.
"WHAT'S wrong John?" Sherlock asked as he made his way into the bathroom and leaned against the counter. Hands perched on the sides. John's face was etched in an unfamiliar worry as his hands were poised over his stomach.
Rosie had some sort of enhanced memory and Atlas? Well Atlas was just like her father only she found emotions easier and flourished in analysing writing.
They all sang together, giddily, Sherlock grinning up at John, smile as wide as ears. John sighed before joining in, defeated.
"Uh yeah." Atlas said as she sat up and removed a sleeping Rosie from John's chest and held her sleeping form.
"I'll check in on her when I finish up here. I'll pop in and give Rosie a kiss too." John laughed before he ate some more. "Other than that, how was your day?"
"Debatable." Atlas smirked before John, reached a hand under the table and tickled her knee. "Cruelty to Atlas Watson-Holmes alert! Cruelty to Atlas Watson-Holmes alert!" The table fell into easy laughter as Angelo appeared with their orders.
"Are you the Watson-Holmes family?" A nurse asked, coming over to the group of four in the waiting room.
"Come on then," John grinned as he put a hand to her back and led her down the hallway. "It's one of those days?"
"And you managed to tell that all from...what?" The woman asked, Sherlock looking up with ferocity. Reading into every line of her face, coloured speck in her eye. Flirting. It looked as if she was flirting, not with himself but with John. Next to him, John smiled before Sherlock looked at him. But he couldn't read him. He couldn't tell if he was into her aswell. Couldn't tell anything because his mind was so caught up on him
"Yes, you did." John said as he looked at the ground. "I'm sorry Sherlock. I never meant to do what I did."
"We're about to register him. Give him a bit more specific training but he already alerts Atlas to seizures, if she's going to faint and he's good when she's stressed," John smiled.
She'd cracked. She'd gone insane. She was her mother. She'd become the very thing she didn't want to be.
"Hello brother." Mycroft sliding onto the uncomfortable chair next to him. Both men were high profile but lay undisturbed in silent recognition. Mycroft put a hand to his brothers back in reassurance and to his surprise Sherlock did not try to shrug it away.
"Left about ten minutes ago. She's been violently throwing up and it doesn't show any signs of slowing. She's upset and keeps asking for you both." Doctor Aduba informed and John looked back to the woman.
Atlas stroked the dogs head, squatting down to the same height as the dog. She rubbed the dogs head as he licked her face.
"I do too," Sammy signed aswell. "I love her so much it makes my heart ache and I love our parents."
"YOU'VE got to be kidding me." Atlas moaned the next morning as she pulled open the cupboard door in the kitchen. "Pa! We're out of granola again!" She heard John sigh as he came through, fixing up his tie.
"Come on. It's alright." Sherlock said taking Rosie's hand as he walked over to the bedside with her. She looked at her father, Sherlock letting go of her hand, only for her to take it back again.
"Alright my rainbow." Leanne said, Sammy reeling back as she attempted to plant a loving kiss on his cheek. Finally he gave in before they could leave.
"Nice to meet you properly." Atlas said to Eurus before giving Mycroft a hug. Four and a half genius minds, knew that there need not be any explanation for Atlas' speech. And they relished the moment.
"Yeah," Atlas whispered leaning her head against his shoulder as he opened the book and started the new chapter.
"What're we going to do Redbeard?" Atlas asked as she sat in the window with a cup of tea and a book. The dog waged his tail and made his way over to lie next to him.
"Do you want me to sit with you?" John asked and when Atlas nodded he moved around to the other side, hopped onto the bed and began brushing her hair out of her eyes. As she was lying flat, her hand tracked along the mattress until she found her dads hand and she held it against her stomach before falling asleep.
"THAT'S because dad has the better sense of style." Atlas smirked as she sat at a table in Angelo's, awaiting some much anticipated gnocchi. Sherlock and John were officially married and in fashion they were not sticking to traditional marital rules. There may be sex tonight, but for now, it was dinner in their favourite restaurant with their daughters.
"Do you want to tell us about it?" John asked before Atlas stuttered a nod. "Alright then." He smiled. "You can stop if you need."
But most of all, we did not see glass corridors and riches, instead we saw friendships, adventures and the importance of making a map.
"Papa, please," Atlas said. "I love you. I know your sorta new to this all and I know it's really scary-" She paused as Sherlock, Sammy and Rosie came over and sat on the floor, Redbeard sitting on Sammy. "But, I wouldn't be anyone else's daughter."
"I trust her." Atlas said indignantly before looking over to her dads who were both nodding in unanimous agreement.
"I can't think how to do this bit." Sammy said as he kept playing sections of the chords over and over again.
"I'm glad you like it," Harry laughed, before putting an arm around her niece's shoulder. Before letting go to look around.
Placing two feet firmly on the ground, and rubbing below her nose where blood had poured hours earlier, she rose on her feet. She gathered her soft blue blanket around her in a cocoon and collected one of her special items off her shelf. Now, on recollection, she realised that Sherlock probably didn't even know it was in her possession after all these years. This little blue nose called Whisper who had been with through it all. Small enough to fit in her father's pocket as a child, she would make him carry Whisper around so that when her father went somewhere, his smell was always there. To this day, the faded toy still smelt of smelly aftershave and Sherlock.
A few yards along the path and Sherlock let Redbeard off the lead. Amazed when he called and the dog came bounding back.
"No, butitmighthelpwiththefaintinganditmightalsohelpwithsomethingelsethat'sbeenhappeningtmetoo," Atlas said gently, unaware of how much information to give her.
"Alright then," Sherlock smiled. "Redbeard." He called. "Sit." The dog sat before he let him off and the dog bounded away along the path. Torch lights lit the just before sunrise light effectively as they ascended the hill.
"If I'm really, really lucky. But probably not." Sammy frowned before Rosie leant in for another hug.
"What are we doing today?" Rosie asked, her eyes going around everyone in turn. Her light brown hair hinting blonde as it curled itself into ringlets that resembled what Mary used to have. Her bright blue eyes scanned everyone in turn. Sometimes she looked like how Atlas imagined Mary may have looked like. Any photos of the woman had been put away. John loved her but Atlas knew there was more to it, she just couldn't figure out what. As if she had done something, betrayed them.
"Uh, nothing sweetheart." Sherlock said before they continued reading. He'd missed his part of the Caterpillar and now the young girl was looking at him expectantly.
"You don't have to do this you know." John reassured making sure she was aware of the cop out if she needed to. Atlas nodded in thanks before smiling again at the man, this time trying hard to hide her emotional eyes.
"Sam," Rosie squeaked as she slipped in and shut the door. "Take Jeff. He always makes me happy when I'm sad." She shoved him against Sammy's chest and he felt himself warm. The effect was immediate and the boy's breathing slowed, John rubbing the boy's knee under his thumb.
Timothy entered followed closely by Wanda who almost immediately bustled over to Sherlock who was still sat with Rosie by the computer. Although now they had moved onto to reading "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe". This was against what John had said but when he realised Sherlock helped Rosie understand the scary parts instead of letting her think about them, he agreed to just let it happen. Sherlock explained when any monsters popped up, why the witch was evil and described Turkish Delight as a "disgusting gloop that you would never see in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory" - another book of which Rosie enjoyed to hear read several times a month.
"You don't have to apologise. I was being a bitch," Atlas said before John started to cry and she threw her arms around his shoulders. "It's alright, papa."
"No, I think we'll drive a bit more before we do. And besides, he's getting a bit of a mooch here so he should be okay," John smiled as Atlas resumed her position attached to his arm. However, he shrugged her off, rolled his shoulder then put an arm around her.
"I suppose I did and do," Mycroft said as he massaged her other hand, Sammy and Sherlock walking in.
"Robert and Elizabeth died in an airline crash when your mother was 22." Sherlock said, answering Atlas' silent question.
"Alright now, love?" John asked gently Atlas nodded before the dog, thrust his nose between hers and Sammy's headrests. "That's it Redbeard. You snuffle in Atlas' ear and cheer her up for me."
She looked over to where she was keeping all the books she had borrowed from Sherlock. They were all based on different things such as drugs and how they affect a person's mental capacity. Then she had another one on Iraq and Afghanistan, one on the "Hidden War", another based on the Freemasons. The list was endless and Atlas was thankful that Sherlock was akin to her reading styles. Then again there were also some books she'd borrowed off of John such as the Lord Of The Rings and Hobbit series. There were some more good fictional reads borrowed from him aswell.
"MYCROFT." Atlas sang as she meandered through the halls of his well established home. She passed a christmas tree into the main entrance to find her uncle waiting for her in the kitchen. Then upon seeing him she put her satchel down onto he counter and put on an apron.
"Well, I spent a lot of time in Scotland." John laughed. "Northumberland was home but really Scotland was always my true home. The place I was always hankering to be."
"Can you sit next to me?" Atlas asked before Sammy, who was still wearing a forgotten flower crown got to his feet and made his way around the bed. Hopping onto the other side, they found themselves in the same position they'd been in earlier with Atlas' head resting against him. Sherlock moved from the bed to a chair with a gentle smile.
"Okay. Tell them I love them." Sammy said as he followed John out the door but just before he left he spoke. "Oh and Sherlock."
"Okay," Atlas signed and spoke with a smile. "We'll eat, finish this episode then head out. Do you want to come?"
"You good there Atlas?" John asked as she looked up at him with blue eyes. She nodded before swinging the blanket off her because she was too warm. Nevertheless, she snuggled into one of her father figures all the more, hugging his middle somewhat awkwardly. He stroked her hair gently as Sherlock disappeared into the bedroom, giggles elevating from Rosie.
"Yup," Sherlock said. "Right, John, take these two off and find somewhere to eat so then me and Atlas can have a violin lesson."
"Grandad Timothy!" She shrieked as she entered and ran towards the man who was sat by the table writing something in a notebook, which he handed to Atlas. She studied it and nodded before she added to it some more. John peered over her shoulder and frowned at the mess of scribbles being poured onto the page.
"We have stuff to make pizza's in. You know, our own homemade ones Papa." Atlas said looking over to John who smiled as she got the mix out of the cupboard.
"We'll see you later." May said tapping Atlas thigh as she looked up and smiled. Xerxes signed his goodbye and just as soon as they left, Atlas was pulling a basin into her lap and throwing up into it.
"Anything for another Holmes." Mycroft said before turning to leave, pausing infront of the open door. "If my brother ever gets too much, you are welcome to come and see me." Atlas nodded before the man she was growing ever the more fond of left the room.
"Okay," John whispered as Dr Young moved from where she was to let him sit on the bed opposite her. "I know it's scary but I'm right here with you."
"Of course you don't," Jo smiled before Atlas moved to lean against him, his arm going up and around her shoulders. He kissed her hair before smiling at his mum who was smiling back. "Who would regret that?"
"Atlas," Ruben was trying, through the discussion. "Atlas, can you hear me?" Her eyes had gone blank.
"You'd have have had Robert somewhere if you'd have been a boy." Sherlock said before he opened the back a little. Atlas knelt next to him, a peculiar sadness washing over her.
Mycroft finally appeared from his room and Eurus from outside with Red. She'd been playing fetch with him and had now taken him inside. Everyone was quiet.
"Now, Miss Rosamund," Sherlock said affectionately as he took a seat next to her. "We got you something to try. But you can only have a little bit so your not high as a kite."
"Of course...of course I remember you. You are the wonderful and brilliant Ida Atlas Elizabeth Holmes. Who lives with me, John Hamish Watson, my partner William Sherlock Scott Holmes and her sister Rosamund Mary Watson." John said looking at her comfortingly. She gave a little laugh to his response before looking at him, teary eyed.
"In the family room." Wanda smiled. "Rosie and Sammy are going to come in and see you, then your dads."
"Just breathe, love," John reassured, a hand on hers. "It's going to be okay."  Atlas gave a whimper as John stroked her cheek. "Just breathe. Breathe with me. In and out. In and out." Atlas coughed before John continued stroking her cheek. "I know it's difficult, but you can do it."
"That and she is good with handwriting and telling you a lot about a person based on their handwriting." John added as Sherlock and Mycroft both furrowed their brows. "She told me everything I already knew about Mary and more when she found a note of hers scrunched up under the sofa."
The screen showed another date and information and it suggested that they were about to see Atlas at about one and three quarters.
Mrs Hudson announced herself at the entrance to the flat at precisely 2:43pm. She cleared her throat making Sherlock turn to look at her slightly.
Atlas smirked before Mycroft deleted the chat and erased it from ever having existed. She sat at the table, Weetabix swimming in a partnership of milk and sugar as she continued to journey through 'Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn'.
"It's alright, love," Sherlock said quietly, kissing her temple before she sobbed and he too rubbed her back. "Come on." He chuckled with a smile before looking over at John who frowned. "Your my honeybun-"
And then he weeped. Hot tears streaming down his face as he started to laugh taking a seat on the end of bed seat.
"Well, that's because you are a Holmes who is now a Watson-Holmes," Timothy smiled. "Holmes is in your blood and both are in your heart. You are your dads daughter but every now and then there's a flash of John and people don't get that. People don't understand that."
"I want to," Sherlock rumbled before untangling himself from John to sit next to him instead. They disconnected the call and hit the button for video call and Sammy picked up. He looked a mess and was seemingly in a hotel room, huddled up in a sofa chair.
our song." John smiled, ruffling Rosie's hair. Harry and Jo were still sleeping, although they had heard the shower going earlier, so they were expecting someone downstairs relatively soon.
"I mean, it's weird. If I were after the Holmes family this room would be useful. Of course, throw in Eurus and we're talking nuclear weapons level," Atlas said before smirking.
"You alright, squid?" Atlas asked laughing as the girl frowned and looked at her before leaning forward and whispering.
"Oh." Atlas said before Sherlock opened the ziplock bag. How very...Holmes of him. Unlike most people they had been keeping her in a ziplock back until they could spread her ashes or rather until they found out where they had to go.
"It must be hard on him," Lucy smiled and Sherlock just nodded. "But you seem to be doing right by him and he seemed to be happy in that video Xerxes sent me of him playing the trumpet."
There were miscellaneous thoughts through her head as she made the icing and crushed some more biscuits to sprinkle on top. She thought about all the things she had done that had caused various problems to the people around her. Her seizures were a problem - no less frightening to Rosie, her behaviours were often not good, she was needy. Suddenly, in that moment she hated herself more than she ever had. Ashamed, she realised she may have taken advantage of them, of both of them. Using them because they were there, because she need a home, because she needed support.
"John Hamish! John!" Isla grinned with flour hands as she walked towards him. "Oh look at you." She clapped flour hands on his cheek which when she moved over to Sherlock he wiped away with the wet cloth tossed at him by his mother.
Now, however, Mycroft was sat with Atlas looking at him. She had her arms crossed over her chest, her weird pyjama coat wrapped around her shoulders. She took the phone off of Mycroft and listened to the end of her father's plea.
He opened the front cover, his eyes going to what was written on the front page. He assumed Atlas hadn't seen it. Infact he knew she hadn't, she didn't need to read the book she helped write.
"So," John said quietly, taking her hand in his. "Me and Sherlock have been talking." Atlas looked at him expectantly. "We're going to take this in shifts."
"I'm sorry?" He asked looking at her confused. Her blue eyes made out that his were green through in the light before she looked ahead of herself.
"I think..." She paused to cough. "Its doing the grave, seeing my teacher, being back here, in this city and then the flashback and I can't quite seem to organise it all."
"The less time we have to socialise with the rest of our family the better," Peter swallowed. "Especilaly 'cause Damien and Kate are aye bringing Wendy and Lily."
"WHO in God's name knocks on my door at this-" Mycroft huffed as he walked to his door. He had been enjoying playing chess with Eurus when a knock on the door had prompted them to stop. He was on his guard - as, at this time of night, it truly could be anyone - and opened the door with caution. "Atlas?" He saw his niece standing on the step to his house with her best friend and he beckoned the pair inside.
"Your more than my blogger." Sherlock smiled. "Your more than my husband and more than my best friend, John. You are a piece of me. And you have been for the past ten years." Sherlock smiled, only to look up and see John give a weak, teary eyed smile. "Or is it eleven?" John laughed at that.
Everyone settled in various chairs across the bottom floor. The roof was high, stretching upwards with chairs and rugs all over the place. There were two sofa's and three chairs in various places, all surrounding a large square shaped table. Eurus sat in a chair, Redbeard curling around her feet, whilst Wanda and Mycroft sat on opposite ends of the white cover sofa, Timothy sat in an armchair and John and Atlas were sat on the red sofa. Atlas had a closed book in her lap as she spoke with Timothy about a sequel book idea for the one he had written. Eurus was content with her thoughts until John decided to take up conversation with her. She didn't fight against this however as for John knew exactly how to speak to people of little words. Wanda and Mycroft meanwhile were otherwise engaged in conversation.
THE doorbell went just as Sherlock had gone to the loo and John got to his feet. Making his way into the lobby he saw Eurus opening the door and Rosie, sucking her bottom lip under her top teeth. Rosie walked in with a unfolded A4 picture in one hand, Jeff in the other and John put a hand on top of her head before nodding to Eurus as the quiet woman took her leave.
That morning Atlas helped John pack the car as she could see how to pack it. It was a puzzle she could solve within moments. She also was painfully aware she would have to pack a lot lighter as she was the only one who knew they would be taking a dog home with them. The day prior, during Atlas' and Mrs Hudson's visit she asked if Mycroft could take the presents to his parents house for her. He said yes as he was growing ever gullible to this girl who he saw as family.
"That's not fair to ask," Atlas said as she pulled away and looked at him. "You need to have a life."
"I'm a little overwhelmed," Sherlock said, starting to feel the panic rising in his chest. "John." He whispered. "John."
"Jeff included." Atlas smirked as they approached Rosewood Cottage. Sighing, she frowned as she saw Leanne's car parked on the drive with the Land rover and the Fabia. And she frowned some more.
After twenty or so more seconds her seizure began to draw to a conclusion as Sherlock let out a breath he didn't know he was holding. They waited with baited breath for her to come round, Sherlock clutching John's hand tightly.
"Sherlock, I'll watch him. You can go home and shower, maybe sleep?" Mycroft said looking at the side of his brother's head but he didn't move.
"Luggage in the roof box, rucksacks and instruments in the boot held down with cable ties and a section for Redbeard," Sherlock muttered, arms over his chest before John pulled him down into a kiss with a smile. "I love you."
SAMMY rested his chin on his folded arms with his eyes closed as they waited for their meal to be delivered to their table. They were at Books & Beans, by now their most favoured place to eat. He was staring at his drink of Diet Coke with a frown, clearly deep in thought. Rosie was sat next to John on the other side of the table.
"Yeah?" Sammy asked as he pulled the light green jumper out of the duffel. "He tried to give me one of his dark blue ones but it still fit him and he suits that colour, so, so much. It matches his eyes." And then he burst into tears, sitting on the bed with the jumper clutched to his chest.
"It wasn't so bad." Atlas said. "I'd probably have conked sooner if it weren't for your texts. " She hugged him tightly before hopping onto the breakfast bar stool next to him.
"Me and Timothy have been on a mission to get them together for years." Wanda said, looking at her husband before back at Atlas who was being drawn into a side hug from John. Ahead of them Sherlock punched a huge tree, Rosie doing the same as she realised it was soft. Her eyes went wide and she laughed before Sherlock then went off to show her some flowers.
"Thank you." Sherlock said as he looked up at Atlas, Mycroft and Rosie. The dog he never had was now infront of him.
"Of course it is. And it's not all about looks anyway. You no doubt have your dad's heart and brain." Morag smiled as she sighed, sitting down into the seat. "He made sure to hug and kiss you and he sat with you for so long when you were poorly. Come to think of it, he was looking after you when you were first born." She paused. "I don't suppose he's told you?" Blank faces. "About what your  mum said?" Atlas shook her head. "This may be hard to hear. She tried to put you up for adoption. When you were born...But that man over there," Morag pointed to Sherlock. "That man over there refused. Said he would do it, and I believe barring the time you spent in care which was, in truth, was Sherlock absolutely trying to do the best thing for you, I believe that he has done a very good job with you."
"Oh, uhh, thank you," Sammy smiled before he took a seat on the sofa and tore the paper from the picture. Inside, was a painting of his mum and his sister and his dad on a picnic blanket in a garden of luscious green grass with wild flowers and bees and the blanket was covered in cakes. The sky was as blue as the flowers in the scene. He felt himself swallow around a lump in his throat as he watched tears fall on to the picture. "Thank you, Eurus."
FAMILY. The word had often left all of the Holmes' running for the high hills. It had done for generations, each new generation finding it harder than the previous. However, Sherlock now understood the words. He was feeling everything a father would feel when his daughter was lying unconscious in a hospital bed. She had been with him nearly a month and a half and already he was falling into the rhythm of being a father.
The sun was now rising faster than Atlas ever realised it could as they spoke more about their history. Their families. She learnt more about Sammy; how his mother worked at the primary school Rosie would be attending soon; that his biological father was not in fact the man in the car accident but someone else who he never knew; how he loved the man who died as a father; how he was expected to be attending the same sixth form college as Atlas. Atlas told him much about herself, something telling her he could be trusted. She was incredibly good at spotting liars, being able to do it effortlessly herself.
John then turned to look back at Sherlock who came around and shuffled with Sammy, the young boy sitting next to Atlas, propped up against the spare bed that was probably going to be Peter's.
"Good, cause I don't think I could handle another parental figure dying. Especially not you. Especially not when you help make up the best set of parents I've ever had." Atlas said hugging him close.
JOHN had his book open infront of him while Rosie lay against his chest with her legs either side of his thighs. She was tucked in neatly, with her ear resting over his heart, her eyes shut. "War & Peace", John was discovering, was a very good book and he scolded himself for not having tried it earlier. Rosie gave a snore and he gave a quiet giggle as she shifted on his lap to move Jeff closer to herself.
"But he does remember the last three months." John replied but Atlas still sat cold. It was as if she was so sure he was never going to regain his memory.
Sammy picked up Rosie and hugged her close, whilst John and Sherlock linked fingers and looked at each other. They walked forward and Sherlock bent down to reach out a hand to touch her cheek.
"Our wedding. I want us to marry, sooner rather than later." Sherlock said. "We keep putting it off so why don't we just do it tomorrow, take the girls out of school and nursery for the day and go to the registry office."
"Will you bring my fiddle? Everyone else is responsible for their own items to be packed," Sherlock announced as he looked at Sammy, Rosie and Atlas lined up on the sofa infront of him in that order. "I'll be at the car."
"I get it. Its different when you don't know if it goes two ways. I just, I know I should have said I love you more," Atlas smiled. "But, I can rectify that so...I love you, dad."
"So I brought your glasses," Sherlock smiled. "And besides, since when did you need your glasses to play?" Sherlock said as he watched John leave with Rosie and Sammy. Then, collecting Atlas' violin case, he placed it on the bed and put his own on the sofa. He waited, with bated breath for the click that never came. He turned to find her staring at it, her hair pulled back into an elf-like a plait.
"Stage 4. It's Stage 4 now. And the mets are flowing through her bloodstream, she's riddled with it like it's some sort of parasite." Sammy spat out, John continuing to rub his back furtively. "But Atlas..."
Atlas giggled before she looked around them all. "Anyone want to watch those next few episodes of Glee?" She signed and spoke with a smile.
"What are names anyway? You're my conductor of light," Sherlock said as he looked at John. "Doesn't matter what your name is."
"Rosie, Harry, Jo and Sam all took Redbeard out. Papa's in the bath and Isla is prepping tea," Sherlock said with a grin which faltered as Atlas tried to smile but it just looked like a grimace. "Hey, Atlas, sweetheart, that's alright."
not you, will push the trolley." Atlas said before she darted off to collect some mushrooms for one of the upcoming evening's meal. John smiled to himself as he massaged at the injury lightly. It sometimes got like this. Periods of time that would haunt him and it would feel like the same as the day he got shot.
"I had a seizure," Atlas whispered looking directly at the fire, her face devoid of emotion as John came and sat with her. A hand on her back. "I'm not having a good day."
"I've spoken to John, Sam." Sherlock said entering the room. He smiled at the cream walls covered in photos, records, posters and artwork. Slowly, Sherlock walked up and looked at the artwork with a smile. "These are amazing."
"Sherlock," John tried as the younger man brushed past him. "Sherlock." He tried again as he disappeared up the stairs, a mass of dark curls slowly disappearing.
I don't know at this point. Probably all the chapters have something in it but imma go ahead and say this now. This is the Sherlock fandom, you can expect a lot of triggers but I will try to mention them when I identify them.
"Yeah." Atlas said quietly before lying down on Sherlock's legs and curling up. They stayed like that for a while until more of Rosie's questions arose.
They continued along and, with a smile, sat down at a table whilst Sherlock and John popped in to collect some beverages and cake. When they reappeared it was with a variety of items but most importantly, a bottle of Irn Bru.
"He'll be here soon. He just needed to collect a few bits and bobs and I think he's going to being your jumper and some other things." Sherlock smiled before he rested his chin opposite her face on the mattress. "I missed you."
"She hit her," Sherlock whispered looking away from John. "And I could never get there quick enough. I could never get to her in time, ever. But then sometimes she would hit me." He paused. "And that was always better than her hitting Atlas but of course that even scared her." He paused again.
"Why didn't you mention it?" John asked, reaching out a hand to gently rub at Atlas' knee. "We'd have helped." Atlas moved to the middle seat and looked at them.
"Atlas need one soon," Sammy giggled but stopped once he saw that John wasn't laughing. "What-What's wrong?"
"I was so sorry to hear about you having to go into a care home and then Foster care etc," he frowned.
AROUND twenty minutes later Atlas was lying on her side in the fetal position on her bed. Sherlock knocked lightly before entering, sitting on the bed before thinking of what to say.
Atlas nodded and made her way towards Sherlock taking the violin from hands. She let her fingers move all over it until she rested it beneath her chin. She looked up at Sherlock and he nodded.
Sherlock looked up before Atlas slipped in and stood looking at him. Her arms wrapped around herself as Sherlock looked up at her slowly. Noticing how upset she was Sherlock sat up before tapping the covers next to him, Atlas clambering over the bed to lean a weary head on his shoulder. It didn't remain there long as, he lifted an arm up and slung it round her shoulder.
AT precisely 10:35am Rosie promptly looked at Atlas who nodded in response to her non-verbal statement.
"I know Rosie," Mycroft said as she pulled away and walked over to Sammy. From there she climbed into his lap and rested against him.
"Okay. I have in my notes that you experience episodes of severe depression and have constant quite severe anxiety. Have you had a panic attack before?" Dr Young asked, looking at Atlas.
There was a shrill cry of laughter, before another and a concerning stop of the piano before a final cry. A cry. Not of laughter, of pain. Before loud crying and some shushing. Both men exchanged a worried glance before they went up the stairs at speed. They jumped every two steps before they went into the living room and stopped abruptly. Rosie was sitting on the floor, a gash to her head - near the one that she attained in the lodge incident - her arm cradled in her other one. She was crying huge sobs and Atlas was far off to the side, some sort of fear etched in her eyes.
"I know I do," John said back. "And I'm hoping, that if your feeling better, you would like to come with me to the jewellers."
"Soppy," Mycroft said and Atlas threw her head back and cackled. "I'm glad you find that amusing." Mycroft laughed with her. "You should probably catch some sleep."
ATLAS and Sherlock returned from the new house on Saturday early to sort out a few things back at 221B. Tommorow, they were showing John and Rosie the new house, but right now Atlas needed a nap. John had left a sticky note just in case on the fridge saying he'd gone to buy milk and take Rosie to the park. Immediately in the door and Atlas was on the sofa, wrapped in a blanket and asleep. Out of it. Sherlock smiled before going over to his seat and selecting a book to read, settling on one about Afghanistan he'd seen both John and Atlas read - it was also one of the few books that hadn't yet been moved over to Rosewood Cottage.
As Rosie slept she dreamt dreams of ponies and leprechauns, for a while. Then her dreams became convoluted with fears. She stood watching carefully as she saw Atlas standing infront of her. Then the sound of gunfire rang and she watched her beloved siblings knees buckle like a door hinge. A heap of bleeding out Atlas was all that was left as he eyes remained open but empty.
"John," Sherlock started. "It's alright. If you want to loose weight I'll support that but you don't have to worry about it either. It's alright."
"Now, by using my doctor knowledge I can guess what just happened. But it would be better to hear from you." John said as pulled up a chair opposite her. At this point Sherlock appeared in the kitchen, his brow furrowing when he saw Atlas at the table.
"I realised something." Atlas said, lifting her mask to speak, only to have Sherlock gently guide her hand back down and complete some sign language with her. "You guys make my life worth living." She signed, Sherlock translating aloud for John. "Before I came to 221B back in October, and no offence dad, but I had no one to stay alive for. Well, except for myself. You wouldn't have known if I had killed myself right then and there, you wouldn't have. But now, now that I have dads I have a sister, a best friend who is more like a brother, two other best friends, Hale as my friend, Greg, Molly, two grandma's and a grandad, two aunt's, an uncle, the list goes on and suddenly, I don't want to be dead. Because I have more reason to be alive." She paused to look at Sherlock as he finished off repeating what she had signed. "But I also want to live for myself."
"What? You don't agree?" Timothy somewhat scolded, looking over at his eldest child who was sat rubbing his forehead again.
Atlas rolled her eyes before getting to her feet and removing her lab coat and goggles, hanging them up and putting them in the cubby below.
"I have an email here from Mr Ingram." Mrs Frobisher said, looking over to the two men. "Your daughter's head of year."
"Fair enough." John smiled before coming into the kitchen properly. He collected a glass and filled it with water before looking over to her. "I haven't asked any questions about...you know." He said quietly. "But I just have one. Why did you shoot her?"
"I'm a speech therapist," She smiled and John smiled back. "I work mainly with young children who have just developed a little stutter or struggle with f's and th's."
"Those days were the best days and as you can tell, there were never very many," Sherlock whispered.
"Redbeard!" Rosie shrieked running into the living room with one sock on and one sock off. Her hair was all knotted, a dog toy in her hand as she bounded towards him.
"Oh, Sherlock," John sighed as he looked at him. "What if they...? I'm trying to think how to put it." Sherlock just watched his facial expressions with utter confusion.
Until Dr Aduba ordered another round of medication and finally it ebbed away and came to an end. And it felt like an eternity until she came around but when she did, all she wanted to do was cry. Lying on her side whilst all the nurses were still in the room she curled up tight, squeezed her eyes shut and put her hands over her ears. She tried counting. But found it boring. So instead, she started listing off American States. Trying to gather them all.
"Papa." Atlas said sternly. "I didn't ask you to do any of this. The fridge will need cleaning out and Rosie and Sammy and Redbeard need to see you." There was a brief pause. "I miss Redbeard. A lot. But anyway, you should also see about going to spread your dads ashes. And speaking to the family court. Aren't your dads ashes supposed to be being spread this weekend?"
Sammy spotted Atlas then and looking up he got to his feet and wrapped his arms around her shoulders.
"We also have a dog called Redbeard. And a landlady called Mrs Hudson." Atlas explained before opening the door and taking Sammy inside.
"Alright," John said. "What're we eating?" Getting to his feet he handed out a plantain wrap to Atlas, then a prawn pasta to Sammy before they promptly swapped. Rosie had a tuna and sweetcorn sandwich, Sherlock a pickle and cheese and John a tomato pasta. Switching off the TV Atlas began her food and grinned around a mouthful of pasta.
"Red," Atlas sobbed before slinging her arms around his neck and she could no longer hear the people moving around her. Not until John appeared. Hands out ready to- "Papa."
"Tonight you stay here. In our spare room and probably stay here until further notice." Sherlock added before he heard the creaking of some steps.
"That dog. Was your kid's idea." Mycroft said to Sherlock as he stood opposite him. "I don't know how she knew but she did. And she also told me something else."
grandparents." He said before he pulled the plastic off a large item at the back. Atlas navigated her way through various high quality pieces towards the back of the unit. There, uncovered and in all it's glory was a king sized bed. Dark brown wood made up the bed which had a headboard and a bottom to it. Along the bottom, carved vine leaves emphasized the woods natural movement and curved down the sides up to the headboard. The headboard was embellished in a similar way and Atlas' jaw just dropped.
"John." Sherlock said, knowing that the four years older man did those movements when it was aching. Slowly, he finished the chapter and put down the book before hilariously bum shuffling his way over to where John was sat. Gentle fingers rubbed the ache beneath the t-shirt, Sherlock massaging it gently. He placed a gentle kiss to his shoulder before moving his hands again.
Not long after, the server came up and they ordered their drinks and some halloumi fries to share between them all.
"Yes. We want you to recover at home." Dr Aduba smiled. "Also, Dr and Mr Watson-Holmes, we would like you to acknowledge that it is in Atlas' interest that their be one other person in the house at all times and that they visit her at regular intervals."
"Not particularly," Sherlock smiled. "It's my money and this is what I wanted to invest in. It has a lovely garden and it's right where I was hoping."
"Because that's your father's last name." Sherlock said as she wriggled a foot into the other leg, a hand resting on Sherlock's shoulder for support.
A few moments later the linked pair achieved the bench by the stream. A teenage Sherlock could often be found here admiring the world or studying books upon books of random facts for his hard drive.
"Will we see that bridge thing in Harry Potter? Atlas said that the bridge or via...via...Glenfinn-"
"THERE you go." Mycroft said gesturing to a pen in his kennels. He kept his estate dogs in here, and of course if dogs are used in hunting they are only allowed to retrieve the animal.
"Hey," Atlas said flicking a hand against him. "We don't mind." And she rested her head against his shoulder. "We love you. I love you."
"Hey!" Atlas declared before Sherlock finally started to pay proper attention as he left his mind palace. She pouted before leaning back in her chair scowling like a Holmes at both her parents. Her arms were crossed and she frowned.
"What Sherlock means to say is, we can drop you at a station or an airport, pay for your travel, look after your instruments, give you some food before you leave and we'll pick you up when you get back." John smiled.
And then he hated himself. The flashbacks, he should have seen them happening. Getting worse. He should have paid more attention. He should ha-
"That and the universities are unlikely to take you until your 18. Seeing as we managed to negotiate you getting into college a year earlier because of your previous attainments. So you'll most likely have a gap year." Sherlock said.
"She was kind. Although, she was a little lost to start with." He began looking over at Atlas, who gave him a nod to continue. "She was funny." Sherlock said looking down at the ground. "But she was never...right." The term was not what he wanted to use but he knew that Atlas would understand. Mary-Anne had never had a sound mind and Sherlock wasn't about to keep that from her.
"What can I say? I'm just what papa calls me, a fighter. I'm pretty fiesty too I think," Atlas grinned.
"That's my girl," Sherlock giggled, slinging an arm around her shoulder as they watched the sun rising over the city.
"I mean, it was nice because she was curious and wanted to touch everything but sometimes it was a nightmare. She used to get really fascinated by light switches and how they worked," Sherlock smiled as he looked at Atlas. "Thank god it wasn't light sensitive epilepsy, that's all I can say."
Also, I know that a lot of foster care and adoption isn't bad and it's generally good with really good, amazing people! However, for the purpose of this story, Atlas drew the really short straw and ended up with some really un-pleasant people. In a much later chapter, I go into more detail.
"Why would someone want a neuclear weapon?" Eurus asked before looking over to her sibling who shrugged. They went around the maze aisles trying to get there. "Then how come your the government?"
"He's always loved you." Timothy said. "From the moment he met you, he loved you." John's jaw went slack, but closed when he saw the brother's jostling their way down the main aisle.
"Yeah," Atlas whispered. "I was poisoned. Long story. Not very interesting and then I was ill. Not very exciting either."
"Becausesometimes, being scared is good. It forces us to think things through and rationalise and also to understand what's good for us," Atlas said with a smile her voice  becoming less slurred.
Atlas nodded sharply before detaching from Sherlock and lying down on the bed. With a gentle smile Sherlock got to his feet, pulled the chair beside the bed closer and sat down. He stroked the offending hair out of her eyes and she gave a little smile before she closed her eyes and tried to sleep again. But her mind was filled with the images of her nightmare.
ONE week after the jolly affairs of Christmas and New Year, the decorations came down. And eight days after New Year's, a daunting letter was posted through the door of 221B Baker Street.
Maybe he should have taken the small movements more seriously as for, within moments, Sherlock found himself pinned to the bed with a forearm pressed into his windpipe. He now realised the saying to "never wake a sleeping dog" should be, "never wake a sleeping soldier." Infact, come to mention it...
"I personally don't think men are good together." John Sr said, not realising what his homophobic comment may stir.
"I'm afraid you'll have to tell me." Sherlock said after some time of trying to figure out why his eldest child wanted to walk with him.
"Greg. Could you maybe pick up the glass?" John asked as he kneeled infront of Atlas as she rested her elbow on the table her head in her hand. She covered eyes to hide her tears.
"Mycroft?" A voice asked, before the brothers turned around to see Sammy, holding Rosie up his front. "It is you. Rosie, look who's here."
"That sounds lovely," John smiled before he had an armful of Atlas wrapping her arms around his shoulders. "Hey, hey, hey, come on lovebug." He rubbed her back roughly but in a soothing manner that kept her relaxed. "It's okay. It's okay, sweetheart."
"I know," Mycroft whispered as Atlas let out a little sob. "Oh, Ida, I know." Before opening his arms and letting her in for a hug. "Oh, Ida."
Once John had finished his conversation with parents he walked over to Sherlock and put a hand on his shoulder. He forced Sherlock to turn around to look at the room of people. Atlas, still refusing to turn around.
"I'm going to climb into the bed with you. I brought "The Two Towers" and I'm going to read it to you." John said before collecting the book and thread bookmark that Atlas had made and climbed in. Lying on his left side, he outstretched his arms for Atlas and let her into his embrace.
"You couldn't have known." Sherlock said comfortingly, before looking up at the sky trying to blink away tears. "I'm not very good at this."
"It's normal for people to not be able to stomach it. If I'm right you didn't." Lestrade said, Atlas nodding once before looking back to the girl.
The kind doctor that Atlas liked came in just after she had woken up and was now sitting up in her bed, John back in a seat to one side.
"Just feeling a little sore," Atlas said as she rolled her shoulder and flexed her hand down her right side. "And a little faint."
"Nice to meet you." Sammy said producing a hand to the man who shook it firmly. Mycroft nodded once before leading them to the library. Atlas went to collect a piece of paper and pen when Mycroft stopped her.
"The seizure medication should help and then you also need to take your tremor medicine too," John smiled as Atlas frowned at them.
"Atlas. May I ask you something?" Sherlock asked his daughter as she walked next to her. "How long was the investment in this dog?"
This hospital was one that was under Mycroft's control and not Moriarty's. It was on an island, just like it was for Eurus, however this one was much more strict and for older people. It had been many years since she had met the person she least wanted to. She'd left before Sherlock and she was frightened to say the least.
Loading up the car, John didn't question it before they hopped in and headed home. They made rainbow unicorn sparkle cupcakes and drew pictures of rainbow sparkly unicorns. They ate their fill with a nice pasta bake and John had a little bit of wine. Video called Sherlock that evening, he seemed alright but tired and refused to disclose his whereabouts and Rosie went to bed for 7.
"A few inside and then me and Atlas were making up a little bag of picks and roisin and my capo," Sammy smiled before Sherlock smiled back and nodded. Turning back he ruffled the boy's hair and he skipped over to John with a huge grin.
"And next weekend, I have the van hired again to take stuff from Baker Street." Sherlock smiled, Atlas smiling back.
"Alright, pumpkin," John smiled before he took the coat from her and went over to help Sherlock who was helping Sammy look at coats but Atlas wasn't there. He spotted her, trying coats on at the other side of the shop. "Find one, Atlas?"
Mycroft didn't stay long, he was literally the government so he had a lot to do. Promptly he left followed by Mrs Hudson a short time later who took Rosie with her. John had agreed that it was best for the kid to have a proper bed to sleep on and made sure that Molly went around every once in a while to check everything is alright.
Mycroft joined Atlas in putting on an apron and washing his hands before he made his way over to the counter.
"It's not stupid and silly, Sherlock." Wanda smiled, looking at him, and Sherlock nodded once before looking down at Rosie and then over to John.
"Sherlock is currently...well...your not going to be able to get him. So I am the next best thing." Atlas said trying to sound braver than she was admittedly feeling.
"Of course. You get stuck again, ask me." Sherlock said before Atlas began to take out her plaits. "Let me." Sherlock smiled, taking it from her and undoing them.
"That it is," John said. "Thank you, Mycroft. For coming. And for letting me be a part of your family."
"No, no, I need to go tell them I'm fine," Atlas said insistently, getting to her feet and walking out into the hallway.
IT was sudden when John saw it, a slight discolouration. He had already attempted three coffins with little succession when he saw the dirt. Just slightly darker in colour than the rest. He called upon the Holmes in him, all the things Sherlock had been berating him on for years. He walked slowly over to the dirt, shovel in hand.
"Yes, yes, alright," Sophie exclaimed, pissed at him for asking so much of her in such a short period of time. Trailing their way out to the car, the expecting couple hopped inside and pulled out of their driveway.
Atlas sat contemplatively with Mrs Hudson before getting up and pacing the room. She walked around before sitting back down next to Mrs Hudson, taking the mouse and clicking open the tab with the blue eyed ragdoll.
Sherlock gave a loud huff, that prompted John to shoot him a look. "I'm sorry. Sherlock here probably already knows the answer but is being polite for once."
Sherlock and Mycroft would be sharing a room, John was on a put up bed in the living room whilst Mrs Hudson would be getting the last guest bedroom in the house left over.
"I'm just tired." Atlas said quietly before rubbing her nose against him when it itched. "Really, really tired."
"I'm not they," John said quietly. "I'm not leaving, for a start, I love your dad too much for that."
"Yeah. I suppose I do. I like to think that in my old age I'll move there. But it's getting your dad off of bloody Surrey, which is lovely and all but I want to be in the Highlands." John said.
Just as she was coming to the end of the chorus the doorbell rang, Sherlock jumping to answer it. He made his way down the stairs, the sound of the song continuing upstairs. Surprise hitting his face when he heard a male voice harmonizing - the surprise settling when he realised it was Sammy.
"Oh, dad!" Atlas exclaimed. "Papa just told me that a string on my violin has snapped. He thought to check it considering changes in temperature and everything."
Rosie was getting her cast off and she couldn't wait. Babbling about it to John, Atlas and Sherlock all morning at the breakfast bar. Her mouth half full of raspberries as she pushed some into her dad's mouth. Sherlock realised that unless he got Rosie out for some positive entertainment that morning before they were going to get some lunch from somewhere, he would have to listen to five year old witter. Which, in truth, when it was Rosie was not witter but as it always is with children, it is repetitive. So to the park they went before lunch and then onto the hospital for 1:30pm.
"She's drooling," Sammy said before Jo handed him a piece of kitchen roll and he folded it under her mouth. "She hasn't bitten her mouth or tongue or anything so she'll be happy."
"No, don't be sorry, love," John said. "I'll make the surgery put it into their talk about SHARE. Scare the kids a bit."
"Oh my dears, oh my dears," Isla smiled before kissing Sammy's cheek and then Atlas'. "It's lovely to meet you both."
There is an idea in here I got off Instagram so creds to whoever came up with it because I can't remember who.
WHEN they crossed the border Rosie squealed in the dying light, pointing out the window excitedly whilst Atlas dozed.
"I know it's weird pa." Atlas said into his chest, his chin resting over her head. "To finally be rid of someone but actually wish they were alive to face charges. Or even worse, to be rid of someone and the police never knowing where to look. Or the worst of all, to be rid of someone you hate, only to realise that you care for them after all." There was a brief pause. "You loved your dad, pa. No matter what he's done or did to you, you still love him. And you will never loose the feeling. You know the feeling I'm on about. Just, promise not to do anything silly."
By the door Atlas and John stood listening in slightly. To be honest John was happy with the outcome. It was clear that Sherlock was happy with having that status.
"That I can agree with," Sherlock laughed as they walked onwards, the dog on a lead as they walked through the early morning traffic. "Fancy Salisbury Craggs? Should be able to let him off up there at this time in the morning."
"I'm fine." Sherlock lied, but Atlas didn't push her luck. He opened his arms, the way someone does when offering or asking for a hug. She gave him one and smiled, the barriers were breaking.
"Underdstood." Sherlock laughed as they pulled into a place called Jackson's Storage. A pretty boring name, however, when they got further down the road, they had to stop, a large red barrier marking the official entrance. They came to a stop and Atlas watched as Sherlock dropped the driver window down.
"Atlas, your....well...awake," Sherlock said quietly, rubbing her hair as he came to sit on the sofa by her legs.
exciting job. Then there were Timothy and Wanda who adored her and she adored them equally as much. Mycroft who was partial to letting her bake with him and Eurus who was happy enough to play, read and paint with her.
"Dad?" Atlas asked looking at her father. He nodded once for fear his voice may fail him. "Could we show pa the photos?"
"You know?" Sherlock asked. "Everytime?" Atlas nodded, Sherlock squeezing her shoulder in return. "He'll be alright. He's a Watson." Atlas and Sherlock shared a knowing look. "Don't worry about him."
"She's very pretty." Eurus said, then confusion fluttered over her face before realisation. "Mary's?"
"He has proof. It's not bought with dodgy money or anything and I put the remainder into other funds for retirement for us both. It's all secure, I worked for some of the money so-"
"Of course, that's what I'm here for," John smiled back at her, pushing his glasses back up his nose and smoothing over his beard. He itched the patch underneath his eye before smiling at her. "I know I'm not your real dad and I know I can never be as important to you as Sherlock is. But I'm thankful to you too. Atlas, you have changed the way I look at everything in my life and I wouldn't trade all this for the world."
"You went into cardiac arrest. Your heart stopped." Doctor Aduba said frowning before he nodded to John and left the room. John carefully removed Atlas' mask and put it to one side, she could use it as and when she would need it.
"But you had to watch all that too...and all the stuff...I'm not...it's not...as...bad...for-for me," Atlas sobbed, John rubbing her shoulder.
Sherlock looked worried and Atlas wanted to reach out a hand, put it in his and hold on. And her eyes drooped further and further and further until, despite her best efforts, the darkness of unconsciousness pulled her back in underwater.
WHEN John, Sherlock and Rosie walked in 38 minutes later, they saw the pair of them sitting on the middle double bed, watching Brave on the TV. Atlas appeared to be dozing, quite happily, whilst Sammy was sat next to her, water bottle in hand.
"Yes." Atlas replied before continuing up the stairs. The sounds of her dad playing violin echoed through the flat and she smiled quietly to herself before opening the door. Sherlock didn't turn and Rosie and Redbeard didn't look up from where they were sat looking at the geographical map of Portugal.
"Nearly there, Red," Atlas called back to the dog who started sniffling the windows the closer they got to the Loch. She rested her temple against the window as they drove along. "Just here?" She asked as they pulled into a car park beside the Loch.
"Much appreciated, but times have changed and passed and I love your dad so, so much that it doesn't hurt to see her anymore," John said before he put his hand to her cheek. "And in time, that will happen for you."
"I just," Sammy started. "I really like wearing makeup and pink two piece suits and stuff and I'm comfortable as a guy but everybody is always watching me but its who I am."
Atlas skipped ahead with the dog, grabbing a stick and lobbing it into the loch before coming back and sitting on the log. Sherlock draped a blanket over their legs and handed her a box of sandwiches from a rucksack as the soggy dog came back and dropped the stick on her feet. She threw it again in a fit of giggles whilst Sherlock took a snap of her smiling and then a video as she threw it again. Looking at the camera she smiled around her sandwich.
"John." Sherlock said looking at him through the glass. "You need to do the same on the join at your side." John removed his coat, leaving him in just his shirt and thumped the glass before there was a crackle. The water was now sitting on Mycroft's chin.
"Enviable of Rosie," John giggled as he looked down at his husband. He smiled at him before planting a kiss on his lips.
"My papa has a really good blueberry pancake recipe," Atlas smiled at Xerxes as she signed and spoke.
"You were shot?" He questioned, Atlas sighing. Not quite how she wanted to start her day out with her new friend. She slowly lifted the shirt she was wearing to reveal the scar from her bullet wound before pulling it back down.
"DAD." Atlas said quietly as she came over to the sofa. "Don't be mad at me, but when I...ya know...I...uh... dropped my phone."
"Alright," Ruth said pulling a business card out her pocket. "This has my number on it, put it in your phone and send me photos of your work and I'll put some in my shop."
"Sherlock?" John said to the man who was sitting with a cup of tea in his hand. He looked up. "I was wondering why you had Rosie calling Mary mother. I'd always planned on it being Mama or Mum or Mummy."
"Shhh, shhh, shhh." Mycroft whispered as he continued to hold her and rub her back. "My little Ida."
"Yes," John sighed. "I just, I know I speak about her a lot. Like, a lot and I probably shouldn't but it's so, so difficult not to. I speak about her more than the others and I don't want them to think we have fav-"
"I do." Mycroft said quietly. "My brother is finally happy, not high and not chasing every single case down for an adrenaline rush. He finally has all he really needs." Mycroft appeared to let a flicker of a smile cross across his face.
"Yeah. The nice one." Rosie replied, going back to dipping her toast into her egg. Atlas immediately understood and left before the conversation got any more confusion. She didn't understand and didn't want to engage in conversation so, sneakily she collected her laptop and went upstairs.
"PAPA, papa, papa!" Rosie screeched running into his and Sherlock's bedroom, jumping up onto the bed. John woke quickly and looked at her concerned.
"Do you want a barbeque tonight?" Wanda asked as Rosie sat up and nodded before making her way towards her.
"Thank you by the way Ro." Atlas said looking over to her, she nodded before looking over to her family members who looked as if they were trying to figure it out. She knew everyone wanted her to speak so she searched desperately for a way out when her eyes fell on the three violins.
"Okay, thank you," Ruben said before he beckoned for John to move so that he could get in at her. "Atlas, isn't it?"
"You'll be okay." John said reassuringly as Sherlock and Mycroft set to work deducing as much as possible about the vest which she was wearing. There was no way to take it off without triggering a switch and so far they weren't getting anywhere. Every wire they came across was black - harder to know which one to snip.
"Ha ha. Very funny." Atlas smirked. "Yes. After meeting my dad for the first time in seven years I told him I'd be there if he wanted to speak."
"Oh yeah, but I didn't. Can't remember why. I'm on my period though, just to clear that up," Atlas whispered before looking around the room, Sammy smiling softly at her when he caught her eyes.
It was all coming back to her now. Every moment in care, every moment with her mother, every moment spent with him and the other Foster parents. All of it. Like a movie behind her eyelids. Playing and playing and playing on repeat. Until it stopped, suddenly. On the day he died.
"No," Kirsty said hauling him to his feet and pulling him to the other side of the dining table leaving Atlas sitting. No gun held to her temple. "Your mind is better than his. That's what all the papers are saying."
"I'm coming home sweetheart. Look after Atlas and Sammy and Jeff for us till we get back." Sherlock said quietly as he stuffed his shaking hands into his blazer pockets, looked at John as he hung up and darted away.
"It's good to work connections and make friends." Atlas explained. "It's especially helpful to have someone who has an ability if she so desired to, to access chemicals. I may have done a little, shimmy shammy and wham...had a sort of human tranquilizer?"
"And what does everyone say?" Atlas asked as she looked at the girl who was standing in the doorway.
"Yeah, course." Sherlock said, putting an arm round her shoulder. "Your the bookworm." Atlas laughed at that.
"It's one of the more painful procedures," John frowned. "Sorry, Rosie." He looked back at her to see that she was speaking to Jeff and trying not to cry.
"Yeah, that's okay. But only use that when I'm like, really, really ill. Like, I'm gonna die ill. Or, when I'm really sad. Or just when your being affectionate." Atlas tried to explain. "Basically, yeah, it's fine just don't overuse it."
"Oh also." Mrs Hudson shouted up the stairs causing both of them to turn around. "I'm thinking of getting a cat. A little bit of company. Would Redbeard be alright with it?" She called.
"I've sent it to papa," Sherlock smiled before sitting back down on the log and pulled the picnic blanket it back. She rested her head on his shoulder as she ate some crisps, grinning as the dog occupied himself with zoomies.
ATLAS didn't even question it as Mycroft turned up at seven sharp to take her to MI5. She wasn't surprised to see him despite being unaware that it was happening. Sherlock was still in a sulk but had agreed that he would help John and Mrs Hudson manouver everything up the stairs and into the spot that had been cleared infront of the window.
"Off duty and a dad. So, biscuit," Sherlock said handing him one that earned him a kiss on the cheek.
"I do," Sherlock smiled. "This is like how it used to be, before everything changed. Before it all went bad."
"Probably out walking Redbeard." Wanda hummed, looking over at Timothy before spotting Redbeard. "Or not."
"DO you drink whisky?" Timothy asked as headed for a closed cupboard situated in the corner of the room. Previously Timothy had asked John a variety of questions, particularly about the war.
"Alright," Sherlock said gently putting a hand to the back of her neck. He rubbed with his thumb as she looked at him blankly. "Your alright." He smiled gently. "We don't have to do any thinking if you don't want to. We can have scones and tea." He then pulled a keyring out his pocket with a pea stress toy attached. Laid on his hand he held it out to her and she took it, with a grin before squeezing it. "There we go. I love you."
PERIOD two, History, and Atlas found herself sat next to her new found friend May. A nice girl with a nice nature. Quiet but thoughtful. She reminded Atlas of a weird combination of Eurus and Rosie. Something about her settled well with the Holmes and she smiled. Infact, over the past two weeks she had been welcomed into a group of friends consisting of Sammy, Abayomi, Xerxes and May. And it was brilliant.
"Before you interrogate him...he's gay. Not my boyfriend. And not part of my non-existent sex life." Atlas scolded, her father still frowning before she put a hand to Sammy's shoulder.
"Yep, thank you, Mycroft," Atlas smiled before hugging his midriff. "Thank you for coming too, I love you."
"That's a good date because I can't forget it. My dad's the 6th." She answered before they made their way into Debenhams. "Also just tell me your mobile number right now."
Atlas had grown increasingly close to Mycroft as he seemed to know how to understand her and when Sherlock got too much. It was the 20th of December and Mycroft was bored, alone and feeling somewhat sad, that was until his phone rang. The caller ID came up as "Pick Up The Phone" and he chuckled as he answered. Atlas was forever changing the ID's of people on people's phones for a laugh. Passwords couldn't stop her.
"Our stockings!" Rosie shrieked as she darted back up the stairs before coming back down even faster.
"Sherlock." John said, quieter this time. Kinder. Softer. "You just, you need to tell me about big things like this, okay?"
And Sherlock just held her, whispering about science and equations and telling her that he was there. He had a hold of her. He wasn't going anywhere. Pressure round her shoulders, her waist and gradually she began to calm down a little.
Rosie quietly went to get Sherlock who followed her when she took his hand. He didn't question her on where he was being led, he just did. Lestrade had managed to put the glass away and had made his departure from the flat by the time he'd gotten through.
"Right." Wanda said after some time. "Tonight Rosie, Atlas, Eurus and I are cooking, and tommorow night the men cook." Wanda looked around at the faces she had called to attention. "Deal?"
"You'll be alright," Atlas was muttering, her hands becoming covered in blood. "You'll be okay." Kirsty's mouth filled with blood and Atlas felt sick and all she could smell was blood. "Hey, hey, stay with me." Redbeard came over and lay down next to her body and Atlas reached over a hand. Kirsty coughed, red blood covering Atlas's front.
"Probably hitting the bottle. Don't know if you'd guessed but it seems that as of late, she has been hitting it a lot." Sammy managed between sobs. "She's dead. Georgia's dead. She died."
"We'll facetime you everyday," John called from where he was wiping his hands on a tea towel. He was grinning at her.
I'm not a doctor and my writing is rubbish do I'll take this moment to remind you all that I am using this as a place to store my fanfiction and it is brilliant if you love it!
"Speaking of Rosie, I wonder where she is today?" Atlas said, understanding fine well she was behind John's chair. Out of view of herself and Sammy. "You can put your guitar over there. We aren't meeting the rest of my estranged family until half eleven." Sammy gave a nod before the dark haired girl complied in Rosie's game before finding her. She let out a squeal and ran to John, hugging his legs. Sammy followed her into the kitchen, smiling.
"Something's up." John announced, swinging his feet off the bed and going past Sherlock to stand in the bathroom.
"Can I...I...well...I called Rosewood...well I called it home...Can I...even if my mum comes home and I can go back, back to Jekyll Avenue...I...Can...Could I stay at Rosewood Cottage?" Sammy asked, refusing to look at John and Sherlock. There was a pause of silence. "Sorry...sorry...your a family I shouldn't have asked...that was innapp-"
"We were saying how nice you are." Atlas joked before Sherlock shot her a look that made her laugh even more.
"No, that's not what I'm asking." Sherlock snapped and before he could get another word in John intervened.
"You know when humpty dumpty falls off the wall?" Atlas asked Rosie, who nodded and looked thoughtful.
Sherlock then took Rosie through to the living room to read more of their book as Atlas spoke to John.
"Oh, so last night when I stayed up with her through the thunderstorm and sat with her through those two seizures don't count for anything right now?" John said. "Your the one who tried to commit suicide when she was -  what five? And you didn't think about the fucking consequences."
As they got in the van, the waved goodbye to the two men who had helped load up the van and set off for the new house. Atlas looked out the window the whole way there as she added details to her map of London that she contained within her mind palace - which was and always had been, a library.
LATER Atlas came downstairs and saw the family sat in different places. She sat next to Sherlock and leaned against his shoulder, he responded by wrapping an arm around them.
TWO weeks later and Atlas was starting to improve. Improve enough that John and Sherlock booked an impromptu trip to Lofoten in the North of Norway. They just had to tell the kids...and Sherlock's parents as they were the choice to look after them.
"When is everyone coming?" Rosie asked, her hair flowing down her back as she went over to Sherlock. He was doing something on the computer - probably looking at a dead body - and quickly he changed the website over to Google.
"I don't want to go. I want to stay at home. I want to see Atlas. I want to-" Rosie cried whilst John continued to do his best attempt at reducing her painful cries.
"This is really nice." Atlas thanked Wanda as she continued to eat her food. To her surprise everyone went quiet, enjoying the food produced by the wonder that was Wanda.
"That'll be fun for dusting." John laughed, noting the tops of the cabinets and fridge. When he got to the top of the stairs his eyes went wide and he felt himself well-up. He could see the piano, the violin cases, cabinets of sheet music and a sofa. He saw the coloured rug and fairy lights on the wall, a coffee table with books on it.
"Come back to us, love," Someone was saying to her and she felt the soft mattress underneath her. She blinked a few times, trying to shake the visions of James. "Come on, your alright." She blinked again.
"I'm sorry." He whispered to her. "If you...If you'd have died...If you die, I'm probably going to feel like shit, return to drugs and die before I'm fifty."
"Wanna get you walking." Doctor Aduba smiled, walking in. "Need to get you walking and sitting. It might take some time but I want to check you out before I decide how intense your physio is going to have to be."
"I liked your playing more." She said smiling up at her. "It was pretty wasn't it?" She asked looking at Atlas before looking out the window. Sherlock and John exchanged a confused look as they went on.
"Of course I know that, Sherlock," John sighed before kissing Sherlock's temple. "I'd do anything for you."
"I know." Atlas smiled as she looked out the window at the passing traffic. "They like you. If you ever need to asking them something guy based, honestly, just ask them. And I mean, it helps that your all gay." Atlas gave a little chuckle at that and so did Sammy.
"I love you guys." Atlas said looking to her dad, then papa before getting to her feet suddenly. She stood infront of them. "But I still want to go home."
"They can't get her down to sleep. She says she has something for Atlas but won't show them what it is." Sherlock sighed rubbing his hands over his face. "Twenty two minutes."
"Okay, that's okay, papa will go and we'll go in the landrover yeah?" Sherlock asked and Sammy stuttered a nod as he sobbed. "What's brought all this on?"
"Had a case this morning that was absolutely boring and then I got the phone call to pick Atlas up so we watched Cloud Atlas all afternoon." Sherlock sighed before he offered John a smile.
"HEY! Hey! Hold on." John said jogging to catch the lady up, she stopped and looked at him. "Look I'm really sorry."
"I wuv you, Redbeard," Rosie exclaimed running towards the dog who barked. She wrapped his arms around his neck.
"You have one dominant nostril, and it changes every few hours but we do not notice this." He signed and spoke - not great speech but it still made a contribution. Sammy gave a little smile before reciting what he had signed. John watched in a little bit of awe, before realising he should not, even a little bit, be surprised. Sammy was a bright kid and he could've sworn Atlas saying something about his aunt being deaf.
She handed over the certificate just as Sherlock and Rosie came into the room and Atlas hugged John tightly, her body resting against his.
"I know you can't do emotion...or anything like that." Atlas said carefully as she treaded lightly. "But when I thought I was...I was going to die I spoke to John." Sherlock looked at John as if asking him to give him some sort of sign. "I know your trying really hard." Sherlock furrowed his eyebrows at her. "And I'm really grateful that your doing so much for me." His eyes became teary. "And when I thought I was going to die I wanted nothing other than to say...Thank you. And I love you." Sherlock smiled awkwardly as tears fell from his eyes and he was swarmed with a whole host of emotions. "Dad."
"Myself, John, Sherlock and Rosie will be going first thing in the morning together." Atlas explained as the group made their way into a cozy seating area with a fire.
Wanda leant down and hugged Sherlock as he attempted to shy away. Rosie recieved a kiss on her head aswell as a 'hello dear.'
She woke up fast, panting with sweat dripping into her eyes. Her eyes were blurry and she felt like she was dying. Her chest was sore and she knew what this was. She pulled herself to a seating position trying to catch her breath.
She sat quietly in the front seat as John drove to the library which was closer to his work than what he had realised.
"HELLO Samuel." Sherlock said, the young boy entering the flat at exactly 9:30am as requested by Atlas. The young man in question stood in the door, looking over to the older man before smiling fondly.
"Yes, I'm coming too, I'm not leaving," Mycroft whispered as he crouched by her knees, Sammy's hand on her back.
"You can. You can." John persuaded as she shakily attempted to breathe, only to enter a coughing fit. "That' it. Slow it down." John moved to his knees and wrapped an arm around to place on her back as she shook. "It's okay."
"Atlas, swing your legs off of the side and put your head between your knees," John said pushing her out of the hug and trying to force her to sit.
"Your so like your dad sometimes." John smirked as he thought about his husband. Where was he right now? Was he alive?
"Please take a seat." John smiled, the woman sitting down. Her hair was gold blonde, tight curls and fashioned back in a big clip. Hair upwards.
"I know," Sherlock said, a smile threatening to pull at the corners of his mouth. "I know." But then he frowned and shook his head. "Just, not now."
"Yeah." John laughed, before it died in his throat and he answered Sherlock's concern. "Your nightmares are allowed to be bad Sherlock." Pause. "You were tortured, you spent so much time watching me hurt to keep me alive, you have a brain that runs ten times the speed of light-"
don't want you to either." Sherlock smiled before he hugged John again. "We can go in a minute. I just need another hug."
"I think we need to run a CT scan to check for any recent brain trauma." The nurse said and then it became apparent to Atlas that maybe he wasn't a nurse.
"Okay." She said quietly, lurching forward into Sherlock's embrace. "The Holmes aren't cold." The little girl stated quietly as she hung her arms around his neck.
Later on, Eurus appeared. She'd followed Mycroft when he'd left in such a hurry. Apparently she was staying with Mycroft for the time being.
Sherlock looked up to John, who's eyes had gone glossy. The younger man stood and wrapped an arm around John and pulled him into a hug.
"Yeah." Atlas rasped. "The- the mask." She pointed to the oxygen mask that was just out of reach and Mrs Hudson helped place it on her face. "It does this sometimes."
"Don't like." Rosie whispered. Just loud enough for Wanda to hear, and the child walked around and climbed into her lap. Then presenting two hair bobbles, sat as he light brown hair was fashioned into two french plaits. Wanda and Timothy put everyone in the family at ease and so Rosie had quickly become accustomed to them. She liked Wanda alot and often curled up on her lap or had her hair done. She enjoyed stories read by Timothy, but the best ones are when they make them up together.
"Good." Sherlock said. "You need entertainment, and plus, they'll be needing all the help when that virus gets here from China."
"Yes. What were you guys watching?" Atlas asked smiling as she looked at her dad. She knew he was deducing and she knew she wanted to tell them both the truth.
"No, he's good at showing very little emotion. But Rosie trusts him, so he's past that test." Sherlock laughed before linking arms with John. They get to the stall and stop at the end of the queue. It was long, but they knew the wait wouldn't be too bad.
"I love you too, At," Rosie said before taking all the stuff out her lap and climbing into it for a hug.
"Cat. I have a cat. She's called Mou. A fluffy black and white...thing...she's very independent and we had a neighbour popping in to top up her thing and I forgot about her." Sammy said as he lay on his stomach and looked under the bed. "I'd have mentioned her earlier but I just got so caught up."
"It's alright, John,"  Sherlock soothed. "Don't speak. Okay?" He rested his forehead against John's as he blubbered.
"Alright. Bring her over and me and John will take her over to the hospital this evening." Sherlock said quietly before hanging up the phone and turning to look at John. "Eurus is bringing Rosie over."
"Alright. Enough." John said moving to stand between Sherlock and the man. "I don't know who you are, or what your doing here, but would you mind letting us get home."
"Yes." Leanne replied before John sighed thinking about the man who had passed away on that frightful flight that took away Abayomi Aduba aswell.
Rosie only continued to cry and John moved to collect Jeff and give him to her. "You start school soon." John said, bouncing against her front but that only made her cry harder.
"They found a tear in her oesophagus." Eurus replied. "She's ok, they've put her under a sedative for the time being."
ATLAS was throwing up at 3:30am, her stomach kept twisting and contracting at an uncomfortable pace. Her face went bright red and flushed whilst her body shook. A vice gripped her brain and squeezed it tightly as she threw up another round. All guests had previously departed and now Atlas found herself vomiting again.
"It's alright, I figured you'd say that." Sherlock said as he gave a small chuckle, Atlas looking at him confused. "I'm just warming John up to the idea of you not going." He said. "I mean, by law you don't have to anyway." Atlas nodded, before giving a little smile.
"Oh. Mrs Hudson. You really didn't have to. I can get it myself you know." Atlas somewhat scolded as she took the tea and Mrs Hudson laughed before turning to leave.
"She's...she's alive...but...I need my friend back...I need my...she's..." Sherlock sobbed into his hands whilst John stood off to the side looking out the window.
"Sammy! Sammy!" Rosie squealed as she got to her feet and ran over to him. He squatted down to take her hug. "I'm sorry about your sister."
"Well, that would be nice," Sherlock said as Atlas smiled at him. "Now, we were going to have a violin lesson today with Eurus on zoom but it's looking less and less likely that we can do that."
"Mr Peterson and Mrs Peterson. Still married. Youngest child died. Eldest moved away, domestic abuse." Atlas said before her eyes went into horror. Slowly she was rising to her feet again, but kneeled taking a moment to gather back her breath. "You abused your own blood. What brand of sick bastard does that require?"
"You got your lunch?" Sherlock asked his daughter who nodded as she put it in her school bag. They had agreed she would take a pack lunch to avoid the very possible over stimulant of the canteen. That and Sammy had said he would be doing the same because he didn't want to go into the canteen and face people. Especially because it had been a while since he'd seen some of them - due to his dad's death.
When they got halfway along the walk they stopped and, opening his rucksack, Sherlock produced a flask of hot water and a water bottle which he offered to Rosie. She took it before drinking some and handing it along to Sammy who smiled at her.
"Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep," Atlas said repetitively and the dog walks through the open door, sniffing at her hand. "Sleep, sleep, sleep."
"I've got you," John whispered. He knows she can't hear him but if anything he's the one who needs to hear it, to say it. He's terrified, in truth. He's absolutely shitting himself. This isn't a comfortable way to live, it's painful but she's his baby. "I've got you."
"A musical study." There was a brief pause. "You were hoping that I liked this one." Atlas remarked before she looked over the banister and she saw what she assumed was a toilet she hadn't seen before. She also saw the banister snaking along the wall to the bedrooms and she liked this feature.
"Sam?" Sherlock said suddenly, demeanour changing but the kid just continued his sobs with his arms clamped around the man's shoulders. "Hey, hey, it's okay. Hey. Love, I've got you. I'm here."
"So, guess what?" Sammy said, pulling a seat to the other side of the bed to John and Sherlock. "So, May has the hots for Michael Kiln in Lower Sixth and me and Xerxes keep making fun of her for it. Not much has happened since this morning. Oh, I'll tell you something really interesting...I managed to mix up my transposition things again..." Sammy laughed, John and Sherlock turning to look over. "I'm no good. When you get better, you need to teach me." Sammy sighed. "And Rosie. She was telling me that she wants to learn too." He smiled afterwards and looked to Rosie who was sitting on his knee.
"I've heard it's wonderful and all this talk of music has me remembering your cello, John," Isla said before John went wide eyed and shrunk.
"I thought as much. We'll make you some soup yeah?" John smiled as Atlas looked at him with a little smile, before she looked up at Sammy.
"He's three years old, he has a lot of life left in him yet." Atlas said smiling at her dad who nodded before stroking the dog again eagerly. It was as if all of his problems had disappeared and he was just
"Well...I...I put ice in. Like I'd seen dad do before. But he nor papa had put ice in theirs the night before, just water. They normally put it away but I think they were pretty drunk by the time they got to bed. They're jovial drunks." Atlas laughed. "So I was poisoned by the whisky which was poisoned by the ice. Papa and dad had just finished a case and they normally celebrate with some whisky so someone who knew the case was closing must've - must've done it or - or something. I don't know."
"We're going to meet Harry and Jo for some lunch at Zizzi's because they are flying to ABZ tonight," Atlas informed with a small smile and John nodded.
"Hey, hey." Sherlock said, clamping a large delicate hand over her tremors before tapping on a game called 'Nobodies' with his right hand. "It will be okay."
"She was trafficked." Atlas finally announced after some time, something hitting her hard in the chest as she looked up at John who rubbed a hand over his face.
"My son is many things, but crazy is not one of them." Wanda said standing infront of John defensively. "If my son makes your son happy, then why should we try to change that?"
"Out of the picture, dad didn't love her. Not really. Not the way he wanted to and she was...abusive so that ended when she went away when I was four." Atlas said looking at the menu and she felt John's hand go back to her back, rubbing gently.
"What are you up to?" John asked quizically as he tried his best to cast his mind back to anything Atlas may have mentioned.
"Would you blame them if they did?" Atlas asked with wide eyes. "I've stolen their time, their lives and I'm still sat here. In fucking hospital."
"Me and Sherlock were chatting," John said with a smile. "How do we fancy going out for a bit of fresh air after tea?"
"Deduced." Atlas said quietly, she looked up. "That and my dad's got a male partner." Atlas looked like she had just told a secret, even though she knew it wasn't really.
"Rosie." Eurus said drawing Rosie's name from a hat, the little girl squealing in excitement. She made her way to Eurus before jumping onto her lap, the dog gathering at their feet supposedly joining their team.
"About twenty, twenty-five minutes," Mycroft sighed from where he was reading a book. When he did look up he removed his glasses and looked at the two men. "You two should go back to Isla's and sleep. I'll stay with her tonight."
At 5pm they stopped for food and to walk the dog taking an hour and a half break. It was quite peaceful and they all laughed with one another and enjoyed their time there. They walked the dog about a mile and a half at a neighbouring forest and gave him a drink. Rosie sitting in the boot with him for a while whilst Atlas changed back into her high tops from some trainers.
"Twins," Atlas smiled before leaning back against the sofa and curling into John, Sherlock draping her blanket over the top of her before sitting on the floor. "I love you."
"Ugh, can I pretend I know how to play violin or something?" Peter exclaimed before harrumphing onto the floor by Atlas who was examining her instrument.
"I never thought you'd say yes." Sherlock said quietly, a lump of happiness catching in his throat. John rested his forehead against Sherlock as Redbeard came to lie by their feet.
"Probably." Atlas said as they found themselves in the Enterprise Van Hire driveway. Walking inside, the man at the desk nodded and Sherlock walked over to him.
However, it was addressed to John, and he sat reading it at the desk one evening. Atlas was around half way through her second reading of Timothy's book, this time taking pencil notes on the paper to best get a view on what he could improve on. She was determined to get him to try and publish it again. Mrs Hudson was downstairs and Sherlock was sat with Rosie in his lap as he plaited her hair in to two. He'd watched countless video's to get it just right.
"Family days doesn't necessarily mean the whole eight of us. It can just be the four of us though Sherlock." John laughed before the other man gave a deeper, heartier laugh.
"We have your results." Her smile dropped. "You have Functional Neurological Disorder, commonly known as FND." She paused. "This is in some ways a good thing, because it can be managed. The symptoms you experience can be managed through therapies and drugs." Atlas looked at her. "But we have to be glad that we caught it early enough. Now I'm sorry, I have to ask, Rosie, does she have any biological relation to you? I know Sammy does not."
"Atlas," John said gently. "She's on an additional lot of medication and it's making her sleepy this morning. I've told her to take one less because she's currently on three first thing on a morning."
"Its quite alright. I spent nine years in there and then I found my dad again. I live with him now and his husband, my papa, my sister Rosie and my brother, Sammy," Atlas smiled before she felt a presence at her shoulder.
"Yep, they're going to take it to the garage where the tyre will be swapped and we should be able to pick it up soon," John grinned before they left, locking the front door.
"The long one is only seven miles," Atlas said rolling her eyes. "Can we do that one? It goes up that hill and walks along the ridge, it'll be quieter, passes the viewpoint and goes elsewhere."
"My mother, was pointing a gun at me. Dad had to point one at her in hopes she would back down." Atlas said, frowning. "She didn't."
"Oh Atlas." Sherlock sobbed. "What's happened to you?" He kissed her forehead and closed his eyes as the tears fell.
"So." Sherlock said placing his violin in his case, the bow neatly being unwound and put on the top.
"Sweetheart, you haven't done anything wrong," John whispered, kissing her cheek and resting his forehead against her. "It's alright. Oh Atlas, sweetheart, I've got you. Your safe."
"Yeah, but...well..." Sammy stuttered. "It's everything. The music jam outs that we have. The society meetings."
Sammy's head rose from his arms before he got to his feet and made his way around to John's side and hugged him.
Alone she looked around, anxiety pooling in her stomach. The smells, the sights, the sounds, the taste of alcohol in the air and the touch of people made her want to throw up. It hadn't even been ten minutes and she already knew it was a mistake. A guy to her right came over and tried to engage in friendly conversation, tried to touch her arm but she pulled it away. She found herself in the kitchen.
"Do you attend school?" Mycroft asked as Atlas shook her head. She was fifteen now and wasn't long off being legally allowed to not attend, and plus it wasn't the right place for her.
"Ahh, makes sense," Sherlock said. "As a parent, the motive is to just get her to a hospital or find a way to make it stop. I didn't have time to watch it because all I was focused on was helping her to live."
"How're the rooms going to work? A-and money? And my car finance? And-and all that?" Sammy asked quickly.
"Yeah, yeah I want to go." Sherlock said getting to his feet before stopping and offering out his arms. Slowly, John stepped into his arms or rather, Sherlock, melted into John.
"Papa." She cried, Sherlock putting his book down and shuffling over towards his partner. Atlas remained at the door before entering and sitting on the bed. She then lay her torso on John's legs, curling up slightly.
"I just needed you, I don't want to be sat there crying when she comes to," Sammy whispered as Sherlock rubbed his back.
"I'm sorry papa. I'm sorry papa. I'm sorry papa. I want you to be my dad. I'm sorry papa. I'm sorry. I'm sorry." Atlas sobbed as she rested her temple back against his stomach, his hand resting on the side of her head gently.
"John." Atlas said from their secluded part of the kitchen. She placed a hand on his shoulder. "You need to tell Sherlock."
"I know you do," Sherlock said with a frown before kissing her forehead as Mycroft tidied away the files. She looked at him again, her eyes trained on the top button of his shirt and she looked cross eyed. After a few moments, she blinked at him before offering a smile which he returned. "Hug?"
"Me and dad went on a walk and we got lost and we just got back and our tyres flat and we need picking up a-" Atlas said quietly.
"Sherlock, it's late, I've had a really busy day and I don't have a donkey's arse about what your saying." John said opening one eye as Sherlock shut off the side light. "It's already tomorrow."
"Oh," Atlas whispered before she watched her dad delicately tracing the picture frame with his fingers. "It's...well...it's of..."
"For Sammy, he says it's because he's not used to a large family with loads of people who love and care about whether he lives or breathes. For Rosie, she knows no different-" John said.
"I'm Dr John Watson and I'll be teaching you about SHARE." He didn't need to look for Atlas. He could see her, sat near the back with a smiling Sammy and a girl he did not recognise. This was going to be hell when they got home, absolute
