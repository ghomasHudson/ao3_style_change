Not that the looks he and Steven had shared seemed to indicate Steven wanted to simply remain friends. Anthony just struggled to take the plunge when he knew the loss that would come later. Oh, he was happy to flirt – that came as naturally to him as breathing – but he wasn’t ready to make any actual moves in the direction of carrying it through. War was hardly a fitting place, anyway. Even if he and Steven
Allowing the almost-occurrence to pass by without mention, they lounged across Anthony’s carpets and pillows and talked as they ate cheese with bread and dried fruits. Eventually, the conversation turned to the source of Anthony’s concern and stress.
“I will face Thanos as I would a loathsome bandit upon the road, or a beast assaulting my father’s flock.” Steven reached over to where his belongings had been piled, rifling around them for a moment before producing the sling and leather pouch that had hung at his belt ever since he returned Anthony’s dagger. “Do you think I have time to visit the stream? I’d like to pick up some stones, if I can. I think I shall need one of just the right size.”
“I hope you brought a weapon of your own with you, then, if you’re planning on returning mine,” he teased lightly.
poorly. They were of the same rough-hewn fabric his usual garments were of. Anthony would have to fix that.
“It was no trouble. Besides, I quite enjoyed finding the chance to finally meet the man whose harp has so captured my father’s admiration.”
“I-I can’t,” Steven stuttered. “This is yours! And what would I do with a robe this fine, anyway? I’m just a shepherd.”
offer me the hand of one of his children in marriage and, while I haven’t met any of your siblings, I’m pretty sure I won’t change my mind about you being my favorite.”
their stations in life didn’t put miles between them. Not that there was anything set in stone just yet. There was only the possibility there, the ‘what if’ of a future not yet determined. Anthony knew his heart, knew how it yearned for intimacy and jumped at the smallest show of kindness and companionship from another.
"After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathon three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together - but David wept the most." - 1 Samuel 20:41
He swung off his horse and hit the ground running. Even if he hadn’t seen any blows land, he would not rest easy until he was able to check Steven over for injuries himself. Steven grinned as Anthony drew close, wrapping his arms around Anthony’s waist and lifting him into the air with a laugh, none of which was at
Only a few days later, Steven was back. Anthony probably shouldn’t have been surprised, but some part of him had seemingly decided that Steven’s appearance and their stimulating conversations had been… perhaps not
“Though I have a distaste for needless death, I have an unquenchable thirst for battle. I have fought with many opponents from all across the lands, and yet none has been able to come close to felling me. Choose a man from among your ranks and have him come down to me. If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects, O’ King; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us.”
Steven let out a bark of surprised laughter, stifling himself by tucking his face into the crook of Anthony’s neck.
, Steven. Do you really think my father is just going to let you go back to your old life like nothing happened? You know the rewards you’ve been promised. What are you going to do? Go back to tending sheep with your tax exemption, grand fortune, and royal marriage?”
With a nod of acceptance, Howard turned his horse and began the ride back to their camp. Anthony quickly followed, trusting their guards to watch their backs.
Howard grew more and more sullen, his brooding only interrupted by his bouts of aggression and rage. Anthony was called upon many times to attempt to soothe his father, though he wasn’t sure he actually did much to help. Still, it was not a task he felt he could leave to anyone else. His father was irrational once he got into one of his moods and he would take it out on whoever happened to be there. It was better for that to be Anthony than a hapless servant or guard.
Anthony bit back the confession that he was not so sure Yahweh was still with his father. He didn’t know Steven that well, could not be assured that he wouldn’t run off and tell Howard of Anthony’s words or, worse, the people. Something about Steven’s openness and genuine nature as he spoke made Anthony feel comfortable with him, but that wasn’t enough to break through his entire upbringing of conscientious distrust. Still, he could see Steven becoming a trusted advisor if they had more time. No wonder Howard had become so immediately fond of him.
“I actually already went by,” Steven admitted, causing Anthony to have to scramble for a moment to get his head back into the conversation as opposed to lost in his fears. “I didn’t want to have to cut our conversation any shorter than absolutely necessary.”
“Whatever you would like me to. I haven’t met the queen before, what is she like? What do you do when you’re not in court? Have you gotten to travel much? I’ve always wanted to, but, well…” He gave a chagrined smile. “What’s your favorite place that you’ve visited?”
“Well, we’d best get to tracking down your brothers,” he said, changing the subject rather than addressing what Steven had said. “Shall we?”
It was kind of him to say, but Anthony doubted that was true. He and his father had been close, once, but they clashed more and more often as of late, particularly with Howard’s increasing moodiness.
If Anthony had been surprised by Steven’s appearance, it was nothing compared to his surprise at what he discovered in conversation with the man on their way to find his brothers. Despite his low-standing in society and lack of education, Steven was incredibly well-spoken and dedicated to the Lord. He was a brave man who lamented that he was not able to join the other men in battle instead of rejoicing that he was allowed to stay home in relative comfort.
Steven’s journey back out of the camp took longer than it had any right to. Admittedly, though, that likely had something to do with Anthony insisting on feeding him before he got back on the road and it was only proper to host a guest in his own tent. They spoke of many things as they ate finely roasted meat with bread. Even once they had finished eating, they remained lounging across the many rugs and cushions that decorated Anthony’s tent.
The Philistines wanted to negotiate now? After all that had brought them here? Anthony could scarcely believe it. Perhaps, though, they had not expected that Howard would really be willing to head to war. Or perhaps they had underestimated the force of Israel. He glanced at his father to gauge his reaction, but Howard remained stoic.
“If I might impose,” the man spoke again, drawing Anthony’s gaze back up to his face, “I am in sore need of direction. I just arrived from my father’s house with food for my brothers, but I haven’t been able to locate them among the ranks.”
It was over a week before Steven came to the camp again, only to find Anthony in the throes of his distress. Every morning, Thanos had crossed the field between the Israelite and Philistine camps to make his proclamation once more. No man among their forces wished to stand against him, no matter the reward Howard offered. It wasn’t a stalemate which could last forever, though, and Anthony had to find a way to fix it before things came to a head.
Thanos, along with his own shield bearer and observers, including the rulers of the Philistine nation,s came out to meet them. Thanos strode out on foot, keeping pace easily with those on horseback, and sneered as he caught sight of the Israelites.
He was adorned in all bronze, from his helmet to his greaves. Glistening scale armor covered him like a coat. It had to be staggeringly heavy, and yet he carried it with ease. A javelin was slung casually across his back, its shaft as wide as a weaver’s rod, and a sword hung at his side. Whoever his man was, there was no doubt he was impossibly strong.
“You? You are more a boy than a man,” he mocked. “I’m surprised you managed to grow any of that beard of yours at all! And to come here unarmored? No sword! No spear! Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks? Come here, then, if you desire your death so greatly. I’ll give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field and Dagon will grind your bones to dust!”
Once the fighting was over, the wounded tended to and the dead gathered, the Israelite encampment celebrated. A great feast was prepared, or at least as much of one as could be mustered from what was available. They would throw a proper one at the palace, once they returned, but the joy of their triumph could not be contained. The tension that had been brewing over the past weeks was finally released and the warriors throughout the encampment were glad for it.
“Very well, then! If you spit upon your word, Israel will spit upon your corpses!” Howard roared in defiance.
“Will you be in the area in another hour or so? I should be finished up by then and I’d hate to get lost trying to find my way back out of here.”
“I’ve never worn armor before,” he confessed with a bit of a chuckle, as if they were only playing dress-up instead of preparing him to face a deathmatch with a giant. “It is much heavier than I imagined.”
“My brothers and I are the sons of Roger of Bethlehem,” he said, before boldly continuing. “I’m Steven.”
He rummaged through his pack for a moment before producing Anthony’s dagger. It gleamed with what was obviously a recent polishing and Anthony found himself oddly touched by the gesture.
Anthony’s heart screamed in denial. He rose to his feet and stepped toward Steven, hoping to talk some sense into him if his father wouldn’t, but Howard was already calling to a servant for his armor and sword to be prepared.
“What do you think?” Anthony asked his father quietly, not wanting to draw the attention of anyone else.
Anthony was still struggling to keep the mental image out of his mind when Steven did something completely unexpected.
For the first time, Anthony noted the pack that lay on the ground just behind the man, likely dropped when he’d reached out to keep Anthony from falling.
“Lions and bears. The sheep make easy prey, so I have to run predators off if they start getting too interested. A few smacks across the nose with a small rock is usually enough to deter them, but sometimes they can be rather stubborn and keep coming anyway.”
Steven bent to pick up his pack again and hoist it onto his shoulder, allowing Anthony a moment to appreciate the play of his muscles as he did so.
Instead of dodging backwards or to the side as he had been, Steven pushed further into Thanos’s space on the next swing. For a heart-stopping moment, it looked as if the fight was over, as if Thanos was going to bring the pommel of his sword down on Steven’s skull to cave it in, but then Steven just…
“A good man,” he praised. “Should you defeat Thanos, a small fortune shall be gifted to you from the royal family, and you and your father’s family will be exempt from the taxes of the Israelite nation. More than that, though, I will offer you the hand of one of my children in marriage.”
He wished he could be so confident. The priests taught them that none should worry and to trust in the Lord, but that was far easier said than done. Anthony
“Th-there is a man who says he can defeat Thanos!” the servant gasped out before Howard could even demand to know the reason for the interruption.
The man smiled down at him for a long moment that stretched just a beat too long before seeming to realize that he was still holding onto Anthony’s arms and quickly releasing him. He coughed awkwardly as a red flush stole across his cheeks, visible even through his darker-blond beard. The distance between them gave Anthony a chance to look the man over. Unlike Anthony himself, he was dressed humbly in a rough-wool kethōneth shift that only fell to his knees, sleeveless to leave his muscular arms on display, and a similarly low-quality simlāh robe. A rough leather belt was wrapped around his waist. His sandals were of leather, too, and so caked in dirt that they nearly blended in with his skin. Odd. Their camp had been set for several days already. None of the troops should have been walking enough to amass so much dirt.
“Hail!” Howard called out to him. “Announce yourself and your business for approaching our camp. Do you carry a message from the Philistines?”
“I wasn’t expecting to see you among my troops, not when I gave you special permission to remain home to tend your father’s sheep. Yet now I hear that you have voiced claims that you can best Thanos in combat.”
“Not really,” Steven demurred modestly, “but there are plenty of lions and bears that come after the sheep.”
Steven had clearly taken the time to clean up after the battle, Anthony noted. He was dressed in clothes that Anthony guessed were borrowed from his brothers, though they did not fit
“Very well, then. Let’s get you properly outfitted. I won’t have you going off to fight in your current state.”
“I couldn’t! It is much too fine for a shepherd like me. You have already been more than generous enough.”
“I insist. You can return it to me on your next trip to see your brothers, provided you bring a weapon of your own to replace it as your protection.”
Anthony watched his face for several long moments. Again, he felt the urge to be completely honest with Steven in a way that would doubtlessly be considered inadvisable.
eyes went so wide upon spotting Anthony that he was afraid they might pop out. He sputtered out something unintelligible, probably an apology of some sort, already starting to sink onto his knees, but Anthony waved that nonsense off.
Not a boy, indeed… Steven might be the youngest among his brothers, but Anthony suspected he was still only a few scant years younger than Anthony himself. The way his father had described his newest servant, Anthony had pictured some skinny little twig of a boy, lying in a field and daydreaming as he watched the clouds, not…
, but certainly embellished by the rosy tint of fond memory. Surely, Steven’s eyes hadn’t been that stunningly blue. Surely, his words hadn’t been so honey-sweet that Anthony was left wanting to lick them right off his lips. Surely, the warmth between them had not burned so strongly.
Murmurs ran all throughout the tent as the servant ran back out and Anthony moved to sit beside his father. A scowl marred Howard’s face, one that had not always been so stern at is seemed to have grown in recent years.
Anthony could still remember the first time he laid eyes on Steven, even years later. His father, King Howard, had gone off to war with the Philistines, Anthony at his side. Steven was already in Howard’s service by then, playing the harp for Howard when he got into one of his
“I manage,” he demurred modestly. “And I have gotten to travel quite extensively. I would have to say that Egypt is my favorite.”
Steven pulled aside a bit of his simlāh robe to show Anthony the leather pouch attached to his belt.
, but Anthony hadn’t had the occasion to meet him yet. As the crown prince, he wasn’t in the palace often, too busy conducting business around the kingdom in his father’s name.
“It is the finest make in all of Israel,” he told Steven seriously. “I will not send you into this combat unprepared. You are aware of the reward I have offered?”
A shout of pain startled them out of their moment and they whirled around to spot one of the Philistine leaders with a sword in hand. Howard clutched his own bloody arm, though the wound didn’t look terribly deep.
. He reappeared a moment later behind Thanos, having tucked and rolled between his legs in a move that would never have worked against a smaller man.
“There’s no need for that, I assure you,” he bade the man. He gave him a smile as Dum Dum, and he really did hope that was a nickname, cautiously rose. “I’m only here as a guide, so there’s no need to stand on ceremony.”
“Then I hope you will partake in trying some of them with me. I will confess a weakness for cheese. I do not believe I would be able to wait.”
The leather of the horse’s reins bit painfully into Anthony’s palms with the tightness of his grip as he and the others drew back. He felt almost as though it were a physical struggle to guide his mount away from the two combatants. He wanted nothing more than to jump down and join Steven’s side, but doing such would be an act of war and spell a fate for the Israelite nation far worse than death. Anthony could not be responsible for that.
Forty days after the arrival of the Philistines, nearly a month and a half since the start of the stalemate, things finally came to a head. Anthony was once again in council with his father when one of Howard’s servants came barging into the tent, disregarding any and all social protocol.
After Steven left once again, Anthony found himself torn between his attraction to Steven and what he knew to be the reality of the situation. He hardly knew Steven, and this was hardly the time or place for even a carnal dalliance, even
But that was not his lot in life. Anthony had a role to play in his nation, for his people and his father’s house. He was all too aware that there were those who would take his attraction or even friendship as a chance to advance their own station. It’d happened before and, while he did not have the fear that Steven was among that number, he had grown far too wary to take a chance at revealing himself and his desires, whether physical or emotional. It didn’t matter the handsomeness of Steven’s physique, nor his wit and kindness that made Anthony yearn for something more.
Anthony pressed it into his hands anyway, shamelessly allowing his fingers to linger upon the other man’s flesh.
Steven gazed at him for a long moment before cupping the back of Anthony’s neck with one warm hand and pulling him closer to press their foreheads together.
Anthony had just left a meeting of the war council. The Philistine forces were approaching from Socoh, in Judah, set to arrive in less than a week, and they were numerous. Even with Yahweh on their side, it would be a hard-won fight and many men would fall, Anthony was sure of it. The council had decided that the Valley of Elah, where they were camped, would be a fitting location for the forces to meet and had begun to draw up the battle lines in preparation. Howard and Anthony had argued, but there was nothing unusual about that. Anthony had watched as the months passed and his father became more and more agitated and volatile. Sometimes, it was as if a dark spirit resided within him, taking control and making him lash out at any and everyone who was unfortunate enough to be around him. Steven’s music was one of the only things that could calm him.
Yes. Definitely not the things a member of the court would have wanted to know. Except, perhaps, for the question about Anthony’s mother, but that would have been leading, looking for ways to gain her favor.
The next morning, Howard announced to the camp that he was offering a great reward to any man who could defeat Thanos, and that he would offer the hand of one of his daughters in marriage on top of that.
It was, perhaps, more than just a little strange to think that one of his sisters was going to be married to the man he’d managed to fall in love with, but Anthony was just doing his best not to think of it. It hurt less that way.
“Our shared history may be sordid, I’ll grant you, but they have some of the finest craftsmen of any nation. It was there that I acquired my robe.”
Anthony stared at him for a long moment before a nigh-hysterical giggle bubbled up from within him. He let his head fall forward onto Steven’s shoulder and squeezed his eyes shut, if only to stave off the torrent of emotions. With his face pressed into silk, he didn’t dare cry. It’d ruin the fabric.
Steven. As much as he thought he’d enjoy a simple roll in the hay, he couldn’t help but imagine the possibility of a deeper connection between them and had to quickly school himself away from such thoughts. At this point, he’d rather keep Steven around as a friend than as a one-time lover who disappeared as soon as they were both satiated.
Anthony’s heart pounded in his chest, fear gripping him. In his darker moments, when he had thought about what would happen if he fell fighting Thanos, he had taken some small comfort in knowing that Steven would be safe. Even if Howard decided to break his word and attack the Philistines after Anthony’s death, Steven would be tending his father’s sheep and in no danger. He might end up enslaved, yes, but he would be alive, and Yahweh would deliver the Israelite nation in the end. The thought of Steven going up against Thanos, though…
So, yeah, David really fought lions and bears on the regular, even though we always picture him as this scrawny little twig. And he and Jonathon (Tony) were definitely getting it on.
“My king knows my skill and ability. This day I defy the ranks of Israel,” the man crowed. “Give me a man and let us fight each other!”
“I almost didn’t,” Steven confided with good humor. “Navigating the roads were easier than finding my way around this encampment! If it weren’t for Anthony, I might have ended up back in the desert.”
“I don’t know,” he confessed, “but I will not let the tribes of Israel go quietly into the slavery we fought so hard to overcome.”
His sword dropped from limp fingers and he fell to one knee. Blood dripped down his face and, even at such a distance, Anthony could make out the struggled heaving of his chest.
Though Anthony missed Steven during his absences, he wasn’t given a great deal of time to dwell on it. There was much to be done around the Israelite camp to keep it running smoothly, even without any active fighting going on. Supplies had to be requisitioned and ordered, watches and scouts needed to be organized, and appearances needed to be made in order to keep up morale. The longer the situation stretched, the more anxiety Anthony felt. It was a sentiment shared by many throughout the Israelite ranks as Thanos continued to appear day after day with his proclamation, jeering and taunting them as he did.
They continued their dance of bobbing and weaving. Steven needed space between them in order to use his sling, but couldn’t get it with Thanos’s relentless charge. With Thanos’s experience and skill in battle, he was probably trying to tire Steven out. All he needed was a single slip-up and his sword would find flesh. It wasn’t a comforting thought.
“Then let us hope it does not come to that. Perhaps there is one among your father’s forces who will step up to the challenge. As you said, there are many here who are unknown to you.”
“No, of course not. Prioritizing your own life over those of stock animals would be completely ridiculous.”
As Howard spoke at length about faith and duty, Steven continued to sneak glances Anthony’s way. Every one made him smile a little more. As exhausted as he was from the day, Anthony couldn’t help but feel his spirits lifted by the Warmth in Steven’s eyes. In the firelight that lit the tent, the cut of Steven’s jaw and cheeks were even more pronounced that usual. Warmth kindled low in Anthony’s core.
“I can understand that. The Philistines will be here tomorrow afternoon at the latest and then it’s only a matter of time before the fighting begins. Once it starts, there’s no telling which way things will go.”
Anthony grimaced at the use of his official title but nodded in gracious acceptance anyway. It would be rude to do anything less.
Again, Steven’s eyes flickered toward Anthony. He wished he knew what the other man was thinking. He wished there was something he could do to
“What right do I have to do any less than them?” he asked Anthony without even a hint of irony in his voice. “Less than you?”
Anthony willed himself to reach out and take it, to, for once, not let his weird, stupid quirk get in the way of things. He just… couldn’t quite manage it.
Steven threw himself to the side, rolling in the grass and springing back to his feet. He clasped his sling in one hand and had the other on his pouch of stones where it was tied to his belt. Thanos didn’t give him any time to recover, though, turning and charging at him once more with a great cry. Again, Steven dodged.
He wasn’t sure quite what he expected. Most people of Steven’s station were prone to throwing themselves into the dirt at Anthony’s feet when they found out who he was, but Steven had already shown little to no reaction to his obvious wealth. What he hadn’t expected was for Steven’s grin to become even wider as his eyes flitted over Anthony’s form once again.
He could tell the moment Steven’s gaze found it, because his entire face lit up with a grin so bright it left Anthony momentarily stunned. Steven picked up speed and raised one hand in an exuberant wave at the same time as he called out to the man at the fire, “Dum Dum!”
He turned in that direction as if to urge his father’s compliance, but Howard didn’t move, eyes fixed in the distance still. His brow furrowed and eyes narrowed in an attempt to see more clearly.
“My mother had it commissioned for me, actually,” he confessed, though it was something he normally would not have. It’d been completely out of the blue and one of the only things he had to give him physical proof that she still loved him the way she once had when he was a child. “She saw me admiring some that we saw among the court there and so she found the weaver who had made them and commissioned this. Red is my… favorite color.”
“Very well, then. When I have cleaved your head from your shoulders, we will see how great your Yahweh is.”
“I don’t have any desire to be traveling these roads after dark. They are far too dangerous for a lone man with no weapon to defend himself.”
The distance back from the pizza place where he’d met Ty for their date seemed to trail on for hours now that he didn’t have a ride.  It was his own fault for being so stupid.  What were the odds that Ty would actually be into him?  Apparently not very good.  At least not as good as the odds of it being a prank, which had turned out to be no less than 100%.  In hindsight, Tony should’ve seen it coming.  He rubbed his shoulder again.  It was lucky it hadn’t been dislocated, considering the amount of force Rumlow’d yanked his arm back with during the ambush.  Climbing back into the rear window of the house proved to be a challenge.  Without the full use of all four limbs, it took several minutes of pained grunting and incriminating thumps before Tony landed with a dull thud on his back, crushed at an awkward angle between his bed and the wall under the window.  Cursing himself for making so much noise, Tony pulled himself onto the bed and collapsed spread eagle, staring at the ceiling.  Some of the paint was peeling off above his bed.  He threw an empty water bottle at it and sneezed as the flakes fell on his face.  With a groan of defeat, he grabbed for his phone out of his backpack, yanking it out from the tangle of garbage that had collected on top of it.  On second thought, he grabbed a pack of Newports from the inside pocket of the bag and scoffed.  Only two left.  He’d have to steal more from Howard tomorrow.
By the time Tony made it out of fifth period, he’d been lulled into a false sense of security.  Aside from the incident in English class, it had been a pretty quiet day.  He hoped it stayed that way.  Maybe he’d feel good enough to work on his blueprints when he got home.
It turned out to be not that far.  The school was only just out of sight when his legs gave out and he crumpled into a heap on the sidewalk, wheezing and trembling.  The hollowness in his stomach was even more pronounced after his sprint, as were the aches and pains that never quite seemed to fade away entirely.  After a few minutes of gasping, he was able to limp to a gas station nearby.  It was New York.  Nobody paid him any attention.  That was good.  He wasn’t sure if he could have handled it if anyone had stopped him to talk.  He yanked a diet Coke and a bag of sunflower seeds down from the shelf and paid as quickly as possible.  Not able to face the idea of public transportation, he shuffled to the bathroom and sat in a stall, pulling his feet up to his chest.  The tears flowing from his eyes ran over his lips.  The sunflower seeds tasted saltier than usual.
“Aw, look at the little fag.  He’s fucking blushing.  Hey, I thought you were supposed to be a genius or something.”  A chorus of obnoxious laughter followed, earning a shush from the teacher.  For the second time that day, Tony felt his eyes burn as much as his cheeks.  He blinked back tears and pretended not to notice the whispering coming from the peanut gallery behind him.  He didn’t hear anything but that for the rest of the hour.
Just a word of warning: Steve acts more like a high school student than Captain America in this chapter.  Peer pressure gets to him a bit, but I promise I love him and he'll get his redemption!  Either way, I enjoyed writing this chapter, so enjoy 1am angst!
“How was your date last night, Stark?  I can’t believe you honestly thought he liked you.”  The boy laughed as his friends egged him on.  One of the others ripped the scarf off his neck, inciting another series of howls from the group.
“I knew you weren’t paying attention.  I fumbled the last pass and lost us the game, Tony.”  He glared, but his eyes were soft.
If you need something a little happier, I just posted a short porn snippet.  Go check out my most recent work if you feel so inclined to read 1600 words of nookie.
“I guess this is fine.”  He cringed at how hoarse he sounded.  Getting choked by a football player really did a number on the larynx.  After a brief moment of self-pity, he shoved his feet into a pair of scuffed combat boots and headed to the kitchen.  The knot of tension in his chest loosened a tiny bit at the sight of an empty room.  He glanced at the fridge and quickly turned away.  Coffee was fine.  He glanced around the room out of habit, and once he was satisfied that he was alone, dumped a packet of instant coffee grounds into a travel mug and filled it with hot water as quickly as his shaking hands would allow.  He looked at the fridge a second time, once again turning back to screw on the lid to the mug.  He’d eaten a turkey sandwich the day before, the shaking was probably just from stress.
“Rain.  It figures,” Tony grunted as the first splashes of rain snuffed out his cigarette.  He reached for his waist to pull on his jacket, cursing internally when he found it missing.  Probably still in Ty’s car.  Perfect.  He dropped the cigarette on the ground and crushed it under his boot heel and pulled his sweater up to cover his head.  His elbow twinged from where Ty had grabbed it.  Come to think of it, his whole body ached.  He could already feel the bruises forming under his clothes from the grabbing hands and the ache deep in his chest.
“You’re such a hypocrite.  I know you missed that pass the other day because you were making goo-goo eyes at Carol.”  Rhodey flipped him off as Tony laughed.
“Anything for my platypus, platypus.”  Rhodey laughed and picked him up, swinging him around before Tony had the chance to protest.  Once he sat him back down, Rhodey looked at him intently.  Realizing that he was waiting for a reaction to the game, Tony fumbled for something that would indicate that he’d been paying attention to anything besides Steve Rogers’ butt.  “You did great, honeybear!”  Rhodey rolled his eyes.
“Aye aye, captain.”  Rhodey flashed him finger guns and disappeared into the locker room.  Before Tony had even made it to the main entrance of the school from the football field, his path was blocked by a group of red jerseys.  Tony cringed internally, probably externally too if the laughter from in front of him was anything to go by.  Once again, he was faced with Rumlow and Tiberius, but now with even more groupies than the last time, a majority of the team at this point.  Including Steve Rogers.
“Dammit, Tony, that’s not fine.  Anyone hitting you for any reason is never fine.  Are you sure you’re not really injured?  You know I can be at your house in ten minutes if I need to be.”
“Alright, I’m going.  Are you sure you don’t want a ride home?  It’s a long walk back to your place and I’ll only be a few minutes.”  Tony shook his head.
“It was a prank, pumpkin pie, alright.  He was just messing with me, don’t worry about it.”  Tony winced as he heard a crash and a string of cursing from the other line.  He held the phone away from his face.
“Hey, Stark.  How are you feeling?  You up to a second date yet?”  Ty laughed as Rumlow clapped him on the back and the others cheered him on, all except Steve.  He was silent.  He looked uncomfortable with his hands shoved in his pockets.  Ty didn’t let up.
“Well?”  Tony startled, staring up at the disapproving face of the English teacher.  She pursed her lips.
He wandered into the cafeteria and before he could finish the thought, a pair of rough hands grabbed him from behind.  Tony’s heart dropped to his stomach.
The ride to school was just as much of a nightmare as he’d imagined.  The yelling and laughter surrounding him was hell for the headache he’d been sporting since the night before.  The pounding behind his eyes and temples increased with every bang and shove.  Stumbling off the bus and into the school felt like a fever dream.  He rested his head against the cool metal of his locker, just long enough to ease the crushing pain in his skull.  He felt his stomach cramping from the beating and hunger pains as he stood straight and keeled back over against the lockers, torso curled over his textbooks.
“Uh uh, no way.  You can’t distract me.  Tell me about your date,” he said, scrubbing a hand across his face.
“Are you fucking kidding me?  Tony, that’s fucked up.  Are you okay?  Did he hurt you?”  Tony let out a watery laugh.
“I told you it’s fine, Rhodey.  Just a few bruises from him and his band of cronies.  Nothing I’m not used to.”  Rhodey cursed again.
Of course, that plan was destined to fail.  There was only so long you could sit next to someone for an hour each day before you were forced into the pleasure of each other’s company for real.  That day came on a rather unfortunate Thursday afternoon.  Tony slid into the classroom and slunk to his desk.  After a particularly nasty run-in with Brock in the bathroom, he wasn’t in any mood to even pick his head up, let alone socialize.  Tony said a silent prayer to anyone who might’ve been listening to let him make it through the rest of the day without any more issues.  He got a response almost immediately in the form of a cosmic fuck-you on the whiteboard.
“Sorry, buddy.  I guess football doesn’t do much for me.  It’s hard to keep track.”  Rhodey smirked.
‘I didn’t hear from you.  Did you make it home?’  Tony sighed dreamily and looked back to the stars.
“I’m not a damsel in distress, Rhodey.  I don’t need your permission to go on a date.  Besides, what difference does it make if he and his goons beat me up?  It’s not like Howard isn’t already.”  He panted from the outburst and Rhodey sighed.
“What, so you think I’m not good enough for someone like Ty?  That there’s no way he’d be into me?”  He sat up and kicked his backpack across the room, relishing the bang it made.
“The game is still a couple weeks away.  Besides, you’re always more important than football.  It’s just a game, Tones.  You’re my best friend.  I can’t believe I let this happen.  I should’ve known better than to let you go out alone with him.”  Tony felt an irrational anger claw up his throat.
Tony sighed.  Maybe in another universe Steve Rogers wasn’t the quarterback and football captain and Tony wasn’t the world’s punching bag.  Maybe in that universe Tony’s crush wasn’t so hopeless.  He let his face flop into his hands with a groan and stayed there until he heard the game begin again.  This time, Steve was all Tony could see.  The bulk of his shoulders and broadness of his chest under the pads, all the way down to his ass in those unreasonably tight football pants.  He bit his lip and shifted his bag into his lap to prevent anything incriminating from showing.  The game drug on for what felt like hours, but Tony was too enthralled in his fantasy of Steve looking at him the way football players looked at the cheerleaders.  He didn’t even realize the game had ended until the disappointed booing and cursing rose up around him.  He stumbled to his feet to avoid the angry stampede of disappointed fans and allowed the crowd to push him off the bleachers and towards the exit.
“I bet you’re still getting off on the last one.  Rumlow said you like to get choked.  Is that right, bitch?  You get off on that?”  Tony shook his head and looked at the ground, trying to walk past the group.  An arm shot out and stopped him.  Tony cringed at the impact to his ribs.  Bumps like that had gotten more painful over the last few months.  Or the last fifteen pounds, however you wanted to look at it.  The sudden blow had him sprawling on the ground.  A sharp pain shot up his spine and wrists on impact with the grass.  Tony blinked back tears from the throbbing in his bones.  It hurt more than it should’ve.  He looked up again.  All the boys were laughing.  Except for Steve.  Steve was silent.
He lit the first cigarette with a flourish and blew rings in the air above him as he opened his messages.  He’d missed five from Rhodey.  Two were about his date with Ty and the others were sent an hour after the previous texts about the Homecoming football game.  Tony sighed.  Football was a pointless sport full of hypermasculine ape-men in inexplicably shiny tights fighting over a sack of air, but he loved his platypus and he’d go, if only because he had nothing better to do at this point.  Instead of typing out a reply about his date and fielding the barrage of texts that would without a  doubt follow, he dialed Rhodey’s number.  His friends picked up on the second ring.
Shit you guys, I'm the worst.  I told myself that I'd have this done by the end of the year.  Clearly, that has not happened.  On the upside, I've managed to move out and start at a four-year university with minimal suicidal ideation so that's fun.  Anyway, I think the updates will more regular from now on.  Maybe.  Please excuse the melodrama, this chapter was sponsored by depression and a horrible cold.
“Alright, guys.  We’re going to be trying something different today.  I’ll be assigning seats for the remainder of the year.  Those of you who have asked me for extra help outside of class will be seated with one of your more mathematically inclined peers.  Tony had to bite back a horrified choke as Mr. Richards began to assign seats.  There was no way he was getting out of this without tutoring some bonehead jock for the rest of the school year.  “Okay, Tony, I need you to come sit up here please, next to Steve.”  Tony’s heart jumped up his throat.  This was easily the worst case scenario he’d hoped to avoid.  Heart hammering in his chest, Tony slid silently into the seat beside Steve.  He didn’t make eye contact, didn’t even look over except to catch a quick glance.  Steve looked deeply uncomfortable and a brief flash of emotion (shame?  Horror?  Regret?) washed over his face.  Although it couldn’t be that.  Guys like Steve didn’t feel bad about making people like Tony miserable.  Tony spared another defeated glance at the boy beside him.  His bulky frame took up a bit too much space at the desk to be entirely dignified.  Tony sighed quietly and rested his chin in his hand.  This week just kept getting better.
“Oh, give me a break, Tony.  You know I don’t think that.  But I was right, wasn’t I?  To not trust him with you?”  Tony growled in anger.
“I dunno, man.  It seems like you’re getting more than enough of that.  Have you lost weight?”  Tony shrugged, not meeting his eyes.
“Tony, I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean it like that.  I just worry about you.  All the shit with your parents is bad enough.  I just want to keep you as safe as I can.  I feel so powerless with Howard.  At the very least I want to be able to keep you safe from my own fucking teammates.”  Tony laid back down on the bed, the fight drained out of him.
Once he was able to break free from the crowd, Tony darted off to the side and headed for the locker rooms.  He’d learned his lesson about waiting in plain sight, so he ducked behind a hedgerow beside the entrance and waited for Rhodey.  Once most of the players had made their way inside, Tony slipped out from his cover and wrapped his arms around his friend from behind, startling a grunt from the other boy that quickly morphed into a grin.
“Oh my God, listen to that voice, Brock.  The little cunt likes sucking cock too.  You sound like a paid whore, Stark.  You like getting dicks slammed down your throat until you’re raw?”  Tony choked on a sob.  In a moment of desperation, he wrenched himself free from their grip and sprinted out of the school.  He’d get in trouble later for skipping sixth period, but all he could think to do was get as far away as his legs could carry him.
“Of course, kid.  Sleep well.”  Staving off the burn behind his eyelids became an impossible feat once Rhodey hung up.  He flipped over violently.  If he cried himself to sleep with his face shoved into the pillows, well, Rhodey didn’t have to know that.  It was going to be a long year.
Tony wiped what he dirt he could from his clothes, but the grass stains and particularly muddy patches were there to stay.  By the time he’d finished his emergency makeover, students had begun to stream in.  Tony did his best to blend in, but his appearance stuck out like a sore thumb.  He just prayed he wouldn’t run into any of the football players today.
Once he was in, the bathroom was only a few doors down.  He slipped inside and looked in the mirror, cringing at his appearance.  There was mud smeared on his cheek and he was sporting a pretty decent black eye.  The smeared mascara around his eyes really added to the prominence of his dark circles.  Wiping the dirt off was fairly easy with a damp paper towel, but the makeup was there to stay.  Figuring it was a lost cause, Tony kneeled down under the hand dryer and made a sorry attempt to “blow dry” his matted curls under the gusts of hot air.  It was more of a success than he’d expected.  His hair was still more unruly than he’d prefer, but it was better than before.  At least the now-dried grime was easier to brush out with his fingers.
The whole thing was making Tony twitchy.  If he thought it was bad being mostly invisible, this might actually be worse.  Steve always looked with an intensity that made Tony wildly on edge the whole time.  He could feel the judgment washing over him each and every time as Steve sized him up, almost like he was still deciding what he thought of his new math partner.  Despite his best efforts to the contrary, every time he felt Steve’s eyes on him, he couldn’t help the hot flash of self-consciousness that flooded his body.  No matter how hard he tried to fight it, he couldn’t deny that Steve was an attractive guy (and if Tony sucked his stomach in a little extra or fixed his hair when he felt that gaze, well.  What difference did it make?).  Maybe they could get through the remainder of the school year without doing anything more than that.  Tony for one wouldn’t be instigating any small talk.  Hopefully, Steve followed suit.
When he arrived in physics class, he slunk to the back and took his seat.  Mr. Richards took his place at the front of the class as the bell rang.
The next few minutes were felt like an eternity.  The occasional shove or kick punctuated the insults being spewed at him.  Tony curled into a ball on the ground, a million miles away.  Even the hardest of the hits felt strangely dulled.  Tony wasn’t sure how long it was before he realized that he was alone.  His eyes peeled open, scratchy and slightly out of focus.  He fumbled for his glasses and slipped them back on.  The glass was cracked.
giving Tony the cold shoulder, he’s just not comfortable with this set-up, but he knows the inventor is right: he’s been less than friendly, and he could make more of an effort to get along. No conflict is one-sided, even if Tony is deliberately pushing his buttons. He doesn’t feel like himself, either. Steve isn’t sure what ‘himself’ feels like anymore. It’s tough to make friends when you don’t know who you are, or what you want. And Tony is tough to get a read on, even if the man can’t seem to keep his mouth shut. There’s a lot more to the inventor than meets the eye, something softer beneath the jovial and carefree playboy who thinks he owns the world.
They spend a few minutes in silence, Steve keeping his hand rested on Tony’s shoulder, and Tony crying quietly into his arm until he’s sure he’s done. He gives himself a bit of time for his eyes to dry before sitting up. There, that’s better.
Steve is nodding affirmatively, ready to go. His whole body is buzzing, ready for a fight. That’s what it’s made for, Tony supposes. Fighting, moving, working. Just like the engineer is, but in a different way. Tony is wired to fix and build, and Steve is wired to punch things.
“No.” Fury is firm. “Too shiny, and too obvious. If they realize the Avengers are onto them, it could shut down the whole circle and we’ll lose our leads.”
Tony shrugs and drops a straw into the can. “Lifetime warranty’s a thing. Besides, anything my dad made, I can fix.”
They stay up for a little longer. DUM-E manages to put the coffee on without burning the house down, and Tony positions himself so that he can massage Steve’s legs. They’re still tingling a little, according to the soldier. Tony happily rubs new life into them, digging his fingers into the muscles as he admires them. There’s a lot of Steve to love. They talk about mundane things and sip coffee. Steve laughs, his eyes bright. Tony asks him about what he does in his spare time, about the sights he explores, and the food he eats. It feels natural, like he’s known this man all his life.
JARVIS catches him. A suit appears beneath him, opening from the back so he can slot neatly inside. It folds around him, and soars away from the earth.
“Long as you like,” Tony stands up. “Hang tight, cupcake. Be right back.” The world feels brighter and warmer. Maybe tonight he can ignore his projects and actually get a healthy amount of sleep.
He’s pressed into the ground on his stomach, an arm tucked under his ribs and pushed uncomfortably into them. It’s not his arm, he realizes, but rather the arm of the person crushing him into the forest floor.
Steve can’t argue with that. He knows that despite what the serum has done for his mind, SHIELD wants his body more. He’s a machine, capable of tearing down enemies on his own. He’s reusable, capable of regenerating so quickly and from even the most horrific wounds that his new employer simply throws him into any situation too dangerous for another man to undertake. Tony’s the brains here, he knows it. Knew the second Fury announced this partnership. He’s the bodyguard, the meat suit intended to get Tony wherever he needs to be so the genius can get the information they need about the base to map out its destruction. Then, when they have that, they’ll send him right back in to finish it off.
“Nope,” Steve’s ears dust fuscia, and the color reaches down his neck underneath the collar. Tony wonders how far down it goes.
“You’re spacing out, big guy,” Tony turns around and walks backward, waving a hand in his face. “Wakey wakey.”
it. But he resists, taking the effort to stay relaxed instead of closing in on himself. Tony’s right again, and though the inventor
“Hey,” Tony gets up to help him, guiding him over to the couch. His heart is hammering in his chest.
Did a computer just complement him? Steve’s tickled by that, and there’s a possibility it’s because he feels as though Tony himself had given the praise. “You’re doin’ great,” Steve assures. He raises his hands, determined to shoot down this HYDRA agent once and for all.
It’s landed on the shore not too far away, but safely removed from the fight. To his surprise, Tony is already there when he lands on the pebbles by the helicopter. His helmet is off, and he’s smiling. The sun’s on his hair, and he looks... handsome. “Bout time cupcake. Finally listening to reason and rhyme, are you?”
So they walk, and Steve starts to wonder if he prefers this silence over constant chatter. The atmosphere is tense as a horror film (not that he’s seen many).
Steve realizes he’s smiling. Having it pointed out only widens it, and he flushes a little as he fights to school his expression.
Happy is waiting for them in the car, and watches as they both slide into the back seat. “Captain,” he greets. “Where to?”
Tony drags. He pulls Steve’s body through the trees, and to his surprise, he spots their camp almost right away. Somehow, they haven’t landed far from it. Which means the cave is nearby.
“Only one way to fix that,” Tony shrugs. “Course I’m sure. Somebody’s gotta keep an eye on you and make sure you do as you’re told.”
plenty of people. But never like this. There’s no time to think about the details, about what Steve and his old-timey morals might think about this. There’s no time to think about what this might do for their friendship, or how awkward it might be if this doesn’t work and they still end up living together for these three weeks, or if Steve leaves.
quite dark, and it would be wise to make sure no other creatures have made their home in here. He’s not the mood for bear-wrestling.
Guilt eats up enough of the brick in Steve’s throat to allow him to speak. “What do you know about this facility.” Work is always a good conversation-starter, safe and ultimately necessary.
Steve is already awake, blinking drowsily around the room. There’s a relieving lack of equipment attached to him, just a vitals machine really, and an IV pumping as much morphine as is physically possible into his bruised body. He’s wearing a padded plastic collar and a brace on his wrist, and Tony can see the bulk of bandages wrapped around his ribs. The powder blue gown is a snug fit around his wide shoulders, doing nothing to hide how huge the soldier is.
Tony looks between them. “I’m flattered you think so highly of my hacking abilities, even if it’s in comparison to yours, but can’t you just bomb the place?”
The suit. He’s trying to look at the suit. He knows that with a few tweaks he can improve the design, strengthen a few areas while easing back on others. The way Rogers moves suggests it’s stiff in the shoulders. Tony could fix that. He could probably improve the polymer, too. Make the fabric more agreeable. Improve how it slips on and off.
Someone shouts. Steve turns as fast as JARVIS can move his legs. Out from the back door of the facility walks a man easily as tall as Steve, and surely broader. He’s lifting a SHIELD agent over his head and throwing him. JARVIS doesn’t need to be told: he helps the Captain fly over as fast as he can. Steve yanks his shoulders up, and the suit brings his hips upward. The heels of his boots smash into the enemy soldier’s chest. Steve lands on his feet with a light thud.
“Yup,” Steve agreed, taking what’s handed to him. “Took me a while to find my way around. Kinda got distracted by the view.”
Tony doesn’t like feeling manipulated, but he has to admit that an underhanded approach was the only way of making this arrangement work. He sits there in silence, trying to decide how he feels about all this. Fury is right though, he’s glad to have had the company. What irks him the most is that he still feels Fury is flippant about Steve’s safety.
“Then stop joking around and disregarding rules!” Steve exclaims. “Fury told you to leave your tech behind for a
“We have no idea how much firepower they have,” Fury disagrees before a deeply-frowning Steve can protest. “There’s a good chance they have nukes stored at the facility. We need to take this down more discretely, sneak in and shut down their operations.”
“I hope she burned them,” Tony’s all swagger and confidence until Steve’s pulling on the strings of his gown and letting it fall away from his body. Suddenly he’s sitting there basically naked, save for his underwear, the collar round his neck, and the bandages on his chest. There’s a lot of Steve to behold, all of him covered in beautiful milky skin. Tony catches himself staring and quickly pulls the shirt over Steve’s head. By the time the soldier’s face is poking through, the engineer is down on one knee feeding the pants onto his legs. It’s enough time to get himself under control.
Next is a black shirt, and it’s very snug, hugging his toned body. Over top goes a bullet-proof vest, and he’s flattered that Fury thinks him so valuable.
Tony pulls out a flashlight, but Steve shakes his head. “Just follow me,” he orders. “They might send out night patrols. I can see fine.”
“I’ll uh, leave you to it?” he offers. “JARVIS can order dinner. Whatever you want. I’ll be, um, down in my workshop. If you want me.”
“Better than those ridiculous pleated pants you showed up to the helicarrier wearing two years ago,” Tony crinkles his face. “You don’t still wear those, do you?”
know what it feels like when people can’t see past something about you. For the inventor, that’s his brand, the market he used to be associated with. And for Steve, it’s his body. He’s always been objectified, even when he was small and weak and worthless. That’s all he’s ever been, either a sick, useless sack of bones, or big, powerful sack of muscle.
The silence doesn’t last. “Why you givin’ me the cold shoulder? Did I do something terrible to you?” Tony asks, caught somewhere between disappointed and uncaring, like he can’t decide if he wants Steve’s approval simply because he doesn’t have it, or because he genuinely wants it.
He wants Steve, and Steve wants him back. This feels like a turning point second only to the birth of Iron Man. It feels good.
“Makes the trip worth it. Loads more roads up here like this. I could show you around. Take the convertible, get the wind in your hair, sun on your face. It’s nice.”
“Aw, is that a complement, Soldier?” Tony bats his eyes and grins. “If they get their hands on this, and try to use it, JARVIS will ruin their systems from the inside. You think my tech is that easily cracked? This thing is encrypted better than the pentagon. Which I have hacked for fun, by the way.”
The drive up to the house is shorter than it usually feels. Steve’s staring out the window, watching the world go by. They get further and further from the city, finally pulling onto open road. The view is pretty good, and it’ll only get better. Tony smiles and watches his friend admire the seaside view with a warm heart. The soldier’s hand is sitting right there on the seat beside him, within reach, almost asking to be touched.
,” Fury explains. “Inside info reports that their security measures are too advanced for our tech experts to crack. So yes, it
He’s big, but he’s still just a normal human as far as Steve can tell. He’s squaring off against Iron Man, undaunted and reaching for his gun. Typical HYDRA commitment.
He can ditch the vest the second they land, and Steve can’t protest once they’re there. No, they’ll be stuck by then, for the next few days.
“Vodka? Before lunch? I underestimated you,” Tony ignores America’s boy scout and walks over. “Maybe we could get along after all.”
“S’okay,” when Steve smiles, the collar pushes his cheeks up into his eyes. It’s adorable. “Tony, s’okay.”
They walk all the way to the end of the hallway, and by that time Steve’s stable enough to limp along without any support. Tony still stays close, their shoulders pressed together as they make their way all the way back to the room. Steve’s a bit pale and sweaty, but he looks too happy to care.
beyond his expertise. Tony does sit back now, stricken with guilt and terror. Steve’s neck might very well be broken. Maybe his spine is damaged in other places, too. It’s hard to tell.
“Wait,” Steve looks over at the pilot’s seat. He lifts a hand to block the EMT as she tries to dab some blood off his face and strap a brace around his neck. The other is wrapping a blanket around his legs and preparing to strap him in.
Happy helps Steve fold some clothes and personal belongings into a suitcase. It doesn’t take more than fifteen minutes to collect everything. Tony stands by the bookshelf in the living room and picks up the photo there. It’s black and white, and a little yellowed within the frame. It’s of Steve, and a group of people he knows are the Howling Commandos. Howard told him about them, but mostly about Captain America.
No, now’s not the time. Tony furrows his brow. He wishes he knew what’s wrong. Steve looks so young all of a sudden, sprawled and vulnerable. Both of them are pretty scraped up. Just as he was supposed to, Steve played Tony’s body guard without hesitation. Tony comes closer, takes Steve’s face between his hands without really thinking. The skin is smooth and soft, lily white and without a single blemish. Perfect, angelic. Without his stern frown, Steve looks... peaceful. Like he’s sleeping so deeply that nothing can touch him.
So Steve drinks it, tips the alcohol into his mouth without missing a beat, and sets down the empty glass. “Time to go.”
“Not entirely,” the director responds. “No-one else could have made quicker, neater work of it. I knew you wouldn’t leave all your toys behind even if I ordered you to, though I didn’t expect you to be brash enough to bring Iron Man.”
There are bits or Iron Man littered around them, as well as plenty of broken twigs and branches. Tony plucks some pine needles from his hair and ruffles it, checking his throbbing head for blood. There is none. Right, of course, Rogers had his hand wrapped around it. Wincing, Tony gets to his knees. Steve lies beside him in the dirt, completely relaxed, a little pale.
Steve sighs. “Yeah.” He can’t deny that. But this is all he can do to hold himself together, the only thing he has. Getting up and working for SHIELD is all he can do, and they expect Captain America, the straight-laced soldier, the man with a plan. Sure, he’s broken Fury’s rules; Steve’s by no-means a goody-two-shoes. Anything but. He’ll do what he thinks is right before what’s allowed. Always has. Maybe Tony doesn’t know he’s forged medical records and disobeyed orders by his superiors plenty of times. That was back in the war though, seventy years ago. The world feels so grey now, despite the constant bombardment of color and light from all directions. His eyes can see all of it now too, with more detail than any other human on Earth. But Brooklyn in the nineteen-thirties was still brighter and warmer to him, full of richer hues despite his eyes being so colorblind.
It’s horrendously boring. Tony really wishes he could have a drink right now. He wishes Steve wouldn’t sit so tightly upright in his chair, memorizing every detail perfectly like he always does, with his perfect hair, and his perfect face.
A flash of blue darts by the window. Steve pushes himself off the stretcher to get a better look, and he knows
“Then do it,” Steve agree. “We’ll do what we can on the ground. I’ll take the back entrance, you guard the front, and we’ll try to keep them from bringing out any more missiles.”
But the inventor recovers fast, and brushes it off. “Look, if we do end up in a firefight, wouldn’t you rather have some protection? You don’t have your shield, but you’re clearly here to be mine. Hate to break it to ya Spangles, but Fury only wants you for your body. Or, SHIELD does at least.” He puts up his hands.
Tony doesn’t seem to mind, carrying on. “Reverted to the state. But what do I know. Maybe you sold them your soul already and you don’t have a choice.”
The Big Apple is right ahead. Already he can spot the shape of Avengers’ Tower as he weaves through the sky. He’s not an Avenger anymore; the team disbanded, separating those deadly chemicals Banner had described them as. It was probably for the better. Even with catastrophic events to bring them together and forge friendships, things had been bound to go off at some point. Fury must have known that, regardless of his vision to have them unite in the first place. He’s a smart guy, that Tony is sure of.
The ramp lowers, and Steve hops out, angling his body swiftly. The drop is short, and in seconds he’s plunging into the water. Another few heartbeats, and there’s a second splash. Steve swears he hears a third, but he can’t be sure.
To his surprise, there’s a gun in here, and extra magazines. Tony hesitantly pulls the weapon from the bag and straps it to his waist. It’s reassuring to know SHIELD doesn’t expect him to go unarmed (though he suspects ‘arming’ him is meant to mostly mean pairing him with Steve), but he hopes this mission doesn’t end in a firefight.
“Naw, too late, I did it. Cracked the hard shell, and look what’s underneath. One big blonde marshmallow moron.” Tony smacks his bicep. “Come on cupcake, what’s the plan?” He’s grinning too.
annoying, Steve can’t change anyone but himself. This mission will only get easier if he takes a look inside and does what he can from his end. “I’m just... I kinda miss my shield.” That’s the truth, and it’s all he can manage to put to words right now. Tony didn’t ask for a profile of his mental health, and he’s not the type to indulge so deeply either.
“You brought Iron Man.” Steve can’t believe it. The chip is one thing, something he actually agrees is a good idea and will make breaking in a lot daintier, and a lot faster. But Iron Man? A whole suit of armor capable of launching rockets and small missiles? Something the government has tried to take ownership of for being too dangerous? Something that’s so shiny and colorful and recognizable?
That’s no surprise. HYDRA had brutal training methods back in the forties, and they surely do now. Steve raises his hands and shoots down the trio of soldiers trying to load up the missile they’ve brought to take down the SHIELD jets. Steve wraps his gauntleted fingers around the shaft and throws it with the combined strength of his serum and the suit. Then he fires a shot and detonates it safely in mid-air.
Tony looks like he has more words, but he holds them back. They sit in silence for a few more moments before Steve finally asks. Well, it’s more of a demand than a question.
“It’d be great if you could get up now,” Tony murmurs. He run his hands down Steve’s legs, and to his relief nothing feels out of place. The image of Steve zipped up in that ridiculously painted, ridiculously
The HYDRA agent is already moving, and both shots miss. His sweeping leg goes straight for Iron Man’s ankle. JARVIS reacts for him, thrusting Steve into the air by his boots. The soldier flies up and over his attacker’s head, in a sort of powered front-flip. With the suit’s help, he turns in the air and lands to face his opponent. Kneeled, Steve raises his hand to fire another shot. The large man manages to anticipate it, diving to the side and thrusting his foot up into Iron Man’s face. The heel strikes his chin, and Steve cries out as his head is smacked backwards. The guard smirks, not a hint of humanity in his eyes.
Steve unwraps his burger. His hands are still a bit shaky, and sometimes his body stalls and jerks. It does that now, fingers clumsily pushing at the paper. “Wanted to come hang out with you. If that’s okay... unless you’re busy. I won’t get in the way, I promise.”
“Pff, excuses,” Tony smirks. “I expect an improvement of at least fifty percent when you get that off.”
wake up, and though Tony dreads facing the scorn of Captain America, he’s relieved that his companion is breathing more-or-less normally. He doesn’t need Captain America’s death on his conscience.
If he had JARVIS, he’d ramble to him, but he doesn’t. So Tony rambles to himself. “You’ll sleep this off, right Cap?” Tony takes what he needs from one bag and pushes it under Steve’s legs. He takes out a pillow and inflates it with a couple of puffs. “Yup, that serum of yours will fix you right up, and you’ll be fine. You’ll be back to annoying the hell out of me in no time. We can get this god-forsaken mission over with, and you can stomp right back to Fury. He’ll probably set Romanoff on me, unless of course you want the honors. I’d let you sock me in the face for this. Honestly, you deserve it.” He cradles Steve’s head and pushes the pillow under it. Then he darts outside and grabs a couple of rocks. They go under each side of the pillow, wedged firmly against the soldier’s ears. He hopes that will be fine until the serum fixes this.
Steve must have led with his shoulders, because Tony realizes that the right one looks wonky. It’s dislocated, but at least the soldier isn’t awake to suffer or cry out while the engineer prepares to set it. “Okay, Steve, maybe just... keep napping for a bit,” Tony takes off the Kevlar vest. He sets the item aside and takes the arm by the elbow, carefully rotating it.
" Steve insists even more firmly. “We can’t risk it. If we do this right, they won’t see your face or ever find out you were involved. My face isn’t so recognizable , so if we get caught I’ll find some way to get you out of here. There’ll be no need for Iron Man.” Steve could last through whatever fate would befall him if he were caught, and Tony could get help. There would be no need to expose the well-known inventor, nor SHIELD, nor the Avengers’ involvement.
“Stealing my stuff, are you Cap?” Tony pants from just up ahead, doing whatever he can to avoid the weapons gaining on him regardless of how fast he can fly. “I could use a hand!”
There he is, with his floppy hair and his boyish smile. Physically, he hasn’t aged a day, but his eyes tell the story of decades’ worth of suffering. He’s lost everything so suddenly, and is struggling to fill in the gaps left over. Tony sets down the picture. It makes a lot more sense now why Steve has been so brisk with him in the past. And Tony’s probably not been too sensitive either.
“My data shows the fight is swaying significantly in our favor,” JARVIS explains as Steve makes sure this area is clear, and all his nearby allies are safe. “Perhaps I may return you to the helicopter.”
It’s hard to confirm just by feeling along the vertebrae, but what he’s discovering isn’t promising. His heart is in his throat, and it’s lurched to a stop.
“Wow, you really are off your tits, aren’t you,” Tony smiles and pulls the chair as close as he can get it. “Nice threads. Though your accessorizing needs some work. Those wrists are too pretty not to be covered in jewelry. You’ve got yourself three weeks off. I think we need to go shopping and get you a Rolex.”
It feels like forever since he’s been down in his workshop. Tony walks down the stairs on jelly legs, feeling strangely giddy. It’s been ages since he’s had a house guest, but it’s never made him feel quite as victorious as this. It feels... satisfying.
“Don’t know if you noticed, or if that information was on your blind side while you were reading my file, but I’m not a spy, or a trained mercenary, or even a soldier,” Tony explains, though somehow he doesn’t think he can talk his way out of this one.
“At least let me have my drink,” Tony reaches his fingers for the glass he’s already poured, desperate for something to take the edge off if he has to spend the next however-long with Captain Scowl-Face.
Tony can’t bear his own thoughts as he trudges through the rain gathering Iron Man out of mud and grass. It’s cold, and his fingers are freezing. At least most of him is dry though, thanks to the coveralls. He shivers and pulls the last piece out of a bush, dropping it down the cliff. Some of the pieces fell with them, but some have landed up here. He tries not to look down. It’s a very long way, and he can’t imagine what would have become of his body had he not had Steve to protect him.
The ground sharply leans upward, and they’ve reached a cliff. Steve looks up through the thick foliage, and he can’t see the top. He peers down at his feet, and the ground is a bit rougher, the dirt littered with rocks and pebbles.
“It’s too dangerous to send you two in with your usual uniforms,” Fury is explaining. “We’ll get both of you something stealthier.”
They’ve fallen, and it’s his fault. Steve took the brunt of it, too. How many feet did they crash? Tony swallows, sobering. “Rogers,” he tries again, reaching under Steve’s jaw for a pulse.
Nothing can beat human instincts, but Steve has to admit there’s something to be said for mechanical assistance. Regardless of the fact that Iron Man is the only thing enabling him to walk, it’s protecting his soft human skin against bullets. Those modified weapons will still do damage if they hit, but even then he’d probably be alright. The suit would take the beating, saving his soft tissues from having to endure that sort of trauma. Captain America can’t be stopped and will always get back up, not matter what befalls him, but it’s nice to have some protection this time.
Steve looks around and spots a group of SHIELD agents struggling against one HYDRA soldier with a long-range precision rifle stationed on the roof of the complex. Steve frowns and lifts his hand, firing off a shot. With computer-aided aiming, it hits, and the enemy crumples. A second shot blows up his gun in a bright ball of orange flame glinting iridescent.
Steve is already dressed, his huge frame packed into an identical outfit. The curves of his arms are on full display, barely contained in the short sleeves of his shirt. Without his uniform and shield, he looks less gimmicky. Scarier. There’s no star, not red white and blue (though SHIELD had skimped on those first two), and no shield. He’s armed too, and probably a lot more than Tony is.
Both of them help the soldier off the bed and onto his feet. He’s wincing, but his legs are holding him. He takes a couple of shaky steps, quickly settling into the rhythm after that. The nurse leaves them to it.
Steve eats his breakfast, then makes sure their shelter is properly hidden. He tucks the supplies they’ll need for recon into his vest, and Tony does the same. He takes his little screw drivers despite proclaiming so heartily that he won’t need them. A few minutes later, and they’re walking off in search of a way around the cliff. Climbing is out of the question, though Steve knows he could climb up without any problem. He just doesn’t like the idea of having Tony clung to his back and yammering in his ear the whole way up.
Steve scowls at him, but it has no real scorn in it. “No. I don’t. Natasha made me get rid of them.”
“Entering drop zone,” the pilot announces, and Steve does a double-check of his gear. All set. He glances to Tony, but another agent is already making sure the inventor is ready.
Steve doesn’t budge, business as usual. He seems very guarded, more-so even than when they’d first met. The scepter had inseminated all of them with a certain amount of hostility, helping them judge and jump to conclusions and ultimately make a Hell of a mess (correction:
They end up sprawled on the couch. Tony helps Steve lie flatter, pushing the throw pillows under him and leaning over his face. Finally, he finds his voice, but he can’t think of anything meaningful to say. “Wow, you are one terrible kisser, Rogers.”
Steve’s apartment is strikingly empty. There are a few pictures put up, but the whole place is sickeningly organized. It looks more like a museum than an actually place someone lives in.
“Good to be back on your feet, huh,” Tony smiles proudly. He’s glad this process won’t be any longer or more complicated. The serum has done its job perfectly. “You want a hand getting dressed?”
“Or Romanoff, or any number of my agents,” Fury agrees calmly. “But I didn’t send them. I sent you.”
He has to say it now. Queen’s ‘Somebody to Love’ is playing in the background. Steve’s listening patiently, watching expectantly. That blush has crept back up through the triangle of chest visible between his shirt and brace, crawling all the way up to his face. There’s confusion in his expression, but he doesn’t pull away.
They eat and talk. Tony shows him the holographic designs, explains the process of building something from scratch, lays out his ideas, and shows off just what he’s capable of. He’s never felt so out of control as he does now, watching 3D models drawn in blue reflecting in Steve’s big eyes full of insatiable wonder. Tony gets it all to himself, gets to impress Steve while simultaneously basking in the Captain’s enamored gaze. Even flying above everything in Iron Man, he could never feel as high as he does now. He’s on top of the world.
To his surprise, some of the tension has bled away. It’s kind of miraculous, and Steve can’t fathom how it happened. Even the serum can’t help him piece that one together, why Tony’s blunt accusations have made him feel relaxed.
There had been some swift and sure bonding after fighting off a world invasion, no doubt about that. Steve hadn’t felt so alive in a long time, gathered around a table eating shawarma with a group of people just as lost and different as him. But they’d all gone their separate ways immediately after, and that had been the end of that. A hint of friendship, a glimpse at a new family he could have made, with people carrying baggage just like him. The only people who came close to being able to relate to him. He hadn’t felt so alone, for just a day.
Then, the night is still. A few minutes later, Tony is breathing deeply, snoring a little. Steve sighs and releases the tension in his shoulders, wrapping the blanket around himself. He gets comfortable, but not too much so, and finds that place inside him the serum allows him to reach, where his body can remain completely still and his senses are locked on the environment. He’ll sit here until sunrise, and nothing will escape his eyes or his ears. They’ll be safe.
“Can’t help it,” Steve taps his collar. “This thing’s in the way.” He can’t quite open his mouth all the way, or tip his head to go with the flow, that’s for sure.
If Steve can literally take a fall for Tony, then Tony can do this. He can put aside his fears and do what needs to be done.
The suit walks him over a step, firmly planting him between the enemy and the SHIELD agents who have so far been struggling to hold their own against their huge opponent. “Help him,” Steve points at their fallen companion, and the other two rush over to drag their friend to safety. The HYDRA soldier rises to his feet and brushes himself off.
His neck doesn’t look right. There’s a rivulet of blood across his throat that must have dribbled while he was laid across Tony’s back. Tony searches with careful fingers around the back, finds another scrape there. The skin he touches is warm and swollen.
He gathers up Iron Man in a couple of armfuls, and finally the whole thing is sitting in a pathetic pile out of the rain. Tony abandons it and sits by Steve, wrapping himself in a blanket. He pulls his arms out of the sleeves of his coveralls and tucks his hands under his armpits, trying to coax some warmth back into them. Steve looks the same, a little pale but breathing at a steady rate. He’s not moved at all.
“JARVIS, suit me up,” Steve rolls off the stretcher. It’s not too far off the ground, but the impact on his fractured spine and sore ribs hurts enough that he has to grit his teeth to restrain a whine.
The suit is reluctant to respond, and even more so to obey. But it flies at him eventually, the parts whizzing around the room and smacking into his body fast enough to knock him over. Before he can open his mouth to give the command to slow this show down, the arrival of the breastplate smacks the wind and words from his chest. JARVIS intercepts, but not before a couple more pieces fly into Tony.
“Tony. What did you bring.” He uses his Captain’s voice, and it’s very effective. Always has been, since the moment he realized he had it. It’s worked on generals, Nazis, friends, and it’ll work on one flippant genius billionaire.
“JARVIS! Just do it!” He interrupts them all. Tony told the AI to obey his orders. Steve struggles to pull his shoulders off the floor with arm strength alone. The weight is nothing, but it’s painful as he climbs his damages body up the bench along the side. The EMTs are dashing around to stop him. They’re too late. Steve’s already dragged open the door and it throwing himself into open sky. He more tumbles out than lunges, but he manages to turn so he’s falling face-down, arms spread.
“I am merely following Mr. Stark’s direction,” the AI replies, taking control and flying the suit back to the chopper.
“Means I can do this, then,” Steve grabs the inventor by the arm and pulls him down, kissing his lips.
His arm is slow to respond, moving in one jerking motion. The shot misses. The guard is spitting out some blood and diving sideways for a fallen weapon. He swings it around, and starts shooting.
