Why is it appealing? Should it be appealing? Perhaps not. Sounds a touch
Sherlock turns towards the ceiling and closes his eyes, conjuring the most erotic memory he has: his first sexual encounter with John. John backing him rather forcefully into the wall, rising onto his toes to reach Sherlock’s mouth, his lips tasting of whiskey, his hands roaming greedily under Sherlock’s shirt.
Yes, Sherlock decided, as John reached for the remote and unmuted the television. He supposed he could be good for now.
He wondered how long Sherlock had been reading, and whether John really wanted to know.
He peered towards the doorway and the corridor beyond. He didn’t know what he expected. Shadows? Movement? Mary’s bloody corpse to rise from the dark like some sort of horror film?
When he was close enough, John bent over, one hand cupping the back of Sherlock’s head, and pressed an exaggerated, almost comical, kiss to the top of Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock jerked away, stunned, and found John smirking triumphantly.
“Course. And I’ll sign it ‘Your loving nephew, John.’”
Eventually, he’d grow comfortable again at Baker Street. Sherlock needed only be patient.
“But next time,” said Sherlock and then shrivelled up, ashamed at his own presumption. Hadn’t he watched John go through a whole string of sexual partners in the years before Mary? Perhaps he was eager to return to that lifestyle. Perhaps this had just been an experiment, a quick shag with a man before he went back to the gender he preferred. “Assuming you’re amenable to a next time, of course.”
“It’s not lagging for me... oh. Actually, maybe it is a bit. Fuck, that was a lot of health. Bloody grenades. Coming back down now.”
“Thank you, Daddy,” he said breathily. “You take such good care of me.”
<JohnHWatson> I did! But there were enemies popping up then and I spent most of my time fighting them off.
“How is it obvious?” said Sherlock. The question was garbled considerably by his half-chewed food, but not enough that it was incomprehensible.
“Your inbox is bursting,” he tells Sherlock one morning as he’s preparing to leave to do the week’s shopping. “If you could at least skim through your emails before it gets too out of control….”
“It doesn’t
, Sherlock thought,
He realised a second too late that Sherlock wasn’t who he should’ve been thanking, but Sherlock accepted it with a smile anyway.
So like John Watson. Whether a standoff with a wanted criminal or a sulk on the floor, he would see to it that Sherlock was not alone.
John,
John didn’t even stop to think about what he was about to do. He simply lowered the tentacle to Sherlock’s mouth and brushed the tip over his lips, which parted immediately so John could slip the first inch or so inside.
“You don’t have to get defensive. I was teasing, not complaining. I’ve actually found I sort of like it when you get all tetchy and commanding.”
John didn’t answer, of course, although he did reach through the bars again to paw at her sleeve. His tail was bobbing gently against the cage floor, and very, very quietly Mrs Hudson heard him begin to purr.
He’d done too much, already, by coming here.
Molly laughed lightly. “What’s the point? No matter where we try to hide them, he always susses them out. Besides, there are so few things he likes.”
“You have no fucking clue, do you,” says John. His voice is muffled considerably by Sherlock’s shirt and skin, but still understandable. “You let me think you were dead for two years. You didn’t understand at all why I might be a smidge upset when you came back as though nothing had happened. You’ve drugged me. You’ve drugged
“Hey.”
John smelt of garlic and basil. Not the most familiar and John-ish of scents, perhaps, but Sherlock didn’t much care. Especially when John’s short yet strong arms tightened, his palms resting in the centre of Sherlock’s back like the stand of a picture frame, holding him stable.
Sherlock’s adoration is practically a physical presence in his body, a sort of parasite in search of an acceptable environment to colonise. In the years he has known John, his lungs have been affected, his stomach, his vocal folds, his brain, and of course his heart, which is affected now as he watches John wrinkle his nose and snuffle and turn his face into Sherlock’s pillow. Sherlock’s chest feels tight, his heart aching under the increased pressure.
“Oh! Dr Watson.”
He didn’t bother with finesse or technique. He swallowed John’s prick as deep down his throat as it would go and sucked until the faintly salty aftertaste of piss flooded his taste buds, until John was gasping like he was dying and gripping Sherlock’s hair like a lifeline, until John’s cock had hardened so much that Sherlock’s jaw ached and his throat was so full it felt like it would burst.
That’s not what I was trying to do. And you were pretty bloody ‘hurtful’ too you know.
“Don’t,” Sherlock said, “move.” His teeth were gritted, his voice pitched lower than normal.
“Sorry, that was a bit rubbish.” Lestrade scratched the back of his head, looking sheepish. “S’not really my best area, I’m afraid.”
“Oh yeah. Maybe a bloated corpse face too, since I know you like that sort of thing.”
Sherlock snorts—in amusement, he’s not so un-Sherlock-like as a wolf that John doesn’t know precisely what that sound means—and then backs away. John hears his massive paws padding across the carpet and turns his head to see Sherlock buggering off towards the sofa, then leaping on top of it and curling up in a way that’s more catlike than wolf.
, he thought. Maybe Sherlock would wake up with him. Kiss his shoulder, nuzzle his hair.
Sherlock must seem especially lonely without John today, he supposes. “‘Worked everything out’?”
It feels momentous. Like a bomb has dropped, whiting out everything in its path and leaving a faint buzzing in Sherlock’s ears, like that of a single bee in a silent room.
“Oh, Sherlock,” Mycroft sighs. “I warned you, didn’t I? You’ve only yourself to blame, you know.”
She knelt gingerly to the floor and began to gather up the pages. It was so absurd, a kind woman of her age cleaning up after Sherlock, that John couldn’t stand to watch. He knelt quickly beside her and gathered a stack of sheets himself, saying “No, you shouldn’t have to do that. Here, I’ve got it.”
“Serial killer. You’ll
Fact: John’s relationship with Mary did not fit his definition of a healthy relationship, likely because Mary: 1) lied to him about her identity, 2) nearly murdered his best friend in order to continue lying to him, and 3) purposely withheld crucial information about her past even after supposedly coming clean.
,” he says, sitting at the kitchen table whilst John hovers and frets as though Sherlock is in danger of dying from a few bruises and love bites.
“He also seems to be missing his testicles.”
John wasn’t even sure about that. “Interesting” could mean a lot of things John wasn’t keen on. He let a sigh communicate his disagreement.
John said nothing for a moment, just shuffled his feet and folded the milk carton closed. But Sherlock could see that he was thinking, and waited. Eventually, John said, “Honestly? Probably your brain.”
<JohnHWatson> Um. Dunno. You said there are no baddies right? What’s our objective then?
Sherlock paused, peering at John as though he were a curious little specimen that had begun behaving oddly. “She invited me to have coffee. I thought she might prefer to see for herself that my interests lie elsewhere. I thought that was kinder than telling her outright that I’m not attracted to her.”
“Not now you don’t,” says John, following him and laying a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder to keep him seated. “I need to clean and bandage your cuts, then you need to eat some biscuits and drink something.”
The sun was up now, and the traffic heavier. John watched two women walking a German shepherd a short distance away, holding hands and laughing. It made him think of Harry and Clara, still muddling through their divorce. Both of them miserable and heartbroken, even Harry who had been the one to leave.
did he love a man who was up-front about his interest. It was absurd, how many of his buttons Sherlock was pushing seemingly without even realising it.
, much less a boyfriend. So who are you?”
Instead, John sounds amused when he answers, “I told you: I’m warming you up. Have you ever been spanked before?”
Reassured and resolute, Sherlock went.
“Well, it
I’ve been using your walkthrough on GameFAQs to play Caranguard. I’m not really much for video games, Caranguard is my first actually, and your guide has been a HUGE help! Very descriptive and thorough and easy to understand without giving away any of the plot! So thank you very much for writing it!
Well. That was how it
He played with the toys that Sherlock had turned up his nose at, and he slept in the cat bed she had spent a fortune on. He would come when she called, and climb into her lap when she patted it, and lie on her bed and warm her feet at night. A generally sweet, well-behaved cat.
By the looks, Sherlock had bought every blood bag in the clinic, certainly more than twice what he usually bought. The cooler he’d used to transport it all was full to the brim, and he was stuffing them one by one into every available empty space in the fridge.
The emptiness this time when John removed his fingers was worse because Sherlock could
John didn’t hesitate to comply, dressing quickly in one of the coveralls as well as a pair of white cotton shoe coverings. Sherlock, however, only slipped on a pair of latex gloves—to John’s considerable confusion. “You’re not wearing anything else?”
Sherlock took a thin sliver of skin at the centre of the burst between her teeth and bit down. She kept the pressure light, more of a nip than a proper bite. When she let go and drew back, there was a white oval-shaped outline in John’s tanned skin that faded in seconds.
His name was Sholto by the way
“Erm. Hi,” John said, as the man set the plate down in front of him. “Do you know Sherlock Holmes very well? The bloke who keeps leaving things for me.”
If you were trying to protect yourself it might’ve done.
Even if he did have to request assistance.
don’t mind if your dinner’s been mashed up against some dead bloke’s bits for a week, but I’d rather they were kept as separate as possible, thanks.”
“Yeah, right,” John says. “I’m a fucking disaster.”
wrong with it,” John was saying. His expression had gone stony, forbidding. “And anyway, it’s none of your business what I do in my bed.”
“I… Okay. Are you actually going to the loo, or shall I bring you a glass?”
You did. I managed to kick you a bit when I was untangling myself and you didn’t even twitch.
“Oh,” John said, a little helpless whine in her voice. Her toes curled.
<JohnHWatson> No, I mean, you CAN solve cases over email? Without even seeing or talking to anyone? In less than a minute?
“There,” Sherlock said, sounding deeply pleased. “A day or two more of this, and you’ll adjust.”
A jolt of sentiment, as potent as an electric current. His limbs jerked and shuddered; his mind went white. He blinked and he was on the floor, his bum smarting, his left wrist clutched tightly in his right hand. The ring still glinted beautifully on his finger despite the poor fit.
“You used it all? When? And doing what?”
Sherlock pays little attention to what follows, as he’s seen it enough times already. Rosie will examine one toy at a time, lifting each to her face and peering at it, shaking it, tasting it, and then she will set it back in its place and pick up the next in the line.
“Bursting” is a considerable exaggeration. Sherlock has barely 100 unopened emails, rendering his inbox nowhere near full. It’ll scarcely take a half hour to sift through them, identify and dispose of the rubbish, and arrange the remaining ones in order of his level of interest.
“Yes,” John gasped. Even after testing it with his fingers, feeling how pliable the material was, he’d expected the sleeve’s grip to be unforgiving, wringing his cock mercilessly, but it wasn’t like that at all. It moulded to him like a damp sheet.
“Imagine if someday I dragged you round the room by your hair,” John says. “You’d probably come in your pants.”
John wondered what had given it away, but decided he didn’t really care enough to ask. “Yeah. He popped by after my therapy appointment and drove me home. We had a chat. Bit of a tosser, your brother.”
Of course he is. John’s arousal is evident in not only his smell but his eyes, his breathing, his temperature, and of course the hard cock tenting his trousers, pressing into Sherlock’s stomach.
Although he was, according to John, “in rare form” these days.
It had to stop. Should’ve been stopped before, really. John had been an idiot to have put it off so long.
She doesn’t understand. Of course she doesn’t; Sherlock only barely understands, so why should he expect anyone else to? He’s struck with the urge to tug at his hair in frustration, but reins it in. Sucks in a deep breath and prepares to elucidate.
“You should’ve worn the collar.”
It wasn’t the first time that it had happened, or even the second or third. Men sometimes suspected John was transgender, as if that were an unthinkably awful thing to be—or they worried that, god forbid, they might be seen as queer if they dated someone called John. It weeded out the insecure and prejudiced arseholes before John got too attached, at least, but there was always at least a twinge of dismay.
“That’s because you’re an idiot.”
John stayed like that, relishing the sensation: the slow-growing warmth of arousal in her body, the beginnings of an insistent ache between her legs.
and couldn’t manage on your own.”
Sherlock gave up his lighthearted fighting and sagged against John, sighing happily. John would ask him soon. He needed only be patient.
It would destroy Sherlock if the same happened while John was romantically involved with him. Discovering John in bed with someone else would hurt less.
The most brutal of the bite marks—most of which were flushed a dusky pink—was the one on John’s nape. Which, Sherlock saw now, actually did partly overlap the faded one, albeit only slightly, like a pair of joined rings. The entire area was swollen and bluish, although the outline of Sherlock’s teeth was darker, almost burgundy, and startlingly clear.
John, seated in front of his computer reading about the 18-year-old boy who’d killed himself in a sports centre the night before (same method as Sir Jeffrey, apparently—odd, that), glanced towards the door, to the left of which his shoes were sat side by side against the wall.
Sherlock never thought he could have this: John in his bed, drowsing contentedly only inches away, as though there’s never been any question that he belongs here.
John chuckles, playfully cruel, and drags his fist down the length of Sherlock’s cock, pulling the foreskin until it covers the sensitive head and makes Sherlock moan and ache.
You’re full of shit too you know. You don’t try to avoid getting involved at all costs.
“Go on, then. I’ve got this well enough in hand.” He nods towards Rosie, who is still suckling happily.
John wrinkled his nose but didn’t seem otherwise fazed at the sight of a yellow-gold band on Sherlock’s finger. “What’s wrong with yellow gold?”
No, Sherlock really can’t. He is, after all, far worse than an adrenaline junkie with a short fuse. He is a very literal junkie, not even a fortnight sober, and he is full of himself, cocky, and overconfident with a history of getting the people around him killed. Hs is, in short, precisely the sort of person who shouldn’t be helping to raise a child. In fact, according to John himself, he is the last person John wants assistance from at all.
Besides, Sherlock was being more puppy-like than kitten-like now: half in John’s lap and licking his cheek, his chin, his jaw, even his throat, which made John’s breath catch and his fingers twitch. But if John wanted to see him as a cat tonight, then Sherlock supposed he would be a cat.
John remained where he was, although he did give another nuzzle, a bit lower this time: nudging one of the buttons on Sherlock’s shirt with his nose. On a whim, he closed his teeth around it, being sure not to catch his fangs (which were peeking only slightly out from his gums) on the fabric, and tugged gently.
, he thought with a grimace.
, John thought.
She was getting turned-on, John realised.
Meanwhile, John carries on, expression twisted with anguish. “I wanted to be. God knows I wanted to be. But I was… pretending. Acting like I had any idea how to have a happy fucking marriage.” He sucks in a breath through his mouth, baring his teeth, and for a moment Sherlock thinks he’s going to stand for a proper rage. But he doesn’t. He only bends forward slightly, so tense that he’s shaking. “Christ, what a failure. I was miserable. Do you know that? Fucking hell. You were the only fucking person I was happy with.”
<ScienceOfDeduction got blown up.>
Yeah, so? I think you’re exciting and unusual and interesting as hell. That’s not you being useful, that’s me being attracted to you.
And, as though she needed to illustrate, she straightened up again and tugged on her lapels so her coat billowed open and then fell, draping over John’s body as well as her own. She slotted a hand between John’s thighs, cupping John’s vulva through her trousers. The tip of her middle finger pressed at the seam right where John’s cunt was, and with an involuntary “uhn,” John spread her legs wider and rocked into the teasing touch.
That made John chuckle. From the three brief messages he’d received from SH, not to mention his charming profile, “rude” and “off-putting” seemed bang on.
11:56 p.m.
17 May, 8:40 p.m.
He still experiences nocturnal penile tumescence, of course, and very rarely he is moved to masturbate, but for over a decade, the rest of it has held no allure for him whatsoever.
There was a short silence, during which the lift arrived and John stepped inside. When Sherlock spoke, he sounded so offended, positively scandalised, that John nearly giggled. “Of course I’m not
It was a comforting thought, that by slithering around on John’s floor Sherlock might figure it out. Solve and fix John’s dilemma as though it were any other case. Afterwards, they could get chips and laugh about it. John could broach the subject of moving back to Baker Street without fearing he would bring anything unnatural with him.
“Didn’t think to bring my kit with me. Stupidly.” Sherlock flipped it over and poked at the battery compartment, then set it back down.
5:55 a.m.
“How did you manage to text me a photo from—”
Speechless—Sherlock was speechless, past the point of verbalising thoughts. Perhaps even past the point of thinking coherently. John couldn’t remember Sherlock ever being in such a state before, which was… satisfying. Very, very satisfying.
John, tying his shoes on the sofa, wasn’t deterred. “Not that I’m complaining, mind. I’m fully in favour of you getting more sleep.”
“Not now,” he said sternly. “Right now, I want to watch the end of this programme, and I want you to lie still and let me. Can you do that? I know you’re bored and tetchy today, but can you be a good little kitty for me right now?”
Again with the presumption that John would agree, although John’s indignation was fading quickly now. Overshadowed by his mounting curiosity. Questions fluttered about his mind like moths: ‘Why? Why me? What are you investigating now?’
But he couldn’t, obviously. John might notice, would know immediately that Sherlock had been poking about and found it. The flat would swell with the thick cloud of awkwardness and things left unsaid. Their relationship would suffer.
audible even over the sounds of their panting groans.
But Sherlock only shushed her. “It’s fine, John. Whatever you need. Make yourself come.”
The look that Sherlock shot him said quite clearly, ‘Stop being an idiot,’ which made John grin. “Learning to kill and extract blood from a living animal is an essential stage of vampire infancy.”
By the end of Sherlock’s list, John is wearing the squinty eyes, small mouth, and creased forehead of the deeply unimpressed. Sherlock supposes he should have anticipated that. After all, humiliation and discipline seem rather commonplace in BDSM relationships, according to his research.
“You manipulative shit,” John said, coming closer. “With your pictures and your collar and that fucking brain of yours.”
As if he’d heard the thought—almost a possibility, as Sherlock had certainly thought it loudly and fervently enough—John shooed Sherlock’s hands away and took a large step back, until he was standing just beside the bed. “Right then. Suppose I should let you have it then, shouldn’t I?”
“Shit!” John leapt back, dripping even more tea onto the floor. “Sorry, I’m so sorry.”
It echoed in John’s mind. Louder than the hum of the shower, the trickle of the water disappearing down the drain, the sound of soap lathering in his hands.
John was panting, his upper body lifted and twisted so he could stare right at Sherlock with an expression of such starry-eyed confusion that Sherlock couldn’t help but grin. “What?”
“Have dinner with me,” John said. The rumble of his vocal cords made Sherlock shiver.
“Mm. Pity.”
marry
Although he can’t explain all of it, of course. The sex, the spanking, the cutting, he can’t imagine she wants to hear any of that—or that she even needs to, in fact, in order to understand.
At Sherlock’s nod, the phone is promptly shoved aside so that John can wind himself around Sherlock, shifting and situating them so that his hand is in Sherlock’s hair and Sherlock’s mouth is open against John’s scar. John’s glorious, perfect scar. Sherlock hums happily against it, marvelling at the taste and texture. If Sherlock has left a mark on John’s mind half as permanent and life-altering as the sniper bullet that left this scar, then he decides he will consider his life well-lived.
So John used her. Swiveled her hips and shifted her position until she’d found the right angle and motion (a slick glide up the middle of Sherlock’s tongue, then closer to the edge on the slide back down, Sherlock’s teeth beneath the tip of it providing a hint of pressure that John lingered on before she started again), and then she shucked her inhibitions and rutted until she was slack-jawed and panting, gripping the headboard like a lifeline. Sherlock’s entire frame quivered slightly, and with every snap of John’s hips, she let out a little “unh, unh” (too soft for John to feel the vibrations of her voice, unfortunately).
Anyway, just thought you’d like to know.
Sherlock’s disappointment was almost tangible. The last bit of rope slipping over the edge of a building, succumbing to gravity. “That’s not a quality, John. That’s an organ.”
John,
“God,” John said. Arousal washed over him, so strong that his cock twitched in his pants and he had to close his eyes while he gathered his wits enough to comply with Sherlock’s suggestion.
“Oh, right,” John said, still chuckling because this SH person was quite possibly the most ridiculous person he’d ever met. “Definitely a stalker, then.”
“Cheers. Things have been all right. Harry’s better, I think. She’s been almost nice lately. And the job’s a bit dull, but it’s bearable.”
“C’mon,” John said. There was a waver in his voice. His face was flushed, his pupils dilated. “Let’s have a chat while we eat.”
It’s a lie, of course. Ella says little about John, and only when Sherlock mentions him. She refuses to even acknowledge that John had been her patient, much less suggest that he become her patient again. But the comment knocks the wind from John’s sails, at least. He stops shaking, and when he speaks, the anger is gone from his tone.
“A lot depends on the circumstances,” John answered, pillowing the phone between his ear and his shoulder while he adjusted the position of his bad leg. “Size of the flame, degree of heat, and all that. But in general, no, not likely. Most cremations take at least two hours, sometimes three.”
that made John’s groin feel even heavier. “I want you to have it. You shouldn’t have to wait for it.”
“That’s why a fake cock’s loads better than a real one.” John grinned. “Stays hard as long as I need it to.”
The moment John was out of sight, Sherlock clambered to his feet and looked around. A sheet? Nude? No—dressing gown! He lunged for the wardrobe, threw open the door, and began to rifle through the contents. The burgundy one contrasted attractively with his skin, the solid blue one was irresistibly soft to the touch, the striped blue one—the striped blue one! Silk and thin, often staticky after it had been laundered. It would cling obscenely. John would be salivating and hauling them both back to bed in no time.
Sherlock turned the photos facedown on the table. Then there was a flurry of paper-flipping. Mostly reports of different kinds, both typed and handwritten.
Sherlock’s mind whirred, thoughts like fan blades spinning round and round. Overdramatic, sincere, what Sherlock wanted.
what I would do to keep you. If it were between killing an innocent bystander and losing you forever, I wouldn’t even hesitate. If I’d been in her place, I’d have shot me too. More than that, I wouldn’t have missed—I’d have made certain the shot was fatal, that
You said before that you weren’t sober when you had sex. I thought you meant alcohol, but you didn’t did you?
It seems your sister has at least one thing in common with my brother. He sneers at me regularly for having such a ‘childish hobby’. I ignore him and would advise you to similarly ignore your sister. It’s neither pathetic nor embarrassing to enjoy something that strengthens several cognitive skills such as spatial navigation and memory, reduces anxiety, and—perhaps most importantly—hurts no one. My brother, and perhaps your sister as well, certainly can’t say the same.
think I’m here?”
There was a bark of laughter behind them, but Sherlock was chanting “Go, go, go” as though it was the only word he knew. So John didn’t try to look back.
“There’s literally no difference in how it’s pronounced, Sherlock. Child, childe, it sounds the same.”
With her free hand, she clicked through pages of realistic and nonrealistic dildos, considered her ideal length and girth, and debated the benefits of texture until Sherlock finally spoke.
, John thought,
He cupped Sherlock’s jaw and trailed his thumbs over those cheekbones. There was a faint cry of ‘You’re really going to do this?’ from a little corner of his mind, but that was easy enough to ignore. Particularly when his awareness of it was swiftly eclipsed by a sharp thrill shivering through his gut.
“I know,” John said kindly, kissing his temple again and tasting the sweat gathered there. “I know, but don’t fight it. Just let it have you.”
The back of John’s neck felt warm. He rubbed at it, licking his lips, and didn’t bother to pretend he wasn’t savouring the mental picture that made. “I might do, yeah. Then I might tell you that you’re
That might’ve been true. It was hard to tell the exact shade in this low lighting. But the colour was similar enough that John suspected it wasn’t a coincidence.
Molly cocks her head and screws up her face in puzzlement. “So that you could discuss it? Maybe try to find some way to compromise? That’s, um… sort of how a relationship works. Communication, and honesty.”
Sherlock cocked her head and took one of John’s inner labia into her mouth, suckling gently, and the concern died in John’s throat. Again, like the nuzzling, the appeal came more from the idea than how it felt. (Cunnilingus had always appealed more to her mentally than physically.) God, she wanted to make a fucking mess of Sherlock. Pull her hair and ride her tongue and get her entire face sopping wet—which obviously went against her intentions to be gentle while Sherlock was tied down.
“Yes. You’ll like her. She’d be willing to give you a special deal if you wanted to move in, I’m sure—”
Sherlock crumpled the napkin and set it aside, then tilted his head to study John. His gaze flitted from one area of John’s face to another, ending somewhere above John’s eyebrows, where it seemed to be trying to bore its way past the skin and skull and all the way into John brain.
“Ohhh yes,” John told him, still petting him sweetly. “You are my good boy, aren’t you? Can you come for me, sweetheart? Can you be my perfect, obedient puppy and make a mess of my leg?”
“Remember when we talked about acceptable reasons to wake me up in the middle of the night?” John slurred, squinting through the darkness to find Sherlock’s form beside him.
“—I’ll die too, apparently. Nice. Hello again.”
With a groan, John leaned forwards so he could nip Sherlock’s shoulder playfully. “Tart.”
He thought quickly. He had what looked to be four black nylon ropes, a proper standing fucking machine, a tentacle dildo, and Sherlock staring up at him in silent supplication—what exactly did John want, and how did he want it?
“Why?” Sherlock said, that softness to his voice again. “Why would Mary be haunting you?”
those, John. Always something to look forward to.”
John’s shoulders slump, making him appear even smaller. Sherlock is reminded vaguely of a centuries-old skeleton crumbling under the lightest touch. He opens his mouth to say anything—something clever, something encouraging—but what comes out is “You’re hardly on your own. You’ve got me.”
And also every bit as devoid of romantic (or sexual) sentiment.
“I… well, yeah, but… I might’ve been overreacting a bit. Twenty quid isn’t so much, really, and I’ve already got—”
“Good. That’s so good, Sherlock. You can keep your head down if you want. As long as you keep this perfect arse up for me.” Then there was a hand on Sherlock’s bottom, a pair of fingers circling his hole. “Oh. You got yourself so wet. Good boy. So well-behaved.”
They’d been sitting for several minutes in silence, John concerned mostly with his food while Sherlock’s eyes were riveted to the view outside the window behind John. He was understandably more focused on 22 Northumberland Street than John’s attempts at small talk and would’ve been perfectly justified, really, in ignoring John’s statement entirely.
She’d been so certain that her own cats would be better behaved.
An unconscious gesture, obviously, and one that he doesn’t follow through on. But Sherlock hardly cares about that, just as he is barely aware of John scooting to the other end of the sofa and lying down on his side, legs bent. Sherlock can only think of John, for a moment, his mind still groggy with sleep, recalling Sherlock’s shoulder on some instinctive level as a comfortable pillow, somewhere he’d been sleeping contentedly only a few minutes ago. Somewhere familiar. Somewhere safe.
John reached for her tea, but Sherlock bypassed her entirely and deposited both mugs on the desk, where neither of them would be able to reach. Then before John could question it, Sherlock was climbing into the chair with John, throwing one leg over John’s knee and another over the chair arm. Her thigh knocked the computer, sending it dangerously close to toppling onto the floor.
So can you buy the DLC things on Steam or.......?
Cheers,
Oh, that was a nice thought. Sherlock licked his lips and arched his spine as though into John’s touch.
He endeavoured to move past it.
“Ah,” John said. “Right. I, erm. Thought that little Italian place just off Marylebone High Street. It’s been there for ages, but we’ve never been. So I thought… I dunno.”
“Oh. Um.” John took it. “Cheers.”
Her tricep flexed, drawing John’s eye to it—to all the muscles in her arms, actually. Her arms and her shoulders and her neck…. Christ, she was gorgeous. All tied down and stretched out for John: a veritable feast. How she’d managed to do it to herself, John couldn’t even imagine, but obviously she had. Clever, gorgeous woman. John wanted to map her entire fucking body with her hands and her mouth, although Sherlock probably wouldn’t enjoy that. Not today, anyway. Maybe someday.
While he waited for the reply, he investigated the inside texture. There were closely packed ridges just past the entrance that loosened into spiralling waves as he delved deeper. The material was surprisingly flexible and adjusted easily as John moved his fingers in wide, slow circles.
A right disaster that was, introducing Sherlock to Mycroft.
“Anyway,” John said. There was the soft chinking of a spoon against the rim of her mug. “Just a thought.”
My landlady and I don’t have a typical relationship. We actually met years ago after her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out by ensuring his execution, which she was thankful for. As a result, our relationship is more personal. She likes to pop up for a chat or to drop off a tray of scones or to fuss over some triviality. The latter happened to be the case the other day when she was being a nuisance. Evidently I’d left something out on the kitchen table that began to rot and smell whilst I was out of town. Mrs Hudson voiced her displeasure at length.
“Seeing as you’re the only ones doing any snogging in this flat,” said Mrs Hudson, “it seemed appropriate.”
“No.” Sherlock nods solemnly, conceding the point. “I suppose not.”
Nothing, it’s just surprising I suppose. I was expecting a murder not a missing dog.
“Abducted by her birth father,” Sherlock says, handing back the photograph. “Who, I suspect, didn’t realise until very recently that he had a child. Hence the abduction. She was probably injected with a strong sedative and then a portion of her blood removed by syringe. The blood isn’t so much spattered as it is dripped strategically, and not even the most violent struggle would be enough to tip a desk of that size entirely over. Apart from the blood loss, he’ll have left her unharmed.”
Molly’s confusion deepens. “Well… yeah. It’s been a bit, erm, obvious, hasn’t it? Since probably a year ago, at least. Sorry, um, was it meant to be a secret? Because it’s fine, you know, really! We none of us mind. The people who care about you, that is.”
She remembered two nights ago, before John’s aborted attempt at reciprocation: John on her hands and knees on the bed, tossing her hair to one side and looking at Sherlock over her shoulder, sticking her bottom in the air and asking for it just like that—moaning into the pillow when Sherlock gave in and fucked her roughly from behind, saying “Please, god, please” when Sherlock kissed the dip in her spine and told her what a pretty whore she was.
On the chance that you’re not keen to be rid of me, do you mind if I ask what a consulting detective is? I’ve never heard of it before. Is it different to being a private detective? And if you can and are comfortable saying anything about the case you’re working on now, I wouldn’t mind hearing a bit about it. :)
As soon as she heard John flip the vibrator off, Sherlock slipped her fingers gently out and brought them to her mouth.
Fucking hell, that was a lovely thought. John began to move again. Thrusting the Fleshlight more vigorously onto his cock—god, he wondered if Sherlock could hear any of the obscene slurping noises his dick made as it pumped in and out, or how his breathing had sped up until he was nearly panting—John allowed himself to indulge. Imagined Sherlock straddling him, pinning his hips in place, riding him hard and fast until John was trembling and arching and aching to come.
“My brother of course hopes to keep up this façade for as long as possible, if not indefinitely, but with the most recent developments in your relationship, I suspect you’d have caught on eventually. Which brings me to my proposal.”
Good. :)
She reined in the desire and did her best to stay still while Sherlock tongued and suckled gently, occasionally switching sides or pausing to nuzzle some more. It was so… indulgent, so tender, so terribly unSherlock. John wondered if something about wearing handcuffs was addling her brain, making her want to take things slowly, making her less bossy and less handsy: more cooperative.
John thought it when he first glimpsed Sherlock in the crowded Indian restaurant, but it wasn’t until he was seated across from him at a tiny two-person table that he finally gave in and asked, “Is your shirt
Determined to give him a taste of the same, John fixed Mycroft with a flinty-eyed stare (the sort that said, ‘Don’t forget that I just killed a man’) and said, perfectly polite, “Looking forward to it. Good night.”
In the end, however, he decides that since John has already shown himself to be in favour of hurting Sherlock or being hurt by Sherlock in a sexual context, he must not find such a thing unhealthy. In fact, John has in the last few days shown numerous indications of having been involved in a BDSM relationship before—
Sherlock nodded, just this side of frantic, and whined pitifully when John stood, dropping the lubricant into Sherlock’s pile of bedding. Sherlock shoved the blankets off him, damn the cold, and had half a mind to crawl after John, begging, while John backed away. It was only the fact that John was licking his lips, looking reluctant, that held him back.
“Want me to dump it for you?” John asked.
Sherlock can’t handle it, somehow. Not now. Not from Molly of all people. He scoffs, although he keeps his voice down so as not to attract John’s attention. “We’re not
John laughed, because fucking hell, wasn’t this meant to be John’s explanation? But as always, Sherlock was right, so John nodded. “And then I get wet.”
And John did trust her. God help her, but she did.
But the sound Sherlock made after he’d sent it, a low hungry moan, made John want to puff up with pride and take another photo, then another, then another, if only Sherlock would make that sound again and again and again.
and he tumbled onto his back with a cry.
I can’t decide if you’re deliberately going against the advice of my guide or if you’ve stopped relying on it at all. Either way, Reichenbach Falls is a notoriously difficult location to complete and, even more so than the Hounds of Baskerville, that quest should be avoided until you’re a higher level. Even at level 65, I found the Spider King (the boss I assume you’re stuck on, although perhaps you haven’t even made it that far) extraordinarily hard to defeat. I died several times before I finally managed it. So my advice is to leave Reichenbach Falls for the moment, find something else to do, and—most importantly—stop running headfirst into quests that you aren’t prepared for yet!
Angelo’s would have been a far better choice, even taking into account the difference in distance from the flat. After all, their first dinner at Angelo’s had marked a beginning, even more exceptional than either of them had imagined. What better place to mark a new chapter? The symmetry would have pleased Sherlock a great deal. That they sat instead in a restaurant utterly devoid of meaning for either of them was—
. Similar to Sherlock’s own, but slightly less pungent and with an aftertaste that was almost sweet, unlike Sherlock’s distinctly salty one.
“Here.” John shook it pointedly. “I don’t want it.”
And you decided it wasn’t important for me to know this before you put your mouth on my dick without a barrier?
.” He opened the box of scampering, squeaking rats and lifted one out. It was grey and white and utterly dwarfed by Sherlock’s hand, rendering its desperate squirming ineffective.
“What do you mean he
Sherlock thinks in despair. He knows that John is loyal, John is faithful, yet at the same time, he can’t help but wonder how long he has before John cuts him loose: lets him float alone and rot and sink like an abandoned ship at sea.
“Do you have anything in mind?” John asks. “Any particular tools or, erm, areas or…?”
In no time at all, his arse is on fire. It’s not the most excruciating pain he’s ever felt, but in that moment it seems the most significant. Like a patch of pavement in the sunlight or a measuring cup left on the burner in the kitchen, he feels scalded, melted. He feels like something that should be left untouched, except that John—perfect, brilliant John—touches him without reserve, as though spanking Sherlock’s arse raw isn’t hurting his hand as much as it’s hurting Sherlock.
It took several attempts with the BlackBerry’s camera to get a decent picture of his own torso that wasn’t blurry, off-centre, or partially obscured by his own arm, but finally he managed. It wasn’t perfect—his outstretched arm was still in the frame, and it was angled more towards his stomach than his chest—but considering he’d simply held the phone out, aimed at himself, and snapped wildly, he thought it was fairly good.
boy.”
“For goodness sake, Sherlock,” comes Mycroft’s voice, “you’re not so naïve you honestly believe the sensation of a cock in your arse could bear any resemblance to what you’re doing to yourself right now.”
Thanks for your honesty. I appreciate it.
Sherlock, seated at the kitchen table with his microscope and several crushed multivitamins, drops his head back with a grin so Mrs Hudson can see the full collection. They’re glorious, he knows: mottled blue and violet and brown. He looks at them often, and spends even more time running his fingers over them, poking at the marks until they ache.
“Hydrochloric,” he finds himself blurting during one such examination, after he’s become lost in his own labyrinthine mind, and his body, as it is unfortunately wont to do, attempts to take control.
Sherlock pacing about, practically manic, and Mrs Hudson claiming multiple times that Sherlock’s taxi had arrived. (“I’ve been with him all night, Mrs Hudson,” John insisted gently. “He didn’t order a taxi.”)
<JohnHWatson left the game.>
One of John’s hands made a gentle pass up Sherlock’s spine to rub between Sherlock’s shoulders. “Kind of you to say. Still, I think—”
By the time that the stream of piss began to slow, Sherlock was wet from his hair to his knees, and the rug beneath him was rapidly growing damp. The leather collar round his neck was soaked. He smelt. Anyone who saw him like this would’ve no doubt wrinkled their nose and thought him repulsive.
John didn’t even have to think about it. “Because she’s angry.”
Then Sherlock swiped his fingers across John’s jaw and brought them, blood-smeared, to John’s lips. “Open.”
“Er.” John blinked, taken aback. This wasn’t exactly how she imagined the encounter would turn out. Although, now that she really thought about it, she wasn’t sure what she had been expecting. In fact, now she wondered why she’d consented to this at all.
We’ve got biscuits, scones, and sandwiches here, I think we’re sorted.
He tries to worm from John’s embrace, and after a moment of hesitation, John allows it although he clearly isn’t happy about it. His hands linger on Sherlock’s shoulders, fingertips trailing over the skin until they have to drop away.
There were blotches in the condensation now, from his forehead, his struggling. He thought he could see white, blonde, a patch of red through the haze, but the image flickered when he blinked.
12:35 p.m.
As far as affection went, Sherlock swung quite erratically between clingy and aloof. Some days he followed her from room to room, darting under her feet, rubbing against her legs, meowing up at her, and being a general nuisance until she sat down and consented to stroke him.
What did Mr Hudson do that got him executed? Also, was that a boring case by your standards? If so I’m sort of curious what you would consider an interesting one, since your life keeps sounding more and more fascinating the longer we know each other.
He and John are met at the edge of the blocked-off car park first by Donovan, who scarcely glances at them as they duck under the police tape. She leads them through the small crowd of officers and underlings milling about.
There’s a silence, and John lifts his head. His eyes are wide but dry, which is good; Sherlock doesn’t know what he would do if John cried—probably crumple like the skeleton he just imagined.
John nearly pitched face-first into the headboard, but managed at the last second to steady himself. “Shit! Sherlock, that’s—oh, fuck!”
John dropped his hand back to the bed, bracing himself, as Sherlock bent over him, kissing his spine and his shoulder blade, murmuring “Are you sure? You don’t—”
John’s hackles shot up at the implication he had gorged himself, but Sherlock talked on before John could manage a word.
to keep you here.”
Sherlock had already scoured the ensuite earlier as part of his full-house investigation. Still, John led him to it again and waved vaguely towards the mirror, but Sherlock didn’t ask for specifics. He set Rosie on the floor, stepped onto the closed toilet lid, which creaked under his weight, and reached until he could prod at the ceiling.
Fucking hell. John felt like he was glowing. “It’s usually the sense of smell that goes first—dead nerve cells in the olfactory bulbs. Then it’ll progress to increasingly severe headaches, nausea, maybe a fever as well. Unfortunately, the man won’t think much of it—it doesn't sound terribly dissimilar from a very bad flu, does it? And of course there’s also the confusion. By that point, he’ll probably start finding it difficult to think clearly. And even if he does catch on that something is really wrong—when the seizures start, for example, or when he starts losing muscle control—it’ll be too late. The infection will have spread to his brain stem, and the parasite eaten all the bits of his brain he needs to breathe.”
The contradiction creates an impasse. Sherlock spends an hour in front of the computer, dozens of tabs open in his internet browser, trying to push past it.
So much so that when John returns to the flat after fixing Mrs Hudson’s slow-draining tub and stops dead just inside the door where Sherlock is waiting for him, Sherlock doesn’t feel concerned or hesitant in the slightest. He grins at John and receives a weak, tentative smile in response.
Sherlock didn’t hesitate to reach for him, to pull him close, although John was still wearing his jacket and shoes. He smelt of antibacterial soap and latex, and he was warm despite the chill outside.
“Good. That’s very good,” said Sherlock. Her voice was husky, deep with desire. “Listen to that. Do you hear how wet you are?”
“You’d be surprised,” said Sherlock, “how ignorant people are of their own motivations. I once investigated—”
If he were to put his mouth on it, his jaw would ache after a matter of seconds, trying to remain open so wide.
). He made it outside on the pavement without incident, although he was still covered in dried come, his trousers were unzipped, and the backs of his shoes were folded down where he’d shoved his heels hastily in.
“Mm. Good night,” said Sherlock, and rung off without another word.
No it’s good. Just different.
Later, after John has come down Sherlock’s throat, John rolls to his side, boneless and drowsy with contentment, and nuzzles senselessly into the pillow while Sherlock curls around his back and measures the space between each of John’s ribs with his fingers.
“Well.” Another glance at John, this one even quicker—and yes, that was definitely a flinch of chagrin on his features. “Perhaps not
Both cats barrelled from the kitchen, John dashing all the way to the bedroom while Sherlock stopped in the living room and spun around. His tail was high, thrashing, and fluffed up to twice its usual size; his ears were perked. He stared into the kitchen before turning his owlishly wide eyes to Mrs Hudson.
“Of course.” Sherlock wills his muscles to relax and is relieved when they acquiesce, falling limp and allowing his skin to mould itself to the tarpaulin. “I’m fine.”
As for Sherlock’s orientation, however… that requires a bit of breaking down facts before he can pin it down.
A corner of John’s mouth quirked up. “Lying shit. Pasta all right for dinner?”
It’s still okay that I’m talking to you yeah? You’re not just waiting for me to piss off already?
If I can see that, then your brother definitely can.
“What, seriously?”
“Hmm.” Hands still in his pockets, Sherlock turned and padded casually out. “John thinks you’re angry at him. Is that true? Because I don’t think it is. I think it’s more complicated.”
Nights were the worst. No matter how many lights he flipped on, there were still shadows in every room, still an energy in the air that reminded him of Afghanistan. The sensation that he was standing at the edge of his life, overlooking the valley of death, but he just couldn’t see it yet.
The door opened and shut, and—yes, it was takeaway. Indian. Sherlock could smell it. Bit of a curious choice. The rustling got closer and then drifted farther away. Into the kitchen, being set on the table. Next came the noise of a zipper and the rustling of cloth: John removing his coat.
“Go on. A mess in your knickers. Then what?”
He wanted to come so badly it hurt.
, he thought,
With a smile, John bends forwards and—ah, yes—kisses him. Softly, though: barely a brush of his lips against Sherlock’s.
Good.
Once his bladder is empty, he stumbles into the kitchen to find the rest of the flat dark and silent. Night, then. John must be in bed.
“Yeah, that’s right. Best not struggle, Dr Watson,” said the man. His voice wavered. “Those are silver, those are. You’ll do yourself a good deal of damage if you fight.”
“Your arse should be illegal,” John said. His voice had gone thick and husky with arousal.
“Oh, that’s nice.” John’s voice was warm with approval, sending a shiver of pleasure through Sherlock’s abdomen. “Look how much slick you used. That’s my good, genius boy.”
He sounds jealous, he realises, although he isn’t. Of course he isn’t. Why would he be? The barista—Geri, evidently—is too young by John’s standards, and in any case, he’s already established that John is loyal. So loyal in fact that even if some part of him
. John wanted dearly to roll her eyes, but that had the potential to send Sherlock into a sulk for the rest of the day. “Of course you do.” She tried to keep her voice consoling but not overly so. God forbid Sherlock think she was being coddled. “Sorry. I said that poorly. I just meant that
Then, loose and wet and not quite satisfied, he wasted no time shoving Sherlock out of the way and rolling onto his stomach. He raised himself to his hands and knees—less likely for his prick to rub against anything and drive him out of his mind—and glanced over his shoulder.
Huh. It’s surprisingly easy to picture you with a dog. What was his name, or her?
out of sorts to give yourself away like that.”
And then promptly froze, stunned by the scene that awaited him.
Wiping his chin with the back of his hand—little good that did, it was all but dried now—he sat up and found himself looking at the chest of drawers. John’s chest of drawers that Sherlock had had to make room for, because John had insisted the wardrobe wasn’t big enough for them both.
It’s too much. Sherlock isn’t even hard and it’s too much. John feels wrecked, powerless, utterly used—yet when Sherlock is fully seated in John’s arse, his cock gives a little jerk, thickens just a bit, and John wishes his arms didn’t feel like sodden twigs so he could reach behind him and spread his cheeks and tell Sherlock to
“Getting high while you’re out cavorting with Mike Stamford?” Sherlock offered, perfectly amiable. He was hardly about to start an argument now.
“You were seeing her before,” Sherlock said. “Talking to her. But this is different. How?”
You prick, so you did hack into my email?
“Oh fuck,” John sighs, still clinging to Sherlock’s curls.
“The scratches you left on my back. Are you disappointed they’re gone?”
John’s eyes opened, and she dropped her cheek to the pillow, meeting Sherlock’s eye and licking her lips. She nodded, squeezing her breasts again. “A bit, yeah.” She dragged her fingers against her flesh, drawing closer and closer to her nipples until she was pinching them. Her eyelids fluttered closed, and she arched higher. “Makes me feel… mm. Hot.”
11:30 p.m.
Sherlock stopped and turned. “‘Child,’” he said, surprised and approving. “John! You can be taught.”
John breathes deeply, considering Sherlock silently. His hands continue stroking Sherlock’s hair, and Sherlock closes his eyes, allowing the gentle touch to sooth the rest of his lingering panic.
He steels himself, inhaling deeply and preparing to speak.
Not to me it isn’t.
“So you had me go to the second meeting of North London littles. As bait, I assume: a male little. And someone else went to… what, some sort of rope thing, was it?”
“Er.” John stepped inside. “What are we doing?”
The fire licking at Sherlock’s veins, the desperation gnawing at his bones, the question spinning round and round his mind as John sucked so sweetly at his cock that Sherlock’s calves tensed and cramped:
“Not necessarily true,” Sherlock said. “We go to restaurants quite often in the middle of cases.”
The words were shocking enough that John stopped, just outside the open door to the ensuite. After a moment, Sherlock seemed to realise John wasn’t following any longer and turned to him, smiling. It was a fond smile, a reassuring smile. It should’ve calmed John, but somehow it only put him more on edge.
It might have been insulting, if John’s clever nails on Sherlock’s sensitive scalp didn’t provide a compelling reason to stifle his indignation. “You just said that I would always come first,” he said instead. “Another Mary isn’t a threat to me.”
Sherlock stares into his tea. It’s still steaming, the sides of the delicate china cup nearly burning his fingers where he is gripping it. He grinds his teeth, and doesn’t answer.
“Take a taxi,” said Sherlock, in a tone that said he thought John was an idiot for thinking of doing otherwise. “I’ll pay extra to cover the fare.”
His disappointment, however, is tempered by John’s reaction.
Possible risk to his safety aside, John was certain that no one would look twice at him when there was Sherlock sitting beside him, looking like he did.
John had only ever seen a fucking machine in porn. In person, it was a great deal more intimidating than he’d imagined. Louder too—the noise itself was similar to the whirring of a blender but with the volume of a hoover. Apparently the walls of the flat were thicker than John had realised; it hadn’t sounded nearly so imposing before he’d opened the door—or perhaps, more likely, his shock was simply making him hypersensitive to it.
“Oh. Yeah, okay, that’s… yeah. You don’t have to try to keep me entertained, you know. Just because the combat hasn’t been hard—”
You can thank (or blame)
You know when you warned me you might not respond for a bit, I thought it might be longer than a day before I heard from you again. Not that I’m complaining, mind! I was happy to see your name (well, ‘ScienceOf Deduction’) in my email again so soon after the last. :)
<JohnHWatson> Arsehole.
“Does—” Sherlock swallowed thickly as her eyes fluttered closed for a moment. “Does size matter?”
by memories of your military service.”
She rolled her eyes. “Fine, fine. I’ll leave you two alone then, shall I?”
Sherlock sat, just dropped into the nearest chair so gracelessly that it clattered as though it was about to tip over. Rosie wasn’t paying any attention to them, fortunately. Sherlock had given her a stack of old newspapers, which she was cheerfully ripping to scraps whilst praising herself on her excellent success.
it. It’s just
, John thought.
was hot. Just a bit, and only in a sexual context. John’s laugh was weaker this time, half moaning. “Right. Okay. You’re, unh, you’re not expecting me to call you Daddy, are you?”
John wondered how long Sherlock had spent pondering this before coming to his conclusions. Probably a matter of minutes, but perhaps John’s psyche had puzzled Sherlock for an hour or two. That was a pleasant thought.
Okay! I’ll be there at 7 then.
Sherlock planted her palms on the bed and raised herself so that she could look between their bodies, watching as John’s bottom dimpled and quivered when Sherlock thrust against it. The sight—what was it about this sight? It scrambled her brain, caused her chest and groin to feel tight, made her gnaw her bottom lip to keep from crying at how she never wanted it to stop.
John favours oral sex, in terms of both giving and receiving. Not strongly—manual sex, intercourse, and frottage satisfy him just as well—but enough so that his preference is as obvious to Sherlock as his military background.
It… well, it did indeed look like an artfully curled tentacle, albeit only the tip of one, with two columns of turquoise-coloured suckers. John tapped at one experimentally with his thumb; it did actually feel a little like a real sucker. Or at least what John imagined a sucker would feel like. The toy was a bit squishy, rubbery in texture, and its entire length was smeared with lubricant.
When Sherlock was finished, his thoughts were sluggish and hazy, and his limbs were heavy. He was vaguely aware that he was swaying almost drunkenly and moaning weakly while John stroked his face and kissed the top of his head, although he didn’t much care at the moment. He kept his chin inclined, his eyes on John, waiting.
Well. Fortunately for him, John had never backed down from a confrontation. He did wish he’d had his pistol with him, although he comforted himself with the knowledge that even without a weapon he was far from defenceless.
were thinking. Borrowing money from your arsehole of a brother after I’d made it clear I didn’t want to be bought things in the first place. Did you think I was lying?”
John lowered her phone, frowning. A shit date, a bizarre and invasive flatmate, two spectacular orgasms, and she had no idea what to make of any of it.
Still, it shoved again, thrusting against his chest. The wood ground against his sternum, his ribs. He imagined his entire chest cavity crushed, pounded into nothing by a piece of sodding baby furniture.
A prickle of awareness, a tremor down his spine. A chill swept over his skin. He breathed deep and smelt it.
It’s probably not just those two blokes that you’ve had sex with yeah?
“Fucking hell. What’s got into you today?” John said. He was laughing, squirming. One leg hitched higher on the bed as though he meant to extricate himself from Sherlock’s grasp, but he seemed to think better of it.
There were still no words in Sherlock’s mind, but now at least they were appearing quickly enough on his tongue. “That’s near enough to a firing, isn’t it? It’s near enough at least that it damaged your pride and angered you. Your boss was unhappy you were late. You blamed me, of course.”
Discomfort spiking again, John licked his lips, and Sherlock’s gaze dropped to John’s mouth, following the motion with an intensity that made John’s breath catch. It was alarming.
Sherlock mounted the staircase and began to climb. Then, seeming to finally understand that he’d not answered John’s question at all, he hesitated on the third step and looked back.
John nipping Sherlock’s lips, hard but playful, saying ‘Going to just lie there and let me, are you? I’ve got a fake cock right here to use however I need, why would I want yours instead?’
See this is why I’m a rubbish person to fancy. I think and do things I know are awful. I’m a complete cock.
for that matter. I’ve lost countless articles of clothing to your experiments. I’ve cleaned animal remains from the tub and human remains from the fridge, and held your cock while you had a piss and wiped your arse after a shit because you’d gone and poisoned yourself like a
Then came an icy touch to his nape, trailing slowly over the healing scratches and up to his hair. His scalp prickled. His body twitched violently as cool air blew over his left ear.
Sherlock had thought that he was already as broken as he could be tonight, but the sight of John on the sofa splintered all his broken pieces even further.
Sherlock frowns, and something like alarm begins to beat against his sternum. “You said third parties were a hard limit.”
John thought for certain that that would be the end of it.
When John pulls away, Sherlock almost feels John’s taken his heart, lungs, and even bits of his liver with him, but he stays where he is. Admires how John’s eyes are dilated with arousal, how his mouth looks wet and swollen, while he waits for John to come back.
John gaped, holding the BlackBerry tightly against his ear and trying to decide which detail to comment on first. Because there were loads of things he wanted to say, starting with ‘There is nothing wrong with my shoes!’ and ending with ‘Look, mate, it’s all well and good to want to spend money on other people, but buying them things they don’t want is not on.’
<JohnHWatson> Hi!
There is so much affection, so much
Not just rich and eccentric and lonely, after all. Rich, deceptive, arrogant, eccentric, creepy
Although he did wonder if maybe Sherlock would leave off on them for a bit now. If nothing else, out of concern that John might lose control and eat one of Sherlock’s experiments if he stumbled upon it in the fridge one day.
Sherlock had grown even more rigid while he spoke, until John might’ve been leaning against the trunk of a sycamore. “It’s been a bit… rough, sure,” he admitted, and grimaced when Sherlock stiffened even further. “A lot to take in at once, no time to get used to the idea, but I’ll manage. I am managing, and it’s fine. It’ll all be fine.”
Sherlock says nothing, although his mind drifts to the weight of John’s head on his shoulder, the warmth of John’s body against his.
Sherlock surged forwards immediately, turning John and driving him back into the kitchen table. The rat corpse dropped with a thud and a squish, and then there was a hand on either side of John’s face. They cupped his jaw and smeared gore along one side of it while Sherlock ate at John’s mouth with more focus and fervour than John had ever been snogged with in his life. He couldn’t keep up and eventually stopped trying, just left his lips parted and moved obligingly whenever Sherlock tired of lapping and sucking at one part and wanted another.
that that realisation brought with it. Sherlock bowed down before it and lost herself in it. Clutched John to her as close as she could without getting in the way, cradled John’s head against her clavicle.
He takes his hands away and rubs them awkwardly against his thighs. “Apologies. I didn’t realise that I’d… that is, I had no—”
Sherlock barely had to consider it. Being in charge of another living being, one that would almost certainly die before Sherlock, perhaps in only a matter of years depending on its health…. “No,” he said grimly.
“You seem cheerful today,” said Ella during their next appointment. She scrawled something on her notepad—‘good mood,’ John caught before she set her pen down, obscuring the rest. “Any particular reason?”
John snorted, picturing Sherlock—or anyone, really—using maths to shop for sex toys. The BlackBerry chimed again.
<JohnHWatson> It wasn’t really a serious question. What did you do inside all day?
The wind was joined by the faint sound of voices in the background, which cut off abruptly when Sherlock shouted, “Shut
<Game mode changed.>
Sherlock grumbled when John sat up again and tried to follow, then huffed when the cuffs prevented her, which made John chuckle. Only Sherlock would bind
Owing mostly to the fact that some years ago, he deleted the details of them to make room for a comprehensive knowledge of nanotechnology. He kept only enough to verify that yes he had had different types of sex with various people of different genders and that no he hadn’t found any of the encounters particularly noteworthy.
Sherlock nods to indicate his agreement, and then John is stretching his skin and keeping it taut while he positions the scalpel.
Then the creaking floorboards during the night began. The misplaced objects, the cold spots. The scent of Claire de la Lune stalking him through the house.
A spark of… aggravation, exasperation, disbelief, dismay,
Took longer than I expected, sorry.
“I know you didn’t. It’s just a bit—” Invasive? Rude? Baffling? “—not good,” John decided on.
John,
Sherlock had also apologised to Mrs Hudson (which he thought John would appreciate, as John seemed inexplicably keen on apologies), showered, and then stood in front of his wardrobe for nearly thirty minutes debating his options. Ease of removal or visual appeal? Pyjamas would be more convenient in the event that John was amenable to undressing Sherlock (
