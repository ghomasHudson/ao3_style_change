In Heaven, Rami discovered that the other archangels had adopted the attitude that the apocalypse was inevitable. Humans had become too corrupt; it was time for them all to die and the Earth to start anew. When Rami asked what God thought of his beloved creations being destroyed, they revealed that it didn’t matter—God had left Heaven some time ago; they were on their own.
“Well, she knows you,” said Sam. “Or, actually, she knows Bast. She’s one of those superfans, runs a website called morethanfamily.net.”
“Mr Winchester! Mr Novak! Are you two alright?” The production manager came running over with two towels, tossing one to each of them.
Something strange was happening. Dean’s head was humming. His heart was racing. His skin was feverish. Though he wasn’t moving, he felt dizzy. What the hell was going on? It was almost like he was drunk or in heat, but he had too much clarity to be drunk and there wasn’t any of the pain associated with heat. He was just… kind of floaty. His eyes wanted to close as all the strength leached out of his muscles, leaving him as limp as cooked pasta. He was aroused, but it wasn’t important, like that part of him was put aside, like he had to reach for it to access it and it was just too much effort at the moment. Castiel asked him something. It sounded like it was coming from underwater.
“But you only dated beta women in the past.”
“Yes.” He nuzzled Castiel’s chest with his face. He hadn’t realized
He drove as fast as possible back to The Piehole, practically vibrating with nerves. Every red light seemed to take twice as long. When Dean finally exploded with “Ah, come on!” and hit the steering wheel with his left fist, Castiel reached over and put his hand on top of Dean’s right, where it was resting on the stick shift. Lifting it, he brought it to his lips, kissing Dean’s fingers and compounding the problem he was facing with his decidedly tight jeans.
“As you wish,” said Cas, light glinting off his long incisors.
“Yes, daddy. I’m your good boy.”
“So soon?” asked Sam.
“Where do you want me?” Dean asked. “Do you want to switch places? Or we could sit side by side?”
Dear AC,
When they weren’t filming, Dean would go right to his trailer and wait until he was called again, wanting to avoid even seeing Castiel. Privately, though, he would reach into his pocket where he kept his keys and hold onto the little keychain Cas had given him after the season three finale. It was a little squishy mini-figurine of Ramiel in his human vessel but with tiny golden wings. It had big blue eyes, practically no nose or mouth, and a huge head compared to the body. It was the kind of extremely cutesy merchandise that appealed to high school girls, but Dean had kept it because Cas had the matching Bast figure with a teeny Colt gun in his hand. Cas had liked to make the two figures kiss each other and talk in stupid voices. Dean would roll his eyes but smile when Cas wasn’t looking.
, but also like I might be more me than I’ve ever been? And I know that doesn’t make a lot of sense, I just know I’ve never felt like this but… maybe I’ve always wanted to. Because it doesn’t feel wrong. And I’m not just talking about the dress, though I do like how it makes me feel.” He lifted his head. “Can we sit?”
He went over to Cas and kissed his cheek, not wanting to get horny in front of his co-workers by indulging in anything deeper. Cheek-kissing and cuddling was as far as they went when they were away from home. “Hey, sweetheart,” he said, winking.
“We’ll still go, it shouldn’t take long to do a simple meet-and-greet. Get changed.”
“We’ve got shoes to worry about, let’s sit down,” Dean pointed out.
Castiel was true to his word and showed up that night close to ten. When the knock came at the back door of the shop, Dean jumped up from where he’d been measuring crust ingredients and grabbed Sam by the arm.
She was constantly disturbing Dean and Castiel’s nightly routine. They would start off knotted like usual, something that was generally repeated at least once during the night and again to begin their morning, but Dean was having to leave his daddy alone in bed several times now in order to use the toilet. They were both so used to knotting in order to sleep better and the disruptions were only going to get worse as the pups grew.
He held out the phone and rubbed his eyes with the thumb and forefinger of his other hand. He was
“Figures,” said Sam. “Dean’s always been crazy about pups.”
“Damn, you’ve got it bad.” He held up his hands. “Okay. In the interest of you being honest with him, I will stay upstairs. And if I need to come downstairs and there’s a sock on the kitchen door—”
“You haven’t been my pup for a long-ass time but I must have done something right. You turned out disgustingly responsible. Now you’re always cleaning up my messes. I don’t think I tell you enough how much I appreciate you.”
“Then I get to notice them all over again when they come back.” Retrieving his wallet, he pulled out a ten-dollar bill and placed it on the bar between them. “It’s what I’ve been calling you in my head all this time. Freckles.”
“Oh, good, I thought it was just me,” said Dean, exaggerating for humor, though he’d definitely wondered at the start of their relationship. “I didn’t know for sure until he asked me out after his first table-read for
His lack of an answer told Dean all he needed to know. This was just a quick fuck, a hollow, one-time thing. Dean had plenty of meaningless sex in the past, this was just… his first time on the receiving end.
“Then I’m going to teach you how to blow me. You know what it’s like to receive, so you should have good instincts, but I’ll guide you. Take me out of my pants.”
“And this is all I could get Dean to commit to so far,” said Cas. He didn’t mention Dean’s private Pinterest board with his rustic cowboy wedding inspiration and it only made him love the alpha even more.
“I wouldn’t mind.”
“That’s all that matters.”
“Uh huh.” Maybe he was reading into it too much, but suddenly Dean couldn’t wait to leave. “Well, thanks.”
“Well, when you are officially my partner, I will want to show you off,” said Cas, easing up from the bed and offering Dean his hands to assist him up. He was a little unsteady on his feet and gladly held onto the alpha as he began to move them to the bathroom. “I will choose your clothing, your shoes, your undergarments, all of that. I want to buy you an outfit to wear for the day, so you really get a feel for what it means to be my mate.”
“Anyway, enough about me,” said John, and Dean’s stomach turned over. “You wanted to talk about something, didn’t you?”
“The harpist played it at our engagement party,” said Cas. “It’s called
“Cas—” he said, seriously, “—really, I’m fine. I predicted this. You can’t honestly expect to retain any level of control over yourself during rut. That’s why the hiatus is scheduled when it is, to allow for any healing that needs to happen.”
His eyes warmed. “Because it makes the times when you submit to me all the more special. When you choose to do it without a command… Mm.” His scent shifted tangier. “If I hadn’t taken a suppressant while you were out in the hall, I’d get excited right now, just thinking about it.”
That was debatable, but Dean didn’t say anything. “Can I ask you a question?” he said as he handed over the cash.
He smiled. They’d toasted to this earlier and still, Cas was asking to make sure. Dean wanted to kiss the slight tremble off of those gorgeous pink lips. His adorable alpha was
“I missed you as well.” He came around and offered his hands to assist Dean in standing up, wrapping his arm around the omega’s waist in case his legs were asleep. “Are you hungry? It’s been a while since breakfast.”
“Dean, those weren’t really ‘relationships,’” Sam said.
Dean couldn’t help but agree there. Castiel’s pre-presentation body was very different from what he looked like now.
It didn’t sound like a question, really; Castiel wanted him to admit what he’d said. Dean’s face flushed red. “Y-yes, but—”
The man smiled. Suddenly, he didn’t look so tired. Or maybe the sun peeped out from behind a cloud, lighting up his face. “You like it?” he asked.
Dean snickered. “Don’t let anyone catch you reading it.”
was what forever truly felt like.
Dean hesitated. “What’s this?”
I wonder if I will hear from you in the morning or if you’ll wait for our meeting. We
“This time it was self-defense,” said Dean, gritting his teeth so he wouldn’t flinch from the burn of the antiseptic. “They can’t suspend me for that.”
“Alright, break it up, you two,” said John, slinging an arm across Dean’s shoulders. “Let’s go get your stuff and get you home.”
“Okay, sounds fair,” said a drunken Zeddmore, an interminable distance away and getting further. “I’ll leave him to you.”
Castiel’s grip tightened in a firm squeeze, then lighter as he moved down toward the base, then tighter again as he came back up to the top. Dean pressed his lips together as he moaned.
He sighed, a happy sound. “I love you, too.”
“If you don’t stop Naomi,” said Cas, “we’ll take what we have and expose her ourselves.”
He blushed. “I…” His instinct was to nay-say it, to deflect the compliment, possibly with some kind of smart-ass remark. That was his go-to. But the switch that had flipped in his brain was telling him something different for once.
Have you no shame?”
“Hmm?”
The line was actually ‘I need your skills’ but still, Zeddmore kept rolling. Castiel was listening to Dean’s advice about improvising.
“I guess I really owe him one,” said Dean, grudgingly, picking at a loose thread on the leather jacket.
“You,” he said, “you’re the one from last night.”
“What is it you were seeking?” Cas asked. “A punishment? A reward? As long as you’re honest with me and can tell me what you want, I’ll give it to you.”
“I haven’t even started fucking you yet,” he said.
Cas stroked his face, smiling down at him. “Have you been kneeling long?”
Floating. No body, no tether. Weightless. Dean as a person didn’t exist. It was all just suspended, more feeling than felt. Like the vastness of space, but warm like the softest, coziest blanket ever. He’d had small tastes of this when he’d gone into sub-space before, but he’d always had the sense of knowing where his body was. This was like leaving the earth entirely and fully entering the astral plane.
“Humans would still have free will, though,” said Bast. “They can choose the wrong path if they want to.”
That was woefully vague but at the same time, all he could really describe without being too graphic. He squirmed, remembering the dream even now, his breath coming faster as he recalled the body pressed up against him, the wandering hands, the warm, soft lips, and the voice in his ear that sounded far too much like Dean’s own voice, just because he didn’t know what AC sounded like. That was the only part of the dream that had left him unsatisfied.
She pressed her lips together - not quite a smile, but more than Dean expected considering the stress of the evening. “How could I refuse?” said Naomi. “Of course. You should go home. We can celebrate your impending nuptials another night.”
“Oh,” Cas sighed, closing his eyes briefly.
“What the hell?” Dean exclaimed. “How is it fair to make a deal with someone when they don’t even know what they’re signing up for?”
gotten off. On purpose. Wow. Just the latest in a long line of firsts.
“A couple after my own heart,” said Dean, grinning. “We’re in.”
A messy haired Castiel was standing barefoot at the stove, handling multiple frying pans at once, humming to himself and wearing only navy boxer-briefs and Dean’s gray Metallica t-shirt. He looked completely at home, like he just belonged there. It took everything in Dean’s considerable willpower to not sneak up behind him and wrap his arms around his waist and kiss his neck like he really wanted to do. He wrapped his bathrobe around himself more securely to disguise how suddenly
Dear AC,
“Cut!” Zeddmore stood up from his chair behind the monitors. “Awesome! Great work,
His heart began to pound faster and faster the closer he came to the park, but he didn’t stop, didn’t turn around. No matter how hard this was for him, Castiel was doing something even harder and Dean owed it to him to be honest.
“Then your memory sucks. I talked to the garbage man the other day.”
I’m sitting up in my bed. You could be here next to me, it’s a Queen size. Memory foam.
How are you feeling?
Cas didn’t listen, he just hauled Dean into the bedroom and tossed him down on the bed. The springs squeaked as the demon climbed on top of him. “I’ll do it,” he said. “I’ll jam your signal.”
“Not bad, just different. The mango one reminded me of a spicy fruit and cheese danish. You know, after I could breathe normally again. It really packed a punch! Can I try this one, too?”
“Jerk.”
“Then say it,” said Cas, his lips moving against the omega’s jaw. “You know what I want to hear.” His hand never stopped on Dean’s cock and the other moved down to begin thrusting shallowly into his drenched opening. “Come on.”
“Good, I don’t want to have to get Uncle Bobby to kick your ass.” Sam sighed. After a moment, he seemed to decide something and asked, “Did you ever wonder why I let Castiel take you home all those times? Why I trusted him, even though he’s an alpha?”
, sent off warning bells in his head. Didn’t names have power? He seemed to remember his granddad saying something like that when he was little. Dean had never believed in the supernatural, but he currently had a demon sitting on top of him, rutting their huge cock against his through his underwear, and well, that tended to put things in a new perspective real quick. Come to think of it, ‘Cas’ probably wasn’t even this guy’s real name. He’d said Dean could
“Don’t worry, Dean,” said Cas as he stripped off his leather jacket and wrapped it around Dean’s head and shoulders. “I know what to do. Just breathe for me, can you do that?”
Feeling his ears turning pink but unable to look away from those sky-blue eyes, he denied it, “No.” He fumbled with the bag on his shoulder, pushing the strap up. “I didn’t look like… I didn’t need to say anything.”
more with the alpha. To see if there was anything to that moment when he’d first glimpsed those red eyes. If it would feel different than all the other times Dean had loved ‘em and left ‘em.
“Oh,” Cas sighed, sounding euphoric. “My sweet boy, you’re so good—you’re
“That’s it,” Dean grumbled, hackles raised, as he stomped between them with Cas hot on his heels.
is always going to be one of the best things to ever happen to me. I was still so new to acting when I first took on Ramiel, so I consider myself very lucky.”
Dean would know that gravelly voice anywhere. He pressed the ‘close’ button in rapid succession, hoping Novak would miss the elevator, but a hand stopped the door before it could shut.
They were very valid concerns. What would it be like, Dean wondered, to be with each other intimately for real? There was a big possibility that Castiel could fall apart on him, halting all proceedings in the middle because he couldn’t handle it yet. It might be a little frustrating, he decided, but Dean knew that he’d rather sit there and talk him through it until he felt better than give up on their fledgling relationship. Castiel was worth however long it took to be comfortable in his own skin. Hell, he actively wanted to help him get there, even if it ultimately didn’t work out between them. He cared enough to just want to help.
He began to shake as Castiel touched his prostate through his anal wall, making his cloaca clench around nothingness as slick leaked out and dripped down one thigh. He’d totally abandoned the blowjob, too lost to the intensity, though the wet cock was still right up against his face.
Dean didn’t even look up from the dough he was kneading. “I can and I am.”
“And my father, Cain,” Cas finished.
“One bad review is all it takes to dry up your business. You remember what happened to the Victorian Tea Room across town.” He checked the boxes of produce Sam had brought in earlier. “Where are the white strawberries?”
“This is awfully familiar,” Cas commented.
John was off the show now as a result of this production shake-up. It was a big deal to kill off their main character (though Dean believed it had more to do with the incest porn links sent anonymously to the higher-ups at the network), but John would come back sparingly for flashbacks and maybe even a possible resurrection down the line if the season went well. The media had pounced on them at the announcement, wanting to know if John harbored any ill-will toward his son for usurping the top billing. But no, John wasn’t really upset about it at all since the network had set up another well-paying gig for him already, and the zombie show was even more popular than
Dean bit his lip, almost brought to the point of tears. He blinked them back. He heard all of what his brother was saying and not saying, but also, his mind was replaying AC’s words from his dream early this morning… and now he could hear them in Castiel’s deep, low voice. It sent a shiver up his spine.
“Unfortunately, that doesn’t matter,” said Webb. “The public decides what it looks like.”
He sighed. “You’re fine now, but… you’re still mostly human. The longer it infects your system, the more demon you’ll be.”
have this. It was right within his grasp, literally!
“Okay, okay! Got it!”
“That’s natural,” said Dean. “As long as they know they have an out, that there’s someone who will fight for them, there’s hope.”
Dean sucked that cock like he’d been born to do it, moving fast and sucking hard, teasing each ridge and swirling his tongue around the head. Rather than random veins, the little raised parts seemed to be symmetrical, like it was on purpose.
His eyes glazed with tears, Cas smiled. “Of course.”
“They already saw,” said Dean over his shoulder, heading back. “It won’t matter if they see me again. Daddy needs me!”
Moving slowly, Cas gently worked his index finger in up to the first joint, rotating and easing Dean into the stretch. Dean breathed out, concentrating on releasing the ring of muscle that instinctively wanted to tighten, allowing Cas entry up to his first knuckle.
“Aww!” He pouted. “Good thing you’re gonna have more. I’ll prove myself yet.”
problem now!”
Dean looked down at himself. He couldn’t see anything different. Cas cleared his throat and pointed up above his head. Dean craned his neck to look behind him and almost fell over if not for Cas holding onto him.
“No,” said Dean, reaching for one of Castiel’s hands and squeezing. “I only need you.”
Dear AC,
“Here he is, in the flesh!” said Dean, pounding his brother on the shoulder. “I know, he’s shorter on the internet.” Amid the good-natured chuckles, they started making the rounds, introducing Sam to all the people he’d previously only spoken to over video chat, ending with Naomi where Gabriel took over.
Utterly grossed out, Dean felt his breakfast slosh in his stomach like a tiny boat in a turbulent ocean. While throwing up on this guy would undoubtedly be a turn-off, he really wanted to keep it down. Hauling back with his fist, Dean punched the man right in the face as hard as he could. “Get the fuck off me, you fucking pervert!”
He looked at that last line for a long time. ‘See you Sunday.’ Sunday! That was only a few days away! He had to make his best loaf of bread by then and he still had a shop to run!
“No. I don’t have the ability to feel much of anything except pleasure when I’m like that. Besides,” he squeezed the alpha’s hands, “you were there. I knew I was safe.”
Dean beamed at him. There’s that manner of speech he loved.
Castiel couldn’t help grinning at that. “Of course, I recognize when someone is attractive, but…”
Dean put on a black button-down shirt that would hide any unsightly sweat that might occur and his nicest jeans. He chose the jacket that made his green eyes stand out and brushed his teeth. He made sure his hair looked good, standing up at all the right angles. He took a deep breath, looking at himself in the mirror, and swallowed hard. It was time to face the music.
“And you are?” asked Cas, turning back to the peaches.
They decided to try for the rings and figure out the rest as they went along. There were episodes dedicated to stopping each horseman and with great difficulty, Rami and Bast manage to subdue War and Pestilence. The show had its first major change in the narrative with Famine.
It was one of Dean’s very favorite classic rock songs and he couldn’t think of another one with better lyrics to describe their relationship. In the dark of the bathroom, he wrapped his arms around his torso and slowly moved back and forth, pretending it was Castiel he was dancing with. He imagined leaning his head against the other man’s cheek, feeling the scruff of his five o’clock shadow. Knowing that he was doing the same thing, hopefully at the same time, it brought tears to Dean’s eyes. Immediately, his stuffy nose began to pour with snot, which ruined the mood somewhat and he had reason to be glad that he was alone.
It was the only connection he had to his Cas. Because the cold man he currently acted opposite? That was Castiel.
Castiel lifted his head and scented the air. His growl stuttered in his throat.
“Thank you,” he said, emotionally, holding the papers as if they were made of gold.
Sam looked at Dean like he was about to swallow his tongue while Cas offered his hand to him.
Her brows lifted in mild surprise. “So direct.” She stood up. “I’ll return the favor, then.” She took a few steps toward Dean. “It isn’t that I
Everything inside him curled up and rolled in the downy softness of sheer happiness that phrase brought him. Those were some of his favorite words Cas ever said because it meant that Dean didn’t have to worry about anything, he could trust that his alpha had it all under control. And Dean found he loved the feeling of being taken care of, knowing that someone - Cas - was always right there to catch him.
Dean smiled. They were on the same page. “Are you ready to start clean-up?”
Lately, that meant a sex toy of some kind. “Oh?” said Dean, mildly interested.
The pups fell fully asleep during the impromptu song and dance session, so Sam helped Dean put them down in their cribs while Gabe and Cas got dinner for the grown-ups ready in the kitchen. Transferring the pups into their beds naturally made them wake up a little, so the brothers rubbed their backs and murmured soothingly to get them to drift off again.
“Never mind.”
Swinging around, Dean punched the wall with the flat of his palm to avoid making his injuries worse, but it didn’t calm his anger. “Son of a bitch!”
“Very good. We should probably stop for tonight, I got you too worked up.” He hesitated. “Unless you need more?”
“Shut up!”
Mike elbowed his twin in the gut. “Tea,” he said emphatically. “We also have teas.”
“Really, really great job today, guys!” he said. “You were in rare form! Because of this, we’ll get the finale done under budget.” He lowered his voice and added, “Which we’ll put toward the after-party, otherwise the network will expect us to make do with less money next season. Best not to set unrealistic expectations.”
He reached for the box and lifted the lid, a watery sound that was half a laugh, half a sob escaped him when he saw a bigger version of the same chocolate pies from the wedding. “I knew it was you,” said Cas, his voice breaking. “It had to be you.”
“I can imagine.”
“Damn right, you won’t!” said Dean.
“I have things that will help,” said Dean, slowly sitting up so he wouldn’t get dizzy. Cas followed his example. “And I’ll tell you if there’s a problem or we should stop.” He cradled Castiel’s face in his hands. “Are you sure you want to do this?”
He thought about it for a moment, then nodded. “I think maybe it does.” His brow furrowed slightly. “What’s an impact massage?”
“Somebody with weird taste, I guess.”
AngelCakes:
“Shut up. Where’s the box?”
Sam: I’m a phone call away.
“Damn. I smell hot.”
Dean grinned. “It’s perfect.”
A shiver racked Dean’s frame. Damn it! His magnetism was impossible to ignore. He wrapped his arms around Castiel’s shoulders and began to rise and fall on his own. He couldn’t reject this man, his heart
Sam growled deep. “That
The hair on the back of Dean’s neck stood up. “Warned me about what?”
Closing the door after them, Dean grabbed Castiel by the lapels of his trench coat and gently pulled him in, kissing him slowly, smiling against his lips when Cas opened his mouth at once. While Dean distracted him with his tongue, he eased the coat from Castiel’s shoulders, letting it fall.
to mate me or his loans won’t get paid. Paying them now takes that off the table. It’s done, I can’t un-pay them. I want him to choose me simply because he wants me. And if he doesn’t, well, I would be crushed, but I wouldn’t make him pay me back for something I did of my own free will.”
“I think he’s getting dinner,” a teamster volunteered, resulting in a groan from the director.
Darting forward to close the distance between them, Dean grabbed Castiel’s face with both hands, stopping the tirade with his mouth and kissing him thoroughly. A drop of wetness slid between their lips, flavoring the kiss with salty desperation. Dean climbed into Castiel’s lap, straddling his thighs, needing to be closer, as close as possible. When the kiss ended, Cas had finally stopped his self-beratement and was only whimpering in distress. The air around them was thick with it.
After first pulling his underwear down his thighs, Dean lay down on his side and Cas helped him to pull them the rest of the way off, giving him all the access he could want. They stayed that way for a minute, totally naked at last, no more barriers between them. Castiel reached for Dean’s face, threading his fingers through his short hair and leaning in to kiss him.
“No,” he said, to Dean’s surprise. “What do they say?”
Dean lashed out, but with the disadvantage of a floor-length dress and heels preventing greater range of movement and the two alphas coming at him from both sides, he found he couldn’t fend them off at the same time. Despite having taken down multiple assailants in the past, it was like the twins were used to working together this way, moving in perfect synchronicity, and the implications of that chilled him to the bone. He made sure to get in a few good punches before they wrenched his arms pinned behind him and they were tying his wrists with Michael’s tie. But he hadn’t made it easy for them and continued to struggle as best he could. The lace of his dress was torn and splattered with blood, both theirs and his as he could taste that his lip was split.
Castiel: Noted. I was calling it the Sweet and Spicy pie, but I like that better – Sweet Punishment. For only the bravest cheesecake lovers. I’d like to do further experimentation. Would you be willing to be my test subject if I brought new things by your establishment sometimes? It would probably be very late; I don’t have a lot of time during the day.
His eyes were still glassy as he gripped Castiel’s wrists. “Cas, I’m falling in love with you,” he whispered, not calling him ‘daddy’ on purpose because they were alone and he’d been told to answer him as Dean. “But I’m afraid of crashing, too. I love how it feels, being yours, but it scares me. I’m scared that if you take me apart and put me together in a totally new way, I won’t know what to do if you drop me. I won’t be me anymore.”
He exhaled and nodded. “So ready.”
“It’s alright, beloved,” Cas said, caressing Dean’s back in long up-and-down movements with his warm hands. “It’s all over. It’s done. I’m so proud of you. You took your punishment so beautifully. My good boy, you’re such a good boy for me.”
shouldn’t have let him choose the restaurant since Dean didn’t care for fish on a good day, let alone when he wasn’t given the decency of having it cooked. So, he’d only ingested alcohol and sake was a devious drink, especially on an empty stomach. It didn’t let you know how drunk you were until
“But one day he won’t even be able to see you,” said Novak, gesturing to encompass the art glass studio they were standing in. “Let alone the beautiful work you do.”
Dean had no idea how Cas could stand there and smile at him when he’d caught him with his fangs bared again. What he
“Huh,” said Gabe, putting his chin in his hand and leaning his elbow on the edge of the table as he gave Sam a half-lidded leer, “maybe I should practice more often.”
of good things that had happened… He was living on his own, away from his shitty father. His apartment was tiny and cold in the winter and sweltering in the summer, but it was his. He had a job he enjoyed and a boss who didn’t give him too much crap. And now Sam was going to Stanford, on his way to a great life. All Dean had to worry about was himself. Probably for the best, although he missed Sam, he didn’t need to be screwing up his brother’s life with his bad luck.
“I think they’ll end up alright.” Dean took a look inside the envelope and his brows lifted high on his forehead. After a moment’s consideration, he held it out to Cas. “You take it,” he said. “For going above and beyond.”
The alpha smiled more easily than he had in the last several days. “It means you’re human, like the rest of us.”
“Pieman.”
“About her,” Gabe finished for him, nodding. “I get it. Let me talk to her. I feel like I know you guys pretty well and I’ve been dancing circles around her my whole life. I can make her think almost anything is her idea.”
“Ahh.” Dean laughed uncomfortably. “It’s nothing.”
“I still feel the need on occasion to reflect on my past actions, though I know it won’t change anything now,” Cain said. “I hope that it will help inform me on what I should do or say in the future. The main thing I learned was to listen more and impress my own feelings less. That’s why I don’t have any objections to this relationship and no expectations beyond the two of you loving each other. And I can already see that you do.”
“You sound surprised. I’d do anything for you.”
Cas whined softly and Dean could smell the distress coming off of him in waves; sad for the younger Dean that he’d not been around to protect. The omega looked down at their hands because he couldn’t hold Castiel’s intense eye contact.
“Hey, lasagna goes great with pizza, plus Garth always eats enough for three people,” said Dean.
more product. Only offering one thing is limiting our customers.”
“Maybe the sugar will give me some energy,” said Dean as Castiel cut them each a slice of his latest creation. This one was covered in neat peaks of whipped cream and had a swirl of the familiar orange drizzle on top. When he placed the piece of pie on the plate, the filling was yellow. “Is this a supreme filling?”
He shook his head. “I have to do this. You understand, don’t you?”
“I’m not looking back after this,” Dean panted. “This is his final chance to do something good for himself. He can take it or not, I don’t care anymore. I’ve got a family to care about. And… well, that just can’t include him.”
Are we really still meeting today?
“Of course not,” she said. “I would never want to
He tilted his head, thoughtfully. “It does make me wonder what it would do to you if I
The three of them tried the pie, this one with a green filling. Sam coughed, much less tolerant of spice than Dean.
“They’re not all bad. The rest of my siblings are decent people. You’ll probably get to meet at least a few of my sisters if they have time to stop by.”
“It’s Winchester,” he said when Bela’s voicemail picked up. “I decided I’ll take you up on your offer as long as that picture never gets out. Call me back to meet up. You give me the hard data and prove you’ve destroyed all copies.”
Rami looked at Bast with huge eyes, Bast looked down at Ramiel’s abdomen, speechless.
Castiel’s gaze sharpened. “Dean, are you hiding something from me?”
“Nice to see you, too, Gabriel,” said Bast, rolling his eyes.
“You don’t have to do that.”
taking orders from anyone, really.
much better than I hoped.”
The producer gave Castiel a long, hard look, then sighed. “You’d both better be careful not to feed anything else to the media. We’ll handle the ‘spin’ on this photo when it’s published, make sure it gets out what really happened. But there can’t be anything else after this. Please keep in mind that the two of you can tank this show with just one mistake.”
“We could do worse. What about her middle name?”
Cas inquired as to how Gabe’s bakery was doing, another reason he was considered the ‘black sheep’ of the family, he had his own business outside of the Archangel Network. He chatted for a little while about the new pastries he’d recently created until a raise in general volume on the other side of the room caught their attention. Curious, the three of them wandered over to see what was happening. Inside a ring of people, Michael and Lucifer’s mates were in a sixty-nine position, just going to town on each other while their alphas watched with the rest of the spectators.
You could come over id leave the door open
Cas as Ramiel stared at him. “How did you do that?” he demanded, getting to his feet and coming over to where Dean was looking at his hands in bewilderment.
“Uh-huh,” Cas said in a watery voice, a bit muffled against Dean’s chest.
“Speaking of plans,” said Cain, “hope I’m not overstepping here, but where do you two stand on pups?”
“This spot, right here,” said the phantom voice. “I want to see your wrecked face.”
“What are you talking about?” asked Dean.
“The day’s not over yet,” said Dean.
“Nick Munroe. Nice to meet you.”
“You said I could have anything, Dean.” He waited. “Didn’t you?”
“So, not anymore?”
“I can drive you. Your legs and back ache, don’t they?”
“You’re not my real dad,” Jack sassed, making Dean proud. He bit into the bar he had unwrapped and rolled his eyes back in pleasure.
Whimpering, Gabriel nodded. “Yes, dearest. I’ve missed you so much.”
The demon thrust at a fever pitch, breathing roughly against Dean’s neck. Without being able to move, all Dean could do was lie there and accept, which gave him nothing to focus on but the crazy amounts of pleasure coursing through him until he couldn’t take it anymore and tumbled over the edge. Falling and falling… back into his body with a sudden jolt.
Dean took a cursory look in the mirror and pretended to check his hair. “Yeah, looks good, man. Can’t even tell I’m not really hurt.”
“What?”
we can shower.”
“Hey, man,” said Sam, sounding surprised. “A real phone call? What’s up?”
“Yes, it is.” He reached over Dean’s lap and unfastened his seatbelt, then cold hands were taking his and gently pulling. “Step out.”
There was a new Top Ten list out—“Male Celebrities People Most Want to Spend the Holidays With.” Number one: Castiel Novak. Number two: Dean Winchester. He smacked the magazine against his forehead. Second place,
“Really? Hold on… Here, take your boots off, and let’s sit back.”
He turned away, shaking his head. Only Sam and his dad knew about that particular incident, for good reason – to make sure nothing like that ever happened to Dean again. “It’s not something I want to talk about.”
“Now all you gotta worry about is meeting
A polite throat-clearing behind them had Dean’s cheeks flushing pink and he turned, extending his hand for Cas, who took it and joined their little circle with a smile. “Sam, this is the alpha courting me, Castiel Novak,” he said, dropping his eyes demurely. “Daddy, this is my younger brother, Sam.”
“Okay.” He swallowed, thickly, already getting aroused just thinking about it. Having that much power and control over Cas, especially when he’d needed the opposite for the last two months, was a heady thought. “Can I… ask why?”
“No, please, please,” he begged, dragging his hands through Castiel’s hair. “I want us to come together.”
“You should show me some damn respect!” John snapped. “Both you, and your ungrateful brat of a brother! I am your blood!”
He sobered immediately at his brother’s grave voice. “What? What is it?” Cas froze and looked up.
“Well, the last time we were here,” Dean said as he walked backward, “I did something really crappy and made us both miserable. I’d like to replace that memory with a better one.”
“Mm-mm,” Dean managed to answer in the negative. With his arms free, he reached up and grasped the metal railing of the headboard, hanging on in order to provide some resistance. It helped him to feel Castiel’s hands around his neck better and thrust back against him.
“Okay, but why show up here, specifically?” asked Bast.
Dear AC,
“I’m so sorry, Dean,” he said, brokenly. “I know I shouldn’t be here; I don’t deserve to be here, but I needed you—”
The kitchen was soon filled with the sound of whirring stand mixers. Dean and Castiel worked like mad men with Cas keeping one eye on what Dean was doing and the other on the slabs of piped meringue. For the longest time, it didn’t appear like anything was happening, but once the tops started turning brown, he turned the oven off and left them in for an additional twenty minutes to dry them out. When they came out of the oven, they used baking sheets to fan them off. It was uncertain whether or not this cooled them down faster, but it felt better to take a more active role in it rather than just waiting.
“Oh, God, daddy!” he sobbed, squeezing his eyes shut in an effort to hold off his orgasm.
Does weather effect the result of bread at all, like elevation? I know my body tends to freak out whenever we transition into Fall like we are now and I end up with sniffles for a week or so – does bread freak out when it gets colder? And I’m never sure how long I’m supposed to knead. Five minutes? Ten? An hour?
He sighed deeply after his first sip of coffee and the world began to right itself as the cobwebs were chased out of his mind. He watched Cas over the rim of his mug and noted that the shirt didn’t quite cover his excellently rounded bottom. Oh, he could get used to this scene
“I told her about Pieman and how he makes me feel. She cried and said she was happy for me. She asked me if I’d said anything to the rest of the family and I told her that Gabe supports me.”
“Cas?” Dean called as he came through the door, juggling a huge paper sack in his arms. “I’m home. Mrs Butters gave me a ton of peaches. Do you know how to do pie or cobbler?”
you somehow managed to fight your way through the legions of Hell and found your father’s soul… where would it have gone? Last I recall, your father’s body is still six feet under.” Lifting a hand, he rested it on Dean’s chest.
“I’ve got it, don’t leave!” she said frantically, her veil streaming behind her.
“I had it delivered last night,” said Cas, walking behind Dean and leading him with his hands covering Dean’s eyes. “I just hope you’ll like it. Otherwise, I’ve made a gross miscalculation.”
“I may have never given birth before,” said Rami through clenched teeth, “but this pup is coming whether it’s time or not! Now help me onto the bed!”
” He had no idea what it was, but trusted his brother to know.
“Dean.” A hand touched his face and he dared to look again as Castiel chuckled. “It’s okay. I figured you weren’t ready, that’s why I took them. But you will get fucked tonight.” He leaned down and reached under the bed, producing a silicone wand that curved in a slight S-shape and had a slight widening toward the base. Not as big as a regular alpha’s knot, but large enough to hold it in place by itself. “With this.”
They were silent for a while. Castiel closed his eyes, lifting his face to the breeze. Dean kept his gaze on the prince, watching his dark hair play in the wind. He leaned his weight on one leg, his left hand going automatically to rest on the hilt of the dagger he always kept at his side. He could only imagine what Castiel was thinking, feeling so alone, essentially going from one cage to another, living in a body that was only mostly his.
I don’t want you to think that my opinion of you hangs on your looks. It doesn’t. I have nothing but respect for you too. I just want us both to want the same thing. I’m not sure if I’ve ever wanted something more.
Castiel purred, using his other hand to smear it all over his stomach. “You like that, too, don’t you? Seeing me covered in you. Because this is your territory, too, isn’t it, Dean?”
Dean returned his smile, warmth rising in his cheeks. “Me, too.” He groaned, only too aware that a sneaky paparazzo could be lurking nearby, preventing them from any overt PDA. “Ugh, I wish we were in private because I really want to kiss you right now.”
He held up his phone and showed a video he’d taken. Seeing himself on the little screen, Dean’s hazy memories started to return. Novak had taken them out to a sushi place. He
Dean lifted his brows. “Yeah? Well, I’ve got news for you, buddy.” He swaggered over to stand almost nose-to-nose with Castiel. “You can send that vessel back home to his mommy because I don’t intend on listening to whatever ‘guidance’ you think I need. My responsibilities officially ended when I buried my dad. Got it?”
“The guy in the strip mall that does Reiki healing. Your chakras would never be out of alignment again.”
job to punish you, remember? When you give that to me, you can let it go and not worry about it. Alright?”
He hit Dean a couple more times enthusiastically before heading into the kitchen and patting Castiel on the shoulder. “Welcome back,” he said, smiling and grabbing an apron off the wall. “Looks like we’ll be needing a new one of these.”
Smiling, he closed his eyes again to go back to sleep. He was warm and safe, loved and cared for. All was as it should be.
exist then, not while he was held by his daddy who loved him, filled to the brim with the proof of that love both literally and figuratively, with the reassuring weight of his golden collar around his neck, his validation that he was
“You’re gonna have to,” said Dean, swaggering over and wrapping his arms around Castiel’s neck. “Because I always watch the finale live in order to get real-time reactions from the fans. Think you can resist me for that long?”
Re: Dreams
“You promise?”
All Dean could do was pant and moan, going absolutely crazy with want. He didn’t have the brainpower necessary to explain that
It was perfect.
“Can we?”
“That doesn’t matter. You’re my alpha, end of story.”
He bit his lip around a smile. “Oh, I definitely want to.”
Sam was standing over him with his arms crossed. “The floor of my living room,” he said, bitch-face firmly in place.
“Damn, is that a Fitbit?” said Dean, picking up one of the many boxes. “I didn’t even know we had them as a sponsor.” He picked up a long tube-shaped container and started opening it to see what was inside since it didn’t have a brand on it. “Sam, do I have anything scheduled during hiatus once my heat is over? Or do you typically wait until—”
“Ah. You’re here,” said a low, rough voice that tripped up Dean’s spine like fur being rubbed the wrong way. The man with the tone like velvet over gravel stood up from his desk where he’d been working and approached. “A pleasure to meet you. I’m Castiel Novak.”
Together, they headed across the empty street.
“Did something happen last night?”
Dean walked around in a circle and dipped his face into Castiel’s line of sight. “I dunno, Cas, am I?”
“Oh, excuse me,” Dean laughed. “Well, prepare yourself.”
Dean rose from his bed and padded over to the alpha. Cas took Dean’s hands in his, stroking his thumbs over the backs while avoiding the bandages and looking up at the omega with warmth in his blue eyes.
Castiel confronts Chuck with Dean at his side.
He unlocked the phone to verify and gulped. “Of course. Rut’s coming. She wants to stake her claim before that happens.” Putting down the phone, he ran his hand over his forehead. “Fuck.”
“Yeah. One night, Arthur, my manager, sent me to a ‘networking’ party. He told me that all kinds of influential people would be there — directors, producers, photographers, musicians, politicians… That should have tipped me off but I didn’t know shit back then. Arthur used a key card to send me up to the penthouse suite and the elevator opened right up into this sex party. The scent of aroused alphas all over the place was overwhelming. There was an omega presenting to a man practically right in front of me. There was a topless girl with an old man. Everywhere I looked, something terrible was happening and I was too shocked to even move. I couldn’t speak. I hoped I was having some kind of nightmare because I couldn’t believe that my own manager would send me there, would expect me to—”
“Caramel apple rhubarb,” he said, definitively. “Final answer.”
Rami looked from their son to Bast. “What do you think?” he asked. “This is a lot more responsibility than you ever thought you were signing up for.”
“Rami,” he said, his voice the horrible rasp of a demon, “I’m getting us the Hell outta Hell.”
“No,” he said, still smiling. “Disappointed?”
“Don’t stress about it, we both have a full work day ahead of us, let’s get through that first.” He stopped Castiel with a hand at his elbow. “Hey.”
. What kind of alpha would bear that kind of indignity?
“And now that it’s public,” said Dean, standing up from the couch and pulling Cas with him, “I can finally do
“But Az,” said Bast, immediately giving him a nickname. “This isn’t why we had you. I mean, you can’t just… become a whole-ass person and, and immediately run off to kill the devil.”
Not that Dean would ever tell anyone this, but he was an active lurker on many social media and fanfiction websites (codenamed: mtp-sock-puppet). He liked to keep his finger on the pulse of what the audience wanted and there was no better way to do it than reading what they dreamed up for the characters. The fans were a wildly creative bunch and obviously getting tired of the ‘monster of the week’ format that they’d been using. They wanted more of a focused direction for the show. Not only that, but there was a
“Hungry?” asked Dean. “You like cheesecake.”
He leaned in and gave Dean’s neck a corrective nip in warning for the sass, but when he pulled back, Cas was smiling. “Again, I’m here to see to all your needs, beloved, but I’m not a mind reader. If you’re hiding your unhappiness, I may not see it. That’s why our communication is so important.”
He grinned and it put all of the smiles Dean had received before to shame. It held a hint of mischievousness as he said, “That’s what I want.”
As Cas returned to his laptop, he kept one hand on top of Dean’s head, lazily stroking his hair while Dean closed his eyes and leaned his head against Castiel’s thigh while he nursed his alpha’s knot. He continued to come for several minutes and Dean swallowed it all down, loving the taste of honeyed almonds and the feeling of being filled in an entirely new way.
, I guess you could say.”
Swirling the ice in the glass, Angel Eyes took a longer pull, maintaining eye contact with Dean as he rolled the whiskey slowly over his tongue. Dean’s mouth went dry as he watched his Adam’s apple bob up and down when he swallowed. Unconsciously, he licked his lips and those bluer than blue eyes followed the movement.
Tilting his head back, Dean laughed. It made him tighten around his daddy in quick pulses, earning him a rumbling moan and a bright flare of red in Castiel’s eyes. “You have everything all planned out, don’t you?” he asked, leaning down for a kiss.
“You remember that bruschetta guy from yesterday?”
Dean grit his teeth, determined not to give in, even as he panted and a multitude of sensations built and his body began leaking slick like a freaking faucet. He moaned and panted and whimpered as Cas played him like a harp, knowing exactly which string to pluck to get exactly the reaction he wanted. It wasn’t long before a few tears of frustration were forming at the corners of Dean’s golden eyes.
He suspected Cas was dealing with a burgeoning situation in his pants and a quick glance behind him confirmed that. “Don’t worry, your jacket is hiding it for now. We’ll make this fast.”
“Yes, daddy,” he moaned.
“I’m… not sure I even
“You naughty minx,” said Cas, a filthy grin on his lips. “Even during the photo shoot?”
Castiel shrugged. “Maybe?” he said again. “Probably not, just based on how I feel about him. When I was with women, I never felt more than physical satisfaction and a sense of ‘this is what is normal, this is what I should be doing.’ For a few years now, I thought I was utterly indifferent to sexuality.”
“Look up the Archangel Network.”
“I’m not! But Sam… this is his first time.” He gestured vaguely at himself. “You know.”
“Yes…” He could feel Castiel’s cock twitching deep inside him, a feeling so erotic that it almost made him orgasm right then. “It’s so good, Cas, so fucking good…”
He didn’t realize all the noise he was making until the haze receded a little more, but Dean couldn’t bring himself to care. He’d never experienced anything so intense in his whole life. Dimly, he noticed Cas was coming, too, and Dean’s arms had come up around him, holding the base of his wings.
Cas took the phone before it could drop out of Dean’s nerveless hand. “Sam.” He listened for a good minute, keeping hold of his mate and watching him closely. Currently, Dean’s distress was manifesting as speechless bewilderment and a smoky acridness in his scent. “Got it.” He hung up and told his mate, “Pack a bag.”
After finishing their dinner and sharing the rest of the milkshake, Cas got up from the table and set the used plate aside on his desk, disposed of the paper trash in the bin, then returned to Dean and held out his hands.
“Good boy.”
“Since we’re going to have so many pups, we’re constantly going to be running the risk of getting walked in on,” said Cas, likewise helping Dean out of the dress he’d worn to work. “Better to not hide it at all so they don’t associate it with shame or as something that has to be kept private. When pups grow up with casual intimacy and public discipline, it becomes as natural to them as breathing. And we won’t have to sacrifice our needs in the name of modesty.”
did. Something just… clicked.”
“You seem to need it so badly tonight, beloved,” he purred. “You’re dripping for me.”
As a reward, Cas adjusted the height of the rig until he could fuck him in the air, holding onto the ropes around Dean’s legs. Slow, gentle thrusts that ramped them both up to orgasm at a snail’s pace and wouldn’t disturb the twins. But the relaxed speed was kind of the point - the time it took to do shibari properly, the slow way Cas built up their mutual pleasure - it was all about the journey and being grateful for the process. In a way, it was another lesson in patience, just more meditative in nature. It echoed the pregnancy itself, how they were anticipating each milestone and monitoring the progress carefully, but it wasn’t all about being focused on the destination. They enjoyed each moment as it arrived and appreciated them all as a reminder of how fortunate they were.
you get them into after that, that’s on you.”
“I’m so sorry that happened,” she said. “Are you alright, Sam?”
Sam sent back almost immediately, “Wow!” and an emoji with huge eyes. Dean grinned. The thought of introducing Sam to Cas was still a nerve wracking one, but he had hope. And that was big.
“Gabriel!” Rami cried, running to him and pulling him inside, into his arms.
“Ugh, you sound like a maître’d,” said Luce, preceding his brother out of the lounge in a loose, loping gait. “How about ‘let’s dance’?”
Dean stared at him, then laughed. “You’re learning.”
“It’s not important.” Leaning on one arm, the demon laid his free hand over Dean’s sternum.
Dean shrugged, feigning innocence and probably failing. “I mean, if you’re not
Reaching over, Dean grabbed one of the tissues he’d set aside earlier and offered it to Cas as he carefully removed his fingers. Wiping them dry, Cas then grabbed the bottle of lube again, pouring a liberal amount over the head of his cock and stroking himself to distribute it all over. His eyes rolled back as he did so and he inhaled shakily. Kneeling closer between Dean’s legs, he dribbled a bit more lube around Dean’s rim, teasing it with the head of his cock as he began to press it inside.
“Do what?”
“I did miss my daddy’s knot,” Dean said with another little pout.
“Sorry, it’s just… kind of a lot to hear all at once,” said John. He glanced at Sam. “I’m guessing you knew.”
“What was that?” asked Sam, touching a hand to his ear. “I was…
He did, a cold sweat breaking out on his forehead. The picture on page six… was of Castiel and Meg, looking cozy sitting beside one another at a café, her hand visible on his thigh and Castiel making bedroom eyes. It looked like they were about to kiss. The headline read—
When he’d stopped orgasming, Cas draped him over the teacher’s desk where he went limp, panting for breath. All the strength had gone out of his limbs and he was barely able to keep his eyes open, watching somewhat dazedly as Castiel shrugged out of his blazer and tossed it aside.
serious.”
Sam took his cell and pocketed it. “Yeah. So, I get why you’re protecting him. He’d do the same for you.” He got up off the floor. “But you better hope to hell that you know what you’re doing. I’m calling you a car.”
He’d asked for this. Swallowing thickly, he walked around and got in.
“Dean?” he said, softly, when he was able.
“But he said he wouldn’t,” Sam continued. “He said he really looks up to you and wants to work with you again in the future, so he didn’t want to create any sort of animosity.”
I love Lebanon in the Fall and seeing the leaves change colors, it makes me think about the oncoming Winter and the endless passage of time as the year comes to a close. I also can’t help but think about the upcoming holidays and now I wonder – whom do I want to spend them with? I know the answer I want to give and I suspect you know it, too. And then I remember all that is keeping me back. I still don’t know what to choose, but it means the world to me that you’re there on the other end of this line. It’s almost like you’re holding me, bearing me up when sometimes I want to crumble. I want to know what that feels like.
what kind of ‘plans’ you’re talking about.” The pervy bastard. The sneaky chuckles all but confirmed Dean was right.
With everything in his brain telling him to resist and every instinct urging him to give in, Dean followed his instincts and slowly let himself be drawn into the circle of the alpha’s arms. Because giving in to his instincts had led him down the path he needed to be on, even if it hadn’t been the one he thought he wanted.
As soon as he flipped the sign, the door flew open, making Dean jump back as someone ran in carrying a huge duffel bag. A boy, a young man with floppy blond hair coming down over one eye, looked between them both, settling on Dean.
“Dean,” he moaned. “God, Dean! I’m—I’m inside you.”
“I never thought Naomi would actually do it,” he said, beginning to pace the length of the room. “Do you think it happened in a rut rage? No, the video’s edited too well for that… What did I do to make her release the blackmail? Was it because we took the extra rut days?”
“Ugh,
“Always. We’re in this together. We’ll put an end to this, once and for all. The only thing left is to confront Naomi. And I have an idea on how we should do it.”
“What is the phrase…” he pondered. “Oh, yes. The ‘home office’ can ‘suck it.’”
“Let’s gank this bitch,” said Jack as Azrael. He snapped his fingers.
Breaking through that thought, he realized that the amazing Christmas smell was coming from
“Now,” Colette continued, “I think you should go over to your side of the club and stay there until the Winchesters take their leave.” What a blow; it was the equivalent of being told to stand in the corner. “This was supposed to be a celebration. They shouldn’t have to go just because you made a foolish mistake.”
Dean hoped he wasn’t blushing but he couldn’t hold back a goofy smile. “You do get to meet all kinds of people in a place like this,” he said.
“You are, beloved,” he said, pressing a kiss to his neck. “Even when you’re naughty, you’re still my good boy, aren’t you?”
The blindfold absorbed the tears that fell, but Cas must have heard him sniff because he lifted it a moment later. He cupped Dean’s face, seeing the glassiness of his eyes with some concern in his.
embarrassing, but also turned him on
He turned his head. The other side of the bed was empty. Dean pushed himself up on wobbly arms. “Cas?”
Cas chuckled. “Fair enough.” He paused, stroking Dean’s back up and down. “If I got
“Mmm…” That luscious scent completely surrounded him thanks to the jacket. This was so much better, he could smell the vanilla so well now, rather than the evergreen forest fire the alpha was currently putting out. It distracted him enough to let Cas pull his hands away and fasten his jeans back up around his waist. “Cas… It’s hot…” he complained from under the jacket.
The alpha darted forward and grabbed Dean by the upper arms as if afraid he was going to run. “Don’t joke about that,” he said, the alarm in his scent like a raging evergreen fire.
got Best Drama Series, Zeddmore got Best Director for TV Drama, plus you took the Best Actor… Now you’ll get ‘Emmy Winner’ next to your name on promo materials.”
“Go to sleep, sweet boy. You’ll have a reward in the morning.”
Rami grabbed him by the shoulders. “You should
Since they were familiar with the view, Dean positioned Cas facing the interior of the van. “Ready?” he asked, wrapping his free hand around his waist and tucking his chin over the alpha’s shoulder. “One, two…” He kissed his neck. “Merry Christmas.”
That was… too much. ‘Pull it back, dude,’ he thought.
Azrael nodded and the new remix of
“It isn’t obvious?” asked Cas, the smile on his pink pillowy lips turning wicked, revealing sharp incisors. “I’m an incubus.” The word tickled his brain the way Cas’ breath was tickling his lips, only an inch or so away. “I feed off the sexual energy of humans like you.”
Ramiel was devastated at the loss of Gabriel and cried, flooded with very human-like sorrow. Bast comforted him, knowing what it was like to lose a family member. They went back to Gabriel’s mansion to make certain there was nothing left behind that would point to his celestial origins should anyone else stumble upon it. What they found was an old-school videotape with the words ‘watch me’ written on it, so they watched.
“Don’t you dare touch me,” Cas snapped.
Best regards, AC
“Are you getting on or not?” he asked, finally.
“Do you want me to make you come like this?” Dean whispered.
“Well then.” He cleared his throat. “Yeah, can confirm – you’re not straight.”
“You’ll always have the queen,” Dean pointed out.
“Very funny. I love the mental image of you standing in line at the grocery store to buy that. Do you read the articles or is that asking too much?”
Cas shook his head good-naturedly at the mention of Dean’s cowboy fetish. “I guess it’s still a little surprising to hear this coming from you, even after all this time,” he said, coming to join Dean on the sofa, resting his arm on the back cushion. “You’d only ever dressed in alpha-style clothes until we got serious.”
“Dean,” said Colette, smiling at him brightly in an almost mirror image of her youngest son, “I know you and Castiel met at work, but he always refuses to give any details. Won’t you tell us more about how you came to be in a relationship?”
“No!... ohhh…”
“Are you sure?” asked Bast, but he followed the order nonetheless, stuffing pillows behind Rami’s back.
that. A
. The alpha had well and truly corrupted him.
“I’m getting us home safely,” Dean said, much too innocently for the dirty look in his eyes. Cas growled and Dean just smiled in response. “Enjoy the ride, Alpha.”
He grabbed a pie box off the counter and handed it to Castiel. When he opened it, inside was a blue apron embroidered with ‘Angel Cakes’ and above that – ‘Cas.’
“Yes!”
over the credits. The crew let loose with cheers and applause, some of them singing the lyrics of the theme song, Dean included. Production had set up the studio like a movie theater to celebrate the finale, with fancy catering and an open bar. It was money saved from the season well spent. Cas had even held his hand in the dark, his thumb driving him crazy stroking back and forth.
He watched as Castiel looked up from peeling, curiously. The little tilt of his head just made Dean want to run over and kiss the crook of his neck. He cleared his throat, loudly, and turned his attention back on his work.
“Ah, shaddup,” he said, sitting back down and finishing the rest of his bourbon in one gulp.
“We don’t just have the show and the network’s morality clause to consider, the sponsors are concerned as well.” Webb’s pale blue eyes focused on Dean. “I said, no exceptions.”
“Then get ready for bed. You’ll get your nighttime knot and if you manage not to come, you’ll get a reward in the morning. Come and it’ll be a punishment instead.”
It was even harder to remain on-set when it wasn’t strictly necessary because Castiel had started hanging out with one of the recurring actresses of the season. Her name was Meg Masters and she was playing a reluctant demon ally in Purgatory named Rubicante, acting as a sort of guide for Bast and Rami. She was… nice, Dean supposed. A beta with a pretty, round face, dark eyes, auburn waves, and a petite body, not really Dean’s type. Well, she might have been, once upon a time, but… not anymore. And anytime he heard Castiel’s rumbling laughter because of something she said, the pit in Dean’s stomach deepened. So, he couldn’t really bring himself to like her.
“Say ‘please.’”
“Don’t tell me they have John and Yoko.”
His face flushed and Dean sank back further into the shadows, deciding he should leave before he was spotted. Pausing outside the gym, he looked up at the fluffy clouds crossing the bright Kansas sky. He missed being part of a team, but although the other three guys had been at fault, the one who had escalated things was Dean. And that was why he couldn’t go back to baseball. He didn’t want to cause trouble for other people anymore.
“Hm. I see.” He climbed off of Dean. “Undress for me, please. It’s time we began your punishment.”
It wasn’t long before another response came.
“In that case,
Setting the basket to one side, he waited until Dean joined him on the mattress and smiled as he handed him a tiny white square, keeping one for himself. At Castiel’s prompting, they tore open the wet wipes and swiped away the remaining blockers they’d worn to work.
“I know. It’s just really quiet out here.”
“Dean.”
Right? Right.
“Shut up.”
“Well…” He didn’t really see a way he could gracefully refuse, everyone seemed intent on making him responsible for Novak. “I suppose we could go out then. As long as we don’t make it a late night.”
“Just tracking your behavior. You had your dad, then your boss or your brother, but here, you had no one. It explains your slow decline into violence.”
“I will never get ‘bored of you,’ Dean,” Castiel promised through clenched teeth, clearly trying not to orgasm before the omega. “You could cry and plead with me to let you go and I never would. I’ll ruin you for anyone else. I’ll mate you and your body will only answer to my scent, my touch, you’ll crave
“Someone wanna explain to me what the hell is going on?” said Bast.
The praise combined with the physical pleasure lit him up from the inside, letting him know that he definitely made the right choice. He leaned his head back, moaning, just enjoying it as Cas caressed him with gentle hands. “Surprisingly, yeah,” he said, breathlessly, when he was able. “But I’ve been changing ever since I met you and… I think I like who I’m becoming. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but… we might be kinda perfect for each other.”
“I’m sure that was adequate, but there’s nothing like homemade noodles.”
“I’d do a hell of a lot more than hold your hand if I didn’t know it would completely embarrass you.”
“But they aren’t romantic partners.”
“Hello, Dean,” said Cas, warmly. “Hello, Benny. Garth.”
“Pfft!” Dean smothered his laughter in the alpha’s neck.
“You did so well, beloved,” Cas praised. “What do you want in return for your good behavior? An orgasm?”
“Cas, you always look good.” Hooking a finger into the knot of Castiel’s blue and white striped tie, Dean pulled it loose, dragging it free of his collar. “We good?”
“Hmm,” was all Cas said, after moaning in response. “Dean?”
need to go down that line of thinking and eventually have to explain a random boner away. It was difficult, however, to keep the fantasies at bay. He couldn’t help it - the vivid dreams had come back last night. Now all he could picture was holding Castiel in his arms and murmuring ‘good boy’ while they… STOP IT.
“What the Hell are you waiting for? Exorcise me!”
He licked his lips and the alpha’s gaze narrowed on them. “I… I don’t know,” he said honestly. “I’ve only ever dated beta girls. Nothing serious. I was always too busy for an actual relationship.”
for extra flair.
Sighing, he plugged in the tree and the bulbs lit up white before starting a rainbow-colored light show. It was a little on-the-nose, but still really pretty and would look even better with decorations. Cas was already making the holiday more special simply by being there. Maybe Dean
He couldn’t respond, he could hardly breathe. The moment he fell to his knees, he knew what was wrong, even if his rapidly rising body temperature and racing heartbeat hadn’t clued him in. Sam jerked back, right into John who was trying to see what was happening.
“Shut up, bitch.”
“It is,” he said, warmly, pressing a kiss to his ear. “You don’t have to worry about anything like this happening to you, ever. You are mine alone.”
Dean rolled over and yelled into his pillow. He wanted to go back in time, go to Trickster, and bash himself over the head for being a lying coward. He didn’t care if the universe imploded because he interacted with a past version of himself. If he hadn’t been such a chicken and lied to this beautiful man, he could have had so much more already and he wouldn’t be torturing himself.
If bridges are burned, they will not be burned by me. I am merely making a choice and I will continue to love them as I always have. If my living honestly causes my family to burn the bridge as a result, then I only have one thing to say…
“So much. Though I’ve heard some of the club members are afraid to fight you.”
“So, if I win, you’ll live with me?” His eyes sparkled as he took Dean’s hands in his and squeezed. “I’ll work my hardest!”
Castiel inhaled sharply at that final barb. It hit the mark for sure. Dean squeezed his hand and saw Castiel’s shoulders relax again as he briefly closed his eyes to regain his calm.
“A sparkly jump rope and one of those whirligig dolls where you pull a string and it flies in the air,” Dean answered immediately, knowing what he was asking. “The jump rope I could kind of spin as a real gift, the doll I couldn’t. Once he opened that one, he knew I’d stolen both. I never got caught,” he added, “had a few close calls though, that was scary. I had nightmares about getting sent to jail. I’m sure you’ve heard varying stories about what happens to omegas in lock-up, but I was mostly scared about leaving Sammy on his own. It was hard enough sending him away to college at eighteen, I can’t imagine how I’d feel if PPS had gotten him back then.”
Cas shook his head, sighing. “That’s… There isn’t a word bad enough.” He nuzzled closer, nudging Dean’s jaw with his nose. “I’m just glad you got out of there.”
When Dean pulled back, he held him at arm’s length. “Remember, you’re welcome here anytime. We don’t have to be working a big gig. Hell, you don’t even have to help. Just come by. We’ll miss you, Assbutt.” Cas snorted and Dean wanted to kiss the little wrinkle in his nose. He just wanted to kiss him, period.
Yours, AC
The scent of musky-sweet strawberry and citrus fields wrapped them in their own little world. Pheromones of love and contentment were like golden threads that wove around their hearts, binding them together. Every one of Dean’s senses were alive in that moment and the primal, purely instinctive part of him that society taught them to ignore was singing a primitive song in his heart. Without the fog of heat clouding his mind, he could sense it quite clearly. Each one of his heartbeats was like a bass drum, resonating through him in counterpoint to the rhythm his alpha created with his body. Their base natures drove them on, pushing them higher and higher, until the knot squeezed into him a final time.
bad,” said Dean, somewhat pacified, but he still glared at him. “You should be worshipping the ground I walk on, man. I’ve never gone this far with anyone else!”
“Should I be worried?”
There was a sharp smacking sound as he said it, shocking the hell out of Dean, but the whole conversation happening in the office beyond was pretty shocking. Enough that he continued to eavesdrop. He didn’t think Cas had hit the woman but thought it likely he’d slapped her hand away from him, and Cas wasn’t a violent person… unless it was Dean being threatened. Something had obviously happened between these two in the past and Dean was dying to find out what.
He growled and it earned him a muffled chuckle. Dean held off for another minute, unable to keep himself from rutting against Castiel’s face a little bit, but it just wasn’t enough. He whined, high in the back of his throat.
Dean just shook his head at that and allowed his eyes to drift shut. They were still waiting out the knot and he wished there was a handy bottle of water nearby (he was going to be
“God, I need to take back control.” He looked at Dean with apologetic eyes. “Is that okay?”
“Then he was probably thinking he wished you hadn’t done it, but he knew why you had.” Cas paused, squinting slightly. “Out of curiosity—?”
“One hundred percent, agree,” said Cas. “Getting to be a part of
kind of outlet, don’t you find that your stress gets all pent-up inside? When that happens, the only way you have to let it out is by fighting. But you really shouldn’t be doing that, as I’m sure you’re aware.” His eyes bored into Dean’s. “Doesn’t it leave you feeling unsatisfied and empty?”
“That’s why you’ve been making me say what I want out loud, even from the very beginning,” Dean realized.
Cas hugged him tighter to his chest, purring loudly, grinding his knot inside Dean. “There, my good boy, I’m so proud of you, I know that was hard to say.”
“Have they ever said anything to you at all, Mrs Novak?” Dean asked, significantly.
He wasn’t afraid. He could do this.
There was only one thing he could think of to do. Dean got up and went to shower, got dressed, drank his coffee, and headed out. There was an important errand he had to run before going to the studio.
“It was an honor to work with you, sir,” Cas said, far too formally.
It’s fine.
He followed the direction while Dean set the lube within easy reach, making sure there were plenty of tissues in the box on the nightstand as well. When he turned to Cas again, he grabbed the alpha by the belt loops and pulled him in, backing up to sit on the edge of the bed. He lifted Castiel’s left hand and pressed a kiss to the ring. The red in his eyes deepened and Dean was sure his were turning as well.
“Let me walk you to your car?”
“It’s not silly, beloved,” Cas said, seriously. “Our relationship is about seeing to each other’s needs, not me torturing you for my own pleasure. I don’t want you to feel like you have to ‘deserve’ to use your safeword in any situation. I’m not going to judge you for it.” He squeezed his hand. “I’m certainly not going to abandon you for choosing to use it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The alpha was still panting beneath him, his arms holding him tight. “You almost had it,” he said, a smile in his voice. “You only said half my name.”
He would never be able to come here again without getting red in the face. While Dean slumped on the bench, Cas got to his feet, his massive erection right in Dean’s face. He licked his lips.
“So, I take it Vegas is off the table now?” she asked.
Rami’s eyes flared gold (with more special effects) and he tackled Bast to the bed. A PG-13 sex scene followed, which was interesting for Dean and Cas to film, considering their roles as alpha and omega were reversed.
He scraped the bottom of his Styrofoam bowl, avoiding Castiel’s eyes. “Oh, you know… I was just thinking about a bunch of ‘what ifs.’”
“Beloved, I can tell you need to suckle,” he said, pushing his chair back a little. “Let’s refocus you.”
He laid back against the pillows and drew his knees up slightly. Castiel poured a generous amount in his hand, focusing on his first finger. He took a deep, shaky breath before reaching for Dean with his free hand, lacing their fingers together. Dean nodded, then gasped as Cas touched his rim for the first time. He’d played with himself numerous times, but this was new, and it was
to do. You said that for the first time, you’ve got feelings. Part of that experience is want. So, what do you
“CA-AA-AASSS!” he cried, the sensations so intense that his vision whited out and he slumped down onto the alpha.
He rolled his eyes. “You know what I meant, jerk.”
Turning his head as much as he could to look over his shoulder, Dean said, “I’m sorry… Cas… I’m sorry.”
“Ha, ha, yeah, kinda wish they would!” said Kevin, shaking a leg of the plaid trousers and sticking his thumb under the v-neck of his sweater vest. “I always feel like I’m supposed to go play tennis at a country club or something.”
Clearly swayed by the romance of the notion, he relented. “Alright, then.”
“How sweet,” came a low voice behind them. Kelly squeaked in alarm and fell to her knees, pressing her face to the floor when she saw it was the twins standing there in the shadow of the doorway.
That wouldn’t fly tonight. He was currently wearing a holly-berry red mini-dress with ruffles at the shoulders, hem, and a matching peplum around the waist and shiny red heels. Because it was freezing, he also had a white faux-fur coat, though his legs would suffer until they were inside the hotel. Cas said he looked like a sexy but classy Mrs Claus and had picked out some suitably slutty sheer red underwear with white fur trim to match to go underneath. He was also wearing the jeweled plug again, having only worn the everyday glass plugs since their courtship jewelry presentation. The wide scooped neckline of the dress showed off the way his golden collar lay against his collarbone, and the contrast with the red was gorgeous, the little green stones echoing Dean’s eye color perfectly.
“I know you don’t judge me for it,” said Dean. “But deep down, I knew what I did was wrong. Pushing everyone away because I was too afraid to feel anything real. I never let myself be vulnerable until you dragged it out of me. So, when I think about the past, I feel guilty.”
,” said Gabriel. “But I didn’t
Purring loudly, Cas mounted Dean and bottomed out in one stroke, rasping, “Good! Boy!”
Dear AC,
“I got your back, man.”
“I wouldn’t think so, but you looked comfortable enough. I didn’t want to wake you.”
“Where have you been?” Chuck demanded. He looked between Castiel and Dean and particularly at their joined hands. “What is this?”
“Buddy, you ain’t just whistling Dixie.”
With a roll of his eyes, Sam picked up his shiny new briefcase and headed for the security line. He looked back and lifted a hand. “See ya soon, jerk.”
He did as he was told, letting himself drool all over the cock in his mouth. Dean moaned around his mouthful and Cas touched his shoulder, pinching the base of his dick as he pushed Dean back.
They were just sticking the pies into one of the ovens when Dean’s phone pinged in the pocket of the apron. Wiping off his hands, he checked the screen and grinned at Gabe.
“So… we’re good for each other,” he summed up. “Like a… what do you call it? Like when bees pollinate while collecting food.”
Dean nodded, put his phone on silent, then stuck it into the pocket of his bathrobe. “Yeah. He’s gonna Google you, for sure, but the conversation went really well. Way better than I’d hoped.”
. Like
Dean squeezed his hand. “Then, I’ll just do my best to ensure you stay relaxed,” he said, smiling. “Don’t worry. I’ll be trained so well by then; I won’t even react.”
“My business is
Sam nodded. “I gave him my card so I can thank him later. He really went above and beyond. I mean, you’re not a small guy and he said bringing you in was no big deal.”
“I don’t need a shrink,” said Dean, glaring.
. Dean wailed as he came, every nerve ending in his body alight. He laid there against Castiel’s pillows breathing hard, his eyes going wide as he watched Cas swallow every bit of it down. “You… didn’t need to do that,” he said, blushing.
“Yes, daddy.”
“Just let me clean up a bit and we’ll go.”
Despite the respect the two alphas had for one another, they worried about triggering protective instincts in one another around Dean. Although Sam recognized Cas as the older, more dominant alpha and Dean’s mate, he was naturally still very attached to his brother. Seeing Cas administer a punishment could make him react in discomfort at the very least, or burst out in violence at the worst. And two alphas in a stand-off could get dangerous.
Bast shook out his hands and legs as if getting rid of any nerves. “As I’ll ever be. Let’s do this, Rami.”
“Are you kidding? How many times have I been touched by those hands?”
“If you’re this energetic after having your essence absorbed, you should be fine.”
Dear AC,
“What?” Cas lifted his head, honestly confused, and Dean couldn’t blame him, the question was so out-of-the-blue compared to what they’d been discussing.
going to cry, damn it. “Fuck,” he muttered.
They didn’t speak directly again until Dean couldn’t find his script one afternoon. He’d left it on a table near craft services but when he came back to retrieve it, the table was full of samples from the film sponsor. His black binder was gone.
He pushed his pelvis against Dean’s, grinding into him… Castiel was decidedly
, every part of him belonged to his daddy and Dean loved him with every fiber of his being. “Mmm…”
The lack of argument was telling. Castiel pointed down the hallway. It was a lot like how Dean had imagined it, with prints of famous paintings featuring nature and photographs of people he assumed to be siblings. The bedroom was small and dark with the curtains drawn, the bed unmade and rumpled. Dean helped ease Castiel back into it and tucked the covers up around his waist before propping some pillows behind him so he could sit up more easily. As he settled back, Castiel immediately closed his eyes with a sigh. That kind of trust was humbling.
Cas helped Dean pick out apples and mangos and all kinds of fruit, squeezing and sniffing to test for ripeness. It was kind of amazing, like they’d been doing this for years. Together, they chose bunches of spinach and artichokes, smelled handmade soaps, and sampled local honey. Watching Castiel lick it off his fingers was a special kind of torture. Cas also chose some fresh lemons, limes, and raspberries to make a fresh Sweet Punishment pie for later that afternoon. Dean’s stomach tied itself in another knot.
He blinked. That wasn’t exactly the answer he’d been expecting, though he did think it would be somewhere public. It would still be challenging, even if he wasn’t going to be acting as Castiel’s mate, because Dean never let anyone buy him anything. It always felt too much like a handout and his father had always taught him to stand on his own two feet. Slowly, he nodded. “And if it’s too much at any time, I can call ‘red,’” he said, without asking it like a question.
of feathers, Cas materialized in the booth with him, gloriously naked and eyes glowing. With his wings, there was barely room for both of them and he was already crowding in on Dean. He wagged his finger at Dean like he was a naughty boy and winked as if daring him to try and say what was happening to the man in the next booth.
apologetic and embarrassed by you. Humiliated, really—”
I’m grateful to be busy, too busy to freak out about Sunday. I am still worried underneath my lengthy to-do list that keeps running through my head. I don’t want you to regret anything. Some bridges can’t be rebuilt once burned. I hope our meeting will give us both clarity on how to proceed.
“Hey,” Dean said, “I know what you’re thinking, but you’re not like them.”
“He’s only doing it to be polite. Luce is co-hosting.”
“Castiel,” said Chuck, sharply. “We are
Dear AC,
Heart pounding in his throat, Dean did his best to casually walk into Trickster and not look like a robot, stiffly moving his arms and legs. He had the bag with his loaf of bread tucked under one arm like a football. Walking past Castiel’s table, he pretended to look around the café area. When his eyes landed on Castiel he startled, hoping he wasn’t being too theatrical.

“So, we had to get undressed and by the time I got the clothes in the wash, you were passed out. I moved you in here so you’d be more comfortable.” He turned his phone back around to face him and smiled down at it. “You’re so pretty when you’re asleep… I had to take a picture.”

made-for-TV movie called
The network was giddy to have the number one and number two ‘sexiest men’ on the same show together. They said it was an even better marketing line than having a father-son team. Honestly, it was kind of humiliating, losing the number one spot after a two-year streak to such a newbie. But audiences were fickle and besides, if Dean continued to claim the top spot, surely people would start to think the list was rigged. At least, those were a few of the things Dean told himself in order to feel better about it. He couldn’t help being at least a
“Here’s what’s going to happen,” he said, handing Dean his glass and lifting his own. “We’re going to drink a toast. You’re going to finish your whiskey. Once you are done, you’re going to put your glass back on the table to let me know you are ready to begin your punishment. Then, you’re going to get up and lie down over my lap and no matter what happens, you’re going to keep your hands flat on the floor. You will then be punished however I see fit until our meal arrives, am I understood?”
. Not… like
“As a thank you,” he said, holding it out. “Things like this are best enjoyed fresh. I can always make another one.”
Rather than spring it on him, Dean pulled his hands out of his pockets and held out his arms, letting Castiel choose whether or not he wanted a hug. With a little smile on his face, he came into the frame of Dean’s arms and held him tight, patting him firmly a few times and letting his hand linger after the last one. Castiel sighed before letting go and Dean repressed a shiver as it ghosted across the nape of his neck. Goosebumps chased each other up and down his spine.
“God, Sam, do I need to draw you a diagram?” Dean spat, hurting too much to give a softer answer. “I’m giving birth!”
“I don’t mind.”
“It was Christmas morning and on Christmas morning the rule was pie for breakfast. Mom always made the most amazing pecan pie. To this day it’s still my favorite. I remember sitting there in front of the tree that my dad and uncles had cut down together with a minimum of cursing because it was Jesus’ G-damn birthday and not in front of the kids, Bobby, they’ll have too creative a vocabulary at school.”
“I never thought you would give me a chance,” Castiel went on as if he hadn’t heard him. Maybe he hadn’t, he sounded pretty scent-drunk. “I don’t even know where to start, it’s like I’m dreaming. There’s so much I want to do to you.”
He chuckled down at the peaches. “Pieman said something similar once, about how pies are more complex than cake.”
“It’s the truth,” Rami insisted. “Your heart is the strongest weapon you have and I don’t think you even realize it. You fought that demonic corruption all the way into the bowels of Hell and managed to retain your humanity for the entire duration. Honestly, I didn’t think you would. Clearly, humans are a lot stronger than I ever gave them credit for.”
The Mother In Law’s voice was heard following him in the direction of the parish hall. “If you could just wait a few moments, she wants to get out of her dress so no one sees it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Focusing on the needs of his alpha helped him to begin to drift. He couldn’t fall all the way into sub-space, not when he needed to be such an active participant at the moment, but he fell into it enough to mostly forget where they were and who was watching. That wasn’t important. His alpha was. His daddy. The more he thought about that, the more his embarrassment slid away, leaving him comfortable in his submission once again.
She winced. “
“All of that and more.” Castiel made a fist near his gut. “But inside. They had magic. And that’s worth more than any external attributes.”
“Crazy as it sounds, considering what I was like at the time… maybe I would have,” Dean admitted. “I was dancing for you, showing off because I saw that you were there. I think a part of me knew. Even then.”
time for this.”
“I would have yelled for you to let yourself in, if that were the case.” They both knew you didn’t leave milk unattended, that was just asking for trouble and a big mess to clean up.
social media manager, is an ex-hacker. She traced the IP address and bam, cops kicked down Becky’s door.”
“I can’t do this by myself,” said Dean.
“Please.” His voice was shaking. “I want this.”
“Now?”
Castiel took a step closer. Then another, making Dean step back, hitting the wall. Castiel’s hands went up on either side of his head, caging him in as he leaned close.
The second half of the season opened with a humorous scene of Bast helping Rami to pick out pregnancy pants to accommodate his growing belly and there was a lot of cuddling and scenting happening on-screen now. The girl helping them at the store, an obvious stand-in for their real audience though she didn’t have any lines, was so clearly charmed to see such a loving pair. This was immediately followed by a highly contrasting and epic ‘battle couple’ scene of them taking out a nest of vampires, with Rami being extremely capable and disposing of them with ease despite his pregnant state. And it was kind of hot, though it obviously jangled Bast’s nerves to see Rami fighting.
I can’t picture you angry. But I very much want to picture you in and out of pajamas.
Despite his very thorough cleaning job and Cas making sex-noises during the scalp massage, things stayed fairly calm through their joint shower. Neither one of them had the energy to escalate things again, though their dicks perked up a little at the necessary contact. It was nearing midnight when they finally crawled into bed, practically collapsing on each other.
“I see the way you’ve been ogling me in class whenever you think I’m not looking,” the alpha continued, frowning down at him. “To think, an honor student like you would allow yourself to become so distracted.”
“Of course,” said Cas, smiling. “I have something else for you, too.”
“If you wanted to forget that bad, then maybe it was what you needed, at least for the moment,” said Dean.
“You don’t like kneeling?” he asked, curiously.
“No one saw. But it was really difficult to hide my erection.”
“Hey, Novak,” said the student he’d just been sparring with, as Castiel removed the fencing mask he’d been wearing during his bout. His sweaty hair curled around his ears and the back of his neck and,
, Sam. I’m begging, I am
Dear Pieman,
, that shouldn’t be so sexy. “Are you alright? Your strikes didn’t have as much strength as they usually do.”
“Mrs Novak,” said Sam, “would you like to dance?”
Dean was so taken in by those eyes that he almost didn’t give the next line, “W-we’ve talked about this—”
Getting back to his feet, Cas nodded, continuing to rub the omega’s stomach with gentle hands, seeking more movement. “But if you don’t feel anything in a few days, we’re going to see Akobel. Just to make sure things are going as they should.”
Which brought them to the present and Dean’s nervous leg-bouncing. What he
“It is,” said Dr Rowena, peeping her head up above the sheet. “It’s all good news, boys. You’ve got two lovely little pups. A bit underweight, as expected, but not too much. They might have a little trouble regulating their temperature, but as long as they’re kept nice and snug, they shouldn’t have a problem.” She tilted her head at Cas. “Did dad want to cut the cords before we hand them over?”
“Mmm. I like that even better.”
bearer.” They thought asking Sam to carry the lock had a nice symmetry to it.
If his scent wasn’t blocked, Dean was sure his displeasure would have been announced to all those in a five-foot radius. Every scrap of goodwill he’d felt toward Luce as a co-host of the evening evaporated in an instant. “Dick.”
“I hope I
“Not even here for Winter break yet and they’re planning for Spring.” Cas shook his head fondly.
He shook his head. “What scares me is I might be ruining a good thing. A great thing. Maybe the best thing to ever happen to me by making it real. Because it has the potential to be an even
“A chance to what?”
“I doubt your brother ever asked for this kind of cake for his birthday,” said Castiel.
“Wow, you’re pretty damn assertive for an omega,” said Meg, unable to resist.
“I kinda thought I’d have to buy you dinner first.”
that we should have someone to help us. I guess having a last-minute event to cater made him cave.”
I finally fell asleep after getting my loaf out of the oven early this morning. The sun was just starting to rise and the sky was all pink. Now I have hours to go before we meet and, in the hours when I slept, I had a vivid dream about you. I’m hoping it’s a sign. A good one.
It was in the dark, so I couldn’t see you. Just feel.
“Really?”
Castiel’s eyes flared with red. “Yes, you are.” He took his own drink from the cup while holding eye contact and licked his lips.
“You’re just going to
Dean didn’t dare to look at his phone again for a couple of days, then he had to turn it back on in case Sam needed to contact him from the Farmer’s Market. Right away, he saw he had a message on the Bakers Dozen app and guilt crashed down on top of him like a ton of bricks.
He leaned in, his smile lingering on his lips as he sweetly pressed them against his alpha’s. “I love my daddy,” he whispered.
“We both have a job to do,” he said, glaring at the wall. “So, get changed and get to it. We’ll continue this later when I’ve sufficiently calmed down.” He looked back to where Dean was standing, just outside the bathroom, pinning him with eyes that were still a bit red. “You will wait for me here when you’re done shooting today.”
Dean got up and started his coffee then sat down at his kitchen table with his phone. The first link Sam had sent was from a news outlet declaring the tabloid had spread misinformation. There were pictures of Cas and Meg at the café, but from a different angle than the original, showing other members of the crew sitting there with them. The link had been retweeted by the
“I could ask you the same question,” he said in a rough voice. “Making that kind of face to the man you dumped.”
“Yes.”
“God, I love you.” Pulling Dean close with his back to Castiel’s chest, the alpha mouthed at his mating gland, licking and sucking his mark into it. “You have no idea how much I want to just bite down right now,” he said, breathing hot and hard against the omega’s neck. “You’re so damn beautiful, beloved, and I
“Dean. Lean down and kiss me, I’m too tired to stretch up.”
Cas winced but nodded. “I thought so. Your timing was too good.” He ducked his head. “I’m so sorry, Dean—”
“Context!” said Meg, grinning.
The alpha laughed harder and it kind of took Dean’s breath away. Those gorgeous blue eyes of his sparkled and his wide smile revealed shiny, even, white teeth. It made Dean wonder what his unblocked smell might be, what his joy smelled like.
“B-but I’m due on set soon! I need to get changed and get to makeup!”
“The human and the heavenly.”
You’ve made me do something I’ve never done before. I have now prayed to a loaf of bread. That is something I’ve done now in case anybody brings it up during a game of “I’ve Never.” I will now have to take a shot if anyone says “I’ve never prayed to baked goods.” Is there anything else you would recommend I do while I’m at it? Blood sacrifice, maybe?
Dean recognized that someone with Castiel’s upbringing would likely feel shame over any ‘inappropriate’ arousal. It was common among baby gays because even in this modern era heterosexual relationships were still depicted as the norm and homosexual ones were only whispered about, or at best, mentioned in passing. He hated the thought of Castiel giving in to his urges and then shaming himself over it afterward.
“True,” said Dean, “but it wouldn’t have been the same if it had been anyone other than Cas in the role.”
They passed Sam in the hallway, who was busy texting on his phone. Dean tried to grasp at his sleeve, but Castiel just kept pulling him onward.
“Look at me,” said Cas.
She handed him a ring with a modestly sized but still very sparkly round stone the exact color of Castiel’s eyes – a deep lake-blue that had just a touch of transparency so hidden depths were revealed depending on how the light hit it. The band was a matte silver, but had a thin ring of shiny gold around the middle. Many courtship items featured gold to represent the omega and he liked the subtlety of it here. The ring’s overall beauty left him speechless. As soon as it was in his hand, Dean knew that it was the one.
,” he said, breaking free from a startled Castiel and snatching the bag off the desk. “Gimme the damn thing. You’re so annoying!”
Dazedly, he felt Cas lapping at the bite wound and he found the brainpower to return the favor, knowing that it would solidify their blood bond and help the skin to heal. By morning, their scents would merge and advertise to the world that they were a mated pair, as long as they weren’t wearing blockers. Just thinking about it made Dean’s stomach swoop. They were both exhausted, sticky, and covered in sweat that caught the cold air, but Dean absolutely did not—could not—give a flying fuck. His happiness was too complete.
make cake,” said Dean, hands on his hips. “Besides, this was a special circumstance. Did everything come together here?”
“Oh, I don’t think we should interrupt…”
His eyes narrowed in on the alpha’s shoulder, being that it was pretty much right in front of his face. Four half-moon shapes were prominent against his skin. Anxious, Dean sat up, the action making his channel clench and they both couldn’t help a little moan. There were four matching marks on the opposite shoulder.
“That’s quite a talent, you know,” said Cas. “You fall into sub-space so easily, and now we have a way for you to do it on command. I’ve never witnessed such a thing, ever, not even among my family’s omegas.”
When it passed, Cas said, “I need to go talk to the nurses, beloved. I don’t want to leave you, but it shouldn’t take me very long. I promise I will be right back.”
Cas winked at him. “I have an inside man.”
“Beautiful,” Dean whispered, unable to hold it back. It was like seeing the aurora borealis, shifting color across the night sky.
“Even when you haven’t met?”
“I’ve always thought so, too. I just… never said it out loud. It’s a little terrifying to think about, living my life without limits. I’m not sure I’ll know what to do with so much freedom.”
“So happy,” he answered, looking up at Cas with shining eyes.
“It’s like a stock portfolio. Diversifying is smart. If we
“Tough.” Dean pushed back against Castiel’s chest, giving himself some space. Castiel barely moved, as if Ramiel was only moving because he allowed it to happen. “You want me, I want some kind of security, someone that has my back. It’s that or no deal.”
“Thanks,” Adam said, shaking Dean’s hand and coming in slightly to pat him on the back. It showed a lot of trust on his part and Dean smiled warmly. “Its taken some getting used to.”
“So, I should be careful, eh, Winchester?” Crowley said from somewhere above him. A hand touched his head, fingers trailing through his hair. “I think you’re the one who ought to be more careful. It’s not smart to provoke an alpha. Especially one who’s seen that blushing face of yours.” Dean’s shirt was slowly worked up his back and over his head. “Even someone like me might not be able to resist.”
He leaned over Dean, pinning him yet again, and brought his face in close with the clear intent to kiss him.
“Are you feeling better? How’s your stomach?”
perfect.”
“So, you had your dad, then your boss and your brother. And is this the first time you’ve been away from home for an extended period?”
“I’m not panicking!”
“That’s not what I meant.”
I could tell you where I live
you.”
Dean’s hands shook and the listing blurred as his eyes filled with tears. A home. A
“Check it out,” said Dean, leaning over on the bench seat to show Cas his phone screen. “Gabe got Sam to go up on stage at Magic Mike.” The caption below said ‘He wouldn’t let me go up and I said SOMEBODY was gonna do it! #myalpharocks!’
He whined, high in his throat, something else he never did, but despair welled heavily in his gut, demanding an outlet. He was a terrible omega, how could he do such a thing to his alpha? Castiel would reject him now, he was sure of it. And Dean would deserve it too, after behaving like a wild beast.
True to her word, once the turkey was bagged to seal in the moisture as it cooked along with herbs and a full block of butter and slid into the oven, Naomi asked Sam to join her in the study. Gabriel wanted to listen at the door, of course, but Dean managed to get him to settle for waiting down the hallway.
“Ah, have you come back?” asked Cas, somewhat hoarsely. “You fell under so suddenly, I was worried. Does that mean I met your needs?”
“Yeah.” Dean had been very surprised when his daddy had suggested it. Most alphas wouldn’t ever want to be associated with the term ‘house-husband,’ but Cas had almost seemed offended by the idea of a nanny or daycare. Dean suspected he would change his mind about having help, however, once there were more pups running underfoot. “He sends me pictures all day. Want to see?”
“Mmm, you smell like Christmas,” he whispered, a little scent-drunk, kissing his way down to where his neck met his shoulder. His channel clenched around Castiel’s growing knot as he licked over his mating gland, surprised at how strong the urge to bite down was.
“N-no.” Dean froze, eyeing Nick warily. No one else had mentioned Dean being different.
“I would have to inject some of my energy into you and block it from the inside.”
Still pumping, still thrusting, Cas leaned over Dean’s chest. Dean reached around the demon’s shoulders and grabbed the base of his wings, clawing outward with his fingers, hard, but not rough enough to pull any feathers. Cas cried out and his hand tightened on Dean, ensuring that they were both coming – Cas deep inside Dean, and Dean all over Cas’ front – explosively and repeatedly, shouting their ecstasy to the sky.
I have some thinking to do. But don’t stop writing to me.
They turned the corner and almost ran right into someone in the middle of the sidewalk holding a tray. Reflexively, Dean grabbed it, helping to keep it and its contents from going flying.
He smiled, looking at Dean like he was his whole world. “Wonderful.” Helping Dean to his feet, he pulled the cold, damp panties back up. The head of his still-hard cock poked out of the waistband, the tiny bow making it look like it was wearing a bowtie. Since they hadn’t made a mess, Cas just sprayed the room down with disinfectant and scent neutralizers as he spoke. “We have one more stop to make before we eat and I believe we should have just enough time before the reservation I made, which is why I sadly couldn’t give you my knot right now.”
“Mm. I guess that could be appealing to the right person, but Sam wouldn’t enjoy it.”
Dear Pieman,
The pleading note was impossible to refuse. “Sad,” Dean said, finally.
“Cas,” he said, frowning, as he squeezed Castiel’s hand. “Have a little faith in me.”
“Oh.” A further drop in tone. She looked between the two of them, uncertain, notably glancing at Dean’s large, round abdomen. “Are… you sure you want to see him right now?”
After his first mouthful, Castiel wilted, sinking back into his pillows on a satisfied moan. “That’s
A finger on the opposite side of his jaw turned his face back to Castiel who was looking at him with those blue eyes that saw all the way inside him. “You know that your past doesn’t matter to me, don’t you?”
Azrael joined hands with Rami and Bast. “There’s somewhere we need to be.”
“Don’t you think we should shower before the shop closes and Sam comes upstairs?”
Same. I want you and I need you, very much.
Sighing, he put his phone down and buried his face in his hands. What did he want to do now? Castiel had even revealed that they’d wanted to live together, and in such a way that the network shouldn’t have any problem with their image. He’d managed to protect them both.
Dean immediately looked up to see Sam coming out of the walk-in, about to open his mouth… but for once in his life, he seemed to think better of it. Instead, he looked at Castiel’s back then again at Dean. When Dean didn’t react, he repeated it, exaggerating the movement of his head. The message was clear: ‘Dude, TALK to him!’
“Yes.” He kissed Dean softly. “You’re stuck with me, too.”
is the guy who’s gonna fight me for Favorite Uncle?” he asked Dean and Cas.
Only… what the hell did Dean actually want?
Castiel nodded, his gaze shining with sincerity. “Even though it was the first time I’d laid eyes on you, I had this certain feeling of… nostalgia, as odd as that sounds. You just drew me right in.” He squeezed Dean’s bicep. “Your build. Those beautiful green eyes that looked like they could pierce right through me. You made my heart go crazy.”
Turned out, it was extremely difficult to finger-fuck his own ass and give a blow job at the same time because his mouth kept wanting to close on instinct from the anal pressure and that was the opposite of what needed to happen. Embarrassing noises were beginning to come through his nose as the sensations started to get to him. Dean had wanted to remain somewhat stoic through this, but his body was totally betraying him.
“You’re disappointed.”
After a second or two of silent appraisal during which Novak’s expression gave off nothing but somewhat enigmatic friendliness, Dean smiled, calm and cool. “Nice to meet you, too, Mr Novak. I’m happy to be starring in your debut. Let’s make it a good one, huh?”
“I…” Shaking, and not from the cold water, Dean began to fold in on himself. “I… I don’t… know…”
“It’s still delicious,” said Cas with his mouth full.
Around mid-day, his reply came through –
“W-what are you doing?” Dean asked, trying to keep his voice steady and only marginally succeeding, reminded suddenly of the film shoot and the incident with the water barrel. The first time they’d scented each other. But he was wearing scent blockers now, so Castiel didn’t have that excuse to use.
“But,” Dean looked back at Cas in confusion, “isn’t Luce an alpha, too?”
“What kind of ‘fun’?” he asked, suspicious again.
“I never said there wouldn’t be side benefits,” said Cas, the pervy bastard. “Also, there’s ointment for any other bites or scratches to ensure fast healing, in case they happen somewhere visible. Some energy drinks in case I got worn out, but since I’m going into rut, I don’t think I’ll be needing them.” He squirmed. “Um… there’s a mouth guard for me, in case you felt the collar was too much.”
“Okay, okay,” he soothed, still capable of so much gentleness even as he growled with every word, “it’s yours, beloved, it’s all yours. Hold me tight.”
“Oh!” The man looked up with tired eyes, dark circles underneath, but they were still so beautiful. Bluer than the ocean on a postcard. It took Dean a moment to register the messy dark hair and then the white uniform he had on. “Thank you. Sorry. I didn’t see you.”
pouting about it.
“You’re telling me.”
“I never took a human vessel for Jedediah. It was never necessary; we always spoke through dreams. The only other time it happened was when I appeared to Samuel in order to inspire him to create the gun you now hold.” Castiel glanced down at himself as if just noticing what he looked like. “The body was different then.”
“I don’t want to fight you, Jedediah; I want to
“I’ll never stop. I could live and die here and be happy.”
Still yours, AC
“Well, in one way, for sure,” said Dean. “He didn’t take advantage of me.”
Crowley attacked with even more vigor in the next take. Dean grinned. Perhaps he’d struck a nerve.
Some people stop liking me once they hear I’m bisexual.
“Are you seriously asking me that?”
Does your dad not let you visit your mom? That’s messed up.
Letting go, he picked up the gold box and opened it. Dean gasped at the sight of the gold lock nestled in satin, it had a beautiful emerald about the size of his thumbnail surrounded by little diamonds. The octagonal design seemed kind of art deco in nature. It was stunning.
“I appreciate that.”
As that thought fluttered away to be recalled later, he was certain of two things. One, he was going to pass out, and soon. And two… He’d never heard anything so beautiful as the wrecked voice of his alpha, crying his name through clenched teeth as he came. Dean tried to call out to his daddy, but wasn’t sure if it actually made it past his lips before darkness claimed him, dragging him under to a place where neither pain nor bliss could touch him.
“Why?” asked Cas, still smiling.
“I suppose the thing that enthralls me the most… is how real the dreams seem,” he said, a bit hesitantly. “We’re not in a castle or the beach or anything like that, I’m in my apartment. I’m standing in my bedroom.”
“Okay,” he said, shutting off the engine. “Stay here for just a second while I set things up. Keep your eyes closed and I’ll come get you.”
It didn’t add up. He’d thought for sure that the alpha would want to have his own climax once Dean’s punishment was complete. Unless he just wasn’t interested in being physical himself? That opened up new questions. Was he asexual? Was he actually straight and only using sex to manipulate Dean’s behavior? He didn’t know and he had no idea how to ask. He couldn’t just
“That’s not always true,” Castiel countered. “Following rules can sometimes be quite… pleasurable.”
Re: Sorry
The rest of the season involved Rami teleporting them all over the place, trying to catch and stop Lilith. The problem being, with hundreds of possible seals to choose from, it was pretty much impossible to be pre-emptive about it. They had to wait until she struck, hope that an agent of Heaven would see it, then Ramiel would be alerted, he would teleport Bast and himself there, and
Slowly, he got up behind Dean, giving him plenty of time to say no, that he didn’t want to be mounted like some needy omega bitch, but he was silent aside from his heavy breathing. Castiel thrust inside him hard, his hands at Dean’s slender waist, pulling him back to meet him each time. Their bodies slammed together and Dean had to grab onto the edges of the mattress in order to keep from moving upward on the bed.
The next day, Dean lurked underneath the bleachers in the gymnasium while Castiel attended his fencing class. The alpha had told him not to worry, but he couldn’t help it. Watching Castiel handle the blunted sword worried him, Dean didn’t think the alpha should be doing physical things like nothing had happened to his hand. The protective omega in him demanded that he stay nearby in case he was needed, even though he knew it was silly. He hid and watched him from the shadows, undeterred.
. Who put a ring on your finger?”
“You said you could handle it!”
“When we mate,” Dean said, hesitantly, looking away as his face heated up, “when we’re ready to go public… then you can mark me permanently. Until then… just do it somewhere it can’t be seen, otherwise, it could interfere with work—Ah!” He was cut off on a squawk as Castiel suddenly dove down, flinging Dean’s legs in the air. “What—what are you—” He moaned as hot, open-mouthed kisses were pressed to the insides of his thighs.
“That’s understandable. I’m willing to continue slowly, to see if this is something you really want.”
He nodded.
The alpha’s brows lifted. “No, it isn’t,” he said, but there was a question there, too.
man.”
“Beloved.” His voice was firm. Pushing back on Dean’s shoulders, Cas held him so that they could see each other’s eyes. “When I say something is my fault, it is not for you to take the blame away from me, do you understand?”
“Leave Dean out of this,” Cas growled, casting out his arm to bar entry.
Trembling, Dean sucked in a shuddering breath. Maybe his mind had just been fogged from all the arousal, but he finally realized what Cas actually wanted him to say. “Y-you know what I n-need, daddy. I t-trust you to give it to me.”
There was no way Dean could ever forget this, having something so large brutally breaching his body, even if he was biologically designed to accommodate it. Already, his nerve endings were singing with pleasure, his thighs streaked with slick, as Castiel moved faster and faster.
He hesitated. “What did you decide, Dean?”
Dear AC,
He must have used his pull as a dorm leader to find out what Dean was studying because he’d purposely kept it quiet that he was working on getting his certification in pup development. It was such a stereotypical omega field, and he hated being stuck in that box, but he’d practically raised Sam by himself after the death of their mother and he’d loved every moment of it. Working with pups as his career would be like a dream. But Dean remained silent because he didn’t want to admit that the bastard had a point. An expulsion could mean that he might have to start his two years all over again if the credits he’d completed weren’t eligible for transfer, and that was
Cas tilted his head, accepting that. “It’s more of a tart than a pie, in my opinion.”
to rehearse with the actual person he was doing the scene with, but that was yet another thing Crowley had skipped out on.
“Objectively. He… reminds me of someone we met recently.”
He looked at his left hand. Just the sight of his matching gold ring had him beaming. “I don’t really want to take it off,” he said. “Plus, it’s pretty dark in here. What does it say?”
“I’m sure.”
“Then of course we’ll drive,” said Cas, reassuringly. Dean breathed a sigh of relief. “I’ll always put your needs first, beloved. I hope you’ll always tell me what you need if I don’t know. I’m not psychic. I won’t punish you for informing me.”
“Fuck,” he whispered, cradling Dean’s cheeks before sliding his fingers back through his hair. “God, you’re so gorgeous.”
Re: Fall
“Bad.” That was saying something, considering the kinky stuff they got up to themselves. Something in Dean’s expression must have given him away, because Cas confirmed, “It’s not like what we’ve done.” He covered his eyes with the hand not holding onto Dean. It was shaking. “You’d never respect me again if you saw.”
Nothing. It was nothing. It had just... been a while since he’d last been on a date, he was sure. And he’d been too tired to masturbate lately. That had to be it.
Dean stood in the circle of his arms stiffly, feeling like he didn’t deserve the comfort Cas was offering. “I broke the rules,” he said, dully.
“You don’t think I should wear the bite-block?” he asked, brows furrowed together.
Chuck laid down the papers. “What do you want me to do?”
This time, that massive cock slid right in, which really wasn’t a surprise given how sloppy-wet he was. Dean moaned, stretching his neck, which Castiel took as an invitation to scent and kiss along the whole length from shoulder to ear, all while snapping his hips sharply, then withdrawing slowly only to return just as hard. Dean had to put a hand above his head to brace against the headboard.
To be honest, I didn’t know what to sign at the bottom of these messages before. Sincerely? Best wishes? Your friend? Plus, I felt a little silly signing something as ‘Pieman.’ But when I knew how I felt, I knew what to write. There was only one thing that made sense.
Dean repressed a derisive snort at Chuck’s definition of ‘tolerance.’
“A cow?”
wish for something like that!”
“Please, daddy,” he begged. “Please fuck me!”
enough that neither of them went into pining, their inner wolves wondering where the hell their mate was when they desperately needed them, but it had still been quite a shock after so many weeks where they’d ended up spending almost all their spare time at each other’s apartments and generally fucking like rabbits.
Cas wasn’t able to refuse a second time, or maybe he just couldn’t think of a good excuse. They were silent in the car, so much so that Dean eventually had to turn on the radio for some noise. He was able to coax Castiel up to his apartment once they got there but the alpha hovered in the doorway, nervously shifting his weight and glancing back toward the elevator while Dean got out of his coat and hung it up. With a double-take, something caught the alpha’s eye, distracting him momentarily.
They each ran into the store and headed for what they needed. Dean also went and grabbed a carton of egg whites so they wouldn’t have to waste time separating eggs. Going through the self-checkout ensured they were in and out in a matter of minutes and back on the road to The Piehole.
“Not pie?”
Right before the mid-season hiatus and following the RamBast canonization, Bast and Ramiel were trying to figure out what to do about getting Death’s ring when a knock at their motel room door revealed a very unexpected guest. Standing there was a shorter man with curling gold hair and matching eyes that twinkled with mischief. He was wearing a t-shirt under his jacket that read ‘Thou Shalt Tap This.’
“Make sure you wash that thing before you want me to wear it again,” he said. He had standards.
“But how?” Dean asked again. “You didn’t go to Plucky Pennywhistle’s!”
still meeting, right?
He headed for the studio. Predictably, it was hell. Good thing the characters were in purgatory and pretty miserable because Dean couldn’t force a happy face. When he’d finished the green-screen work that had been hastily prepared for the day, he went to go practice the fight choreography with the actor playing another knight of Hell: the head torturer, Alastair. Dean attacked each time like the cameras were rolling, putting everything he had into it. The choreographer praised Dean for his enthusiasm but warned that they were just rehearsing.
“Uh, yeah,” said Dean. Keeping his eyes on his beer bottle, focusing on the torn edge of the label, he took a deep breath. “I’ve, um, this isn’t like, public or anything yet, but… I’ve been seeing someone.”
That was why it had to be a Nephilim. Azrael turned to face his parents, needing their guidance. Bast was at a loss. Surely, they couldn’t leave this teenage-infant in charge of the freaking universe! But how could they say no to a nigh-omniscient primordial cosmic deity?
“That would defeat the purpose of you visiting,” said Cas.
Castiel smiled a little. “It’s fine, but I appreciate your apology, unnecessary though it is.”
Slapping the other cheek, Cas scolded him again, “Brat.” Then he chuckled. “Ooh. I think you liked that. You squeeze me when I spank you. Is this something we should pursue in the future?”
He chuckled. “I know, he sends a lot so that I don’t feel like I’m missing anything.” His smile fell. “Except it makes me feel like I’m missing everything. What if I’m at work when they take their first steps? Say their first words? I’m going to miss all the firsts!”
“Fine.” From his pocket, he withdrew the strip of condom packets he’d taken from the glovebox and set them on the side table by the bed. Then Cas turned to look at him, crossing his arms. “Strip.”
“I’ll take that as a yes.”
“Well, obviously not, if those judgmental asses got my white strawberries! What the hell! They aren’t even a pie place!”
That got Dean’s attention. Opening his eyes a crack, he pushed himself up. There were carpet indentations on his cheek. “Wha?” He looked around. “Where am I?”
“I was thinking more along the lines of a maiden sighing in a tower.”
“Don’t go in, just look through the window. Tell me if you see someone with a pie.”
Cas drew him back down into his arms, putting out soothing pheromones as he wrapped a protective hand around Dean’s belly. “No, beloved. Michael and Lucifer are overseas and will remain there for the time being. It’s part of their penance, but also, I believe mother has developed some protective feelings for Kelly and Adam. They’re still mated and that will need to be addressed at some point, but she doesn’t want them exposed to my brothers until their therapy has progressed further.”
idea,” said Gabe, emphatically.
Dean thought about it for a moment. “Like reading a book in a Spring garden. Paper, sun-warmed leather, and green growing things, but more on the clean, fresh-scented side rather than floral.”
“Damn, that’s unfair.”
“The summer before my two oldest brothers would go away to university, we had one last big camping trip to the mountains. Michael and Luce, they of course acted like they were too old and important to be coming along, but once we were away from any prying eyes, it was like they were just our big brothers again, laughing and joking with the rest of us. Our scent takes me back to our last night on the mountain, singing around the campfire, and stuffing ourselves silly with roasted marshmallows and mother’s homemade cookies. It’s a time I always look back on fondly. We didn’t get along
“We’re not most parents,” Cas reminded him.
is why we told Sam first,” he said to Gabriel.
The Halloween pup shower was a lively event with a ‘Mothers and Fathers’ theme. Cas dressed in an apron that said ‘Kiss the Baker’ and Dean, now six months along, wore a big oven costume with a bun visible through the fake door on the front. Even with as large as his stomach had become, the Winchester legs were still amazing and he showed them off below the short costume in sheer black stockings and shiny black pumps.
Sam blew out a long breath, looking between the two of them. “I’m just floored. Dean’s always been the rudest, most hard-headed, and stubborn omega who would rather let his fists do the talking than admit that he had an honest feeling.” He gestured at his brother. “Yet, here he is, all… elegant and obedient, on his knees with a collar around his neck!” With a slightly hysterical laugh in disbelief, he pounded a fist on the table. “How’d you do it?”
“So, you’re the one who’s kicking me at night and making me need to pee,” he said, mockingly stern.
“I know,” said Dean, leaning in to kiss him. “I’m incredibly thankful for your patience, especially now when I know your instincts are telling you to protect me any way you know how.”
“How does that feel?” Dean asked, watching his face closely.
Re: I’m sorry
He was still purring, but said between kisses, “You told me you were sore.”
“Me too. I went home and told dad everything, which I’m still not sure if that was the wrong thing or the best thing to do. He left immediately and told me to stay with Sammy, who had recently presented alpha, so his hormones were going nuts. Turned out, he’d been listening when I was telling dad what happened and he said he was going to study up to become my manager himself, full stop. Didn’t offer, didn’t suggest, just outright said ‘I’m gonna be your manager.’ I said he didn’t need to, just concentrate on school and we’d just be more careful in the future, but he wouldn’t back down. Said he didn’t trust anyone but family to do right by me. Maybe because he was getting real familiar with alpha urges at that point, he never wanted to see them directed at me while he could stop it.”
“Okay, okay…” He knew better than to comment on that. Talking about their mother in an email was one thing, out loud was another. But of course, Sam wouldn’t be quiet for long. “What
I never used to wonder about my life. It’s quiet. Inconsequential. Not much different from my many siblings, like we’re nearly interchangeable. And then you came screaming into it. And I started to wonder… Do I live this life because I like it or because it’s easy to do what’s expected? You made me wonder, could I be brave? Somehow, hearing you have fears as well is a comfort to me. I’m not alone.
So, then… why did Dean feel such a deep ache inside? A great chasm that gaped ever wider with each passing day. As incredible as it seemed, maybe Crowley had been right. Maybe, on a certain level he had no control over, he needed this alpha. And that fucking
Cas looked at him from the corner of his eye, as if afraid to turn his back on Naomi. After slowly breathing in and out, he stepped up into the trailer and Dean followed him. Naomi sat back down with a pleased smile. Her scent wasn’t blocked this time and the trailer was full of the smell of copper, tea, and some kind of spice, like she’d intentionally dumped a load of her pheromones in the air to mark the place. It turned Dean’s stomach and made him want to cough, but he swallowed it back.
“Knot me,” said Dean, half an order, half a plea.
In a booming voice that was at once male and female and neither, human and not, it said, “Sebastian Colt… the covenant is made.”
I only have a double
With that, he turned on his heel and strode off the dance floor, heading for the archway with wickedly sculpted metal flames curling around it. A sign over it read ‘Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here’ in spiky calligraphy.
“What if he never tries again, Dean?” Sam was insistent. “Even if it doesn’t work out between you in the long run, he’s still doing something very brave and expecting you to play a key role. If you don’t show up tonight, he could just crawl right back into that white-on-white shithole and never make an attempt at something
I made an assumption last time that perhaps I shouldn’t have. My apologies.
“Well, just be aware that you’re welcome here,” said Dean, keeping his tone casual. “If you get tired of putting up with crap like that.”
Re: Today
“Yes. I apologized profusely and told him if I made him uncomfortable, I would make an effort to keep my distance, but he graciously informed me that wouldn’t be necessary. He was very understanding about instinctive ‘urges.’” The finger quotes were low to the ground, but very much there. He sighed. “I just wish
Castiel smiled. “Okay.” He gestured at the island with his wooden spoon. “How do you avoid uneven dough?”
The night air helped him sober up a bit but Dean had a pleasant buzz going as he walked home that night, hands deep in his pockets. The moon was amber, hanging low on the horizon, but the stars were clear overhead, twinkling and pretty. He tilted his head back to watch them as he walked since the streets were fairly quiet. A streak of light shot across the velvet black, right in his eyeline. It made him smile and reminded him that he should call Sam and ask how college was going.
It was another tie in their profound bond. Ramiel was continuing to change throughout this season, to differentiate himself from other angels and take on more human characteristics.
“Where would you go?”
this man was an alpha. There wasn’t anything else he could be. His clothes were hiding a truly magnificent physique, his shoulders alone told him that. His hands were
,” said Castiel, glaring. “It’s Dean Winchester. And you don’t know anything about him!”
Then Castiel let go of one of Dean’s wrists to cup his face and something inside of Dean broke. He panicked.
“Not at all. Mr Spangler told me what you did was purely for Miss Milton’s benefit, drawing the attention to yourself while also getting her away from that scumbag. It was impressive.”
Dean didn’t respond. All he could do was continue to stare at the picture. If he looked carefully, the matching black rings on their hands could be seen. How had Cas found out about the kissing picture? Maybe he’d looked into the origin of the first picture after Dean called their relationship off, since he’d talked about their careers being in danger as the reason for it. From there, he must have contacted Bela himself. The bastard was too smart.
Re: This week
He took a deep breath. “Good.”
When they finally pulled back, the red filamenting Castiel’s gaze echoed everything Dean was feeling, but he said anyway, “I think I’m all partied out. Want to go home?”
Nodding, Dean gestured for him to follow behind the counter and into the kitchen area. He leaned a hip against the island, folding his arms across his chest. Gabriel looked around at the organized chaos of the room, but didn’t appear to really be seeing it. His expression told Dean he was miles away, perhaps reliving some memory he’d rather have forgotten.
“She would call one out and expect me to assume the correct position. Like she could say ‘Wall’ and I would have to face the wall with my hands on it, crossed at the wrist, and my legs spread. Or ‘Table’ and I would get on all-fours. Doing the wrong one or doing the right one imperfectly would result in a punishment.”
“I can’t believe this,” Chuck exclaimed. “After everything I’ve done for you!”
The blood leached from Dean’s face. “You,
Once Dean had opened his gifts, which included a few pieces of jewelry, some lingerie, and a couple of new toys to play with in the bedroom, Cas announced there was one more. The omega frowned, not seeing anything else under the tree. With a sneaky grin, Cas asked that Sam and Gabriel hold the pups while they all went outside.
“Yes, daddy,” he said, sighing with gratitude. “I had so much going on in my head, it was such a relief to let it all go.”
He tried to stay calm and focus on his breathing the way Cas had taught him while the alpha’s guttural moans filled his ear. He wasn’t trying to prolong the torment by fucking Dean slowly, for which he was grateful, and his knot was already beginning to swell because they’d had so much foreplay in the car. But because it was all happening so quickly, Dean didn’t have any time to fall into sub-space, which would have helped him stave off orgasm. Instead, he had to concentrate hard on remaining calm and not giving in to the pleasure. The omega grit his teeth, holding tight to his will. He could do this; he
While the alpha dug into the bag to retrieve their dinner, Dean asked, “Would you like to know what your scent reminds me of?”
“Ugh, pass,” said Sam, getting up from the sofa. “I’ve seen it enough. It’s getting late, we had a busy day, I’m going to bed.”
Cas quirked a smile. “Exactly how you wanted it.”
. We got along right away. He was always highly respectful about giving me space, but he also listened whenever I had a suggestion. He was a pleasure to work with, but I didn’t have a clue he was interested at the time; he never showed it the way other alphas would.”
“Really?” The alpha sounded genuinely surprised. “I thought I’d hear some pushback on that. Does that mean I have a shot at you accepting me?”
“Behave, beloved,” said Cas, lifting a warning brow. “You know I don’t like punishing you in front of Sam.”
“That won’t stop Sam,” said Dean, confidently. “Just like with daddy, Sam is asking for her blessing as a formality, a show of respect. Though, honestly, I don’t see why she wouldn’t approve. My brother is awesome.”
“Oh,” said Castiel, breathlessly. “Sorry.”
He’d never counted down from ten faster and Cas only sucked harder. He shouted out the final numbers and came explosively down the alpha’s throat, sobbing in relief that he’d
“I… c-can’t… Mm!” Something dripped out of his ass. “What the—”
Where the hell had this come from? He pried at Castiel’s hand but couldn’t budge even a finger. “Where are you taking me?”
Have I ever asked what you look like? I never intended for this to go beyond electric correspondence, so your looks don’t matter to me at all. Your sexuality does matter because that is who you are and I want to respect it. But everything about this is new to me.
Okay… so maybe blushing wasn’t such a bad thing.
“I guess not.”
“I wouldn’t put it past you if you had a pair, is all I’m saying.”
“Well, they’re not really jet black, they’re more purple. But I still think it would look neat… and it would taste like a freaking strawberry.”
They glanced at each other, but knew their answer without saying a word.
“Should I stop?”
Dean cringed. “So… she got footage of me when it first happened.”
“Ah!” he gasped as Cas added a twist to the end of the stroke, stimulating the sensitive head. “No, that’s not—ah!”
She smiled at him, looking like a dark-haired June Cleaver in her fifties-style tea-length dress and pearls. Dean could see where Cas got his good looks, they were practically identical though her hair sparkled with gray. “Darling, he’s even more handsome in person,” she gushed.
When the knot began to catch on his rim, Dean knew he had a choice to make. He could bite his tongue and focus on the pain to keep himself from orgasming and accept the praise his daddy would give him afterward for obeying him. Or…
“Well, we tried lemon, we tried lime, I thought both would counteract the heat level even better than either on their own.”
“Well, he didn’t ask
Cas chuckled, the smile staying on his face as he watched Dean’s tiny celebration dance, which was mostly him wiggling back and forth in the alpha’s lap. “Yes, I believe we do,” he said. He handed Dean his phone which was resting on the coffee table next to the empty plates. “Care to do the lurking while I clean up a bit?”
I want to know what you smell like
“How’s the car?”
He slid his hands down to bracket his alpha’s face and pressed their foreheads together, filling his vision with heavenly blue. There were tears streaming down his cheeks, but he hardly noticed, they weren’t important. Instead, he sealed this moment away inside his heart to remember forever. It beat hard against his ribcage, and there was an answering beat right next to it, where Castiel’s chest was pressed to his. Two hearts, in perfect harmony.
“Semantics.” Tapping his watch in Castiel’s face, he said, “Tick-tock, darling.”
it to hurt. Either way, it’s going all the way inside you.” He patted between his shoulder blades. “Keep breathing, Dean. Long, deep breaths, that will help.”
Castiel crooked his fingers ever so slightly and Dean’s body, so attuned to everything that was happening, tightened around them, wanting more. “Come on,” Cas prompted again. His low, buttery-gravel voice like a caress that promised sweet release if Dean gave in.
Cas squirmed again and took a deep breath. Dean could feel his body heat rising. “I hope my knot goes down soon, I want to go grab some bottled water from the fridge and at least a few granola bars to have handy. The last thing we ate was that popcorn at the viewing party and that’s not going to sustain us.”
Re: Dreams
“Oh, that doesn’t matter,” said Cas. “Let this night be what it is. Something we’ll always remember. And the best fucking night of my fucking life.”
The gray-haired alpha looked down at his drink and Dean suspected that if his scent wasn’t blocked, he would be able to smell regret in the air. He glanced to his side where John was sitting. “I think your father might agree with me on this, that there are certain things that parents regret. Moments where they could have done better.”
Hey, I’m curious. What made you take the user name Angel Cakes if you bake bread?
They shook hands and held each other’s stare for a solid moment.
Dean grinned, overjoyed at his alpha’s reaction, though his anxiety cranked back up when Cas added,
“Ramiel, try not to break his hand,” said Gabriel before drawing in a deep breath and flipping up the sheet.
to each other.
He tried to put it out of his mind for the moment. It was still quite a while off and his heats almost never started early. He’d been late a few times due to stress, but very rarely early. It had happened once right after Sam presented and once after starting his job at the garage. So, he should be fine. Silently, he pleaded with his body not to do him dirty. He very much wanted pups, but he wanted that certificate in his hand before getting pregnant, and he didn’t want to wait until Fall to try. A lot was riding on this Spring.
That only made him laugh harder. Dean grinned.
“I know. It’s just… I wish I could have met you as a high schooler.”
Dean bit his lip. “Not in detail, daddy,” he admitted.
He didn’t want to, but felt it was likely Crowley might try to start something with the female crew members. Since Dean knew his game, he could put a stop to any of that if an attempt was made.
“Have you already gotten your chocolate?” Castiel asked. “I can get you a great deal on it.”
that from me. You don’t want me to be anything but who I really am. And it isn’t that you made all my demons disappear, they’re still there in the shadows, but you make me strong enough to fight them and you’re right there fighting at my side. I don’t ever want to lose that.” Turning, he reached for the ring box, his heartbeat jumping up a notch. “Castiel Novak, I fall more in love with you every day. If you will always love me and our future pups, then I place myself in your care from now onward, and trust you to know what I need and deserve. I am your beloved if you will always be my daddy. Will you wear my ring and show the world that you are mine?”
Let’s say yes for Sunday right now, but it may have to change, depending on how thin I spread myself by Saturday.
anymore.” He paused. “You could turn on me.”
“You allowed it to be.” He smiled. “I’m so grateful.”
“Well, when you’ve been led to believe that something is wrong your whole life,” said Dean in a tone that spoke of how ridiculous he thought it was, “it can be a shock when it shows up and feels like a part of you that was missing and you didn’t even know it.”
“Still want more?”
Dean got to his feet. “Shut up, Sam, alright? I’m not doing this with you!”
“Give me your color, beloved,” Cas prompted.
“You don’t have to do this,” Bast said, even so. “It’s a big decision, but I’m not gonna make it for you. Just know, you shouldn’t feel obligated.”
“I understand, but there are other deliveries we need to make. We can’t wait until after the ceremony.”
“Power is addictive,” he said. “The more you use it, the easier it is to let go of your humanity. And if there’s nothing left of you, I won’t be able to purify your soul. You’ll be a demon forever.”
John nodded, appearing thoughtful. Finally, he picked up his glass and held it out. “I want to meet him, officially. But your word is good enough for me. If you’re happy, then I’m happy.”
Dean was floating when he became aware of wet little kisses being trailed back up his body. He almost couldn’t keep his eyes open to see Castiel’s shining face and the cat-that-got-the-canary grin on it right before he kissed his mouth, letting Dean taste himself.
“Shut up, Aaron,” Dean growled as he stomped out of the room and left the dorm, heading for the West building.
The younger Winchester warily shook Castiel’s hand. “He’s told me about you, too,” said Sam. “Evidently, not enough.”
It was hard to believe in this modern era that some people thought because he was bi he was either ‘confused’ or ‘greedy’ or some other nonsense. Some women thought he would eventually leave them for a man and some men thought he would want to leave for a woman, like he could never be happy with a single partner and that’s just not how it worked.
The footsteps and voices were returning. “—I understand that it’s almost time for the wedding,” Chuck could be heard saying, “but if we can’t be paid right now, we’ll have to take our product back so we can make our other deliveries on time.”
Re: Pies
Looking down at where they were joined, Dean experienced another moment of regret that he didn’t have a knot. Come was already beginning to leak out around the sides without that natural biological plug. But that sparked a moment of inspiration.
“I want to get to know you, Dean,” he said. “Would you like that?”
It was hours later when Zeddmore called an end to the day’s shooting. Dean watched as Castiel fell heavily into a chair near craft services, folding over to lean his forearms on his thighs and letting his head hang down. He hadn’t shown so much as a wobble ever since Dean had chewed him out before, but now he appeared totally drained.
Rather than answer, Dean hit the call button. His brother picked up on the first ring.
aroused alpha.
“They’re looking forward to it as much as I am to meeting Sam at his graduation,” Cas added.
“It had more to do with what would best complement the… bonnet.” Castiel glanced down, his cheeks turning red.
This was his first opportunity to draw the line. Cas had purposely kept the punishment vague, though it was fairly obvious to Dean what was about to happen. He had to know if his trust in Cas could go this far. He needed to be pushed.
“Heart of Darkness Pie. Because when you cut a strawberry in half, it looks like a heart. What do you think?”
“Don’t you hear how silly that sounds?” This time, Novak’s voice held more frustration in it, and instead of touching Dean’s shoulders, he surprised him by cupping his face. His palms were warm and slightly calloused, but so gentle like he was holding a butterfly. His eyes were full of longing as he ran his thumbs over the apple of Dean’s cheeks and said, “Choose me.”
Sam: Talk to you later, love you big bro.
“No, that’s
“Is that how it was in your home?” asked Dean, beginning to unbutton his alpha’s shirt.
“It’s dad.”
Ending the call with a sigh, he shoved the phone deep in his pocket. His feet heavy, his dragging steps slowed then came to a reluctant halt. Despite knowing that he was long gone, Dean couldn’t help looking over his shoulder. More tears were stinging his eyes and he tried to blink them away; he had to get used to the idea of holding back these emotions at work, but just then he couldn’t help giving in. His inner omega was in mourning.
He returned it, warmly. “While we’re on the subject of making plans, are your parents all set for flying in from Illinois?”
“Mmm, you’re so sweet, Dean,” he said, licking his lips.
Quickly, he pulled up his gallery and texted Sam a picture he’d taken of him and Cas, a selfie of them having breakfast in the cafeteria, their heads close together. He captioned it ‘picture doesn’t do him justice,’ because a camera just couldn’t capture the ethereal beauty Cas had in person. He almost glowed, emanating this aura of openness and command that invited as much as it inspired respect.
Re: Thinking
“Whatever! Dean, that’s messed up. Why keep leading him on?”
The omega’s spine went stiff and his whole body went utterly cold at Crowley’s voice. He didn’t turn to look at him as the man approached.
He closed his eyes, unable to bear the sight of his smile. “No.”
Dean had rarely thought in terms of permanence before. With John running their lives from the trunk of a Chevy Impala, they’d never had that luxury. But Cas made him feel all kinds of new things. And that was
“Knowing you… it
“Ah-ah,” Castiel corrected him, his voice rumbling next to his ear. “You will address me as ‘professor.’ And I won’t let you come until you apologize for your behavior. I want to hear you say ‘I’m sorry, professor.’”
“I know. We’ve got our signal, though it’s unlikely I’ll need reminding. The visit is all I can think about.”
“Good,” she said again. “Cuz you don’t have any. Well, you do, but it’s bad.”
“I already did, remember?”
“I’m all the way inside you, beloved,” Cas panted. “You’re so hot and wet, you feel amazing. This part of you will only ever know my cock, I’m the only one who will ever fill you this way.”
Castiel reached for Dean’s hand and rested it on his chest, letting him feel his own racing heartbeat. “We’re the same.”
“Well, yeah,
“This was one of the first places I visited when I moved here,” said Cas. “I came back whenever I needed a moment of quiet, some time to think or just decompress. I remember you told me once that I smelled like Christmas, and I was reminded of this place with all the twinkling lights.”
Castiel closed the door. “We never did go over terms of address.” He snapped his fingers and indicated Dean’s bed. “Up.”
Dean could tell. He dipped his head toward her, lifting a brow in challenge, and she slowly closed her mouth.
Best regards, AC
“There’s no reason to jump right to that,” said Dean, trying to sound calm. “After all, there’s no way to tell if it’s you unless she releases the uncensored version. We’ll figure this out before that can happen.” He placed a reassuring hand on the alpha’s shoulder. “You’re going to keep acting, Cas. You’re amazing. It would be such a waste of your talent if you stopped.”
“Okay, buddy,” he said. “If that’s your answer, I’ll believe you.” He looked to Naomi. “Just not here, alright? This is where we work. Webb is a real shit about reputation. I don’t want anyone on the show knowing about this, it’s inappropriate.”
