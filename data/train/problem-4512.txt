, can’t we- ohhh,” he cuts off again, Dean having bit down on his collarbone to make a mark. “You’re going to- my boss will see-“
The moment of truth. “I’m on the table.”
“Dean!” Cas practically wails, and Dean is bending over him to kiss him quiet, as Sam is very much still inside and he does
trapped in his underwear- rubs against the sheets, and he moans, sending vibrations into Cas’s cock and up his spine. It’s the vibrations that do it again for Cas, and he’s coming and moaning out Dean’s name into the open air now, brain too fuzzy with pleasure to restrain himself. There’s no warning for Dean, but he takes it in stride, throat working the angel’s cock as he swallows his come.
Cas sits up on his lap then, looking down on Dean. They hadn’t even gotten that far, Dean still mostly clothed in his jeans and a t-shirt, while Cas was down to his slacks and his button-up, partially unbuttoned. It’s just that he couldn’t get it out of his head, not since he heard Dean say it, and the thought had him hotter than he’d like to admit.
And then Cas is kissing back, and although it’s almost like he just learned how to kiss (which… he probably did), it still feels great, better than Dean could’ve (and definitely didn’t) imagined, Cas’s lips moving against his own while Dean tilts his head to get just the right angle. And he’s grateful Sam is gone, because he really can’t stop himself from tugging Cas closer, pressing up against him and using his other hand to sink his fingers into Cas’s hair, using the resulting gasp from the angel to slide his tongue against the other’s lips, then into his mouth. He feels Cas’s tongue tentatively flick back against his own, and bless his heart he learns fast, because it’s not long before Dean’s the one moaning while their tongues slide against each other, feeling Cas’s hands settle at his waist, fingers idly snapping the band of his shorts against his hips.
Cas shushes him, making Dean shift his hips, annoyed, but Cas slides two fingers under the fabric, over the juncture of Dean’s hip and thigh, lifts it up, lets go so it snaps against Dean’s skin. Dean groans, not sure he can take much more of the teasing, almost fully hard at this point. Cas presses a chaste kiss to his collarbone, consoling him almost kindly, before biting down, intending to leave a mark just like the one he left on Dean’s arm.
, and Dean grabs his wrist, tugs him to the side and pushes on his back, pushes him into the wall. Cas collides hard with it, and then he spots Dean coming towards him and turns, barrels towards Dean and locks his arms around Dean’s middle, pushes him down to the ground.
Under the relief he feels at getting the two back safe and sound, as well as the phoenix’s ashes, he’s checking Dean out, eyeing the way the hat fits his head, the coat outlines his body. He’s wearing so many layers, it’s like they’re asking to be stripped off piece by piece.
resting at his entrance, teasing, he tries to press back into it.
him, bobbing his head while sliding his tongue against the side of his cock and tightening his throat, and Cas almost can’t handle it, his sensitivity heightened because of how long Dean has been teasing him. As it is, the pleasure overwhelms his brain, so he can only moan and squirm under Dean’s ministrations, only take what he’s given.
“Dean-“ Cas starts, but Dean is covering his mouth with his own, pressing an incredibly messy kiss to his lips as his thrusts pick up pace. Cas can barely respond, panting open-mouthed and struggling for breath as Dean kisses the life out of him, getting closer and closer with every thrust. His cock, trapped in his pants, is hard and throbbing in need and he can feel it getting slick in his underwear, precome leaking out and making a mess, and he desperately wants to come in Dean’s mouth or on him instead but it’s. It’s not going to happen.
The orgasm high fades far too quickly, and the void it leaves is quickly filled with guilt and shame. He tries to shrug out of Dean’s grip, but then he feels the drag of Dean’s still very hard cock inside him and he groans, his own cock twitching with interest again, even as his body groans in protest.
Finally, Dean weakly pushes at Cas’s head, trying to detach him from his now over-sensitive cock. Cas lifts his head, almost leaning into Dean’s touch, before moving back up to press needy kisses to Dean’s jaw. Dean moves his hands to hold Cas’s face, move his face to press a kiss to his lips, moist and puffy from sucking at Dean’s cock through the panties for so long. Cas kisses back needily, cock slip-sliding against Dean’s abdomen and smearing some leaking precum across it.
, Cas went and tried it. Tried on panties. Tried- on- and
, Dean, I need to come, I want- I was so good, please make me come-“ before he’s moving his hand slightly faster on Cas’s cock. Not enough to make him come, though.
“Invest in some concealer. And you looked so cute in your uniform, I couldn’t help it,” Dean replies honestly, leaning back to admire the marks he’s made, as well as check out Cas’s clothes again. “You keep so covered up most of the time, that stupid coat covering you-“
Dean squeezes around the base of his cock, swipes a thumb over the head, twists his hand as he strokes and he’s
“Yes, anything- anything you want,” Dean stutters, feeling the hand still in his hair tighten as he tries to move his head.
“Cas, are you propositioning me?”
“You trust me, Cas?” Dean asks, moving a little closer to the angel.
Well. That’s not what Cas meant to say.
Dean puts his hands in his jeans pockets and waits. The words finally make it through Cas’s brain, and his eyes widen, following Dean’s orders as he strips off the trench coat and the blazer, fabric falling to the floor, before he goes to Dean’s bed, lays down in the middle and waits for more orders.
fuck into him. And Dean takes the opportunity, one hand gripping Cas’s hip and the other tangling in his hair, trying hard not to yank too hard but when he pulls just a little to manhandle Cas into the right position, the angel gives the breathiest moan, and he can’t really help himself, using his hair and hip to really pound into him. When he shifts just right, he starts hitting Cas’s prostate a good >70% of the time, and he knows the angel isn’t going to last when he starts making those hitching noises again.
“I’ll be fine, I… I think I like the way it feels,” Cas frowns, but he can’t help if the way his burning ass feels against the fabric of his underwear shoots a shiver up his spine.
At the touch of Dean’s hands to where his cock is protruding the front of his slacks, Cas moans, leaning his head back and pressing into Dean’s touch. Dean looks up from the task at hand and sees Cas’s bared neck, and can’t help himself, attaching his mouth to it to make a mark while he takes a little longer to unbutton Cas’s pants than strictly necessary. Cas whines, eyes fluttering shut as he rocks his hips up against Dean’s hand, his own fisting in the sheets. The corner of Dean’s mouth twitches upwards as he circles his grip around Cas’s cock through his slacks, gives a quick squeeze just to make Cas groan,
And for a brief moment, Cas listened, simply lying there and making soft noises as Dean continued to bite marks into his neck before a particularly hard bite sent a pulse through his cock, and he was moaning, bucking his hips up against Dean’s again.
“Cas, you don’t have to-“ Dean starts, but Cas’s hand wrapping around his cock effectively cuts that sentence short, gives into a groan at the skin contact. After doing the kinkiest shit he’s done in a while with fucking
“You want it?” Dean asks, gruff.
appetizing. An angel of the Lord, wearing nothing (for Dean) but a nice, lacy pair of white panties, maybe with little bows-
There’s a beat. Dean is flushed, looking into Cas’s eyes and trying to tell if he’s joking, but of course he never jokes.
Dean sighs, and stands up, walking over to the angel and yanking the remote out of his hand, then turning the TV off. “We gotta get you a crash-course in electronics, man. And social norms.”
He sits next to Cas on the couch, faces him. “So what was it about this that finally got your engine going?”
“C’mon, spit it out.”
,” Cas changes his stance, readies for a fight.
“Shut up,” comes the muffled response into his collarbone.
Dean looks up, continues squeezing their cocks. “Cas?” he asks between sharp inhales.
But then, Cas pulls back, fists a hand in Dean’s hair to keep him down even as he tries to lean up to chase Cas’s mouth. Dean lets out a moan at the tug on his hair, just bordering pain and pleasure, as he looks up at Cas with pleading eyes.
The final kick lands him against the fence, and then he’s on the ground, the taste of metal filling his mouth as he spits up blood. The thing was that each of those punches felt like
“It’s for a case. Virgins in the group are disappearing, so we’re uh, going undercover. We were re-virgin-ized and now I’m saving myself for marriage,” Dean explains, smile twitching as he tries to contain laughs.
Sensitivity heightened, Cas shivers and moans, not able to come from just this but still getting pleasure, back arching against the touch. The pinching and twisting of the nipple not in Dean’s mouth makes him buck his hips, but his cock only flops against his abdomen, Dean hovering a careful distance away so Cas can’t grind against him.
“Yeah, I know, I know. Listen, I don’t care if heaven’s-
“Hey, hey, hey,” Dean tries to soothe, moving his hands to hold the angel’s wrists. “We weren’t lost though, okay? You got us back, and we got the ashes and everything.” Then he grins, “What, you think you can be rid of me that easy?”
Dean can only process so much information at once, but the chief thing that’s bangin’ around in his head is that because Dean explored a kink
He looks up at Cas, sees him looking down at the hunter with blown pupils, his mouth a little open and lips spit-shiny. Then Dean feels overwhelmed by the eye contact, and he focuses on Cas’s cock, using one hand to manipulate it, hold it by the base while he sucks the head into his mouth.
him, open him up, and the thought has him bucking his hips harder, twitching away from the pain while twitching into the pleasure/pain of his cock against Dean’s jeans. With a thought, the jeans are gone, put in the pile of Cas’s clothes, so Cas can finally feel his
“No! No, it’s- that’s- that’s wrong, you’re an angel, I’m not gonna- do that with an angel, I’m sure that’s a sin in
“You mentioned wanting, to, uh… be. Slapped. By a girl wearing a Zorro mask, if I’m not mistaken,” Cas says, eyes now trained on the ceiling, head tilted back.
“Cas,” Dean says, hoarse already, view of where exactly Cas’s exploring hands are going blocked by his head.
“Dean?” Cas interrupts his musings, leaning a little closer to the hunter.
When he was first thrown against the wall, it hurt like a bitch, but a thrill ran up his spine, his thoughts from earlier flashing through his head. And then the punches started coming. In the face, in the stomach, and Cas is yelling about how he
It’s said in a tone that, while Dean doesn’t know Castiel that well, he’s sure Castiel doesn’t actually care about him or his dreams. Although it’s a weird thing to ask about. Maybe he doesn’t get to dream. Maybe he’s jealous.
Cas opens his mouth, possibly to reply, but at that moment he shifts
And yeah, Dean is concerned. But he can also see a wet spot forming at the front of Cas’s pants, where the tip of his cock has leaked through
With the go-ahead, Dean squeezes, then smacks his ass again, this time on the other cheek, and Cas gives a surprised moan, feeling the pleasure more than the pain now. Dean keeps going, going through the same routine where he gropes, then spanks, making his way down to Cas’s thighs, up to where ass ends in back. With each hit, Cas gives out a sound, moans, groans, gasps, Dean’s name. He didn’t get it at first, but the hits make him harder, make him twitch his hips against Dean’s legs.
He’s starting to understand why Cas wears so many layers, keeps so much covered up. He thinks if he get to see this much of his skin regularly, he’d probably have jumped his bones ages ago.
Dean sits up, and then Cas is wrapping his legs around Dean’s waist, pulling him in.
crawling on his skin, the angel seems to be completely naked. How he’s not freaked out by all the bees, Dean isn’t sure, but Dean sure is, so he keeps a healthy distance from the angel.
, Cas. Some people are into that.” Dean pauses, while Cas mulls his words over. “I can… show you. How to take care of that. If you want,” Dean works out, tilting his head towards the elephant in the room (it’s Cas’s dick). He’s surprised he managed to get all that out considering he is
Somehow, Dean knows to stay still, parting his lips just a little bit to tease entry. When Cas doesn’t move, Dean flicks his tongue against the head, just a taste, to get Cas going.
The air is knocked out of Cas’s lungs, but he takes a swipe at Dean anyway, manages to catch him in the chest, knocking them apart for the time being again. Until Cas’s eyes flash, and his hand thrusts out, intending to use his powers to knock Dean back. Of course, it doesn’t work because
When Dean pulls back to ask if Cas is okay, Cas beats him to it with, “I’m fine, thank you. You’re keeping that outfit,” making Dean chuckle.
Cas moves in eagerly, tongue flicking out to taste the head before he’s reaching up to hold it before Dean stops him.
“If I weren’t, I wouldn’t still be here,” Cas responds quietly, interrupting Dean’s train of thought, but Dean has to contend that yeah, Cas probably would’ve flown his ass out of here the moment Dean kissed him if he didn’t want it.
And the thought of actually getting his
“What did you like about it?”
, a very powerful being, is getting off on having Dean in charge.
“I’ve come here to warn you,” Cas responds, and if Dean didn’t know him so well, he could’ve sworn the angel looks… uncomfortable.
Cas glances around, looks back at Dean. “We can’t. It’s- it’s too dangerous, we don’t know when Benny will come back, it’s not-“
Even when they introduced bondage into the bedroom, it wasn’t enough. Usually it was Cas’s tie, and no matter how tight Dean tied him, if he took too long, Cas would either angel-powers his way out of them, or tug his hands out of them, or just ruin the headboard getting out of them. Dean wouldn’t even be able to tie him up again, because once Cas got his hands on Dean’s cock, it was all over for him.
“What was that?” Dean asks, tone innocent but intent teasing as he does another slow roll of his hips.
It amps up Cas’s desperation, so he’s letting out a series of whines between his begging and Dean has to cover his mouth again. He feels Cas’s cock twitch in his hand, and he knows Cas is going to last long, not after sucking Dean off, so he speeds up to a quick pace, a gross squelching noise filling the air as he works Cas to orgasm. Not that either of them mind, as the pleasure after so long overwhelms Cas, short-circuits his brain so it’s barely a minute before he’s arching his back hard, moaning high against Dean’s hand as his cock spurts come all over Dean’s fist, and his own shirt.
“I don’t know what he has to do with this,” Cas responds, which normally Dean would roll his eyes at but Cas’s voice is so
Dean grips the seat of the chair and opens his mouth again, surely to ask Cas what the
in his look- Dean wasn’t lying when he said the last time someone looked at him, he got laid. It’s the usual look people give him before they rip their and his clothes off.
Pulled back from the edge, Cas groans in frustration, eyes flying open as he realizes what’s happened and eyebrows furrowing. “Dean!”
Instead of getting started on that, Dean chooses to run his hands over Cas’s back instead, mapping out skin and muscles he doesn’t get to see normally. Over the angel’s shoulders, his fingertips are barely touching, slowly down to where his tied hands are covering the small of his back, and by then his hands are
“That’s cute, really. You want me. You can’t help it,” Dean teases, rocks his hips against Cas’s. Cas growls and tries to struggle against the hold Dean has on his arms, but he has no leverage in this position, and so all he manages to do is grind up harder against the demon on top of him, making him lose his focus even more.
“Yes, sir,” comes automatically from Dean’s mouth, as a flush rises in his cheeks.
”s now as his bucking gets frantic, the slick noises of their cocks sliding together filling the air and underlining Cas’s moans. Dean starts sucking another mark onto his collarbone, using his non-cock-filled hand to tease at a nipple, and the pleasure becomes too much for the angel.
“Cas, this isn’t-“ Dean stops himself to give a sigh. He hadn’t done anything with Cas since the angel woke up crazy- actually, since he’d taken on Sam’s burden. He hadn’t been himself, and ethically, Dean has no idea what frame of mind he’s in, if he can even really consent. Weird Hippie Cas is probably more likely to be able to consent than Lucifer Cas, though, even if they don’t quite know what’s wrong with him.
Dean, for his part, is struggling to contain his moans against the back of Cas’s neck. It was that Cas is barely able to contain his noises because of the way Dean is making him feel- the thought has him grinding hard against Cas’s ass, and he knows he’s not going to let go of Cas’s cock for a second to free his own- he’s made his peace with the fact that he’s probably going to make a mess in his pants because he’d die if he stopped hearing the little whimpers that Cas was making as he was getting close.
Dean shrugs. “Well, you helped in one aspect.”
Anyway.
The slap leaves a nice red handprint, one that tightens that pit in Dean’s stomach, and now he knows his own cock has to be poking Cas’s stomach, but the angel seems unbothered. Still into it, even, as now his unclothed boner is rubbing against the fabric of Dean’s jeans, which
Not as concerning as being woken up by an angel, though.
If all the things in Purgatory weren’t trying to kill them, Dean might’ve tried to kill Cas when he and Benny finally caught up with the angel. Even Cas’s explanation of why he disappeared- trying to
He also knows they’re already on thin ice, that Benny or monsters could be back any moment, but he can’t help himself as he whispers into Cas’s ear, “C’mon, Cas, why don’t you come for me? You’re being so good for me, keeping those noises in. I know it’s hard, but once we get outta here, I’ll take you out somewhere isolated, yeah? And you can make all the noises you like. You know I like the noises you make, anyway. It makes me so hot when you moan my name, y’know? It’s making me hot now that you can’t even contain those noises, you have to moan for me when I touch you. The second I get my hand on your cock, you’re-“
“Dean, please…” Cas trails off with a gasp, thumb dragging over the head of his cock through his underwear, seeing where leaked precome has stained it. “Want you…”
He’s pretty sure he blacked out, because when he comes to, his wrists are uncuffed and Dean is massaging them as he cuddles up to Cas’s side.
the tree, Cas just a couple feet away, standing guard as Benny fucks off to who knows where. Maybe gone to find food, or establish a perimeter, who knows. The point is, he’s left with Castiel, facing away from him, back and shoulders tense as he keeps a look out.
orgasms before, during the last one, he’s coming himself, the squeeze of Cas’s hole around his cock just a little much for him, spurting into Cas in time with Cas pooling come on his own stomach, barely any this time.
At least, he thinks so, as Dean is suddenly sliding his mouth down onto Cas’s cock, throat tightening around him as he takes him to the base, and he
“Dean?”
He can see Cas searching his eyes, mouth set into a hard line, still angry. Less so now, though. “You know I care about you greatly, Dean.”
that- and it’ll help me sleep,” Dean argues.
Cas pauses in unpacking the panties to look up at Dean, letting a particularly lacy purple one drop from his fingers to the bedspread. “What?”
“They stay here,” Cas finishes in a low voice, agreeing that at least the cuffs are a toy they should
“What-“ Dean starts, before recalling talking about his time with the panties and that girl, and his face colors rather quickly.
at me, man. That’s their problem,” Dean grumbles.
“Dean, please-“ Cas starts to beg, as he thinks that’s what Dean wants, and he’s
“Cas,” Dean groans, hand tightening in the angel’s hair as he closes his eyes, kinda unable to bear the eye contact while Cas sucks the head of Dean’s cock into his mouth. He’s not sure what exactly in the universe had to click into place to make this happen, but he’s grateful nonetheless, very carefully guiding Cas’s mouth up and down on his cock, opening his eyes again when a moan from the angel shoots a bolt of pleasure directly to his core. He doesn’t pick up on it immediately, pleasure making his vision hazy, but when he spots Castiel’s other hand pressing and rubbing against the tent in his shorts, he has to restrain himself from coming right there and then in Cas’s mouth.
When Cas is done, he carefully pulls out of Dean’s mouth, eyes his lips puffy with abuse and groans, tucking himself back in. “You think you’ve earned the right to come?”
“Yes, sir,” Dean just barely keeps in character, worldview narrowing to the way Cas is watching his every move, and the way Cas’s hand is moving on his cock.
“Christ,” Dean says roughly, and as soon as Cas is done coming, Dean is reaching for his face with one hand (the non-come-covered one), tilting his head, and landing a kiss on those teeth-bitten lips from Cas trying to keep quiet.
Cas was flushed, sweat beading on his neck, and Dean had the sudden urge to lick it off. As he’s thinking that thought, his cock starts to harden in his jeans, which is
Cas watches the movement of his tongue with laser focus, until he’s leaning down, dirtily sucking Dean’s tongue right into his mouth. Dean groans, reaches to slide his hands up the side of Cas’s abdomen as he flicks his tongue inside the angel’s mouth.
Until Dean is
And sure enough, when Dean detaches from Cas’s mouth to glance down his body, Cas is hard again. Or is still hard, maybe he never stopped being hard. Who cares.
And with a flutter of wings, Cas is interrupting Dean’s train of thought once more.
“Yep, sure, sure. And you’re likely to get fried in the process,” Dean clarifies, pulling into a parking spot.
Apocalypse. Raphael. God. Imminent death. Yep.
“Dean-“
“I don’t think so. I’ve seen you come untouched before, and you’re going to do that for me, aren’t you? I know you can,” Dean teases, thrusts harder and tugs at Cas’s hair when he doesn’t get an immediate response.
Great.
For a first-timer, Cas is taking it like a champ, hanging onto the pillow for dear life and doing his best to thrust back against Dean, feeling overwhelmed by the feeling, the sound, the taste of Dean as he leans down for a dirty kiss, stroking his tongue along the roof of Cas’s mouth. He thinks it can’t get better, until Dean pauses in his thrusts to shift Cas’s hips up just
“The meat craving part? What, there’s something else now?” Dean asks, raising his eyebrows.
Cas groans out a version of Dean’s name, arches into the touch, rests his hands on Dean’s shoulders. Dean’s mouth sucking a mark onto his neck feels better than imagined, and he can feel Dean’s tongue swipe over a spot, then his teeth latch onto it, biting and sucking.
It’s then that Dean pulls off Cas’s cock, his mouth making a popping noise as he sits back, eyes trained on the angel’s cock twitching in need.
The touch has Cas bucking his hips and crying out Dean’s name, squeezing the base of his cock so he remembers to go slow. His hips twitch with the effort of following Dean’s instructions, and moans turn into whimpers as his cock aches for his hand to go faster.
He shrugs, “Girl in the Zorro mask isn’t that important. But, uh, if you wanted to- to try slapping, we can do that.” He’s going for casual, but he knows it’s not working, not the way his pupils are dilating at the thought.
It didn’t work. Dean had moved to Cas’s neck, dragging his lips against his stubble and sucking a spot on the juncture of the angel’s jaw and his neck, before murmuring into his skin, “Calm down or I’m gonna have to tie you up.”
“How could I deny a request like that?” the corner of Dean’s mouth twitches as he teases Cas, but his cock is aching for the angel’s touch now, so he acquiesces, nudges his hips forward and pulls Cas’s head towards it.
As it is, the tidal waves of pleasure are bringing him closer to the edge, Cas expertly (porn magic… amateurs are never amateurs) sinking down onto his cock, tongue flicking to tease at his head, curl around his girth, and bobbing faster and faster. His own experience and movie magic are keeping him on the edge, but he’s decided he definitely wants to come in Cas’s mouth- he’s not letting the trickster control him into going all the way with the angel.
He can hear Cas’s muffled protests under his lips, Cas’s hands coming up to rest at Dean’s shoulders, like he’s going to push him away- but he doesn’t. And then Dean is situating a leg between Cas’s, his thigh rubbing against where Cas’s cock is, and the protests turn into moans as Cas starts getting hard.
“That’s it,” Dean is cooing between heavy breaths and over the sound of slapping skin filling the room. “You like that, I know you do. Just like the old Dean, but now you
Except he can, he needs to take his time (as much as he dares) he reminds himself, and so he carefully starts sliding his finger in and out, getting Cas used to the situation before slowly slipping another in. He also starts sliding his tongue up Cas’s cock, to give him some pleasure to distract from the weird sensation of being stretched out.
“You’re only going to take what I choose to give you,” Cas ignores the silent begging as he talks in a soft voice.
Without really thinking about it, Dean is walking forward, towards Cas, who backs up, matching Dean step-for-step, until his back hits the shelves, making the supplies rattle. Dean scans Cas’s body, eyes running over that outfit just one more time before he’s cupping Cas’s face with his hands and kissing him hard, the force pushing him into the shelves and making the supplies rattle again.
By now, he’s sure they’ve had enough teasing, otherwise he probably would’ve held the position just a little bit longer, gotten used to how Cas feels around him. As it is, they’re still on a time limit, and Dean would
Dean groans, hand palming harder against an ever-growing bulge, now leaning back against the wall. His head thunks hard against the metal as he leans it back, making a sound he prays to someone doesn’t travel to the rest of Bobby’s house. It’s just that he can feel the pleasure building at the base of his spine, and as he palms the right way his
Dean swallows. “Castiel?”
Frustration floods Cas’s brain as he’s denied again, and he scowls, about to chew Dean out, when he’s interrupted.
Dean kinda can’t believe what’s happening, but frankly, he was woken up in the middle of the night and he’s tired as hell, so he thinks he’s a little entitled to answers.
Cas is constantly moaning into Dean’s mouth now, hands clenched in the sheets while he squirms under the hunter, and he can barely kiss back now, so overtaken by new pleasure he can’t focus. Dean moves his mouth to Cas’s neck instead, gently kissing and sliding his tongue against his pulse, before sinking his teeth into his collarbone, and now Cas’s moans and whines are spilling into the open air instead of Dean’s mouth, making him rock just that much harder against his hips. Dean’s really hoping the walls are thick, or they have no neighbors, because he’s pretty sure the angel of the Lord is going to wake up the whole motel with how he’s groaning
Dean blinks several times, thinking about how best to explain his kink to the angel. “Well, it’s, uh… I hadn’t thought about it before that. I was 19, though, and Rhonda was
, so wanting to just open the other right up and fuck him, but he pushes down that desire, squeezes the base of his cock as he watches Cas watch him touch his cock.
Leaving Dean to deal with him instead.
“Uh, yeah.”
The slaps only worsen Dean’s need, making his cock throb and leak as he tries his best to get Cas to come, bobbing his head as Cas thrusts his hips forward, nearly choking but it’s definitely worth it. Cas notices, gives a short laugh as he pushes further down Dean’s throat. “You want me to come so you can, is that it? You’re that needy?” he coos, even as he gets closer, breaths coming fast. “I could probably hold out forever if I wanted to, fuck that pretty little mouth of yours and deny you forever.”
Well, until he hears Castiel whine, and he opens his eyes to find Cas
in the woods- and he maneuvers the angel around, so his back is to Dean’s front and he can grind against the other while he covers his mouth with a hand.
“Shut up,” Cas tries to snap back, but the effect is ruined by how breathy his voice sounds already, brain muddled by the way Dean’s cock presses against his.
Not that he wants to unpack that right now. Or ever.
he’s making, God-
, hips jerking hard and a drop of precome landing on the sheets. Dean eyes the trail of his spit as it traces its way down to Cas’s hanging balls, leaving a shiny trail, and then he’s leaning in, digging a thumb into the rim of the angel’s hole, stretching him carefully and flicking his tongue over his hole.
gesture.
“And we still have lots of time together, which means you can slow down,” Dean coos, pressing a soft kiss to Cas’s jaw.
For his part, Dean takes it in stride, feeling his own cock strain in his underwear but he figures Cas’s- affected by Famine- need might outweigh his own. So he spits down into his hand (and on Cas’s cock) to help smooth things along, and the strangled noise that leaves Cas’s throat is totally worth it, as well as watching the slick of his spit slide down the side of Cas’s cock, leaving a shiny trail. He rubs his palm over it, swipes his thumb over the head of the angel’s cock, then starts jerking him off, harsh and fast to match his need. He could make it slow and sweet, but he figures Cas wouldn’t appreciate it, so he leans down to take a hard nipple between his teeth, nipping at it, then flicking his tongue against it.
Cas is still trying to recover from his orgasm, but does his best to kiss back eagerly, eyes fluttering shut again as he presses his lips to Dean’s, almost chaste.
“I do. And Sam does too. Don’t make this harder than it has to be,” Cas tries to coax him, moves a bit closer.
“Can’t get rid of it, no.”
Castiel says, “Hello, Dean,” and it interrupts Dean’s train of thought, so he focuses his attention on the angel in front of him.
When Dean pulls Cas’s cock out of his underwear, it’s already hard, and he doesn’t waste any time before squeezing it and pulling at it, jerking him off. Cas whines and twitches in his grip, head tilting back and hands tightening on Dean’s shoulders. The pleasure courses through him, makes his brain fuzzy, gets rid of the worries for right now at least, but he has enough brainpower left to maneuver his hands around Dean’s, undo his pants and release the boner he’s had probably since Cas first slammed him against a wall.
when Dean brings his hand down hard on Cas’s ass.
“Dean, I want- please- fuck me,” Cas begs, eyes opening to look down at Dean.
“You gonna be good for the sheriff? Gonna swallow ‘cause I tell you to?” the words feel almost foreign in Dean’s mouth, but the way Cas full-body shivers at them and nods vigorously more than makes up for the newness. The moan the angel lets out as he bottoms out finally pushes Dean over the edge, letting out a gasp, then a groan of Cas’s name as he comes down his throat, hips twitching as he keeps his cock there.
“Sheriff.”
Dean quietly curses the lack of soul in his brother (although he’s not sure regular Sammy wouldn’t escape that sitch as soon as possible), before turning to the angel. “C’mon, man, turn it off.”
He knows.
The time in Purgatory has been good for no one, Dean knows that, but Cas said it- he has a target on his back, because of all the… uh. Murder. Yeah. So Dean knows Cas is more in danger than he or Benny, is risking all their lives when they’re together. Of course, it just makes him appreciate Cas all the more, despite the fact that he’s still mad at him.
It started out innocent enough, as it usually did, with Dean and Cas rolling into Dean’s bed in the bunker, slowly working each other up and getting each other hard.
With the two pleasure points, it takes Cas even less time to come this time, arching into Dean’s grip and making a further mess of his stomach. When Dean slows down to check in with the angel, though, Cas gasps out, “Don’t stop-“ and yeah, he’s still hard.
Dean ignores the begging and slides one hand over where the tie meets the skin of Cas’s wrists, down to where that bare skin meets the fabric of his pants, down to where that fabric covers his ass. He takes the opportunity to squeeze, making Cas make some very interesting noises into the couch. Dean uses his other hand to card through Cas’s hair, almost petting him, soothing him as he raises his other hand up. He can feel Cas freeze in anticipation, clench under him, so he waits, hand hovering in the air.
him, it was overwhelming him, overloading the pleasure centers in this vessel’s brain. Looking through Jimmy’s memories, he’s
“I could just jerk myself off, come all over you and leave you here. And you couldn’t do anything about it.”
“Cas. I’m guessing you’re here to tell me the apocalypse has been solved and we can go back to hunting normal things?”
Dean collapses next to Cas as they both come down from their highs, and he can’t even be assed to clean up, wiping his hand (ew) on the sheets next to them. He’s sure the sheets have seen worse.
of bottoming out in Cas before pulling back and fucking back in again, something that just makes sense when he thinks about it later. It’s actually making him hotter that he’s fucking Cas over the hood of Baby, and that Cas
Dean only jerks his hips a few more times (drawing whines from Cas) before he’s coming, forehead pressed to the angel’s neck as he groans, mind overwhelmed with pleasure as he fills Cas with his come (although he probably should’ve asked first, should’ve asked before-)
“Please, sir,” Dean stays right in character, looks up at Cas with pleading eyes.
Cas looks down, hands clenched at his sides. He suppresses a sigh, and turns to leave. “Fine.”
“Of course, if you don’t like them, I can return-“
And then
Which he does.
And while the thought of monsters finding them because Dean is jerking him off shouldn’t be hot, because of the potential death and all, but the thought has Cas arching into Dean’s grip, now holding tight to Dean’s pants as the pleasure increases. Maybe it’s not the thought of getting caught, but the thought that Dean is making him feel good enough that he has to shout his pleasure to Purgatory- that others will know how Dean is debauching him.
It’s a little concerning.
“Dean…”
Wordlessly, Dean flicks his eyes down to the pile, starts combing through them. The…
naked, bare and still trapped beneath the demon.
“Y- y-
That slap was the last straw for Dean, abdomen tightening as he comes all over Cas’s fist with a wail of his name. Cas strokes him through it, his other hand rubbing over the marks on his thigh in a soothing way.
Cas thinks he’s babbling as much, expletives and half-muttered phrases pouring out his mouth as Dean sucks him off, feeling the wet heat around his cock just a little too much for him. And then Dean is adding his hand, slick sliding over the wet trail his mouth’s left and jerking off what he doesn’t reach with his mouth. It’s driving Cas to the edge far too quickly, and part of him wants to enjoy it, take his time with Dean, but the other part of him
it, feels guilt seeping into every bone in his meatsuit as he knows he definitely could’ve kicked his way out of this one by now, especially since Dean’s sensitive bits are out. One well-placed kick, and he could be out of there in an instant, or he could’ve used his powers to put his clothes back on-
When Cas unclenches, turns his head, confused, as if to ask a question,
Dean lets out a groan against Cas’s neck when he sees it shiny with his spit, and Cas is actually begging now, “Dean, that feels so good, more, I want- I want more, don’t stop-“
“Yes, you can, and you will,” Dean says, before sucking another mark onto Cas’s neck, which is really starting to look like an abstract art piece. He’s getting close himself, and while he knows he’s going to regret it about 30 seconds after he comes, he doesn’t think he can stop before he comes in his pants.
Then Cas is kissing him again, mouths moving hotly against each other as they pant and moan between kisses. Dean swipes his thumb over the head of Cas’s cock, finds it leaking precome, works the liquid down his cock to make a soft squelching sound, loud when the only other sounds are working their way out of the hunter and the angel’s throats, or from the way Dean’s tongue sips into Cas’s mouth, sliding against his. At the feeling, Cas moans, high in his throat, hand stuttering on Dean’s cock as his hips buck into the touch, using the leverage his position has to do so.
“Try again.”
What the
As it is, they tuck their cocks away, do their best to make themselves presentable to the public again. When they’re as good as it’s gonna get, Cas pauses, catches Dean’s face with his hand. “You’re ours. Mine. Not Michael’s. You get me?”
Cas swallows dutifully, cock painful in his pants now as his fingernails scratch at his wrists in the effort it takes not to palm at his cock. Dean pulls back, last spurts of come hitting Cas in the lips and making him look like a freakin’ pornstar, at which his cock gives a twitch. He only needs a breath before he’s kissing Cas, mess be damned, pushing him back onto the covers and undoing his pants to let Cas’s cock out.
In reality, the pressure has become too much and Dean unzips his pants, pulls his cock out to finally get skin-on-skin contact and although it’s not Cas’s wet mouth sinking onto it, that thought has him already fucking
, eyes settled at the panties and the way they hug his hips and frame his dick. “Cas?”
Cas keeps his head at Dean’s collarbone, but slides one hand down, head tilted to watch its progress, fingers skipping across Dean’s chest like a stone over water, down to the V of his hips, the top of the panties. His fingers brush where the top of the fabric meets Dean’s abdomen, causing a sharp inhale from Dean, then down to where Dean’s thigh meets the fabric, skipping around the obvious bulge in front.
- it’s the least he can do. Raising him from hell is worth at least a reach-around.
Just then, Cas slides home and swallows around Dean’s cock (because of course no one in porn has a gag reflex), and Dean’s hips jerk- he can’t help it- against Cas’s face, causing another groan that hits home with Dean. He’s groaning, moaning out some choice phrases like, “Just like that”, “You feel so good”, “You’re gonna make me come, Cas-“, and Cas is still taking his cock like a champ, all wet heat and tightness around it and he can see Cas’s hips jerking against his hand, getting closer and closer to coming in his shorts.
And then they came back from the trip, which gave Cas about 15 heart attacks on the way, and Dean was wearing a completely different outfit than the one he left in. Cas isn’t sure what happened while the two hunters were gone- he’s sure he’ll get the full story sooner or later- but the shiny new sheriff’s badge on Dean’s chest tells a story.
Silence. Dean is frozen, the noise Cas made working its way through his brain. Cas is frozen, only because if he moves again, that pleasure’s going to course through him again and he doesn’t really know what to do with that.
of Dean’s mouth around him, the wet, hot suction building that knot of pleasure again. Even with Dean pinning his hips down, he can still feel his strength flowing through him, the angel strength that makes him want to shove his cock right down Cas’s throat- but he doesn’t, resists the best he can, consigns himself to little jerks instead. He can feel Dean swallow around him, and he moans, head tilting back against the pillow as he writhes on the sheets, brain filled with static.
“Sir or commander are acceptable,” Cas practically growls, and fuck, Dean just forgets sometimes that his sweet little angel lead
“That didn’t make sense,” Cas says, frown deepening.
Cas raises his hands to hold the pillow beneath his head, holding on for dear life as a knot of pleasure builds at the base of his spine, the slick of Dean’s hand just a little too much for him. And looking down to see Dean’s lips wrap around one nipple, teasing it and tugging at it until Cas is whining his need, bucking his hips into Dean’s touch. Through the haze of pleasure, he can see Dean pull his mouth off his abused nipple, leaving it hard and shiny before moving to the other one and pulling all sorts of noises from the overwhelmed angel.
“I mean-“ Cas is now visibly flustered, a look Dean isn’t sure he likes on him. At least, not in a context where he needs answers. “Zachariah… overheard your conversation with your potential future self. You talked about an experience you had, to prove to him it was you.”
Dean doesn’t usually have the capacity for this many emotions. In fact, the usual range is probably angry, relieved, worried, lust, burger. So to feel guilt, to feel responsible, to feel prepared for the pain of being Michael’s vessel, to anger about having to do it, to more anger and sadness as his own brother locks him away in the chamber-
“Well, I’ve lost your brother, and I’m afraid I’ve almost hurt myself too many times moving around in this world. If I try to move you anywhere… well, I don’t know what’ll happen to either of us. Listen, there’s something weird about all this-“
Dean stands his ground, keeps his eyes to the sky. “Cas, you’re not in the right mind to- to-“
Dean shifts, trying to get the angle right for working Cas’s cock down his throat, when his own cock-
So he leans in again, pressing a relatively chaste kiss to Cas’s lips before pulling away- pulling a fun whine from the angel- but in an instant, he’s tugging Castiel’s trench coat off. He’s interrupted by a wave of Cas’s hand, and he’s naked, which at least startles Dean, suddenly faced with an expanse of skin he doesn’t normally get to see.
He moans when he feels Cas’s other hand sliding up his thigh, then practically wails when Cas suddenly smacks his thigh, sending sparks shooting up his spine.
“Hello, Dean,” comes the response, although instead of the usual gruff way Cas says it, it’s got that dreamy-like quality he’s adopted since he became… uh. Loony.
“You getting close, Cas? You’re not even gonna be able to clean that up, y’know. I’m gonna make you come in your pants, and then you’re just gonna have to deal with it, knowing I made you come in your pants without even really touching your dick,” Dean continues to murmur in Cas’s ear, and while it is totally a problem that they’re probably going to come in their pants, the thought of Cas having to walk around like that is somehow
“Good,” Cas murmurs, undoes his pants to pull his cock out and presses the tip to Dean’s lips.
“I said it was fine,” Castiel shakes his head, effectively waving off Dean’s apology.
Dean is now definitely sweating underneath his many layers (three? Four? Who knows), but he could care less, comfort taking a backseat in his mind to the way Cas’s mouth is hot and wet around him. While he loves fucking Cas, watching the faces he makes as Dean nails him in the prostate and jerks him off, he would privately admit he prefers fucking Cas’s mouth. There’s something that having an angel of the Lord on his knees for Dean that does it for him, ignoring his own pleasure in favor of Dean’s, pliant and willing and sincere as Dean fucks his throat.
Imagine, an angel of the Lord, cleaning puke off a gas station floor.
There’s a few seconds where Dean pants, struggling to get his breath back while Cas watches him carefully.
“It felt nice, but it didn’t really appeal to me in the way I assume it appeals to you,” Cas says with a shrug. No harm, no foul. Then, and here’s the kicker, he produces a bag clearly labeled
He speeds up his pace almost immediately, practically fucking Dean’s mouth just to watch Dean try and adjust, moaning and sending vibrations up Cas’s cock as he appears to like it a lot, if how hard his cock is is evidence.
In response, Dean just slides his tongue up Cas’s cock, and the angel settles back down with a groan.
in these clothes, and so it’s nice to see some skin as the blazer goes, then the tie, then the button-up. Most of these get put to the side, but on second thought, Dean holds the tie in his hands.
“I wasn’t- I wasn’t trying to-“ Cas starts, hands now hovering over Dean’s body like he’s not sure whether to keep beating Dean up or to help him up.
More moans spill from Cas’s mouth into Dean’s as Dean rubs and gropes at Cas’s cock, until he’s hard and panting into Dean’s mouth. It had been so long that Dean forgot how fucking
Cas tuts, pins Dean’s hips down a little more firmly before he waves the hunter’s clothes away, so his hard cock flops out against his abdomen. “C’mon,” he coos, tugs Dean up and settles him on the floor on his knees in front of the angel, positions him just right.
“The way the demon blood is working its way out of Sammy, I… don’t want the same to happen to you. I mean, I
because neither he nor Cas are actually
“S- sir?” It wasn’t something they’d tried before, and it almost makes Dean feel silly, a grown-ass man calling another- an
“Yes.”
Dean can’t even beg him to
Dean thrusts his thigh against Cas’s cock, now fully hard in his pants, to cut that sentence right off. He likes it when Cas gets mouthy, actually, but right now, his closer priority is making Cas come in his pants. Yeah. That’s the need that has just shot up to Priority #1.
There’s a moment where they’re both struggling for breath, taking a second to breathe, when Cas’s tongue flicks out to catch some of Dean’s come that had landed on his lips, and Dean groans out, “
At least, he thought he was, until his gaze lands on Dean standing near the bed, where he must’ve been in the process of changing, as he was only clad in a pair of jeans, abdomen on display for the world.
Cas frowns at the bulge in his pants, which Dean’s eyes had been carefully avoiding. “It wasn’t about… the scenario. I’m not interested in the pizza man or the babysitter. It was my vessel reacting to-“ Cas struggles for a second, words not quite working for him. Then he turns to Dean. “Is that something humans are really interested in? Being hit? As I understand it, that only happens when you’ve done something wrong. But the noises she was making…”
him, but he’s in for more shocks as suddenly there’s naked skin over him, Cas’s clothes wooshing away, and there’s a hand closing over the bulge his cock is making in the panties. Dean lets out a moan- the way Cas’s hand feels through the fabric is freaking amazing, and when he gives a squeeze, Dean arches up into the touch, clenching his hands in the bedsheets.
Cas frowns, annoyance melting and confusion taking its place. “What do you mean?”
Dean’s hand, and the skin-on-skin contact has him arching his back, gasping Dean’s name into the cool night air.
“Rafael can wait,” said in a rough voice is all the warning Dean gets before Cas is taking him by the arm to woosh them somewhere, and suddenly he’s on his back in a bed, Castiel on top of him on his hands and knees, looking down at him in almost curiosity.
Not that he’s complaining. He gets to sleep with beautiful women and then not have to do the whole
“Benny’s gone. I know you’re tense. And I need to sleep, but can’t. So come here,” Dean repeats, enunciating this time.
Dean swallows, his decision getting a lot easier. “Cas…”
Dean is a little baffled. He doesn’t remember mentioning anything bedroom-related during the build-up to that fight, because that would be a weird time to bring something like that up. “Okay?”
Dean is hesitant to get it wrong again, but also each time Cas slaps him, he can’t deny it makes his cock throb in his pants.
He knows Cas has had a little bit of time to get used to his vessel, but c’mon. The amount of
“Please…” Cas mutters, still hoarse, hips shifting restlessly as his cock has practically turned purple with need.
He’s hard.
They were down to just their bottoms, bare chests pressed against each other as Dean pressed a slow, sweet kiss to Cas’s lips. It was nice. But he wanted more. He wrapped his legs around Dean’s hips, tried grinding upwards to get Dean going, to get him to do what Cas wanted.
“Please, Dean, anything you want, just- touch me-“ Cas begs, hands tugging hard at the cuffs. It negates his angel strength, too, otherwise he’d be breaking the headpost with his need. At least, this time Dean listens,  releases the base of Cas’s cock long enough to attach his mouth to the head instead. His tongue flits over the slit, and it makes Cas groan Dean’s name, eyes rolling back at the sensation.
Cas swallows, seeing the change, but he goes to push Dean into the cabinet, hopefully get him still long enough to get his fingers on the demon’s forehead. Dean lunges and shoves Cas back, instead, then lands a punch on Cas’s jaw. The newfound demon strength is enough to hurt Cas, make his jaw twinge in pain, and now he’s the one thrown off his rhythm as Dean gets another punch on Cas’s jaw, then grabs his shoulders and lands his knee in Cas’s abdomen.
Then Dean is asking, “You want it?” through groans and pants, tugging at Cas’s hair when he doesn’t respond immediately. Cas moans at the touch, nodding the best he can with a cock in his mouth, his own throbbing needily in his pants at this point. Feeling Dean come in his mouth is one thing, but the sooner Dean comes, Cas gets to come.
“It- I want to make you happy,” and now Cas looks down to stare into Dean’s eyes, sincere.
“Stop- talking-“ Cas grits out, but Dean isn’t usually this… candid in bed. It makes his cock ache with need, and then his skin flushes with shame, like he actually likes this version of Dean.
that he groans, other hand clenching in the sheets next to Cas’s hips. He spreads the lube liberally, squeezing just a little bit before remembering
The second Cas can feel Dean’s teeth sink into his skin, Cas comes with a wail of Dean’s name on his lips, arching hard into Dean’s grip and cock spurting over his hand, over the mattress, making a mess. Dean feels the angel tighten around him, and the fucking
“You’re gonna need to ask a little nicer than that,” Dean tries to hide his smile, tugging on Cas’s hair lightly to see the angel’s eyes flutter in pleasure.
“Dean, I can’t- that’s not- please-“ And Cas doesn’t really know what he’s asking for anymore, pleasure overwhelming his (very human) brain and turning it to mush.
“Normally, I probably would’ve drawn this out, but I could tell how badly you wanted it,” Dean’s voice, dripping with condescension, echoes in the quiet of the room. “I would’ve stripped you of every piece of clothing you have, slowly, until you were begging for me to hurry up. Anyone ever tell you you’d look a lot cuter with a lot less clothes?”
So yeah, maybe he felt a little like he deserved it when Cas started beating him up.
in bed. But problematic, because he’s always on the road. And now that he knows all that shit is the work of cupid- well, a cupid? An angel? He’s had his personal life fucked with enough by angels that he can’t imagine getting marked to fall in love with someone. He knows he wouldn’t exist without them, as apparently they hooked up his parents, which is just a thought he can’t live with.
Even so, Cas wants more, Dean’s cock against his enough to make him come but not enough to satisfy him.
He walks into the bedroom, heads over to the bed, and without turning around, he can hear the door close behind him. So. Cas followed him in, then. Bobby’ll have to forgive Dean for fucking on his sheets. And in his house.
“I’m not completely cut off from heaven. I have my sources.”
“What did you call me?” Cas asks, voice quiet and dangerous.
, is begging for more as Dean thrusts hard into him.
“Please, Dean, I-“
It took a second for Cas’s words to get through the haze of pleasure in Dean’s brain, so he asked, “What?”
, Cas, you need to start warning me when you do that,” Dean groans, already mourning the loss of a post-coital sleep, especially since they now need to go summon an angel and possibly die. Cool.
Dean groans in response, sliding his hands down Cas’s abdomen slowly and tonguing his way back into the angel’s mouth, who moans and wraps his arms around Dean, sinking his fingers into his hair and tugging in a way that sends shocks right to Dean’s core. Just then, he shifts his hips in the right way so his hardened cock brushes up against Cas’s, and they let out simultaneous groans, Cas’s a little higher than Dean’s, and Dean is quickly realizing that they need to get this show on the road or it’s going to end a lot earlier than either of them like.
It appears next to them on the bed with Cas barely lifting a finger, and Dean lets go of his cock to grab it, making Cas groan and needily buck his hips, cock slapping against his stomach.
He mis-estimated.
would chafe his dick to hell and back. None are really catching his attention, until one does.
“Nuh uh, hands behind your back. No touching.”
If Dean were anyone else, he’d be trembling at the look on Cas’s face. As it is, this is Cas. Guy’s all puppy-eyes and sunshine until you piss him off. Which Dean might be doing right now.
“Dean?”
“Dean, please,” Cas begs, although he doesn’t know what he’s asking for. His wrists twist in their bonds, and while they both know how easily he could break out of the tie (he’s an
, for a little bit of resistance and to see that face Dean makes when he’s getting his cock sucked.
They’ve wasted enough time already, they know that, so Cas only lets them come down for a few seconds before he’s waving away the mess and tucking his cock away.
“I know you want to come,” Cas pants, tugging on Dean’s hair as he gets closer. “You don’t get to come until I do, got it?”
, please, Dean, I want- give me-“ Cas doesn’t even know what he’s asking for, eyes drifting closed and back arching to rub up against Dean.
Cas buries his face in Dean’s neck, where he had previously been making a mark. He starts making one right beneath it, attaching his lips and teeth and sucking hard, hoping to distract Dean enough that he can get his proposal out without a single sarcastic comment from the hunter.
He’s thinking he could probably get a better angle pushing Cas face-first over the hood as opposed to on his back like he currently is, followed immediately by the thought that Cas coming on the hood would

to Cas earlier flashes through his mind and now Mind Cas is sliding his hands from Dean’s shoulders to his pants, undoing them, getting down on his knees and sliding his mouth over Dean’s cock.
“Since I can’t really, uh, trust you around strangers, since apparently you’d prefer to read them their past than help them do their job, maybe- if we still have some time- we can find you someone who already knows you, to, uh-“ Dean is sweating. He’s sweating and seconds away from freaking blushing. “To… to, y’know.”
“It’s one of the simple pleasures of life, Cas. Gotta experience it at least once before you die. Like a good cheeseburger, or a nice glass of Scotch.”
“Oh, now you want it?” Dean asks, condescending. “Well, if you want it so bad, go ahead and beg for it.”
“Hey, just because we can’t sleep together, that doesn’t mean we have no options,” Dean smiles, more sultry now, as he moves off the cabinet towards Cas.
Dean spends at least a good minute teasing at the spot once he’s found it, just to watch Cas squirm and beg Dean to
Dean’s got a freaking boner.
The sudden dirty words- and the
“Cas,
. And sure, this is with Cas, but… this is with
Dean swallows nervously, but does nothing, eyes searching Cas’s, and he notices how dilated his pupils are, a thing ring of electric blue swimming in a sea of black. Cas takes Dean’s silence as permission and noses his way down his neck, breath puffing out against Dean’s collarbone as he brushes a thumb over the hand mark on Dean’s arm. He wasn’t lying when he told Dean the panties didn’t have the same effect on him as they had on the hunter, but seeing Dean actually
“I don’t think I can take that power nap now. Gotta keep moving,” Dean nudges Cas, plants a kiss on his cheek before helping him up, getting ready to go.
“Yes,” Cas says simply, not even trying to justify his curiosity. So sue him, he’s learning more and more about humans (Dean) every day, and wearing women’s underwear as… sexual play wasn’t something he’d seen coming.
“Again, I’m not that invested, but who do you have in mind?”
Cas’s moans spill into the night air, unfiltered, until he’s gasping, “Dean- please- I’m-
Of course, Dean didn’t

Cas settles in beside him, strokes a hand over the fading mark on Dean’s cheek. “You like to be slapped and also praised?”
“It wasn’t just meat Jimmy was craving. That was the main need, yes, but Famine… awakened another need,” Cas explains, turning away from Dean to avoid eye contact.
He didn’t anticipate the (all things considered light) slap to his cheek, which is odd, considering they had just been talking about it. He doesn’t even feel the sting at first, only registers when the sound had stopped echoing in the room.
and covered in bees?”
Dean pauses in what he’s doing, prompting a little whine and buck of the hips from Cas. “I don’t have- I don’t have any, uh-“
“You’re
He clears his throat, drawing Cas’s eyes to it, his Adam’s apple bobbing as he attempts to speak. He manages to get out, “Cas,” in an incredibly hoarse voice, considering he was speaking fine ten minutes ago. Dean really intended to try to work with the angel, figure out what was going on, but it seems Cas can’t help himself either and he suddenly finds himself with a lapful of angel, Cas looking down at him with too-bright blue eyes.
he knows is in-
And from this angle, Dean’s cock is pressed against Cas’s through the fabric, which makes Dean give a groan from where he’s attached his mouth once more to Cas’s collarbone. The vibrations travel through Cas, light a little fire at the base of his spine so he’s moaning out into the air now, forgetting that he’s at work and they’re in a tiny closet and he should definitely not be this loud.
Downstairs, Bobby has drunk himself into a stupor so he doesn’t have to hear anymore of those sounds.
“Cas. Hey,” Dean says, steadying himself and stopping a few feet from the angel.
He doesn’t expect to feel a hand gripping his arm, pulling him upright and propping him up against the wall. His everything groans in protest, but his eyes flutter open to catch Cas looking at him. Not in the eyes.
, and Cas is finally soft, settling down with his face in the crook of Dean’s neck, breaths puffing out against sweaty skin.
“No,” Cas growls, swinging his head back to connect with Dean’s, hitting him hard, and Dean releases Cas with a grunt of pain, so they’re back to square one, circling each other- now with marks around Cas’s neck, and an ache forming where Cas’s head got Dean in the nose.
And now that Dean was actually
Like sure, kept awake by nightmares. Woken up by monsters. Woken up by Sam having nightmares. Yeah. That, he’s used to.
It’s a soft, muted deep blue, with just the tiniest bit of lace trim, the material soft and satiny and slipping through Dean’s fingers in a way that he knows will feel great against his junk. He swallows, his throat dry. “This one.”
“Dean, it’s still- I still need, I want-“ Cas can’t get the words out, still out of breath but desperately trying to convey what he needs.
Dean misses the days when he got a full night of sleep. Well, at least a few hours. He doesn’t think he’s ever gotten like, a full night of sleep.  Probably never in his life.
“Don’t,” Cas grits out. “Don’t talk to me like you’re him. My Dean. You’re not him.”
Until Cas lands another slap on his cheek, this one harder than before, and Dean is moaning, feeling his cheek burn with the mark that was surely there.
But then Cas is moaning for
“Cas!”
“Take off the button-up. Slowly.”
The angle and pace have Cas biting down on his arm, trying to keep the wailing to a minimum as he’s railed into the floor. One of Dean’s hands finds his hair as the other finds his hip for leverage, and a groan rips out of the angel’s throat as the hand in his hair tugs his head back, forces him to let out his noises into the quiet room. Each thrust brings a moan, or a whine, or a moan of Dean’s name- which he tries to suppress, knowing the
“That’s just- just
, definitely on purpose, so Cas remembers exactly who he’s fucking.
whimpering noises as he experiences rimming for probably the first time.
Dean can hear their lips softly smack as he tilts his head, moves his mouth against the angel’s, curls his fingers in his hair to lightly tug on it. Then he feels one of Cas’s hands gripping his jaw, pulling him into the position he wants, kiss turning harsher until he’s biting down on Dean’s lip possessively, making Dean groan.
Cas gives distraction a last shot by grinding his hips against Dean’s, and thus his clothed cock against the other’s, but even that pleasure doesn’t last long as Dean chokes down a moan, and his other hand comes down to grip Cas’s hip, hold him in place.
have your naked ass on my baby,” Dean says, a warning. Of course, his love for his car is a little overshadowed by the fact that Cas is now
Another pause that seems to last an eternity, Dean sitting and sweating in his seat, fists clenched tight in the thighs of his jeans while Cas stares out his own window, not reacting.
- was a little silly. The hats, cute, but alright, classic cowboy hats. The top Sam had on, not his style, and the pants… eh.
“It doesn’t feel- demeaning?” Cas asks with a frown on his face.
Cas barely gets out a moan of Dean’s name before he’s arching his back like he’s been electrocuted and coming across Dean’s hand and his own stomach, and Dean follows quickly behind with a groan, the image of Cas coming apart under his hands perma-sketched in his mind for spank bank material.
Then reality comes crashing in, Dean letting Cas down and pulling away from his face, lust not clouding his vision anymore.

There’s a beat that lasts an eternity, a whirlwind of thoughts filling Dean’s head. How satisfying it is to feel Cas shut
against Cas’s ass, just to make the angel yelp before setting a pace that has them both moaning.
He turns, only to jump off his car, a good distance away from the sudden appearance of Cas. “Dude!”
“I’ve been around for thousands of years and we’ve waited long enough to get together, I think I have the right to be impatient,” Cas gets out through gritted teeth.
“What?”
Dean catches the angel staring at his abdomen, of course, and his grin widens. “Like the view? In fact, I remember that you do.”
“I- I’m-
“Dean,” drips from Cas’s mouth, broken and hoarse, and it’s sending Dean over the edge, groaning out Cas’s name as he splatters Cas’s abdomen with his come. He works himself through his orgasm, pleasure shooting through his body at the way the angel looks covered in his come, the shiny white streaks standing out on a pale abdomen.
, so I wasn’t gonna say
“Okay, you got uh, I need-“ he can barely get the words out, distracted by the downright filthy noises leaving Cas’s mouth as Dean slowly jerks him off. “
There’s a pause, where their breathing fills the air, and Cas can practically hear Dean’s pulse racing under his skin. Then Dean shifts his hips hungrily, and Cas presses his cheek against his cock, sliding his tongue up the side. The fabric is gross against his tongue, but it’s worth it for the noise Dean makes, bucking his hips up and groaning out Cas’s name.
“And he could hear everything you could hear.”
It’s then he looks up to see Cas giving him a
Cas waits, frozen in place, ready for Dean to just sink into him. When he feels Dean not moving, cockhead
- curling up next to a tree, back
Cas turns his face into the pillow before he whines Dean’s name, gives some breathy gasps. If he looks down, he could see his hard cock swaying with his movement, drops of precome dropping every time Cas shakes particularly hard. And while Dean’s tongue feels amazing inside of him, he wants
Dean chuckles, “You know, after all that, we didn’t even get you laid. All we have to show for trying to pop your cherry is some poor girl scared out of her mind.”
“I know what you want,” Dean growls, pausing his words to suck yet another mark onto Cas’s neck. “You want me to fuck you against the wall until you come, right? You want me to mark up your neck so everyone knows you’re taken. Bet your boss won’t try asking you out again once she sees you with hickeys all over.”
“Never say never, Cas,” Dean mutters into the pillow.
“So, uh,” Dean starts, tucking his cock back into his pants. “I’m guessing you don’t have any info on the leviathans.”
Although he’s not sure if he’d be able to against Dean.
“Hasn’t what? Eaten? Drank? You can tell me, man, I’ll get you whatever you need. Nice to be able to help someone right now,” Dean says with a shrug, the last bit mostly to himself.
“Dean?” It’s rare Castiel sounds so unsure, and Dean doesn’t think he likes that inflection in the angel’s voice. It makes him nervous.
“Cas! A little warning!” Dean complains, shifting up to lean on his elbows, feeling just a little vulnerable on his back underneath Cas like that but all it does is bring him closer to the angel’s face.
Cas frowns, pauses his squirming for a second, confused, before he looks down and oh. Uh.
It doesn’t work, though. Cas looked like he wanted to shove Dean up against the wall, and now that image is in his mind, the angel pinning him to the wall possessively, protectively-
He can feel Dean panting against the back of his neck, the barest of moans slipping past as he pushes harder against the angel’s ass. Dean was always a lot better at controlling his noises than Cas, years of experience and quickies versus Cas, alive for thousands of years but still not quite used to the pleasure overtaking his body when Dean touches him.
is making him lose his mind a little, and he jerks his hips just a little, just to make Cas buck his hips in surprise.
“You wouldn’t,” Cas groans, trying to tilt his head to get a look at Dean, maybe see the man he used to know, but when he looks, all he can see is the glittery black of a demon’s eyes.
“I want to try it,” Cas cuts through Dean’s complaining.
Dean’s fingers unclench from the chair and he wraps his arms around Cas’s waist, pulling him closer and flicking his tongue back against Cas’s. At this, Cas makes a low groan in his throat, shifting his hands on Dean’s shoulders to card through Dean’s hair, tonguing the roof of the hunter’s mouth. Dean feels the vibrations travel through his mouth and a bolt of heat laces down his spine, officially shutting down the Figure Things Out hunter part of him for at least until he gets to see Cas come crying his name. And
Dean opens his mouth to say something, but Cas leans in to kiss him, presses his lips hard against the hunter’s, tugging him closer by the overcoat. It’s only a little bit of a surprise to Dean, whose hands tighten around Cas’s wrists before sliding them up his arms, around his waist as he kisses the angel back. Cas must be eager, as he’s using the tricks Dean’s taught him, already sliding his tongue into Dean’s mouth to flick against his lips, teeth, tongue.
“Dean-“
coming from Cas’s mouth, and Dean can’t even respond right away, brain overwhelmed by the everything about it.
Cas’s hole clenching for something, and his underwear is off in a second, cock head pressed to the angel’s hole. Whether or not there’s enough lubrication is evidently unimportant to either of them, and although Cas (or Dean) might regret that tomorrow, Cas whines for Dean to
“Well, it’s-“ Cas pauses, and now he definitely looks uncomfortable. “Zachariah showed you a version of the future the other day, one in which the Croatoan virus had taken over the world.”
“Dean, please…” Cas begs, hands tugging at the cuffs and looking down at Dean.
It takes Cas a second to respond, breathing heavy, but he says, “I don’t know what that entails, but I trust you.”
Cas appreciates it, hands tightening in the sheets and whimpering out Dean’s name. It’s weird, but he’ll do it. For Dean.
“Shirt. Off. Go ahead and touch your chest. Don’t touch your cock.”
touch. Dean’s. He didn’t want to proposition him, not when he was so clearly suffering over his brother’s suffering, but the need wasn’t exactly going away.
Cas has learned from his mistake, underestimating Dean, and feints a swing at Dean’s head, throwing Dean off while he kicks him in the stomach instead, making him stumble backwards. Cas takes advantage to aim a punch at Dean’s face, and gets him in the nose, making that ache surely worse. Dean stumbles into the cabinet behind him, grin sliding off his face as his jaw tightens. A trickle of blood makes its way out of his nose, and he wipes at it, eyes narrowing as he shifts into game mode.
“The angel cuffs? Really?” Cas turns back to face Dean, incredulity written into his face, but in actuality he can feel his cock twitch in his pants when he realizes he
he’s feeling.
Dean- didn’t completely put out the fire of his anger.
And God, he knows it’s not the time, they’ve got bigger fish to fry, but it’s been so long because he’s been wrapped up in all this nonsense so sue him if he presses his palm to the beginning bulge in his jeans, tries to stave off the pleasure.
“Speaking of, how’s the body handling the famine effects? All that red meat can’t be good for your body, angel or not, right?”
The thought is put aside when Cas pushes back, says he’s happy working the gas station, and he won’t go with Dean to investigate the, uh… exploding people. But after a little convincing, and some puppy-eyes, Cas agrees, but first he has to clean up the bathroom.
“I know you like to go fast. But we’re gonna draw this out, nice and slow, so you know how to treat yourself when I can’t be there for you,” Dean explains, but it’s undercut by the way he pants and grips his own cock, showing no such reservations for going slow and letting it last.
And Dean has to acquiesce, carefully guiding his cock-
Just then, Cas starts making some funny hitching breath noises, cock twitching along with his hips. Dean realizes he’s getting close, so he pulls his fingers and tongue out, making the angel whine in disappointment.
Dean is losing track here.
. The thought dries his throat, and he’s flicking his tongue over his bottom lip, trying to spread the moisture.
“Want- please-“ Dean can’t even get the words out, muscles tightening as Cas works him closer.
Finally, his own cock is so hard it hurts, watching Cas make the dirtiest noises and cutest pleasure-faces, and so he slides his fingers out (pulling just the
“Yes. Then we can talk to him about God,” Cas replies, monotone and no-monkey-business as usual.
It works, and Cas groans, head hitting the shelves behind him, eyes fluttering shut.
“It’s likely, yes.”
It’s why Dean has to cover his mouth, he knows that, and Dean can feel the vibrations as Cas’s moans get steadily louder while Dean jerks him off. Dean squeezes the head of his cock as he hisses in the angel’s ear, “Quiet down, they’re gonna hear.”
- to Cas’s hole, before carefully pushing in, and it’s like there’s
- and hovers above him, watching Cas’s reaction as the corner of his mouth twitches.
Dean frowns. Okay, maybe he definitely said something like that. “So what, you want to slap me? Wear a zorro mask? Bring in a third? What?”
The whole trying to survive together put that issue aside, though. Mostly. Just until they got out of Purgatory, and
Dean hooks his arms under Cas’s thighs to pull his hips closer, pressing the lump in his pants to Cas’s cock, and the denim against his bare skin
“Things have never been clearer for me, Dean. We are as God made us, and if you want me, you can have me,” Cas offers, his tone a little lower now, a little more sultry, and when Dean looks down, he can see the evidence of the angel’s interest in his starting-to-stiffen cock.
“You work out your Famine needs?” Dean asks, barely a whisper, on the edge of unconsciousness.
“Don’t like waiting, do you?”
He shoves down these thoughts to sit up, turn to find Castiel sitting on the end of the bed. “What, you get your freak on by watching other people sleep?”
Cas is during sex, just unfiltered and unabashed, and Dean is realizing that kissing Cas to shut him up wasn’t doing the trick- a problem when they need to remain undiscovered.
He undoes his pants with the other hand, tugs just far enough to get his half-hard cock out, squeezes the base a few times. Cas’s eyes lock onto it, and Dean tugs his head back just to eye his neck, the way it strains to follow Dean’s hand.
He feels the bed dip, and when his eyes open, he sees Dean has taken a seat at the foot of the bed, hand now stroking his cock- Cas didn’t even see him take it out. He whines, misses the touch of Dean’s skin to his, but he can’t get the right sentiments out, opting for moans and Dean’s name instead. He grasps at his cock through his underwear, does his best to stroke it, jerk off and work himself up.
“Really? Because your body is telling me another story,” Dean nips at Cas’s jaw, grinding just that harder against the other to make a point about how hard he was- and not flagging, even at the mention of danger. “You think it’s hot. Getting caught like this, weak and willing for me, I bet you’d do anything to get me to let you come at this point-“
He stops by the bed and then turns around, Castiel a hair’s breadth away. Dean doesn’t think he minds Cas’s lack of personal space now, though.
And to hear Sam’s screams, his cries for help, all
His internal monologue cuts off as he lands on the mattress next to Cas, eyes closed in residual pleasure but probably mostly so he doesn’t have to face his best friend. Cas waves the mess away with a tired hand before lying down facing Dean, eyes tracing the curves of his face, much more relaxed now.
“C’mon, man, I gotta- I gotta prepare you-“ Dean starts but Cas cuts him off with a wave of his hand, and now Dean can feel open air against his cock, and yeah his underwear is gone, and now that Dean looks down, he can see Cas’s
Dean inhales sharply, pupils dilating quickly. “Cas…”
From there, instinct takes over, and he fucks Cas hard, giving it to him like he wants-
Cas obediently slows down, letting each button slip free of its hole more carefully, slowly revealing more and more pale skin, his hard nipples, the little strip of hair leading down to the now more prominent bulge in his pants.
want his little brother walking out to this. He figures he’s teased enough, so he pulls his fingers out to swiftly replace them with his cock before Cas can complain, and as he presses in Cas lets out this long, low moan, until Dean is completely inside him and he gives a little sigh, content.
!” Cas suddenly cries out, back arching and hips thrusting back down to meet Dean’s hand.
Cas shifts uncomfortably, and Dean’s eyebrows lower into a frown.
Dean pauses a moment, plants a relatively chaste kiss on Cas’s thigh, before sinking his teeth in to create a mark and curling his finger at the same time. He can feel Cas squeeze around him as he lets out a startled moan, and God, Dean can’t wait to get in there.
Cas bites his bottom lip and frowns. “I could just touch your forehead and put you to sleep.”
“It’s… been a while for my vessel. Since I possessed him, he hasn’t…” Cas seems to almost be choking on his words.
Not with Cas.
. He uses the precome beading at the head, swipes his palm over it, spreads the best he can down his cock, lubricating the way and making him groan as quietly as he can. Mind Cas is looking up at him as he licks his way down Dean’s cock, pink lips stretched wide around the middle and getting closer and closer to the base.
He’s moaning around Dean’s cock, getting
Dean sighs. “You get hard?”
, before he’s acquiescing and moving a hand from the angel’s hip to his cock, and fuck, he’s soaked his stomach
Dean shivers, only taking a moment to think about it. “Yeah. Yeah, if you want to.”
Anyway.
What would usually happen is Dean would press Cas to the bed, try and take their clothes off slowly, but Cas would wave them off, not giving Dean the chance to unveil that skin piece by piece. Dean would shake that off, though, and try taking his time, kissing slowly down his body, leaving nips here and there. At least, until Cas got impatient, and either pushed Dean to finally suck his cock or fuck him, or rolled them so he was on top and used Dean until they both came.
“Well, only because you were so good for me earlier,” Cas acquiesces, starts really setting up a pace as he works himself closer to orgasm.
- I’m gonna-“ and Cas isn’t letting up, sliding down and nose pressing against Dean’s abdomen for just a moment before sliding back up. And his throat tightens just the perfect amount as he’s moaning out what sounds suspiciously like Dean’s name and spurting come into the fabric of his shorts. It’s the darkening of the fabric while Cas makes the cutest o-face around Dean’s cock that has him tightening his hand in Cas’s hair while he leans hard against the wall, groaning Cas’s name while he comes down the tight vice of the angel’s throat, feeling Cas swallow around him before pulling his cock out, the last spurts of come landing so prettily on his mouth and cheeks.
