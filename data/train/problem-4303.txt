Dean whines at Castiel’s demanded direction and realizes that Cas is leaving the room. “I’ll be right there, Dean.”
Once all the kids find their way back to the tables one by one, Alex glares at Dean and Cas. "You need something?"
Dean's mother died. He remembers her and misses her, but there aren't billions of great memories. He defiantly had it rough. His dad, a totally emotional wreck, would leave on long weekends when Dean was going into his teen years. He kept his secret love rendezvous a secret. Until he came home one day and told the boys to get in the car and come out to meet his fiancé and son. Dean hated it. But he couldn't hate his dad, so instead he shook his dad's hand in congratulations and met their son, Adam, and then took his dad's car and drove off with Sammy in the passenger seat back home.
Castiel cuddles into Dean’s arms when he starts the Lord of The Rings, hugging Castiel to his chest under a thin blanket.
Dean wants to wrap his arms around Castiel. Any time he talks about his brother, he can't help but feel terrible. If anything happened to Sammy, Dean would be a wreck. Instead Dean stretches his shoulders out, "man, all me and my brother did was listen to our Walkman and put spoons in each others mouths when one fell asleep."
Dean coughs into his shoulder and wipes his eye, "you didn't do anything." He sees the man's eyes fall in shame. "Don't worry, you did nothing wrong." Dean wants to reassure him but he doesn't know how to prove it without explaining himself. "When I was a kid my mom died. It was only my dad, brother, and I. My dad tried so hard, he raised us the best he could, but he took her death hard. And just a few years ago he passed away. Family is everything to me. But when you don't have one- not a whole one, it just feels-" Dean chokes out his words and sighs. "It just feels weird. But I love my family, those remaining."
Mary picks up Sam and motions for Dean and Cas to climb into the wagon. "Here boys, you can relax a little bit. I’ll carry Sammy.” She looks between both of their down faces. “Are you okay? Was he mean to you? Are you hurt?”
Castiel walks over to Gabriel and the parents table. He smiles and Gabriel laughs, "what did the girls kick you out of the table?" He shrugs, "something like that."
“If there is a giant shark, we aren't much safer on a boat then in the water either. But for your sake, we can just lay out for now. I wasn't boring, so I do get kisses, Winchester.”
She nods him along and he bites his inner cheek. “I broke up with him because he didn’t want to come out. I mean I thought I gave him a lot of time. It was so close to a year. Thought he’d want to meet my friends and family. He didn’t think it was a good idea and… it just hurt. But I love him. And I want to be able to heal but it’s so hard. Especially because I feel like I betrayed him.” He plays with his hands and laughs sadly, “does this make me a bad person? Not sticking with him? I feel like I should have tried harder but it just… it was so painful to hide this part of me.”
Dean finds Cas and Charlie. Charlie is too busy talking to one of the female bartenders and Cas is sitting on one of the sofas by the bar. “Hi, Dean.” Dean plops down next to Cas on drunk legs and lays his head on Castiel’s shoulder.
He looks at the cake and his eyes widen, “shit. Happy birthday, Cas!” Cas throws his arms around Alfie's shoulders and pulls his body to his chest. Alfie turns his face to wink at Cas, “you’ll get your birthday present later.”
Another woman walks over and smiles, spraying her hands down and wiping them up with tissues. "Don't worry, they're only small scrapes. Nothing to worry about." Castiel thanks her and hugs Claire to his slide.
Dean moans through each cheesy bite and keeps thanking Cas for his sacrifice. Going off Castiel’s smiles- he at least doesn’t feel like a complete dick from keeping Cas from a good meal. Despite how healthy it looks- Castiel looks content and that’s what matters.
Dean stretches Castiel open with wet fingers, taking his time to slide in farther, trying to do it as gently as he can. Castiel moans when Dean's finger scratches against his prostate. "Dean!" Castiel's hair is a sloppy mess, falling in front of his eyes. "Dean," Castiel chants again.
Alastair blocks their way again and smiles. "Listen up boys, you're going to go collect some candy for me and then you're going to meet me back here and hand it over. You got it?"
Castiel coughs and walks over moving the pictures into a box. “No. Meg and I split up a couple years ago. We met in college and she was my first of a lot of things. But it was all wrong.” Castiel looks at the picture another time and looks like he's going to be sick. “I'm gay. It just wasn't fair to her.”
Castiel’s favorite game to play is monster hunters. Dean and he have been playing this game since they first heard about ghosts in first grade and they ran with the idea. Eventually, they added other spooky creatures and Cas even declared himself as an 'Angel of the Lord.' Dean laughed super hard at him for that line but it never fails to make Castiel happy.
Dean wipes the tears leaking into the corners of Castiel's crows feet. “I hope those are happy tears,” Castiel nods quickly and laughs trying to wrap his head around the reality of this. Dean loves him as much as Cas loves Dean. “I love you, you angel. My angel.”
Dean made the excuse that Aaron had a family emergency so he was leaving. His family gave him suspicious looks but tried to refocus on Cas and his boyfriend. Dean excused himself and has been sulking in his bedroom. Sam comes up to join him and eyes him until Dean starts talking.
Castiel rubs his hand down Dean's shoulder to his wrist, keeping strong eye contact while he makes Dean's arm hair raise. "Not yet."
John smiles, “I know I have a lot to learn about you, Dean, but I know you’re never one to just give up on something because it’s too hard.”
The girls all sit up straighter and zone in on the two and he sees Cassie hold back a frown off to his side.
Benny walks by Dean and turns around like he’s going to say something and Cas raises his eyebrow and scolds, “don’t.” Benny nods his understanding and leaves the two in the hallway.
Castiel lays his hand on Dean's shoulder and smiles. "Thank you." He pulls his hand back down to his side and back ups when he hears Claire, Emma, and the other girls come racing back over. Claire isn't smiling, but she isn't frowning either, and that's an accomplishment. "You want to get on the bus, Claire?" Claire nods and tugs at Castiel's sleeve.
Dean gives Cas an origami book and a tiny chess set so his friend can practice more and teach him, like they’ve talked about. Cas is gleeful opening the two and hugs Dean in thanks. Dean opens Castiel’s gifts next and laughs opening a Han Shot First poster. He’s admiring the artist's detail and then Castiel hands him another smaller box. Inside, Dean sees a tiny gold charm on a long necklace loop. He smiles at Cas and asks, “a bee?”
Castiel laughs and watches as Alfie pulls himself out of bed. “Hey baby,” he comes over and kisses Castiel before looking at Dean and fist bumping him. “Hey Dean. What brings you here so early?”
Castiel rubs his fingertips over every inch of Deans face. “You're beautiful.” When Castiel is finished tracing circles against Dean’s skin, he opens his eyes.
Dean pushes his way in and tries to pull Cas into his arms. “What are you talking about, Angel? Please explain it to me,” he feels each of his own blinks send over a waterfall of tears.
Castiel wipes the tears from his face, looking at his best friend stare down the older boy. Dean isn’t going to let anyone make Cas look so upset. Ever. Over his dead body.
Dean rolls his shoulders and smirks, “yeah we'll see. If you're the captain what would that make me then?”
Emma laughs and high fives Castiel, while she manages to get all three of the others chanting "ooh burn!"
With each quick moan of Dean's name, he feels himself getting harder each second. “Cas- you're so- Cas you're so beautiful.” Dean grips his arms around Castiel's shoulders, pulling his chest closer to his. “Faster, Cas. I'll be okay, I promise. I want this. I want you.”
Dean perks up at that but figures it’s the plug. Because that’s one hell of a surprise already. There can’t be more. Right?
Cas stares at Dean on the verge of tears and Dean sighs. “I’m sorry. I don’t know why I’m upset. Just… hearing you and seeing… I don’t know what to say. You’re right. You can do whatever you want.”
Lisa blushes and gives him a hug. “I have to get going. Performance timeeee!” She goes to sing out. Bela grabs her bag to follow her and Anna gives Dean a wink before she grabs her sketchbook to take off for class.
He strolls down the block and hugs himself to find warmth in the wind. The one day he leaves his leather at the house and goes out, nearly naked, in a black AC/DC T-shirt. “Son of a bitch,” he whispers to the wind nipping at his skin.
Max kisses him with need and spins Cas against the door of the stall. Locking it as he kisses Castiel’s neck. Cas feels tingly and realizes Max is cupping him through his jeans. He groans and lets his head hit the door behind and Max goes back to kissing Cas with need. Max unzips his jeans and does the same for his own. Time seems to race because Cas doesn’t know how they keep getting from point A to B.
Cas sinks to his knees in front of Dean, and kisses his way up his legs and then jerks Dean’s joggers down to the ground. He gives feather light touches on Dean’s skin and brings Dean to the edge before even palming at Dean’s cock.
Dean looks up and his eyes bulge. Why is a man sitting across from him? Does he know him? "Yeah- nice to meet you," he says. He watches the corners of Castiel's mouth turn up and he relaxes. Okay, sure, maybe Dean doesn't know why this man is sitting here, but a part of him is glad. He is a sight.
So here they find themselves. Castiel getting a lap dance from a toned male stripper and giggling like he’s a child on Christmas morning. Alfie looks at the scene with a face Dean can’t read. Can’t tell if the guy is pissed, into it, or just confused why Cas is here in the place.
Hannah’s face is red and Cassie frowns. “We’re both girls. You’re saying that if you all landed on another boy you’d kiss them? Ya right. Doesn’t seem fair.”
And because their moms always know everything about their moods from their faces- they shoo the men away and wish the two a good birthday night. Mary gives Dean a quick wink that makes Dean groan and hang up before Naomi has a chance to be any more humiliating.
Castiel’s voice trembles, “I can’t do this. I’ve waited, Dean. I want you to feel comfortable but I can’t just wait for you.” His nose drips strands of snot as he whimpers. “It’s humiliating me! I know why you can’t just come out but it doesn’t change how it makes me feel. Watching Lisa, Anna, Bela or any other girl just cling to you all the time. And you don’t do anything about it!”
Cas giggles and holds Dean’s hand. “It counts.” He kisses their joint hands, “if it makes you feel better, I kinda did too.”
Mary looks shocked and Sam laughs. “Dude, I think I already knew.” He then follows up with, “besides it doesn’t matter. My friend Gilda is a lesbian. And she’s dating this girl Dorothy right now. I think she’s bi. Or pan.”
Emma smirks and rolls her eyes, "sorry." She quickly takes off again, laughing to one of her friends. Dean wants to pull his hair out. His girl is a pain in the ass. Sure, he loves her, but he admits the difficulty that comes with raising her.
Dean squeezes in between Castiel and another mother, Ruby. Her eyes are glaring. If she didn't look so pissed off, Dean would've said she looked attractive. Gabriel hands sandwiches to both Dean and Cas, "here. Eat up. They were short lunches so I had to pay for some more." Dean laughs at that.
He’s typing a paper for his creative writing class when he feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around and faces a girl in all black and leather. “Dean is it? Hi, I’m a friend of Castiels.”
A guy in Dean’s bio class, Victor, shouts Dean over to watch but he pretends to miss it and quickly walks out to find some other friends. So much for getting back with Anna.
As much as Dean never wants this feeling to end, he knows his body can't handle much more. At least for now. So he takes Castiel in his hand, jerking his hand over Castiel’s cock as he pounds behind him. “Cas, Cas. Cas, I love you, fuck. I love you so much,”
Emma groans, as flattening her hair on her head. "Dad, we need to leave. If we're late, the bus is leaving without us."
Castiel was the only name on the will. Every belonging was left in his name, even their kid. But he's not going to bring her back to that house. Not now at least. She has said she doesn't want to step a foot in there again. Now it's all the matter of getting himself to go over there during an off day.
Castiel reaches his hands across the table and he holds them in a grip onto Dean's. "I am so sorry. You have your brother, right?" He watches a spark in Dean's mood and he grips back to Castiel's hands.
Dean blushes, "so girls, when I was sick, Cas had to help me. When he walked up behind me though, I ugh, jumped. I- um, I hit him in the throat. Yeah, that works." Dean laughs, "so hitting him left a bruise. Like they do."
Dean looks between his parents and brother and lowers his voice to respond. “I uh- I like women still, I just like men more. Maybe. Or at least I loved Cas more.”
to her. Dean doesn’t know what she means but figures it’s about his and Castiel’s kiss. Dean tries to tell her it meant nothing and it was just a game, but when she says, “Dean, it’s either Castiel or me. You choose,” Dean doesn’t let the moment skip a beat before he says ‘Castiel.’ Like that would ever be a hard question to answer.
“This… this can’t be real.” Cas feels Dean grip his hand harder but it’s like no amount of feeling could bring him back to reality. “Dean why would you do this? What if Sam finds out and tells your parents… you didn’t have to do this!”
Castiel brings his mom's attention back to Balthazar and she looks far less excited but exchanges pleasantries. She calls Dean back over and gives him a casserole dish. “Would you bring this in, hun?” Dean solutes and winks at her. ‘Anything for you, Naomi.’
“Are you kidding? Watch his eyes, Alex. They’re totally focusing on his lips every other two seconds.” Claire points discreetly and turns back to facing her friends.
“I promise.” Cas answers, yet feels terrified. He needs to see Dean say it. He needs to see Dean look him in the eye and say that he’s not interested. That Castiel being in love with him is pushing him away. He needs to see this so Cas can stop hoping in the back of his mind that anything could ever come of the two. “Can you please just look at me?”
The plan was pretty simple. Cas and Dean would talk to some people and Cas would have some drinks. Dean was hoping to chat with his on and off again ex girlfriend, Anna. Hoping to get a New Years kiss from it. Castiel told Dean he was making a mistake with that one, but when Dean brought up who Castiel’s mystery date was, Cas dropped the subject and changed the topic back to how Dean plans to get Anna back. Again.
Cas feels his eyes being overthrown by tears and he tries his best to blink the obvious pain back. “It doesn’t matter anymore.” Just as he tries to convince himself, he sees the boy from his art class, Aaron, walk by and yell over to one of the Dean fan club groupies. And okay, Lisa isn’t awful. And Anna has had her kind moments. They’re not terrible people. But they can flirt shamelessly and publicly with the one person who promised Cas a lifetime. A lifetime of hiding and repressing, obviously.
“I will be fine, I promise you won't hurt me.” Dean grins sincerely and watches as Castiel's face remains concerned. “Okay, fine, I'll get myself off,” Dean laughs slowly rubbing his hand over his cock. His breath hitches and he closes his eyes. When he feels Castiel's body weight shift onto him, he doesn't open his eyes. But when he feels a small slick circle be placed against his nipple, his eyes flutter open. He sees the top of Castiel's head as he continues to lick over him. God dammit.
Castiel hugs himself into Dean and laughs, "it's just me now. I couldn't let you go so easily. You are a righteous man. I don't know why, but you're a very likable person." He rushes his words and hopes each come across. Because they are honest. "I like you, Dean."
Except for the one time that the two never speak of. The time when Cas left from classes forty minutes earlier than usual and walked in on Dean fucking himself on a pink glittery dildo. The two compared their schedules and wrote them down on a board after that. And promised the other that if they were ever coming back early that they would call and knock before entering their shared space.
Claire looks at her teacher and the art teacher and how close they are sitting. Her teacher's wink following is evident enough.
Dean laughs and agrees. “I promise you, I’m getting better. I want to be someone who makes him proud. And even if he won’t have me back… I’ll make myself keep proving myself to him everyday.”
Dean nods and winks. Why did he have to wink? Fuck. He watches Castiel's cheeks flush rose petal red. He can't help but fall into a trance staring at Cas. He feels far too happy to be looking at him. It's not like he's naked, he's fully dressed. Oh god. What would Castiel look like naked? Would his skin glisten when he's pressed against his bed? What sounds would he make? Would they vibrate down his throat if Dean kissed him?
Krissy and Claire start tugging onto his coat asking him if he could hurry up. That's when he blurts out, "I could lick that." Staring at Cas has left him speechless. Dean has no other choice than to stumble his words and point at the ice cream cooler. "Yeah, girls, how about getting some cones?" He realizes the red creeping up Castiel's neck and he smiles. The two watch the girl's race over to line up and Castiel laughs, whispering closer to Dean's ear, "I could go for a giant cone." Dean coughs loudly and feels his eyes widen.
Their friends arrive before the party starts in full swing. Benny showed up first. And it made Dean happy because Benny is one of the few friends he has that Cas also genuinely gets along with. The three of them are laughing as they play air hockey until Inias and Cole show up relatively close together. Cas breaks to talk with Inias and eat snacks, so Cole takes over Castiel’s place at the air hockey table.
Dean sees Cas all but bolt inside the building so he gives it a minute before he needs to get inside himself. Thank god for college courses and only needing to meet for lectures once a week. This particular one. Any more than that and Dean might actually need hospitalization. From something as terrible as his chest cracking open and crushing his heart in the process... or his own mental will going completely down the drain.
Cas and Dean get changed at Dean’s house. They both look at each other in surprise by their choice of outfit. Cas has on black jeans, a black t-shirt, and red leather jacket. The jacket was this year's Christmas gift from Dean and Cas would love to never take it off. Dean on the other hand is sticking to his typical jeans and green Henley.
Despite his fears, he lets his mom drop him off at the school and leave him there. He immediately meets up with Dean there. Dean complains about needing to pee before they meet their girlfriends so Cas awkwardly follows him. He doesn’t want to meet up with the girls completely alone. Dean pees and then looks at Cas while he’s washing his hands. “It’ll be fine, Cas. I can feel your panic from over here.”
Aaron clearly didn’t know it was Dean because he jumps and pulls back to do a double take of his roommate. “Uhh sorry…” he looks around behind them, “my friends told me to come over here… I didn’t realize…” he goes to stand and Dean insists he stays. “Okay. I just don’t want to creep you out being here.”
Castiel's voice hums along to the song and Dean smiles, letting the voice of an angel be the only thing he listens to.
"Before you ask and push blame, no Sammy said nothing. Maybe if you want to go incognito you shouldn't leave hickeys on someone's throat. Kind of obvious."
Dean quickly paces to the bathroom and let's the sink water drizzle in a small stream and he quickly cleans his face off and he swishes a cup full of Castiel's mouth wash. He would like to think he's doing Cas a favor here. Luckily, he can handle high amounts of liquor and not be completely gross the next day.
After he came, he doesn't pull out at first. He lays his head down onto Dean's chest and let's Dean suck onto his neck.
Dean wants to lie and keep living as normal but anytime someone asks him that question he loses it. “Mom… I met someone,” he starts. He sees her eyes light up and then slowly drop, “we broke up and I…” Dean gets far enough before Mary pulls him into her arms and whispers her sorries.
They open the door and Cas startles in the doorway at the figure sitting on the side. Benny notices and the two of them both ask, “Dean?” at the same time.
"Emma, what do we say?" The green eyed man stops a few feet away from Castiel and stares down. Emma smirks and shrugs. "Emma, you're old enough to know what I mean. I told you to stop running. Say you're sorry."
"Dean- oh Dean-" Castiel's hips keep arching themselves each time Dean's mouth wraps down farther. Dean is finally able to get a technique down and a steady rhythm to bob his mouth to. His own dick is leaking with precome and all Castiel has done so far is pull his hair and fuck into his mouth, on Dean's desire. Dean gets a good five or six more mouthfuls in until Castiel lets out a loud moan of sputtered words. So many words seem to build together that it almost sounds like a different language. Dean feels a river of semen trail down his throat and he swallows a mouthful. A bit leaked out of the corner of his mouth and he wipes it onto his finger before he licks it clean.
They stop at a few homes, still. Sam and Gabe stay behind for most because they’re too focused on showing each other candy in the wagon.
Dean would feel mortified if anyone he loved ever had to sit through his montage of Castiel and him aging together, but he sees Castiel and feels warm. He rubs his eye before anyone sees and excuses himself. It’s one thing to see a cute picture of toddlers having fun on a playdate. It’s innocent and perfect. But it’s another thing when Dean has to see how the photos change and how different Dean starts to look at his friend. How he goes from innocence and friendship to a look of love. And Dean can’t pretend that he’s going to fall in love with anyone else because he’s completely gone on Castiel.
Dean wants to hug this woman. She's put up with him the entire time. Offered him a ride when it's already too early for most normal people to be up. “No, but thank you. And thanks for not kicking me out. Sorry if I was any trouble.”
Cas feels a ping of sadness that she left him; just like someone else, but he’s not thinking of that right now. Instead he faces Max and holds his waist as he starts up dancing again. Max is happy for the turn of events and starts to grind down harder.
Castiel huffs and shakes his head staring into Dean's eyes. He kisses Dean again, this time gentler.
Despite pulling into his family's driveway and watching as Mary runs down the steps to greet him- he can barely force out a smile. Because being at home reminds him he’s not with Cas. And not being with Cas reminds him that he screwed up and lost the best damn thing he had. His parents didn’t even meet the guy; or even know about him, and now he’s about to shatter this weekend when they all have to witness heartbreak Dean for the first time.
Cole spins the bottle and it lands on Cassie. Dean straightens his posture and Cole just chuckles, “down boy, it’s just a kiss.” Thankfully the kiss was short and neither of them seemed to be into it so Dean felt relief.
Cas pulls him closer and kisses his neck and gasps as he feels him unzipping his pants. “Eager?” The other boy hums and continues getting his and Castiel’s pants loosened so they can get to the good stuff. “You look pretty good yourself.”
“I guess I’ll act like one if I’m being fucked like one.” He laughs and swats what Dean can only imagine is Benny’s own flesh. What part? He doesn’t want to know. “Come on, I promised Dean I’d be back downstairs by midnight so we can celebrate.”
Castiel shrugs, "I have a rather extensive family. My dad wasn't around much. He is a great man, he is a director of some fancy corporation. I don't recall ever even seeing him. My mom, she's controlling. She tried to force me into a certain lifestyle. It took her a while to realize she was suffocating me. She claims I was too rebellious growing up. I believe I did what was right. And I have six siblings; Michael, Gabriel, Anna, Hannah, Samandriel, and Tessa. It's a lot to handle sometimes."
John makes a joke about how Dean could still impress some ladies; and then coughs and says ‘maybe some fellas,’ if he wanted to offer anyone some work on their car. Dean blinks at the slight recognition from his dad and feels a ping of anger.
When Castiel bends over onto the ground to tie Alex's shoes, Dean spots the small back of Castiel's skin where his shirt rolled up. His back, from what it looks like, has lean muscles gliding over his soft tanned skin. Dean begun dozing off, thinking about sinking his tongue into Castiel's rear, licking him open.
Dean whistles and the girls look up and slowly walk over. All of them laughing and whispering amongst each other.
Cas gulps. Well here it is. The moment Dean has to break Castiel’s heart. He knows it’s coming by the way Dean blinks back tears and shakes his knees. How his hands twitch in his lap as he pulls the strings of his bracelet.
Castiel points at Claire and Emma, sitting two rows ahead of them. "So the kids going to date crash?"
Cas doesn’t even realize he’s been daydreaming about Dean and their first time. Leaving class on Friday, after Dean was typing downright filthy things to Cas. Usually Cas would tell him to pay attention and deal with blushes the rest of the day- but this time he could feel the words and love behind them. His cock was twitching in his pants and he made Dean all but run back to Castiel’s dorm with him to fuck. The two taking turns with handjobs, blowjobs, and finishing the night with Cas fucking into Dean and watching the boy he loved (loves) spill onto his own skin. He grips Max’s shoulder and groans. “Fuck, fuck.” His eyes are still squeezed shut and he smacks the stall wall. “Fuck, Dean, Dean,” his come is coating over Max’s hand and Max just chuckles and grabs toilet paper off the roll next to them.
The night of the dance comes far sooner than Cas would have liked it to. He had a week to prepare, but the evening is here and he’s got no clue how to go about dancing, dressing, or as Dean told him- kissing.
The bus ride back seemed to drag on forever. Maybe it was just because Dean and Castiel both felt equal holes in their chest. Someway, it could turn out to be the one that got away. What if a week from now Castiel can't go out? What if Dean in the next few days realizes he would rather date someone else? And vice versa.
Cas sits down over Dean’s waist and plays with his nipples. Dean rolls his hips upwards trying to meet skin.
He’s going on and on. Which halts Dean’s thoughts. Now that Dean thinks of it, he’s done most of the talking tonight. He stops mid sentence and shakes his head, “jeez, I don’t want to be the only one talking up a storm. Stop me at any point, man. I don’t mean to,”
Castiel nods enthusiastically, “look, I’ve got one too. Mines silver.” He looks to be reading Dean's reaction and Dean just brushes their shoulders and he grins. “I love it. Can you help me get it on?”
"My mom loves tigers." Castiel looks at the animal. The price tag is dangling off of it. The original price of 30 dollars is marked over with dark red marker that reads $24.99.
Dean feels his stomach warming and he shakes his head, he sets down the sandwich and gulps. "Sorry Cas, I'm not hungry. Could you excuse me?" He almost runs from his seat to the bathroom doors.
Mr. Milton makes a joke that leaves Mr. Winchester cackling and swatting at his arm, “oh you get outta here, man. Shoo now.” Mr. Winchester turns back to the class and claps his hands loudly. “Before being rudely interrupted for expo markers;” he yells loud enough for Mr. Milton to hear on his way out, “we were going to start our presentations. Claire, Alex, Krissy? Get on up here and blow me away with some Audre Lorde research.”
Claire laughs. A honest true laugh. "That'd be terrible!" Emma nods and then points toward another section before taking off. Castiel will not start to tear up. Dear God, send help. Cas hasn't heard anything genuinely happy come from Claire in the longest time. Dean walks over with a grin from ear to ear.
He groans to himself and scowls at his friend. “Fine. I’ll go.” Before either has time to look too happy about this agreement he finishes, “but Meg you have to go with. And I’m not dating the friend of your date. I may not even try to be polite.”
He’s never felt great when he overhears people talking about him. He will always think it’s unpleasant before he even knows what the topic is.
"So, Cas, maybe we could do this again?" Dean raises his eyebrow hoping Castiel gets the hint. But he also hopes Castiel doesn't think sex is all Dean wants. Sure that'd be fun, but really being with someone would also. Dean feels light headed thinking about what it would be like if things go well between them. He'd have to tell Emma.
Dean nudges her arms with his fist. “No problem. Kinda didn’t tell anyone. Fucked it up with Cas and I want to make it right.” Lisa looks excited for him and she sticks around to keep talking. At some point Cassie must have stormed off because she’s no longer staring invisible blades at him. And Meg must have left but Dean did meet her hopeful eyes once he spoke Castiel’s name to the girls here.
The two argued at Castiel’s home for hours and Naomi called Dean’s parents to alert them of their boy's fight. After both boys parents talked them down, and tried to make their own child see the other side of it, the boys made up and Cas gave Dean his final answer of where he wanted to go. With Dean.
“Sam… I,” he tries to speak. Tries to tell him ‘it wasn’t a woman. It was a man and I loved him,’ but no words form and he lets his body slump into bed with the shredded scraps.
Dean slides his fingers out slowly, watching Castiel's eyes bulge then slowly close. Dean licks his tongue over Castiel's lips and he slowly traces his tongue to Castiel's nipples. He rolls his tongue against them, taking the tip into his mouth with a small bite. Dean extracts a loud chant from Castiel that sounds foreign. Fuck if that's not the hottest of sounds.
Because it’s clear that it’s Dean’s turn to sit back in shock, Castiel throws his body forward so he’s practically sitting in Dean’s lap as he grabs his jaw with both hands. He kisses desperately until Dean realizes the truth of Castiel’s admission. He grabs Castiel’s hips and pulls Cas fully on top of him as his body falls back onto the bed. Between their shared elation the kiss grows needier. Dean’s letting Cas grind down on top of him as the two groan out their love for each other.
John kisses Mary on the cheek and wheels in a rainbow cloth wagon. "Just make sure no moose falls out," John says tickling his finger on Sam's chest. "I love you Mary, stay safe. I'll see you tonight. If you need help, call me." Mary wraps Sam up in a blanket and clings him to her waist.
The man shrugs, "my friend Meg set me up on this date. I didn't want to come. It's fine. See you around." He doesn't show sadness, anger, or anything at all. He picks himself up from the chair and walks out, back into the hot air.
She even shared the story from elementary school about how Jo and she made a bet that the two of them would fall in love. At the time, Jo said no, because she had weird expectations that Dean would marry her one day. And she laughs at how moronic that is, now that she knows what a “meathead” Dean is and how much she would prefer a sweet dorky redheaded girl over any boy.
Meg lets him take one shot; no more than one, and then lines the rest in front of Cas. “No occasion. Just hoping Clarence can lighten up.”
Cas smiles at Aaron filling out a form. “Hey there…” Aaron looks up. Shocked that someone walked in and he didn’t notice.
Castiel bites his lip, "I uh- I'm closer to be the youngest than I am oldest. Michael is the oldest. Anna is the baby of the family, but I follow after her."
When he exits the bathroom, Aaron stops in front of him. “So… you love him, don’t you?” Dean doesn’t know what to say. Even though he invited Aaron with the warning of them being platonic, he never should have. “I just want to make sure. There’s no chance for us, ever, right?” Dean nods slowly and Aaron frowns. “Can’t say I’m not upset about it. But I know you didn’t really want anything. Guess I just got my hopes up.”
Then he remembered who he was talking to. Charlie was like a human lie detector—one off-kilter word and she was on you like a hound on a fox hunt. Dean had once suggested she work for the FBI, to which she’d replied “who says I don’t?” with an unnervingly cheeky grin.
He was curled on the couch by candlelight, nursing a mug of Castiel’s mulled cider—gifted to him for Christmas along with the books— and a book when his phone buzzed. He’d avoided using his cell and laptop since he couldn’t charge them, resorting to the battery pack for only a couple minutes at the end of the day.
Dean swallowed, trying to memorize the beauty on Castiel’s face. “Thanks,” he said, voice only a little bit hoarse.
Dean nodded and hummed a thank you, beelining for the French press and pouring himself a generous amount before filling a bowl and dropping into the chair in front of Cas. Petunia immediately began winding around his ankles, her fluffy tail brushing his kneecaps.
Dean usually joins him, a mug of tea and a warm arm around Cas’ waist, grounding him as he loses himself to Kansas rainstorms.
Castiel heaved a deep, reluctant sigh. “Some teenagers don’t believe you can have fun without inebriation of some sort.”
when Castiel began to nod off. Dean could tell what it looked like; Sam could barely make it through a Disney film without falling asleep (the only one he didn’t knock out in?
Castiel glanced down at his lap, one thumb rubbing the soft fold of the blanket and the other hand holding tight to the handle of his mug. “When you—when you messaged me, that night. Do you—do you remember what you said?”
“That you texted Sam instead of him? Dude, it’s the funniest thing ever.” Charlie answered, chomping down on her sandwich like it offended her D&D campaign.
And Dean got that warm, glowy feeling like hot embers in his stomach, and had dreams about ocean-eyed, dark-haired men, waking up half-hard and confused or uncomfortably sticky with a feeling of dread and longing twisting in his gut because—
“Very funny.  Yes, I own comfortable clothes,” Castiel replied. “Oh—here.” He unzipped his bag, pulling out a rather large thermos wrapped in a tartan cloth. He handed it to Dean, his cheeks turning a little pink.  “It’s, uh, apple cider. I made it myself.”
“Meh,” Dean mumbled, “I watch it for Michael.” He saw Cas’s eyebrows jump in his peripheral vision. “What? I can’t watch a movie for one hot dude?”
Dean felt himself melt a little more.  “I—thanks, Cas.” Jesus, maybe the cold was getting to his head. Castiel gave him a soft smile, helping Dean wriggle out of his layers. The heat of a blazing fire seeped from the living room, and Dean let out a sigh of relief as the warmth of Castiel’s cottage washed over him like a hot bath, curling through his shirts and soaking through his skin.
“You’re focusin’ on only one tactic—here,'' Dean flipped Castiel’s cards over and laid them flat out. “Look—here’s a sequence you coulda gotten,” he said, switching around a couple of cards. “You’re tryin’ to win
on the décor, too, completely transforming the enclosure into a faux-jungle scene. Fake vines hung from the walls and ceiling, wound around the sides and twisted around branches. Plants—also fake, Castiel had mentioned live plants were only for “bioactive setups,” whatever that meant—sprouted from the corners, overflowing onto cork bark slabs and suctioned to the sides. She had not just two, but
There were faint rumbles of thunder in the distance; Castiel could feel the anticipation building as they rolled ever closer. He had to steady his breathing, senses overwhelmed but still craving more.
God does he feel nauseous. Fuck. If he’s going to get through this night he’s going to need a shit ton of tequila to numb it out. He rolls his eyes and reaches for a shot. Meg went all out for him. There’s at least 10 shots on the tray still and he chuckles thinking about how much credit Meg gives him for drinking. Despite knowing his body could handle it- he doesn’t want to black out later so he starts with throwing back five. He passes one to Meg and another one to Max. “Go for it. I’m not going to have them all.”
Castiel gets a few glares from the other groups. And several kids point at them, whining that they didn't get anything. But what can you do? Castiel smiles to the four lovely girls and he realizes he was put in the cool group. Or at least he would like to think they all are.
Cas leaves to walk Inias upstairs and out to the car. But the rest of them stay and wait for the girls to get back. Just as Dean’s about to actually move and find the missing guests, the three come back in and Cassie sits down on the couch away from Dean. Dean moves to her and whispers to her if he can do anything and she glares. He kisses her forehead and she pulls back. “What’s that?”
Cas wonders on that one. “I’m not really sure. I think I’m ok. I’m still heartbroken. But I think I’m also relieved. Not about being apart from him… never that. But I don’t know? Feels like I can breathe and say and do things without wondering if it’s going to make someone retreat from me.” He feels guilt for having those thoughts, too, but it’s helping to say them all out loud so he can stop carrying them inside. “I’m okay, Charlie.”
"Cas isn't a cigarette!" Dean yells. Castiel smiles at Dean, gripping his hand a bit tighter. "We're not getting you anything. You're just a bully!"
The boy's sick smile curves up. His voice is deep and reminds Dean of something called a ‘hick.’ Which he only knows of because of the baseball game Mary took them to. His southern drawl laughs, "I don't need to do anything, freak." Dean frowns and grabs Castiel's hand. No way is he arguing with this older boy about candy. Besides, they’ve been to enough houses by now. Castiel can share his.
The long blissful noises escaping Castiel's mouth may be Dean's favorite noise. Even before the loud purrs of his babies engine when he takes off. Castiel is the most angelic creature Dean has ever came in contact with.
The rest of the night she and her friends clump together off to the side and whisper amongst themselves. Cole joins the girls when he realizes Benny is not going to contribute to his gossip and gay bashing game.
She blushes and shrugs, “I mean… I was wondering if you’d like to? And to go with me to the dance? As my boyfriend.”
Dean unlocks the car and jogs over quickly, throwing himself into the driver's seat. "Mine works just fine."
"It's okay," Castiel feels bad watching Dean's entire body sliding at every turn the bus takes. "Here," he wraps his arm around the bottom of Dean's waist, pulling him in closer so he doesn't slide out. Castiel realizes that this may look rather skeptical to the other parents and kids so he slowly hides his hand under the back of Dean's coat. Dean doesn't say a word, instead he lets his leg brush against Castiel's.
“Dean, your father and I love you a lot. Even if he’s awful at showing that right now.” She reaches for his hand and holds it. “Do you want to talk about what happened?”
Castiel sometimes hopes that he'll be able to talk to Claire about the stories of the two growing up. Jimmy was his twin brother; they did everything together, so there would be no fault in the stories. But he doesn't, for her sake. Any mention of his name brings her to tears. Maybe one day it will hurt less. For the both of them.
After exchanging their gifts, they clean up the area and bring some snacks and drinks down to the basement for when their friends start arriving.
Dean sucks his cheek, “I guess. Wish there was a way to practice. I looked it up and it didn’t seem that good. You can’t really ask your own hand how it felt.”
Clearly not the answer wanted because John sighs loudly and his stern voice goes, “Dean,” Mary grips his fathers hand in warning and John sighs again. “I’m being kind, Mary. But our son is fine. It’s not going to be his first heartbreak. What was so special about this girl anyways? You can find a new girl eventually. You’re a young smart man, Dean. You’ll be able to move on.”
But as I said, I do not know details of your relationship. So do as you want with that advice. And honestly, he might feel betrayed and hurt. But what happens next could be good for him. He may stay closed off for some time, but I think having the experience and knowing how great it could be- it’ll help him in the long run.”
Claire goes to the GSA table and Max and Stacy are blushing and holding hands. They both look at each other and say their opinion. They agree that they are totz in love and happily write their responses down. Eliot; after a long battle of asking questions and thinking of scenarios, also chooses the same.
Dean sees Anna making out with his childhood date, Lisa. He watches as a group of guys stand around the girls cheering. It definitely used to make Dean feel aroused but now he just feels bad looking at stuff like this. Because it’s not real and it’s definitely a show.
Cas opens the upstairs bathroom door and slinks inside, leaving it cracked for his date. Thankfully he didn’t take long to follow Cas and he brushes through the opening of the door and grips Castiel’s waist.
Castiel leans back and coats his fingers in lube, "I have to prep you, Dean." Dean hisses from his clenched jaw when Castiel's finger traces the rim before sliding one digit of a finger in. When Dean relaxes a bit more, Castiel goes in deeper, once again waiting for Dean to have comfort. He follows the same method when he goes on to the next three fingers.
Dean feels his stomach roll inside him and he tries to act happy for Cas when their moms are yelling their responses of ‘yes’ and ‘of course.’ Mary asks if Dean has anyone special that would like to join and he shrugs, “yeah, actually.” Lie. Total bullshit.
Cas shrugs. “I don’t think it would’ve mattered. He was so set in the fact that he didn’t want anyone to know. Becky, the RA, even caught him leaving my room one day and she started asking the two of us questions about “us” and Dean acted like he didn’t understand. Said we were just friends. That was our first big fight. But we made up, obviously. He just looked so small talking about being scared and not knowing how his family would react. I couldn’t make him suffer like that. And it’s not like when I came out it was all sunshine. I understood how it could impact someone so I let it go.”
Castiel grunts trying to stretch out his legs once he's on the ground. "You seemed like you were going to be sick. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. And also because Gabriel said the groups had another hour left before we get back to the bus." Castiel yawns loud enough for Dean to hear. "Gabriel said he would meet us in the human body exhibit. He said the girls would be fine with him until you're better."
Dean unlocks his doors and opens it for Castiel to slide in. Dean plops down on the opposite side and reaches into the paper bag holding their food. "I need to eat right now before I get on the road again. But the oceans only a hour or so away."
Castiel feels terrible for that, but he knows it wouldn't be fair to him. The whole time he would have been wishing it were Dean across from him. It wouldn't be fair to himself to let someone as wonderful as Dean get away. Because the small laughs and simple grins went a long way. And Castiel can tell he wasn't the only one enjoying talking. He sees the waitress link by and he stops her, "can I get two burgers and a side of fries to go? I'll be right back." She smiles and writes it down onto a slip of paper, walking back to the kitchen.
The two also talked more about their families. Castiel and Dean properly introduced themselves. They played a quick game of Ispy, until Dean gave up, because every time Castiel asked "something green." It took Dean ten minutes the first time to guess his own eyes. But you'd think after the one time he would've changed it.
Cas thought love would feel different than this. Thought there would be some kind of spark. He felt good kissing Dean. Why can’t he feel good kissing Meg? Instead of saying it back, he scans the room and sees Dean and Lisa hiding behind the tall poster stands. Dean and Lisa are kissing over and over and he feels a ping of sadness. “I have to go to the bathroom.” Before Meg can respond, he books it out of the dance and finds himself spooned over the toilet. His stomach feels like glass, not butterflies. This wasn’t how it was supposed to feel.
He watches Castiel's eyes gaze over his entire face and he nearly breaks. If he doesn't kiss him, he's a goner.
Mary walks over to the door behind John and hugs Naomi. “Cas looks adorable.” She grins at her neighbor-turned-friend, "John will be at home passing out candy when I take the boys trick or treating. Would it be okay if Castiel spent the night after? It may make it a little easier for you. And I know Dean would love having him," Mary says hopeful.
Cas laughs at her bubbly outbursts and introduces himself with the same identifiers to describe himself. She holds her hand up in what Cas recognizes as the Vulcan Salute (something Dean has done often enough around him). “I actually came here to talk to someone? Confide in them? I don’t really know what you guys do… so maybe this is dumb?”
Dean gulps. Fuck. How is he supposed to stay calm and collected when Cas is being a seductive little shit. Castiel starts walking off and Dean watches his hips sway to the parking lot, "where are you going?"
She looks to be calculating her next thoughts. “I do think this could be a learned experience, though. If you meet someone who starts the relationship in fear and withdrawal, I would step back. People in the closet deserve the love and support they need, but it’s not our job to change ourselves to do it. Be a friend first and foremost. Help them see how exciting and powerful it is to be true to yourself. If it’s not labeled, they won’t retreat in panic of the unknown. Instead they see a friend and can find admiration for who you are and eventually, hopefully, for who they are. It can be more inspiring.
The first house they stopped at, an old woman answered the door. She screamed into the house to her husband, "come see these kids! They're so cute!" Dean hugs Sammy behind his back. Sure, they are allowed to be nice to them, but Sammy is his little brother. And screaming in front of him isn't something Dean wants to have him witness. The woman gives each of them a big handful of candy and Castiel says thanks before running after Dean who pulls Sam away.
"No. I just do a lot of reading. Just give me anything and I'll read it." Castiel shrugs, "education was important in my family. Jimmy- my brother and I, we used to make up trivia games on road trips. Who ever could name the most facts would win. It was really stupid. But I know a little of everything now."
“Casanova?” A voice calls out. Castiel barely registers the question until a different voice follows up, ‘Clarence?’ He’s met with a sharp elbow dagger to the side.
Cas doesn’t seem to understand and Dean makes their hands entwine. “Meg didn't say anything. I mean, we talked but she was keeping it in. I told Anna and Lisa. And ah Cassie. Told them they could tell whoever and you know how talkative they are.”
Dean mopes upstairs for a good chunk of time. Apparently it's been an hour because he hears the yell from Mary for the boys to come down to eat. Sam leaves his room first and races his way down the stairs. Dean goes to the bathroom to wash his face off and pat it dry before he starts his descent.
When they get up to their floor, they walk past a group of girls who wave blushing at them. But neither pay any of them attention while Cas slams Dean against the front of their door. Dean’s fumbling with the keys and gasping as Cas rocks his body against Dean’s ass. “I’ll tie you up and tease you until you’re screaming if you don’t get this damn door open.”
Sam sighs, "really? Who's we? Are you hooking up at your daughters field trip? Keep it in your pants."
“I know you’re sensitive to the topic of dating, but do you think you could come with me tonight? I’m meeting a beautiful girl and she’s bringing her; if you don’t mind me saying, sexy-hot brother who is totally your type.” He sees Castiel’s grimace and clarifies, “you aren’t expected to do anything but maybe it’d be good for you to get out there. Just socialize.”
Dean makes a joke; even as he’s a trembling mess, asking if Cas forgot what to do with his dick and Cas takes no time in proving Dean wrong. So wrong. Cas sucks Dean’s cock so confidently. Doesn’t show any sign of second guess as he deep throats around Dean’s length and uses his other hand to reach around to Dean’s ass, which he fingers open as continuing to bring Dean to the edge with his mouth.
Cas wipes a few trails of water off his cheeks and sighs, “I really tried but I don’t want to keep fighting him over coming out. I also don’t want to be the jerk who forced him to. I just wanted him to want me. Enough to tell others and choose me. But I couldn’t- and I can’t feel normal now. Because he didn’t do anything wrong and I don’t feel like we should be apart. I just wasn’t enough for him to-” Meg coughs and cuts him off.
Not bothering to look, Dean signs the receipt and pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket for the tip. He quickly gets up and grabs Castiel’s hand to follow.
Dean told Castiel about his work at the garage. His dad's friend, practically Dean's uncle, gave him a job. But Dean's been winding up some parts and pieces for the shop. And Castiel told Dean about working at a pet shop. Since his apartments lease won't let him get a pet, Castiel thought it'd be best to work at a shop. He explained to Dean how he is trying to get bees added to the pet list. Apparently making honey is one of his passions.
“Please just... I need a moment.” His father storms out of the room and Mary glares at the doorway he left from.
Dean meets Castiel eyes for a second and then looks away. It honestly feels like such a stab in the gut to see Castiel’s blissed out face and staticky hair. He’s not sure why it’s bothering him so much. If Benny was in the bathroom with a girl, or hell, even another guy- he’d be ecstatic for him. But because it’s Cas he feels… anger? Sadness? “You guys planning on telling me, ever?”
Castiel shakes his head and she snorts. “Kay just wanted to make that clear.” She let’s Cas choose a seat and then she plops herself onto the fluffy bean bag chair on the ground. “Floors all yours, Castiel.”
Claire never wanted to start a school wide poll about her favorite teachers. But with Krissy and Alex not agreeing with her… what’s a girl to do?
Cas let’s Dean wipe his sleeve over his face and let’s his body be pulled into a hug. “Can we leave? I’m such a dick and I don’t want to see Benny right now. I’ll talk to him later but I can’t right now. I’m so sorry. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
The next four hours he feels beyond tipsy. This lady is going to get the greatest money she has ever gotten in her life.
Because Dean’s too drunk to handle seeing Aaron at the dorms tonight he asks if he can crash on Castiel’s floor. Castiel says he can come over.
Castiel was in his last class of the day when he overheard a girl whisper, “that’s totally him. That’s the Cas.”
“Son of a bitch, how did I get so lucky?” Dean hasn't ever been with someone who would have done that. “I love you,” Dean speaks before he can swallow his words down. Castiel's eyes bulge and Dean chokes on saliva. “I mean- no... I didn't mean to, I know we've only been together for two weeks, I can go-”
Dean doesn't remember when he ordered a serving of mozzarella sticks. He doesn't remember the one hour warning that the bar was being closed. “Come on, sir, I need to close up now. It's almost two. I have to get home.” Dean leans out of his chair and stumbles towards the door. “You need a ride somewhere?”
Dean and he sit on the bathroom tile for a while until he cuts in to say that the dance is almost over anyways and they could go wait outside for Castiel’s mom. Cas has never felt so relieved.
Castiel and Dean are holding pillow cases in their hands. Mary walks in the front, pulling Sam behind her. She looks back often to make sure Cas and Dean haven't wandered off and to make sure Sam is still okay in the wagon and not trying to climb out. At each curb she wheels them to the side and lifts Sam out, telling Dean to grab his hand and go to the door. She makes sure to remind them of their manners every stop.
Balthazar shrugs, “I’m meeting her here. Her shift is off soon,” he rolls his eyes at Castiel’s anger and waves Meg over when he sees her walking back through the crowd. Somehow balancing many shots on a tray.
“It's good to be queen.” Her smile lifts higher in the corners and she smirks. “I don't see the problem, really. I have the ladies wrapped around my finger. And you have the men on yours. It's all fair play.” Her lips wrap around the greasy fry in a satisfied victory.
Dean’s laughing through his bites of food, recalling to Cas his last call with his parents and he nods along. He spoke about his excitement for his classes, he asked if Sam had told Cas his big news and when Cas shook his head no, Dean went into an elaborate recap of how Sam is trying to win over this girl, Amelia, in his class since Sarah broke up with him.
Dean can’t resist speaking his mind right now. Everything feels like a personal attack. “I tried to be good and like girls and beer and cars and want to talk about fighting, sports, and classic rock but it’s just not me.” He glowers at his father, “and ok, sure, I like some of those things but it’s not all I am. I like cooking, having fruity mixers and riding bikes, I like reality tv and listening to pop music. I really like the color pink and I think I actually look great in it. I hate fighting and I hate going on our hunting trips. I think the animals are cute. When you took me shooting and I shot a rabbit, I hid in the bathroom that night and cried. And I know you don’t want me to have emotions and act girly- but I’m all of these things, okay? I don’t want to keep saying I hate all of these things and acting like I don’t care about them. Me loving a boy shouldn’t make you so disappointed. I know it’s a big surprise but,”
Dean understands Castiel's warning and his mouth is filled with load of hot come. Castiel remains resting on top of Dean's head, arms draped around him as if Dean is his only hope. Dean swallows and licks a line off of misfired come from Castiel's lower chest.
"When did you learn about dinosaurs? Don't tell me you had a Dino collection." Castiel punches him playfully in the shoulder.
They both have lunch together with their family members and then say bye to their parents. Mary and Naomi are both crying messes and talking about how “our boys don’t need us anymore,” which makes Dean snort because he’s going to need his mom for so much more now. They both hug their moms again and then let their parents and Sammy leave with a few words of departure.
They’re in the middle of breaking into the Leviathan's corporate building when the curly haired brunette waves at Cas. She then blows him a kiss. Dean gasps at Cas. “Dude, what was that!”
“There's some cool boats by the dock. I think we could rent one to take for the day.” Dean is nearly beaming up at Castiel. “I cashed in two months paychecks this weekend, so I should definitely have enough.”
Dean nods, “thanks man. I think my car is fine for the night. My roommate left with a girl earlier and I don't know if going home now would be in my best favor.” He feels his stomach tighten. A part of him feels bad. This man is beautiful, Dean doesn't want him to feel rejected.
He smiles into the kiss and Cas pulls on the bagginess of the sweater. “You look perfect.” Between another kiss Cas moans out, “gorgeous.”
In the turmoil of all of this, Dean reached out to Charlie and ranted about the ‘skanky v-neck guy.’ He asks Charlie how he’d go about telling Cas that the guy wasn’t right for him and Charlie just gave him a Cheshire grin and laughed in his face. Charlie asked why Dean was so jealous of the guy and Dean was taken back. Jealous? Dean hasn’t ever been jealous.
Dean wraps his arms around Castiel and brings his face up to his, leaning in for a soft kiss. "Hope that wasn't crossing a line. But I really like you too, Cas. You son of a bitch, you're like some angel." He chuckles and lays his forehead against Castiel's. "You kinda pulled me out of hell. Everything kept getting worse and then you came along and gripped my hand so tight that I felt, maybe someone would care."
Dean rolls his eyes, "let's go Cas." Castiel is still standing with tear drops plastered to his cheeks. "It's okay Cas, we can go home soon."
Dean always laughed and told Cas there was no way Aaron was gay and that the guy wouldn’t of been trying so hard for Dean if he knew he was ‘straight,’ even if it was just in passing. Cas would let the conversation go because Dean would do everything possible to remind him that Aaron had nothing over Cas.
Dean grabs a bag of pasta from the cupboard and waves it at Cas. "Spaghetti, sound good? I make a mean sauce."
Dean feels like he's a ticking bomb. Castiel’s scruff looks so nice in the dim room. “You- you have nice eyes,” Dean stammers.
Dean didn't mean to include a mystery person into conversation with his nagging brother. But it just slipped out. "Shut up." Dean feels Castiel's eyes still staring at him. "Gotta go Sammy, I'll tell Gabe to keep it in his pants when he heads back to your place tonight."
Cas looks taken back and squints, “are you really asking me why I’d have sex with someone I didn’t like? Really? You- of all people.” Castiel’s expressions turn from embarrassed and unsure to a look of fury Dean hardly ever sees. “You fuck some new girl every other week, Dean! But God forbid I sleep with someone who I actually like being around. It’s not like I’m swimming in options of guys willing to fuck another guy! Benny’s an easy choice because he’s already my friend and we both aren’t interested like that. I can screw and be screwed by whoever I choose! You don’t have a say over that!” He throws his hands up when Dean tries to interrupt. “Just stop. I do everything for you, Dean! I always come when you call. You’re always the first person I’d run to. But I can’t fucking run to you for this! I would have- if I ever thought I could, but we both know that’s never going to happen!”
The dinner itself was good. If not a bit awkward. Mary and Naomi led most of the questions. They included the guests to their best efforts as also asking their sons how they were doing. John would interrupt a few of Dean and Castiel’s recants of stories to bring up an old memory of the two and by the end of dinner, Sam all but ran to grab one of their scrapbooks. Although Sam had some appearances, the entire thing is mostly Dean and Cas. Everything from the boys butt naked running around one of their houses, to pictures of Dean and Cas cuddled together in bed, to pictures of their awkward holiday parties and group photos from school. There’s even two pages of Cas and Dean holding hands and dancing around the house. And it’d be cute if they were kids- but the photo dates to their junior year of high school.
Dean has grown close to this girl Charlie. He knew her vaguely throughout elementary and middle school but didn’t start to really talk to her until this last school year.
Alex and Claire both look at one another and roll their eyes, “yeah, how would you know, Krissy?” Krissy laughs and watches as Mr. Winchester pulls out a package of expo markers, handing Mr. Milton another one.
Mary doesn’t let Dean get off the hook too fast though. She scolds Dean in the kitchen and asks why Castiel rushed upstairs crying. Dean has never been one to lie to his mom. But he attempts to bury some pieces of this story from her. He tells her that Cole told everyone to play the game, spin the bottle. He tells her Cassie got jealous because Dean kissed someone else. He tells her that Castiel got overwhelmed. Mary gives him a sad look and sighs.
Thankfully the four girls all choose seats in a row. Dean and Cas squeeze into the seat behind Alex and Emma. Cas makes sure to keep a close eye on Claire who's in the row ahead of the others.
Well… maybe a few times. Maybe when Dean saw Benny and Cas together in high school he was jealous. Ok, extremely jealous. And maybe when Alfie and Cas would make out in the room he was in he’d white knuckle the desk and wish Alfie would disappear.
Castiel nods and brushes past Dean, "it's no problem. I need to head to bed. I've been driving most of the day and I'm really starting to feel it hit. The guest room is to the left of my room. The beds already made and the bathroom is connected to the side of the living room. If you need anything let me know, alright?" Dean blushes at the thought of following him to bed. But he's just a man who gave him a ride to sleep and get out of the cold. He shouldn't take advantage of someone this nice.
Castiel whispers that Dean should’ve chosen her but Dean won’t have it. He pulls on Castiel’s necklace and then points to his own. “Not like she ever gave me a badass necklace.”
Despite practicing with Dean, Cas still finds himself worried when Meg and he are sitting in the corner alone. The teachers are scanning the room like hawks watching for movement in a field. She grabs his hand and holds it tight in hers and he gulps, feeling his hand already sweating profusely. Who knew hands sweat so bad? She keeps looking at him like she wants to say something and then stops and swipes her tongue over her lips. He’s not completely dumb. He knows she wants him to kiss her. But he’s terrified. What if he doesn’t do it as good as he did it with Dean?
Dean, still slotting between Castiel, who is wrapped like a snake around him, laughs. "Yeah, something like that Sammy."
Castiel raises his voice a note higher and claps his hands together loudly. "Hey, Claire, do you think you could go rally up the rest of the Fantastic Four for me?" Claire stares at Cas and nods, she blocks the sun from her eyes, trying to spot out the others.
Shit hits the fan when their mothers FaceTime the boys together asking them for any requests for this year's Thanksgiving. Cas anxiously asks, “would I be able to bring someone home with me?”
Dean jumps out from the car and runs around to Castiel's side, trying to help him with the door. "Thank you, you didn't have to do that," Castiel smiles reaching for Dean's hand. As soon as Dean pulls him up, Castiel wraps his arms around Dean's neck. "Just kiss me." Dean doesn't have to be told twice.
When the two finally have to strength to pull away and get up on their feet, Dean heads to the guest room promising he will return after he grabs his phone and keys. Castiel struts out to the living room in fresh clothes. A pair of blue jeans, a maroon jacket, and tan boots. “You ready now?” Castiel tosses Dean's dirty clothes to him and hooks his hand with Deans until they reach the car outside.
Castiel rest his head on top of Dean's, hugging his arms around Dean's shoulders, fucking himself into his mouth faster.
She throws a jacket on and clears the drinks to the sink. “You were just fine. Come back whenever you want. My name's Jo. Thanks for wasting your money on crappy food and booze.” That makes Dean chuckle and he shakes his head, stepping out into the chilled October air.
It’s not a long lasting kiss but he can feel the passion behind it. Cas looks at Dean and smiles and the two don’t talk about it on their way back home.
Dean looks at the chair next to him and she takes the hint and sits. He goes to pause his music and she lets out a far too loud of a laugh. “Sorry, sorry. Just didn’t think I’d find you listening to Taylor Swift.”
Castiel sniffles and Dean frowns looking up at his mom, "no. I think Cas and I will just stay with you.”
Dean turns around and yells at Emma to come back over. She slinks back over, and Dean threatens to hold her hand if she can't calm down. So she quickly stands still, looking around. "Hey, Cas, you know if the teacher announced the groups yet?"
Dean really lets himself go. All of his senses and worries telling him he shouldn't be doing this; not now at least, are washed away. He clears his mind and let's his heart take over. He cups his hands on Castiel's face, letting them fall down to his shoulders, and then his waist. He tightens the space between the two and spins Castiel around with him, so Castiel is pressed against the wall.
Charlie cracks up and says she has to call Jo because she just won her first bet between the two of them.
Castiel wakes up from the loud snoring next to him in bed. He looks at Claire's pale face. She looks so peaceful when she's asleep. She looks to be happy. Almost.
Dean laughs, “I have more to offer than just fixing cars and being a man! And I don’t care who all I can offer that to, because I don’t care about any of them. I love him, dad. I’m sorry this is such a surprise.”
"Emma, we talked about this. You can't go running everywhere. You're going to get hurt. Slow down kiddo." Dean wiggles the backpack off her, and sets it down next to the bar stool. "Plot a squat and eat your eggs."
Dean smiles at the bar tender and holds up four fingers. He's already out for the night. Why not get completely fucked? The women lays four shots in front of him, filling each to them rim. Dean notices the wedding ring flash on her finger and doesn't even try. Deans been in complicated relationships before, but a married women is not one he wants on his list. She grins, “you better not be driving drunk tonight.. But I'll keep them coming if you need.” She points to the door where Charlie is being pulled by the girl giggling, “I'm guessing you need it?”
The car ride wasn't as sexually tempting as Dean would've thought. Though, don't get him wrong, he was very glad for that. He didn't want to pull over onto a suburban neighborhood street to receive a blowjob and more importantly, a ticket.
John’s under the car and asking for Dean to pass him tools. It’s so awkward but at least he can’t see his dad's eyes.
“Ca- Cas. Why are you doing that? It feels- really good. God Cas. Cas.” If Castiel had only done just this, Dean could have came without being touched in any other way. But when he feels Castiel's fingers pull out he nearly loses his mind. Castiel is still sucking against Dean's chest as he fiddles for the lube next to them. Castiel sits up and grins, slicking his cock. “You sure, you want this still Dean?”
Cas starts rummaging through his dresser, pulling out random articles of clothing and handing them to Dean. “Please. Whatever I miss, I’ll come give them to you, by your door.” Even with Dean clenching his clumped clothing ball he doesn’t move. They stare at each other for what feels like years but is probably only seconds. “You have to go, Dean. Now. You’re killing me… plea-" Cas begs. He closes his eyes to avoid looking at Dean’s heartbroken face for a second longer.
Ruby picks up Gabriel and smiles at Mary’s save, "I think he's about to fall asleep anyways. Sugar crash. I'll call you to schedule a playdate next week, have a safe walk back home." Gabriel waves at Sam with his sticky hands and then claws them into his mom's hair.
"I'm sorry; I feel really bad, but I can't do this. I have a different manner to attend to right now. It means a lot that you came out, but I don't know if this would work out." He watches for a reaction but instead he gets a blank stare. "I am truly sorry."
Dean laughs and bows, "you love me." He stands up straight, "and she said she was swamped with work. I don't know how running a women's group piles up so much work. But you'd have to take that up with her." Gabriel chuckles and high fives Emma.
Castiel is above Dean, instructing Dean by each step. “I need to prep you. It may feel uncomfortable at first. You'll get more used to it.” Dean nods quickly as he watches Castiel mix the drizzle of lube over his fingers. “Tell me if you want to me stop, Dean.”
Cas snorts at his own memory, “But I woke up to a lot of knocking. Thankfully Kevin left early for class. I got up half dressed and half awake and found him outside my door. He was crying, so I let him in. He was telling me how scared he was because he never had done that with a guy. Said his family didn’t know and that his dad would probably lose his mind. But despite all of that he said he wanted to be with me. So we started dating. We took things slow at the start. And then the school year was up and I stayed for summer classes and he had a job on campus so he started just staying with me. Used Kevin’s old bed. Balthazar left back home. I mean, I didn’t have anyone else here.”
Meg nods in concern to Dean's promise but with a hint of hope behind her eyes. “You need to tell your family. Friends. Anyone. Cas might take you back with that speech but I won’t let him.”
Dean frowns at Castiel’s reaction and keeps going; maybe in hope that the more he talks, the more he puts off Castiel’s repulsed response.
Castiel and Dean spend the next half an hour cuddling on the couch. Neither had enough energy or desire to put clothes back on. The cool air in the house did motivate them to lay a blanket down over the two of them. It brought more warmth and comfort as they laid back and talked. Talked about everything important that came to the top of their heads.
Maybe it was a mistake to mix boys and girls for the party. Because things start getting frustrating about the same time they arrive. And it just gets worse when Dean goes to toss the empty coke jug into the trash bag.
Thankfully, the broad shoulders are relaxed as he watches the man bending over the sink, throwing his cupped hands of water at himself. Castiel doesn't think. He just quickly stands behind him. "Come on! Personal space," Dean yells drying his face off. When he turns to see a wave straight from the ocean, pooling in Castiel's eyes, he smiles. "Sorry." Castiel puts his hand on Dean's waist and pulls him in closer. "Cas, listen, you don't have to. You have a date and I don't want to be a complete asshat."
Sam throws his hands up, “Thank God! About time one of you said it.” Dean would ask Sam what he meant if the signs weren’t so obvious.
He sees an old playboy peeking out from under his bed and rolls his eyes at it. Before he realizes what he’s doing, he shreds the magazine in half and starts tearing at every page until there’s a hill of shredded puzzle pieces. Sam walks in and looks in horror at Dean’s work and gasps. “Dude, what did this girl do?” Dean laughs because if not he’ll scream. He would’ve had the same reaction if it were him looking at anyone else- even though he wouldn’t have said it out loud. But Sam’s not that perceptive to emotions that aren’t his and his crushes right now. High school brain has to be real.
he could put on instead of teaching. Granted, their accuracy was questionable, but it was a great excuse for not lecturing when someone had a hangover.
Castiel turned around when Dean caught up to him. “These are very good pumpkins,” he said seriously, holding the heavy thing like a baby. “Not for pies, though. These aren’t the sugar ones.”
They moved together, pressing kisses to foreheads and whispering declarations to each other, swallowing groans in their mouth, sucking bruises on necks and collarbones, legs around waists and hands clasped beneath the sheets.
“They’re very good companion animals. And completely harmless, when treated correctly,” he said, unperturbed, turning to check one of the textbook numbers off the chart. “I take it you are not a fan of snakes.”
Dean blinked and swallowed down a grin. “Thanks, Cas,” he murmured to himself, and started to sort the seventy-some papers.
Stretched out on Castiel’s couch, laptop open on a brain-draining presentation and nursing the ends of fall allergies, Dean decided he could only deal with North American wars for so long and closed his computer. Castiel was seated on the floor, leaning against his armchair and engrossed in grading, mumbling to himself on occasion while marking up his students’ essays.
egg sacs, it was complete with Mama Spider perched proudly on top like a grotesque cherry on an ice cream sundae from Hell.
When Dean finally shuffled out of the guest room into the kitchen, drawn out of bed by the smell of fresh coffee, Castiel was already seated at the table, Cleo in his lap and newspaper in hand. He looked up as Dean walked in and smiled sleepily, still dressed in his pajamas.
Castiel nodded gloomily, slowly sitting up and curling his arms around his knees. The bags under his eyes were pronounced and shadowy in the low-lit room, turning his eyes into sad, somber oceans of exhaustion. “I’ve missed calls before—not just from specifically her, just in general.”
By day four, life started to suck. The chill had settled, the last remaining warmth had dissipated, and Dean stuck it out under piles of blankets and his thickest layers, practically worshipping his gas stove (there’s a reason electric stoves aren’t worth it, Sam!) and the numerous candles he had stuffed in the underbed box.
He could almost fall asleep right here, arms looped loosely around Cas’s shoulders, leaning into him and feeling his steady heartbeat match his own. He closed his eyes, wanting to stay here in Cas’s arms, warm and comfortable and held close forever.
Castiel felt his cheeks warm. “I—thank you,” he said, lifting his drink to his lips so he didn’t have to answer any more.
bad, but this type of written-out question took forever to get through—especially when half the class had unreadable handwriting, or had written three whole pages, or both. (Dean had a knack for deciphering the kind of handwriting that took the phrase “personal font” to a whole new level, but this was almost ridiculous.)
Dean had half a mind to say poke his head around the door and hello, but based on the sounds of shuffling papers and heavy boxes, the guy was busy. And who knew, maybe he’d be the one to introduce himself instead.
“That was a horrific way to die,” Castiel said conversationally while the two of them stood at the sink, scrubbing dishes. He swiped foamy white circles around a plate and passed it to Dean to rinse off.
“Mmf.” Dean felt the couch bounce when Castiel stood up. Footsteps faded into the kitchen, there was a faint
Dean snorted at that, offering a tiny piece of sausage to one of the cats. “It’s the movie industry, Cas, there’s gotta be tension. It’s for the
Dean expected the school year to start off with a bang, and it did. The first week was always hectic—if it wasn’t, something was wrong. Students new and old were navigating the hallways, teachers directing them like traffic guards to buildings and classrooms and the like. Schedules got lost, room numbers mixed up, and one kid (some poor freshman) got pushed down the stairs by accident.
The day before Back To School Night found them back in Castiel’s classroom, going over what felt like everything for the hundredth time. On one side of his desk, Castiel was revising his seating chart and roster for what felt like the fifth time that day. Dean was at the other, scribbling down a list of last-minute supplies.
Dean scrambled to his feet, slipping and nearly falling into the snow. “Wait, what the fuck’s the difference?” he asked, trying to catch up with Cas.
Castiel had felt it then, tension crackling like lightning, charged with the hope between them. He moved his thumb to graze Dean’s bottom lip, watched him lean into Castiel’s touch.
Castiel had sighed and closed his eyes. “Ninety-two percent of giraffe sex is between giraffes of the same gender.”
“You’re rewatching—which Indiana Jones is that?—and drinking,” Charlie called from the kitchen, grabbing two forks from the dishwasher and making her way into the living room. She plopped herself down by Dean, handing him an entire pie. “Scooch.”
“Me too,” Dean chuckled, grinning. Right before Dean drifted off the previous night, Cas—who knocked out in less than a minute—mumbled a mixture between
Castiel nodded. “I think she waved at me when the principal gave me the original tour of the school.”
“What did we talk about last night?” Dean mumbled, ignoring the egg yolk dripping off his fork and scrolling upwards to read…..
Dean grudgingly pulled his legs out of the way before they got sat on. “I want my house key back,” he mumbled, but he took the fork and dug a chunk of pie out of the tin.
From what Dean had heard from other teachers—notably, Adler and Crowley—the exact opposite applied. Then again, Adler and Crowley were notorious dicks in general.
Dean mulled Castiel’s words over in his mind. “Cas,” he said, after a few more seconds. Castiel glanced up at him.
Dean could feel the warmth radiating off Castiel’s body, the softness of his sleeves where it touched his arm. The barest press of his thigh, the faintest scent of honey on his hair.
Dean whistled to get their attention. “Hey, you two!” he called, waving at them. “C’mon,” he said to Castiel, and they dipped and dodged through the crowd to Sam and Jess.
Even though it was past midnight, Castiel’s lights were still on. Dean got out, shivering, pulled his duffel over his shoulder, and walked slowly up the shoveled path to the porch. He knocked twice on the door and waited, shuddering as the cold ate through his layers, one leg jiggling out of rhythm against the wood. The ball of nerves in his stomach had expanded and risen through his chest, pressing harder against his lungs and ribcage the longer he stood there. He knew, rationally, that everything would be fine. Everything would be okay, this had been
Charlie enthusiastically waved them over when she saw them approaching, nearly dropping the fried food she was holding. Gilda caught the plate, fighting down a smile.
“There’s coffee in the pot,” Dean offered, and Cas patted his stomach and pressed a kiss to his cheek before releasing him and pouring himself a cup. He leaned against the counter, watching over the rim of the mug—today, patterned with bees wearing tiny cowboy hats—as Dean flipped pancakes.
a two hour block of nothing. The good part, Dean pointed out, was that at least their lunch blocks lined up.
“Well,” Castiel said, a bit more gravelly than usual, “considering you nearly fainted when faced with an
“I went to college, Dean. Quite a few.” Castiel circled a final something and set the paper aside. “I was the only one who could blow smoke rings that lasted longer than five seconds,” he continued conversationally, sliding another essay from the stack at his elbow.
self could never say. “Yeah. Vaguely. I mean, I was wasted outta my mind, so I don’t remember sending ‘em.”
Dean jumped a little when Marcy’s head bumped his elbow as she turned to watch Cas scoop dirt into the bag at his hips.
Apparently, sleeping terribly for a few days and then conking out for a solid nine hours gave him a new set of vocal chords
Castiel’s lips twitched at the corners. “You could have woken me up, though,” he said, still sounding apologetic.
This was the part about the return from summer break that Dean never looked forward to, along with Back To School Night and the boring, repetitive teacher conferences less interesting than watching grass grow. More often than not, he spent most of them discreetly sending Charlie memes from under the tabletop and watching her fight to keep a straight face from across the room.
Castiel hesitated. “I don’t want you feeling obliged to help just because you’re staying for a few days, Dean.”
Jo Harvelle, the PhysEd teacher and women’s softball coach, slid a beer across the table to him with a grin. Garth Fitzgerald—the psychology teacher—reached across the table to shake Castiel’s hand with a broad smile and a firm grip. Jody Mills, the assistant principal, gave him a wink and tipped her beer, Charlie Bradbury waved cheerfully, and Benny Lafitte, the Foods Science teacher, nodded his head with an easy smile.
Castiel gave a noncommittal shrug. “I switched to a public high school after eighth grade. It was easy to go unnoticed.” He picked up Dean’s stack of folders and began to slide them into the file cabinet one by one. “What about you, Dean?”
Sam tossed the lid into the sink with a clatter and stuck the pasta in the microwave. He turned to look at Dean, arms crossed and a smug expression on his face.
Cas looked up at the sound of his name, at Dean jogging up the steps. He smiled, bookmarking his page.
The rest of November flew by much like the previous month, only with the promise of a full, school-free week due to Thanksgiving break. Sam, Jess, and Mary were coming down from Kansas City to spend Thanksgiving at Bobby’s with Ellen and Jo like they did every year: all seven of them crammed like sardines around Bobby’s ancient dinner table, bumping elbows and bickering over mundane things. Dean would end up insulting Sam in some way, Jo would threaten Dean and Dean would egg her on, Ellen would yell at all three of them while Jess watched with badly-hidden glee, and Bobby would roll his eyes and call them all “idjits
hated autumn? (But he’d said it was his favorite season.) What if Dean managed to majorly screw this whole thing up and his friendship with Cas would be ruined forever? (That would be a stretch: Cas was a reasonable guy.) What if— “Hey, Cas!”
Everyone who wanted to play—that being everyone under the age of thirty—scooched their chairs around the coffee table as Charlie dealt the cards. Even Sam, with all his grumbling complaints about the game, accepted his seven cards without a second thought. Gilda paired herself with Charlie, looking over her girlfriend’s shoulder as she read out the first card, setting it in the middle. Garth and Bess shared their own hands from their seat on the floor, deciding on which card to choose. Jess shoved Sam’s face away from her own cards when he tried to sneak a look, earning an indignant “But—!” from her husband and a snort of laughter from Jo.
“You’ve told me a few times, yes,” Castiel said from beside him, a smile lifting the corners of his mouth.
Claire was standing in front of Castiel’s desk, arms crossed and scowl set in place. Cas was pinching the bridge of his nose, looking exasperated. “Can you please
Castiel scribbled something in pen. “Not at the moment, no,” he said, still deep in what looked like water conservation efforts.
“Grading your essays,” Dean interrupted from the doorway. Claire jumped and turned. Castiel looked up, and something like relief passed over his face. Dean raised his eyebrows at Claire. She rolled her eyes again and grabbed her bag off the ground.
Charlie Bradbury, head of IT and one of Dean’s best friends since college, worked in the media center and led the Computer Science courses, along with supervising the technology and graphic design clubs.
That small moment in the hallway earlier—that had been dangerous. Getting up into Castiel’s space, turning on the charm and stepping right up to the
He was right about recognizing roughly half the kids on the list: he’d taught them—or heard other teachers talk about them—within the past years he’d been teaching. The minutes passed in comfortable, pen-scratching quiet,
“Oh. Uh,” Dean scratched the back of his neck. “We—my brother and me—grew up military. Moved around a lot, went to a lot of different schools.”
“Not necessarily,” Jess reasoned. “Text him back and say you were really drunk and don’t remember anything.”
“Marcy’s good, Cas,” he said, scooching the bird back to its original spot (and earning a glare in return) before closing and latching the hutch door.“She’s a good—uh—BCC.”
Dean overheard multiple students talking animatedly about their plans for the coming evening. He’d known he wouldn’t get
“Uh,” Dean wiped a hand over his face, somehow relieved he’d unearthed his emotions to Charlie and regretting it at the same time.“A bit after Halloween? That’s when—that’s when it clicked.”
Mildred had had one of the better classrooms—roomy, decent AC and heat, and a pretty good view of the wooded area behind the school. There were lab sinks along one wall, plenty of spacious cabinets along both sides, and—because it was a science classroom—
It didn’t. It was...wonderful. Dean still ached to reach out and reel Castiel in, still felt that fire burning when Castiel caught his eye and they’d dissolve into laughter, still wanted to hold him close, safe and warm and
Dean looked up from his position on the couch and scrunched his legs up so Sam could sit down. “Huh? Oh, yeah, he said he’d try to.”
Even though this was his fifth year of teaching, Dean still hadn’t managed to find a quick, efficient method of deep-cleaning his classroom before school kicked back in full-swing. Every year was like spinning a roulette wheel of
Dean kicked his boots off and wound his way through the labyrinth, setting the craft brews and his school bag by the armchair. “The Office? Dude, come on.”
The pumpkin looked even worse up close—the orange coloring was dull and blotchy, the stem twisted around in knots and sinking into the top of the pumpkin. It wasn’t evenly shaped all the way around, slouching to one side with large divots and creases, bulging at odd places and caving in on itself in others. It looked like a sad, half-filled bean bag.
“Uh-uh.” Dean cut him off. “None of that. You’re literally planning back up lessons three months in advance, dude, seriously?” He raised his eyebrows. “I get the stress, man, really, I do. But working yourself into a corner ain’t gonna make it better; it’ll make everything go south real quick.” He softened his tone at Castiel’s expression. “Listen. Everyone fucks up at some point, even the best of us. God knows I have.”  He paused. “Pushing yourself ain’t bad, Cas.  You just gotta know when to step back and say ‘fuck it’ sometimes.”
Dean thought for a moment. “Where’d you move here from? You said you used to work at the middle school?”
“I taught middle school, Dean. I can tell when someone has a burning desire to ask an indecorous question.”
It felt wonderful; streams of rainwater cascading down his face, drenching his hair and shirt. The freezing torrents shocked his body, but it was clean and grounding.
But by eight thirty with no sign of Cas and three-quarters of his class chattering away across the hall, Dean’s unease had morphed into panic. This was
The conversation fizzled, and Dean was left casting around for something else to say. “How’s the room setup going?”
“Mmff,” he groaned, closing his eyes and letting the drink warm him from the inside out. “You’re amazing, Cas, you know that?”
Dean watched the bubbles melt away under the hot water. “What, getting burned to death by a dragon or shredded by your own hounds?”
Dean brushed one of the strands aside, kissed Castiel’s forehead again, and slipped out of Cas’s octopus-like entanglement of limbs.
Everything was blurring together from exhaustion: the room, the shifting orange-yellow-red glow of dying embers, the ceramic in his hands….he could feel his body sinking into the squishy softness of the couch cushions and his grip going lax on the mug.  He felt a warm hand gently take his cup and heard it
Sure enough, both cats were meowing loudly at Castiel by the time he slipped off his loafers and locked his front door. “Yes, I know you’re hungry,” he said to them, walking to the kitchen and trying to avoid tripping over the cats. “Come on, then.”
Cas made a devastatingly cute, faint noise of happiness. Dean grinned into the pillow and slowly turned in Cas’s arms, pressing a soft kiss to Cas’s forehead and tangling their legs together.
“Shuddup,” Dean says, but he’s laughing. “Remember Sam walking onto the roof ‘cos we’d been gone too long?”
They lapsed into comfortable silence again, quiet scritch-scratches from their pens and the shuffles of paper filling the quiet.
For the most part, Castiel enjoyed the evening: he liked meeting his students and getting a glimpse of what his year would look like before it officially started. But after two hours of repeating himself over and over, Castiel was ready to be fully done. The moment the last parents left his classroom, he leaned heavily against the desks and let out a long, heavy sigh. He could hear families from other classrooms echoing down the hall, ‘goodbyes
(because Dean likes Queen, okay?) drifted from his laptop, loud enough to be heard over the pop of grease from the bacon, but low enough that (hopefully) it didn’t wake Cas up.
A part of him still believed this was all in his head: the way Cas’s fingers stroked the soft skin behind his ear, the way his hard, muscled thigh felt under Dean’s hand, pliant and firm and
Castiel was looking at him with the most beautiful, reverent expression on his face—one of complete admiration and pride.
Castiel didn’t answer, but Dean saw his eyes catch on something and a small, triumphant smile spread on his face. “Hang on,” he mumbled, starting to carefully pick his way through the sea of pumpkins.
Dean chuckled, giving Petunia a pat on the head before following Castiel to the guest room. Once he was in the shower, he tipped his head back and let the hot water stream down his chest and shoulders, shuddering at the warmth. Castiel’s cottage, however old and small, had surprisingly decent water pressure and insulation, something Dean was savoring after four days in his freezer of a house.
Dean scoffed indignantly, taking a less-than-graceful half-step backwards to wiggle out of his coat, feeling his cheeks heat.
Most of these had their doors thrown wide open to customers; bookstores and antique shops (Jess dragged them into one of her favorites, and she and Castiel ended up spending ten minutes discussing prices for wood-carved bees. They ended up buying said bees) restaurants and delis, pottery shops, little art galleries, and the occasional clothing store.
“Cas,” Dean interrupted, heart beating much too fast in his chest, “if I ain’t reading this right—you gotta tell me, I can’t—”
Something small and happy bloomed just a little in Dean’s gut at the sight of Castiel’s lopsided, happy grin as he started to plod back through the patch towards Dean, his eyes crinkling just a little at the corners.
“Yeah, no shit.” Dean seated himself on the floor across from Cas. “You should organize this, though,” he said, flipping through the nearest stack. “I’d do it by class, and then A-day, B-day mini-groups.” He glanced at Castiel again, noting his button-down and slacks. “I’ll start sortin’, you go change into sweatpants or something and grab a few drinks.”
“How are you not completely wiped from being up so late?” Dean asked ten minutes later over breakfast. Cleo had taken to perching like a gargoyle at Dean’s elbow, attempting to paw the yolk off his plate.
Dean nodded. “Good.” He contemplated Cas for a moment. “You know what?” he said decisively, nodding, “You need a fun weekend.”
He checked his watch; it was barely twelve. He tapped Cas on the thigh. “You can head to bed if you’re tired, dude.”
They saw a few of their students walking around, some of whom said hi, others offering a brief smile or wave. Sam and Cas, as Dean had expected, got along wonderfully. They walked a little ahead of him and Jess, deep in conversation about something ancient and most likely boring. Cas mentioned Athenian democracy while looking at olive oils (what the two had in common, Dean had no idea), and Sam jumped in eagerly with an “I
Castiel smiled softly, pressing a feather-light kiss to the corner of Dean’s mouth and bumping their foreheads together. “I suggest we go to bed, and I’d like to ask you to join me.”
handwriting?” Dean said, exasperated, trying to make out the half-cursive, half-shorthand scribbles and at the same time, scratch Petunia’s chin.
This year would be just like years past, but with a few things different. Cobwebs and dust and dead bugs still lingered in the corners and the window sills, the chairs and desks were still stacked precariously high in the corner, and the air was still stale and old.
queue, completely unsure of what he was looking for or wanted to fall asleep to. (So he was a guy in his early thirties who fell asleep to movies—sue him.)
They stumbled down the short hallway, Cas falling on the unmade bed sheets and pulling Dean down with him. Dean bent to kiss him slow, deep, languidly, rolling his hips down onto Cas’s and relishing the moan it pulled from Cas’s throat.
“Oh, hello,” he said, looking nervous as he quickly reached over to the table and tapped the keyboard, pausing the song. “I’m sorry—is the music too loud? I can turn it off,”
The drive felt shorter than normal, even with Dean’s slower-than-usual speed. The usual ten minutes flew by, the faint brightness from Castiel’s porch light coming into view much sooner
Dean shrugged, glancing down at the last bit of hot chocolate in his mug. “That’s fair, too. I mean, it’s obvious how they feel about each other. At least from an outsider’s standpoint,” he added. “There’s a reason I keep making ‘em do classwork together.”
“I don’t think Claire knows how to say it,” Dean replied, fixated on one slowly burning chunk of ash.
Dean gave a tiny nod, regretting (and half-thanking) his drunk past-self for blurting out what his sober
Dean groaned into the kiss, hoisting Cas up onto the counter and feeling legs wrap around his waist.
“Mmm—hey, what d’ya think of this?” Jess held up one of the hats. “I like the shade of green.” Dean nodded his approval, and she handed it to him to hold so she could reach for her wallet.
” Dean grumbled to himself, dumping cricket spider corpses into the trash bin beside him, “All God’s mistakes.”
Attached was a photo of the cat curled on the pillow Dean had used the previous night, nose tucked under her tail and looking very reluctant to move.
Castiel collected his own work and stood up, arching his back and rolling his shoulders. “If you’d like to get the bratwurst from the downstairs freezer, that would be helpful.”
“So,” he said hoarsely, and Castiel’s closed eyes opened to gaze softly into Dean’s own. “What—what d’you…” He trailed off at the end, unsure of what he was even going to say in the first place.
the silver back would burn up the reflection, although this is a more recent addition to vampiric lore
Every memory of the night is stored away into a long list of important realizations. 1: Dean can be interested in females and males. 2: He's going to seriously kick Charlie's butt for ditching him yet again. And 3: he's going to take Charlie out for dinner and thank her for letting this wonderful encounter happen. Each thought fills his head with happy thoughts. He takes a mental note to call Sam this weekend and tell him what his little brother half expected for years is in fact true.
Dean randomly picks out two pairs of swim trunks and tosses them over at Castiel. When he gets to the docks, Dean sees one of his father's old friends. With a wave and flash of a smile, Dean gets half off the price. They pick out a boat called, “Purgatory.” Castiel tried to explain that Purgatory is a realm where the souls of creatures go after they die. And indeed no where he would ever like to find himself, even if he believes it could be deserving from all the mistakes he has done. Dean disagrees though, he doesn't care if Castiel disappointed his family or whatever else he has done. He wants him anyways.
"Can you all spend the night?" Dean looks at Emma, bouncing on her heels. And Claire, twirling her hair on her finger when she bites her lip.
Claire pinches her arm. Yep not a nightmare. “The survey.” She gasps a breath and then talks fast without a break, “I was arguing with friends about you and Mr. Milton and I took it too far. I just wanted to know what other people thought. I know it wasn’t my place to do that and I didn’t expect so many people to know about it, it was going to be a short one day thing but someone posted it online. So more people saw it.”
Dean wears a button up and black slacks. He’s not as fashionable as Cas but he thinks he pulls off the look well despite that. He knows Cas likes everything Dean wears. He can see how Cas looks at him when he’s lounging around wearing an old band shirt and it’s the exact same as when Dean’s more dressed up.
Cas pulls out of Dean’s hand with a few minutes left of their walk back to the dorms. He stops and stares at Dean. Dean looks worried but Cas says matter of factly, “if you’re not up to it, we can talk. But I think I want to have my tongue on you." He looks like he's considering between two important options, "no, definitely in you.” He spanks his hand over Dean’s ass and smirks, continuing to walk without Dean.
Claire talks to Max a lot. And Max always talks about how she knew Stacy was gay when they first talked. She said she knows if most people are based on observation. Claire was so sure that her observations were spot on. But now Ms. Bradbury might not be a lesbian; like assumed, and her favorite dorky English teacher is not smitten over Mr. Milton the art teacher. She must have been way off.
Dean helps Castiel boost up from his seat, and Dean lets the girls take off down the aisle before him. Castiel smiles at Krissy, the stuffed tiger held close to her chest. When they step off the bus, Alex runs to a women with a shirt pixie, in uniform.
Cas slinks over to the group in defeat. Clearly the leviathan situation has to wait. They join the group of girls and the six of them talk. Jo is teasing the boys about how “totally in love they are.” Castiel guesses he is. If someone else can see it… maybe he is in love with Meg. Seems a bit soon... but people always say that there is love at first sight. Maybe that’s how he is with Meg.
Gabriel grabs out wrinkled paper from his pockets and grins, "looks like you two are teaming up for the day. You'll have Claire, Emma, Alex, and Krissy."
Dean looks at Cas like he’s joking, but then laughs looking at the pillow peeking out from beneath them. Mascara and eyeliner smudges are painted on the pillow with damp wet spots.
She looks between Castiel and Dean and grins, "okay. Sorry, I just thought. Well if they can, I can take them with me right now. I was planning on ordering a few pizzas today for dinner. And I'm sure Alex will have pajamas for them to wear."
"Deano!" Gabriel yells with cupped hands. All of the girls are oblivious to the surroundings. They're all pointing at the creepy lungs encased in a sealed glass display. "Feeling better?"
Castiel swallows down a handful of dry Cheerios and a glass of tap water. He stretches out on the short couch in the tiny front room. He really needs to head back over to Jimmy and Amelia's old place. Sell a few things to save up for a real house. Somewhere where he can support Claire. A grubby old apartment isn't a fit for a growing kid.
Dean opens his mouth to talk but quickly shuts it in dubiety. He turns around and leaves silently. The only noise is from the bunch of clothes being dropped onto Castiel’s floor as his nose whistles. “Keep em.” The door clicks from Dean’s exit.
Castiel relaxes and slowly sucks deep bruises into Dean's collarbone. Creating a red and purple color palette. He loves hearing every moment of hitched breath, soft whispers, and small pleads. “I need you, Cas,” Dean whispers.
Meg tries her best to hold it back but she hums out a giggle. “Dude I was so confused with the sweater. Cas made you seem so manly and to find you wearing this was quite a shock, to be fair.”
Charlie looks torn but then smiles when she knows he’s done asking and talking. “From how little I know of you two; no, I don’t think you did the wrong thing. It’s important for everyone to make decisions that will impact them positively. It seems being open and present is a value to you and asking for that is not a crime.”
Cas doesn’t know how long goes by, but Max asks and offers if Cas wants to go to the bathroom and he shrugs his response and follows behind.
“Dean… what if he said things that were true?” Cas doesn’t meet Dean’s eyes and he can understand why. “What if I,”
A trail of come slicks over Castiel's chest and mid stomach. Castiel lets Dean milk his orgasm and he swallows Deans moans with soft kisses and strokes. Dean sits up and smiles, "you still have to-" Castiel nods and let's Dean start bouncing over his lap again. Castiel knows his dick hits Deans prostate once again when Dean let's out a wail. And slams himself up and down in the spot.
Dean looks ready to snap but Benny ignores Dean’s temper tantrum and kisses Castiel’s cheek. “If you wanna get together later, let me know. Have a good night, Cas.”
Castiel obviously doesn't catch his hint though. "What? You want to go on another field trip together?"
Benny speaks out first because Cas looks like he’s going to pass out. “It was my fault. I just didn’t want anyone to know yet.” He pulls away from Cas. “It’s not a big deal or anything, Dean. But I’m sorry I didn’t tell you.”
Castiel frowns and shrugs, “well-” he starts to shift back towards his car but he shakes his head. “Listen, I don't want to scare you, but if you need, I can give you a ride. Don't worry, I'm not an axe-murderer or anything.” He smiles and points at his car, “I'd be happy to give you a ride home.”
God, can this day be over? Honestly, thank God for the long weekend. He needs to be home. Get out of the dorms and leave campus to mess with his baby bro and hug his mom and eat a ton of comfort food. Dean doesn’t even know how he will begin the conversation with his mom and dad. John never was too perceptive to his son's emotions- but Mary always knows. She knows the minute one of her son’s facial expressions changes. And Dean’s not so sure what to say now. Does he really want to come out to his parents just because he’s heartbroken? Obviously he’s hurt… but telling John? He doesn’t want to crack open that issue, in fear of still being heartbroken after and also breaking apart from his entire family.
With her, he sees him. Dean doesn’t look scared or embarrassed or upset. When Lisa notices Anna, she interrupts Dean and points his face in Castiel’s direction. His face lights up and Cas can’t help but smile. What the hell is happening?
Lisa sees Anna and calls her over and Anna gives her best flirty smile and Lisa slaps her softly and whispers, “don't you dare.” Anna looks offended and Lisa looks for Dean's approval and he nods. “Dean’s bisexual and he’s trying to win back the guy he’s in love with!” Anna gasps and has the same facial expression Lisa had.
Meg gasps and twines her fingers through his hair. She pulls out her phone with her free hand and Cas hears the faint sound of the text delivering and she stands. “We’re going to get out of here and you’re going to talk to me about Dean. Winchester, right?”
Dean slowly works Castiel's length into his mouth almost entirely and then begins to let his head bob. The tugs in his hair make him only more encouraged.
Castiel backs himself up to the end of the couch and he grabs Dean's legs, throwing them over his shoulder. Castiel's hands cup Dean's thighs and ass, slowly opening Dean up in front of his face. Deans neglected cock is killing him. He needs to be touched. But when he feels Castiel's mouth so close to his tightening hole, he nearly comes thinking about it.
Dean laughs and brings his hands back to the side of his chair, "don't get me going on that. I'm the world's proudest brother and I don't want to bore you half to death about him." Dean can't help but smile. His little brother has that affect; sure he can be a bitch, but Dean wouldn't know what to do if he ever lost him. "Are you close with your family?"
Dean wants to vomit. But instead of food coming up, words fill his throat and spill out his mouth. “I’m not ever going to find another girl like them because I was dating a boy!” His own words shock him and he pulls back into himself.
“Dean. Dean, I’ve… I’ve loved you from the start. It was always you.” He sees Dean’s pupils dilate as he looks at Castiel’s lips growing into a smile. “I love you, Dean. God, I love you so much. Always.”
Cas makes sure the clasp gets through the hole before he lets the necklace flop back down onto Dean’s neck.
Castiel looks pissed but responds, “great.” He rolls his eyes and gets up, “I’m not going to be nice to him.”
"Hello! It's good to see you, John." He is met with Castiel's mother who is patting Castiel inside. "Sorry about his costume. The kid refuses to wear anything else right now. He's going through a dress phase."
When he thinks about that, Dean mentally hits himself for that one. It's not like he asked him on a date, there's no reason this man would feel rejected.
But instead, Dean doesn't have to work himself up for it. He hears a crinkle from the plastic bag being dropped to the ground. And he feels Castiel's mouth smush into his. His lips are partially chapped. But they're also incredibly soft. It feels like he's tasting a whole new creation. It's not quite like anyone else he's kissed. Castiels stubble brushes when the kiss lingers. His tongue pleading against Dean's lips until he lets it brush into his mouth, slotting against his.
Before the door is fully opened, Dean is already undoing his pants and raising his arms up so Cas can get his shirt off of him. He stands there in his underwear as the door slams behind them and Cas at least has the sense to lock the door once they’re in.
The typical groan that would usually echo in the room is held in and everyone shifts around to clear their desks off.
Dean takes a few moments before he allows himself to pull out. His body can’t hold itself up any longer and he rolls onto his side next to Cas, who lays ass up, head buried in the pillow.
Cas and Dean hang out for the first couple hours and then by eleven they part ways so Dean can go find Anna to woo, and Cas can go find his mystery man.
Dean rubs his face. He can't be the shitty parent hiding in the stalls because he's scared of getting another boner thinking about another adult. One who just happens to be raising a child who could very well be one of his own kids new friends. He stands up, zipping his pants back up. He unlocks the door and slowly walks out. "Sorry, I'm okay."
"Hurry up dad! We're going to be late!" Dean runs at his daughter, grabbing her by her backpack so she doesn't slide into the marble counters. "Dad!" She whines, pulling her backpack away from his hands.
Cole chuckles, “okay fine. The next person to land on the same sex has to do it, too, and then we’ll take that rule out.”
Dean wide eyed stares, lost in the trance that is Castiel. He shoves his jeans down to his ankles and kicks his feet out of them before he drops his briefs too. Dean reaches for his own dick and Castiel makes a tisk noise. He pulls his shirt over his head and tosses it aside, waiting for Dean to do the same.
He panics thinking about how Dean feels. Even if he was in constant pain about Dean hiding- he never wanted to out him. Never wanted it to come to this. Shit he needs to find Dean. Needs him to know he didn’t mean to ruin his life.
The check takes a few minutes to arrive and the entire time the two men are staring at each other not talking. Honestly if anyone else saw them and how they were staring, they could probably infer what was happening. Maybe not that one had a plug shoved up inside themselves and that the other was bouncing his leg just to feel some friction for his hidden erection. But anyone watching would definitely know the two were hot for each other.
Castiel laps his tongue over Dean's aching hole. Surprisingly, it's not as bad as Castiel imagined it could be. In all honesty, the act of pleasing Dean, makes Cas just as hard even when he himself isn't touched. “Cas- fuck. Mhm, Good. Yes,” Deans verbal chants are nearly impossible to hear clearly. Jumbled words escape his mouth in desperate cries and stomach deep moans. But they only make Castiel want to try more. He circles his tongue a few more times around his hole before he slowly sinks his tongue in.
Dean blinked and walked the rest of the way to Cas’s desk, plucking a Twix from the little plastic cauldron Cas had set out at the beginning of the week. “Oh.”
Dean nodded slowly, letting Cas’s words sink in. It wasn’t the first time he’d spouted some philosophical shit at random moments, applying deep thinking to everyday acts, but Dean was still caught off guard every time Cas went on a spiel. “You really believe that? With everything?”
undead form. Mirrors were said to reflect the soul, but most original theories described undead creatures—even werewolves—as not having them.” He rearranged the blankets on his lap. “And Chinese vampires—Jiangshi—are terrified of their reflection. They also move around by hopping, as their bodies are too stiffened to walk.”
Charlie inspected the bottom of another overgrown squash for mold and dumped it into Dean’s hands, squatting to peer at a different one. “What about carving?”
He didn’t turn to see the expression on Castiel's face as he walked away, if there was one. He wasn't sure he'd be able to leave if he had.
Dean plated the pancakes, switched the stove off, and took two steps across the kitchen to kiss Castiel chaste and sweet, coffee on his lips and laughter on his tongue.
Castiel flipped him the bird, eyes watering from laughter as he kept hacking up tea. “Fuck you, Dean,” he wheezed, but he was smiling.
But Castiel kissed with gentle determination, asking questions with the barest tilt of his head and the hint of his tongue, and when Dean answered with
“I—what?” Dean spluttered, sitting up and taking a rather large sip of his beer, promptly swallowing it the wrong way.
Dean was definitely impressed with his AP students this semester. Some of them he knew from past years or other teachers, and he was happy to see them back in his classroom. Many others were complete rookies to the Advanced Placement regime, and either stoked about higher level courses or beating themselves up for choosing a heavier workload.
Castiel smiled softly. “Yes, she handed me a tin of cookies and spent a considerable amount of time telling stories about working here.”
Dean shrugged. “Could be worse. No miniature Aragogs, at least.” He rolled one of his shoulders, wincing at the
Charlie and Garth both hugged him rather tightly before heading off to their respective cars, and Benny tipped his cap with a "Nice gettin' to know you."
Charlie snorted. “Like that’s gonna happen.” She crossed her legs underneath herself and looked expectantly at him. “What’s up with the gloomfest, huh?”
Much later, Castiel realized he had forgotten to feed his cats before he’d left for the school. By then, everyone was sleepy enough to call it a night, too. It was just passing eleven p.m., and Petunia would be yowling at his heels by the time he was taking off his shoes.
Sam sighed. “Dean, if I could list off every time he’s shown you how much he loves you, we’d be awake well into the night. I don’t think he tries to hide it. I mean, he gave you his favorite books for Christmas, dude.”
The Roadhouse was a rundown, hole-in-the-wall bar-slash-burger joint, built like a barn and tucked away at the edge of town. Classic rock—Joan Jett And The Blackhearts, by the sound of it—thrummed through the floorboards, aided by the clack and thwack of pool cues hitting their marks. The smell of whiskey, tap beer, French fries, and pub nachos saturated the air, along with something distinctly its own.
“But the metaphorical princess shouldn’t have the personality of an inanimate object,” Castiel countered, sticking the plate in the drying rack. “They might as well have had Michael rescue David instead.”
“That boy is good for you!” Donna said imploringly, pushing an apple turnover towards him. “You don’t hide your feelin’s as well as you think you do—oh, shucks.” She wiped at the powdered sugar now clinging to her shirt. “You telling me there ain’t a single bit of you who wants to call him yours?”
And so, two hours later, Dean found himself standing awkwardly in the doorway of Marcy’s room (another thing—the snake had her own damn bedroom, too), wondering for the third time that day how his life had turned into…
of them all. Castiel glared at him through his fingers, cheeks coloring pink and looking so defeated it was almost adorable.
A few minutes later, they were seated across from each other on the cool tile floor, due to the binder-occupied table and chairs. “I’m setting up file cabinets,” Castiel said, rummaging through a box at his elbow. “I’ve got the roster—the principal got them over to me this morning—and I need to label a file for each student.”
Castiel took a bite and nodded his approval of this one, before sighing dejectedly and cramming the rest in his mouth, holding his hand underneath the slice to catch flakes of escaped pastry.
Cas made a noise in the back of his throat and went back to crumbling the dough together. “I prefer bread. It’s much easier.”
The rain was a torrential downpour. Their clothes were soaked through, they were freezing and numb, but Castiel just held Dean closer, warmth flooding through his bones as Dean kissed him.
Castiel nudged his plate toward Dean. “I didn’t have any planned, no. Not yet, anyways, I guess..I was thinking of reading for most of the day. Or baking,” he added, “I know you like pastry, and we have ingredients for a chocolate pecan pie, so—”
Lebanon in itself was a tiny place, and the downtown was a reflection of that. Most of the shops and stores lining the street were small and locally owned, selling handmade and homemade goods to loyal regulars and the occasional (rare) tourist.
“My point still stands.” Castiel said with finality, punctuating his point by jabbing his forkful of sweet potato and leek at Dean before transferring it to his mouth.
“No, no music’s fine,” Dean said hastily, taking a few steps into the room, “Beatles, right? Abbey Road?”
“Well shit, Cas, I—” he started, half-laughing and half trying-not-to-choke-up, finally glancing up and feeling whatever words were on his lips dissolve.
Castiel leaned back in his chair, his eyes crinkling at the corners when he laughed. “That is one of the
Castiel was watching him with something so pure and loving and reverent; it was in the crease of the small smile on his lips, in his eyebrows, pooling in his beautiful deep blue irises.
“Oh you son of a bitch—” Dean scrambled upright, tearing up the porch steps onto the icy wooden flooring as Castiel ran around the side of the house.
“Hey, is Cas coming to New Year’s?” Sam asked, entering the living room with two beer bottles in his hand.
Dean knew what his own unspoken words were: three small syllables precariously laden with something heavier than they should be able to hold. They settled deep in his ribcage like coals, keeping him warm and alive and burning hot until it hurt.
How did he ever think this wasn’t something to be revered? This is nature’s poetry; one of God’s gifts to the Earth and something to be worshipped.
He couldn’t see Dean anywhere, not at the bar, the booths, weaving around tables, not until—“Heya, Cas!
“Heya, Cas,” Dean mumbled hoarsely, shifting upright. The blanket slid from his lap, pooling on the floor.
Castiel’s handwriting was lovely. A weird observation, but Dean caught himself watching Castiel’s small, even script titling each file before he placed a small, neat checkmark next to the name on the list. He had to give himself a small shake before focusing on his
Castiel wasn’t looking at him, but at the ashy fireplace, the last few curls of smoke drifting away. “Can I ask you something?”
Considering the small size of the kitchen, Dean was pleasantly surprised with how well he and Cas managed to work together. They bumped elbows every now and then and occasionally had to squeeze past one another to reach a misplaced whisk, but they maneuvered around each other with ease, making contented conversation.
all that interesting once the initial terror-and-then-excitement had worn off; she mostly used Dean’s legs as a bed, slithering slowly around his hips, tongue flicking lazily in and out. Cas had, at one point, explained the purpose of a snake’s forked tongue as well as the Jacobson’s organ, but Dean couldn’t really recall that much about it right then.
“This is Cas—Castiel,” he said, twisting around to nod towards Castiel, who was standing slightly away and looking around awkwardly. “Cas?”
He just stood there, freezing his ass off on the porch. And stared at Cas: this geeky, snake- and snail-loving man with a bone-dry, snarky sense of humor and tousled hair, who would wax poetic about fantasy and rant about politics; who would let the lonely kids eat lunch in his classroom; who would treat every living thing with the love and respect and kindness they deserved.
He gazed proudly at the warped pumpkin. “Did you know pumpkins weren’t the original Jack-O’-Lanterns?” he said, looking up at Dean. “Up until the nineteenth century or so, turnips were used instead.”
“Yeah!” Charlie looked up from her phone, swinging her legs back and forth, heels thumping the desk. “Good kid.”
The corner of Castiel’s mouth twitched upwards at the reference. “So if I have computer troubles, who should I call instead?” he asked.
“’Kay, everyone,” he said loudly, clapping his hands, “Warm-up’s on the board, pencils and paper out!”
“Sounds ‘bout right.” Dean swallowed. “Lemme guess: Collegeboard, course material, and….something in the syllabus that wasn’t clearly written.”
Dean loosened his grip. “That desperate to get me into bed, huh,” he rasped, his hand slipping down Castiel’s shoulder.
He wiped his hands on his jeans and walked back to his desk to search for the strongest cleaning spray he could find, weaving in between the groups of desks he’d so painstakingly (emphasis on the
Castiel lifted thirty pounds of muscley reptile out of the vivarium with ease and dropped it on Dean’s lap.
Dean swallowed. “You really think so?” he said, looking up at Sam. He felt that warm, comforting heat in his stomach again, bubbling up to his chest. Except, this time was different; there was pure
“There’s coffee on the countertop,” he said, sounding like he’d swallowed gravel the night before. “And oatmeal on the stove, if you’d like some. There’s brown sugar and cinnamon on the table.”
“Don’t blow up your computer this year!” she added, walking backwards towards the door with a cheeky grin.
He made use of the shower before heading home, washing away the last of his exhaustion and melting the remaining stiffness from his back. For a small, old cottage, Castiel’s place had
And as fast at it’d begun, the first month of school faded away in the rearview mirror as August melted into September. Charlie roped Dean into going to a Renaissance fair two hours away (which genuinely enjoyed—not that he’d admit it, though), Castiel seemed to be settling into the high school environment, and Dean settled into the same comfortable rhythm he had every year.
Castiel, still smiling, ducked his head a little. “I thought you might prefer a more comfortable place to stay.”
He squeezed his eyes shut, pulling the covers over his head, mentally slapping himself across the face. Why the
Or, “Oh, Jose Raul Capablanca! He’s regarded as one of the best known players. I have one of his books.”
About an hour later, the smell of pancakes wafted through the kitchen, half of them done and steaming on a plate by Dean’s elbow, and there was bacon sizzling away on a cast iron.
according to Cas—was massive, a solid eight feet long and three feet in both width and height. Three of the walls were solid, animal-safe plastic with built-in air vents, the top was made of mesh wiring, and the front sliding doors were glass.
“Your BAC level was!” Dean heard Castiel retort, and then, a bit softer, “Please, Claire. Just be safe.”
“Cas ain’t here yet. He call in sick or somethin’?” Dean asked, trying to keep the panic out of his voice and failing miserably.
They were sprawled on the kitchen floor, because why the hell not, rewarding the day’s work with rather large slices of pie. (Hey, Dean was
funny,” Dean grumbled, rolling his eyes at Cas’s snickering and flopping on his back to glower at the bedroom ceiling. “It’s
“Dunno,” Dean said, standing up and groaning at the stiffness in his back. He grabbed both their plates and beers and made for the kitchen. “Break up the masculinity?” he called, setting the dishes in the sink and turning the tap on.
history, not World. Anyone with questions about that could ask Adler. Or not, actually, he was a pompous ass.
Castiel didn’t answer, but his slow, deep breathing (and the fact that he was deadweight against Dean’s body) was answer enough.
Castiel, seated on the floor in his paper swamp with just his head peeking over the other end of the table, barely looked up when Dean closed the door behind him. “I don’t understand that reference. Come help me.”
Castiel wasn’t like that. Castiel spoke with open, blunt honesty. He was precise and methodical, and not just with words, but with every thought, action and reaction. He noticed—and generally mentioned—small details others usually missed.
their rhythm flowing as easy as ever. The only change was the addition of maple-sticky kisses and unashamed flirting, but other than that, everything was just about the same.
When he finally made it downstairs, dressed in a (hopefully) clean pair of jeans and t-shirt, only half the regular party was seated in the kitchen. Jody, Donna, and Alex had taken off right after midnight—that much Dean remembered—with Bobby and Ellen following close after. Jo always stayed the night; she drove separately from her mother just for that reason.
Dean sighed and gave up. Battling Charlie about something she was passionate about was as good an idea as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye. “If she’s working this weekend, I’ll think about it.”
to work today.” He set his fork down for emphasis, looking incredulously at his brother. “Because his boa, Marcy—according to Cas she’s really sweet, which is possible, apparently—had a bad shed—something about humidity, I dunno—and he had to give her a bath.” He grinned, picking up his fork again and resuming his noodle-twirling, remembering Castiel telling him over lunch about the struggles of trying to contain a grumpy seven-foot constrictor in a bathtub. “ So I figured a fun weekend would be nice. Because,” he said, punctuating the word with a jab of his spaghetti-laden fork at Sam, “it’s what
He could feel it buzzing in the air, and he thought Cas could feel it too: something anticipatory and strong, building and growing the longer they were there, together, half in deep leep and half wide awake.
He looked so wonderful with his hair damp and slicked back, shirt sticking to his chest. His eyes were greener than normal.
directions. They knew each other’s favorite craft brews and takeout orders because they had a Saturday routine (and they were friends). Dean found Castiel a group of crocheted bees that he decided to get him for Christmas because the guy liked insects (and they were
assigned. He had fourth period free and used it for tutoring during the last weeks before exams—and if not that, then his classroom was open as a study hall for any students who needed to get work done for other classes (or take a nap). Game night? Working late? Dean tried to work around it, giving every one of his students another option, a Plan B, the stuff Dean himself never really got when he was a kid.
The faint sounds of someone—Castiel—clinking around in the kitchen drifted into the living room, with the smell of fresh coffee and bacon following it.
leaning back against the chair behind him. His eyes crinkled at the corners from grinning, his cheeks flushed and so very
responsibility.” He saw Castiel open his mouth, probably in protest, but Dean cut him off before he could talk. “And I get it, believe me I do,” he continued, “but it ain’t all on you. Well, shouldn’t be, anyways,” he added, sitting upright to swing his legs off the couch. “You deserve a night off, Cas, ‘specially on Halloween.”
Dean checked the name. “Yep—oh, thanks.” He took the plate of lunch Castiel handed him: an Indian dish that smelled
of his pen against paper barely noticeable over the faint crackles and occasional hiss from the fire. He had his sleeves pushed to the elbow—regular long sleeves, not his usual button-up—and his owl pajamas on again.
Dean stood there, the jumbled bunch of words he’d stirred up in the car long evaporated from his tongue.
Dean swirled the last of his whiskey around the glass, broodily watching the amber whirlpool before draining the glass.
Charlie’s phone buzzed. “Gilda,” she said in answer to Dean’s questioning expression, hopping off the desks and answering the call.
It was roughly half past one in the morning. They’d finished the movie, a whole French press of coffee, and traded work horror stories before Dean managed to pull Castiel into playing card games. Dean, having grown up more on-the-road than most, knew every card game like the back of his hand. Castiel, not so much—Dean found himself purposefully drawing out the games to give Castiel more of a chance. They were still on the couch, turned sideways to face each other with the table dragged close to the cushions.
He could feel his legs shaking and his heart thumping faster than it should’ve been as he lowered himself criss-cross beside Castiel. “She won’t do anything, right?” he asked hurriedly, every rational thought flying out of his head. “Because I know you said she’s all hakuna-matata chill and whatever, and don’t get me wrong, man, I trust you, but—
Cas stared back, his lips slightly parted, one hand still lax on the doorknob. The steam from his tea rose in soft curls between them.
Cleo slid through the crack in the door, leaping up onto the bed after Dean wriggled under the covers. She settled right on his stomach, purring like a tiny, fluffy motorboat engine. Dean scratched her behind the ears, earning a few appreciative, sand-papery licks in return.
Castiel straightened up. “Got it!” he called happily, lifting up possibly the most misshapen, ugly pumpkin Dean had ever seen and grinning broadly. It was warped like a half-melted marshmallow, the stem curved in on itself like a grumpy shrimp.
Dean cleared his throat, somewhat awkwardly, and held his hand out. “I’m Dean. Winchester,” he said. “The room right across the hall. History?”
shooting through him. If he turned just slightly to the side, leaned a little into the tiny stretch of space between them—
His fellow teacher grew up as the youngest of five children, all with religiously-affiliated (mostly angelic) namesakes. He grew up in Illinois, went to college in Michigan, and ended up in Kansas because of his brother. He lived alone, except for his cats, chickens, and—
The last, tiny bit of Dean’s heart that was still in one piece melted there on the spot, and he thought to himself—not for the first time—that yes, he was absolutely, unequivocally gone for Castiel.
Dean laughed. “You’ll get used to it,” he said consolingly, pushing an extra chocolate chip cookie from his lunch across the desk.
Cas also threatened to make quiche instead of pie, and that shut down any arguments Dean was about to make.
“Thank you,” Castiel said, giving him a grateful smile before turning back to the roster. “I can do the first half, if you can do the second.”
Their quiet laughter faded into silence again, but it was a warm, comfortable silence, like the fleece tucked around their legs and the warmth ebbing from the fireplace.
“I’ll take that as a compliment,” Cas replied, opening his laptop and scrolling through Dean’s PowerPoint.
Sam pulled a container from the fridge. “Charlie, mainly. But Jo, Jody and Donna are also in on it,” he said casually, inspecting the pasta. “What’s this?”
The moment the bell signifying lunch rang, Dean grabbed his food and went straight to Cas’s, not even bothering with knocking before pushing the door open and entering.
—whereas Cas had an empty third instead. He grumbled about it to Dean for a solid quarter of an hour, belaboring the uselessness of what was
The music faded into the next song, but Dean just backed Castiel against the counter, Cas’s hand roaming his back and sides now, tangling in his hair,until he slipped his tongue into Dean’s mouth.
“Halloween is the modern-day Christian appropriation of a Pagan holiday, Dean, we shouldn’t really be celebrating it,” Castiel mumbled, but the tired smile at the corner of his mouth was reappearing.
of the day, Dean was ready to leave and never come back. He packed his bag and waited impatiently for the clock to hit 4:15pm, tapping his foot against the floor and nearly
He set his drink on one of the side tables and clapped his hands. “Okay!” he said loudly, grinning as everyone’s heads turned in his direction. “Who wants to play a truly terrible round of Cards Against Humanity?”
when he said those few words, Dean nearly set his plate down on the floor, scooched his butt across to Cas, and yanked him into a kiss.
“How’d you forget that?” Dean asked, frowning. Because if he knew Cas, he would never forget something so important to his animals as that. They talked about his animals often—his chickens and their egg production, generally—and Castiel spoke of them with such tenderness and care that Dean could hardly believe he’d forgotten something as simple as
In return, he’d given Dean a hefty stack of books by his favorite science-fiction authors, shyly explaining why each book or series was his favorite.
Then proceeded to burst out laughing, because of all the possible reasons for Castiel Novak to be late, this was definitely the most
Castiel’s smile widened just a little bit more, before he turned back to the tank and started stripping it of fake foliage.
They were finally back in school, second semester in full swing as if the extra week of break hadn’t happened. Dean’s classes were doing wonderfully; the first day back was a bit bumpy as usual, but by the second week things were running as smooth as they could. The students were every bit as driven as Dean could’ve hoped for—one student in particular had a new spring in her step, and it probably had something to do with the fact that she was holding Kaia Nieves’s hand.
to a sophomore with a driver’s license) and from what Castiel said over lunch about his first two classes, he was settling in well.
“And, obviously, a Star Trek-themed drinking game,” Dean added. “Or whatever Charlie’s into. Two year ago was Stranger Things.”
Pulling on only one layer and still being able to feel his fingers felt wondrous. Dean toweled his hair dry, glaring at the spiky, damp strands standing on end in the mirror and running his hands through them. He frowned at his reflection. This whole thing—coming to stay at Castiel’s for
Dean grabbed one for himself with a “you’re awesome, Donna,” and the conversation drifted towards the upcoming spirit week.
Castiel, as it turned out, was in his classroom, and after Dean popped in to say good morning and shelved his own books, he went over to see if Castiel wanted help again.
“Yeah.” Dean leaned on his forearms again, elbows digging into his thighs. “It’s a pretty fun night. Afterwards me n’ some of the other teachers usually get drinks. One last hurrah before the ass-kickin’ begins.”
He set their bowls of wet food on the floor, sighing when both cats lunged forwards and chowed down like they hadn’t seen food for days. “You’re going to make yourselves sick,” he murmured, microwaving his own dinner and pulling his phone out to text Dean.
Dean left around one that afternoon, after helping clean up the kitchen after breakfast and feed the chickens.
Eight years—nearly a decade in the same room, with the same desk and white board and tables—new monitor, though, which was awesome
Jess introduced herself next, with a bright smile and a side-hug before they set off down the packed sidewalk.
Dean and Castiel had moved in together two summers ago, after Sam had pointed out how Dean rarely spent any time at his own place anymore—and Cas had mentioned Petunia and Cleo starting to get glum when Dean wasn’t around.
In hindsight, Dean really should have locked his phone in a box and tossed the key away if he knew he would be getting extremely drunk on New Year’s Eve.
still in school, there was always work to be done. There were always things to be graded and things to assign (hey, snow days didn’t get kids out of class these days, now that everything’s online), powerpoints to edit and, of course, ever-growing mountains of emails.
Dean blinked his tired eyes open. “Hm? Oh—yeah, me—me too.” He cleared his throat, settling more comfortably upright. “I mean—no one likes Civics and only masochists like AP US History, so—”
Castiel’s hands were folded awkwardly in front of him, an uncomfortable look on his face. He was staring at the corner of Dean’s placemat like it was suddenly very interesting for some reason. “I... should apologize for falling asleep on you last night. I didn’t mean to.”
He snagged the last pastry on his way out for Cas, wrapping it gently in a napkin and waving “bye” over his shoulder.
Castiel twisted towards the sound of his name, landing on a booth in shadow in the back where a figure was waving at him. Castiel let out a long, relieved breath and pushed through the crowd, dodging patrons and employees, squeezing his way towards the back where Dean and everyone else was.
Dean couldn’t help but laugh. Castiel was standing in the middle of a pumpkin patch, legs planted wide and hair tousled from the chilly breeze, raising up the Frankenstein of gourds like an Olympic medal.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel said. “Oh, and you can call me ‘Cas’, if it’s easier. Most of my friends do.”
Castiel shrugged, putting a piece of egg on his toast. He’d changed his clothes into jeans and a button up and definitely attempted to tame his hair. “I am, just not as severely as you are. I showered this morning, too—that helps.”
Castiel knelt down in front of the vivarium and tapped lightly on the glass before unlocking the door. “It’s so she knows I’m here,” he said to Dean’s questioning eyebrows.
Dean had his own work to do over the weekend: his Civics and Economics class had one last test before Thanksgiving break and he’d planned to finish the review guides over the weekend. Then there were the standard US History classes, which had progress assessments in the coming weeks, and the DBQ prep questions for the Advanced Placement courses.
“That’s one word for it.” Dean drizzled maple syrup over his bacon, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
Castiel’s lips parted just a little when he exhaled, his body angled towards Dean’s, looking unsure and hopeful all at once. “Dean,” he said softly.
“Yeah, well, he’s Kevin.” Dean huffed a laugh. “He said his holiday plans were SAT prep at the local coffee shop.”
(and, if you're wondering, yes - Cas being late to school because he had to give his snake a bath is based on a true story.)
Dean shrugged. “I don’t mind lendin’ a hand. Besides, I don’t have anything else better to do anyways. My room’s all done.”
Castiel smiled back, sliding in the last of the files. The conversation dissipated, leaving only the soft chords of
“Go for it, man,” Dean mumbled, anticipation and apprehension pulsing in his ribcage like a second heartbeat.
Even though Albert was a bantam—a breed smaller than an average football—he carried the anger and spite of a rooster three times his size. He flapped from bush to bush, hiding in the branches underneath and screeching like a banshee when Cas tried to grab him.
Afterwards, Dean lay with his head cushioned on Cas’s chest, tracing patterns with the tip of his finger.
He was taping student name cards on each desk when his door creaked open and one of his favorite people bounded inside, small blue backpack swinging from one shoulder and short red hair swishing behind her.
“Uh,” Dean started, immediately running out of where to go with his rebuttal. “I mean...I’ve...you know. Flirted. Vaguely.”
Cas made hot chocolate after a late dinner, and they settled in on opposite sides of the sofa with books to read before bed. It was incredibly cozy: the warm-lit cottage interior, the fire crackling merrily away in the hearth, a shared blanket or two draped over their legs. Cleo and Petunia lounged in their beds by the hearth, purring contentedly, sound asleep. The lights were still dimmed, orangy-red firelight illuminating the living room and stretching the shadows in the corners. A faint smell of chocolate and cinnamon—rich and a little bit spicy—floated throughout the room, carried gently by woodsmoke.
zone. He could feel his own emotions, his own wants and fears and insecurities slowly trickling into this patient back-and-forth. Maybe it was the confinement of being so close to Castiel, orbiting ever closer towards him for the past three days, which had finally poked a leak in the dam he’d built for himself.
Dean, who’d chosen that moment to take a sip of his beer, inhaled the wrong way and accidentally spat half his beer down his front. “Well, when you put it like that,” he choked out, attempting to wipe his shirt clean.
Dean was jerked out of his thoughts by an angry peck on his thumb, just in time to prevent himself from an attack from a feisty rooster.
Cas snapped a photo of Dean with Marcy draped across him, before letting her slither back into her freshly cleaned tank. Dean immediately sent it to Sam, knowing it’d freak him out.
“She likes the fireplace,” Castiel said, turning off the stove and reaching to grab two mugs off the shelf above his head. “And you, apparently.”
Dean scooched forwards, peering at the roster he was handed. “I can help with that,” he said, scanning the list. “I think…yeah, we’ve got the same students. Well, mostly.”
Dean, dining on a pastrami sandwich on the other side of the desk, suppressed a laugh (mainly because he didn’t want to choke: he’d taken too big a bite). “When’d he email you?” he mumbled.
“Wouldn’t she hear you open the door?” Dean asked, warily watching the tank. Marcy’s head was just barely peeking out of the warm hide—the one heated from underneath by a heat mat, to create a
Cas’s hair was even more of a mess up close, curls and cowlicks going every which way. His cheeks and the tip of his nose were pink from the cold, and his eyes were a brighter blue than usual.
Marcy’s tank took a good, solid two hours to fully clean and redecorate, and in that time, Dean became well-acquainted with the constrictor. She really
Dean cleared his throat, blaming the warmth in his cheeks on the fire’s heat. “So, uh, can I shower?” he asked awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck.
Dean gently slipped his fingers through Castiel’s, his heart drumming a thumping, steady beat in his chest and such a feeling of
He sighed and sank into the quilts again, relishing the heaviness and comfort after the past few days. Content to stay in bed a while longer and soak up the last of this beautiful morning, Dean watched the sunbeams slowly brighten up the room, glancing off last night’s snowfall through the cold glass window.
text before he dozed off, and fell asleep smushed against the pillow, one hand on his silent phone, patiently waiting for a reply.
Cas’s back was warm and firm under his shirt, his arms solid and grounding around Dean’s waist. Dean could smell the honey-scented shampoo in Cas’s hair.
“What was the point of Star’s character?” Castiel asked forty-five minutes later as the credits rolled, reaching down to grab his drink. “She was very….
Dean liked Castiel’s home. He’d done a beautiful job renovating it: he’d kept the original floorplan, only refurbishing or replacing what was needed. The cottage was homey and warm, smelled like woodsmoke and honey, and just felt like
“Mmhm. Here.” Sam set a steaming plate of pasta in front of him, passing him a fork and grated parmesan.
Castiel’s face was in his hands again, his next words muffled by his fingers. “I’ve been working so much since the beginning of the school year—there’s so much grading and planning and emails to get through—I think it just slipped my mind.” He rubbed his cheeks, staring off into space. He looked so deflated when he said it, Dean felt a little of his heart break.
Maybe it was the lateness of the hour, or maybe it was the purring cat on his lap and the fading glow of the slowly-dying fire, but Dean could feel himself drifting off on the couch. (He had, in fact, fallen asleep here more than once while reviewing PowerPoints. The second time he’d woken up to a chicken on his stomach, due to Cas leaving the side door open.)
Dean tried to ignore the warm, happy feeling blossoming in his gut. Castiel’s entire body was leaning into him; a big, sleepy weight against his side.
with them: listening to their heartbeat and slow inhale-exhale of their lungs, idly stroking the skin beneath their shirt, feeling safe in the net of their arms and knowing they won’t let you go.
“We’re meeting Sam and Jess at the coffee shop,” Dean said as he and Castiel started off towards the crowd. He raised his voice a bit and leaned in as the noise-heavy air threatened to drown him out. “It’s just up this street here.”
Cas’s warm hands ran down his back, broad, soothing strokes kneading out the kinks and knots along his spine. “As are you, Dean,” he murmured. “In so many wondrous ways.”
was actually pretty good. Castiel loved it; he used to be in his high school’s chess club, although he didn’t enjoy the competition and preferred to play for the enjoyment of the game.
“There’s hot water, if you’d like to shower,” Castiel said, gesturing slightly towards the bathroom. “I can put your bag in the guest room for you.” He had set his tea on the coffee table and was fiddling with the ends of his overly large shirtsleeves in one hand, holding the other out for Dean’s bag.
Castiel has a crush on you right now.” she said, digging down in her pocket for her phone. “And your evidence is that he’s never marched up and said—” she lowered her voice to imitate Castiel’s gravelly growl, “‘Hey, Dean, I think you’re hot, wanna bang?’”
“So,” Jess said, weaving around a few people on the sidewalk. “How long have you guys known each other?”
Castiel moves to lean against Dean, resting his head on his shoulder. Dean chuckles quietly, wrapping an arm around his (now) husband and pulling him closer, nestling his face in Castiel’s hair. For a moment they just watch the rain cascade down, relishing the earthy, cooling smell and the warmth of their bodies squished together.
The air was musty and stale and there was definitely a large cobweb attached to one of the cabinets, but overall it was in pretty good shape compared to years past. At least, it was better than the year Dean returned to find the largest, nastiest nest of brown recluse spiders tucked in one of the back corners. Not only did it have at least
Dean was answering emails of his during his free block that afternoon (and, on the side, getting beat by Jo at
“Nothin’—I just gotta head out. Bobby wanted me at the garage by four today.” He stood up, wincing at the twinge in his knees and brushing his pants off. “You good with everything so far?”
He hadn’t really seen Cas since before New Year’s. Not for more than a brief moment, anyways. There had been school the first day back and Cas had given him a brief, slightly awkward smile from his classroom, but then the snowstorm had hit overnight and school was cancelled for the rest of the week. Even though now, Dean knew it had been fueled by something stronger than champagne and whatever else he’d drunk.
Dean makes a shocked sound. Before stating, “if it helps numb your heartbreak, Cassie also broke up with me.” Cas seems surprised and Dean snorts, “she said I had to choose to be with her or be your friend. No competition.”
Krissy clenches her jaw. "My mom is dead." Fuck. Castiel sees her eyes glass over with a sheet of water.
Dean panics and sees Castiel facing a taller boy with dirty blonde hair. Dean looks at Mary in panic, still walking ahead, chatting, and instead goes to run and get Castiel back. When Dean catches up to him, he sees tears in the corners of Castiel's eyes. "What's wrong, Cas?" Dean says grabbing his hand.
He smirks and rubs his crotch against Castiel’s and he can’t hold back a moan. He lets it fall off his lips and he grips the guys lower back to have more.
Dean is slightly concerned how he would've known this about him but he takes the bite. Maybe he saw Dean flying into the parking lot and plopping down to tell the waitress he has been on the road for the past nine hours and is starved. "It's really cool. Sometimes boring, you know? As long as I have my music with me, then I am okay. And I love my car, too. She's beautiful, I don't think it'd be deserving to leave my baby sitting around the garage."
Dean squirts more lube onto his fingers and fits two fingers inside Cas easily. He rocks his fingers until Cas is fucking back on his hand and he pulls out. “God. You’re fucking sexy.”
But this particular moment hits Dean like a truck. He feels uneasy meeting this new guy who introduces himself as ‘Cassie’s boyfriend.’ Dean looks at Cas like his best friend would correct the guy- but Cas just smiles along and gives this guy one of the softest expressions Dean could only dream of.
“I know I don’t deserve to have your respect, but I hope you can understand why I did this. I wanted you to have the best life, Dean. That’s all I ever wanted for my boys. And I’m sorry I fucked things up so much for you to get here.” John is surprisingly the one who’s in tears. Dean hasn’t seen his father cry since he was ten and they went to their family friends, William Harvelle's, funeral.
Dean and he lazily kiss until the position gets uncomfortable. Even then, they reposition with shared laughter and continue. Even as Dean and he hear Dean’s ringtone going off to alert his calls, they don't move from this moment. The world can wait. They’ve waited too long.
Dean still sprints to their bedroom and he rolls his underwear down and watches his own dick spring free. The tip of his dick is achingly red and he’s leaking precome. He grabs the lube from Castiel’s desk drawer and squirts a generous amount and warms it in his hands before he coats it over himself. The squelch feels so good and he can’t help but jack his hand up and down himself.
Dean gasps on his own wail and brings their lips together. The two of them give in to the kiss, pulling each other closer and closer. Their tongues brushing against each other’s as their tears and snot mix together. Cas groans and pulls Dean with him to the floor. He kisses Dean’s neck and sucks over the exposed skin. Not until Dean moans through his hiccuped cry does Cas pull back.
Cas let’s Dean into the bathroom and explains the kiss with Meg and how he felt. Dean listens and responds, “well it was probably her. Maybe she sucks at kissing. You did fine with me, so it can’t be your fault.” Cas feels a bit of pride knowing his kiss with Dean didn’t make Dean feel this strong sickness like he had shared with Meg.
Cas looks in disbelief still and Dean cups his face. “They all really want to meet you. If that’s something you still want.” Cas nods his head that’s being held in Dean's warm hands. “I really don’t want to overstep and push your boundaries, but I really want to kiss you. Is that okay?”
Castiel hums and blushes a bit which makes Dean only push further. “Who? Oh my god, since when? I swear you never tell me things!”
In his panic, she puts her face close to his and puckers. Castiel gulps again and pecks her lips and pulls off immediately. She looks ecstatic and whispers, “I love you.”
"Okay, bitch." Dean hangs up the phone and smiles at Castiel. "Sorry, so what do you say about getting back to our group before Gabriel finds out about this also."
John sighs, “Dean you know that’s not true. This Cas guy, I get it. He broke your heart. I’m just trying to say I think you can still find someone. You have a lot to offer.” He climbs out from under the car and stands, wiping his oiled hands on a rag.
Dean lets John give him a hug and he holds his dad back. The hug is relatively short and John wipes his eyes off fast after but Dean understands. He thought John would scream at him, ignore it and pretend it never happened, or kick him out of the house. He thought of every possible bad reaction; even the ones he deep down knew would never happen, because that’s how he felt about himself. Hiding every part of himself that brought him joy did not do well for his well-being.
Castiel shakes his head. “Just stop making it harder, Dean, please. I love you, I just can’t do this. It’s hurting me. You are hurting me.”
Dean blankly states, “I think I like Cas.” He feels shocked by his realization but also feels like he’s finally gotten something off his shoulders that he didn’t know he was even carrying.
Dean looks at his father in the doorway and shrugs, standing to meet him. John walks to the garage. John went to bed early after last night's dinner and hasn’t whispered a single word in Dean’s direction until now. And it’s about a fucking car? Of course. Fix a car and remind me you’re still a man. Typical. Dean scoffs at his own thoughts. Despite it all, he follows his dad out.
Dean laughs softly and bites his lip. “Uh- okay. Just for practice?” The two stare at each other for a few seconds and then Dean leans in and puts his lips over Castiel’s lips very slowly. “How was that?”
Since Dean can remember, his family and the two Novak’s have had their annual week-of Christmas party together. Castiel’s mom and he come over to decorate their house and then they invite other families from school and work to attend. This year, his parents and Naomi gave the boys permission to invite a few friends each from school. Dean gave his invites to his friends Benny and Cole and also invited his girlfriend Cassie and her best friends Hannah and Amara.
Castiel slides in and let's Dean adjust to the feeling before he allows himself to carry on. "Fuck me, Cas. I need you to-" Dean pants as Castiel slowly starts to rock into him. Dean laces his fingers into Castiel's and wraps his legs around him. Dean's legs make Castiel wobbly and he is forced to press farther into Dean.
“It's not fair. You have a job, you have the ability to get up and leave. My apartment is small. My job, working at the pet shop, isn't the best for money. Sure I learn a lot from it and I think it's a great thing to do, but I don't have anything else. I don't even have you.” Cas stands up and walks back over to his clothes, “Dean I want to go back. I can't sit here with you when I know you will leave me.”
Gabriel sees Castiel and Claire and smiles. "Hi, you must be Castiel. A face for the name at last." Cas nods at that. Gabriel reaches into his pocket and gives Claire a jolly rancher. "How you holding up kiddo?" Claire shrugs and takes the candy, slowly unwrapping it. "We're going to have a fun day. Don't you worry Claire."
"So tell me, Cas, what made you come here?" Dean wants to jump out of his seat with excitement but he tries to play it cool. Nonchalantly crossing his arms on the tables hard surface.
Krissy crosses her arms, "he won't let me get the tiger." She pouts her lip hoping for a sympathy vote. Castiel squats down onto the ground in front of her and waves Dean away with the other three.
Dean steps closer and rests his hand on Castiel's waist. "I've been living my whole life thinking I couldn't be with a man because I liked women. Thank you- so much."
He finds Ash playing pong and plays a few rounds; only taking a single sip though; because he promised Cas to be the sober one, before he asks Ash where his second-place best friend went. Dean hasn’t seen the guy outside of school for a few weekends and it’s honestly bumming him out.
Cas smiles thinking about everything Charlie has said. She relaxes on the bean bag and stretches her arms. “I do have to ask, though. Are you okay? Truly?” She looks sincere as speaking, “I know how difficult it can be to retreat back into the closet when people we love are still inside. I just want to make sure you’re not struggling to re-find yourself.”
Claire mumbles, "it'd be better if we just ate alone so we can all talk." Castiel laughs and pats her on the head. "Sorry," she whispers.
Emma points to Alex and smirks, "dad I'm going to go to. Alex was telling me about her pet iguana." Dean grins at Cas and points.
Dean coughs, “Cas, I have to hit the road again today. I don't want to leave you, but I have a job. I have to go back eventually.”
Castiel pouts and lays his head on Dean's shoulder. "He called me a cigarette." Mary pulls the wagon with the free hand that's not gripped around Sammy. "What do you mean, sweetie?"
Cas sits up faster than Dean has ever seen Cas move and his friend doesn’t blink. “Are you kidding me? Who! Wait. What the hell, Dean, you’re straight.” He looks flabbergasted and Dean chuckles. “This isn’t funny! Since when did you- you like boys now?”
"Fuck," Dean rubs his hands over Castiel's chest, "how the hell are you so beautiful?" Castiel pants, hooking his ankles around Dean's torso. He slides his hands down, pulling Dean's underwear down a few inches hoping Dean gets the memo.
"I thought- I just- you said you'd be wearing plaid. We were supposed to meet here at 2 and the only person here was-" Castiel feels beyond embarrassed. Why did his friend have to set him up on a blind date? He's never been a fan of this and he's only been on one blind date before this. "I'm sorry. I- uh-" Castiel looks at Dean, "I didn't realize- I didn't even ask your name to make sure-"
