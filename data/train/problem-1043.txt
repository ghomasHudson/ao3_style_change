SIger sat on one of the hard, uncomfortable chairs provided for visitors. A slight, shuddering exhale escaped him.
"Molly –" Mistake. This was a mistake. Molly Hooper wasn't any port in a storm, and he couldn't do this.
Mary stared at the picture of Trish. It was fifteen years old, maybe more, judging by her hair and clothing. She was smiling; her hair was pulled up in a severe twist, and she wore a tightly fitted black jacket. Her hands weren't visible, as the photo had been cropped, but a scope was just visible at its lower edge.
"For a while, anyway," John said with another shrug. "Somewhere warmer for a while, somewhere not…connected with anything. Then, I don't know. We might travel for a few years."
On his way out of the hospital, Sherlock heard whispers and sudden excited, if swiftly strangled, cries. He saw phones aimed at him, and turned round to scowl at one of the intrusive photographers, but the blonde woman came up and tucked an arm in his. "Come on, love. We'll get you back to the hotel."
His face still pushed against Sherlock's chest, John nodded. "Yeah," he said, his voice muffled. "I'm okay. I'm going to…." Carefully, he pulled out and caressed Sherlock’s inner thigh. "Sorry, I'm –"
"Yeah." Benedict stilled. "My shoe was untied, and I put my pen in my mouth to tie it, and I grabbed a raw cable – is that it? Some sort of electrically induced hallucination?"
"I've read about you two in the papers." Her voice, a peculiar mélange of Irish and German accents, rasped out of her narrow chest, and her breath smelled of gin.
"Will it hurt when they do the surgery? Is the surgery what…what kills her?" The tears rolled down Nora's cheeks.
God, he wished people would stop asking him that. He bared his teeth in a poor approximation of a smile. "Fantastic," he said, and slammed the door.
Tom folded the letter and stuffed it back into the envelope. The chocolates had hardened into an uncomfortable knot in his stomach.
"Oh, God!" The cry, far above him, was a low growl, and Sherlock did gag now as the cock thrust hard into his mouth, down his throat, and he felt the spill of semen, like a flood though it wasn't much, not more than average, and he relaxed his throat and let it trickle downward, wet and warm.
He was predictable, true. He'd caught Sherlock glancing at him a bit smugly now and then; their banter had been almost relaxed. In some ways it was as if no time had elapsed at all.
, was sat in front of a microscope all night, trying to sort out dirt molecules and bits of sand and plant matter? Do you think he'd have the brains to work out where you were being held from the contents of your front hall rug and a single sheet of paper? I've met him, you know. He's not exactly aces when it comes to simple cogitation much less complex deductions. And if you haven't been able to work that out, you're even stupider than he is. In fact, you're –" Sherlock halted. Tom was wide-eyed and had shrunk back a bit.
Only last week, Ella had said that John was making significant progress with his anger, but she sensed a new hesitation in him, something he was holding back.
Nobody responded, and Sherlock concluded that the usual parting pleasantries would not be taking place. He about-faced and strode smoothly from St. John's
Moran stopped and gave another papery chuckle. "Of course I was. But not the way you think, you bloody fool." He stepped aside as the butler entered the room, a small but efficient handgun pointed at Sherlock's midsection. "And now, I think you had better leave. Melville will show you out."
"Oh, yeah. Come look." John led the way into a generously sized chamber panelled in rosewood. Flush against the wall stood five Edwardian-era wooden cabinets, two metres high and a metre wide, fronted with pale, swirling marquetry. "No computer. Just these."
"Sherlock, drop the case. I insist." Mycroft walked to the door. "I'll have the car brought round. Good night, little brother." He closed the door.
been some evidence of an interdental lisp in one of the interviews, but not enough to arouse suspicion or merit further investigation. And Sherlock had only spent time with Vertue and Freeman and TWH, who were either accustomed to Cumberbatch's lisp or politely ignored it. Bloody hell, there was always something.
"I don't know anything about it," Benedict said. "It certainly doesn't form any part of our programme."
"That's not very nice," Tom replied, swatting Sherlock on the leg. "Most of them are sweet, you know that. They don't want anything more than a photo or an autograph. Granted, I've had some of them send me some odd art, but it's nothing odder than anything you and I have done. Generally." Tom gave a throaty laugh.
They'd left him so long that he'd fallen asleep, and he couldn't tell how long it had been – the chemical cosh had done a job on his circadian rhythm. He woke with a start and blinked, disoriented in the darkness. His head still ached, and added to that were cramps in both calves and thighs from sitting still for so long, and burning sinuses from the waterboarding. He needed to urinate, but thought he could hold out for a few hours longer.
Tom arched up and climaxed, spurting in Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock gasped, nearly choking, and pulled away, watching in half-appalled fascination as Tom bucked, coming once more before falling back on the bed, panting.
Grateful acknowledgment to kimberlite and vilestrumpet, my most excellent beta/britpick team. Thank you!
"I don't know." Mary got up and checked the rice, then opened the range to peer at the chicken. "This changes a lot, John."
The car Mycroft's people had arranged for them was a Citroën, so ridiculously small that Sherlock's knees banged against the steering wheel – another piece of petty revenge, he suspected. He almost admired Mycroft for it – his brother was the master of the death by a thousand cuts. "I can't wait to see the hotel," he muttered, and started the car.
Lacking anything else to do, John went to Barclays and logged into their account to look at the balance.
Slumping back in the chair, he picked up his spilled scripts and yawned hugely. "Oh, fuck it." He set them on the floor again and stretched his legs out, contemplating his toes. By all rights, he should have been upstairs, getting his brains shagged out, but Ben had decided to be unbelievably weird and even more unbelievably unfaithful, with Mark. Why, for fuck's sake?
John nodded. By all rights he should have been feeling something other than this strange submerged calm. Anger, humiliation at being a dupe, sour triumph that deep down, his suspicions had been confirmed yet again. He felt none of that, not yet. "She's not your aunt. Not a relative at all."
"Budge over," he said, and sat beside her, taking her hand. "Yes, darling. A lot of trouble, I think. I'm going to try to help him."
"Don't blame him. It's not his fault." Sherlock drew his knees up and encircled them with his arms, hugging them close. "He wants to keep his daughter safe, he can't be blamed for that."
In the kitchen, the kettle had begun to whistle. Sherlock frowned. "Hold that thought." He strode away, and Mycroft went back to his contemplation of Baker Street. Sherlock returned with tea and handed a mug to Mycroft. "And?"
It was true that his girlfriends sometimes (oftentimes, if John was being brutally honest) complained about his opacity. It was also true that in the year he'd been living with Sherlock he'd shuffled through an inordinate number of girlfriends, even for him. Good job they didn't get together and compare notes. Everyone needed a little mystery, though, and yet every once in a while people let things slip and showed a side of themselves heretofore hidden.
The door opened again. "Come in, please." The butler stepped aside, and Sherlock walked in, coming face to face with Lord Stephen Moran.
"Ah…okay." John cleared his throat and tried to lean casually against the mantel, as if his prick wasn't approaching critical mass.
"John." Sherlock leant forward. "I've come to ask you not to leave London. Stay. Stay with me, you and Eleanor both."
"Complicated how? Sorry, that's none of my business. Sorry." Slowly, as if he were afraid she would pull away, Jim reached out and covered her hand briefly with his own.
Moriarty beckoned to the two gunmen, and they backed to the door, flanking him. He turned his glistening black gaze on John. He sang softly. "Ashes, ashes…you both…fall…down."
"Good Lord, what sort of television programmes have you been watching? You're severely overestimating the success of DNA testing. Even if they do find some hair, for example, conceivably the only thing besides fingerprints you could have left behind, and given how you were bound between two pieces of furniture, I doubt you left any decent ones, they'd still have to sort it out from all the other hair that's likely down there. They've got a slew of bodies to choose from on his property, I suspect, and because they'll be predominantly female despite the sexual threat you received, I'm certain they're going to work the rape angle more intensely than any other factor. If he starts jabbering about you, you can calmly state that you've been friends for a long time and yes, you get the odd letter or two now and then, but nothing worth worrying about. Act, for goodness' sake." Sherlock paused and cleared his throat. "All that said, I do have to admit that you handled yourself fairly well, considering the situation. Granted there was a good deal more crying than I'd expected, but still."
"Damn it," Mycroft whispered, and threw the bedclothes aside. He found his phone and dialled. "Have you established a trace yet?" He listened and shook his head. "Don't stop until you've found something. Right. No, absolutely not. Not until I tell you. Yes." He rang off and pulled the message up again.
"Sorry." Benedict wiped his eyes and blew his nose a few times. "Sorry," he repeated. "Do you want this…never mind, I'll have it washed for you."
John took a shuddering breath. "Thank you," he said in an equally soft voice. "Thank you." He thought about embracing Sherlock, but Sherlock was holding himself tensely, as if he was afraid that John might attempt a hug and was bracing himself for some uncomfortable proximity. John got the message; he rose unsteadily to his feet and went back to the sofa. "Christ," he said with a shaky laugh. "I'm knackered."
Irene had gone noticeably paler, but tilted a saucy little smile at him all the same. "You'll never crack the code."
"You k –" John pressed his lips together and shook his head. Harsh breath issued from his nose. "You kissed me. You kissed me
? None of the information was the least bit practical; none of it would help him get back home. If he really was permanently trapped here, he'd go round the twist and take hundreds with him.
Mary looked down. When she looked up, her eyes were full of tears. She took a sip of wine and set the glass down carefully. "Jesus, John. I would have told you –"
His phone sat on the arm of the chair, silent. He'd set it to Do Not Disturb except for one number, and silent it remained. He couldn't ask himself why it had happened, or how – that wasn't for him to answer. But he wouldn't make the first move, not yet. Stupid and prideful, maybe, but he couldn't bring himself to call first. Tomorrow, if he hadn't heard from Ben by then. Maybe his dad had been right – you really couldn't trust many people.
"Fine." Sherlock stayed upright long enough to head outside, hail a cab, and climb in without collapsing onto the seat. Once in, he blew out a sigh of relief and surreptitiously flexed his knee. Stupid treacherous bodies….
did the man have? "Hungry?" He sounded a bit air-headed, but then Cumberbatch wasn't exactly overly endowed in the brains department.
Of course there were going to be crackpots. Everyone knew that. Even Anthony Hopkins had regaled him with stories about the letters he'd got after
"Yeah, yeah, everything's fine. My friend got a bit of…erm, product in his eyes, and it's stinging him. So if you've got some eyewash, that'd be great, thanks."
There he was, sitting in the wing chair where John had left him nearly two hours ago. He was reading a newspaper, and looked up when John came in. He smiled shyly. "It's sort of reassuring to see the same petty problems exist from universe to universe as well as the massive and upsetting ones. China and the Middle East have issues right now at home as well, and a pop star's divorce gets more press."
"Thanks." Molly beamed, rubbing her belly. "It's early days still, but we're excited and everything's going well so far. Bit of tummy trouble, but that's all."
Dedalus Communications (tabloid efforts to nickname it DedCom upon its emergence had fallen oddly flat, and that was the extent of John's knowledge of the firm) was headquartered in the top eleven storeys of a shiny East End high rise built three or four years before. Its culture, as far as John was able to determine from the two hours he and Sherlock had loitered in the lobby so far, was the touchy-feely sort – the mood seemed loose, with jeans-and-trainers-clad employees lingering in the lobby pub, sprawling on sofas, playing videogames (there were several huge monitors and lots of consoles in the lobby, along with squishy beanbag chairs) or kicking footbags. A hair salon-cum-massage-spa sat at one end of the lobby, crowded with more employees, all distinguishable by the bright green ID cards hanging round their necks, suspended from bright green lanyards. A loose card, stuffed in a forgetful employee's back pocket: that was Sherlock's quarry. Relaxed as the atmosphere appeared to be, no-one entered through the glass doorway leading to the offices without swiping their card. Swiping out wasn't a requirement; employees entered through one door and left through another. Someone leaving for the day, Sherlock said, who wouldn't miss their card for some time. Then, it was just a matter of deft pickpocketing.
Sherlock looked down and saw John's hand on the seat between them. What if he were to simply cover it with his own – would that be an extraordinary liberty, or would John appreciate it?
"Fine," Sherlock said wearily, and glanced up at John, his cockeyed pupils making him look a little odd, sort of Bowie-esque. "You don't have to wait."
"He wanted me to solve a case." Cumberbatch rubbed his eyes. "And I did, because we'd filmed it already, and it couldn't have gone more smoothly, but then someone murdered Irene. And I didn't mean for it to happen, but if I hadn't, the whole Bond Air operation would have completely collapsed. But she's dead, and it was my fault. Oh, God."
"Yeah. We're not quite that other company, but we're edging close. Or we were, anyway." Moriarty sighed.
"Cloche." Mary mimed pulling a hat down. "That little plum-coloured one, with the feathers on the side. It's in the blue box."
"Deadpan," Benedict said. "Took me a bit to get used to his humour. And he's cool, you know? I think he thought I was a bit of a berk. But we're good mates now. And he's a sweet guy, really – loves his girlfriend, loves his kids –"
"You don't think he's got bomb makings here, do you?" John joked. He opened a door and shone his light in. "Drawing room?"
They led John downstairs with a fair degree of solicitude. Benedict followed helplessly, inwardly writhing with rage and shame. Sherlock would have seized the opportunity to do something drastic, with a maximum of drama, but Benedict lacked Sherlock's nerve. It didn't matter that Sherlock's nerve often dug him and John deeper into trouble – it was the principle of the thing.
he kept telling himself. He was fine, and he could manage. He reached into his pocket for his keys, unlocking the door with a bit of difficulty, since his arms were both weighed down with grocery bags. He shouted a hello to Mrs. Hudson, never rude, before he made his trek up the stairs.
John released a breath he didn't know he'd been holding, and he probably looked quite ridiculous, smiling to himself in an empty room.
It was me. I had gotten shot, I had gotten hurt. I hadn't been quick enough, I hadn't been able to keep up, and now look what's happened. The gunman is running away now, not wanting to get caught at the scene. I can hear his footsteps, hurried, as he skids on his heels and turns the other way.
"Right, yeah. I'll let you get some sleep." John rubbed the back of his neck, feeling a bit awkward. "I'm just down the hall, in case you need anything. Night, then."
A sofa, a rather uncomfortable-looking one at that. Your bare feet are pushed up against one of the armrests, and your head lies on the other, arms pillowed underneath your head as you sleep. You're using your coat as a sort of blanket, far too tall for the sofa, but making yourself fit anyways.
"John. Welcome home." Even the voice of this man, a deep silken sound, was oh-so familiar, a noise that played over and over in John's head, a melody John had thought he'd heard for the final time.
I want to ask. Oh. They're probably taking me to surgery, so that's why. But I want you there anyways. You've broken rules to do what you want before, why not now?
After settling down in the chair across from Sherlock, John sighed, folding his hands together on the tabletop. Sherlock mirrored his position, almost, hands steepled underneath his chin. They both expected each other to speak first, and that was quickly going to become a problem.
"I know, Sherlock. I understand." I nod, then smile slightly. "But really. Go home, shower, change. Eat something, I know you haven't. I'll still be here when you get back."
"Of course, Sherlock. Yeah, let me just-" John bent to grab some of Sherlock's bags, then winced as Rosie started to wail from inside the house. "Ah, I've got to go get her sorted, give me a moment. Take a seat on the couch, there's tea in the kitchen if you'd like it."
John blinked rapidly. He refused to listen to violins, or any song remotely containing a violin. It brought back too many hazy nights and boring days in 221B, where Sherlock would play his violin and compose, and John would sit in his armchair to listen. He loved Sherlock's violin playing, absolutely adored it, and it was something that he missed a lot. But this violin sounded like it was being played live, like it wasn't a recording at all. John was almost afraid to step into the flat, but he did so anyways, his breathing shaky.
Sherlock was dead, and John could see it. Pushing past the people crowded around the detective's body, his mouth dropped open in horror, his heart almost coming to a stop. Blood stained the sidewalk around Sherlock's curly-haired head, his limbs at all odd angles, and as John crouched to press his fingers to the inside of Sherlock's wrist, there was no pulse. Sherlock really was dead, there was no coming back this time, and John's heart began to ache.
When John came to, he was laid neatly on the sofa in the sitting room, covered with a throw blanket and feeling quite dazed. The last thing he remembered was seeing . . . Sherlock. No, that couldn't be possible, Sherlock was
Sherlock was just sitting there, saying nothing at all, and John had every notion to tip the scalding-hot tea over that stupid head of his and-
John awoke with a hoarse scream, his legs twisted within the confines of his bedsheets, his chest heaving as he panted. It took a minute to calm himself down, to remind himself of his surroundings, to convince himself that everything was alright. He was in his bed, in his bedroom, in the flat on Baker Street. John exhaled heavily, sitting up and running a hand through his sleep-mussed hair. His nightmares had taken that form for months, forced to see Sherlock dying over and over again, but they hadn't been that fully terrifying since the first few weeks after Sherlock's suicide.
"John." your voice is hoarse, and I can dimly see your face in the moonlight. "John, listen to me. I
The sound of my voice is immediately cut off by the sound of a gunshot, and I slow, eyes wide. Is it you? Are you hurt? But I don't see you up ahead, you probably disappeared around the corner. Where did the gunshot come from? Where did the bullet go? My chest is heaving with the extra efforts to breathe, so I rest my hand there in an attempt to soothe. My fingers come away sticky, the acrid stench of blood reaching my nostrils.
It took John a minute or so to regain his bearings, blinking slowly as pain began to ebb, in rushes, through his head. He'd have a massive migraine after this was all over and done with, that was for sure, but for now, only one thing was on his mind.
You're hovering over me within seconds, looking a bit unsure about what to say. And what do you say? I was shot, nearly died, and my heart stopped briefly on the operating table. But I'm fine, and I decide to tell you this.
"John." Sherlock sounded as tired as John felt, but at least he was there, a steady presence in John's ear. "Is something the matter? I only inquire as it's late in the evening, you don't usually-"
his head turning so quickly to his right that he twisted his neck, wincing as he rubbed at the sore spot. Perhaps he was still dreaming, as Sherlock was sitting in his armchair, still dressed in his house robe and pajama pants, his brow furrowed in concern.
Sherlock couldn't even do it for himself? Nothing had changed, he was glad to observe. Once done, John settled back into his bed, listening to the sounds of Sherlock thrashing about on the mattress until he was comfortable. He couldn't see Sherlock, not in the darkness of the bedroom, but the mere knowing that he was there soothed John, just the tiniest bit.
that he was seeing what he was seeing at the current moment in time. Sherlock had been dead for two years, and John had seen the body at the bottom of the fall, so this was certainly some hallucination John had somehow managed to conjure up, or some lookalike trying to mess with him.
John squinted at the clock on his bedside table, trying to determine exactly what time that it happened to be.
Sherlock felt surprisingly solid, more solid than a pure apparition should be. John's eyes scanned over Sherlock's figure once more, who looked like he wanted to step closer, but also didn't want to get poked and prodded again. If this wasn't just a figment of John's imagination, that meant . . .
It seemed like no time at all had passed when the doorbell rang, and as expected, Rosie gave a shriek from the nursery. But John'd wait to settle her back down until he let Sherlock in, so he rose from his seat and crossed the room to the door.
I'm in a chair, my chair, the one I've made myself so comfortable in at the flat. You have your armchair, and I have mine. You always look angry when your brother visits and he takes my chair. I wonder why.
Sherlock had just apologized, a rarity for the detective to do. He normally just spoke his mind, not really realizing how rude the facts could really be. But he was telling John he was sorry, and somehow, that mollified John just the smallest bit.
Sherlock laughed as he rose to his feet, striding over to John and taking his hand in a strong grip, pulling him up to a sitting position. "If this were heaven, I certainly wouldn't be there. I'm hardly an angel. Far from it, actually."
"Oh, thank you, Doctor Watson." Mrs. Tawney said with a smile, gesturing to her daughter, young Annie, to come over to her side from the examination table. "Thank goodness, it's been going around at her school, but I just wanted to make sure."
"Okay." Mrs. Hudson released her hand from his arm, blowing her nose into her handkerchief before she spoke once more. "I'll leave you alone to, erm . . . you know."
"Yes, dear." Mrs. Tawney gave a tired chuckle in response, shaking her head as she was tugged to her feet by her eager daughter. "Have a good day, Doctor Watson."
Scrambling to his feet as quick as he could in his current state, John ran to the group of people now gathered around the scene. The police sirens seemed like a mild thrum in the back of his mind, unnoticed and uncared for by the doctor trying to force his way past the crowd.
"My bedroom's filled with boxes, I didn't really feel like cleaning it out tonight." Sherlock's shoulders lifted in a shrug. "I've been in the sitting room on the sofa, but even considering that I've been sleeping on more uncomfortable things the past few months, I couldn't really . . . but forget that. I was just seeing to that you were alright."
"Stop saying that!" Benedict stalked to the wall and leant against it, taking deep breaths, trying to find his center.
of fanfiction – you do know what fanfiction is, don't you? Piles of romantic, empty-headed drivel in which the two of us are endowed to a point of utter absurdity and shatter headboards on a routine basis whilst solving the most banal cases known to humankind, and I assure you, most of it is not fit to line the bottom of a birdcage – he is not interested in me, either romantically or sexually. I'm his
He hadn’t used but a fraction of the Christmas stuff they owned. Mary, a certified Christmas fiend, had collected boxes and boxes of decorations of all sorts – tree ornaments, garlands, sprays of artificial box, holly, and ivy, special Christmas candles and candlesticks, loads of crackers bought at the sales post-season, tablecloths and napkins, tea towels, bloody snow globes, et cetera, et cetera. Eighty percent of their attic space was devoted to Christmas junk, though to be fair it was stowed in boxes and neatly labelled in Mary’s rounded script. He’d ignored it altogether last Christmas. Now that Rosie was beginning to become more aware of her environment, he supposed that she’d appreciate all the holiday things. And she did, squealing with delight at the tree lights and gleefully hanging ornaments – dropping most of them actually, but making a valiant effort just the same. Certainly there was a tonne of stuff to choose from.
"Terrible for me, or terrible for you by association?" Sherlock inquired sharply. If tiptoeing around for the benefit of the papers was the done thing, Sherlock wanted out. Except there wasn't any out, was there? Damn it, damn it to
"Sit." Sherlock slid off the sofa and knelt between John's legs. He undid the button of John's jeans and slid the zipper down. "Be very still." He tugged John's pants down, letting his erection spring free.
As instructed, John stood close to Sherlock as Sherlock swiped the purloined card over the digital reader. The light blinked green, and the glass door unlocked with a click and a hiss. They strode through, John almost tripping on Sherlock's heels, and made for the lift, getting in with a bevy of laughing young men and women. "What do you know about him?" John murmured. "Dedalus?"
"In a manner of speaking. I was here, then I left – and returned a short while ago. Come upstairs, Sherlock." Mycroft spun on his heel and rapidly ascended a curving flight of stairs, balustraded with elaborately carved wood that glowed from years of faithful oiling and polishing. "Come on, don't dawdle."
He leapt to his feet. "John, come on." Heading toward the door, he called out over his shoulder. "Text me the details. I'll be in touch by the end of the day."
"Yes." Mary swatted her bum and spoke to John. "I'm headed for Paris on Wednesday. Just heard, sorry."
TWH sighed. "Don't – look, you've told me about it. A lot of people wouldn't agree, but I think some childhood hurts last longer – it can be a deep impression on a tender soul."
He went to Wikipedia, glad that no-one was watching (Wikipedia, for God’s sake), and gleaned the essential details, scanning rapidly. Theatre, television, film, radio work, personal, etc., etc., etc. Boring, boring, boring, dull, dull, dreary, mildly interesting, dull – good-looking, but the worst hairstyle, dear Christ! – dull, dull, dull –
Three weeks ago, Sherlock had dropped by unannounced in the evening, bringing the microscope he'd purchased for Nora's birthday. The house had been dark, but he'd rung all the same, waiting for fifteen minutes before giving up and leaving the package on the doorstep. He'd texted so as not to alarm John.
"No." Sherlock checked his phone. Email was still working, even if his GPS and power was spotty. "This is the right room. 312." He strode to the cupboard and tore it open. There were clothes inside, hung neatly on pegs:  a tweed jacket smelling strongly of Gauloise Brunes, a pair of trousers, belt threaded through the loops, a pair of shoes, a flat cap. "What the hell?"
"Don't blame yourself," John said softly. "You didn't know." He found the shoes and laid them on the bed.
"Stupid," he whispered, and lay back on the bed. So stupid, not to understand the havoc he'd wrought until it was far too late. Stupider still to carelessly burn a hundred bridges and expect the hundred and first match he'd tossed not to kindle.
"A little later, darling. Maybe Mr Holmes has a spare tablet or laptop you can use." He wanted no errant text messages from Moriarty to reach her – and now he was sure down to his bones that Moriarty had sent those texts and photos. "Listen, Nora. I've got to go away for a bit. Just…maybe a day or two at most."
Molly gaped at him for a moment, then her complexion brightened. "Yeah – yes, definitely! Er – I've got a bottle of red in the fridge, and there's a good pizza takeaway near my flat."
"It's a wonder you bother with me at all." John turned and kissed Sherlock's neck. "So tell me…what else do you know how to do?"
Beyond her voice, John heard the sounds of Mary in the kitchen:  the fridge door opening and closing with a rattle of glass bottles and jars, a metal spoon against the cast-iron frying pan, a cupboard door creaking. They were comforting sounds, familiar, and prompted a peculiar sensation of anger that surprised John with its intensity. He didn't want to talk to Mary any longer. "Well, I'd better be off. Don't wait up, okay?"
"I'll be busy with this tomorrow. Thanks all the same. Besides, I've eaten your cooking before. Plate this, please." Sherlock pointed to a sample of tissue.
Sherlock pushed him into the wheelchair-accessible toilet stall and closed the door. "I need…I need…." He didn't know what he needed, exactly, but that didn't matter either. He sank to his knees and despite the havoc the alcohol was wreaking on his nervous system, unbuttoned and unzipped Marcroft's trousers with expert precision.
It was the wrong thing to ask. John's stance became even more pugilistic, his chin more sharply outthrust. "Why would I?"
John took his own phone out and idly flicked through his texts. "Heavier than I remember, that's all I'm saying."
Moving only his eyes, he took in the state of his flat. It was pretty terrible, if he were honest with himself. Messy and disorganised even by his reckoning, dusty and damp at the same time (a neat trick, actually), something ponging unpleasantly and unidentifiably in the kitchen. Mrs Hudson had thrown up her hands and written down a list of cleaners, leaving it pointedly over a stain on the fridge, but he hadn’t got round to calling anyone yet. Perhaps in the new year. Possibly.
All this finery seemed like a capitulation on Mary's part, an acknowledgment of yearning for the unattainable. "Mary, we can't accept this. Tell Trish thank you, but we've got to send it back."
Benedict wasn't touching that one. Nobody agreed on the state of Sherlock's finances. "I like it there."
"Only one way to find out," Sherlock said. "Well – come on, John." Sherlock dashed out of the cab, leaving John to pay the driver. He approached Moran's house briskly. "Lady FitzSimmons?"
Benedict didn't try to rise. "No, he doesn't." He placed the tips of his fingers together and spoke slowly, certainty forming just before the words tumbled out. "Moriarty's mad as a hatter, but he's no fool. If he thought you were only a pet, he'd have no compunction about simply putting a bullet in your head. He knows better. He knows –" Benedict broke off, unsure of what he'd been about to say.
Shaking his head, Mycroft sighed. "She's still in surgery. It will be several more hours until we know anything."
so, even if Sherlock himself thought it was rubbish. John needed comfort and strength, and anything that might grant that was all to the good.
Everyone (not the surrounding diners – Sherlock's tiny diatribe hadn't been delivered in the sort of foghorn voice that seemed to be Peter's speciality) stared at Sherlock in stupefaction. Clearly the most prudent action to take was departure. Accordingly, Sherlock scraped his chair back and rose.
"Just do it," Benedict snapped. The wall looked like ordinary plaster. There'd be no chance of ricocheting. He hoped.
"Jesus Christ," John said. "I sold the fucking house. What am I going to do? Where the hell are we going to live?"
Sherlock went, unafraid but not particularly keen on getting shot for the sake of one broken-backed toff's ravings. Melville opened the door, but Sherlock stopped at the threshold. "So. What is the source of it all, Lord Moran?"
"—but the writer mentions cutting out your lying, thieving…um, prick-licking tongue. Not someone you had a relationship with once?" Were that the case, the stalker could be bumped up to rejected/resentful.
"And he's been quiet, you know that too. No further contact with North Korea, at least. But did you know that he's been buying art at auction under condition of anonymity?" Sherlock grinned at his brother's expression of surprise.
"Sorry?" Sherlock repeated. "What on earth for? I failed to speak up so many times that I actually became comfortable with it. I told myself that your emergence in my life was an accident of circumstance and that friendship was perfectly acceptable. I hadn't the courage to hurdle my own obstacles. I declared my adoration for you to a room full of people. What more perfect barrier could there be?"
It was a spectacularly pretty day already. Light flooded the kitchen (seven-thirty-six, the clock on the range read) and the sky through the windows was the softest of pastel blues. Perfect. Tom rummaged in the fridge and cupboards and whisked up an egg-white omelette with spinach and feta, enough for two. He put the kettle on, got a pot of tea ready, and stuck some bread in the toaster. Whistling, he went into the front room, found a couple of magazines, and brought them into the kitchen, hoping he wouldn't have to read and that Benedict would smell the food cooking and drift down, tousle-haired and sleepy-eyed and hungry – he'd hardly eaten a thing last night.
Beside him, John heard Nora take in a quick breath. His heart clenched, but he shook his head. "I…I wish I could, Sherlock, I do. But we need the change of scenery. Both of us."
John was in the flat, walking down the hallway to Sherlock's room, calling out the detective's name. But as he pushed the door to Sherlock's bedroom open, the sight that greeted him nearly caused him to faint in shock. Sherlock, suspended from the ceiling by his own scarf, his body lifelessly twisting back and forth in the scarf's hold. Oh,
could've prepared John for the sight that lay before him. Sherlock, lifeless on the sidewalk, crimson red quickly spreading over the pavement from beneath dark curls. The impact of the bicyclist hitting him seemed to finally take effect, and John groaned as his legs gave out, although he was quick to get onto his knees. He took Sherlock's wrist in his hand, fingers searching for a pulse.
The doctor sighed and shoved the photo back in place, slamming the drawer shut as he grabbed his jacket and headed for the door, locking the office behind him. The woman at the desk said goodbye to him, like always, and he merely gave a nod in her direction, like always. A familiar routine, which he always stuck to. Today was a Tuesday, which meant it was time to go buy groceries at Tesco so the fridge and pantry weren't bare. He kept his shoulders hunched and head down as he walked, the sidewalk quite busy at this time of day, as it always was. Tesco was only a short walk from here, and from there, a short walk back to the flat.
I manage to not fall asleep, and the sirens come before I know it. The ambulance is suddenly there, and I'm being lifted, strapped down. Although, I keep my eyes on you, and you do the same to me. But the doctors are trying to hold you back as I'm put into the ambulance, and you look furious.
Sherlock looked exhausted, not having even stripped himself of his outerwear, although he did pour himself some tea. He cradled the mug in his hands, but did not drink.
In the days after Sherlock's death, John had convinced himself fully that Sherlock would come strolling into 221B, alive, and it would be like nothing had happened at all. But as the weeks had dragged on, his hopes had been drowned in sorrow, and he'd given up on the chance of ever seeing Sherlock again. But yet, it seemed that miracles really could happen.
Life goes on. Or rather, it's supposed to. But things in John's life never really went the way that they were supposed to, and he'd learned to live with it. The Final Problem had come to pass, they were picking up the pieces of the aftermath, and Baker Street was due to begin its rebuild within the week. Things were good, or were supposed to be. Life was meant to move on, but yet.
It's okay, though. I'm not afraid to drown, because you're here, and we'll die together. I'm suddenly aware that we're holding hands, and why are we holding hands?
"You're going to make it through this, John, I know you will." you say, your voice firm, confident. "You aren't going to die. Not today."
It was only after Mrs. Hudson walked away that John stepped ever closer to Sherlock's grave, a hand resting on top of the smooth black marble. He never imagined he'd have to see this day, to be here, experiencing this. The entire thing was rather horrible.
"I wasn't allowed to." Sherlock looked guilty. "Once again, John, I do apologize for what I put you through. You want me out, just say the word. I'll go. You won't hear from me again."
John must have been hallucinating, and then he'd fainted. But how on earth had he gotten to the sofa? He didn't think Mrs. Hudson was strong enough to carry him.
. We lay together on a bed. Your bed, I know that, I've seen it when I pass your bedroom and the door is open. Water is slowly filling the room, although I can't see where it's coming from.
You look slightly hesitant, but you nod anyways, grabbing your coat and shoes before walking barefoot out into the hallway. I watch you go, but I am not sad. I know you'll do everything as quickly as possible so you can get back here, and that's fine with me.
John nodded before going into the sitting room to shut off the telly, putting Sherlock's mug in the sink. He'd wash it in the morning. Sherlock was in the bathroom by then, soft light flooding out from underneath the shut door, so John left him to it, going to his own bedroom.
I can hear the sofa creaking now, so you're probably getting up, or at least shifting. But I hear the sound of your bare feet hitting the linoleum, so it must be the former.
"No, please, there's just one more thing, mate, one more thing: one more miracle, Sherlock, for me. Don't . . . be . . ." John's voice broke then, and his eyes filled with tears. " . . . dead. Would you do . . . ? Just for me, just stop it. Stop this."
Benedict picked up a sandwich and munched on it, still staring at the letter. He rubbed his fingers and thumb over it, flipped it over, flipped it again, and re-read, his eyes tracking the single-spaced words rapidly. He set the sandwich down and felt blindly for his cup of tea.
tired, but he said it more for Sherlock's benefit; Sherlock looked as if he was about to drop to sleep on the spot.
Sherlock met John's eyes, but John's gaze slid away quickly. "I see. Well, I'll certainly give the matter some consideration. Will Mary be there as well?" John's gaze came back to Sherlock, and Sherlock waited, tensing internally for a scathing retort.
"I hope so," Benedict said uneasily. "I – oh, God!" He jumped a little as the spheres in their hands brightened suddenly, expanding balls of pure gold light, bathing them in it, enveloping them in a warm glow. The spheres dimmed then, and the black walls around them seemed to expand, falling away into deeper blackness, a rich ink spattered with colour Benedict had never seen in such profusion and beauty, and it took him a moment to realise that what he was seeing couldn't possibly be real.
, whoever you are." Who in God's name used chloroform to render someone unconscious nowadays? It was notoriously inefficient as it took forever to take effect and the possibility of permanent damage was high. However, if the victim was dosed with GHB prior to the inhalant, then it would be easier to take someone down. Much easier.
"Sherlock? What the f – what are you doing here?" Some infinitesimal part of John's heart began to glow with warmth despite the brusqueness of his question; Sherlock had come to say goodbye after all. He wasn't as indifferent as John had feared.
"You go to Brighton, you find out who actually committed the murder, and you have them arrested. Get Mycroft to help you, get Lestrade – Christ, get Donovan and Anderson if you have to, because clearly you're not competent to resolve this on your own."
"You have reached the main office of Chelmsford City Racecourse. The office is now closed. Please call during our normal operating hours of nine o'clock A.M. to six o'clock P.M. and someone will be happy to assist you. Thank you."
John jerked the scarf away and bunched it in one hand. Instant heat rose in his face. "Yeah. Noxious chemical compounds and rubbish skips, mostly. Your hat doesn't smell, does it?"
Violet tightened her mouth and continued as if the guard hadn’t spoken. “We’ve reloaded your tablet. All sorts of marvellous books – physics, mathematics, literature, architecture just for starters. I think you’ll be sure to find something you like. I included some magazines, and there’s a book of Satie, sheet music I mean. Sherlock thought you might enjoy that one.”
With some difficulty, John swivelled his legs out the car and slowly rose to his feet, wincing at the tingling in his legs. His head still hurt where Moran had clocked him, and he was thirsty; but worse than all that, he was frightened. He hadn't a plan. Mycroft had no idea where he was, now that Moriarty had taken his wire and murdered the security detail. He stumbled as Moran hauled him out by the arm and half-dragged him to where Moriarty and the other thug stood waiting.
He stretched and opened his naked legs invitingly, but John was ignoring him, poring over a stack of CVs. "Just pick one, for God's sake, and come back to bed."
John was fading; he felt it in his limbs, his suddenly thick tongue, his tired, already-fogged brain. He heard Benedict cry out again, and wanted to help, but he wasn't capable of it. His vision dimmed and his eyes slipped closed.
Safe in the well-lit, temperature-controlled confines of her storage compartment in Forest Hill, Mary laid out her kit rapidly and methodically. There was no time to be angry at John for his refusal to listen or compromise; no time for self-recrimination, though there was a truckload of that just waiting round the corner for when she had a free minute; and certainly no time to curse Jim Moriarty for changing the rules of the game or even to think about why he'd done so.
"Clearly," John said, and sat again. He opened the address book and paged through it. "These are all escaped Nazis?"
"What did I – do you know that Jim Moriarty is sitting in your flat at this very moment?" Cumberbatch's eyes were wild. He paced back and forth in their little white box.
Moriarty reached out and gently grasped Benedict's chin. "Shut your fucking mouth, darling." He let go and went back to caressing the plastic-wrapped gun. "So, as I was saying, Johnny…this little toy isn't quite legal, is it?"
His phone buzzed with a text, and he frowned, picking it up. Unknown number. Annoying – as many precautions as he took to keep his number private, he couldn't prevent the odd misdial. He opened the text.
He looked over at the phone, and his stomach fluttered – very uncharacteristic. His gastrointestinal system was comfortingly and sometimes depressingly resilient.
"Please tell me you didn't go shopping with her." John felt his blood beginning to boil. He picked up the carrier bag and started taking things out. Jumpers, jeans, skirts, little lace-trimmed nighties. He squinted at one of the tags that hadn't been removed properly. "Three hundred pounds – for a
Suddenly entranced with the notion of witnessing a conversation between Sherlock and his daughter, John stifled a grin. "I'll ask him, but we won't be upset if he doesn't come, okay?"
"Not yet." Wasn't quite a lie. "Sorry, my phone was off. I just saw them and decided to call you. Everything all right?"
"Fine." Sherlock pushed off the covers, rose gingerly, and limped into the bathroom, closing the door behind him. He came out after a minute and thumped back onto the bed. "Did you question the desk clerk?"
"I'll tell Sir Mycroft you're here, Mr Holmes," Mycroft's butler murmured, taking Sherlock's coat. "Please wait in the library."
"So what specific places did the money lead to?" Sherlock tensed and relaxed again. Patience; hurrying would get him nowhere fast.
A photograph of Trish was inserted into tiny slots on the left side of the card. On the right was a message in the same swirling calligraphy.
The locks popped up, and the rear hatch opened. Something heavy thudded into the back, and the hatch went down again. Tom heard the front driver-side door opening, and a laugh.
“My goodness, it’s been such a busy week. Your dad and I went shopping yesterday and it was impossible to get through the streets, they were so choked with people. We had to hire one of those new car services just to travel a few squares.” Violet pushed more gifts through the sliding glass slot. “We’ve brought you some warmer pyjamas – do you see? They’re satin, with a lovely flannel lining. So much better what with the temperature so frigid in here.” Even if it wasn’t truly cold, it felt cold because of the oppressive grey stone and cement, and the long swaths of glass. No privacy at all – not even in the tiny water closet. It was utterly appalling, particularly for a young woman. Violet was certain the guards watched and leered, no matter what Mycroft had said about their discretion.
"No, no. It's my aunt. Trish. She died yesterday morning. Or…yesterday morning in St. Louis, I guess." She let out a shuddering sigh.
"You didn't have any clean glasses." Moriarty thrust a 400-millilitre beaker half-filled with water under John's nose. "Whispering sweet nothings, Johnny-boy? Oh, hey, look, he's up."
"No, no need. We mustn't take up any more of your time," Sherlock said with a broad smile, and patted John on the shoulder. "
Sherlock tried to control his trembling with little success. It was, he realised, a panic-induced response to torture, made worse by familiarity and anticipation. In Serbia, they'd waterboarded him four times in twenty-four hours, making it clear that it was hardly the beginning of his interrogation, a tactical error on the part of his captors. He'd steeled himself and kept silent; perhaps if they'd told him it was the only torture he'd receive, he'd have talked. This was the same. He had to bide his time. They'd bound him to the chair in his shirt and trousers, no socks or shoes or jacket or coat, but likely those things were still on the premises, and his phone with them. The GPS was activated; Mycroft would –
Tom managed to turn over and look around. He was in a smallish room, damp, smelly, lit by a bare dangling bulb on a chain. He had an impression of walls crowded by dark, hulking shapes that he realised was furniture:  a wardrobe, stacked chairs, trunks. Henry was crouched over one shape, fussing with something. As he straightened and turned, Tom focussed his aching eyes and saw coils of rope in Henry's hands. "Henry…what are you doing? It's...."
"Whatever she's done, she'd never –" John rubbed his mouth. "I'll bring him home, I swear it, Mycroft."
"Yeah, of course you." Benedict felt his chest loosening a little. This was something he could talk about with utter ease, and who didn't like hearing about themselves, even weird alternate universe versions of themselves? "Martin Freeman plays John Watson. He's brilliant, he's just like…well, he does a really great job at being you."
"Okay, then." John sighed and settled back against the seat. Not that it wasn't nice to be out of jail, honestly. He'd had to share a holding cell with three other men (one drunk and belligerent, one drunk and semi-conscious and smelling of sick, and one guy who looked like the poster child for the National Front) as it was evidently a busy Saturday night. He'd wedged himself into the corner and fixed a nasty don't-fuck-with-me scowl to his face, but had been more than relieved when the security team came for him.
Gathering himself together, he rose into a crouch, then to his feet. He wobbled just a little, but steadied himself on the table and after a few seconds, felt his equilibrium return. He glanced down at the table. It was covered with more stuff than usual, and it smelled – oh, God! – it smelled like a kipper factory. Foul.
"Crumpets! Will you still be here tomorrow?" The woman turned and smiled at John, who smiled back without speaking, not confident in his ability to fake an accent. "He doesn't really do appointments, but if you can give me some idea of a time, I can check with him –"
A diffuse, shimmering uncertainty shifted John's insides. "You can stay in here if you want to read."
"Don't dawdle, John." Sherlock limped across the grass and made a beeline for the conservatory. He got in using the same method from the previous evening – much easier now – and led John into the house.
at the Donmar, set in the Maratha Empire, with a famous actor in the lead. The production had been all right – the sets and costumes were fantastic and the actors had been good – but the character of Hamlet had annoyed her so much that during the interval she'd almost begged John to leave. John had clearly been enjoying the play, though, so she'd sat through the rest of it in quasi-agreeable silence, grinding her teeth.
As he slid in, he saw someone in the passenger seat. A light clicked on, illuminating Lord Stephen Moran.
Sherlock grinned. "Murder by pressure drop. Really clever." He whirled; a spray of porpoise snot flew from the membrane as he marched back into the kitchen. "It was his brother, Vasily," he called. "Not an oligarch by any stretch of the imagination – he acted as Petr's press secretary, rode his coattails, got jealous. Predictable, boring. He found out he was the principal beneficiary in Petr's will, though, and while they were in Belize, the pair of them went SCUBA diving with a local friend, a physician. Whilst they were on the ocean floor, Vasily cut Petr's weights."
TWH shook his head. "Ben has a good working relationship with most people. I'd hate to see it damaged. The thing with Mark –" He shook his head. "That alone is going to cost him God knows what. You can use the shock as –"
"Okay, okay. I can make restitution to John. Jeez. It wasn't as if you were crazy about her, Sherlock." Moriarty uttered another giggle. "Look, you're not still peeved over the beating? God, it couldn't have hurt that much. You look fine."
Sherlock smiled. "Family, then. You wouldn't be possessive of it otherwise, would you? And not extended family and casual friends, either – people can be so funny about nicknames, can't they? Casual friends get so excited about calling people stupid names – Googie or Tiger or Snaffles. Tightly knit families close ranks on that sort of thing, though; they bristle when one exceeds boundaries. You wouldn't have asked me where I'd heard it if it was the sort of nickname that found its way into the society pages. So Steenie is only Steenie to a rare few."
“I’ll go.” Sherlock moved toward the stairs. Maybe if he stayed up there long enough – possibly even changed Rosie’s nappy – John would attack the kitchen.
"True. True." Moran wiped his eyes, pulled out his phone, and fiddled with it, sending a text. "Would you like to meet my brother, Mr Holmes?"
"He's at home. With Nora," Mary said, battling the terror that threatened to choke her. "Should I call –"
"What? Are you okay?" John rolled off, afraid he'd pushed Sherlock too far. Sherlock wasn't terribly experienced, after all.
"No," Benedict said, then almost unconsciously elongated his spine and arranged his features into an expression of irritated boredom. "I don't see why any of this is necessary, though I am impressed that you responded within the three-hour window you usually allow." He let the rhythm of Sherlock's speech pattern settle onto his palate. "I mean, good job I wasn't bleeding out because I'd almost certainly be dead now, but still – nice effort. Gold star."
Mycroft clasped his hands together tightly round his umbrella and drew in a deep breath. Gradually, he collected himself.
After a few moments the noise subsided again, leaving only the headache in its wake. Sherlock opened his eyes and saw only blackness. He blinked and felt something soft over his eyes.
The coffee table in front of the sofa held the contents of Sherlock's text and their assorted methods of delivery. Mycroft eyed them with distaste and then examined Sherlock, who was insouciantly turning pages in his book –
"I'm coming! What the hell, John?" Sherlock limped into the kitchen, practically unchanged from its original 19th century configurations. An Aga stove and a rounded refrigerator from the 1950s were the only concessions to modernity. He saw nothing amiss. "What?"
Belatedly, Sherlock realised that he hadn't climbed into Mycroft's car. "Is this a word or a kidnapping?"
Benedict grinned, pleased with himself despite the severity of his predicament. "Thanks. Look, I'm really sorry about all this. I wanted to tell you, but I thought you'd have me sectioned."
"Oh, no. I'm fine, absolutely fine," Sherlock said, getting to his feet. Wobbly. Still a bit wobbly. "You're very kind, Mr…?"
"You haven't got anything better to do. Come on, let's go." Sherlock pushed himself off the bed, picked up his coat from the chair, and shrugged into it, dropping his phone into the pocket.
"Tell him it's in connection with the death of Meredith Howe. I think he'll want to speak to me. Tell him my name."
Benedict opened his eyes, or tried to, but they were heavy, iron weights for eyelids. His face hurt, three separate points of discomfort:  his eye where John had punched him, his cheek where he'd been slapped, and his mouth, which burned and stung inexplicably. His hands hurt, too, and so did his shoulders. He groaned.
“They have to keep a close watch. More fuss in the cell would make things difficult and distracting.”
Janine wrinkled her nose. “Bit stuffy. Why don’t you get something fun like that yellow frock you wore to the wedding?”
"Oh, you make me sound terrible, John." Sherlock threw the door open, releasing the mingled fumes of stale food, primarily some horrid boiled cruciferous vegetable, cigarette smoke, and urine. He held the door for John and led him down a bilious yellow hallway that had probably been intended to convey a cheerful, sunny mood when it had first been painted, likely in the mid-Sixties judging by the age and layers of chipping. "Maybe a little."
"He killed himself. It was totally unexpected. Mycroft was closing in, and I suppose it was that or be captured. Drastic solution, though." Benedict thought of the scene they'd filmed on the rooftop. Moriarty…well, Mycroft had emphatically stated that he was dead. If Mycroft Holmes said something….
More footsteps sounded on the stairs, and Mrs Hudson rounded the corner with a tea tray. "Oh! You've got company, dear."
"He's upset, obviously, but fairly composed, I guess. He's a tough guy." Cumberbatch smiled a little.
It was really, really awful when you thought you knew someone, and it turned out you didn't know them half as well as you'd thought. Wasn't quite
Moriarty rose to his feet and stuffed John's weapon into his pocket. He moved toward the door and stopped between the two gunmen. "I haven't quite decided yet, but I'll let you in on it when I do. Promise. Until then…." He paused and glanced at himself in the mirror over the mantel, then smiled down at Benedict. "The game's on again, and this time it's for keepsies, Sherlock. I owe you."
Perhaps he'd ask Mycroft to expedite the DNA analysis after all. He didn't like the little needle of suspicion that pricked at him; there was every possibility that he was wrong, and what if his own personal prejudices were interfering with his process? He hadn't been able to shed the low-grade anxiety that had gripped him since the sheep farmer's visit. Once he sorted this question out – one way or the other – everything would be easier.
Sherlock sighed. "That's Mycroft being a romantic, or perhaps just overselling the case. Highly unlikely, even if the pieces stayed in the hands of descendants of thieves, that they'd actually carry on their ancestors' sympathies. Probably something much duller. Lib Dems or something, who knows." He clasped his hands behind his back. "God, this lift's slow."
As ever, I owe so many thanks to kimberlite and vilestrumpet for fantastic beta and britpicking skills. *mwah*
John leant down and gave Nora a fierce hug. "No. No. I'm fine." He held her away. "You stay here, and I promise I will be back as soon as I can. Give us a kiss, all right?"
"I see." Graham's eyes narrowed, and his cheeks were even pinker. "Right." He pivoted quickly and marched out of the loo, swinging the door wide open. His grand trampling exit was a bit spoilt by the soft hiss of the anti-slam device on the door.
"Yeah, I know. Stay still anyhow, I've got eyewash." John gently pushed Sherlock back to the bed and fetched a hand towel from the bathroom. "Open your eyes as much as you can. This might sting."
John took a seat opposite Mary and watched her face as she looked at the picture. She swallowed, and her brow contracted. She reached out and turned the photo face-down on the table, the folded her hands in her lap, keeping her eyes lowered.
"Your concern is noted," the Under-Secretary said. Tall, with the build of the ageing rugby player he was, he handed the glorified screw a sheet of flimsy. "The code words are correct, I believe?"
shared traits, that whole lack of social skills thing we worked up, and the arrogance, that's completely accurate, and –" He gasped as the blindfold was torn away, and brilliant white light seared his vision. Benedict screwed his eyes shut, and his heartbeat thundered in his ears. He waited, shaking with fear.
The man's eyes widened and he took a tiny step backward. "I can call a taxicab for you if you wish, Mr Cumberbatch." His voice and posture went stiff and chilly.
Two cars waited nose to nose at the launch pad:  a black Mercedes and his own steel-grey Bentley. He got out of the 'copter first and headed for the cars, waiting for the Under-Secretary, who hadn't spoken a word during their ride. It was a little loud for conversation, true, but no time like the present. Jim's driver got out of the car and opened the rear door. "Not yet," Jim said. "Unfinished business." When the man joined him, Jim smiled. "Thanks for that. Another hour and I might have had to eat lunch."
"Yeah. Get a Volvo, a couple of Labradors, some tweed jackets, join a shooting club…Christ, can you imagine? I couldn't do it, Sherlock. Couldn't leave London. Could you?"
Sherlock dropped the tube and put his hands on TWH's inner thighs, spreading them further apart. He bent and suckled on the tip of Tom's cock, tracing his tongue round the head, delicately touching the slit. He unfastened his trousers with one hand and grasped his cock, rubbing frantically as Tom writhed and cried out underneath him.
John came up for air, red-faced and sweating. "Sherlock, I want…." He paused, clearing his throat. "I want to fuck you."
A male voice said, "Oi, that's Sherlock!" Sherlock stiffened and was about to turn, then realised they were talking about…not him. Not exactly. Cumberbatch, who played him. He felt the intensity of stares, the bodily pressure of people drifting closer and closer to him.
Sherlock flapped a dismissive hand. "Relax, John. We've just got to get back on the R238. I'm sure I saw a sign for St Francis Road there."
He assembled the food and tea on a tray and brought it back to the coffee table. Benedict was lying full-length on the sofa, staring holes into the letter. "Creepy, isn't it?" Tom said, putting the tray down and sitting on the floor beside the sofa.
"Twice as good a reason for you to get an MRI. You'd think that you'd be more careful about the housing for your loaf. So shut up, would you?"
John rolled over and tried to scramble away, but a hard hand grabbed the back of his collar and dragged him up. Out of his working eye, he saw Benedict had risen from his seat and was staring, frozen in horror.
, but surely there must be something twigging, mustn't there? He couldn't imagine Sherlock grabbing Tom's wrists and pinning them behind his back, pushing Tom up against the marble tile of the shower stall, thrusting forward until he'd pressed Tom almost flat, kicking his ankles apart, and holding his wrists closed with one hand, slowly sliding two soap-slick fingers up Tom's arse, just the way he liked it, the way that made him whimper and bite his lower lip in an effort to keep silent.
"'The universe is rarely so lazy,'" Sherlock parroted automatically. "Magnussen was the linchpin, not Mary. He had something on everyone, absolutely bristling with information, you know that – it wasn't as if he made a secret of it, either." Mycroft wasn't saying anything about the Howe case. He didn't know. Maybe there was still time to undo things. He'd call Molly, have her cancel the DNA test on the blond hair, tell Mary to get out of the country for a while, lie low, leave Nora with John.
made for great television drama, but it was no way to treat a real human being. "John…don't be stupid."
He had to admit, though, that he was just the tiniest bit disappointed that Sherlock didn't seem to understand it. They were chiral, the two of them, certainly, but that had its joys, and he'd taken such pleasure in watching Sherlock for so long, and once he'd revealed himself at the pool, he'd thought that Sherlock's delightful curiosity would have taken over, and the process of balance would begin. Possibly he should have seen it coming; he'd left the room, waited for Sherlock for a couple of minutes, and then had got impatient.
He wasn't quite certain, but he thought he heard an audible pop and sizzle as his brain shorted out.
"Would you…." John hesitated. "Would you look after her? If it is Moriarty, I'm afraid he'll try…try to get at her."
Hot blood surged into John's face. "You're the reason we didn't speak for four years. Did you know that? He tried to tell me about you, but I wouldn't fucking listen. Didn't want to believe it, because I thought –" He broke off, conscious that he was about to say something far too incriminating, although Mary was on the right track. She was no fool.
John set the scope against Sherlock's chest. "Nice deep breath. Good. Another. Now normally." He listened to Sherlock's lungs, then picked up the thermometer. "Want to pull your hair back for me?" That first time had been unconscious – he'd touched Sherlock's face and hair without thinking. Now it felt odd, slightly artificial. Sherlock obliged without any discernible change in expression. "Good. Blood pressure." It was good, and Sherlock's blown pupil hadn't diminished, but it wasn't larger. "You seem fine. I'll let you sleep three hours this time."
) and while he wasn't entirely carefree now, he no longer had to worry about most of the quotidian things that troubled ordinary people. He'd got soft somewhere along the way to this point. Mycroft had been right. All he could do was ape Sherlock's mannerisms. He couldn't
thinking those things. It was some fan seeing things that clearly weren't there, scribbling away at nonsense, coming up with absurdities, projecting their own loneliness and longings onto a couple of television actors.
"They're doing them." Sherlock leant back against the comfortable sofa. "They're the reason the IPO was more than three billion pounds."
And that was happening more and more of late. If John had been the introspective type (only since he'd started therapy had he begun to question himself at all. What a mixed blessing that was) he'd have connected some dots:  these occasional, becoming more frequent, little reveries about Sherlock, his markedly pronounced pinball-machine dating habits, and the stealthily encroaching feeling that something new and upsetting was insinuating itself into the fabric of his life and could only be detected now and again in moments of vulnerability and sensitivity.
"Shoot." He tried to view the man standing in front of him as a writer, an actor, but suddenly he only saw Mycroft in awful clothes and a two-day growth of beard. Difficult to reconcile, highly improbable, but not, with a little imagination, entirely impossible.
"I take it the gentleman who spoke to Lord Moran, if that was indeed Lord Moran, is no longer there," Sherlock said.
Sherlock wobbled over to the chairs and took one, surreptitiously adjusting the knife tucked into his briefs so that he wasn't dead on it when he sat. Moaning, he leant forward and breathed hard.
"You've got the same blot on your eye that I do. Same teeth, same nose, same hands, same pattern of hair growth. Now I'm not a betting man, but I'd make an exception in this instance. I'll wager you haven't got a twin either."
"I'm okay." There was a nervous chuckle. "Well, actually, not quite. I guess you heard all those messages."
"Stick it on my tab," Mary retorted. She sat back and watched Tim make three attempts to slide the phone into his pocket before giving it up and setting it on the sofa beside him. "So how long have you known?"
Teeling pointed to the door next to John's. "He's in there, sir. Here, I'll let you in." He produced a key card from his pocket and slid it into the lock. It glowed green and clicked open. "There you are."
"I promise," John said, feeling peculiarly cosy and contented. Not that it was comfortable to have Mary fretting, but it was nice to be fussed over a bit, and he wasn't worried for himself. Sherlock, now…how had he managed not to get himself killed in the past four years?
"There we are," Dr Roche said. "You can put your trousers on, Mr Holmes. I'm going to have Robbie take you into the next room for a bit – he'll take your blood pressure and give you an instruction sheet." She peeled off her nitrile gloves and tossed them into the bin. "The most important thing to remember is that you rest that knee for two days at least, and no strenuous activities for a week."
Mycroft sat silently and wondered if perhaps he'd done the wrong thing. Maybe it would be better if Sherlock stayed away from this case after all. But there was only so much Mycroft could do, difficult as it was to admit – Georgina was proof of that, after all.
like Benedict. And if he didn't have a concussion and his brain wasn't projecting hallucinations as he slowly bled, he
£4,537,894.09. And that, apparently, was after the house payment. And their credit cards – it looked like Mary had paid all of them off in one fell swoop. And their energy and utilities bills. They were solvent. Flush. Filthy fucking rich.
John shook his head, then waved his hand airily and gave that reflexive smile again. "Nothing. Nothing."
John flinched backward and felt a bite of pain at his wrists. Unyielding plastic, uncomfortably tight.
"Mm. I noticed, whilst perusing your back catalogues, that a good number of unclaimed pieces – all of them, actually – were guaranteed by a third party." He didn't see so much as feel John's confusion, and turned to quickly explain. "The sale of art is such a speculative venture. It's common practice to sell a work prior to an auction to a third party at a minimum price, creating a reserve price to fall back on. Sometimes the house guarantees a work, but it's much more desirable, not to mention reassuring, to get a third party to guarantee."
"All right." Benedict sat, certain his face was bright pink. Abashed and humbled, he dug into his eggs and inserted a forkful into his mouth. John had waited until he was up to begin breakfast, and that small consideration, especially in light of what had preceded it last night, made Benedict want to take John by the shoulders and thank him for his thoughtfulness.
