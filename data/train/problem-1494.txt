John pays and swiftly follows after him, opening the door and following him up the stairs. Instead of his usual bound Sherlock takes them slowly, as if considering every step. In all their time together, John has never seen him like this. Not when Sherlock previously stayed awake for days on end pursuing cases, not even when they got together and John was allowed to see the more intimate, private sides of him. Now, Sherlock stands in the living room, as if lost, until John gently nudges him into their bedroom.
He helps Sherlock move under the covers, adjusts his pillow so it’s just the way he likes it.
John sidesteps it. “His wound is healing well, he was brilliant on our last case and his headaches have been better over the past few days. What else is there to discuss? He’s fine.”
A light bubble of excitement rises inside him, a pleasant relief from the itchy-tingly mess of his skin. Now he is in hell, and hell is rehab at midnight on a Tuesday. But not for much longer. There’s light at the end of the tunnel that he thought was a dead end.
“Liar. I bet your wolf would love some red meat right now. Mine would.”
Sherlock blinks once, then jumps off the bed and pads to the door, continuing to growl softly in the back of his throat.
“You’re not going to leave him, are you?” Harry asks. John looks up sharply. “No, of course not, sorry,” she continues. “You’re obsessed with him.”
John lifts his head and blinks owlishly at him.
Sherlock spends a long time upstairs in the bathroom. He must have chosen the bath. John finishes making their dinner and leaves it to simmer on the stove till Sherlock comes down. He wanders back through to the living room. Sherlock’s composition is sitting on the coffee table. He attempts to hum a few notes of it, but his sight reading was always awful and Sherlock’s scribbles and crossings out don’t make the score any clearer. He goes back to his book instead.
“Sensible clothes and shoes,” he says. “Not all fancy suits and expensive leather.”
As quickly and quietly as possible, he strips and changes into wolf form. His wolf is delighted at being let out, having been tense and alert since John found the note. His packmate has been threatened. If these people dare make good on their threat, he’ll rip their throats out. More silently than he’s capable of in human form, John paces forwards to the doorway. He sniffs the air carefully. There
No specialist centre,
John sighs exasperatedly. “The tweezers are in the bathroom, Sherlock. I’m sure you know what to do with them.”
John kisses him, pulls away with a grin. “Alright then, let’s go and get it.” He doesn’t think he’ll ever get over seeing Sherlock’s face shift from subtle surprise to unabashed delight.
more) slickly into Sherlock, who can only grunt at John’s sudden and easy return. “Oh
Strangely enough, that thought calms John, gives him hope, which makes him daring, which makes him honest. He decides on what he knows and what he hopes. He writes down his answers and waits.
“Yeah?” John asks, giving Sherlock a bit of a squeeze and watching him suck in a breath.
It was notice at first sight in that room and on that day
Sherlock groans, tilts his head into John’s touch, and John can’t resist. He darts out his tongue and laps at the dewy sweat where Sherlock’s jaw meets his neck, savours the half-swallowed cry that elicits. He can’t decide whether the salt or sound of Sherlock is more intoxicating.
,” Sherlock breathes.
Blood seeps into sand, onto hands, into bandages, and John bleeds into fever. When the dry heat breaks, John limps back to London – close enough to smell home, but refusing to properly return. Not that he could even if he wanted to – not with his water gone.
When had they pulled over? When had Sherlock gotten out of the car?
because what if the walls are pale blue, what if it’s (not)Christmas, what if there’s sunlight on the bed, scattered by fancy? Sherlock desperately doesn’t want sunlight on the bed, this time.
“You can’t hear a smile,” John says, but it comes out utterly fond and covered in grin and – and kisses, because Sherlock has pushed into his space until he can work his lips sloppily over John’s, exhaustion in each movement. John pulls back. “You should sleep,” he urges gently.
John's face falls slack when he sees it, instantly recognises it, and for a long moment he just stands and looks at it.
“Sherlock, even if I say yes – which I’m not – I don’t see how being on stage and embarrassed will help anything.”
"You should rest," Sherlock says after John’s stopped, worrying at his lip again.
Time for thoughts like these, however, is rare and growing rarer; John seems to hover about more, work less, and doesn’t linger at pubs on the odd night out with Lestrade or Stamford. He doesn’t pull at those pubs either (not that Sherlock can see) and that’s fine, or it would be fine, but for the waiting waiting
there.” He shifts Sherlock so he can look up into his eyes. “With
Sherlock pulls back with a little, hitching gasp. “John –!”
John nods and accepts his glass when Sherlock holds it out to him. Their fingers don’t touch, but they might as well have for the tingle John feels in the skin that came closest to Sherlock.
The waiting is done, now - there’s no more time.
Sherlock’s likely response is easy –
He laughs a breathless laugh into Sherlock’s mouth and chin, and Sherlock lifts away for a moment, looks down into his face. The look of surprised joy in his eyes has John twining his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders and neck, reeling him in for more kisses, angling Sherlock’s neck so he can drag lips and teeth along it, pulling shivers and gasps from Sherlock with each touch.
(on tumblr).
Sherlock nods, baffled, and John inches forward slowly, eyes tracking over Sherlock’s features but never really straying far from his eyes. The kiss is almost chaste, except for the end where Sherlock’s mouth opens a little, and John takes his lower lip between his teeth and gives it a slow tug. Sherlock shivers.
Sherlock peeks out from behind the heavy curtain just as his pursuers run past. Good. His wolf relaxes — he hadn’t realised quite how tense they’d both been. He sits down against the wall and switches his phone off. There’s a gap here in the plasterboard wall where the throwaway phone is stored. He pulls it out. He’s memorised John’s number.
“No need,” Sherlock says. “I have you.”
John smiles. “Good.”
“I needed space to think. Harry helped, actually.”
“Okay,” John replies.
“John, you are a genius.”
The pack pays him no heed. Their leader stands facing John, too close. Clearly looking to start a fight. John is doing everything he can to warn them off, but Sherlock can only feel hostility from them. John takes a warning step forward.
Sherlock closes his eyes, seeing sparks, scrabbles at the tiles behind him. John sucks long and slow, drawing moans from him. His hands stroke over his thighs, slide between his legs to tug gently at his balls. This is what he’d imagined after the cottage shower, but the reality is so much more intense. John’s mouth should be illegal. He already knows how to work Sherlock just so. It’s not long before Sherlock’s hips are thrusting minutely, steadied by John’s hands, and his moans are getting louder. His hands fly to John’s hair and tug.
“Woah there.” John catches hold of him and sets him upright again. “No more arguing. We’re going home.”
John, who caught himself mid-stumble, can only watch as Sherlock prowls towards him, slowly shedding his shirt like the male model in a perfume ad. His mouth fills with saliva. Fuck, Sherlock is gorgeous and he wants to
“See, it’s fine,” he says. “They’ll heal in no time. Especially when we change tomorrow.”
It won’t be. Go build that kennel.
After a moment of lingering, John gets up to clear their dishes. In unspoken agreement, he begins to prepare their breakfast feast as Sherlock banks the fire, turns the lights off, ensures their bedroom door is open. They’re in the front bedroom on the sea side, slightly larger, and with a much better view. Sherlock looks out over the sea, which is mostly a dark smudge, the horizon lit by the twinkling lights of a large cargo ship.
“You’ll have to shower, after,” Sherlock says. “You smell of Mycroft’s pompous stench.”
John slides him his glass. “Somewhere in the world it’s cocktail hour. Or whisky hour.”
“I’m fine. Didn’t fall off a roof.”
“Your world revolves around food.”
“Let’s go out earlier tonight,” John says downstairs, as Sherlock pokes the fire into life. “It’ll be darker sooner. Are you okay with staying out a bit longer?”
In Sherlock’s room, John strips down to his underwear and carefully gets into bed, wincing slightly. Sherlock stands awkwardly in the doorway, feeling like a stranger in his own room, until John motions for him to join him.
Harry opens the door and for a moment John thinks she might punch him.
John intends to go back to his own bed. That’s unacceptable.
But no. He can’t. John doesn’t want it. It was just their instincts running high. Just their wolves. Or just John’s, at least. He knows it was more than that for him.
He waits and waits and waits for John to wake up, and eventually he shifts, with a quiet murmur. Sherlock is instantly fully alert, his hand grabbing onto John’s tighter, leaning forwards in his chair. He says his name.
“Not until the full moon,” John says. He flicks on the torch when they leave the outer limits of the town’s streetlights.
“You’re sleepier than I thought,” John says, and brushes over that sensitive spot again.
“You know Sherlock would escape your centre in less than a day,” John says, opting for a different route. “But me — he’d stay with me, and actually listen to me, and you know it.”
“It’s not even morning,” John says, voice rough.
John replies.
“I know you want to,” Sherlock says, and he finally opens the door between the bathroom and his bedroom, sending John tumbling through. “When you saw how flexible I was you imagined all the different ways you could have me. And trust me, John, if you warm me up enough I’ll be even more flexible than that.”
John turns so that he can see the cuts on his face. Sherlock rests his fingers on his jaw and gently tilts his face towards the light.
“Mm, need… Need to be horizontal,” he murmurs against Sherlock’s lips, hands cupping his cheeks and stroking into his hair.
“You’ve realised,” he says.
Sherlock studies the scratches on John’s neck and decides they’ll only need a little gauze taped over them.
He texts Mycroft with a few details and the partial number plate. Then he continues watching the remaining videos. These men are organised. They wouldn’t have chosen the depot without scouting it out first.
“I’m okay, Sherlock, he missed,” John says. He wishes he could feel as calm as he sounds. Goddammit, he needs to
Sherlock’s composition was confused, slow, depressing, but John took heart from the slightly more hopeful part at the end. He wonders what prompted that bit. Now they’re getting ready to go out. Sherlock is grumbling about the rain.
Their lives brighten up considerably when John Watson enters. Sherlock has always been repulsed and disgusted when kids who don’t see her frightening size or teenagers who think they’re brave enough have touched Nyx, but somehow John seems to understand that she’s more than just a pet and doesn’t stroke her. At first Sherlock is grateful but then increasingly, mysteriously he wants him to. I want him to, too, Nyx says, curled up to Sherlock on their bed. I want him to touch me. It would feel so good. But Sherlock tells her no. No, we can’t. He’s never had anyone like John. He doesn’t want to lose him. John wouldn’t understand.
And he also thinks he’ll enjoy it more if he can be in his wolf form, following his wolf instincts, while John is in his human form.
“Not changing yet,” John interrupts. He pulls on his coat. “Come on.”
It seems no one has told their latest suspect this though.
John comes home angry again, but triumphant. Sherlock doesn’t know what’s happened between him and Mycroft, but he’s bristling with determination. He was gone when Sherlock woke up. Sherlock wanted to go for a run, to calm his wolf, but he’s not stupid — he knows how foolish that would be now.
The better John got the more frustrated Sherlock got at his own inaction. The less he had to worry about John, the more his brain started clawing at itself for something to do, some puzzle to solve. Then Lestrade brought cold case files that had been bugging the Yard for years to the hospital and Sherlock narrowed his eyes suspiciously at John, who just looked innocently happy. Sherlock is sure John had said something to Lestrade when he was out the room.
“John, you— your wolf was, or seemed, angry with me. Or irritated. Frustrated. I don’t know. Was—”
He’s disappointed that Sherlock is taking this badly, but he supposes that he shouldn’t be surprised. He didn’t exactly take his own first change well, but that was an entirely different situation. He takes out the pancake batter and starts methodically making pancakes until he has a large stack of them. Sherlock needs to replenish his energy. He’s hoping to appeal to his sweet tooth.
John’s mouth is a joy. He’s melting, can still feel John inside him, limp now, but closer than they’ve ever been. He sighs softly, a very un-Sherlock noise that John somehow draws out of him, and pulls away from the kiss.
Ugh, repetition. From himself. He takes off his trousers. John is down to his pants. It’s just transport, and normally he wouldn’t care, but now he’s feeling a little self-conscious. What’s different now to any other time?
Finally, some action. He grabs his gun from upstairs and shoves it in the back of his jeans. On the phone, Mycroft guides him out of the flat and along Baker Street.
Harry sighs exaggeratedly, collapsing back against the sofa. “Fine. But you’re here for a couple of days, so rest assured I will find out your story. I’ve got to get to work.”
John remains grim-faced. Time to switch tactics.
, him off the floor and onto a stretcher to carry him to the ambulance.
– but it’s only the light from the streetlights outside his window, and Sherlock can’t stop the sound that chokes its way out of him, half laugh and half something much harder to bear, and then John has him pressed against the bed, is pressed against his lips, and Sherlock lets the sound out again, and he’d call it a keen if he’s being kind.
Music plays, and it’s time to begin.
Sherlock’s come is warm and slick against John, and his breath is in John’s neck and ear, and his hips are still shunting against John’s in the aftermath of his orgasm, and John feels like he’s lit up from the inside out still, but now in addition to that glow there’s a flash and curl of light and heat –
“Billy,” he says over his shoulder, “fetch some tiramisu for our lads.”
He feels Sherlock shift, knows he is getting ready to stand, to leave. “Check on me again?” John asks, forcing his eyes open again, and Sherlock smiles one of his soft, sideways smiles.
Sherlock flinches as John invades his space, but doesn’t lift his hands, obviously anticipating a blow and accepting it, and every part of that cuts into John, that Sherlock should expect violence from him and think it
John feels like he’s inflating even though he’s sighing with relief. After a moment, he allows himself a small, private smile. It feels bold, and it gets him saying: “I like this.” He give’s Sherlock’s forearm a squeeze with his left hand back in place.
“We should get home,” Sherlock says upon stepping out of the office. His expression is shuttered, but John is (now quantifiably) attuned to Sherlock: his set jaw and stiff shoulders belie irritation at least, if not outright anger.
, but because John is suddenly there, John’s tongue and lips are suddenly there, and that makes Sherlock notice the mess he’s made at last.
–” John dissolves into giggling, and Sherlock is laughing in his arms, bare shoulders shaking against his.
“Please, John.” Sherlock’s eyes are large, darkness and depth. They close for a moment. “Please.”
being this. Worried.” He scoffs, but he’s exhausted, so it emerges as more of a hiccupped sigh than an actual sound of derision.
After a moment, biting his own lip isn’t good enough, and John slips a hand up along Sherlock’s neck and jaw, telegraphing his movements, his wants, and Sherlock looks pleased and surprised as he dips down, lets John place a kiss, take a kiss – and then it’s less about exchanging kisses and more about handing the same one back and forth, tongues and teeth coming into play, until John has Sherlock’s lower lip between his teeth, lightly tugging, and Sherlock’s eyes are fluttering shut even as his mouth drops open, shallow breaths tumbling out.
Sherlock clears his throat delicately, otherwise remaining motionless. “John,” he says at length. “Good morning.” It sounds painstakingly normal.
“Come on.” John hitches his hip against Sherlock’s. “Shift over.”
“As for not having any pheromones – I beg to differ.” John lifts and pushes and takes Sherlock’s cock into his mouth in one, steady movement, drinks in his taste, his sounds, relishes the way Sherlock’s fingers seize and tangle in his hair. He pulls back, groans out, “Oh, Sherlock, amazing – want you –” and then surges forward to take him in his mouth again and again.
And the truth is, waking up with an armful of Sherlock is exactly what John never knew (or rather, never acknowledged) he wanted. Pressed close, soft and warm and pliant, Sherlock is bony angles balanced with lean curves. Both his hands have John in their grip – one flung across his stomach, and the other tucked between his shoulder blade and the mattress – and Sherlock sprawls along and across John’s side, his head tucked against John’s neck, chin hooked over his trapezius. His breath comes in slow, barely-there puffs of warmth against John’s pulse point, tickling the edge of his nape, where short hairs move with each exhale.
. You spoke to two different women tonight, perhaps three, and one at least was rather amenable to sharing more than a drink. The blonde, I’d say, judging by the long hair tucked at your collar. So. Why aren’t you there. Why aren’t you at her place. Why are you –” Sherlock swallows the rest of his words as he finally notices John’s face, caught between bemusement at the deduction and a sort of trapped, exposed expression.
, he realises. He feels cherished. “Sherlock,” he says, not knowing if there’s an end to that sentence.
“Oh?”
John grins, pushes forward and up, and gets his mouth on Sherlock’s again, gets his hands up between their chests, and starts to unbutton Sherlock’s white shirt. Sherlock squawks in surprise, into the kiss, into John’s mouth, and John pulls back on a laugh.
“Oh god,” that gorgeous mouth lets slip, and then again, and then, “John, I – I –”
“You,” John breathes, slipping his finger in, just the tip at first. “I was thinking about you, how happy you make me.” He huffs out a breath as Sherlock jerks against him, hard, his body taking John’s finger deeper. “How much you mean to me.” He moves inside Sherlock, stroking, teasing, touching, feeling Sherlock tightening all over, a spring coiling, a rocket barely tethered to the ground. “How much I love you.”
“I wanted….different,” John says, trying to taste the words as he says them, trying to make sure they’re the right ones. This new vulnerability Sherlock seems to be offering – it’s important, and John is loathe to reward it with flippant answers. He considers carefully before adding, “I wanted…new.”
“Afghanistan?” Sherlock asks after an eye roll that erases the pleading from his face as if it hadn’t been there, a brazen bid at manipulation.
Once inside, John sets about packing the food away, and Sherlock produces a wine key from one of the five ‘anything goes’ drawers that were probably originally intended for cutlery or cooking utensils, but are now as much or more likely to contain shoes, baggies of lint, rusted safety pins in varying sizes, or tongue depressors.
“Well now,” Carlton starts, retaking the stage, “it seems we need to really stir up some trouble. Can’t have all this harmony and communication – it makes for terribly dull watching.” He winks as he pauses for a moment. “Are you ready, ladies and gentlemen? Ready for The Question that wrecks homes and relationships and tears whole families apart?” Carlton infuses each syllable with enough drama to shame day-time soaps. The audience holds its breath.
“John –” he breaks off to cry out as John bites into the muscle where his neck and shoulder meet. His back arches and is breath comes in little sips, and then his hands are pulling at John’s clothing. “John, the – the sex question,” Sherlock pants. “I lied. I – I lied. I do – I do – for you – I want –”
John then slid down Sherlock’s trousers, in full doctor mode now, and only looked up when Sherlock made a small noise of surprise.
“It’s just me, John, Sherlock,” Lestrade’s voice greeted them, and Sherlock relaxed a little above him.
His fur was rugged and unkempt, dirty and tangled. The gunshot wound on his left shoulder had no fur covering it, and his fur was longer than Sherlock had previously kept it at.
wanted to know what those teas tasted like. He’d never seen the brand before, but it looked incredibly delicious. John had never seen the point in wasting excessive amount of money in things like food and drink.
Mrs Hudson. The person was silent for a few moments, before he could hear the sound of them quickly retreating.
“Just don’t go in the bedroom. My brain’s still primal and I may attack you guys for invading my territory,” John warned, though he knew it would be in defence of his mate if he did attack.
But, John wasn’t the same as the others, he had a closely-guarded secret that set him apart from the rest; he could turn into a human. John hated it, and he did his best to never transform anywhere near his pack. At least once every two moons, John’s body would betray him and he would turn into his hated human form. It was weak and pathetic, no claws or fangs, his eye sight was terrible and worst of all he had no protective fur. Whenever he felt the change tingling at the base of his tail, he would run as far away from the pack whilst still being in their territory, and wait it out until he was able to turn into his wolf form once more. John also discovered that he could understand the human language. He’d overhead hunters one day, and realised with surprise that the noises they were making was a language that he could understand. It because yet another secret.
When John got home, he went straight for Mrs Hudson’s flat, knocking on the door. She invited him in, and once he was settled with a cup of tea and some biscuits, he inquired after his last gift. To his relief, she did have it. After thanking her, John took his leave back to his and Sherlock’s flat and retreated into the bedroom with the small box and envelope.
An hour later, and he was walking into a lab with Mike Stamford (a bloke that had been nice to him and taken him in for a while after Sherlock had kicked him out) and looking around, making a joke about how it was different from his day – when Mike had shown him around here once or twice even though John hadn’t enjoyed it because it reminded him of Sherlock too much – and then froze in place, head swivelling to find the source the of scent the man that he still loved, even after all this time.
Sherlock pressed a chaste kiss to his lips before sliding down John’s body, gently lifting John’s jumper and shirt before reverently pressing his lips to John’s belly. He wasn’t yet showing, but that would change in another few weeks. John couldn’t wait for that to happen. To have evidence of the pup growing inside of him, formed by himself and Sherlock. Oh, John would love this pup with all of his heart, and care for them with the best of his ability.
Sherlock huffed and slid down John’s arm and gracefully onto the table, his tail relocating to wrap around John’s wrist and make sure he didn’t go far. Amused, John took a seat at the table and watched.
John is watching him. After a spell he asks, “Are you always this quiet after sex?”
more scientific than calling a people that live in the sea a variant of the phrase ‘sea people.’ I rather think
“Sherlock?” he asks, voice more gruff than he’d appreciate at any other moment.
When John’s shirt peels away, he leans in again, presses against Sherlock’s chest with his own, lets his hands slide down Sherlock’s arms to grasp shirt cuffs and just hold them, hold him – Sherlock – still as he kisses him, kisses him, kisses –
“This is where you came ashore, John.”
Sherlock makes a high noise, pants twice, strains to stay loose and relaxed, realizes what he’s doing, and then tries to go limp –
John thinks now of sounds and rhythms coaxed by different means from different instruments, of Sherlock’s mouth upon his now, closing the distance that had lingered that day, stiff and formal as a handshake, of hands taking, grasping, pulling, holding, pushing, a distant memory of thoughts half thought, wants half hidden in moments between waking and sleep.
John wakes to the sound of water on water – rain on the surface of the sea above him – and Sherlock’s voice, the combination of which is rather nice.
“I’m close,” Sherlock breathes, the wonder in his voice somehow detached from the sweat and salt water and slick, the gasping and the churning.
It isn’t until later that evening, when John is having a cup of tea while he reads and Sherlock is sprawled on the sofa, laptop open on his chest, bathing his face in white light, that they speak again. Sherlock hadn’t texted since their morning chat, and John hadn’t wanted to intrude, still feeling a bit uncertain of this new knowledge between them, this new sharing.
"Sherlock?" John would say, his voice lilting up in a question at the end (except this time, maybe it would be an offer).
John cannot stop the smugness from commandeering his mouth: “That’s one way to get you cleaned up, I suppose.” He wipes Sherlock’s arse clean, and drops the cloth over the side of the bed.
secret desires?”
“Just more wine,” John finds himself saying, trying to fill the silence Angelo is grinning into existence. Sherlock’s already at the door, but John knows he can hear the exchange. He picks up their boxes, only to have Angelo take them and sweep to the front with John trailing behind.
“Then yes, just like that.” John lets his hand curl carefully against Sherlock’s waist, tries to read if his touch is welcome or not.
Sherlock trembles, and it seems that slight tremor is enough to dislodge the mask, the distance; they’re breathing the same air again, drinking the same moment.
Sherlock’s eyelids flutter, and his breathing grows harsh. “John –”
Sherlock pinks, colour flagging high on his cheekbones. “I –”
Sherlock shakes his head, and moves back a little – to shrug off his coat and place it high up on a ledge formed by the rocks framing their little grotto, sighing at the now dripping lower hem of it. “Phone?” he asks John, and John shakes his head.
John quirks an eyebrow. “Hopefully I can do better than
“It’s not as if this would be televised. It’s part of a local little theatre’s variety show.”
John’s thumbs tighten where they press, and his jaw clenches, and it seems he disagrees, but all he says is: “I wish I’d met you sooner.”
The groan that pours from Sherlock’s mouth is honeyed sin, and he pools against John, seems to melt and mold to him. So John does it again – and again, keeps right on touching, drenching Sherlock in his touch, running his right hand up the back of his neck to rake down from the roots of his curls, along his spine to his sacrum.
“Oh god, oh god, Sherlock,” John huffs, pushing into him still and still and still, even as Sherlock’s limbs thrash then freeze in the grips of pleasure, “Oh god Sherlock,” John groans, and then he’s coming too, two rough thrusts and then a shivering stillness as he spills and spends himself, hot and slick and inside Sherlock.
Sherlock exhales as John pushes slowly closer, and instead of waiting for John to come to him, lifts up to take the kiss on offer, in exchange for a gasp and a shared moan, because
Then they'd returned home, and John had carried all the bags up the stairs, out of breath from keeping up with a suddenly talkative Sherlock, and Sherlock had disappeared into his room.
Sherlock clears his throat and holds up his card – which is almost completely covered with writing. The space that does not contain words contains a neatly labeled pie chart. John rolls his eyes and covers his mouth, hiding a grin that’s threatening to be more fond than is called for. The card reads:
John laughs and tips him up for a kiss. “
Sherlock makes a strangled sound and pitches forward in John’s grip, seemingly boneless and rigidly tense all at once, incapable of holding himself up even as every muscle tightens in anticipation.
Sherlock’s plate is mostly empty, picked over for the seafood morsels. John’s eaten as much as he wants to tonight.
Sherlock shivers, and John shifts lower, his thumb now swiping over the furl of Sherlock’s anus. The skin there twitches, a clench and release that arrests John’s thumb. He swirls around once, twice – and on the third pass he swaps fingers, lets the slimmer tip of his index finger push against that slicked spot.
“Alright – let’s see…” Carlton is saying. “Sherlock! Who does the lion’s share of the chores at home?”
“Who’ll go first – John? What is Sherlock’s
“God, I thought…” John shakes his head slightly. “I really thought you knew – or noticed – or whatever. On some level.”
The bloom of heat along his tentacle is glorious, a release all its own as water and blood rush to engorge his tentacle where it makes its way steadily deeper into Sherlock, who stiffens with a cry and freezes, rigid with pleasure. “---
And looks up as John pulls him to his feet, into a kiss, those fastidious lips pulling the remnants of ‘please’ from Sherlock’s mouth. It’s irrationally easier to breathe closer to John, his hand gripping Sherlock’s, and Sherlock just indulges in that, the simple act of respiration, made brilliant by specific proximity.
“Budge up,” John says, sitting down next to him. He takes back a towel, kisses Sherlock’s upturned mouth. “Let me.” Sherlock’s eyelids dip for a moment, and his hands clear the way.
“Hmmm,” Sherlock leans into the light touches, cat-like, and John thinks he might finally have dozed off, when he blurts: “Can I name you?”
people know?”
The water’s nearby hushing and the shivering of the stones seems like a bid for lowered voices, though they are alone on the beach. “If this was supposed to be a surprise,” John says when Sherlock doesn’t speak, “then colour me surprised.” He quirks his lips into something like a grin, to let Sherlock know it’s a joke, if a weak one. The grin fades and he says, “If it was meant as…as a gift –?”
John’s balancing on one fist, the other hand holding the lube – he drops to his elbow, lets the lube drop to the sheets to free up a hand to trace his thumb along Sherlock’s jaw. “You’re sure about this – wanting this – with me?”
“John, when has listening to your ‘better judgement’ ever helped – don't answer that. Besides, wouldn’t you say we’ve faced worse than the wrath of fussy tour guides?”
“I get the feeling – oh damn, Sherlock, please breathe you are making me nervous.”
“Round one, let’s warm up with some easy ones, yes?” The glint in Carlton’s eye does not bode well for John’s dearly guarded privacy. “Alright, ladies and gentlemen, question number one:
And Sherlock is crying out to the rhythm of that, his hips stuttering and jerking, and then stiffening as his eyes squeeze shut, his voice a formless cry as heat floods into John, Sherlock’s hips kicking back into motion and pounding into John, urged on by John’s still-spending tentacle, and John -
“Well, you definitely forgot to breathe,” John says bluntly. “Could be a panic attack, albeit minor.”
, on his face, in his voice, in his actions.
Sherlock shivers delicately, and his nipples peak under John’s returning thumbs. “John –”
Sherlock snorts just as he gets his mouth under John’s jaw, which sets John laughing.
John is somehow closer, crouching by the sofa, concern and confusion colouring his face a familiar shade of caring. “Sherlock?” A question, (never an offer). “Why wouldn’t I come back?”
“John?”
They’d been living together so long before John’s Tide came in, and then choosing each other had happened so quickly after Sherlock discovered John’s true nature, and somehow in between knowing each other better than anyone else and choosing to spend the rest of their lives together, they seemed to have missed an important step. But understanding it doesn’t excuse it, and John needs to fix it, now, needs to wash the worry from the downward cast of Sherlock’s eyes, the downward slope of the corners of his mouth.
,” he says, and smiles into the next kiss when Sherlock shivers. “‘s a good look,” he murmurs against Sherlock’s neck.
“True.” The amused uptick on Sherlock's lips evens out into something softer, warmer. There's a look in his eyes that John would have no trouble picturing or identifying on anybody else's face, but on Sherlock's it seems unfamiliar, unexpected, and it's gone before he can quite wrap his brain around it. What replaces it is a decisive look, almost businesslike.
the scars say.
Sherlock blinks open his eye again. “Well, that’s how it is with humans,” he says in his I Know More Science Facts Than You Can Even Conceive Of voice. There’s a bit of a quirk in his mouth, but there’s a different sort of twist in his eyes.
they’d had with dinner. Bits of wrapping paper are strewn about, an almost artful twist of ribbon curled throughout here and there. Less haphazardly placed are the presents now unwrapped – a cashmere scarf and an alpaca wool jumper both carefully folded, books on beekeeping and novel convention stacked neatly, and finally a set off papers, heavy weight document parchments all bound together, in pride of place at the very top.
Sherlock shakes his head. “I….I would prefer not to wait,” he says, and John catches him blushing, and grins up at him. He lets a tentacle curl teasingly around one of Sherlock’s thighs, the tip slowly tracing the line of his inner thigh upwards.
“John Watson, I love you.”
There’s a candle on the table, and a white wine to go with their dinners (
They both drift, resting, but John is too aware of Sherlock’s propensity for losing heat too quickly to let himself doze off the way he’d like. He rolls his head side to side to shake away the beginnings of sleep, is just about to suggest they move into the sun to start drying off when he hears it:
“Clothes,” John pulls away to say, then dives in again, letting his mouth travel where it wants: Sherlock’s lower lip, neck, ear, clavicles, and mouth again. He tastes like high tide, water claiming land, the meeting between the two a pulsing, thrashing dance.
“I – closer, I want you closer, please – I – want you, want you inside –” Sherlock manages, throat tightening with each word until the last is choked out through a stranglehold of nerves, because if John says
John blinks: downstairs the door has opened, and then there is the clatter of Sherlock hurtling up the steps, taking them two or three at a time with his long legs.
John lifts his head as Sherlock goes still beneath him. Sherlock starts to fidget as John just stares, drinking in the raw honesty on his face, trying to deal with the tightness in his throat. He swallows, clears his throat, swallows again. “I wasn’t lying either. About the pool.”
want this?” John asks, slowing his movements a bit. Sherlock’s eyes are dazed as he lifts his head to look up at John, but his mouth seems caught in indecision. “Because I do, Sherlock –”
John’s finger is slick and cool against his perineum, warming as it slides lower, insistent as it begins to press tiny circles against the whorl of Sherlock’s anus, and Sherlock’s done this much to himself, but the absence of efferent copy means every little nuance is new and unexpected, his nervous system struggling to anticipate and failing, falling into reaction after reaction, little cries and twitches, his legs tensing, his hips jerking.
Sherlock shakes his head, mute, pressed close enough that the motion simply presses his cheek and jaw against John’s neck more firmly. John isn’t quite sure what Sherlock’s disagreeing with, so he just presses on:
Carlton starts with the other two couples (outdoor sex, sex in public, dressing up, light bondage) and then saunters over to John and Sherlock’s little booth. “And what of team Watson, eh?” Carlton’s eyebrows jump up and down a few times for effect, and John tries not to look at Sherlock.
“Why did you – say that?”
. “Is everything ok?”
. Sherlock’s mouth is full of words, right now, dangerous ones, and in an effort to keep those from slipping out he shoves out others; and so because deductions are safer than declarations, he says:
“You’re not leaving, then?” Sherlock finds words enough to ask.
“Yeah,” John says, then adds, “hang on, let me –” and shifts his hips, slips his softening cock out of the warmth of Sherlock’s body. Sherlock grunts, but lets his legs fall to the sides, freeing John to lift away.
Sherlock rolls his eyes at his own maudlin thoughts and gets himself back on track.
Sherlock starts to grind against John, slowly, and for a moment John isn’t sure if perhaps his tentacles are pushing Sherlock against him, but then he feels Sherlock tense and twist to bring his hips to bear with greater pressure, and John groans from the pleasure of the touch, from the ecstasy of the thought.
John makes an encouraging sound, pushes closer, takes him deeper, and Sherlock stiffens with a cry before his hips shudder into motion, twitching and pressing forward even as he curls over John, as if he wants to envelop him, as if he can no longer keep up right. John’s skin lights up in sympathy, pleasure ghosting along his flanks, his spine, his legs, and his fingers clutch convulsively at Sherlock’s hips, as if addicted to that touch, that pressure.
“Care to explain?”
With so much focus diverted towards controlling his own thoughts, it takes a moment for Sherlock to hear, to process. Another moment later he squeezes his eyes shut. “You can’t just say that,” Sherlock says softly, fiercely. “You can’t just
"Well," John says, taking the peach and setting it aside, taking Sherlock’s hand and bringing each finger into his mouth one at a time to be suckled clean. "We’ll just have to think of something, won’t we?"
He pulls back. “Sherlock?”
, John decides, letting his thoughts shift along skin. Time enough to worry about what could have been, what almost never was – but later. Right now, Sherlock is here, breathing shallowly above John. He’s resting his weight on one forearm, that hand wrapped around John’s side and ribcage, thumb twitching every now and then, almost absentmindedly, as he watches him.
“Condom?” he asks, and Sherlock shakes his head, not trusting himself to speak. He’s clean, John’s clean, these are known facts. A slightly less rational consideration is that Sherlock wants, desperately, to carry John inside him, and this – this will do. For now. (
“Prat,” John says, feeling just a bit unbalanced by their easy banter and familiar teasing – shouldn’t there be shouting or something?
“They – Carlton and Raymond – it was a publicity stunt. Raymond contacted me to have me look into Carlton, said the biggest tip off would be during the actual stage presence – and – well –”
John can’t help it – he’s blushing even before the question comes to a close. “Oh god,” he mutters, and tucks his hand over his mouth. Of the horrible scenarios John’s imagination had painted, this is by far the worst one, and it’s just been realized.
“Why are you back?” Sherlock asks, and oh god, he actually said that out loud. Apparently he’s not quite out from under the effects of the disorienting nap.
It takes them both a few minutes, but then they both stiffen in realization at the same time.
“Oh,” John says faintly. He takes a deep breath – and then another when he sees Sherlock staring unblinkingly at him as he does so. “Er – no, at least, not where you can see them.”
“Honestly,” Sherlock is saying as John tries to calm himself, “if I don’t empty out the organ drawer every five to six days he gets positively
In answer, John blushes. “It’s – it’s –oh hell, it’s called the Tide. And um, it comes for everyone? Although I didn’t actually think it could happen without home water.” He bites a lip. He hadn’t thought it would happen to him
“There’s nothing wrong with my shirts or their buttons,” Sherlock says, indignant, and John leans forward to inhale against the newly exposed V of Sherlock’s chest.
They end up on their sides, the open box between them, sharing the fork back and forth, polishing off the generous portion of Angelo’s finest. It is the same recipe as always, and it’s also the best it’s ever tasted.
“You –”
It’s three weeks after Sherlock’s discovery (weeks filled with chases and evenings together and Sherlock trying to see if John will avoid eating certain foods – like sushi – or prefers them, as the case may be) that John wakes from dreams of distant, dull roars, of a heaving, roiling sky, of the pull of water and a far-away weight. His back is sore, his muscles are weak, his mattress is damp.
“John?” Sherlock asks softly, and John looks up from where he was staring, colouring slightly at being caught out – but then he sees that Sherlock’s staring too. He looks – careful, maybe, his expression open in a way John’s never seen. They are on their sides, not even an arm length apart, and yet for a moment, that distance seems greater.
With a grunt, John lets his head fall back against his pillow as he tries to understand the how and why of it, mind still a tad foggy from sleep – although, right now an explanation doesn’t seem as necessary as it probably should. The reasons don’t seem as important as the fact that this is actually happening, a reality John is still trying to wrap his head around:
,” and grinds his hips down against John’s.
Sherlock bites his lip, so John takes his hip with his clean hand and wipes his other hand on the edge of the bed sheet. “Let’s try like this.” He guides Sherlock to all fours above him, then pushes until Sherlock’s arse is up against his thighs. “Ready?” he asks, and Sherlock nods.
The man huffs out a laugh. “Please, no need to subdue your voice – even the simplest cretin here knows where the smoke is coming from.” He sniffs. “Although, to my credit, there’s no
“John,” Sherlock gasps, and he meant to say ‘please,’ so it comes out sounding a bit garbled and strange, and John isn’t a figment of his desperate yearning, (not this time), so he stops, confused, and that isn’t what Sherlock wanted at all, but it’s so delightfully real that he closes his eyes and breathes, breathes John and this moment of tangible actuality in.
John takes Sherlock’s hand and just holds it for a moment. “This okay?”
“You don’t have to,” Sherlock says hurriedly, body suddenly tense against John’s once more, and John hesitates before asking:
“ – it was simply an experiment involving the active chemical compounds found in most smoke grenades. Quite manageable and safe – until the end there.” He frowns to himself, eyes darting side to side in thought. “Quite possibly the addition of that last titrand was a bit…ambitious.”
“Ready?” John asks, and he’s maybe bruising Sherlock’s hips at this point with his fingertips, trying to brace himself against the urge to thrust. “Sherlock –”
Sherlock’s hands fumble with his buttons, take too long, and John grips and
“Don’t you dare stop,” Sherlock cuts in, and his eyes are open and blazing and on John.
Sherlock comes with a surprised keen, a soft, almost delicate cry. His come is thin and bitterly metallic tasting, but John’s always liked having his come swallowed, so he does his best to do the same for Sherlock. There isn’t much, anyway, this go around.
“Good. I –”
John just hopes he doesn’t end up having to explain the Mind Palace to an entire audience.
Sherlock groans as John’s first tentacle slips from him, pants as he’s left gaping, says, “
“You were right.”
“So,” John says as the kisses wind down, the moments between them growing longer again.
With a soft, guiding pressure, John brings Sherlock down into a kiss, a touch of lips becoming a firm press, warm and gentle. After a long moment, John’s tongue comes forward for a taste, just a flick against Sherlock’s mouth, which parts, and then John’s tongue is back, licking along that parting, which widens, and then there – the kiss of wet heat from Sherlock’s tongue, a shy copy of John’s movements.
Thank you for reading!
Sherlock grimaces. “How can it be?” he asks bitterly. “There’s so much I can’t do – for you, with you –”
Sherlock’s mouth is a perfect round ‘oh’ for several breaths before he voices it: “Oh.”
"Found it behind your stash of pasta boxes. No sense it letting it go to waste."
His time alone turns as often to thoughts purely of John as it does to experiments and Mind Palace maintenance. Sometimes, Sherlock will catch himself thinking of spending more simple hours together, craving the quiet sounds and soothing rhythms of lives lived in sync – because they are good at this, at orbiting one another, inhabiting the same space, breathing the same air, living the same life. Sharing it.
“Sherlock,” John says, trying to soothe with one hand even as he undoes with the other. “Sherlock,” he breathes against his belly, and his breath wrapped around Sherlock’s name is moist and warm, and then his mouth trails kisses down as he murmurs, “Relax, I need you to –” and then his mouth is hot and wet wrapped around Sherlock’s cock, until he pops off, “–
“Good?” John asks, breathless himself, and he laughs when Sherlock grins up at him, mouth barely able to form the shape around his panting.
“Tiramisu goes with everything, and everything goes with tiramisu. That’s because it isn’t a dessert – it’s a blessing. Here.” He hands Sherlock their boxed leftovers. “You carry these, and John –” he takes the box Billy brings over, and holds it for John to take, “you take care of this. And since it’s a red: wine first, then the tiramisu, yes? Good. Good!” He beams at them, and John manages to squeeze a thank you through Angelo’s exuberant goodbye before he follows Sherlock out. The door shuts on the tail end of a loud ‘Good night!’
He is true to his word, he starts slow, lets that exploratory tentacle sneak lower along Sherlock’s cleft as they kiss and move against one another, until a hot and twitching patch of furled skin arrests his movement. They share a soft exhalation, and then Sherlock moans, because the tip of that tentacle is slick and clever, flicking slowly back and forth, like licking.
And then Sherlock ruins the probable-loveliness of his words and the definite-beauty of his presence by saying: “And by ‘improbable’ I mean ‘not yet scientifically acknowledged.’”
“John, come on!”
. It wasn’t a detail that they’d discussed much – John remembers telling Sherlock to just do as he pleased, still grumbling about being talked into this mess, and, well, he’d assumed –
Sherlock huffs, but does lift himself slowly, away from the refuge of John’s blind-spot. His cheek has a crease where John’s pillow has left its mark. His curls are a tousled mess. His eyes are rather bright, perhaps a bit shinier than usual.
If he were home, safely ensconced in his room at 221B, he’d be having John by now, or John would be having him, and he’d be a mess of desperate, quiet pleasure, but with this new setting Sherlock needs to think through the steps that lead to plausibility, because without plausibility, these thoughts amount to little more than self-torture.
The back of John’s throat is briny and gruff with words he should say, hasn’t properly said – neither of them has – but then, he’d thought perhaps Sherlock didn’t want those words, didn’t need them. Now he’s realizing how wrong he was – and he has to shift some of the blame to this, his neglect, his failure to let Sherlock know, make him understand, just how much this means to John, how much
John licks a stripe up his cock, and Sherlock quivers at the run of sensation it scatters through his body: his nipples peak, his cock twitches, his lower abdominals clench, causing him to tighten around John’s finger – oh god – and that, that, that repeats everything, nipples to cock to rectum to –
And then – well – there’s always the sea, John knows, never too far away in London. If this happened once, maybe it could happen again, a feast of saltwater and Sherlock to tempt John’s other form from dormancy.
His next breath startles him with its rush, and he lifts a hand to finish pushing the pasta boxes aside. They rattle as they topple, but John ignores the clutter and the clatter as his fingers curl around the neck of the bottle.
It develops slowly, develops deeply, and John struggles with it, with this new pull, because it’s impossible and he can’t expect Sherlock to understand or even sympathise. He tries to hide this new facet of himself as best he can, but he knows his behavioural patterns shift, knows it’s only a matter of time before Sherlock notices.
“I’ll – I’ll call Angelo, let him know we’ll be by tonight,” he says, and then he’s gone into his room, door shut, and John is left in the kitchen with nothing to do but notice the effervescence of anticipation; nerves, and excitement all fizzing together in his veins.
John shrugs and grabs his pen, jots down his answer, and then sits back to wait.
falls from his lips, continuous, his cock pumping come into the space between their bellies. John keeps rocking his body into Sherlock’s, doing what he can to draw out the sweetness of release for Sherlock, whose hands grasp and clutch, palms hot against John’s skin, and slick with sweat, their sweat, mixed, blended everywhere they’ve touched, are touching still –
“Would you want to see them again?” Sherlock asks. “We could maybe – or you could – I mean –”
, and John thinks for a moment,
he remembers.
John blinks a tad more purposefully, still fighting the edge of sleep – but no, his armful of Sherlock remains, warm against his side and fast asleep. John opens his mouth to say something, perhaps wake Sherlock, ask for an explanation – but then he closes it a moment later.
“…Yes?”
“And?”
John huffs a laugh at that – he feels exultant, Sherlock above him, touched to incoherency.
It’s incorrect to say John lets the sun take his water – rather, he gives it willingly on a shore near what he learns is a city called London. He goes on to learn a great many things in that city, too, but its name is the first thing he learns on land, and he always holds it close. Later John joins the army, sees the great wide world, and gets shot for his trouble. John nearly dies in the most statistically unlikely place for his kind.
John gapes at Sherlock, because it isn’t a question, and it doesn’t have to be; there’s no question about the veracity of his statements.
“If we hadn’t – if we didn’t –”
“Sherlock –” John breathes. “Can I kiss you, Sherlock?”
In the meantime, he’s just as vaguely aware that Sherlock is lingering by his bed — deciding whether to take the cup? — but then he says: “Anytime, John.”
sound of the waves’ endless churning, the delicate fractal intertwining of scents has John turning his gasp into a long inhale, land-lungs and esophageal gills straining to take in as much air as possible. He tastes the fiddlehead curl of damp sand, the salt-bitter lashing of sunbaked seaweed, the soft opacity of steam as warm rocks shed each wave’s wet caress into the air. Tucked into and under those smells-becoming-tastes resides the cloy of brine, of life and death too small to see, the microscopic decay and proliferation that advance and retreat with the tide, marking out moments and hours and days with new lines carved into the sand.
“Good.” John’s grinning up at the ceiling now, nothing for it. His palm feels electric where it molds to Sherlock’s curve. He can feel Sherlock’s eyelashes bat against his skin again, Sherlock having finally settled back into complete closeness, just like before. John feels several of those little eyelash flickers against his neck before Sherlock eventually speaks:
It’s his turn. His turn to speak. Play the game.
“John?”
John cries out, back arching, burying himself inside Sherlock’s still-trembling body, and comes. His hips stutter back into motion a moment later, and god it’s glorious – silky slick and wet, John’s come inside Sherlock, and outside, too, after a few good thrusts, every movement wetter than the last.
As John watches him, Sherlock looks away and down, his teeth worrying at his lower lip. “Do
"Do you mind?" John asks, standing in a room full of his things, his clothes, the very air permeated by his presence (Sherlock still means to take samples from his and John’s pillowcases, to see for himself how John’s dead skin cells have woven into the fabric, forever claiming that side of the bed - but he keeps forgetting to, because there are other things that take priority in a bed full of John Watson).
“Mhm,” Sherlock replies. They’re on their sides by now, tangled and tucked together. Sherlock has his hands right against John’s chest, only shifting one finger every now and then.
“You –” John swallows the rest, out of habit – then he says it, because he can: “– are
“Sherlock, what are you worried about?” John tries to peer up into Sherlock’s downcast eyes, but again there is silence and Sherlock withholds his gaze. “You think – what? That I’ll up and off into the sea one day? Leave a post it note on the skull? ‘It’s been fun, good bye forever, --John’?”
“I – uh –” John shakes his head, “I’m sure we’ll think of something.”
Sherlock clenches his jaw and seethes,
John has a giddy feeling that, between the two of them, there’ll be no settling for anything less than
Sherlock stiffens above him, his breathing stops, and his arse clenches around John’s fingers, just once, and then Sherlock shakes as he says, “I just – I nearly –”
“John – John, in the –” Sherlock’s hands are everywhere, clutching at John’s sides and hips and arse, leaving heat and longing in their wake.
shirt,” he points out, and Sherlock huffs out a breath, letting his hands rest on John’s biceps. “So I decided to take pity on these buttons,” John teases, and Sherlock smacks his hand away.
,” voice raw with want and an edge of uncertainty – and then John’s second dorsal tentacle surges forward, eager, taking Sherlock in one, insistent push, cool at first then flushing hot and hard, unfurling inside, and Sherlock cries out inarticulate, again and again as John takes him, claims him, fore-tentacles holding him still, holding him up, the sheath spreading him for John once more. “Oh fuck, Sherlock, oh god you’re gorgeous,” John says, cannot but say, as Sherlock’s damp curls shift with each thrust, as his plush mouth parts with his panting, and his eyes flicker with sensation, his skin painted with arousal.
Sherlock, still looking perplexed, gives his head a little shake. “A romantic getaway for two – a ten day Caribbean cruise.”
John wants to say something cheeky about how those two commands technically cancel each other out, but he settles for a quirked grin and raised eyebrows.
He hasn't thought about that day in quite some time. The case, the Woman – events had conspired to keep them busy, keep them running. And then After there'd been no reason to, and plenty of reason not to.
“Angelo always has a table for us,” Sherlock says.
“…Inside,” the man repeats, slowly, as if checking for some misunderstanding.
). For now, they turn and twist and hold and gasp, caught up in the moment, in each other. Wherever they are, wherever they end up, it’ll be as they are now.
Sherlock is – well, he’s just plain gorgeous, really, John thinks, more than a bit smug. Sherlock’s thighs are lean and pale where John’s are sturdier and just a touch more tan; his hair is sparse and dark where John’s is a dark golden brown and much more prevalent. They both have thick thatches of pubic hair, Sherlock’s almost black to John’s dark blond.
, because stating the obvious is a waste of time, time better spent with John. And time
“I – I just –”
“Please reconsider,” they say as John prepares to leave, says heart-felt goodbyes, tearful ones, painful ones, but says them nonetheless, “– it’s a great wide world out there –”
John studies Sherlock above him: his cheekbones are red, the rest of him succumbing to the spreading flush, his skin damp from exertion. His vest is disheveled, the stretched-out collar almost falling off his one shoulder. Little tendrils of his curls are caught against his skin and sweat, and his eyes are dark, frown lines above and between them, doubt writ large.
“Oh god, again, oh –” Sherlock’s elbows nearly cave, and John slips a hand to Sherlock’s chest to stabilize him as he tries to buck back against John’s cock. “I – oh – oh – fuck,
John’s whole face warms as he smiles, and his head tilts a bit, as if a lopsided smile can unbalance it, this moment, everything. He swoops down and kisses Sherlock, and god this shouldn’t still come as a surprise, this kind of contact falls well within expected parameters for sexual interaction, and yet – John’s lips, firm and insistent and slightly chapped and incredibly warm and moist and softer inside, John’s lips come as a surprise with each new touch, with each press and slide and taste. Each kiss is a revelation.
Lestrade is there again, a presence to weigh him down as he has to fill out paperwork and answer stupid questions and then is finally, finally, told where John is. They sit outside the room together, banned from entering, and it takes Sherlock the first half hour to realise he's crying silently, tears dribbling down his face and dropping off onto his coat. He doesn't even wonder when he got so slow. His brain is just John, John, John, on repeat, like a hope, like a prayer.
“Do you have any lube?” John asks.
John wakes him the next morning. It’s half nine already, later than he’d expected. He blames his wolf, who keeps sleeping ridiculously long hours.
“Here, you’re staying out in Cove Cottage, aren’t you?” the pub owner asks him.
“Oh, thank God.”
Not so bad, right? I know you only have my word for it, but accepting your wolf will be so much better than rejecting it, trust me.
“Sherlock has disappeared. It seems he has been kidnapped.”
“I trust there were no issues over the past few days.” His face holds a different conversation with Sherlock. His face says that he knows that Sherlock found it hard. But he hasn’t figured out what’s happened between John and him yet. Sherlock hopes he never will.
“That sounds like my kind of experiment,” John replies vaguely, concentrating more on feeling the play of muscles in Sherlock's abdomen as he rocks against John.
“You can talk, John.”
John is wincing. He can tell.
John has beer, brewed locally. Sherlock, who has never quite understood drinking alcohol for the sake of it, orders a fruit juice. He accepts that hydration is important for the correct functioning of his brain.
John takes him outside and round the back of 221. There’s a tiny yard where they keep the bins with an even tinier lean-to that barely merits the title of shed. This is where they will change, private, unobserved. Together they cram into the minuscule shed and start to strip. Sherlock realises that they haven’t been naked together since the shower. He’s almost sure the air is humming. John, usually unfazed by nakedness, looks awkward and embarrassed, and quickly changes into wolf form. Sherlock follows suit. Again, this time, it’s easier.
He hastily puts his violin and bow back into their case. His arms need to be full of John right now, and it looks as if John agrees. They step into each other. His arms go around John’s shoulders, John’s arm winding around Sherlock’s waist, his other hand reaching up to cup Sherlock’s face gently. His eyes are clear, now, but the emotion is still apparent on his face.
Sherlock glances at the door and growls. Threat. In the flat.
“I’ve lied to you ever since I met you. You said flatmates should know the worst about each other and I didn’t tell you.”
John’s room has a skylight, and he’s left it wide open, per Stargazing. Sherlock shimmies through feet first and drops down.
his packmate.
“I had some mates from here who I visited when we were on leave,” John explains. “I know the area fairly well.”
When they hear the front door downstairs close, John very, very carefully puts his mug down and stands up. His fists are clenched.
“I need to be with you at the full moon. And I need— needed you not to know.”
. He tries to push closer, deeper, but they’re interrupted by the loud, angry hiss of a pan boiling over in the kitchen.
“I’ll let you sleep exactly as long as you need,” John replies.
Sherlock continues brushing his teeth and doesn’t reply.
He reaches out to his wolf. He imagines being a wolf, the way he had been in his dream. So many times he feels the wolf’s mind slip past him, but can’t quite grab it. But he doesn’t like failure. He
“But you don’t even like being in wolf form that much.”
John holds it out for him to sniff. “It’s me, Sherlock. Don’t worry, help is on its way.”
It takes ten minutes for a reply to come through.
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.
She’s right, you know.
Sherlock explains to him, and blames himself, which John frowns at and Sherlock understands that’s his way of telling him off without having to use words. Already he feels less like he’s about to float away. Some balance has been restored.
He feels John shiver against him. “You’re sure?”
He sets out at a jog, not paying much attention to the direction he chooses. He lets the wolf set the pace.
“Come on, Sherlock. Time to eat.”
. For a second he’s hit with the shock of that, of how it’s finally happening, what he thought would never happen. Shock so strong it feels like a physical blow.
John groans, eyes dropping shut. He opens them again a moment later with renewed purpose.
“Heightened senses?” he asks John.
John glances at his watch. “About quarter of an hour ago. Get dressed and we can leave straight away.”
John smiles and slides into bed. He opens his arms. “Come here then, little bee.”
“No, just painful. It’s manageable.”
“You’re going to have to sit up just a little bit,” he says, returning. “Here, I’ll help.”
While Sherlock was lost in thought, John had ordered them both food.
He’s so sure of himself, thinks he’s hilarious. It’s disgusting. Picking up the bag, Sherlock stands, knees damp and protesting after being uncomfortably folded for so long. He says nothing.
“I’m going to bed,” he says. “Feel free to burn that folder.”
Walking into the empty flat feels wrong. Sherlock should be here, making a racket, or concocting unpleasant smells in the kitchen, or barging into John’s room to cuddle him without an explanation.
John has the decency to look mildly ashamed. He shifts from foot to foot, looking at the wall, the ceiling, out of the window.
Stop. John’s anger is practically rolling off him. Sherlock briefly (nonsensically) panics — what has he done now? — but then he smells the eau de pompous git that’s still clinging to John.
“Of course I was.” John starts pacing. “We need to do something about your brother. He’s persistent. If he’s tried this once he’ll try it again. We can’t have you going to that place.”
“Oh, have you?”
“Fine, fine, I’ll lie down.”
“Are you going to be sick again?”
John notices his expression. “Just wait,” he says.
Sherlock frowns, but tips his head to look up at the night sky. There stars are beautiful, so much clearer than in London. There are a few thin clouds streaked here and there across the sky, but no moon.
Until John turns around in the doorway he thought he had only said his name in his head. Apparently not. He has to push on with this then.
Sherlock looks down blankly at his food. He picks up his toast and just stares at it. Then suddenly he drops it and bolts upstairs.
When he wakes, the room has darkened slightly. It’s already late afternoon, and the sun is just beginning to set. Sherlock is looking at him.
No, he won’t say anything. Not yet. He needs to get a better read on how John feels about the situation. He gathers his violin and his music and goes back upstairs to finish packing. Breakfast is awkward. John has made tea for him, so all is not lost, but the silence is strained. Thankfully it’s eventually interrupted by the arrival of the cottage’s owner.
“Mycroft should be here soon,” he says. “I know you don’t like him, but that’s the least of your worries. You’ve got a lot ahead to get through.”
Sherlock blinks open sleepy eyes as John sets about drying him, trying not to linger over the obvious erogenous zones.
,” Sherlock complains, but there’s laughter in his voice and his mouth, and then they’re pushing closer, Sherlock’s long legs sliding against John’s, fingers lacing together – and then Sherlock flips them, and John’s looking up at Sherlock’s heaving chest and parted lips, his face framed by wild curls.
“Sherlock, get up here –” John gets his wish in the form of a firm press of a kiss. Sherlock is a lithe, warm, shifting weight on top of him, every breath shifting his skin against John’s, his hands clutching and grabbing at John’s waist and rib cage. Their legs slide together, apart, in between, and it’s not rutting, exactly, just a sort of lovely friction as their hips cant towards each other.
“For you, you mean,” John quips, and turns around.
“Ok, but I need you to
“Of course I do!” Sherlock looks affronted. “The suspension of tannins in temperature variant liquid can be an extremely useful substance for marking the passage of time. Rates of evaporation and staining can all help pinpoint an accurate time of de–”
.” He finally seems to notice Carlton’s look and John’s silent laughter. His eyes narrow. “Don’t you,
John snorts. “Sod that. Come on, then. I’ll make us a cuppa – I sure as hell could use one, and so could you, I’m thinking. Also, since you’ve called off the fire response, someone needs to check your lungs.”
They both fall silent and listen to the distant chorus again, something in it akin to whale song, but also wind and also the echoes of underwater ravines. John realises Sherlock is watching him after a moment.

“Probably,” Sherlock says, and it’s almost a whisper. “Yes.”
Mouth dry, John makes do with a few sips from the tap, pulling a face at the subpar flavour (Sherlock’s arousal tasted
Again, Sherlock seems to steel himself before nodding. His curls shift with the abrupt movement.
“Huh?”
“I think not,” Sherlock says, and his eyes positively twinkle.
The man’s eyes narrow even as his shoulders hunch forward – almost protectively, it would seem. “A dazzling observation, simply astounding it should occur to you so quickly.” This time a sneer pulls at those lips. “Besides, I’m hardly the only one underdressed.”
“Yes, I guess,” John reluctantly agreed.
Sherlock asked, his grip loosening around John’s throat but not fully letting go.
Sherlock looked up and caught John’s gaze then, and Sherlock’s eyes were filled with such love and wonder, that John couldn’t help the way that his face heated up and tears pricked his eyes. John wasn’t the most emotional of Omegas, but he knew that Sherlock wouldn’t think any less of him for this act of weakness. Anyone in his position would tear up at least a little. To have such a wonderful, loving Alpha, John was lucky. He knew Sherlock would spoil both him and their pup, and would love both of them forever.
Flopping back onto the bed, John breathed deeply, covering his eyes with his forearm and his breath came out as a whine. He hated these nightmares. He hated that Sherlock wasn’t here to soothe him with kind words and gentle pets as he used to do when John had had nightmares as a pup.
Sherlock huffs beside him. “At last you admit it.”
“A solution for boredom,” Sherlock murmurs. He doesn’t explain that it was long ago, because he knows the scars do that for him.
Devotion runs deeper than hide and mane
After a few steps, they both stop to roll up their trouser legs, the surf splashing and swirling about their bare ankles with gusto.
“Alright then.” John looks down at the glass he’s holding. “Is that enough time, do you think?”
He says: “You are perplexing.”
The man accepts with something like a smile, glances down at the keyboard, then up again at John, and asks, “Afghanistan or Iraq?” His fingers dance and tap against the keys even without his needing to look down. John would be jealous if he weren’t busy being flummoxed.
“Only if you drive according to road regulations – I don’t fancy the idea of getting stopped for speeding while I have my kit out.”
"Didn’t mean to wake you," Sherlock murmurs. His hand stays against John’s forehead.
Sherlock huffs a solitary laugh, and John doesn’t point out that it doesn’t quite sound like a laugh. It’s a bit too damp, but John’s throat’s a bit achy right now, so the less said the better.
Not when brushing fingers at first grasp as phone and heart
After a minute, John leads the way to Sherlock’s bedroom, and Sherlock’s mind stutters though the logistics of that selection:
