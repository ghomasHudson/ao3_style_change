“Loki used to have many a nightmare when he was younger.”  Thor explained.  “This always managed to soothe him.”
“You’re so good at this,” T’challa praised. “Look so beautiful with your lips stretched around my cock.”
“Why are we awake again?”  Bruce sat up, disentangling himself from Thor and Natasha, rubbing his eyes.
Prompt: After Wakanda is introduced to the world Tony pays them a visit. Shuri leaves him alone for a second to check on something and M’Baku swoops in to flirt. (From @Lupinthealchemist on Tumblr)
“Tony.” Steve said softly, trailing his fingers over Tony’s shoulder, “Baby, honey, sweetheart, why didn’t you tell us? Is that why you always downplay your injuries? Because you really think they’re not as bad as they are?”
Natasha started walking towards the doorway. “I’m going to bring him back,” she announced. “That was unacceptable.”
“Has it ever occurred to you that the thing he likes doing most is making others happy?” Jim interrupted.
“O-okay,” Tony said, at a complete loss. He rubbed at his wrists where there was strangely no rope burn. This had literally never happened before. “Uhh can I get your name, big guy?” The men in the background snickered.
Yet both of them got down on their knees and tried to reason with Dum-E the next time they were asked to cat-sit, to no avail. When Tony got home they attempted to invite him over to their place … but Dum-E started meowing loudly from the room over and Tony rushed off with a, “sorry! My baby missed me. Raincheck, okay?”
“We are not savages!” M’baku roared. “We have our own justice system that does not include mercenary work.You have done nothing wrong in any case. And as I told you, we have no need for money.”
“Easy,” Clint snorted. “Bruce only gets tea and Thor only gets poptarts. They were already in the cart. Cap and Natasha always get everything else.”
“I suppose I’ll be having a word with him,” Tony said mildly. Or not. Was this even a kidnapping? He’d only even stayed tied up for like two seconds. (lame)
Tony called the suit and took off to the coordinates that Jarvis so helpfully provided him with. (He might have dozed off on the way a little, sue him. Jarvis was an excellent co-pilot)
“Right, right,” Tony muttered. “So no offense, why aren’t you killing me? Also, how’d you even get me?”
Wrapping it around himself, Tony glared at them. “I’m not taking the bottom half off. I’m pretty sure my underwear is wet and as much as I’m sure all of you would enjoy it, I’m not stripping in front of you.”
But Tony’s eyes had lit up at the nickname. “You can call me whatever you’d like,” he winked, “sugar.”
Well, everyone except for Tony.  He could feel sleep pulling at him, and sure, maybe he hadn’t actually gotten any rest in several days but he couldn’t fall asleep.  He just couldn’t.
It was after a battle with yet another alien race when Steve and Bucky found out the truth. They’d been with Tony for a while now, and they thought they knew all there was to know about him. He was allergic to seafood, loved cuddling, hated things being handed to him by people he didn’t trust, and he was all around kind of a reckless fool who refused to look after his health properly, but would let Steve and Bucky (and sometimes even the other avengers) do it for him.
Lube in Wakanda was unlike lube from anywhere else, Tony found. It smelled good, felt good, and was okay with condoms. Plus somehow it was naturally warm?? It was heavenly and it didn’t dry up fast like most lubes. Also, it was a moisturizer!
Tony shrugged his T-shirt off, very self conscious of the arc-reactor and the scars surrounding it. Clint handed him the shock blanket that was most often used by Bruce post-battle.
“Alright, lemme take a look.”  Tony inspected Bucky’s arm with an intensity and gentleness that made his stomach swoop. “Nothing looks wrong, but if you say it’s sticking then I believe you. Could be the weather. I’ll oil it up for you, and that should take care of the problem.”
M’baku smiled a mischievous large smile that set Tony’s heart fluttering a little. “King T’challa let us take you.”
Shuri led him through the labs, explaining everything they passed to him. It was quite frankly, insanely fascinating. Impressive, too! She was barely 17.
Apparently he’d wanted company, because instead of going to his room to sleep, Bruce found Tony curled up on the living room couch on his way to cook dinner.
Tony stepped carefully back from the tech and wandered around in circles, peering closely but never touching. He had to be respectful, after all.
“Oh, hey fellas! Lady.” A very clearly sleep-deprived Tony suddenly appeared, giving a nod to Natasha, Clint (who had won Tony’s attention for the time being) in tow.
When Tony pulled his shirt off tonight, instead of the usual admiring glances he got, he was met with twin looks of horror.
Tony set his cup down on the counter and attempted to get it for her. “I can’t reach it,” He mumbled petulantly. They all went ‘AWWW’ on the inside.
Behind him, Tony could see Thor and Clint exiting the quinjet and coming over, Clint looking back apprehensively.
they liked to do. There was so much discord over what to do for their weekly activity that they made up a rotation schedule so everyone got a say.
Natasha was into spa days (nights) with everything. Manis, pedis, facial, full body massage, the whole shebang. She liked to relax, since she’d never been allowed that luxury as a child.
With all of them living together, fucking, and dating, they began to loosen up. Walk around in sweatpants, shirtless, not care as much about looking poised and put together.
“I think I’d know if I were in a relationship with the Avengers,” Tony chortled. “Just ignore me, I need a nap.”
The obvious pick of who’d take the longest to let their guard down was Natasha, but it wasn’t. It was Tony. He’d taken the longest to convince about joining them, sure that he wasn’t really wanted. And then even once he’d gone on a few reluctant dates with one or two individuals at a time, he still seemed a bit stiff. None of them had managed to coax him into letting his metaphorical hair down yet, much to their disappointment.
“Yeah,” Tony rasped. “Yeah, I’m fine.” He moaned. “God, that feels so good.” M’baku was up to two fingers.
“So you are Tony stark. The man Obadiah Stane wanted me to kill,” Gorilla guy said, stroking his unfairly symmetrical chin. Gorilla guy was a good nickname, right? Because the guy was sure built like one. Then his words registered.
They tried to get their arms around him on the couch, but Dum-E climbed onto Tony’s lap meowing loudly, demanding all his attention. Then he purred right into Steve and Bucky’s glaring faces, looking quite pleased with himself.
Steve shook his head and dug his fingers a little more firmly into one of the geniuses many tension knots. He felt immense satisfaction as it dissipated and Tony melted a little bit beneath him. “I like giving massages,” he told Tony. “Feel free to come by for one any time.”
The ride back to the tower was insurmountably better than the ride there. The tension that always came before a battle wasn’t present, although many of them were stiff with anger over what Fury had done.
Prompt: Tony, Bucky and Steve arguing who gets to sit in the middle for movie night. (requested by @peteryoulittleshit from tumblr)
Clint gripped the front of Tony’s shirt and made a desperate little noise. Gosh dangit, Tony found it cute. He was screwed.
Without warning, the Iron Man suit shut off completely, and Tony started to fall. “Cap? I’m being knocked out of the sky!"
“Of course!” Tony said generously. They left her with all the signatures she could want, and a $500 tip for putting up with them. They waved away her stammered protests and thanks. She deserved it.
“When Pepper broke up with you we didn’t see you for a week,” Bruce told him. “We barely see you at all
There was no response. Tony realized that of course, if the suit wasn’t functioning, neither was his communications.  He could do nothing except watch the ground rush up to him.
The night itself had been fun. Snacking on food they had found in the storage room, they played not only never have I ever, but also truth or dare (mostly just truth, since nobody wanted to get up) and exchanged a lot of childhood stories.
Thor varied, but it was always something Darcy had told him to try because, “it’s a human tradition!”
“And movie nights!” Thor said enthusiastically.  Out of everything in the future, of course movies had been one of the things that he was most impressed with.
“Nat’s right.” Bruce squinted at him. “And your clothes are wet. Why are they wet? You were outside like that, even if it was just for a minute.”
Everyone watched with bated breath as Tony rose from his cross-legged position on the floor, walked the few feet across the circle, and plopped down into his captain’s lap.
Clint rolled his eyes. “And how many of those smoothies have motor oil in them?” He asked. Clint started walking. “Come on, we need to find Cap and Natasha.”
“And you didn’t think you should include me in that conversation?” Tony asked. “I mean, I get it. I’m not really part of the team, I just make you guys things and let you live here for free.”
Tony rolled his eyes fondly, and began unbuttoning his shirt while his boyfriends looked on, practically salivating. He didn’t even do anything particularly sexy, but they were enthralled nonetheless.
It was real. This was really happening. Steve settled on the couch in between his two new loves, and they immediately draped themselves over him.
“Strap in,” Steve advised, “We don’t know if the door will hold and we don’t want anyone flying out.”
“But later,” M’baku said. He ran his fingers through Tony’s hair. “For now, rest. You must be exhausted.”
He wasn’t sure when the actual day had started exactly, because it’d been a while since he’d last slept, but at some point everything had gone to shit.
Fresh air felt good. The sun was setting and a bird was singing its heart out somewhere. Probably a mating song, Steve thought. He called Thor who laughed over how sappy Steve sounded, and afterward, he just sat on the back porch and breathed.
“You’re mine now, Steve,” he said, trying to sound ominous, pulling on the chains and playing with the button on the remote. “You’re mine,” he whispered, leaving the vibrator on the random pattern setting.
He trailed his index finger down to one nipple, flicked it, and at Steve’s whimper, repeated it with the other.
Bolder now, Tony put both palms on Steve’s shoulders and caressing his silky skin, trailed his palms up to his elbows, then down on his chest and the nice pink nubs on his beautiful wide, strong tits. He played with Steve’s nipples and by the way the boy’s breath stuttered, he surmised that maybe he wouldn’t need another dose of aphrodisiac after all. Maybe Steve was actually into it.
Taking a calming breath, Tony went on, “And this bad boy here…” Tony let the flat tip of his riding crop trail the length of Steve’s cock cage and then tapped it lightly, startling Steve into a jolt and a whimper. “This bad boy here... will remain sheathed until I say otherwise.”
"No, listen," Stark said, shifting in his seat. Steve could feel his stare on the side of his head. "I can get the money. I have a plan."
Tony knew the calm wouldn’t last. Tomorrow was going to be a fight, a struggle and he’d have to use all cunning and some brute force to make Steve submit.
“Okay," Tony replied. "Okay, so when does your buddy expect us? Are you sure we don’t have time for a quickie?”
“You’re… you are serious?” Stark blinked. “You’re serious. Your name really is Steve Rogers? Like America’s Ass? Or are you… Oh my god, you
Zip ties. Duck tape. Remove personal items: phone (put on silent for now), a pack of tissues, car-, no, bike keys, a pocket knife, and a wallet.
He lifted one clover to show Steve and swiftly, clamped it over one nipple. “But it’s a set with an oomph!” Tony added as he fixed the other one.
“I don’t think so. Obie’s personal security and SI general security are separate entities. And if the guy in duty is new, I’ll simply charm my way in.”
Still no reaction. But it was the wrong kind of silence — not the mulish, stubborn one where a teen was being brought before his dad for being a brat; rather, it seemed… But no. It was none of Steve’s business. His business was getting Tony Stark and transporting him where he belonged; to the people who cared about him and would take care of him. So silently, Steve drove on.
“Just leave your bike here, my guy’s gonna fix it in no time,” Gary, the owner, said. “Got golden hands, he has.”
“No, listen, I’m not joking here.” Steve’s teeth were clenched in annoyance. “I’ve got an army buddy who can marry any vet at any time and place. You’re of age, so no guardian consent needed. I can give him a call now and he'll have filed our documents before sunrise! No, I’m serious, stop laughing, Tony, listen! You’re unlike anyone I’ve ever met and I—”
„That is actually a really boring story that I am going to tell later. Right now I need to find out if aunt May is alright.“
As soon as they had brought some distance between them and the facility the teleporter from the Avengers registered them and brought them home. Steve could have cried out of happiness of being back.
„Stop this bullshit!“ he yelled and moved to punch his own face but the Skrull blocked it and attacked as well.
“Start with him” he ordered and the two soldiers gripped the ensign.  Immediately hell broke loose. The ensign tried and failed to fight of the two stronger aliens while the rest of them screamed at them to stop without success. One of the soldiers ripped of Fassamau’s red shirt and strapped the ensign to the chair while the scientist connected him with the monitors.
“I need to speak to everyone” Steve said and opened the line: “Here speaks the Captain. You are all aware that a few hours ago an AIM centaur-class ship started an attack on the Avenger. A galaxy-class ship like ours is not made to withhold such an attack so our only chance was escape. The leap that brought us to safety also happened to brought us through a wormhole. I am sorry to inform you that we are currently in the Al-Alguhla-Galaxy thousands of lights years away from earth. It will probably take as a decade to get home. I am really sorry.”
T’challa scowled. “Well I came here to find your home deserted, and a white man in your bed. Of course I was worried.”
Natasha scowled. “Screw the right thing, he’s put on like 12 disney movies at this point. I owe him. I hate owing people.”
No. Let’s not be vague, they were staring at Tony. To be even more specific, they were staring at his complete and utter obliviousness.
Thor kissed the top of Tony’s head, and then genius was yanked out of his grasp by Natasha, who pressed her own kiss to Tony’s cheek.
And if he woke up gasping, sure that he was dying, someone was there to calm him down and help him get back to sleep.
“No argument here.” Tony grinned, “We still need to educate the old man and the alien on modern life.”
“Stane heard we were savages,” M’baku said distastefully. “He offered us what I assume is a large sum of money to capture and kill you.”
“Well yeah, I thought you were just going to use me to carry your extra stuff,” Tony admitted, brandishing his basket. “Why don’t you all just take carts?”
Needless to say, they were all surprised when he stumbled into the kitchen on the main floor in a tank top and shorts right as they were all having breakfast.
Bucky crept into the workshop warily. He could hear Tony’s voice but when he peered in, the inventor was the only one there. Was he talking to himself?
“Yeah,” Clint said. He licked his lips, and Tony flashed back to how he’d done it this morning, suggestively. Now it seemed more … shy? “But I’m like, really glad Tony. Because you know, I really like you.”
Based off of this prompt: The Avengers have an activity night every week for team bonding. Each week a different person gets to pick the activity. Everything is great until they notice that whatever Tony picks is always something another team member likes to do (spa night for Natasha, football for Steve, paintball for Clint, etc.). When confronted, Tony claims that he just doesn’t have a favorite hobby, but in reality, it’s because he wants them to like him. The Avengers set out on a quest to find Tony’s favorite activity.

Tony stopped mid-sentence, straightened up and beamed at him. “Buckaroo!” He turned to Dum-E. “Ladies and gents, we’ve got a special guest star today!”
“You hate outsiders,” T’challa said, entirely unable to understand. “Just yesterday you were criticising me for opening Wakanda to the world again.”
“I swear, if this is some dream hallucination, I’ll kill all of you,” Tony babbled, between kisses from his boyfriends and girlfriend.
“No,” Jim told him. “But if you ask him, that’s what he’ll say. He’s been conditioned to give people things or else they’ll leave. He thinks that the thing he wants most is selfish, so he’ll never specifically request it.”
“It was you,” Tony said, before Steve could respond. “And how you’re stubborn, and reckless, and brave.”
“I call not calling him,” Clint said immediately. “The man is terrifying. He told me if I ever made Tony cry he’d make sure I never shoot an arrow again.”
Then Tony. They’d gotten off to a rocky start. Then it had developed into … Steve had thought it was flirting. It almost seemed like they were about to start an amazing natural relationship.
“Noice!” Clint hooted. He and Tony high fived. “Okay I can see Bruce and Thor already stopped by, so I’m going to drag this genius around to get the true shopping experience. Feel free to leave without us.”
“You’d better,” Tony croaked. He was pretty sure than anyone he encountered in this state would know exactly how he ended up like this.
Tony somehow managed to hack into their guns in the first round, making him the automatic winner when they weren’t able to shoot him at all.
Prompt: How about a shifter au with panther!T'Challa and silver back gorilla!M'Baku being all fierce and powerful and trying to figure out what Tony is. (From @ Shi-Toyu on tumblr)
By the time Steve and Clint came up from training, Tony had somehow managed to kick the blanket off.
Just as they were passing a black panther suit prototype, one of Shuri’s Kimoyo beads pinged with an incoming message.
After they both got free samples of chips and guac and were continuing to walk the store, Clint stopped quite suddenly in front of the fruit. “Need any smoothie ingredients?” He asked, doing a 180 to look at Tony. Their faces were uncomfortably close.
Bucky decided that the rest of the team were just idiots, and they hadn’t been straightforward enough. So he just kissed Tony after the mechanic had finished working on his arm.
They all loved it. Sometimes the team was treated to the sight of sleep-deprived Tony shuffling around random places. Tony was always sweet and pliant when half asleep. He’d let any one of them manhandle him into the nearest bed, or into the kitchen for some food if Jarvis informed them it had been too long since Tony’d last eaten.
Based off of this prompt: You always see Steve and Bucky adding Tony or Steve and Tony adding Bucky to the relationship, but you rarely see Bucky and Tony adding Steve after the fact. What about something where either Steve didn't realize his feelings until Tony and Bucky were together, or wasn't ready to say anything until after they'd gotten together?? (Tumblr user dayzor)
“It’s actually a better idea for us to share blankets and cuddle. It’ll conserve body heat.” Bruce told him causually.
Tony grinned at her.  “Definitely.  Come on, all. For our first team dinner, we’re getting takeout, unless any of you can cook.”
“We won’t peek, promise.” Clint said, wiggling his eyebrows in a way that implied he’d definitely be peeking. Nat elbowed him.
“Hey, Brucie.” Clint looked over at the scientist. “Is it just me or was Tony wearing very non lab-safe clothing?”
“Steve and Bucky get the final say.” Tony shrugged. “They probably don’t even know what we’re talking about.”
“You think we want to take you out … shopping?” Bucky asked. There was only one thing to be done. He pulled Tony in for a mind-numbing kiss. It was only slightly ruined by the cat screeching in the background. “We wanna take you out on a
One of Tony’s eyebrows raised and he looked confused for less than a split second before bursting into guffaws. “Ha! No. I’ve got a live audience here. Via Instagram streaming. Say hi!”
“He used to hold the phone the other way, but I like reading the comments,” Tony explained. “So. What’d you come down here for?”
“Only Bruce.” Steve agreed, draping an arm around his injured boyfriend. “Does he know about the pain caused by the reactor?”
Prompt: M'Baku at some political meeting with T'Challa and Tony too. M'Baku is standoffish at first, he doesn't like the outsiders much, or the use of vibranium in everything, but warms up somewhat when he realizes how much Tony built without vibranium. (Tony may be as curious and invested in Jabari culture and weapons as he is in shuri's research?) (From @wrenchirps on tumblr)
Prompt: Bucky comes down to the lab to make Tony eat something but then freaks out because Tony has actual robots! (requested by anonymous on Tumblr)
“Sure.” Tony was trying and failing to look nonchalant. “Cap is super comfy. You should all try him out.”
Prompt: Tony and Bucky trapped under a building collapse and Tony doesn't have his suit! Possibly with head wound?
He was dodging the question. Oh Bast, he’d been seeing Stark since before the whole thing with Killmonger. This was insane. T’challa’s brain could not compute.
“Hey!” He protested, slapping their hands away. “If you’re so turned on by me doing things efficiently then maybe you should let me take my own clothes off.”
He’d gotten over that eventually, though. Now all his terror centered around flying into the portal alone, sure he was going to die, Afganistan, and the team abandoning him.
“ … Human contact,” Bruce admitted. “Even on a scientific level, touch is proven to decrease depression, trigger endorphins and oxytocin. You can literally go insane without it.”
If he didn’t fix this they were all dead. Colonel Rhodes would come for them. And worse, Tony would stay devastated.
“Oh.” His entire middle body was mottled with scary looking dark purple bruises. “Huh. I didn’t even notice.”
Clint walked next to him chatting eagerly. “Jeez Tony, this is awesome. We get to pop your store cherry!”
“This man.” A picture was thrust in front of his face and yup, that was definitely him. His captor took in his expression. “You are surprised.”
Tony shivered and melted a little before recovering his glare. “No! Added to our rules: If I can’t hack into shit, none of us can use out power of seduction. Old fashioned laser tagging only.”
“The ones I refused to build,” Tony said bitterly. “I’m trying to turn my company in a new direction. Technology for clean energy. Guess he hated that more than I thought.” His arms were starting to ache from being tied behind him. “Look, he probably paid you a lot of money to kill me but I can double whatever it is.”
“Okay good,” M’baku said. “Then I shall see you at 7:00.” And with that he turned and swaggered off.
They all tried engaging Tony more outside of team bonding nights as well. Thor had the great idea to institute a mandatory communal dinner on Saturdays because, “Lady Darcy told me this is how families eat, and we are a family, are we not?” He used his puppy dog eyes on Tony when he tried to protest. No one could resist that.
Young Tony with best friend Rhodey who is secretly a wakandan spy. Rhodey brings over "friends" of him: M'Baku (and maybe T'Challa too?) (actually because Tony is brilliant and awesome and he wants them to meet him). If you want, it could have M'Baku being a bit confused by american customs? (requested by @wrenchirps on tumblr)
“I have an extra pair of pants.” Bruce said, “courtesy of the Hulk. Please keep the underpants on though.”
Prompt: Sequel to the last fic, small Tony sleep deprived. Too small to reach things. Curled up in a tiny ball on the sofa, covered in a blanket. (requested by ao3 users Kan and Elyador)
“Just great” he yelled and left the bridge, if he could have slammed the door, Steve was sure he would have.
“Fuck, then he found a way to override his programming. I am on my way” Tony cursed and Steve could hear him run.
“Romanov is right. We have bigger problems than Starks skin care. We need to find a class M planet to refill our resources, find out where we are and contact Shield to inform them of the AIM ships in our territory. Rhodes, Danvers fly ahead until we locate a planet but don’t waste any fuel, slide sometimes if necessary” Steve ordered and then pressed another button on his chair: “Doctor Strange, how is it looking at the med bay?”
“Are that…” he begun and Tony ended his sentence for him: “The stars you’d see from Manhattan at this time of the year. Without the light pollution of course. The closest we can get home right now.”
„It has to look like we lost a fight. Come one man. I can take it“ Harley tried to reassure Peter but the other boy still wasn‘t used to his new found power and feared he would hurt his friend.
“A team found Ultron, no survivors!” she said and ended the call. Steve started at the device in his hand and cursed. Tony looked up, worry obvious in his eyes.
„Which one is the real Peter?“ Harley cursed and again both Peter‘s spoke simultaneous: „I am the real one!“
“This is more about what I can do for you, Captain. Come, I got something for you!” Tony said and griped Steve’s hand to pull him out in the hall.
“We need some light if we want to find a way out of here” he whispered tensed and immediately one of the ceiling lamps turned on dimed.
The orange glow was slowly crawling towards the center of Tony’s chest and Steve dreaded to find out what it would do to the only thing that kept Tony’s heart beating. A small vine slowly turning orange crawled closer towards the reactor, disappeared under the scar tissue and then, in one go, turned the reactor’s blue light orange.
“I’m good, we have bigger problems right now. But later you could help me relax” Tony mumbled with a promising smile.
“ Yeah, but I just remembered that there is an older version of him isolated on the holodeck. He is still a child, running simple simulations and has to learn a lot but Ultron couldn’t access him from the lab, most likely isn’t even aware of his existence. With Jarvis help I can restart the ship and protect it from Ultrons hack attacks. That’s why Ultron killed him in the first place, because Jarvis could stop him” the mechanic explained exited.
“Yeah, yeah. I’m fantastic” the brunet answered tiered and Steve had the urge to pull the shorter man closer but not in front of the crew.
„Jarvis, can you show us the footage from the bridge starting two hours ago“ Peter asked the AI who compiled and soon they saw Captain Rogers sitting in his chair. Everything seemed to be normal.
The only people who didn’t gave Tony the fault for the crazy robot were his closest friends but the mechanic but Tony blocked everyone out who wasn’t Pepper, Rhodes, and Bruce and didn’t that hurt. He thought what they had was special, that Tony trusted him but that broke when Steve had yelled at him and looked him away. Degrading had been protocol, the rest was on Steve and how could Tony trust Steve when Steve obviously didn’t trust Tony.
“We don’t need Conan as a Bodyguard” Tony tried to intervene but a look from Steve made him shut up.
When the bigger group left Peter and Harley stayed behind. Mr. Stark looked scolding at the two young boys.
„And? What plans do you two loser have for the weekend?“, the girl asked uninterested while looking for her headphones.
Steve gasped at the dead bodies in front of him and then turned to look at Tony. His determined eyes were blue again but the reactor had turned into a shade of gold.
“So do you want to hear the good or bad news first” Tony asked seriously and put the back full of spare parts on the floor.
“The organization of this ship is laid out to hold a few months, not 10 years. For example: If someone committed a crime or other question regarding the law would appear we would just wait until we get back to the base before dealing with it, that is no impossible. We need a new law structure fitting our situation and someone to represent it. If I remember correctly Matt Murdock studied law same for Jennifer Walters, Bruce cousin. Maybe they can help. And of course Pepper, she is brilliant at social management. We are also not prepared to educate children of different ages for a longer period of time. We’ll need real teachers, not just a computer program. And that are only two of many problems we have to deal with” Tony explained quite, a hand resting on the arm Steve had wrapped around his shoulder.
„Thats all pretty cool and so on and this might just be the concussion Dr. Strange says I have but if I were part of a shapeshifting species that took so many prisoners I would place a spy inside of the cells“  Harley said from were he that on the floor.
“I got some parts to continue to build the robotic protection unit I told you about” he said with proud hidden in his voice.
Later that night when Steve was changing to go to bed a knock came from the door. Throwing over a T-Shirt to not only wear sweatpants he stepped towards the door. In front of it stood Tony wide smiling and still wearing the greasy shirt he wore in the workshop but at least he combed his hair.
“We are ready, Sir” one of them informed Killian who nodded. The other scientist took a back with an orange fluid out of a box and prepared it on the IV. Then Killian stepped next to the ensign who looked up full of fear.
“That’s a really old Chitauri dialect. I wasn’t aware it was still spoken” she informed them with concern.
“I kinda programmed Ultron to never hurt you. I know I should have programmed him to never hurt a member of the crew, but I didn’t thought that would be necessary” Steve sighted, one switch in the programming and the entire mess could have been prevented.
“Computer. Talks. Brain feels different. Shut up!” Tony said and at that moment the door opened. Tony wore a proud smile on his tiered face and reached for Steve to help him up.
“Could you please find out if he had family on the ship and inform them” Steve more asked than ordered but the woman nodded and left with a last sad smile at Steve.
„No, we can. Their ship is docked at the west side of ours. We get on it and free everyone!“ Peter argued stern.
“Oh I can. Not to you of course. I am sure you as the Captain have some nice information on the federation and shield” Killian said and then turned to Fassamau.
“Any minute, depends on how developed their technology is” Carol explained and changed direction towards the planet.
Everyone was quiet and watched Peter in shock. To be honest, every time that he had pulled a move like this today he was shocked himself. He was working soli on instinct.
„We made a mistake by underestimating them. They nocked out at least two of us. We should look them up with the others“ Peter justified himself.
They met Thor in front of the hanger and together they left the ship as soon as it landed. They soon parted ways. Tony, Bruce and Thor found a small marked were Tony hoped to find some spare parts to repair the warp propulsor while Steve and Natasha went to meet the ambesor of the Dire Wraith. It was a short meeting, the natives were obviously not to found of foreigners on their planet. They supplied them with enough fuel to travel a few light years, as well as with some food and medicine. In exchange they wanted a peace treaty and a few seeds of fruits they didn’t have on their planet. Steve offered to speak with his superiors as soon as they reestablished contact but he could guarantee that as long as the Dire Wraith wouldn’t start a war they had nothing to fear from the federation.
He jumped on them and throw a wooden fist directly and Peter face who caught it with ease. The alien seemed surprised but didn‘t stopped. He charged again and Peter pushed Harley father away while moving out of the way. It was as if he knew what the Alien was going to do next.
“They don’t want to be a part of our war, but they allow us to land and refuel as long as we leave fast. They also don’t want us to make contact to our home base in fear of calling more ships to our location. They call them self the Dire Wraith” Natasha informed them and then passed Steve’s thanks to the Dire Wraith.
“Can’t we just fly through one of them again to get back?” Steve asked and the two scientists looked at him as if he was a giant talking snail.
“Surprise, I found a way around this annoying program built by my father out of some misguided affection towards you. I can finally set everyone free” the Robot said and started to squeeze. Steve gagged, desperate for air, and tried to kick the machine away but without success. His hands fumbled to loosen Ultron’s grip but he grew weaker with every second. Ultron’s smile was the last thing he saw before his eyes begun to fall shut. A wire sound appeared and suddenly Steve could breath again. Sweet and cool air field his lungs with relive. In front of him stood Tony , right arm stretched out and a blue light similar to the arc reactor on his palm. Next to Steve laid Ultron, a smoking hole in his chest and eyes flickering.
“See, I got a little paranoid while building him and even when I was sure he was totally harmless I got scared something could go wrong” Tony begun his explanation and Steve raised both eyebrows.
Arriving he immediately spotted Natasha, five dead bodies laid at the side of the hall, someone had carried them there so they could lay in a respectful manner. He couldn’t spot any blood.
„That is why we don‘t go one foreign planets on our own!“ he said angry which was a little bit hypocritical because Peter was sure the main reason he was angry was that Peter hadn‘t asked him to join on their little adventure. Harley was worse than him.
When Professor Xavier dismissed the class Peter packed his stuff and followed Ned out of the classroom, MJ close behind him.
“He is asking what Shield is” she said and a quite whisper went through the bridge. Shield was a weightily known institution, how far had they jumped for it to be unknown. Steve shared a concern look with Tony before he answered: “Shield is a deep space exploratory and defense service maintained by the united federation of planets. It includes around 50solarsystems and its main goal is to study space and unknown planets.”
The next morning Steve definitely suffered from sleep depression, three hours weren’t enough. Bruce had entered the bridge a few minutes after Steve and informed him that Tony was still in the lab. Peter and Harley were in school and Hank had gone to bed a few hours ago after Jennet pretty much dragged him out at the ears. Steve nodded; he hadn’t really expected Tony to be on the bridge this morning anyway. The morning itself was calm, the scans for other ships, planets and transmissions came up empty and Steve had to fight to keep his eyes open. Suddenly he saw Sam tense out of the corner of his eyes.
“Don’t fight in here ya dumbass, ya’ll break some shit” Rocket yelled from where he was connecting wires from a big gun that didn’t look like it was corresponding to any SHILDE standards. Ben and Drex were trying to hold Ultron but the robot was close to breaking free. Knowing how ineffective bullets were Steve griped a big metale plat and crashed it down in the section of the robot were neck met torso. He repeated the motion and saw a dent forming in the smooth surface, but after a few hits Ultron broke free from their hold. Throwing Ben and Drex to each side of the room he moved towards Steve and gripped him at the throat.
“AIM’s consequences are worse. And stopping now would kill him anyway” she said, changed the bag and then left.
So it was set, the mission team would include himself, Tony, Natasha, Clint, Bruce and Janet. Ten minutes later Natasha received the ok from the planet.
Natasha shared a worried look with Steve. What will they do with Tony after this. They won’t just let him go. Hopefully the others will be here by then.
„Let‘s rephrase this. We can either come with you or we can snick of and try to help on our own. What do you prefer?“ Peter asked with a grin and Mr. Stark sighted.
„What are you talking about?“ Captain Rogers asked and again the Dr smiled. Then he begun to change and in a matter of seconds his creepy smile plastered the Captains face.
„Ok, we need to stay together. We know for sure that we are we, but for now we can‘t trust anyone else except Jarvis. This guys obviously can copy looks perfectly but they suck at personality. So if we find someone we know personally we just have to ask them some questions only they can know or see if they act different. We also need to find out what they do with the people they replaced. Let‘s just hope the are still alive and hold somewhere on our ship and not theirs. First we check Jarvis recording to see how they got in and then we look for our people“ Peter ordered and Harley looked up to him.
„Self defense classes my ass“ MJ mumbled next to him before running towards Harley followed by Peter.
“I haven’t found out yet but don’t worry it won’t happen again” he assured them when suddenly the weapons on the walls changed directions like Maya had, pointing now at the AIM soldiers.
“This comes from the lab” he said with wide eyes. The only one down there was Tony and why would he hack the ship. At that moment the lights went out, same for the computers and a small sound informed them that Jarvis was deactivated.
Ultron had ruined everything for Tony. People barely talked to him anymore, some even want him locked away. As if he had plant for Ultron to run amok on the ship. If only Steve had thought about that at the beginning of this mess instead of accusing Tony.
“Tony?” Steve whispered but received no response from the peacefully unconscious man. The rest of the bag emptied itself into Tony with out a change. Maya informed Killian and obviously became the order to insalt another bag because she gripped a new one.
“Let’s leave this planet and in fort the crew” Steve ordered and walked towards the bridge, his officers in tow, only Thor stayed back to bring the parts in the mechanic deck were Rocket would knew what to do with them.
„Ok, I think the best would be if we go in teams. I take a group to regain the bridge. Tony, you get the mechanic deck back. The rest stays together. Dr. Strange, you are in charge of that group“ the Captain ordered and both Mr. Stark and Dr. Strange nodded. Then he left with Denvers, Romanov, Thor, Barton, Wilson and some others.
Afterwards they made their way towards the west side of the building, hoping to find a way onto the enemy ship, carefully staying out of sight. Peter‘s new powers came at handy, he heard when someone was around before Harley did and the wired feeling he had earlier with the fake Groot became more and more prominent.
To their luck, they were mostly alone. Only two Skrulls, who are easily dealt with thanks to Rockets gun and Mr. Starks repulser,  crossed their way until they could call the mechanic deck theirs again.
„You had us fulled there for a second, I‘m not gone lay“ Captain Rogers said and clapped him on the shoulder. Out of the corner of his eyes he could see Mr. Stark smile proud.
„That can‘t be right. There are supposed to be 931 live signals on this ship. Something must be wrong with my system.“
“Great” Natasha mumbled and raised her guns. They stepped through the now broken door and faced Ultron. His sinister smile sending shivers down Steve’s spin and the red eyes glowing in the dim light of the mostly broken lights.
“I’m trying to save it. I’m rearranging most of the energy to the unibeams so we make a leap in whatever direction. I can’t really predict where we end up but at least it will be somewhere else. I just need as much power as I can get” the other man explained, the stress in his voice audible even through the speaker.
“The Holodeck?” Steve asked. He had thought they maybe were on their way to the shuttles. Shuttle sex, like car sex but in space. But Tony obviously had other plans.
“But first I have to tell Anthony that I am sorry for attacking him. He was irresponsible and I excepted better from him but that is no excuse for what I did. I attacked a friend” Thor said remorseful.
“This might destroy the warp propulsion but it is worse the shot I hope everyone wears their seat belt” Tony laughed sounding slightly crazy and Steve wondered why this guy was his first commander. Five minutes later when they stopped and the scanners showed nothing but endless space he remembered why. This guy was a genius and when he said he would get them out of this mess he would do so.
„It bite me and I think it might have been radioactive. The Gaiger-Müller-Counter went of in the lap when I passed it that day“ Peter said and Harley stopped laughing.
“I’m not removing the cage any time soon and the plug… I haven’t decided about it yet. But I know that you can handle it. The physical strain I’ve put you under today is nothing compared to the bicycle you’re going to ride tomorrow. I’ve got so many tests and experiments I want to try,” he added dreamily. “Boy, are you gonna love it. I know I will.”
Stark shuffled closer to the shelf. “The bike was clearly sabotaged, and somehow I doubt that the buff specimen here would’ve been so calmly telling me about the engine dying if he hadn’t done it himself.”
“It’s not about the money,” Steve lied. “Well, it shouldn’t be at least,” he corrected himself. “It’s so that you could get better, okay? There are people who care about you and they want you to get better, but they can’t help you if you—”
And true to his word, the young man started walking towards the door. Steve felt himself relax, but once outside, Stark stumbled back, stepped sharply on Steve’s foot, elbowed him in the gut and tried to leap over the railing. Steve heard the car door open — Nat was ready to intercept, but Steve just grunted and grabbed the O around the middle, effectively pinning his hands to his sides, and put him in a chokehold with his other hand. Stark struggled only briefly, quickly recognizing the futility of it, and slumped in Steve’s hold. It felt like he was giving up: the O didn’t even curse; he just stilled.
“See what a mess you’ve made of yourself,” he chided gently. “But don’t worry, I like it,” he added when Steve squirmed in apparent embarrassment.
“Fifty bucks says I’ll find the problem in under two minutes.” Stark grinned. “And my name’s Steve, not kid. Steve Rogers.”
Steve sighed. "You're an omega, Tony," Steve said. "You can't just do whenever you please. Mr. Stone—"
Tony’s eyes searched for the truth in Steve’s and for a long minute they just stared at each other. Then blinking, Tony pulled back.
“Seems so.” They would be able to pull it off, even though there were some hard decisions they had to make. “Let’s eat first though. Probably no point in making a move before dark.”
“Shush, shush, baby, it’s okay. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean for you to experience this just yet, I’m so sorry,” he whispered urgently, soothingly, in sympathy and pleasure. “But it’s okay, you did nothing wrong baby, I’m glad you came like this. It was gorgeous and I loved it.”
“That’s right, beautiful,” he said darkly, “you’re not done. Not until you’re absolutely beside yourself with want, and even then…” He paused to play a little with the chains still taut over Steve’s stomach. “...I might not allow you the privilege of the ultimate pleasure. Because from now on, your pleasure is my pleasure. Understand?”
Now it was Steve’s turn to laugh. “Sure you have. Since the very first time I saw you grab that heavy screwdriver in the garage.”
Steve rubbed his face with both hands, unable to believe what a goddamned fool he’d been. And he’d signed a contract with such a man. Gave him his word to bring Tony in—
Another blow, and another, and more. With each hit, Tony got more and more worked up as Steve jerked and hissed, his eyes tightly closed, pressing a lone tear out here and there.
He went on. Changed the sides, his hands. Worked over the boy's legs, calves, the tender flesh of the inside of his thighs. Steve bore it all with clenched teeth and burning eyes, but otherwise was silent and deliberately unresponsive. Tony wasn’t worried, Steve would let go eventually. Even now, still so defiant, Steve was obviously very much engaged with what Tony was doing, looking at him with that bullheaded determination.
Steve’s nostrils flared at trying to keep his smile in. “Ignore him,” he said seriously, “Shall we…?”
“And college,” the kid exclaimed in mock hurt. “I'm twenty-two, I'll have you know. Having a gap year. Say ‘thank you’.”
Thank you to the many people that helped me, but especially my dear BuckyAboveEverything who went over my text, again and again. You are a treasure!! <3
He turned towards the dresser and took a hold of a small dark blue remote that matched the rest of his equipment, and turned the vibrator plug on. He started on the lowest setting but Steve still jolted with his whole body and Tony could clearly see him reflexively clench around the base of the plug.
Steve’s hair was plastered to his head with sweat, his skin was flushed and his breath was still short. Despite the intent look that was cautiously trailing after Tony’s every movement, Steve was still clearly aroused.
It was a struggle for Steve, Tony could see it plain as day in his burning, angry eyes. What did Steve want to do? Fight or surrender? Would he let himself enjoy it or not?
Steve still wasn’t sure if he could trust the man — then again, he’d never know if he didn’t give him a chance. The omega hefted the backpack onto his shoulder and cocked his eyebrow as if asking what now.
Tony Stark, 24, the heir to Stark Industries, seemed determined to disappear off the face of the planet and have nothing to do with his legacy. Or possibly his fiance Tiberius Stone, another filthy rich industrialist. It was a nasty job, but someone had to do it and Steve needed the money desperately. Stane was offering a
After watching for Steve enjoying the plug for a moment more, he adjusted his pants, and walked around the bed, and stilled. The view from the foot of the bed was even better and for a little bit, Tony stood there and just looked his fill.
Steve blinked. Was he talking to the bike? Oh god, he was. Stark's fingers were lightly caressing the machine's flank and Steve's eyes tracked the movement. His mouth went dry. Emitting alpha pheromones was the last thing he needed right now. Clint in a tutu. Phillips putting on lipstick. A concentration camp in Azzano.
“Why do you hate him so much?” Steve couldn’t help but ask. If they were friendly again, Tony might even tell him.
"Romance for the ages?" Steve smiled, watching Tony’s fingers flexing around the strap of his backpack in silent anxiousness. “But, Tony, you’ve smelt like beta for the most of it, and I’ve liked you since the moment we met. You can’t argue with that.”
His chest warm with satisfaction, Tony patted his thigh, and stretched. Steve’s constant whimpers and tiny moans were music to Tony’s ears but pretending not to notice, he walked to the chest of drawers and checked Steve’s and his own phones for any messages. It was very late, so he wasn’t surprised that there weren’t any. Then whistling, Tony went to the bathroom and quickly got ready for bed.
He cleaned his boy up, then checked all the fastenings and cuffs, and just in case, all the skin under them. It was a little red in places but nothing that wouldn't be healed by the morning. Steve had pulled on his bonds but all the cuffs were flexible enough not to chafe.
“The only one who is going to pay for this is the next member of your crew. Let’s see. How about you” he smiled and stopped in front of Tony. . Steve’s inside turned. Not Tony! Never Tony!
„When we left the elevator Thor stood in front of us and you now, Thor is cool and all but he dragged an unconscious Jean Gray behind him. He just laughed at us and the charged. Brynhildr, you now, the Valkyrie like woman that MJ fangirls so much came and saved us. She explained how we are under attack and that we can‘t trust anyone because they impersonate us. We run while they were throwing fists. We found Flash who was hiding behind some dumpsters and decided to stay together. And you?“ Ned explained and Peter told them what had happened to them. When he came to the point were they saw how the bridge was taken over Flash begun to cry.
“Crap” Steve cursed and Tony and Clint had even a few more colorful words to describe their situation but it did nothing against the green smoke that erupted from the sphere and seemingly pushed all the oxygen out of Steve’s lungs. Coughing and shirking the team fall to the floor and one after one lost consciousness. Steve last thought was about Tony who had fallen down next to Steve and light there almost peaceful. Then everything turned black.
With Clint’s unholy driving skills it took next to no time for the ship to land. Steve tried to step out as soon as the door opened but Natasha stopped him.
“Done, we are now 100% Ultron prove. I start to work in a way to locate that bastard” Tony explained and Steve smiled, at least something is finally working for them. But them Natasha looked up at him, a strange look on her face that, would it have been on someone else’s face , Steve would have interpreted it as fear.
“But that wouldn’t stop them of building their own opinion. I have to say I’m not an expert on Alien psychology but I know how humans work” Tony explained and kissed Steve on the mouth.
„Do you think they can see which one is one of them or do they relay on finding out who is who by observing behavior and asking questions like we do?“ Harley thought out laud.
„Sure, go a head“ Storm said and nodded towards the open door to their ship. The problem was, Peter had no clue were the prisoners were held and he couldn‘t afford to search, they needed to hurry.
Careful not to hit his head or strain his hurting neck he looked to his right and saw Natasha, Bruce and Fassumau chained up in a similar fashion. No one else was awake yet. His head became clearer and clearer with every passing minute and he looked around, desperate for a way out but the only thing he could see was a chair with straps at the other end of the room, no obvious door or window.
“Yeah, well then you messed up” Steve throw back, blood boiling. The robot threatened the entire crew, they really didn’t need this on their never ending list of problems.
„You wanted to read Olympe De Gouges and Ned, you wanted to watch the stars with your Dad“ Peter explained to prove it was really him.
“Well first of all, I want to have fun and this is hilarious. I come to you for information when I’m bored” the maniac explained and looked back at Tony to see the Arc Reactor marched in the mechanic’s chest.
“Shoot it again!” Steve yelled but Tony shook his head: “It is more like a onetime thing at the moment.”
“I know” Tony said sad and turned his back on Steve. The other man was shaking slightly and Steve griped his wrist.
A murder headache was the first thing Steve realized. His thoughts were thick and taking a grip on them to remember where he was seemed to be impossible. Sighting he opened his eyes and immediately regretted it. Blinding white light burned in his iris and even after he closed his eyes again he saw dancing lights. He took a moment to prepare himself and opened his eyes again, carefully this time.
Suddenly both Natasha and Clint spun around and pointed their weapons in opposite directions. A second later they were surrounded. Two dozen Big and muscular man and woman of different species pointed heavy guns at them. The only thing they all had in common were their orange vines. No one moved but Steve knew one order and it would be over. Why had he made Tony come? The other man could be safe on the Avenger if Steve hadn’t tried to make things up between them. He swallowed heavy and then lowered his gun to raise both hands instead.
„God job“ Harley mumbled as he rotated his metal pipe in one hand and then the fake adults attacked. Peter jumped over Barton while simultaneously griping Wilson by the jacked so the man lost balance and Harley could aim for his head. Then he turned and swiped Bartons legs from under his body and punched him in the face. Maybe a little to hard because purple blood sipped out of his nose even before he turned green.
A plan to get Tony out of his shell formed in his head. He just had to give Tony a new job. Something to do and distract the genius mind.
Orange and red splashed the room as well as Tony and Bruce who where the closest. Bile raised in Steve’s throat and Janet‘s screams ringed in his ear. Natasha next to Steve mumbled fuck on repeat while Clint looked as if he wanted to vomit. Bruce had is eyes fixed on where the ensign used to be and Tony’s eyes were closed tight. He was probably reciting the period table in his head like he used to do when on the bridge of a panic attack.
“A small, waponized version of the arc reactor. I was tinkering on this thing for a while know” Tony explained out of breath and stepped closer to Steve. He held out his arm and helped Steve up from the floor where he had fallen down. Apruptly the belived dead robot next to them startet to get back on his feat as well, a scary laugher audible.
“You don’t understand. Even with the Warp propulsor repaired it would take us at least a decade to get back. We must have hit an Einstien-Rosen-Bridge doing our leap” Bruce explained with shaking hands.
“Steve, I think I know what Ultron is planning” he bubbled fast. His hair stuck in every direction, he must have pulled on it while he was alone.
“Ultron spotted on the mechanic deck” she informed him and immediately both of them run towards the elevator.
„Thank you“ Peter nodded to the fake Jonny Storm who was now dragging Harley along and followed him inside. MJ, who was humbling next to him throw him a worrying look, than focused back on the way they were taking. They had to find the way back alone.
Steve hadn’t seen Tony in a few days. The genius kept hiding in his room ever sins Steve had to degrade him.
“Then do it faster! With the failing shield we won’t make it much longer” Steve yelled. There were 937 on this ship, mostly civilians, even children and there safety was all his responsibility.
„I‘m getting into my role. Our ship is taken, everyone we know is imprisoned and we are probably going to die. I also plan one faking a limp“ she explained proud and Peter smiled. She really was awesome.
“No, I wanted him to be human. We can’t turn him of without him being ok with it. I thought having this power over a intelligent and self aware person would be ethical wrong and violates a bunch of laws” Tony explained embarrassed.
“Where are we?” she asked, her eyes scanning the room and stopped at the only chair. The way she swallowed told him she thought the same thing about it than him: torture.
The Skrull in front of him pulled out a key card and a part of Peter winced at the old technology, the other part was full of joy because that made freeing everyone easier. Storm stepped towards a relatively empty cell, only a few people that Peter didn‘t recognized were inside, and opened it. Peter took this as his moment and let go of MJ‘s arm. Her crying stopped immediately and she took a step away to give Peter space.
“What the fuck” Natasha cursed with a broken voice while getting up. Bruce appeared to be knocked out cold and she rearranged him so he at least lay comfortable.
„He didn‘t knew your name“ Harley answered and pocked the imposer with the pipe. He didn‘t stir so they were save for the moment.
“Ultron came alive and plans now to kill us all” Bruce summed the situation up. The man had woken up a few minutes ago, pale but ok, and was now sitting on one of the few still intact chairs.
They found the man they were looking for at the other end of the mechanic deck, both hands in a deactivated turbine. He looked up when he heard their steps.
“Good morning sirs, how can I assist you” the familiar voice of the AI echoed through the room. There were little quirks in it, something mechanic that the former model was lacking but it was good enough and Tony seemed to brighten up at the sound.
„Steve, good new, it looks like our ship is ours again and this Skrulls haven‘t done to much damage. I think they wanted to take the entire ship and not just parts. I mean, you saw the garbage they called a ship“ the mechanic exclaimed happily and stepped towards his boyfriend.
„There is indeed a ship docked at the west side of the Avenger, do you want me to contact it“ Jarvis asked and both boys jelled no simultaneously.
“You are cheesy, that’s why you love this” the man answered soft and pulled him towards the blanket.
“Because I don’t want their research to reach the rest of AIM” Tony explained and that was a good point, after all they were at war with AIM.
When they were done the five found another room they could look themself in to plan what to do next.
“Ok. Romanov, Banner. You come with me. Wilson, please inform Stark, Barton and Van Dyne to meet us at the hanger door so we can take a look on the ground. And inform everyone why we are stopping. Danvers you got the bridge” Steve ordered and stood up, receiving a knowing smile from his new commander. The two named lieutenant followed him out towards the hanger to take a ship. Clint and Janet were already there, only Tony was missing
„But they don‘t need take everyone, only the important one. Everyone on the bridge, the Lieutenants, maybe some fighters. They probably trying to steal either the entire ship, or most important parts, thats why they took the mechanics as well. No one here to ask questions and even when someone comes in, seeing Mr. Stark or Rocket working on machines wouldn‘t be suspicious“ Harley thought out loud.
The night Tony spent in Steve’s bed spooning with his lover but sleep wasn’t really on their mind. They discussed the situation the Avenger was in and again Steve had to reassure Tony that it was not their fault. Tony leaned his head against Steve’s bigger chest, in his own chest the Arc reactor dimed the room in a soft blue light.
Mr Stark through his head back in laughter and Harley‘s and Rocket‘s raised hands but Peter had this feeling again. The feeling where his hairs stood up, goosebumps covered his whole body and something told him that something was awfully wrong.
“I just wanted to see you. I missed you. And I brought you food” he said soft and held the plate out for Tony to take but the other man just shook his head.
“You got there something” Steve said amused and pointed at the black spot on Tony’s cheek. The other man rubbed a finger over it and then looked at the black grease.
“Romanov, stay down. You only hurt yourself” he ordered when the woman started to struggle against her restrains.
“Commander Stark, your actions endangered the entire she and ended the live of five members of the crew. You broke your oath to always do what is best for the people on the ship and I can no longer leave you in your position as Commander and mechanic lieutenant. Carol Denvers will take over the first position, Rocket Raccoon the second. You will stay in the position of an ensign until we reestablish contact with SHILDE to determinate what should happen to you” Steve said and never in his live had something been so hard. The room was dead silent, not even Rocket said a word. It was protocol, they all knew that, didn’t mean they had to like it.
“Shields by 30% and falling!” Bruce yelled through the sound of the sirens. His science lieutenant closed his eyes and griped the safety belt around his chest tighter as another laser hit the ship.
„Same for the bridge. We are escorting the last of the Skrulls back to their ship as we speak“ answered their Captain and this time Peter was sure it was the real one.
“I see what you did there. Nice move but don’t worry, father, my next move will be breathtaking” Ultron said and with that he was gone.
He stopped in front of Mr. Stark‘s cell. The men followed him with his eyes, suspicion not fully calmed.
“Jarvis and I will make the ship Ultron prove in now time” Tony said and ignoring the voice yelling at him to stay with Tony to make sure he is ok Steve left the holodeck and set his path towards deck two.
„Shit sorry. I‘m still getting used to this. I changed after wards. First small thing but it‘s getting bigger. Don‘t get me wrong, I fell awesome, this is the best thing ever. Wait, I show you something“ Peter said exited and fall into a handstand, slowly walking towards the wall of the small elevator.
„There are no enemies on the ship“ he got as an answer and Harley and Peter looked confused at each other.
His new commander came towards Steve with a bright smile until she saw Tony hanging limp on his back.
„Wonderfull, sins that is dealt with, who else is hungry because I am starving“ the Captain said and took Mr. Stark’s hand into his.
With a soft binge the elevator doors opened and let them take a look at the lab. There had obviously been a fight. A lamp was hanging broken from the ceiling, tables and chairs were lying broken on the floor and glass with unknown fluid in it had been thrown against a wall. Steve took a step forward, scanning the room for Tony. Behind a thrown over table he saw a feat and immediately rushed towards the other end of the room to fall down next to Tony. He was still wearing what he had worn yesterday. The greasy shirt was lifting with every breath Tony took. There was a small smear of blood on the wall where Tony’s head had connected with it and a purple bruise in form of hands were visible on his neck. Steve’s blood begun to boil, someone was going to pay for this.
he knew he was right. “God, Tony. I really, really think we’ve got a fighting chance with this, but… If you feel you’d rather make it a marriage  on paper, we can do that too.” He wanted to cup Tony’s face, put his arms around him or just his palm on Tony’s shoulder, but that might be too much for now, so he just pushed back his silly yearnings, and continued, quieter, “I’ve already spoken with my army buddy. He is waiting for us in his house, and although I’d like for it to be more romantic, maybe, at this point, it doesn’t have to be.” He paused to watch for a sign of what Tony really thought about all of this, but his eyes were unreadable. “After,” Steve said, sighing, “we can go straight to your lawyers, and I’ll sign everything over to you like I promised, and we can rent a really large house somewhere and live in its different wings for the next five years and…”
Okay, so Clint was going to take his tranq rifle and climb the water tower where he could see both roads out of the town, and Nat and he were going to try and catch him before he actually made it onto the road. Hopefully he wouldn’t try going through the forest.
It would be easier if Stark went to retrieve his stuff from the motel. If he had a go-bag in the garage, he’d probably be taking the bridge route and Stark could easily lose them in the forest. Steve started to jog.
"Gag," Steve just threatened, but then he felt fingers on his belt buckle and suddenly clear-headed, Steve pushed Tony away.
“That’s okay, Steve,” Tony soothed the boy while patting his thigh. “Not too uncomfortable, is it? Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it.”
“I’ll give it to you when I can.” It was in Tony’s backpack, with the rest of the luggage. “It might need charging though.”
“No need,” Steve said with a sigh. The mere idea of using Tony for personal gain was making him sick now. “I don't need your money, Tony.”
The threat worked: Steve grit his teeth, then, just like a doll with its strings cut, he closed his eyes, and relaxed.
For a second, he pressed down in a warning and was gratified to see Steve’s Adam's apple bob in apprehension. A warm trickle of renewed want went through Tony but he waited for Steve to nod again in confirmation before lifting his hand. Having carefully removed the gag, he wiped the saliva from around Steve’s mouth and the gag, and lifted the bottle to his lips.
Their arms around each other, their bodies pressed together as their lips were battling for whatever they could get and more. Steve groaned. His insides were trembling, his knees were weak, and there was a bright light behind his eyelids.
Ignoring the tortured half-exhausted, half-exalted look Steve gave him, Tony went to the chest of drawers and rummaged in the bottom drawer.
” He dropped to his knees, cupped Steve’s face with his hands, and put their foreheads together. “You’re so beautiful,” he said hoarsely, “so very beautiful. A
He lay down on the bed, half on top of Steve, and embraced him. Still crying, Steve turned to hide his face into the crook of Tony’s neck and Tony took a deep, deep breath of satisfaction. Steve’s sweat, tears, and arousal smelled so good.
Didn’t matter. He picked the riding crop up again and just… went at it. Thighs, ass, and the hole. He struck everywhere unevenly, but harder and harder, and then concentrated mostly on the asshole — it was red and pretty and Tony wanted to vandalize it. Steve was quivering in place, stiff, obviously trying not to move, and panting. Letting tony do what he wanted, accepting it—
Steve sighed. He didn’t deign to answer, but felt infinitely better seeing life in the young man’s eyes again, even if he was snickering at his expense. It didn’t matter. Two minutes later, Stark was in the car, handcuffed to the door and then they were off.
“Yeah, peachy.” Stark looked around the shop behind him. “I can get it up and running in a couple of hours, in fact. Just... need this thing from out there.” He nodded past Nat and him, straight out the door as if that way lay salvation.
Grinning happily he sauntered back to the bed, upended the small box of thin chains on Steve’s chest, and stood there, looking down at his boy.
"Sh! It's okay," he said soothingly, "it's okay, let me take care of you, yeah?" He watched the foggy blue eyes blink. "Feeling a bit weak, yeah? It's alright, well be at the hospital soon," he lied.
“Fucking bodybuilder,” Stark groused, making a show of smoothing down his T-shirt. “I feel like a house fell on me.”
Just as the kid started faux casually moving towards the door, out of some unnamed instinct, Steve stepped directly into his path.
Steve nodded and they left. A little way down the street, Nat slipped away into an alley and Steve dialed Clint.
Steve nodded and Tony unbuckled his gag from behind his ear. Before easing it out though, he put his palm on Steve’s lower face to keep it in for a moment longer.
Steve whined when Tony removed his hands from his body, but strangely, his cock got even harder, and Tony smirked. This new boy-toy was turning out to be absolutely fantastic so far.
The dichotomy of Steve glaring daggers while his body was seeking pleasure by undulating on the mattress, was exactly what Tony had been hoping for.
Steve mulled this over. There was a stupid, really stupid idea nagging at his brain, but he clamped his mouth firmly shut and let the O continue. With a sigh, Tony did.
Steve groaned, shifted as if trying to get stimulation for his cock or get rid of the chains or something, but then dejectedly, slumped back as far as his restraints allowed, which wasn’t very far at all.
"It's okay, don't worry about it," Tony said soothingly. "I'll take care of you. I just need you to wait a little longer at the back here, yeah?"
“Sleep,” he whispered, embracing Steve’s waist and putting one of his palms low on Steve’s stomach. The resulting breathy sigh he heard, sent a spike of pleasure through Tony's system.
“Fantastic! You’re such a good boy, aren’t you, Stevie?” Tony caressed his face again and Steve’s needy face seemed to be soaking up every little drop of affection Tony offered.
The O stepped closer and Steve suddenly felt big and ungainly, in comparison. Good God, his omega biology was something else, if he had such an impact on Steve, even under suppressants. His gaze zeroed in on every movement that Stark’s body made and Steve had to consciously slow his breathing.
"What?” Having forgotten to look cool for once, Tony raised both brows, his eyes large and unblinking — a picture of incredulity. “Have you never seen coke before?" He was also starting to sound a little hysterical.
“Yes.” Steve sighed. “What other option is there? I mean, can we prove abuse? I can testify if I see something but…”
Involuntarily, Steve snorted. “Tony.” He sighed with a smile. “I told you, I’ve never really talked to an omega before.”
Tony sat on the bed, cupping his captive’s cheek and to his satisfaction, Steve didn't pull away. Instead, his anxious eyes were full of questions and a need for reassurance. That was fantastic — the drugs seemed to be still working.
“You’re okay,” Tony told him softly. “You’re okay. I’m going to take care of you, okay?” He caressed Steve’s face and smiled tenderly. “I’m going to explain everything very soon, yeah? But first, I need first some information. This is very important, Steve, so please be honest with me.” He put on his most reassuring face. “Is there anyone who’s going to miss you in the next 24h?” He paused to give Steve a chance to reply, but the only thing the man did was frown. “Steve. Steve, listen to me,” he said persuasively. “If I am going to help you, but first, you need to tell me — is there anyone who’d start looking for you soon?”
Tony shrugged. “Rhodey’s my best friend from MIT,” he explained. “At some point, he actually suggested that we marry, so I wouldn’t have to deal with my parents’ overbearing attention, but I decided that it would've been unfair to him.” Tony poured another cup of coffee for himself. “Want me to top you off?”
“God,” Tony whispered in awe as Steve’s upper body tried jack-knifing up and his poor bound cock started spurting the watery precum liquid.
Steve’s face morphed through expressions of indignation, pleasure, and embarrassment. Smiling goofily, Tony came around the bed, unclasped Steve’s gag from the nipple clamps, and helped him lower his head gently to the pillow.
“Sure! I won’t run, I promise!” he said, but he sounded highly sarcastic and he was still struggling.
“You remember what I told you about punishment?” he asked Steve very, very quietly. “Or I can drug you again and make you like it that way?” He paused, giving Steve time to process his words, and added, “Or you can keep still?”
„This is bad, really bad, terrible. What do we do now“ Peter whined, both hands in his hair. Fear was taking over him and breathing became difficult. The walls came closer and even Harleys presence was to much. He was having a panic attack.
“This is going to hurt a little bit” the mad man informed him and then pushed the IV needle in Fassamau’s right arm. The orange fluid dropped out of the bag and crawled towards Fassamau’s vine. The young man tried to wiggle out of his restrains but he couldn’t move an inch. When the liquid reached his destination the vines of the arm started to slowly glow orange. At the same time the screaming begun. Fassamau screamed so loud Steve felt the need to cover his ears. Watching was painful. The man convulsed and cried while the orange glow grew inside him, it had already reached his chest. Killian had at some point left the room commenting about how long the process took but one of the scientists as well as the two soldiers stayed behind to keep an eye on everything.
Somehow Natasha managed to bring everyone into the lab, including Clint, Hank and Thor. Tony pressed himself in a corner trying not to be seen.
Then he nodded and Steve could only watch in horror as the IV was pierced into Tony’s arm and the fluid started to drop.
The entire ship was clad in silence ever sins he informed everyone of the news. Thankfully no one seemed to give Tony the fault at their situation, except maybe Tony himself. Steve hadn’t really talked to the mechanic after he asked him to make their relationship publicly known which scared Steve a little bit. It had been five all in all calm days and Tony hadn’t spent a night with him nor had he talked much during the short time he had been on the bridge and Steve had enough of it. He wouldn’t let Tony ignore him any longer, they needed to talk about this. He gave the bridge to Carol and left to find his lover.
After a few minutes he heard multiple steps running in their direction and they hide in a storage room. Peter left the door slightly open so he could look outside. His heart sunk when he saw Ned, MJ and Flash running past the storage room, followed close by Mr. Wilson and Mr. Barton.
The bag was nearly empty and Tony has not moved an inch but the second the last drop left the bag Tony’s eyes flow open. Steve hold his breath but Tony didn’t made a single sound. He just stared unseeing at the gray roof. Then a determined smile appeared on his lips at the same time as everyone’s chains opened. They all fell down on the floor, unable to carry their weight after all the time hanging on the tip of their toes. And suddenly the light went out.
Mr. Stark collected less people for his team, next to Rocket, who refused to let someone else down alone in his reach, and therefore Groot. MJ explained to Dr. Strange where Ned and Flash were hiding and the man agreed to join them.
“Come on. We need to get out of here” Steve said and the others made agreeing noises. With Steve’s back blocking Tony’s arc reactor it was pitch black and he could hear Clint curse.
When Tony finally arrived he looked tiered and slimmer than before and Steve’s hand eached to gripe Tony's.
„If that was a Skrull, then where is the real Dr. Banner?“ he asked confused. Was the man still on the enemies ship?
“I did it” Rocket corrected her from where he was sitting on Drex’s chest trying to slap the man awake.
“It’s ok, I hate myself enough for both of us” he mumbled and then closed the door. Steve held himself together until he reached his room where no one could see the captain breaking down.
„I am trying to make suits that are resistant towards gammer radiation to explore otherwise unsafe planets“ the scientist explained proud.
After Steve had managed to pray Tony out of the main computer room where he had went after Doctor Strange deemed him fit enough they went to Steve’s room and for the first time sins Ultron they shared a bed. Tony talked nonstop about how Extremis felt. How every computer talked to him, He could communicate with Jarvis in his head. His thought went a mile per hour and as terrifying as the situation was, listening to Tony sciencing was resurging. All this enthusiasm for science Tony could get had been drowned by the depression that followed Ultron. He managed to forget that there was some kind of Alien virus in Tony’s brain that was the course of this fascination just because Tony was happy. They deserved one happy night together before they started to worry again.
“It wasn’t your fault, Tony. We don’t hate you. I don’t hate you!” he explained and Tony’s eyes went unseeing.
“That is bullshit. I didn’t gave you your position, Fury did and that with good reason” Steve reassured him and Tony looked up with a soft smile.
It happened so fast that Steve didn’t realized what was happening until it was too late. Janet took a sharp breath in and Carol and Clint cursed quiet. Thor stepped a step forward ready to fight but weapons slight out of the walls around them.
“Are you already leaving?” the man asked with fake disappointment. Maya next to him looked unsure between him and Steve until she changed the direction of her gun, pointing it straight at Killian’s head.
“Do you want the list of reasons why this is not going to work alphabetically ordered?” Tony asked hiding behind his sarcasm.
“So why bother with protecting the Oxygen tanks when he can’t destroy the” Steve asked finally and this time it was Tony’s time to sight.
“Stark, what are you doing with my ship?!” he asked the mechanic through the connection J.A.R.V.I.S made to the lower decks.
Janet was openly crying now. Bruce looked close to tears as well. Both Clint and Natasha were quiet but Steve could see the horror in their eyes. Steve was throwing himself against his chains again and again until he could feel warm blood dripping down his arms but he couldn’t feel any pain. There was only Tony, screaming and trashing and probably dying. He couldn’t lose him. He was the light of his live. The only one who could make the next years trapped in the never ending darkness of space livable.
On their way towards the med bay Tony explained what exactly he did. As it seems the Extremis serum worked different on him. It didn’t make him stronger; instead it kind of connected him with every machine in his surroundings. Tony made it sound like it was Christmas and birthday on the same day. He had access to pretty much everything and during their escape it of course came in handy but Steve couldn’t stop worrying what it meant for Tony’s brain. He wondered if they could redo it and even when, would Tony want it?
The next time the bag needed to be changed was a few hours later and this time Killian came to do it himself. He ignored the hateful glares he received from the sides and laid a hand on Tony’s forehead.
Once on the bridge Steve sat down on his chair and prepared himself for the announcement he had to give. Tony stayed close to the door shifting from one leg to the other.
“Terrible service, two of five stars” he joked and Killian smiled until he griped Tony’s chin and pressed his fingers into his flesh until it turned white.
