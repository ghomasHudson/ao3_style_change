“She kissed me first, don’t you remember? But yes, I kissed her back. I just wanted to try what I learned from the TV.”
“Jeez, Cas, it's not poisoned. If I wanted to kill you, I would find some fancy way.” Cas still doesn't believe him, so Dean takes a spoon in his hand and tries some of the gruel. “See? I'm alive. It's good and sweet, strawberry flavor. It will be okay for your throat.”
He doesn’t look at John. Now, he wants to check on Cas who is his real heaven, not an abusive father.
Cas isn't sure which thing is the most intense to him. A smell of cigarettes? A taste of a beer? Or maybe a sound of a music from an old jukebox?
“What?” he asks, and that's the moment when Dean's lips crushes his. He's surprised first, but he melts into the kiss. It's an incredible feeling, he can't compare this to anything else. But he knows already, it's something he will want to do again.
“I know, but your father will be there...” Castiel isn't a big fan of John Winchester. Earlier, he knew him only from stories, and he didn't have a clear opinion about him. Everything changed when they met personally. Cas thinks John is a piece of shit, or in the words of his older brother he is a great big bag of dicks. He never said it to Dean, of course because he knew that he loves his father anyway. He doesn't want to destroy their relationship, but he can't pretend it's okay. Sometimes, he thinks that Dean has a sort of Stockholm syndrome.
Later, it’s a longing, so Cas watches. He admires Dean, feeding his eyes only by staring at him. He’s tracing freckles on his face, looking for some new which appeared since their last appointment. He’s observing how Dean’s chest rises and falls slowly in every breath during his deep sleep. And he’s looking at his soul. Still bright, still beautiful… Still Dean’s.
Being a human could be annoying. Cas understood it when he didn't go to the restroom at a gas station, and he begged Dean to stop Impala ten minutes later (unfortunately, he had to urinate into the bushes). Or when he didn't eat breakfast and his stomach grumbled. Dean thought it was hilarious, but it definitely wasn't funny for Cas (he didn't enjoy hunger at all). There were more small things he couldn't get used to, and one of them was imperfect memory.
Castiel has never been in love before, but he likes all of these warm feelings in his heart, even if he thinks he can’t have Dean ever. He likes to be close to him, and he takes every opportunity to spend time together. It's enough for him, it must be enough. He sometimes dreams about kissing Dean or maybe even about something more, but he knows it's not going to happen. And it's okay. The thing is, if Cas had to decide to some physical intimacy with somebody, it would be Dean. Nobody else, just Dean. And that's why he doesn't like when Dean flirts with waitresses or strange women in the bar for him.
“I'm gonna bath him now,” says Dean one evening. Another step, another task, another thing he should do to help his brother.
He wasn’t sure if angels could feel like this, but there he is, a final proof. Dean knew for a long time that he liked Cas more than just a friend, but he has never thought these feelings were reciprocated. Dean cleared his throat, he wasn’t sure what he should to do.
“What? No, I'm sure we did. Was there a new attack?” Cas is a little confused. They didn't have any case for weeks.
Dean feels Cas' eyes on him, so he turns his head and asks: “What's up? Jody said something interesting?”
Dean frowns his eyebrows. Cas has bulging eyes and looks like the other day when they came to the brothel, and he was afraid. Is he scared now too?
“You were talking with Dean about me and my feelings? Why?” he asks curious and feels something strange in his guts, or maybe Jimmy's guts.
He pulls out a gun from his belt, and Sam moves fast close to him. Of course, he won't let him do this! He will fight if he has to. But fortunately, his brother doesn't point at Jack, he doesn't even reload his gun, the muzzle is directed down, and he just gives it to Sam. And this gesture says more than any word. Sam feels relief even then he knows they’ll have to take a long way till everything will come back to normal.
“If you want… But better choose something small and symbolic. We have time, so we can go to the other shops.”
Thinking about Jack doesn't make that he stops thinking about Cas. Just the opposite, it makes that he thinks about him even more often. Jack has exactly the same eyes, and it hurts every time when he's looking at him, but it also comforts him somehow because he can see a part of Cas in this baby. He didn't understand it first, Jack is son of Satan, he should look like Lucifer, but his face is so soft and familiar, he chose Cas to be his father, it must be the only explanation.
“You said ‘anytime’, and I need a hug now,” explains Cas, and Dean chuckles after that. Sweet, innocent Cas…
It takes Cas only a second before he leans to Dean's lips and kisses him softly. And it's not that he's accepted or tolerated, but he's welcomed. Dean wants him by his side. He wants to wake up next to him, and for Cas it's everything he ever wished for.
“Oh, it’s nothing important. Today, we have Valentine’s Day, and people give presents to each other when they’re in love,” he explained, and Cas nod in understanding.
When the nurse comes to take him to the surgery, Dean isn't scared, he's feeling peace. He was afraid that his father won't be at the hospital to support him. But the truth is that his real dad is here already.
Dean comes closer to him and scratches his head nervously. He tries to smile, but it's not easy: “I didn't know that angels can feel that way… Um, I'm not good at talking about that stuff, but I like you, Cas. I mean, I like you more than friend.”
Cas drops the bag with the pie on the floor. Dean pulls back, breathing heavily. His heart is pounding, but at least he's sure about his feelings now.
“Yes, of course I meant it.” Cas slowly looks at Dean, checking his reaction, but he doesn't seem to be angry. It's good, maybe they can fix it. “I'm in love with you.”
Cas is staring at Dean’s tattoo, but he doesn’t understand what does it mean. He tilts his head and opens his mouth to ask: “Why?”
She’s not prepared for this, so she changes subject. Again: “Why don’t you go play with the other kids?”
Cas stays in the garage for a moment longer. He raises his fingers to his mouth slowly, just to process what actually happened.
Dean spends most of his time drinking and walking around the bunker. Once, he is wondering if he shouldn't go to Cas' room, but he doesn't find enough courage to do this yet. He's not sure how he could react to seeing angel's stuff. Probably there's not many of them, Cas owned only a few things.
There’s a picture of the porch in a wooden house near to the lake. He sees two wicker chairs, it looks domestic and… nice.
“I think I remember now,” mumbled Cas when they separated for a second to take a breath. “That was definitely what I was looking for.”
“I miss you Cas,” he whispers, and walks away to the bathroom. He doesn't see when Jack's eyes glows with a pure gold light.
Dean clears his throat and takes a deep breath: “You changed me too, Cas. You’ve shown me how to be the best version of myself. And when I was thinking that everything was a lie, you’ve shown me that there was still hope because we were still real.”
Dean almost swallows his tongue, it's not the words which he expected to hear from an Angel of the Lord. He gulps loudly, hoping that Cas won't notice anything, and clears his throat.
For the first time, he appears by the lake when John is fishing. The older Winchester jumps at his chair and grumbles: “It's you!”
“Of course, Dean,” says Cas, nodding. He doesn’t want to stop, but if it’s necessary, he can do this. “But… Could I receive the last one?”
“I know, he takes a hot chocolate with a whipped cream and toffee sauce. It would be perfect for someone who is so adorable!” chuckles Dean.
“Why?” he asks, and raises his head to look at Cas for the first time, he found out about his secret. He’s very pale and terrified, like he just was caught on some dirty deed.
They're teasing with each other for the rest of the time on the car trace. Later, they play a few games, and Dean even wins a teddy bear for Cas.
“Mornin' sunshine,” greets him Dean. Cas has his head on his chest. He doesn't remember when Dean came to his room. He pulls away fast, looking at him, apologizing.
“I'm gonna wash your hair now. Is it okay?” asks Dean, putting a sponge away. Cas nods, so Dean starts his job. He takes a shampoo and uses its cap to wet Cas' hair. He's massaging his head, and Cas closes his eyes for the moment. It feels nice, he has never experienced something like that before.
He also uses one of Sam's hair conditioner, on purpose because the bottles are totally different that you can't mistake it for shampoo.
Dean finds his brother in Kelly’s room. The woman is dead already, her body is lying at the bed in the same position she was left. She has closed eyes, and only blood indicates what happened here. Sam is staring at her with clenched fists. Everything is so wrong, it shouldn't be like this.
“What? No, it's impossible, he almost never leaves my side, it's even hard to go pee alone,” Dean chuckles.
Shivers. And it's not because of a broken heater in the bunker, he's just missing something... someone. Without warm, his heart freezes, and how long it can beat in that condition?
“Breathe,” repeats Dean, and Cas tries to focus on breathing. After a few minutes, he calms down completely. “Okay, good. I stay with you how long you need.”
Cas walks to Dean from behind and slowly puts his hands around his waist. He rests his cheek on Dean’s back. Dean freezes and stops peeling the vegetables.
“Your soul isn’t black. Actually, you have the brightest soul I’ve ever seen,” mentions Cas, and it makes Dean has this weird feelings in his chest again, but he says nothing. There’s no anything you can say after your best friends told you something like that.
Cas changed Jack's diaper, read him a story which a baby couldn't understand, and put him in the cradle where he could sleep. An hour later, he looked out the window and saw that Impala was still there. It was almost evening, and it was a long day for all of them. Cas went outside and knocked in the car's window. Dean opened a door, but didn't say anything.
Dean gulps, wondering what he should to say. It's obvious he won't mention a kiss, but he needs to say anything. He clears his throat and speaks nervously.
When they pull away, breathing hard, Cas stares at him confused. And the first thing, he can think about is a question...
“Dean, I don’t wanna hear any more of your stupid notes,” says Sam, not even looking at his brother. He’s focused only on the baby.
“Since forever? Since I pulled you out from Hell, touching your soul... But I didn't know that then, I think, I realized this when I was a human.”
Dean knows only one way to shut him up. He grabs Cas' tie, and the angel tilts his head like he's waiting for a punch. But Dean's fist stays still, and his lips do the opposite. He kisses Cas for the first time in his life, and it works. Cas shuts the fuck up.
“Oh, nothing? And you just left because of nothing?” The sarcasm in Dean’s voice pisses Cas off even more than the situation in the bar.
“You mean… It was you all the time?” Dean's heart skips a beat. What is it supposed to mean for them, actually? “Cas… I…”
Dean’s heart is pounding like a jackhammer, he has no idea what he’s going to say. He doesn’t have a speech, and even if he had one, nothing could be a such beautiful like Cas’ words.
“I think we should stop doing this. I mean, the hugs,” starts Dean slowly. They’re sitting in his room for a while, and they need to have this conversation.
Sam shifts in his seat and huffs. Dean wants to say something, of course, but it’s not going to be easy to get information. Sam doesn’t want to push him too much.
He smiles to himself, it's a good thing. Loving Dean is a wonderful feeling, and the thought that one day he could say to him, the perfect man alive, that he, the fallen angel, fell in love with him is even better because Dean deserves to be loved.
Sam finishes feeding Jack, and the kid is slowly falling asleep in his arms. Dean opens his first bottle of beer in this evening, throwing a cap on the map table and taking a long sip after that. Sam gives him a worried look, but says nothing.
“Are you okay, buddy?” he whispers, and Jack clenches his little fist on Dean’s fabric, closing his eyes. Dean holds breath for the moment because of this action, but after a second he exhales. It’s just a baby. A baby who needs some attention and closeness of another human. And he can do this. Jesus, he’s Dean
Dean turns his head around and looks at the cot, gulping and breathing fast. He doesn’t make a move, being afraid of what he could see.
“What do you mean?” Sam looked at his brother and frowned eyebrows. He had no idea, what was going on.
“Risk what?” asked Dean, not understanding anything. From his perspective it wasn't any risk, Cas and Jack will be safe in the bunker, that's all, simple fact.
They pull back, smiling to each other and staring into their eyes. Blue and green. Colors of their love.
Dean doesn't know what he's thinking about it. Why is Cas dreaming about kissing him? And how is it possible that it makes him happy? Dean freaking Winchester is a doomsday machine which destroys everything and everyone. He is broken, and he doesn't deserve for anything and now, he just found out that a perfect celestial being loves him.
“Dean, I said to Sam… I said to him that I…” He can't finish the sentence because of the knot in his throat.
Dean lays his hand on Cas shoulder, rubbing little circles with his thumb. He swallows nervously because he has something more to say. Something, which still scares him.
“You can go back to sleep, after you put me on the Earth,” he tries again, but the Empty doesn’t seem to be convinced.
“You must be hungry, I'll bring you something,” offers Dean, and walks away. Sam stays with him, he's frowning like he's worried. Cas doesn't say anything. His throat is too painful, and actually, he has no idea what he could say. That he screwed up one more time? That he failed?
“I know.” Fake-Dean kisses him on the forehead. “I go to the garage to care the Baby, and later we can watch the movie.”
“Dean, hug,” Cas commands three days later. They’re in the bunker’s garage, back from one of the case. Dean just closes a trunk.
“Cas… Stop, please,” asks Dean and closes his eyes. He’s resting his head on Cas’ thighs, and Cas is running his fingers through his hair. They’re spending a lazy afternoon, the same way they spent the last two weeks.
“You’re right…” Jack gets up and walks to Cas to give him a hug. Dean smiles a little at that view, but he takes a sip of his beer to cover it, immediately.
“Did you mean it?” asks Dean, finally. He knows they would have this conversation sooner, or later. And maybe sooner is better option. Cas came back only a few hours ago, and for the first time he is alone with Dean. “What you said before the Empty took you?”
Dean turns around and walks to his drawer slowly. He needs some clothes for changing, he takes a pajama pants with burgers and a long-sleeve shirt.
“It's, you know...” he begins, and not finish a thought again. Cas frowns, but a moment later he realizes what he means.
In the park they met some lady who gives him an advertisement. Normally, Dean would throw this at once, but this time he reads it. It's an invitation to the prom. Of course, there must be some prom! It can be Dean's chance to make things right. He clears his throat.
Dean didn't answer, but he didn't have to because Sam saw valentine's card in his hand. He understood everything, probably before his brother. Cas was in love. With one human.
Cas nods, but says nothing, and it hurts Dean even more. He would prefer if Cas frowned his brows and maybe even was angry at him. The silence isn’t a good sign.
He forgot about tattoo for a moment, that’s why he didn’t prepare Cas for this, but Cas probably doesn’t see this as a cringy thing he did when he was drunk. They’ll be fine, like always.
He's not a child! Actually, he never was, and he doesn't care what Sam is thinking about a solo hunting trip. Dean starts an engine, and drives away. Riding always calms him down, he puts some Zeppelin’s tape on the deck and turns the volume up. It starts from
“Mary, that’s not my fault. It just… This friggin angel…” he starts, and Dean knows he must interfere with discussion.
“Come back home. The bunker is a safer place,” Dean repeated. So, it was the real reason. Dean wanted… needed Cas back.
what did he think about him because of that? Good that he's just the fake version, he couldn't handle it if
It's a middle of the night, Mary wakes up and walks to the kitchen to drink some water. The lights are already on because Castiel sits at the table and contemplates in silence.
Dean takes off Jack's diaper, and before he has time to react, baby starts peeing on him. His flannel is wet a second later. Great! Jack seems not to care what he just did, he casually puts his fist in his mouth.
“Yeah, you didn’t raise me at all!” he yells and every bad memory with John comes back to him. “Sorry, mom, but I have to go. Bye, Sammy!”
“I ain’t exactly a role model,” says Dean, and grins. Cas tilts his head, and looks at him with a whole love and compassion to his person.
Dean loosens his grip, and that’s a sign they should to stop doing this, so Cas takes a step back. It’s still not enough, the longing is even worse now.
“Cas… Can I invite you for an apple pie?” Maybe it's stupid and naive, but he needs to try because maybe this life has something in common with romcom.
Cas took some book from a bookshelf in his room. He opened it and showed Dean what was hidden inside. There were dried flowers from earlier bouquets. One flower for each one.
It’s his third bottle, when Sam comes to the room. Dean has his legs on the map table, trying to relax.
Every sentence is louder than the previous one, and Sam is just thinking that it's a matter of time before Jack wakes up.
In Purgatory, he has only one thought: to keep Dean safe. He’s running, ignoring prayers, but hearing every word so loudly. Sometimes he wants to turn the angel radio off, but he doesn’t do this, he needs to know if Dean is okay… And to be honest, these prayers make that he doesn’t give up.
“Don't thank me. I didn't bring oranges,” says Bobby, Dean laughs and relaxes a little bit. “And actually, I think I will need your help with rugaru. I called to John that you'll stay at my place a few weeks.”
Dean has lots of things in his room: family pictures, guns, a lamp and more others. One of them is an old typewriter which has always been there, so he just left it himself. For the beginning he doesn’t use it, treating it as a piece of decor, but one day, maybe he drank too much beer, he sits at the table and starts typing. It’s just random words like some swears, his favorite things (pie!) or names (Dean, Sam, Mary, Cas…).
Next day, Cas seems to be normal. He's acting like usually, but Sam pays attention to him and Dean. He needs to be sure if he's right.
“Really?” Cas seems to be surprised, but he's also delighted. It doesn't take much to make him happy. “So, I'll make you coffee tomorrow.”
“It's tradition!” says Dean in a menacing tone. Every Sunday they're having family barbecue. They're meeting together in his parents' house.
Cas nods, he understands why he didn’t know about it earlier. Dean started playing guitar when he was gone…
They're kissing again, but Cas doesn't pull away at once. First, he wants to mark Dean's neck as his territory, so he sucks his skin aggressively.
“Hello, Dean,” mumbles Cas, and his face expresses a concern and worry, like he isn't sure if he's welcomed here.
“You don't eat again, Castiel... You don't like our cuisine?” asks John reproachfully. Cas stares at him with frowning eyebrows.
“Okay, maybe. And what? Does it change anything?” asks Dean, taking a long sip. He seems to be pissed.
When three days later, Cas is standing at the bunker's door, he's exhausted, and the only thing he can think about right now is sleep. He could do anything just for a few hours of rest.
“Somebody has to. Look, I need to go. But say “hi” to girls. Bye!” he hangs up before Jody can say ‘goodbye’ to him.
Cas does it on purpose. Of course, he does! He loves wearing Dean's baggy t-shirts, but he misses his old outfit. That's why he dresses jeans and white shirt, but he remembers to unbutton it a little.
He pulls away so fast, that Dean isn’t sure if it really happened. Did Cas just hug him with some kind of tenderness?
He stands over the crib, looking at Jack. He is almost two weeks old, and Dean has to say that he changed a lot. He isn't so red and wrinkled now. But he is still very little and vulnerable. How is it possible that the devil child reminded him of little Sammy? Why is Jack so similar to the human baby? It would be easier if he had some horns or other diabolic shit. But he has to look so normal, only to make Dean feels guilty.
“Like I said, it was perfect. It's gonna suit to my collection,” he explained. “And, Dean, I won't forget about you either. Never.”
Cas is sitting in the kitchen. Alone. He tried to go to sleep, but after two hours he just gave up. He doesn't want to bother Dean again, that's why he decides to wait for the morning here. He knows as a human he should sleep every day, but it's not so easy, not when he risks having nightmares.
No, it wasn't. But Cas knew it wasn't all the truth, not really. He would've been delighted if Dean was worried about him, but he didn't expect that. It's not like he was so important that anybody could care about him. And there was also Jack, they hated him only because he was Lucifer's son, but for Cas, he was his kid, and he would do everything to protect him. Anyway, Dean didn't drive six hours from Lebanon just to "check on him". Maybe something bad happened? Maybe Sam is hurt? And Cas can heal him?
“What are you doing?” asks Sam, walking into Dean’s room. His brother is sitting on the floor, putting the baby cot together. The second baby cot because one of them is in Sam’s room already.
“My usually choices are as good as Freddie. And by the way, I didn't know you can appreciate a real music,” he teases.
“Oh, hello! My devastatingly handsome friend was wondering…” Dean says one of his stupid notes. Cas wasn’t a baby, he could speak for himself.
“Can you do this again?” he asked, and he didn't need to tell this twice. The next kiss was even more passionate. Dean's lips found his immediately. They were kissing for a long time, and after they pulled away, they were still close to each other.
When she goes away, he takes two cans of milk formula and moves the trolley to the other alley. There’s a lot of baby stuff like cots, diapers, bottles, pacifiers and clothes. He takes a three-pack of bodysuits because he noticed earlier that day Jack is definitely bigger now, and Sam has shitty taste in clothes, better if he chooses something.
Dean is walking around the room until he's sure that Jack fell asleep. He puts him on the cradle and goes away, thinking about something stronger to drink. A beer isn't enough, not after all of this.
Dean shrugs his arms and turns the page. Now they’re looking at the perfect garden with a perfect grass and a perfect bench.
“Oh, great! So, you're besties now? I thought we tell everything each other… I assume I was wrong,” snorts Dean.
Later he also grabs honey in bear-shaped bottle, dude deserves for some sweet after all! He has been through a lot...
The lady didn't believe him, but she smiled anyway and started talking. She talked a lot, like she missed for company. When Dean walked away, he knew that she sold flowers for years, earlier her wife had helped her; he knew she had an old cat; he knew meds were expensive; and he knew that her names was Jude.
Dean met Cas' eyes, the angel was staring at him with a shy smile, but after Dean caught him doing it, he immediately came back to prepare a bottle. Ten minutes later it was ready, and when he wanted to take Jack back, Dean spoke again.
Cas stands and takes a deep breath. He's really anxiously, but he only clears his throat and makes a few steps closer to Dean.
Cas gives Jack a kiss on the forehead and Jack walks away. He looks at him as a loving parent always looks at their kid.
On Dean's face appeared a real terror. He opened his mouth to say something, but he changed his mind at the last moment. Instead, he turned back and left the house. Cas didn't stop him, not this time.
And Cas really screams with pleasure. He also moans, gasps and makes so many other noises. And Dean does the same. Oh, of course John is staying at the door, and he hears everything.
Dean walks out from the bathroom, but he doesn't close the door. He stays near and waits till Cas isn't calling him. He comes back there, after he hears quietly 'Dean?'. Cas is in the bath already. There's enough foam to hide his intimate areas, not that he cares about it, but he knows it would make Dean uncomfortable to see him naked.
“What?” asks confused Cas, but before he says something more, Dean stands, knocking over the chair. He doesn’t even bother to lift it.
“No. It's not going to happen. I won't leave my coat here.” Cas could do a lot to escape this place, but coat must stay with him.
And maybe next time he’s still unsure, hearing another compliment from Cas’ mouth, but one day he just gets used to. Because he deserves it.
Dean doesn't wait for response, he turns around and goes to his room for his bag. Without any word of goodbye, he walks straight into the garage.
“Good night, Dean,” whispers Cas, and Dean opens his eyes. Cas face is so close to him, he feels his breath on his lips, he could kiss him right there… And he does. Just a simple peck because he couldn’t resist feeling Cas on every part of his face.
Sam looks surprised, but he answers, scratching his head: “Yeah, of course, a few times. I think Jess was my first true love. Why are you asking?”
“Dean, don't kick me out again, please... I don't have where to go,” he asks pleadingly and looks at Dean almost with tears on his eyes. These are more blue and brighter than usually.
“But you faced the consequences of your acts. You know, I was a warrior once. A soldier, who followed orders without any hesitation. I didn't make my own decisions, and I didn't think about consequences. But when I saved Dean from hell...”
“Thank you, Dean. And you… you look beautiful. The bow tie makes that your eyes are greener, like a grass at Saturday's morning…”
Dean makes only one day of break before he starts looking a case again. He needs to work to forget about everything. Unfortunately, he can't find anything interesting, so he enjoys his second favorite pastime - drinking.
“Dean, you're not obligated to do this. It was a nice thing, but it's not necessary. And I know, you were busy.”
Dean takes his cup of coffee to keep his hands busy and avoid more embarrassment. Cas is staring at him for a moment longer, but eventually, he just sits next to them. Dean sips his coffee, and Cas looks at Sam nervously like he tries to communicate with him without words. It has to work somehow because Cas turns his head to Dean again and clears his throat before he speaks.
Cas closed his eyes with trust. Dean laid hands on the angel's face. He felt soft skin structure under his fingers. He touched Cas few times before, but it was different right now.
“I think we should kill ourselves, right now,” he says calmly, and he doesn't wait for anything anymore, instead he stabs a knife into his chest. He needs to come back, even if he doesn't want to.
It has been two weeks since Cas is gone. Two weeks! But to Dean it feels like ages. Ages full of pain, sadness and self-destructive thoughts.
He can hear Cas' steps, and a few seconds later the door is open. Cas has messy hair, more than usually, was he lying in bed for the last couple of hours?
Dean leans to the tattoo and kisses it, it’s just an instinct, he doesn’t even know why he’s doing it. He feels how Cas is tense.
They’re looking at the menu, but Cas can’t focus, he glances at Dean all the time. Actually, it’s nothing new for him, he does it even in the real world.
“Okay, as you wish,” says Dean eventually, it’s weird that he gives up so fast. When Cas relaxes a little bit, he grabs his shirt quickly and pulls it up.
“I mean to someone, who you love,” he explained. This got even more awkward, why Cas couldn’t just read a little about some humans’ tradition?
Dean can't believe in his happiness, and he thinks he has to thank Sam for this. Maybe he'll even buy for him some veggie bacon?
He had sex only once in his life. With April, who kills him after that like she was some mantis. Cas was human then, and he did it because he was curious, but he never did it again because he doesn't need it.
“Nah, coffee can wait,” he murmurs and kisses him softly. “And I, on the other hand, I've waited too damn long already.”
That is the point of this conversation. Probably Sammy called her after he drove away. Fantastic! And what should he say to her? That he has no idea if any ‘okay’ is still possible for him?
There is silence for the moment, and then Dean hears some smacking noises. What the hell is going on there? He takes a risk and cranes his neck.
Cas looks at Dean who is cleaning a gun, and he swallows nervously. He isn't sure if a hunter will be glad of this. Cas has a male vessel, and he has never seen that some guy kissed Dean before.
“I can't. It would destroy our friendship, and maybe it's selfish, but I don't have anyone more… I don't wanna lose my family,” he whispers.
“I…” starts Cas, and it looks like he wanted to say, that he don’t eat, but of course, Dean reminds to himself that he’s not angel here. He says instead: “Yes.”
“We were together almost forty years. We were married only for a short moment, she passed away two months after our wedding. But I'm glad that we could finally do this, even if we were old then...” said Jude, showing him pictures of her and her wife. They looked so happy there, Dean knew he won’t ever have something like this, an apple pie life wasn’t for hunters.
“No, no, it wasn’t. I just… I didn’t know that in your perfect world with a perfect home, you would still want me by your side…” That’s the moment when Cas looks at him, finding his green eyes.
It has been two weeks since Cas appeared in the bunker. Everything seems to be perfect, his wounds are almost healed, he started eating normal food, and Dean taught him how to do laundry or pancakes.
Cas’ expressions is changing all the time. First, he’s smiling, but later he’s frowning and tilting his head. Dean is too focused on guitar to notice this.
“Oh, it's not me. It's Sam, actually. You know, after you were gone, I wasn't a nice guy… It was tough for the beginning,” he tries to explain himself, but it doesn't sound good. Jack is an innocent baby, and he is an adult, he should've been a responsible one.
Dean likes sitting with Cas and drinking beer, when the angel tells him stories about all that places he visited. He's always talking with passion and sparkles in his eyes. Dean could listen to him forever.
“I'll buy you this damn cup, and it's gonna be better than the old one. You're gonna be grateful that I broke the other one...” he murmurs angrily, stopping by the section with dishes. There's a lot of colorful cups, but he's looking for something special. But his eyes catch the blue one with a bee with cowboy hat.
“For Dean,” repeats John after him and clinks his bottle about Cas' one. They're drinking the rest without any words.
Dean covers the body with a sheet, which he found in one of the cabinets, and goes upstairs looking for Sam. They need to handle with the evil child first, then he’ll come back to Cas. And he’ll do what he has to…
Dean plans to kiss him hard, but when their lips connect, it becomes something soft and gently, full of affection.
Dean is mad, and Cas can feel it. He really wants to convince him that it's no big deal, but whatever he says, Dean turns it in a bad thing.
“You don't understand. Left shoulder. It must be the left shoulder, not the right one.” Dean starts cutting vegetables again, meanwhile he continues his thought. “It's… Okay, now that stupid part, it's the same arm where Cas left a handprint.” His voice is trembling when be speaks the angel's name. They didn't talk about Cas after they burnt his body.
After all of them greeted him, Dean excuses Sam and Eileen, grabs Cas arm gently and pulls him a little.
He kisses Cas' cheek slowly again. And again. And again. Meanwhile, Cas is closing his eyes. Dean kisses also his forehead, twice. And then his eyelids. And the tip of his nose. He is kissing all of Cas' face. The angel is very pleased, he has so adorable silly smile on his face, and Dean can't resist to kiss his pinky lips either. First, he touches Cas' cheek, rubbing his skin with a thumb gently, and later he just does it. He doesn't want to scare him, so the kiss is short and innocent. Cas opens his eyes, looking into the green one.
Cas didn’t look at him, and he didn’t answer, just started playing with one of his sleeve. He was really upset about the earlier situation, and also scared that Dean could be mad at him. He hadn’t words for that, so he chose silence.
“W-what?” Dean didn’t expect hearing something like that. And why would Jack say it in the first place? Did Cas tell him something? Or maybe it’s just a kid’s imagination. “Jack, what are you talking about?”
Dean isn’t the biggest fan of walking, but he can do this if it keeps them close longer. He has no idea how much time he has. And what is happening with his body in the real world, right now. Is Aphrodite like a djinn? Is she feeding on him? No, probably not because Charlie and Cas killed her. Now, he just needs to be focused and escapes from this romcom.
“Thank you for everything, Cas… Forgive me,” whispers Dean, and comes closer to the pyre. He lights the torch and throws this. One minute later the black smoke floats up to the sky.
When Cas was a human, he didn't have grace, and he still had the same impact on him. Or maybe even stronger.
“Okay. I think it's a good idea. If you want, I can take care of him more often. You're still doing most of the job, you're the great father by the way, so I can unburden you a little.”
They’re walking through bunker’s corridor, Sam opens a door to his room, but he doesn’t step into it, giving Cas some space. But Cas hesitates, he doesn’t take another step, wondering if he should. Dean puts his hand on his back gently, and pushes him a little.
Dean pulls away, just a little, to see Cas face. He cups it with his hands and whispers before he kisses him again.
He raises his head, hearing some steps. Dean is sneaking into the kitchen to drink water. It’s still middle of the night, so it means that Dean doesn’t sleep well again.
Dean isn't happy like that often because almost all the time they need to fight with some Big Bad Wolf. Only sometimes, for example on the days when they’re watching some old western, Dean is relaxed and cheerful.
It's Friday night. Cas lied to John that Dean had invited him to dinner. It's almost six o'clock, so the older Winchester should to be here soon.
But he won't. Because on the next day, Mary Winchester is dead. And Castiel is dead too. Dead in Dean's eyes.
“You're not straight,” Sam says, he doesn't need any confirmation, but Dean nods anyway, still not looking at his brother.
Cas doesn't wait for anything, he just turns around and goes away. Sam is still standing outside, and he's thinking about their conversation. It's so obvious now, how has he never noticed this before? Cas always stared deeply into Dean's eyes, he had a problem with personal space only in Dean's case. And of course, he did everything for him. He gave everything to him…
“Sure, Cas.” He moves a little and makes a place on the one side of the bed. Cas slides in under the sheets, and Deans turns the lights off. They're lying in bed, staring at each other. “How are you feeling, Cas?”
“Hello, Dean,” he croaks before his legs refuse to carry him any longer. If Dean didn't catch him, he would’ve landed on his knees on the floor. Maybe it would've been better? He could've slept on that floor, it looks even comfy.
Cas gives him a little smile, and Dean breathes with relief. They’re okay again, and everything is going to be normal like always.
“I… No, he wasn't,” he admits, but he’s still not convinced. Sam just nods, he realizes that Dean need time.
“Dean, can you… can you stay with me until I'm not going to sleep? I don't want to be alone,” he begs him.
Dean takes one of the papers, this one which is on top. He gives it to Cas, and next he sits next to him.
Cas puts his hand on Dean's shoulder, and he's trying to catch his eyes, but Dean just nods and moves to the car immediately. Castiel sits on the back seats.
Dean gives him an opened bottle of water. He takes a swig, and it burns his throat, the fresh wound on his neck is in the bad condition, he doesn't heal so fast anymore.
It can't be true. He has to have in mind he loves him like a brother. That's why Sammy said before that Cas is a family. But he needs to ask anyway.
“Maybe this time, but you’re looking at him with this… this hatred…” she explains. Meanwhile, guests run away, leaving Winchester’s family alone.
“I know I'm a crappy hunter, and that situation with a woman… I didn't want to upset you, and now you're angry at me…” explains Cas. His voice is calmly and quietly, but Dean hears also something like… sadness?
He starts urinating. Unfortunately he pees on the toilet seat, he definitely needs to make more practice. Dean zips his pants and cleans hand, not even realizing that he's smiling all the time.
Cas chooses a photo of sleeping Jack with his plushie bee, and also the one where Dean's holding him, sitting at the armchair. He sends it to himself, and turns to Dean his phone.
And he'll destroy this like always. He couldn't do things right. Cas loves him, but Dean doesn't deserve for it.
The Shadow doesn’t want to stop, even when he begged them. So, eventually, he stopped, he knows it doesn’t help him, and the Shadow will be even more satisfied, seeing his misfortune.
Wings are huge, but also broken and devastated, these don't look like the other day in the barn where they met. He should have asked Cas if everything was right after he got his grace back, but of course, he didn't do this properly; he was too busy with his own affairs. Dean knows it will haunt his dreams forever, he deserves that. He deserves for every nightmare because he didn't protect him.
Jack tilts his head and looks at him with his big eyes. Dean gulps, feeling uncomfortable, the kid can be scary if he wants.
“Nothing. Just… it’s like in the movies. We should start making out till now.” After the last word escaped his mouth, he realized what he said. His face turned red immediately, and he was trying to avoid Cas’ gaze. “I mean, not ‘we’. Just… It’s not the movie, right?”
“Hug you?” he repeats, surprised, and Cas nods to confirm his words. Dean clears his throat, but gets up from the chair, eventually. “Yeah, sure… no problem.”
“Yes, Sammy, but you, on the other hand, has some problem with ears. I'm not gonna talking with you about the son of Satan.”
Dean sits Cas down on the bed in the motel room, which they booked for a few nights, and ignores his pleas. Dude must be delirious, maybe because of blood loss.
“I have family already,” points Dean. “I have Sam and Mom. And Jack, he’s like a son to me, you know?”
“It would be nice. Can we watch something what is not a western?” asks Cas. And Dean jumps, hearing his voice. He found him!
He takes down yellow curtains and rips them to wrap the body. It isn't even truly Cas, just a vessel and that thought hits Dean in the heart. Jimmy Novak has gone to the Heaven years ago, but where do angels go after they die? Cas has never told him, maybe he didn't know either?
“Yeah, I know, dumbass. But it wasn't Donna,” gulps Dean nervously. Cas wraps his arms around Dean's neck and kisses him back.
“Good. You'll get used to. One day, you’re gonna be an amazing human being,” Dean chuckles and grins at him, but it doesn’t humor Cas, otherwise, it makes he feels even worse. Dean must notice it because he adds: “Hey, Cas, you’re gonna be okay, I promise.”
It’s a long minute, then another, before Jack calms down. He stops crying, breathing normally again. Maybe he believed in Dean’s words?
“Dean, how long will you stay?” he asked in the evening, when they were sipping a beer together. Jack was sleeping, and Dean had brought some wood earlier to make a fire in the stove. It was nice, warm and familial, just like home…
“Sure!” says Dean, smiling and coming close to him. Then he whispers: “You're gonna scream with pleasure…”
“Since forever? Since you pulled me out from hell. But I didn't know then. I realized it when you were gone, after leviathans...”
Cas reads the poem one time, and then another, and another… Dean waits, observing how Cas eyeballs are moving left to right time and again. Every second feels like an hour to him, but
Winchester, of course, he can comfort a baby and take care of it. He did more difficult things in the past.
They're staring at each other for a moment longer, Cas is still smiling, and Dean can't help to do the same.
They're not talking about Jody's request even once for a long week. Dean is acting normal like nothing happened, but Cas can't forget about his words. What is that supposed to mean?
“Okay, Sammy, I’m gonna go to the grocery to get supplies. Do you need something?” he asks. They’re low on food, he used last eggs to do the breakfast.
Cas sits next to him, but he gives him enough space. Dean takes guitar and clears his throat. He play ‘Simple Man’, and to Cas surprise, he also sings.
“Is it about dad? Look Dean, he's gone and you... you're here. You can do whatever you want. Whatever make you happy.”
“No, no, no, Dean! I’m an angel, I can heal myself…” shouts Cas, taking a one step back, he almost falls on the floor. Fortunately, Dean is grabbing him tightly.
“We didn't order this,” says Cas, looking at the pie and frowning. Dean wishes that Cas tilts his head in that adorable way too.
Dean hugs with his parents and brother, and then John notices a hickey on his neck: “What is that, son?”
“I think you should say something like ‘Hello, Dean’!” he tried to do Cas’ voice impression with hope that the angel is going to smile a little. But he didn’t, he was still serious and sad.
Sam frowns his eyebrows, confused even more than a few seconds ago. Dean with a Jack in his arms is a surprising view, and the fact that he wants to take care of a baby longer, giving him a time to take a shower, and also makes a breakfast, is something unexpected. What happened that Dean changed his attitude to their situation?
“We haven't checked Tunnel of Love yet... Can we go there now on the proper date?” asks Cas and gives him a hand. Dean takes it and squeezes.
“Let's go home,” says Dean, and Cas nods because it's the thing he wishes for the most. They're going to the car, and Dean can't stop looking at Cas. He's so lucky that it happened again. After he lost all hope, he has him back. He dreamt about it for weeks, and now his dream came true.
“You’re the most loving person I will ever know,” repeats Cas after he’s back from the Empty. He says it to Dean all the time because Dean needs to remember.
He hasn't seen him for two, the longest in his life, months. He made his choices when he decided to raise Kelly Kline's baby. For the first time he stopped being selfish, he didn't stay with Dean, he chose Jack. And now, Dean Winchester stood in front of him on the porch of his lake house.
Dean, came here to take him back. He wishes he could stay. Oh God, he wishes so badly about it, but he knows he can't. He stops staring at Dean, opens a drawer and pulls two knives out, he gives one to him.
Dean remembers about Cas' throat, so he decides to do pumpkin soup for a dinner. Cas is a little excited that he will be cooking for the first time. He follows every Dean's instruction, and he thinks he's not bad at this. He killed thousands of monster, he knows how to use a knife, and cutting the pumpkins is much pleasanter than cutting the enemy. Dean makes jokes all the time, and Cas, for the first time since he fell, laughs.
“And he's cool with that? It doesn't scare the shit out of him?” It's still just a baby, but maybe he has no idea it's something unusual.
“Cas, you were dead. You died for Jack. You died to protect him, and it's the greatest sacrifice a man… or an angel can make. You're here now, and that's important. So, how 'bout coming back to home, huh?”
They walk on the floor. Dean puts one of his hand on Cas' waist, and Cas wraps his arm around Dean's neck. They start dancing, and they're not bad at this. Dean could be a good dancer if he wanted.
He sees how Sam looks at him when he opens another beer, but he’s not going to admit that he has a problem with the alcohol. The hell, he hasn’t! He’s doing his job pretty well, so why he would name it as a “problem”? Dean prefers to call himself as a functional alcoholic. Yes, it seems fair.
Cas decides to order one more beer. He raises his hand, looking for a bartender. After ten minutes they decide to come back to the hotel. They go outside, and Cas looks at Impala. He can see some movement inside the car. Great, they're doing it on the parking.
Dean was just staring at Cas, thinking how much this little gesture meant to him, but in the next second, he caught Cas' lip in his own, and kissed him for the first time. He didn't need to wait a long time for a response, Cas hands found the back of his neck, and the angel was kissing him with passion.
“You're gonna leave me?” asks Dean, and Cas opens his mouth to say something, but nothing comes to his mind. He was sure Dean will be glad after he goes away. He wouldn't be a burden anymore.
Dean found Cas in the bunker’s kitchen. Angel have never eaten, so probably he thought he could hide there because that was the last place where Dean could arrive.
Crowley is dead, Mom is gone and Cas… He can't say this loud, he can't even think about this because when he admits that Cas is dead, it becomes real, and he isn’t ready for this. He will never be ready for this.
“Cas…” he gulps, feeling how his heart is pounding fast. He licks his lips and thinks how to say the truth. These blue eyes full of hope and affection looks so beautiful, and he came to crush this dream. Why is it so hard?
“So, what is your biggest regrets?” she asks, taking another sip. Castiel realizes that she doesn't talk with Mary often. He should to start doing this, and maybe this conversation is a good first step.
“Jeez, Cas, easy there... I didn't know it's so important to you.” Dean gets up from the floor and looks at Cas.
Every time, when Sam walks to the kitchen with a baby in his arms, Dean excuses at once and goes away, sometimes to his room, and other times to his car for a quick ride around the neighborhood. He doesn't care about a devil child, all responsibility rests with Sam who took that burden. That way is easier for Dean.
He starts walking because it's the only thing which left. He can feel somebody's presence, but sees nothing. At least, until a familiar face comes out of the dark.
“Dean, that’s not true…” he disagrees. “If I’m Icarus, you are my Sun. And Icarus couldn’t blame a Sun, so I won’t do this too. Maybe I lost my wings because I wanted to reach you, but I’ve never regretted this. I would do this again. Falling was worth it, to feel the warmth of your soul, even if it didn’t last long.”
“Dean...” whispers Cas, gulping. He looks a little surprised, but also soft and lovely. His eyes are full of something strange and new for Dean, he has never seen it's before in these two sapphires.
Cas looks stunning, even if he didn't do too much with his appearance. He's still wearing the trench coat, some things never changed.
“It will be over, Dean, do you understand? You and I… it will be over,” explains Sam, giving him the last chance.
He walks to the kitchen, takes a glass and pours some whiskey. He drinks it in the one gulp, feeling the burning of his throat. Dean wonders if he should to drink more, but he decides to put the bottle away. The best way is to go to the bed early. He does what he thinks.
Dean squats next to Cas and pecks him on the cheek, then he looks into his blue eyes. He grins, showing his teeth, Castiel tilts his head on left, smiling a little.
Dean walks away, patting Sam's shoulder. It's the only thing he can do then, gives a sign that everything will be fine, even when he doesn't believe it.
Cas' body looks so peaceful like he is just asleep. But angels don't sleep, and when they close their eyes, they never opens these again. Dean takes decreased breath, he feels chest tightness as if he is underwater. He's so terrified, but he can’t waste a time anymore, and Cas doesn't deserve for lying on the ground. Dean grips Cas tightly  and tosses him over his shoulder carefully. It is surprising that Cas is so heavy. His weird, dorky, little angel. He takes his body to the cabin, every step hurts like something awful, a sting on his heart.
In heaven, they don’t have to cook or bake because they can just think about something, and it appears.
They pull away, and Cas can't stop staring at Dean. He doesn't say anything, too much overwhelmed by all of this.
“Don't be mad? Charlie, you're like a sister to me, and I care about you very much, but the hell! I could die there! Did you even realize what…”
“Okay, little buddy,” he says, taking a baby from the cot for the first time. He holds his breath for the moment like he expects that something wrong to happen. But everything is right. He feels a warm little body against his own, and it is so properly. He can feel a life.
“No. Me,” starts Dean, and when Cas, eventually, gives him a confused look, he rolls his eyes. “Of course, that Jack did it.”
“You were talking about it earlier. Besides, you're sweet like honey, so it suits you.” Dean takes it and pins it to Cas' coat.
Dean is drowning. Not literally, but he feels like he's underwater. Another night, but the same dream. Lucifer. Cas. Angel blade. And shadow of the wings.
It's not what Cas expected, he looks at Dean, who's staring at the road and whispers words of comfort: “I'm so sorry, Dean.”
Cas is back. Jack brought him from the Empty, of course, he did! There’s a lot of hug from Sam, Eileen, and also from Dean. The last one is a little awkward, Cas is trying to avoid Dean’s gaze.
“Do what?” repeats Dean, cutting tomatoes to their dinner. He has an apron around his waist. “Cooking? You wanna recipe, or what?”
) bisexual witch, so more accurate is 'John Winchester is homophobic like the CW'. Actually, it's a big mess. Why is he so interested in somebody's else sexual life? It is kind of stupid, but it's John Winchester, so nobody is surprised.
He needs a light. A sunlight which could dance across his face, making him happy. But his sun is away, and he can just wait.
It has been four days since Dean appeared on the porch of the lake house. It was a wonderful time, but Cas started feeling anxious. How long was Dean going to stay? When will he leave him again? When will he crash his heart into a million pieces? He didn't want to get through this one more time, he needed to know what Dean was planning.
“Look, I don't know what they are teaching you about rescuing people from Hell at Angels Sunday school, but you changed some things in my appearance.”
He hugs him tighter, but it helps nothing. Where the hell is Sam? He's taking a bubble bath or what? Quick shower doesn't take so long! Dean gasps, he's a terrible brother, Sam just wants to have twenty minutes for himself, and he thinks about him like that… Okay, he needs to be focused and tries to calm baby down once again.
Dean drinks a lot. Every day, since Cas died, he drinks until he passes out. It's the easiest way to stop feeling all the pain. He took only a few sips of his beer, full six pack is still waiting for him in the fridge. But first he needs to calm down the baby, noise is unbearable.
He isn't sure if it's only his imagination, or Cas stand a little too close to him. He feels butterflies in his stomach.
“I'm sorry, Dean,” he apologizes. “Of course, I wanted to keep this to myself. I'm sorry you needed to hear that.”
“Dean…” Whatever he wanted to say, it didn't matter anymore. He forgot it anyway in the second Dean's lips met his. Cas didn't know if it was a good or a bad kiss, but for him, it was the perfect one. The perfect because Dean was kissing him.
“You can fuck me if you want, you know that, right?” Dean blurts out. And when he finishes the sentence, he realizes what he said actually.
“I love you too, Dean,” says Cas when they pull away. They're staring at their eyes and smiling. Dean thinks it's a bigger smile than in Djinn's world.
“I don't criticize yours life choices... And coffee with honey? It's one of the few things which makes my day a little more tolerable,” he shouts and furrows his eyebrows in irritation.
“Oh, I think you're right! It was definitely what I wanted to do.” Cas smiled at him and opened a drawer to take a knife, but Dean stopped him.
“Not exactly, we like him because... it's Cas, you know. But I'm talking about these side effects when you can't stop staring into his blue eyes... How else would it work? He's a weird dorky little guy, and you just wanna cuddle him and grab his chubby cheeks...” Dean grins, still watching Cas.
“I want… if it's not too problematic for you. I slept with April because I was a lost human then, and it was something new for me. It was very educational, but I didn't have any feelings to her. She was my only one sexual partner. I think, it was nice, but I would prefer to do this again with someone who has a bond with me,” explains Cas. He almost used word 'profound', but he bit his tongue.
“Shit!” shouts Sam when accidentally spills out some baby formula. “Okay, do you want me to call somebody?”
They’re hugging for a long time, definitely too long, but none of them wants to pull away. Cas is the one who stops when he thinks Dean could feel uncomfortable if they hug more.
“Okay, we should go. I promised to make a dinner tonight,” he says, and not waiting for anything else, walks away into the bunker.
“But they're not mine,” Cas gasps. Is it so hard to understand that this isn't about a cup, or honey? Cas just feels so lost. Everything he does is wrong, and now he finds out his coffee is wrong too. Cas is a shitty human, he knows that, Dean doesn't have to remind him about this all the time. “Whatever... I don't want coffee anyway. I'm going to my room, it's the last what left for me.”
Dean has no idea when it actually happened, but it's routine now. Every morning he wakes up at six o'clock, dresses up and walks to the kitchen to make some baby formula. He takes a bottle, powder milk and kettle, he checks a temperature of food with this silly gadget which Sam bought a few weeks ago. After that he's tiptoeing to Sam's room, he stopped closing the door, knowing that Dean is going to appear here. Jack always opens his eyes immediately when he put his foot on the floor. Dean takes him from the cradle and changes his diaper.  They go to the kitchen together, where he's feeding him. Because of this, Sam can sleep more, and he stopped looking like a zombie.
Cas is avoiding him all day. Dean isn't sure if he left his room for a minute, so he asks Sam to bring to Cas some breakfast. He explains that Cas must be tired because of Djinn.
“I'm here!” He hears Dean's voice from the kitchen. He comes storming there and exhales with relief. Dean is carrying Jack in his arms. He's got the sleeves rolled up, and on his left shoulder a terry nappy. There’s also the empty bottle on the worktop.
“About people, bad decisions, the biggest regrets...” he says, gasping. These aren't nice thoughts, but in the dark night they just comes to his mind. Mostly, he's trying to think about more pleasant things like his family. He thinks about Sam, Jack, Mary, and of course, about Dean. He appreciates every moment which he spends with him. Sometimes he just has Dean's image in his head. Green eyes, freckles, honest smiles when they're watching some movie...
Cas was staring at the bouquet in Dean's hand. Of course, he was staring, it wasn't like Dean brought flowers every day.
“About nephilim? We still don't know anything about Jack's powers, and I think it's important to find out how it exactly works. Books are in Enochian, so it takes a lot of time.”
“You know what is a problem?” he starts, raising his voice. “That I cared. I cared a lot, but now, I have no one to care about!”
Cas raises his beer and drinks it at once. Then he orders something stronger. Sam blinks a few times and clears his throat: “Cas, are you okay?”
“Okay, come here, you little bastard,” murmurs fake-Dean, and at the same time the real one frowns his eyebrows. It sounds like he was flirting with Cas!
Dean finds some excuse, and turns around to leave the kitchen. This is the moment when Cas can see another tear in his trousers. The big one, revealing his green boxers and curves of his ass. For a second, he wants to inform Dean about it, but eventually, he shrugs and doesn't say anything. It must be fashionable... And actually, it's a pretty nice view.
“But why are you avoiding me? Did you realize something about me? Did you remind something what I had done wrong?” he asks nervously, tilting his head on the left and making a few steps closer to Dean.
The next half an hour they spent not talking with themselves. Any of them was deep in their own thoughts. The silence was broken when Dean laughed.
He takes Jack on his arms and puts him in the baby bathtub, where he prepared water earlier. Jack babbles something when his body touches water.
“After your confession, I mean, your coming out… I didn’t expect that, but I’m okay with that. I’m not homophobic, I hope you know this… Charlie, she’s a lesbian, you know, right? And you know I don’t have a problem with this?”
They both are people, or maybe a human and angel, who doesn't fit well to this world. But they're trying and keep fighting all the time.
“It's nice of her,” he whispers. Dean wants to stand, but Cas grabs his wrist. He doesn't let him go away this time. “You said she sent kisses... It's a plural form.”
They’re coming back to the bunker after their last case, silence in the car is annoying, so Dean turns the radio on.
He eyes on Jack one more time with a sadness on his face. All of this is  a big mess, on one hand, he loves that kid, but on the other, he desires that everything would come back to times before Jack was born.
Dean grabs the photo and at the same moment the nurse is here again. He wants to shoot her, but the ghost is quicker. She takes him by the throat with one hand and pins him against the wall. He can’t catch a breath, and for the moment he thinks it’s over. He’s going to die here, alone in an abandoned hospital. The photography is still in his hand. Everything happens really fast, Dean acts out of the instinct. He pulls a lighter out from the pocket and with one click, he sets fire to the picture. Ghost screams one more time, but the grip isn’t so tight now. A nurse disappears into the flame.
“I missed you...” murmured Dean when they pull away. His hand found Cas waist, and he didn't want to let him go.
I hope you can read it... That wherever you are, it's not too late. I should've published it earlier, but I'm lazy ass. I'm sorry it took me so long... I'm sorry it took me till now to update this fic. Man, I hope you're gonna read it! Okay.
“It's good,” says Cas, but he feels a tension in the air. He knows something is wrong, but he can't guess what exactly. “Dean, is there something you're not telling me?”
“Hello, Earth to Sam... he's an angel, and he does this thing with his grace that everybody likes him... I mean, every human, it doesn't work on monsters, demons and others feathery douchebags...” he explains and rolls his eyes. Jeez, and Sam is the egghead? What is he reading in those old books?
“He was stupid, that’s all,” says Dean, but when he sees how Cas’ face changes, from intrigued to horrified, he’s realizing what he suggested. Not intentionally, of course. “Oh shit, Cas. I didn’t mean… I didn’t mean anything about you.”
“Acting? I'm not acting, Sammy! I just do my damn job. Somebody has to! And it's the end of the discussion. I'm coming, whether you like it or not.”
“Because it's warmer when you cuddle me.” He hopes that maybe Dean will stop being so cruel and hold him like every night before.
He kisses him softly, and it tastes different from the first time. And it has nothing to do with Cas' salty tears, but with the fact that they confessed true feelings to each other.
“You're a big little guy, now. You're not gonna pee on me again, right?” asks Dean, but Jack, of course, can't answer to that. He just puts his hand in his mouth, and smiles a little. Dean needs to wean him away off this, he grabs gently baby's wrist, and pulls a hand from his mouth. “Oh, I know that smile… You're definitely gonna pee on me.”
Dean doesn't run away every time he sees the kid in Sam's arm. Instead, he takes Jack sometimes from his brother unknowingly, just to hold him for a moment. Days pass very quickly, and Dean makes another steps. He starts feeding Jack also in the lunchtime, he's changing a diaper more often, and sometimes he just walks around the bunker with a kid on his arms. Jack is mostly calmly, and Dean realizes that he starts to care about him. That thought terrifies him, but it's too late to change it. Now, he needs to protect him no matter what.
Cas walks to the mirror and discovers, to his horror, that he is, indeed, blushing. His cheeks are a little pink, ears look the same. If Dean saw this?
“So what, you thought it would be a great idea? Trapping me in some shitty romcom? What was the point?” he asks, still not understanding anything of this.
Dean turns head around exactly at the moment when the ghost appears in front of him. It's her, still in the nurse's uniform. She starts screaming and all the papers are flying across the room, including a photo.
“Hello Mary. Hello Sam,” Cas greets when the door opens. He doesn't even look at John, just immediately goes to living room where are the rest of their friends: Eileen, Charlie, Jody, Donna, Bobby, Rufus…
John is pissed. Mary doesn't talk to him anymore because he still didn't apologize Castiel. He has enough.
Run for groceries could wait a few days more, but Dean needs a ride. So, he gets in the Impala and drives to the nearest supermarket. He's still mad at Cas, it wasn't his fault!
“We're sorting these by age rage. You can find some on the left.” She points at one shelf, Dean comes there and reads labels. “Anything else?”
They have small-talk again because why not? Nobody rushes him, they can do whatever they want, and Dean really appreciate that. Lucky them!
“I see… I'm in love with somebody, Sam,” admits Cas, looking at his feet. He doesn't know if it's a good idea, but he feels so devastated this night that he doesn't care anymore.
It isn’t a love at first sight. For the beginning Cas finds himself intrigued. He’s curious what Dean is going to do. Which decisions will he make? How will he face with the consequences? And the last, what does the Righteous Man have in his mind for real? So no, it’s not love. Not yet. But it’s the beginning of his falling.
Dean put the emergency button five times like it could speed up everything. Of course, nothing happened, so he did it a few more times. Cas gasped. Again. Dean smirked and started putting a button even harder, just to tease with Cas a little, but the angel didn’t react anymore to this. He stayed a very calm actually, and Dean was bored a minute later.
“All right, you can choose this time. But not Titanic!” Oh, yeah, he would say something like that. Actually, he likes Titanic, but he doesn't talk about this loud.
Dean walks into the kitchen where Sam is preparing a baby formula. The kid isn't here, probably he's taking a nap now. That’s good, he doesn’t feel like seeing him.
“I’m afraid that word 'love’ doesn’t exist in Enochian. Not that kind of love. We have adoration and admiration, but it’s not the same. Angels shouldn’t have fallen in love.”
“Can I have a forehead kiss too?” Dean jokes, after they’re alone in the kitchen. Cas squints his eyes a little confused, but eventually, nods enthusiastically and makes two steps closer.
John stands and starts walking to own home. Maybe it wasn't real apology, but he tried. Mary should to forgive him now.
“Dammit,” Dean murmurs. Good that kiddo didn't pee on his face, but still, it's annoying that it happened at all. Dean throws a shirt on the floor, it can wait for laundry, and comes back to Jack. “And what, you think you're funny?”
“I look like a shit,” says Dean, more to himself than Cas. They were on a hunting trip, and after killing three vampires, he feels exhausted. He just dreams about comfy bed in the bunker, but it needs to wait, this night he’s going to sleep on the motel room.
Dean grabs his arm, and guides him to his own room. Cas is surprised when they're passing his room, but he doesn't say anything because in his heart he feels a relief. He didn't want to bother Dean anymore, and he couldn't sleep, but being with Dean in the same bed is comfy and safe, so he knows he'll fall asleep soon.
“I know that, Dean. But your mistakes and your failures make you stronger, and you don’t need to be perfect. I love your every imperfection. It makes you human. And it makes you loving.”
It’s not that he needs a company, he is a hard-ass, and he can do this without any help. Of course, it would be nice to have somebody here, he even thought about calling to Sam, but it’s not necessary, right? At least he tries convincing himself that it’s truth.
It's just a casual morning, John is at the work, and Mary takes care of the children. Everything seems to be perfect because Winchester’s family is, indeed,
“Okay, I need a break…” says Dean and laughs. He's not tired, but he feels it's the place where they need to stop. It will happen right here, right now. Cas is smiling at him all the time, their eyes meet together… Immediately, they hear a music. Slow, beautiful and very romantic. Dean is looking for sound source. Some guy with a deerstalker on his head is staying by the one window of an old building and playing the violin.
Dean goes to the kitchen to talk with him. Cas is making a coffee, he takes a cup from the cabinet, and then he turns around, feeling somebody's eye on him. He sees Dean, so he smiles immediately.
“I wish you would be real…” whispers Dean. Cas frowns confused and opens his mouth like he would like to tell something, but before he does say any word, everything disappears, and they wake up.
“I’m not sure if it works like that…” Cas rolls his eyeballs and tries to kiss him, but Dean doesn’t finish this conversation yet, so he just gives him a little peck in the corner of his mouth.
Dean isn't sure what he's asking about. How long did he want to kiss him? Or how long does he love him?
Dean doesn't go to so fancy places usually, but he needs to admit everything looks perfect there. And the most perfect is Cas. He can't stop staring at him. They have a small-talk, meanwhile they're drinking champagne, and they just enjoy their company. Dean has no idea how it plays out, but he hopes they'll kiss at the end of this evening. And he catches himself that he doesn't want it because he wants to escape, at least not only because of that, but because he really wishes to kiss him.
