“Speak for yourself,” Suzy said as she stuck her tongue out. “Taste like one of those Harry Potter Jelly Beans that’s complete rubbish.”
“Obviously other than a mobile home I haven’t a home to give. Also, there’s the fact that probably all I’d find was a hovel and that wouldn’t even come remotely close to what we would need. As long as you’re not going to reject me or think less of me I’ll except the proposal.” Castiel leaned back in the booth. Finding a suitable bed for this home to present to his omega wouldn’t be an easy task. It could be, but he wasn’t going to be cheap or take the easy way out and present him with just a mattress and box spring paired with a simple head and foot board.
“John certainly keeps things colorful,” Dean chuckled. “John and Mary will be back in a couple days. And Charlie she’ll be here for Christmas- Bobby promised.” A wistful look settled on his face. He wanted to say something along the line of that SoB Crowley better make sure my pups are safe while visiting. He knew Charlie was safe with Bobby. He sighed.
“Absolutely! Gonna be the best ever.” Dean said as he reached out and grabbed the spices he needed. He looked toward the front of the grocery store, head tilted just enough to get a better whiff. He didn’t recognize the smell of fresh cut grass and hot earth when rain first hits it. It was a small town where everyone knew everyone, and a tourist was a rare thing.
Dean didn’t care about stopping the drink he was holding from spilling, he shielded his stomach. “Speed walking in the house only!” He hollered. “Someone could get hurt.
“We were teenagers trying to be adults. Trying to alpha and omega up before other people caught on.” Dean said softly. “Him claiming and marking me brought out the worst in his alpha. The smell of the pups in me made him think I’d been with another alpha.” He got quiet for a second before taking a deep breath to continue, “he’d claim and mark me over and over. We were to stubborn to give up on each other and what we’d set out to do. It about broke us. I don’t know who was more embarrassed when I had to call 911 and tell them I was knotted and my water had broke.”
Castiel watched as Dean stopped just short of coming in to his room. There was just enough space for a bed and dresser. No means of outside light. Off to the side a private bathroom where he felt he could shower and go to the bathroom at the same time. Small and efficient summed up the bed and bath space- janitors closet also came to mind. He didn’t mind the size, this was temporary. He dropped his bags on the bed, and before he could say anything he noticed Dean had slipped away.
Jack doubled over laughing. “No fair!” He tickled his sister back. Neither of them letting up until they couldn’t breathe and their sides ached from laughter.
After washing up and changing clothes he walked across the hall. “Dean,” he called out into the seemingly empty room as he knocked on the door frame. Getting no answer he entered cautiously. He’d been in a round about way invite in so he felt comfortable. Yet, he still felt insanely out of place because this was not his mate yet.
Castiel dropped the hose in time to grab Kenny’s shoulders and brace himself. “You want to talk about this like a beast!?” He snapped. He found himself being pushed into the side of the house. It worked in his favor as he wasn’t sloshing in the mud that was constantly being created. With everything in him he pushed him forward hard.
Before Dean could respond Keith shouted. “I big helper also. I help also!” Despite everyone laughing, he clapped proudly.
“Don’t be so hard on yourself.” Dean nuzzled into Catiel’s hair as he continued to work his shoulders and surrounding area. “This isn’t your typical household.” He placed a few kisses along his neck. “A gym does sound nice… or I could call in a few favors and we have some help in creating a natural obstacle course out back.”
“I wanna new brother or sister!” Kristina said with toddler confidence. Her eyes large as she pulled on her shirt.
“Certainly the bed for it,” Donatello laughed. “If you’re sure I’m not intruding I would really love to see your home. Especially once the bed is in place.” He motioned toward the furniture in the room, “there’s a matching chase and dresser with mirror if you’re interested.”
Dean rubbed his face against Castiel’s wrist, and inhaled deeply. He immensely enjoyed the smell of warm earth when rain first hit and fresh cut grass. “I love the way you smell. I could get drunk off it.” He mumbled as every bad feeling he felt melted away. He purred once more.
Kenny looked at his sisters. “I guess. But we don’t even know how it got on our phones. It was just there one day.”
Dean allowed himself to be pulled into Castiel’s lap. He did his best to reciprocate the nuzzling. After a few moments he relaxed and started to purr. “Yeah. Just tired.” He yawned seemingly on cue. “There’s so much to do…”
“He was too drunk to realize that you smelled as good as you did because you were so close to heat.”
Keith looked from John to Frank to Betty. “Okay.” He said his attention lost to the situation. He was more interested in having fun. “Spin me round again!” He giggled.
“I’m going to be a lawyer.” Nikki grinned. “Do what Uncle Sam decided not to do because he fell all in love.” She fake gagged. “Love is for-” she didn’t finish what she was saying because of everyone’s looks. “Well it is.” She pouted.
“Better then Betty who wants to join up for services.” Amelia half teased as she punched her on the shoulder. “What was that slogan again. Be all the alpha you can be.” She laughed until she snorted which had everyone laughing.
The voice may have been deeper with age but Dean knew it. He’d already moved between his pup and the man at the door. He refrained from hissing. But he couldn’t stop his demeanor from being defensive. “Go and find your twin and wait in the study.”
“We sure are.” Castiel pulled Dean flush against him, back to his chest. He nuzzled his face into the juncture of his neck and shoulder. “Hate to tell you this, but I didn’t have to do much convincing when I mentioned we’d get some actual alone time for courting.”
“Garth. We’re nothing but family here even if there’s a few new faces.” Garth smiled warmly as he shook Castiel’s hand. He sat down as he excitedly said, “it was me. I all but invited myself. When he called me up and said you had a pup who was interested in becoming an officer. Color me curious.” He gave an apologetic smile.
“I can assure you that you aren’t intruding. Please come by anytime. Doors open.” Dean motioned toward the front door.
“She found a new alpha and disowned us.” Nathan looked into Kenny’s eyes. “A lot of alphas when they take on new omegas don’t want anything to do the previous alphas pups. An alpha can force an omega to take care of his previous pups. Doesn’t mean the omega has to like it.” He was shaking a little. He was old enough to remember her leaving, and to her not wanting him.
“Yeah. We both don’t know how you do it. Especially now that you’ve doubled in numbers.” Sam signed as he spoke. He gave a long whistle.
“I guess.” Sam glanced down at his shoes. After several moments of semi comfortable silence he asked, “are you leaving town?”
Castiel stood up so quickly that he found himself tripping on his legs. He mentally cursed himself for his less than graceful start. Finally, finding his footing he chased after Dean.
Castiel growled as two of his advantages were taken from him. Speed alone wasn’t going to work. He’d have to be smart if he wanted to catch him. He didn’t know where Dean was leading them but he wanted them back toward the river. Water would slow him down just enough if he had to run in it.
“You should be getting ready for bed.” Twila said as she turned him back around and pointed toward his room.
Castiel took one of the blankets from the chase and climbed into bed next to Dean. He draped the blanket over them. “I was a bit presumptuous and put my stuff in here as well.”
“Arthur, Garth make sure you pack enough for the road,” Dean called out when he saw them sneaking toward the door. He was being held up from saying a proper good bye because Frank’s mom had cornered him.
Castiel rumbled in response to Dean’s purr. He was sure if they were closer, and he was scenting Dean himself their noises would be complimenting not only the situation but each other. He felt it a bit unfair that he couldn’t nuzzle into him, but didn’t say so- he didn’t advance either. He didn’t want this thin moment of perfection to snap and end. Despite the topics of conversation he was calm. “My second oldest was a friends with benefits… I hate to say it… mutual shared heat and rut mistake. She wanted an abortion but after a lengthy discussion she agreed to have the pup, but was adamant she wanted nothing to do with raising her.” He paused for a moment to think. “I believe that is 22 years, 3 relationships, and nine pups in a nut shell.”
Castiel distractedly took a sip of coffee. His focus was on the slight shift of Dean’s house robe. Better judgement told him there were boxers and a t-shirt under there, but the part of his brain that lived in the realm of fantasy supplied him with other thoughts. “I’m less than a day in under your roof and I’m impressed.”
The waitress along with three others came into the room carrying large, round trays heavy with food. They carefully went about setting up so that they could pass out the food accordingly. Hands went up when she said fish, then another set of hands for chicken, and then another for the steak. They did their best to make it easy for them.
“Yeah. So. Except for school they didn’t have responsibilities,” Kenny countered, putting emphasis on the word responsibilities.
“I know I’m eighteen years late accepting an invite to Thanksgiving dinner. I hope you’ll forgive me.”
They went slack together after chasing their release. Breathing heavily and refusing to move except to find some support against the nearest wall as they slumped to the floor in a heap.
“We’ll make a project of it later.” Dean smiled. “I can make some normal chocolate covered goodies as well for myself and the rest of the family.” He teased Frank by emphasizing the word normal.
Margaret laughed at her sister. “Remember that one box we got that had over five beans that was ear wax.”
* I’m really hoping I didn’t make a mistake and type someone’s name wrong again. Even though it’s in my notes that Betty and Frank are together- I keep wanting to swap her and her sister Amelia. Here’s hoping I didn’t do it.
“Is this one of those things that mom would be happy about?” Dawn asked as she rolled the tomato around in her hand as if inspecting it. “You know like brownie points for tying something new.”
Dean let out the last of the air he’d been holding in. He slowly climbed into the bed, and sat there for a minute. “I guess I should of guested that,” he mumbled. “Where else would you put the pups? The floor?” He laughed nervously.
“Afternoon Dean,” Arthur grinned. He took note of Castiel’s posture and instinctively took a step back. “Dinner smells amazing.”
Charlie wanted to scream yes the moment the offer had been proposed. Barely able to contain her excitement, she hoped from one foot to the other. She stopped bouncing as she watched as her mom headed to the kitchen. She frowned. She’s never been away from mom. While excited the idea was scary.
“They told us to turn down the music. Did a head count. Checked for alcohol.” The way Mary structured her sentences it was like she was going down a check list. She grinned as she glanced over at her twin John.
Castiel wrapped his arm around Deans waist. “Seems the idea of a group chat prior to today was a success.”
“You tease me about being a bad alpha… you should check yourself.” Kenny gave her a look that said takes a delinquent to know one. He then flicked water at her, and grinned. “You can make it up with some cuddles.”
“He thought you were basically a no condoms necessary lay- every alphas dream.” Castiel frowned. “Dean is it possible he was going into a rut? You said he smelled good.”
“I’m not used to this,” Dean said as he sat down to breakfast having already been made- bonus his plate was already fixed for him, “but I could.”
“He’s a rich business man. He’d go large. Probably order half the damn menu.” Charlie laughed so hard she snorted.
Kristina rubbed the sleep from her eyes. “We didn’t do nothing bad,” she said with the innocence of a four year old. “Promise… we just missed mommy and daddy.”
“Now I’ve got to live with not only the smells but the noises,” Kenny grumbled as he slumped down into the bath water. “My ego is bruised and I’m scarred for life.” He pulled his knees to his chest and hugged himself tight.
“What is it Uncle Bobby? I got a plate of turkey calling my name before my nerves hit and I’m on my knees.” Dean laughed as he ran his fingers through his hair.
Dean scooted a bit more toward Castiel. “You are more than welcome to come and visit. I give tours on occasion.” He laughed. “It’s just a bit fuller now than when you saw it in the magazines. Seventeen pups under one roof.”
Bobby caught the beer. “Thanks. I think we all might wanna be,” he motioned upstairs and then toward the direction of the Frank and his mom. “These family get togethers are always lively,” he laughed.
“I’m assuming you made it out of the party without being raped.” The last word that left Castiel’s lips was a whisper. It was a reality, a horrible truth that happened to a lot of omegas who weren’t careful. A firm alpha voice could break the firmest no.
“I suppose. But it’s never really that easy.” He grabbed ketchup for Frank who’s latest thing was putting it on everything. He forced himself not to crinkle his nose in disgust. “I’m still not half as good at computers like our old dad.”
“He’s a sweet pup,” Dean grinned. They’d picked up another bottle, but he appreciated it. “I encourage my pups from a young age to help out around the house. I’ll have no loafers.” He took a sip of his soda and tried to steal a sniff to see if he smelled just as good as yesterday. He had to work around the smell of soft drink but it was there- to his delight stronger. He wondered if maybe Castiel had skipped showering, or worked out a bit before he came. His purr became one of excitement, he had to tone it down a bit so that it could be kept between them.
Betty focused on her mom and dad. Under their scrutiny of all traces of confident was alpha gone. She may not of had the physical flattened ears and tucked tail, but she looked it. “It’s all a blur,” she said nervously. “After Uncle Sammy and Garth left Frank was going to head on home. We were kissing goodnight… I was watching him walk away… he was running and I was chasing… we were on the ground…”
“Live a little Miss Vanilla.” John laughed. “When you’re on your own there’s an entire house to work with.”
Castiel cleared his throat. “My x mate had three less than you and I can promise you she wasn’t loose.” He winced. Even if Dean had used his own mate this sounded awful to compare, and he knew it. Time for a different approach even if it sounded worse, and made him wince. “Did he make you feel full? Obviously he did. He bred you good… proofs upstairs.” He was going to be sick. This was his job now- to make him full, to bred him good.
“Yes. The height of the bed is the biggest give away. It’s just enough a mate’s ass would be angled just right. Also the head and foot board are a certain height and have certain dips that allow for easy grip for mating that takes place in bed.” He smirked. “If it was solely for sleeping you’d have four posters and curtains. But, this- you’d have to attach your curtains around the bed for privacy.”
Dean nodded with a grin. “This makes me feel better about what I wanted to suggest.” He wrapped his own arm around Castiel and snuggled close. The pups weren’t even close, but he wanted to keep this private. “No mater how I try and wrap my head around it. I just can’t. You and nine pups in a camper…”
“You make the worst alpha,” Charlie teased her brother Kenny as she lick spit her hand to flatten his cowlick. “If this was a date you’d be considered a ragamuffin.”
Dean shook his head. “I’m from Lawrence, Kansas.” He took hold of his glass of Coke and squeezed it so tight his knuckles turned white. Having to tell this story meant that he had to say aloud that his mate was dead. It had been a few years, but it still tore him up. He mentally told himself not to cry. “Parents died early. Brother and I got caught up in the system. It didn’t work out so well. So, we stepped it up and did what we could to prove we were adult enough to emancipate ourselves. I did most of the work. It was my senior year in high school and I got invited to a college party. I had way to much to drink and there was an alpha there that was smelling so good.” If it was possible he was squeezing that cup even tighter. “I was full on denial. And when I wasn’t… the other guy was dipping his cock into every omega he could and wanted nothing more to do with me.” He let the glass go only to squeeze it again. “My best friend could smell it on me. Rather than everything I’d worked for being smeared and be for not… we mated. I loved him, but learned to love him. We both always wanted a large family so we looked for a small town with a large house for cheap that we could fix up. My brother moved with us. The waitress, Eileen, that’s his mate.” He finally let go of the glass completely and rubbed the back of his hand over face to clear off the tears he knew had formed. “My mate got ill and passed away the same year Kristina was born.”
Kenny’s eyes narrowed as he looked directly into Castiel’s. Despite being out of strength and breath he continued to try and struggle. “You want to breed my mom. I can smell it.” Kenny huffed. “It disgusts me. A real alpha protects what he’s got.”
“You know what else is loose,” Dean huffed. “He never complained. But I’m sure he felt like he could fall in.” He was almost in tears. How had the conversation gotten to here? Why even? He hadn’t even been presented a bed and a renovated room. To late to take it back now.
Castiel and Dean entered the study to find their pups sprawled out. Heads leaned on shoulders, legs and arms draped haphazardly over one another. It was a bit hard to tell where one ended and another started. The room smelled of a mix of spice and earth and all things in between, but nothing smelled wrong or out of place. A feeling of comfort and warmth and home filled the room. They had laptops on their laps and were finishing up the last of their school lessons.
Dean grinned. “Just remember that if things don’t work out… that it’s alright. Pick yourselves up. Try something else. Not everyone succeeds on the first try. What’s important is that you’re happy and that you can provide for your pack.” He disentangled himself. “Alright everyone. Time to put your studies away and get to work.”
“I get it. I do. But, this has been my space for eighteen years. I would have much rather helped you remodel and it dragged put for months… but I get it. You wanted to present to me something you otherwise couldn’t.” When Dean felt himself start to cry he looked away. “I’ve birthed most of my pups in here and now I feel like it’s all gone.”
“I’d set us up in a suite or a hotel room. Who ever needed to would stay behind. The rest of us would go out and see the city. Sun up to sun down. No one complained. Everyone was happy.”
“As long as he adheres to the rules of this house Frank can stay here.” Dean gave Castiel a look before looking back at them. “You’re going to have enough on your plate without having to worry about housing. Especially if…” he shook his head. “I still can’t believe your mom.”
“It’s best not to jinx these types of things,” Dean grinned. He relaxed a little and returned to a pose that didn’t scream I’m pregnant.
“Busy work until the right one comes along. I’ve thought about applying to be a waitress in town.” Claire gave a shy smile. “I can’t imagine only having one or two pups. I want my hands full.”
Amelia sniffed the clothes tentatively. “It’s not awful.” She took a deeper sniff. “It would make a better candle scent though. Why again do we have to smell like this?”
“We can talk about that later,” Dean yawned. “For now… back to sleep,” he mumbled sleepily. He was normally up by now anyways, but having gotten up hours ago to beat the traffic, he needed a nap. He sat up for a moment so that he could fuss with the sheets and pillows. Once satisfied he laid back down and snuggled.
Dean shut the door to the study and looked from John to Mary. He sighed before sinking into a near by chair. He rubbed his temples. This wasn’t what he wanted to be doing on Thanksgiving.
“I’ve got all I need right in front of me and under this roof.” Castiel gave Dean a quick kiss and motioned for him to lead the way. While if he was mildly uncomfortable and the stain blatantly obvious, he refused to act as if he’d creamed his pants just ten minutes ago.
He pulls his hood up and walks closer, having half a mind to pinch himself to make sure he is really seeing this. Castiel slides into the passenger seat for the first time.
Now he’s even more nervous to give Castiel his. He hands him the gift anyway, avoiding his eyes. Cas feels the soft package, trying to determine what it is before he opens it. The first thing he sees when he takes the paper off is soft maroon yarn. He pulls it out to find a perfectly oversized sweater, exactly in the style he would like. “This is really nice Dean, thank you. I love it.” He says sincerely. He notices Mary nudge Dean.
Disclaimer: brief mention of homphobic language- this does not reflect my own views (obviously) it's just for the sake of the story.
“We should take things slow. Not because I don’t want this, because I do. I just don’t want to mess anything up.” Cas actually cringes at how he sounds- like a cliché romance movie.
Cas stands too. “I should probably head home as well.” They walk out of the front doors together, and Dean beckons Cas to the car as well.
Thank you all for reading and for all the kudos ! I've really been enjoying writing again :) Leave me some comments to fuel my fire. If any of you have your own fic you would like me to check out, let me know !
Two months almost to the day the boy was found, Sam comes bursting through the door of his brother’s house. “I have some good news.” His smile can’t be contained. “In a few weeks, I scheduled a CPS visit for you two.” Both Cas and Dean look confused.
Dean and Cas have been dating going on nine months now. They met in late August and became official sometime in November. It’s now the early days of June, summer seeming to pop up overnight. This particular day is a hot one, over ninety degrees and the two men decide to hit a local bar to hang out and cool off.
Castiel finds his way back downstairs, and meanders into the kitchen. “Mary, may I have a glass of water for Dean ?” He asks her politely.
“You know, he would have loved to be here and see you now, all grown up. I know he had a funny way of showing it, but he loved you boys so much.” Bobby fidgets, he’s not good at the whole ‘feelings’ thing.
They exchange numbers under the pretense of another meeting for the car. And if it gives each man a warm feeling in the pit of their stomachs, well, that’s nobody’s business but theirs.
Cas runs into the room two minutes before midnight, and scooches onto a small cot next to Dean. Dean hands him a glass of sparkling apple juice, and they make a toast to a new beginning.
This is just a job to Cas. Something he is quite literally forced to do. “He doesn’t actually give a crap about you, and if he does, it’s because Heaven told him to.” Dean’s ever-helpful internal monologue berates himself for being stupid enough to think that they had actually formed a real friendship.
“Mm, breakfast.” Dean says, unwrapping it with a grin that doesn’t quite reach his eyes. “Thank you, Cas.”
WOW. Who would have thought that FOUR YEARS later I'd be continuing this ? Certainly not me. But this piece was always one of my favorites that I've ever written, and so I decided to do my best to come back and finish it. This chapter is intense, so be aware that there are some dark themes coming. Don't be afraid to enjoy it though :)
Dean snorts “Excuse me ? We fight for the freedom of our country. We fight for the men next to us, we fight to last another day so that we’re that much closer to getting back to our own families. We don’t fight to kill, we fight for the right to life. For all those people that the Afghans killed in 9/11, in our country. Innocent people who didn’t deserve to die. Afghanistan waged war on us, not the other way around. America is the land of the free and the home of the brave, and I’ll be damned if it doesn’t stay that way.”
Dean learns a few new things about Castiel on their first official date- number one being he is terrible at mini golf. Despite this, they both have a great time, even if it takes longer than expected to get through the course. The second thing he learns is that Cas has not been out on a real date in almost four years. It’s been as long for Dean for a date with a man. He did go on a few dates with a woman named Lisa last year, but she ended up back with her ex for the sake of their kid together and that was the end of that. The third thing he learns surprises Dean- Cas is /funny./ He’s always been funny, to be fair, but when they’re in Dean’s garage he’s more reserved, it’s more of a quiet, ‘I’m not trying to be funny’ humor. But here, on the mini golf course, it seems like he is really letting loose and the more uninhibited side of him is appearing in front of Dean’s eyes.
“I’ll call you soon.” Dean tells him, after gathering himself for a moment after the unexpected sweet gesture. He watches to make sure Castiel gets in okay before he waves, then walks back to his vehicle. He’s opening the door when he hears footsteps behind him again. He’s startled to see his date behind him.  He can read the shyness on Cas’ face, so he takes some initiative and closes the distance between them.
Dean was on his way home from his mother’s house like any typical Sunday evening. Sunday dinners were a tradition created after his father passed three years ago of a heart attack- Dean and his brother’s way of keeping their mom from feeling too alone. He rounded the corner onto the long dusty road that would take him back to his place, when he realized too late that there was a car too close in front of his beloved Impala. The front end of his car bumped into the large, God-awful yellow one almost directly around the bend. Dean can now see that the car has its hazard lights flashing, and really, what an awful spot to break down. The car is positioned so close to the turn that it is almost impossible to see around the bushes. This has clearly created the predicament that Dean is now in. Although he slammed the brakes on, he was too late to avoid rear-ending the poor bastard. Luckily he hadn’t been going too fast, but he still worries for his Baby as he thrusts the car into park and exits the vehicle.
He speaks soothingly to him, not touching him again and sitting a safe distance away but still close enough to comfort him. He helps him stand up afterward and picks up the cans. As they walk out, Cas asks if he wants to talk about it.
“I’ll be fine. It was just an accident because of the snow.” Cas snuggles closer to Dean and tangles their legs together. “I’m planning on sticking around with you for a long time. Until we’re watching the sun set in our rocking chairs and can’t eat anything except oatmeal.”
That thought makes him think back to his rescue- he had been sleeping when he heard the footsteps upstairs. He hadn’t heard any in so long, and they startled him awake. There was more than one pair of footsteps. The sound of the locks on the door to the basement being busted made him cringe back into a corner of the dusty space. More footsteps sounded, on the stairs this time, and they seemed to echo around the mostly-empty room. A flashlight beam had swept along the length of the darkness, searching. Dean had remembered wanting to call out so badly, but being unable to find the courage or the voice. The moment he heard the voice, he knew that it was Sheriff Mills. Dean had crawled out of his meager hiding space and shown himself, much to the shock of Jodi and the other officers. They had carefully ushered him upstairs and outside, to wait for the ambulance. He remembers hearing all the phone calls and the police radios, all the shocked voices and pitying looks.
Cas leads Dean inside and makes him dinner. After they eat, they lay on the floor in Cas’ living room, and just talk. Dean tells Cas all about everything he’s missed these past months, and Cas tells Dean about missing
Mary makes everyone BLT sandwiches for lunch, and packs an extra one for Cas’ next break at the hospital. He can’t stay long, but he’s glad he came to see Dean. It’s been almost a week and a half since they’ve seen one another. It’s getting harder and harder to resist the temptation that Dean creates for him, and he thinks that maybe that’s why he hasn’t been here in so long.
“Thanks, it’s something Sam got me when we were kids. I never take it off.” He rests a palm on Cas’ thigh, Cas guesses to ground himself as he gets his wounds tended to. His hand is warm even through his jeans, and he wills himself not to squirm.
Unfortunately, the whole situation has given Castiel something to report to Heaven. He hates the feeling of betrayal that comes with every mention of Dean’s internal sexuality crisis during his guardianship meetings.
“Is that a problem?” Dean asks genuinely, suddenly worried. He hadn’t thought that it bothered Cas that they sometimes saw Dean’s old flame. He’d barely even call it that, it’s more like an old spark.
Up one night with the baby at 1am, Dean brings him into he and Castiel’s bedroom. Cas is sitting up waiting for him. “Cas, I..I want to keep him.” Dean confesses desperately. “I want this little boy.” His boyfriend gives him a sad smile. “I don’t know if that’s possible. In the future, we can adopt.” He tells him, his supposed-to-be-hopeful tone falling flat even in his own ears. He knows what Dean means, what he is feeling, because he’s feeling the same way. They both want /this/ little boy, not just any kid from an adoption agency. This little boy is special, a gift for them from some unknown being.
Cas and Sam silently agree to let Mary be the first to see Dean. The two men sit outside the room in a couple of chairs while she spends some time with her first-born child. About thirty minutes later, a group of people rounds the corner and heads straight for them. Sam obviously recognizes them, because he stands immediately. Castiel stands too, assuming that they are the members of Dean’s extended family he’s heard so much about.
As they begin the journey back to the car, Dean suddenly begins to feel increasingly nervous. His hand barely brushes against Cas’ every so often, and he so badly wants to take it, but he chickens out. He’s almost pissed at himself by the time they make it back to his place. Cas is climbing in his car and he still hasn’t made a move.
"It's too hard." Dean says, tears slipping out of his eyes. His shoulders shake as he cries into Cas' chest. His fingers clench into Cas' t-shirt, and then he can't stop crying.
He does wish that he had a normal job though, which is the first time that he’s had thoughts like that. He loves helping people, he really does, but he also wishes that had more time for a social life- specifically, more time with Dean.
"I already re-live them all the time... I think its what I need. To talk about it with someone from the outside, someone who wasn't involved in the situation." Dea takes a deep breath, already feeling slight relief.
Cas stays with Dean for about half an hour, and in that time he learns more about Dean than anyone else has bothered. He learns that Dean doesn’t like too many people in the room at once, he wants to keep his light off as much as possible, and that he’s hurting when he breathes
Maybe Dean isn’t, but Cas is so deathly afraid. If he loses Dean, he’s lost everything. He’s lost his future, his happiness…His heart clenches and his stomach lurches, bile climbing in his throat. He throws up in the bathroom, and the tears start to stream down his face. Dean
“That’s quite alright…just take me to Dean.” Mary leads him upstairs, to the last door on the left. He knocks on it “Dean ? It’s Dr. Novak, I came to see you.”
Sam wanted his brother back, but he also wanted his parents to pay attention to him too once in a while. He tried so hard to please them, but it never seemed enough because he wasn’t Dean.
“This…” Dean leans forward before he changes his mind. He presses their lips together softly, hesitantly. When Cas doesn’t pull away, he deepens the kiss slightly. Cas moves forward and wraps gentle arms around Dean’s waist. They both pull away for a moment, staying close enough to breathe each other’s air.
The officer gives Cas instructions on where Dean is being flown to. He’s going to be at a fancy military hospital in New York, in a few hours.
Castiel has been staring at his boyfriend’s face for over an hour now. He sits by his bedside, holding one of his hands gently. The beeping of the various monitors around them does nothing to drown out Cas’ thoughts. It’s odd, he thinks, that Dean looks peaceful right now. It’s been over 24 hours since the attack, but he has yet to wake up. The dark haired man tried to focus on the unharmed parts of his lover’s face, but the dark bruises kept drawing his sight.
Dean hasn’t spoken a word to Castiel in over a week, though Cas has appeared three more times since the night at the Roadhouse. The angel can’t understand how saying such a thing to the other man could have upset him- he had let him know that his feelings were okay, he did not berate him or spout some misinterpreted scripture like many others would be so inclined to do.
Cas’ heart drops. Dean doesn’t remember him….he doesn’t remember their first time, or their first I love you…he doesn’t remember all the nights they spent in Afghanistan together.
“Something reminded me of…of him.” He never mentions Alistair by name, but Cas always knows who he’s referring to.
Castiel really likes Sam, even if they’ve only been conversing for about an hour. He’s very different from Dean, but not in a bad way. They watch Dean cook for a few minutes, Castiel just as fascinated as he is every time. His boyfriend is making homemade pizza, even starting the dough from scratch. He tosses it in the air, catching it again with skill. He winks at Cas. Sam rolls his eyes, “Don’t let him fool you, Castiel, he’s done that hundreds of times.”
Dean fresh from a shower stood just outside his door. The hall, especially his door still reeked of possessive alpha. Knowing it was the smell of his son, and not Castiel made his stomach churn. He sprayed his door down with neutralizer until he sneezed. “I hope you’ve got a bed and remodel in the plans sooner rather than later,” he said when he heard Castiel’s door open.
“Yep! I’ve got two big helpers,” Dean grinned. He then tilted his head upward and sniffed. The scent was all over the place. He wondered if it was because he was looking for his pup or trying to scent out him- like he was. After a couple tries he finally got a strong enough lead to follow. He found himself pretty much back tracking his entire walk through the grocery store right back to the spice isle. When the alpha was in view he cleared his throat, “are you missing a pup?” Not that his question would be heard over Keith’s squeal of ‘daddy’.
Dean glanced over his shoulder and chuckled. With the tune still clear in his head he playfully swayed his hips as he placed muffins on the cooling rack. “I don’t do anything special,” he said as he grabbed a sack of apples and proceeded to wash them.
Kristina stood up on her chair and announced, “When I grow up I’m going to be just like Wonder Wonder. I’m going to save people and stuff.”
Anyone tried writing a scene with nineteen characters? It’s nerve wracking making sure no one gets forgotten about. Haha
“They’re coming!” Marry said dramatically as she rushed to line up her siblings based on age. It was a sloppy line up because age didn’t necessarily mean shortest to tallest. She took her place next to John.
Having expected to do this as well, Castiel gave Kenny a confused look. It was in that moment of looking up he saw Dean had a look much like the buck had earlier when he’d cornered him to work him toward the snare. He handed the knife to Kenny and took off the gloves.
“Yes,” Dean rubbed the back of his neck, and bit his bottom lip nervously. He looked Castiel in the eyes and waited for something, what he wasn’t sure… maybe for him to run. He’d of run if he’d of been told that his true mate had eight pups. After all, that was a lot to take in.
Anything else they might have had going for them was brought to a halt by a pair of four year olds that came running up to them like torpedos screaming, “check this out”. They’d given one another a look and laughed.
“I’m older than you and also on this hard ass floor,” Castiel smirked and pulled him closer. “I love the way my knot fits.” His finger trailed over Dean’s severely marred mating gland. There was nothing gentle or loving about any of the bites that he could see.
Castiel inwardly moaned as he felt his slacks tightened. There was his Achilles’ heel- the thought of an omega barefoot and pregnant. Not just any, his omega. He wanted to breed a pup in Dean yesterday at this point. He inhaled deeply and willed himself to think of anything else- like his grandma. Which was going to be awful because who wanted to think of grandma eight plus times a day. One way to remedy this. Hurry up and get the master bathroom renovated, and the bed purchased.
“That alpha at the door. He’s…” Mary nibbled nervously on her lip. She knew even if the alpha didn’t. She hadn’t seen pictures of him growing up. However, seeing him in person she knew- her brother John had a striking resemblance. “He’s…” she really didn’t want to say it.
“This isn’t like mom.” Kenny said as he laid out cups, plates, and silverware. “Did you check on them?”
“Thanks but the only settling down I’ll be doing is owning my own bakery at some point.” John balanced the bacon on one hand. He used his free hand to ruffle his brother’s hair. “You wanna get like mom and dad or anyone for that mater just pay attention to them.” He smiled.
Dean bit his bottom lip as he debated on saying something. ‘To hell with it,’ he thought to himself. “This is shameful.” He paused for a moment and then looked at the pups he knew who had presented already, “Jack, Claire, Dawn, Twila please tell me you’ve got supplies in there. You too Amelia and Betty.” He refrained from snatching bags to check himself. And, for sake of some humility he kept it to a single word of supplies.
“No. It’s taught our kids a good number of things. How to present to their mates, how to provide, how to coordinate… The omegas join me. The alphas,” he paused for a moment, “I’ve done my best but I am not a pursuer.”
“You are the first person to ask me that. Shit. I don’t know. Maybe. It’s been so long ago.” Dean ran his fingers through his hair. “What’s done is done.”
“There aren’t many houses you can walk in and smell home and comfort. You smell one or the other or the couple, maybe even the pups. Dean’s home has always been different. It’s like grandmas house where you’re wrapped up in a warm blanket all cozy like. There’s fresh pie cooling on the counter, and fresh flowers lightly scenting the house. It’s amazing considering how many pups are under one roof.” Arthur said as he drew in a deep breath.
“It was just a sleepover. Not a party,” she paused, “but, by the time we each invited a couple friends-” Dawn glanced over at her twin.
“I’m pretty sure mom doesn’t. He thinks everything from dad has been settled.” Nikki paused to think for a minute. “We’re hoping that at the end of the game it’s a note or something from our dad. Like something he wanted us to figure out.”
“I’m only caught because I want to be caught.” Dean situated himself to be more comfortable. He leaned forward and nipped at Castiel’s bottom lip. “Because of how fast and cunning I am several others have asked to chase me for the fun of it.”
“So who do you think would win… Harry Potter or Iron Man?” Suzy directed the question toward the table.
Castiel wanted to say he could change his mind, but settled on nodding his head. “Have you lived here all your life?”
“Whatever. Fine.” Dean rolled his eyes and took the package. He didn’t want to give Castiel an ounce of satisfaction and thus refused to open the gift. He did keep it near to let him know it had been accepted. “I’m not forgiving you for having someone deep clean my space. I didn’t have dust bunnies!” A couple tears slid down his cheeks. He was deeply offended that Castiel had hired someone to clean the master from ceiling to floor. “I’m a very neat and orderly omega!”
There had been a good bit of providers complex going around. Every omega in the house had received gifts from useless things like rocks and shinnies to useful things like food to blankets… piles of lint- the younger alphas insisted it made for soft bedding. The rocks and other useless things might have been humorous if the omegas weren’t reciprocating with dental floss, new tooth brushes, books, etc. It came down to trinket giving. These were brothers and sisters coping with internal instincts to take care of mates they didn’t have- so, instead it got focused on family.
Castiel noticed his bed linens were just as much apart of the messy nest the two four year olds had made. He smiled. As best he could he wrapped his arms around everyone. “Next trip we’ll take you both with us.”
Castiel started mouthing at the fabric where he’d soon claim Dean. Subconsciously his hands slipped to his hips and he started grinding himself against his ass. “We’re up to five.” He huffed, “it’s gonna be like a frat house for a hot minute.”
“He unintentionally forced you into early labor.” Castiel frowned. “Please tell me it got easier,” his voice cracked. He didn’t like the thought of his omega hurting even if it was in the past.
“Why did you tell Arthur that you only had one mom?” He asked before starting to scrub his own teeth.
“Tomorrow I need to call to set up everyone’s annuals. We also need to discuss birth control, and scent blockers with the doctor.” Dean grabbed his pad of paper, and made a few notes. “What about suppressants?”
Charlie dumped hot water over her brother’s head. She wanted to tell him how silly of an alpha he was like she always did, but now wasn’t the time. She knew saying such a thing like that right now would do nothing but add fuel to the spark still dancing within her brother.
Dean refrained from commenting how the color of the sheets didn’t mater- what mattered was how they felt. He headed toward the bed and climbed in. He crawled toward the center. He pulled it up toward his face and rubbed it against his cheek.
“Thank you.” Dean preened. He felt a huge swell of pride for not only himself but for his mate that had passed. This was the house they had restored and made a home… and now he was sharing it with Castiel. That was both scary and exciting. Going forward, they were going to make it their own. “Yes it was originally just that. We had it rezoned to be strictly residential and historical. Occasionally, I’ll have someone from a historical something or other asking for a tour. I’m more than happy to oblige.”
“We didn’t have a lot of space in the motor home so it limited gift giving. That’s when we came up with the best day idea.” Dawn smiled big.
“You’re scaring me!” Dean laughed. He was about to hug them one more time, but his attention was redirected to Castiel who grabbed his hand. He looked at his intended and grinned. If they hadn’t been surrounded by pups he’d of said something lewd like ‘you just can’t wait to get me bent over’. “I get it. I get it. Let’s go.” He grinned, and squeezed his hand.
“I don’t need an alpha dad. I’ve had and buried one… and, Castiel is doing a fine job going forward.” John’s posture didn’t change. “We’ve always known he’s out there and never wanted to go looking.”
“What could possibly go wrong with a schedule like that?” Castiel questioned with a sarcastic laugh. “So, all that aside. What was that business Kenny was talking about? You shut him up real quick.”
Castiel watched as Dean continued to do what he was doing and pour him a cup of coffee- not once looking when he grabbed the cup, the decanter, or to pour. “You did that like you’ve done it a hundred times before,” he mused aloud.
“A statue of a very well endowed wolf.” Just because you couldn’t see the roll of Dean’s eyes didn’t mean you couldn’t hear it. “It’s stuffed in the way, way back of a closet. I only put it out when they come for dinner.” Now a grin could be heard. “Makes it interesting when there’s other guests as well.”
“I’m sure between your dad and I we’ve got the funds. But I’ll tell you like I told him. No loafers.” Dean pulled him into a hug. “What grade you wanna teach?”
“I’d like that.” Kenny batted Castiel’s hands from his hair. “One more thing- it might can go without saying, but just in case… this deer you provide only needs to last long enough for you two to…” he didn’t want to finish the sentence. He looked at him and hoped he understood.
Dean stopped just outside the doorframe. Just in time to watch his son be hosed down. He wasn’t going to battle Castiel over this one. Kenny had blatantly disrespected him. If anything he was thankful for Castiel stepping it.
There was an itch just under all their skin- a want that was so close to a need. They didn’t make it through any conversation without some lewd comment (John was especially randy)… and, once it started it was like a snowball rolling down hill, there was no stopping it until the crash. The moment extra thick cucumbers and jars of sticky honey were bought in combination (and it wasn’t the worst), trips to the grocery store were out the window.
“You’ve got five minutes or I’m ordering for you,” Castiel said firmly, but not so much so that it came out as an alpha order.
“If having this many has taught me anything it’s that it’s like riding a bicycle… except it gets easier. And, you stop worrying so much about the small crap.” Dean grinned. After scrubbing his hands down he grabbed the glass wear. “You could look at me and I’d catch.” He wasn’t sure whether to feel proud of that fact or not. “It’s what got me in trouble in the first place. I was drunk off my ass and a day before heat. Like I said he smelled good.”
With the exception of Keith and Kristina who stood on their chairs, everyone stood up. They clapped, and sang with the staff as they sang their rendition of Happy Birthday! With the fits of laughter it was horribly out of tune. However, it was loved.
Dean pressed his back against Castiel’s chest, melting into the warmth of his alpha. His head naturally tilting to the side. “Yes. We’re going to have to get creative to accommodate our alpha pups…”
“I’m angry at myself because I would have been angry no mater what you did. A new home would have made me just as emotional.” Dean let Castiel maneuver him. He breathed deeply through his nose and out through his mouth. “I’m selfish.”
“One thing we learned on the road is that we’d rather have the best day than the best gift on our birthdays,” Suzy grinned.
Dean involuntarily shivered. He nuzzled Castiel and purred contently. The chill of the outside a pleasant contrast. He yawned as his eyes slipped shut.
Dean watched as the four omega pups crowded together. His nose crinkled. “Yeah. I want to come out and say though… there is absolutely no reason to be ashamed.” He cooed. “Amazon Prime is an absolute Heaven send,” he winked. “Once everyone is settled in we’ll sort this out.” He looked from the pups to their dad. Putting his hands on his hips, tapping his foot fast - body language was doing the talking for him. There was the underlying look of ‘I told you so’ to Castiel.
“I couldn’t stand the smell,” Dean mumbled. In regards to the estate question he nodded his head. He buried his nose in Castiel’s arm pit. He took comfort in his scent and touches, and started to purr.
Castiel looked up at the ceiling and sighed, “the universe is laughing at us.” He saw Deans look when he’d said that and before the diner could be filled with the stink of rejected omega and frantic alpha, he blurted out, “I have nine pups.”
“My x was anything but traditional- I haven’t participated in a hunt and run in a while… but I’m sure it’s like riding a bicycle. It’s something you don’t forget. I can teach our alphas.”
Dean can leave his room now, which usually results in Sam pushing him in a wheelchair down the hallways, or to the cafeteria, or the solariums at the end of the halls. It makes Dean feel like a little less of a prisoner, but not less of a burden. What kind of 21 year old can’t walk by himself ? Especially one with two fully functioning legs. But no, Dr. Milton insists that his lungs aren’t strong enough and his vitals aren’t quite right. Dean chooses to sit by windows mostly, watching the sunset or the stars. He even wheels himself down to the cafeteria sometimes, and parks his wheelchair by the floor-to-ceiling windows, watching the cars go by at night.
Dean stays at Cas’ house for a week, and he can’t believe he ever lived without this. He can’t remember a time without watching Cas smile, hearing his laugh at Dean’s dumb jokes, listening to him singing in the shower. They make breakfast together, they go for walks, they go to the library and read to each other. Simple things, small things that make everything worth it for Dean. The nightmares and the flashbacks, sure they came from Afghanistan, but Cas did too. And he could never regret that.
Cas smiles, because that’s typical Dean- worrying about everyone else before himself. “I’m good, thank you. How is your back today ?”
"You haven't ruined anything. Everything is just fine. This is the best Christmas I've ever had, and I wouldn't want to spend it anywhere else." He reaches out for Dean's hand and pulls him closer again.
After almost a month of spiraling down into a pit of depression, Dean finds his reason -Cas. He wants to see him, and he made a promise.
They leave the establishment, bracing themselves for the heat on the walk to the Impala. The place was pretty packed, and Dean wanted to park in the shade since his vehicle is black and absorbs heat. Neither man notices the trio of men previously harassing them leave the joint not a minute after them.
Thank you all very much for taking the time to read. Your kudos, bookmarks, comments, and all of the support have made the story come to its eventual completion. This was a long process, but I knew I wanted to complete this piece even after it was abandoned for some-odd years. Check out my still-going pieces and be sure that there will be more to come in the future as well !
Castiel’s scruff scratches lightly at Dean’s skin as he mouths at his jaw, sucking wetly on the skin of his neck. Dean tips his head back with a soft groan, tightening his grip on Cas’ hips. He’s hard in no time, his cock insistent against the restraining fabric of his jeans. His hips rock of their own accord, finding his boyfriend’s pants in the same tented state.
They both fall into an intense kiss, teeth gnashing and tongues colliding. Harsh pants fall from both of them, warming the air in between them. Cas starts to grind up against Dean as well, both of their erections straining.
“Adopted.” Gabriel answers Dean’s unspoken question. “We all were.” That, Dean had not known. However, he did know that Castiel had four other siblings, himself being the youngest. The two go back inside to wait with Sam, making small talk until Cas’ doctor comes out to speak with them.
Cas hits his prostate on every other thrust until he thinks that he’s loose enough. He flips him over again and kisses him deeply. “Ready ?”
“Hey.” Dean greets, just coming in from work. It startles Castiel so much that he drops the dish from his hands onto the floor, the ceramic making a loud sound but not shattering.
“You can see that from over here?” Castiel squeaks. His cheeks flare red and he hates that he feels embarrassed.
Dean shakes his head, embarrassed now. He doesn’t even know what he was trying to say himself. He buries his face in his pillow, hoping Cas will drop it.
“What the hell are you doing out here?” The boy rolls off of Castiel, and for the first time he sees his arm in a sling. It must have aggravated his injury to tackle Castiel out of harm's way, but he did it anyway.
Dean lets out a low whistle when they pull up to Cas’ place. “Can’t imagine why you’d be walking in the woods to escape a place like this.” He cranes his head to look out the window at the ornate architecture.
Dean loves the way Cas just accepts him and all of his flaws. He doesn’t mind that Dean doesn’t always want to go out, or do anything really. Cas will sit with Dean and stare at the wall if he wants to.
The accident and Afghanistan are far behind them. They have roots in this town now, and a dog, and they renovated the living room. Everything’s different, yet it’s so much the same- but Hell if it isn’t damn good anyway.
They all sit up with him around the fire, hot cocoa mugs in hand.  The Winchesters watch tv until dawn breaks, light streaming weakly through the window. They all head back to their rooms, exhausted. Dean doesn’t sleep, he texts Cas instead- he should be up, since he should be working.
Things continue like that for months more- the dreams, the confusion…But Cas is there every step of the way. Dean doesn’t mind now, he sees things as a fresh start. He really likes Cas and they do all the things of a regular couple, apart from intimacy and “I love you’s.” They go out together, have movie nights, they even sleep in the same bed now. It’s basically everything Dean has never had before- the white picket fence life. Cas works, but for now Dean doesn’t because he gets compensation for being injured in the war. He secretly likes it, it means he gets to cook meals for Cas and do things to make him happy. He notices all the little things about him, and pays extra special attention. Cas likes to wear mis-matched socks on purpose. He likes ravioli but hates lasagna. He likes space and the ocean. Stupid comedy shows don’t interest him, yet he’ll watch a documentary on hyenas for Christ sake. All of these things are traits that Dean has come to know and identify as Cas. Things he’s come to know…and love.
He finds himself dreaming of a white picket fence, a steady job, and a husband. Yes, a husband.. something he probably wouldn't even consider before, is now all he can think about. He can picture waiting up for Cas as he comes home from a late shift, and them eating breakfast in a diner at 2am. Yeah, he can imagine doing all this stupid stuff, and he imagines it all with Cas. Everything is different now he's twenty-one, almost twenty-two; he's grown up.
“You’ll be extra careful from now on, right ?” Dean asks him. “Or I could drive you to work. Or wrap you in bubble wrap.” He laughs quietly.
It makes Cas uneasy when Dean watches the news. He always sits quietly and intently during the pieces about the war, and it worries Cas. He doesn’t like to think about Dean in his soldiers uniform anymore. It used to make him proud to remember Dean as a hero, but now it just makes him scared. He thought he loved Dean then, but that’s nothing compared to how he feels now.
Castiel isn’t entirely sure what being ‘in’ entails, but if it could potentially help Dean, then he’s definitely in.
“I tell him that all the time.” Sam admits, sighing in defeat at relinquishing the information that he actually does think his brothers cooking is phenomenal.
Dean is getting restless in this hospital. He’s been here two weeks, and he still can’t remember jack and they barely let him get out of bed. The only thing keeping him grounded is Cas- he’s such a sweet guy, caring and kind, and Dean is glad they were- are ?- dating. He always holds his hand when he has to get shots, and he brushes the hair out of his eyes when he’s sleeping. He promises to be here for him even if he doesn’t love him anymore.
Sitting there on Dean’s front porch is an honest-to-God baby. The infant is swaddled in blankets and laying in a wicker basket, like something out of a cheesy Lifetime movie.
“Want to talk about it ?” Castiel asks him gently. He assumes it was another nightmare, which wouldn’t be an absurd considering all Dean has been through. To his surprise, Dean grabs his board and begins to write.
Cas laughs a little and jogs to keep up with him. “Dean, you can slow down a little you know.” He observes Dean for a moment. “Dean ?” He’s slowing up, but he’s also swaying slightly. Cas is at his side immediately, supporting one side of him. “Wanna take the wheelchair back, bud ?” Dean’s fingers grip the sleeve of his lab coat for only a moment before they lose pressure. He slumps against Cas, his knees buckling. “Dean ?!” Cas asks in alarm, going down with him, holding him to his chest. The IV rips out in the process, and blood starts flowing from his forearm. “I need some help !” Castiel calls out desperately. He looks down at Dean, whose eyes are closed. Somehow, he passed out, even though Pam said Dr. Milton cleared him…
“How come I don’t see you around at school?” Castiel wonders aloud. He mostly sees the younger Winchester in the library in passing, but he’s sure he’s never once seen Dean. He would remember a handsome face like that.
Dean could swear he heard the faint telltale sound of air displacement that signals Castiel is nearby, but he brushes it off in favor of giving himself over to the current moment. It’s been a short while since he’s had any action, but tonight he went out with the sole intention of bringing someone home.
Castiel’s cheeks flush. “You’d be surprised.” He mumbles. He gets out of the car and begins to walk away, when Dean stops him.
"Ask you to marry me." Dean smiles fondly at his boyfriend. "You know, I was going to do the whole shebang. Get a ring, get down on one knee. But now...if you want this kid, I'm all in, Cas."
He hates to admit it, but the band actually /is/ pretty good. It’s not even necessarily Castiel’s type of music, but they sound good, even he can hear that. Dean seems really into it, bobbing his head. The area fills up fast with people as the sun goes down. They get some food from a food truck as they wait out the intermission. Cas is just happy to be spending time with Dean
After the movie ends, they go outside to look at the stars, even though the air has a chill and the street lights are on. Dean sits up and looks at Cas “I still looked at the stars whenever I could back in Afghanistan, when you were gone. Did you ?”
Cas sits beside him, rubbing his back, “I’m kind of glad. It made you miserable.” He kisses his cheek and strokes his hair, showing Dean that he isn’t mad.
It’s almost two hours before the doctor comes out to speak with them.  “Mr. Winchester is stable. He’s been moved from the emergency room to a room in the trauma unit. We’d like to keep an eye on him for at least a couple of days.” The doctor is a lanky man with kind eyes and a name tag reading “Dr. Fitzgerald.” He tells the anxious trio that they may see Dean one at a time. “He’s not awake, but I’m sure he will know you are there.” He gives them all a reassuring smile and offers to lead them to their loved one’s room.
He grits his teeth, painful flashes of Dean blurring in his mind. He closes his eyes, feeling the cold metal bitterly cut into his flesh. He winces at the pain but continues. Sticky red spreads over his arm, dripping to the floor. He switches arms, feeling lightheaded already. His head lolls back exhaustedly. In a rush of panic, he fumbles for his phone, struggling to pull of the contact. Through blurry eyes he pulls of the app, clicking on the top name, one of only three or four numbers in his phone. He presses it, gripping the phone tightly and smearing blood on the screen. His head falls to the side gently, his eyes closed as the phone rings. The person on the other end of the line picks up.
She turns around and gives him a brief smile. “How is he doing ?” She hands him the glass with shaky hands.
One week turns into two, which turns into three and a half. There are flyers for the young boy all around the county, and information about him has been sent out in the police database. Cas and Dean spend their days holding their breath over whether every knock on their door will be taking the young boy away from them.  They know its selfish, but it’s hard to want to give a 10-month old back to his parents who seemingly /lost/ him in the first place. Or abandoned him.
“That would be lovely Dean.” Castiel tells him honestly. “I drink tea.” He informs him, smiling. He hopes he appears composed on the outside, because in his chest his heart is beating fast like it knows something he doesn’t. He is pretty sure Dean just wants to go out as friends, but he is so handsome and nice that Cas’ heart can’t help but to want it to be under another pretense. Dean changes his grease-stained t-shirt and they go out to a local coffee joint that same night.
It takes half an hour for Dean to stop crying, and then he's just listless. Cas cleans him up and gets him to drink some water, and then tucks him in.
“Can we talk about something else?” Sam’s tone is gentle, but a glance up at his expression tells Cas that this subject is painful for him, and he feels properly chagrined for the second time today.
“Yeah well I’m me, and you two are...you two. And the you two that you two are is...not hunters.” Dean scowls, standing up.
“If you put your thumb in the middle of the patty, it won’t shrink when it cooks.” The pair are standing side by side, elbows brushing although the kitchen is quite large. Their sleeves are rolled up, and they are working with raw hamburger to make homemade burgers.
Dean doesn’t know how to respond. ‘Oh, sorry for trying to kiss you ?’ No, it was too embarrassing to say out loud. He lays down beside Cas, not touching him now.
Dean grumbles and complains about all of the help, but deep down he knows he needs it. His ribs hurt like hell and they make it difficult for him to walk long distances, even if the ‘long’ distance is considered from his kitchen to his bedroom. He also has trouble laying down by himself. He feels embarrassed in the way his dad used to- like he’s suddenly reverted back to a childlike state.
“Like what?” “Soldier, seraph, saint, warrior, cherub….” Castiel trails off, indicating that the list is quite long.
These past few months Dean has spent a lot of nights laying awake and thinking. He thinks about the fact that maybe everything he went through was so he could get to the good part. He’s so grateful for his happy ending. He’s so grateful for everything, really- his brother, his fiancé, his family…his friends, his house, his awesome dog.
Sam is planning their honeymoon with Jess and Charlie, Dean and Cas’ friend. He’s planning on Australia, because both Dean and Cas have always wanted to go there. Sam wants them to fly there and back, but Charlie and Jess think a cruise would be better. They bicker about it until Missouri Moseley shows up at their doorstep, shaking her head. “What are you fools fightin’ about ?” Missouri is a very close family friend, and has been involved in quite a bit of the wedding planning. All three of them explain the situation to her, and she settles it by saying they can take a cruise ship there and fly home.
Cas speeds all the way to the grocery store- he could hear in Dean’s voice that something was majorly wrong. When he arrives, it takes him a minute to find Dean. He’s sitting on the floor, half curled up, breathing roughly and clearly trying very hard to hold it together. Patrons of the store have stopped to stare, and Cas shoos them away.
Dean is not expecting his phone to ring a few minutes later, but he answers it right away so that he doesn’t have time to think too much. “Hello, Dean.” Cas’ familiar gravel voice greets him.
I still have a lot of plans for this fic, but there won't be more than 20 chapters (total) at most. Comments and kudos are always great encouragement ;)
Cas runs to the door, praying that the person on the other side is Dean. When he opens it and sees that it is, he doesn’t say anything, he just pulls him inside and kisses him.
“No, not exactly….I don’t know what’s wrong, and he won’t go to the hospital. Could you…this is a lot to ask, but could you come over ? I think he’ll listen to you, and….please help me.” Mary sounds desperate.
Cas takes Dean back up to his room and helps him get settled, and Pam comes in to check his vitals. His readings will determine if Milton is going to allow him to walk on his own or not. If his blood sugar is too low, for example, then he won’t be allowed to- it could result in him blacking out or fainting. His body presides as a delicate balance, since he lived undernourished for so long.
Dean starts grinding harder, in small circles. The friction feels so good, he doesn’t think he could stop if he wanted to. The small crescendo in the pit of his abdomen is building, and he goes faster, chasing his release. He feels white hot, on the brink of coming just by Cas’ hands rubbing circles into his hips and the feel of his body underneath him.
“He’s doing much better, but I think I’d like to stay with him for a while longer, if you don’t mind.” Cas replies cautiously.
Dean moves into Cas’ apartment in the end of February. They start refurnishing it together- changing it from the cold, unlived in feel that it harbored before to a cozy atmosphere that makes them both feel warm and safe. Before, it had been mostly whites and blues, just like the hospital. Cas was barely here, so he had no reason for anything else. Together, they change it to reds and browns, mixing in greens and giving the place an earthy feel. The whole ordeal is another shock to Dean’s system, but a good one this time.
“Novak ! Go home, now. Your shift is done.” Henriksen is shaking his head, and he grabs the clipboard out of Cas’ hand. “I expect more out of you. And for you, Pamela, my office, now.”
He hands it over, shivering when his bare arms hit the air of the cold, empty house. His damp hair certainly isn’t helping any matters. “Sorry, it’s always pretty...sterile in here.” Cas grimaces. He tries (and fails) not to stare at Dean’s handsome profile.
Castiel is wide awake after the phone call, partly from the wired state of his mind and partly from conditioning to being up at this hour. He lets Dean sleep while he cleans the place top to bottom, just for something to do. When he is finished with that task, he gives Meg a call. She can’t disclose much information to him due to patient confidentiality, but she agrees to let Cas attend some of their sessions if Dean gives permission.
Dean and Castiel talk about the semantics of it, in the event that they could actually make this happen. Dean can start working from home more often, and Castiel can hire employees to help out with his store. Sometimes he can even take the baby with him. They can convert the guest bedroom into a nursery for the boy.
Sorry that this is a little shorter than the others ! Thank you to the people who have been commenting so far...let me know what you guys think about this chapter ? I hope it's not too cheesy.
Their lips touch tenderly, Dean’s hand cupping Cas’ jaw and Cas’ hands on his waist. They pull away to breathe each other’s air for a moment before another, more chaste kiss ensues. Dean steps away. Their kisses were amazing, but it just feels right to stop now and leave some anticipation for the next date.
Cas sees Dean almost as much as he sees Sam, although their interaction is much more limited. He often picks them up from here or there, but he doesn’t always stick around for the hanging out part.
Cas takes that as a good sign, it couldn’t have been that bad if Dean wants to return. He breathes a sigh of relief. “Let’s go get some ice cream.”
Cas has laid awake on more than one occasion thinking about all the things he’d like to do with Dean in their future. Having Dean stay the night was one of them, as well has have sex, move in together, buy a house…Cas would love nothing more than to do all the good things in life with Dean, but sometimes he’s scared of pushing Dean away. He doesn’t blame him for struggling to be able to do some things, and he just hopes his own impatience sometimes won’t sabotage their relationship. He dreams of buying them a house, and getting down on one knee. He knows deep down that he’s completely in love with Dean, and he would do anything for him. He’ll wait for him.
He goes downstairs, and hears his family conversing in quiet voices- most likely in worried tones, about him.
Cas slowly spreads his cheeks apart and teases his hole. He slips one finger inside gently, working it in and out before he adds another. He scissors and bends his fingers, searching for Dean’s prostate. He knows he found it when Dean arches his back and thrusts back on his fingers. “You like that baby ?” Cas asks with a smirk. Dean moans into the pillow in response.
“Dean !” He flings himself at him and wraps his arms around him without another thought. “You’re here…oh God…you’re here.” He mumbles. Dean has longer hair now, and he’s definitely thinner, but he’s the same Dean.
“We’re just having a damn drink, Cas. Not bothering anyone.” He clenches his fist around his beer bottle.
Dean takes a deep breath but surprisingly, doesn’t shy away. He swallows before continuing- “Scary. The hardest part was the not knowing. Not knowing when he would be back, or what was going to happen next. And, you know, not knowing about my family, that was hard.” He’s quiet for a long moment, and Cas thinks that he isn’t going to say any more.
His voice isn’t what Cas would expect, but it’s nice. Low, a little raspy from lack of use, but it gives Cas a glimpse of what Dean had been prior to this.
That night, Castiel dreams about a teenager in a dark room. He’s crying for help, sobbing and begging, but he’s alone. Cas can feel his loneliness, his pain and suffering, but he is unable to do anything but watch. He wakes up in bed, sweating and afraid for the boy. Afraid for Dean.
I didn't really like the last chapter I posted, so I hope this one was better. It's a little short because my computer is broken, and long story short I'm typing this on my Dad's computer, directly on the site, so I have no idea how many words it is.
“You know, I may have just met you, but I missed you.” Dean admits. “I miss talking about real things. All anyone wants to do around here is complain or talk about home. I want to talk about life. I want to talk about things we love and hate, and memories and happy times, not things we miss. Not the fucked up things, not all the lost time.” Dean sighs and looks up at the sky.
And that sentence makes Dean’s heart swell. Cas makes it sound like even though they were countries and millions of miles apart, they were together because of their sky.
“Hey, how about we relax fellas, huh?” Dean snips at them, clearly losing his patience. The men just laugh in response, as if Dean has told a joke. Cas watches his boyfriend, seeing the tension in his whole body. “Dean…”
Castiel has never known that he could have everything he wanted in life and be so blissfully happy. It seems like a lifetime ago that he got in a fender-bender with a stranger, turning the unfortunate situation into the best thing that could have possibly happened. Castiel's car is in tip-top shape now, the boys' time in the garage reminding them of times gone past. Dean starts taking online classes at the local community college for a culinary degree. His fiance convinced him to go for it and pursue his pipe dream, and so he is. He feels more confident and in control of his life than he's ever felt, and he knows Castiel feels the same. The man has really come out of his shell since the start of their relationship. He makes such a great dad, Dean can't wait until they make it official.
“That doesn’t make me feel better. I don’t like seeing you hurting.” Cas admits. He doesn’t dare meet Dean’s eyes.
“I would never. He’s a great guy, really great.” He says this with sincerity, none of the fake stumbling he would have given to the father of some girl he was with at the time.
He hopes his idea isn’t lame, but he can think of a perfect sweater to make him. A huge, cozy maroon one, and he’ll find a patch to iron on the front.
“Dean works here often?” He asks, then immediately winces. God, his people skills really are rusty. Why must he constantly be so awkward around people?
“I wanted to kiss you too.” Cas tells him softly. He turns his head and pecks Dean’s shoulder instead.
It’s been one week, and there are no new updates on the case. If it can even be called a case- Sam and the local P.D. have zero leads on where the infant came from and who his parents are.
Cas feels relief like he’s never known. “Of course I’ll move in with you.” He moves in two weeks later, with his bookshelves and his aquarium and his Backstreet Boys CD’s.
John and Mary insist that Cas stay the whole week with them, so he doesn’t have to be alone. They have a guest room in the same hall as Dean and Sam’s rooms, upstairs.
“Yeah, well he’s a softie.” He smiles wryly. “Hunting is his thing, you know? He enjoys all of it, saving people, feeling like he’s making a difference.”
A new patient had moved into Dean’s old room within a day. It was almost odd now, going in there and seeing a frail old woman instead of a young guy with bright green eyes. He feels odd now that he can’t make sure that Dean is okay, and to be honest it bothers him. So much for no attachment.
“It will be good for you…to talk about things. I know there’s things you don’t want me to know, so maybe you can tell this guy. His name is Garth, he’s supposed to be really great. Please, Dean ?”
They spread their books out and start working, when two sodas silently appear in front of them. The other boy seems unfazed, but Cas glances up to see Dean’s back walking away from them.
up.” He gestures out the windshield. “You think I’d let you walk in this downpour? C’mon, what kind of guy do you take me for?” He teases.
“I want it to be a date.” Cas tells him. “You’re so nice to me, you’re a good cook, and….I want it to be a date.” He repeats. He is blushing on the other end of the line and is thankful that this is not in person.
“He looks different.” Sam finally says. “Not even older, not that much. But he used to be really tan….and he had freckles on his nose. I guess it’s weird seeing him without a smile, too.”
Dean ignores the question “Who are you, and where did you get these ? They’re more valuable than gold around here.”
Cas can’t imagine what Dean must be feeling; all the things he must have felt throughout his capture, and all the things after. As he watches over Dean as he sleeps, he wishes that Dean could be as peaceful as he looks. What did such a gentle soul do to deserve everything he’s been put through ? Then again, Cas could probably say the same about everyone in the hospital.
Cas regrets that goodbye every single night. He cries himself to sleep, torturing himself with replaying thoughts of Dean back in Afghanistan. He can’t even bring himself to talk to him, because it will just be that much harder when he leaves. Dean is going to leave him, and he might not make it back.
Dean's eyes grow wide and Castiel lets out a small gasp. Sam leaves them alone with a small file of papers regarding the CPS visit, promising to call later. The two males sit together on their couch, at a loss for words for quite some time. Finally, Dean speaks, "Well, this isn't quite how I wanted to do it." He laughs shakily, his nerves causing his voice to tremble.
Castiel loves seeing Dean like this- coming undone. He’s panting and moaning on his lap, and he feels so perfect against him. Cas moves his hands down to cup Dean’s ass “Come on baby, almost there.” His own orgasm hits him by surprise, and his muscles stiffen up as he bursts out with a long moan. Like a chain reaction, Dean is coming as well, and they both have a silent moment of bliss before they collapse, boneless.
“So all of it, it’s all real?” The dark haired boy looks to Dean for answers as they drive out of the forest.
“I’ll take you out for dinner, we’ll get burgers and fries. Or whatever you want..” Cas tells him hopefully.
Interns often do shifts that last days at a time, so around midnight Cas is still at the hospital, taking a coffee break and watching the news in the on-call room. The story of Dean being found alive is blowing up the local stations, and even quite a bit of the national ones. Cas turns the volume up to listen “….21 year old Dean Winchester was found alive today by police in Wichita, over three hundred miles away from where he was abducted, four years ago. Police say that his kidnapper, Alistair Robbins, passed away a month ago of a heart attack, leaving Dean locked in this basement, with no way out.” The camera cuts to a shot of a dilapidated basement. “It was a stroke of luck that caused the discovery- neighbors had not seen Mr. Robbins and called to report it, bringing local police to the scene. Sheriff Jodi Mills was the first to identify the young man as Dean- she was a family friend of the Winchesters. The family will finally be reunited with their son this evening.” Cas shuts off the tv after the story ends, trying to take it all in. It seems like something he would see in a crime television show, but this is something real and it happened in his hometown...it sends shivers up his spine, and he leaves the cold and empty room to find some company.
“Just because he isn’t allowed back at home doesn’t mean I don’t care.” She looked from Frank to Dean. “Are you eating enough Frank? For that matter Dean are you eating enough.” She sniffed the air they shared. Before either one could say a word. “Don’t think I don’t know.” She pursed her lips at Dean. “Hopefully it’s just you two.”
Dean looked over his shoulder and grinned. “I know you do but it isn’t going to get Thanksgiving dinner on the table.” He leaned forward just enough to pull a half asleep Castiel toward him. “Later you can show me just how thankful you are for me.” He kissed him playfully
Dean stood in the room with his head titled up. As if expecting to smell something vile he cautiously sniffed. Other than hints of Castiel, and himself the room didn’t smell like much of anything. Not much of anything was better than it smelling of a bunch of strangers. But, not having the familiar scent of the room made him feel out of place. He wanted to tell Castiel to take him to the living room, but he didn’t.
Castiel led Crowley up to the study. “You even think of hurting one of my pups…” other than a growl he didn’t finish what he was saying. His eyes narrowed as he opened the door.
Castiel glanced over at his daughter questioningly, but before he could question her someone else was already speaking up.
“I’ve never seen a male wear a towel like that,” Castiel commented as Dean came out of the bathroom. “Or, have I seen a woman make it look as good either,” he added. The towel was riding high under Deans armpits and barely covering the curve of his ass cheeks. It was a wonder his cock was covered- if he got him even the slightest bit riled…
Dean’s whine cut him off, “But, I did. I eat EVERYTHING when I’m with pup.” He rolled his eyes, and rubbed his empty tummy. “I’m a monster you’d find on one of those horror shows. It’s awful.”
Castiel pulled Dean so that he was flush against him, back to chest. He rested his hands on Dean’s stomach possessively as he nuzzled his neck.
Dean’s nose wrinkled. The stench of an aggressive alpha was the worst. He checked the pocket holder on the wall and saw no phones missing… so, outside interference was out. He knew none of the studies were seriously that hard- or for that matter the work tasks for today either. He grumbled as he put his book down and went to investigate who pissed in who’s corn flakes. On his way he grabbed the pail for ice water.
Dean rolled his eyes and sighed. “Whatever… I guess if it works it works… but I’m telling you now I am not subjecting myself and my eight pups to that kinda chaos.” He narrowed his eyes and hissed.
Castiel looked Kenny in the eyes. He responded with a thicker ring of red, and a firm posture. He nodded his head. Once he saw the slight tilt of the pups head, and the subside of red in his eyes- he relaxed. He opened the door and pulled Dean out, “come on, it’s only a few days,” he laughed, “not months.”
“Like your instincts would instruct you different,” Castiel snorted. “Yes I will breed him full of my pups. I will mate him. But, I’m also here to protect your mom, your siblings… even your punk ass.” How he was putting sentences together was beyond him. He stood up and jerked the younger alpha up.
Castiel nodded. “I kept my nose clean. Did my job, and did my best to raise an honest family. Retired when I felt it time. There’s nothing special about my name.”
With the exception of the crust of Suzy’s pie hitting the floor dessert was uneventful. The conversation was bland, mostly talk about the work the pups had been doing around town.
“I bet if we asked Ketch he’d let you check out the truck and sit in the seat.” Dean ruffled his hair and turned his own fork into a fire truck.
“He was kind enough to call my brother who happened to be my emergency contact once we were done. Told him he better hurry up and collect me before someone decided they wanted sloppy seconds.” Dean frowned. It wasn’t his finest moment. He’d had years to replay it, bury it, and replay it. It got easier with time to talk about it.
“Sorry pups. Condoms are the one thing daddy doesn’t need help with.” Dean fanned himself. It was getting impossibly hot in here all of sudden. He looked toward Castiel who was laughing with the rest of their pups.
“Don’t do that. Then I’ll do it. Then Frank will do it.” Dean cringed. “But that feeling… that’s nerves.” He pulled his pup to him.
Dean’s heart hammered in his chest. His brain wasn’t processing that his alpha bested his pup, what it processed was that he bested a challenging alpha. Despite the stink of anger and mud, he could smell possession and arousal. He was stopped mid tilt of his head when Castiel grabbed his wrist and started to mouth at it. He was safe. He was protected. He was Castiel’s. “My alpha,” he purred.
Dean leaned against the door frame and watched the family as they played in the snow. If not for the bright colors the younger pups could have been lost in deep snow. He laughed when he saw the alpha pups working together to take down their dad. He whistled to get their attention. “Hot chocolate!”
“Make it or break it.” Dean laughed. “Seriously though. At least this will give Betty a chance to see if she actually likes her career path.” He playfully licked Castiel’s nose. “What got her into wanting to join the service?”
“That makes two of us. I can’t keep my hands off of you,” Castiel’s voice was rough. He gripped his hips and stilled them both. Nostrils flared, breathing in heavy amounts of slick and arousal. “You weren’t kidding about coffee-”
“Here we go!” Two waitresses had appeared with their drinks. They got them passed out best they could. There were a few mixups and a few faces made when someone sipped someone else’s drink thinking it was theirs. They laughed and teased but within a few minutes they it had right.
Dean’s eyes slid to the floor. “We aren’t allowed to talk about it,” he hesitated for a moment before adding, “government business and all that jazz.” He chewed nervously on his bottom lip hoping that Castiel wouldn’t use his alpha voice to force anything further out of him.
“I know you’re young. I’m going to be forward since this seems like your dream career. You can enter the field as an omega one of two ways. You have a hysterectomy or you take some strong suppressants and birth control. The later is going to tear your reproductive parts up so it’s best to just go ahead with the hysterectomy. If you’re wondering what that is ask your mom. If your wondering why. It’s because we can’t risk miscarriage after miscarriage. It damages your mental state. You can have a husband or a wife… even a adopt. But, having pups you’ve carried and being in the field is a no. So if you present omega think long and hard. Especially if as you say you don’t want to be benched.” He kept the smile on his face the entire time.
“Evening Chief Ketch. It’s a pleasure to have you for dinner.” Dean tilted his head forward just a nod to the alpha as he pulled out a seat for him.
“Same,” what Castiel was answering to he wasn’t sure. It was a blanket answer. Maybe to one thing, maybe to multiple. He didn’t care. He growled possessively. Any hope he had of reining himself in ceased to exist the moment he smelled slick and arousal. He rubbed Dean in rhythm with his own grinding. It was taking every ounce of control to not divest them of their clothes and fully take him here. “Mine.” He started nipping feverishly at the clothed juncture between neck and shoulder.
That got everyone’s attention. They scrambled around the room for pillows and blankets. As they were setting up, from the hall came the exclamations of ‘sleep over’. It didn’t long take their fits of giggles to reach down stairs. Soon Dean and Castiel were joining them with snacks.
“I consider myself the fortunate one.” Castiel couldn’t help the puff of his chest or the smirk on his face. The compliments all around were generous.
“Nothing wrong with that. Go on find the right one. Settle down. Have a crazy life. It’s worth every minute of it.” Dean said with a grin as he looked around the room. “Sammy owns the dinner. We’ll stop by tomorrow and see about getting you an interview.”
Kenny slumped against Charlie. He closed his eyes, and wished everyone would pile on top of him. If they did that then he could pretend to have disappeared from the room, because he knew leaving the room was not an option.
“You’ll learn that if you leave things with the word chocolate or that involve sugar at a certain height and lower it attracts more attention and trouble than it’s worth.” Dean yawned as he slouched in his chair.
Dean did what omegas were good at when nervous- make themselves look small. He stared at Castiel, and took a huge breath. They’d seen each other naked, had plenty of mind blowing sex- but, somehow this was way different. They were intended. Intended went to their homes at the end of the night, he was kinda old fashion like that. Intended didn’t normally have sex. But their scents were so compatible it couldn’t be helped that they were so handsy with each other. If this had been a normal situation they’d of had a bed already, and been mated in less than 24 hours. He cursed as he mentally battled with himself.
However, it did have Castiel blushing. “That wouldn’t be appropriate to give you on a first date.” He coughed and cleared his throat. If you didn’t know better you’d almost think their rolls were reversed.
As if the salad would attack Frank, he gave it a death glare. He hugged himself tight. For a moment you would of thought he’d lost the battle the way he looked like he wanted to bolt out of the room.
Twila pulled Kenny a little closer. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Margaret and Suzy crawling toward them. She held a finger to her lips, and then motioned for them to join.
“It’s Dean. And just watch your mouth around here.” He uses a moment to take Cas in. He’s different than anyone Dean’s ever met, that’s for sure. A young kid having the balls to do something like this, travel the world and talk to an armed soldier like that.
