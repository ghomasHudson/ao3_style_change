“I mean, if you want to try it, then maybe we can…
“He was pathetic as a human,” Castiel said defensively.  “Besides, what would we have done with him?  He’s not like Crowley, he needs food and water to stay alive.  You can’t just leave him in the dungeon and hope he’s still okay when we get back from traveling.
“Even put a blanket down,” Dean said, gesturing to the back seat.  “Buddy, classy and thoughtful as always.”
Sam would even give up on him.  He wouldn’t want to hear awful things about his older brother.
“No, you didn’t,” Dean said, still looking away.  “Cas…
Dean had been on what felt like the same stretch of road in Nebraska for two hours.  It was dark, and it was late, and Dean was tired.  Sam was asleep in the passenger seat, soft snores making their way to Dean’s ears even over the chords of “Angel with a Shotgun.”
“Don’t worry, it’s not
“Nah, man,” Dean said.  “Just us.  They’ll be other times for a 3-way.”
This was ridiculous.  These angels were looking at Castiel as though he were something akin to God, and the last time Castiel had been “God”, it had

After defeating Lucifer and God, he was taken down by
It felt… it felt…
November moved into December, and Castiel returned from Gaza with a strip of pre-Biblical lore that was part English, part Aramaic, and completely worthless.  It gave a few leads to other locations of other texts, however, and Castiel took off for the Vatican the following day.
Castiel shook his head.  “It's warded against angels.”
“Don’t.  Ever.  Undress me.  Again,” said Castiel, looking around for his black suit.  A second later, Castiel took off his shirt.  All three men averted their eyes, though Dean only pretended to do so.  He admired his friend’s chest and muscles as long as he dared before turning to his own suit jacket.
Dean found Castiel in the library, sitting at a table and happily eating a burrito.
Dean took Castiel in his mouth, swirling his tongue around Castiel’s cock.  Castiel let out a moan and shot off the bed, his fingers tightening in Dean’s hair.  Dean sucked lazily, because tonight they had all the time in the world.
In response, Lucifer became sneakier.  As the group of them made the last preparations for their battle with Amara, Lucifer struck again, surprising Dean on his way out of the bathroom.  “So Cas knows you…
of Dean’s arm as it broke, and he grunted with pain.
“Right, yeah,” said Dean, relaxing but still wary.  “We don't hear from you for days, you show up, you start wrecking the joint…!”
“Castiel cannot stay here,” said Sam, and Dean realized with annoyance that Ezekiel had taken back over.  “He will bring the angels down on all of us.”
“I will, Dean,” Castiel promised, and then he hung up.
He’d watched humans for thousands of years.  It shouldn’t be this hard… “Perhaps we should have this conversation about commitment that you speak of,” Castiel said.
“I’m ready, Dean,” Castiel groaned.  “Want you.”
“I don't know,” said Castiel.
“You and Sam stay the hell away from me,” he said as he walked out of the bunker.  “Next time I won’t miss!”
“You have

Tomorrow was the four-year anniversary of –
“Cas… how long do you have?”
“Agreed,” said Crowley.  He snapped his fingers, and suddenly they were all in the parking lot of the Bellaqua hotel, Castiel’s truck on one side and the Impala on the other.  “Now.  There’s not much we can do tonight.  It’s getting late, and there’s a burlesque show down the way I’m just
Sam looked incredulous.  “No, you’re bisexual, dumbass,” he said.  “And neither is Cas, for that matter.  He’s an angel, and has no technical gender beyond his vessel.”
Dean began to open his mouth, but Castiel added, “You are not much different yourself, Dean.”

for once.  He had no business risking his life to come help Sam, especially if he couldn’t use his grace to heal him… “Wait, no, no, no.  No, hey, that's not an option.”
look at Castiel.  Castiel used Dean’s computer, but Dean could feel his friend’s eyes on him every so often.

“No,” Castiel said.  “No, you
Lucifer’s words came back to haunt him.  “
“Cas!” screamed Sam.
“I’m not exactly in the best shape,” Chuck confessed, “but I suppose I could try.  It won’t matter though, if -…”  But Dean was moving toward them.
“Cas,” Dean said, and he surged forward, smashing his lips to Castiel’s.  Castiel kissed like a drowning man finding water – it had been that way, lately more than ever, during the rare times they had together.  And yet despite his intensity, Castiel still moved frustratingly slowly, as though they had all the time in the world.  Dean thrust upward and barely touched warmth before Castiel pulled away again, just slightly.
Season 8, Part 1
There were streets full of humans, and he wanted
“Sammy, I… I don’t know what to say,” Dean said finally.
Castiel did not hesitate, but immediately wove his arms around Dean and pulled him closer, shocking Dean even more than his own impulsive decision.  Dean forcefully slipped his tongue past Castiel’s lips, and suddenly it was as though their tongues were in a battle for dominance.
Benny didn’t go far; his vampire friend was out of sight, but it didn’t stop Dean from hearing the cacophony of sexual noises coming from the three monsters.
“Well, okay, then,” responded Dwight.
“Cas, you just gave up an entire army for one guy,” Dean said gently.  “No, there's no way that you blew those people away.”  Dean could never repay him…
“I was just... so stupid,” Castiel sighed, voicing his feelings for the first time since he once again claimed possession of his vessel.
Still, Sam kept on.  For the first three injections, Dean goaded Sam about the horrible things he had done in his search for Dean.
I mean,
A loud, happy barking met his ears.
“You were able to talk to your parents, Charlie said,” Castiel continued.  “I know there were tons of people wanting to talk to you.”
Normally Dean would sass Sam back and point out that there was no way he wouldn’t be awake by noon.  Instead he said, “Bitch.”
Half an hour after that, Castiel asked, “Dean, can I use your computer?”
Perhaps this was Castiel’s fault, because of Jimmy…
Almost… hopeful…
When Cain was dead, giving the First Blade to Cas for safe-keeping took far more effort than Dean let on.  He pretended like it was fine, but he knew Sam, and probably Cas as well, weren’t fooled.  He pretended he didn’t hear them talking about him in hushed tones.
“No, Sam, of course I’m not
Castiel looked surprised, then closed Sam’s laptop and faced him fully.  “Dean, what is wrong?”
Castiel watched him furtively.  He was ecstatic that Dean was still alive, of course, but Sam’s kidnapping and the resurrection of Dean’s mother complicated things.  He had known Dean long enough to understand that he wouldn’t want his mother to know that they were… whatever they were.
He liked the look on Sam’s face, the disappointed, disgusted look.
“Dean, we’ve been through all the lore,” Sam said reasonably.  “There’s nothing.”
“Cas, do you want to-…” Dean began tentatively.
Three hours later, Dean was snoozing contentedly, still naked.  Castiel had once again donned his trenchcoat, but had remained sitting on Dean’s bed, his legs stretched out in front of him.  Dean had invited him into his bed, and he didn’t want to leave, despite his lack of need for sleep.
“He murdered Tessa,” Hannah explained.  “He broke our rules.”
“Yeah, I remember.  You said I sucked,” Castiel accused.
Castiel surged forward, groaning when his erection made contact with Dean’s flesh.
I don't care if heaven won't take me back
to ignore the beast, but it wouldn’t be long now.  He tried to search out a quiet spot, away from the humans.  He couldn’t even remember leaving the bunker.  How had he escaped the chains?
Sam’s face appeared to sag in relief, and Dean realized his brother had actually been
Dean knew Castiel was right, though he would miss the angel.  It had only ever been a matter of time, after all.
“Dean,” Sam said solemnly as they made plans to confront Cain, “Wielding the Blade against Cain himself... win or lose, you may never come back from that fight.”
Their discussion was interrupted by another development in the case.  A robber called the “Black Hole” had hit a nearby bank and dropped an anvil on a security guard.  It was the third of three deaths that were, as Dean put it, “straight out of a cartoon.”
all the time.
“Dick,” Dean had grumbled under his breath, and tossed his phone aside.
Castiel met his eyes as if looking up from a daydream, and Dean realized he had caught the angel staring at him.  “I should think so,” said Castiel.  “I walked in on Crowley with four hookers once in the one in his room.”
When he read about a war between angels at a biker joint, however, he leapt at the opportunity to investigate.
Castiel accompanied the brothers on a few hunts, and Sam always politely opted for a separate room.  Dean was of course happy that Sam was giving the two of them an opportunity to have “alone time”, and even happier that he didn’t constantly tease Dean about it.  He had a strong suspicion, however, that Sam was also using the time away from Dean to do more research about the Mark.
hope you’re not using my bathroom for anything
“He’s with Hannah,” Dean grumbled, determinedly not meeting Sam’s eye.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa!” Castiel exclaimed, jumping backward.
“Hey, Cas, listen to me,” Dean cut Castiel off.  “There are angels out there, okay?  And they – they're looking for you, and they're pissed.”  Dean had almost been killed by one of them that morning.
“Don’t you?” Billie challenged.
This time when he turned up the radio, Sam didn’t protest.  Dean’s mind whirred all the way back to the bunker, however, and it was a long time before he slept that night.
feelings.  It was confusing, but also intoxicating.
The song reminded Dean of Castiel.
“Yeah,” he agreed.
“I’ve seen one,” said Castiel.  “It is effective.”
Castiel floated in and out of consciousness for a few hours.  He knew that Rowena had escaped, but at least the beast spell was over.  He could feel the rumble of the Impala below him, and fell quickly back asleep.
Castiel shrank back from her in horror.
And he felt only a desperate sadness.
Castiel managed to call Dean after the Darkness was released, but the phone call left Dean more worried than relieved.  Dean and Sam were busy dealing with an outbreak of a zombie virus which they were certain had been caused by the Darkness, and Castiel wasn’t fairing much better.
“Well, guess what?” Metatron snapped.  “He's dead, too.”
“Yeah,” Dean said coldly.  “You always do.”
“You mean since your attempt to be Amara’s ‘Daddy’ went south?” asked Dean snidely.
“Cas…” said Dean, looking horrorstruck.  “Dude.  We’re in LA.  And we have a
“What, she's here tonight?” asked Sam.
“It'll take time to fully heal you,” Castiel told Sam after he had given it his best effort.  Any more uncontrolled grace now and Sam would run the risk of exploding.  “We'll have to do it in stages.”
Finally, two months approached, and there was the worst prayer yet.  “
“Hello, boys.”
“I’ll drive,” said Castiel.  “Your level of intoxication, while not nearly dangerous, is above the legal limit.”
“Never mind,” Dean said, visibly clamming up.  “Forget I asked.”
Twice Dean woke up in other women’s beds, and, once, in another man’s bed.  He remembered each of these occasions as fleeting half-drunk images that seemed like a good idea until the moment the deed was done.  He never bothered to learn their names, or, in fact, stay until morning.  He was hardwired not to sleep for more than four hours at a time, which usually allowed him the opportunity to sneak out during the night.
Dean shot up and put as much space between himself and Cas as the small booth would allow. "I was just lookin' at the menu," he tried to explain. “You only gave us three.” The fact that he felt so comfortable practically cuddling with his best friend that his mind didn't register a damn thing on the menu was beside the point.
Dean closed his eyes and sucked in a breath, quickly exhaling and repeating the action as he prepared himself for the pain. He wasn't ready, but not wanting to admit that to his partner, he decided just to nut up and let it happen. When he felt a warm hand touch his leg he flinched, but managed to refrain from pulling away completely.
The restroom door flew open again and Sam, followed closely by Kevin rushed in. The two men who had been in the stalls reemerged about the time Kevin entered and the kid ended up being pushed flat against the wall after running face first into a man with particularly strong body odor. The man who Cas had poked raised his fist to hit the smirking brunet, but was stopped by Sam who latched onto his arms and held them behind his back. Dean had regained his footing after being shoved aside and went to drag Cas away from the man Sam was holding. Cas flailed his arms, wildly swinging his fists in a futile attempt to punch the restrained redneck. Dean thought it would have been a hilarious scene if not for the fact that the other two men were about to beat the crap out of his little brother.
“Well, it sounds like they uploaded that video of you and Cas.”
"No."
all night. If Sam wanted to be a bitch about it fine, but Dean was taking Cas even if he had to drag the ex-angel kicking and screaming – which was a very real possibility considering Cas wasn't at all happy with him lately.
“How 'bout we go home and spend the rest of the evening in bed?”
“I was not in danger of urinating on myself,” Cas responds on his way out of the small room they had recently converted into an entertainment space.
did something wrong?” Dean asked affronted.
“Just a sec,” Dean told him as his phone went off again and he read Sam's message.
Dean gripped the steering wheel with one hand and used the other to rake through Cas' soft locks. Cas yanked the panties down as low as they would go without tearing and glided his mouth even lower. He picked up a steady rhythm, moving his head faster and Dean couldn't stop himself from bucking his hips up and pushing in deeper, hitting the back of his throat. As a punishment for his presumptuousness -- or possibly a reward for his initiative -- Cas switched the setting of the plug to maximum intensity.
"Oh, I love seeing you like this. All loose and limp in my arms. I wonder what you'll be like after I fuck you. All weak-kneed and fucked out. Blissed out. What do you think, Cas? You think you'll be able to walk after I fuck your pretty little hole? Hmm? After I have you so blissed out you can't talk?" Castiel managed to summon the energy to shake his head and Dean's warm chuckle on his skin was all the reward he could've asked for. The sound was like warm whiskey tumblers and melting ice cubes in small glasses in goldenrod/ochre lamplight. He must still be a little out of it, because that didn't even make sense to him.
"So you're..."
"Thanks, Dr. Bradbury."
Dean shuffled awkwardly and ran a hand through his already tousled hair. "Listen, I- Just- Oh, for fuck's sake. I-" A knock sounded on the door and Dean cursed colorfully before going to the door. "Yeah?" A rough male voice with a beautiful deep Cajun accent sounded from the other side. "You gonna let me in, brother?" Dean chuckled and pulled the door open revealing a tall man with a scruffy but well-trimmed beard sporting a black Stetson Cambridge cap. "Hey, Benny."
"You've been bad, Dean, disobeying me." There's no rhythm, no rhyme or reason, and they're increasingly harder and faster. With fingers plunging into his hole and a harsh hand smacking his ass, forcing his cock to rub up against Cas's pant leg Dean's hurdling towards an orgasm at light speed. "Your ass looks so pretty with my hand print all over it." He whines loudly at the words. He's aching and leaking and rock hard against Cas's leg.
“I could never hate you,” Castiel said seriously with a shudder.
“Sure,” Dean said finally.  Yeah, we could help.  Gotta make sure you don't do anything else stupid.”
Dean didn’t trust her at all.  He surmised that Castiel was still on the run with the angel tablet, and Naomi was attempting some sort of long-winded effort to get Castiel back on her side.  She needn’t have bothered, Dean thought.  He didn’t trust her, and he had more important things to worry about at the moment than his rogue angel friend.
Honestly, this made things even worse.  As his anger left him, it left behind the gaping pit that had once been filled by Castiel.
“Did something happen?” Castiel asked, looking concerned.
Still, he knew that Mary was unhappy and felt out of place.  “She asked me when it started to feel like I belong here,” Castiel confessed to him one night in mid-June.
Castiel stole the Colt and crept out quietly.
wondering if he should text or call Castiel, he found out that Sam had been texting him off and on.  Then he felt like a dick, and started texting and calling his friend on a regular basis.
“I’m sorry,” said Dean.  “I-…”
“It's what it always should have been,” Bobby continued as Dean sat down.  “Everyone happy.  Everyone together.  Well.  Most of the time.”
“What?”
“I was just wondering what he's up to,” said Dean.  “He's got to be up to something right?”
Dean stood, walking so close to Castiel that the angel could reach out and kiss him if he wanted to.
“Cesar and Jesse were cool,” Sam said nonchalantly.
Why would you--…” began Dean’s mother.
“There may come a time – and I don’t anticipate it, but it’s possible – when I have to go to Heaven to perform a duty for a long period of time,” Castiel clarified again.
“Cas!” Dean yelled.
The look on Castiel’s face was nothing short of excited glee.  It was the look he used to get in Purgatory after a long battle, just before he and Dean would pin each other against a tree and stick their tongues down each other’s throats.
Dean had started calm, but now he was once again becoming animated.  “I
He was weak, though.  He no longer was limited by a failing grace, and was once again restored to Seraphim level, but he was weak.  The grace Metatron had kept was but a tiny amount of his true power, and it would take days to replenish.  There was no point going after Metatron now.
Dean and Sam walked toward Castiel with hesitation.  “Cas?” Dean whispered, holding his broken arm.
“Ma’am,” Rod said in greeting, tipping his baseball cap.
Castiel thought briefly of Heaven.
In between searching for signs of Kelly Kline and having sex, they discussed the threesome idea.  Castiel suggested simply buying a hooker, but Dean insisted that it was a point of pride to never need to pay for sex.  Dean didn’t feel that he excelled at much, but he
“No,” said Castiel.  “This call is pointless.  My ride's here.”  And he hung up.
Crowley went to keep a look-out outside.  Castiel went to tend to Kelly.  Dean loaded his gun.
Dean was silent for a long time.  “We’re just
“No.  You’re… Purgatory.”
“Next we have the Rod of Aaron and the Staff of Moses!” yelled the announcer, and Dean and Castiel both turned expectantly, Castiel wincing at the interruption.
not to think about those things.
Dean sagged against him, seeming to melt.  “’Don’t hafta do that,” he groaned huskily.
Thunder crashed outside, and Dean wondered briefly if it was the weather, or if it was the Earth reacting to how near they were to closing the gates of hell.
“This isn't right!” Castiel exclaimed to Naomi.
“Cas, forget I asked,” said Dean.  “Sex with you is great.  There’s no reason to bring another person into it.”
I went to the tattoo factory and sure enough, she got an Enochian warding tattoo, like the one I put on my vessel…”
”  What had he gotten himself into, and how had he not known?
“Dean, are you alright?” Castiel said, alarmed.  “I’m familiar with that spellbook, and it’s nothing to be trifled with.  One hundred years ago-…”
28 minutes, at 9:35 PM
Castiel used the first opportunity to flip Dean over and grind hungrily against him.  “I missed you too.”
“Hey!” yelled a voice from behind Dean, and then he felt a blunt object, a beer bottle, smash on his head.  He could feel the blood running down his face.
“There has to be another way,” Castiel insisted to Naomi.
“We’ll get through it together, okay?” Dean said reassuringly.  “We’ll find a way to get the angels back into Heaven,
“Cas, man,” Dean said, and Castiel was surprised to see a small tear in his eye.  “It’s always been you.  You know that… right?”
“Naturally,” said Castiel gruffly, now fully dressed in a suit and attempting to arrange his bowtie.
“Well, I don't know,” said Castiel.  “But there has to be something.  And how many more chances are we gonna get?”
“For Heaven?”
“And Cas says that because of the work Ash and I did, in six months, the ethereal plane will open up closest to Jupiter, and there’s a loophole for the last few souls divided by a power of five!” she finished excitedly.
“Effects of the Mark?” Castiel wanted to know Sam’s opinion.
“Yeah,” Sam agreed.  “I mean, I would think that getting killed is something.”
“Why would the angels have him kill another angel?” asked Dean, but Sam only shrugged.
burn the Book of the Damned.”
“Dude, I was the one that drank the stuff,” Dean offered with a small smile.  He looked newly showered, and Castiel could smell the shampoo he had used.  This made him even more frustrated, and, somehow, even more guilty.
“Whips and – no, man, no whips and chains, okay?  You made me promise to lock you up until the Angel Amore wears off!” Dean said, derailing that train of thought before it could get any farther.
“What happened?  What time is it?”
But, in a moment of clarifying truth, he realized that it was quite possible that he
“Cas, is this place warded?” Sam asked urgently.
Something had changed since the rit zein.
“Saving your ass!” exclaimed Dean.
Little Cas didn’t look like Castiel – not to Dean, anyway.  He was a hair too thin, an inch too short, his hair was too long, and his trench coat was more olive green than tan.  Most of all, he was much, much too young.  Still, it was enough to make Dean shiver, and something twisted inside of him.
, Dean thought determinedly.  Bobby, Dean, and about seventy other hunters were celebrating by wiping out the entirety of the five major monster families in Chicago, a happy discovery that Bobby had made about a month prior.  Dean was the happiest he had been in a long time – this was by far the most interesting thing that had happened since –
“Got a lead on Kelly?” asked Sam as Dean began a comeback.
Dean knew what Castiel was going to say before he said it.
of this bond?  And it won’t… it won’t
“Dean, I’m sorry for everything,” Castiel said, looking at Dean pleadingly.
wouldn’t use it for.”  He raised his eyebrows at them.
Castiel grinned around Dean’s cock, his blue eyes boring into Dean’s.  He massaged the spot again, and again, adding another finger that felt better than Dean could’ve expected.  It was good, too good, but it wasn’t supposed to happen like this!
“But Cas-…”
They had been in solitary confinement, then.  Castiel had heard that some humans used that to torture.  The worst of the angels and demons used it, but it wasn’t preferred – most angels considered it too horrible, and most demons considered it too boring.
He has no idea what to do, or how to fix this. Running's not an option. He's not worried about dealing with his dad. It's always something or the other that he's done wrong or hasn't done to the exact specifications given to him by the old man. It's Cas. He's only had the teaspoon-sized version of all the baggage Dean's carrying. How's he going to react to John showing up here, or wherever Dean is and causing trouble? He has a laundry list of things that he doesn't need John knowing about, and the biggest of those would be about his boyfriend. The hell from that almost makes the thought of being a hermit profitable. Hell, logical. Why can't he just live a normal life? He puts his head back down, screwing his eyes shut in frustration.
"What if-" Sam clears his throat, "What if it was Dad?"
"When they're happy to see me," Cas replies, and Dean blinks. Okay then.
“I’m fine with that. I’m also starting therapy, by the way, and I don’t want to miss any sessions, so, yeah.”
" Cas punctuates the words with slow, hard rolls of his hips and Dean's eyes roll back in his head. He feels teeth scrape across his throat sharply. "Focus, Dean."
"I have a plan. Lock your legs around me." Dean does it without question, his legs going around Castiel's abdomen and crossing at his back, bringing them closer together. Castiel puts his right hand to Dean's lower back and uses it to steady and support him as Castiel lets the knot holding Dean's lower half up loose. Dean barely drops what with Castiel supporting him. After removing a few more crisscrosses of rope, he can let Dean down enough to stand.
Thankfully he doesn't have to wait for long for an answer.
"What's not fair?"
Dean excites Castiel in the best of ways, in ways that no one else ever has. Just thinking about him bound and splayed on display for Castiel has him feeling like magma is pumping through his veins instead of blood. He's never met anyone like Dean. He's sassy and arrogant at times and sarcastic and brash. Yet so incredibly soft and almost delicate at others. His sassy boy, but his kitten as well. Castiel needs to stop thinking about this unless he wants his partial problem to become a full, raging problem.
Dean likes the look on Cas. He wonders if he looks like that when he's asleep. Probably not. He shakes his head softly and slides up the bed and onto Cas. Dean's legs brace against either side of Cas's hips, and Dean rests his head in the crook of his neck. Hands come up across his back, and Cas rumbles into Dean's ear. "Good morning, Dean."
complicated than he first thought. Dean is damn near irresistible.
Castiel has a feeling that this won't be the only fallout, but he's not sure. Is there no one in Dean's life that ever took notice of Dean's problems? He's spoken a little about his younger brother Sam, and some about his mother and father. John Winchester was a complicated subject to talk about. Castiel didn't get much more than a sentence about him.
After they’re done eating, they park themselves on Dean’s couch and watch old reruns of House M.D.
"I'll get her fixed up. You can wait in the lobby if you want, or you can go through that door there," He points to a far door in the corner, "And find Dean. He's working on his lil project in there like some kind of Einstein."
"I don't know, Cas. What's it like being human?" Cas was quiet for a minute before he said, "Okay. I see your point. It is nearly impossible to describe. May I correct my question then?"
"Why're you here?"
Dean gulps and glances over at Cas, who's looking at him intently. "I... Well, almost every day."
He sighs and sets the cup back down on the counter and pinches the bridge of his nose. Everything with John and the police sapped him of his energy, and he expected that Dean would need some comfort, but not this level of total control from Castiel. He doesn't want to mess it up, otherwise, Dean might not ever want to be little again. His whole body hurts from the fight and his knuckles are bruised and aching. He needs about four more aspirin and a chiropractor, he thinks with a wry chuckle. Oh, what it is to not be young anymore. He hears soft footsteps on the wooden floor and turns around to find Dean there, clutching a pillow to him, looking for all the world like a lost toddler.
After responding to Dean, Castiel frets. What's he supposed to do now? He doesn't want to avoid his boyfriend, but he also doesn't want to rush a conversation between them that they're not ready for. Castiel knows better than to assume that Dean won't remember. They have things to talk about, and Castiel's going to have to face that. He rubs his temples with growing frustration at the headache lurking behind them. He pushes away from his desk and heads for his basement without really thinking about it. His fingers find the light switch by memory, and the warm fluorescents calm his racing heart. When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he opens the door to the playroom and steps inside.
The rope that goes around his ass and hugs the top of his legs feels all kinds of good. It's the chest harness that's getting him. When he flexes his muscles, the rope tightens, and he can't move. He's so restricted, but it also makes him feel safe.
“Oh, God, Cas. You feel so good around me. I can’t wait to be inside you. Can you… How do I- Just tell me what you want me to.”
Castiel grins dangerously, "Bring it on."
"Your maker?" Cas seemed confused.
"That's not creepy."
"Oh, I'm afraid I can't pick a favorite band. I have a very eclectic taste."
Dean wakes up with his alarm blaring and his muscles protesting how long he's been asleep. Fuck, he needs to ask Cas what kind of bed he has because Dean's is about as comfortable as laying on a pile of gravel. Dean rolls over and smacks his alarm for it to stop screaming at him and collapses back into the pillow. His eyes flutter closed, and he mentally reminds himself that he can't go back to sleep... Can't go back to sleep...Can't...
“I’m so close, sweet boy. Cum for me. Let go.”
"Oh, what a good boy. Do you like that?" Castiel tugs on the clamp by the chain. Dean purrs, "Yesss."
he thinks wryly, looking down at himself with a mixture of amusement and disdain.
"Some. The way I approached Dean was completely wrong on my part, I'm still not even sure what possessed me to make a move such as that."
He whispers the words again, and Cas groans deliciously. He starts fucking into Dean at a furious pace, and sweet fuck, that's amazing. Cas is hitting his prostate every second or third stroke, slowly taking him closer and closer to the edge the more he does it. Then there's a sharp pull on his nipples, and
He needs time to stop.
"No. I just want you inside me. I can handle this. I promise."
"Like what?"
sit down."
"Right. Right..." Shit. What was wrong with him? He felt like a giant girl or something.
"He's my maker. That's usually how it works."
"Really? Were you and your parents separated?" Dean shrugged and sat down on the bed next to Cas, he wanted to be close to him. "Something like that. Dad was fighting in the War when we were kids, so my mom and me and Sammy were pretty much on our own. When I was four our house caught fire and my mom died. I managed to get Sammy out but I couldn't go back in and find Mom. I had to stay with Sam. We stayed with a friend of the family, her name was Missouri for a while before my Dad came back on leave. The messages that had been sent hadn't reached him, so he didn't know Mom had died. He was devasted. It changed him. He was pretty much an asshole for the next twenty years, then he died. He raised me as a soldier, and I raised Sam. He'd leave and go off on long trips without telling us where he was going or anything. I didn't know if he was going back to fight, or what. I eventually learned that he went AWOL. He deserted his team and pretty much disappeared here. It wasn't easy, but me and Sammy managed to keep our heads above water." He snapped his mouth shut with an audible sound.
For the second day in a row, Dean awoke to the sound of pounding. His eyes flew open with a foreboding sense of déjà vu, which quickly abated as memories of the previous night's events came flooding back. He stared up at the water-damaged ceiling tiles, trying to analyze the twisting feeling that was forming in his gut when more knocking pulled him out of his head and back to reality.
Cas thrust faster and bit down on Dean's neck, holding the hunter flush against him while they moved together. Dean was dripping precome and the slick substance provided just enough lubrication for Cas' hand to easily slide up and down his shaft.
Dean obliged, crawling up the bed, and Cas latched onto his shoulders to pull him in for a kiss. It was strange tasting the remnants of himself on Dean's lips and tongue, but not unpleasant. He could feel Dean's hard length pressed against his stomach and wondered if he would taste different. He reached down between them and wrapped his hand around the other man's cock.
"It's not that bad," Dean said and reached out to grab the last menu before realizing that Cas had already claimed it. "What the hell?" he said looking at Cas challengingly, who in turn looked back at Dean with the same intensity he had often used as an angel.
and then cuffed the other wrist. Dean pulled his arms back to see how much
“Okay, fine,” Dean sighed. “Yes, I'm attracted to him.”
“Thank you,” Cas said cordially.
Sam's head whipped around to glare between the couple. He didn't know what was happening, but they were obviously doing something inappropriate. Dean was leaning forward slightly, his face beet red and his jaw clinched tight. Sam's eyes shifted to Castiel who simply blinked at him with an unreadable expression. “Whatever you two are doing,
," Dean groaned, his voice ragged. "That feels good."
“No, but Dean promises to show me videos later that will explain.”
"Of course he's fucking taking pictures, Cas," Dean answered, sounding more annoyed than angry.
“Stop! I don't wanna know,” Sam cut in quickly. He was met with a pair of glaring green eyes. “So do you... want to take those with you?” He pointed at the dildos on the bed.
“Yeah.” Dean grinned. “Don't wait up.”
Like trying to prevent innocent eyes from being assaulted by bad dye jobs is a crime.”
Dean said incredulously. “What about Cas? Did you see the way that sleazeball was leering at him?" he huffed. "And what the hell was up with him molesting Cas right in front of me like that? You should've let me break his fucking nose.”
“God, you make it sound so...” Dean trailed off not knowing how to finish the sentence. Gay? Sappy? Romantic? “You can't say stuff like that about me. I don't deserve-”
Dean grunted, knowing there was no point in arguing and leaned forward to kiss the other man. “Thanks for patching me up, nurse Cassie.”
Sam realized Dean was trying to avoid any further awkwardness, to which he was grateful for. He went out into the hallway, going through the door he had partially broken to get inside the room. It was a good thing none of the staff or other guests had been by yet. He hoped that even drugged, Dean had sense enough not to use his real name when they checked in, otherwise they'd be screwed.
“I know, Cas, and last night I meant it, but today it's just really confusing and I don't know what to do.”
Dean continued to suck him though his orgasm, swallowing down the last few spurts then licked his way back up before pulling off with a wet pop. Wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, he sat back on his heels and looked up at his friend. Cas was staring down at him, pupils blown and completely blissed-out of his fucking mind.
“Because you need to say it out loud.”
It also explains why Cas kept slinking off last night.
“So,” Sam plops into the seat across from him. “Me and Cas, huh?” he says with raised eyebrows and a smirk.
“We're not
He climbs back in bed and into the waiting arms of his angel, who pulls him close, and stays there until he dozes off.
“Cas, it's not like that.” Dean sighed. “I just don't want it online and that's got nothing to do with you.”
"Smoke in your face again, Sammy?" Dean asked annoyed and slid himself closer to the former angel, leaning in to see the menu. Dean tried to focus on reading the menu in front of him, but found himself nearly intoxicated by the sweet scent of the mangos 'n cream shampoo Cas used. He was barely aware of how close he was to Cas now, pressed right up against him with his head resting comfortably on his friend's shoulder. He let out an involuntary "Mmm" just as Suzy the waitress returned with their drinks.
Cas nodded in agreement.
“Dean, I enjoy our time together greatly, and I assure you I am
feel fine.” Sam rolls his eyes. "I’m also fairly sure it's just a witch. We can handle it."
Forty-five minutes later (Dean counted) Cas strolled out of the bathroom in a cloud of steam. “All yours.”
and more
Dean was expecting Cas to crush their lips together with a statement like that, but instead the former angel swiftly crawled up the bed and positioned himself so his crotch hovered over Dean's face. “I think we should utilize that skill,” Cas growled.
The redhead, whose name was Shelby apparently, went around Sam to retrieve her taser from the ground. Sam watched her carefully until she dropped it in her bag. “Yeah, and by the way,” she looked pointedly at Dean, “the ecstasy didn't suddenly make you gay, if that's what you were implying. I mean, yes, it heightened your sex drive and all, but Mia,” she jerked her head towards the brunette, “and I were there the whole time and you guys basically ignored us."
having doubts?"
“I shouldn't need much,” Cas said handing Dean the lubrication.
word you say," he plunged back down, taking him to the root, then lightly scrapped his teeth along the underside of Cas' cock on the upstroke.
," Cas panted and locked eyes with the hunter. He reached between them and wrapped a firm hand around Dean's throbbing cock. They were both on
thing.”
Sam winced. “Yeah and take my advice: don't bother them.”
"Yeah, I got that," Dean said, and before Cas had a chance to gauge whether or not he sounded angry, he added, "No offense, but that was a pretty crappy kiss."
“Why'd you think that?” Dean asked, wondering why he and Cas ended up at the bathhouse if they had successfully picked up women.
." Cas moaned, twisted his fingers in Dean's hair and bucked his hips. Dean relaxed his jaw and let Cas fuck his mouth, setting a rapid pace. He was close. So close. He was shaking with the excitement of being with his friend this way. His disbelief that it was all a dream was long gone. There was nothing he had ever, or could ever imagine that would feel as good as what he was experiencing. It was indescribable.
Dean and Castiel spend the day together. Cas goes on a power trip. Dean (not so) secretly loves it.
“Sorry, I couldn't wait any longer,” Dean said, locking the door.
“Knock it off,” Dean snapped. “I've already got one bitch of a headache and this crap ain't helping.”
Baby is parked exactly where Sam and Cas left her days ago, with the keys still in the ignition. He drives away from the bunker and is on the road that leads into town before letting the despair wash over him.
The coffee pot is full by the time he’s finished, so he pours some in a mug and waits. It isn’t long before Sam wanders in and greets him with a frown.
“There's that,” he said, grinning. “And it's
“More?” Cas questioned innocently.
“Are you certain? I wouldn't mind reciprocating.”
"Alright," Dean mumbles. "Stop naggin' me."
“Awesome,” Dean responds. “That’ll come in handy.”
'I am,' Mia assured. 'Put on some music.'
“I’ll return later,” Cas says and softly shuts the door, like he’s trying to keep his presence there from being discovered.
. This was not something they had done yet and Cas needed to know that Dean was ready for it. He used the tip of his finger to massage around the muscle at Dean's hole before slowly pushing the first finger in. He waited for Dean to relax around him and then began working into him. When Dean started to push his body into it, Cas eased in a second finger and moved them around, scissoring him open. When the third finger was in, Cas hit his prostate and Dean's body convulsed with pleasure. His hips buckled and he pushed back, fucking himself on Castiel's long fingers.
Cas continued to move his fingers into him and bent down at a slightly awkward angle to wrap his mouth around Dean's dick.
“If we were at this place last night, perhaps we should search there for answers.”
“Fooled around?” Dean asked again. Sam shot him a bitchface.
"Fucking Christ, you're ridiculous drunk," Dean said and kept his arm around Cas while they staggered towards the men's room. They passed the booth still occupied by the group of rednecks they encountered upon arriving. Dean thought he heard a gruff voice say something about “queers” but he couldn't make it out clearly over the other noise and it could've just as easily have been “beers”. They were in a bar after all. He ignored it and continued on until they made it to the dingy two stall restroom.
'No, we'll be safe,' Cas answered with an irritated tone. 'I have my angel blade.'
“I'm not gonna change my mind, Cas,” he assured. “I know I haven't given you any reason to believe that, but please, trust me. Let me show you.”
” Dean swings his legs over the side of the bed and stands. “What are you talking about?”
He cringed at the imagery.
Dean blinked at her. “Huh?”
“I can tell.”
“Something you could benefit from,” Cas replied coldly.
Sam and Cas, who have never expressed an ounce of romantic interest in one another, worked a case involving witches and came home boyfriends.
"Alright, Dean."
Rubin shook his head. “Look, I was here last night when your brother and Mr. Tall, Dark & Sexy came in,” he nodded at Cas and winked. Dean squeezed Cas' shoulder protectively and glared back at Rubin. “They were both pretty out of it already. I honestly thought they were drunk. We get guys in all the time that get smashed and come lookin' for a safe place to hookup. It's pretty common around here.”
“About?”
...is a big part of his problem right now."
There are dirty dishes in the sink that weren’t there when he left the night before. They must have made themselves dinner. He knows it’s irrational to be irritated that they ate without him, especially considering the pizza he ordered them is at the bottom of a dumpster being eaten by flies, but they didn’t even bother to call and check in when he didn’t come home.
It didn't take long before Dean was achingly hard and his cock demanded more attention. He knew he didn't have time to mess around, they needed to hunt down the son of a bitch who stole his car, but his body had other ideas. Letting the urge for release trump all logic, Dean quickly washed his hair and body to get the actual bathing part out of the way. As the last of the soapy water swirled down the drain, he let out a soft moan when his hand finally wrapped around his waiting erection.
“Uh,” Sam ran his hand through his hair nervously. “So, I kind of reported those strippers to the guy who owns that club.”
“Hey, Cas.”
"It does seem improbable," Cas answered as he felt Dean's fingertips dipping inside his boxers. "There's a good chance I may be dreaming."
Dean grunted. “Not like I had a gun to your head.”
Dean ran and jumped on the bed. 'Just bring it back tomorrow.'
“You have some nerve,” Sam says and he looks more furious than Dean's seen him in years.
Cas threw the pillow away in frustration and sat up to lean against the headboard. Drawing his knees up to his chest, he grabbed his phone from the bedside table and checked the time: 2:03 a.m. Sighing, he figured if he was going to be up all night he could at least try to find them another case.
Dean had memorized all of Sam's tells so he knew his brother was lying, but decided not to question it. Sam had enough dirt on him now to last a lifetime.
Dean let out a shuddered breath and nodded, tightening his fists as the plug relentlessly prodded the bundle of nerves, sending jolts of pleasure though his body and blood rushing to his dick. Just when he could no longer stifle his reactions – or keep his legs from giving out - the vibrating stopped abruptly.
“Oh.” Cas' tongue darted out to wet his chapped lips and Dean's eyes followed the movement.
“I promise. Now will you turn this fucking thing off? I can't take it anymore.”
Dean stopped dead in his tracks. “What?”
Dean closed the distance between them and wrapped his arms around Cas' waist from behind. “I'm a little disturbed by how much Charlie knows about our sex life. Also... nipple clamps?”
curiosity.”
In those instances, Dean usually tells his brother to stop being a "naggy bitch" and orders the exact same thing Cas is having to spite Sam.
“It's not that bad. Be thankful they don't write that gross incest stuff anymore,” she said helpfully. “Not as much, at least.”
"Does Sam know you've been using his laptop to watch freaky fetish porn?" Dean asked, laughing. He turned to his side, facing Cas and kissed him before he could respond.
“And that's my cue to leave,” Sam said uncomfortably, getting to his feet and heading out the door. “I'm gonna go set myself on fire now. You kids have fun.” He doubted Dean or Cas even heard him, both way too engrossed in what was happening on screen.
“Alright,” Cas said and let go of Dean's waist.
“Pets?” Dean shakes his head. “Hell no, you’re not keeping them.”
“I'm sure it would be very satisfying,” Cas answered, catching Dean off guard. “Not that I have experience to draw from, but we both appeared to be enjoying ourselves a great deal. It really is unfortunate that we're unable to remember. I have always imagined that you would be an exceptional kisser. It would have made a pleasant memory.”
“I'm going to take a shower so I got undressed,” Cas answered in a tone that suggested Dean was stupid for needing an explanation.
Castiel's smile faded instantly and he gaped at the younger Winchester. "You're complaining that our lovemaking prevented
“That's not what happened,” Dean snapped. “I just reacted badly to some stuff he said and it made him think I didn't want him here.”
“Jesus, Cas, NO,” Dean yelled. He wasn’t sure why he was lashing out, he knew it wasn't fair to Cas, but he also didn't know how to explain what he was feeling and why he needed time to think. “If you're so goddamn horny, take care of yourself.” He didn't look back to see Cas' hurt expression before he went into the bathroom and locked the door behind him.
“I know, right? Total cockblock.” Sam smirked.
“I need to pick up something,” Cas answered, somewhat cryptically. “If you don't want to, I'm sure Charlie wouldn't mind.”
. Hell, you even admitted that you constantly inconvenience yourself just to make me happy. In my experience, people don't show that kinda devotion to someone they only sorta like. So, I want you to be completely honest about how you feel about me. I promise I won't get mad or freak out again.”
He dug out a set of clean clothes from his bag and put them in the bathroom along with his toiletry bag. He picked up his boxers from the floor and went to pull them on only to discover they were hard and crusted with patches of dried come. Cringing again, this time of his own accord, he tossed the boxers in the trashcan and put on his jeans instead. He wasn't sure why covering himself up mattered; not only had Cas already seen everything, he had gone down on him
Castiel mouthed at Dean’s neck, inhaling Dean’s smell of apple pie and polish and tasting something distinctly aftershave and
"It was a long time ago," Cas grins and signals to get in another lane.
"Get outta my head, Cas," Dean says, trying to be firm. Cas smirks. "I am not trying to read your mind. You think rather loudly when you're aroused, however."
CasCasCas - "Sir. Fuck, yes! There! Oh, God!" Cas chuckles. His hands snake around Dean's legs to squeezing his hips so tight it hurts a little, but Dean loves it in the heat of the moment. "Yes! Yes, that. Please!"
“It was,” Cas agrees. “Why haven’t we been doing that?”
Every grabbing hand and gentle hair tug is an
Okay, guys, I've said it before and I'll say it again. I KNOW Dean is super emotional in this, but I promise I'm A. Doing it for a reason, and B. basing it off facts. Dean's emotional rollercoaster in this chapter is based on my own experiences and what my doctor tells me goes on with me. The emotions he experiences, the way he experiences them, are based off my own thought processes and I do not feel an ounce of shame for "Mary Suing" it. Nor will I. These things need to be talked about and normalized. You are not crazy, nor is anyone who suffers from these types of things. Also, I just want to point out, knowledge and awareness about mental health are so SO important!
"Do they always do that?"
Relief tugs at his heart, but he's still suspicious. "Are you telling me the truth, Dean?"
"Wow. That's... harsh." Dean didn't realize that they could be that dramatic. Maybe he shouldn't do this. Would Dean be able to keep working if the medicine made him sick? While he had a small nest egg of savings stashed away, it wasn't enough to keep him afloat for long.
It's another moment of clarity for Dean. This man, this bedroom, and this time right now, they mean more than he could ever explain. The tight feeling in his chest is an emotion he doesn't begin to know how to process or articulate, so he suffices it to say, "I love you."
"C-Cas. H-hands. Hands, ple-please." He pleads, and Cas immediately takes his left hand, the one that isn't occupied in Dean's ass, and pulls an end, and the whole thing unravels. Dean figured out what was wrong. He couldn't hold onto Cas, and he needed it. Dean needed the warmth, the steadiness of Cas's body. Dean only belatedly realizes he spoke those words out loud.
"How often have you been bothered that you have poor appetite, weight loss, or overeating?"
"Yeah."
Dean complies immediately, being careful not to knee Cas or anything. The next thing he knows, he's straddling his abdomen, Cas's cock twitching and hitting his ass every few seconds.
"I-I'm not-"
~Castiel~
Castiel considers. "Not really. It's... Dean's wonderful. Our dynamic is powerful. I've never met anyone like him."
Castiel can’t remember being this broken in all of his adult life. He’s suffered breakups and personal setbacks, even professional ones, who hasn’t? But it’s never
"I am not something to be ashamed of! You are! You're a fucked-up alcoholic who drank his life away, and you tried to ruin mine, but you couldn't, and that killed you! I'm happy! For once in my miserable life, I'm actually happy and you can't stand it! That's why you're here, you miserable bastard!"
"We need to do that. Zachariah will look for me. If he finds me..." He left the end of the sentence blank, correctly assuming that Dean knew enough of Zachariah to know what Zachariah would do. Dean gave a small smile. "Cas, you know the bible right?" Well that was an odd question. "Yes, of course, Dean. I would have been very hard-pressed to not know it after all these years." Dean nodded understandingly. "So, Proverbs 18:21?" Castiel knew it and recited it.
"Of course." Dr. Bradbury says, and Dean wonders if what she's really thinking. She's young for a doctor, he thinks.
It's a shorty, but I did bang it out in like a little over an hour. And considering how annoying my lil sister is, that's saying a lot, lol. She's like a puppy. I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter! TELL ME!!! Click that comment button and tell me! <3
Cas's voice interrupts his fantasies.
Dean just hums, and his breaths are soft and slow. Castiel smiles and pulls away from him a little, then cuddles into Dean, laying down again. His boy is asleep, safe, and cherished. Castiel spends the next few minutes thinking about Dean and what he's learned tonight, not just about his past, but about their relationship dynamic. Hmm...
(See the end of the chapter for
"Benny, you here yet?" He hollers through the garage, his voice echoes off the painted concrete, and he hears a chuckle from where the front desk is.
"Shinedown."
he has to go say hello. As he gets closer he begins to hear another voice though, a rather high, reedy voice of a woman. With curiosity, he circles a column protruding from the floor and listens in.
Cas puts the magazine down. "I don't suppose that we can go home and sleep after this?"
"I didn't leave it that way."
"Uh... It might've crossed my mind once. In a passing kind of way..." Dean stares straight ahead, trying to ignore the guilt beating on his ribs.
"What, you don't? Dude, did you see his face?" Cas smirked, and Dean realized he was trying to keep his composure. "Oh, it was definitely amusing. I didn't realize a person could turn quite so red. He does an excellent impersonation of a stop sign." That sent Dean into another fit of chuckling and that kept him floating high and happy until he made it to the interstate. After they'd been on the road for a while, in comfortable silence with ACDC filling the gap, Cas asked him, "Where are we going?"
"Because I wasn't sure what you wanted. Being able to smell you isn't mind-reading, Cas. Not even close. So what is it? What does my little Omega need? Hmm? You gotta tell me, Cas." Castiel bit his lip. There was only one answer to that question that he could think of. "You. You... Alpha." Dean growled softly but ferociously, and it split Castiel's mind in different ways. Part of him reacted naturally to the sound, and he was afraid, and part of him was unnatural, and it was kind of arousing. "Say it again." Dean's thigh was suddenly between Cas's leg and it took all of his willpower not to thrust against it, but Dean took his control away by moving his leg against Castiel's already hardening cock.
Cas gives him a small smile. "I've been told I'm aesthetically pleasing."
"Feels like it," Dean mumbles, clearly trying not to show Castiel how tense he is, but he sees it anyway. Dean's nervous. Scared. He has the fleeting thought that this may be more than he's ready to handle, but he dismisses it just as quickly. He wants to do this, and he wants Dean.
"A little. It's nothing bad. I imagine your foot has it worse," Cas says, grunting a little as Dean finds his way up under Cas's boxers. Dean chuckles and wraps his hand around Cas's cock loosely and begins to tug gently, not enough to chafe. Every swipe of tongue against skin is an
"Look, I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Besides, it turned out to be a good thing! My car kind of broke down, and I was trying to make it there, but that didn't work. I've never been good with cars like you are. You think you could get it running again?"
"Rhonda Hurley, she uh, made me try on her pink satin panties, and I kinda liked it. I've - Oh, yes." Dean said as Cas pulled his panties down over his ass, and one of his lubed fingers slid across Dean's pucker, making him try to clench around nothing. Dean knew he was a clear bottom ever since he found out that he liked guys too. Dean never thought it'd be like this, though. He never thought he'd be freaking aching with the need to be filled up with cock.
Cas's hand comes up and runs through Dean's hair, gently playing with it.
When he woke up it was about an hour later, according to Dean. It had just been a cat nap, but he felt better. Dean had ordered food from room service and Castiel had tried french toast for the first time, which was amazing, frankly. Breakfast usually was either dry toast or bland oatmeal, if he ate at all. He had three servings of french toast, which made Dean laugh. After he had been taken care of in that department, Dean had insisted that Castiel shower.
"I don't think there's any such thing."
Oh yeah, he's supposed to talk.
"Of course not. It's adorable, baby boy. I love that you're so free with me. Do you remember what I said upstairs that I expected you to give me here?"
"Favorite bands?"
Regardless though, "Dean, you have no say in what I do." Dean arched his eyebrow, surprised by the challenge. Moving so fast that Castiel couldn't register it Dean swung his body over him and Castiel was suddenly pinned to the mattress. His hands were above his head and being held down at the wrists by Dean's inhuman strength. Dean's face was close and it was smiling a little cruelly.
"Yes, Cas. It's alright. Do you want to lay down? It'd be more comfortable." Dean was a bit surprised that Cas started nodding, but he took it in stride and walked them over to the bed. He let go of Cas and sat down, scooting himself up the bed until he was leaning against the headboard. Cas was standing awkwardly at the side, looking ashamed. Dean patted the side of the bed next to him in invitation. "Come on, Cas. It's alright. Whatever you want to do, okay?"
He shuts the door with a weary sigh and flops down on the couch. Without Sammy here it's really quiet and really weird. He has nobody to talk to, nobody to cook dinner for or ask how school went. It's just him and the low rumble of traffic and people yelling outside. It's not exactly a nice neighborhood. The long white box sitting on the table that he nearly killed himself on this morning catches his eye and he leans forward to inspect it. It's about two feet long, and a foot thick.
Dean's lips lift into a small smile and Castiel can't help but to lean in and press their lips together. Stars don't explode, and universes don't ignite in wonder at their kiss. But Castiel's world comes together, and everything is right. "Okay, Dean."
Dean complies and takes Castiel's cock back in his mouth without waiting for Castiel to tell him. He swallows around him again as he settles, his eyes close. His body goes completely lax against Castiel's. He strokes his fingers over Dean's cheek and ear and up into his hair without ceasing. He picks his phone back up and unlocks it again to continue typing.
"You ready, Dean?" Sam pipes up. He looks pretty cute in his black tux. Dean ruffles his hair which makes the twelve-year-old complain loudly. "Dean, stop it! I'm not a kid anymore."
"Y-you said you wanted to test my limits."
~Dean~
Fuck, this is hot. Cas has been fantasy fodder for God only knows how long and now he's lying on top of Dean and making everything worse. Or... Maybe he's making it better.
"So, he has this really cool pad. I ended up sleeping on the couch, but his couch is like, a bed by itself, you know? It was great. And he had all these bodyguards! They were everywhere and they just did whatever he said. It was really weird, but he was cool.” Sam finally pauses to take a sip of the water he’d ordered and Dean raises an eyebrow, looking at him curiously.
The cold metal bites down on his hardened nub with a powerful pinch, but fuck, he loves it.
"I swear to you, I don't... When I look at you, do you know what I see?" Cas murmurs in his ear, and Dean shakes his head, shoving his face into the soft blankets and exhaling hot breath into them.
"Holy shit," He murmurs.
"Yeah, of course. Come on. I'll meet you at the door. I'll be the one in white."
"I need you to do me a favor."
"What, are you serious?"
"No, not the sausage!"
"Thank you for your help."
This is what was wrong. Cas isn't here. Dean exits the shadowy entryway back onto the moonlit porch and pulls his phone from his pocket. The black screen reminds him how much better he needs to get at charging it.
“Okay, well, I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?”
He curses up a storm as he fumbles the door back open. He snatches his phone off the counter and slams the door shut on his way out. If it's not locked at this point, he'll take the risk. He's over it.
"Sounds good, Sir!" Dean squeaks as Castiel presses his fingers against his perineum and stimulates his prostate from the outside, through his pants no less. Dean's hips buck up into his hand, and Castiel chuckles. He pulls his fingers away and gives Dean's cock one last squeeze before running his hand back up Dean's chest and over his mouth, covering the needy whine issuing from his pink lips. Dean's eyes are wide when he looks up at him.
Dean sighed frustratedly.  “Things are different here.  Sam’s here.  I’m…”  He felt embarrassed and raw just talking about this secret part of himself which he had never discussed before, not even with Castiel.
The weeks after Castiel’s death blurred together.  Dean spent most of his time drunk.  It wasn’t a conscious decision – at first he drank more to help him sleep, and eventually he drank more to get through the day.  He honestly wasn’t terribly far from being an alcoholic anyway.  When he was around, Castiel would frequently cleanse Dean’s body of both the alcohol and the desire for it, something that Dean never realized until a few days afterward.  Cas had also done Dean the favor of occasionally rejuvenating his liver, and so Dean saw no reason not to honor Castiel’s memory from the bottom of an endless bottle of whiskey.
Dean was swept up in the sudden onslaught of everything he hadn’t felt in months, by the base human need for touch, and by the feel of Castiel’s body against his.  Suddenly it didn’t matter that Castiel was male, that he was an angel – Dean only knew that he
“What’s wrong?” asked Dean from behind him, concerned.  It was early in the morning, perhaps 4AM, and Castiel’s tossing and turning had awakened him from a dream that was (for once) not about death and Hell.
“I’m going to pack up and head for Gaza,” Castiel said.  “I’ve got a contact there that found some pre-Biblical lore once in Michael’s possession.  It might have some references to the Darkness.”
Dean managed to get Castiel’s shirt off, and he realized, fleetingly – shockingly – that Castiel’s torso was, surprisingly, a
, Dean thought again, and then felt a twinge of guilt, followed by fear.  Naomi had been right, and Metatron had manipulated Castiel into helping him kick the angels out of Heaven – that much was obvious.  Castiel might be dead, or horribly wounded.
“Awesome!” Dean exclaimed, and went to work on his clothes.  He yanked off his socks, then flung off his pants, boxers, and shirt and added them to the pile.  He stepped into the tub gingerly, decided it could be just slightly more hot, and adjusted the knob until it was just hot enough to feel like an electric blanket.  He seated himself, let out an audible, “Ahhhh!” and leaned back against the side of the jacuzzi.
But then Joshua’s mouth opened, and for a second time was frozen.  Joshua looked like a grotesque statue… and then, with no warning, he exploded.
“Great,” said Castiel.  Dean felt that horrible squirming in his stomach again, and
August crawled into September, then October.  Dean had taken a break from hunting because Sam felt he needed to heal from being a demon (or something along those lines), and he quickly began to feel agitated.
, the kind he’d never had before, except for when Lucifer rose.  Even then it hadn’t been this strong.  A feeling that somehow, somewhere, the magical universe had been drastically altered.
Death said that the Mark could be passed to another, but Dean refused.  Instead, Death offered him a deal:  Death would transport Dean somewhere where he couldn’t kill any humans, in return for Sam’s life.
Castiel’s grace was almost gone.  There was enough left to begin to replenish and heal if he survived this ordeal, but that amount wouldn’t be sufficient to hold off the beast spell for much longer.  Would Dean kill him in the end?  He much preferred a warrior’s death to this odd, slow loss of control.
He reached under the pants that Castiel had taken (Dean knew) off of a dead vampire three weeks prior.  Castiel gasped, his back arching.  He palmed Dean through his pants at the same time as he thrust upward, seeking friction.
“Nothing much, really,” said Garth, friendly as usual.  “It’s nothing bad.  I just wanted to give you a bit of a friendly heads up.  He’s gone and died his hair.”
, for the first time since he’d last seen Castiel.  Sam had to ruin
Sam looked at him as though he had grown a second head.  “Of course he said it back,” he responded, still grinning.
“Hannah got me thinking about my vessel,” Castiel explained.  “I was unable to find either of them using a basic internet search.  I’m going to go to Heaven to speak with Jimmy.  I was hoping that when I get back, you or Sam will have more information on where I should go next.”
At the same time, Sam was wrong.  Cas
“Oh!” Castiel exclaimed.  He supposed this made sense.  “I didn’t know that.”  He thought for a moment.  “I… don’t have any money.”
Dean smiled, pulling Castiel closer to him, and gave a sigh of content.
“What are we supposed say to a publicist?” snapped Dean.
Castiel wasted no time sneaking a hand between them and tugging on Dean.  “Son of a bitch!” Dean groaned, and he could feel the angel’s smirk against his skin.
Still, there was nothing.
Castiel was visibly flustered, a rare look for the angel.  Something in Dean melted a small bit.  “Look, Sam’s right, okay?”  Dean said.  “We’ll work through our crap.  We always do.  But right now we are here to get you, get Kelly, and get gone.”
observant. Over all, he was fairly confident Cas' sour mood would soon be a thing of the past.
“We will,” Sam assured, not knowing what else to say.
a regular medical practitioner." Cas slid his hands up Dean's legs and gripped his thighs. "Do you consent to being used for unethical medical
“Were you... calling for me?”
“I was wondering if you needed to go to town today or if I should go by myself.”
As much as Dean loved the frottage, he knew perpetration for anal would take time, and he wanted to make sure he was properly prepared before he let Cas fuck him. “We should get started on the other thing. Gotta get me ready.”
“Dean,” Cas finally said, looking down at his hands. “I'm acutely aware of the importance you place on gender when it comes to intercourse. I also suspect that societal misconceptions relating to sexual orientation are most likely the
“I know,” Sam responds. “We’re gone a lot and being responsible for them might be difficult. But you haven’t seen Cas with them. Dude’s really attached.”
Dean froze. Shit, Cas had heard him. “No.”
“You mean your big gay freakout?”
Dean swallowed and let out a defeated sigh. “I just need time to think is all.”
“Can you describe them?” Sam asked.
“Uh, sure,” Sam nodded. “Why?”
When they got to the car, Kevin was leaning against the trunk next to Cas who had the prophet's phone in hand and was aggressively swiping at it with a finger. Sam unlocked the doors and went to the driver's side. "We should hurry before those assholes come after us."
Dean seemed pleased that Castiel had finally caught on and tenderly kissed his way from Cas' neck, over his collarbone, to the middle of his toned chest. Dean braced himself on the bed with one arm and brought his other hand up rub at one of the former angel's hardened nipples. "Like this?" he asked smugly and licked his way to the other nipple, swiping his tongue over the nub before capturing it between his teeth.
Shutting the door, he leans against it and rests his head on the cold glass. He must have made a pathetic sight last night; gulping down booze and questionable gas station pizza, until he passed out in the backseat.
"You want flowers?" Cas repeats confused.
Dean's jaw dropped. “Seriously?”
Dean feels relief flood over him for a moment, then his stomach drops. If they have been unknowingly under a love spell, then their relationship may not be real, but the curse has likely compelled them to do
Dean throws his head back to swallow down the last of the beer before climbing to his feet. “I don’t know, Sam. Yeah, we kissed. Then I shoved him away and told him not to touch me again.”
to shoot his load before it was even touched.
“Anything else,” Sam interrupted before Miguel could continue with his pointless rant.
mercy.”
"So," Dean said after a few moments, "dream-me's got nothing on the real thing, huh?"
"Well?" Sam asked failing to suppress a smirk at what he was pretty sure his brother was doing.
As Dean once said to Meg, "This ain't gonna go well."
“You weren't joking about waking up hard every morning,” Dean observed.
Sam takes a few horrified steps back and Cas shakes his head at both of them. "You were ordered to get plenty of rest," Cas states as he hauls Dean to his feet and starts half-carrying him out of the war room.
“Coffee’s fresh,” Dean says on his way to the door. “And don’t expect me to clean up in here.”
The bunker was empty when they arrived and Dean had a brief moment of panic before Cas explained that he arranged it with Charlie so they could have a few hours of privacy.
productive unless I do something about your arousal.”
," now Dean was picturing Castiel wearing a naughty Santa outfit and it just wasn't fair that he was pinned to the table and couldn't reach his dick. He cursed himself for not waiting until they finished cleaning up dinner, but in his defense, he was horny and really just hoping to get a quick blowjob.
,” Rubin said, winking at Sam and holding his hand out to shake again.
“Why wouldn't people wanna watch it?” Dean asked, offended. Not that he wanted anyone to, but he and Cas were good-looking guys and it wasn't unreasonable to assume that a lot of people would be into that sorta thing.
“It’s not for a case,” Dean responds. “Just lookin’ into something.”
Ah. Sam thinks he went out and picked up a towny. That doesn’t explain his attitude. “So, what’s your problem?”
again.” He glanced sideways at the ex-angel and noticed the bulge in his pants. “You gonna take care of that?”
"Dean, move!" Cas yelled, giving Dean just enough warning to get clear before the forklift slammed into the creature, its forks raised, impaling the thing and pinning it to the cement wall.
“Still,” Dean joins their hands where they’ve settled inside the warmth of the small nest, “it sucks I ruined our first kiss.”
“Was your shower unpleasant?” Cas asked, sitting on the edge of his bed watching television and looking way too proud of himself. He had in fact used up every last drop of hot water, as well as the motel's complimentary shampoo.
“So what, you just go around drugging people so they do...a buncha weird crap and then you take off with their stuff?” Dean asked. “How is that not theft?”
'You do make me feel good, Dean,' Cas responded and ran his fingers under the garter belts around each of Dean's thighs. 'I regret not doing this with you sooner.'
Cas' mouth quirks. "Sam was right, you are
“Alright,” Cas responded. “Sleep first.” He pulled off Dean's softening dick and flopped on his side next to the hunter.
While he waits for a reply, he sends a text to Kevin telling him to bring food. His phone buzzes when he gets new messages from both Sam and Cas.
"Remember when we first got there and you helped Cas with is shirt?" Dean nodded. "They were watching you guys out the window. I saw them looking, but didn't think anything of it at the time. Sorry."
“I guess you could say I have a vested interest in it,” she said, making no attempt to elaborate.
go to the bathroom in groups?" He grinned and waved in the direction of the man standing by the door and the two occupied stalls. "Shouldn't they be in the lady's room?"
“Shit, I figured you'd at least know the basics,” he said lightheartedly. “You're gonna have to stretch me out before you'll fit inside me.”
“Suit yourself.”
to wake up,” he mumbled.
“Funny, Sam asked me the same thing earlier,” she mused. “The answer is no, not even I could do that. And, by the way, someone uploaded all of the unpublished works, just so you know.”
“Gee, it's nice to see you, too, Cas,” said Dean sarcastically.
want to sleep with him, after
Castiel pouted, but a bit of clarity came back into his eyes for just a second.  He said, “Yes, Dean.”
“Point 1 for her,” said Dean.  “Just dropped that on the table.”
Meanwhile, Dean had managed to obtain the First Blade, the weapon that the demon Cain had used to kill his brother, Abel.  In tandem with the Mark of Cain, passed on from Cain himself, Dean was nearly unstoppable.  Near the end of May, he finally managed to use the First Blade to kill Abaddon.
“Dude, that’s bullshit!” exclaimed Dean, though he felt suddenly lighter.  It was as though every prayer was answered.
