Steve slowly and rhythmically ran his fingers over Tony’s back and mostly paid attention how his breath wafted against the skin of Steve’s neck. He closed his eyes finally letting himself relax into the content feeling he’d lost so long ago.  His breathing slowed and Tony tilted his head to press a kiss onto the side of Steve’s neck.
But…this was also the man who wanted Tony’s only son to risk his life for a chance at an illusion of love. Peter was obviously not in the right state of mind after his identity reveal and Wilson was clearly taking advantage.
! Chillax, Robocop! It’s just pizza!” Tony gasped, getting to his feet. When Bucky didn’t move he reiterated, “Stand down, soldier!”
“Thanks, J,” Tony murmured. Jarvis was pretty much piloting the suit at this point too because Tony could not tear his eyes off the man in his arms.
Steve sighed heavily and shook his head. He put his hand over his mouth, mindful of the number of SHIELD operatives in the room that could read his lips, and whispered to his boyfriend, “I thought he was over Natasha but he clearly is not. I offered to be there for him but he told me to drop it. I think he feels like he owes me too much already…I wish I could help him without making him upset.”
So on top of running together, now they were flirting right in front of him. His jealousy was instantly extinguished as the frozen bits of his heart broke and fell heavily into his stomach.
Tony had convinced himself everything was fine. He went to sleep okay later that night…but that was because Steve fell asleep first.
Howard was late to Tony’s High School Graduation. He and Peggy had been investigating a new lead. They came across a strange lab that had clearly been abandoned for years but it looked like some kind of super soldier research had been done there.
The man grinned madly and said, “Captain America, you would not believe how happy I am to see you here.”
"Sir, Agent Coulson is here and would like a word with you," Jarvis announced. The AI's voice seemed louder than usual even though it was at its normal volume.
“No, Peter!” Steve screamed and lunged forward. By he was not fast enough. Venom disappeared into the sewers. Steve tore off the grating and a piece of the street but when he peered down into the sewers he saw no sign of the symbiote.
I'm predicting the next chapter is going to be a looonnngggg one as it'll take a while for these couples to trust one another! ^_^
Tony grinned and motioned to his waist where a noticeable bulge was and stated, “Then I suggest you let me and Steve return to our activities, otherwise, you’re going to have to wait a while and get a very irritable Tony.”
“What...?” Tony said, dumbfounded at first but very slowly the anxiety started to bleed in with the fear of the unknown.
“We should also text Bucky,” Steve murmured, tucking his chin over Peter’s head as he snuggled the baby against his chest.
Tony looked around them. They were in Howard’s personal, private tent. It was a big upgrade from the one Tony had been using with the Commandos. It was much larger and could probably sleep six more people. Instead, it contained Howard’s large cot and several suitcases. Tony’s attention was most drawn to the cot since he was sitting on it and it felt like it had a 40s version of a memory foam travel mattress in addition to thick blankets instead of sleeping bags.
Steve watched him warily as soon as the truth was out. He knew this day would come but, even with years to prepare, he did not know how Tony was going to react or…or mourn.
Steve watched the entire process with amusement and was loving the way Tony and Pep were arguing for Peter’s interests. Steve would throw in his two cents once and a while but Pepper and Tony were a dynamic duo when setting up events and mostly had it down. They got this and Peter was going to love the end result.
Gasping for breath after pushing himself to run his fastest, Steve stared down at the photo, looking for any changes.
“We did go to bed very late, after a long day,” Tony murmured, laying an arm over Steve’s waist and snuggling closer to his chest.
Steve’s lips pinched more and he looked down as he grasped Tony’s hand and whispered, “I wish there’s more I could do for you…”
Steve stared at him wide-eyed and his mouth slightly agape. Tony suddenly took a step back and reevaluated what he just said and revealed. Some of what he spewed may have been a personal fantasy of his, dreaming that the reason Steve didn’t date was because of old 1940s fears…but, for all he knew, Steve himself might still hold onto those homophobic tendencies from his era.
Peter glanced down at himself and found he was wearing the same clothes he had on when Venom swallowed him. He thought they had been destroyed. Peter checked his sweater for his phone, but it was not there.
When Tony had his soul implant installed, it revealed he would meet his soulmate later in life. It was uncommon but not unheard of and he would be 40 by the time he met his soulmate.
He went to leave but paused and looked to Mary. She was created to bring about Venom but she did not know better and despite that she still gave him words of encouragement. He could not hold it against her. The one at fault was the Goblin. He asked her, “Are you in pain? Is there anything I can do for you?”
There were five other beds other than his own and beside each bed were machines. One of those machines was attached to Steve and he watched in fascination as his heart beat was measured by jolts in a line. It seemed to be monitoring other things but he was unable to discern what.
The confirmation from Tony was a blow he hadn’t been ready for. He’d been expecting it but hearing it from Tony’s lips was so much worse. All his grief and sorrow grew tenfold and felt like he’d collapse under the pressure. He couldn’t even look at Tony anymore and turned away from him and buried his face in his hands.
Tony grinned and, by the coloring, knew she had left them his favorite. He crossed the room and gently removed the delicate glass from Steve's grip.
“Did he say relationship problems?” Tony murmured under his breath and looking at Wade with a narrowed gaze. His eyes focused on Wade’s hands which held Peter quite familiarly. Would their future son
“I can’t unfreeze Peter without unfreezing it!” Wanda hissed, her arms trembling from the force of her magic. Peter was frozen with the look of shock marring his features whilst Venom looked like a demon of rage on the war path. Its mouth was open in a silent scream and it looked like it was close to biting Peter’s head off. What was most concerning to Wade, however, were the tendrils. A few looked to have pierced Peter though most had frozen just shy of his skin.
Steve flushed and said, “Natasha, once told me about ‘friends with benefits’ and I was wondering if that was what we’ll have. We’ll remain friends but we’ll also have sex?”
The description of my overall series is simply "Building a Superfamily is never easy..." which I take to heart in my writing. I know some of you are upset but I did not want to write a "and then they feel in love and lived happily ever after fic." There are bumps in every relationship and Steve and Tony are going to go over a big one. I wanted to not just explore my writing but,mostly, I wanted explore the person Steve Rogers.
. In addition, according to SHIELD’s files, he calls himself Thor Odinson, after the ancient Norse God of Thunder.”
Tony came to a stop in secluded area that would give them the privacy they required. Steve’s emotions were at war with themselves as he stared down at the shorter man. He couldn’t help but think him handsome, even now as he was frowning unhappily at Steve.
"You created a masterpiece," Tony whispered as he stared lovingly at the toddler in his arms. Steve put down his sketchbook and stared at both of them. His love for both of them was so overwhelming that he could barely breathe.
"Hey!" Both Steve and Bucky squawked even though Bucky was caught in the act, adjusting Steve’s arm brace as she said it.
Tony snorted and then said, “Alright, let’s start over.” He held his hand out to Steve and said, “I’m Tony Stark, thanks for trying to save me and putting up with my paranoia.”
Peter jerked around, half expecting the symbiote to be standing behind him. Peter was alone and the symbiote was still on his person…Peter was just hearing its voice like it was right there…not behind him but…but maybe…Peter gulped…in his head?
He cleaned up the lab the best he could. Most of the mess was around Tony with discarded food, empty glasses, and random notes on outlandish inventions that were created from his drunken state and could never work. He threw out the food, cleaned out the glasses in the sink and left them beside it to dry, and then stacked the notes into a neat pile and left them on his worktable.
“Stop hogging all of the warmth, jerk,” Steve murmured and wrapped his arm around him. Maybe Steve really knew why he was shaking, or maybe he thought to share the warmth. Either way, James leaned into his friend with a sigh and let his presence be a distractor.
“Natalia,” Natasha stated in a whisper. Tony’s head shot up and he saw Natasha staring at Barnes in anguish. She too must have seen the futility at this point. She also saw the man she once loved had no conscience. In a broken whisper, she continued, “My real name is Natalia. Once upon a time, only you and I knew that.”
“You all know me, know who I am. I’ve spoken you to numerous occasions on the street or right here at the podium. One of my most famous press releases was done right here when I told the world I was Iron Man…For a long time, I have been called a ‘superhero’ and I gladly took the title and all that it entails. But I never saw myself as one of the greats, like Captain America. That man stood for truth, justice, and the American way…and he’s the reason why I called all of you here today.
“It’s not fine, Tony,” Steve finally was able to hiss out of his constricted chest. “None of this is
Tony blasted his repulsor just as Steve ripped the man from his hold. Steve jerked as he took the full brunt of Tony’s repulsors at close range. The energy of the repulsor blasted through Steve’s chest, cutting straight through him.
“Since you’ve gotten your explosion quota in for the day do you two want to join the rest of us for lunch? We’re barbecuing.”
Steve noted the change in his emotional state and trailed his kisses back up Tony's body as he wrapped up his vows. He finished them, tracing his nose along Tony's jaw and whispering, "I love you, hubby."
The first time had been obvious. They were falling in love with each other, and both of them would’ve done anything to save the other, including changing the future.
“And who was it who killed Fury and tried to kill us for this flash drive?” Tony countered with a smirk.
“He lives outside,” Peter stated with sudden understanding. He jutted out his bottom lip and mumbled, “I miss outside…”
Steve slid into the luxury car and was surprised to see a carseat for Peter. It looked like Peter’s highchair with a gold body and red cushioning. The straps were the stars and stripes of the US flag and Steve instantly knew it was another one of Tony’s creations. The man thought of everything and managed to insert a bit of flare as always…
Tony chuckled wetly and whispered, “Thanks…I…I had-have a son too. He’s great and so smart and…” His voice trailed off, his throat too tight to continue.
Sneaky shook his head and murmured, “No, I would have heard. The only reason this one wasn’t known was because it was in such a remote location and all the notes on it had been lost…But I should look at it, just in case. I need to understand how this thing works before I step back into it.”
A few bullets hit the time machine and Tony instantly knew where his loyalties lay. It was with the machine. It was his
“…Just saying, there’s a reason Steve was so hurt by those pictures being taken. He may or may not have made certain assumptions—,” Natasha drawled.
Once his zipper was totally down and his clothed erection was peeking out from the parting in his pants, Tony’s fingers hooked under his slacks and boxer briefs. Tony licked his lips, inhaled slowly, and met Steve’s eyes. Keeping his gaze steady and unflinching from Steve’s, Tony pulled the final layers of his clothes away, sinfully slowly.
He used the cream Steve had gotten for him…even though his chest ached all the more whenever he pulled it out of his bag.
Steve whispered, “It’s not your fault. The fault lies with the people who created Venom, not you. If anyone is to be blamed it’s the Goblin.
Steve’s eyes focused on him and Tony carefully met his gaze. Steve’s eyes were searching his, for what, Tony could only guess. Tony dropped his eyes, hoping not to give anything away.
She still thought this was all an act for Tony. For all she knew, Tony was going to treat Steve like the people he had one nightstands with or he would tease his friend mercilessly. She did not know how crazy Tony was about Steve.
“Stay here,” Peggy commanded. “We’ve taken care of the forces in this area and are corralling the rest to the open road.”
“Do not say another word, Jarvis,” Tony sighed. “I did the math in my head. I know the possibilities…but I also do not know if Peter is still alive… For all I know, Peter is already dead and Steve is sacrificing himself for nothing. But if he is still in there –.”
He fell to his knees beside Peter. Tony tried to speak, his words were indiscernible, but Steve could read his lips. He was trying to say, “I love you.”
She lifted her gaze and directed her glare straight at him. She hissed, “It’s because of you, Steve.”
It also didn’t help that he was freaking out over the fact that he just shot his boyfriend through the chest at a close range and that a maniac had kidnapped him to do who knows what with him. So, yes, Tony was a little frantic and it may have picked up is blood pressure and made him hyperventilate a little.
Steve was not surprised when he saw a number of take-out bags sitting on the counter. The only things Tony knew how to prepare were coffee and burnt coffee. Tony was busily opening the cartons as Steve stepped in.
tonight. The whole reason for us to change venues was just for us to be able to relax around each other without the threat of our identities being discovered.”
The weirdest one was Natasha, who after learning about the contents of Steve’s “cure,” would sometimes watch Steve with a peculiar expression.
“We love you, Pete,” Tony whispered into Peter’s scalp. Steve smiled gratefully at him. He reached over his son and grasped Tony’s arm. Tony raised his gaze and meet Steve’s with a warm smile. Peter tucked his head into Tony’s neck and sighed contently.
Steve stared after him, frustration gnawing at his gut. The party guests looked between Steve and Bucky curiously, obviously wanting to know what had happened but no one approached either of them. Peter’s friends from SHIELD daycare had already forgotten about it and were running around playing what looked like a game of tag and Peter was ‘it.’
“Sir, your increased heart rate will make your window of time without the reactor smaller,” Jarvis observed.
His shield was with him, sitting on his chest, so he slid his arms into the straps and pushed up. The casket easily broke once he put all his strength behind it and dirt poured down on him from above.
They reluctantly parted and did not let go of each other’s hands until their limbs could no longer stretch and their fingers broke apart.
Aunt Tasha grasped Uncle Bucky tightly and drew him away. His uncle nearly tripped over his own feet, as if he wanted to stay rooted to the spot. Uncle Clint jumped off his stool as soon as the couple walked past him and followed them out. Uncle Thor helped Uncle Bruce to his feet and they were the last to leave.
And Steve would be remiss to admit it, but despite it being years since Tony had tried to initiate a romantic relationship, he still loved Tony too…
“I – I am going to get help,” he gasped. He fell out of the car and he saw a figure approach them. He gasped, “Help my wife. Please.
"I didn't touch that woman," Steve whispered frantically, as if he were trying to convince Tony of otherwise.
He relaxed his hold on Peter and peered down at his son. Peter was hiccupping and tears were still falling from his eyes.
“I personally like to think my drive to stay with you is stronger than whatever this was,” Steve replied. “…I think everything is going to be alright.”
Tony shifted in the bed to wrap his arms behind Steve’s head and then press his face to Steve’s. He could barely see him in the muffled glow of the reactor.
He sat in his bed, with his face hidden in his hands, what felt like ages. He grieved, he hated himself, and he worried for Steve.
“And you made her,” Steve replied proudly, no longer teasing, and Tony's chest puffed up under the praise.
“Well, sorry for the surprise visit, Steve…I…I was just in the area and poked my head in. I should probably go before Pep calls the authorities. I’ll see you later. It was nice to meet you, Sam,” Tony said, his voice was noticeably neutral but he could not help it. He feared the emotions that may show if he used any inflections in his voice.
Steve’s new uniform sat folded on the side table. He rounded the bed and checked out Steve’s new duds to distract himself. The uniform unfolded as he held it up and he was happy to see the bottom half of his uniform was going to be as tight as always on his ass. SHIELD was doing one thing right at least. Even though the fabric was armored and military grade, Tony already came up with a few spandex references to tease Steve about… that is, if everything turned out alright after Tony did his stupid confessing.
“You…You can’t just give up like this,” Steve stated tersely, tightening his grip on Tony for the briefest of seconds.
Peter raised his tube in acceptance of the cheers and then poured his DNA sample into the solution. Eddie did the same and they both put their tubes back on the try without looking away from their experiment.
Bruce helped both of them to their feet then helped Tony into the bed. His friend moved stiffly and Bruce winced every time Tony jerked. He must be in a lot of pain. Once Tony was settled Peter scrambled up the side of the bed to join him. Bruce also helped him with a light push. He gaped at his low weight and it made deepened his sadness for the boy.
Tony pulled out his hand and Steve moaned from the absence. He was about to beg for him to return them until he saw Tony pouring the lube on his cock. He grasped his cock then positioned himself at Steve’s entrance. He looked up and saw Steve watching him.
Wade squeaked and gripped Peter’s shoulders tightly and pushed him back. He gasped, “Wait, Pete! Wait!”
Bucky growled and rolled them over again. Natasha dug her hands into his throat and he punched her across the face. Blood immediately filled her mouth and she grinned up at him as her white teeth turned pink.
“Pe—,” was all Steve was able to get out before the beast that once was his son swallowed him whole.
Tony’s eyes stared into Steve’s chest and a pained expression crossed his face as he replied, “…I wanted to hear him call me Dad for years…I wanted to hear him yell it excitedly as he showed me a new invention…I-I wanted to hear him say it as he thanked me in his valedictorian speech when he graduated…I wanted to hear him say it when he recognized me for the over the top toast I gave at his wedding…
Tony kissed the corner of Steve’s mouth and murmured, “I gave you chocolate for Valentine’s Day but I don’t think I have ever given you flowers.”
“When my brother heard of the boy I had to come see him too,” Loki murmured. “…Though the rumor was the boy was son to the mighty Banner…not you, Captain.”
He felt no fear because it was only another monster his mind created and Wade knew not to fear those beasts anymore. Furthermore, Wade knew without a doubt Peter would be back in his arms and they’d snuggle until they both fell back into that content sleep. With Peter by his side, his mind erased all the real and fictitious monsters that haunted him.
“Rusted,” the Red Skull continued and James shot to his feet, dislodging Steve from his side with a single push. He could already feel it. It was like the machine had metaphorically stepped forward and was hovering ominously behind him, waiting for the rest of the words to free it. The hairs stood up on the back of his neck as he imagined the machine breathing deeply in anticipation against the nape of his neck.
“Looks like the base is ours,” Bucky informed Steve as he strolled up to him with his helmet tucked under his arm. “But we’ve got boys already reporting in that Schmidt got away.”
Cable didn’t turn around, but he did grumble something indistinguishable and kept working on the reactor.
“Fuck,” Tony hissed. Tony almost killed Steve’s best friend. What did Hydra do to that man?? He didn’t remember Steve and tried to kill him! First thing he’ll do when he gets back to his room is have Jarvis look into the Soldier and how they brainwashed him. Maybe out of all of this horror Tony could scrape out something to help Barnes.
Steve did not look convinced but he did not push the matter. He gently rubbed Tony’s back and murmured, “Okay…If you’re really…”
He and Tony exchanged messages as the day wore on, both of them missed each other and felt more wearied without the other there.
The audience’s volume quadrupled and, by the volume, he knew it was going to take them a moment to calm down.
He took the long way back to the tower. He drove down to the Lower Bay then made his way up the coast with the Hudson River on his constant left. Despite the hour, the river was busy with ships. The docks were bustling: unloading and loading crate.
They didn’t have a shower on board so Steve used one of his fresh shirts to rub off as much sweat and grime from the battle as he could from his face and torso. He then quickly changed into his spare white shirt and jeans. He still felt stinky after putting on the clean clothes but there was nothing more he could do with his time limit.
The corner of Steve’s mouth tugged upward and he wordlessly nodded. Tony was the same arrogant, annoying man he’d fought with but, it seemed, there was another side to him. And Steve wanted to find out more, the man was his soulmate after all.
He paused just to memorize Steve’s face and then shakily got out of bed. He couldn’t stay there or he’d start crying again. Steve would have been pissed if he saw what Tony had been doing the last few days and the thought spurned him into action. Pepper helped him out of the bed and he asked her, “Is there coffee where this food is?”
“I want to make things right with my dad but…I…I just don’t see how it’s possible because I'm still so upset with him,” Peter whispered softly into his shirt.
“It’s too late,” Steve whispered. Peter’s arms were free and grasped at Steve’s arms. Venom was almost completely off him. It was not long now. Steve quickly gasped, “I’m proud of you. I’m always proud and I will always love you.”
Jarvis and Maria stood at the kitchen’s entrance with Tony tucked protectively between them. Howard surged forward and picked up his son and led them to the front door and fresh air. They sat on the front steps with Jarvis pacing in front of them with his shotgun until the authorities arrived. Howard held his son tightly as the house was searched and the fire department called. Maria wrapped her arms around both of them and was deathly silent. All the commotion excited Tony at first but, eventually, the small child fell asleep in his arms.
Norman glared at them and, for a second, Steve could have sworn Norman’s eyes flashed red. Norman only let his contempt show for a few seconds before he donned a mocking neutral expression. He picked up a pen and began to write something down on the papers in front of him.
Tony grasped both of Steve’s hands, hiding the box within a cocoon of their flesh. His face was serious and silenced Steve.
“Yes, sir,” Coulson replied but internally he was groaning. It’d been weeks since he last spoke to him, but when it eventually got out that Captain Rogers is alive Stark will pounce right on it and never let him live it down. He continued, “My team and I will be in New York in the next two hours, three at the most. I will give you another update when we land.”
He typed out the message and the team tersely waited. Clint was clutching at the air and starting to hyperventilate.
Steve returned to Tony’s side but replied to Peter, “We can whip up whatever you’d like or raid a pantry for a quick bite.”
His eyes drooped and Tony’s heart leapt into his chest. He grasped Steve’s face and hissed, “No! Don’t go to sleep! What if you don’t wake up again!?”
He was jerked back into reality when he accidentally got too close and rubbed his erection into Tony’s inner thigh. The sensation rocked Steve right to the bone. It felt amazing but it also revealed to Tony that Steve was turned on.
Steve sat up sharply an eyed the large crowd uneasily. Tony grasped his hand and murmured, “Nervous?”
With his left hand encased in Tony’s gauntlet, he grasped Tony’s glowing right hand and it crumbled away, leaving the infinity stones to crawl up Steve’s gauntlet and press themselves into place just as they had done with Tony a minute before.
Her mate separated the distance between them and pressed the barrel of his gun into her forehead. He stated, “I need to tell my master why I had to
“No, I started to live with you and then started to rag you when it became apparent you do not know how to take care of yourself,” Steve replied.
Wade nodded. She was right. Peter was one of the smartest people he knew. He’d find some way to escape Venom or, at least, find a way to notify the Avengers of his location. He just had to believe in him, wherever he was…
Steve just said was so adorable it made me want to kiss him all over! If you told her how you felt you might elicit a similar reaction.” Steve grinned at Tony as his statement made him want to kiss him too.
When they reached his room, they shed their clothes and tumbled into his bed, laughing as they tickled each other. Wade was most beautiful when he laughed. His eyes sparkled and his smile was filled with the upmost joy.
Steve laid Peter down in his own tiny bed and sat with him until he fell asleep. Steve slipped out of Peter’s room, closing the door quietly behind him, then checked on Bucky. The other man was right where Steve laid him, still asleep, utterly exhausted by the events of the day.
“I’m sending this to your phone,” Tony said with a flirtatious smirk to Steve. Steve grinned excitedly and lay his head on his shoulder to watch him send the message.
“Better safe than sorry,” Tony retorted. He began to walk toward the elevator and Steve fell in step with him. Tony asked, “You coming too?”
He sat up sharply, gasping for air, and his eyes desperately searching for Tony in the empty room. His memories of the dream world instantly became fuzzy but the actual memories came back to him in a heartbeat and the fear remained.
blade was in his fingers and he was lazily deciding where to throw it while his subconscious handled more serious matters: Peter.
“Quick! To Dummy!” Peter exclaimed. He grabbed his friend and dragged him in the direction of the robot. Dummy squeaked and sped away from the boys. Peter gasped, “Wait, Dummy! We have a time limit!! I just want to show Harry the gears on you Uncle Tony let me fix!!”
Tony’s heart suddenly felt lighter and he grinned excitedly at Steve. He had to know so he asked, “Steve – don’t take this the wrong way but…how long has your body been like this? Please say you’ve always been bi and you’re body is not just reacting to sexual stimuli?”
They shared another kiss, this one was slow and they breathed as one, sharing the same precious, life-giving inhalations. Steve’s hands trailed under Tony’s shirt, feeling for his lover’s heartbeat. It fluttered just to the left of his arc reactor. Steve gripped his pectoral and kneaded the flesh and drew his thumb over his nipple. Tony hissed sharply into his mouth.
Tony’s heart was ripped apart from this: he was angry for his parents’ horrible murders, sad for Bucky’s unwelcomed fate, and – and,
Thousands of scenarios flooded his mind and he was already coming up with half a dozen sarcastic replies that would make it seem he was unaffected.
Peggy’s eyebrows rose a fraction and now she too glanced between the two of them curiously. She did not make any comment however and rolled up the map with a nod. Bucky and Monty walked over to Peggy as Steve went to Tony. Bucky looked between the two of them with a pinched brow.
Steve understood immediately and winced. He lightly covered Tony’s fists with both of his hands and whispered, “Who told you? Bruce? Or Jarvis?”
He threw clothes into a duffel from his closet, not really paying attention to what he got and hurried out of his bedroom.
“Someone’s attacking the others?” Steve gasped, his mind ruing with possibilities. Mainly, could Kilian have survived and come back for revenge?
They finally settled on one where they hadn’t even been looking at the camera. Steve had taken it with both of them unaware when they’d been sitting off to the side at an Avenger’s barbeque. Peter was sitting between Wade’s legs and had one arm wrapped around Wade’s shoulders. They had only eyes for each other and were both laughing. There was no questioning the love between them as their faces hid nothing.
Coulson’s eyes spanned the room looking for more clues. He garnered the most from the couple. Potts and Stark were tense and they traded uneasy glances when they thought he wasn’t looking.
He pushed the thoughts aside and went to follow through on Steve’s orders. He rose above the struggling pair and flew over to the motherboard of the helicarrier. He took the chip out of a compartment on his arm and zeroed in on the chip it needed to replace.
In the heat of the moment, both Bucky and Natasha seemed to have forgotten that they were only supposed to be demonstrating how to punch for Peter.
Thor turned back to him. His blue eyes clouded with worry and his brows pinched with concern. Asking, no louder than a whisper, Thor said, “Heimdall?”
Tony unbuttoned the top two buttons on his shirt and Steve shivered as he felt the ghost of Tony’s finger’s brush against the skin of his throat. Tony patted his chest, right beneath the open neck of his shirt, making his dog-tags clink together.
However, he soon he found himself just sketching simpler things like Tony's smiling face, the shine from the sweat on his shoulders, or the concentration in his hazel gaze…
Steve smiled warmly at his boyfriend and murmured, "I think I will be more upset about not seeing your eyes as you enter me than whatever aches I might get from it."
Steve stepped up behind him and placed the coffee under Tony’s nose. It was something he always did to grab Tony’s attention it felt almost silly doing it now. He felt like a different Steve did it and the current Steve was stepping out of place. Tony’s nose twitched then he inhaled deeply, his nostrils expanding to take in the robust smell. Behind his reflective goggles, Steve could not read his eyes and it made him a little uneasy.
“Sir, I believe I may have found one of the subjects on your Priority List,” Jarvis stated and Tony sat up sharply.
“Uncle Tony made my sad go away by doing dis,” Peter explained and stretched out his mouth with both pointer fingers and exaggerated gagging noises.
“We’ll be fine, right, Buck?” Tony said more to Bucky than Pepper. Bucky looked at him strangely but nodded all the same.
Whereas Tony had Steve to cling to for support, Wade's hands had nothing…He supported himself by leaning into the wall and his eyes clung to the screens before him like they were his only chance at human comfort. Even when Steve went to his side and tried to physically comfort him himself, Wade still only looked to the screens. Tony innately knew Wade looked this way because of Peter. If Tony were in his shoes and it was Steve in that room, he'd probably look the same as him.
Peter’s eyes were no longer cold but were pleading and, even though she logically knew she should not do it, her metaphorical heart was pulled in by Peter’s beseeching eyes. She knew she could not deny him.
. The man sitting in front of me is a wise, joyful, giving, heroic person. You are someone I have always looked up to. I don’t think you are vain or old or a mess. And I take care of you because I want to. But most importantly, I love you.” He paused to measure Tony’s reaction to his words. He could see the muscles twitching in Tony’s jaw as he clenched his teeth.
Tony clumsily embraced him. At first, he tried to wrap his arms around Steve while holding the large glass bottle and boxy invention but both got it the way. Tony looked down at the objects with a torn expression then decided to put down the vodka in favor of Peters creation.
“Pete would probably love to give you guys a demonstration if you’re that curious,” Tony said, poking Steve’s chest lightly with a smirk. “Now enough about that shield, you need to help me find a birthday gift for Peter!”
“Steve?” Tony whispered, his voice harsh with concern and he clutched Steve’s leg with his weak grip.
“What have I been talking about for the last half hour?” She questioned, “And, in that same amount of time, what have you been doing with your suit?”
Tony’s faceplate slammed shut and, with a blast of his repulsors, he went flying into the sky. Steve watched him go wide-eyed and with a slack jaw.
Tony’s bloody hand lifted as if to ward off the Goblin but it dropped before it could touch him. It was enough though to show he was alive and Steve launched himself across the distance separating them.
Tony leaned into his side as Steve and Bucky tossed barbs. Natasha and Stepan continued to eat but watched both of them in amusement. Bruce and Peter were building something on Peter’s plate out of the remains of his food while Betty overlooked with a smile. The Barton children were egging Thor on to see how many hot dogs he can eat in a minute. Clint and Laura were laughing at their children’s efforts.
“Work from here, Tony,” Pepper whispered. “You are too weak to operate the suit right now but you are fine to use a laptop.”
Steve shifted his feet uneasily. His heart was torn. He wanted to run, to prevent the future from changing anymore but…but this was the closest he’d been to Tony since he’d died in his arms and – and Steve couldn’t stop staring at him. He was every bit the man he loved and remembered: from the determined set to his shoulders to his unwavering gaze. He was half tempted to remove his sunglasses to see him in a better light but forced himself not to in case Tony would finally recognize him.
When Steve reached the garage, he paused at its mouth and took off his helmet. He looked up and studied the skyscrapers around him.
Steve clenched his hands, feeling useless. Ever since Tony was first captured he’d felt so incompetent…and it was building into an oppressive force, threatening to crush him under its weight.
It was built similarly to a MRI in that it would fully scan his body so it was big enough to fit him. He made his to be stepped into. It was open and airy and not at all confining like a regular MRI and was basically a white backing and the front was the scanner itself. It was a complete circle that slowly rose as it scanned every inch of his body. The scan would only take a few minutes, not the usual MRI half an hour as it was calibrated just for Tony. The machine hummed to life and Tony closed his eyes and both hoped and feared the results. He listened to the scanner’s hum as it got louder and closer to his head and then above it…
Steve ignored the Red Skull in favor of focusing on one important factor in trying to escape: he wasn’t healing as quickly as he used to. The cold room and the handful of bites they fed him weren’t enough to sustain his healing ability. His entire body ached with cuts, bruises, and burns. The Red Skull was relentless and it made Steve weaker for it.
Peter flushed. He and Wade were now lovers but did that truly amount to love? He’d known the man for years but had only just started dating him. He couldn’t already be in love, it didn’t happen that fast…right?
He did not know what to expect. In the deeper most corner of his heart, he had hoped for a joyful reunion. He had wanted Bucky to tell him the shooting had been a mistake, that he remembered everything, and that he wanted to return to Steve…Despite his wishes, he really expected to be attacked.
“How about no?” Tony retorted, he did not want him to check out of SHIELD Medical just yet. Peter yawned heavily and leaned back into Tony’s chest. Peter’s big blue eyes were almost indistinguishable as he followed Steve’s pacings across the room.
Steve was quick to escape his underwear and help Tony out of his. He then pressed Tony back down onto the bed and traveled down Tony’s body to stay true to his promise. He took Tony in his mouth and had him orgasm into it.
Thor was close behind Tony and ran into the room, demanding, “How fairs –?!” The Norse God grinned as soon as he saw them and he announced, “Then we are victorious!”
Steve grabbed Sitwell’s shoulder and hissed to the others, “We’ve got to get out of here but we need to take him with us. He can get us into Hydra.”
Wade smiled widely, stirring a pleasant warmth within Peter’s chest. He brought their faces together and they kissed with so much feeling Peter felt dizzy from its intensity.
“It's ‘cuz he likes you,” Steve replied, smiling warmly at the other man. It made Steve happy to know Bucky liked Tony.
And then it opened its mouth and Tony’s stomach dropped as he figuratively fell off the edge of that cliff.
He felt Venom try to manipulate his emotions again, only this time Peter pushed back. He yelled, “NO! I will not eat another person! A superhero doesn’t do that! A hero saves people! A hero doesn’t hurt people!”
“They were antidotes provided by the Goblin. He had some sort of connection to your mother. Whenever I did not know how to respond, I simply remained silent or brought up stress of my confinement to deflect any questions,” Mary replied.
“What is it?” Steve asked apprehensively. He felt helpless on the other side of the country. Immediately, his thoughts came up with a number of dastardly villains at the door.
“It’s fake, Rogers,” Steve reminded himself. He and Tony may kiss a few times for the cameras but that was going to be the extent of their relationship. After the trial was over, they would fall back into their roles as friends and pretend this never happened. The thought certainly put a damper on his hard on.
Howard shook his head and murmured, “It’s far fetched, even for you, Pegs. I have enough on my plate to worry about, nonetheless worrying over a phantom murder like you are implying.”
“What can I say?” Tony said with a sly grin. “When a hot, naked man calls me handsome I take notice.”
Luckily, no one was in the hall so neither had to account as to why Tony was going into his room. They walked quickly to his room and both practically jumped into the room as soon as the door opened. Steve swung the door closed and laughed when Tony jumped on him.
“The syringe that was in your soulmate’s neck contains a concoction of my own making. Used on a super soldier, it slows your heart enough to force you to pass out. But on a normal person, it stops the heart altogether.”
“Furthest thing from it, babe,” Tony replied. He reached out to Steve and said, “Come to bed, I’m lonely.”`
Wade nodded and Peter’s face became quite serious. Wade would have teased him if he weren’t teetering on the edge of orgasm.
Tears were still falling from his eyes, but they were happy ones. He air-high-fived back and then hastily whipped away at his cheeks.
She gently grasped his hand and whispered, “You shouldn’t part with this looming over both of you…Tony is really sick. If you wait too long…”
Steve squeezed Tony’s hands one last time and faced forward. He murmured to the judge, “Sorry, your honor.”
Bucky must have somehow neglected to mention their relationship when they stepped out to talk. Steve flicked an annoyed glare in his best friend’s direction. He was probably trying to do it to protect him but if Gabe could keep Tony’s secret, he could just as easily keep Steve’s.
Peter put all his focus on imagining Venom ripping itself from his body but nothing happened…in fact, Venom contracted tighter around him.
Steve crossed the room in a matter of seconds and demanded, “Are you positive it was her? Mary Parker. Her name is Mary Parker. Is that the name of the woman who works for your dad?”
“We’re the same age,” Tony stated. “Exactly the same age. I calculated it, from the day you crashed since your last birthday…I added it all up and well, from here on out…I’m going to be older than you…”
He and Tony exchanged glances. Tony was still in the kitchen. He was no longer making coffee but was now in charge of making the mixed drinks at the bar. Ben and Sam were waiting on him to blend something. Tony shrugged when he caught Steve’s eye as if he was saying, “Maybe things are better.”
Stark frowned and Natasha could easily read that he did not want to go. She gave him a look that she had mastered when she was his PA for a short while. It said “listen to me or you will regret it.”
Not that Peter did not enjoy his aunt embarrassing the hell out of him, but he found that he and Wade suddenly could not impose any longer.
“We win the war,” Tony replied and the man grinned. The American soldiers listening in were a little more animated and high-fived or laughed. Tony continued, “Who is in charge of this operation? I need to work with them in order to find the Red Skull faster.”
“Hi, honey,” Tony said sweetly. If Tony had not done something so stupid Steve would have melted upon hearing him use such a term of endearment after what Steve did.
The men and women in the white lab coats began to strip him of his ruined clothes and wipe away the blood. The Avengers mutely left to give him some privacy. Tony remained by his side like he promised and Peter continued to sleep in his arms, not waking from the exchange from Steve to Tony.
Venom had melted away down the storm drain and Steve had fallen to his knees in the seconds it took for Thor to reach him.
Steve chuckled and felt his shoulders relax. They had tensed ever since Tony left but he was coming home now. If he was open to a sexual activities then he was certainly giving Steve a chance. He hadn’t lost Tony yet. Everything was going to be alright.
Rogers groaned and Cable lowered the blank photo to watch the man come to. As soon as his eyes flickered open, Cable stated, “You’re a self-righteous idiot.”
! Hundreds of people were dead or injured and all he wanted to know was an irrelevant personal fact about Steve!
Hulk stared at the dark screen of the flat screen for a few seconds before looking back to them and yelling, “Hulk want Disney!”
“Howard is a consult and is not bound by the army's regulations,” the super soldier retorted with a grin.
Tony would never have attempted this in the future. He would’ve just created new cores, he would’ve never used a damaged one like he was forced to do now.
With a blank face, Tony stared at the spot on Steve’s arm he had just been touching a moment ago as his brain slowly processed Steve’s rejection.
Coulson removed his phone from his pocket and pulled off his thick glove in order to properly dial Fury.
Encouraged, Steve became bolder with his mouth and opened his mouth wider to knead the muscles beneath the flesh with his lips and better taste him. Tony's skin had just a hint of the bitter aftershave he used that morning but underneath that he was salty goodness that filled his mouth and coated his tongue.
, Harry. I want to see her! My parents keep pushing back our meeting…If you got a chance to see your mom again, wouldn’t you take it?”
Tony turned back to Bucky and said, “My home is your home. You’re going to live here from now on. I’m going to make you a new arm and then you are going to live your life how you want to.”
Tony guiltily glanced down at the suit parts. He had taken it out for updating but all he had done was open it up. Nothing had been updated… and what was Pepper talking to him about? It was something about stock prices, wasn’t it? But was it good or bad?
Grinning widely as joy surged through him and filled with boundless energy, Tony excitedly gasped, “Let’s pick a present!”
Steve leaned into his elbow and peered at the both of them with a small smile. Years prior, he would have never thought the two of them being together was possible. Yet, Natasha had opened her once locked up heart and Bucky readily let her into his fragile trust. They were a quiet couple and did not openly show affection but, when they looked at each other, their gazes showed the true depths of their love for each other.
“D-Dr. Banner,” Peter gasped, his face became beet red. He stepped forward and held out his hand. Bruce took it and they shook hands. Peter said, “Your work in gamma radiation research is amazing! I have read all the articles you published! My powers came about from a gamma radiated spider bite!”
Pepper rolled her eyes and a small smile tugged at her lips. She patted his arm and said, “You’re a good person, Tony.”
“J…” Tony sighed heavily. His heart was slowing down and Tony’s insides were a strange mix of emotions. He murmured to his AI, “Make yourself scarce. Give us a moment.”
Peter had thick dark brown hair and inherited Steve’s sky blue eyes. It was warm out so Steve dressed him lightly in the clothes he had just bought him days prior. The little boy spouted a Captain America shield on his shirt which his father took pride in whenever he looked at his son. It was the closest thing Steve had to labeling Peter as his own other than their shared genetics.
Vision turned to Tony and said, “I do not think Venom is purposely trying to hurt Peter. Peter is his host. It cannot survive long without him. I hypothesize the ‘crushing’ Peter is feeling is Venom’s attempt at fusion.”
The white eyes of Wade’s mask narrowed. He’d always wanted to ask how Wade did that but he also felt like it was an answer he did not want to know. Wade suspiciously stated, “You may be an Avenger BUT you’re not a Stark employee and it is impossible to break into the fair. I know, I’ve tried. Stark hires the best security every year to protect his people.”
“But how does this precognition come about from spider gamma-radiated DNA?” Steve questioned. Hydra had infused Peter with the spider gamma-radiated DNA when he was still a fetus in his mother’s womb. They wanted to create a super-soldier stronger than Captain America and if Peter truly had precognition along with his healing ability and strength then they had succeeded.
He felt one of them try to pick him up but he shook the person off and threw the agent across the room. He leveled his glare at the others and snarled, “Get off of me! I’ll kill you! I’ll—!”
And his baby boy’s eyes just widened in surprise…and then focused on Wade as they returned to normal size…and then kept closing.
He had seen Peter cry out of frustration, cry from exhaustion, cry out of stubbornness, and, worst of all, cry because of the memoires he had from being an experiment in Hydra. Despite all those times, he had never seen Peter cry like this. He had never seen such terror in his eyes. It was almost like he knew his demise was possible.
He jolted to a stop in the hall when he saw Natasha standing outside of his workshop. She had her head tilted toward the door and was obviously listening in. His eyes immediately went to her neck. The bruises were now greenish with yellowing edges. He guiltily looked away and met her perceptive eyes.
Steve dragged Tony to the elevator and Bucky tried to follow but his legs shook too much for him to do so. He fell back onto his barstool and Natasha hovered to his side, looking concerned.
“I don’t care what you say. You deserve everything and so much more. I’m going to get you bundles and bundles of flowers,” Tony promised as dug his fingers into Steve’s scalp. Steve pushed him down and hummed noncommittally as he continued kissing the area around Tony’s reactor, his mind already on other, better things.
Steve pulled Tony’s jeans down to his knees and nibbled at the flesh just above the waistband to his boxers. His chest was pressed into Tony’s waist and he could feel him hardening beneath him.
“She is not going to kill them,” Steve scoffed. He sat on the ground next to Peter and Peter paused in his stretching to give Steve his full attention. Steve continued, “Your aunt is going to give them the same lecture she just gave us, but she might be a little harsher on Uncle Bucky. And I doubt she is going to stop training you and I bet she has already forgiven you for the duplicity…And, no, she does not have mindreading powers.” Steve chuckled on the last statement but as he thought on it, he realized it was no laughing matter. Natasha with mind powers was frightening.
Tony thought he would have to be the one leading but he gladly let Steve take the reins and relaxed into his side. He eyed him curiously, not knowing what else to expect.
“Your allies on Midgard have gone through some troubling trials since you were last there,” Heimdall stated.
“Your preliminary hearing has been scheduled for next week,” Tony stated and the smile melted off Steve’s face too.
“We’ll finish cleaning up and do it after the bath,” Steve murmured but made no move to grab the soap or shampoo sitting in the corners.
Hulk had become melancholy and was quick to shrink in his depression, leaving Bruce to stare desolately at one of Peter’s toys that had been left on the couch. He was doing much better than Bucky who was rocking to himself on the other end of the couch and refusing to speak. Natasha sat next to him with a hand centered on his back, rubbing small circles into his flesh.
It actually took 50 minutes for everyone at the fundraiser to eventually realize Steve was Captain America and, even then, most were too shocked to process it or disbelieved it. He saw many on their phones, holding up their devices, comparing Steve’s face to the old black and white ones the internet had of him from World War II.
Steve called the team to return to the tower to hold a debriefing. He was more than happy to leave SHIELD to deal with the Fantastic Four.
“What is it?” She called from inside. Steve and Tony paused at the bottom of the porch stairs and looked to the door as they heard May make her way to the front of the house as the old floor boards creaked beneath her tread.
Steve chuckled and they fell in step with each other as they returned to the cafeteria. Steve's eyes were instantly drawn to Tony and he smiled at him. Tony smiled too, though he looked a little confused, most likely from Steve and Bucky's sudden, hasty exit.
Cable smirked and murmured, “Try playing only one round of Bejeweled and you’ll be singing a new tune.”
Tony took a steadying breath and stopped in his tracks. The infinity stone hidden in his stolen briefcase felt like it weighed a ton. His heart was beating wildly and, behind him, Howard Stark, of all people, told him, “The door’s this way, pal.”
Tony grasped his cheek and made Steve look back at him. Tony promised, “Then I’ll tell you what happened and I will happily redo any kisses you forgot or we can make so many new memories that you would’ve been bound to forget the others in the meantime…” Tony traced his thumb over Steve’s cheekbone and whispered, “No matter what, you are my soulmate and a few memories won’t change that.”
“We-We’re going to have to do it again,” Steve stated what Tony was most likely going to allude to. They were going to have to make out again…Steve both longed and feared it. Could his sanity and heart handle it a second time?
It was glowing again and the placard around it was a shining halo, looking like it had never been broken.
Aunt May looked at Peter sympathetically from her place at the island and Steve got to his feet at the breakfast table.
A burst of flavor exploded across his tongue and he moaned appreciatingly. Wade’s resulting smile was so big that Peter could see it through his mask.
His AI’s prime directive was to protect Tony and being in the past put Tony at risk 24/7 so Jarvis’s protective instincts were at an all-time high.
“I know you will…” Steve whispered back, gently squeezing Tony’s hand. Tony stared at him with a pained but determined gaze and Steve stared back, not wanting the moment to end and to have to let go of him.
Howard's sincere words reminded Tony that his father had dedicated years of his life to find a cure for Tony and had even looked for Steve to put him to rest.
Peter’s eyes immediately narrowed and he glanced warily between the two superheroes. He stated, “No one needed to tell me about him. He raised me until he died.”
What he wasn’t expecting was Tony to punch him in the nose with enough force to knock him off his feet. Pain was dull due to the dream but Steve still felt a sharp pinch and blood dripped from his nose probably because he imagined it.
“The first thing he’s going to ask me will be: Where the hell was I?” Tony hissed, bordering on hysteria. He was crying but didn't even notice thanks to this horrendous news. “And what am I supposed to say? ‘Oh, I was avoiding you by sleeping with random strangers and being an alcoholic!’ He’ll love to hear that!”
Her implant beeped shrilly as her mate’s instantly lost power and died. Her implant would have a line of zeros burning into its screen but she did not look at it. On a normal day, this would have meant her soulmate’s heart had stopped and he had died. At that moment, however, her soulmate lived but wouldn’t be alive for much longer.
The silence between them felt more noticeable to Tony after that. He went back to work on the arm but continuously looked up to Bucky, wondering what he was thinking about. Was he reflecting on memories of Steve? Or maybe he had no memories…just a feeling?
Or…maybe he was interested in him but just…just not in the same way Tony was? It wasn’t like Steve but…could he be experimenting? Was Steve merely exploring his newly freed gayness? Was he not looking for any attachments?
And then Steve jerked as Venom stabbed him with hundreds on tendrils just like it had done with Wade. Steve slumped in his hold and slowly warm blood started to soak into Peter’s clothes.
Tony his sadness overwhelmed him and he had to stop typing in order to rub the instant moisture from his eyes. It only made it worse, however, and his tears came out in hot globs of water that burned his eyes. Tony covered his eyes and tried to even out his breathing to suppress his sobs.
So those of you who have read my other works, you know I like to take y'all on emotional roller coasters of feels.
On the way to his room, they kissed almost lazily. In the elevator, Wade pressed him into the wall and kissed his neck with unhurried lips. In the penthouse, Peter would randomly tug Wade to a full stop just to steal a quick but standstill chaste kiss. And finally, in his room, Wade cupped his face and kiss him similarly to when they first started dating, like he was the most precious thing on the planet…which was probably true for Wade because it was so for Peter.
One of the mercenaries hit him across the back of his skull before he got the chance to open his mouth. He fell and was unconscious before he landed on top of Steve.
Steve sighed and knelt next to Peter. He put a hand on his shoulder and murmured, “Uncle Tony is fine…he’s-he’s just being an idiot.”
. So much so that he will eventually be begging you to kill him in the end…So, as you’re sitting here, imagine it. Imagine breaking your soulmate and knowing there is nothing you can do to stop it. Imagine his blood on your hands. Imagine drawing that blood from his body, drop by tiny drop.”
“None of us have spoken to Jane or any of the others about Peter,” Natasha stated grimly, her glare never wavering from Loki.
Steve sighed heavily and replied, “Me. I am the biggest idiot out there…” He stepped away from the door and sat next to Natasha’s legs on the bed. She silently waited for him to elaborate and Steve carefully continued, “I let myself get overly involved with… our ‘make out session’…God, Natasha, who am I kidding? I loved it. And all he loved about it was fooling the paparazzi…”
“Cool, I'll get those and you'll go take a nice long shower,” Peter said, pushing Wade in the direction of his bathroom.
“...Sir follows the teachings of many wise men,” Jarvis stated. “One of his favored, Mahatma Gandhi, stated, ‘The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is an attribute to the strong.’ Sir is anything but ‘weak,’ Master Rogers.”
He looked down at Peter and felt his heart drop when he saw his eyes were closed. Wade lightly stroked the side of Peter’s face and urged, “
…He was starting to get tired of people telling him they were there for him…like he needed a shoulder to cry on. He didn’t want them to treat him differently. He felt like they wouldn’t stop saying it and would continue for the rest of his life.
Steve ventured to Tony’s side and groaned, “I almost thought we were making some progress there for a second.”
Steve ripped off his shirt and kicked off his own shoes and went flying at him. He did not hold back and tore into Bucky. He did not worry about hurting him or worry about bringing out the Winter Soldier, all he wanted was to release his frustration and Bucky made himself a perfect target. Not that Bucky needed him to hold back, he was a super soldier himself and fought with just as much intensity.
“Hello, beloved, how goes the doctoring?” Tony asked, his eyes more focused on whatever it was he was doing when he answered so he did not seem to notice the baby in Steve’s arms.
“Yes!” Steve jumped to his feet and pointed to the metal building they led him out of. He said, “She’s there! Kilian has her strapped down to this gurney and she-she was glowing!”
“Shut up,” Steve hissed, not wanting to hear his weak reasoning to back up the lie. Peter had needed him and Steve had failed.
“No, but I am placing the tower on lockdown and informing the rest of the Avengers. The projectile entered the room you and Master Roger currently occupy. From what I can deem from my sensors and video feed, it was a single bullet.”
Tony turned to him and whispered, “Stop apologizing, dummy.” He bent down and pressed a needy kiss onto Steve’s mouth which Steve greedily accepted. Steve cupped the back of his neck to pull him in closer. Tony broke their kiss gasping, “Kissing you never felt so good as it does now.” He leaned back in and hungrily kissed Steve again, exploring Steve’s mouth like it was the first time all over again. Steve returned the kiss with a similar feeling, reminding the man he loved that he was alive and they were still together.
Tony’s heart flipped in his chest. The only other time Steve had told him he loved him was in that video from Schmidt but now here it was, for real, and in person. Tony knew before he was kidnapped that there was something there, but to hear it aloud…It made him feel like the happiest man alive. Steve loved him. Despite everything they had been through, they still had each other and were in love.
“Friday already has the bots working on my new hand as we speak,” Tony stated. “It’s going to be like Bucky’s, but flashier.”
Tony seemed to sense a change in the air because he sleepily woke from his doze and, as soon as he saw Bucky, grumbled, "You better get over here and give me a hug before you leave."
“THIS IS SHIELD! WE HAVE WARRANTS TO BE HERE! STAND DOWN OR YOU WILL BE SHOT!” Somebody exclaimed behind him.
relationship? I mean – we’re going to have to be convincing – we’re probably going to have to kiss and what not.”
Peter had laid his head on Wade's lap and he turned his head to glare at the mercenary. He said, “Are we all forgetting about the alien? You know, the thing the story is named after?”
Bucky usually enjoyed the time off by scouting out the local villages, seeing if there were any bars open, or a pretty dame looking for a date with an American soldier.
I've been doing a lot of overtime with only one day off a week and its been exhausting...I'm hoping it will end soon because it's just burning me out and I want to write my fic! DX
Tony laughed and Bucky's smile grew into one very close to the genuine one he remembered back in the 40s.
Steve squared his shoulders. He could do this. He’d learned a lot in the USO. He could act. He could pretend he was not affected by what Tony had done.
Howard had told both Maria and Jarvis about Peggy’s suspicions last night. Neither still knew about Tony’s eventual time travel but they were now aware someone wanted all who helped create Captain America were being picked off in “accidental” deaths.
Steve caught his shield a second later then collapsed first to his knees then onto his back. Steve lightly touched the communicator in his ear and gasped, “Great shot, Clint.” He fell onto his back with a groan, clutching the shield to his chest.
It was night and the room was awash in shadows. Bucky’s eyes gleamed in the darkness, reflecting off the streetlamp from outside. In his hands, Steve could make out his fingers running over the barrel of a gun.
Norman watched Stane fiddle with his tablet outside the property. Stark had given his mentor complete control of not just his company, but his life as well. With a few swipes of his finger, Stane was able to shut down the AI.
The Soldier found he couldn’t eat. Something was wrong. His chest was constricting and he could not even his breathing.
“You are so cute,” Tony gushed then pulled him down into a kiss. His words took Steve by surprise and it took a couple seconds for Steve to respond to Tony’s kiss. Steve closed his eyes as he returned the kiss and leaned heavily into Tony.
“…So you just knew?” Peter murmured, thinking of Wade. He never even considered seeing a man until they first flirted at the fair.
But…with quick touches to his neck and a hand hovering over his mouth, Steve confirmed that Tony still lived.
Venom slid several tendrils across Steve’s throat and smothered his voice, leaving unable to tell Peter to run himself. His head was violently jerked back and Tony’s eyes snapped back to him and opened widely with alarm.
Venom took Peter's chosen form of the black Spider-Man and Peter grinned to himself as he admired how cool he looked.
Pepper came to pick them up. Steve, Tony, and the rest of the team left together. His friends were coming as a show of support and would sit behind Steve during the proceedings.
He asked around camp and got turned every which way but eventually made it to the command tent. He could hear Colonel Phillips inside with his loud booming voice directing his subordinates where to set up what. Steve should be nearby... he was a part of the chain of command.
Scratching the back of his neck awkwardly, Peter asked, “Please don’t give me too much details but, what about the physical aspect?”
He stared at her, as if he were trying to assess that she was real, and then, with a rough voice, said, “Hey.”
He wrapped his arm around Iron Man’s waist and they flew up the tunnel to the outside. In his ear, he heard his son ask, “Pops?”
Tony let Steve lead the way and, as soon as he reached the bottom of the stairs, all sound and movement in the kitchen ceased.
Even Friday didn’t notice and the AI was always watching. Venom was probably disguising itself just as it had disguised itself as his shirt.
Either way, he awkwardly raised his hand to wave goodbye to him. And as he wondered whether it was in good manners to wave to someone flying away or not, the arm of the lab coat he had borrow dropped and exposed his lower arm. In the panic to escape, Steve hadn’t thought to look at his soul implant.
“I hope not,” Tony retorted. “If we have to go to the Wild West, I would literally tear out my hair. I went crazy enough with the lack of technology in the 40s…”
Tony had only revealed the full extent of what had happened to him in the past to Pepper and Rhodey. SHIELD was very interested but Tony was never forthcoming. Coulson cooled down after that and offered his help, clearly curious, but Tony didn’t take him up on the offer and told the man all he needed were the files. The files he was given, however, were mostly a bloody ledger of the bodies the soldier had left behind.
Tony sighed heavily and said, “Jarvis, you might as well call back that cleaning crew. Looks like they have another mess to clean…Plus order us a new fridge…and microwave…in fact, get a hold of my contractor, the entire kitchen needs a remodeling…”
A tiny kernel of hope fizzled to life and just barely fused a few pieces of his broken heart together.
His host was rejecting him but Venom could not leave. He would die without his host. BUT his host would not work with him and eat the proper nutrients Venom needed!
But they also enjoyed each other’s company. Steve wasn’t as noble as his father or the movies made him out to be. He was crude and funny and a dick sometimes but Tony ate it all up. They could sit down and talk for hours. Tony particularly loved hearing about Steve’s past. There was so much the history books left out on because this man was not the perfect man they made him out to be. He was so much more human with many quirks and weakness that defined him more than his ability to throw a shield or bench press more than humanly possible.
“And you know I’m a battle tactician who comes up with five different things that could go wrong on the spot! We’re not one hundred percent that we hadn’t changed the future too…”
Tony made Peter a mock workstation that mimicked pieces in Tony’s own workshop. Peter played on it constantly. It made noises, lit up, and holograms set off fake sparks similar to the real ones Tony worked with. The mock workstation was located on the edge of Tony’s workshop and had a protective shield between it and the actual workshop just in case something went wrong with Tony’s work. The shield was clear so Peter could watch Tony with a critical eye and imitate what he was doing.
“I also blamed myself, Peter. To block out the pain I drank and I made risky decisions in my life and business. It was only years later that I realized I was squandering away what Yinsen sacrificed his life for and from that point on I knew I could not continue my life mourning him...Think on it. Would Gwen want this? Would she blame you for what happened? Would she approve of how much you blame yourself, Peter?”
Wade trembled at his words and Peter thought nothing of it until Wade’s breath hitched. Peter’s eyes snapped open and he pulled back as Wade gasped, “No-!”
He wanted to open his eyes to reassure Tony but could not find the strength so instead he smiled, drawing the corners of his mouth up slightly and exposing his teeth.
“Language, Cap,” Tony dryly chuckled. Steve’s tongue only loosened when he was really upset and, from experience, Tony was really the only one to bring it out of the super soldier.
“Ugh, the dopamine stench coming off you is ridiculous,” Logan grumbled, rubbing at his nose. “I’ve never smelt someone so smitten."
Tony looked down with a flush, not wanting to admit to the truth in Steve’s words. He grumbled, “Fine.”
“Anomaly?” Tony questioned. He had paused in his work to take a break and was about to pop a blueberry into his mouth but froze upon Jarvis’s announcement. He lowered the tiny fruit and leaned forward as he said, “Do go on…”
Tony chose that moment to finally follow them into the kitchen. He stopped as soon as they came into view and he worriedly demanded, “What did I miss??”
With a sigh of relief, Peter whispered, “Oh, thank God.” He fell back onto the bed and ran his fingers over Venom. It was still wrapped around his wrist in disguise of a watch. He relaxed and felt his exhaustion weigh down on him. He shooed his parents away, saying, “Now that it is decided, let me get another hour or two of sleep.”
Sneaky opened up for him and, for a second, he could have sworn he smelt the old stone of the Hydra base underlined with the evergreen pine from the nearby forest. Tony stepped into the suit and it closed around him for what could have been the five hundredth time.
“YOU-!” Clint hissed, breaking the silence with his angry outburst. He jumped off the couch and the popcorn bowl went flying from his lap. Natasha practically threw Peter at Tony then launched herself at Clint. She got him in a headlock and brought him to a shuddering halt only a few feet away from Loki.
Steve ran his thumb over his bottom lip and remembered the wondrous feeling of Tony’s lips on his then sadly replied, “Yeah…I know…”
Steve was standing in front of him and Wade slowly released the tension created by his surprise. Steve had been standing on the other side of the room only moments ago and no one else seemed to notice their leader had crossed the room to speak with the dreg in the back.
His lips twitched into a small smile and he cracked open his eyes to see Wade hovering over him. Wade smiled widely as Peter cracked open his eyes and he gently cupped Peter’s face.
“All the Avengers have sustained minor injuries but nothing catastrophic, Master Parker,” Jarvis replied promptly. Peter nodded, expecting as much. No matter how strong they were they could still get hurt.
Tony clawed at his chest with his free hand gasping for breath. He tore open his shirt and his nails gouged into his own flesh drawing more blood. His arc reactor glowed an ominous blue against his deathly pale skin.
!” He grasped Bruce’s arm and hissed, “I…I need to tell him how sorry I am. Hurting him nearly killed me.”
“Then answer this…out of everyone here, who is the Fuddy-Duddy?” Bucky asked, looking expectantly at Steve with a hint of a smile hidden behind his gaze.
Tony flailed his limbs wildly as he escaped Thor’s hold and yelled to Steve, “I am not leaving without you!!”
“My brother and I came when we heard word a child was born to the Avenger clan,” Loki informed them and, to Steve’s surprise, he gently placed Peter on the ground. He stepped back and Steve charged to his son. He snatched Peter off the ground then jumped out of Loki’s reach. Peter clutched him tightly and Steve wrapped his arms around him, trying to encase Peter in a cocoon of his flesh.
In the 40s, Steve had been ashamed of his attraction to men and before he started dating Tony, his attraction to Tony embarrassed him. Now everything they did was so natural and Steve could not imagine going a day without kissing his boyfriend or telling each other that they loved each other.
Tony landed next to them a moment later and gently placed his hand on Peter’s chest. Peter’s suit gave a light pulse in response as Tony connected to it.
Once upon a time a man named James loved a woman who hoarded the name Natalia…but that man was gone. Even though she said he was buried somewhere within him, the Soldier knew the man she once loved was no more. He was destroyed by his master.
She was led back into the courtroom by the bailiff. She was poised with an indifferent expression again and showed none of the fervor from when Steve testified. She pointedly did not look at Steve until she sat at the witness stand. She only met his eyes for a mere second but in that small interval she found the time to haughtily smirk. She cast her eyes elsewhere and the nervous bile that had been bubbling unpleasantly in his stomach suddenly boiled over with rage.
None of the kids in the neighborhood had ever seen Steve shed a tear about his implant…that didn’t mean he never had. When he was old enough to understand what the lack of numbers in his implant meant and what a soulmate was…he cried. He cried so badly he had an asthma attack and was bedridden for days. He had drawn the short straw in life and he let himself wallow in the unfairness for a short time.
“What are you going to do?” Steve asked breathlessly, “Charge me? In the middle of the close corridors of a waiting room? Do you realize how many people can get hurt?
He was so relieved that his Aunt May was already in bed when he got home. He hoped, with his advanced healing factor, the cut would be gone by morning. If it was not, he had going to come up with another lie about what happened to him.
He waited for Eddie’s return before touching it and, instead, fiddled with the drawers and cabinets, seeing what went where and familiarizing himself with the layout.
Steve marveled as they entered the loud room. The various machines made noises even when not being used and a few kids clustered around and exclaimed when a friend beat another level.
It hit him then. How was he going to keep his identity as Spider-Man a secret now? People were going to be following him, his movements were going to be tracked by the paparazzi!
Wade subconsciously looked down at himself, wishing he had changed before seeing her. His state of dress was going to make this so much more worse…
Wade wildly nodded his head and picked Peter up as Death faded away. Turning to the remaining Avengers, he shakily asked, “Wh-Where do I take him?”
The first was Bruce. He came in with a small gift and went straight to Peter saying, “Happy birthday!” He hugged Peter and then added his present to the mountain of presents Tony had gotten Peter. He joined Tony in the kitchen to grab a coffee just as Clint and Thor came in.
In his mind, Coulson compared it to the great discovery of King Tut and felt as excited as the early explorers must have felt.
He paused as he remembered the nano suit. He could still feel the odd sensation of the millions of tiny robots crawling on his skin.
“…There might be a way to help Peter,” Mary whispered, staring at the ruin of her innards. “Venom was not created from scratch. He was originally a symbiote created to eat cancer cells. It was flawed and the project was thrown away…that is how the Goblin got his hands on it. It cannot live without a host but it was not originally created to fuse so singularly with a host. It will take time for it to permanently bond with Peter. There might be a chance to separate them if the bond has not been totally completed.”
“Your big, smart brain is the reason,” Steve countered, grasping Tony’s hand and walking him toward the house.
Steve turned from him with a sad smile and took a step toward the door. It looked like he was going to end the conversation. Tony's hand shot forward and he grasped Steve's hand to stop him. Steve appeared shocked by the move and he looked at Tony in confusion.
Dark storms clouded the horizon, mirroring Steve’s despair. He never thought up anything for the landscape but it was usually an empty field that went on for miles and only ended at the wall Tony had constructed.
As soon as he caught sight of his dad’s expression, Peter’s lower lip wobbled and then he ran across the room and into his dad’s arms. His dad automatically wrapped his arms around him and whispered in surprise, “Peter?”
Jarvis wasn’t kidding about the chest pains. It felt like Steve had pulled him into one of his tight hugs and forgot to check his strength and just wouldn’t let go. He rolled onto his back, gasping from the effort, and wildly searched for Steve. He was still on the bridge and struggling with the Winter Soldier but was noticeably distracted as he kept looking in Tony’s direction.
Bruce looked back down into his microscope and missed the slight flush that stained Tony’s cheeks. He was happy for himself too.
The entrance to the building was mostly glass so he found it easily enough and was outside a couple of minutes after breaking free. He kept running down the street, not slowing in the slightest until, well, until he started to recognize the street signs and then realized he was truly in New York. He stumbled a little over his own feet but regained his pace, taking in the sight because…because this was not the New York he remembered.
and being ousted in the forties meant being arrested! And we can say we didn’t tell anyone about our relationship now because we wanted to keep it private! Tyler can claim you raped her all she wants but with your alibi, Pepper’s testimony as to why she was fired, and your dating
Tony sighed and then began recounting his childhood memories. Steve silently listened and felt detached from the situation even though Tony was mapping out his last moments.
Tony’s eyes immediately focused on Steve who was tying off one of the larger tents. Steve jumped to his feet and happily gasped, “You’re here!”
“Mighty good drugs then,” Peter replied. He picked up his head and lightly pecked Wade’s lips and then flirted, “Are you a part of my prescription?”
Norman stared at the boy and wondered what had happened. Harry knew not to disturb him when he was in his office. He also knew he should not approach Norman with trivial matters and was to wait until Norman asked him of his needs.
The price was Venom not being able to settle. The symbiote crawled all over him and tugged painfully at his skin. It could never completely hide. Steve’s clothes were a part of its skin but the remaining of its body hid under the fake cloth and in the shadows of his hood.
Hmmm, is the next chapter a chance to reveal my love of classic rock or does it contain a literal or figurative clue? Hehehehehe
Steve took the papers and flipped through them quickly. He commented, “One more meeting then Air Force One and then arrival at secure location…Where’s the location?”
Peter lifted his head as he opened his eyes and smiled lightly at Wade. His boyfriend must have been keeping an eye on him. Peter reasoned, “I think I ate too much sugar.”
Peter looked down at his hand again and found it whole. Peter put two and two together rather quickly. Pops and Cable must’ve gone back in time and fixed everything.
if the same thing happened to you. Beware of Hydra’s bite, Tony…” Tony felt a twinge of jealousy toward this Howard. Why was he being so affectionate to his son? Howard continued, “Where there are two heads there’s twice as much teeth. Don’t you dare let that monster sink its teeth into you.”
