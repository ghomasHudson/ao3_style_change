"Agreed," Cas added, his voice dropping into that deep thoughtful tone that Dean could imagine sinking into, "This seems more… pre-abrahamic."
When they got to the morgue Dean went through the motions effortlessly, flashing his fake FBI badge at the same time as Cas to the mortician. She was a small nervous looking woman with curly permed hair who bounced slightly as she shifted her weight from foot to foot like a child who broke into the freezer and ate one too many popsicles. Dean gestured to Cas and made the usual speech.
"So," Jack started, drawing out the word slightly, "does this mean it definitely isn't a vampire?"
"Well mam, we'll get to the bottom of this. Can you give us a moment alone to look over the body."
He knew they would have to hand over the book in the end, but something about the way Sam asked the question made Cas hesitate. "I don't know why she wants it, but we'll deal with the consequences later. We have to get Jack."
The angel wrinkled his brow and pursed his lips slightly. "It don't know it."
Hey all! another update, still just kind of moving the pieces in place so that the plot going forward makes some kind of sense, obviously more exciting things will happen going forward. In case you're curious, the song quoted at the end is The Rain Song by Led Zeppelin.
He felt a cold hand on his chin. It tilted his head up and he was staring into the face of death. She was going to take him now, he was sure of it. She would take them all. He was shaking, his molecules vibrating faster, almost matching the rhythm of the universe.
"It's a power grab, it has to be." Sam's eyes were darting back and forth like he was figuring out some puzzle they couldn't see. "With Chuck gone there's going to be a power vacuum, and who else can fill it but her?"
Dean grinned and shouted back, “Hot damn!”
"Oh go ahead, go ahead, not sure what else you think you're going to find though, I couldn't even open up the chest and look at the organs it's so dried out so I shouldn't have missed anything."
"No," Jack turned from shuffling through his bag to face Sam, "I already know how to do that, I want to examine the body. If I'm going to be useful I have to learn everything."
They continued trading off parts until the next refrain when they picked up the format they had last time.
She was going to break through and only God, Amara, or The Darkness could stop her. God and Amara were out of the question which only left…
"The only thing she's ever wanted is order and balance." Cas' eyes were stony and distant. He seemed a thousand miles away, and all Dean wanted was to grab him and bring him back to earth, but they didn't have that luxury right now.
“Oh, yes, and very powerful,” Castiel says in his most serious voice, and she smiles wide, lifting her chin up.
Dean watches them all, heart full. This is all he’s ever wanted.
Castiel sits, his weary body welcomed by the soft cushions, and once he’s settled, Dean places the back of his hand on his forehead. “Hmmm,” he says, and Castiel can tell from his expression that he’s still a little concerned. “At least you seem a little cooler now. I told you the soup would work.”
[PRAYER 278]
Despite his grace still being gone, the smile that Cas gives him makes the ache in Dean’s muscles fade to nothing, and even after a year, the novelty of him being back hasn’t worn off. In the bliss of the evening, Dean is lost in him.
He hangs up, rubs the half-dried tears from his cheeks and turns the key in the ignition again. In the silence Dean lets himself think.
“Sam,” Cas chokes out, a small smile on his face.
“I’m trying to work out when they started letting angels rest in Heaven.”
“That’s not how things work, Deano.” Meg’s smile is cold, not like the old Meg’s, and it makes Dean’s hair on end. They’re so close now. He can’t fail now.
Castiel crouches down, and before he can scoop up a handful of water, he catches a glimpse of his reflection. The face staring back is caked in dirt, and the skin under the eyes is sunken and dark. The person he’s looking at looks old and tired and nothing like Jimmy Novak. Is this what Castiel making a home in his skin looked like? He tries not to think about it.
into the surface, but he realises it’s not enough. The space is filled, but that emptiness within remains. Cas is still gone.
Cas’s eyes open slightly, like waxing crescent moons. They’ve been a compass on Dean’s bleakest nights, and guided him home too many times to count. Dean gets to repay the favour now.
“I tried to stop him,” the vampire finally says. He shakes his head, a crease between his brows and a small smile on his face. “I tried and tried to convince him to leave without you. He wouldn’t budge. He’s a stubborn one I’ll tell you that.”
Even half a year later, the tree was relatively small, still in its nursery pot, but the hottest Kansas spring on record and his tireless fostering had meant that now it was studded with dozens of little red cherries. In the sun, Castiel thought they twinkled like rubies. Squinting his eyes, he took one between his thumb and index finger, and carefully twisted it, studying the surface – there it was, that rich burgundy he’d waited so long for. Today was the day he had imagined all those months ago.
That was a nice tradition, Castiel thought. “In that case I’ll take a slice with the deformed flower please.”
Shielding the sun from his eyes, Dean turns to face his boyfriend and asks, “You ever want one?”
It finally dawns on Castiel that it isn’t that Dean needed to know how to leave Purgatory; Dean thinks it’s his responsibility to get Castiel out.
When Dean turns his back, Castiel takes one last look at the man he owed everything, and then he is gone.
“Yeah, yeah, don’t go getting soft on me now.”
“We’ll have this garden fixed up in no time,” Dean says proudly, taking a swig from his bottle
“I’m gonna’ check the perimeter. Why don’t you guys rest up? We’ll need to move again soon.”
Remembering that they’ve never met, Dean stands up and turns to Cas. “Cas, this is Miracle.”
“Purgatory has an escape hatch, but I got no idea if it’s angel friendly.” Castiel doesn’t know if the vampire is covering nicely for them or not. It’s hard to tell with his heart beating so hard against his ribs he can hear it in his eardrums, and his focus involuntarily switching between Dean’s voice and the threat of leviathans.
Cas seems to be as speechless as Dean is though, and the expression on his face, a winded, tired, deer in the headlights, leaves Dean all the more so.
“Researching? You caught a case?”
. It felt so right – sounded so right on Dean’s lips. Dean wanted him to be a Winchester – the greatest honour there was, and Dean wanted to give it to him. He’d never realised how badly he’d wanted a surname until that moment, and now he was being given the best one of all.
“Hey,” Dean soothes, “yeah it’s me.”
Then Castiel hears Dean clear his throat, and he looks down and smiles. It’s the first time he’s smiled in a while.
His eyes move across the stream as he straightens up. He can’t feel any leviathan. He checks again.
Castiel said his goodbyes, and Dean went to help Jack pack his bags into Sam and Eileen’s car. Castiel was alone in the garden, sat on an overturned bucket by Kelly’s flowers, and glancing over the memorial stone. There was more of a breeze now, and the hyssop petals, radiantly purple against the green of the stems, danced in it.
He’d done it. He’d finally done it. It had taken him a year, but Dean is finally home.
Castiel rolled his eyes. That’s more like it.
Castiel can’t help himself. “If you hadn’t noticed, you’re already dead. You wouldn’t exactly be losing a life. And I assume you don’t enjoy being here – that spending forever where you’re perpetually preyed upon isn’t something you want?” The vampire’s smug face falls a little, and he raises an eyebrow. “If you help the human, he’ll take you with him to Earth.”
Dean hangs up the phone, eyes never leaving Cas, who is staring at the ‘C’ scratched into the table’s surface.
“He had his fair share of ailments growing up.”
Dean’s eyes are serious. “For everything,” he clarifies, and once he is satisfied that Castiel understands, he lets go of his hand and resumes eating.

an authors note on the finale:
Just when he thought he knew everything he could know about him, Castiel is surprised again by Dean Winchester. He imagines that freckle-faced boy, lost and afraid and unable to turn to anyone but the stars in the sky for comfort and, as childish as it sounds, Castiel wishes he were the angel that put them there.
After the one hundredth tree he’d passed that day, and maybe the millionth he’d passed since being here, Castiel is stopped in his tracks when something catches his attention. The tiniest trace of humanity. It was something he hadn’t felt since arriving in Purgatory, and how it is glorious.
“Thanks, Sam, but it’s over.”
If he doesn’t though, he’ll never get to say it back. He’ll never get to let him know. He’ll be stuck in the Empty, not knowing how much he meant to Dean, for eternity. He’ll never be at rest. He’ll never know peace.
He’s still real.
“And if leviathan wanna’ take a shot at us” he pulls a face like is the most casual thing in the world, “let ‘em. We ganked those bitches once before we can do it again.”
“Sam? Did he get sick a lot?”
“You ran away?”
Flashes of green in the window pass behind him, and his black hair stands out for it, and his skin slowly finding its colour again, Cas seems to glow in the early morning light.
“I love you, and I tried not to. For years I kept it buried, because what we have – what it means for us – it scares the crap out of me. It scares me more than anything ever has. But do you know what’s scarier? You not knowing. You being in that godforsaken place forever and never even realising that I feel like this too. So, you gotta’ hear me, man. I love you, okay? And you have me, all of me, always. I was already yours, Cas.”
Dean is still standing there, watching Castiel with eager eyes, and it’s obvious that he’s not leaving until he sees him try some. Castiel turns his attention to the soup. He can’t deny that it’s wonderfully warm in his hands, and from what he can smell, although he can’t smell much, it doesn’t seem too offensive. Surely if Sam is still alive it can’t be that bad. He gathers some on his spoon and brings it to his mouth. To his surprise it’s not bad, although it probably helps that he hasn’t been able to taste anything for a few days now.
Dean goes back to his book, skimming the words, searching for any mention of the Empty. Still standing in front of him, Sam clears his throat and steals Dean’s coffee from across the table. Looking up again, Dean watches Sam sip it as he takes a seat at the table and opens one of the many books from the unread pile. They catch eyes, and Dean offers his brother a thankful smile. Then they both get to work.
Castiel leans down and kisses Dean softly, bringing him to his feet. When he’s standing again, Dean pulls Castiel in closer, his heart thumping hard against Castiel’s chest. When Castiel reluctantly draws away, Dean catches his arm and brings him in again, planting one more kiss on his lips.
“Cas,” he starts, his voice quiet and earnest, “is that what I think it is?”
Not again. He can’t go through this again.
If this works – if he gets Cas back-
Together, he and Freya blow out the candles. He sits back and opens his eyes, and he can’t stop the tear that escapes over his lid. He looks up at Dean, who’s brow was pinched, and offers him a smile. He wants to explain that he’s okay – that he’s just so overwhelmed, and that it’s still so unfamiliar to feel sometimes, especially this intensely, and that he just needs a second, but all he can do is offer that weak little smile and hope Dean understands.
“He really cares about you, y’know.“ Benny looks sincere now, and he’s holding Castiel’s gaze. “God knows why,” he continues, a smirk on his face, “but he does.”
“You can. Benny tell him.”
Sam nods, looking down at the bottle he twists between his hands. After a moment, he looks up and raises his bottle. “To everyone we’ve ever lost.”
“I brought you back because I needed to. Because you deserved it. Because my life, no matter how good it is, is always emptier without you.”
He would only be putting Dean at risk if he stays though. There were too many monsters altogether, and whilst Dean might be an exceptional hunter, Castiel thinks maybe one of the greatest Earth had ever had, he’d be overrun with this many at once. Even with his help, if Castiel stayed, Dean would most certainly be dead.
Driving back home, Dean keeps an eye on Cas in his periphery. He’s disappeared one too many times in the time he’s known him, and he’s not about to let it happen again. Not this time. This time, he’s here for good.
[PRAYER 145]
“Okay, okay, the sofa then.” Dean says, and places a hand on Castiel’s elbow to steady him as they make their way over. He only leaves Castiel unsupported for a few moments while he gathers some pillows, and then he’s right back and guiding Castiel to his makeshift bed.
“Cas, please, listen to me, because now I know I’ve gotta’ say this.” He takes a breath. His heart beats against his ribs, and suddenly all that running has caught up to him and he feels like he can’t breathe again. Somehow, he finds it in him to speak.
“Cas?” Sam laughs, already going in for a hug.
cherry pie.”
Hope buds in Dean’s burrowed chest, and his eyes, tired to their very sockets, jump from the page in front of him to his brother. “What is it?”
Dean suspects he’s been wanting to for days now.
Dean nods his head, and Castiel can see how his face has fallen since he’d first seen him. He’s disappointed. Castiel had been expecting that look. “That’s a good question.”
Castiel doesn’t see, but a small half-smile develops on Dean’s lips, the corners of his eyes crinkling slightly. “Hey,” he starts, before placing a kiss on the crown of Castiel’s head, “I said in sickness
Dean snickered and put an arm around her shoulder, giving her a quick squeeze and a kiss on her temple before pointing to one of the fruits. “Do you wanna’ try one?” he asks, and she nods again, this time more enthusiastically. Dean looks around, pretending to make sure the coast is clear, and  picks one of the raspberries, holding it up to the light and blowing on it before handing it to her. As he does, he puts a finger to his lips. “Don’t tell Uncle Cas,” he says, as if Castiel would ever have the heart to deny her anything, and then he twists one off for himself, throws it up and catches it with his mouth.
There were rumours, that a new Death had risen up and parted the Empty with one swoop of his scythe, collected his prize and left again with destruction in his wake like he had no more cares in the world.
There was no hunter without his angel having his back.
They would tear Heaven and Earth apart for each other, or so the stories said. Everywhere they went the trail of bodies was enough proof and the people who survived knew one thing for certainty. Their love was powerful, impossible, and deadly.
There were rumours more than that. This new Death didn’t just court trouble, he bowed to it. That he, with his legions of reapers to command, those angels of death who flocked to him, all that power thrumming through him, the power over life and death; he who was raising the son of Satan, the new god; who dined with the Queen of Hell and made peace with Heaven; he with his witch brother and family legacies; he of all those contradictions of power was the one to submit to the angel. That Death got on his knees and worshipped at the feet of a Broken Angel who fell harder and farther than one could have imagined.
“John, he never-?“
He knows that Benny is right. It would be more than a shame. It would be devastating. That still doesn’t mean that Castiel deserves to have a friend like Dean.
“What you said before you left. Me too, okay?”
That’s when Dean decides. Cas is going to carve his name in that table himself, and Dean can deal with the aftermath, whatever it is. He can live with the consequences, but he can’t live like this.
“It’s just a pie, Dean.”
Castiel doesn’t register that last part. “Dean, no. What if you get sick?”
There’s a box in the corner that catches his eye. It’s the last of the boxes from the Bunker that he needs to go through. He hasn’t touched it since he moved in.
“Yeah, you get used to it after a while,” Cas jokes.
“Dean, he was a Nephilim. There was never going to be a normal for him.”
“Of course.”
“Well,” Dean finally manages, steadying himself against a chair, “I guess that’s it then.”
Dean’s voice says it all. He’s disappointed and hurt and that slither of faith is disappearing right in front of Castiel's eyes. He knows he shouldn’t, but his automatic response is to defend himself. “I had to.”
“Guess you’ll have to watch the movie with me later then,” Dean teases, stealing a kiss, and before Castiel can even calibrate his surroundings Dean is rushing down the stairs, Miracle closely behind him.
There was the time at North Cove when watched the life burn from his body. When he dowsed him in gasoline, and set him aflame.
He still can’t bring himself to look though, and after he gets his books, he turns around and makes his way back to the table. He’ll just wake Sam up next time.
Cas doesn’t push him to the ground this time, and in the safety of his arms, Dean’s sure nothing could pry him away now.
“That goddamn trench coat. The officers must have thought he was ridiculous,” he says to Miracle, who has taken a seat next to him.
“Whatever time it is, it’s too early,” Castiel grumbles, letting his open eyelid fall closed again and pulling the covers up over his face.
Sam’s words are genuine, and Dean appreciates the gesture. They help him feel a little better, but then his eyes catch the
Dean clenches his jaw and tries to keep himself still where he stands. “No. You see, you don’t know him like I do.”
“Dean?” Sam’s gruff voice comes from behind Dean. “Why are you still up?”
Castiel quickly spun around, hiding the pie with his body. Before he had a chance to make himself look anymore presentable, Dean was in the doorway clutching a pack of beer. He was wearing that green shirt that Castiel loved on him – the one that matched his eyes and made his skin look even more sun-kissed than usual. The pink bridge of his nose, sunburned from falling asleep outside the day before, was dotted with hundreds of tiny golden freckles. Castiel could barely breathe. Dean always looked handsome, but today he found him almost incomprehensibly beautiful.
Castiel is frowning in disbelief now, but Dean is insistent, pushing the bowl closer to him. “Cas don’t make me take that spoon and feed you myself,” he says a little more serious now. “Trust me on this. You’ll feel better in no time.”
“There’s a spell. It’s basic. The won’t be a problem getting you out.” Castiel doesn’t know this to be true, but the vampire doesn’t need to know that.
The door might close. Dean needs to get them out of here.
To his frustration, when Dean turns back, Sam is still seated. His patience is wearing thin. Cas has been in the Empty for a month now, and every second that Sam is wasting is one too many Cas has to spend there. When he studies Sam’s face more clearly though, he notices that his eyes are glued to the floor. That’s when Dean knows it’s not good news. Sam always does that when it’s not good news.
For the first time in a long time, Dean falls asleep, completely unburdened.
Dean stands in place for what seems like forever, Sam’s eyes fixed firmly on him. “There must be another way. There’s always another way,” he says, his voice small, unconvinced by the words himself. Doing this all again makes him feel like his knees could buckle any second though. His head pounds, his eyes sting.
That’s when Dean can’t hold back any longer, and he pulls him into the hug he’s been waiting for. The one in his dreams. The one he’s been wanting for too long. Like he did Cas’s parting words, Dean clings to him, holding him tighter than he’s ever held another living soul. He just needs to hold him. He needs to make sure he’s real.
Castiel could hardly believe what had just happened. Dean eating fruit and calling him pretty? If it weren’t for the fact it wasn’t possible, he would have thought he was dreaming.
Dean continues, “You feeling okay?”
The thought of giving up makes everything worse. It guts him, makes the cement in his throat come back, but he can’t do this again. What makes it worse is Cas would understand. Cas wouldn’t blame him if he stopped trying. That was just like Cas. He always understood.
Doing his best to act casual, he replies, “I would argue that he gets it from you.”
He’s beaming as he moves to Castiel, Jack following closely behind.
After they finish eating, Castiel finally gets his turn with Freya. They sit in the sunniest patch of grass in the garden, cross-legged, and Castiel tries his best to split the stem of a daisy and start a chain.
It seems to work, because the next thing out of Dean’s mouth is, “Okay, I know the cake looks terrible, but you don’t have to cry about it,” and Castiel sniffles a laugh. Realising that he hasn’t even looked at the cake yet, he blinks back the rest of his tears and, remembering to breathe, focuses his eyes on what was in front of him. There it was, round with white icing, uneven and patchy in places, and in blue squiggly letters, slightly left of the centre, were the words
Fuck. It’s his mixtape.
Castiel looked up as he spoke. Strokes of orange and pink rested on the horizon, the light dimming as the sun retired for the day, and the lilac clouds were soft and fleecy. With everyone gone, the garden was quiet for the first time that day, and Castiel focused on the soft hum of the bees as they moved from flower to flower, the hushed chatter of crickets from over the fence, and the bird’s mellow chirping, the sun’s lullaby, from where they nested in the trees above. One bird’s song was a little louder than the others, and particularly musical, and he was reminded of Freya’s giggle.
Dean’s soul still bears a hole left in Cas’s shape. It always will. Everything is getting a little easier now, and every good day Dean has is one more than he ever expected. He has to remember that.
He’d fallen asleep with his shoes on.
He’s angry at Chuck. He’s angry at himself. Worst of all, he’s angry at Cas, and that realisation makes him sick to his stomach.
There’s the “I told you so” Castiel had expected earlier. “Soup still isn’t medicine,” is all he can manage to come back with.
Castiel isn’t sure why the vampire has humanity left, but considering his affliction, he takes an educated guess and asks, “Is it true that you don’t feed on humans?”
“I’m not going to run-“
The last of the light fades with Dean’s words, and Castiel is left with that familiar oppressive silence. He feels the trees start to close in again, ands looks back up at the sky. He isn’t alone.
There was a trail of crumbs leading from the pie across the counter, a fork left on the side. “Dean?” Castiel called. Still no response. He turned the corner and entered the living room. There Dean was, slumped in an armchair, his eyes closed and mouth slack. A beer rested on his chest, just shy of tipping over in his loose grip. Castiel’s eyes observed the softness of his features and the slow rise and fall of his chest. Dean was so handsome, even like this, and there was a warmth spreading under Castiel’s skin.
Dean wants to believe Sam, but guilt creeps up from the pit in his stomach, and he tries to drown the feeling with another pull of his beer. He remembers his words so clearly. Dark and cold and nothing. That doesn’t sound like a place Cas belongs. Not Cas.
“The empty.”
The image is so perfect that Castiel almost forgets where he is, but when he opens his eyes, he’s jarred back to reality.
“I just came for him. One angel. That’s all I want.”
Standing at the water’s edge admiring the immensity of the ocean’s glimmering surface, the shade of blue reminiscent of a pair of kind eyes he once knew, Dean prays.
“Benjamin Lafitte?”
“See you, Chuck.” Practically spitting the words at him, Dean turns away from the slight man, his body sprawled on top of the sand beneath him, small and pathetic. Sam and Jack follow, and they’re only a few steps from Impala when Chuck speaks again, his voice cold and callous.
“Yes, he is,” Castiel sighs, and they exchange a glance. Unlike all the times before, it’s not an awkward glance they share, but a knowing one. It seems Dean makes a lasting impression on almost everyone, even monsters. Castiel thinks that Benny might not be as bad as he first thought.
“I’m fine, “ he replies, a little too quickly. It's a response he’d watched Dean use a hundred times before when he didn’t want to talk about something, so naturally it doesn’t work, and Dean tries to catch his eyes. Castiel is focused on trying to sense any leviathans. They couldn’t be too far away. He has to make sure he notices them. He’s with Dean now. He can’t let his focus slip.
If he gets Cas back, he won’t have to deal with anything.
They both open the rest of their gifts, Dean only stopping to help Miracle open his. When he opens the matching couple’s Christmas sweaters from Castiel, he rolls his eyes and teases him for it, but he puts it on almost immediately, and he wears it all day, even when Sam can’t stop laughing when they greet him and Eileen at the door.
[PRAYER 12]
“I don’t know. Maybe. The world’s back. Chuck’s gone. Eileen is out there waiting for you to finally make a move, and she’s smart. She won’t hang around forever, y’know? And there haven’t been any cases in weeks. I think if we’re finally free, we should start acting like it.”
It was time to assemble and Castiel was nervous. In all his years, he’d barely cooked never mind baked anything, and he wanted this pie to be as good for Dean as he could make it. He remembered reading somewhere that food tasted better when it was made with love. He didn’t understand how, but just in case it was true, he thought of Dean as he worked.
It was the height of summer and his garden was in full bloom, bright with the vibrant oranges, yellows and purples of the blossoming flowers, and the deep reds and pinks of his fruits, ripe and ready to be picked. On any other day Castiel would have lost himself in them for hours. He would have studied the shape of each flower’s blooms, admiring how the thin red tips of his striped carnations’ petals bled into a blush pink, and then washed out into a soft white closer to the centre. He would have watched as the bees flew from flower to flower, collecting their nectar, their fuzzy bodies dusted with pollen which scattered in the air when they took flight. Today though, nothing stood out to Castiel more than Dean did. In the light, the sweat on his skin made him glow, his cheeks rosy and his eyes gleaming, those irises greener than anything else in Castiel’s garden. His hair was ruffled where he’d pushed it back from his forehead, and his arms were bare for once, the lily-white patch of skin from the tip of his sleeve to just below his elbow browning under the sun’s rays. He was crouched beside Freya, next to the raspberry plants. Not wanting to disturb them, Castiel tried his best to make out what Dean was saying from his seat at the table.
At the end of the song, they cheered and clapped, but it was white noise in Castiel’s ears. All he could do was stare. He looked around at the smiling faces, everyone he loved in one place, and was so overcome with joy and surprise that all he could do was sit there and stare.
“Look, I don’t know why you wanna’ stay here. I guess you got your reasons. But you got a real good friend there. It’d be a shame to lose him. That’s all I’m sayin’.
[PRAYER 14]
There was the time after Sam pulled Michael to Hell. That didn’t last long though.
Chuck grins. “If that helps you sleep at night. I don’t know how you do it – knowing that the one true, real thing in your life is dead. How he never got to say goodbye to his son, or Sam. How he was never happy until he realised he would be free from you and everything you put him through. Knowing that now he’ll be replaying all the times he disappointed you, all the times you told him he was the problem, every time you pushed him away, forever, and all of it is because of you.”
He can’t help but notice the empty spaces around him. There’s no gentle eyes to greet him on the other side of the table. No texts. No calls. Nobody to share the flickering glow of the television screen as they watch his favourite movies. There are gaps shaped like Cas every which way he turns. Life is just emptier without him. Desaturated.
He watched Dean leave and turned back to the pie. Reaching for the cookbook, he held it up and compared his creation to the photograph inside. The pastry’s edges were a little jagged in places, and the lattice on top was messy and uneven, but Castiel didn’t think that mattered much. He’d always had a soft spot for things that were rough around the edges anyway. Satisfied, he set it in the oven and followed Dean into the garden.
“Goodbye, Dean.”
Without Dean’s voice, Castiel’s surroundings felt much colder. The trees on the edge of the clearing seemed to inch closer, and Castiel looked into the darkness of the forest ahead of him, willing Dean to find something else to say.
“Why did you pick today to be my birthday?”
✿ ⚘ ✿ ⚘ ✿ ⚘ ✿
“I kept searching, but there’s nothing so far,” Sam says. Dean hadn’t noticed before, but Sam’s under-eyes are dark, and he looks sick with exhaustion. Not only has Dean been driving himself into the ground, but he’s taken Sam with him.
Sam takes the seat opposite Dean, sincerity in his eyes. “Dean, after everything you’ve done for the world, for Cas, for me, you’re not selfish for wanting to live your life. You’ve done your job. Cas knew what he signed up for, and you tried, Dean. You tried.”
He’s sleeping the whole night through most nights now too, and his nightmares are mostly gone. Of course, some days are harder than others. Some days Dean comes home, and the house feels cold and empty, and there are those Cas-shaped holes in every corner he looks. Sometimes he can’t help but feel angry. It’s mostly frustration – frustration that he can’t get past things. Frustration that some things still eat him up inside. He’s got Miracle. Sam and Eileen are happy. For the first time ever, he’s happy, and he has a life that’s more than he ever dared dream of, and he can’t help but feel guilty whenever something gets to him.
Dean’s mouth starts moving without his permission.
It’s Sam.
A chuckle escaping his lips, Castiel shook his head and edged forward, keeping his footsteps as light as possible. He didn’t want to wake Dean if he could help it – he’d already lost enough sleep to last him a lifetime. Untying the knots in his laces, Castiel eased the boots off, one after the other, and Dean stirred, his eyes opening a crack. Castiel’s heart sank, but as soon as those green eyes saw him, Dean’s lips pulled into a lazy, sleepy smile and Castiel couldn’t resist. He leaned across and placed a chaste kiss on Dean’s forehead, his lips barely touching his skin. He heard Dean sigh underneath him.
[PRAYER 121]
“You did your best, Dean,” Cas replies, offering Dean a reassuring smile. “That’s all you can ever do, and given the father you and Sam had, you did better than anyone could’ve expected you to.” There he is, understanding as always, and Dean’s heart aches with how much he loves him for it. He’s sure his face shows just how much, but he doesn’t worry about it. Instead, reaching over the table, he places his hand above Cas’s and holds it there.
“Cas? Cas, we’re so close now. Come on.” Voice trembling a little, Dean speaks louder, and wills his best friend to life again with one final shake.
“What do you mean? They weren’t the right size, and anyway this way I can make sure they’re just how you want them.”
The familiar roll of the Impala in the driveway brought him back from his reverie. There was the creak of the car door, the slam as it shut, and the sound of Dean’s key in the lock. Castiel was suddenly very aware of the mess he’d made of his clothes. The key twisted and the door opened.
He squeezes Castiel’s shoulder, taking one last glance at Jack and Freya, and then turns back to the barbeque.
This time of year is usually Castiel’s favourite; the crisp, golden leaves, the shorter days, the slight chill in the air that makes evenings in front of the T.V. with Dean that little bit cosier. Today though, he catches sight of how those gold-tipped leaves whip in the wind outside and shudders, pulling the sleeves of his sweater down over his hands and wrapping the blanket tighter over his shoulders. There are lots of things Castiel likes about being human, but being cold, he’s decided, is not one of them. Another gust of wind rattles the shutters, whistling against the glass, and Castiel shivers again, moving from his seat to the floor and closer to the fireplace. Before he can even complain about being cold again though, Dean’s right by his side, reaching for a second blanket and draping it over him, making sure every part of him is covered. He nods his head toward the now empty bowl, “You finished that quick.”
Dean steps closer, and Cas straightens up.
Dean frowns. “Okay not famous like that.”
“Dean, I cried over a cake today, it can’t be anymore stupid than that.” Just reminding Dean about it made his cheeks warm again. Embarrassment always was his least favourite discovery about humanity.
“Cas?” It’s a voice Castiel would recognise anywhere.
“Still?” Dean asks.
Castiel remembered letting him savour the moment. It wasn’t often that Dean felt secure in his intelligence, and it made Castiel’s heart so full to see.
Home.
“No, I’m perfectly sane.” His eyes are darting from point to point around where they stood. He can’t feel the leviathan, but he’d already been at this stream too long, and Dean is here now. He doesn’t feel sane. “But then, ninety-four percent of psychotics think they’re perfectly sane, so I guess we’d have to ask ourselves what is ‘sane’?”
There’s a silence, and then finally Sam says, “I guess I just never thought I’d hear you say that.”
There is heat on his neck, and Castiel wants to tell the vampire not to call him “pal”. They weren’t “pals”. They wouldn’t ever be “pals”. That term is already reserved for someone else.
They’re walking for what seems like the hundredth day in a row, and Castiel catches Dean staring at him for the third time in five minutes.
[PRAYER 309]
[THE END]
“Here. Open this one first,” Dean urges, leaning over to give Castiel the gift.
“A child?” Cas replies, meeting Dean’s eyes. “Isn’t it customary to get married first?”
“It’s over, Sam. I’m done.”
“Hey, you still with me?” Dean’s voice soft and low.
“You want to give up?” Sam’s question sounds like it comes from a place of confusion rather than accusation, but Dean still can’t help but get defensive.
At the time he thought it was apt that he set the fire. He was the reason Cas was gone after all, and like those flames took Cas, Dean was engulfed in his anger, consumed by his guilt, and it left him nothing but a burnt out, broken man, fragmented. He felt damaged beyond repair.
“Home?”
“Well, you shouldn’t have said that, because now that I know he’s alone here, I’m gonna’ have to save him.”
There’s a pause. The vampire is calculating his options. “And how do I know that he won’t kill me as soon as I find him, or once he’s at the – what is it a door?”
Castiel is barely registering what Dean’s saying now.
Dean takes a breath and tries to be brave. Those words have never come easy, but he knows they need to be said now.
Dean let out an “ooo” before abandoning his beer and taking the spoon, pushing the whole thing into his mouth. Castiel couldn’t help but smile; there was something about Dean’s childlike excitement over food that was so endearing, even if he suspected the reason for it wasn’t anything but heart-breaking.
”We, uh…” Dean avoids Sam’s eyes as best as he can. “We’ve been working for days. I better go get us some supplies.” He starts searching for the keys to the Impala and making his way towards the door. “Do you need anything?”
There was the time at the reservoir, and he hung onto that tattered trench coat, kept it safe, until Cas came home and reclaimed it.
The entity is crushing him from the inside out. He’s sprawled out on the ground now, gasping for any air he can get. His vision starts to fade, black at the edges and seeping in to the centre. As he succumbs to nothingness, with his last shallow breath, he reaches for Cas. He finds his arm and clings to it. He hopes he knows how sorry he is. That’s as close as he’ll ever get to saying it now.
If he makes one wrong call, makes one wrong move, Dean could die, and it would be Castiel’s fault. He let the leviathans out. He was the reason Dean was in Purgatory in the first place. If he caused Dean’s death too, Castiel thinks even Purgatory might be too good for him.
“There we go,” Dean says with a toothy grin, “you’ll feel better in no time.” He whips the dishcloth he’s been running through his fingers over his shoulder and heads back to the kitchen, brushing a hand on Castiel’s arm as he passes by.
Standing at the backdoor, Castiel admired the view, a smile on his face. The grass was long overdue for a cut, the path needed de-weeding, and the fence was only half-painted, but he couldn’t help but love his little garden.
“Nope, come on, sleepyhead, you need your bed rest,” Dean says.
Eventually, he looks back again, and he and Castiel catch eyes. They share a look, and the vampire must know what Castiel is thinking, but all he says is, “Hola.”
“Famous?” Castiel’s wariness is obvious, and as much as he tries to hide it, it’s hard when Sam’s told him so many stories of Dean’s culinary infamy over the years. One dish in particular that comes to mind is microwaved hotdog omelette, and Castiel can’t tell whether it’s the thought of that or the fever that causes a particularly violent shiver to run down the length of his spine.
“Dean.”
“You really didn’t have to build the flowerboxes, Dean. The ones at the store were fine.”
Cas noticed after a second and stopped dancing. he squinted his eyes a bit and said, “What’s wrong?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why are you up?”
They continued doing weird little free dance moves until the song started playing,
"Oh."
Sorry about the delay on the second chapter, I didn't realize I would have to restructure the plot so soon but the writers shoved so much exposition and so many bs explanations into this scene that if I had pulled too much from it I would have looked like a shit writer.
"Yeah, you're going to have to be careful with this one, they practically had to bubble wrap it to make sure it got here all in one piece. Anyway, the only other thing is this," she gestured to the left side of the body's chest. It was easily missed among the already dilapidated skin, pocked with craters, but Dean could make out a symbol burned into the skin. It was what looked like a six-pointed ninja star inside of a small circle with three curved lines connected to the outside of it and a larger circle surrounding it all. It wasn't anything he recognized but it would probably be enough to identify what they are dealing with. "Weird huh? Do you think it's a cult, like some of those satanist, killing cows? Scary to think of something like that in Caldwell, I have some friends who live way out there and who would be there if some freaks came out to murder them? No one might even notice for a few days, well, I can tell you I'm going to be calling everyone I know every few days to make sure everyone is okay until this whole thing is solved. It makes me sick, just sick to see someone like John go like this, not that I knew him well anyway, friend of a friend and all that but I heard he was a real stand up guy." Jesus, did this lady ever need to take a breath.
“Hot damn!”
Castiel turned around and saw Death standing farther down the hallway, her palm up and fingers curled in as if she was crushing his heart in her hand. A few more minutes; they only needed a few more minutes.
Dean started moving back from the table and towards Cas, trying to pass the sliding off as dancing.
(See the end of the chapter for
He could see the cogs turning in Sam's head, connecting all the dots together. "Oh my God."
“No, I’m not kidding,” another piece goes into his mouth, “Mmm-I have
The vampire stares at Castiel. After a moment, he cocks his head, his eyes slightly squinted, and says, “Okay, angel. I’ll play along. Like you said, I ain’t got nothin’ to lose now have I?”
Castiel can’t bear to see how Dean’s expression softens again. Why does he have to look at him like that? He half-turns his body towards the stream and tries to focus on finding the leviathans that were undoubtedly close-by. Dean needs to go. “Just, leave me please.”
Light floods the Bunker, and Dean knows exactly where to look to find what he needs. Making his way down those spiral stairs, he rushes to a set of drawers in the corner, the book is exactly where he left it. He turns to the page with the folded corner and reads the words he’d clung to all those months ago.
The only way Dean can think to get this feeling to go away is to see him again. To brush his cheek, and not a stupid letter on a table.
There, the light makes the top of the water glimmer, and it becomes mottled as it threads the gaps of an acacia tree, the branches of which are dotted with little round petals, a yellow only found in watercolour paintings. As his gaze moves over the scene, he’s particularly drawn to a hyacinth bush in the centre, it’s petals electrically purple against the sparkling stream behind it. He wants to take in every detail, but he’s aware he only has so long before he needs to move again, so he flicks his eyes across the imaginary garden and, with birdsong and the rippling of the water, he takes one last look. He absorbs the soft orange and white of the tulips that freckle the ground, and takes note of the way they bend towards the sun, and then Castiel is reminded of the blush of Dean’s cheeks in a patch of red gardenias, and his eyes in the lush grass, and that sharp line of his jaw in the rocks that poke up from underneath the water.
Caught in a storm, a little boat lost at sea, waves of painful realisation crash over him, and all those years of heartbreak come flooding over the dam. That awful, sickening guilt has hold of his weary heart again, not just because he’s the reason Cas is gone, but because, despite all his efforts, that rage, the frustration, it’s all still there, eternally bubbling below the surface. Crying in his car in the middle of the road, Dean is angry. It’s a habit he’s had his whole life, an impulse so familiar, and he’s tired of fighting it. He’s tired of fighting altogether.
The world quivered to feel the shadow that drifted through it, to know that the shadow smiled as the wedding ring on his hand as he held his scythe, who belonged mind, body and soul to another. Death belonged to the angel, wholly and completely.
One look and Castiel was lost.
Every other universe, God won. Every other time, they walked away from each other and played their parts like it never occured them to do anything but. Every single place they could have fallen for each other and ripped the rulebook up in the process, they didn’t. They were never destined to be together. But the Winchesters were never one to listen to destiny.
ever since the moment that the first call came cracking through Heaven like the toiling of a bell at the announcement of dawn. Something shifted that day. The day that the angel with a crack in his chasm plucked the Righteous Man from Hell.
Not without asking
It was funny how often people assumed it would be the other way around.
There was no angel without his hunter that he would follow to the ends of the Earth.
He was Death but he lived only for his angel. Everything, only for his angel.
The most broken angel, the one that Death bowed to like the angel was a king and Death was no more than a slave that was made to do its bidding. Like all the power that coursed in him was nothing more than a vehicle he had accepted as his way to get back to his angel. No power or force meant more than the angel, nothing was more important than the angel, nothing more worthy of love and devotion than the angel.
The universe took them from each other and they found each other again.
The angel who had fallen for the Righteous Man, loved the Righteous Man enough to doom himself to it, he fashioned this new Death into the conductor of the Paradise they both deserved.
There were rumours that this new Death had a twinkle in his eyes, a soft spot for children, and found Chicago pizza hilarious in a way no one understood. This new Death who courted miracles, who kept his angel safe in the underground bunker he called his home. Death who walked among men and lay with angels.
“Hold on. Hold on. Cas,” Dean says his name so softly it’s almost painful, “we’re getting out of here. We’re going home.”
Chuck doesn’t let up though, and he’s still calling out to them, even when the engine is running and they’re pulling away. “It will eat you up inside, Dean. You’re a coward. You’re all cowards. Come back.”
"This is the only tape player I own Dean."
"Where is he?"
"They'll be gone," Dean finished. There was another tug in Cas' chest telling him to hold Dean tight while he still had a chance. They all sat in the silence for a moment, taking in the fact that they now have another threat on their hands they had to deal with.
"It hurts" Jack's hands were clutching his ribs now as he bent over in pain.
“Nothing, it’s just, you’re distracting.”
Everything in the room stilled with defeat. "Well," she drawled, "where is it?"
"Where are you going?" Cas spun around to look at the younger Winchester.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, what does that mean? What happens if Billy takes power?" Dean's quick breaths were slowing now and he was leaning his weight on the nearby table in the gap where a chair should have been.
There was no stopping the impala to look at music this time. It was a miracle they never got pulled over for speeding. A couple times Cas had to shake Dean's shoulder to keep him awake so they didn't run off the road. Eventually Cas convinced Dean to let him drive since he couldn't get tired. He argued as he always did, but eventually relinquished the driver's seat to Cas once he pointed out that Dean might need the sleep for whatever comes next with Billie.
Dean straightened.
"What do you want with me?"
"I-I can't be here. You have to take me somewhere far away. I can't stop it and I don't want to hurt you." He was panicking and that wasn't making things better. The power burned inside of him deep enough to make him aware of the pain in every atom of his body, shaking the reality of matter. He could feel his grace… expanding didn't seem like the right word. expanding implies that it's happening in the third dimension where space exists. Even as he said it, he knew that it wasn't enough to get him away from the bunker. He could be on the other side of the world, but without Chuck to absorb the blast he might take out the whole galaxy. That thought sent a new wave of icy panic through his bones.
The ride was so long Cas could almost feel himself grow tired. It was a strange feeling, he could remember exhaustion from his brief time as a human and every once in a while the memory would ghost back in and make him long for sleep. After flying everywhere for millions of years, driving felt like standing still, even now. Cas pushed his shoulder blades together in discomfort thinking about his wings. They didn’t hurt anymore, but they still felt like phantom limbs. From time to time he would forget about their mangled state and stretch them out, preparing to navigate through the planes of reality but he could never do more than flick them in and out of it these days, so the impala it is.
Sam let out a rough breath. "Fine, You go with Dean and Cas, we'll reconvene here later."
Jack's heart dropped to the floor. He was ready to die, but when he came back and saw his family standing there, for a moment he let himself hope that he could have just a little more time with them.
Dean heard Cas sigh behind him but he didn't turn around. He knew exactly where the angel would land on the issue. "Dean, we have to save Jack, we don't have any other choice."
Sam's stomach turned as he dug his nails into the soft leather cover of the book. There was no option really, they had to give the book to Billie, but it opened up a whole other set of problems to deal with. It didn't feel too long ago that he thought they could all retire soon. It probably wouldn't be anything close to a normal retirement, a few hunters, an angel, and the son of Satan, but he didn't need normal. He was even starting to think about how he would ask Eileen to move into the bunker with him. Just a few years of peace was all he needed.
"I can't stop this; I'm coming apart." Something inside of his essence tore. It was coming and there was nothing he could do. "Don't let me hurt you."
Dean slid over to the table on his socks and grabbed the closest cup as he more shouted than sung, “Fill my cup put some liquor in it!”
Sorry for the break in uploads, I had finals then needed to spend time with family for the holidays but I'm back now and I have solemnly vowed to never abandon this fic. And yes, two Cas chapters in a row, what can I say, I love writing for him ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
“Dean, I found something I rather enjoy.” Dean noticed that the angel was stripped down to only his white button up, pants, and black socks. He usually wore about four layers so this was a nice change of pace. Dean couldn’t help but let his eyes linger over the angel’s torso and arms.
Usually he didn’t mind driving when he was with the Winchesters. He tried to think of it less as travel and more as family time. They rarely went for long rides together but when they did Dean would always pick through his tape collection at each stop and interrogate him on what songs or bands he’d listened to and what he hadn’t heard yet. He didn’t mind most of the music, though he tended to like the slower songs with long instrumentals and mournful lyrics. Obviously the instruments were much different but they always reminded him a little of the ancient Minoan songs of praise he would listen to with Balthazar. They weren’t supposed to be on earth at that time but Balthazar had convinced him that there would be no harm done as long as they stayed invisible. Cas supposed he had always had a little bit of a rebellious streak, even before he recognized it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas ran towards Dean who was looking around frantically for Billie. He grabbed him by the arm and started to drag him towards the door. "We have to go
“Yeah, Cas? What is it?”
"So where are we headed?"
A calm fell over Castiel as he realized all at once what he had to do. He turned and looked at the man who made him fall, and smiled.
And he was gone, and there was nothing.
"We'll give it to you." Cas' voice was little more than a growl. Sam didn't mind Cas making the promise on his and Dean's behalf, he knew well that both of them would do the same.
“I bet I can.”
"I think you've done enough." Someone else was there. Billy. He could feel her power even through everything else: maybe because he was so close to the other side now. There was bickering but he couldn't hear it. Maybe they were figuring out how to send him away. Maybe Cas was bargaining for him to stay. None of it mattered, he would be gone soon and he would take them with.
Dean moved a little closer to Cas who pointed to himself again when he sang, “I’m too hot.”
His eyes were glowing a fire-gold and the skin around them seemed to crack and seep light, it was all too much for him to contain.
**********
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam's hand hesitated on the handle for a moment as he looked back at Dean for courage. Dean's eyes were stony, and angry, and distant but it was good just to know that his brother was behind him, ready to back him up even if everything was going south anyway.
Uptown funk you up, uptown funk you up. Uptown funk you up, uptown funk you up.
Billy sighed again as if this was a silly technicality. She closed her eyes and seemed to pulsate slightly as reality bent around her. "He's alive, I can assure you. The book, now."
“What,” he asked, “you find this distracting?”
There was a dull sting as Cas pulled his blade over the palm of his left hand. The feeling wasn't pleasant, but it was grounding and Cas was grateful for that. His right hand moved automatically, painting every sigil he knew might buy them one more second. Just as he closed the circle around the last sigil there was a loud bang on the door. They were lucky Billie was being as slow as she was, but Cas got the unsettling feeling that she was just toying with them.
"I'm Agent Mercury, this is Agent Hutton and this is our trainee from the academy. We need to take a look at the John Wilkinson's body."
"Bring him back Billie." Sam knew she had no reason to listen, but he was still ready to rip her apart.
Cas took Dean's silence as agreement as they took a sharp left towards one of the many staircases. Just before they reached the doorway Dean stopped dead and doubled over.
Dean could see two marks on the wrist that looked like they were once open wounds, but the lack of blood made them harder to notice. Jack touched the marks carefully from the other side of the table, sanitary blue gloves on now, and a fleck of blackened blood fell off, confirming their nature. The mortician continued.
One second he was standing (floating? falling?) in the empty and the next he was back in the bunker standing in nearly the same place he was before. The stark difference between void and being was disorienting, so much so that he had to focus on keeping the ground beneath his feet before he could concentrate on bringing his other senses into play. Finally something broke through.
Cas hit a key on the laptop and the song started playing.
Sam let out a short breath like he was frustrated at having to put whatever went through his head into words. "Why does Billy want the book?"
Dean pulled his phone out of his pocket and took a picture of the symbol. "Cas, do you recognize this?"
"I said I would bring him back from the empty, and here he is, but I believe I will be needing this one now."
“I’m too hot,”
"Not so fast, I need something from you first."
Cas on the other hand, he knew exactly what needed to happen next. He didn't have the luxury of being upset, especially while Sam and Dean were still in shock. Cas double checked his coat pocket to make sure he had his angel blade and started stalking towards the garage. There was no telling how long Jack would last in the empty
"Most of what I can tell you about this you can see yourself. almost all the moisture has been removed from this man's body. I have no idea what could have done that but it almost looks like the body has been mummified, but they checked and it's definitely John, the dental records match." She spoke in one long continuous sentence, hands fluttering in front of her to accentuate her words.
Death sighed and tapped her fingertips lightly against the long shaft of her scythe. "He might be, I'm not sure. If Jack survived the explosion, The Empty will not be pleased, especially since I sent him there. We don't exactly see eye to eye but he can't come here without being summoned." She cast her gaze around the bunker. "This isn't his domain"
"I do make good on my deals Dean." As she closed her eyes there was a suffocating feeling in the room as dimensions clashed together and something was pulled through several planes of existence. When the feeling subsided Jack was standing by Death's side looking rattled but alive.
They were so close together now they were practically grinding. The two of them slid into the next section with Dean Singing, “girls hit your hallelujah!” and Cas replying with “Whoo.”
Man, Dean sure has some serious repression going on. If you enjoyed comments make me absurdly happy and I respond to them all :)
“Hot Damn.”
Before Dean could speak Jack chimed in, obviously eager to feel like he was contributing. "That's okay, we just have to check it over again ourselves for the records, but thank you for your time." He gave a charming smile and the woman gave a quick, "all right then young man, I'll leave you boys to it," before walking out of the room, leaving them alone.
“Do you want to listen to it?”
“I wanted to listen to the tape you gave me.”
Dean wiped the sweat from his forehead. It had taken them nearly an hour to cross out the sigils and disable the hex bags they had placed around the abandoned shed before they could even start digging for it. When his shovel made the telltale clunk of metal hitting metal, he dug his hands into the dirt and hefted out the heavy iron lockbox. As Sam got to work undoing the locks, something gnawed at him. This couldn't be a good idea. If Billie wanted the book, it couldn't be for anything good. What had changed?
“Call a police and a fireman.”
(See the end of the chapter for
he could vaguely feel Cas in front of him, pleading, but the power was making it hard to focus.
“I’m too hot,”
"I am going to need God's book."
"Wait. Order." Sam's face was pale now and his fingers had stilled over the center of the book. "Eileen. Order would mean putting everyone back where they belong. Everyone in their own dimension, and those who have died…"
Sam could feel Dean deflate beside him, he knew something was breaking in there, just like it did every time they lost someone. Sam on the other hand, every muscle in his body was clenched and ready for action. This was far from over. They still had to take on God, they had to get Jack back, they had to deal with The Empty and on and on and on.
"Jack, are you alright?" The panicked sound of his father's voice brought him back to himself. He straightened himself out and stood as tall as he could, trying to display just how alright he was despite the fact that he could feel every atom in his body thrumming with existence.
Dean wrinkled his brow and looked at the edge of the tape, the label slightly worn from handling.
Just wanted to mention that I have a list of loose ends I am going to try to tie up but if there is any plot line you especially want wrapped up leave a comment and I'll try to work it in!
When Cas put both of his hands in the air above his head and began to thrust his pelvis left and right in front of him. He had, no doubt, picked it up from a different music video. Dean noticed after a second that he had been watching Cas so intensely that he stopped dancing. He tried to remember any moves at all but Cas was just so damn distracting.
With Sam in bed, and sheltered underground, away from the rest of the world, Dean tries to ease that pain away with a brush of his thumb over the newly carved letter.
It couldn’t have been Dean’s. The warding on his ribs still keeps his hidden from Castiel, and there isn’t enough of it anyway. Castiel hadn’t been able to actually see Dean’s humanity for years now, but even after seven months in Purgatory, he knew that there would be far more than this. Whoever’s this is had been here much, much longer.
Castiel eyed the photograph and smiled. The baby had grown so much since the last scan, and it still never ceased to amaze him that human life, as precious and fragile as it was, could come from just a few cells. Chuck may have created the first life, but it was humans that did the hard work. They built it from nothing using pieces of themselves, and kept doing so long after that life had been born. It was something so pure, and inherently selfless, and it’s exactly what Castiel loved about humanity.
Castiel has never meant anything more in his entire life.
The vampire continues. “The way I hear it, you two hit monster land and hotwings here took off. I figure he owes you some backstory.”
Castiel knows he should go, but all he can focus on is how badly he wants to stay.
“It’s about time we finally make some happy memories together,” Dean continues.
As Dean’s tunnelled vision fades to black, an echoed ring starts buzzing in his ears, and there’s a bright light at the centre, distant at first, but soon enough it takes over. Then he feels his lungs fill again, and  he’s opening his eyes to find that the entity is gone, and Cas is on his knees by his side, struggling for breath. Dean splutters, sitting up.
Dean goes back to the kitchen for a knife and some plates, and when he returns he says, “Okay, so the birthday boy gets to pick his slice. What piece do you want, Cas?”
When he catches most of his breath back, he pushes himself off the door and heads to the Impala, pulling open the car door and slamming it behind him. He doesn’t even know where he’s going. He needs to be somewhere not empty. Somewhere he doesn’t notice the blank space Cas left behind. Turning the key in the ignition, he makes his way onto the road and heads to the nearest bar.
“It’s blood,” Sam says finally, his voice sounding as defeated and tired as he looks. “We need his blood, Dean.”
With the money he’s earned from fixing up cars, Dean’s building it up essentially from scratch. In its current state, it’s almost uninhabitable. Broken floorboards, rotten timber frames, boarded windows, a leaky roof. It’s a wonder it’s even still standing.
“The kid’s dropped off. Sam, Eileen and the bump say hi.”
“Right, but Dean, we don’t even know how he did that.”
Cas takes the knife from Dean’s hand, their fingers brushing gently as he does, and brings it to the wood. First he scratches in an A, then an S. Dean watches him brush away the dust and admire it with a secret smile. Dean can’t help but smile too. Finally, Cas is back where he belongs. He’d already left his mark on the world, but it was about time he saw it for himself.
Dean catches the backend of a look Sam and Cas exchange. He doesn’t even mind that they’re making fun of him. He’s just glad that everyone is here.
“Yeah. He uh-,” Dean brings a hand down his face and clears his throat, “he said lots of things. It’s hard to remember.” It isn’t though. In fact, Cas’s last words have been at the front of his mind, spinning round and round since he’d first heard them. He knows them by heart. He knows Sam knows he’s lying too – they’ve been here before. They’ve had this conversation one too many times. Luckily, Sam doesn’t push him though.
Dean steadies his breathing, and lets the anger, the guilt, the pain of Chuck’s words go through him. Chuck wants to prove what Dean suspected of himself all along, and he’s not going to give him what he wants this time. Not this time. Cas said he wasn’t like that, and Dean has always believed in Cas.
Dean stares at him for a moment before he says, “The bloody way.”
Dean rolls his eyes. “Yes, Cas, I’m sure. You think I said all that stuff in there for the Hell of it? Now get carving.”
“I promise, okay? I used to give this to Sam whenever he was sick as a kid. It’s never failed me.”
Castiel sees how that wipes the expression off the vampire’s face, leaving only the faintest of smirks, and he feels the corners of his own mouth twist up a little.
He knows what Dean is getting at though, so Castiel doesn’t say any of that. Instead, he replies, “What? You mean am I still-“ and gestures that he has a screw loose.
“There’s someone here. Someone important. And you need to help him leave.”
With the certainty of the sun rising each morning on Earth, Dean’s prays to Castiel every night.
He bends down in front of the stream and tries to scrub his hands clean.
“That’s okay.” Castiel didn’t think much of it – Dean had been begging him for an apple pie for a few weeks now, but the apples weren’t ripe enough yet, and Castiel had joked that if he asked one more time he would never make him another pie again. Maybe Dean had thought he was serious. He couldn’t think of anything else Dean would want to ask him. Castiel makes another gap in the newest daisy’s stem and pushes another one through. “Do you have a favourite?”
He’ll never get the happiness he deserves.
“No, no. Always on a hunt – could never make it home,” Dean’s voice is cold and distant. “I never did get taken care of really.”
When it had cooled enough, he cut a generous slice of the pie, the pastry flaking as he pierced the centre with the knife. The filling oozed as he lifted the piece from the tin to the plate. Still a little warm, it made the edges of the cream Castiel spooned on top soften and drip down the sides. Pie and fork in hand, Castiel walked over to the open back door. He leaned against the doorframe and watched as Dean, his back turned to Castiel, spread a thin layer of white paint up and down the wood. The sun was due to set, the horizon glowing pink and orange, its light making Dean glow. Castiel had stood there for at least a minute, drinking in the fit of Dean’s shirt over his broad shoulders, and the mess of his hair, now completely damp with sweat from that relentless sun, and the sound of his whistling as he eased the bristles up and down, before Dean finally turned and caught him staring.
Castiel had almost forgotten the vampire is there until he says, “Why’d you bail on Dean?”
“Come on, Cas,” Dean pleads, his voice hushed and shaky.
His breath catches, his periphery blurs. Cas’s handprint marking the fabric on the shoulder.
Cheerful faces around the dinner table, Dean’s smile as bright as the lights on the tree, Castiel can’t believe how lucky he is. He never thought he’d get to have this. If he’s honest, he’s a little overwhelmed with how happy he feels. It’s a feeling that’s still a little foreign, especially in its unbridled human form, and his face must reflect just that, because when Dean turns to look at him he finds his hand under the table and gives it a squeeze.
Castiel doesn’t know what to say. He thinks about telling him his plan, just for something to say, but then he decides against it. For it to definitely work, Castiel needs to keep it to himself. It’s the only way he can guarantee that nothing goes wrong.
Cas touches his shoulder, one last gesture of comfort, and Dean wants to collapse into it. He never wants Cas to let him go. He tries to speak, he tries to say the words, but he’s pushed to the ground, and, legs paralysed, eyes-wide, all Dean can do is watch and Cas is ripped from his life again.
Castiel makes a noise that’s close enough to a “yes”, eyes closed and already half-asleep.
“He’s almost as pretty as young Harrison Ford. Not even he could compare to Han Solo though.”
Dean goes to oblige before realising what Castiel has said. He turns back and gives him a look. “Just because it’s your birthday I’ll let that one slide.”
Stood amongst the fruits of his labour, Castiel drank in the moment. It felt like Heaven out there in his garden – the humming of the bees, the rustling of the leaves – the warm sun smiling on his face. He breathed in, letting that calming, fragrant smell of lavender fill him up. This wasn’t a distant dream or a borrowed memory. This was real. Home.
“Come on, I want to show you this one,” he says as he chews, standing up a little straighter and holding a hand out behind him for her to grab. She takes it and totters alongside him. They stop in front of the cherry tree, it standing a little taller than Dean himself, it’s waxy leaves still and shiny. He lifts her onto his shoulders, and Castiel can’t hear them anymore, but he sees Dean pointing, and Freya’s little hand reaching for the cherries, and he thinks to himself that it’s not hard to guess why Sam turned out as well as he did.
He needs to this time though. Cas coming back depends on it.
When Cas struggles to get to his feet by himself, panic rushes through Dean, and he grabs him by the elbow.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hopping down from the bed, Dean makes his way over to it. Miracle follows. He kneels on the hard floorboards, wiping the thick layer of dust from the top. Dean retrieves a penknife from his back pocket and cuts through the tape.
Castiel’s eyes trace the picture in the photo-frame in his hands. It’s of him and Dean on the day they moved in, Miracle sat neatly in the centre at their feet, tongue poking out on one side due to the summer heat.
Dean places his hand over it.
Meg inching closer, Dean stands his ground, holding Cas tighter as he does though.
Dean chuckled, and put the sleeve back down. “Well,” he starts, a hand rubbing the back of his neck, “it’s the date we met.”
Castiel smiled, but there was an ache in his chest. It hurt him that Dean was so alien to receiving things, even with something as meaningless as this pie, that he thought he owed Castiel for it. Didn’t Dean understand? He had given Castiel a family – a home. Castiel could never ask for anything else again.
“That’s your excuse for leaving me with those gorilla-wolves?”
So he’s really gone.
Doesn’t Dean understand? Castiel had destroyed Heaven. He’d massacred his own brothers and sisters. He’d abandoned those that had fought alongside him, leaving them helpless and directionless and afraid. On Earth, hundreds of innocent lives were lost when he’d played God and failed, and because of his arrogance, and his unfounded pride, the entirety of mankind, God’s greatest creation, was put at risk too. Even worse, he’d left Sam and Dean to deal with it whilst he played house, as Dean would say, with Daphne, who he’d also abandoned. Perhaps the most unforgivable, Bobby Singer was killed trying to fix the damage Castiel had caused. Castiel had indirectly killed the only family Sam and Dean had left.
“Oh,” Dean shifts his gaze and heads towards the turntable, “it’s stupid.” He picks up the vinyl sleeve that was sat on the side and flips it over. Castiel might have believed he was reading the track list if it weren’t for his eyes staying fixed in one spot.
“How do you feel about being Castiel Winchester?” Dean asks.
, and it eats you up inside, doesn’t it? It keeps you awake at night. You tell yourself there wasn’t enough time, convince yourself that there was nothing you could have done. Just two more seconds and you could’ve said it back. But you’re a coward. You had twelve years to. And now it’s too late.”
“Of course,” Castiel rushes out, the remainder of the air in his lungs going with the words. He places both hands on either side of Dean’s face and follows the faint lines of those crinkles in the corners of his soft, sparkling, peridot eyes. They gazed up at Castiel from underneath two sets of long eyelashes, the ends of which looked like they’d been sprinkled with the same gold dust his freckles were made of. The fullness of his cheeks meant that the skin under his lids was satiny where the light touched it, but Castiel’s eyes were drawn down, trailing the curve of Dean’s pearly pink lips. He resisted the pull of them long enough to say, “Dean, of course I will.”
The vampire’s expression is something like disbelief and confusion. There’s a pause, and then he finally answers. “It’s true. What kinda’ monster are you then?”
The only thing worse than Dean believing Castiel had left him, was Dean’s lifeless body on the dirty ground, his skin, usually warm and pink, now stone cold and sullen, eternally lost amongst the never-ending trees of this forest, and the longer Castiel stands there, those leviathans edging ever closer, the more likely of a reality that became.
“We don’t want any trouble, okay?” Dean keeps his voice low.
Cas saved Dean too many times. It’s Dean’s turn to repay the favour.
“Do you want to see something special?” Jack asks her, and when she nods, he walks over to the other side of the path, where the hyssops live, and Castiel smiled. He and Jack had planted those a few months earlier as a memorial to Kelly. Castiel had wanted Jack to have somewhere he could go to remember her. That corner of the garden had been bare before then, only home to Dean’s workbench and Castiel’s compost. Now, it was decorated with bright, blooming flowers, popular with the bees, and the most beautiful part of his garden. Even in death, Kelly managed to breathe life into the emptiest spaces.
Castiel stays like that, waiting for the last of the light to disappear. When he looks up at that pitch black sky, he finds that Dean’s eyes aren’t there to greet him this time, and it dawns on him that, for the first time, Castiel is completely and utterly alone. He feels every last bit of it.
“Okay, but I don’t see how this is going to help, Dean. Soup has no medicinal properties.”
Dean pats his shoulder and tilts his head to meet Castiel’s gaze. “Seriously Cas, thank you.” He looks into those eyes, and Castiel can only hold Dean’s gaze for so long before that guilt starts to eat at him again. It takes hold of his throat and makes it hard for him to swallow, and he wants to say something, but he’s sure the words would come out choked.
“Thank you,” Castiel starts, “For saving me earlier.”
Dean shakes his head and laughs. “That reminds me,” he says, holding a finger up and moving to the side table just beside them. He pulls out the draw and roots through it. When he turns back, he’s holding a small navy blue box. “Your birthday gift.”
This fact somehow helps him breaks free of the concrete floor and he pushes himself up onto his feet. He moves slowly, as if any sudden movement could make the portal close, and takes a step forward. The door remains, drawing more and more of him into nothing the closer he gets. More steps, one after the other, and soon he’s inside.
“Sure, they can, and I think Uncle Cas is one of prettiest.”
He made his way back to the kitchen, and must have rooted through at least three cupboards before he found what he was looking for. When he returned to the tree, there was a colander in the crook of his arm, which he placed on the ground just beside his feet, and a pair of scissors in his hand. He carefully snipped the stems from their branches, one by one, until the colander was brimming with cherries, round and gleaming. Cradling them with one arm, he made his way back to the kitchen and watched them glisten as he rinsed them under a cool jet of water. His lips pulled into a smile. He reached a hand to the shelf just above his head, finding the cookbook, and flipped through the pages. Once he found the folded corner, he opened to the page and, following the instructions, he got to work.
Catching Dean’s eyes, he says, “He is,” and reaches over to wipe away the worst of the mess. Before he could pull his hand away, Dean took it, moving it to his cheek. His skin was impossibly soft and warm from the sun, if not a little sweaty. Leaning into the touch, Dean closed his eyes for a second and ran a thumb over the back of Castiel’s hand.
Castiel felt that burn on his cheeks again.
“Okay then, ‘just Cas’.” Dean places a hand on Cas’s shoulder. “Sam’s on his way. Let’s get you home.”
“Something smells good,” Dean said, placing the beer on the side. He looked at Castiel and smiled, a crease forming between his eyebrows. “Why are your hands pink?”
“Actually, there was time, not long before Sam was born, I caught some kind of stomach flu. I was up all night – didn’t sleep at all – and the next day I was so tired I damn near passed out at the dinner table waiting for my dad to come home so I could say goodnight - he’d been on a fishing trip with one of the neighbours I think.”
He closes the gap between them. “Here’s the spell”, he says, and lets two fingers hover just in front of the vampire’s forehead, using whatever grace he could spare to transfer him the spell and the area where Dean had last told Castiel he was. Once it’s done, Castiel steps back again. “If you follow that direction”, he gestures to a point just ahead of them, “and keep going that way you’ll find him soon enough. He takes breaks to pray, so you’ll be able to catch up.”
“Cas, you never told us you make jam,” Sam says as he’s putting half of the generous slice Dean had cut him back.
This isn’t good. This isn’t how this is supposed to go.
“What do you want on your burger?”
Castiel reaches over and takes it from him. “I thought it was customary to wrap gifts.”
It’s blood. It’s
Dean’s boots feel particularly heavy on the stairs, and every step he takes feels like a Herculean feat. It’s not just his boots. It’s his bones and his chest too. His joints ache, his legs are heavy, and when he finally makes it to the top, he uses the last shred of strength to push open the reinforced door.
With that though, Dean makes a noise against the rim of his bottle. “Oh yeah. Test me. I want to surprise Eileen tomorrow.”
❆ ❆ ❆
“Dean,” Castiel sighs.
Seeing the fatherly concern in Cas’s expression, Dean tries his best to reassure him. “Jack did good. He’s the one who defeated Chuck.” Dean rubs the back of his neck. “I guess he and Amara are God now.”
Not long after, Dean does too, and they stay that way, curled up with each other in the flickering orange glow of the firelight until the early morning sun welcomes them awake, granting them another day they never thought they’d have together.
“Merry Christmas to you too, now get yourself out of bed before I drag you out myself,” he hears Dean say half-jokingly, his voice muffled where Castiel’s head is buried under the covers.
“You’re quiet for someone who just came back to life,” Dean finally says.
“Or me, Dean. You got me gutted. You’re the reason I’m dead. You didn’t save me.”
His eyes flit to the source and land on a man with a stocky build, the fabric of his black jacket fitting snuggly over his shoulders as he leans over and sharpens his makeshift blade. A vampire.
[PRAYER 13]
Feeling Sam’s eyes on him, Dean turns, trying to bury the little hope that’s burning in him and how it bores its way through his chest. “What about him?”
Too exhausted to argue, Castiel does as he’s told, and once Dean sits down, it doesn’t take long for him to get comfortable again nestled against his chest, or for Dean to start combing his fingers through Castiel’s hair.
“Cas?” he heard Dean call from the hallway.
“I know you’re the baker around here, but I couldn’t have you baking your own surprise birthday cake.”
Dean looked at the ground and tried not to blush.
"Cas, we can't outrun her."
"So are you, you know you can do it yourself."
Christ, it had been Sam's idea to move the book. Him and Dean had a whole argument over it. "The bunker is the safest place in the world," Dean had said, "and we can protect it here. Moving it out of reach is asking for trouble." Sam pointed out that the bunker isn't really that safe. Maybe it was for the caliber of monsters the original Men of Letters were dealing with but it seemed that these days any big bad is able to get in with no problem. No, Sam suggested that they hide it instead. You don't have to defend something if no one knows where it is in the first place. It was a good idea at the time. Sam bit back his pride. "It's not here, we have to go get it."
Dean threw his duffel bag on the nearest bed and turned to look at the others. "Alright, well I think we can still hit up the coroner's tonight if we get going."
I know this is a short one but things are about to get spicy ;) prepare for angst y'all!
"My heart, I can feel her Cas."
." Dean stepped forward and Sam knew he was restraining himself from decking Death herself directly in the face.
"What happened to making good on your deals?" Jack could see Dean's body flush with blood and adrenaline. Jack turned back to look at Billie who was flipping the page on a strangely familiar book laying on the table.
It felt stupid now, he could have gone and got a tape player at any time, but he liked listening to it in the car. It felt right.
Understanding dawned in Dean's eyes and he softened under Castiel's touch.
When it came time for the refrain Cas pointed to himself and leaned back while he sang, “I’m too hot.”
Cas' face turned stony and he met Death's eyes. He was the first one strong enough to ask the question they all needed to hear. "Is he dead"
"I could use you in the interviews Jack, you're personable."
"They'd be gone." Dean finished for him. He looked over at Cas. If him and Sam died they would just go to heaven and Dean had made peace with that fate, but Cas would go to the empty. He would be gone forever. But on the other hand…
He pushed into the bunker and saw Death standing where she was before, looking relaxed as she paged through a vellum book written in a language Sam couldn't quite make out because of the distance. As they walked down the stairs she closed the cover and drummed her fingertips along the smooth shaft of her scythe.
Sitting in the back of the impala alone, only one feeling overwhelmed him: weariness. One problem solved and another pops up. Cas would be lying if he said he wasn't getting tired too. He had been a soldier for longer than the world has existed, but the last twelve years had been something different. Everything he knew fell apart, he discovered free will, heaven fell, he fell. It weighed on him, and sometimes late at night, after everyone else in the bunker had gone to bed, he would look at the barely used mattress in his bedroom and wish that he could just sleep. Not forever, just to catch his breath. It seemed like it would be nice to just rest for a while without feeling chased. He hadn't felt peace since the last time he sat in the gardens of heaven before the apocalypse started and he was ordered by his commanding officer to drag the man who would change his life out of hell. He remembered the feeling of stretching out his angelic form on the cool dewy grass and watching the bees pollinate the flowers. He would take in the entire landscape at once with his many eyes and admire its perfection. Too perfect, he thought now. Barely even real. The flowers would bloom if the bees were there to pollinate them or not, because they were never alive to begin with.
"And then what? We'll get him back? How do we even know he's alive?" Sam knew he couldn't trust Billy, but what choice did they have?
"I'm okay." He took a step towards his family, then felt Death grasp him by the shoulder again. Her grip was surprisingly strong, and Jack got the feeling that there was more than her physical hand keeping him in place.
"We have to."
"Give us Jack,
"So, what? We just hand the book over to Billie? We give her exactly what she wants?"
Cas stepped closer and continued the motion. Dean took this as a challenge so he grabbed the angel by the collar and kissed him forcefully on the lips. Cas stopped dancing. After a second he returned the kiss. Dean had to admit that this was a pretty good way to start his morning.
"Yeah," Dean brushed his hand over the brand, "and now we have somewhere to start."
"It could be a good learning experience," Cas chimed.
"Okay but why are you out here."
"Come on Dean, we have to go." Cas tucked his shoulder under Dean's arm and hoisted him up, forcing him forward and keeping him on his feet while they both stumbled down the stairs. The interrogation room was just on their left, and there was nowhere better warded in the bunker, though most of the wards were designed to keep things in, not out, but hopefully some of them worked like a door that locks from both sides.
"I did find a couple things on the body that are very unusual, now you're going to have to lean in to see because I can't move anything unless you want an arm snapping off." She let out a breathy chuckle and gestured to one of the wrists on the right side which was tilted slightly towards the body. Dean shifted slightly away from Cas so he had room to lean in, and when they did their heads were only a few centimeters apart. Dean could smell Cas' honey scented hair and feel his warm breath lightly brushing his cheek. For some reason the position made his heart pump a little harder for some reason so he shifted a little farther away to focus. Dean flicked his eyes upwards to see if Cas had even noticed the change but as always he was intensely focused on the task at hand.
"I'm going to Texas to get the book." As if there was any question about this. Of course they would get the book and of course they would save Jack. They would have to find some other way to take out Chuck, if there was another way. No, one problem at a time. They had to get Jack out of the empty.
“Yeah, ok.”
"The Empty. With God and Amara gone it was the only thing that could absorb the detonation" Death's tone was flat and uncaring. Of course it was, she might be on their side when it comes to taking down Chuck, but she has no reason to care beyond that.
Jack beamed a big toothy smile and looked towards Cas and Dean. Dean's lips quirked up in response. Something about Jack's childish happiness was infectious to everyone around him. After so many tragedies and crises Dean felt like he was just going through the motions, surviving day to day, but Jack reminded him of the humanity they were fighting for. And despite the fact that they weren't technically related, he looked so much like Cas.
"We have to focus on getting Jack and taking out Chuck first. I'll meet you in the car." And with that Cas turned and left. No one objected.
Man if feels good to get to some destiel :)
He started moving his arms a little up and down while using his socks to slide his feet across the floor. Dean decided that he couldn’t hold it in any longer.
“Seriously, stop.” he choked out between laughs.
Cas continued with, “Take a sip, sign a check,” while Dean pretended to take a drink from his empty glass with one arm held in the air.
Dean shrugged and slammed the door shut. “Couldn’t sleep, thought I’d give baby a polish ‘til I get tired again. Why are you sitting in your car?”
Doh, doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh, doh doh doh doh duh
There were three full sized beds on the right side covered with musty red duvets. The once-blue carpet was worn to the threads wherever you would expect there to be significant foot traffic and a cursory glance upwards revealed a smoke alarm dangling with the batteries removed, probably by the same person who left the room with the lingering scent of nicotine.
Death raised her eyebrows almost as if she was surprised to hear him speak.
Dean froze. He didn’t want to admit it but he freaking loved that song. The previous night he had probably listened to it on repeat seven times while laying in bed.
“This one, for them hood girls, them good girls, straight masterpieces.” Dean was actually getting kind of into it. He had on a smile that stretched all the way across his face and he moved his hips and limbs along with the beat.
Cas smiled and little crows feet formed by his eyes.
"Maybe she can do something now that she couldn't do before." Dean may not know jack shit about algebra or The Great Gatsby or whatever else normal people learn but what he did know was strategy. "It's a power grab, It has to be."
