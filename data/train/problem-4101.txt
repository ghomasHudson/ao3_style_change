But at night, when he’s listening to Sam snore across the room or tossing and turning alone on his memory foam, that’s when he can’t hide. That’s when he can’t push it down. That’s when the intrusive thoughts rise up out of the dark depths, surging up into the light.
Sam looks in the rearview mirror to see Dean’s eyes blinking lazily again.
“She’s always been pretty great. Real strong for Ben.” Then, to be honest and fair, he adds, “And for me. Once upon a time.”
Cas yells, “Put your heads down!” and the world around them explodes.
They slip and stumble their way into the bedroom, Cas running a towel over his body and hair as they go, dropping it carelessly on the floor as they reach the bed. Dean’s misgivings have vanished, lost in the tumble inside the shower and the brightness of Cas’s smile, and he kisses Cas with a hunger, running his hands along the bare skin he used to dream of touching. When Cas pushes him back onto the bed, Dean surrenders willingly.
“He’d like you to call,” she says softly. “He’s not ready. Do you want to stay in the room while Victor talks to them?” She glances at the clock over the stove. “It’s early, and a holiday. They might not be up.”
“Samuel,” they say, and Gwen groans.
“Fine,” Dean bites out. “But I mean it — no SWAT teams, no newspaper interviews, or I—”
Lisa just shrugs like it’s no big revelation. Like she expected that answer. Maybe she feels the truth without even knowing it.
“And how are you gonna do that, huh?” Dean snaps, because he’s never been good at layering his worry over his anger. “We don’t have the rings of the horsemen anymore, the witch who helped us last time is in the wind, and you’re
“I can’t imagine him grown-up,” she confesses. “We don’t do much on his birthday. Light a candle, say a prayer. But I think about him all day, try to imagine him looking like this.” She stares at the photo. “It’s hard to picture. I think he had more prominent freckles, but I can't remember for sure.”
Dean has the bag up high enough now to reach it with one hand. The zipper is halfway open already, and he fumbles inside with his fingers, feeling around the plastic containers, looking for the little packets he never uses. His fingers brush up against two.
Jack shifts uncomfortably, and Dean notices the sleeves on the jacket Sam bought for him the other day are too long. The jacket makes him look smaller than he actually is. No one would guess the kid with his fingertips just barely poking out of his sleeves is the most powerful being on Earth.
“You’re family. You’ve been my family for longer than anyone else,” Sam says, and a few tears escape at that. “And those belonged to Dean. He would want you to have them.” He pushes past the conflicted look on Cas’s face. “And like I said, you’re going to need them.”
Dean grabs Cas’s hand for comfort, and Cas’s heart races. “They’ve got people I care about.”
“When did we release a statement?” Cas asks Ellen, who’s flipping through his messages.
. He probably meant for it to be Cas, the fucking bastard. “I’m going to go out there, okay?”
“If I say yes,” Sam says, voice ringing with clarity he surely doesn’t feel, “you know I’ll just beat you again.”
“Mmmm.” Cas takes his eyes off the spreadsheet. “Bobby’s cheap because so is our government. Parks don’t exactly get top billing when it comes to funding.”
“Oh, I know. I make him fix anything that breaks around the house. The dryer, the disposal, the jammed doors.” She lists the items off on her fingers. “He has this tool belt he looks adorable in, but he’d kill me if he heard me say that in front of anyone else.”
“I wish you were here,” Dean whispers. “I wish things were different. I’m sorry, I am—” His voice shatters. “God, Cas, I should have said something when I had the chance. I love—”
“Cas Stein.” She’s trying the name out, a thoughtful look on her face. “Is Cas short for anything?”
Cas is not going to fuck it up this time.
Dean, overwhelmed, hugs him. Michael feels the warmth of it, even buried as he is.
Dean thinks, jogging to catch back up with Lisa,
Dean shrugs. “Giving most of it away to people who do need it.”
“I was in a coma for three months. The doctors thought I was going to die. But I didn’t. I woke up, but I couldn’t remember anything. I might have come out of the water physically, but mentally I felt trapped in that lake. I didn’t recognize my own siblings.”
“How much longer?” Dean asks, and he doesn’t sound invasive. Just curious.
He can’t shake the feeling he’s being watched.
They pause mid-fight, Dean’s arms still wrapped around Gwen’s neck and her fingernails digging into his wrists as loud voices erupt from behind the kitchen windows above them.
She stares at him with hate in her eyes. Like he’s Samuel.
“He’ll help us,” Eileen said. “He works on hunters during his off hours. He patched me up more than once.”
Cas is not interested despite knowing the meaning behind the man’s shifty eyes and plainitive words, but he realizes with a pang that this complete stranger, someone he’s never met, looked at him and longed for him when Dean Winchester, the sun around which Cas based his orbit for ten years, cannot look him in the eye. And Dean will never touch him or love him or—
Lisa crosses her arms over her chest.
“Right,” Cas says. “Wendell Perkins drowned around six months ago, though his body hasn’t been found.”
Cas watches the man hurry back to an 18-wheeler a few spots down, a puzzled furrow in his brow. He shakes his head, climbing back in the truck. He takes four bites of his sandwich before discarding it to the floorboard. As he curls up in the front seat, legs too long to settle comfortably, it hits him.
“Dean, I’m going back there once this is over. I don’t think it would be... prudent, for me to tell you where I live.”
no flat
Green Eyes is rushed through to see a doctor right away, leaving Cas standing in the middle of the emergency room, hat in hand, lost. He isn’t family, isn’t a friend. He idly wonders if there’s a box you can tick for “rescuer” on the ER forms. The woman at the front desk raises her eyebrows at him until he takes a seat next to the door, uncertain now he’s stopped moving.
Dean thinks about what Cas said earlier,
“Jesus, both.” Dean lets out an explosive sigh and puts his head in his hands. “I fucked up, okay? I was— First it was Mom, then it was Chuck, and everything went sideways so fast I didn’t have a second to breathe, much less think rationally.”
Cas lets out a huffing laugh, and Dean loves how he can feel it through every place where Cas’s body is pressed to his.
“You’re not going anywhere,” she says, her voice distorted by the grace. The fluorescent lights above her spark and pop, flaring out. She leans down and places two fingers on the squirming guard’s forehead and he stills, passed out.
“You have the Old Demonic version of the spell memorized?”
“I’m sorry,” Cas says, for what must be the hundredth time. Dean wonders what he’s apologizing for now. Leaving without telling anyone, including Dean? Sam falling back into addiction? Dean walking out on his dream job?
Dean’s shocked he’s considering letting Cas stay, but he’s also not sure Cas would leave if he asked. The path of least resistance is easier at this point. He’s too tired to fight.
“I told you: Tacoma. Point Defiance Park, to be more specific.”
Dean lets out a frustrated groan.
Chuck picks idly at a stray string on the comforter as he says, “I found what I was looking for, thanks to you two. And I took what I wanted.”
There’s a light switch at the bottom of the stairs, and when he hits it, it takes a second for his eyes to adjust to the sudden brightness of the fluorescents that buzz to life. Blinking, Dean slowly removes his hands from over his eyes, and his mouth falls slightly open as he gets his first glimpse of the room.
“Okay,” he says, signing along with his words. “Let’s talk about something else.”
“No, I—” Cas can see Dean’s struggling to get the words out, and he runs his thumb over the back of Dean’s palm. Thankfully Leahy’s too fixed on reading Dean’s lips to notice this. “I guess, in a way. Eileen, it’s a cult. I grew up in a cult.”
Cas read the piece. He knows it was fair. He’s not going to tell Turner that. “No, I’m here because he mentioned doing a follow-up and I was in the area.”
Dean, having never had a child of his own to devote his life to, doesn’t know how to respond.
Sam sounds so patient and hopeful, like maybe Dean might open up to him. The poor guy should really know better by now.
Lisa looks at him blankly.
“It’s a good car!” Cas protests, and Dean laughs at him. It makes his feet feel lighter as they make their way to the door, away from the pretentious crowds Cas hates and into the dark streets of the city he loves.
When he snaps the picture, Dean actually laughs, eyes crinkling and smile wide. Cas stares at the photo on his phone a beat too long, mesmerized, before Dean asks, “Can I see it?”
“He’s not supposed to.” Cas shakes his head. “But I think he’s got Garth covering the trails.” He moves his arm off Dean’s shoulder as they park. “I can’t believe how soft that old man is for you.” His words might seem harsh, but Cas sounds fond. Dean can’t really believe it, either. Finding Cas and Bobby in the same spot is a fucking miracle, and he’s not in the habit of believing in miracles.
Dean listens to the bed creak as Cas stands up and leaves the room. He keeps listening for the sounds of the front door opening and a car engine revving as Cas leaves him again, but they never come. He falls fitfully asleep to the sound of Cas singing some tuneless old hymn in the shower down the hall.
“I’m — What?”
They watch Ellen disappear into one of the back hallways, Anna and Balthazar still pressed against Cas. None of them move to get up. Balthazar’s foot taps a rough staccato against the marble floor. Cas feels like his throat is closing up.
When he’s done, Dean’s fingers curl around Cas’s hand, pressing into the lifeline on Cas’s palm before he lets go. Cas draws his arm back slowly, unsure if Dean will need it again. Dean stares at him, as unflinching as Cas ever is, willing him to understand. Cas doesn’t.
Cas wishes he found that more comforting than he does. “Dad?”
Cas, because that’s all Dean can call him now, sleeps like the dead. Dean’s constantly hovering his hand just under his nostrils to make sure Cas is still breathing. His chest, forehead and feet are wrapped in layer upon layer of gauze, hiding the gashes and loose strips of skin, and there’s a bandage on his wrist where Andrew attached an IV for a blood transfusion earlier. What the doctor (it’s Dr. Green, apparently, but he insists they stick with Andrew) is doing with type O blood bags in his house Dean can’t guess, but he’s grateful for them nonetheless.
He feels strangely guilty when he responds, “As okay as ever,” because the person who raised him, the person who really does love him unconditionally, just took off down the hall. Dean’s the closest thing Sam’s ever had to a real parent, and it feels like a betrayal when Mary asks, “Do you want to talk? I could call” and Sam tells her to wait until after eleven, when he’s sure his brother will be asleep.
“I’m the only Halo,” he says, knowing what Dagon will say.
The moment Dean sees Cas over Leahy’s shoulder, his face changes from angry to relieved. Cas’s palms go clammy as Dean looks at him, ignoring Leahy in favor of writing “Hey” on the whiteboard and showing it to Cas.
At that Dean laughs, surprising himself.
“Cas,” Dean says from underneath the car, “can you get that for me?”
“I might be bad at it, too. Every relationship I’ve ever had has been quick and ultimately unfulfilling,” Cas says, turning to look at Dean. “I don’t see it being like that with you. It’s not about the rush or the sex, it’s—” He pauses, thinking, fingers drumming against the wheel. “It’s like you said, we should take a shot at happiness.
He parks the Impala off the road in the grass and makes his way through the trees to a small clearing where a wooden cross once stood. It’s gone now, beaten down by the elements or broken by reckless kids, but Cas remembers where it was — where Sam planted it in the fresh dirt of his brother’s grave. He walks to the center of the clearing and stands right on the spot, head up to survey the sky above him, outlined by trees.
He doesn’t know where he is. He sees the sigils on the walls, but they swim before his eyes. He waves a hand in front of his face, shocked to see his fingers intact and whole, flesh not yet withered off the bone. He tries to sit up.
, Cas thinks,
Cas sees red.
“Tell me, Chuck — when you went after the Demons, was it to avenge me?” he asks, putting one hand on Cas’s chest to hold him back. Cas’s Grace is still thrumming, ready to let go. Chuck watches them impassively, eyes back to normal again. “Or was it so you could try out the Pool yourself?”
“It’s the redhead who thinks it’s lax. She’s the hacker. Her name’s Charlie. She’s going to send us a list of weak points for you to fix.”
“Kum savaltcha,” Gilda shouts over him. “Ar noyang, kun enna, ret augus, kuum doinsha getta wabasach shul!”
“I love you,” Cas says into the skin at the back of Dean’s neck. Dean opens his mouth to say it back, to say it like he does every other night, but the words won’t come out. They’re jammed in his throat. He can’t breathe. His eyes ache and ache, and they’re wet and he’s crying and he doesn’t know why.
She flicks her wrist and Dean slams back into the tree with a loud grunt, and two times in one night is a little much for his aging body. There are definitely stars floating at the edges of his vision now, but he’s coherent enough to hear James yell, “Stop! You came for me, so just take me!”
“I thought you weren’t running anymore,” Cas says, and he tries not to sound accusatory but it comes out that way anyway.
“I’m here for you. For good this time. I’m not gonna let you down again.”
Cas takes the stack from Dean and raises his eyebrows.
Cas startles at the vehemence of this statement, the anger in Dean’s eyes. He’s never quite sure what to say to Dean, the right words to string together to avoid his ire. Cas
When he first got here — and Dean can’t remember if that was a long time ago, maybe decades or years, or just mere hours, minutes — he’d been disoriented. He couldn’t remember right away what had happened to him, the choice he’d made. All the choices he’d made that led to this.
“Plans? What plans?”
The roads downtown and in the more affluent outer suburbs, closer to Shurley Manor, are a grid system and thus almost impossible to get lost on. The warehouse district follows no such pattern. The roads wind in and out of factory buildings and rail yards, either dead-ending on private property or winding their way all the way down the Cliff Road to the ocean. Cas knows the way, though. When the police call comes in over his long-range scanner, Cas is almost at Roman Inc. He can see the massive complex in the distance, a slightly darker blot of black against the night sky, lit only by the red sign announcing its name. Roman would have called his men as soon as he heard Red Mask’s threat, but he was likely too late to stop an operation already in progress.
“Cas?” Dean asks, low and quiet.
The words send a flare of bright happiness through Cas, but it's doused by the memory of the last words he exchanged with Michael. It’s not a pleasant topic, but he feels he owes Dean something in exchange for the way he opened up about his mother.
Cas jerks his hand away from the chair and closes his fist. He tries that TV trick again, the counting to ten, thinking rational, factual thoughts of no great importance.
But knowing them — knowing the Winchesters — they’re going to try until they die anyway.
Dean grins at him as Sam says, “Perfect. Well, I’m headed that way. We can try to lure Perkins out tonight. End this thing.”
James sighs, running a hand over his mouth.
on the table with his pointer and index fingers. Balthazar has his head in his hands, lost for words for once. Anna is pacing, and Cas feels like he’s two seconds from losing his mind.
They’re sugar, not salt. He hopes this still works.
“Cas...” Dean starts, but he doesn’t know what to say.
Now that he has permission, Dean collapses back against the flat pillows, knocking all the cards off the bed onto the floor. Eileen huffs in irritation, but he’s too exhausted to feel bad.
He rushes through his shower and the rest of his morning routine, not bothering to put on his suit or even to dry his hair. Cas comes out of the bathroom in a t-shirt and boxers, wet hair sticking up in every direction. He sits next to Dean on the bed, and the few inches between them feel like miles.
Dean hates it. He’s essentially a prisoner, watched by twitchy guards every second of the day — except they expect him to pull a shank out and stab himself, not them. They’re treating him with kid gloves — Jack because he’s afraid
“You sure didn’t try for the last nine months.”
He patted the soil flat around the sapling and the teacher, her face and clothes a blur long lost to time, had said, “This tree will stand here in a hundred years. You can bring your kids to see it.”
The feeling of the angel does not change. Our tree knows that he must have done this on purpose, it must mean something to him, and it is the first time the tree thinks that angels are more than just the cold creators the water remembers. She did not expect an angel to feel so warm. Dean removes his hand from her trunk and she hardly notices.
“Cas,” Dean shouts, pulling him away from our tree as the branch cracks and tumbles to the ground. Our tree does not scream. Our tree is angry, perhaps, and she wonders who has been resting in her branches. “I think that’s a no. We can just light the damn tree up.”
Dean has chopped down a tree before. Splinters wiggled their way into the palm of his hands from the rough handle of the ax. He was a teenager, that time, sent out to the back to chop firewood while his dad and a friend talked business. Sammy had been sitting on the back porch cross-legged, his nose tucked into a book.
The man named Dean Winchester has been running a flashlight through the underbrush. Our tree does not know what he is looking for nor why is here, but she is interested. She doesn’t get a lot of midnight visitors and her ghost has been angry lately because her branch is beginning to rot, as is the way of things.
She is rooted, and cannot travel, our tree, and her ghosts are tethered to the woods, and they hear from the deer and the rabbits about what is happening in the farmland nearby. Nothing changes for a long time, the girl coming and going quietly in her branches, and our tree does not think much of it. Trees are not so attuned to human nature, after all, not even those with ghosts among their branches.
This is a story about a tree.
The angel closes his eyes and our tree feels a voice in her heartwood.
Her ghost screams and stands on the branch that has begun to die. The ghost pushes and our tree feels a pain unlike she has ever felt before, the loss of one of her oldest limbs, at the behest of someone she considered a companion.
Somewhere, sitting in the passenger seat of the Impala, Castiel says, “There will be trees in our heaven.”
. Those are the words he says but our tree knows a language far deeper than words, and hears what else he is saying, the words and feelings that are leaking out of him.
“The ghost could come back at any moment,” Dean says. The ghost is the girl, our tree knows, and she thinks that maybe she’s always known.
Our tree feels an angel. I know we said that our tree does not care about angels but she also has never been in the presence of one. This angel, he is confined by his vessel, and he has been cast out of the official ranks of heaven, but our tree does not know this. She hears the rumble of the car and she feels the essence of an angel.
, our tree whispers to me, into the great dark sky. She feels settled. She is at peace and she is healed, and she has met an angel who is more of a man than the god she had always expected. Dean Winchester pulls his angel into a hug. For our tree, life goes on.
Our tree, like many trees, knows of angels. Trees, especially the American Black Walnut, know more than anyone gives them credit for. Water seeps through their roots, water that is older than any man who may pause to lean against them for a drink of water, older than any songbird that may spend a season singing in their leaves. Water may not have a personality of its own, or if it does, it is so slow moving that only the rocks themselves know of it, but our tree learns from it all the same. And water tells of angels.
Our tree knows about haunting because one summer the girl presses her necklace into the bark at her base. She thinks nothing of it at the time, for she is a tree, and to pay attention to every deer that scratches itself against her trunk and every gust of wind through her branches is against her very nature. But she feels it later, as her bark closes around it, and although the weight of the girl is gone from her branches, she can still hear her.
Dean looks at him and then back at the road. He says, “Okay.”
There was a girl, once, the only girl to find her way up our trees tall, strong trunk to reach the branches far above the ground. She came, summer after summer, and our tree can still feel her weight in the v between two of her branches if the evening light slants in just the right way. Our tree loves the chattering of the squirrels and the chirping of the birds and she mourns when men with guns come into her woods and shoot them one by one, carrying them out in burlap sacks. More animals, the cousins and grandchildren of those who once rested in her branches, find their way back, and they skitter across her branches, but none more choose her for a nest.
But for now, she is still living on that hill. A girl ran up to her and cried out with delight to her mother that the tree was so big she couldn’t reach her arms around the trunk. Our tree lives on in Iowa, and our tree believes in angels. And so do I.
“Here?” the angel moves his hand. The tree knows that she could tell him where the necklace is. He could take it from her, if he wished. A trees thoughts are trivial to read for an angel, they are written on the veins of her leaves, in the grooves of her bark.
Our tree is angry too, as trees do not like pollution in their water and in their air, but she does not reek of rage like her ghost does. All she can do is provide for the birds that nest in her crown, provide a home for the creatures that make their way across her branches, and so she does. Her ghost used to like to watch the birds and tried to coax cardinals and bluejays closer to her invisible form, but now the moments that she visits are seeped in revenge. Our tree understands, but she does not speak the same language as the girl, does not know how to tell her that sometimes, it all must come to an end.
This wasn't fair at all. The angel had been a virgin a mere half an hour ago and now he was rocking Dean's world so hard that he could barely think straight.
"Say it," Castiel ordered before jamming harshly inside of him when Dean didn't reply, too out of it to think straight. "Say it, Dean! Say you're mine!"
"You can watch if you want," Dean offered, not wanting him to be bored while he worked his hole open. Licking his lips, he leaned over a bit in front of the window where there was a little ledge he could plant his free hand on while his other one got to work. Legs spread, he pushed a finger past the ring of muscle, hissing at the feeling of the cool liquid seeping inside of him. "Damn, you enjoying this?"
The hands holding him suddenly tightened around him and Dean found himself pushed to the bed. He landed with a gasp of surprise before the angel was on top of him, kissing him again to silence any possible protests. Groaning deeply in the back of his throat, he found himself getting flushed as Castiel drug himself against the man, feeling the hard and hot cock against his hip. The tongue in his mouth was surprisingly forceful, pushing against his own, sliding together in a wet and sloppy kiss. Panting a little as the angel drew away, a string of saliva hung between their mouths and he found himself blushing deeply at how damn dirty the angel was looking at him right now.
“You deserve to be saved.”
Dean only sits up to let Cas scoot back further on the bed, divesting them both of their shirts at the same time. It leaves Cas in boxers and Dean still in his jeans, and Cas tugs at Dean’s belt, murmurs into his mouth, “I want these off.” Dean obliges, breaking their kiss to kick his jeans off somewhere in the direction of the door. He’s back on Cas in a flash, crawling on top of him and pushing him back down into the sheets.
“I know. And I know you were disappointed, too,” Dean says quietly. “We weren’t what you wanted, or at least our lives aren’t the lives you wanted for us. So I guess we have to work out reconciling all this shit.”
“Well, yeah.” Dean’s hand moves down to rest on the back of his neck. “But we’ve also got Christian’s trial coming up, my mom’s case, Gwen and the baby, the search for Caleb… I have to stay for a lot of reasons.”
Which led to now, and Dean looking over a cluttered desk at the local sheriff, a petite woman who reminds Dean so much of Farrah Fawcett circa Charlie’s Angels, feathery curls and all, it’s hard for him not to call her Jill Munroe. If it was maybe three or four years ago Dean would be laying on the charm as thick as possible, flirting with her with a very clear goal in mind — them both in bed, not sleeping at all.
“What do you remem—” Cas starts to say to the ceiling, then stops. “What do you know about me besides my name?”
Cas raises an eyebrow at him and Dean coughs awkwardly.
Cas glances down at his shirt as he takes his seat. He’s still covered in dirt and dust, even though he washed his hands before sitting down.
“I don’t know.” The words crack as Dean says them, broken and hopeless. “Who’s gonna protect her from him now? That was my
Cas tilts his head, which only pushes it further into his pillow. His eyes are watering again, and Dean thinks
Cas’s hands are still shaking. Dean can’t help but look at them, and when Cas sees him staring, he quickly folds them together, clasping his fingers tightly to still the tremors.
Uneasy, Cas moves to the bathroom door, knocking a harsh
“We won’t,” he reassures her. And, because a mark of his brand is dramatic exits, Cas takes a running leap off the side of the building, letting his wingsuit spread to catch his fall.
It quickly becomes apparent that Cas’s leftover grace is all but useless.
belly up in a sunspot right in the middle of the living room. “This shouldn’t be taking this long.”
Dean waits until he’s sure his husband is gone, tucked safely in their bed in the room just down the hall from the kids’. Then he opens the trunk.
He doesn’t ask why Cas left as they climb into the car. He doesn’t ask why Cas freaked out at the gala as he turns the Impala on. He doesn’t ask why Cas came back as the soft sounds of the radio fill the car. And when Cas looks at him searchingly, Dean keeps his eyes on the road. He doesn’t ask Cas if he ever loved Dean the way Dean loves him. He’s pretty sure the answer is no.
As for how to repel them... Dean’s wearing his jacket inside out, because he read somewhere that helps, and carrying a tiny gold bell he found at antique store. Bells and gold, they’re both supposed to... do something, he can’t remember. Dean’s still not sleeping well, even off the night shift, and his head pounds in time with his heart as he walks through the trees.
“I don’t know... I don’t know.” Dean’s eyes were always watery, his answers shaky. Sam hated it. He hated how tender Dean sounded, talking to the walls, only to look at Sam like something had been ripped from him every time he snapped back to the real world.
“Are you going to use it?” Dean asks, trying not to think too hard about how much of his life he wrote over when he forgot Cas. He points at the vial with his free hand.
“No, no, no. You’re fine,” Dean stutters. “Just, we don’t normally... uh... get to know civilians on a job, you know?”
“On vacation, ma’am. Went home to Minnesota for the week. I’m the lead here, unless of course you’d like to take over.” Gordon manages to deliver this speech while glaring over Mills’ shoulder at Cas.
left behind.
Claire stretches, arms held high above her head and fingers interlocked. “I wanted to talk to you,” she says.
Cas has turned the water back on. That’s the first thing Dean notices, that it’s running again, spilling into the tub and sending eddies whirling over Cas’s feet. He blinks groggily.
“Don’t worry,” Anna says in his ear, as if sensing his thoughts. “I’ve got the cameras taken care of. Just get in and get out fast.”
“For a bit. I lost track of his trail quickly in the dark. And I didn’t want to follow him into some sort of trap, if that was his intention.”
“Let him talk,” insists another voice, a younger man. Sam.
“I don’t mind hearing about your life, Dean,” Cas says earnestly. “You can tell me anything. I just don’t have the skills to suggest coping methods and Pam does.”
“It doesn’t mean he’s a drug dealer, either,” Cas snaps, causing Bobby’s eyebrows to shoot up toward his hairline. “And even if he were, he would still deserve to be saved.”
“You almost did. You wanted to!”
“Dean, stop. It’s stuck. This isn’t working.”
It’s long and it’s lonely, and it somehow feels even worse this time around. When he drove out to California all he could think about was how much he needed to see Jess’s grave, to talk to her about this. He plotted what he would say, like she was actually going to hear. Then, once he got there and purged his grief over Dean, over his entire, broken life, he'd left, feeling empty and guilty. Jess didn’t need to hear any of that. He’d brought enough pain into her life without it spilling over into her death.
She’s walking away from him now, and Dean doesn’t feel the loss at quite the magnitude he expected to. The Braedens are okay. Ben will go to school, be a badass engineer. Lisa will figure out how to thrive without her son by her side, running that gym like a boss and probably being the coolest person in all of Michigan. They’ll live, because Dean helped save them. He’s not going to dwell on the negatives, for once. He’s just going to let this feel good.
“Seventy percent is a C, Sammy. Thought you were one of those straight A suck-ups.”
His death from cancer was very tragic, and many who’d met him through his business flocked to the funeral. They took a look at the beautiful Winchester family — the wife and three children Sam left behind — and clucked their tongues in pity. “Oh, how sad,” the people of Clarence said, “those poor babies left without a father. That poor woman left without her husband.”
Even superpowered, he won’t last too long like this. Cas needs to find Dean and get out.
“Cas, I —“ Dean’s a little out of breath and also terrified.
The other angel doesn’t move, watching James back away with a smirk on his face. Dean wonders if they even remember him, that guy they chunked into a tree thirty seconds ago.
Dean spreads his arms open with a cheeky grin, as if to say
Lisa is watching him with that sad look on her face, the one that reminds him of sitting on the stairs at Bobby’s, trying to think of a way to make their relationship work and failing to come up with a suitable plan. They were always doomed, Dean and Lisa. But in so many ways, ways she won’t ever remember, she and Ben saved his life. Without them, with Sam and Cas both gone, Dean knows he would have taken a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. There’s no other way around it. This night is not enough to repay them for the year in which they took him in, sheltered and loved him, and he knows it. There’s nothing Dean can say, especially when Ben doesn’t even know who he is, no way that he can possibly thank them enough.
As he reaches his car, Dean turns and asks, “Are you following us back?”
Dean throws the last of his underwear in his bag and yanks viciously on the zipper. He watches the dot symbolizing Cas on the tracker on his phone and thinks
They live in Army-provided housing on base, so the television, much like the rest of the furniture, is cheap. The picture is blurred and grainy and Cas wishes, not for the first time, that his parents had normal civilian jobs so he could watch The A-Team on a 25-inch screen like the one his cousin Balthazar’s parents bought this summer. Instead, he’s squinting at their 13-inch from a foot away, ass on a pillow so he doesn’t have to touch the gross shag carpet more than he needs to.
It was easier to stay here with Cas waiting for him back in the car, despite the nights spent in long bouts of uncomfortable silence or stilted conversation. With Cas next to him half of Dean’s thoughts were focused on his former crush, half on the haunted road. And now — well, Dean’s still thinking about both of those things, but when he’s alone his brain has more time to obsess. He’s split between worrying he’s going to die on a fucking favor job and wondering what the hell Cas meant when he said, “If I didn’t love you.”
“You could get rid of that
The drive is uneventful.
It’s stupid. There’s a possibly demonic-in-origin light on the road and it might show up again at any minute. All the foundations of the natural world shifted when the light first dropped out over the bridge, and Dean is watching Cas sleep.
“No, goddamn it.” Ann Marie leans against the kitchen counter and puts her head in her hands. “Callie, I said, ‘Start coffee.’ Start coffee!”
“Can’t Gordon or Jo handle it?” he asks, not meaning to be petulant, although that’s how it comes off.
The road roller is off — engine quiet, lights out, stopped a few feet short of the skid steer loaders. Other than its broken window and new parking spot, it looks like the rest of the equipment — parked, silent, not deadly in the least.
“Alicia and Max went at it again. They’ll both need another box.”
Alastair was supposed to be leaving secure custody on Thursday. It’s Tuesday. But his route will be the same. Cas and Michael memorized it when Naomi sent them the assignment last week. During negotiations, Alastair stayed under the watchful eye of the Lawrence government at Hotel Cicero. His new lodgings are on 7
She eyes him calmly, cooly. “I disagree. I think you could make something good come out of this if you’d try.”
In the end, it doesn’t happen in any monumental way. There is no tear-soaked confession, no bloody kiss, no raging fight with those three words thrown in as a white flag.
It leans down over Dean’s bag, carefully withdrawing the demon-killing knife and turning it over, looking at the markings etched into the blade. The demon smiles.
“A flame,” he says, “which oft, they say, some evil spirit attends.” He closes his eyes and leans his head back against the seat, reciting from memory, “Hovering and blazing with delusive light, misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way to bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool; there swallowed up and... And lost.”
Cas slides back across the seat and gathers his things, and Dean refuses to look at him. He hears the door open, hears Cas get out and say quietly, “Goodnight, Dean.”
Dean isn’t finished talking, and Cas realizes he might be on the verge of hearing the full story of what happened to his friend. The boat is already rocking, and Cas isn’t sure he’s ready for the waves.
“Dean kicked her out.”
“I don’t want to run,” Dean says, shoulders slumping in exhaustion. “I’m so tired of feeling scared all the time. I want to face him, but— Cas, he’s not gonna go down without a fight. And I don’t want anyone else to get hurt.”
“I know,” Cas says kindly. “I understand.” Sam thinks,
“Good.” He shakes Ellen a little to keep her focused. “Stay out here and call Anna. Tell her to come
“Dean, what the hell?” Sam says, clearly both angry and confused. Dean knows immediately he’s really done a bang-up job this time, thoroughly pissing off both of them. Sam and Cas are a certified nightmare when they decide to tag-team him. “For one thing, I can take care of myself, in case you’ve managed to forget that in the space of the what, the one week since we last had this exact conversation? And for another, Cas has always looked out for both of us. I trust him with my life, and I don’t really give a damn if you don’t...” Sam pauses here, taking a deep breath to either calm himself down or to rejuvenate before he continues ranting. “But I know you do, so again, what the hell?”
To be fair, he worries about his brother a lot these days. It’s like a pastime, and an ironic one at that, considering how much time he’s spent wishing Dean would stop worrying so much about him.
She exits to the hall, speaking quietly to Diana, and Sam turns his attention to Cas. His friend is worrying a loose button on his jacket, yet another variation of that trench coat he loved so much. Cas buys a new one every couple of years, though he confided in Sam once, “It’s never the same as the first.” Sam is pretty sure Cas wasn’t just talking about the coat.
He’s shaking. It’s an unusual response. A human response. Cas can’t believe he’s said it — a decade of affection and respect and longing, put into three words.
“Blood pressure was high and respiratory rate was low. Clear ligature marks on the neck, consistent with hanging with weight unsupported. We stabilized his neck with a cervical collar then preformed an endotracheal intubation. He’s currently sedated and breathing with assistance, but brain scans have come back normal, which is very good news. We’ll know more when he wakes up, but for now he’s stable.”
“And you’ll swear on the record you enjoyed this?” Cas asks, hacking his spaghetti into tiny pieces with his fork.
“I’m taking the interstate around it,” he says, avoiding her knowing gaze. “And I’m not that fragile, Ams.”
“Sam,” Dean croaks, and Lucifer laughs with his brother’s vocal cords, making Sam’s chuckle come out distorted and harsh and completely wrong.
As if he could relax. He’s just learned he was kidnapped by his own grandparents as a child and now he’s in love with the man who is arguably his best, and currently his only, friend. He would sign to her that his life is a nightmare but he doesn’t know the sign for nightmare. Eileen’s refrained from teaching him the bleak stuff. He glares at her like she’s done it on purpose and she gives him a cringey sort of smile, misunderstanding.
“If it will make you feel better, you can pay me back someday if you’d like. But I don’t mind helping.” Dean just stares at Cas, incredulous. Cas keeps his gaze even and his voice mild as he says, “Call it a favor from a friend.”
Anna’s still staring at Dean, uncomfortably so. She doesn’t so much as blink when she says, “Yes, well. I wouldn’t say genius.” Her eyes slide to Cas and he makes a
Sam's not sure how he actually feels about the amulet — on one hand, it’s a symbol of his beloved brother, who wore it constantly for the majority of their lives, a marker of how much the Winchesters loved and relied on one another. On the other hand, it’s also a symbol of another side of Dean — the Dean who threw it away at a low point in all of their lives, the Dean who later took on the Mark, the Dean who left Cas and Sam behind to pick up the pieces without him. But Sam doesn't say any of that to Cas.
“I’ll tell you anything you want to know,” he says earnestly, and Dean looks away before he can ask “Where were you?” If Cas didn’t care to tell him anything back then, Dean doesn’t care to know now. At least, that’s what he tells himself.
Cas turns and quirks an eyebrow at Dean.
Dean immediately stops stroking, tightening his hand around the bottom of his cock because
I’m on my way. :)
He wants to say
Finally —
.” And he turns on his heel and heads back to the cabin. They'll fix their crap later. They always do.
“Of course,” Henriksen promises. “The Bureau will help handle all the details. You just need to get to the airport on time.”
forget what Corruption feels like.” Maybe he was wrong earlier, thinking Balthazar would understand if Cas told them the truth — that fifteen years later, he still lies awake at night and remembers the screams, feels the burning in his lungs. Azazel’s impassive eyes, Alastair’s hands on his throat. “I’m telling you, Hellfire’s power felt similar but it isn’t the same.”
“No,” Mills says, while at the same time Cas growls, “I can talk to them if need be.”
“I told him maybe he just didn’t have the right type of peanut butter,” Claire continues. “And apparently he went out and bought every kind he could find to try.”
“Who was it?”
Cas is quick when he opens the trunk, delivering a sharp blow to Alastair’s face before the man can cry out again, then stuffing a grease-covered rag into his mouth. Alastair tries to bite him, and Cas punches him again. The thin, wiry man falls back into the trunk, his sharp cheekbones mottled with bruises and blood. That he’s still conscious enough to glare at Cas after the beating he’s taken tonight is a testament to his stamina. Cas slaps duck tape across his mouth in retribution.
Sam and Dean wake up at the same time in a field, only this time they remember everything.
Does that mean his father doesn’t love him? “How should I know?”
The Winchesters would be disappointed in him for letting the ghoul go so easily, but Cas tries to convince himself he’s done letting them judge the morality of his actions — done letting them judge his humanity.
“No one is talking to Chuck,” Anna says, looking between her brothers. “We have no idea how he’d react to this. I doubt it would go well.”
Rufus walks back to his crew, yelling out, “Listen up, slackers! Thanks to Detective Winchester, you have been granted a brief reprieve! Everyone’s goin’ home for the day!”
“I want you to leave,” he says, and he goes inside and closes the door behind him.
Then everything goes black.
“Unbelievable. You can quote Steve Winwood to me, but I can’t even bring up JoJo?”
Cas stands transfixed next to Dean, who’s surprised to see the other man staring at the light with a beatific smile on his face. Cas starts to walk.
“Yet,” Dean snaps. “He hasn’t done anything wrong
“I’m an angel of the Lord.”
“That day” is how the Winchesters — Mary, her husband John, and their son Sam — refer to November 2, 1983. It started off like any normal November day, cold and wet. Dean was too young to be in anything more than a twice-a-week preschool hosted by the local church, and Sam was a six-month-old baby, so Mary stayed home with them while John worked at the auto shop down the street. That afternoon he came home early, and the whole family went to the Piggly Wiggly to shop for groceries.
on that road, and they don’t have to!”
He does it now.
“Good, good,” Dean says, letting out a relieved breath. “Well, everything is good here, but Cas and I are gonna stay the night, keep an eye out on things. We saw a motel just down the highway a few minutes from here. You should get a room for the night, get some rest.”
“This isn’t possible,” Cas says, shaking his head. “Michael can’t know your future.”
Dean’s next shot goes wide. He spins to face her, and she shoves his gun down before the barrel hits her. “What the fuck, Dean?”
“No.” Sam shakes his head. “You antagonize him, and that won’t get us anywhere.”
He’s grateful to see Jody coming through the front door behind the agents. At last, a friendly face. He doesn’t know what Eileen did, but he’s glad she convinced her bosses to let himself and Jody stay on Dean’s case as consultants. Dean needs all the friends he get, and Cas knows he still doesn’t trust the FBI — not even Eileen, though he’s trying to.
Cas gets in his car and drives. He keeps his eyes peeled, watching the shoulder of the road and the empty parking lots of closed storefronts as they pass. It starts to rain as he hits the middle of town, the sky vast and gray overhead. He heads west. There’s more room to run that way. It’s what he did when he ran — picked the direction with the most highway in front of him.
Eileen turns to him and signs,
Cas flicks his wrist to send the rope and mouse flying from one end of the room to the other as he sets up his laptop with his free hand. Gracie only plays for a few swipes before she embarrasses herself by leaping for the mouse and falling flat, slinking off to hide under the table and lick her wounds. Cas, left alone, starts up an email to the regional director.
Cas can almost picture it — the first human soul he ever saw. It shone brilliantly, so powerful, even though it was cracked and worn, marked by Hell. All the angels were astonished. They’d had no idea how much of God’s own grace had been given to the humans until that moment.
“Oh, Turner didn’t know I was publishing it. That was all Charlie. And once something’s on the internet, you can’t take it back. Plus—” Dean raises his eyebrows pointedly, “—I know the source, and I happen to trust him with my life. Thank Anna for the info dump when you get the chance.”
Dean erases the whiteboard with a swipe of his hand, turning his palm blue. He writes “I have nothing else scheduled this morning” and holds it up with a cheeky grin.
Cas drops the washcloth in the tub and pulls Dean to his feet.
“What
He wants to know if Green Eyes is going to be alright, but he’s not sure they’ll be able to tell him anything. He knows he can’t go back to work and take a bunch of elementary school kids on an introductory hike when he has the image of Green Eyes’ face stuck in his head, veins bulging as he tried to breathe around the rope pulling at his throat. Cas rubs his hands over his eyes, repressing a shudder.
“You know, my family doesn’t want me, either.”
He’s doing it — he’s
“Will we be friends?” he asks tentatively, because other kids have friends and he wants them too.
“The Winchester family crest — ‘saving people, hunting things, fucking over the world.’”
“Dean!” That’s Sam running for him, but Dean waves him away toward his bag.
On the third night of the most boring stakeout in the history of stakeouts, Cas comes back.
Sam refuses to rise to the bait. “It needs to be you. You know it does. Snappy voicemails are not gonna work, Dean. You need to go get him.” Sam sighs, and his whole body seems to deflate with it. He’s not sleeping well, either. Dean can tell from the bags under his eyes. Rowena, Jack, Mom, Cas — Sam’s carrying them all with him, all the time. “Whatever happened, you need to make an effort to fix it. We need him.”
His fingers twitch, dying to type out so many questions, like “what kind of job?” or “why are you staying in one place?” He’s pretty sure he knows the answer to that last one.
“Dean,” Sam whispers, urgent. “He’s not a person! And he could wake up and recover and kill us all without a thought. You
Sam shudders. “Can we not talk about that?” he asks.
He had hoped for this, thought it might be true. He never expected Dean to say it aloud.
“Feathers,” Crowley croons, rocking back on his heels and taking Cas in. “You’ve looked better.”
“Because the Demons set off the bomb to get our attention, ma’am,” Walker says, and he points to a solitary city bus sitting in the now empty street. “And now they’ve taken hostages in that bus, and they’re threatening to kill them all if we come any closer.”
“Not here. Relax. The librarian was super nice. She let me send it there and Lee picked it up for me later. As for the credit card…” She winks. “A girl has her secrets.”
“You’re in the cage,” he whispers. “You cannot be here.”
It's a slight concern, that a vengeful supernatural being might attack the funeral for the most famous hunter in the United States. But it’s been all quiet so far.
But of course Sam would bring Lisa right back to the forefront of his mind, all for the sake of one of his girly, heavy-on-the-feelings conversations.
“Remember,” Cas finishes. “I know. You don’t remember me; Sam doesn’t either. I’ve never met Eileen until now, but if she knew of me she doesn’t remember. Claire Novak, Jody Mills — I tried to go to them, right after that, and they looked at me like I was a complete stranger, even though Claire —” Cas rubs a hand across his mouth, trying to pull himself together. “Dean, whatever you did, it was thorough. No one remembered me — no one who’s human, at least. You took any path I might have had out and blocked it. You left me to fend for myself as a near-human for a second time and never told me why. When Joshua restores your memories tomorrow, I don’t expect you to still care for me like you do now.”
“Wh— What,” Cas sputters incoherently. Naomi Novak looms over him, hands on her hips.
Cas looks around the mill. It’s dark, but his grace is strong enough to help his eyes adjust quickly. The floors are rotted in places, and the machinery that litters the space is rusted and grimy. But it’s sort of beautiful nonetheless. There’s so much moss growing everywhere, along the floor and over the walls. Tree branches reach in through the upper windows, and ivy has claimed the beams of the ceiling. The takeover of mother nature has turned the neglect of time into a beautiful, hidden garden.
Cas is staring ahead stoically, per usual, and Dean bites back the urge to ask him what he’s thinking. They walk in silence to the fork, the only sounds the crunching of leaves and twigs under their shoes. Then they split off, Lisa not slowing down to wait on Dean, and he loses the sounds of Cas and Sam walking away to the ambient noises of the woods.
Dean stares at him, now dry and pushing his way out from under the table, dragging his trench coat through the sand. Dean hurries to follow, sitting on the bench next to Cas. The sun is out, and there’s no sign of the storm except for the sound of retreating thunder.
She’s crying again. John is, too. Sam comes on, voice slightly more level than his parents’. “We’ll take the first flight you can get us out of Kansas City. Just — text us the details on the tickets. I’ll tell Adam, too. Can you get him home?”
“I— I went to the Roadhouse a few days ago.”
“Nuh uh!” Gwen only laughs at him, and they wrestle in the dirt like the wild children they are until one of the adults yells, “Cut it out you two!” Laughing, competition forgotten for a moment, they sprint behind the mess hall to wash up in the big outdoor sinks.
“You should be thanking me and my angel-blade bullets for saving your life, Novak.”
“No, thank you.” Cas leans forward, putting his forehead against a vent. “They know I’m new, and they can smell the fear on me. Like animals. It will pass.”
“No,” Dean says, scrambling up. A flower near his ankle actually
Dean scoffs. “Are you kidding me, man? I can’t talk to anyone but you, I’m hardly sleeping, and I can’t even eat.” He laughs bitterly. “I used to
Perhaps it’s time for a new life, one that he chooses. After all, things are better down here on Earth with the people he loves.
If he starts again maybe you should wake him up. I can come in there, too, if you need me.
No response. Not a nod or even a blink. Cas’s lips twists as she tries to think of a way to get Dean to open up again.
“Hey,” Dean says, and then he’s right there, wrapping his arms around Cas slowly, like he’s giving Cas an out, a way to step back. Cas doesn’t. Now that he knows what it feels like to be really held by Dean, he wants the warmth of these arms around him again and again. “I’ve had them, too, man. All the fucking time right after Hell. And a few other situations.” He doesn’t say Purgatory, but Cas knows.
“Cas,” Dean says, “I’m a major hypocrite for saying this because trust me, I know daddy issues. But my friend Ch— My best friend always says to me, ‘You need therapy for that.’ Sounds like maybe you need therapy, not money.”
“Blade of the Head Reaper?”
“Why are you here, then?” Castiel asks, and it’s almost refreshing to see him unafraid, a glint in his eye.
He’s almost to the chip spreader when the light vanishes, blinking out of existence. Dean slows down and shines his own flashlight over the equipment, looking for any sign of the mystery vandal.
Mary nods, biting her lip. Then she asks, “Will you?”
“That’s fine,” Dean manages, though he feels his limbs short-circuiting from being so close to Cas. They want to reach out, hold him without Dean’s explicit approval. “I’m starved.”
“I think I am, actually.”
If there’s a god out there (and Cas isn’t convinced there is), he laughs in Cas’s face. As soon as he’s said those overconfident words, an earth-shattering
Four days after Leahy’s visit, Cas decides to ask Dean about the man at the Roadhouse.
Dean grins at him.
Charlie is staring at him with That Look on her face. Dean’s been on the receiving end of said look a lot over the years, and it never bodes well for him. So he’s choosing to ignore it.
“Still my favorite.” Dean smirks at her, and Eileen shakes her head.
Cas untangles his legs from Dean, still laughing as he reaches up to turn off the spray. Dean watches Cas settle back on the floor of the shower with a quiet, awkward smile. This night has been miserable and he’s positive his nose is bleeding again, but right now he lets himself feel joy for the moment they’re in. Ridiculous, uninhibited joy, in spite of everything.
Green Eyes’ lips part, but no sound comes out. For a moment, Cas sees something in his eyes, something beyond the cloud of drugs and weariness.
“I saw your mom,” she tells him one day over Skype, both speaking and signing the words. Sam's been signing back at her — it gets easier every time they talk — but he wasn't expecting that.
“Where exactly did you find him?”
God, Sam hates to think that violence like this needed no reason, no justification. Seth felt like hurting someone, so he did, and now that hurt has spread in a ripple effect — hitting James, then Dean, now Sam and Eileen.
Dean smiles, and, even though he’s still terrified, the weight on his chest feels lighter. “You do make me happy.”
He’s tempted to say no, but, as he reminds himself daily, he is not his father. “Go for it,” Cas tells them, and Jack immediately pops up and takes off jogging toward Ellen’s house. Cas smells the pie on the wind and rolls his eyes fondly.
“Whoever did this doesn’t deserve to be protected,” Cas tells her, voice firm with conviction, “but Dean does.”
“No, fuck no!” He shouts so loudly Sam has to move the phone away from his ear. “Seth has James, Sam! He showed me... It’s....”
material? He blows another can away. He shouldn’t have said yes. He should have known Samuel would intervene.
Silence, then he can feel the bed sink down again, a warm hand placed over his back.
“What?”
“That kid,” he says, jerking his thumb toward the door, “has got a mind for machines
Everyone turns to Joshua. He grimaces.
He can’t see Cas in the dark, but he can imagine his frown — that slight downturn of his lips, the little creases between his eyebrows, the narrowing of his eyes.
His brother laughs bitterly.
Instead he strokes Dean’s cheek, and Dean leans into his hand, eyes falling closed. He knows it’s enough when Dean says, “Yeah, Cas. Me too.”
He laughs, sharp and bitter. “That’s rich coming from you. You spent almost fifteen years acting as prison guard to a psychopath just because Chuck asked you to.”
.” He shudders, gagging. “But when I saw how he was still so attached to you, memories or no memories, it all finally made sense.” Lucifer gestures behind him, and another bolt of lightning illuminates the demons guarding a massive tree that Dean recognizes — they’re right behind the bunker. “The bulk of it did come home eventually, just not in the way I expected it to.”
come back for you this time.”
But Sam’s not done.
“I can be done now,” he says. “I think they’ve soaked enough.”
No, the people of Clarence, Nebraska, know nothing about the Winchesters.
Ben pulls Lisa back in to his side with one arm, and she smiles faintly at Dean as Ben reaches his other hand out.
“All by a river, Dean.” Sam moves away from the water wheel to scan over some of the old pumps and machinery attached to it. “That says water-based creature to me.”
“Oh, hi,” Dean says, turning his dazzling, high-cheekboned face upon her as if his charm is a disease from which no one is immune. “You must be Claire Novak?”
Dean arrives right on time, and Cas lets him in through the back door of the former servants’ quarters. They hold hands as they walk through the hall to the kitchen. Dean says, “This is a lot less ostentatious than the ballroom I was in the last time I was here.”
is unspoken. “You’ve already got him locked in warded rooms; I don’t need to take him out. His Corruption isn’t strong enough to break free. He must have only been in the Pool once.”
“So,” Dean says, “why don’t you let me and my brother help you find it?”
Gerald is hunched over the table, head in his hands, shoulders shuddering. Eileen has her hand comfortingly resting on his shoulder, saying something too quietly to hear from this far away. Cas looks mildly perplexed. Human emotions in all their complexity and suddenness are still somewhat foreign to him, especially when he has to process the reactions of total strangers.
It takes Sam a week to ask Dean where Cas went.
“Your only sister.”
“I like it,” Dean says, all false cheer. “It looks gnarly, man. Chicks dig scars.”
“They should still be asleep by the time it’s all said and done. Drop-off is at 6.”
Cas chose to stay behind and look up lore, a decision the brothers accepted without argument. Really, though, he plans to do a bit of research and then maybe catch a quick episode of
The sun has drifted below the horizon when Dean finally hears Cas’s key turning in the lock downstairs. He’s been gone all day. Dean’s drunken stupor faded hours ago, leaving him depressingly sober and alone. He lost track of time, crawled up the stairs and into Cas’s bed, dragged the quilts over his shoulders. Dean’s curled in a ball on the bed with his back to the door when Cas comes in. He waits, silent, wondering if he can get away with pretending to be asleep if only so Cas doesn’t kick him out right here and now.
Cas hugs Dean back tightly, feels Dean relax into it, his head falling onto Cas’s shoulder. The way Dean shows love best is by taking care of people, Cas knows. He’s willing to let Dean love him like that. And in return, Cas will keep loving him with his words, because even in the short time they’ve spent together with nothing left unsaid between them, he’s seen how well Dean responds to being told what he means to Cas.
Cas glances at Bobby and Garth, both sitting at their desks and pretending not to listen. He knows for fact they both are supposed to be out on patrol right now. “The kitchen has a table to set up at,” he says, gesturing toward the back room. Dean’s standing in the corner, arms folded and silent, tensing as Reidy nods at him from across the room. “We can go in there.”
Dean scoffs.
“Claire Novak’s dad?” That catches his attention. Dean’s scrambling now, putting the Impala in drive to move it away from the warehouse. This takes precedent.
— would let him lay his head in her lap when he was a child. But this feels distinctly different, intimate in a way he’s not familiar with. Dean closes his eyes. Even when Cas turns on the television, all Dean’s thinking about is the pit growing in his stomach and the fingers running through his hair.
Of course, that brief security net is out the window once the FBI figure out that Dean and Cas cleared out their motel room and took off. They might try to pursue the imposters, or they might stay caught up in this case. Either way, Dean’s not taking any chances.
She nods, a knowing half smile on her face. Whether it’s sincere or an aborted grimace at his shock, Cas doesn’t know. Leahy gestures toward the elevator.
When he stops in the grocery store to pick up more milk, Mabel behind the counter waves at him. When he goes to the lumber yard to fill out a new order, gruff Bud claps him on the shoulder and thanks him for his business. Stewie at the gas station asks if he wants to try a Snickers or a Milky Way this time, and Tracey, the little girl who’s always playing hopscotch outside the house next door to the Conaco, reminds him to come back on Tuesday for her lemonade stand. Fifty cents for one cup.
“I’m here every night.” Dean aims for flippant but misses by a mile. “I sleep in the day now, so... No availability.”
“Sorry,” Dean repeats, “I don’t know what’s—”
“Dean,” Sam says, and then his brother is right next to him, hovering at his shoulder. “What the hell?”
The agent doesn’t catch this. “Alright,” he mutters. “Then get ready to wade into the mess, because trust me — cults? Always messy.”
, Cas thinks.
Dean grimaces. “I don’t think she’s my wife. That just feels… wrong. And people can’t see the future, Gwen.”
“So that’s the governmental feeding plan that has you all looking like demi-gods? Junk food?”
Cas spent all this time not sure he deserved to be saved, and Dean saved him anyway. He runs his hand through Dean’s hair, and Dean leans in toward him, sighing quietly when their lips touch softly, reverently, completing a transition from antagonists to allies to friends to... now. And something more. Something new.
“Fine,” he manages to say. “But if Reidy fucks this up—”
“I can see inside people,” Jack says. “You were hungry.”
“Your fucking brother —”
Mills turns to Cas. “Can you two get close enough to figure that out? Break into buildings, jump from rooftops, I don’t care. We need numbers.”
He thinks of Cas quoting
Cas gives him a clear That’s Very Hypocritical of You, Dean look. Dean just wipes at his eyes.
Dean’s trembling. Cas squeezes his knee. “Yes,” he manages. “I— I do.”
Dean nods, then realizing Cas can’t see him, says, “Yeah, yeah of course.” He spots a clean bowl sitting next to a bottle of saline solution. He pours the solution into the bowl, then eyes the way Cas’s feet are resting against the bed. He’ll have to sit on the edge of the bed to reach them.
She passes over what looks like a photo copy of an old yearbook page. Judging by the bright patterned background, Cas guesses it’s from the ‘90s.
“We know,” Anna says, and Ellen shakes her head. As she walks away, Cas hears her mutter, “Still like a bunch of kids…”
“Always, Dean,” Cas says, and Dean feels a hand press down on his arm, squeezing lightly, just once, before Cas moves it away again.
Claire is quiet for several seconds before she says, “Yeah. True.”
Dean cradles the amulet in his palms as if it’s something precious. Something familiar. The look on his face is unlike any Cas has seen him wear before — his mouth parted in shock, eyes slightly watery.
“Good job, Dean,” Papa says, and Dean tries not to beam. Praise from Papa is rare indeed, and Dean’s learned the best way to earn it is to be good at the stuff Papa asks him to do — fight training and sharpshooting.
Sam nods, says something about how it’s likely nothing but an accident. Dean looks at Lisa and is horrified to note that with her new, cropped haircut she looks sort of like that fiery chick who kicked Tony Stark’s ass in
“Dean!” Jody bursts into the room, grabbing Creaser by the shoulder and pushing him back into his chair. He flops down, yielding like a rag doll.
Sam sighs, but he stands with Cas, pulling him into a hug. “Don’t worry,” he says, voice muffled as he talks into Cas’s shoulder. “I got the bill.”
He does remember the answer, somehow.
“You have no idea the sacrifices I have made for this city,” Cas snarls. “The money and time and effort spent in the hopes of making Purgatory better. It takes everything I give it and it swallows it all up and spits it out in my face. I am doing my best, and I’m sorry if my best isn’t enough to impress you.”
Dean focuses on the center line so hard it starts to blur as he says, “That’s what I was going for.”
“I thought he was dead,” John says, voice angry and raised, and Dean finally looks up. No one is looking at him anymore. They’re all staring at Mary. She’s gone white in the face, one hand clutching her husband’s with a grip so tight it most be painful. “Mary, you said they were dead!”
Dean never made a mixtape for Cassie.
Then bright headlights flashing across the parking lot and right into their faces blind them. Cas and Lisa both blink, raising their hands to block the glare.
That night she wakes him up, tells him to be quiet, and carries him out of the dark house and into the darker night. Dean buries his face in her shoulder so he can’t see the woods around them, and one of her hands rubs his back. She only lets go to put him in the man’s truck. “Shhh,” she murmurs in response to his questioning look. “I’m going to take you home to your Mommy.”
“Dean —”
“Sorry,” he says after a moment, as if a panic attack is something he has to apologize for. “I’ve never been a dog person.”
The bus driver is slumped over, either unconscious or dead. Two men stand near him, their hands on sidearms — Demons or their minions. Cas can’t tell without getting closer. His eyes move over the seated crowd, counting a total of twenty-two passengers. There are two more men with guns at the back of the bus. Toward the front is a woman in a black leather jacket with dark hair. She turns to say something to a passenger, and her eyes flash yellow. Dagon.
It’s too late to stop what’s already been set in motion. The truth train has left the station, and Cas is too drunk to jump off now.
Dean wonders if she would have even gone with them if he’d had the chance to reveal the plan last minute like he wanted. Maybe she’s more loyal to Samuel than she seems. Maybe he endangered her life, all their lives, for nothing.
That’s when Dean looks to the left, just behind Cas’s back to the next row of pumps. And there she is.
be hungry. And to top it off, I know I should be excited to meet these people—” He pauses. “To meet my family. But all I can think about is my mom and Gwen and the others. I need them to be safe. I feel like I’m going out of my fucking mind with worry. I try to think about something else, and all I do is picture Gwen, trapped somewhere.” He’s not going to lose it. Not even if Cas would let him break down without judgement. “I gotta get back out there. I have to help them.”
“Where the hell has he been?” Now there’s a crack in John’s voice. He’s crying, too. “Who took him?”
Funkos on one shelf, the entire DVD set of
“Don’t leave him,” she says, and her voice is far away, down a tunnel, shouting out at him from across a void. “He needs you. It has to be you, Castiel. It’s always going to be you.”
“What did you do?” Cas asks, voice low.
“Funny how we both gave gifts that belonged to him.”
“Okay.” Cas stands, tries to think of something to say that isn’t goodbye. What he comes up with is “Dean, what do you think I should do with the money?”
“Claire was still in bed when I brought up breakfast, but Jack wasn’t in his room—”
Cas stiffens slightly. He hadn’t wanted Dean to know about those, let alone have two right in front of him.
The man’s mouth opens and closes, and he scoots back a bit on the bed, just enough for Dean to realize that he’s probably afraid of the stranger who just burst into his room. They are, after all, in a compound full of killers.
Jody is reaching for her handcuffs when Creaser says, “Wait, please, tell me. My wife...” and Jody pauses, glancing uneasily over her shoulder at Dean.
“You’re supposed to be on my side,” Dean snaps. “If Jess disappeared from your life for nine fucking months and then she called me up out of the blue to tell me where she’d been, you think I’d keep that from you?”
“Fuck,” Dean whispers once Cas has collapsed forward onto his chest. “Wow.”
“You’re too thin,” she says. “He’d be worried about you.”
Dean laughs, hitting Cas lightly on the shoulder with the back of his hand. “Doesn’t that describe you?”
And that’s how, several hours later, Bobby Singer ends up sitting at Cas’s kitchen table in the same spot where Henriksen sat for breakfast. Dean’s never seen Bobby wear anything other than his park ranger uniform or a worn-out plaid shirt and jeans, but today he’s dressed in what is apparently his best: actual goddamn slacks and a white button down with a small bleach stain on the collar. Dean stares at him over the fast food bags Cas has placed on the table.
“What are you doing here?”
“What do you think caused it?” he asks Cas, who’s staring out the window at the fields they’re passing through, eyes on the cattle slowly making their way through the muck and the mud.
He spends the next five minutes explaining to Cas what a Walkman is while he cooks the eggs. Sam comes in at the tail end of the conversation, smiles an indecipherable smile in their direction, and sits down at the table, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.
This, unfortunately for Dean, is not one of those times.
Jody and Claire walk by in the hallway, arguing again, but at least this time it sounds like they’re only fighting over preferred guns. Dean glances at his alarm clock. 9:05. Jack must be waiting in the kitchen for someone to help him make waffles. Sam’s definitely already on his grocery run. Life goes on.
The look on Sam’s face is like cold water poured over Dean’s head. He drops his fist to his lap and forces his fingers to uncurl. Sam relaxes, but only slightly.
Cas looks at the blood drying on his cheek, on the back of his hand.
The water rushes in, as it always does, and shoves him back, takes him away. He turns and spins, banging into trees and boulders, drowning as the current carries him down, down the mountain and away from the screams. He grasps for branches, fingers raw and splinter-torn, gasping for air every time his head breaks the surface.
“Yeah dude, that’s why we’re here.” They drive in silence for a few moments, before Dean, without his brain fully giving his mouth permission, says “Hey, by the way, how are you doing with the whole, uh, seeing Lisa thing?”
“Where?”
This particular torrent of tears lasts a long time, long enough for Dean’s arm to start tingling where its trapped between their bodies. He pulls away, wiping at his eyes, and Sam smiles at him. It’s shaky, but it’s something.
Dean doesn’t say anything to Sam, he just claps his brother on the shoulder and runs for the room, like the leading male role from some rom-com bullshit movie that he always makes fun of but secretly loves.
— remade him, whole and new. Cas will never be rid of the marks Seth left, even once the skin has stitched itself back together and the headaches and nightmares have faded.
Cas ignores him, glancing at his watch. Perfect time to begin. Good. He can’t afford to overthink this, to get nervous. To reflect on the past and let it fuck up the present.
Cas gestures with one hand toward the dance floor, bowing his head slightly as Zorro grins and walks out ahead of him. The string quartet, which has mostly played covers of pop songs all night, segues smoothly into Led Zeppelin’s “Kashmir” as they take their place in the center of the floor.
Between the “we’re” and the “brothers” were millions of words of affection in every language that has ever existed, and Cas kept them all contained within himself. He barely had room to hold it in. He’s much bigger than his human form appears, it’s true, but Cas’s love for Dean is incalculable.
“He was adorable,” Mary says. “Seven years old, happy, curious and lively. His mother had kept him safe from our issues, and I think he’s what we all needed to heal. Sam got to be a big brother, John got to be a real father to them both, and I got to see the people I cared about most live their lives. I think that made me want to live mine again.”
“Before. The same week.” Cas leans his head back against the couch, weary. “I told you academia is a small world, especially in pursuits like ours which often work hand in hand. Someone at the university knew Daphne, and some... gossip reached her. She knew I was spending all my time with a ‘handsome young man.’” Cas does air quotes, and Dean rolls his eyes.
Alastair dodges it, then slams Dean back with an outstretched hand. “Welcome back, Shield!” he croons. “Nice of you to join us!”
He realizes, of course, that Cas doesn’t understand the implications of a mixtape. He doesn’t know how long it takes to work out the perfect playlist — the endless hours of humming and whisper-singing lyrics and jotting down an order to the track list only to erase it. Cas doesn’t know about painstakingly pressing the recording button at just the right time and wincing when you’re off a second or two. He doesn’t know about searching the song lyrics and your damn heart for hidden meanings and trying to determine how much you’re really willing to put out there.
As is, hearing Dean ask about the other angels pulls at something deep within Cas, something he’s tried, mostly successfully, to bury after Lucifer left his body. He can feel that spark of panic stirring up, and he can’t stop the flash of memories that begin chasing each other through his mind...
Dean can’t quite help the glare he shoots at Cas for giving her his real name. Cas tilts his head and narrows his eyes into his What Was I Supposed To Do, Dean face.
“No,” he says. “Absolutely not. Are you insane?”
The woman’s eyes are black. Or maybe not. But they aren’t the right shade of blue.
he thinks with startling clarity, and then he can’t stop thinking about Cas.
“Bed?” Cas asks, raising an eyebrow, and Dean can only nod in response.
Dean should have expected that. Still, he keeps one eye on the road looking out for Cas’s big gold car, the other eye looking for the light.
Cas will take a mild reprimand any day, so long as it also comes with a boost to Dean’s self-esteem.
Cas knows he could let Dean walk out and this would be it, all they get. He should do that. Yes, he can’t protect Dean from the dangers inherent in his occupation, but he can at least try to protect him from the dangers that follow Halo. But Dean is right — he’s being hypocritical. Assuming Dean feels a tenth of the affection Cas feels for him, he’ll be worried and on edge from here on out as well, thinking about Cas roaming the streets at night as Halo.
He sees it in Creaser’s eyes — the moment he puts together what Dean isn’t saying. Dean recognizes the crazed look on his face a beat too late.
Mama walks over to the table and sets the bag down. Something inside clunks against the table, and Dean tries not to grimace when he spots the canned beets. They always eat canned everything, and he hates it. But he doesn’t want to make Papa mad by complaining, and he definitely doesn’t want to hurt Mama’s feelings. He knows she tries hard to make good meals, and he also knows they don’t have a lot of money. The kids at his new schools have made fun of his Goodwill clothes too many times for him to not know what “poor” means.
Cas places a hand on Sandy’s knee. She doesn’t look up from the knot she’s trying to untie in her shoelaces.
“So this is what we’re going to do. The two of you are going to tell me everything. No detail spared. We’re going to make sure whatever is killing those kids comes nowhere near my son, and we’re going to do it together. And if you have a problem with that —” Lisa pulls an unfamiliar business card out of her pocket (one without a room number written on it, Cas notes), “— I can always call the real FBI agents and tell them exactly how to find you.”
Dean closes his eyes, holds on to her like if he lets go she’ll vanish. His heart aches. All these years, and he imagined a hundred times walking up to his father and pulling the trigger. He wanted to protect her from this, wanted to protect all of them from this. He failed.
Dean stares out the window at Beinn Diabhal as the edges of the mountain begin to blur into the sky in the low light.
The man grabs the woman by the arm and yanks her away, down a hallway with no lights. Dean crouches on the rug and cries, trying not to picture all the monsters who could get him in this dark room. He wants his Mommy, wants to call to her, but when he opens his mouth no words come out. No sounds come at all, except for his soft weeping.
There’s lightning in the smoke. At least it looks like lightning to Cas — yellow and blue streaks of sparks that spiral out from Hellfire’s raised fist and into the tornado of Corruption, leaving the hair on his arms standing on end. His whole body screams at him in warning, urging him to run or brace for impact.
“Of course.” Mary purses her lips, nodding to herself. “I know you’re not ready now to come home with us, but once the investigation is over—”
Dean gets very into TV shows, Cas has noticed with a great deal of amusement. And now he understands why.
But Dean doesn’t stop. He closes his eyes like he can’t bear to look at Cas anymore and kisses him thoroughly as he gets a hand in Cas’s pants. Cas can’t help but thrust into the touch, misgivings forgotten. Dean keeps a firm hand rubbing against him, and it almost makes him ache to push Dean off, reversing their positions so he can get their pants off.
“Oh, fuck off.” Dean glares at him, hoping Cas can make out enough of his expression to read how dead serious he is, but not enough to see his watery eyes. “You don’t get to drop out of everyone’s lives then just pick right back up where you left off. That’s not how this works. Sam might buy it, this whole ‘let me bring you food and tell you a good story about where I’ve been’ act. Everyone else might buy it. But not me. I’m the one who almost filed a fucking missing persons report for you, Cas. I’m the one who took the call telling me I could go straight to hell.”
Dean’s first voicemail simply says,
”Some things,” he says to no one but himself, “can’t be fixed.”
Cas knows what Grace feels like — a surge of electricity jolting through your body. He remembers the Demons, their Corruption — it tasted of smoke and burned like Hell. Hellfire’s power feels oddly similar to both — there’s a sting and a burn, and Cas’s arm shudders where he took the brunt of the blow. He stares at Hellfire with new interest.
But now the plates are cleared and the leftovers bagged and Dean is tipsy and sitting sideways on Cas’s couch, they have to talk about one of those topics. Dean, like the coward he is, picks the easier one. And it’s all kinds of fucked up the easier topic is “floating death light people.”
something, stirring in his rib cage, pounding in his chest. Sadness, fondness,
“I think,” Dean says, saying the first thing that comes to mind, “he was more than a temporary case partner or something. I think he was our friend.”
, his voice rough as he said “there swallowed up and lost.” Swallowed up and lost. Dean casts his flashlight beam over the chip spreader and wonders if that’s meant to be their fate, his and Cas’s. He can’t imagine letting Cas walk into the light, but if he does go, if Dean can’t stop him, he won’t let him go alone.
“We won’t take your grace,” she continues, not mentioning his obvious suffering. “Though over time it will likely lose most of its power due to its separation from the source. I’m sorry, but even getting the others to agree to this much was... difficult.”
, which made him feel guilty. This stupid road, with its 75 mile per hour speed limit, its tight turns and steep hills. It’s a death trap.
Sam doesn’t know what to say, but he can tell by the way Cas shrinks back into the pillows that he wants Sam to leave. So he stands up, grabbing the empty glass.
It seems like it takes Dean forever to answer. Cas waits in the silence, thinking that watching beloved stars burn out of existence over millennia is a less painful prospect than waiting to hear Dean say,
Dean enjoys coaxing this Castiel out of his grief, giving him something to look forward to. He’s happy when he’s here, drinking beer with his best friend, their shoulders touching as they watch movies Michael ignores.
The massive dining room, which takes up the entire top floor of downtown’s second largest building (Shurley Tower is the tallest, of course), is decorated like the first-class dining room of some elaborate early 20th century steamship. The walls and furniture are mahogany and gold, the ceilings are covered in elaborate murals, and the dance floor in the center of the room is full of well-dressed men and women attempting to waltz. It’s a popular spot for clandestine business meetings — the staff is notoriously tight-lipped and the paparazzi aren’t on the guest list. Men with something to hide can grab a dimly lit corner booth and disappear. Cas already knows which corner is Roman’s.
“He might as well be. And you don’t know what he’ll be like, if this even works. He’ll still have the Mark. He might come back a demon. And then what? He won’t give a damn about you. He won’t care about Sam’s kids. He won’t care that Sam
Cas reenters the room, phone in hand. His face is flushed and his hair is disorderly, like he ran his hand through it multiple times. Dean tries not to stare too hard.
The screams start up before he gets his bearings, a continuous chorus of pain from an unknown direction. Cas tries to force his feet to move, but it’s as if they’re trapped in mud, rooted to the ground.
Dean thinks.
Cas doesn’t respond, haltingly pulling the copy back into his lap. Leahy whisks out the door without so much as a goodbye. He folds the paper, picture side down, and sticks it in his jacket pocket. He doesn’t know whether he’ll show it to Dean, or keep it to himself.
And that question, the question of humanity and grace, wears on Cas, who asked it of himself repeatedly in the months following Sam’s death. It’s a desperate balancing act, finding the right amount of grace to crack the Empty open only a sliver, only to pull Dean’s soul through, while leaving enough to cure Dean of the Mark once he’s on the other side. Cas doesn’t know the answer, so he doesn’t respond.
“Is — Is that
“Do you think he can follow us?” Cas asks as they walk through the living room. Cas splits off into the open kitchen to make tea, and Dean collapses on the end of the couch.
“If you tell me who
They’re back at the motel in the parking lot, and Cas has disappeared into the room to get Sam’s laptop and some of the lore books they brought along. Sam is leaning against the Impala, juggling the keys in his hand and glaring at Dean.
“Cassie,” Balthazar says, pulling his face out of his hands and glaring across the table. “Is Alastair
Cas glances at Dean, who taps his finger against his own map and then leans back on his heels, arms crossed.
“I come to ask for your help, brother,” he says softly. “I even rescued these two from the clutches of demons as a sign of goodwill from Heaven.” He glances briefly over his shoulder at Sam and Eileen. Sam reaches for his wife’s hand and tugs her closer to the porch, wanting to be near his brother if this meeting goes south.
