“should I show you some of the ways I plan to distract you?” the doctor teased and gave a sly grin when Sherlock nodded frantically. He smoothly rolled Sherlock onto his back and positioned himself overtop of him. John kissed and bit at Sherlock’s smooth neck as the detective groaned below him, “sometimes I forget how strong you are” the detective trailed off.
" it will only make him less likely to open up to you. I gotta head home. If you boys need anything call me"
“Mr. Trevor pleads not guilty to all accused charges in the case of Holmes versus Trevor. Mr. Trevor you may now take the stand.”
“you’re in a bad mood this morning.” The detective noted, but before John could get angrier, he walked to the shorter man and took him into his arms. “what’s wrong? You’ve been off since you came back from Tesco last night.”
Once again, Sherlock chest felt tight, but no longer from fear. He stepped closer toward the bed and untied his dressing gown, letting it fall and reveal his bare body. Sherlock shook his head at John’s apology and climbed on to the mattress, careful to keep his distance from the other man.
John removed his slick fingers and wiped them on their sheets, hesitating to say anything. He cleared his throat awkwardly, “um, so, how do you want to do this?” he asked, and Sherlock looked back at him in confusion “What do you mean?”. John gently rubbed Sherlock’s back, “ Do you want to lay on your stomach, or on your knees… you could lay on your back, or ride me, or…” the doctor trailed off. “oh. Um, you pick, I was only ever allowed on my knees-so I don’t know.” Sherlock spoke shyly. John felt the familiar feeling of a sad anger rise in his chest, it usually happened whenever Sherlock disclosed details of his so called romance with Victor. “right, so not on your knees. Turn over, baby, I want to be able to look at you.” John said and Sherlock followed his request. John hovered above him, kissing him slowly and gently stroking his lovers cock “you’re so beautiful, Sherlock.” John ran his hands down Sherlock’s body until he reached his long legs and helped the detective place them over his shoulders. John looked intently at Sherlock’s face, it was obvious the younger man was nervous, but it was expected. John smiled softly at him and looked at him with nothing but love held in his eyes, “ready?” he whispered and Sherlock nodded. John took himself in hand and made sure to rub a generous amount of lubricant to his cock. He began slowly grazing the tip of his thick cock over Sherlock’s hole, he repeated the action several times before stilling at his lovers entrance. He looked down at Sherlock whose eyes were closed, John intent on watching his loves facial expressions. John slowly began to apply pressure and Sherlock was gripping the sheets between his fists and was holding his breath. Before John could even breech Sherlock’s ring Sherlock gasped sharply, “stop, stop, stop, please stop.” He pleaded, the words coming out quickly. John immediately pulled back and took Sherlock’s legs off his shoulders, backing away to give him some space.
Oh hey...how y'all doin??? YOU GUYS ARE SO SWEET! I seriously can't thank you enough for being so kind to me and allowing me to have this time off. My mental state, while far from perfect, is in a much better place than it was a month ago. I wanted to surprise you all with this little smutty update that I think (and really hope) you will like! I will be replying soon to each of your individual comments as well <3 please feel free to share how you are doing (how is life or school?) or anything else you feel like sharing, i'd love to hear from you!
"Obviously " one could only expect that answer from Sherlock but he said it with a fondness that usually didn't appear in his voice. Sherlock put a little of each thing on a plate for John and put a few pieces of cut up fruit on his. John smiled and they made their usual conversation until...
They packed their suitcases so they would be ready to load into the cab, but first they went back to the hospital to check on Emily and finally retrieve Sherlock’s coat that had been sent off to be cleaned.
They assumed respective positions and just enjoyed the feeling of warmth and love that surrounded them.
Sherlock shook his head, “ no, well-yes- I do want to, but that’s not the main purpose of why I’m down here.” A small smile played on his flushed pink lips. John’s eyebrow quirked as he watched Sherlock pull a small tube of slick from his blazer. John huffed a laugh “please tell me you didn’t bring that with you to court.” He teased, earning a small chuckle from Sherlock, “of course not, that would be highly inappropriate.” He set the tube next to him on the floor and reached to remove John’s hard member through the keyhole in his briefs. He wasn’t sure when Sherlock had made the turning point to become a little minx but he certainly wasn’t going to complain about it. Sherlock confidently licked John from base to tip and then back down, never breaking eye contact. John let his head drop back against the chair as he let out a deep groan, his hand instinctively went to rest lightly on the back of Sherlock’s head.
Sherlock knew-in theory- how one ‘rode’ their partner during sexual intercourse, but when faced with the prospect himself, he felt nervous. What if he messed it up? What if he did it wrong and John hated it? With a deep breath he placed his legs on either side of John’s hips, he began to grind back against John’s hard cock in an attempt to ease it into himself. The movement ended up being awkward and Sherlock was losing his arousal as he grew flustered about his shortcomings.
When John left Sherlock let every ounce of pain, hurt, shame, and regret wash over him. Tonight 8 years ago was the night Sherlock was raped. He sat there on the sofa and cried. He was trying not to do anything to harm himself because it would upset John but eventually he didn't care. He ran to the bathroom and purged before grabbing the razor he had hidden, removed his shirt and began cutting his arms and shoulders. It wasn't enough. He had to go deeper.
“your doing wonderfully, sweetheart.” He praised as he fingered throughout Sherlock’s hair. The detective gave a sad smile accompanied by a shy ‘thank you.’
When John hadn’t heard water running for almost half an hour he grew uneasy but brushed It off. When ten more minutes passed he thought back to Sherlock’s bloody body lying in the bath and quickly moved from his seat, proceeding down the hallway with caution to not alert Sherlock that he thought something was wrong. He knocked at the door and got no answer. He called Sherlock’s name and when there was no reply he turned the knob to find it locked, fear climbed up into his throat and latched onto his voice as he called Sherlock’s name louder and began searching for the bathroom key he hid on top of the door frame. He heard the sound of splashing water and was sure his heart stopped.
Sherlock stayed silent for a moment but when ms.hudson turned away he reached out and gently took her hand and pulled her into a hug and whispered very lowly "i love you "
" hey, you okay?"John asked running his hand down Sherlocks arm. The taller man nodded but still seemed tense. John kept his hands in one place and went back to slowly kissing him, that seemed to help a little bit. " god Sherlock you are so beautiful." He said running a hand through the curls and his lover leaned into his touch. He moved back to kissing John and even wrapped his thumb in the elastic of John's boxers. He gave him a questioning look and John nodded in approval. Sherlock was feeling pretty confident at this moment and started kissing down John's body. Taking his time licking, sucking, and playing with John's nipples. John let out small grunts of pleasure and continued to praise him.   Sherlock had now come to the point where he was on his knees kissing at the inside of John's thigh and over his hips.
John switched their positions so Sherlock was on his back. He placed kissed all over Sherlock torso. Over each one of his visible ribs and protruding hip bones. " I love you so much"
"WHY THE HELL DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT WHEN MYCROFT ALREADY TOLD YOU THE WHOLE BLOODY STORY!" Sherlock said, his voice close to trembling.
“can I take you out to dinner?” John asked breaking the silence. Sherlock nodded and kissed him again removing himself from the doctor’s lap.
Lestrade was sat next to Donovan and he could feel his stomach begin to churn as he put the story together while Sherlock’s last sentence replayed in his head.
Sherlock raised one eyebrow, it was odd for John to want him to watch a movie "alright let me put on clothes"
John’s heart felt like it had shattered " my god, Sherlock I promise I would never hit you. Come here" he moved toward the scared man before and wrapped him up in his arms.
John had been the one to greet them and with neither he nor Sherlock being warned of their impending arrival you can imagine the look of surprise that washed over the doctor’s face as Mrs. Holmes pushed past him, eager to see her son. Mr. Holmes on the other hand gave John a tight smile and handshake.
When he finally composed himself, Sherlock reached to turn off the shower water; accepting defeat that no matter what he did he was going to feel gross for some time. Just as he began to turn the tap off, he spotted John’s body wash on the corner of the tub. He saturated his sponge in the gel like liquid and rubbed it over his body letting it soak into his skin as he breathed in deep. The scent of John surrounded him and for at least a few moments he was at ease.
Ms.hudson emerged from the stairs. "Boys! It is past 4 AM and I am trying to sleep, could you please save whatever was so funny until morning!"
John pulled Sherlock on top of him, caressing the side of his face and kissing him, “I know. It will be alright, I promise. Wanna give it a try?”
The DI looked Sherlock up and down quickly, “Right, okay. Thanks for dressing up for the occasion,” He said jokingly. “What did you find from the new evidence? Anything to convict Victor?”
“ I want to make sure we understand each other. You lied to a doctor to obtain antibiotic you would need if infection did occur.” He nodded once more, “ do you have proof of this visit?” Sherlock passed the officer on duty the doctors excuse for his school, dated the day after the rape. “continue.” Her voice was neutral, but he could tell by her silence he had begun the foundation of a credible case.
Greg couldn’t do it any longer, he ran quickly to the trashcan at the front of the room and expelled the contents of his stomach into it. He felt sick in every imaginable way. Sherlock and the rest of the court had come to a pause, the vomiting man drawing the courts attention away from Sherlock for a brief moment. Long enough for him to look at John…who was already looking ah him. it was a mistake, as soon as he read John’s expression he had tears welling in his eyes and cascading down his cheeks.
" could you please get it out of your head that I am going to leave you, Sherlock Holmes I am not going to leave you. I don't care if we never have sex, I'm not with you because I want to have sex, I'm with you because I love you and everything you are" as soon as those 3 words came out he wished he could take it back. It wasn't that he didn't love Sherlock because he did, but they hadn't been together long and John didn't want to rush it.
Sherlock nodded and they continued, he pulled off johns jumper and pressed himself even closer to his lover. He felt John run his tongue over his bottom lip and he quickly opened his mouth letting John in and flicking his tongue over Johns. Things were getting heated quickly but Sherlock was yet to feel uncomfortable. He could feel johns erection through his trousers and pushed his hips to him, causing John to inhale quickly and moan into sherlocks mouth. While John was slowly growing more frustrated Sherlock seemed to have no physical reaction at all.
They drove to the lab at St. Bart’s hospital and Lestrade said his goodbyes to John and Sherlock and offered to take Victor back to his home. “Actually” Victor replied “I’d like to stay here in the lab to see what shows up on those slides. I want to be as involved in this case as I can.” Lestrade didn’t think twice before granting him permission to stay, causing John and Sherlock to internally groan.
John laughed lightly, "whatever you say love" he rolled over and put an arm over sherlocks torso and pulled him closer. Sherlock let out a content sigh and smiled against Johns neck. "This is nice"
At the end of May, my 4 1/2-year relationship with my first boyfriend and first love came to a pretty heart wrenching end. I have struggled far more than I’d like to admit and far more than even those closest to me know. I’ve persisted pretty well through the breakup but there are some extenuating circumstances around it that have impacted me much more than the ending of our relationship. however, far more difficult than the breakup- I have been mentally slipping into a very dark place lately, returning to old habits I thought I had long overcome. My heart is broken, but more prominently is how I feel broken, lost, and so very unhappy. When I began this story all those years ago, it became a coping mechanism for me- an outlet that provided a distraction and relief. as you may have noticed from some of my replies to comments, this story is so much more to me than an interesting plot and a blossoming romance between two characters I adore. This story has its moments of sunshine but is overarchingly very dark and deals with heavy subject matter, but even heavier emotions that come along with it. At this moment, in the headspace I am in as of lately, writing this story feels toxic to my mental health and wellbeing. Equally as important, I want to give YOU, my readers, a story worth reading. There are only a few chapters left to this story and I want them to be amazing and fulfilling for me as a writer and for you all as my readers. I don’t want them to be half-assed filler chapters or rushed. whether you think this story sucks or if you love it, it deserves a proper ending. THAT BEING SAID: I promise I am not going on another five-year hiatus haha. I am going to give myself ONE MONTH of not worrying about updating or writing this story, reevaluate, and then hopefully finish it! It honestly breaks my heart to take a break, but I think it’s the mature and best thing for me to do. I really hope you all will still be here when I return.
Victor made no motion to move from his seat, rather his lawyer came forward, “Mr. Trevor has decided not to plead his case.”
“Only enough to get around, I’m not as fluent as I would like to be” Sherlock said opening the door for John to step into their suite.
“you can if you want, but I would advise against it. Gangs like to meet down here sometimes; we wouldn’t want to draw their attention or send them looking after her.” Billy replied.
John pulled him behind a building and reached out to place his hand on the right side of Sherlocks waist.
“as you said yourself, my parents left me alone for most of the year with the responsibility to be the sole caretaker of a young child, and a mentally unstable one at that. I tried everything I could to get her to see a doctor or therapist but i couldn’t as I wasn’t given the power of her legal guardian. It would be very easy to think the bruises came from me, but I assure you I would never hurt my little sister. When I moved away, I was relieved to find out she had sought out help and was put on risperidone, an antipsychotic medication. Her behavior improved significantly, and we became very close again. I was so worried for her during these episodes as she often didn’t remember going into them. But lately she stopped taking her medicine and as a med student has had access to prescription drugs… I have reason to believe she has been misusing them. I did go over to her home on the day of her disappearance, and when I used the restroom, I saw empty pill vials and loose pills on the counter, I googled them, and they were oxycodone. It’s true I did leave in a hurry and in anger, but it was because I was so scared for my sister. But when I left, I really did leave. I drove to see my therapist, who I’ve been seeing to help deal with my sorrows about my family life. I spent nearly every day after her disappearance working with New Scotland Yard to help bring her home. Detective Inspector Lestrade and I spent many hours looking for suspects and evidence. It’s unfortunate to be standing where we are, but I’m glad my sister is home and safe.”
“let’s shower. Then we both need to rest.” John stated as he set his boyfriend down on the bathroom counter so that he could adjust the shower tap. John began unbuttoning the buttons that remained on Sherlock’s shirt and slid it off his shoulders, kissing the skin that revealed itself as the fabric slid off. Sherlock’s skin was an array of shades of grey and purple bruises, but where his shirt covered his torso was still the same ivory color John was accustomed to. He helped Sherlock off of the counter and let him remove his trousers and pants as he undressed himself.
“Ah, Gavin, good - we need to talk. I have some very important details to share with you. This case should start moving rather quickly once we work these last few details out,” Sherlock spoke quickly as he handed Lestrade a folder.
They moved back into the living room and John helped Sherlock change his bandages. " they are looking better. Healing at least." John looked over sherlocks ivory arm that was scattered with long stripes varying in color. When John finished tying off the bandage he looked up and the side of his face was caught in Sherlock's hand as he pulled him in to kiss him. The Kiss was gentle at first but now it grew more passionate. Sherlock had moved John onto his back laying on the sofa and running his hand over Johns chest. Small moans came from the both of them at times. John pulled away with his hand gripping lightly a few buttons  on sherlocks baby blue shirt. " may I?" Sherlock nodded and placed a kiss to johns nose. The man beneath him slipped each button away and saw sherlocks pale chest exposed as he did so. When he reached the last one he ran his hand over Sherlock rib cage and he shuddered. "Is this okay?" John asked leaning up, pressing a kiss to sherlocks shoulder.  "Yes, John-I can't tell you how far I can go because I don't know."
They spent the next hour or so drinking, kissing, making small talk about their lives and families while they packed Victor’s carry-on bag. The mood of the room quickly shifted when Victor opened a drawer by his nightstand, revealing condoms, lube, and an assortment of sex toys. There were a few different sized butt plugs, a string of anal beads, handcuffs, sounding rods, and a knife. Greg was visibly shocked, and it didn’t take Victor long to notice, “Don’t worry, I was only going to pack the lube and some condoms-unless you want some of the others.” He said with an almost sinister tone and Greg shook his head. Of course, the idea of having sex with Victor had crossed his mind but it really wasn’t something he had seriously considered a possibility until now.
It was then John realized that Greg wasn't looking away because he didn't approve but because he and Sherlock were still naked from the hips up, hair tousled, lips swollen from kissing, and John raging hard. They ran to pull on their shirts and John cleared his throat, " sorry about that Greg."
He circled the building with no signs of his boyfriend, until he spotted a familiar dark head of curls through the small window of a stairwell door. He opened it, Sherlock spun around immediately but relaxed when he was met with John. His John. John that made everything better. He prayed to a god he didn’t believe in that he could somehow make this better.
“that was…different.” Sherlock spoke after several minutes, a small pit of worry forming in John’s stomach. It was almost like Sherlock could feel it, “ good different…very good.”
"I could never hate you. Please get that into your brilliant head." He gave Sherlocks hand a gentle squeeze and then let him to his room.
“Sherlock, we need to start getting ready, love.” He whispered, peppering kisses to the tall man’s shoulder.
“well, not exactly, but its related.” Emily continued the evade the topic she came to discuss, and Sherlock’s patience was growing thin.
Two chapters in one night...whaaaat??!! i really hope you all enjoy these! Please please comment down below and tell me what you think, constructive criticism is always welcome! comments really fuel me to write more chapters sooner! lots of love <3
John laughed, “ while you were down in the catacombs.” Sherlock’s head jerked up to meet John’s gaze, “ I was wondering around the city, aimlessly- trying to drown out the thoughts of what might happen to me if I were to lose you…and I decided if you made it out alive I was going to marry you.” John brought the pale fingers to his lips and kissed them. “ after you made it out, there was so much going on- it never really felt like the right moment, so I’ve held on to it for all this time. When your parents came over the other day and you were still asleep, I thought it would be a good time to ask them.”
They both stood up and Greg pulled him into a friendly hug, “it’s going to be alright. He’s Sherlock…he’s probably rescued Emily and they are on their way now.” Greg spoke trying to convince even himself.
When the environment around them stopped shaking Sherlock backed away from Emily slowly. His flashlight was still shining dimly at the front of the little crevice and they couldn’t hardly see one another. The only sound was the sharp ringing in their ears and the labored breathing shared between the two of them.
Mrs Hudson arrived within the hour and immediately showered Sherlock with unwanted light hugs, kisses to his hair and face, and an outrageous amount of "oh Sherlock, what have you done to your self" and " my poor baby"
“ you may begin” the judge granted permission and Sherlock closed his eyes briefly taking a deep breath and looked at his first statement highlighted in bold on the page in front of him.
It was nearing one in the morning and John was sat at a pub. The place was booming with young couples drinking, older men watching sports and laughing over a few pints, but John sat alone drinking tea trying to stay awake. His leg was bouncing with anticipation and worry underneath the booth table. All day he had switched from being hurt and confused to pissed off but underneath it all was worry.
“I’m going to add a third, tell me if it’s too much.” John said as he lovingly ran his other hand along Sherlock side.
I BEGAN THIS STORY 5 YEARS AGO (2015) and have recently picked it back up(2020). I would like to think my writing has grown significantly since then and would really like to encourage you to continue reading this story even if it seems subpar until chapter 16. Also, if you wish for me to go back and correct/ add more detail to previous chapters I am open to doing that. Thank you! Lots of love <3
Sherlock nodded looking down, " he was the first person aside from a few members in my family who I actually loved and who I thought actually loved me. It hurt. It still hurts. Sometimes, well times before I was with you, I even thought about going back to him, and that just maybe he would want me. But that he would want it to be different, not like before, but i passed him one day and realized that I'm completely and utterly scared of him, John I saw him and my stomach dropped, I felt sick."
He walked over to the detective and kiss his cheek once more before whispering, " Good night beautiful, see you in the morning"
John fully expected Sherlock to collapse next to him after an orgasm like that. But as usual Sherlock surprised John, pushing him backwards and licking his own cum off of John’s thighs before deepthroating John’s length, “oh my god” John exasperated as he watched Sherlock take him into his throat. It wasn’t a minute later that John was warning Sherlock he was about to finish, but just like that morning in the shower Sherlock swallowed all of John’s load without an issue.
Hi friends! I have a surprise for you... today I am uploading TWO CHAPTERS! Thank you all so much for reading this story, and especially for all of your feedback, it really motivates me to post more! Stay safe and healthy, lots of love... <3
The blogger would have liked for his detective to stay there forever but unfortunately, he had to use the bathroom. He let his hand rest on Sherlocks shoulder and he shook him slightly.
John came to lay on his side behind Sherlock in a spooning position. He poured some lube onto his fingers and began to open Sherlock up. He was still pretty slick and open from last night and moaned as John worked his fingers in and out of him.
When the emotions in the room had settled enough for them to all take a seat, Sherlock gave them a brief summary of what to expect to be discussed in court, should they come. He fought with them not to, to spare him the humiliation, but they insisted. When Mrs. Holmes grew brave enough to ask about Victor, John reached over to take Sherlock’s hand out of habit and almost jumped back when the grey haired woman let out a shrill sound. John looked at Sherlock as it dawned on the both of them that the detective’s parents were unaware of their relationship. They were both overjoyed and switched any talk of Victor to be about his and Sherlock’s relationship.  The Holmes’s had arrived only a day ahead of the court date and were staying in a hotel nearby.
Then, the next several seconds of his life seemed to unfold in slow motion. A girl wearing a long coat that resembled Sherlock’s was being lifted from a hole in the ground. John held his breath and strained his eyes to look for something that might not even happen. But then it did. Sherlock climbed out of the opening in the ground. His once pristine white shirt was covered in dirt and residue and several of the buttons were missing, his pants had tears in them, his hair was wet with rain and sweat-stuck to his face in all directions, his face had streaks of grey and black and dark red blood stains…and it was the best thing John had ever seen.
John’s cock soon went flaccid and he pulled out of Sherlock, leaving the detective feeling empty. Sherlock turned onto his opposite side to face John who took him into his arms. “how are you feeling, baby?” John asked.
John brought the covers over them and pulled Sherlock to his side, kissing his forehead and petting his head, “you were incredible.” Sherlock smiled against John’s shoulder, “so were you.”
“sweetheart,” John said, only making Sherlock cry harder, John took him back into his arms. “my love for you is not going to decrease after this hearing no matter the results, no matter what I hear or see or learn about your life before me. I’m not finding out how messed up you are, I’m finding out you are so much stronger and more amazing than I already thought you were…and you know how I am always so amazed by you.” He felt Sherlock’s body shake, but this time with a small laugh rather than tears. In a bold move John reached under his shirt and removed his dog tags, he hadn’t worn them in years but something told him to put them on this morning- perhaps because this felt like the hardest battle he would ever endure. He delicately placed them around Sherlock’s neck and tucked them under the taller mans shirt. They shared a knowing look of deep emotion, John reached up to wipe the tears from Sherlock’s face and leaned forward to kiss him. they stayed like that for as long as they could until the alarm sounded for them to return to the courtroom. Sherlock retook his place at the podium and placed a hand over the spot where the metal tags rested on his chest.
As soon as Victor left Lestrade let out a breath that he didn’t know he had been holding in. ‘god what was he doing’ he thought as he continued to scan the small living room. Finally, a glimmer of hope caught his eye in the form of a passport. He made quick work of grabbing it and was shocked to see another one under it. He quickly opened the first one, which belonged to Victor and had been last stamped in the pattern of Gatwick airport, Charles de Gaulle airport, and then Gatwick again- all within a 24-hour time period. Greg committed the information to memory before picking up the next booklet belonging to…Emily Marie Trevor. Shit-the curly haired bastard was right about everything. Emily’s passport was stamped in Gatwick the same time as her brother’s and again at Charles de Gaulle, but there was no return stamp back to the UK. Greg heard Victor begin to climb the stairs and he hurriedly put everything back just as he had found it.
By the time John made it up the stairs Sherlock had already started puffing away on a cigarette. John rolled his eyes and sat down in his chair, taking his laptop from its case and doing his usual paperwork as he kept an eye on his detective.
"John, I hope to eventually have a average relationship with you. Dates, kissing, meeting each other's families, and sex. I realize my view on the topic was tainted but you and most of the population seem to enjoy it so I really do want to try. I suppose to answer your questions: I know this isn't exactly anything sexual but maybe it's something, I would like you to help me wash before bed."
Strangely, Sherlock felt unbothered by Victor’s snide remark. It was almost as if a new wave of assurance and confidence had washed over him. “ I know. I’m fine, John.” He leaned into his lovers touch even more, “ I really am.”
As her tears began to slow Sherlock handed her one of the granola bars and sat down, propping himself against the same wall Emily was against. He kept his head down, only glancing at Emily every few minutes.
Sherlock laughed coldly sending a puff of smoke into the air above him, " you haven't wanted to kiss me at all lately."
John nearly spit the tea he had just taken a sip of, “What? Victor was over here?” his tone was filled with shock but tainted with anger as well.
John moaned and kissed him once more, applying lube to his length and sliding it along the rim of Sherlock’s entrance. “ready?” he asked, and Sherlock nodded looking deep into John’s eyes. John slowly pressed against the pucker and Sherlock took a deep breath as it breached the ring. John was steadily sliding to into Sherlock’s heat. “mmmm Sherlock” he moaned as he reached the end of his length, bottoming out in his lover. Sherlock released the breath he forgot he had been holding, “John.” He sighed. John stayed still inside him, letting his body adjust to his considerable length. “you’re incredible, baby. So gorgeous.” He complimented and watched as Sherlock bit his lip. “move a bit, please.” Sherlock whispered and John began to move his hips back until he was almost out of Sherlock before rolling them forwards once again. He couldn’t help but moan Sherlock’s name over and over again, he was so tight and felt so good wrapped around John’s cock. John knew he was probably leaking precoma inside of Sherlock. It wasn’t long until John was thrusting in and out of Sherlock at a steady pace. Sherlock was whimpering in pleasure beneath him, making the most beautiful sounds John had ever heard. John wrapped a hand around Sherlock’s long, weeping cock and began to stroke him. Sherlock gasped and scraped his fingernails down John’s back, “oh god, John, mmm, fuck” he moaned, causing John to smirk. John kissed him, letting his tongue enter Sherlock’s mouth. “ John” Sherlock panted “I think I’m going to come soon.” His legs wrapped around John’s hips a little tighter. “me too, just let go, love.” John said as he increased his speed ever so slightly, making sure to hit Sherlock’s prostate with every thrust.
"That may be the nicest thing you have ever said to me" John said smiling softly. the wind picked up and he shook briefly. " let's go home, yeah?"
Sherlock began to stir in his arms and John held him tighter and moved his hand off his thigh. Sherlock looked up at him and John pressed a closed mouth kiss to his forehead and mumbled “good morning” against his skin. Sherlock only hummed in response and cuddled in closer. They rested comfortably for a few more minutes before John asked, “how are you?”
When they arrived and got out of the cab Sherlock didn’t take John’s hand like he normally would. This pained John’s heart just a little but remembered that today was definitely not about him or his feelings. He could practically see Sherlock’s mind moving 1000 miles a minute and he knew that not one of those thoughts were about Emily. They entered the doors of NSY and walked down the hall towards Lestrade’s office. Sherlock stopped just out of view and turned to John who made quick work of moving to his lover’s side. “hey, hey, take some deep breaths. You are protected here, we will leave or take a break the second you want to get out, alright?” John tried to reassure him but Sherlock’s breathing was erratic and the taller man’s body began to sway back and forth, John knew he was about to have a panic attack and guided him towards a small cubby area with a few chairs and sat him down. “Sherlock. Sherlock, look at me.” His icy blue eyes met John’s and they took some steady breaths until Sherlock closed his eyes and was no longer trembling. “are you okay?” John asked and Sherlock nodded, “Let’s get this over with.” Sherlock stood up and John trailed very closely behind him.
As they lay there in the quiet silence Sherlock began to have many emotions running through him, a feeling he has not yet adjusted to since entering into a relationship with John. He opened his eyes and began gently rubbing his hand up and down a small part of John’s torso, “John.” He said plainly. John replied with a small “hmm” noise and Sherlock took a deep breath, “you know I am not one to frequently have outburst of sentiment, in fact I’ve spent most of my life thinking it is a chemical defect that often leads to peoples downfall, but I feel like I need to say this or it will keep nagging at me.” Sherlock had John’s full attention, “John i…I really want to thank you for um well for being so understanding these past few months, well always, but especially since we have entered into this relationship together. I know that I am cold, distant, in many ways emotionally stifled, I am flawed in so many ways and I often feel redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your friendship. I know that I am probably one of the most unpleasant and difficult people to have a romantic relationship with, but you never fail to support me. John, you amaze me every day in the ways that you love me and no matter where our relationship may lead or where it may end, I will spend every day trying to show my gratitude.”
Long time no see. Sherlock Holmes is in the catacombs- he has to have someone showing him the way. Find where he is and get them separated. I don’t care what you have to do to either of them. $25,000 if you succeed. – Victor T.
Happy update day! I hope you all are doing well! I want to say thank you so much for reading my story, i truly can't believe we have hit over 12,000 readers! It means so much to me and i hope you continue to like this story as it begins to finish up! Stay healthy and safe, lots of love...
Sherlock shook his head " no, I wanted to so bad but I came home." He started pressing small kisses to John's neck.
John moved up stairs and started packing things, Sherlock just continued to stand in the kitchen with a blank look on his face. Wondering what the hell he had done. And if John was really going to leave.
“I know,” he said defensively “I’m doing it for me. Because even if it brings me no peace at least I know he won’t be out preying on other people, causing them damage, abusing them the way he did me and Emily. Don’t you understand, John? He is just like all the other criminals we chase after and put in jail- he’s a threat to society.” Sherlock had sat up and positioned himself to face his partner.
“Victor Trevor raped and submitted me to acts of sexual torture throughout the majority of our relationship.” The room had already been quiet, but now it held an eerie silence. It was as if everyone had stopped breathing, only the lights hummed above him. His mouth felt unbearably dry, but he knew no amount of water would fix this feeling. “ the first time It happened I was sixteen. I was a virgin, had gone no further than kissing and the only person I have ever kissed was him. Not that any of this should matter but I’ve been informed it’s the kind of information that is often valued.” He paused and met the judges attentive stare, a silent beckon for him to continue. “ Victor called me one evening, his parents and Emily were gone. We were the only people in the house, everything seemed normal; we called in delivery and watched a movie. When it was finished…” his voice had begun to waver but he corrected it quickly, “ he said he heard a rumor about me. A rumor that I had been on a date with another boy from our class, I hadn’t of course. I denied it after every slap that landed on my face. He told me if I was going to act like a whore, I should be treated like one. I didn’t understand what was about to happen until I was pinned on the couch and he was removing my trousers and pants.” He thought he heard John swallow. He could see Emily staring at him with eyes that expressed sympathy, but more than anything they showed support. He didn’t want to look at his parents or John right now. “ He thrust into my body, unprepared, hard and fast. I screamed and begged and apologized in every language I knew. But he didn’t stop. It wasn’t finished until he was and he left me there on the floor of his living room, so he could shower and wash the blood off his penis.”
Ms Hudson smiled fondly, " sit down, it won't take long but my hip is killing me" they took a seat on a bench and waited for a cab to pass " I met Sherlock for the first time when he was in uni, when he was still with Victor. He showed up on my doorstep one night, scared, with cuts and bruises all over him. I had no idea who he was or why he was here but he was kind enough to make me trust him, he eventually opened up to me. I was the first person to know about the abuse and all he went through, I knew about the eating disorder, the cutting all of it. I told him he could live in 221b and I would help pay rent until he got a steady job, he claimed money wasn't the problem but I still wanted to help more. I suppose he just became fond of me because I didn't judge him, or treat him like he was broken. Sherlock is strong john, stronger than he lets on."
Sherlock’s heart still fluttered at the use of the pet name during a moment like this. He held his breath as his orgasm built and felt John coming inside of him as the quick thrusts continued and his own wasn’t far behind. As he came he let out a breath and pressed his chest to John’s, burying his head in the nape of John’s neck, muffling the cries of his extasy against the doctors shoulder.
“Hey love.” John said as he hung up his coat and went into the kitchen to make some tea “find something interesting?” John asked curiously.
“please proceed with your statement. Only the parts relevant to Ms. Trevor’s case.” She said harshly, her brown eyes staring daggers into Sherlock’s blue ones.
“John, I was looking at som- “Sherlock was cut short when John pulled him close and leaned up to kiss him tangling his fingers in Sherlock’s dark hair. John tossed his lovers phone onto one of the nearby chairs and walked Sherlock back to the bed before climbing on top him. One of his knees came to rest between Sherlock’s thighs and the detective couldn’t help but lean into the touch, moaning softly. They made out slowly, enjoying the moments they had to take in being with one another. When John’s hands began to not so subtly tug at the buttons on Sherlock’s white shirt the taller man reluctantly broke the kiss, “we do have things to get done today...” he trailed off and John sighed, rolling off of the detective. “later though.” Sherlock said with a wink and a final kiss to John’s lips.
John could tell Sherlock was thinking, but that he was also struggling to keep his eyes open; exhausted from the day. “come on, love. Let’s go to bed.” Sherlock made no attempt to move and John picked him up with a small laugh and carried him to his bedroom down the hall, placing him on the bed with a kiss. John went to Sherlock’s deep-toned mahogany dresser and opened the drawer he had filled with some of his things. He took off his clothes, tossing them to the corner of the room to be washed and put on a pair of boxers to sleep in. Sherlock was lying flat on his back, the same way John had left him. He crawled over his dark-haired lover, making sure to give him enough space to not feel trapped. John leaned in and kissed Sherlock deeply, slowly, and most important-lovingly. John had never felt a love like this. He doubted that anyone had felt a love as deeply as the one shared between he and Sherlock. His hands moved to undo the small bow that tied together Sherlock’s gown and he slid it off his shoulders. “gonna change your bandage and then we should sleep.” John stated. He cut away the dressing and observed the progress, one of the deeper cuts looked worse than it did yesterday, as if it had been broken back open.
“No, sorry it’s just not very…posh,” Lestrade chastised, earning an eyeroll from the consulting detective. John huffed a small laugh from across the room. “So how do I make him tell me where he’s traveled to lately without asking him?”
I hope you all like this chapter! The chapter after this one is going to be very very exciting for John and Sherlock!! Stay safe and healthy, lots of love <3
Sherlock knew the second John had worked it out, he gasped, and his eyes widened. John spoke in shock, barely above a whisper…
"Suicide watch, it's the only way mycroft could work out for them not to send me to a rehab center. So he Has to sign me out, and we also have will be having a fucking therapist visit us twice a week to 'help' me"  by this time Sherlock was quickly growing angry.  John took his hand and gave it a gentle squeeze.
John ran to the bathroom and saw his lover laying on the floor, blood everywhere but not sure where the source of it was. He crouched down and sat Sherlock up against the wall, his curled matted with blood.
“Doctor Watson, I again want to apologize for my reaction. It was irrational and wrong.” Mycroft started, “how is he?”
“yes…yes…John, the answer was always yes.” He let a few tears slip, but this time they were ones of undeniable joy. John held him tightly, the way he always had held every part of him. when Sherlock finally unburied his head from the nape of John’s neck they spent the next several moment in a passion filled kiss. “ how…when did you buy this ring?” Sherlock asked, finally observing the beautiful piece of jewelry.

Emily just shrugged, repeating it was alright and left with a friendly wave as if nothing had happened.
“Christ, no, it wasn’t me. An ex-boyfriend of Sherlock’s.” He said and heard his PA breathe a sigh of relief.
There had been no alarm set, given the sleep schedule was already messed up. When Sherlock opened his eyes, the clock was flashing two in the afternoon. John was still asleep, and the detective watched him fondly for a few moments. A wicked grin came across his face as he began to sink slowly under the duvet. John’s long thick cock was resting against his tanned thigh and Sherlock bit his lip as his mouth watered at the sight. He let his head come to rest on John’s hip and licked his lips until they were glistening with anticipation. He cupped his hand at the base of John’s penis and took the dark pink tip into his mouth. He sucked and licked slowly and with caution at first, but as the deep pit of arousal formed low in his belly, he began to bob his head up and down with enthusiasm. John began to stir awake, initially thinking he was having an incredibly realistic dream-but this was real. John moaned in his deep morning voice, “mmm Sherlock. What are you doing...” he trailed off and he moved the covers to the side to watch his boyfriend. Sherlock pulled off of his cock with a small popping sound, “I promised you a ‘later’ a few days didn’t I?” he asked and John nodded remembering when they first arrived at the room “ I always make good on my promises.” He said taking John’s cock back into his mouth. He gently tugged and rolled John’s balls in his hands as he felt John’s growing cock hit the back of his throat. He turned his attention to licking just under John’s glands, eliciting an incredibly erotic response from the shorter man “oh fuck…Sherlock, don’t stop please.” The detective smirked, he had no intentions of stopping anytime soon.
“mmm, he already knew it though. Saw the marks on your neck while he was over here.” John continued and felt Sherlock tighten his posture in his embrace. “John I-“Sherlock began but John wasn’t finished. “and what was really interesting was that he knew you had one below your shirt collar.” John was growing frustrated “Sherlock, you have to be really close to see that one. Why was he that close to you? Why are the sheets off our bed?” John’s final sentence sounded like a plea for mercy and his voice cracked at the very end.
Lestrade stood, his mouth slightly agape, “Did you just say fucked?” he said in surprise, never hearing Sherlock say something as crude in the context of a case.
He handed Sherlock a box of Thai noodles and sat beside him on the couch. Sherlock had put in secretly one of Johns favorites "the best of me".
" I saw the news...I wanted to make sure you were okay." He said in a sympathetic voice that only annoyed the detective.
John’s breathing pattern changed just past the two-hour mark. Sherlock slowly slid out of bed and quietly put his clothes from the previous day back on. He put the drawstring bag John had packed on and then put on his trench coat. He took his phone off charger, grabbed his flashlight and put several backup batteries in one of his coat pockets. As he walked towards the door, he fought himself not to look back at John’s sleeping figure, for fear that if he did, he wouldn’t be able to make himself leave. With one last deep breath he quietly left the hotel room and met the awaiting taxi to take him to a secret meeting spot in the 8th arrondissement.
Bradshaw nodded, taken back by the shift in the detective’s tone. He made a few notes on the form, “were these actions recent?”
Sherlock swallowed hard. While most people knew he had a problem with cocain, few knew he had also been addicted to heroine. Heroine was the best relationship he had ever had up until John. It was always there when he needed it, always knew how to comfort him, never hurt him, and never left him alone. Just talking about it made his skin burn with desire. He closed his eyes and took a moments to think before he answered. He had been clean for so long and was doing so well with at least that and John would be so upset if he started using again, even just once. But God how he craved to feel that needle in his skin and feel his mind start to relax.
Sherlock looked to his left arm and John picked it up, wrapping cloth around it. While he held pressure he used a warm rag to try and clean him up.
“you were incredible this morning. Really you were. You were so confident and sure of yourself, and god when you swallowed my- well you get the point. Anyway, you seemed okay with everything, but I couldn’t help but notice…” John was nervous to even bring this up but felt desperate for answers “ younevergothard” he said quickly but of course Sherlock caught it and quirked an eyebrow but let John finish his thought “ and whenever I brought you in here and tried to touch you…well… you started shutting down. Can we talk about that so I can understand?” Sherlock nodded his head and turned to lay on his side to be face to face with John.
“he is, we already discussed it.” she laughed, making Sherlock roll his eyes at the trap he just walked into, “ Harry is even going to join us, that will be lovely wont it?”
"Where's Lestrade, he called me here since you and Anderson can't do anything correctly beside cheat on each other.
Sherlock looked at his next list, numerous bullet points all under the bolded title of Sexual Assault. He picked up his notecards that he was prepared to read off of, verbatim, just like his attorney suggested- but those cards were a watered down, if not sugar coated, version of the things that he had endured. He looked over at Victor who gave him a sly smile. Sherlock eyes thinned as he watched his ex. Why was he going to grant Victor mercy, he was certainly never given any. He placed the cards back down and heard John’s breath hitch, he could practically feel his eyes burning a hole in the back of his blazer.
The judge glared at her and smacked her mallet on the table, “sit down Ms. Trevor and don’t interrupt again, you had your time to speak.” She said coldly before motioning for Victor to continue.
" John, I want to please you. I want to be able to give you everything your previous lovers have given you and so much more. One thing that they have given to you is sex, while I really struggle with the concept, I would love nothing more than to continue trying to become intimate with you."
" go back to work, John." Sherlock said icily, picking up his coat and walking upstairs to his own flat.
The doctors heart sunk, but he tried to keep the smile on his face." Alright. Erm, sorry I'll be in the living room."
“so, you’re not exactly…” Greg racked his brain searching for the correct word. “Vanilla?” Victor supplied and the DI nodded. “no, never have been. I don’t mind traditional sex but it’s not what excites me the most. I like things rough, more so than most people. Are you scared?” he asked, almost daring Lestrade to say yes. “No.” Greg replied coolly, “It doesn’t bother me at all. People like what they like, I don’t think it should have to be explained.” Victor nodded with a smile, “Are your curious about what all I have?” he asked. “I suppose so, but I’m not going to ask you to show them to me if you don’t want.” Greg reasoned. He genuinely was curious of what all sexual aids Victor had and what it may reveal about him, but he really hoped they were never used on him. “no, I don’t mind. Here..” Victor pulled open two more drawers revealing various items “feel free to look through them, pick them up, try them out if you like” he said with a wink that made Lestrade blush “I’m going to finish packing but feel free to ask me any questions you want. I’m not exactly shy about it.” He laughed.
Sherlock called Lestrade and requested that he not tell Victor about where he was going or that this upcoming conversation ever happened. At first the detective inspector questioned him but eventually agreed.
Hi friends, I hope you enjoy this chapter! Please leave any feedback you have! Stay safe and healthy, lot of love <3
" I'm going to sleep alone tonight; I need some time to myself. Goodnight." John said as he turned to leave. The detective heard the footsteps fade as John ascended the stairs and recognized the familiar sound of John getting into his bed. Sherlock hadn’t slept alone in months, and he hadn't slept in his bedroom since the incident with victor climbing through his window.
“so many times, and in so many ways.” Sherlock was about to continue when he heard the sounds of sirens. Emily was still clinging to his arm, he reached to grab her hand and they began moving quicker, following the sounds. They ended in a large open room, one with the walls were made of bones and skulls. They were both breathing hard and tired.
Thank you so much for reading! Please comment and let me know how you like the story so far and any suggestions you have!!
Sherlock glanced up at John wondering if it was okay to tell him but thankfully John answered for him, "yes we are."
“I don’t know what the hell you are talking about, Mycroft, but this is out of line even for you!” John wasn’t yelling but was incredibly assertive as he hovered over the older Holmes brother. “You better start explaining.” John hissed. “The bruises” Mycroft stammered for the first time that John had ever heard. John looked at Sherlock confused but his eyes soon lit up with the realization of what Mycroft was referring to. “For Christ’s sake Mycroft-“Sherlock began at the same time John said “those aren’t bruised they're love bites, HICKIES!” John emphasized to him. Mycroft’s face flushed red, of course how could be so stupid. Ah of course, sentiment. Sentiment for his little brother created false deductions. In Mycroft’s defense he had a long-standing assumption that after Victor, Sherlock would never let John or anyone else close enough to him to have this situation occur- but as always, the capabilities of his little brother surprised him. Sherlock had been rambling on to John about how ‘hickies’ are indeed bruises, but John wasn’t paying him too much attention, figuring that was a conversation for a different time. For now John was in shock by practically having thrown the British government to the floor.
He and Sherlock shared a grin before taking up their previous positions on the couch, " well, Sherlock, I doubt I will be able to go back to sleep here, and I really should, seeing as I have work in the morning. Would you come back to bed or would that be excruciatingly boring?"
“I have you saying in your statement you were subjected to ‘acts of depravity and sexual torture’ can you elaborate?” her eyes scanned over the papers that laid before her. Some including pictures of Sherlock from his days in the university orchestra where there are visible bruises.
"God no, I would never do that." John said quietly and reached across the table to take Sherlocks hand.
Emily was quiet for a minute before she sighed, “I was going to talk to the police.” She trailed off and it took a strong willpower for Sherlock not to stop dead in his tracks. “talk to the police about what?” he asked cautiously.
He sluggishly moved out of bed and past the bathroom, hearing the shower running. When he came the kitchen he debated making tea for him and John or not. He decided not, simply because he felt like being lazy today.
When Sherlock took John back into his mouth, he focused his efforts on swallowing him down completely. The last time he deepthroated him was several days ago in the shower. He took John’s cock into his mouth until it hit the back of his throat. He repeated this several times until it made him gag. At first he blushed, feeling self-conscious of the sound that he had made; but one quick look to John told him he wasn’t bothered in the slightest. In fact- he was even more turned on. The flushed tip was beading with precum and Sherlock lapped at it as if it was the best thing he would ever taste.
When Sherlock arrived back at baker street he fell against the door as soon as it closed behind him. His chest heaved but he didn’t cry. Ms. Hudson opened her door and placed a hand over her heart as she worried over the detective. She approached him with caution and helped him to his feet, leading him into her flat and sitting him on the couch. All of this was very reminiscent of the very first night Sherlock had shown up on her doorstep all those years ago. The detective worked through his panic attack as his landlady watched from a distance. When he was coming to, she offered him tea and continued her baking as she kept a close eye on him. The lanky man sat in silence just staring at the floor, obviously lost in thought as he sipped on his tea. Eventually he fell asleep and quiet snores floated through her flat. She smiled sadly in his direction; a smile of pity-one she couldn’t ever let him see.
I BEGAN THIS STORY 5 YEARS AGO (2015) and have recently picked it back up(2020). I would like to think my writing has grown significantly since then and would really like to encourage you to continue reading this story even if it seems subpar until chapter 16. Also, if you wish for me to go back and correct/ add more detail to previous chapters I am open to doing that. Thank you! Lots of love <3
"I'm sorry; I shouldn't have said what I did." John said still stroking his lovers hair, " and your right, every time something new happens with victor I treat you differently again. I'm going to try my best to stop that, okay?"
When morning came there was a text from Lestrade waiting on Sherlocks phone. Apparently there had been a reported disappearance, and since the workers in the Yard can't seem to do their job, he was needed.
Two chapters in one night...whaaaat??!! i really hope you all enjoy these! Please please comment down below and tell me what you think, constructive criticism is always welcome! comments really fuel me to write more chapters sooner! lots of love <3
Lestrade turned his head quickly looking up at Sherlock, silently begging for an explanation. “you trust me, don’t you?” Sherlock asked and the DI nodded, “you’re insane, and a complete git sometimes but yeah do; I mean I let you on crime scenes all the time and rare-“ Sherlock turned to the slightly shorter man, “No. I don’t mean about work. I mean as a person, as your…friend.” The consulting detective spoke delicately, slightly uncomfortable by the conversation he had started. Lestrade sighed, “yeah, I do.”
A few weeks passed when John got a random text from Mycroft that simply read "danger night" there had only been one other time that John and Mycroft had spoken of Sherlocks so called ' danger nights' Mycroft originally told him that they were times he would have a stronger feeling than usual to use drugs, but John new they now referred to more than the drugs, it applied to the irregular eating and the self harm methods as well.
“if he plead not guilty, he knew I would have to testify. Probability and tradition says the ‘victim’ always tells their story first period he just wanted to watch me relive those memories, to hash the most private details of my life out to a room filled with people.”
Please comment with any ideas suggestions and feedback! i hope you all enjoy this chapter! lots of love <3
John sighed and got up, putting his clothes’ back on. “So, we’re just not going to talk about it?” he asked, a hint of frustration evident in his voice. Sherlock laid on his back and pulled the covers over his body in shame. He took a deep breath, “you did everything right John. You shouldn’t blame yourself for anything, I certainly don’t.” Sherlock was in pain, deep heart wrenching pain but he knew he couldn’t fix it all in this moment.
Sherlock straightened his posture and began to reclaim his time, “ As I was saying, the two wires as the base of the plug were electric conductors that connected to a remote, obviously controlled by the abuser, Victor Trevor. He would retrain me, insert the plug, and spontaneously electrocute me whenever and whatever voltage he saw fit. Often times I would pass out from the pain. I sometimes pleaded with the universe to kill me.” Sherlock’s regained confidence seemed to wear off far too fast and he was desperate for another hit of his new drug, John Watson, who had just proved he could make anything better. “ Victor would have company over, select company, and…” deep breath “ it was a frequent occasion for the remote to be passed around the room. used at the holders discretion.”
Greg rolled his eyes and began to protest but Sherlock was quick to cut him off, “Tell me what you found,” He demanded calmly.
The doctor smiled again, " cuddling position, where your both laying on your side and pressed to one another, the one on the outside is the considered the big spoon, the person on the inside, the little. So big or little?"
Sherlock immediately began working when he got to the lab, keeping a data sheet of everything he was discovering on the samples. It was hard to focus with Victor to his right, staring directly at him and John to his left staring directly at Victor who was lucky that looks couldn’t kill. Molly entered the lab, thankfully breaking off the unspoken staring contest that was happening. “John, I’ve got a body downstairs that I’m working on and was wondering if you could please give me a second opinion.” Molly asked as sweetly as she did everything. “Ah, yeah I can on our way out, we shouldn’t be too long.” He said, trying to avoid leaving Sherlock’s side. “oh, um, well actually I need to finish this up pretty quickly, I’m a bit behind today on clients. Could you come now, it won’t take long.” Molly pleaded and John hesitated, “go.” Sherlock said firmly. John gave him a sharp glance and looked at Victor who seemed to not have taken his concentration off of Sherlock. John got up from the lab stool and walked slowly towards Molly, he turned back towards the two men at the counter, “Victor, how would you like to see a morgue?” John said with attempted enthusiasm, hoping Victor would be intrigued enough to follow him and Molly. Victor turned to look in his direction, “Oh no thanks, if I’m looking at a body I like for it to be at least partially alive.” He spoke in a near sinister tone that sent chills up John’s back and made Sherlock stop for a moment before Victor tried to laugh and play it off. “right.” John said and turned to walk away with Molly.
“Out, he will be back soon.” Sherlock said, hopeful that the prospect of John’s return would prevent Victor from trying anything he did yesterday in the lab.
Sorry it's a bit late but here it is! I really hope you all enjoy it, i'm still really new to writing smut haha
After what Sherlock had told him about his time with Victor he didn’t think he would ever be able to bring himself to take Sherlock on his hands and knees- for his sake, not Sherlock’s- but maybe Sherlock laying on his front would be a suitable alternative. John leaned down close to Sherlock’s ear, tracing the shell of it with the vey tip of his tongue, “ roll over.” And Sherlock did without fuss. The detective relieved to have some kind of consistent pressure on his cock. John smirked out of Sherlock’s view as he watched the younger man roll his hips against the mattress. John finally pulled his trousers and pants down completely and parted Sherlock’s perfect ass, plunging in hard and fast- unknowingly giving Sherlock not only what he wanted, but what he needed. He heard Sherlock moan his name loudly and still beg for more, “ harder, John please, mmm more…”
When John woke the second time it was indeed closer to time to work, he still had 20 minutes before having to get dressed and decided to continue laying with his sleeping boyfriend. He watched him, he looked so peaceful, so beautiful and elegant, In a simple word he looked perfect. In Johns eyes, he was. Sure nothing about his lovers life had been perfect in any sense, but things were perfect to him.
When quarantine started for my state, back in march, I re-watched all the Sherlock episodes for the first time in a long time and one night decided to read my old fan-fiction- Starving to Please. I saw the potential that 14-year-old me had created and being nearly 5 years clean, felt removed enough from the situation to continue writing. I felt rejuvenated and inspired to pick this story back up, it gave me a creative outlet and a meaningful way to spend my time while not able to go in public.
“John,” Sherlock was the first to break the kiss “if we continue like this nothing will ever get done.”
Mark was sworn in promptly and gave a statement with backing paperwork that he had prescribed Emily an antipsychotic and had been meeting with both her and Victor for several years. He left Sherlock out of the situation for now. He claimed that Emily never explicitly told him why she wanted to see a therapist only the struggles she was having, and he treated her to the best of his ability. He also had paperwork confirming that Victor had been to see him shortly after Emily’s disappearance, asserting truth towards Victor’s’ side of the story.
They were almost finished with their meal. John had eaten all of his an Sherlock only had a few bites left of his.
Sherlock shook his head and placed the violin back in its casing. John leaned onto sherlocks shoulder and sighed. "Your arm not itching as much?"
Sherlock was quiet for a moment, "I won't let you die, so we have to cross the sitting at grave part out."
He started to shake his head and insist he was fine, but Emily was also breaking apart the cereal bar, “and eat.” She added on.
"Brilliant John, the middle child. Adopted from the local orphanage 15 months ago. Biological parents decided they wanted him back, tried asking nicely but was denied, so what happens when people don't get their way? They get angry. The both of them broke into this house knowing how the parents would react, so they planned it. While the wife shot down the father, the husband attempted to shoot the mother and 2 kids, what he didn't know is that his son was in between the 2 kids and when he shot the girl, he also shot his son. After realizing that, he freaked out and yelled to the living room to tell his wife. Now, the wife didn't intend to kill the father, she wanted to distract him long enough for her husband to grab the kid and sneak out through the emergency stairs, BUT when the husband told his wife of the mistake she shot the father, thinking since there was no witnesses they couldn't be caught. God people are so dull." Sherlock said tilting his head back.
"What I tell you stays between us, and us only. Sherlock shouldn't know for his benefit. It would hurt him to know I told you this." Mycroft’s tone became very serious.
Victor nodded, “yeah, well he did actually. You stopped replying back to him shortly after he called. He said you do that a lot, just set your phone down and forget about it when he’s still on the call.”
Sherlock’s eyes were dilated, unknown if it was from the slow darkening of the room or complete infatuation for his lover. He watched with focus as John reached down to unzip his jeans and pull himself from his flies. He hoisted Sherlock’s legs over his shoulders, leaning very ungracefully to grab the lube from the nightstand table and beginning to open his boyfriend with his fingers, a little rougher than usual. Sherlock felt John’s fingers scissoring within him, occasionally touching over his prostate, making his whole body tense.
John was already putting on his coat. " what's wrong? Sherlock! Listen I need you to stay on the phone."
John took fresh gauze and ointment to apply to sherlocks arm. His eyes turned glassy when looking at them and Sherlock had to turn his head to keep from showing how ashamed he was.
Moments passed and eventually Sherlock began to stir. He lazily rolled over and faced John, slowly opening his eyes before blinking a few times.
“ we are not going to discuss your other claims at this time, but you have made very bold and serious accusations against Mr. Trevor, does revenge play any role in your participation in this case?”
“there is no time for that Sherlock, you of all people should know how important time is in the case of missing persons.”
I BEGAN THIS STORY 5 YEARS AGO (2015) and have recently picked it back up(2020). I would like to think my writing has grown significantly since then and would really like to encourage you to continue reading this story even if it seems subpar until chapter 16.

“her brother? The bloke sitting in our jail right now?” Bradshaw questioned Sherlock nodded, he eyes still looking towards the floor. “Sherlock, you do realize you can’t file on behalf of another person. If Emily-”
"Not if you're going to want me to reply okay In return, like that book about a mistake in the stars and everyone in it is dying"
"Sherlock?" He repeated until the detective looked up and he patten the spot next to him, a silent command of 'please come sit with me'
John placed his hand on the side of Sherlock face and gently guided it upwards so that he could kiss him with ease. He kept one hand in his hair and the other holding Sherlock’s body close to his own. John moves his lips in sync with his lovers, enjoying the connection between them. John’s hand wondered down the detectives back until his grip was filled with Sherlock plush arse. The taller man let out a pleasured groan and John smiled into the kiss, “tell me what you need.”
His lips quirked up in a smile, “my colleague, best friend…my boyfriend.” As soon as he completed that statement Emily was clinging to his arm making a “aww” noise. Sherlock’s smile could only grow wider as he looked down at her.
Thank you all so much for reading these past few chapters, it means a lot! feel free to leave comments of thoughts, ideas, things you want to see next, etc! lots of love <3
He opened the door knowing everything was okay but in the back of his mind he had a fear something could be wrong. " you alright?"
Sherlock managed to get a cabs attention and quickly got in, leaving both John and Sally behind him.
The night went with ought a hitch. John slept pressed against sherlocks side on the small bed. Waking up next to Sherlock is something John could relive for the rest of his life and never grow tired of it. He admired the feint scent of sherlocks Cologne and a smell that could only be described as simply....Sherlock. He knew he couldn't go back to sleep so he gently moved sherlocks arm from around him and got dressed to head down to the cafeteria. He got 2 cups of coffee and took the lift back upstairs.  Sherlock was awake and having his vitals tested by none other than Amy.
John inhaled sharply, “Right, okay. Well, forgive me for being so concerned.” The response was cold and as soon as it left John’s lips, he regretted it. “no. nope. Sherlock, I’m sorry. I’m just worried about you-for you- and Victor said something to me when you went to the audio room with Lestrade that has replayed in my mind all day. I guess the stress of the situation has been getting to me too, but you should be the last person I take it out on.”
Hi friends! I hope you all are doing well and that you really enjoy this chapter! Sorry for the longer break between chapters, its been a pretty hectic few days with finals coming up. Please feel free to leave feedback, it really fuels me to write more! Stay safe and healthy, lots of love <3
Sherlock scoffed, “ as usual I got myself involved in something before I knew all the details…by the time I did, it was too late.”
When he finished drying and dressing him he laid down next to him and ran his fingers through Sherlocks hair.
Sherlock went into his bathroom and pulled put a small velvet box that held four box cutter blades. He selected the newest one and held it to his wrist and moved it across until the blood came to the surface, he repeated the same action several times on his thighs, stomach, and upper arm. After the blood was cleaned up he took a shower and climbed into bed.
“Victor? Her brother? Sherlock come on. That’s far-fetched even for you. He’s been more than cooperative this entire time. He would not kidnap his own sister and then file the report for it.” Greg complained. The room was silent for a moment before Greg asked, “would he?”
(TRIGGER WARNING OVER) When I began this story, I took so much of my own pain and projected it onto my character of Sherlock. I wrote John as who I needed someone to be for me. My own portrayal of John became my ‘comfort character’ just as much as Sherlock was my outlet. I made him into someone to share aspects of my pain. Writing this story was such a cathartic feeling for me…until it wasn’t. I met someone who slowly patched all the wounds the world and myself had inflicted upon me and one day I realized that this story was triggering me more than helping me, so I quit it- and I don’t regret that. I fully intended to finish it but I didn’t know that it would be five years later in the middle of a pandemic that I would do so.
"And i love you"  Sherlock was getting tense as John moved down and it was noticeable. He removed himself from Sherlocks torso and moved back up to kiss him.
John extended an outstretched hand to Mycroft offering to help him off the floor, a gesture Mycroft quickly accepted. “Mycroft, I’m sorry I push- “ John started. Mycroft held up a hand to stop him and interjected “No, Dr. Watson, I am the one who is sorry. I should have known better that you wouldn’t have caused any harm to my brother. I am deeply ashamed of how I reacted.” Sherlock made a snide comment about ‘over-reacting’ and John nodded his head in understanding “it’s alright, you were worried.” Mycroft neither confirmed or denied John’s statement but rather brushed off his clothes and spoke to Sherlock, “I won’t force you off this case for the time being…but if it gets to be too much, and I know if it does, I will have you removed Emily Trevor be damned.” And with that Mycroft made his way down the stairs back to the street. John and Sherlock shared a knowing look of ‘wtf’. Just as John was about to ask Sherlock a question his phone buzzed.
“ he would retrain my limbs in an imaginative number of ways: handcuffs, rope, belts, duct tape, scarves, zip ties- it didn’t matter, I was always restrained for these ‘sessions’ and if I resisted I would always get knocked out, either by physical blows or sedatives he would obtain from his friends. I was always restrained when I woke up. There were traditional acts of whipping, flogging” Sherlock hesitated with a shudder as he recalled the next one “caning. He would take box cutters and cut me, often threatening to cut my jugular if I didn’t comply with whatever rules he set that day, and I believe that he would have.”
It was a crisp, fall day in London and John was clad in dark jeans and an oatmeal colored jumper, looking warm and like a safe space for Sherlock to retreat. They didn’t talk in the cab on the way to New Scotland Yard, but John held Sherlock’s hand in his and gave it a loving squeeze from time to time.
Hi my lovely readers! i want thank you all so much for the comments and reads in the past week, i hope you are enjoying this story as it wraps up! Here is part one of the trial, i hope it keeps your interest and doesn't feel repetitive. DISCLAIMER: i'm not a lawyer, ive never been to law school, and i don't watch many crime shows so i had to take an educated guess at how a court scene would play out, so please be gentle with me haha. Stay healthy, lots of love...xx
John pinched the bridge of his nose at Sherlock’s moody tone and quickly found himself standing over the detective, " what the hell are you on about, Sherlock? I'm going to try really hard to ignore the fact you just implied I’m a slag."
Emily shook her head and swallowed a bite of her sandwich, “ no, im alright. Go enjoy yourselves! And thank you for stopping by to check on me. Oh and thank Mycroft for me for the private room. I know this couldn’t have been easy to arrange…or cheap.”
“DAMNIT” John yelled, smashing his fist on the table. Where was he supposed to go? What was he supposed to do? He took a few deep breaths as he quickly put on some clothes. He knew better than to go find an entrance to the catacombs and start looking. He almost began to call Lestrade but stopped, remembering he was probably with Victor. He cringed at the realization that his last two choices were to call Mycroft and face his wrath or wait and hope Sherlock was okay. He dialed Mycroft.
“No,” Sherlock cut the DI off, “you can’t just ask him, he will know we’re on to him. You have to make him bring it up. Make him talk about it, you can allude to his travels but only touch the surface. We are fucked if he knows that we know that he took her.”
"John, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said what I did. It was wrong and way out of line. I didn't mean it. I-I was angry because, John it really hurts to remember everything and-" A single tear had fallen from sherlocks eye and John moved to wipe it away and Sherlock all but screamed and shied away
"Love?" When he didn't get a response he jus kept speaking. " we still have to go help Greg, at 11, after you get out why don't we try and go back to sleep for an hour or so?"
"Tomorrow, if he stops messing with his IV and would corporate" she said scowling " If not we are stuck with him for anther day"
John let Sherlock rest on him, running his hands softly through those dark curls. Sherlock hummed in contentment, he loved when John did this. He felt a sense of guilt for not telling John what really happened when he had left the lab, especially as the comment Victor made about pulling his hair ran through his mind. Sherlock momentarily wanted John to stop, an irrational voice in his head making him fearful that John may decide to jerk on his curls the way Victor once did, but this was John-his John. The one who only inflicted feelings of warmth, comfort, and security onto him.
John assumed Mycroft was wrong about tonight being a danger night because Sherlock had been in a good mood all day.
"John you probably know this, but I'm new to this whole relationship thing and I don't know how it's supposed to work, what I'm supposed to do, or really anything about it. I'm sorry if I screw it all up" he was rambling but was sincere.
Reluctantly Sherlock budged from the sofa and sluggishly walked to the kitchen and handed John things from the fridge.
“what brings you over here? Did something show up about my sister?” he asked anxiously. “no, unfortunately not. We are still analyzing samples and investigating suspects. I actually just wanted to see you and maybe ask you something.” Lestrade spoke smoothly, piquing Victor’s attention. “Oh? Alright. Well, I’m always happy to see you. Sorry couldn’t come by the station today, I’ve been trying to tend to this” he said pointing to his face. “I figured something had happened when you didn’t drop by, but I’m sad to find out you were hurt.” Greg said as he poured the amber liquid into the glasses on the coffee table. “I’ll be alright, besides-you’re here now.” Victor said as he leaned over to kiss Lestrade, who closed his eyes and leaned into his touch. Sherlock’s warning played in the back of his head, but he continually tried to push it out. This was all for the case, it didn’t mean anything, he was just playing a part…or at least that’s what he tried to convince himself of.
I'm sorry this isn't as long as my other chapters but I hope you all enjoy it, I hope to have chapter 15 up within the next week.
John chuckled “last night, you told Greg to take Victor to dinner, show him around- you know things all the goldfish like. You like when I take you out, so you’re a goldfish now too.” The doctor was so proud of his statement, but Sherlock wasn’t amused, or at least he wouldn’t let anyone know if he was. “I’m going to sleep John. Wake me when we land.”
John pulled Sherlock to his chest and cradled him in close, occasionally pressing a kiss to the top of his head.
"No you won't, you will push yourself until you think I'm happy. I'll be nervous to, I mean Sherlock we shouldn't just decide to do it on a certain day, we should wait until we are both comfortable and in the mood for it."
All the years since leaving Victor he had dealt with the consequences of his own coping mechanisms, but failed to deal with the trauma that instigated them. He had reflected more on his actual relationship with Victor more this last month than ever, but hadn’t fully let himself remember all the things he was trying so hard to forget. So that’s what he was going to let himself do…remember. He opened the briefcase and pulled out all of the meticulously sorted papers. He spread them across John desk and stared at each main statement he had highlighted in bold.  He read over them all until it felt like acid was boiling up in his throat, wanted to spill out onto the page and disintegrate all of the text, he hoped it would erase all of the memories too. Maybe if he couldn’t remember he wouldn’t feel so fucked up. He kept reading and kept remembering, it all played out like a movie before his eyes, he could almost feel the harsh lashes of hands, whips, crops, and whatever else was close by on his skin once more. He hated that when he got to the many instances of rape he could almost feel Victor back inside of him. He hadn’t noticed that John had woken up and made his way to the sitting room.
John ran his hand down Sherlock torso and smirked when he reached Sherlock’s growing erection, taking his time to bring it to its full potential. Sherlock’s breathing was heavy, and he was growing desperate. John reversed their positions again, “What do you want?” he asked gently biting Sherlock’s lip. “Anything. Whatever you want John, I’ll tell you if it’s too much.” Sherlock said breathily. John gave him a worried look. “I promise.” Sherlock followed up with and John made quick work of repeating the actions Sherlock had just performed on him. John had experimented a bit with men in UNI and the army but if you had told him his life would have turned out this way a few months ago he would have laughed. Now John couldn’t even think about having sex with anyone besides Sherlock. John loved the taste of Sherlock’s cock, savoring the beads of precum that would occasionally flow from the tip.
“Emily, stop. We don’t need to talk about that right now. This isn’t about him anymore, it’s about me and you. I want you to get some rest and then we are going to find a way out of here.” Sherlock said as he extended his legs, letting them come to rest on the cool ground.
“John” Sherlock said in a conversational way rather than a moan of extasy. John moaned out a small ‘hmm’ encouraging Sherlock to continue. “John, I want you to fuck me.” Sherlock said seriously. The doctor stopped dead in his tracks and replayed the sentence in his head. He kissed up Sherlock’s back until he reached the nape of his lovers’ neck. His cock came to rest nestled between Sherlock’s bubble-like cheeks, “Sherlock… are you sure?” he asked hesitantly and felt the detective nod his head. “yes, John. I wouldn’t ask if I wasn’t serious. Please. Please I need it. Put your cock inside me.” Sherlock was borderline begging as he pushed back against John’s raging hard length. John held Sherlock tightly in his arms and leaned over the other man’s shoulder to kiss him, “we don’t have to, if you want to stop-“ John started, sounding like a broken record, but a sweet one. Sherlock huffed and rolled his eyes “ I know, I know, I’ll tell you if I want to stop. Now fuck me.” John moaned deeply, hearing Sherlock talk like this was intensifying his own arousal. The shorter man took the bottle of lube from the nightstand and began to work Sherlock open with his fingers. The detective’s cock was leaking with pre-come and he was completely pliant under John’s touch. Only for John Watson would Sherlock be pliant.
“you’re in luck, he’s available. You know where his office is?” she said but Sherlock had already begun to make his way down the hall.
“ wh-what does it matter if your name is with the case, god knows you take most of the credit for cases like this anyway.” Lestrade said in a confused tone. He looked at Sherlock, really looked at him and for a moment it was as if he could see fear in his eyes.
Sherlock was stepping over rubble when he turned back to look at her, “to you? I didn’t know he ever hurt you, he always seemed so loving towards you.”
" doesn't make me feel any better, doesn't matter though. I'm going to take a bath." He kissed John quickly and walked away.
This was the first-time John had been granted permission to touch Sherlock here. Much like the man it belonged to, his cock was long, and pale save for the rosy pink tip that was dripping with pre-cum. “John” Sherlock said breathily. “John, I’m-I’m close” he panted, and John looked to him, a soft smile on his lips “Cum for me beautiful.” John encouraged him as he stroked him faster, turning his wrist on the upstroke. Soon Sherlocks muscles tensed, and he held his breath. He exhaled and repeated John’s name as milky white shots of cum coated his and John’s stomachs. John fell onto his back next to his lover.
When the court was called to session, they began with Emily. Victor was charged with kidnapping, attempted murder, and child endangerment- but the evidence wasn’t found sufficient for child abuse. Sherlock met Emily’s eyes, she gave a smile and a small shrug that seemed to say ‘you can’t win them all.’ When John grabbed his hand he knew it was his part of the case that was about to be given a verdict.
When he awoke none of his stuff had been taken and he wasn’t injured…but Billy and the GPS were gone. His chest got tight and was nearing on a panic attack when he forced himself to breathe how John had taught him, and he squeezed his fist tight around the flashlight. He was lost and he knew it, there was no use in denying it. There was nothing in this maze of the dead that he could deduce to lead him back to the surface. He made the decision to continue looking for Emily and worry about their return later and if a few tears fell from his eyes no one but him would ever know.
Sherlock was alarmingly still on the drive to the courthouse, and remained stoic as they sat on the pew inside the room waiting to be called to jury. “ you haven’t taken anything have you?” John asked out of genuine concern. He could practically feel Mycroft behind him listening for the response.
“Sherlock, Christ! You wanted to two days ago and now you’ve decided it’s not good enough for your attention!” Lestrade was growing frustrated. “listen, I don’t want to do this to you, but I can force you to take this case.” Sherlocks eyes shot up, icy cold staring at the detective inspector. “you turning away from this case is different from others that you have rejected. Mainly because you entered the crime scene, you looked around, you know details of the investigation, and because of that you are involved now. Listen, if you don’t help us and cooperate, I have the power to take legal action against you and that is the last thing I want to do. So, please, for once just nod your head yes and do what we require of you. The sooner you solve it the sooner we can all move on.” Greg said with an exhausted sigh.
It was the night before the trial, Sherlock and John both felt uneasy but continued on as if it were another day. When they settled into bed that night John pulled Sherlock onto his chest and played lazily with his curls while Sherlock traced stars around the entry point of John’s scar.
They walked down the hall from sherlocks room to see Mrs. Hudson standing in the middle of their living room setting food down on the coffee table. “oh hello boys, I made extra dinner and just wanted to bring you some. Sherlock, love, what’s with all the cigarettes in the ash tray are you alright?” john halfway anticipated Sherlock to snap at her knowing the topic was very fresh on his mind but was pleasantly surprised when Sherlock nodded his head but kept his eyes to the floor. John looked at Mrs. Hudson who gave Sherlock a sad smile he would never see. She reached out and took his hands in hers and took a step closer “Remember, I’m just downstairs.” John could see that she gave his hands a small squeeze and johns mouth all but hit the floor when Sherlock squeezed hers back and looked her in the eye and said “I know” under his breath before giving her a quick kiss on the cheek. John struggled to grasp the fact that the man he met a few years ago, the man who was so emotionally detached, who couldn’t read social cues, who still even to this day laughed at inappropriate moments and unintentionally said horribly insensitive things to people, was in fact slowly learning how to love again. And not just how to love, but how to show it.
“Sorry, let me get this straight. You don’t want to detain him or want him to know we are leaving the country but you want to invite him with us?” Greg said surprised.
