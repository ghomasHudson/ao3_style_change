“He did say something about ‘National Importance.’” John says, putting his phone away.
“You know, I’m still waiting.” John says.
The Alpha’s hairs stand up on the back of his neck, a sense of danger looming. He’s barely able to thank the doctor before he’s rushing downstairs to tell Sherlock, but bumps into Iris along the way. He stops not wanting to run the little Omega over and that’s when he notices it. Iris never smelled pregnant these past few days, he just smells like flowers.
While he writes down everything, John finds that he’s very intrigued by Mycroft’s office. It looks exactly like he would expect of the man, but the smell is what is throwing him off. It smells clean, like the clinics, scent neutralizing chemicals were clearly used but it also smelled faintly of scent blockers, like the ones used on A Study in Pink, but not the cheap ones that people buy at the store just too lightly mask it. No this is something completely different, something that is stronger and clearly being used to hide, not just mask. The slight smell of rosemary hits his nose when Mycroft suddenly has pain in his jaw, the root canal Sherlock had been talking about clearly evident, showing how correct the detective was in his deduction.
“Thank you.” John says, hugging the teen tight before patting him on the side, to scooch off him. They separate for the night, John leaving his barely touched beer and heading to bed, feeling only slightly guilty that he let Iris scent him, but he lets it slide, knowing they were just comforting each other.
smell of disinfectant now. No, the cat doesn’t come into it.” Sherlock is trying to distract John now. Too afraid he’ll think the case seems too similar to the way John had put a rift between himself and Iris, even if only temporary. “Raoul’s internet records do, though. Hope we can get a cab from here.” He turns back around from John and rushes down the street, coat flapping behind him. He hears the Alpha following a moment later, though he doesn’t try to catch up to the Omega, instead only trailing after him.
“Kill you?” Moriarty makes a face, grimacing. “N-No, don’t be obvious. I mean, I’m gonna kill you anyway someday. I don’t wanna rush it, though. I’m saving it up for something special. No-no-no-no-no. If you don’t stop prying…” He pauses, clearly being dramatic which he seems to enjoy being. “I’ll
The teen smells and tastes delicious, the slick warm on his tongue, the scent almost enough to make him lose control. But he’s experienced and he keeps his Alpha at bay, even as he rumbles in his chest each time he gets another mouthful of sweet nectar. He sucks and nibbles at the flesh and he can’t see it but Sherlock can feel each time he does it because Iris’s cock twitches. John finishes one side and moves to the other, testing out how his fingers fit as he goes between them. He widens his digits to see if a fourth will fit and gets a little peak inside of Iris’s hole, which he fills with another finger. The other thigh is slowly cleaned of slick, his tongue drawing patterns into flesh.
Sherlock only lasts a few minutes before John is gripping the young Prince by his hips as he feels the Omega begin to grind down into him, no doubt seeking friction against his leaking hole. Stilling those sinful motions, John loves the feel of the small frame, but must force the thoughts from his head before he’s tempted to take the boy in front of the other Alphas. Trying to claim such a prize would undoubtedly end in bloodshed as the other’s would attempt to fight for their right to mate the Prince instead.
The precum spreads easily as he lightly thumbs at the slit before griping the shaft. He’s teasing more than anything, causing Sherlock’s legs to vibrate in his hold as he forces the Omega’s pleasure to switch from his hole to his own cock. John wants this first time to have everything, for Sherlock to think back on it and jump him because he’d done an amazing job.
“Something’s wrong with this picture.” Sherlock says, his voice dripping with suspicion.
Iris rubs his head into John’s chest then decides to crawl fully into the Alpha’s lap, pushing himself up so he can rub his face into his neck. He does it all slowly, letting John just lay there, exhausted. The Omega continues pushing the bounds, getting his neck right up against John’s to scent him slowly. It’s not sexual, just like the scenting they did in the bed. It’s comforting and gentle, John lets Iris’s scent wash over him and he can feel the stiffness he had ease out of him. At the same time, Iris’s muscles relax as tension bleeds out of the teen. Stress that John hadn’t realized the Omega had until he goes slack in his arms as they bask for a while in each other's warmth.
“Oh, it’s something I think even
“You’re still hanging round him.” She’s clearly curious, but John isn’t sure if it’s the drama she’s getting off on or if she might actually believe she’s doing him a favor by warning him.
“So how’d he do it?” Lestrade asks, picking up the file and heading for his office.
“Good job baby. You take me so well. Now, let’s get you all nice and
“J-John. Nnnnhh.
“Be a good Prince and stay.” John commands and when he lets go the Omega doesn’t budge an inch, afraid if he does that John will change his mind. Determined to be a good boy for the Alpha, willing to do anything to have John be his. To have the Alpha he’s been dreaming about claim him. Sherlock whines when he feels the Alpha’s warm body leave his own, the cock that had been pressed up against his entrance no longer providing him with that slight stimulation.
"No."
"Don't be daft John, I'm coming with you."
The boys chatted amiably, and owing to the quality of some of John’s observations, Sherlock was less afraid that John’d had too much to drink.
The boy, who was apparently teenage John Watson had a resigned look on his face, one full of too much responsibility for a 15 year old. Older John stood there remembering this scene from his past. He had been in bed asleep on Christmas Eve when he heard the front door fly open and bang against the opposite wall. From the upstairs bedroom he could hear his father downstairs, loud, blustery and drunk.
They walked up the stairs in silence. John opened the door. No Mike yet, still out maybe or at his new girlfriend’s flat.
“Yeah, but you think everyone else is.”
“Now?”
I look over at Jim Moriarty. He's sweating and looks agitated, smiling manically. Has he been talking all this while?
"John!!" Sherlock turned to him with a genuinely beaming smile. The flat was a terrible mess, Sherlock stood in the kitchen, bottles, flasks, Bunsen burners and not one, but two microscopes on the kitchen table. Sherlock stood there with safety goggles on, amid the mess--
"Not here." John said under his breath.
"Hi Sherlock. Studying?" she was smiling.
"Don't be daft. I binned it." Had to tell him. Of course I binned it.
Removes the paper and cuts one straw into four smaller straws. Hands one to me. Pulls out a very small envelope and dumps a small pile of white powder on to the mirror.
"It's our flat, we can do what we want." I whisper and caress his hand. I would have sex with John on every piece of furniture in this flat, if he's amenable.
And I could only just lay there, spent and shaking as John held me. Somewhere in my mind palace and old sea chest opened up and I promised myself that I'd make him feel as worshipped as he had me.
The fire was warm and I was sleepy, the whiskey not helping.  I looked down at my glass and realized it was empty.
"Which one?" Mary asked, amused smile on her face, glancing at the door of the pub as it slammed shut.
Mary put her fork down and watched John at first push himself away from the table, then stand up. His voice was low and he sounded concerned.
He was shocked when he opened the door to see Mycroft standing in the middle of the sitting room.
“Mary, not now, please.” John was shaking his hand and wincing. “It’s Jim that’d better have a good reason for his actions.” John was pointing at Jim and practically shaking.
When John got back to the table, his father had already gone, his mother was doing the dishes and Harriet was expectantly glaring at him over her glass of milk.
"My flat."
I assure you."
After that it didn't take long for John to come. His hand fell away from mine, his thrusting erratic, his face red. He arched his back up off the bed and flooded my hand. He smiled up at me.
and then down his chest raking my teeth over a nipple. He was breathing heavily now, we both were.
"Friend of mine--
For me? I wasn't the one he had an issue with. That'd be John---
"Sorry?" Ian was not one for gossip that goes on constantly among the footballers and their girlfriends.
John got two beers from the fridge. He handed a beer to Sherlock.
At this point John was close to tears, he thought again of going back into the hospital lobby to warm up and try to call again. Leaning back against he bench, he looked at the sky. This was a monumentally stupid idea. Just to think that anyone would see him was ridiculous. And who? How could he communicate?     Why wouldn't Sherlock answer the phone back at the flat? Where could he be?
I'm certainly not going to spend the weekend thinking about Victor.
"Well I..." John started, getting into the car and looking around. It was a little MG convertible. Mycroft was driving, there was no one else in the car.
John explained to Sherlock what he found in Harry's coat pocket, his trip to Broomfield and Mycroft's help.
John was not completely out of his depth. He had seen his mother mend clothes, and even though not properly trained,  wondered how different it could be to bring skin edges together. The blood loss and concussion were altogether another thing entirely, though.
I know I took too long to answer her.  I just stood there, on the pavement, half way to our building, staring at her, or rather, through her.
"Why would you leave your coat?"
I'm good at running, but it was too late to run.
I inch closer and slip my right hand into his jacket and feel his waist 'round the side. He makes a tiny smirk.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
But he wouldn't look up. He toed on his shoes and reached for his coat before I started to panic.
"Where is he tonight? Did something happen? Are you two allright?" she asked, whispering, now concerned.
John ran outside. The snow was falling harder, which was a surprise so late in April. He ran up and down the pavement like a madman staring at the sky. He turned back to the hospital to see if he could be spotted from the front of the building. Luckily, no one was there to witness his frantic display.
“Right. By the way, do you need a bath? Because you..well..” John pointed to Sherlock’s ensemble and Sherlock laughed.
I looked over at Jim, he was still smiling. He looked very far away, as if at the end of a long tunnel. I have to get out of here. I managed to stand, lurching, I'm sure. I left the room, found my coat and made my way outside to the snowy street. I had to lean on the brick building until I was sure I wouldn't fall. I should be cold, but I was warm. My legs didn't want to walk, but they were moving, finally.
to me. It's annoying.
He was able to talk at times, but his speech was slow and slurred. "John, don't tell Mycroft, don't."
John recalls briefly what Sherlock said months ago,
"He has a brother--wait-- how do you know anything about Sherlock? And the family he has or doesn't have?"
Sighing,  he was just glad to be home. Home. 221 B Baker street, his home for the last 10 years. The flat he lived in was small and dingy but there was no place on earth he'd rather be.
He was talking when I leaned over to kiss him. I slid a little closer so were touching. Lips, arms, thighs. I close my eyes. I don't know what he wants, so I do what I always do, Sit up a bit, lean on him,  encouraging him to lay back. But he won't have it, he pushes back. He gets up--kneeling on the bed and reaches both of his hands under my vest, to touch my stomach. The abruptness makes me gasp. I haven't been touched in a while.
When John had to finally leave the flat, Sherlock told him to go on ahead and he’d be by later, but John did not really think Sherlock would come to the party.
a few minutes. Despite Sherlock’s demands, Mike insisted on stopping by this party for a quick drink before taking him there.
Sherlock whispered again, still kissing him, breaking them apart briefly and looking him in the eyes. It was much darker in the kitchen now, with just a small light on in the sitting room, far away.
John shook his head, “I’m not! I’m not as drunk as I think I am.” He crossed his arms in front of him and then started to look around a bit.
But why is he with this large group of people? So out of character for him.
I stood at one end of said corridor strategizing just how to navigate my way to the other. The game stopped when they saw me. I heard someone whisper,
As soon as the lift doors closed, I pulled off the dressing gown, tossed it into my room and made for the stairway. I had already disabled the cameras down the back staircase and the ones behind the building.
John continued to watch the car and was surprised when the headlamps blinked on and off. Again. Again. Confused, he got up. He went outside and started to walk towards the car. The car was running, headlamps on, wipers wiping the windows. The patient driver just sitting, waiting.
“John? Hello, sorry to call- is it dinner at yours? Didn’t want to be a bother but…”
Sherlock said, slowly placing the metal piece on the table, getting up to search for a plasticine bag.
"How do you know he had a mistress?" Lestrade asked.
Sherlock is never quiet when he tries to get his point across--he just keeps going. I should have let him explain himself, instead of jumping all over him. I never should have let myself get so angry.
They wouldn't be alive long enough to worry."
The crowd dispersed, the bloke John beat up was taken away to hospital by the medics. There were only a few of us left in the pub. Those not directly involved in the fight were let go.
"No. That's at Oxford. I thought you went to University of London." Sherlock was tired of all the hilarity.
Then it was a very hungry kiss, a kiss that wanted to make up for the many months apart and some mixed messages this morning. It quickly became hot and needy. As Sherlock's shirt fell open, he moaned against John's mouth and a small buzzing noise started in John's head.
"Bloody hell. I don't know." I lifted his eyelids and flashed the torch at his eyes, his pupils were very small.  999 sounded about right. I walked over to the phone on the wall.
His Dad looked at him in surprise and Harriet started to snicker, and he turned and threw his napkin at her. It landed harmlessly in the middle of the table.
The boys walked slowly back to the flat. The night was warm for January and they chatted all the way, Sherlock expanding on some of his theories about the case he was working on with Lestrade.
Mrs. Hudson, my landlady meets me in the hallway as I unlock the front door. She points upstairs.
Popping his head around the doorframe of the loo, Sherlock laughs derisively, “What are you on about?  What girl?”
“I ducked down a side street and came up behind the building. How’s it feel to be outsmarted?” John was not smiling.
"Molly! Fine, I'm fine." he said. Molly could tell he was well on his way. John's eyes were glassy and he swayed slightly.
"Not this year." John suddenly felt self conscious, the tips of his ears going pink.
a bright blue concoction with fruit. I had two.
"Yeah, he's breathing. I thought,
No call or letter from Mary, though.
Where would I go if I was Sherlock and with a large group of people?
“Kandahar, Devon, London…” John says slowly, dreamily, turning over, folding his pillow in half.
John shook his head “Why? You mean--the pub? Listen Mary, I have to tell you—I’m sorry. I--  I am, but I had to go help Sherlock…” he gestured toward the door. The party was so loud, even with the door shut, the noise was coming into the bedroom.
“Just like that-- you’re going?” John asked, gesturing towards Sherlock’s closed door.
She sat down on my mussed bed, still crying, but softer now. Tears streaming down her face.
John was relieved when it was time to go back. His parents offered to drive him, but he told them he’d rather take the train in.
"How is he?" she asked.
"Just looking at you." John smiled. He put his head down, his cheeks hot.
Too late to avoid them. Disappointingly, he could see them speed up to catch up to him.
I went home with a splitting headache. It was just Lestrade and me in the car for the last part of the trip.
"If you get into any trouble then, I'm not getting involved." John hissed at him as they rang the bell at the tony row house in Knightsbridge. Despite the quiet street, expensive cars parked along the kerb, loud pop music could be heard through the windows.
I saw Mary again, she introduced me to her friend Jim. Mary was smiling from ear to ear and said something about Ibiza.
flat."
The man in the car paused for quite a few minutes, frowning.
Mike appears over Liz's shoulder, "Liz, come to bed." he reaches for her hand and pulls her gently back to his room as she protests.
He groaned, "The room spins if I move too fast."
"No. Anything. Just anything."
“Hungry? -- want to get some Chinese?” Sherlock repeated.
My arm tingled from where John touched me, all the way to the pub. I shouldn't have come along, but...to be honest, I
"Help who?" Sherlock squinted down at him, shaking his head. "Believe me, you don't want to get involved in any of this. Best to stay out of it, concentrate on your studies, medical school is very time consuming, I hear." Sherlock walked away from John, towards the cafe door, "Thanks Mrs. Hudson. Once again, I owe you." he said quietly reaching for the door knob.
Around the corner he ran into Jim Moriarty.
“How do you know?” Jim took a sip of his drink and swallowed hard, “That you weren’t in any danger?” He sneered.
I turned around, Mike and Molly were nowhere to be seen. I didn't mind at all, there was plenty to take in.
John's face was dark and clouded, “Where have you been?"
“What’s wrong with your brother?” his mom asked, concern in her voice.
"Sherlock," John's eyes were bleary, he was swaying slightly, feet spread apart for balance. Standing there in trainers and football kit he looked fit from Sherlock's vantage point. John had his arms folded  in front of his chest--probably to help his balance. The position added definition to his strong arms.
I could only nod at this point. They disappeared again, into  the foam.
It was dinnertime, John's entire family was home. There was no way he and Sherlock could have any kind of real conversation. He tried to walk the phone as far away from the family as he could to have some degree of privacy.
"Not your fault." he let's out a sigh.
But they didn’t get very far.
John pulled his leg out from under the table, knocking his chair over. He also ran his mum over getting to the phone almost dropping the receiver when he got there.
John took a step back from him and turned away, head down. “Sherlock, I…” John began.
"Yeah!--he left the pub with that bloke, right Mike? I heard he's a drug dealer and I heard that Sherlock Holmes had a drug problem-- last year--
Mary, Sherlock--of course there is no competition. Mary petite blonde, flirty, charming. Fun loving. And Sherlock--who defies all description. Imperious and vulnerable. Granite and fragile. As cold as ice and a hot as…well. God, the night they just spent together was the most fun he had ever had in bed…and that was saying something. He could imagine himself staying with Sherlock forever…if…well.
Sherlock touched the back of John’s  neck, gently pulling him closer. Sherlock turned his head to the side a bit, opening his mouth a bit more, eagerly wanting to make it as easy as possible for John to kiss him, to touch as much of John's soft wet lips as he could reach with his own.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
“It’s very likely that we both have a bit of a concussion. But, you should know that as someone studying medicine." Sherlock looked pointedly at John.
Jim took a swing at me and missed. I dogged his fist. He pushed me, hard.  With the momentum I already had, I went sailing over the balcony on my way to the floor below.
Injured, yet undeterred.
I knew all the girls fancied Sherlock, not just Molly. I'm not stupid, I have eyes. I see them--the uni girls, the servers at the pub or at restaurants. Girls on the street, even. They all look at him and smile. He talks so much about body language, how can he not notice? He does--he notices. He just---
Frantically, John finds track pants for himself and tosses another pair to Sherlock, who puts them on quickly.
It was....
John slowly walked out of the bedroom. He stood in the doorway and looked up at Sherlock, who was holding two red cups. John smiled shyly, still confused a bit about what just happened with Mary.
He pulled away from me laughing, that wicked smile on his lips that I love so much. "John, you're appalled by my weight loss." he started to rock back and forth slightly in my lap.
said Ian, football captain again this year, placing his arm around John's shoulders.
"I don't know why he says that." he looked nervous now, running his hand through his hair. "He was drinking, Sherlock. I didn't push him. He fell."
Tucked away on a busy street in Westminster, opposite of the St James tube station, five young men sit  at a long curved desk looking a bank of monitors in the dark.
I looked down at John, my eyes adjusted a bit to the low light. He had gained a stone in the last year, putting on weight since his discharge from the military. My breath caught in my throat, gazing down at his defined arms and muscles of his shoulders. I stood there momentarily shocked.
I laughed and let go, cheeks pink. "Sorry. Come on, I'll buy."
When Mike came in the boys were sitting on the floor on either side of the game board—which was precariously atop a pile of books. The boys were involved in a heated argument about the game but invited Mike to play.
I asked him if there was a better time or place for him. I didn't want to put him out, but my marks were improving. I dreaded a time when he would not show up at all, just disappear. Eventually we were studying in my room. He seemed slightly more relaxed there, but only slightly.
Jack says as he slaps Ian roughly on the back. "You may need to sit down for this one."
John was next to take a spin. As he ducked under her arm, he could see Sherlock talking to Molly from across the room.
"What? Sherlock, wait!" John calls after him, distressed.
… Look at how he jumped to your defense last time we saw each other, right?”  Jim said, rubbing at his jaw, as if to make a point.
This wasn't going to be easy.
No one but Mike saw what happened, “Don’t be disappointed, Molly, he’s always like that. He just doesn’t like to socialize.”
He stared unseeingly at the glossy pages of a fashion magazine and he looked up to see someone standing in the doorway.
"Not entirely sure," John said looking up at him, chewing. " You seem to be on your own, somehow."
For a quick minute, he entertained the idea of getting up to see if the door had a lock so he wouldn't be bothered. Too late, the door swing open, letting humid air from the party, as well as the cacophony, into the stair well.
He shrugged. "He talks lots about school." Jim's cheeks were a high pink. "Anyways, that something I gave you there, hope you like it. And my number, of course, again."
I have a pretty good tolerance for alcohol, but even I was starting to feel a bit lightheaded. How long have we been here? I saw Mike and Molly dancing for a bit. I told them I was going to find water.
“What do we do?” Someone asked.
Jack wipes his mouth on the back of his hand after downing his pint.
“Sure.” John said, to be honest, he didn’t feel at all at ease anymore in the library and was glad for the company.
He leaned down to kiss John and ran the tip of his warm tongue along John's bottom lip.
"Well, I'd never ask him to." John said seriously, regretting very much stopping by to say hello.
He looked back at the driver. “Oh no, that won’t be necessary, thanks.”
Sherlock put his coat back on, smiling. “How 'bout Italian?”
John walked back to his room and Sherlock followed right on his heels. John turned around, “Please, please don’t, no I mean it--don’t.” he practically all but whispered.
“Tell her what?”
"Where?"
"You must be John," she said, placing it carefully down.
Quickly and gracefully, Sherlock jumped up from the floor and tossed his coat on the sofa.
I'm on my own here. Mary was watching me carefully. I sighed and tried to catch myself, but it sounded more like a groan. A groan of someone who wanted nothing more than a quiet, warm night in, but who now has to do something dreadful.
First order is food. I'll feel better when I eat. Next is deciding if I call him.
"Just leaving." I tipped my bottle upside down to drain it.
John turned to her, clearing his throat, “Fine yeah, fine.” He looked out the window again, drifting.
"I hope so--" John started and then the flat door opened with such force, it slammed into the opposite wall. The boys jumped and turned toward the door.
Over the next two weeks, John stopped over to the flat every few days to check on Sherlock-and sometimes bring food.
I turned and could only stare at this point. My head swam and I tried to look though the foam to see who it was. The whole of Fresher's Week, no one said a thing. Not even Mary, who was attached to my hip.
"No current employer."
Stamford put his hand up. “It’s fine, John, I know---“
Leaving Sherlock on the sofa resting he went to the loo to look for supplies. He located soap and flannels for washing and drying.
I turned around suddenly and practically shouted at him, "What the FUCK is going on, Sherlock?" My anger getting the better of my need to be careful that he was in my room in the wee hours of the morning. I winced after I realized that the entire floor could have heard me. Probably heard me. Definately heard me.
He said between kisses.
“What to talk about it, dear?” She said tentatively.
He wouldn't look up at me. I started to apologize, but it was too late. After he left, I sat on the bed, hating myself. I jumped up and took off after him, but couldn't find him on the street. I was afraid to show up at his school, so I went back to the residence hall.
"And why do you want to spend some time with this piece of metal?”
This was going nowhere.
Sherlock is not as careful as John wants him to be. He can be quiet and dignified and brilliant as well as loud, brash and unapologetically himself.
Time for John to make his move. He looked up at her, she was still waiting for her answer. The room was quiet and Mary was waiting-- he was just going to lean forward and kiss her.
Sherlock managed to open one eye. "Shut up."
"I'm sure you are overheated, you can use that to..." he was interrupted by someone rapping on the outside of the door,
As Sherlock ducked, it dawned on John in a split second just who this ‘thug’ was.
Jim shook his head slowly, "I don't have a plan, I'm just going to give him
By the time Sherlock gets back to bed, John is fast asleep. As the early morning light creeps in to the bedroom, Sherlock gets back in bed, pulling the blankets up around them both and curling himself around John.
John got back to the flat he shared with the football team and was met by a group of lads in the sitting room who all stood up when he entered. He noticed that they were all wearing new football jerseys.
"See you tomorrow, John Watson." Sherlock whispers and walks away to his bedroom and closes the door.
Molly gave a big sigh and stood up. "I have to go. I know I'm being stupid, John. It's silly." she smiled and shook her head. "We never even went out on a date."
She looked at John with sad eyes.  And then looked down at the bag in her hands.
John chuckled, and looked down at his shoes, cheeks pink but not from drinking. "Ian, I..." John looks over at the girls who indeed are looking directly at John and Ian, giggling.
Both boys jumped. Sherlock stepped out into the hallway. “Fine,” he called over his shoulder, walking away.
Keeping a keen eye on the camera, he ventured out to the middle of the lot.
“Yes- I plan to have a lie in.” John added, still studying the rules.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Making love is a different prospect, though, and can be full of promises, tenderness, care and comfort. I wasn't ready when it arrived.
He looks down at John, who is quiet, listening.
“Is there something wrong?” Asked John.
Jim laughed. "Sherlock Holmes is the greatest thing since sliced bread, my dear. His family is
I freeze. This could be a deterrent. "What's the price?" I look over at him. I could get up and walk away now. Nothing lost.
John could not think about Sherlock without the hair at the back of his neck standing on end.
"I just wanted to let you know that I don't hold any grudges against John."
They walked into the hallway, John realized that there was yet another room, behind the first. He walked over and stood in the doorway dumbfounded.
I caught myself, thankfully, before I could sound
I would ditch the people, of course.
I stood there--she was blocking my exit.
he said, hopping up again. I started to protest, but he was back quickly, handing me a refreshed glass of toffee-colored liquid. I laughed, "What's gotten into you, John?"
There's the question of the day.
There were private negotiations on my behalf. Mycroft called in a few favors. I was not involved in the smuggling. No selling. My brother knows that, I'm just a user, plain and simple.   Still, the charges had to be severe. Ankle monitor. drug rehab, mandatory counseling, probation officer. All of which I tried to avoid, skip, and alter with varying degrees of success, because I'm an idiot. Without Mycroft I'd be in HMYOP, or worse.
By all means, go ahead." he waves his hand at the mirror, with a small laugh, all largesse.
Sherlock was fully aware that John had some concerns about his behavior. He just did not care. John was not responsible for him in any way. Sherlock could take care of himself.
I think about John. There are times when I'm angry and hurt and other times, just angry.
"What?" he smiled and brushed my hands away. "You can't possibly want me to stop. Do you?" he reached around my waist again and kissed me along the side of my neck. His face was buried in my neck, hot kisses trailing on my skin. His hands pulling my shirt out of my jeans and making contact with the bare skin of my back.
Twenty minutes later I was on the kerb waiting for Mycroft Holmes to pick me up.  I expected a long black car with driver, but it was just Mycroft behind the wheel of a red MG convertible.
John did not feel like lingering in the quad. Almost immediately, Mike Stamford beat a hasty retreat to join some mates, wildly waving at them and putting some distance between him and his mum.  Mike's mum looked a little put out when he dodged a kiss on the cheek.
He's avoiding me.
I tore off my shirt, tossed it on a chair and pulled on an old vest and my softest dressing gown.
“We still don’t know John. The kids didn’t say…it’s just, just…” she dissolved again into tears.
"Whatever happened tonight, Sherlock." John shrugged. "It's ok.--I trust you." John's voice was almost a whisper.
There she is, visible at the foot of the bed. Dressing gown tied at her waist. Arms crossed over her chest, staring right at him, looking indignant.
"Bottom drawer of the desk."
Over John's shoulder, I can see a relieved look on Mary's face. At least one of us is on the right track.
C drugs with intent to sell, deal or share such drugs, my being at the pub and away from my room has violated the terms of my bail.
“No, I want to go to your room…..if that’s ok.”
The family dinner was quiet, the summer heat made everyone lazy.
I got comfortable on the bed. The hash was in block form, wrapped in aluminium foil, brown. It crumbled a little when I broke a small piece off. I fitted it into the pipe and lighted it.
There was nothing for it, Sherlock could not take him to his residence hall at school and Mycroft's flat was really out of the question.  Baker Street it was.
“Right, they went for tea. My parents--the Watsons. Harry…um.. Harriet--she’s my sister. 'told them I’d wait here.” John said with a weak smile./p>
"I'm wrong--
It's awful about the concussion,  I was pretty certain people would be hurt if things went as wrong as I feared. Too bad it was him.
“My what?” John asks, but the wind whips up and makes it difficult to see. John again has to shield his eyes, and everything goes white.
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Sherlock had not been to this flat or this building before, he wondered who’s it was. Sherlock had to dodge the beach ball as it flew overhead. This flat must belong to someone very popular at uni. Who could have all these friends?
Mary appeared out of the foam momentarily, pressed a drink into my hand, said something in my ear and disappeared.
As the sun was setting, the door opened and Sherlock walked in.
Just the two of them, sitting on the sofa. John jumped up when he saw me, he was smiling broadly.
I've already tried and failed.
I had just been sitting there, staring at the pages anyway. He handed me a cup of tea and sat down opposite.  "Anything?"
Irresponsible Harry--in her last year in secondary school, making the most of it and spending her time at parties and pubs and not at the library. Who are her friends now? John has not been home since Christmas holiday. Had things changed? He knew there were some shaky acquaintances in her past—but last time he saw Harry she had been well---had she reconnected with a bad sort?
“Excuse me folks, this just became my lucky day.” Jim said as he looked toward the door. He gave them a greasy smile and scooped up the tiny envelope. He slid out of the booth and made a quick beeline for Sherlock at the front of the pub.
“Thanks, I’ll take them, my parents'll be right back. I can give the bag to them.”
I'm spending time away from my room. A talent of mine. I've spent a great deal of time avoiding being at school at all. I've spent a night or two at Mycroft's, but that can't continue. It's cold, so it's not as easy as it was to traipse about London.
--look who we have here. Are you
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
I am far less emotional when I'm high. Life's easier this way.
I'm rarely nervous. I'm obnoxious, I'm dismissive, I'm sarcastic, I'm reckless, I'm a drug user, a delinquent--but I'm rarely nervous.
"I wouldn't have come over if I didn't want to, John." he looked at me and smiled.
“Sorry Mum….it’s really…um I don’t think I can, um…” John felt his face turn red as he rubbed the back of his neck with his hand. How Mycroft came to know about John’s family emergency was the question of the day.
John managed a weak “Yes, Mary.”
But what he didn’t see before, he is privy to now.
She took John up the stairs and was surprised to find Sherlock laying on the sofa in a large, adequately furnished flat.  He was shirtless, covered in bright red blood that had spilled down in rivulets from his head to his neck and shoulders. He held a balled up article of clothing to his head and groaned loudly when he saw John in the doorway.
We set up a somewhat comfortable study station at John's. It was best to move elsewhere than the library, but John's room was Paddington Station. If his door had a lock, it was rarely used. From my observations, John is a pretty popular fellow.
He jumped up from the bench with a brilliant idea.
I looked from Molly to Sherlock and back again. She was practically scolding him and he was uncomfortable.
Just a minute Mary,
But I had to go, I was going to be late for supper. My brief trip to the uni library had become much more than the intellectual respite I craved. I had already missed house and roll call, but I can make something
"Admit it. You should be thankful that I was here to rescue you!"  She walked behind the desk to where Sherlock stood and whispered. "What about that fit lad that follows you around? What would he say if this pretty body of yours was marred? Bet he thinks you're the bees knees." Irene pouted and drew her red fingernail along Sherlock's bicep.
I changed my plan to go to dinner.
There was an uneasy silence in the room, John looked down at his shoes.
Mary flew to John’s side. Sherlock looked at John with stunned amazement.
Sherlock can remember Mycroft lecturing him about a year ago, “Sherlock, you have a tendency to think with your heart on these matters. Just don’t bother, it’s better that way.”
"You saw John?" I repeated stupidly. Trying to buy time.
"Sherlock," I stared off into the far distance. I swallowed hard. It's now or never.
Despite my best efforts, someone did notice me. Of course, this is my own fault, I have no self control.
Mike begged off. “As much as I’d love to, I have an early shift at the lab in the morning. Football tomorrow, John?”
I'm slowing down. Dancing, ball pits, clubbing. It's too much--I have bruises from the mechanical bull riding.
"Well that's just what I meant, he's been at it all day--" she started to explain, "John, maybe now that your home, if you'd just-just talk to him maybe..." of course, John knew who she was talking about and why she was so worried, he nodded to her gravely and bounded up the stairs two at a time. He opened the door to his flat. John knew exactly why Mrs. Hudson was worried.
Anomaly. I decided to put it out of my mind. I locked it up in an old sea chest in a locked attic of the mind palace and laughed at myself again.
Something about that night. When I jumped up, I almost knocked my chair over. I reached back to steady it.
I walked past a silent, empty fountain with wet, frozen feet. The snow was slowing. I was just ready to turn back when I saw him. My heart fell like a rock into my frozen wet shoes.
Sherlock didn't answer. John dug through the sewing kit. "You know I'm not a doctor yet, right?
Sherlock wanted to avoid looking in Jim's eyes, so as to not give himself away, so he took a long drink from the offensive beer cup to camouflage his discomfort. He couldn't buy cocaine anyway, he brought no money with him tonight, on purpose. "John's not my boyfriend." He said quietly and walked away.
Our server came with a tray and everyone had a new pint.
"No I don't,
“Well, explain yourself!” She was furious, hands on her hips.
"What about parents or...a family or a home?" Mrs. Hudson didn't ask questions--apparently, how could she not know?
Sherlock rolled his eyes and jumped up.
For example, Mike Stamford was pretty straightforward, he was happy with his girl friend and his job. One day Mike would work at a hospital, Sherlock thought. Doctor? Maybe. Molly? There was another one. Sherlock could imagine Molly as a happy wife and mother, albeit working in a lab. Her clinical skills were sharp. Dissecting cadavers during the week, and baking pies on Saturdays.
I smiled but the joke fell flat. John looked at me, face blank. Any small hope John had of actually going back to sleep was thoroughly dashed  at this point.
Shit. I hesitate. The coke starts to kick in, heart rate increasing.
Where was this message going to go? Where would it end up? John felt he was just shouting a hopeless prayer into the void.
rushed out before I had a chance to catch myself.
John closed his eyes and leaned down and kissed Sherlock on the lips, that were so soft and warm and didn’t seem the least resistant.
Sherlock, cont.
Chapters 17 and 18 are John
John turned his body slightly and shifting his seat, leaned forward coaxing Sherlock back with his body so he gently fell backwards to lean against the sofa.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. As far as John knew, trouble was Sherlocks middle name. He thrived on trouble. He lived for it. But John fought too hard to get here, to this university, and even though Sherlock was important to John, he didn’t want to get sucked down the rabbit hole of Sherlocks chaos.
"Nothing, I just want to be friends."
Tell me, please."
The rain had let up, thankfully. John looked around. The quad was a riot of activity now, students getting dropped off, tumbling out of family cars, taxis and walking onto campus,
“I don’t know--he just got here!” said a blond guy, who was wearing a black and white football jersey and taking Mike’s pulse.
Ian stopped and looked at him seriously.  "Oh, I see, still gutted about Mary?"
,  I leaned down to kiss him.
I was struggling in all of my classes. I had doctor's appointments. I has tests of my memory: short term recall, long term recall. They told me I probably had a worse concussion than they had thought earlier. I had terrible headaches. I had nightmares.
Sighing, John went to the fridge and got a beer. He opened it and sat on the sofa. He hoped this wasn't going to take all night.
"Yeah, I'd like to help, if I can."
I wanted to be with John. There was nothing for it. I just wasn't the best companion. Not tonight. Well, not usually, either.
"Not quite like this, no. "
John looked at Sherlock, who was chuckling quietly under his breath.
John was sitting at a table, his head in his hands. I was standing in the middle of the room pacing, when Lestrade walked up to me.
Still terrified, a suspicion started to dawn on John just at that moment. Sherlock fast asleep. Curtains moving, but no open window. He looked more critically at the kid standing before him. He wasn't dressed like the kids today, but a little more old fashioned. Short hair, patches on the knees of his trousers. No coat. A kid from the past. At that exact moment, John knew he was dreaming. OK, this made much better sense. No it didn't, not really.
"I have a Li-Lo too, around here somewhere, if you prefer." Sherlock smiles wickedly.
The boys were sitting very close on the sofa. John was holding Sherlock’s right hand in his left. John shifted his weight and turned towards Sherlock.
"Should we call an ambulance?" John asked once they had gotten to the street.  Bart's was only one block away.
There's a little hollow right where his collar bone meets the front part of his neck, under that is the scalene muscle. I shivered and thought of Molly. I looked down at my shoes, shoving my hands deep into my pockets. I didn't want him to catch me staring.
Sherlock looked thoroughly perplexed, eyes wide. "What do you mean? Just..."
"Am I bothering you?"
Since I don't see John anymore, I used it all.
Riding in the police car, Sherlock telling me he knows which police station were probably going to because he know which ones are open 24 hours.
'In the future', John thought. Just how long does this detective from Scotland Yard anticipate working with this teenager? John had not ever met a more extraordinary person. There must not be anyone else at university like Sherlock.
Sherlock was sporting another black eye.
The curry had been eaten. Remnants of take away cartons set aside.   The residence hall was quiet, most of the kids gone out.  Sitting on his bed, backs against the wall, books on laps. John invited Mary to 'study' in his room on Friday night after dinner.
Sherlock came back. Mary suddenly let go of me. There was a cold place on my bicep where her warm hand had been.
"How close...were you?"
As soon as my brother was informed that
Sherlock looked up, to find John just staring gape-mouth at him.
Holidays are coming up. Just a few more days of class, then holiday break. Mary and I are at the pub one last time before I have to start getting ready for end of term. We are sitting in a booth, the table top made of out of imbedded coins-mostly pennies, but I saw one and two pounds and 10, 25 and 50 pence.
I need John. I need him on my side. After all, this involves him too.
He told himself he did not feel hot tears stinging behind his eyes.
I sat down on the bed again. "Sherlock it's ok...you know...if you don't want to... I don't expect anything....I just want you to know. "
It was looking like I'd have to take it again next term. It was also looking like this whole term was a waste of time and money. I felt bad for my mum, mostly. Widowed, working long hours to help me with school and here I was, just taking up space.
“If you could stop being a bloody wanker, Sherlock, just for once.”
Irene laughs. "I have to go. Think about what I said."
He sat up with a start when I inadvertently stepped on a creaky floorboard. The sitting room was dim, faint light from the street illuminating the windows.  John sat up rubbing his eyes and I immediately felt a pang of regret about my previous behavior.
I guess. Strictly for entertainment purposes only. I won't be writing this paper.
I gave the operator on the phone all of the information.
"We'll just make dinner. Want to go?" he looked at me,
"Sherlock--you can't" John turned around to look at me/
I wasn't going to tell John
“Oh,” Mrs. Hudson said quietly, “Are you looking for Sherlock?”
I needed to.
"Of?"
Mrs. Hudson let out an exasperated sigh and whispered, "Sherlock, let him in, but I don't want any trouble."  she looked at him pointedly, "or noise."
And that's just what happened. We walked over the the school, signed Sherlock back in and I left, meeting him down the block in about ten minutes.
The music was blasting so loud that only the base of the song could be heard. The chatting and laughing students raised their voices to be heard above the music. The walls were shaking at times.
“Bloody hell...” He hissed under his breath and quickly got to his feet.
This wasn’t just an origami envelope.
John cannot help but admonish himself for leaving his sister, although he knows it is wrong of him. He could not have stayed in Chelmsford. He has a life and a responsibility to get an education. His parents have responsibility too----they should be keeping better eye on their daughter.
Sherlock sat up and kissed John. "I have an idea." He got up, locked the door to the flat and walked back to the sofa. He reached out to take John's hand. "I do have a bedroom-- in the back."
By this point, he had stopped looking for John.
“You're underage.”
Older John Watson can't help but laugh and the secretive planning going on. Despite all the hardships and difficulties during the tours in Afghanistan, the soldiers made time to have some fun. Tonight's party will be a good one.
All of  sudden, the older of the two boys is shouting behind him, “Uncle John! Uncle John! There you are! I’ve been looking  all over for you!!” And turning, John sees himself, laughing and smiling, scooping the little boy up in a great big hug.
I wasn't responsible for bringing Victor's father down. As a mater of fact, Victor and I both became fallout of the demise of his father's 'business'.
“Are you saying that they are plagiarized?” Now this he could sink his teeth into. Completely against university policy. Clear cut rules, if broken, had clear cut consequences.  Things were looking better already
This does not look much like a jail to him. By this time, almost 10 years on, Mary may have served her time for attempted murder of Sherlock, shooting him at Christmastime, but just grazing his abdomen. John knows she had a trial he was a witness and then after being convicted, she went to jail.
more than I liked to admit right now. Things I can't do anything about. I looked off into the distance, surveying the crowd, as nonchalant as my hammering heart could allow. "Do what?" Of course,
Jim had his arm around Mary's shoulder, whispering in her ear. Mary turned red when she saw me. Mary was not my girlfriend, I had no claim on her.  She can talk to any bloke she wants.
It was quiet in the room. John was staring at me. I looked over at him. "What?"
better." His voice was a deep whisper as he kissed me on the lips and made his way down my neck. My hands were in his hair and under his vest. His pajama bottoms were loose and open and I had to reach around to cup his arse.
in the same day!" she scolded. "Young man, do you have
After eating Chinese, the boys walked to the flat that Sherlock and Mike were sharing.  Knackerd from the explosion and stress, John laid down on the sofa and promptly fell asleep.
that he is.... I heard he gets around quite a bit…heard he’s made his way through a least 3 of the residence halls…breaking hearts as he goes,” Jim snickered, and made a movement as if wiping a tear away from his eye.
"Never got a chance to talk to you." Shook his head. "Tried and tried, but--always thwarted." He squinted at me.  "You don't need protecting, do you?"
Older John watches the two young men trudge up the path to the big house on the hill. As evening falls, the moon is bright and the air is full of tiny glittering snowflakes and anticipation. He glances back at his small companion, silent at his side.
Sherlock shivered. He felt the hard callouses on John's hand on the soft under side of his arm.
His mom stood in the door way to ask if he wanted coffee, but stopped when she saw John cover Sherlock with a blanket. John smiled quietly to himself and tiptoed out of the sitting room.
Usually, dreams of Kandahar are nightmares, of roadside bombs and screaming, rarely are they of routine daily life, as this one seems to be. His small guide leads him inside the mess hall.
John never minded a few beers, but tried to shy away from drinking too much, because of Harry. John wanted to have fun and relax but was afraid to lose control. He was afraid if he drank too much,  he would be doomed to be an alcoholic like his sister.
He had his back to me, reaching up and running his hand along the edge of the ceiling and the wall. He had on only my track pants, which were far too big for him in the waist and hung down around his hips. He turned to me. "Sorry," he said looking down. "Couldn't sleep."
“Sherlock, what the hell is going on?” John hissed in a fury.
John watches Sherlock cross the room, to his side and reaching for the blanket at the bottom of the bed, gently, tenderly pulls it up to lay across John’s shoulders. He then goes over to his side, gets in the bed and turns off the light.
”The flat was too hot. I opened the window in the kitchen.” John said slowly, looking in the fridge, no milk.
Sherlock was up and pulling on clothes when I got back. "I should go," he said softly, glancing over his shoulder at me. I walked up to him and wrapped my arms around his waist from behind.
He needed to talk to Sherlock. Maybe warn him?
He gently got out of bed and walked to the bath. He turned on the hottest water he could stand to warm away the fatigue in his body.
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
But this bloke was a fast runner. Despite dodging medicine carts and skirting by nurses, he bolted down the stairwell at the end of the corridor and John lost him.
“Obviously, we have to get him to hospital.” Sherlock stated to no one in particular in the group.
We all had our red wristbands on, ready to get into the pre-paid parties. The wristband was a little dear on my part, but my sister told me to do it, it'd be worth it.
Maybe I'm imagining things. How many pints have I had?
"And..."
"John, I,  um…" Sherlock began softly, quietly, not knowing what to say but wanting to offer some kind of comfort.
I hand him the opener and eye the door. "Don't leave, Sherlock, not just yet. There's a back room here. I've booked--for my own particular use."
I tossed my coat over John's on the chair. When he left, I pulled the item out of my shirt pocket and turned it over in my hands. A small folded envelope, white. Of course, I know what this is.
He turned to pick up something from the desk, his body as lean and muscular as any dancer. He handed me a small item. "Jim Moriarty gave me this."
During the pandemic, uni is way messed up. Please join John for Fresher's Week (sometime before the pandemic) and we'll all live a little vicariously through him.
John was studying the game rules like it was an important legal contract.
“No, John--you are here too, there are two of us and so I am not alone.” he said, face impassive.
It was Sherlock, running towards them.
he stood up, walked away from me and tossed the gloves in the bin. "You could go to hospital for something like that."
When the doctor put his hand on his shoulder, John felt very small. He felt powerless to battle his sister's monsters, especially if she would not try.
I froze, hand on my coat. I knew at one this was a loaded statement, but I wasn't sure why. I turned back to Lestrade with what I hoped was nonchalance.
The chauffeur put his hand up in a polite refusal. “No need, sir. Will you be needing me to wait, Sir? I was supposed to ask.”
Quiet.
Yeah sure, John I
John ran outside with an idea that was probably not going to work.
There, he said it.
Lestrade drove us home. The other shocker of the evening, was Sherlock goes to the public school down the street from my university. I waited in the car, while Lestrade dropped off Sherlock and had a quick, middle-of-the-night meeting with the headmaster of his school.
Jim was surprised to see me, that's just what I wanted. I made short work of him,
"I've decided to come out alone. No one else is aware of the details of this situation but you and I." Mycroft pulled away from the kerb and they started off towards London. "Of course, you will need to explain why you felt you had to go these extreme lengths in order to get my attention."
I know other people in London, but they are dealers or know dealers, so it's best to avoid that.
Sherlock looked up to John's face, looked at his eyes, then his lips and down to John's hand, now pulling at the sleeve of his dressing gown.
John sighed, cheeks pink. Sherlock leaned against the door frame with his left hand and reached up to touch John's arm with his right hand. He could feel John's hard muscled bicep through the thin material of his new football jersey.
It's becoming impossible to spend any more time with John.
“I’m not mad--I’m
He stood up to look for his shoes, deciding immediately not to call his mum.
"Check his pupils," Mary suggested.
"Sherlock, why are we here?" I asked as we sat down at a small quiet Italian restaurant.
Angelo came over to the table, placing a candle in the middle. Sherlock snickered, and John turned red as they ordered the food and wine.
He glanced at John under his lashes over the rim of the teacup. The boy sitting across was young--about 19, Sherlock thought, but had a few worry lines on his face that should not be there. He could've avoided this scenario entirely, not offered to meet, but John did barge in to the safe house to track him down. Sherlock assumed, rather correctly, that a bloke like John would not give up too easily.
"In the posh black car?" John turned back to look again as the car pulled away.
"Well, if you change your mind, I have some nice tea and biscuits down stairs. Just knock on my door."
After an hour of trying, he gave up and sat down on a worn sofa in the lobby. Weary, he stared out the large windows that looked out on the empty street in front of the hospital, it was starting to snow. The street lamps were shining and made the snow flakes look like tiny glass crystals falling from the sky.
"John," she said gently, "Did something happen? Was there an argument?"
I didn't have many lights on in the room. "I probably have something for you to sleep in." I offered.
“Hello John.” Sherlock said.
"Just maybe...until tomorrow?" She asked him gently, looking over at Sherlock, now covered in a blanket.
The kid in the hoodie spoke as they left. "John, my offer still stands. I can explain. Meet me here," he tossed something small to John who caught it.
It was monday. I immediately got custody of Sherlock. This is ridiculous.
"Maybe the mistress was threatening him, to tell the wife? " John ventures.
He’d make a perfect target for a mugging just now. Newly arrived on campus, all the money he had to his name in his pocket. Three thugs advancing menacingly.
Still, Lestrade made Sherlock promise not to hold onto any more pieces of evidence in the future.
After getting water, I found a quiet corner to stand to watch the madness.
John could not quite lock onto Sherlock's words. He did not finish his dinner. He got up abruptly from the table and cleared his throat. "Sherlock, I need to sleep. I think I'll be better in the morning. I'm sorry."
“I’d say you’d gotten the worst of it Sherlock!!” Mike observed. “Right then, ‘night.” Mike said as he walked by shrugging, and barely gave them a glance and went straight to his room and closed his door.
He took the box off of her.
"....My father's." I touched the tags reflexively, peering up into the foam.
It takes 36 minutes from London to Chelmsford on any given day. John found an empty seat and fell asleep as soon as he sat down. He woke with a start at the Chelmsford railway station. He was home.
"Here." he handed Lestrade a photo of the professor with his arm around another woman."That's
On my way back to my residence hall, discouraged and close to giving up, I had an idea to cut through the park. It was beautiful and quiet. The snow hung on the branches of the trees about one inch thick. Of course no one was out. The park was quiet, ghostly. After the park, in a few blocks I'd be back home at uni.
“Sherlock, you look terrible.” John mentioned as he tossed his suitcase on the first available bed in a down stairs bedroom.
Sherlock cleared his throat, "I was on my way to bed,
“Mike, oh my God! Mike!” A girl shouted as a group of kids ran to his aid, Sherlock among them, crouching down to try to help him up. But to no avail, he was out. Unconscious.
He opened his eyes to look towards Sherlock's side of the bed, near the door. Sherlock was asleep, John knew. 10 years of sleeping with someone will cue you in to just those patterns. John could not see his face, but he could hear him breathing evenly, quietly, peacefully. John let his eyes linger over Sherlock's broad, well toned shoulders, his hard muscled back tapering to a slim waist. Not an ounce of fat on him, although he never exercised, well, not formally. John smiled.
Now I may not be the most observant bloke in Britain, but I knew that was a lie.
"I said,
“Hello, John.” Sherlock opened the door more broadly and John walked in.
There was no thought given to keep the water and foam away from the sound equipment. The DJ at one end of the room-- the amount of water and foam so large that there wasn't a good way to keep them apart.
John placed about 10 careful stitches with out Sherlock as much as blinking. Even though Sherlock's breathing was slow and regular, this worried John.
“What?” John asked looking up at Sherlock standing beside him.
Sherlock looked over his shoulder, "No, I saw the books in your bag under the table."
"Of course I do, I have no choice." Sherlock sighed.
But--what if he's fine?  He's not fine--he's with Jim.
"I don't have time for a concussion." Sherlock said, eyes still closed.
I expected to get reprimanded by my brother, who has been my guardian since our parents died. He and I now  have
"Please sit, Sherlock. And that's why," he pushed the mirror my way again after he did another line. "you and I would make good partners."
He took a good look at himself in the mirror while he washed his hands. The tops of his cheeks were a high pink from drinking and his black curls were an unruly mess. The top few buttons of his shirt were open and there was a slight sheen of sweat on his neck and collarbones, the club was stifling.  He buttoned a few buttons, there--that was better.
I could stay out with Mary, I could go back to my room, but Sherlock is out,
“I’m not very hungry--you can order, I’ll have a salad, maybe.” Sherlock said distractedly, tossing the menu down.
Sherlock sent him exactly 2 letters that summer and John dutifully wrote back. Sherlock's  letters were brief and polite, sparse even. Sherlock seemed to describe just being bored at home. The letters never said anything else about what Sherlock was thinking or feeling. The letters just made John confused.
"No."
My feet sped me to his side. I hesitated when I got there. Years later, when I think back to that night and memories unwillingly replay in my brain, I remember how beautiful he was. Beautiful and terrifying. For a split second that felt like an hour, I looked for breathing. I could see an almost imperceptible rise in his chest. I knelt down beside him.
We both stood up to change, I was suddenly feeling self conscious.
Even more so, John's parents had no idea the part that John and the people he knew in London played in getting Harry hurt in the first place.
I walked over to the phone again with a heavy heart and dialed.
After delivering the box to her flat,  he trotted down the stairs. Outside, standing on the pavement he said, "Irene, I never got to thank you for helping Sherlock last year-- " he left the rest of it just hanging there.
John disliked him immediately,
So far, Nothing out of the ordinary. He made a neat pile of the clothes. There was a little mud on the boots, he noted with a rueful smile. What Sherlock would think of the mud, he wondered….it was brown and ordinary as far as John was concerned. The mud from her boots did not scream out any information to him.
Then Jim turned a bit and reached up to touch Sherlock on the shoulder. John’s heart was hammering in his ears, he couldn't hear anything but a dull roar.
with Jim Moriarty and that's the biggest disaster I can think of.
‘Budget friendly student accommodation!’ the sign in the window read. This made John laugh. Large, shabby and probably poorly heated is more like it, he thought. Just then he realized he didn’t stop to get the key. He tried the doorknob, locked. He knocked softly, no answer. Bugger, how was he going to get in?
This was one of the darker pubs, dark wood paneling with nooks and crannies where there were hidden booths for conversation, still poplar with uni students. Mary was looking a the menu with 'This Terms Highlights' printed on the top.
Outside in the back alley, Sherlock grabbed a long piece of wood and wedged it into the door handle and stood in front of Irene. They should have been running. They could hear Jim just inside, screaming in rage at finding them both gone.  With a perplexed expression, Sherlock leaned over and lightly kissed Irene on the cheek and ran down the alleyway.
Three pints in, I asked him to play billiards. He said he was not much of a player, but beat me soundly,
"It'd probably be good if you did. Talk to them."
As Mary gets up from the breakfast table, John Watson, ever the physician, makes a mental note of her slowed gait and a bit of weight gain. Antipsychotics, he realizes. Side effects would cause motor slowing and weight gain. As Mary gets up from the table, she turns her head and looks up at John, meeting his eyes. John freezes. He knows Mary can’t see him, or can she? John thinks she looks at him briefly with some kind of recognition, and then she looks away, no I guess not.
Sherlock's parents are long gone. All he has is his brother. He didn't quite fill me in on the entire situation, but I do feel like I have a better sense of what's going on. I feel guilty for keeping it from Sherlock, though. So, I'm going to tell him, first chance I get.
“Sherlock, I’m placing a bucket here-- on the floor near your head. If you have to vomit, please vomit in here. Can you hear me?”
Sherlock had become quiet. He looked at Jim.
"Well yeah, my cousin Sebastian Moran, he tells me lots about you." He smiled and looked down at his feet. "It's funny, since he mentioned you, I've always wanted to meet you. Last time I gave you my number, but you didn't call."
Sherlock was laying on his stomach, head turned toward John. With his eyes closed and face relaxed in sleep, smooth skin and rosy cheeks were almost angelic John thought.
"...we'd be doing?" Sherlock added as he continued to smile and greeted the owner like they were long lost friends.
John can hear himself replying with a low moan.
I stood up and hobbled over to get my jersey, the nights were getting colder. The new brace they gave for my ankle was an improvement on the old heavy plaster cast, so I was moving faster. A bit.
he said, his voice becoming huskier.
In the toilet, he dumped his drink and planned to stop at the bar on his way back from the loo and get another. Jim could not be trusted. Maybe the drink was drugged.  Holding the highball glass up to the light, he noticed a slight oily, purple sheen at the bottom. He dipped his little finger into the remaining liquid--bitter, but not at all like alcohol. A small plan was now brewing in his imagination.
"Oh my god Jim, is he allright?" whispered Irene.
When things went badly with Victor, Mycroft was unaware until it was almost too late.
John walks through the party, the guests unaware of his presence. In the front sitting room, the one with the big Christmas tree,  John sees a very pretty woman talking to Mrs. Holmes. The woman is holding a baby girl—in a frilly Christmas dress.
And so John Watson got me drunk and seduced me in my own flat.
“I’ll say you did!” Mike said chuckling, lightening the mood, the danger passed.
I sat up and leaned on my elbows. "Yeah, but..."
"Still, why lie? You didn't talk to the police."
Well, I didn't do great with Molly. Didn't want to lie, but couldn't tell her the truth, either.
I hung up the phone and sat down on the bed. An odd turn of events, to be sure.
John turns back again to see Sherlock, of all people, on the floor, wrestling with the younger of the two boys, who is squealing and laughing and turning red. John watches Sherlock jump up from the floor with a frightened look on his face. He turns to John with an imploring look, “It’s ok Sherlock really-- you can’t hurt them that way, they are really quite sturdy at this age.” John watches himself call out.  Thus reassured, Sherlock and the younger one immediately return to the pretend wrestling match. As John watches the spectacle, he isn't sure who is having more fun, the 4 year old or Sherlock.
Once outside, I stood waiting in the shadows until the security truck pulled round the front, out of sight. Then I ran for it.
Bugger.
“Oh, the girl that he…. never mind.  Sometimes, you have to look harder…” John begins, mumbling to himself mostly, closing his eyes, breath evening out.
I turned to see who it was, my face red. My father's ID tags were under my shirt.
"The way they look at you. They both glance at you--often. They search your face, probably looking for non-verbal clues that you're interested. They look at your lips as your talking-people don't just do that unless there's some sexual interest or physical attraction. That's what people do, but it's unconscious.
There was nothing gentle about Victor. I'm afraid I don't know what gentle is.
What Mike didn’t fully expect was that Sherlock didn’t come home that night either.
As John sank into the hot water, he felt exhilarated and discouraged. He couldn’t get last night out of his mind. He wanted to stay up all night with Sherlock and never sleep. The more time he spends with Sherlock, the harder he finds it to tear himself from Sherlock’s side. He gets lost in their conversations, lost in Sherlock’s schemes, observations, and his brilliance. And now, as their relationship takes a new turn, he gets so lost in Sherlock, it frightens him.
“Right, I’m off,” Mike sighed, putting down his tea mug.
"I can. John--go get curry with Mary. If you are so worried, walk me over to school and sign me back in."
"It's simple, I was losing my mind." Honestly, while not always the best policy, is often expedient.
I wasn't afraid of them, not as much as they were afraid of me.
John hangs up the phone on the wall and leaves his hand there, lingering.
John smiles a slightly bitter smile,
I tossed my coat over the chair. "Goin' the loo." Too much beer. He didn't look up.
"Can you get back in, at school?" I nuzzled between his shoulder blades. I am awed of how muscular he is. I can feel a tingle between my legs, I backed up.
"Whatever is that?" Asks the new employee, pointing at the screen. The grainy shot that they are viewing shows a tiny black and white clip, repeated over and over. /p>
He had lost weight that he could little afford to lose. He was wearing his own pajamas, I imagined, they didn't look like hospital issue. Dressing gown over those. Fading purple bruises on the backs of his hands. He had a big dry gauze dressing on his lower neck. Mycroft told me they had taken out a large port of some kind, the kind to give IV fluids and medicines. The location of it especially stung--this was exactly where the 'love bite' was that I had given him. Seems like so long ago.
"Sherlock?"
Mary's appearance is my signal to leave. Better go before I can't walk home.
“Surely the university? Or, or my mum--my family...” John falters, voice weak.
-Bang on the door hoping some was inside to open it. No, don’t let them know you are afraid.
“No, I think we can wal—“ Sherlock started to explain that he felt Mike was steady now.
“Sherlock?” John whispered.
Where have you been? Everyone at uni is looking for you.
John steadily made his way to Baker Street. He stood on the pavement deliberating. The lights were off and the windows were dark. John walked back and forth a few times. Should he do this now? he wondered.
“Thought you’d already had a ride to school.’ Mike said, smiling. He poked John in the rib cage with his elbow.
I don't remember hitting the floor. The last thing I remember was the screaming.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
After a few blocks he saw groups of uni students moving boxes into flats.
Sherlock, cont.
John's feet felt rooted to the pavement. He was having a right properly weird afternoon. He stood looking after Molly until he felt a chill on his face and started walking towards home.
"Trip to the loo," he said in explanation, managing an innocent expression.
John looked up and raised his eye brows to question his mom.
Mary widened her eyes, "Nothing.  My treat!!"
“Come on, Johnny boy! You can’t be an old man tonight!! You don’t want to go home now! Even Mary wants to stay up! What say you all come back to mine and we can party until dawn!” Jim offered, eyes wild with plans for more fun.
“I’m sure I won't.” he said into the pillow, much too quiet for her to hear.
Finally at the flat, John took the steps two at a time to the top and stopped. He was out of breath, his heart hammering away in his chest. He would have to recover for quite a few minutes before being able to have a sensible conversation with Sherlock.
Mike had long ago disappeared into the bowels of the party and Sherlock was irritated. Under normal circumstances he would not find himself at such an event.
Mary was smiling and digging into a bag, she dragged out a smaller bag and showed it to everyone. Gold wristbands. "Queue jumpers!!" she said, holding the wrist bands high over her head.  "We get in ahead of everyone," she said, doling out a wrist band for each of us.
"Nothing," he said quietly and looked down at his feet.
"He's not currently enrolled in any university in London or in the UK, for that matter. Looks like he is a distant relative to a student at your school, Sebastian Moran."
Said Mary, rolling her eyes, disgust evident in her voice.
John wants to get good grades at uni, and get into medical school. His grades suffered last year.
hugging my arm.
My hands were shaking.
His brother-another git.
Running into John in person just made me feel sadder. I watched him as he sat down in the booth with Mary. The pub lights shone on his blond hair, I couldn't miss him sitting there. He had on those blue jeans that I like on him, that make his arse look tight. But his broad shoulders were not defined at all in that shapeless beige jumper. That jumper has to go--
She was quiet. Her back was turned to me. I could hear small sobs. Her thin shoulders shook.
Brain reeling, trying to formulate something to say, John looked up and saw movement from far down the street.
“So what if they talk? I don’t know why you care what other people think.”
Spent some time just walking the street, just gave a guess as to the direction they could have gone. It's cold, I can't imagine he'd be outside. There are several pubs near uni, they could be at any of them. I went into a few, nothing.
Remember? You're free." I raised my mug in a toast.
John was eager. They had waited so long. He tried to be restrained. Sherlock leaned further back, his hands wandering inside John's football jersey, pulling him closer. John pulled his left knee up and slightly kneeling, strained against him.
John--as opaque as he is transparent. As much time as we spend together, of course I know he has feelings for me, too. I just can't predict what direction they will take, Well, until now, of course. John has made a move.
Sherlock raises his eyebrows, "You're thinking."
"John, there you are, thought you had gone." It was Sherlock, behind him, standing in the doorway.
John went after him, throwing up his hands.
"Hey look, what I found for you!" John presented a brown paper sack to Harry. It was not pretty, but it'd do the trick, he knew.
But his path was set for this year. He had promised the football lads he'd split the rent fee.
"Sir?" The driver asked. “This is Broomfield Hospital.”
"No, I can do it," Sherlock waved John off and standing, insisted on going to the bedroom, shaky as he was. John followed. The back bedroom was large and clean with neatly made bed. Walking seemed to exhaust him and John stayed close, every once in a while putting out a hand or an arm to steady him.
This was the worst night he ever had at uni! The worst.
"While I appreciate this demonstration of affection and
John felt terribly guilty for leaving Sherlock as he took off from Baker Street towards his new place.
I moved over and sat right next to him, the edge of my right thigh touching the edge of his. His leg was warm. Our shoulders were touching.
He shrugged.  "You've been paying attention, she hasn't."
Sherlock, uncharacteristically quiet, walks over to the sofa, sits down and put his hand gently on John’s shoulder.
Sherlock gives a quiet chuckle. “Well, where did you go?” he asks, swinging his long legs over the side of the bed as he gets up to go to the loo.
john, what are you doing?  I asked again before the world went white.
“Testing the waters,” was the response from his flatmate. ”I like to put in a toe before I jump in.”
He looks over the place, the details are incredible. The color of the tents and semi permanant buildings is as vivid as he remembers. The bustle of army life in front of him, the chatter of the soildiers, brings a kind of almost nostalgia.
Temptation is everywhere these days.
Sherlock frowned. "What are you doing sitting there?"
He slowed his pace so as not to collide with students, movers, parents.
In a cold sweat, John wakes up to find Sherlock had tossed his arm over John’s chest. The sun showing tiny pink rays through the curtains. Sherlock opens his eyes and looks at John,  “Are you alright, John? You tossed and turned all night, mumbling in your sleep.”
I read all the newspapers the next day.
John broke them apart. Sherlock did so with great reluctance, resting his forehead against John's.
The shock hits John like a wave. He can feel his cheeks flush, as anger and sadness crash over him. He feels unsteady on his feet.
One of the many things Sherlock is good at, is making me forget what I was going to say. "Sherlock, I'm still worried about you." my voice strained, I wanted him so badly.   My groin was aching, but so was my heart.
He had a look on his face that I couldn't make out. Serious. Sad? He was quiet.
Luckily, these young men take their job seriously, reporting everything from the meaningful to the mundane.
someone who pushed you off a two story balcony, do you really think he's the type to feel remorse?
"Sherlock, is it? Nice to meet you. John has told me lots about you." She shook his hand with a smile as they loaded the suitcases into the boot.
"Mike, great to see you." John was smiling ear to ear.
He looked up, expression blank. "Um, no."
"Molly, I don't know a lot about Sherlock really, but I'm not sure he...he..." I was faltering.
Mary laughed again, "Well lets get you deep out of thought! Cider?"
Now that I have him in the light of my room, instead of the poor visibility of the dark street, I'm starting to see how scary he looks. He was white as a sheet, dark circles under his eyes. He's thin, gaunt, unwell.
"Maybe the mistress wanted him to marry her?"
"Yes, sir!" John Watson salutes his superior officer.
I shrugged, "School, I guess."
The boys barrel past, almost knocking into him. John side steps them before realizing he does not have to, he is not really here.
"Employed?"
"Mike, has he ever done this before?" John asked.
Not anymore.
"Sherlock, I cant, I can't stay." John's voice only a small whisper. Sherlock was now sitting in his lap, rocking slightly, his hands up John's football shirt wandering to his waistband. Sherlock gave a small moan into John's mouth. John arched his back and his head started to swim. In one minute he'd be spending the night. He wanted nothing more than to flip Sherlock over and slam him into the mattress.
“No...” Iris says, then looks toward his dad for confirmation. Sherlock stares at John, squinting, clearly still thinking. His eyes start to shift around and he’s lost to his mind palace. John can help but smirk that he knew something that even Sherlock seems to have unaware of, like when he announced that Iris was an Omega.
smarter than you think. You’re creative and bring me down to earth. You told me to observe things differently and had I taken your advice sooner Moriarty may not have fooled me so easily. You may be a ‘normal’ man, John Watson, but that’s why you are perfect for me, why we are perfect together. Because you’re
As the detective types in the answer to the puzzle onto his website, John remembers once again why he feels so attached to the Omega. It isn’t just the scent, it’s this. It’s the way his brain puts all the strange little pieces of seemingly random information to use, to help people in his own obscure way.
“I can’t see him. I’ll go round. I’ll go!” John says, headed down off the stage and toward where he thinks the assassin is. He can’t smell any scent in the area, so he relies on his eyes instead, but the flashing makes it difficult.
I would like to thank my lovely beta reader, who I have been working with to make this story the best we can make it. Thank you Bubblegum_taffy! You are so perfect and wonderful! <3
Alpha.” Sherlock says firmly, right into John’s ear.
” He feels the Prince’s insides quiver around him, the walls trying to milk him as he stays seated inside. “You’re so warm around my cock, so perfect I could keep you like this forever, plugged full of my cock in every meeting, keeping you on display for all the other Alphas to look at. Would you like that pretty Omega, would you like to sit on my knot all day?” He grips Sherlock’s hips and pulls out before ramming back in once.
. I could
“Maybe the killer was older than Carl?” John offers as a suggestion.
“John, hurts….ah…” The Prince’s face is covered in tears when John finally unlatches his jaw from that long pale neck. He had lost himself for a few minutes as his body and mind became overwhelmed in the sensations of his buried cock and blood-filled mouth. He laves his tongue over the bite, sealing it up with his saliva, the motion of it soothing the Omega and making him go boneless.
John takes a quick look and gives his details to Lestrade while Sherlock is off looking stuff up on his phone. “He’s dead about twenty-four hours – maybe a bit longer.” He looks a little closer at the face before looking at Lestrade. “Did he drown?”
“For you to admit that a little knowledge of the solar system and you’d have cleared up the fake painting a lot quicker.” Iris looks round at John, with an ‘oh shit’ kind of look on his face.
“May I?” He gestures to it.
“Oh, Sherly, you need to think more outside the box.” Jim looks so proud of himself. Out of his pocket he produces a small glass vile. “Now this little beauty…well. It’s my own invention. It took a few years to figure out but I thought, what if instead of doing something
His bed feels too large and lonely when he finally lays down. There’s only a sheet left on his bed, as he had left his comforter with Iris after they washed it all. He’s mildly cold without it, but going downstairs to ask for it feels weird. He rolls around in the bed, trying to get more comfortable, but despite how tired he is, he suddenly feels restless. Replaying everything that’s happened in the last 24 hours, questioning if this is the start of the end of his relationship with the Omegas.
. John’s cock aches between his legs, neglected as he kisses up toward his prize, the scent of slick getting headier as he goes farther. He’s excited to see up close that Sherlock is very particular about his grooming, his dark hair short and neatly trimmed, making John realize the detective might have planned for this, since with how busy they were he would have had to actually care about his own body for a moment. So, Sherlock
It doesn’t matter that they’re all alone, knotted together in a clear bond, his Alpha needs to protect that bump. His rational doctor brain would normally be smacking him on the head, telling him that no pup will come from this, but he’s not listening right now.
As always my work is completely based on fiction and I do not condone the various behaviors portrayed in it in real life, this is all just fantasy. Please feel free to point out inaccuracies and spelling errors and I will change them.
John manages an hour of sleep before he’s woken up by his phone. Mycroft is messaging him now about the missing thumb drive. The Alpha manages to get up and have a good stretch before opening the glass doors.
“Bye Uncle Lestrade.” Iris says as he passes by.
ate right after.” John says matter of fact. “Now eat your breakfast before it’s cold. Made it just for you and I will not have you leave this house until you’re done, even if I have to shove it down your throat myself.” Sherlock raises an eyebrow at that and John realizes how that could be taken. “You know what I mean.” He half smirks even as he tries to will his eyes to scold the detective. They haven’t discussed the misunderstanding since this new case and here they are…bantering?...flirting? John realizes that by making food he could once again be seen as courting and he hates that simply making food for someone else can be seen as an intimate act when he's just trying to care for them.
“Iris told me that he was making his nest and got overwhelmed by my heat scent and you watching him make the nest.” Sherlock starts.
“I thought you’re working on becoming an engineer, or something like that?”
When the knot is finally gone he pulls out of Sherlock, and is terribly turned on when he sees that none of his cum leaks out, the Omega’s body having sealed itself up. His body holding onto the seed for as long as it can. He’ll own the Omega’s womb for days and he’s going to take advantage of that as soon as he can, already wanting to caress the bump again.
“Opposites attract, I suppose.” The statement seems odd considering she knows next to nothing about him. In fact he almost ends up laughing since the first time she warned him off saying Sherlock would be the one to drop bodies, it was actually himself who killed someone, bit ironic really. Of course she didn’t know that and never would.
Once John is satisfied that Iris is clean he draws back to see his work. The little Omega’s backside is looking similar to how the Alpha left his neck, little red spots from where he nipped just a bit showing up and looking pretty on pale skin. John checks the Omega’s rim again but he’s not yet ready. The Alpha however feels like he needs to bury himself in something. His cock has been aching, jumping, and leaking this entire time and it’s driving him mad. He looks down and a grin spreads on his face as he sees his mate’s used hole right there for the taking. John sits fully on the bed and tucks his own legs under the Omega’s, so his pelvis is just the right height for his plan.
“I don’t eat when there is a case on.” Sherlock says but sits in front of the plate, eyeing it with mild interest.
“No, no,
“Yes, I’d agree.” John says looking back. “There’s quite a bit of bruising around the nose and mouth. More bruises here and here.” He says as he moves around the body.
“Sorry, what?”
“It should have been.” John says and Iris jumps forward, startled by the Alpha’s seemingly sudden appearance, though all he ends up doing is busting his head on his dad’s nose.
Sherlock refocuses quickly, giving them a full rundown about the dead man being a security guard, how he checked and one of the Hickman Gallery reported one as missing. That the man must have known something important because he’s just a regular guy, no use in having such a high profile assassin come in for something mundane. By the end of it all John is once again stunned by how amazing the detective’s mind is and when he looks even Iris is smiling proudly.
chair and when my knot finally goes down, I’m going to make you spill all that beautiful cum all over it.” The Prince moans and moves his hips, trying to find friction even though he knows they can’t separate.
“Can…can I?” Sherlock is back to being shy, a virgin no longer but still so naïve and inexperienced. His eyes are bright and wanting, a blush high on his cheek bones as he asks the question.
John gives him another squeeze, trying to reassure the young Prince that he’ll be fine, he will protect him if anything were to happen. The kid for his part breathes out a long breath and leans closer to the Alpha’s space. John knows he shouldn’t do it, but he leans over anyway taking in more of that fresh scent and whispers. “Your grace, are you alright?”
John keeps the pressure on Sherlock’s gland and laves his tongue over it, making the detective continue to squirm, hips jumping, arms clinging to him as little noises between pleasure and desperation fall from those bowed lips. After teasing him for a while longer, John finally gives the Omega a break and pulls off with a little pop and kisses the now bruised flesh. He hears the detective let out a breathy sigh and the grip on his biceps lessens a bit as Sherlock relaxes into the bed after the all the teasing. The Alpha smirks and then kisses his way back down over alabaster kiss. He wants to mark it all as
Instead, John begins grinding the base of his knot into Iris on each thrust, swiveling his hips side to side before thrusting once again. He repeats and motion, watching as each time Iris’s rim stretches a little more, swallowing him little by little. This is always his favorite part, watching himself take an Omega’s rim to it’s limit, knowing that once he slips in for the final time there is no way to get back out. Iris’s rim is getting red and looking abused like his father’s and John rumbles appreciating the erotic sight.
Iris’s head almost collides with John’s as he spasms again, causing the Alpha to back up. His head clears, letting realize he was slightly losing himself in the scents filling the room. Iris’s scent is tempting, and he can smell that his mate is aroused too, the combined scents had him licking and nipping at the teen Omega’s neck out of instinct. It’s covered in little red patches where the blood has rushed to the surface of the skin. Not enough for bruising but enough for John’s Alpha to think it’s quiet pretty, the normally pale skin blotched. He smirks and runs his tongue over it, soothing it, pulling his fingers from the pup to give him a break, now that he’s had an orgasm to abate the heat for the moment. From behind Iris he discretely licks the thick slick from his fingers, savoring the pungent flavor and trying not to moan out loud as his cock throbs in torment. He finally puts a hand on himself, covering his length and giving it a squeeze, before lightly rubbing fingers over Iris’s rim again to collect more slick. He coats his cock and just holds it, his Alpha immensely satisfied with itself as he rubs the heavily scented liquid into his own skin, coating his glands and smearing it across the head to mix with his own dripping precum. The smell of the two combine into something heady and completely new.
“First test passed, it would seem. Here’s the second.” Sherlock holds out the phone face up and the two Alphas stand up to look down on the new photo. This time instead of a fireplace it’s a car with a clearly identifiable license plate number. “It’s abandoned, wouldn’t you say?”
Everything seemed to be going so well...how did we fall so far.
to touch him, but I didn’t have permission. I apologized to him because I still did more than I should have. I should have left the flat.” John chastises himself.
“Yes. You realize we’ve hardly stopped for breath since this thing started?” Surprised the bomber let us sleep to be honest.” Iris nods his head.
“YES, so many pups. Please…please breed me, fill me so full I can’t even remember my name.” Sherlock takes his hand off the table and shoves it behind himself, grabbing John’s hair and tugging him down to drape the Alpha across his body. John still has his clothes on, and Sherlock feels a loss at not getting to feel the Alpha’s bare skin but at the same time the power imbalance arouses him further. He bares his neck to the side, exposing his scent gland, submitting to the Alpha and giving him the permission to bond with him.
, okay I did.” Jim shrugs his shoulders in an over the top way. “But the flirting’s over, Sherlock.” He starts strolling over, once again ignoring any threat Sherlock might pose. “Daddy’s had enough now!” He sing songs in a high pitched voice.
“Feeling better?” The detective says to the two of them.
lives...” John roars out. The Alpha has never gotten angry like this, he has always been calm and unassuming in his comfy sweaters, but this time he’s been pushed just that bit too far. His scent spikes in the air, dangerous and threatening enough that Iris sinks back into the couch, hiding beneath the blanket.  “Just – just so I know, do you care about that at
John watches on as Sherlock explains it all to the inspector, about how the houseboy has been ordering extra Botox for months, getting enough together so he could give Connie a fatal dose. Lestrade directs them to his office but John stops him.
“Fortunately, I
John has a slight frown on his face. Everything Sherlock is saying is true, even if he didn’t realize it before. Every time he wanted to be closer to the detective it seemed like he was pushed away and there was Iris instead. He could have had Iris from the beginning, even if he’s still unpresented it’s not like they couldn’t have done things. But they didn’t, not only because Iris feels too young for him, but because John always held back because Sherlock was who he wanted first. He would have time to pursued Iris if the younger Omega wanted later, but his chance of catching and mating Sherlock was something that felt like it had a time limit. Like if he didn’t take the chance quickly, he would be left forever never knowing what could have been.
“If your sniper pulls that trigger, Mr Moriarty, then we both go up.” John snarls into his ear, Alpha aggression growing each moment, scent permeating the air. Sherlock looks around, trying to get all the information on the situation.
He disguised himself as a reporter for a paper and got an interview with Kenny Prince, the Beta brother of dead women, Connie. He used his Alpha voice a little, putting in the dominance that others often like to follow. It got him in.
The detective answers it and is trying to get the address out of the women, Lestrade has a pen and paper ready, but both of the Alpha’s turn toward Sherlock and go still when his voice goes louder and he’s almost yelling into the phone.
“Anything for you,
“Me.” Sherlock says over his shoulder, continuing to walk away. John sighs but follows after. Iris smiles at Lestrade and catches up to John, trying not to get a foot stuck in the mud.
“This is beautiful. I love this!” Sherlock must have found what he wanted because he looks to the ceiling then comes back toward the Alphas.
Sherlock looks down at John, sees the Alpha’s eyes dart back and forth as he works his way through the information.
“I was trying to get back into your good graces.” John tilts his head to let the Omega have more access to his neck.
“Strip for me.” He growls, picking the Prince up under his thighs, and pushing him onto his legs, which wobble, causing the Omega to have to grab onto the table to steady himself. He composes himself well enough and kicks off his shoes before turning around to face John and leaning his lower back against the table. Those hooded blue eyes shoot John a look of pure want as Sherlock slowly opens his trousers and pants, shimmying them down his thin legs, letting them pool on the floor before kicking them away.
you.” He says it low and menacing. “I will burn…the
I could save her. I also knew that the bomber had given us
“Seems like I’m not doing a good enough job then.” The Alpha says before drawing back and slamming into the young Omega. It jostles both the Omega’s on the bed and Iris squeals, his rim tightening around John causing the Alpha to growl as his starts thrusting faster into the tightness, seeking his own desires that he’s been denying himself.
John tells him he doesn’t need to apologize and that he would have acted the same way if he was in the other Alpha’s shoes. It warms John’s heart to know that if anything happened to him, Lestrade would still be there to keep the pair safe. Lestrade keeps on them about how Moriarty is clearly dangerous and it takes another hour before the Alpha leaves with a new mission to get any and all information he can on Moriarty. Sherlock doesn’t think he’ll find anything and discourages him from even trying, knowing that if he looks too deep, Moriarty might just end him.
Sherlock had turned off his phone and was ignoring the world, happy to have a full and round belly as he walked around in John’s stolen bed sheet. John himself hadn’t felt much of a need for clothes these past days, content to cuddle his two best boys. They had taken to cuddling in the nest or in John’s bed, but had yet to mate again. The Omegas were both sore and there would be plenty of time later. John felt as he laid content on the cough, that it was getting to be time that they rejoin the world. But it seemed as if the world wanted to join them first.
“I don’t want to change the mood so suddenly but — where did you tell Iris to run off to?” He suddenly feels a little embarrassed to know that everyone in the nearby flats are probably awake from how loud they just were.

“You’re brother’s texting me now.” He announces to Sherlock, who’s shuffling papers with a scowl on his face. John’s not that surprised the Beta, Omega maybe…still working on that one, has gotten his number.
Sherlock yells at the woman. She backs up and opens her mouth but says nothing.
“Present yourself to me little Omega. Show me that slick
With Sherlock and John both fed, Iris sleeping, and a dirty kitchen due to John’s insistence of making breakfast, they head down to Scotland Yard to speak with Lestrade.
Sherlock steeples his hands under his chin in one of his thinking poses. He hadn’t told John about the phone call he received while he was alone in the lab. The bomber had given him an extra clue, not that he needed it, he had already seen through the Beta who owns Janus Cars, knew he was a two faced liar. But what really struck him was how the bomber said they were made for each other and alluded to the fact that they would be talking and possibly meeting soon. He’s gotten plenty of admirers over the years, from Betas like Molly’s boyfriend yesterday to Omegas like Molly herself, and now a second Alpha in the form of one John Watson, who sits looking at him for an answer to the question he asked. Sherlock fully stares at the Alpha, admiring him with his slightly greying blond hair and unassuming looks. Is it because the bomber is an Alpha that he thinks they were
“I can prep him in a different way that will help, it shouldn’t be any worse than yours.” John puts his hand on Sherlock’s face, rubbing his thumb tenderly across his mate’s cheekbone. He stares into his light eyes with as much love as possible. “I’m sorry I hurt you. If I had known about you I could have done the same thing, but at least I can do it for
“John?” His name is said in such a breathy whisper that it sparks a hot desire in his gut. He tries to ignore it, just looking at the teenager to see what he needs. His dazzling blue eyes are downcast like he feels shy, even though he’s speaking to someone he’s known more than half his life. He moves his head, so he speaks away from the Alpha’s and the whole thing is so cutely submissive that it’s digging John deeper into arousal. “Can…I sit in your lap?”
be. It’s how they got the tetanus into her system. Its paws stink of disinfectant.” John tries to defend all the hard work he just did.
“Dad. Can I lay on you? I don’t want to let go.” Iris pleads, sounding a little scared, his mask of calm slipping.
Lestrade seems confused to see the other Holmes along with them, but doesn’t comment, letting them in to see the body of the Omega, Connie Prince. They gather around the table and as much as he wants to solve the case, Sherlock can’t help but watch Iris as he gets to see his first dead body. The teen doesn’t seem grossed out at all, his eyes show a hint of sadness but he’s also already observing the body, taking in what’s happened to her.
was a mistake.” Sherlock tries to bypass John but the Alpha stops him again.
“Oh. C’mere.” He pulls Iris in for a big hug, wrapping one arm around his back and bringing the other up to tousle his messy curls. The Omega is stiff at first, not used to having any real contact with Lestrade, but he quickly melts and wraps his arms around his waist, hugging him back. His leather scent is nice, familiar but not even close to overpowering like John’s. “Good lad. You are smart, just like your father and without his bull headedness to boot. Whatever you decide, I’ll stand behind you alright.” He kisses the top of Iris’s head.
The Alpha’s pine forest scent can suddenly be smelled through the air, sour and bitter, his face one of horrified shock. Sherlock’s face turns to full confusion, the uninterested mask he had on his face breaking.
a little strong right now.” He says, blaming the Alpha when he knows the thrill of getting Iris off also contributed. He can smell that he too has been putting off scent and the three are all mixed into the air, smelling like a warm spring day.
John rushes over and helps Sherlock to his feet, which the Omega tries to brush off but the doctor in John has him checking over the detective’s head and throat for injuries. The skin is red and irritated, but he seems fine. Once he’s satisfied, Sherlock gives him his weapon back. “We should get you some lessons.” John comments, which draws an irritated scowl from the still upset Omega.
John goes up to the painting as the woman just stares at it. The Alpha can’t help but laugh out a relieved breath. “So how could it have been painted in the sixteen…forties?” He smiles at the painting, so happy that the next challenge has been completed successfully. His phone text alert goes off and it’s Mycroft again. His smile fades as he realizes he didn’t make any progress on the other case that Sherlock refuses to work on. If he solves it he wonders if the detective will be impressed with him or mad that he followed his brother’s orders.

“It’s all over the place. Haven’t you seen the posters? Dutch Old Master, supposed to have been destroyed centuries ago; now it’s turned up. Worth thirty
fine. You’re overthinking everything.” Iris steps up, crowding into John’s space, reminding the Alpha that the teen is already as tall as him. John doesn’t back up, the instinct to stand his ground always there, but he does freeze unsure what Iris is doing. The teen moves slow, tilting his head making sure they don’t touch at all, barely an inch between their chests as he leans in to press a light kiss to John’s cheek. “Go you bed John. We’ll talk about it soon.” The Omega pulls back, smiling before turning and leaving down the stairs, barely making a sound.
Without looking away, John undoes his trousers and pulls them down with his pants, just low enough for his straining erection to get some relief. Sherlock for his part stares unblinking, his eyes going round and surprised as he sees an Alpha’s cock for the first time. It’s bigger than he expected, long and thick, and deep red with arousal. His body responses by gushing out fresh slick which drips to the floor, spreading the thick scent of his heat into the already scent clouded room. John raises an eyebrow as the teenager unconsciously licks his beautiful lips looking like he wants to go for it, wants to suck John down with all his heart, but John’s the Alpha and only he gets to decide what they’re doing. But he wants to tease for just a few moments so he gives his cock a single long stroke, just to watch as the Prince’s eyes follow the movement.

be resting after the near death experience and then a false heat. The teen has been through a lot and yet he’s acting more mature about it than his years suggest.
I would like to thank my lovely new beta, who I have been working with to make this story the best we can make it. Thank you Bubblegum_taffy! <3
“Since the start. You don’t think I’d give up on a case like this just to spite my brother, do you?” Sherlock gives a half smile and turns walking away.
The question is so strange that John almost laughs, forgetting his surroundings completely, but he somehow manages to hold his tongue. Barely nodding to the Omega, he receives a small half hidden smile and Sherlock slowly gets up from his seat and shuffles over to John, before lightly perching himself on the Alpha’s lap, the curve of his ass settling right against the Minister’s groin. John shivers at the contact as he feels the warmth of the smaller body press up against him. The change in scent is noticeable as the Omega relaxes, tipping his body back to rest it against John as if the Alpha was his own personal high-backed chair, and what John wouldn’t give to be the only thing Sherlock ever sits on again.
“John, this is doctor Evans.” The familiar voice of the Beta doctor is a surprise to John, he expected one of the desk clerks.
As always, please let me know what you think by adding a comment and I will do my best to get back to everyone. Thanks for reading! <3
John levels the two of them with a look that says he’s serious. “No – has it occurred to you that the bomber’s playing a game with you? The envelope; breaking into the other flat; the dead kid’s shoes – it’s all meant for
“A-AH.” Sherlock pants out as he moves his hand down to grip his neglected cock. But John feels him do it and knocks his hand away, instead gripping the Omega’s length himself.
“Remember the shoelaces?” Sherlock says getting up and hurriedly going round the table to where all the pieces of the disassembled shoes have been hung up. Iris has finally moved, coming back online and immediately shoving the entire sandwich in his mouth before turning around to watch his dad explain everything about the poison and the cream. John watches and does his best to follow along, asking appropriate questions and even correctly answering Sherlock’s lead in questions.
“Is it him, then? Moriarty?” John remembers how Sherlock told him about the cabbie’s final word. The name behind the seemingly senseless killings. With the pink phone having returned, and the strange nature of the first two puzzles, the Alpha couldn’t help but connect it to the mysterious hidden man.
I would like to point out to those who have expressed a dislike for my interpretation of the characters, that Sherlock is an Omega by gender but he is actually a switch in terms of sexual preference. For John, he is an Alpha by gender and dominate by preference, but is conflicted due to Sherlock saying he doesn't want a mate and Iris being young.
that he knew him. The bomber’s iPhone was in stationery from the Czech Republic. First hostage from Cornwall; the second from London; the third from Yorkshire, judging by her accent. What’s he doing? Working his way round the world? Showing off? ” Sherlock runs his hands through his hair.
The Omega whines and tilts his neck, presenting it for John, indicating it’s almost time, that he’s getting close to his climax. The Alpha tightens his fist on Sherlock’s cock and licks over his scent gland, sealing his lips over it as he continues to shallowly thrust and grind his knot against his insides.
When he’s finally satisfied that the new bond mark is sealed John kisses Sherlock’s cheek. “How are you doing Love?” He says, voice a little rough from all the growling he was probably doing without realizing it.
“Are you okay?” John finally gets to ask as his brain starts to come back online. After grabbing a hold of Moriarty he had lost himself for a moment as his instincts took over, though he feels like he maintained composure well enough.
have to go back there again. You are
“Just so.” Jim says, stopping.
“Yes, all standard I hope.” John tries to sound casual, but inside his chest, his heart is pounding against his ribs.
“What’s brilliant? What is?” John shouts.
“John — you — didn’t mate me? And your knot really hurt.” Sherlock looks upset and John feels terrible because he knows why it hurt but didn’t know if would happen before it was too late.
I think the other reason this chapter has taken so long is that I'm unhappy with it because the conversations between the characters include a lot of conflict and I am someone who avoids conflict and to write it feels difficult. I also feel like I never have the characters say or do enough, like I want them to say too many different explanations and add too much detail. Then I try to dial myself back and it feels so stilted sometimes. I'll continue to work toward improving. Thank you all for continuing to follow along. <3
“Desperate are we now.” John growls out, his smirk even wider now. Sherlock’s body fights against him, trying to fall back down so he can do it again, but John is too strong, easily holding on as Sherlock just barely manages to rock his hips for a minuscule amount of slide.
“Yes Baby. Fill you up as full as you want. Whenever you want.” John growls and as Iris moans he tips over the edge, a crack of lighting up his spine and John dumps cum into Iris, thick ropes of it pouring from his aching tip, swelling the teen’s normally flat belly even further.
He had done the same thing to Sherlock and now the sneaky Omega was turning it back on him. He whines and pulls back on the knot, trying to get away from the oversensitivity but Iris whines and he holds still instead not wanting to hurt him.
Twenty minutes later they’re being invited into West’s flat, by his fiancée Lucy, an Omega that smells of cinnamon and who is obviously distressed. The smell of burnt cinnamon can be smelled heavily as they go to sit on her couch. John wants to comfort her, a natural Alpha instinct, but he refrains. She makes them all tea and Iris snoops around the place as quietly as possible, looking for clues. Once they get settled in she finally talks, assuring John that Westie was a good man and that he would never betray his country. Behind her Iris nods that he believes she’s telling the truth.
“Alpha, please.” Iris’s voice comes out and it doesn’t sound like his Omega, even if the words seem like it would be. “I want more. Give me more.” He pleads and John isn’t one to deny the Omega’s anything. He grinds faster and harder, as Sherlock puts more pressure onto his tip, rubbing over Iris’s belly.
“Why do you smell like — like a virgin Omega in heat? Wait —” John goes rigid, his whole body in shock as he remembers the smell of flowers, the smell Iris was just starting to put off as his body was beginning to present. But he’s still months away from that happening, the smell barely thre, noticeable only when the teen was in a deep state of arousal and false heat.
my pup and I’m sorry I didn’t trust
“Novel.” Sherlock sighs out breathily, his eyes staring at John still but no longer seeing him. Clearly seeing something in his mind instead of what’s sitting in front of him. John studies his face for a moment but looks away mildly disgusted, turning his attention back to the muted television.
“You alright pup.” The older Omega says, looking up at his son who hovers above him. The teen is making little thrusts with his hips, rubbing them together, his instincts pushing him without him noticing. Iris licks his lips and stares down at his dad. He parts his cupid’s bow and lowers himself down onto his elbows, his lips just above Sherlock’s. Closing his eyes, he waits there for a moment before closing the small gap, kissing his dad.
question that has been on his mind this whole time. Motive. “If this woman’s death was suspicious, why point it out?” Lestrade walks over to where Sherlock has stopped, coming up behind him.
“Carl Powers!” Sherlock tries again.
“Now, baby boy, what do we say when we’ve been bad?” The Alpha runs his hands up Sherlocks inner thigh, the marks from earlier still visible, as he gathers the slick on his hand, then licks it from his fingers, admiring the fragrance.
“SAY THAT AGAIN!” Moriarty yells into the phone. “Say that again, and know that if you’re lying to me, I will find you and I will
to try and trap you, he — sob — he was trying to get you to mate Iris.” Sherlock once again tries to push on John, clearly trying to get the Alpha away from where Iris is up in the bedroom, afraid that John’s Alpha will come out and try to get to the young Omega. “You need to leave, we can’t let you smell him anymore, I need to get stuff to break the heat, I didn’t get
“But — but what about everything that happened with Iris, you can’t just say yes to me without talking about what
“Ah. But that’s where you’re wrong.”
“I’ll pick you up and sit you on my knot, then call him in. Imagine how pretty his lips will be wrapped around you.” He squeezes Sherlock’s length in his hand, letting him picture it as Iris.
As always, please let me know what you think by adding a comment. I hope you enjoyed. I certainly enjoyed writing it.
“Well, this one was quite simple, actually, and like I said, the bomber repeated himself.
“How long have you known?” John says more firmly.
“Thank you Uncle. And thank you for all the times you had to look after me all these years. Buying me ice cream and taking me home.”
The pup whines at the loss but groans prettily in embarrassment when he’s gaping open, greedy hole on full display for the Alpha. His hole tries to clench shut but John just forces it open wider, prompting Iris to shove his head into his father’s neck. If he can’t hide his hole he’ll at least hide his face.
“Hey pup. How are you feeling?” Sherlock questions, observing Iris’s face for anything and everything.
“Five pips, remember, John? It’s a countdown. We’ve only had four.”
Oh, you all thought this was going to end with heat sex, guess again! We still have yet to meet the mysterious Moriarty and discover his plans for the Alpha and Omegas.
“Sherlock!” Lestrade yells, his Alpha voice letting loose, causing the lady to back away scared, but Sherlock just takes the phone from John without a care for the inspector.
“Wish I’d known what we were doing, would have brought ‘backup’.” John states. To which Sherlock turns around to face him once again, pulling John’s pistol from his coat pocket. The Alpha looks at it for a moment and smiles, though the scarf hides most of it, but Sherlock nods at the acknowledgement of his forward thinking.
“We’ll talk, just not now.” Sherlock rolls his hips and John can feel the beginning of the detective’s arousal against his belly, his own which he had been trying to ignore stirs at the sensual motion.
“People don’t like telling you things, but they love to contradict you. Past tense, did you notice?” Sherlock takes off his gloves as he walks in long strides.
The Lord Alphas had begun to get aggressive as John looks back to the table, two men baring their teeth, both half on the table as they try to get into each other’s face. John stands, rumbling a deep growl in his chest to warn the Alphas that they’re overstepping their authority. They both look to him and back down, as John’s aggressive pheromones permeate the air, letting the older Lords know he means business. They know the sword by his side has cut down many men at the hands of the Chief Minister, as he had not gained that title by his intellect alone, but his steadfast swordsmanship and battle planning at the side of the King. His shoulder injury had been a large part of why he was now Chief Minister, as he could still cut a man down but prolonged battles were another matter, and the King found him perfectly suited to intimidate and keep his Lords in their proper places while he was gone.
“I brought you your comforter. Thought you might want it…” Iris holds it out, still not stepping into his room. He has his head down, looking at the floor instead of at John.
Sherlock’s and Iris have stopped kissing, the two Omega’s gripping onto each other now, both panting and moaning as their Alpha pleasures them. John determines Iris is ready when the resistance on his four fingers no longer feel like it’s cutting off his circulation. He pulls out of Sherlock, dripping in his mates slick and positions himself at the teen’s pink entrance. He does that same thing to Iris as he had to Sherlock, smoothing his tip along the rim. His swollen head slips inside easier than it did for Sherlock, the extra prep and the better position already helping. He slides in a few inches, his thicker shaft stretching the pup’s rim wider than his fingers. Iris’s back arches instinct to present himself to the Alpha clearly more prominent than in his father. John pulls out, but rewards this behavior by grasping both cheeks and massaging them with his large hands, digging fingers into soft flesh. He pulls them apart and watches as Iris’s rim gapes a little and a trail of slick dribbles down onto Sherlock below.
“Don’t hide. You’re very pretty.” John grins a little wickedly, enjoying the virgin like behavior that Iris doesn’t even know he’s showing. It’s cute and the Alpha hopes he stays like this, wouldn’t mind switching between the two personalities of Iris and Sherlock sometimes.
” He turns around, trying to catch a glimpse of a camera or a person. Behind him he hears a door creek open and when he turns, the last person he thought he would ever see steps out of the door.
“I know this isn’t how any of us probably imagined our first time together happening, but I’ll do my best.” John assures him.
“Hey. Ah. Sorry.” He takes his hand off Sherlock’s stomach, scolding his Alpha for being so weirdly creepy about filling the Omega with pups.
“Connie and Kenny. Siblings, together…like....” Sherlock raises his eyebrow, knowing that John is implying that they were like him and his son. Together, even though they shouldn’t have been.
“Is that so?”
“And you find that easy, do you?” John’s eyes narrow.
They both slump back down, panting together, both falling into a light doze, their bodies exhausted from the strain. Sherlock purrs as he relaxes back into John’s warm body, the Alpha keeping his arms locked around the teen’s body, possessive and protecting. They wait together for John’s knot to finally release, a first knot for a new bonding lasting longer than any other they will ever share.
“Who are you?” Sherlock tries. “What’s that noise?” John stays quiet, but he can’t hear anything on the other side of the phone and Sherlock has stopped breathing to listen. After less than a minute, Sherlock lowers the phone, having said nothing more. Just the tenseness of his shoulders says he isn’t happy about what he heard on the other side of the line.
“You said I needed to break the virgin scent or you would accidentally mate him. You told me that right after our first case.” Sherlock says staring right back at the Alpha, looking into deep blue eyes to find out why John would have said it was the only way.
“Come in.” John gets up, confused as to why Iris would be up here.
“Must have been. The only question is, how did the tetanus enter the dead woman’s system?” They all look at the dead women once more, but Sherlock doubts they will get the answer here. “You want to help, right?” The detective directs his question at John.
was young. But when he looks over at John he is reassured that this will be nothing like his first time because the Alpha is lightly stroking Iris’s back, soothing him gently, not aggressive or forceful in the slightest. Just the caring doctor John he’s come to trust.
“Yeah.” John says breathlessly. “You want me to fill
knot.
“Sherlock, Love, calm down. Tell me what happened,
“Isn’t it?” Moriarty says, smiling to the point he closes his eyes looking proud. “No-one ever gets to me – and no-one ever will.” The cheerful expression falls just as suddenly as it had appeared with the compliment. The man before Sherlock ever changing.
John sits down with his own plate of food, he has a feeling that the mysterious bomber isn’t going to let up for long and he’s going to need all the strength he can get as he chases Sherlock around. Surprisingly, the detective says no more but instead picks up his fork and takes a bite of the eggs. He tastes them, then nods his head in approval before digging in more enthusiastically, which really just means he puts a little more on each forkful than he did on the first assessment bite.
“Didn’t mean it as a compliment.”
.” The detective under him is shaking and shivering, mewling as his hole tightens rhythmically on John’s length, his body desperate to finish them body. It’s only a few more strokes of John’s hand and Sherlock’s body goes ridged as he finally comes, his small Omega cock pulsing in John’s palm, coating him in hot clear liquid.
The Alpha gives one final shove, aggressively pulling the Omega back, digging his hands into the alabaster flesh and seating him fully on his knot, slipping in to sit in that tight warm virgin hole.
“And…” John feels a little lost for words having Sherlock’s intense gaze on him.
“Well, it
John stops and turns around eyeing her smiling widely, like she’s won something. The disgusting smirk telling him that she thinks herself superior to himself and Sherlock, as if her being ‘normal’ makes her a better person. He squares his jaw and sharpens his eyes, his scent spiking before walking back toward her. She’s actually just a bit taller than him as he gets up in her space, but as soon as her and the other officer’s noses pick up his overpowering scent their heads bow to the Alpha.
“Gotcha!” Jim says, his sing song voice back for a moment. John lets him go, backing up several feet with his hands in the air. He’s not willing to risk Sherlock’s life but was willing to give up his own. If they weren’t in a dangerous situation the detective might just wrap him in a hug and scent him until he can’t tell who smells of who more.
He sighs heavily. “No, we’re not—” He wishes but she doesn’t need to know that either.
I could make Omegas stop having heats.” He grins like the Cheshire cat. “A one time dose of this and an Omega will never have another heat the rest of their lives. Rendering them as useless to mating as a common Beta. Or in the case of a male Omega like you, completely sterile.”
The mysterious bomber continues on with his plans...
“John.” Sherlock says across the room, answering his own phone. Iris listens, hoping John is coming home so he can erase some of Lestrade’s scent. “I’ll remember.” Sherlock listens intently to the phone for a few minutes, then rushes to their room, bringing with him a camera.
“Consulting criminal…brilliant.” Sherlock says softly. John stares at the floor barely breathing. He hates the way Moriarty is speaking to Sherlock, it sounds too calm, too much like he’s enjoying himself.
“Moriarty — sob — Moriarty laid a TRAP!” John’s blood runs cold and then hot as his Alpha’s anger rages in his chest at the name of that monster.
“No, but I’m not the world’s only consulting detective.”
“Knew it was dangerous.” John says offhandedly.
“No. I need you two to find out all you can about the gallery attendant. Lestrade will give you the address.” They both nod and the taxi is on it’s way again as John calls Lestrade. As they ride along, Iris takes John’s hand and holds it but doesn’t say anything. John lets him and even tightens the grip.
“What did he DO?! Tell me! What happened?” He pulls Sherlock away looking into his mate’s face, searching for answers. But the Omega’s eyes only convey sadness as the tears start to stream down his face.
Back at the flat, it’s late but Iris is curled up in John’s chair waiting for them. It’s obvious from their demeanor that something bad happened. Sherlock hangs up his coat and scarf, immediately heading to their room and closing the door, lightly. Iris watches him go but stays waiting for John instead. The Alpha kicks off his shoes, hangs up his coat, and goes to the fridge. He isn’t normally one to drink, but he grabs a beer and heads back to the sitting room. He intended to go to his room, thinking Iris would be asleep, but instead he sits on the couch because Iris has moved to it and is clearly hoping he will stay.
The Alpha groans and Sherlock’s eye light up in mischief, his teasing payback for what John did to him, stopping and starting again during their mating, making him beg and whine. John gets one good thought in about how both Omegas will fit his knot before Sherlock is talking again.
“Take me now, just like him. Want it again.” Sherlock begs, his cock bobbing between them, red and angry at being denied for so long.
His dark curls bounce, pale skin shimmering in the light from the street lamp outside. He looks like perfection and time slows as John admires him. Admires the creature he’s desired and is now taking as his own with reckless abandon. He’s beautiful, inside and out, he’s all that John wants and the Alpha is determined to keep him forever.
“I did, I
The Omega’s go into deduction mode, Sherlock with his gloves searches the body, squatting down with his magnifier as Iris follows along. When he’s finished he gives a head tilt to John, telling him to do his own analysis and John looks to Lestrade for permission. While in the past it might be seen as bad to ask another Alpha for permission, the two of them have a good understanding of each other, gone are the days of them squaring off against each other. Lestrade just sweeps his hand out with a little bow, wordlessly giving him the go-ahead.
-----
When the detective puts down the phone, he shakes his head, signaling that he got no answer to his question. They all look back to the television, to see the last bits of the lady and her show, before the news pops up talking about the sudden death of the TV personality.
“Presumably you have three more to solve.” John says after they finish. “What’d you think will happen after you solve them?”
As always, please let me know what you think by adding a comment. I hope you enjoyed. I enjoyed writing it.
In the taxi as the sun goes down, Iris holds his hand again until they’re pulling up outside the flat. It seems to be perfect timing as John can see Sherlock come out the front door as they are pulling up. He pays and steps out of the cab, rushing up to Sherlock, getting so close he actually gets a tad nervous for a moment being so close he can smell the detective. “Alex Woodbridge didn’t know anything special about art.” He announces.
Sherlock and John have their talk, a murderer is on the lose and John learns more about the clinics...
Heyo everyone! I am back after two months gone, I know it was a long time but I have reasons and I am finally here with the last chapter of Double Down. I know I know, you and I both don't want the story to end but this was the original ending point and I'm sticking to it. I have many other stories to write about Sherlock and John's adventures that I need to start on, so this has to be the end. I also have a real book that I am working on and this story was my test to prove to myself that I could write something that was long enough to be considered a decent sized book and while the writing style may not be the best, I am overall pretty proud that I finished the project and it's not too bad of writing for a first time.
“Iris gave me back my comforter. I leant it to him. Didn’t have time to wash it. Bit too tired, really.” To be honest, he had intended to shower this morning, but Iris told him to not overthink and he spent so much time this morning overthinking his own potential death that he wanted to keep the scent as long as possible.
“It’s Babies first time, I don’t want him to be uncomfortable.” John protests but his breathing becomes more labored as Sherlock continues to rub over the head and he pushes in deeper and the sensation, rocking his hips in time to Sherlock’s rhythm.
“Love. You are still affected by the heat run and our mating, you’re not yourself yet. Just relax. We need to check on Iris now. I’m sure he’s been hurting and we need to be there for him.” John is trying to keep himself as calm as possible. His Alpha wants to rip Moriarty’s throat out with his own damn teeth. The master criminal clearly has well thought out plans and ways to get to them that he would never think of in a million years, but he can’t concentrate on that now. Iris is in heat and has been that way for a lot longer than necessary. They won’t have time to track down something synthetic to break the heat, not this late at night. John knows he’ll have to do what he’s been avoiding. He’ll have to take Iris’s virginity.
“Have you given Mycroft the memory stick yet?”
“Don’t be silly. Someone else is holding the rifle. I don’t like getting my hands dirty.” Moriarty hasn’t removed his hands from his pockets and it sets Sherlock on edge. “I’ve given you a glimpse, Sherlock, just a teensy glimpse of what I’ve got going on out there in the big bad world. I’m a specialist, you see...” Moriarty’s face changes through multiple expressions in an instant before it lands on something like surprise, his eyes wide as he stares at Sherlock. “Like you!”
(See the end of the chapter for
John hears the door click as Sherlock leaves and makes his way out with a nod to the Beta woman.
try to convince you but ...” He scoffs to himself. “everything I have to say has already crossed your mind!”
As predicted, none of the Alphas notice the fresh pheromones but John watches as Sherlock’s eyes become hooded and filled with lust. Sitting closest the Omega got the full force of John’s scent and like many times in the past, he was drawn to it. Sherlock had amazing control around Alphas, seemed to dislike all of them, especially those who showed off during jousting tournaments and tried dancing with him during balls. But it was different with John, the Omega would follow him and ask for additional lessons or simply to eat by his side. When his heats came, Sherlock had always clung to and begged the Alpha to mate him, never asking for another, always whimpering John’s name whist the man himself stood guard outside the door.
-----
Sherlock practically screams at the touch, his back arching, and his cock spurting his first hot release untouched between the legs of the table. He pants out heavy breathes mixed with garbled words as he tries to form a sentence but fails to say anything. John only gives him a moment before he dives right in, digging his tongue as far into the wet hole as he can get, lapping at the delicious slick, letting it slide down his chin when he sucks at the rim. His own cock aches as he swallows mouthfuls of the Omega’s sweet essence, never letting up for a moment, making sure the Prince’s body is truly ready for him.
“Oh, let me guess: I get killed.” Sherlock says it in his most bored tone but it eats at John to know that his answer is most definitely correct.
“Hmm? When?” Curious that someone would break in the night the man is murdered.
Sherlock’s stomach muscles jump and his cock throbs in the Alpha’s hand, he’s getting close but John wants him to come while knotted on his cock, not from his hand, so he stops and wraps his arm around the Omega’s hips. Before Sherlock can protest John pushes his body back down to the bed, pressing in deep before drawing back out and starting his rhythm back up. His knot begins to grow now with each push into the Omega’s body, his Alpha waiting no longer, his own body ready to make Sherlock his.
“Getting you into crap telly.” He says, making Iris laugh loudly. John smiles at them both, neither of them seeing him. He likes this, this calm atmosphere as the two Omegas he’s smitten with enjoy themselves. The glass may be broken in the window, Sherlock and he might not have resolved their issues yet, but they both smell like him and he smells like them. It just makes his heart sink to think he could lose it. But Sherlock has been acting more normal around him again, he didn’t wash the scarf before putting it back on, letting him be essentially scented again, though not by direct contact, so it seems for the moment like they’ll get back on track. It may take some extra time, but he feels hopeful.
John doesn’t move for a while, panting into Iris’s back, gasping for breath. He regrets looking away from Sherlock because when he locks eyes with him, Omega’s bedroom eyes haven’t faded, if anything they’re so incredibly intense he wishes he could jump back on his mate and make those eye close again in extasy.

The pink phone, which has become a constant object in their life, never more than a foot away from the detective, chimes with a message alert. Sherlock had barely taken his eyes off it since he placed it on the table top, his fingers tapping the table, itching to get the next puzzle. He quickly unlocks the phone and a series of pips can be heard, along with a picture of an old blonde woman who is smiling. Sherlock let’s Iris take a look but then flips the phone around to John.
“Oh.” Iris groans when John withdraws to just the tip. He moves his hands off of Iris’s plush ass and instead wraps them around his tiny waist, his fingers almost able to touch each other with how thin the little Omega is.
“I’ve disappointed you.” The detective can tell that John is unhappy with everything that has been going on. Their budding relationship in shambles yet that seems to be both because John seems to have put him on a pedestal while Sherlock has always known he doesn’t deserve that type of attention, for many reasons. He’s not that good of a person, and he thought he had shown that to John.
? We’re one up on him!” Sherlock says it enthusiastically and it makes sense in John’s mind that Sherlock would be trying to think ahead and outsmart the bomber. But the way he says it still makes John grit his teeth before letting Sherlock pass into Lestrade’s office. John pauses and grabs a paper cup of water from the water cooler. His emotions are all over the place, he wants to be happy one minute and angry the next, and it’s getting harder to control with these cases. You would think he would be getting used to it now, it’s just the way Sherlock makes him feel, but it’s so much worse because he won’t open up right now, right when they were getting somewhere.
out of you.” Moriarty’s eyes go wide, a sneer heard in his words.
“YES!” Sherlock keens beneath him, his back going rigid as he’s knotted for the first time, the pain out weighted by the pleasure as he feels his Alpha’s knot inflating and locking them together. It pushes against his prostate as it grows, sparking hot licks of pleasure down his backside and into his balls. When he feels John start to rock and grind his cock deeper into him, he’s lost, coming again, shooting all over the floor, completely untouched.
“True.” Sherlock says and John can hear the smile in his voice. John closes the laptop, he’s nowhere close to finishing the work but he discovered earlier that his bottle of CLP was missing and he really wanted to clean his pistol tonight since it got fired. He found a place only a few blocks down the road that if he hurries will still be open.
“Well, obviously I lost that round – although technically I did solve the case.” Sherlock says, his jaw clenched as he angrily tries to mute the television. He gets it eventually, letting his arm drop to the chair, clearly upset. John wants it to be because of the woman dying but Sherlock’s words make him seem more upset about the case going south. The Alpha looks over toward the detective as he just stares into the wall.
“Of course.”
“But we both know that’s not
“No, wait, wait. Wait a second.” The detective stops and turns back around. “What about the disinfectant, then, on the cat’s claws?” Clearly John isn’t believing him fully.
“I’ve shown you what I can do. I’ve shown both of you what I can do. Isn’t that right Johnny boy.” John closes his eyes and lets out a slow breath. Sherlock’s eyes flicker to him, wondering what exactly Moriarty did in between abducting John and them arriving here. “I like solving people’s problems, I’m willing to pay thirty million quid just to get you to come out and play with me.” Jim reaches John, standing just behind him. “You see, my favorite crime is one that millions of people want all over the world.” He looks at Sherlock expectantly.
“What about art? Did he know anything about that?” John asks, trying to get a feel for Alex.
“Tell me what?” Sherlock questions, though he relaxes a little as John kisses him, feeling that the Alpha is truly sorry for whatever just happened.
could have got them anywhere.” He flashes a maniacal grin.
“Sherlock. He’s really hot. He’s going to take longer to prep than you did, so we’ll need to cool him down a bit or he’ll overheat before he’s ready.” John’s doctor side is weirdly attractive in this moment but the detective tries not to concentrate on that.
“What?”
Also, if anyone finds my Beta reader, let her know I said hi because she has disappeared and so everything for the last several months is not Beta read.
Sherlock slowly pulls the phone away from his face, staring dead ahead, the dial tone can be heard in the room. Both Alpha’s look away, knowing that it had all gone wrong. Despite how the Omega could almost always hide his feelings, never letting them show with his scent, it was too abrupt and his scent sours , rotting grass instead of lush meadow. John isn’t sure if he wants to know why Sherlock is upset, still mad at the detective for leaving the women stranded for hours, even if he might have had a good reason to do so.
As John pulls back from the kiss, his eyes connect with Sherlock’s for the briefest moment and he smiles, but the Omega is too overwhelmed and arches his back as John slips most of the way out and gives a full thrust, the Alpha himself moaning as he sinks fully into Sherlock for the first time. His vision goes fuzzy at the sensations now assaulting his cock as he keeps himself buried to the hilt, Sherlock’s insides massaging and pulling at him from all sides, slick coating him and starting to run down along one of his balls.

“Nothing. All the living classmates check out spotless. No connection.”
really been accepted, that this isn’t just a rash decision on both of their parts.
“Alright, on your side, careful now.” John says as he picks up Iris and they all maneuver themselves so that John is spooning Iris while he waits for the knot to release. He buries has face into Iris’s neck, smelling fresh flowers and listening as the two Omega’s continue kissing.
Food arrives and scarfing it down would be the most satisfying thing about this day, if not for the few sips of tea he sees Sherlock manage to drink. Iris is off to the side, daintily eating his own breakfast of French toast, syrup dripping off each piece. He almost wants to ask if Iris would be content with just drinking the syrup, there’s so much of it.
“I could make them do anything you want; would you like me to make the other Alphas kneel to lick your slick from my knot?” He pulls out and grinds back in, roughing dragging his nails along Sherlock’s back, leaving trails of angry red across beautiful skin. Sherlock arches into the touch, moaning at the thought of John controlling the Alphas, making them do whatever
“Think you’re being funny, yeah?” He growls out lowly.
“Alpha’s here Baby, you’re doing so well, so good for me.” John doesn’t want to go too hard too fast but with the positive feedback he pulls his fingers out and shoves three back in, rubbing Iris’s insides with vigor. He quickly locates the teen’s prostate and circles around it, occasionally rubbing over the nub but not yet giving it his full attention. He needs to press against Iris’s walls, get them to open up, to lightly break so that it doesn’t hurt as much when John knots his virginity away.
“Revenge? Who wanted revenge?”
Sherlock moans underneath him and the Alpha knows he’s got him. He looks quickly to the sleeping Iris who is snuggled up on the other side. He lower’s himself so he can talk right in Sherlock’s ear.
“You should go check on Iris.” John says. He can only wonder what the little Omega got up to while having completely free access to his bed covered in Alpha scent. If the teen hadn’t wanked himself into a coma by now, he’d be genuinely surprised. The Alpha smirks at the thought of a satisfied Iris nesting in his bed after getting off on his scent. He might just have a late night wank himself once he’s in his own covers. As much as he would like to sleep in the Omega’s nest tonight, he doesn’t want to overstep his bounds and there will be plenty of time for that later.
John looks up and finds that Sherlock is staring at him with a grin on his face. The detective has always known the best ways to mess with him and he continues doing just that by turning his head to lick at Iris’s scent gland, causing the little Omega’s body to clench around John’s cock stuffed inside.
Chief minister John sits upon the King's chair in the war room, a giant wooden table laid out in front of him with dozens of maps, wooden carved figurines, and tents showing the placement of the various armies that have spread out across the kingdom’s vast lands. The King and his first-born son Mycroft left two months ago with countless men, to drive the invaders back from where they came. The current assembly of lords in front of him are arguing over who will continue to fight if the King’s men fail in their mission and while he would normally assert himself over the men he knows that the Alphas in front of him haven’t gotten their aggression out in so long that letting them wear themselves out in this argument will benefit him for when he finally speaks.
John leans up, bending Sherlock’s back and forcing his head to the side, he scrapes his teeth over the teen’s neck and the Omega moans loudly, his body once again clenching around the Alpha’s cock locked inside him. “All mine.” He rumbles before biting into the Omega’s scent gland, breaking the skin and flooding his mouth with his mate’s pure scent. Sherlock screams below him, the pain from the bite strange and foreign to a royal born Omega, who only knows pleasure in life.
“John.” Sherlock tries to start but his breathing is becoming pitched as he huffs out strained breathes, his body is wracked with a deep shiver, his whole being vibrating as it tries to clench around something, his body upset that it’s still empty in the presence of an Alpha. It causes the youth to moan out pained with the need to be filled. His body preparing itself to be breed, opening itself up and grasping for a knot that isn’t there. “John please. You…you said if I was g-good.” The Omega whines and wiggles his hips, trying to tempt the Alpha with his slender frame.
“I’ll be back. John thinks he might have an answer.” He kisses Iris on the top of the head and rushes out, leaving the two alone. Lestrade doesn’t really seem to notice that it’s just them, still staring at the information on the wall.
in that moment. I thought I knew everything from a single look, but as I tried to tell you that very next day, sometimes you need a second look at the evidence.” Sherlock smiles and John looks at him in awe.
“Yours…yours….t-take me. Mate me…Knot me…” With each pound of John’s cock, the Omega’s own erection leaks precum down onto the floor, dribbling out as it bounces around untouched. Sherlock’s not sure he wants it touched, the overwhelming sensations of John inside him already sending him to heaven, unsure where he would end up if the Alpha did more.
“You’re enjoying this, aren’t you? Joining the...dots.” The old woman’s voice is harsh and frightened. She sobs as she tries to get out the words. “Three hours: boom...boom.” Her sobbing gets louder before the phone cuts out.
Sherlock is caught between the desire to get John to grind against him, to give him the friction against his bulge he wants even though they’re still clothed, or to wiggle his ass down into the bed, to get pressure against his clenching hole. He grumbles a little frustrated, hands kneading at the Alpha’s broad shoulders. When John wraps his whole mouth around his scent gland, teeth applying pressure without the warning lick, Sherlock’s body decides for him, his hips bucking up as he clutches desperately to John. But the Alpha’s hips are too high up and Sherlock lets out a needy whine when he gets no pleasure for his movements, his body trembling with want, his Omega’s yearning for the Alpha pushing him to submit in any way possible to get the Alpha to mate him.
“Wait, what’s John doing here?” Iris sounds panicked and John feels bad because upsetting the little Omega is the last thing he would want to do.
his. His Alpha chanting a mantra of mine mine mine in his head as he leans forward and gets a lung full of the Omega’s meadow grass scent right from his neck. He longs to rub his face into Sherlock’s scent gland, bite into it and leave his mark for all other Alphas to see. Just the thought makes blood rush down, erection half formed unbidden beneath the little Omega’s hips.
many Professor Cairns in the book. Come on.” They run out to the main road, John dropping the scarf down to breathe the fresher air, while Sherlock looks up the name on his phone.
“I-I’m sorry, Alpha.” Sherlock says, his voice so small. A tiny sniffle coming out right after.
“I’d better get my feelers out for this Golem character.” Lestrade says, back in police mode.
The back door of my building was locked, of course, I presented myself at the front door, planning on throwing myself on the mercy of the floor warden at the front desk. It was cold. They let me in without comment, not asking for an explanation. I'm sure I was reported as missing last night.
Mary wrapped her hand around John's arm and looked pleadingly into his eyes. She wanted him to say yes.
I squinted at my photo  plastered on the front page. Several front pages, actually. There was really no way to tell it was me. It was dark. I was wearing dark clothes, my face turned away from the camera.
I slapped him on the shoulder and he flinched. "Pub's close. I wont take 'no' for an answer. Let's go." I smiled. I could see some doubt on his face.
“Some experiment, I was ready to beat the hell out of you. Who were the other two blokes?” Recovering, John stood up and wiped his mouth with his sleeve.
John feels dizzy. They need to lie down. John feels desperate to find a hard surface to push Sherlock into. He's aching and he's starting to sweat and he sure he's going to come with a convulsion right here, right now and
Cocaine is my weakness, I'm afraid.
“No really,” she explained, clearing her throat, “I want to know, because he’s my friend and I care about him.”
"Hi, Sherlock."
He made a mental note to ask his parents when, exactly this happened.
“How much did he drink?” Another person asked.
"Police? Well, I... I...
Back at school, my time was my own. I slept a few hours and went to the university library to read. It's a good place for me to think. I ran into Molly Hooper, who was happy to see me--until she wasn't.
A few pints, maybe or--allright, let's play billiards.
"Yeah, it's fine, you're not sure you can entirely trust him."
"It's back at the club, apparently." Sherlock looked down at John standing in front of him. He had a odd expression on his face that John couldn't read.
-he was with Jim Moriarty and that is a terrible combination. Mary was wrong, Sherlock may be young and allright --he maybe mad, but he did have family and he wasn't on his own. He had me. And I was determined to find him.
“Maybe.” Mike said slowly, groaning. “Sherlock?”
He takes notes, helps me clarify my thoughts. Steps in between me and Anderson.
"That's not a code, that's a name." He almost whispers and walks over to a desk and picks up a black phone.
“Sherlock, come in, come in!” The boisterous, friendly man escorted them to a table. “Sit, sit please!-- so nice to see you! Whatever you want, anything, anything on the menu for you and your date!” Angelo dropped off menus and walked away.
"I didn't buy it!!"
I reached for the vest that I had on before and pulled it on. "Why would you do something like this? You know how much
John's shoulders slumped, "It's alright, we can go." John knew his search could be fruitless, but wanted to try. He had to.
"What do you have?"
John can feel cool air as Sherlock pushes his pants down to ride low on his hips.
There were not many people left in the pub, it was late. No one noticed him come in--at first. No one looked towards the door, except John, who sat there gaping.
I'm certain it's
that's what's they call it.
All three boys were sitting up and trying to stand when the emergency vehicles arrived on the scene.
He smiled anyway, "Good," he reached up and started to unbutton my shirt. My legs were spread for balance and he stood right between them. He kissed me again, the tip of his hot tongue ghosting my bottom lip.
I'd never take my hands off him."
I shift in my seat and try to look away. I don't want to him know how much I want this.
She made a helpless face searching for the right words.
But I couldn't take my eyes off him. He looked the same, I thought and yet, didn't somehow. Same hair, same clothes, same face, same long, long legs. He was slumped slightly in the booth, legs crossed at his ankles under the table. The group he was with was a rowdy bunch. Toffs from his school, no doubt. They were loud and boisterous.
Mary let it slide. Bless her.
The color of the ink has no meaning in this specific situation. Red ink does not make promises.
But..
"And who did you expect, John?" it was getting late and John thought Mycroft looked tired.
I have John's soft track pants on and a vest with his old school name on the front.
John thanked Mrs. Stamford for the ride and said goodbye.
"I have fun with you too, John.” Sherlock said quietly, looking down at John’s foot so close to his leg.
Two years ago he came up to me in the school dining room. I was immediately suspicious. There could be no good reason for him to want to talk to me. Turns out, he wanted to know if I could get him drugs. He tried to promise me that he'd make sure the footballers left me alone. I told him that I had no usual supplier, but that I got everything in Camden, just to throw him off. I wasn't telling Seb anything he didn't already know.
I  had placed a piece of sello tape over the latch before I left. The reentry wasn't as elegant as the exit.  I removed the tape before I slipped up the back staircase and back to my room.
Sherlock was pretty rattled. I had never seen him like this. I'd seen him drunk, annoyed, injured, arrested, angry, but never this upset, Jim
I am alone to ponder. Laughing at myself, I spend a few awkward moments considering that it might be a dream as I walk to the loo. I take the hottest shower I can stand, washing my sticky body. I spy a noticeable black and blue mark on my left hipbone.  No dream then.
John covered his face with his hands. He felt dizzy.
Two blocks up the street, he was surprised to hear someone calling his name.
"What kind of a code is that?" asks the new employee.
“I’ll take 'em.” John offered, standing.
Standing across from Mycroft was Sherlock. As John burst into the flat, he had obviously interrupted a conversation between the brothers, but now they are silent. Sherlock lowered his head, staring at his feet maybe or the patterns of the carpet.  Mycroft turned to look at John, but Sherlock did not look up.
John, I'm sure, was dumbfounded. "Uh, wait--Sherlock,
"That's great, excellent." Sherlock hangs up.
John was desperate to talk to Sherlock. He thought back to the library-- it felt so long ago--but was just earlier today. Jim Moriarty was at the library today--wasn't he? John
Halfway through John's tea the door blew open and in walked the person he'd been waiting for. Dressed much differently that John had ever seen him before, but still the same person. He nodded at the older woman, walked directly to John's table in three long strides and slid into the chair.
"Hi, I'm Johnny." said the kid, who did not look at all unhappy or confused or ill at ease to be there.
And he—John Watson--had started it.
“John!” Mike squinted, looking up at the blond guy. “When did you get here?”
“What?” Sherlock's eyes were blank and cloudy, not giving anything away. He should’ve been an actor, thought John.
"Oh, but I am." No time to panic.
He can't let Sherlock pay for everything. Feed him, subsidize his monthly rent, put clothes on his back.
Mike walked in with a big smile on his face, eyes bright. He looked at the completely annihilated sitting room, furniture turned over and pieces of broken wooden coffee table everywhere.
"We?"
"What?" she said, punching him playfully in the arm.
I called his room but there was no answer. Over the next few days, I ran around town looking everywhere--the pub, the library (in the back), the uni coffee shop. Nothing.
“I was with Lestrade we're working on a ca---" Sherlock started.
"Uh..no. If if you think I should stay...I can stay." John said in a low voice, looking at the pale teen with closed eyes on the sofa.
"Sherlock Holmes, I want to introduce Miss Mary Morstan, client. She wants us--well,
And John...is...?
She states thickly, sounding like someone's mum.
John's expression gets clouded as he searches Sherlock's eyes. "Did he touch you?"
I'm relieved to get there, but I don't see who put a foot out to trip me.
He could do it dammit, he could have a life with Sherlock and separate from him, too. He was sure of it.
The party was hot. Very, very hot. A few flakes of snow were falling outside, but inside the large flat it was summer in December.  The house was packed with sweaty uni students drinking cheap beer out of those red American party cups. Looking around only briefly, Sherlock took note of the striking black and white uniforms of the football team and realized that the entire team must be here.
Sherlock walked over to the sofa and sat down near John, placing his head in his hands. After a minute, John slid closer to him and just sat quietly. He took his left hand and ran it over Sherlock's shoulders, the material of his shirt warming up now that he'd been inside a while.
Sherlock didn’t answer. John stepped tentatively into the loo and touched him on the arm. “Sherlock, let me get you to your room.”
"Perhaps he wants you to phone the Queen." Mary offered. Everyone stared at her.
"Sherlock, it pains me to do this, but I have to arrest you."
Moriarty pouted. "Oh, I'd never leave John out. I think you two are a package deal, if I'm correct."
His father nodded and took his mother’s hand. She stood and patted John on the shoulder and they walked quietly into the hallway.
He grabbed Sherlock by the shoulders and broke them apart.
`````````````````````````````````````"`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
"Why not? Something special about this party? Invite only?" Sherlock smiled and pulled off his vest and stood in front of John with no shirt on. Sherlock's jean's hung low on his hips, and his long curly dark hair touched his collar bones in the front. They stood there a moment in silence as Sherlock watched John's eyes wander from his face to his lips, then collar bones and chest. John flushed pink and looked away before his eyes wandered anywhere else.
She shrugged. "Insisted on waiting. John took them up."
John and Mike both looked each other with unguarded shock and concern. This was a surprise. Mike knew where John was last night, but no one knew where Sherlock had been. john didn't realize that Sherlock was out at all. Had he been out all night? By the looks of it, that's just what happened.
"I would be closer, but I've had something in my way." Jim fiddled with the empty wine glass and stared down at the tabletop, eyes unfocused.
“I’ll get the bucket.” Sherlock offered, sighing and placed it next to John's head on the floor.
John closed his book and sat up straight in his chair. He wasn’t sure if he should get up and leave. Then Jim turned slowly and walked out the door,disappearing into the hallway. John heaved a sigh of relief. He waited a few moments and packed up his books to go home, it was almost dinner time anyway.
I hadn't been to Angelo's in quite a while. It was nice. Best of all, it was on Mycroft.
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Sorry, it
When he could not get more depressed about this lack of self control, there was a knock at the door.
His back and legs were aching. He briefly thought about going to get 2 paracetamol, but he didn’t want again to look at the broken furniture in the sitting room and come face to face with the material evidence of his wild behavior.
She left us at the front of the residence hall, she had an evening class. "Bye, Sherlock." Molly waved at him shyly, still blushing. She didn't say 'bye' to me.
He grabbed one of the magazines and sat down heavily on the edge of the sofa seat.
John cleared his throat and gave a small, bitter laugh. Sherlock glanced up at him and saw that John's eyes were hard and vacant. "But I'm not going to press you. And I'm going to try to understand--whatever it is."  John said finally, getting up from the sofa and walking to the kitchen, to open the fridge.
I was quiet, standing there with my arms crossed in front of me, angry. At this point, in my life, I could not articulate my thoughts and feelings. I looked over at John, who I'm sure could not imagine what I was playing at.
What was most concerning about Mary was not what I could see, but what I
Thinking back to last summer, in Amsterdam with Victor, trying my first hashish. We'll see how this compares.
But I was met with dead air.
John's head was whirling right and left, "No, no--I need a phone. I have to make a call. A phone call."
"John.
I made it back at bout 330, slipped in before the sun started to come up,
John's jeans fell open and slid slightly down his hips. His legs started to shake slightly and his head swam as he pulled Sherlock closer.
The booth went quiet, Mike, Molly and Liz starred into their pints. This was very unfortunate. Sherlock threw his head back and drained what was left of his beer in one gulp.
enrolled?"
Mary waited for an answer.
I am not sure if I am the first
John panicked. "Wait!" he said, jumping up as well, tangling his legs a bit in the chair as he stood to block Sherlock's departure.
It was getting late. Back in my room, sitting on the bed. I couldn't believe my luck--I actually had Sherlock here--in my room--for the night.
that's what I called it.
My sister Harriet should know, she's all about having a good time.
"How do you know? --There's no drugs?" How does anyone know anything anymore?
This next room was different, but not by much. A little cleaner maybe and no people laying on the floor. Right in front of the hearth, was a chair, as if drawn up by the fire, but there was no fire today, the grate was cold.
If circumstances were not what they were.
John walks in to the kitchen to answer the phone. His Father tells him Harry has improved, the tube is out and she's talking.
"Shut up.” he mouthed.
He awoke confused, finding him self on a strange sofa in a strange place. He was aware that a blanket was placed over him sometime during the night. Sitting bolt upright, and whipping his head all ‘round he saw Sherlock sitting at the kitchen table looking into a microscope. Oh yeah right--
"That's an open wound." I pulled my leg away, eyes smarting from pain.
John's new relationship with Mary was going well. She was such a ball of fire. For a nursing student, she hung out with loads of studious but hard drinking students. Mary introduced him to Irene, Janeen and Jim. They were out every weekend (and a few week nights, too.) John found it difficult to keep up the pace--not with classes and football too.
He got to the top of the stairs and knocked quietly on the door. “Sherlock?”
“Yes?”
'I have been sent here to show you some things." the young boy stated matter of factly,
She put her hands on her hips, "I thought you two live together."
I saw it. It's something very apparent to me, but is likely
"I'm kissing you." he said matter-of-factly.
--would use the same technique.
John leaves with Mycroft, not getting a chance to mention Jim, Molly, or plans for the summer. He had to get to Chelmsford.
John just looked blankly at him. Of course, they had just met this evening, John not knowing anything really about the tall young man standing beside him.
“Well, it won’t be long now, right, one month?” John hoped that sounded reassuring.
It's no longer a parlor game when you see a bit of someone's soul.
Mary looked up at him astonished. "Phone," he explained.
He sighed and reached into the pocket of his coat for the pack of cigarettes and lighter that he had also purchased at Tescos. Sherlock laughed at himself--what else could he get up to tonight, he wondered? Back to his old tricks of addiction and breaking and entering, even thought it was for a good cause. Well, he had to do something to get his mind off of John…..or the lack of John….who may not be back at uni for a few days….
John was so angry he couldn't look at Sherlock. He stared down at the envelope.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Irene rolled her eyes and untied him rapidly. She kept glancing anxiously at the door.
About a quarter gram of coke (by weight) in my hand. I think.
meetings, but no reprimand occurred. In fact, he complimented me on not getting into any recent trouble and attending classes.
Such a shame Victor's not here, he would have loved this.
The party got crowded quickly. The beer flowed, John kept a look out for Sherlock, but it seemed as though he wasn’t going to make it.  Just as well,  John couldn't relax knowing he still had to talk to Mary.
“Yeah, that’s the John Watson I know---so serious about his studies!!” said Ian, the football captain, smiling.
I really didn't want to explain the whole thing, but I did. He looked a bit relieved after hearing it. "I'll call your school in the morning."
Sherlock found his cheeks going a bit pink as everyone in the room turned to look at him. Mike clapped Sherlock on the back and then fell flat on his face.
I hurried back to my room. I picked up the phone to dial my brother. "Mycroft, I need you to tell me anything you know about a uni student named
His dinner had gone cold.
"Why?"
worse.
He kept hounding me, I begrudgingly relented. He changed the dressing with gloves and a very professional manner, but sat
"Is that how you got the bruise?" John touches it gently. Ugly, blue, purple and red. Sherlock does not pull away this time. He lets John touch his face.
"It's 1 am Sherlock and you re drinking a beer." John said, disapproving.
“Well, you don’t look too scathed,” he began.
`````FIN`````````````
Back in bed, John feels fatigue pressing down on him like a lead blanket.  He is asleep for what feels like hours when again he feels a cold breeze in the room.
"John, are you awake?" They can hear Mike outside the door.
John charged at him a third time, but he held the poker up threateningly.
“Last time I went to a uni party a building blew up.” Sherlock laughed.
Sherlock wasn't fighting.
"There's still plenty of time this term to pass chemistry." he frowned.
"Oh no, Mary, that's alright, you don't have to." there was an uncomfortable silence as John toed on his shoes and walked toward the door.
“Your girlfriend…. what’s her name again?”
Sherlock ran back to the flat afraid that John would be steady on his heels. He ran at a fast clip, shoes slipping a bit in the light snow that had just fallen. His heart was beating wildly. His chest burned from all the exertion. He had gone into the pub for a pint, which was not his usual habit, but he knew it would not be as crowded. He knew the bar tender and getting a pint would not be a problem.
"Do you want to kill
They squint at the screens, rubbing their eyes occasionally. The half empty styrofoam coffee cups at their elbows are from early this morning. The paper signs that read 'Please do not eat or drink at the desk." has been ignored.
They chatted about the weather and exams and when they were almost parting ways, Molly paused and then just very directly asked for clarification of his relationship with Sherlock. John didn’t like being backed into a corner and hesitated to admit to anything, but Molly encouraged him to speak.
Sherlock downed the rest of the beer. John decided there was no point in being impatient, Sherlock'd talk when he was ready. So he sat there, trying not to stare at Sherlock with the fury he felt.
They took the train to Chelmsford and Harry picked them up at the station. John had told Harry quite a bit about Sherlock and Harry was very keen to meet him.
Sherlock was uncharacteristically quiet, waiting.
he looked down into his mug.
