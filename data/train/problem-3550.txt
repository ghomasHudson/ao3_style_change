Cas correctly interpreted the look on his face — “Honey wine, Dean!” He’d plucked the brochure from Dean’s hand, opened it and thrust an eager finger at the text inside. “And they have their own beehives!”
Castiel utters a string of Enochian curses that would make Lucifer himself flinch. Nothing for it, and he has more important concerns at the moment, his attention returning to the unconscious hunter.
Eileen had made it known she thought this might not be the best idea (“It’s an invasion of privacy, Sam.”) but when he explained that he was just going to use it long enough to make sure they were okay, she nodded and picked up one of the journals to help him search. Her stack was up to three and scanning her fourth when she stopped and tapped his arm.
With his other hand, he desperately clings to Cas to keep him from toppling over, the angel arching and keening, wings flexing and twitching behind him with each upward slide and twist of his hand.
He’s getting married, and his brother will be at his side when he does. Maybe it will inspire the kid to make his move.
Dean's eyes unfocus briefly in thought, then returns to their initials and paints a green horizontal line between them.
Dean glances over at Sam’s wave and sees Gabe waving back merrily in the window - and a flash of dark hair and blue eyes as the curtain is rapidly closed. His breath freezes in his chest, his mouth suddenly dry.
,” Toni hisses, striding into the room to stare down at Dean. “Do you realize what you’ve done, what I had to deal with tonight, because of you?” She throws up her hands and stalks over to a table containing a fancy crystal decanter filled with scotch (and a pretty good scotch; he might have had some earlier) and pours herself a glass. “Called on the carpet by those self-righteous prigs on the Security Council, at 11:30 at night, and all of them calling for your head… or your license.” She takes a sip before whirling back around and barks, “You’re supposed to display some sort of
“Dead man’s blood,” Castiel interjected, and Sam nodded in agreement. “And worm fat - dragons were often referred to as worms or wyrms…”
The Leviathan’s head is across the room in a pool of black goo, the wall splattered with it, the trail leading back to the decapitated body in its own black puddle.
“Thanks.” He grins and rubs his shoulder. He then takes a deep breath and turns, the breath catching in his throat at Cas’ full lips spreading into a beaming smile, blue eyes bright and warm. In that moment, Dean realizes what he wants, even more than he wants Dick Roman dead.
Dean reaches behind Cas to the oil glands, gathering up a handful. He grasps Cas’ cock with the oiled hand, stroking it to coat it fully, then guiding the tip to his waiting hole. With a trembling sigh like the wind over the prairie, Cas slides slowly into Dean.
Perhaps sensing Dean’s regard, Cas’ eyes rise to meet his, and he smiles over the rim of his cup. The warmth of it flows over Dean like a waterfall, the blue eyes dancing and sparking in the candlelight. It’s downright romantic and Dean can’t get enough.
Dean turns back to Roman, holds his eyes as he shoves his entire pile of chips into the center of the table.
Anyone with another spray can would be able to come along and paint over it, as if it never existed.
Several hours later, with the Impala parked off the road and hidden from view of the farmhouse below, the three surveyed the site.
Cas felt his heart in his throat, and he couldn’t speak. This would be the moment where Dean tells him he knows how Cas feels about him and he just doesn't feel the same way, and it would
announcement, Dean is all but sure Castiel can hear his heart thundering in his chest. Another memory of the feel of feathers in his fingers as he worked Feathers’... Castiel’s… wings, and the blood in his body begins to rush south. He turns away quickly and heads back to bank the fire for the night.
“I hope you got better than my straight, pal,” Dean hears Charlie say, voice strained as she tosses her cards away, folding. “‘Cause if you’re bluffing…”
“Sam… what are we going to do?” Cas asked him, his voice so small and broken, and Sam had to choke down a lump in his own throat.
Another incandescent flash through the window and Cas’ sweat-slick body scintillates in argent light, hair shining in a halo-like glow and eyes flashing blue-white. Static electricity in the air sparks down his body and onto Dean’s, and for a moment he forgets to breathe.
Dean’s heart fights between bursting with joy and breaking from sadness as his friend rises higher… but then, Feathers’ ascent stops. The wings flatten and to Dean’s surprise, he glides down to the ground.
Just as his eyes are starting to close, Cas turns toward him, blue eyes meeting his own, and even in the dim light of the television, they seem to glow. “I will. Don’t worry about me, Dean. Get some rest.” And as Dean’s eyes drift shut, he could swear those blue eyes glow even brighter.
“Good evening. Each of you has deposited ten million dollars, with the option of an additional five million buy-in. The money will remain in escrow until the winner is declared and enters their unique password...” He sets the case on the table, opening it to reveal a screen and keyboard. “Whereupon the winnings will be deposited into the bank registered when you entered.” He turns the case around to where the keyboard is accessible from the front of the table. “We will proceed in alphabetical order, and appropriately, ladies first. Ms. Bradbury, if you will please enter a password.” Whitshaw stands aside as Charlie approaches. “Six letters or more, if you please.”
But Ellen waves a hand impatiently. “We can go over all the bells and whistles later.” She leans forward again, sliding a sealed manila envelope over. “Your cover, IDs, etc.” Dean reaches for it and grabs one side but Castiel already has the other, and he throws a challenging look Dean’s way — and Dean is struck once again by those startling blue eyes, almost losing his grip on the envelope.
Dean grumbles but there’s no real heat in it. He pauses in the Library and turns to Castiel, his hand raising to grasp his upper arm. “Want anything while I’m in there, sweetheart?”
Sam, behind the wheel of the Impala (much to Dean’s dismay — “Dean, you’ve just had a fifteen-hour plane flight and under the influence of sedatives. I’m not letting you drive!”) nods. “Yeah, and I think I’ve figured out what the data you sent means...”
“I… I wanted to, Cas, so much… but my dad… he wouldn’t have understood, and I was so busy with the business and taking care of Sammy…” he paused, choking on emotion as the tears forming in his eyes began to fall, rolling silently down his cheeks. “And then… then Dad died, and by then I had lost track of you. I called Sonny and he said you aged out and split, and he had no idea where you had gone.”
Castiel fervently hoped that Dean was NOT conscious, and wiped another drop of dampness from Dean’s face.
Cas thumbs Dean’s chin and raises it to meet his gaze, his eyes sorrowful and disbelieving. “You believe I’m going to leave you as soon as I cure you?” he asks, his voice barely above a whisper. “Is that why you’ve been hesitating?”
Sam finally found his voice, reaching to grasp Castiel’s arm to pull him away from the room and back toward the library. “It’s not, though, Cas… take a closer look…”, his voice breathless in his excitement. Castiel obliged and upon closer examination came to the same conclusion that Sam had earlier.
Tearing his eyes reluctantly away, he notices the possible source of the earlier clattering noise — the green cooler, most commonly occupying the back seat of the Impala, now sits on the kitchen island, lid open. As he ponders the significance of the appearance of the cooler outside of its normal environment, Dean rises from his rummaging, packages of cold cuts and cheese in his hands, and turns toward the cooler on the island. His eyes raise and catch Castiel’s.
Dean meets Sam’s shocked gaze, and the brothers turn, running from the storage room. They race down the hall and through the kitchen, past the library and down into the map room - just in time to see the door at the top of the stairs swing open with a loud squeal. A tall figure walks through, silhouetted in the dim red light.
With a nod of his own, Dean rises, limping over to where, sure enough, Dick Roman kneels, hands bound behind him.
But Sam knew Dean was aware he was fading, and every so often caught the fear in his brother’s eyes when he thought no one was looking.
He and Cas straighten up as the woman brings his phone back to Dean, her face beaming as she hands it back.
Tentatively, he reached to cup Dean’s jaw, running a thumb across his cheek, and gently pulled him close to press his lips to Dean’s.
They’re sitting outside the San Diego courthouse, the happy shouts of the children playing in the fountains behind them echoing the ones his heart is making. He turns to Cas, smiles and squeezes his hand.
He joins Cas at the fire with his treasures in hand — two long metal sticks with handles, a bag of jumbo marshmallows, a box of graham crackers, and several fun-sized Hersey chocolates. “Ever had s’mores, Cas?” he asks, setting the items down by the log before taking a seat next to him.
“Only a couple of hours. How are you feeling?” Cas asks, stepping over to the couch and kneeling beside him again as he lifts a hand to Dean’s head, then down to his throat. A soft glow from his palm and the scratching in Dean’s throat eases. Dean grasps his hand and gently pulls it away as the glow fades, absently stroking Cas’ wrist with his thumb.
Lee laughs, a sarcastic edge to it that sets Dean’s teeth on edge. “And you’re still immune, I take it.”
As he makes his way across the lobby, his training instantly kicks in as it would in any possibly hostile environment: exits and entrances, escape points and blind corners. The small hairs on the back of his neck prickle with the feeling of being watched, but he doesn’t react — best to remain alert and let the potential threat expose themselves first. He puts on his most charming smile as he approaches the receptionist.
Cas leans into his palm, eyes sliding shut. “But not unwanted?” he asks, his voice sounding small and shy.
“Tell you what. All Bugs apply,” and the devious grin widens as he glances over to meet Castiel’s eyes. “But for post-1998 Bugs, instead of punching the other person, you have to give them a kiss.”
Castiel’s shaking knees give out and he falls to his knees in front of Dean, leaning forward to kiss him, wild and breathless.
It figures the Brits would send their stooge in a fancy jet with all the amenities while forcing him to fly back home commercial. He kicks a loose piece of concrete in annoyance. Flying
Dean scoffs at that, but out of the corner of his eye, he sees Castiel’s face go blank and still, blue eyes wide as they focus on the bone in Dean’s hand… and just as quickly, gone, as Sam turns to face him with a question in his eyes.
Castiel buries his nose into Dean’s neck and breathes in, his scent sweet and salty, and presses a kiss against the underside of his jaw, Dean humming his pleasure. “I am feeling very well, Dean… very well, indeed.”
Cas curves his wings around and up so Dean can reach the final primaries at the wingtips, and after the last primary has been coated in oil, Cas releases one hand from Dean’s shoulder to reach behind him and gather some of the oil into his hand. That hand comes back around to run an oil-slicked finger down Dean’s spine, into his crack and circle around the tight muscle of his hole. A reedy whine breathes past Dean’s lips as he pushes back against Cas’ finger, slipping in a knuckle at a time until it brushes against his prostate, and Dean lets out a shuddering cry from the stimulation.
Cas stands in front of one of the benches, and that’s when the realization hits Dean — the benches are oriented to the four points of the compass, Cas at the one oriented North, and gestures for each of them to take one of the other four — Dean to the East, Jack to the West, and Sam to the South.
As Dean kneels before the net and examines the bent wing, he sees bits of white and dots of red among the ebony feathers - bones, and blood. The bird’s wing was broken, more than likely as it flew into the net.
The flashing blue lights of the plethora of police cars reflect in the rearview mirror as he pulls away, and Dean winces. He pulls the phone he’d liberated from Chet’s bleeding body and stares at the locked screen. The phone that Ketch passed Chet in exchange for an envelope of money.
Dean narrows his eyes at his odd behavior, not commenting on it, but — “Hey, where’s yours?” When Cas looks back up, squinting back at him, Dean waves his burrito. “Yours. Breakfast.”
“Angels don’t exist,” he murmurs to himself, then louder, looking into Cas’ eyes. “Angels don’t exist…” He gulps. “Cas, are you… are you an angel?”
A shaft of light beamed through the window of the chapel, striking him and setting the sandy blonde hair aflame, bright eyes blazing green, smile radiant. He glowed like an angel.
Castiel blinks rapidly, not trusting his hearing. “Excuse me?” His eyes fall back on Dean’s, searching.
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean sees Cas sitting at the bar next to Lee. On any other day he would have loved to have seen how
Cas flexes his dripping palm, sealing it while whispering in a foreign, halting language; the smoke rising from the bowl begins to glow silver and red, increasing and rising, swirling as if caught in a whirlwind.
“Hold on...there’s another card in play.” Lee pauses — for dramatic effect? For fuck’s sake. Speaking of things not changing… “Charlie Bradbury. She’s CIA.”
The single brain cell still residing in Dean’s upper brain reminds him that night is falling and he needs to prepare, to find out for sure if the curse is broken.
“Tell Eileen we said ‘hey’ and no, we’re not in jail. We’re in San Diego, kids are playing in the fountains behind us.” Dean pauses. “The fountains next to the courthouse.”
It certainly explained how he became entangled in the dreamcatcher, which an ordinary bird would have flown straight through without even knowing it was there.
Dean starts by untying the strip of flannel holding the wing to the body, then laying a hand on the splint, carefully cuts the flannel bandages binding the splint and gently pulls them from around the wing. “Easy there, buddy,” he says as he lays the scissors down, then places his hand on Feather’s back to steady him as he removes the cardboard splint, laying it next to the bandages. He can feel the bird trembling beneath his hand and gives him a calming stroke.
“Hi, uh… De.. Daniel. I”m Daniel… uh, Dan, and this is… “ Releasing the guy’s… Davis’... hand, he turns to Cas, eyes wide and imploring.
It quickly becomes apparent that the shower is far too small for both of them to be able to dry off there, so with an exaggerated shiver, Dean hops out and begins to rapidly dry off, Castiel following suit in the shower tub. When they’re both dry, Dean offers his hand to Castiel, drawing him out of the shower and into the room proper. He makes his way to the duffle bag by the door and fetches out two pairs of sweats, stepping into one pair before helping Castiel into the other. He then snatches the Impala keys from the nightstand and turns for the door.
of the room door opening. Cas’ head pokes out of the door, blue eyes turning dark with worry when he spies Dean sitting on the Impala.
Castiel reached his hand toward Sam, never taking his eyes off Dean, who weakly turned his head to look up and meet his gaze. “Heya, sweetheart.”
“AH HA!” Sam exclaimed and held up a jar of reddish-yellow material with a paste-like consistency, clearly labeled “Dragon Fat”.  “I don’t know where she got this and I don’t WANNA know, but I remember cataloging it.” He continued to search through the boxes, pulling a jar containing Dahlia, another filled with Peony petals.
telling you that password.” He sits up straighter. “I’m getting out of this chair, and when I do, I’m going to kill you.”
For instance: not all angels cavort about the earth in the form of mythical beings and form themselves as they please - only Seraphs and Archangels can do that. Your rank-and-file angels have to take a “vessel” - some poor sap has to agree to let a cosmic being ride around in their meatsuit.
The witch laughs. “I’ve given him a great gift. You’ll see.” He flicks his wrist, a bolt of purple flying out and striking Castiel. It doesn’t hurt him but distracts him enough to loosen his grip, and the witch disappears.
Sam turned the corner and immediately began looking for whatever he needed to shoot, only to find the witch already slumped in the corner, dead, and Cas kneeling on the floor holding a tiny figurine, similar to the ones he saw scattered throughout the house.
“Go get him. He’s all yours,” he says over his shoulder, his eyes fixed on Cas. Out of the corner of his eye he sees Charlie nod and spin, finger raising instantly to the small hidden microphone in her ear as she dashes from the room in pursuit.
Brittany nods like her head is on a swivel. “OH of course! We’re not going anywhere, go feed your boyfriend!” She turns back to Gertrude and strikes up a conversation with another couple.
“Listen, I can help — I-I know people, things,” Ketch stammers, then brightens. “I’ll give you my contact! You could get the whole organization through him…”
Dean snorts again. “The only thing Sam and Eileen are ‘hunting’” — fingers hooking the air for emphasis, much to Castiel’s amusement —  “is a good place to play ‘hide the sausage’ other than
Finally, Cas picks up the crown on his bench and moves to stand in front of Dean. For a moment, their eyes meet and time seems to stop and hold its breath — then Cas places the crown in Dean’s hands.
Dean hums as his fingers drum the steering wheel. “And I’m also getting the impression that you’re not one hundred percent on board with this plan.”
When Dean returns, they get to work.  Bobby’s journal detailing his investigation had been found with him, and Sam traces the connections, starting with the last one Bobby made — the Leviathan that killed him. Dean catches and beats information out of each and every smug, big-mouthed freak Sam points him at. And the connections they find are both more extensive and far more terrifying than they originally thought.
, and he would read a chapter to Sam every time he had a nightmare, to help him focus on something other than monsters so he could go back to sleep. When they had gone through all twelve chapters, Dean “found” a copy of
With a muffled “mmmrph”, the door handle stills, followed by the sound of Sam’s shuffling feet fading into the distance and Dean heaves a sigh of relief.
But Dean knew exactly who he was the second he saw the dark tousled hair, and those blue, blue eyes, even with the bruise-dark circles under them.
Cas finally broke the silence. “So, uh… how’s Lisa? Is she meeting you at the cabin?” The words were dull in his ears, and he hoped Dean didn’t hear how much they hurt for him to say.
Wings flaring behind him, Cas shrugs a bare shoulder and flicks his wrist, and Dean startles as a gleaming silver blade drops into Cas’ hand, seemingly out of nowhere.
The memory of finding the broken flight feathers - still shimmering from the wing oil - chokes Dean’s breath and threatens to overcome his tenuous hold on his sanity.
“My friend Balthazar had been pleading with Michael and my Brothers to release me, to allow me to fulfill my mission serving with you and Sam,” Castiel continues. “For a long time, Michael refused - but then he inexplicably capitulated. He released me, but since my Grace was too depleted for me to leave, he tasked Balthazar to assist me. He was the one that brought me here, that disabled your wards long enough to get me inside, and I used the last bit of Grace I could spare to raise them again.”
Dean grins, then pushes away from the stove and turns to open the package of bacon. He grabs a handful of toothpicks and the pan of hamburger patties, wrapping two pieces around each of them, crossed in the middle. He spikes the ends with a toothpick, his mouth watering in anticipation of biting into one (or, let’s face it, two or three) of these once they’re cooked. Spinning around to face the sink, he washes his hands one more time, then heads to the pantry to pull out the buns. When he returns, he lets out a low whistle, as Sam has finished slicing the cheese, returned the block to the fridge, wrapped the plate of cheese slices and pan of burgers, and is just placing everything into the cooler he’d already filled with ice and beer.
Sam stands and leans forward to glare at him across the desk. “Of course we didn’t forget about that! We’re working with a group of local hunters who’ve had their eye on the local Leviathan activity. They’ve got boots on the ground and have already made connections inside the casino. They’ll be keeping an eye on the other players.”
Cas must feel him tense and releases his wrists, hands running up Dean’s arms to wrap around his shoulders and pull him in tight. “Do not fret, Ol Limlal,” he whispers, lips mouthing the shell of Dean’s ear, sending shivers ricocheting down his back. “I wish to speak to you of the Bond.”
“Hey Cas, do you want more…” he glances over to Cas, who seems completely enthralled by whatever happens to be on the TV (what it is, Dean has no idea; he turned it on for the noise and was on his phone checking in with Sam). His single slice of pizza has barely been touched. At least the bottle of beer is empty. “What’s up? Pizza not to your liking?”
Cas thanked him, then placed his hand palm up on the table. With a tired sigh, Dean climbed into his hand and curled up, eyes closed and practically asleep before Cas could even raise his hand. Picking up the blanket with his other hand, Cas made his way toward Dean’s room.
any different? Anything strike you as being different at all?” He glances up at the ceiling. “Like, oh, I dunno, how you feel about Cas?”
“Definitely up for that later, sweetheart. But we have to get you healthy first.” He turns onto his side and Cas whines at the lack of contact until Dean palms his cheek, his thumb running over Cas’ bottom lip.
And he fully intended to watch the proceedings as Cas pulled out one of Dean’s AC/DC shirts and a pair of dark blue sweats, closing the drawer and turning to set them at the foot of the bed. Then by God if Cas didn’t stare directly into his eyes while slowly removing the trench coat and then the suit jacket, sauntering over to drape both over the chair next to Dean’s desk, slowly turning back around to loosen the tie knot and slip it from around his neck, slowly, slowly…
“Okay, I’m gonna stretch the wing very slowly.” Running the hand from his back to the shoulder joint of the wing, he places the other at the leading edge of the wing to work the shoulder joint first, then moving down to the phalanx, feeling the break site at the ulna on the way. It’s clean, with just a slight calcium bump at the break site. Breathing out a sigh of relief, he grips the phalanx and slowly extends the wing, standing as he does so, Feather’s eyes never leaving him.
“Full house, kings over aces,” the dealer announces, pushing the relevant community cards forward. “Mr. Roman? Your cards.”
“Is there anything I can get you?” Dean asks, jabbing a thumb over his shoulder toward the kitchen. “Water, or something to eat maybe?”
Everyone nodded and turned to gather their bags. Sam led the way to his car and opened the trunk, where the four dumped their bags and piled in. Dean led the way back to the Impala, opening the trunk. He reached for Cas’ bag and tossed it inside along with his own.
In the months after that first kiss, they explored each other. Tentatively at first- small touches and heated kisses giving way to more heated exchanges, hidden away in alcoves or closets or empty classrooms. When the oldest boy turned 18 and aged out, his private room was left empty. Dean acquired it, and with it a place for him and Castiel to expand their exploration. The first night in his new room, Dean whispered for Castiel to join him after his roommates had fallen asleep, and upon his arrival presented him with a bottle of Astroglide and a box of condoms. They wasted no time stripping each other down. Castiel gently, lovingly opened Dean up before pushing inside him for the first time. Dean whimpered and sighed with pleasure underneath him, Castiel covering his mouth gently to stifle Dean’s cries as he came, and muffling his own cries in Dean’s shoulder as he joined him.
Castiel shrugs as Dean reaches the bed and helps him down onto it. “I need to be in contact with you to access your dreams,” he sighs as he lies down, eyes sliding shut. “Specifically, my wings.”
Castiel tilts his head, eyes squinting in confusion. “Catch a… cold? I’m quite capable of maintaining a proper body core temperature.” He begins to slump, and Dean rushes to his side, guiding him to the couch which Castiel sinks onto with a grateful sigh, wings flattened against his back and curling over his bare shoulders like a cape. “I apologize, it appears I am still not at full strength.”
Dean is perfectly happy to share Feathers’ progress with him, but the one thing Dean can not bring himself to discuss with Sam are the dreams.
Dean’s face crumpled, and he reached for Cas, pulling him into a hug. They both held on, finally pulling away to stare at each other, unbelieving and happy.
Dean's aunt and uncle would throw an annual Labor Day "Last Blast of Summer" party before school started, up at their cabin in Sioux Falls, and Cas, Gabe, and their mother Naomi were always invited to stay up at the cabin with them. The four brothers would share a bunkhouse-style room, two bunk beds on either side of the room, and it was the rare evening where Bobby wouldn’t have to pay them a visit or three to tell them to shut the hell up and go to sleep already. It was a cherished annual ritual all the way through Cas and Dean’s high school graduation party
Castiel made his way around the back of the house to the far side, where the small kitchen door they had observed in the satellite pictures stood. Standing just outside the door, he stilled and listened, tapping into his faltering Grace to enhance his hearing.
Cas must realize Dean isn’t going to let this go and heads to the bathroom to change. Dean takes the last bite of burrito and rises to dress himself. He’s just pulling his t-shirt over his head when he hears a sharp intake of breath behind him and turns — and he is
Dean’s eyes meet Castiel’s, and Dean takes a shuddering breath as he squirts the fluid onto Castiel’s outstretched fingers. He rubs his fingers together, spreading and warming the liquid. With his free hand, Castiel pulls Dean up and reaches behind him, down Dean’s crevice to his rim, running his lubricated fingers around it slowly.
Dean blinks, his face flushing hot as contemplation of the expanse of the ocean is replaced with some very inappropriate, not-safe-for-public thoughts. “Uh… let’s do
He places the crown on Jack’s head, and as they embrace, Dean can’t hold back the tears any longer, the track of them running in silent rivulets down his cheeks.
He makes his way through the airport and down to baggage claim, and it takes no time at all to pick Sam out of the crowd — the kid literally
Holy crap, he must have really tied one on last night - or his tolerance for booze was going to shit in his old age. As the dizziness began to subside, he looked up…
“Anyway, spill. How did you guys get angel blood when angels don’t exist?” His eyes focus on Cas’, suspicious, waiting to see if that blank stare returns.
It takes everything in Dean’s power to keep breathing in that moment, to show no reaction. Quietly, he whispers in a choked voice, “Hello, sweetheart. Weren’t you supposed to enter where the others could see you?”
job!” From the look on Ellen’s face at the proposal, Dean can see she’s not too keen on the idea either — but then her eyes light up like a lightbulb has been turned on behind them.
Sam breathed a sigh of relief, then sniffing the air: “Hey, did you make coffee? That’s great!” He ambled off to the kitchen, and Castiel took the opportunity to move all the figurines into the room Dean had appropriated for his oversized television and reclining chairs. He carefully arranged the figurines on the bar - all except Dean, which after some experimentation, discovered if he posed Dean with his knees to his chest and arms wrapped around them, would fit in the breast pocket of his dress shirt. Even though he bulged out somewhat, Castiel didn’t care as long as Dean was close.
The play continues. After several hands, Edgar finally throws his cards on the table in disgust — out. It’s down to Dean and Dick now.
“Sam…,” Cas growled, then paused, his eyes closing and taking several deep breaths before starting again, his voice calmer but no less urgent. “Sam, Dean is
“Dean… we have to… have a conversation about this.” Dean takes some small comfort in Cas’ inability to get that sentence out without a stutter - but he's pinned like a bug on display by those intense blue eyes.
Dean pauses in his recitation of the plaque in front of the Old Point Loma Lighthouse, realizing Cas is no longer nearby to hear. When he turns to look for him, the sight takes his breath away.
The sound of whining and howling drifts in from outside… “Oh shit, the nets. Sam, thanks for all the help but I gotta go!” He hangs up and tosses the phone on the coffee table, wincing when it clatters loudly and glancing over to see if it disturbed the bird, but  it - he - slept on.
After their rainy weekend interlude at Rufus’ cabin, Cas has been extra hands-on — never out of contact with Dean in one way or another for very long — and Dean has zero complaints with this development.
Castiel rolls his eyes. “Hardly a punishment, Dean. Besides, it will be very hard for you to kiss me while you’re driving.”
He contemplates the offer. He’s pretty sure he can find a way to get to Roman even in the CIA’s clutches, but the money… the link to the organization… “What about the winnings?”
, Cas,” Dean breathes against his ear, the warmth of his breath and fingers raking through Castiel’s hair sending an avalanche of shivers down his spine. “Let me take care of you.” Castiel’s eyes slide shut and he nods numbly. Dean moves his hands down to his shoulders, sliding them under the suit jacket and overcoat to pull them off and down his arms, hanging them on one of the hooks hanging on the wall nearby. Dean then turns to the tie knot, untying it  - “I’ll show ya how to put this on the right way later.” - and drapes it over the coat and jacket on the hook. His hands move to the top button of Castiel’s shirt...
Cas leans back against him, head falling to Dean’s shoulder and eyes closed, his expression one of complete contentment. Cas inhales deeply through his nose and smiles.
His eyes continue moving south, down a chest and abs apparently carved by a Greek sculptor with a knack for visual torture… and is that a
” Castiel groans as Dean swallows him down, the ebb and flow of his Grace and Dean’s soul shifting to Dean’s mouth engulfing him, Dean’s fingers digging into his hips.
Dean sighs, tilts his head back and closes his eyes, taking a deep breath before continuing. “Sam, I know this is an unusual bird. It got caught in a magical net designed to catch nightmare apparitions - but it hasn’t tried to kill me like the other things have.”
Then they used the movie’s actors as their cover on the case in Dodge City, Kansas. Cas had called Dean his Huckleberry, and at the time Dean assumed Cas was just quoting the line from the movie.
The squeal of tires had drawn the attention of the people gathered around. One in particular waves and makes his way over to them.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas’ voice, barely a whisper, floats over to Dean as if on a ray of light, and Dean is drawn forward, much as he had that first time in March, much as he had that morning in May after a wild night of passion; drawn to kneel behind Cas, placing the two cups beside him and draping the sleeping bag around them both.
He shook his head to clear his thoughts and turned his attention back to the farmhouse. Unfortunately, there was no ground cover between here and the building - no way to approach it unseen. Stealth was out of the question.
Dean reaches for him, his arms heavy and slow but still able to grab Cas by the waist and pull him down next to him, twining arms and legs around him, burying his face in Cas neck.
“No Round Two tonight, mister. You’ve had a long day and need some rest.” When Castiel opens his mouth to argue, Dean presses a finger against it. “Yeah, yeah, I know, you got a battery jump from my soul. Still…” Dean drops to press another languorous kiss on his lips before dropping to Castiel’s side and pulling him close. “We have all the time in the world now.”
“That was…” Dean struggles for the right words, and nothing he could think of seemed to work; no words exist to describe what he’d just experienced. So he settles for something he knows he has the words for. “You’re awesome, and I love you so much.”
“Ahhhh... f-fuck… Cassss…” he babbles as Castiel slides up and then back down, starting up a steady rhythm.
One of the good things about expensive whiskey - little to no hangover. Even so, coffee first. He can deal with clearing the nets after coffee.
“Obviously,” he says with a chuckle, but then Castiel feels him tense. “But why? Why would he lie about that?”
They reach the highway, and Castiel is floating merrily along, watching the scenery blur by — when he’s shaken out of his reverie by a sharp punch to the shoulder.
Dean sighs in relief and leans forward to touch his forehead to Castiel’s. “It won’t take that long, I promise.”
It had been four years since Cas had last seen Dean, his best friend - when graduation and leaving for college had pulled them apart. Before that, they had been all but inseparable.
“You said you could hear each other’s thoughts, feel what each other were feeling, right?” Dean nods again, quickly looking down so Sam can’t see the blush setting fire to his cheeks at the memory.
“Holy shit,” Dean says, his eyes glancing upwards as he does the calculations in his head. “That’s like…”
While he was pitching the tent (the thought makes him grin, of course), he had sent Cas out to find some firewood and to build the fire pit, handing him a small evac tool (basically a mini-shovel) to clear the ground where the pit would go and instructing him to find some nice round river rock from the small creek nearby to line it with. Cas had done spectacularly, a substantial stack of various sizes of tree branches and a three-ish foot circle of ground cleared nearby. Currently, the former angel was crouched on the ground next to a small pile of oval-shaped stones and was placing them in a ring around the cleared space with the precision one usually associates with engineering a spacecraft.
. But he’ll be damned if this son of a bitch is going to get that satisfaction from him. “Oh, flirting now, are ya? I never woulda guessed Dick was into dick.”
“Well, we might have something to get her off your tail,” Sam says from behind the desk where he’s tapping away on his own laptop. “I’ve sent you Kevin’s report on the info from the cellphone Dean found on Chet.”
Sam wiped his eyes, leaking tears from the outburst, still chuckling. “Of course, you’re right.” Turning back to the coffee pot, he poured a cup and looked toward the library and the pile of books waiting for him.
“Okay, that’s… that’s good. We can work with that.” Standing, he helped Cas to his feet and looked around at the figurines scattered around the room, finally realizing they were the missing hunters. Some had toppled over in the fight but none appeared to be damaged. He turned back to Cas, who hadn’t moved; still holding Dean’s figurine, staring down at it.
“I would love to, Dean.” Cas’ eyes are bright, his smile soft and warm and Dean really wants to kiss him right now, but… company.
Sam stares at the circlet of branches in his hands, then at Cas, eyes wide. Cas smiles gently and nods, and Sam turns to place the crown on Dean’s head, his hands shaking and eyes glistening. As Dean watches, his heart in his throat, a tear runs down Sam’s cheek, sparking in the firelight. Without a second thought, Dean reaches up to wipe it away, then Sam pulls him into a crushing hug. They stand there for a minute, then with a simultaneous closed fist pound to the back, they back away.
Cas must have taken Dean’s silence as protest, his eyes dropping and his voice taking on a pleading tone.
Cas leans forward and spins around, catching Dean by surprise when Cas all but climbs into his lap, wrapping his legs around Dean’s waist before reaching for the coffee cups, offering one to Dean. “You always find me.”
“Yeah, I know,” she says, “and I also know that you’re a hothead with an itchy trigger finger for Roman.” She sighs. “I don’t think you can be objective about this.”
“Yes, of course… but Dean, you’re shivering.” He gently disengages a hand from Dean’s, using the other to pull him towards the bathroom and the shower there.
The smell of ozone fills the air, the light beginning to dim around them - but Dean is too busy being stunned by the sight of Feathers to notice; the single ebony wing stretching nearly to the top corner of the cabin. He begins to notice when he sees blue-white sparks shooting between the iridescent feathers, blue eyes appearing to glow and flash in the dimming light. Tearing his eyes away, he glances up at the sky to see sparse clouds beginning to form, blocking the sun - and then dissipate almost as quickly as Feathers pulled the wing back in. As he did so, he seemed to shrink back into himself, and Dean ran to him as he began to topple over, catching him before he fell onto his injured wing.
He’s so lost in his thoughts, he startles when he feels Lee’s hand on his arm. “Don’t worry, darlin’. You’ll get your revenge.”
Castiel’s resolve slips and with a soft sigh, his lips part for Dean’s tongue. Dean groans against his lips, his hand sliding from the tie to Castiel’s jaw, tilting his head and kissing him harder; then Castiel is being pushed backward and up against the wall, Dean’s hand moving behind his head to protect it while the other grasps his waist to pull him in tighter. The unmistakable hard line of his erection presses against Castiel and he gasps against Dean’s mouth. Dean hums and breaks the kiss, lipping down to Castiel’s neck and rolling his hips, eliciting another gasp.
“Okay, so you’re not in jail, unless part of your incarceration includes torture by screaming children,” Sam jokes. “Hold on, putting you on speaker too.” A slight crackle over the phone as Sam switches over, then a chair sliding on the bunker floor. “Eileen is here, says hi.”
Dean grins up at his (not so) baby brother and claps him on the shoulder. “C’mon, let’s get my bag and get outta here.”
, a favorite Zep tune — foot tapping to the beat as he plunges his hands into a bowl filled with ground chuck, eggs, panko crumbs, and Worcestershire sauce. The cool meat squishes delightfully through his fingers as he mixes the ingredients — and then curses softly to himself, glancing over his shoulder at the counter where the spices he meant to add to the meat are gathered, mocking him.
Cas returns to his bench and reaches to either side, hands held out to Dean and Jack, and Dean is surprised to realize he can reach Cas’ hand easily, the fire bright but small enough for them to do so without being too close. As his hand clasps around Cas’, he gasps as a jolt of energy, like the spark of static electricity, passes between them; and then again as his other hand joins with Sam’s.
The light swirled and coalesced around the bed, and a bright flash burst over it, Sam and Cas throwing their arms up to shield their eyes. As the light dissipated, they lowered their arms and turned to face the bed, blinking away the spots and the smoke.
Roman continues to stare at Dean, and then his mouth splits into a shark’s grin. “You must have thought I was bluffing, didn’t you, Mr. Winchester?”
She snorts. “Shoulda guessed.” Her eyes meet his, clear green eyes calculating. “Seriously though, you’re a great player. Just that one unlucky hand, but I think you have him now.”
He slides the blade into its sheath, tosses the rag aside and closes the trunk lid before fetching the phone out. The corners of his mouth twitch in exasperated amusement when he sees the name on the screen and pushes the button to answer. “Hey, Sammy.  So impatient. Just finished the vamp hunt and was cleaning up...”
“Cas?” Dean rises and reaches for him, Castiel grasping his shoulder to help steady him. “Sweetheart, are you okay?”
Castiel looks down at his clenched hands, noticing he’s been subconsciously wringing them. “I...I’m not sure what to do about his advances.”
While he’s not a vain man, he knows how good he looks in a tux. But how he looked in one before is a
No sooner has he finished swallowing the bite than Cas has him on his back in front of the log, mouth on his and licking the sweetness from it; his body warm and firm against his, and Dean can’t stifle the moan that follows.
When Dean had proposed the road trip, he really hadn’t planned the route out. All he cared about at the time was getting the hell outta Dodge before he went insane from boredom.
And then just as suddenly, the sun darts behind a cloud, the bees scatter and fly away, and it’s Cas, the love of Dean’s life, who turns to stare at him, the look of joy and wonder still shining on his face.
Sure enough, the sweet smell of caramelizing meat was beginning to edge toward the bitter smell of carbon. Dean pushes Cas’ fingers aside just enough to drop a quick peck to his lips. “Raincheck,” he says, grinning, and turns quickly to the grill to check the burgers.
Sam’s hair, usually smooth and flowing, was shaggy and coarse from many hours of being pulled and tugged at in frustration or distraction. Dark circles shadowed the underside of his eyes from not enough sleep and too much caffeine. Their hazel color appeared to blaze in their sockets in contrast. Those eyes were now wide, his cheeks flushed in excitement as he jammed the book he was holding into Castiel’s hands, his finger jabbing at a page full of Rowena’s flowing script….
Sam grins at her smirk. “I know, I know. But,” he slides his phone across the table, his Messages app open. “I got a text from Donna saying they somehow ran into Dean and Cas at a winery in Napa.”
The dealer saves him the indignity of passing out at the table. “I believe this is a good time to take a short break, if there are no disagreements?”
“Well… I hate to say it but… he did what he came for. Maybe he had another prayer come in or something…”
Cas stands and slides into Dean’s chair, straddling his lap; his long fingers wrapping around the nape of Dean’s neck and the soft hair curling there, the other cupping his cheek before crushing his lips against Dean’s, tongue flicking against his lips until Dean sucks it in with a soft, needy moan.
Castiel’s head jerks up to shoot a glare in Sam’s direction, puzzled at his recent behavior. Sam is fully aware of his affections for Dean, and it is not like him to be callous or cruel, making light of other’s feelings, and yet… The look on Sam’s face gives him pause; his face is open and honest, and even… exasperated?
funny, don’t you?” Cas growls over his shoulder as Dean approaches. “A stupid… arrogant… teenage prank.” Reaching the elevators, he jabs the button fiercely and spins back around to face Dean. “Did you think your arrogance would impress me?”
Dean’s stomach decides to rumble again at that moment, and Kevin grins. “Food. Right. On it!” Dean grins back as the kid turns and runs back the way he came.
Cas was deathly still, not speaking, his focus on the doll in his hands. Sam took a closer look at the doll, and realized the horrible truth.
“What do you mean, I was a hunk of plastic?” he sputtered to Sam. “I thought the witch just shrank me?” He looked first at Sam, then turned to Cas, and felt a wave of apprehension wash over him.
Lifelike tendrils of flame reach out to lick at the crowns, snaking through the antler-like branches like fiery fingers, caressing and exploring. Slowly though, entropy takes over and the crowns ignite, the fingers of flame turning each of them ethereal, shining bright in golds and oranges and reds.
Sam guffawed. “You know, I never thought about that!” He looked down at Dean, trying not to laugh at his brother’s tiny chipmunk cheeks as he stuffed the “fries” in his mouth hungrily. “So, where are you going to sleep?”
But he has one consolation - as long as he can still feel the small flame of warmth; and the tightness, the pull - wherever Cas is, Dean knows he’s still alive.
Dean finally gets the waiter’s attention, motions signing, and the waiter nods. While Dean waits for the check, his eyes are drawn to the view through the window overlooking the front of the casino —
“You need to warm up or you’ll catch a cold,” Castiel says, gently pushing him under the spray, and begins to close the shower door when Dean’s hand grasps his wrist.
The memory of some of the things that have come after him before setting up the dreamcatchers are fresh in both their memories, so Dean doesn’t get too annoyed with Rufus’ reminders.
“Water would be helpful, I think,” Dean nods and rushes to the kitchen, filling up a glass and returning, sitting on the couch next to Castiel and handing it to him. Castiel takes a long drink from the glass and sighs in appreciation, leaning his head back against the back of the couch and closing his eyes.
“Like hell I do.” Dean makes another grab at the note and manages to snatch it away. He reads it and breathes a sigh of relief, throwing a glare at Cas. The sonofabitch is still chuckling at his little joke.
He then realized something else - Cas and his brother had not returned from their shopping trip. Glancing at his watch, he noticed they’d been gone for almost ten hours.
“Babe, can you dig into the tape box and grab a new tape?” He grins. “Believe it or not, I can only listen to Zepp 4 so many times in a row.”
Dean can’t help himself - he outright guffaws. “No, no cyanide, why would I… I mean, we’re making a detour, stopping somewhere here in Seattle before heading south.”
He spreads the sweet smelling oil over his hand, and reaches in between their bodies to grab both of their cocks, coating them in the oil, and begins to stroke.
“Like a million bucks.” Dean glances back over, his eyes wide. “Did you stay all night?” Castiel nods, timidly, worried over Dean’s reaction to the admission, but Dean’s eyes go soft. “I’m sorry, that must have been boring as hell.”
In the meantime, Dean has pored through every book in the library, and is now in the storage room (slash dungeon) to rifle through the boxes and boxes of files there.
But Ellen, now the head of the AMoL in Bobby’s place, shakes her head. “We can’t, Dean. He’s too high-profile.” She sighs. “I’m going to have to bring the British Men of Letters in on this,” she says, dismissing them as she picks up the phone to place a call to her counterpart in London, Lady Antonia Bevell.
They passed art galleries, antique and collectible stores, restaurants, and bars in historic buildings, but when they passed the "Historic 6th Street -  Amarillo Route 66" sign, Cas excitedly gripped Dean's arm, blue eyes bright.
They don’t land on him; instead, one by one, they fly close and then dart away, as if sensing something wonderful and strange that must be investigated. Cas stands perfectly still, a look of pure joy on his face, and Dean’s breath catches in his chest.
Cas approached the row of the hunter’s figurines and brushed a finger over each, then gently picked one, cradling it in his hands and brought it over to Sam.
But — this is everything he’s ever wanted and never thought he could have. And Dean is the happiest Castiel has ever seen him. Should he really deny Dean — or himself — this happiness?
“Dean, there’s more…” Sam hesitates, putting on the speakerphone and taking a breath before continuing. ”We’re at the coroner’s right now, and they’ve determined he was asleep when he died.” A tickle of an idea begins to churn in Dean’s brain but denial keeps it away until Sam says, “His room was completely undisturbed when the motel manager found him. Seems like your call concerned him enough to make a wellness check and he found Rufus early this morning.” Dean heard Sam’s voice catch, causing his own heart to stutter in his chest. “He… he was torn to shreds, blood all over the bed - but nothing else was touched. No blood trail to the door or any of the windows.”
Dean really means to respond, but the purr of his Baby’s engine and the after-effects of sleeping pills take their toll; the next thing he knows, Sam is pulling into the garage of the Men of Letters bunker, located in bucolic Lebanon, Kansas, and the seat of the Science and Research Department.
“No, listen to me,” Sam said earnestly. “I think we should try it on one of the other hunters first.”
TV reception was not the greatest way out here, even with satellite, but he managed to find an old Clint Eastwood film. “Oh, hell yeah.” He pours a little more of the whiskey and settles back on the couch to enjoy.
But it must have been meant to be, the ranger in charge of Special Events at the Cabrillo National Monument telling them that they were in luck as a wedding had just canceled at the last minute and the venue would be available... three days from now.
Gathering the first aid supplies again, he heads over to the fireplace and kneels down next to the bird, whose head turns to him as he approaches.
.  He raised a querying look to Sam. “This is a children’s book, Sam. How is this going to help Dean?”
Dean, eyes closed, hand clenching the nape of Cas’ neck and fingers buried in his hair, Cas’ tongue tasting every inch of his mouth, reached blindly for the lube in his bedside table. Finding it, he broke the kiss and gasped into Cas’ ear, “Move with me, babe…”, pushing with his leg to roll them until they were side by side, giving Dean the space to reach between them.
Needless to say, Castiel was shattered. All Sonny, the head counselor, would tell him was that Dean had been called away and had to leave immediately.
And then, the most incredible thing - Dean’s voice, broken and shaking, echoing in his head.  Dean was
He heard Sam emerge from the garage behind him, heard him enter the library, and the slight thud and scrape of the box as it was placed on the table next to the first. He heard Sam come up next to him, felt him place a comforting hand on his shoulder - but he didn’t look up from Dean’s shiny plastic face.
Dean nods. “He did, but he got it on the last card. He was bluffing his ass off the rest of the time.” He leans in, pretending to nuzzle at Cas’ neck. “When he dropped that big raise, he didn’t have shit. He was trying to scare me out.”
Cas scans the passports, then picks up the note, the corners of his lips turning down and his left eyebrow shooting up into his hairline.
Dean lurched back as if slapped, hand pulling away from Castiel’s, leaving it cold in the absence of Dean’s warmth. Wrapping around his own glass, Dean downed the whiskey and set the glass back down on the bar, eyes averted.
It was Dean’s turn to roll his eyes this time, though he couldn’t keep the lightness out of the action.
After overhearing Cas and Jacks conversation about the Empty deal in the kitchen, Dean is conflicted.
“You sure like that thing huh.” He tried sounding casual and light, but affection and a hint of pride seeped through his voice.
Cas sighed loudly, interrupting the back and forth. He tilted his head towards Dean shooting him a pleading look.
Their eyes remained locked together for a moment longer until finally, Cas looked away. Dean instantly missed the connection.
Cas glanced over at Sam again, who was stifling a yawn. His phone buzzed in his hands. He ignored it for the time being.
“You tried to convince us Jack got sick last minute but only made a booking for two in the first place! Your plan sucked.” Dean exclaimed, throwing his hands up in the air incredulously.
What are you doing, what are you doing, what are you doing? Alarms went off in Deans head. Why would he ask that? It was out before he had the chance to stop it. He braced himself.
Despite the subject change, the energy in the room had once again transformed as it had in the kitchen the other day. It seemed to be happening more and more.
Amusement simmered behind his eyes, and Sam wondered what he was finding funny. From Sam’s point of view, it wasn’t funny at all. In fact, it was a disaster. His and Jack’s plan to get the two to admit their feelings for one another had majorly backfired.
Sam continued to gawk at Cas. “Thanks for the salad, Cas, but,” he points at the burger and fries Dean is quickly devouring, and stammers, “H-how?”.
Sam nods. “Yeah, THE Colt. Samuel Colt’s gun.” He closes the lid with a snap as Dean begins to reach for it, and pulls the box back. “There’re very few things it can’t kill,” Sam pauses, his gaze landing on Castiel, whose eyes have gone very, very wide. “Leviathan aren’t among them.”
above the right nipple? He fights the urge to taste it, to lick the nearby bud until it hardens, and to discover what an angel’s moan sounds like.
? His track record with relationships so far doesn’t give him much in the way of confidence. And even worse, just blurting out the question like that…
“Hey, look at me.” Cas’ eyes open, and for the first time Dean sees the vulnerability there. It makes him want to pull him close and protect him forever. “Definitely
As he closes the door behind him and turns to the interior of the cabin, a glint of amber and blue catches the corner of his eye - a beam of light from the setting sun shining through the kitchen window and glancing off a bottle of Johnny Walker Blue Label, and Dean’s lonely evening is suddenly looking up.
It has everything to do with how it makes him feel - like he could leap and soar over that endless blue. Like he could fly again.
But it’s too late. Dick Roman’s body explodes in a gush of black ooze, throwing Dean backward through the air.
thing you mentioned.” He tips a finger to the brim of an imaginary hat and opens the door. “Or maybe I’m just smarter than you think.” He steps out into the hallway and turns to close the door. Just before it closes, he sees Toni notice the laptop, lid still ajar, then her gaze turns back to him. He grins and waves through the crack as the door closes.
“OH GOD PLEASE STOP,” Sam begged, and it was then Dean noticed the strap lying diagonally across Sam’s chest, and what appeared to be a -- scabbard? -- attached to it, and the Wonderland book in his hand. Gently prying Cas’ hands from his hips but keeping hold of one, he pulled away and strode toward him, Cas in tow behind him.
The room door opens again, and Dean first hears the dull thud of a duffle bag dropping to the floor, followed by the rustle of fabric against plastic — the garment bag with their “Fed Suits” — moving past him. Castiel’s footsteps retreating in the direction of the closet. The closet door squeaks open, the garment bag’s hanger clinks on the hanger rod, the door squeaking closed again; then Castiel is behind him, fingers running through his hair and around to brush his cheek. Dean leans into the touch, barely breathing.
Moaning at the pounding in his head as he stands, he shambles over to the coffee pot to make some liquid fortitude.
Gentle fingers pry at his hand clenched around the belt end, loosening his grip on it to remove the belt restraint and drop it to the floor, then lowering his arms to his chest and massaging his wrists and fingers.
He dreamed of the argument with Dean after Rowena’s death, where he had lashed out and wondered why everything that had gone wrong always seemed to be something Castiel had a hand in. How Dean had pushed him away, and Castiel had left, feeling every bit to blame for being incapable of keeping the people Dean loved safe.
Castiel pulls the final vestiges of his resolve together, managing to get his hands to Dean’s chest and weakly pushing him back. “Dean,” he pants, “we have to stop.”
better now,” he says softly, his breath ghosting against Castiel’s lips and sending a shiver down his spine.
Dean’s spark was dimming more and more every day, and Castiel had no idea how to stop it. Resting seemed to slow it down, but it was apparent that it was Dean’s state of consciousness that seemed to be draining him faster than the hunters who were still in stasis.
“I thought you said he was a thunderbird,” Sam asks, and Dean hears him shuffling book pages in the background.
Instead, he nuzzles into the soft hair at Cas’ temple, placing a light brush of lips there. “Time to call it a day, sweetheart,” he says softly in his ear. “The troops are fading.” As if to prove his point, Jack nods off again, almost sinking on top of Miracle this time, and Dean can’t stop a chuckle. “As I was saying…”
“I’ll meet you up in the room,” he breathes against Dean’s lips, then turns, heading to the restaurant’s exit and the lobby beyond.
Castiel reached Dean’s room and opened the door, crossing over to the bed to lay Dean’s prone form on the pillow, covering him with the blanket. Dean sighed and rolled over, pulling the blanket around him, settling in.
Dean stares at him, then shakes his head, chuckling, as Cas turns back to the TV as if there is nothing at all strange about taking an empty pizza box to the dumpster. Picking up his bottle, he drains it, then grabs Cas’ empty, dumping them in the trash on his way to the bathroom to brush his teeth.
Dean tosses his carry-on into the overhead bin and settles into his seat with a sigh.  Thankfully the early morning flight from Chicago to Kansas City is mostly empty and he has the whole row to himself. The first thing he does is to reach across to close the window shade, then closes his eyes and waits for the benzos he popped before boarding the plane to kick in.
Dean looked down at the ring in his hands. And then looked up at the ceiling helplessly, wiping at his face. “I forgot- I forgot to get down on one knee.” He mumbled, groaning dramatically.
He attempted to sound light and understanding, but even he could hear how pathetic that last sentence sounded. At least they were nearly back to the bunker. He could escape the awkward conversation soon enough.
“Cas? Dean? Are you in there? I’m about to open this door so please just- Okay I’m opening the door now. You’ve been warned!” He began to slowly open the door to Dean’s room. Before he could open it all the way a voice behind him startled him.
“That’s what my coworkers call it, is that not how you use it?” The accompanying head tilt was nothing short of adorable. Dean let himself think that without immediately slamming it behind some door in his head.
It took a moment for the rib connection to click, but then, Sam suddenly coughed out in disbelief. “Wait. You mean Adam as in- Adam and Eve?”
“Oh it’s- it was a gift” Cas replied, his gruff voice almost reading as shy. Sam couldn’t gauge why.
Cas seemed less concerned about that last matter, much to Dean’s constant dismay. Jack and Sam would give him knowing looks each time the two argued about it. He hadn’t talked to Jack about, well, knowing about anything beyond the bare minimum details of the deal. But the kid was wise for his years. He picked things up.
Dean’s frown washed away, and he straightened up. “Oh. Um- Good. Nice. Thanks.” He nodded awkwardly. For some reason, he felt more nervous. It’s not like he hadn’t had dinner with Cas before. Hell, they’d spent more time together in the previous weeks than they had in a long time. But still, he couldn’t help the unexplainable nerves.
“Wait.” Before she could elaborate, Cas called out from behind Dean. Everyone turned to look at him. Billie raised a brow.
He immediately sighed at the thought and internally swore. Why was he so scared to admit it even in his own head?
At that, he pulled the two men in front of him into his arms. They both yelped out as he crushed them in his hug. “Sammy, I can’t breathe.” Dean yelped out dramatically.
“I said the plan was decent, but it seems that I’ll have to perfect it on my own.” She surveyed them all. “You boys continue on collecting what we need. I’ll return when I have more information for you.”
“Okay fine. But if I must, then you have to as well.” He raised his brows tauntingly, waiting for Dean to drop the matter.
Dean walked back to the Impala where Sam waited while chastising himself internally. He was feeling a little sorry for himself.
Dean swallowed the lump in his throat. He looked out at the road ahead and spotted a clear patch of dirt off the side of the highway. He had to do this face to face.
Hell, if she had been flirting with Cas, that was a good thing. Human experiences and all, he reminded himself. Just because that was his friend didn’t mean he got to keep him all to himself.
His throat felt like it was tightening, and his heart rate was alarming, but he pushed through; determined. His eyes didn’t leave the floor in front of him.
“The blonde chick, she seemed pretty cozy.” He huffed out a strained laugh. “She was whispering something to you.” He attempted to keep the possessiveness out of his tone.
“I guess I’m just not cut out for some human leisure activities” Cas suggested too innocuously, with an out of character shrug. Sam did not seem satiated, though he let it go for the moment, reaching over to grab another slice of pizza.
He had gotten some much needed answers from their talk, about his mother... He hated to admit it but there was clarity and logic to Amara’s reasoning. Still, the rage inside him bubbled.
Dean nodded in acknowledgement. Thank God for that. Turns out having Sam around had been serving as quite the anti-awkwardness buffer with all the weirdness he and Cas had going on lately. Dean hadn't necessarily realised that until the overgrown Sasquatch had left on this last hunt.
“Sounds great.” He paused for effect, allowing a smile to form on Sam’s face, before looking over and saying the rest to Cas. “In fact, I already saw the case yesterday and sent it off to a hunting couple we know.” He pointedly looked over at Sam whose expression had fallen.
The day’s preparations hadn’t gone the greatest, to say the least. The only thing which had gone smoothly all day had been Claire getting Dean out of the house. He had almost burst into tears on the spot when she’d called and asked for a ‘father-daughter day’, though he wouldn’t admit it. Sam did now owe her for quote ‘dragging her into that cheesy shit’, but if he didn’t know any better he’d say she was just as happy about it as Dean was. After that though, one thing after another had gone wrong, and this was the icing on the cake- pie- whatever.
Sam and Dean were about to hopefully go find Amara and get her on their side, and Jack and Billie’s plan seemed to be progressing... whatever it was. Things weren’t going terribly.
Cas didn't say it, but Dean could tell not having his powers anymore got to him more than he let on. When he first became human he'd commented more than once on his lack of usefulness. Dean had shut it down immediately.
This left Cas and Dean looking at each other and then back at Jack’s retreating form concernedly for a moment. Ultimately, Dean shrugged and began to head over to the kitchen while Castiel eyed him incredulously.
“Dean… you realise… you know Cas knows how to drive right? He literally has a car.” He may have been suppressing the smirk which was so clearly fighting to show on his face, however, he couldn’t keep the humour out of his tone.
Before Sam could say anything more Dean walked up to the car and slid into the drivers seat. Sam silently followed parallel to him.
Jack was staring at the pair on the floor with concern. However, it was Dean who spoke up, glaring faintly at Sam for a moment before he did so.
“Does this mean I’m still winning?” Jack interjected, a wide grin on his face. While the kid wasn’t a sore loser by any means, he did seem to receive unbridled joy whenever he was in the lead during any of their game nights. It wasn’t so much the winning that seemed to cause this, as much as it was impressing his dads. Sam made sure to always respond with enthusiasm at each of Jack’s wins.
But there was a nagging, restless feeling in him. It just wasn’t right. Everything was fixed, the world was back to normal, Sam and Eileen had a steady thing going. After Chuck had taken her away they were taking things slow (again) but he could tell his brother was happy. Jody and the girls were alright. The boys had paid them a visit as soon as Jack brought everyone back. All of their people were back. Safe. All except one-
Cas seemed to notice his growing panic, because he stepped up and placed a calming hand on his shoulder. Slowly, as if he expected Dean to step away.
“Yeah I wanted to- I was ready to give up after that.” Dean looked away as he said it, not wanting to see the expression on Cas’ face. “I was gonna let myself die.”
Dean glanced back at the shirts, heat rising to his cheeks. His frustration suddenly replaced by nerves. It was fine. It wasn’t anything to be embarrassed about, he reassured himself.
“You should be nicer to your brother” Cas chastised lightly, snapping him out of his thoughts. He smiled at Dean as they walked up to the car together.
So much for the not mad thing. Now he was trying to get rid of him. Right? Why else would he suggest Dean leave with Sam? Up until now, he’d never had anything to say about how often Dean had been skipping out on out of town hunts.
Dean chuckled out again, his voice as strained as ever. “Crazy huh- I mean thinking we- Can you imagine?”
He sat outside in the Impala. Rain beating down above and around him. He’d been praying to... well, the only being he ever prayed to. He’d been doing that a lot lately, unsure if his prayers were being heard, but unable to stop himself. He’d talk about how Sam and Eileen were doing, he told Cas about how Claire had been during their visit, he told him about Jack, he told him about Miracle, he spoke of everything, except the most important thing. He just. Couldn’t. Not like this. Not with him gone.
He glanced at his phone for the fifth time since Sam had started explaining the hunt he’d found. Something about potential werewolves... or shapeshifters... maybe he’d said vampires. Whatever.
His eyes scanned over the room. The guns on the walls, the book on the dresser, the vinyl collection, the pictures of family on his desk. It was as meticulous and clean as ever but still lived in, with a few items scattered haphazardly on the desk next to which Castiel stood.
Before he knew it, his feet had carried him through the bunker, and he stood outside Cas’ door with his hand raised, ready to knock.
“Amara. She said the Empty can’t take you if you’re a human.” He replied, tentative. He was filled with anxiety in anticipation of Cas’ reaction to the idea.
“Yeah, man. I didn’t want you to go.” Dean huffed out a chuckle, but it was forced. He felt self-conscious admitting it.
Dean stood silent for a moment, opening and closing his mouth in search of a response. He hadn’t whipped out all the bells and whistles, sure. But he hadn’t wanted to overwhelm the guy on his first date for crying out loud. He turned to Cas defensively as he tried to speak.
“I’m not trying to have sex with you while our entire family is only metres away.” Cas stepped up to him. “I wanted to give you your birthday gift.”
He had been attempting to teach Cas various nuances as well as life skills that would be useful to him as a human. However, he figured learning how to use air quotes correctly wasn’t high on the list of priorities for the time being. They had other things they were working on still.
He decided he could cope with being the third wheel if it meant more of that and less of the pain. They deserved it.
As the moment passed Dean wiped a hand over his eyes quickly. “Argh. Enough of that.” He cleared his throat. “Now tell me. Were you serious about retiring?”
Cas looked up at him with soft eyes. They were tender. Comforting. But Dean still felt the room closing in around him.
That would imply that this was a conversation she’d had with Cas before. Hell, based on what she’d said earlier, that a lot of Cas’ coworkers had with him before.
Cas’ eyes finally shifted to Dean, he tilted his head. His voice was cautious and defensive as he replied.
The conversation with Amara had gone better than expected. Yes, they’d had to lie to her. But if this is what it took to get rid of Chuck then so be it. Or at least that’s how Dean was attempting to justify it to himself.
Dean begrudgingly walked over and sat down in front of him. He shoved his hand into the cereal box and started absentmindedly chewing on the sugary shapes.
But more importantly, even if they could. It wouldn’t be Dean; he was too broken in the parts Cas was good.
“Cas I-“ He gulped. “I heard you and Jack talking in the kitchen the other day. About a deal? With the Empty?” Dean managed to keep his tone balanced and serious. Giving nothing away.
Sam stared back at him blankly, his mouth slightly ajar. He shook his head in wonder before speaking.
Finally, when the emotion prickling at Dean’s eyes started to get dangerously noticeable, he coughed.
Cas tilted his head with a frown. At that, a hint of a smile graced Dean’s face, his eyes brightening at the expression, and his initial words trailing off.
And it’s done! I hope you enjoyed this lighthearted little fic, it’s probably not the best written but I had fun with the concept!
He wasn’t sure what Cas heard in his voice, but at that he finally opened his eyes and turned his head over to Dean. He studied him for a moment. Dean could feel his gaze piercing the side of his head. He attempted to keep his expression neutral, but he kept slipping into a frown.
“Dean made you a mixtape?” He asked slowly. There was humour in his tone for reasons Cas didn’t understand.
“Promise me you’ll come back man.” Dean replied, taken aback and almost embarrassed at how desperate he sounded. He felt too vulnerable. He felt like ruining the moment with anger, with humour, something. But he couldn’t do it right now. He was just so tired. He was tired of hiding.
“No but- What about the songs, what did you- Like all of it. What did you think it meant?” He had no idea what he was doing or why, but he was being pulled further and further down this path.
While as an angel he was far removed, and too other to care for Dean in that way, as a human he could probably see all his flaws up close. See what better options he had too.
“I guess it could work.” He squinted at Dean. “But I need my grace- or whatever of it remains to find a way to save Jack.” He finished carefully.
He threw his arm over the back of their seats as he reversed. He ignored the way his hand brushed against the top of his friend’s hair gently. The way his fingers twitched slightly against it before he moved his arm away.
How Dean wished to wipe that stupid smirk off his face. He eyed the book laying by him on the map table for a moment, considering if it would cause any significant damage if it were... say... lobbed at his brother’s head.
“Cas. I know you said Sam and Dean don’t need to know about it. But- but what if the Empty does come for you? What will I tell them? What will I do without you?” Jack questioned, his voice soft, confused.
“There’s something I didn’t get to ask you, when you were here. You uh- you brought everyone back but- Cas. I dunno, part of me thought we’d get back to the bunker after you left and he’d be there or somethin.” He felt awkward, silly. His voice tinged with uncertainty.
Jack and Sam stayed seated at the table, though they’d stopped pretending to be paying attention to the laptops in front of them a while back.
