Tony, who had felt his eyelids start to droop before F.R.I.D.A.Y. had spoke, suddenly felt wide awake, his insides feeling so cold despite the heat of the room and a feeling of dread deep inside at the thought of hearing that voice again, the voice he had not listened to since the voicemail had been played last to him only a day before, the voicemail of one Captain Steve Rogers that the man had left him almost six months ago.
At least that's what Tony still liked to tell himself, the reality itself was much worse as he had first come to miss the extra body heat in his bed, he missed going to sleep feeling relaxed whilst his arms would curl around Steve's waist, Steve resting his chin on the top of Tony's head, both of them not needing to move an inch, he missed waking up during the night, trying to break out of a nightmare to find Steve already awake as if alerted, eyes looking at him with concern as he held Tony's chin softly in his hands, getting Tony to breathe with him, softly uttering to him that it was all going to be okay, it had just been a nightmare and in the end just letting him cry it all out all over his chest.
Telling F.R.I.D.A.Y. once again just to go ahead and save the message, Tony turned onto his other side, away from anything as he placed his head softly down onto the pillow, that in the past had been a part of Captain America, the pillow that he had slept on each night without fail and left behind an amazing smell of coffee, Gucci aftershave and something that was just Steve. Even to this day the pillow still smelt like the Captain, it still had the lingering scent of Steve and there was even a small bit of blood from where Steve had once bled onto it after thinking his nose was okay when someone had punched him.
With a quiet word of agreement, his A.I. went silent for a few moments before a very loud buzzing sound began to fill the air, as Tony understood that she was looking through all of his records trying to find the information that Tony had asked for, she would need to access files that Tony had originally put blocks onto until he would allow them to be accessed and from there she would then need to find the right frequency to play the voicemail.
But now she had just crossed a line. Tony could understand someone telling him that he was acting childish for staying in his bed and not doing anything but to hear the words that 'Captain America' wasn't as upset about their breakup as he was, well that shouldn't be allowed, Captain Rogers should be just as upset as he was, if not more, just because that smiling ass-hole acted like he didn't care about anything, that didn't mean that he was the same.
Steve seemed to tilt his head quizzically to the side after Tony spoke, looking almost like Tony had told him that he had carrots for arms instead of making fun of the super soldiers way of speaking but then the other man seemed to smile, as if he had understood it.
Tony's hand darted up to clutch at the metal outline of his arc reactor, feeling the outer casing, taking in deeps breaths as he tried to recall to himself that he had a reason for doing this, he wasn't crazy, he had done the right thing, right?
"You have me. That's one but also you have a big group of friends who believe in you and know that you can do it too. But most important of all, despite all of your best efforts to deny the thought, you have courage Tony, more so than what I had."
And now Tony couldn't help but see that Steve had probably done the right thing by cutting him loose when he had before he could have gotten any worse and maybe hurt Steve one day, that was one thing that Tony knew he would never had been able to forgive himself for, if he had ever hurt Steve which he could guess in a way he had but... Ugh the light was messing with his brain.
That very reason, no thing, no whatever it had been had stood less than an inch away from Steve, curled into a slight ball, holding his stomach whilst a large gash in his head had split open again after Tony had punched him in the face from earlier, blood had been running down one side of his cheek and that thing had not even cared, 'Good' Tony had thought to himself despite the lack of reaction he had received from the man who had been standing behind Steve, 'he deserves to feel the pain that I have felt all these years.'
"You had better not be about to say something so incredibly corny right about now Mr Rogers or else I will throw you right back into this ice."
"Everyone's looking for you to give a speech and I don't know about you but the Tony Stark I know never shy's away from talking about himself."
"You have nothing to be worried about. I know how it can be to go up on a stage, not knowing how people are going to react but you have something that I never had."
"You're right. But I guess just the thought of making a speech not as Tony Stark, son of world famous Howard Stark but just as plain old Tony Stark. It's nerve wracking."
He should have never turned his eyes away from that other thing, shouldn't have let his eyes fall onto Steve's own, the very same Steve who had ended up being the one who had lied to him all those years, Steve who had always had been as much to blame as everyone else had been.
Iron Man tried to nudge one of the kittens - the smallest one - carefully with his finger, but right as he touched the little creature, it swatted his finger with its paw and hissed. Iron Man let out a little
It came out so suddenly. Tony clamped his mouth shut, like he just let out the biggest secret of his life. And it most likely was. Steve, for sure, had not expected that. And while they both sat in silence, processing everything that had just happened, everything started to finally make sense to Steve.
Tony was silent for a second. “Not really. Take care of the kittens, that’ll help enough.”Steve frowned. He understood Iron Man’s need for privacy, but if he was ill, he should accept help. And Steve was more than ready to offer help. It was the least he could do at the moment.
Steve huffed out a laugh and shook his head again. He did actually kind of hope that the situation was something like that, because at least then he would have an actually good reason to bother Iron Man. Even though it looked like he was delighted to see the kittens, Steve knew that Iron Man had other things to do.
“Yes,” Tony says, heart fluttering strangely in his chest. “Yes, I’d… that would be nice, thank you.”
Tony reaches over for a package of wet wipes from the night stand, uses one to quickly wipe the come off Steve's belly. He can't reach Steve's hole to clean him there, but Steve doesn't mind. He likes having Tony's come in him for a little while.
“Tony,” Steve says, rolling onto his own side to face Tony and staring directly into Tony’s eyes. He takes a deep breath, like he’s trying to fortify himself. “Tony, seriously. This thing we have going on? This isn’t just…. It means a lot to me.”
Steve pushes his finger all the way inside Stark’s burning heat, then slides back out and in again, basking in the feeling of Stark’s slick hot walls.
Steve thrusts up, trying to fuck as deeply as he can into Tony’s body, panting with the effort and groaning with pleasure. Tony looks like a god above him, golden and warm and lost to pleasure as he fucks himself down on Steve’s cock.
“Oh, my good boy,” Tony says, grabbing hold of the back of Steve’s head and pushing his cock in, deep as he can, and Steve chokes a little on it, but his lips stay slack and he pushes himself forward to take Tony further, all the way into his throat, until his nose is pressed against Tony’s pubic hair. Tony holds them there, letting his cock choke Steve for a long moment, before he pulls back and lets Steve take a deep, gasping breath. His whole chest heaves with it, expanding and lifting off the spanking bench, muscles pulling in his arms.
After watching Tony’s expression for another moment to make sure he’s floating in the very best subspace, Steve moves to unwrap the suspension ropes from their tethers on the wall, and gently lowers Tony to the floor. He steps forward and methodically unties him, undoing loops upon loops of soft, red rope. Tony’s skin is striped pink from it, from the gentle pressure of the ropes, from his own struggling before he’d finally given in to his subspace.
He pets at Steve’s hair for a moment, gentling him down to centre them both. “What’s your safeword, Steve?”
He opens it, and Tony’s eyes widen slightly, his awareness raising a little, as he stares. Inside the bag had been a black dildo – nothing special looking, except for the tube protruding from the flat end of it, attached to a rubber bulb.
“Look at you, honey,” Tony murmurs, thrusting slowly between Steve’s lips. Steve feels like he’s floating, like everything is soft and warm and light. Everything is
Tony’s hand spasms, fingers digging into Steve’s hip, and he moans as that tight heat envelopes him again and again.
Steve moans louder this time, panting through his nose even as the sound is muffled by the panties in his mouth. Tony breaches him with a third finger, and his other hand wraps itself around Steve's cock, hard and hot and leaking at the tip.
Steve pulls away after a moment, and as Tony’s hole is left empty, he whines a little, out of control.
Steve swallows before he answers, and already his voice sounds a little calmer, just from Tony’s fingertips brushing across his scalp. “Red.”
He sighs as Steve’s hand strokes him, using Tony’s own pre-come to slick the way, slow and steady. “Two,” Tony says.
The phone buzzes again. And again. And again and again. It's clearly a phone call – Steve pulls it out of his pocket while pretending to ignore that everyone is turning to stare at him. He glances down, just for a second, and sees that yes, it is Tony calling.
Steve looks at him again, and Tony meets his eyes. He can tell Steve is looking for another way to decline, but suddenly it seems very important that Steve get to taste chocolate, at least once in his life. Whatever he’d done to land himself here, to indenture himself to the government like this… the ones with augmentations, like the Sub with the cybernetic arm he’d seen, they made sense. The price of an arm like that, hundreds of thousands of credits, was hard to come by for a normal man. That man was here in the facility specifically to pay for the debt incurred by that arm. It made sense.
Steve didn’t even have to explain the situation to Iron Man, before he agreed to come over and help out. It felt great to know that he had a friend ready to help him out, even in the middle of the night, but Steve couldn’t help but feel like he was bothering Iron Man.
And so he ended up in this situation. Sitting on a sofa at the Avengers Mansion’s living room, a box full of meowing kittens on his lap.
The next day he immediately took the kittens to the vet. According to the veterinarian, they were all slightly or incredibly underweight. One of them, the smallest of the bunch, had the worst condition. It had fleas, like all of the other kittens, too, but apparently those had worsened its condition more. A black and white colored kitten had an eye infection, but fortunately it could be treated with the right eye drops.
Steve understood that, of course. The kittens were small, smaller than the palm of his hand. Even he was afraid to genuinely touch them. He couldn’t blame Iron Man.
And there it was. Now he had said it. Steve finally voiced it out loud, admitting that he loved Iron Man. And it felt great, freeing even.
After Walter had bitten Steve enough and exhausted himself, he just decided to lay down on the table. Steve took this as an opportunity to look at the other kittens on the kitchen floor. Steve had noticed that ever since their conditions had gone for the better, their personalities had also begun to grow more individual. Dorothy was more playful, and liked to bite everything. Steve had woken up many times from his sleep at night, because Dorothy liked to chew on his nose. Charlie was the opposite of Dorothy. He was the easiest one to manage, because he slept most of the day. Charlie especially liked to curl up right next to Iron Man, which was quite sweet in Steve’s opinion. Ethel was the only kitten, who hadn’t gotten used to humans. She dodged touch and tried to squirm away every time she was picked up. Unlike Charlie, Ethel didn’t like Iron Man at all.
Steve was grateful for Mr. Stark's co-operation. He understood that it wasn’t ideal to manage calls during this time of the day. Or night.
He heard as Tony hummed. Steve wished that he could see Tony’s face, because the man was extremely expressive. Steve had noticed a long time ago that Tony had a way of hiding his emotions from his voice. He always had this certain type of tone from which one couldn’t easily distinguish any emotions. It may be due to all the politicians and businessmen he always has to work with. But his face was the opposite of his voice. At least to Steve. Tony's eyes were especially expressive.
Steve managed to find an unopened can of soup from the workshop, and after heating it up, he served it to Iron Man with a straw. He was hesitant at first, because according to him, drinking hot soup through a straw wasn’t very ideal, but later agreed to drink, after Steve pursued a little. It didn’t take long for Iron Man to empty the whole can, which to Steve just proved that he did need at least some help.
He combed his hair with his hand and stared at the other man in front of him, who’s expression was a cocktail of emotions. Just a moment ago Steve asked that man if he would like to start a romantic relationship with him, and declared his love for him like it was nothing. The more Steve thought about it, the more embarrassing it got.
“I’m good, I’m fine,” Steve assured. It was a little bit of a lie. In reality he was feeling tired. The kittens - which he had almost completely forgotten about while thinking about
“Oh, it wasn’t anything significant, don’t worry,” Iron Man assured. And Steve believed him. If Iron Man said that it wasn’t significant, it probably wasn’t. Steve was, on top of everything, just really glad to finally have a chat with his old friend. His life was starting to feel dull. Of course Jarvis was there to keep Steve company - when he was around - but balancing his duties as the Avenger’s new leader, and trying to find a real social life at the same time was tiring. He always felt like himself with Iron Man, which was what he really needed right now.
Iron Man showed up at around 8 am, usually with some food or other necessaries. Steve would eat breakfast, while Iron Man watched the kittens. They would chat about random things, sometimes about the weather, and sometimes about their lives. It never got really personal, but Steve appreciated it nevertheless. Everything Iron Man talked about was interesting. He always knew how to choose the right words and express his opinions.
The kittens seemed interested in the new voice and tried to go through the door to take a look. Steve gently pushed them further away with his foot.
After setting the now empty can of food on a table right next to him, Steve sat down on a chair he had earlier pulled next to Iron Man. Neither of them said anything, so Steve just settled on looking at Iron Man. He honestly could have just stayed that way, looking at Iron Man, making sure that he was at least still breathing, but apparently Iron Man himself didn’t like that.
Iron Man turned his entire head towards Steve. Steve could see his blue eyes from beneath his helmet. The look he gave Steve was stern, serious. “I know you’re worried, but you can’t help me out with this one. If you really care about me, you’ll let this one go, alright?”
“You’re makin’ me blush with all the compliments, Winghead,” Iron Man responded. Steve raised his eyebrows. Was that a joke, or did he really make Iron Man blush? That wasn’t his intention. He just said what he generally thought of Iron Man.
“He’s in his own home, most likely resting. It has been a rough week for him,” Tony answered and casually petted Charlie. It was a relief to hear that Iron Man was at least still alive. Steve relaxed a little.
“Ah, well, in that case, the kittens are doing better. I took them to the vet in the morning and had all of ‘em checked out,” Steve said. He hooked one leg over the other and tried to sit down more comfortably, but noticed just in time that a kitten had crawled on its own behind his back, and Steve was close to crushing it with his back. He huffed and picked the little rascal up. The kittens were slowly proving themselves to be even more annoying than the criminals, who tried to take over New York every other week.
“It’s okay,” Tony assured and then laughed a little. Steve didn’t understand what was so funny. “I’m honestly taken by your words. I don’t know if anyone has ever talked about me like that before. Or about Iron Man. I don’t know if you feel the same way about, you know, me.” Tony gestured at himself.
Steve nodded and took a seat on a couch opposite of Tony. Rest of the kittens swarmed around Tony, checking him out. Even though Tony’s whole body radiated nervousness, he still smiled and one by one picked all the other kittens onto his lap. They all remained seated, which was a miracle on itself. Steve usually had to struggle real hard in order to keep any of them still.
“Do you want any coffee? Unfortunately Jarvis isn’t here right now, but I can brew some,” Steve proposed, as Tony sat on one of the couches in the living room, followed by Charlie, who jumped on his lap.
To be completely honest, Steve only now realized how caught up on Iron Man he was, even when he was taking care of the kittens. Only now did he actually realize how much all of them had grown and changed since he first saw them. Soon enough they’d be old enough to be adopted. Steve hadn’t thought about it too much. It was obviously the right decision to give the kittens up for adoption, but secretly Steve selfishly wished that he had a chance to keep them all. He had already grown used to them running around the huge mansion, which usually felt empty.
He should have gone to an actual vet, but according to the clock on the wall opposite of him, it was currently 11 PM, which meant that no veterinary was open.
“Do you know if Iron Man is currently open for a relationship?” Steve asked. It felt odd voicing that question out loud, especially to Iron Man’s employer, but they were friends, right? It wasn’t too big of a deal.
To Steve’s surprise, the kittens seemed to be completely fine with the sudden change. It was almost like they never realized that Iron Man was there with them. He figured that it was most likely due to the fact that Iron Man never had any close contact with them. Or maybe they didn’t like Iron Man, and were just glad that he was finally gone.
When Yen pauses to take a breath, Coulson clears his throat, ever so carefully. All eyes turn to him, and he gives them all a mild, deferential smile – one which Steve knows from experience is carefully crafted bullshit.
After a long moment, when Steve is short of breath and hard in his pants and his head is spinning, he pulls back, tipping his forehead forward to rest against Tony’s. Tony is panting, fingers clawing still into Steve’s shoulders.
"Now, since you were too busy to look at the beautiful pictures I sent you today, you can take the time to look at them now." He taps a few keys on the phone, and then suddenly it's projecting his screen up on the ceiling, blowing the pictures up and showing them in their full glory.
The most interesting part of the tableau is that the large blond man’s hand is completely buried in the bespectacled man’s ass, well past the wrist and halfway to the elbow.
It’s only when Cap is braced with his legs wide, throwing the shield with prejudice at an alien’s head, that Tony glances down through the HUD and sees the shape of it under the stretched Kevlar hybrid canvas. It’s round, and full, and tight, and oh, god, Tony has
Steve writhes a little more pointedly at that, and Tony lets a dark chuckle out as he lets loose a particularly vicious hit, and Steve jerks forward, letting out a cry. Tony hits him again and again, watching as the red lines raise into welts.
The only thing Tony can move is his head, which he does. He bends it just enough to look back over his shoulder, past where his legs are tied spread open, ankles bound to his thighs. Steve is still sitting in his chair behind Tony, seemingly uninterested in the sight before him. He’s sketching, though, and Tony knows there will be some
to get fucked? Steve flicks back over everything Tony had said over the last few minutes. Had he thought Steve was… you know, a sexual masseuse?
“That look on your face right now? That’s the look you had on your face when they brought the first course. So, now we’re here, eating street tacos.”
Steve lays him on the bed, kissing him all the while as he sinks to follow him, pressing Tony into the mattress.
“Hey,” Tony says, looking confused. “Sorry, was it supposed to be a hands-only thing? I don’t mind, I asked you for –”
“Yeah? You, uh, you got a preference?” Tony pulls back to look into Steve’s eyes, searching. He looks unsure again, and Steve wants to take them back to that place where things had been lighthearted and fun.
something I can work with. Out of curiosity, from a scientific standpoint, how many times can you…?”
“Both of us at the same time,” he says, sitting all the way up and taking the chocolate from Steve’s hands, breaking another small square off. He’s rising rapidly out of his subspace but in a way that feels good, like he’s woken up from a long, restorative sleep, or he’s had a massage after an intense workout. His limbs feel loose and heavy and soft, the world slightly unfocused at the edges in a way that is soothing and comfortable.
He glances around the room to make sure no one can see the screen of his phone and then types out a reply.
Tony rolls his eyes, mutinously chewing a bite of meatloaf. “Even if we change things here, it creates a new timeline. Ours will stay the same.”
Tony collapses over him, pressing their chests together, completely unconcerned about the mess of come all over Steve’s torso. They’re both breathing hard, hearts pounding hard and fast, shivering with the aftershocks. After a moment, Tony manages to lift his head and press quick, gentle kisses all over Steve’s face – his jaw, his eyes, his cheeks, his forehead, then finally his mouth, and this is a longer kiss, deep and wet and soft, tongue licking into Steve’s mouth.
Sure, Iron Man was a good man. He never failed to make Steve smile. But Steve didn’t know anything about the man behind the mask. No names, no age, not even the color of his hair. Iron Man could be anyone, even someone Steve has already met. And to be completely honest, it didn’t bother Steve as much as it probably should have. He had already taken a liking to Iron Man in these conditions, anyway. But it would most likely bother Iron Man. There was likely a reason for his secretiveness, and he probably didn’t want to reveal his identity to Steve.
“I found it,” Iron Man announced, as he walked back to the kitchen. He hadn’t been gone for that long, but Walter had already become restless again. Literally nothing could keep him down.
Tony looked nervous. His hands were on his legs, clenched in fists. It didn’t look like he was disgusted with Steve’s words, rather distressed. He clearly tried to hold his composure, but his glossy eyes betrayed him. When Tony didn’t say anything, Steve decided to continue again and asked, “Tony. Is there something I don’t know?”
“I was wondering if Iron Man could come by, if you don’t mind,” Steve carefully proposed. There was a couple of seconds of silence. Steve wondered if he had said something wrong. Then Tony cleared his throat. “Right, right. I’ll call him and ask him if he’s available.”
Steve was about to reassure that he was doing fine, but paused. He was clearly in quite a jam with the kittens, and an extra pair of hands wouldn’t be that bad. Steve wasn’t the type of person to shy away from help, especially when he needed it. And to be quite honest, he was hoping to see Iron Man again. Because he was his best friend, of course.
“I’m in the living room,” Steve immediately called back and shifted on the couch. He carefully stood up, lifting the box up as he rose, while Iron Man‘s heavy footsteps could be heard approaching the room.
“Is there really nothing else you can do?” He asked. He was ready to help, if there was a way. Steve didn’t know how, but he’d be ready to do almost anything.“No. Cap, Steve, I’m begging you, don’t worry about it.”
“Of course I feel the same way,” Steve ensured. “You’re Iron Man, Iron Man is you. I don’t think anything can change my feelings.”
That seemed to shut Iron Man up. Steve wondered if he went too far. He wanted to say so many things to Iron Man at that moment, but decided against them. This wasn’t the time for any cheesy love confessions.
When Steve picked one of the hooligans up and moved it back on a cushion, a second one jumped down and tried to explore its surroundings. One of the kittens also kept biting his hand whenever he picked it up. It didn’t hurt, but it wasn’t nice either. Is there a way to teach cats not to bite? Maybe Steve should hire a cat whisperer.
There's a slick finger between his legs now, as Tony works lube over and into his puckered entrance. Steve groans, tries to relax, and flicks his eyes back and forth from the pictures on the ceiling and the sight in front of him – Tony focused on Steve's body, entranced as he works first one, then two slick fingers into Steve's hole.
Tony can’t help himself, and lets the fingers of his other hand caress the stretched rim, along the outside of the dildo, as Steve moans. Steve’s chest sinks to the bed, and he turns his head on the pillow to look up at Tony. His lips are slick and puffed, his cheeks pink, his eyes half closed and pupils blown wide. His cock is still hard, and the rim of his hole is soft, relaxed, open.
Tony notices his hesitation right away, touches his elbow gently. “Steve? You okay? Gimme a colour.”
Subconsciously, Tony finds himself matching Steve’s breath, feels himself relaxing into the table, into the heavy, warm weight of Steve’s body.
Steve blinks at the message and he knows, deep in his bones, that he needs to stop reading his texts
“Shh, shh, Tony, I’m sorry, no,” Steve says, brushing a soothing hand over Tony’s cheek, sounding horrified. “It’s not for that, sweetheart, not ever for that.”
Tony’s hands reach while they kiss, pushing Steve’s wrists apart toward the corners of the bed. Steve shifts restlessly as Tony wraps the cuffs around his wrists, pulling them tight so that he doesn’t have any slack to move with. Steve can already feel the warm, easy lightness creeping back in. Tony slides down his body, kissing him all along the way. Steve moans and writhes, lost in the sensation of Tony’s lips and teeth and tongue all over his body.
“After?” Tony raises a cheeky eyebrow, leaning back to give Steve that same cocky, mischievous grin that Steve had wanted to kiss away earlier. He gives in to the urge, gives Tony another fast, heated kiss.
“Good boy,” Steve says, and Tony feels a shiver go down his spine, feels a twinge low in his belly, and the riot of noise and anxiety in his head starts to muddle. There’s a rustling noise, and a clinking, but Tony doesn’t look up. He suspects Steve is stripping off his own clothing, and he’s proven right when Steve comes over to the table, and Tony can see his bare legs from the opening where his head is resting.
“You get some, and I get some,” he says. His voice is soft, hoarse. Steve lifts a square of chocolate to Tony’s lips, and together they open their mouths and place the morsel on one another’s tongues.
He hesitates for only a moment, then dips the tip of his finger in alongside the dildo, watching Steve’s face for signs of distress as he pushes in. Steve moans, his eyes wide, but the look on his face is one of surprise, of lust and desire. Tony pulls the dildo back, then pushes it in alongside his finger, and Steve takes a deep breath. “So good,” he slurs out.
Tony looks up and meets Steve’s eye. Steve is staring back at him, cheeks flushed and lips warm and soft and pink. Steve puts the nutmeg down, brings his hand up to Tony’s cheek, brushes his thumb over Tony’s jaw.
Steve’s whole body shudders, and he swallows audibly, dropping his head between his shoulders to hang toward the bed. “Tony,” he says, helplessly around an edge of humiliation. But his cock is hard, leaking, and his voice is also full of want. Tony will have to remember that.
“Yeah, I want – I want to be on top,” he finally gets out, and Tony pets his spine as he pulls his cock all the way out.
The next partition has two more people in it, a man and a woman, neither of whom are wearing a mask.
In answer, Tony lifts one hand and snaps his fingers twice. “Good,” Steve says. “Do you have any questions for me before we begin?”
“Wow,” Steve agrees with a grin, dropping the T-shirt of the side of the bed and pulling Tony to his chest. He presses a kiss to Tony’s temple, and they lay there together.
on him. Steve’s hands are so big, soft because of the serum, warm and strong. There’s always a little bit of blackness on his thumb and fingers, from charcoal. Steve is
Tony holds up the collar-thing again, picks up one of the smaller hanging loops. “These would go around your wrists,” he says. “So your hands would be at your face, you’d have a little bit of room to move them, but not exactly
He’s come up so far, and he hadn’t made it all the way down so it’s like there’s a buzzing in the back of his mind, fulfillment snatched away at the last minute.
Tony gently pulls out, comes back quickly with a third slick finger, and the stretch is satisfying this time – it stings, sure, but Steve knows he’s more relaxed, feeling more pleasure from it. The way his cock is hard and leaking a little into the bedding would also be a pretty good indication.
, it will create a new timeline. Who knows what exposing Zola or Hydra now could do to this timeline? It could end this whole universe. You wanna be responsible for that?”
Tony hands the vendor a $100 bill and stacks three recyclable containers on top of each other, takes a fourth and hands it to Steve.
The side of Coulson’s mouth kicks up in a small smile. “We offer many different kinds of demonstrations,” he says.
Steve huffs out a breath as the head pops in, thighs twitching as he stretches to accommodate it. Tony can’t help it, he reaches down and gives his own neglected erection a few strokes, just to give himself
“No, you drew me a scribbled line on a piece of paper and you scribbled over it again and again using words like ‘calamity’ and ‘universal destruction,’” Steve argues.
Coulson leads him past several unmarked closed doors. They all look identical, so Tony doesn’t really know how Coulson decides which one to open. It opens into an empty, richly furnished room. Inside the room are several benches and bondage stands, a large bed, and an assortment of whips and floggers and paddles. Tony turns to look at Coulson, then back into the room.
Tony leans over him, pressing kisses to Steve’s shoulders and back and the back of his neck, shallowly pushing that single finger in and out of Steve’s body.
Steve moans, his hips shifting a little as though to try and get some friction on his cock. But his cock is hanging off the back of the bench, and the best he can do with his little bit of movement is press the base against the leather – nowhere near enough sensation to give him what he wants.
“Let me,” Steve says, then manhandles Tony’s body over so he’s laying on his back. Tony lets his limbs flop, lets Steve move him and adjust him and place him, and it’s like a warm blanket of pleasure over his subspace.
"Good, honey, that's good," Tony pants, finally stopping but not pulling out yet. Steve can feel Tony's come dribbling down the crack of his ass, and it makes him shiver again. "You're so good for me."
Tony is rocking above him, balls resting taut under Steve’s chin. Tony is tight, so tight, but hot and smooth around Steve’s tongue, so he keeps licking and sucking and working. He knows his hands are clenching and releasing on the meat of Tony’s ass, the top of his thighs, and he wonders if he’ll leave bruises. He hopes so, he wants to see marks on Tony’s skin, marks that prove that not only had Steve gotten to touch him, he’d gotten to
Steve can’t stop himself, grinding forward and spilling into the condom as he feels the hot slickness of Tony’s release spill over his hand.
So why had he been so terrified of it? Not because Steve is a stranger – Steve’d had his tongue in Tony’s ass, and that hadn’t bothered Tony one bit. No, it’s not about not knowing Steve.
Tony shivers, feels the tension in him loosen slightly, feels himself going another half step down. “Yes, Steve.”
“Oh, you poor thing,” Tony says, voice gentle and warm. “I didn’t know you were having such a hard day, love, you should have said.”
Tony’s been around the block. He’s over 40, and he’s been one of People’s Sexiest Men Alive, and he got into bed with 12 out of 13 Maxim cover models (it’s 13 because of the twins and he won’t hear another word about it) and countless number of beautiful men and women, and he has some
From there he begun to understand the little things that he had failed to see before, when he and Steve had still been an item, how jealous he would seem to get at the smallest of things, how he had always wrapped an arm Steve's shoulder, sometimes even his waist whenever a random stranger would thank Captain America for saving them or if someone started to flirt with him, Tony would always make sure he was well within earshot, always equipped with a little hand making it's way around Steve's waist, sometimes even walking up to him and grabbing Steve when he was in the middle of talking to someone only to pull Steve down to him, pressing their lips together in a hot and messy kiss, his hands bunching up in Steve's shirt, pulling him so close that whomever he was speaking to would suddenly remember that they had somewhere to be and take off, leaving Steve in a slight state of confusion before Tony would wave the thought away from him and kiss him to ensure that he would forget about it within the next few moments.
That thing wasn't despite all of Rogers's attempts to argue the opposite his truest best friend that the captain had originally believed to have fallen to his death during the second world war, instead that thing had been rebuilt by the very same horrible organisation that they had tried to fight once before, they had plagued his mind, erasing all the man's original memories of his life before the fall.
Getting angry was the last thing that Tony wanted to do right now but due to his A.I. not seeming to know when to back out of his personal life and refusing to do exactly as he said, he was slowly getting to the end of his tether.
"Tony..." Steve's eyes were shinning in that moment and Tony feared that the man was going to start crying but nothing of the sort happened, in-fact if Tony was right in thinking, Steve seemed to almost be becoming blurry, but that wasn't right.
Thinking back on it now, Tony had became slowly very aware of the fact that this had been Steve's biggest problem.
Tony slows before he stops, still fucking into Steve for as long as his cock stays hard. Steve squeezes his eyes closed, sure there must be tears leaking out the sides, but Tony will know it's just from the overstimulation – the wild pleasure that isn't over yet.
And Steve does what he has wanted to do for months. He pulls Tony closer to him, wraps an arm around Tony’s back and cups the back of Tony’s head in his hand. He crushes his mouth over Tony’s, kissing him hard and fast and licking into his mouth with as much desire and passion as he can put into it.
“We don’t normally – normally my clients don’t want that. But you’re not like most of my clients, so I guess it makes sense.”
Steve bites his lip to stop the grin. He's about to send back a cheeky reply when another photo comes through.
Tony groans as Steve’s hand bumps over a knot. He’s having a hard time figuring out just exactly how Steve thinks he’s going to get Tony into subspace without pain, but if it weren’t possible, wouldn’t someone along the line have told him? He’s often thought of going down into subspace like descending a set of stairs, but most doms had shoved him and sent him tumbling down them, hard and fast and brutal. He thinks, even this early on, that Steve might be different.
Which had left a warm, fuzzy feeling in Tony’s chest where the arc reactor used to be. Not that he’d admit that to anyone.
“Gonna – gotta get lube, honey, just a second,” Tony groans, breathless and hot, spinning to straddle Steve’s hips and face him. He rips open a condom with his teeth and rolls it down over Steve’s straining cock, then he grabs the lube, pouring it over his fingers even as he bucks to ride the desperate roll of Steve’s hips, and then Tony reaches back behind himself, crying out and closing his eyes tight. Steve wishes he could see Tony shove slick fingers inside himself, see his hole stretch open for the intrusion, but Tony doesn’t waste any time, doesn’t make a show of it, just spreads some slick over the condom on Steve’s cock and then pulls his left ass cheek aside while he uses his right hand to grip Steve, holding him steady, then presses down. He’s amazing, tight, and so, so fucking hot, Steve can’t help but cry out as he sinks into that perfect, clenching heat.
The corner of Steve’s mouth twitches like he’s trying to hold back a smile. “If it’s really all that good, you’d think you’d be insisting on keeping it all to yourself.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, and he leans into Tony’s space, slowly, and presses a gentle, sweet kiss over Tony’s lips. He keeps it fairly chaste, brushing his lips across Tony’s slowly, and then he pulls back. Tony’s cheeks are flushed, his eyes bright in the dim room.
Steven Grant and Howard Potts drive back to Philly and put the car back where they found it, and settle in to wait. Steve grows his beard back so he’s less recognizable, and Tony shaves his off so he doesn’t stand out so much.
Tony moans, bringing both hands around to Steve’s chest, steadying himself. Then he’s moving, hard and fast, riding Steve with rolling, grinding hips. The silky, sweet grip of him around Steve’s cock is relentless, unbelievable, and Steve bends his knees a little, as much as he can, and it’s just enough to get a little leverage so he can pump his hips up, fucking up into that tight, tight heat, pushing his cock as deep as he can into Tony’s ass. Tony is crying out, head thrown back, and Steve knows, he just
“Do you like that?” Tony asks him, hope flaring in his chest. “Do you like feeling that burning stretch? Feeling so full you don’t think you can take any more?”
questions. Is Steve his real name? Why is he here? Is his dick as big as the rest of him? What is Steve going to do to him? Does he want to hurt Tony?
Tony grins, and it’s cocky and sure and beautiful. “Well, then, I’m just gonna let you know, I’m probably going to ask you to dinner, and then I’m going to see if I can’t convince you to do it again.”
Tony opens them again, and Steve is still standing at the kitchen counter, his hands coated in white goo.
Steve grins, finishing washing his hands under the faucet and drying them on the towel he has draped over his shoulder.
"You ready to apologize?" Tony asks him, tugging at the red lace in Steve's mouth. It comes out crumpled and damp, and Steve licks his lips. His mouth waters a little at the salty taste of himself on his bottom lip, which is good, because Tony doesn't give him a lot of time before he's shuffling forward again, getting up on his knees and guiding his cock down, pressing the head against Steve's lips.
“Eight,” Tony agrees, voice strained, and he cries out when Steve squeezes the bulb and the toy inside him stretches, and Tony knows his ass is probably obscenely wide. He’s so full, so open, his body nothing but Steve’s to play with. He has no responsibilities, nothing he must do, nothing but existing here, in this moment, being
Tony feels the quiet deep in his bones, the static and noise of the world brought down, shut out, until nothing exists but the two of them in this room. He knows he’s still floating, and he fears the drop, but for right now, he just feels pleasant and warm and soft.
come from what I’m doing, you have permission,” Steve murmurs into Tony’s ear, the gentle but unmistakable tone of authority bringing Tony down another small step.
Tony doesn’t make a move on Steve right away. It’s not just because he’s worried any advances will be unwelcome. He moves the team into the tower first; two near-death experiences in the space of a couple of hours had been enough to make him aware of the crushing void of family and friends in his life, and if you can’t make friends with people you almost died with, who
Steve can't help it – he throws his head back and howls, cheeks heating when the sound is still muffled by the panties. Tony instantly sets a quick rhythm. He pushes all the way in until his hips are pressed tight against Steve's ass, and then he pulls back almost all the way, until just the head is still inside Steve, stretching his rim wide around it. Then he pushes in again, thrusting forward and evenly paced.
“Oh, no,” Steve moans, his knees turning to jelly. “Oh my god, I’m going to lose my license for this, and apparently the whole internet thinks I’m a mobile rub-and-tug service and I had sex with a
Tony frowns in thought; it makes sense. The oils and fat and egg in the mayo, browning under the heat of the oven. It’s simple chemistry.
“I want to feel you come in me,” Steve breathes, swallowing as he starts to ramp up his hips again, thrusting down on the cocks inside him. “Please, Tony, want you to fill me up.”
Steve is the first out of the room, headed straight up to the Avengers personal floors and the penthouse suite. Tony has some explaining to do.
“Yeah,” Steve decides, squeezing Tony’s a little. “I’m definitely gonna lick my come out of you first.”
"No. Sorry. It's nothing," Steve says, and his voice cracks a little with the lie. He reaches out, puts his hand back over the phone protectively, then slowly slides it off the table and into his lap. Everyone in the room – and the holograms – stare at him for a moment, before going back to what they were saying.
. He wants to eat food he recognizes and watch a movie with his team while Clint and Natasha throw popcorn into each others’ mouths.
Steve walks around the end of the table and moves over to his left foot, and repeats the process, working at knots in Tony’s leg.
“And we’re already doing it! You’re at SHIELD every day, working with Howard and Pym and Zola, and I’m supposed to believe you aren’t using your knowledge, your skills, to create things they might not figure out on their own?”
Tony pants for breath, his whole body floating even as his mind sinks further down. “Ten,” he whispers, and Tony moans as Steve squeezes the bulb again, as he feels the stretch of the toy inside him. It’s depraved, it’s too much, it’s perfect, and Steve pushes the heel of his hand against the dildo again, fucking it into Tony. Tony’s body shivers with each press, oversensitive and groaning, mindless with pleasure. He sinks down, down, down.
Tony has done this before. In his wild youth, during cocaine-fueled nights and bad decisions and demonstrating poor coping skills, he’s done this. He’d been on the other end, he’d had that exquisite fiery burn of being filled too much, stretched past the limit, and he’d enjoyed it. But he’d never been on this end, watching the stretch and the tremble and the flush of eagerness spread across pale, glistening skin.
“Want – wanna be good. For you,” Steve pants when Tony slides his mouth down Steve’s throat. Steve arches his head back, back, baring his throat to Tony.
Steve reaches out, petting a hand through Tony’s hair, down the back of his neck, down his spine and over his ass. Steve’s fingers brush over the vibrating plug and down Tony’s thigh, but Tony doesn’t move, doesn’t make a sound. Steve will take care of him. Steve knows what’s best for him, and how Tony should be touched.
“I like watching you,” Tony admits. “The way you get lost in pleasure. Watching you come is one of the highlights of my day, Cap, it’s not exactly a hardship.”
Even as he says the words, he's pulling his fingers free and replacing them with the blunt head of his cock, pushing in steady and fast.
Tony lets his thumb slide inside the wet heat of Steve’s mouth, curling the pad of his thumb under Steve’s tongue to take hold of his lower jaw. He tugs gently, and Steve’s mouth drops open obediently, his cheeks pink.
Steve's cock jumps – partly because of the sound of Tony's voice on the recording, hot and turned on and dirty. But partly because he can hear it, in the background of the message. The slick slide of Tony slowly stroking his cock, just like he'd said he was.
Tony tenses instantly. Steve had said he wasn’t interested in pain; Tony isn’t prepared for this, isn’t ready, he doesn’t
Tony takes a moment to consider it, feeling sluggish and drunk but still not nearly all the way down into subspace. “Green,” he says.
Tony holds out another grape, and Steve accepts it. He slowly feeds Steve grape after grape, sneaking a few for himself, until the bowl is empty. “Do you need a bath, honey, or just a wipedown?”
He does this for some time, going back and forth between the dildo and his own cock. Steve is whining, his hips shifting, and Tony pulls out again, fucking Steve with the dildo harder and faster until Steve cries out, his balls tightening into his body, his whole body shuddering as he comes, hard and fast and loud, all over the towel again.
there if he didn’t have, you know, an interest. Even a little one. It’s a big tower. If he’s lonely he could go hang out with Nat or Clint or Thor or even Banner. Or anyone at SHIELD, the guy’s probably got more friends. But he’s not anywhere else. And he doesn’t take well to homophobes. So.
Steve is just gearing up to beg because he’s so turned on he might die, and then Tony is pushing in, all the way, sliding his hard cock all the way into Steve’s body.
The woman in front of him has a cane in her hand, which explains the welts. She’s dressed all in black, wearing a leather corset-style bodysuit, her breasts full and round and overflowing at the top. She’s got on thigh-high boots with impossibly high heels, and the strips of her milky white thighs seem to reflect light through the room. Her beautiful red curls fall prettily over her face, and the colour somehow matches exactly the long, thick strap-on she’s got fastened to her pelvis.
He lets go of the base of the dildo once it’s more than halfway into Steve’s tight channel, and watches as Steve’s body slowly pushes it out. Steve groans, and Tony pushes it back in, a little further this time, then lets it go again. The fifth time he does this, he pushes it almost all the way to the base, and Steve moans, tilting his pelvis and spreading his thighs a little further apart, and Tony has to swallow drily at the sight of Steve so wanton.
After a moment, where they just stare at each other in some namelessly charged way, Steve takes a deep breath and moves off the bed, moving toward Tony’s clothes. He brings them back, then gently starts putting them back on Tony. He doesn’t ask Tony to help, doesn’t tell Tony to dress himself – he moves Tony’s arms, his legs, seems to expect Tony to keep them where they’re placed (and he does) and allow Steve to dress him. And Steve seems to revel in it, in controlling Tony’s body, gently placing his underwear and trousers and shirt over him, covering up the skin that had been bare and sweaty moments ago.
“Jesus, yes, how could I not be, when you – oh, god, Steve, honey…” Tony trails off as his hands go back to gripping Steve’s hips, and Tony thrusts up into him, meeting Steve’s own as he rides faster and faster.
They’re also going to be a lot more likely to be what Tony needs, even if it is pretend. To give him what he’s seeking in this little encounter.
Tony makes a mental note to himself to get a strap-on so he can have both hands free and still fuck Steve like this, then slides his finger down Steve’s chest and belly to wrap around his straining, desperately red erection.
He comes back with a bottle of lubricant, a smallish glass dildo, and a cloth bag Tony can’t see into.
Tony’s body is shaking, wild and undone. His eyes are streaming tears down his face and his orgasm seems to last forever. He sobs in a breath as the last few spurts of come drip onto the floor under him. His chemise is stained with it, there’s even some dripping off the bottom of the arc reactor.
it. He has to bank hard to the right to narrowly miss hitting a Chitauri rocket-bike-thing as he’s suddenly distracted by the thought.
Steve draws in the evenings. They sit side by side on the sofa in their little apartment with the television playing some sitcom or variety show, and Steve draws while Tony tinkers with calculations and formulas.
who are more well-versed in the sex work aspect of thing would know exactly what to do next, but Steve’s not one of them. He has no
“Tony,” Steve sighs, a breathy moan, and his cock pulses again even though it’s soft. Tony lets his fingers thrust in a few times, then retreats – regretfully – as Steve shivers with oversensitivity.
Another dribble of saliva drools out the side of his mouth. The ring gag is keeping his mouth open wide, and he knows that it could get uncomfortable soon, but it’s still bearable. His lips are stretched wide around it, his mouth held open. Open enough that, some time ago, Steve had been able to pull his hard cock out of his jeans and fuck into Tony’s slack mouth until he’d finally pulled out and shoot across Tony’s face, leaving hot come dripping on Tony’s lip and cheek.
Steve’s hands are slick with oil, and he’d been staring at the plump fullness of Stark’s ass for 40 minutes and he’s hard enough to cut glass.
“Oh, Steve,” Tony sighs, whole chest bubbling with happiness at the way Steve always gives himself over. “Oh, you’re so beautiful.”
He’s not rough about this – he goes slow but steady, pushing his cock into Steve’s tight, hot, slick hole. Steve’s moan is low and constant, and his hips are shifting back to try and force Tony further into him, deeper and faster, but Tony maintains his slow, steady pace until he’s all the way in, hip bones pressed against the globes of Steve’s ass.
“Of course, Tony,” Steve says, and he squeezes Tony in a hug, and it’s somehow the most intimate thing they’ve done this evening. “Of course we can try again. I can schedule you any –”
“Tony, wait,” Steve says, pulling back a little more, and Tony knows a ‘no’ when he hears it, so he freezes.
Tony had used his considerable clout to get them last minute reservations. Steve isn’t stupid, he knows this restaurant is impossible to get into. But apparently, when you’re Tony Stark, they roll out the red carpet for you. Just like everywhere else.
Steve makes a punched-out grunting noise, but doesn’t answer right away. Tony knows he’s considering – they both know Tony will fuck him at the end of this. The question is how stretched out and ready Steve wants to be before it happens. Does he want to be open and loose so Tony can slam slickly into him? Or does he want to be tight and unprepared so Tony’s cock spears him open, burning and pushing and stretching to the point of discomfort.
. Everything is exactly the way it should be. When I’m with you, I’m not thinking about what I lost or what I, what I slept through. I’m just thinking about you.”
He stares over at his bag on the sofa, where his work phone is. He’d not checked his messages before this appointment, but the display had said he had 18 new – oh
He likes looking up from under his eyelashes, being able to see Tony staring down at him, looking lust-wrecked and pleasure-drunk. Tony’s lips are parted slightly, and his eyes are dark, pupils blown wide. He combs his fingers through Steve’s hair gently – not tugging or pulling at all, just petting, and it makes Steve give a creaky little moaning noise that makes Tony gasp.
Steve worked after breakfast. He checked the possible alarms and calls for help. If there was nothing, he spent the whole day with Iron Man and the kittens.
It had only been a week, and everything was already chaos. Steve couldn’t count the times he had had to run after the kittens around the mansion, or prevent them from jumping a floor down from the staircase. Iron man did come by every day to check up on them and help out, and Steve didn’t know what he would do without him, but everything was still extremely complicated.
After some pondering he finally decided to just observe Iron Man and his behavior. Steve knew how to read him well. He could spend the whole next day looking at Iron Man, taking notes, and maybe hopefully getting to know his stance on a relationship. He didn’t need to rush things.
Steve sighed heavily and also leaned back on his couch. Dorothy jumped right next to him and he petted her slightly, but didn’t take his eyes off of Tony. He was trying to figure Tony out. There was something going on, something much deeper and complicated than Tony let him know. Steve wasn’t going to let that stop him.
“Hey, you know what, Cap?” Iron Man suddenly asked. Steve switched his gaze from the kitten back to him. “Maybe I can help you out a little bit, eh? It looks like these little guys could really use something to eat.”
Steve started the day off like he normally did. He woke up at six, fed the kittens, and did his workout. But Iron Man didn’t show up around 8. Nor 8.30. At first Steve just figured that he had to be stuck in the morning traffic, but he soon realized that Iron Man didn’t need a car. He could fly. So traffic was most likely not the problem.
“Didn’t you leave it in the living area?” Iron Man noted, and set the can he had opened aside. Steve shook his head. “I have a super soldier memory, Shellhead. I know where I left it.” Despite his words, Steve was smiling at Iron Man. He couldn’t see Iron Man’s face, but he was hoping that Iron Man was smiling at him, too.
It wasn’t anything major, of course. Steve just liked Iron Man as a good friend, who helped him out and kept him company. He liked it, when Iron Man came to visit every morning and immediately checked up on him, making sure that everything was alright. He liked it, when they had their small, lighthearted squabbles, while tending the kittens. He liked it, when Iron Man sat next to him on the living area couch, and they both just talked about whatever came to mind. He genuinely just liked Iron Man.
Steve couldn’t thank Tony enough. He probably didn’t even know how much seeing Iron Man meant to Steve.
Tony met Steve’s eyes and smiled. “That’s the corniest goddamn thing I’ve ever heard.” Steve raised one eyebrow at him, not impressed. Tony laughed now in earnest. It was hard for Steve to suppress his own smile, and he eventually failed. “Okay?” he asked, once Tony calmed down.
“Steve, I- I mean, I respect you. Wholeheartedly. You are one of my heroes and my biggest inspiration, and believe me when I say that I always trust your judgment-,”
“I would’ve taken these to an actual veterinarian, but I’m afraid all the clinics are closed at this hour. Still, something had to be done, which is why I decided to call you. I trust you more than anyone else. And you are one of the smartest, most capable people I know. You know how to take care of a litter of kittens, right?”
Tony nodded. He tried to look relaxed, but Steve could read his face like an open book. Something was wrong.
The feeling itself was nice. It felt like floating on a cloud, never having to come down. But when he remembered the reason for the feeling, that he was crushing on a man whose real name he didn’t even know, it came crashing down. In a sense, at least.
They spent a good minute just staring at the kittens together. Then Iron Man decided to speak again. “So, why did you call me? To be a babysitter for these little creatures while you go out and do your duties? Or has someone actually planted miniature bombs inside these kittens?”
After the visit, Steve had gotten a list of all the things he should keep in mind, while taking care of the kittens. It was a long list, and kittens needed a lot of care, but Steve was confident that he knew what to do. The instructions were clear.
While walking, his thoughts had been interrupted by a small, faint meow, coming from somewhere near. That’s when he had noticed a worn cardboard box on the ground right next to him. The meows came out from there.
“Oh, please, just call me Tony. No need for formalities,” Mr. Stark, or actually, Tony requested. Steve mentally noted that. He didn’t consider the two of them close. Of course they had their talks and Steve respected Tony - he was the one to give Steve a home after all - but they never really talked outside of work. The same could definitely be said about Iron Man, since they never really saw each other outside duty, but it felt different. At least for Steve it did. He had experienced so much with Iron Man, and the two of them just shared a bond in and outside of the battlefield. The same could not be said of Tony
As Tony had promised, the secretary let Steve inside Tony’s workshop. He couldn’t actually see any living humans there, after he stepped in. Only machines and some furniture, like some chairs. Only after looking around, he noticed a familiar man dressed in red and gold, sitting kind of lousily on a chair at the corner.
“I thought you were busy?” Steve remarked. He didn’t want to waste Iron Man’s time. Knowing him, whatever he was doing before this was certainly important. Or, at least more important than Steve and his box full of kittens.
“They’re really cute,” Tony murmured. Steve agreed. “They are. Iron Man would probably like to see them too. Do you know where he is?”
Steve bit his lip. He hadn’t honestly really thought much of the kittens, because Iron Man was the only thing in his mind. Iron Man had been the only thing in his mind the whole day. He wanted to do something. He had to do something.
Tony Stark’s factory was huge. Steve had been there before, but it still never failed to impress him. There all the magic happened, and Tony’s wondrous inventions came to life.
There had been a bank robbery alert last evening, and Steve had been the one to respond to that. It was an above average situation. Some fellas had somehow gotten highly dangerous weapons to their possession, and had quite literally melted the door of the bank vault off. There was a lot of cleaning up to do in the aftermath, but fortunately the incident did not escalate too far.
“Steve,” he started, then fell quiet for another second, and resumed, “Are you really sure about this? You know, Iron Man is not perfect. Far from it, actually.”
“Is there anything you’d like to talk about with him? I can answer some of your questions. Or I could forward a message from you to him, you know.”
Tony sighed. Steve patiently waited for his response, fingers crossed. And to his delight, Tony accepted his demands.
“I just wanted to check up on you and the kittens,” Tony continued. Steve frowned. He didn’t remember telling Tony about the kittens.
