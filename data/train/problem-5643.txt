The blond takes a sip and forces a straight face as the alcohol burns his throat. He's never been one to drink, but the warmth that spreads through him as the booze sinks in does help ease his nerves.
Not only did this place have a dozen cats roaming around freely, but the waitresses were dressed in tiny little French maid outfits, which Steve couldn’t help but get all flustered about.
He's done maybe a dozen videos in the couple of months he's worked at the studio, ranging anywhere from solo work, to bondage, to blow jobs to full on sex.
Steve gave a bashful smile. “The serum ah…helped. I’ve definitely got um…a lot more requests since then.” He said, that lovely flush creeping down his cheeks to spread across his throat. “But the war, being an Avenger….suppose I just haven’t found the time. Or the right partner.” He said, shrugging his shoulders.
They still wound up going to the feline café.
“Just hurry up and get ready before you’re late. I’m pretty sure I prefer you with balls.” He calls out teasingly, sitting up to look for his clothes. He finds his jeans hanging over various furniture, but his underwear seem to have vanished into thin air.
Tony huffed in defeat, slipping the Iron Man gauntlet off of his arm and stood up. “Fine.” He muttered, deciding that he could squeeze a five minute break into his busy schedule, if only to quench the Captain’s insistent nagging.
This was absolutely ludicrous. Sure, you could argue that he was already selling himself on the internet, but it’s not like he put his face in the videos, or made a career out of it! There was still some sense of anonymity to his content, and if he signed on to a studio then his reputation would be shattered forever.
Steve slowed his punches when he heard the voice, turning his head to see Natasha, freshly showered and dressed comfortably in a pair of leggings and a grey hoodie.
Steve instinctively tried to pull away but Rumlow just tightened his grip and jerked his head back into place.
It was a quiet day in Avengers Tower, which where precious days due to how rare and far between these moments of pure, uninterrupted noiselessness were.
“I really should get back to work.” He mutters.
Steve knew it was ridiculous, if he really did end up signing on there would be a whole room of people watching him jerk off and fuck strangers, this was just the tutorial level.
One of the aliens steps out among the crowd of panicking civilians, calling the spear to her with a wave of her hand.
They said their farewells, Steve promising to stop by for Sunday mass the next time he wasn’t busy defending New York from some sort of global assault.
Tony entertained the idea for a moment. The only charity functions he ever attended were of the black tie variety, where pompous bureaucrats and politicians congregated to brag about how much money they were donating to some probable cause. It might be nice to go to an event where the main goal of the evening wasn’t to see who the most generous benefactor was.
Tony pursed his lips, his nose wrinkling. “Ooh, sorry Cap, but I already made plans.”
Old or young, Steve could recognize those bright hazel eyes anywhere.
Sorry it took so long! Lot's of things getting in the way of writing at the moment, and that included some pretty severe writers block, but I managed to get enough to fill up a chapter. I'm thinking there will be 5, but that could change depending on how long it takes me to get to the conclusion (and how much porn you want Steve to go through). As always, Comments and Kudos are greatly appreciated! They help feed my motivation to actually get stuff written, so please leave me a word on how you like the story so far. Next time, Steve is going to be exploring a few more partners ;)
“So, is hanging out with me as bad as you thought it would be?” Steve asked, his mouth slightly red from sucking on the popsicle.
, but something about him felt….reassuring.
They both shared a grin at that, and took a few more sips from the quickly emptying flask. After a few moments of lingering silence, Tony spoke up once again, determined to find at least one crack in the Captain’s chastity belt.
“Dude, if you don't leave I'm calling security.” Darcy screeched at him, already reaching for the phone.
That had been intense. Way more intense than he would have imagined.
Steve rolled his eyes at Tony’s antics, but the woman just giggled softly.
“But you wanna ditch our friends to keep making out?” Tony teased, lips quirked playfully. “Why Captain, how very middle school of you.”
The man was arrogant – he threw a right hook to the side of the bag, insubordinate– another punch to the center of the swaying sack, selfish, an uppercut this time --
“Feels… feels pretty good.” He wheezed, hand speeding up slightly.
Bucky stopped him. “It's fine Stevie. I’m still getting used to it.” He smiles, reaching up to touch Steve's shoulder. “It's great, really. I feel… more like myself now. Thank you.”
Bruce was sitting down, hunched over on the couch, noise canceling headphones strapped to his head as he wound down with classical music. His usual post-hulking out ritual.
Steve is completely naked aside from his socks. It’s a little bit humiliating considering Tony’s still wearing everything save for his suit jacket, but part of him kind of likes the power play of feeling so vulnerable. He might have said something, but then Tony’s mouth was on his chest, tongue traveling down the line between his pecks before detouring towards a nipple and suddenly all coherent thoughts were gone.
Tony’s the largest Porn Tycoon in New York, he imagines it wouldn’t be that hard for him to find someone to fill in. But then, again he’s not the CEO of a prestigious porn company, so what the hell would he know?
God, he was being pathetic. Why would Tony care about some half-assed nudey pic? Tony could see every inch of his body in glorious HD whenever he wanted. Or rather, if he wanted to at all. He was halfway across the globe, probably sitting in some fancy business office surrounded by beautiful people and drinking expensive sake. Like he would care about some dumb picture.
It was his company after all, he had to pull his own weight from time to time.
Steve wasn’t good at expressing emotion, and by the looks of it Tony wasn’t either. He was at a loss of words for what he could say to Tony, but then he remembered Natasha’s wise advice about getting him to see Steve Rogers, not Captain America.
“Just barely!” Steve shot back, still hovering over Tony. “Besides, you had
Steve tensed for a second, then visibly deflated, looking away like a child caught scribbling on the walls with marker. He sighed heavily, knowing he couldn’t argue his way out of this. “How did you know?”
He slips back into the underwear he borrowed from Tony this morning, reaching down for his pants and shoves his leg in. He nibbles on his bottom lip. “So, what are you going to do about your movie if you can't get a replacement?” He asks.
He saw Tony lean over to whisper something into the director’s ear, all the while maintaining eye contact with him. Steve felt hot under those dark, chocolate brown eyes, the flush sweeping over his body from his throat to his chest. It was shameful just how much it turned him on to have Tony watching him when he was vulnerable.
“Well, it looks like my date just canceled on me so I guess I’ll settle for you.”
The grip on his jaw loosened, but before he could pull away, Rumlow spat in his face. Steve’s skin crawled when he felt the wetness hit his cheek, thick spittle slowly trickling down the side of his face.
Not too long after his less than convivial chat with Stane, and after he’d iced his fat lip, Steve showed up in his office. He took one look at Tony’s face, battered lip and still swollen jaw, and winced.
He makes his way over to the kitchen and decides to make coffee, figuring Tony would appreciate it before having to go deal with whatever disaster is waiting for him at work. It takes some finagling to figure out the fancy espresso maker—seriously, who the hell actually needs this kind of thing in their home? -- but eventually he manages to get it working just as the shower turns off.
The Captain was spending some of his free time in the training room, dodging the red lasers that shot out of the tiny wall mounted robots that locked onto his every move. Just as he blocked the barrage of laser beams with his shield, he felt his phone going off in his pocket.
torture. You gotta give me something to work with, Brooklyn.”
“Yeah, sure. I need to stop by the studio later anyway, so I’ll pick you up.”
The computer's video software popped open, briefly flashing the Stark Studios logo before the screen faded to black, revealing Steve standing in the middle of a large, empty room, arms drawn up over his head with thick leather straps keeping him tethered to the ceiling. The rope was just long enough for Steve to touch the ground, but he had to stay on the balls of his feet to keep from dangling, showing off the powerful mass of his muscles as he strained to keep his balance.
“You mean in a ‘I wanna put my tongue in your mouth’ sort of way?” He teased, deflecting the heavy emotional side of the conversation with humor as he tended to do.
Tony kept his eyes on the road. “Nope, just taking you somewhere else.”
Steve raised an eyebrow, reaching for a cracker himself. “Who?”
Steve answered by going in for another kiss, resting his open palm on the side of Tony’s neck to draw him in. It was a little less intense than the last one, but the firm swipe of tongue over the brunet’s bottom lip was probably enough to get his point across.
“Oh yeah, I’ve heard of you. You’re that new golden boy that Stark signed on.” He said, pointing at Steve. “Think you’ve broken records with how many fans you got in just a few months, now I know why.”
sleep with him.”
Steve crouches on the back of the hover bike, bracing himself, eyes locked on Tony as he continues to cut through the air. Natasha weaves through a few buildings until Steve can get a clear shot. When they’re close enough, he jumps, propelling himself forward, arms tightly folded against his side’s for maximum momentum. Steve reaches an arm out and catches Tony`s bicep and yanks, pulling the brunet tight to his chest with one arm locked around his waist, his body curling around him protective, the other holding up his shield to protect their faces.
At the time, Steve might have thought about settling down with her after the war. Maybe have kids, start a family with the beautiful redhead. She would have made a lovely wife. Of course, that was before I crashed the fighter jet into the Arctic Ocean. Now, more than 70 years later, it was far too late for any of that. “I don’t even know if she’s still alive.”
Still, despite their initial rough start, he was prepared to be civil. Steve had gone out of his way to apologize (sort of) for his behavior the other day, and despite popular opinion, Tony Stark wasn’t a complete asshat. He could humor the super soldier for a few hours, especially if it meant that the team would lay off him for giving the guy such a hard time.
Though he now knew Steve was a pretty liberal guy, he decided to keep that bit to himself.
Steve simply rolled his eyes at that.
“But wait, before you go.” Tony spoke suddenly, making Steve snap his head up. “I don’t want to scare you away, but this industry eats up hot, young people like you. I hope you know what you’re doing.” He says with what almost sounds like understanding.
As anticipated it wasn’t a gun that Stane had tucked away, but instead it was a manilla envelope. Tony eyed the folder, confused for a second and then scoffed.
Steve panted out of breath, tugging at his bonds.
Tony switched out his usual colour lenses for a simple pair of thick, black rimmed glasses with clear lenses.
Jerking off for a group of perverts in front of a webcam wasn’t on his list of crowning achievements, but waiting tables part time didn’t earn a whole lot of cash, and it’s not like his Art degree was doing much for him aside from collecting dust in a drawer somewhere.
Tony kicked his boots to propel himself faster through the air, flying upwards in a helix around the creature as it flailed its arms, trying to swat at him like a fly. He waited until it opened its mouth to let out another screech and then tossed the box of pyrotechnics into its gaping maw, shooting a repulsor beam down its throat.

Thing is, Tony knows his morning run route. Is that weird? He doesn’t mean to be a stalker. He just happens to know because Steve mentioned it offhandedly once during a team lunch, and ever since, Tony’s kept that little bit of knowledge in the back of his mind.

, he’s trying, and he knows it’s really none of his business, but at some point, Tony had become concerned about Steve spending so much time in the gym alone, punching bags as if his life depended on it. And his spite-filled morning runs.
"—Yeah. Yeah, I do. Feels like yesterday."
“Who are you?”
Tony? Tony hasn’t been an Avenger in a long time. A hero, maybe (at best), but the Avengers disbanded the moment they’d been torn apart from the inside.

His fingers loosen their grip on Steve’s shirt. Steadies his hand on his waist entirely, leans his forehead against Steve’s. “That…”
" Tony can't even begin to imagine what it feels like to lose another five years to the ice. He wishes it weren't the case, wishes he could rewind that time and give him his years back, but that's never how it works. "Could be a lot worse, really. I'm just glad to be back."

It’s the only way he can bear this. Survive it. “First time I

Steve would do a lot of things for him without question, and Tony wishes he were here so he could properly… thank him.
He thinks he may just stare at that for even longer, wonders what it’d be like to send this passive-aggressive text message in response to his almost-lover-ex-friend.
. Tony's blinking.
“I’m glad it did.”
Their lives have always been moving from one disaster to the next—big or small—without much time to settle and catch their breaths. It's been an unusual change of pace as well, fighting AIM and Taskmaster's Wardogs goons, without Steve having his back. They've always had that under their belt going for them, picking each other up no matter the predicament. Yet now they're back at it, together again, and it feels just like old times.
He doesn’t let himself think about it.)
When Steve actually chuckles, Tony knows he’s won this time.

coming, not that someone as close as Steve would end up standing at the opposite side like a bull ready to ram right into him. Tony can’t say he ever prepared himself for the betrayal, but he always had a feeling the shoe would drop, regardless of whether or not they would stand together.
He was pondering the idea when he heard the sound of a notification, one message lighting up his inbox. It wasn’t unusual for him to get a DM from time to time. Mostly they were from other users asking to meet up in person or tell him how attractive he was, and of course there was the occasional hate mail from time to time. He should honestly just ignore and delete all messages, but Steve had been raised to always give people the benefit of the doubt so he read it none the less. That, and the gnawing curiosity of what people had to say about him.
Tony's wearing an ear piece, so he can't hear the other side of the conversation, but whatever the other person says has Tony viciously rolling his eyes, turning his head to give Steve a look as if to say ‘can you believe the shit I have to deal with?
“Hey, you caught me, right.” He chokes out, his voice strained but surprisingly calm for someone who almost fell to his death.
Just a few short moments later, he heard the whoosh of his glass doors opening and saw a very strong faced Steve Rogers walk into his laboratory, clad in a pair of low hanging sweats and a damp t-shirt.
Another late night at the office.
Both of them glanced out the window and suddenly saw a car crashing through the wall of the building opposite them, sending out an explosion of shattered glass and bricks onto the street.
Body feeling loose and completely spent, the CEO took a moment to compose himself, looking down at his sticky hand and cum splattered jeans.
“Bet you could still take out a Hydra base single handed.”
He’s about to leave the office when Tony calls out to him.
“I mean, I know you have work tomorrow, but I can put in a word with your boss, he and I are on pretty good terms--"
Okay, now he could start to understand why people were into this.
She smiled at him. “Okay then Steve. Did you bring the documents I asked for?”
“Yeah right.”
As corny as it sounded, Steve had really been looking forward to a lazy morning with Tony, having fun beneath the sheets and then maybe grabbing some coffee afterwards like…well, like a date. Now that he thinks about it, he suddenly realizes how ridiculous that idea sounds.
“You’re really not making this easy.” Tony sighs, eyes still fixed on the patch of light, dirty blond hair peaking out from the top of Steve’s boxers.
Steve was about to pull back and throw his shield as a distraction but faltered, grunting when a stray bullet skimmed over his shoulder and sent a sharp throb of pain through his body. He knelt onto the ground, lifting his shield up to ward off another bombardment.
When they pulled up near the tower, instead of turning into the building Tony kept on going straight. Steve took note of this, glancing back at the tower as they drove further and further away from it.
For innocent old women, they were definitely cunning little minxes.
“You know, playing the funny, sarcastic asshole doesn’t really suit you. You should probably stick to being your regular, unfunny stick-in-the-mud self.” He muttered, limping just a bit. He’d probably sprained his knee on impact, because he winced at the sharp sting of pain every time he put pressure on it. “What about the invasion? What happened to Doom and his army of glorified trash cans?”
Tony thought as he stared at the closed door, his legs heavy as lead as his body refused to budge from that spot.
Steve choked out between whips, stomach bright red from abuse with welts striped over his pecs, dusty pink nipples pert with arousal.
Steve was about to leave him be, knowing that Tony needed the rest, but his eyes caught a flash of skin as Tony’s t-shirt rode up, exposing a bit of his tanned stomach. The soldier’s gaze lingered on the patch of flesh for a bit longer than what was probably considered appropriate, but he managed to tear his eyes away.
“One of these days, Cap’s gonna wish he wore a parachute.” Clint muttered from his perch by the edge of the open airlock, loading explosive arrows into his bow, rapid firing at the 40 feet tall mega iguanid while Tony rushed out of the ship, fully decked out in his armor and began shooting repulsor beams at the lizard.
He's a 24 year old guy from Brooklyn -- fresh out of college and desperate for cash, Tony’s probably seen his type before and as the owner of a lustrous porn studio he's probably seen hundreds of folks just like him come and go.
Tony didn’t like art, or rather he didn’t really have an interest for it, but something about touring the exhibits with Steve made it an enjoyable experience. Like how Steve went on about how he'd actually met Picasso on one of his USO tours in France and that the man had actually offered to paint him.
Steve turned to stare at him pointedly. “Stark, you are an
Steve's not sure where this newfound boldness had come from. Maybe the booze, or maybe the encouraging look on Mr. Stark's face is settling his nerves.
Steve answered uncertainly. Shy. He was repeating the few lines of dialogue he'd probably been given for the scene. The studio wasn’t praised for it’s complex screenplays, but there was a general guideline for how the scene was supposed to play out. Most of the time.
“Mmm?” Steve hummed, only half paying attention to the conversation as he quickly makes himself a sandwich.
“I was going to tell you --"
Last night with Tony had probably one of the best sexual experiences of his life, which said a lot considering the past few months had been filled with copious amounts of rigorous sex. Last night wasn’t crazy or anything, it had actually been pretty tame, but Tony somehow knew how to navigate his body in a way that fired up every individual nerve, like some kind of sex wizard. Steve’s never been with anyone so confident in their ability to please others.
A waitress, who was dressed in a very short black skirt with a white frilled apron brought two coffee cups to their table. Steve took his black, but Tony accepted a splash of almond milk and some honey in his own cup.
Steve looks at his friend and nods, resting his hand over Bucky's.
“Jarvis.” He grunted, tiny pieces of pulverized concrete rolling off his suit from the movement. “Status.”
Steve saw the brief pout cross over his son's face, but he obeyed without throwing a tantrum, which Steve was infinitely grateful for because Peter was as stubborn as him and Tony combined when he wanted to be.
Before Steve could get another word in, Tony had hung up on him, leaving him standing there dazed and confused, wondering why Tony needed him to go to the Burke Rehab center.
It’s a dirty play, but Steve’s always been a master of strategy and he plans to win this argument.
I am absolutely terrible at writing dramatic and interesting fight scenes, so be warned. I am not that great with elaborate dialogue.
“You could have ‘gotten to know me’ back home, I don’t see why you went through the trouble of taking me out.” Tony said, making air quotes as he spoke.
Everything suddenly made sense to him. Their constant dancing around each other, the fleeting thoughts, the way they just gravitated towards one another. Like two moths drawn to the same flame.
“Yeah but, did you want to? Be romantic with her, I mean.” Tony made sure to phrase his words carefully so as not to embarrass the poor soldier.
“Fuck…I need to be in you like right now.” Tony pants desperately.
“I said, I’m gonna jump.”
right now, I can’t just – “
“Yes.” The soldier replied almost instantly.
“So, how’s the whole ‘getting Stark to submit to your infallible acts of comradery’ going?” Natasha quipped, suddenly appearing out of nowhere, vaulting herself over the back of the couch and sinking into the spot next to him.
He opened his laptop up again, noticing that his screen had gone black from inactivity. Not that it mattered, his viewers had all left at this point anyway. Regretfully, he ended the stream, checking the total amount of donations that he'd received over the course of the last hour.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony clenched his jaw, teeth grinding as he felt the rage in his chest bubbling up to a breaking point. He wasn’t about to hand over everything he’d ever worked for to this colossal asshole just so he could turn it into some crooked money making scheme, but if Steve’s personal information got out it would ruin his life. Not only would his image be tarnished, but there were some real creeps out there on the internet and there was no telling what they would do if they got a hold of his home address.
Steve can feel that he’s teetering on the edge, so he snakes a hand between them to start viciously tugging at his cock, swiftly moving his fist up and down the length of his dick.
When Steve got his first pay cheque from Stark Studios he was certain that someone must have made a mistake in calculating his wages.
Tony just shrugged, deciding to leave it at that. He wasn’t the biggest sport’s fan, but he knew better than to argue with a man about his preferred sport’s team.
“You can play later honey, right now it's clean up time.”
“I’ve already told you I’m sensitive.”
Tony exhaled loudly, breath coming out heavy through his nostrils. “I spent all this time building up this image of you. Resenting you, hating you…” He shook his head, looking down at his hands. “Turns out you’re just a nice guy. A controlling dick at times, but generally a nice guy.” He took another breath and exhaled. “I spent my whole life hating you because my dad was so disappointed that I wasn’t like you. I wanted to hate you, but then you showed up, acting like Mr. Perfect and actually somehow got me to like you, and I just…I wanted to keep hating you.”
Steve’s heart sank into his stomach when he realized that Tony was not wearing the Iron Man suit, and by the looks of it there wasn’t one rushing towards him either.
Ever since their first meeting almost a year ago, Tony Stark continued to press his buttons in ways that even Steve’s controlled temper couldn’t ignore.
Tony’s heart leaped in his chest at the confession, and suddenly he felt like a kid on the playground after his crush just admitted that they
“I’m sorry I missed our date.”
Tony rose an eyebrow as he squeezed around Steve, determined to get to the coffee.
“We took out the army no problem. Doom scurried back to Latveria, I doubt we’ll be hearing from him for a while.” He continued. “Nat and Clint are leading the cleanup crew with SHIELD, Bruce is back at the tower calming down, and Thor is already celebrating our ‘triumphant victory’.” He added, half carrying Tony towards the bike.
Steve falters, hands clutching the base of his sweater as he tries to work up the nerve to take it off.
Peggy just pursed her lips together and shook her head. “It’s fine, Steve. He was older than I am now. We can’t all live forever.”
The beast screamed in agony as the fireworks sizzled inside its belly, the muscles rippling under its thick, scaly hide as the explosives went off. There was a loud booming noise, and then suddenly big, meaty lizard chunks were raining down from the sky, coating everything within the radius of the park in viscous green sludge.
More confused than anything, Tony cautiously walked over and reached for the folder. He wasn't sure what Stane was holding over his head, but whatever it was it couldn't be good.
“Tony Stark. Genius inventor, world renowned philanthropist, wealthy billionaire? You might have heard of me.” Tony humbly introduced himself. It was rare that someone didn’t recognize his face immediately with how often his name had been in the media, though he wouldn’t be too offended if this woman didn’t recognize him. People over the age of 65 who weren’t too big on new age tech hardly ever knew who he was, unless they’d heard him name somewhere in passing.
“But I’m free tonight?” He offered, hoping Tony wouldn’t mind the wait.
Enjoy the chapter.
Sam gave him a quick thumbs up before he headed off to the showers, wondering what this oh so important conversation Tony needed to have with him was all about.
“Pfft, whatever.” Clint muttered, rolling his eyes. “Anyway, I’m starving. Are we gonna grab some food or what?”
She laughed again, retracting her hand and laid it across her stomach.
His mouth nearly dropped to the floor, his heart twisting almost painfully in his chest as he took a hesitant step forward, certain that he must still be dreaming.
Well, that’s not exactly where he expected the conversation to go.
Despite Steve donning a Dodgers cap, the Dodgers hadn’t actually participated in this game.
A few days later, Steve hadn’t really heard much from Tony. Not that that was anything new, he just figured the brunet was busy working on one of his newest projects.
Tony handed the bear to Peter, who grabbed at it with eager hands.
Steve made a face, glancing over to one of the monitors that showed a very raunchy picture of him next to a line up of four others, his name taking up the #4 slot.
Steve shrugs off the fabric that’s desperately clinging to his shoulders, his own hands carefully popping open the buttons of Tony’s Armani. He only manages to get through two buttons before Tony stops him, hands shooting out to grab his wrists. Steve pauses, confused, hoping Tony hasn't suddenly decided boss-employee relations are taboo.
Steve hesitated, biting his lower lip as he mulled it over, the promise of cash was a tantalizing wager in exchange for his dignity.
She cuts him off again, her tone seeping through the phone much more demanding.
Swallowing thickly, Steve begins by running his hand down his chest, mindful to keep his face towards the camera. His nipples get hard when his fingers drag over them – he wasn’t kidding when he said he was sensitive, so he teases one of the nubs
The boys are bonding.
“So…is that a yes?” Tony asked with, the side of his mouth curving into a grin.
“Nah, your face is good. Guess I just got lost in thought.”
“Someone’s eager.” Tony remarks, a smirk on his face.
At first Tony hadn’t exactly handled it well, their breakup reigniting his destructive tendencies that led to him drinking way more than was healthy for him, but they still kept in touch throw emails and phone calls and the very rare lunch date.
She gave a breathy laugh, her fingers tracing the curve of his cheek. “I’m an old lady now.”
Steve drops his head back down and pushes himself off the edge of the bed. “You're… Tony Stark. Like… you know…”
” because it’s Tony Stark.
Monica trying to intervene with the escape is one thing, but getting trapped in outer space with broken engines, alone with Steve, is another. Especially considering there's the most likely chance they'll just die together.
“Well, uh… he sure did love you. Always wanted to be able to create more of… you, I guess? I don't know, honestly. Think he lost his mind a little bit with old age.” He wrinkles his nose and stands up for himself, and kicks his right leg out a few times where it's decidedly
"I know. I read your diary," he retorts swiftly, and the chuckle it gets out of Steve is like music to his ears. Oh, how he's missed Steve's laughter, his dry humour and sarcasm. The world thinks he's pure, nothing but the golden boy picture that he's had to paint in his time, and sure, he is sometimes, but—
Now or never, right?
Tony snaps the phone shut and doesn’t look at it again.
A sigh, something between disappointed and exhausted. Tony knows it even after two years of missing out on it, finds himself reacquainting himself with every bit of Steve’s ticks and tells. “I … heard that kid was with you. The one from Queens?”
There he goes again. This is the thing about Steve, he's incredibly perceptive and
“You didn’t wake up seventy years into the future. It’s…”
It’s hard to not smile at that, to not be pleased by such a turn of events. While he may not have been able to take that jump himself, it seems at least Steve has the gumption to take action.
He finishes his third cup of coffee and heads toward the park, picking up some breakfast tacos on his way.

Steve breaks the silence with a quiet, “I appreciate it, Tony.” He looks… well, he doesn’t look uncomfortable, but there’s a furrow between his brows that’s all too familiar now. That’s his thinking face. “I do, trust me. I guess I’m uh—” Steve sighs and this time when his arms crosses over his chest, it’s a defensive mechanism. A shield itself. “— it’s complicated. I don’t think you’d understand.”

To see him again. Alive, breathing, relatively okay for the most part.
no, i never believed i would be better than him,
for all the times you looked at him and
Hearing words like that is a punch to the gut. Tony has never been anybody’s home. Never thought he could be. In fact, Tony doesn’t even know what a home is. He’s always struggled with the concept of home. Is it four walls? Someone’s arms? Loved ones? It all feels abstract and a far reach for someone like him. But then comes Steve. Steve fucking Rogers with his kind blue eyes and his righteous spiels about freedom and fairness. Steve Rogers with his warm touch and his generous offers of breakfasts and lunches and dinner.
It'd been a day they'd been long expecting.
Tony filters through a million possibilities and excuses that he could attempt, but it’s only the inevitable, and if there’s anything Tony knows, it’s that he can only delay the inevitable for so long before it catches up to him. He can’t outrun his mistakes or his past no matter how hard and fast he sprints, no matter how much his legs burn. God, life is a series of never ending shit that piles up on him until he can’t bear it anymore.

Tony nods slowly, hands pressing down against cold metal. “I’m sure you guys would’ve figured out a solution even if I weren’t here.” His voice is flat. “You’d be too stubborn to stop, and everyone knows you don’t run in front of a damn bull if it’s charging straight at you, not unless you want to get your ass handed to you.”

With a swallow, he manages to crack a smile, as smug as it might seem where it's a little more of a curl on one side of the mouth. “My friends call me Tony.”
He's worried.
Begrudgingly, Steve’s plan, to an extent, works. Tony can’t seem to get rid of the damn thing. Two days with it, and all he can think about is how incapable he is at permanently keeping this piece of junk out of his sight. He can shove it in the drawer of his nightstand, dump it into the trash, and he still finds himself returning with the solid weight in his hand, cursing under his breath as he wipes it off with a cloth. He subconsciously thinks about it all the time, how it could buzz while he’s in the shower or when he’s off making sure Peter doesn’t get himself killed. It doesn’t ring or buzz, of course. He’s had it for

The others also agree with him, but Steve seems fairly adamant about getting involved, so they all stand down like the little toy soldiers they are. God, Tony hates being considered a soldier.

The memory that this would be the hour when Steve would be up, leaving for his run, is what settles deep in the crevices of each wire connecting to and from his heart. One would think he's got a flaw in his code.
As soon as he can, he relieves himself of the company, feeling the air as
While Barton is still making fun of Steve over some tech, Tony’s already handing him the tablet brief about a new mission.
Steve's hand drops from holding the curtain aside and turns around, head shaking lightly. “No. No, Mr. Stark, feel free to stay.”
They sit down on the bench together, and Tony tries to ignore the way their knees are just pressing against each other. He eats his breakfast taco and watches as other people pass by. It’s funny how Steve can actually get away with no disguise. There’s nothing that really distinguishes him that much from other buff white dudes out there, and Tony’s jealous.
He's come to realize that much of life is all about memories—the good and the bad—no matter where you are in life. And for him, most of the memories he's sifting through while slouched in his more often that not, uncomfortable chair, with a paper cup full of beer he would much rather throw out but
They manage to transport Steve back for the tower. Thor is just as curious as any other, and Nat thinks this is all a little insane, but she's been around long enough to know that this isn't necessarily the craziest thing she's ever experienced. Tony… Tony can only think about the dozens of Captain America posters on his wall growing up, the way his dear old dad barely ever shut up about one of his greatest creations. Tony's not sure he's ever going to live up to Captain America's legacy when he can barely fit the shoes of the Stark legacy himself. Even from the grave, Howard Stark makes him feel sick.

“Hate to break it to you, but we’re living history right now, minute by minute,” Tony says, and somehow, he’s now able to find the words. Whether they’re the right words or not are debatable, but at least he’s trying. “And you’re right, I didn’t wake up seventy years in the future where I’ve left behind loved ones and a life that’s all I’ve ever known. I won’t compare to that. But I can say that you don’t need to feel guilty. I think they’d feel bad if they could see you now, feeling stuck between the past and a future; because, for what it’s worth, I think they’d want you to have a future. A

yet—”
A shiver runs up his spine and he shudders. He’s tired and he’s cold and this darkness reminds him of a time in a cave, of his head in a bag shoved into a tub of water. Tony thinks he’s going to keep sinking, and when he turns his head, movement languid, restricted, he can’t quite see clearly toward the surface. He tries to deactivate the suit so he can get out, but electricity and water don’t work well together. He’s reaching up, slow and unsteady as he presses into the exact notches on his helmet, pulling it off in time—
"You asked for it, Tony."
He backs off then, but the smile still lingers on his face before he turns, glances out the window.  “Is this the same room from when we first fished you out?”

It doesn’t make sense for them to just fade from existence. None of it makes sense in Tony’s eyes, and though he’s seen this coming from fifty miles away, he still doesn’t know what to do. He didn’t know how to stop him, and he certainly doesn’t know how to

He blinks through the fog of whatever the hell that’d been, clears his throat and smiles. “Hey, hoped to catch you. Was afraid I’d have come by too late, but clearly not. Anyway, you want a breakfast taco?” Tony lifts up the paper bag he’s got. “Don’t tell me no. You’re running on an empty stomach, and at this point, I think you might’ve already run three laps anyway.”
Steve had almost forgotten about the whole reason he came here in the first place, holding the cheque between his hands like some sort of holy grail.
This time instead of a text notification, his ringtone started going off, the electronic jingle echoing through the locker room. Tony was calling.
There’s another beat of silence between them before Tony breaks it with a dramatic sigh.
“Start with one finger. Slowly. I know you’re a greedy boy but do as I say.”
Steve hesitated for a moment, biting his bottom lip. “Actually, I was going to ask if you wanted to have lunch with me today.”
“Oh.”
“Oh my god Tony, I am so sorry.” Steve said frantically rushing into his office. He was by Tony’s desk in just a few strides, reaching out to cup the side of his face.
“Oh…oh my god…” Steve exhaled shakily at the first touch of a wet tongue along the crease of his ass.
“There was this one girl. Back before the serum. I must have been in my early 20s.” He began, all shy and innocence.
“Look, I’m not going to force you to do anything you’re uncomfortable with, but if you cant even get naked in front of the camera we're going to have a problem.” He says, not to be unkind, just simply stating facts.
That being said, the tension between the two alpha dogs was still far from being water under the bridge. They still got under each other’s skin more often than not, but at least they could co-exist in the same building without breaking into a fight.
“Okay buddy, next one.” Steve said, setting down the empty box so that Peter could put things in it. Since Tony was busy packing up the kitchen, which meant sharp and potentially dangerous Items in the hands of a toddler, Steve was in charge of watching the baby.
The guards led him to a large, open room surrounded by huge widows, an enormous throne stationed in the middle where The Accuser sat. One of the guards shoved him forwards, and Tony stumbled at the base of the sovereign.
“Obediah.” He replied coolly, putting on his best poker face. “I didn’t know we had a meeting.”
“This isn’t working. This thing’s skin is composed of extremely compact calcium carbonate. It’s like shooting at a damn mountain range, our attacks are barely making a dent.” He said into the com, narrowly avoiding a roller coaster cart as it was flung towards him. “We’re going to need something more powerful. Anybody got some C4 on them?”
Tony shrugged. “It goes with the atmosphere. Women have been subjugated to centuries of repression and now they wanna show off their bodies. Just sit back and enjoy the movement like the rest of us, Cap.” He said, winking at another maid as she passed by their table. She just giggled and offered them a tiny wave before tending to the other patrons.
Tony returned the smile with one of his own but took the offered hand in a firm grasp. “Tony Stark. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, and occasional savior of the world.”
, Tony,” Steve interrupts, and he doesn’t even apologize like he usually does. Instead, he sits up straight as if pushing his shoulders back makes him look more confident. “You did. And that was a close call. Closer than I would’ve liked. If I had lost you there—”
Instead, he thinks he can hallucinate, watch an almost-Steve stand at the door to his lab with his arms crossed and a frown on his face.
“Well … yeah.”
“You’re right,” Steve says, laughter mixed with a hint of defeat.
Sort of. That’s a lie. He does want to talk to an extent, maintain some sort of company, but he’s never been the type to verbalize his emotions, let alone be open in
It’s almost like approaching a stray dog. Steve looks like he’s about to flee, and his mouth opens and closes and opens again. “You’re… ridiculous, and generous. Did you know that?”
When the sun sets and the blazing heat begins to dissipate into an uncomfortable humid air that feels like there's tension floating around him everywhere he goes, he thinks that maybe,
Still, it all makes no sense to him.
They all do, just in their own ways.
“Sure, yeah, whatever,” Tony manages to utter, but he lifts the bag up higher in front of Steve’s face. “So is that a yes to tacos?”

Call him a sentimental, nostalgic piece of work. His laughter is nothing but breathless, a tilt of his head back as eyes slide shut. He can’t believe this— the immediate response his mind and heart comes to. He doesn’t know why this seems to be the case, how carefully he can play his cards and still fall into Steve Rogers’ hands despite it all, how he thinks he’s always one step ahead but seems to end up right behind instead.
Tony thinks, growing more exasperated by the second.
Lips press into a thin line, and knuckles could bleed white. “Yeah, he was. Good kid, really strong and insanely intelligent. Made too many pop culture references.” Using past tense makes him want to hurl himself back into space and never return.

Tony can make an a hundred-slide slide powerpoint with names of all the people that have betrayed him and left him to dust. He knows what it’s like to be laying alone in bed, feeling like he’s both drowning and flying thirty-thousand feet in the air. He’s no stranger to ghosts and skeletons in his closet or the blood on his hands. Most would much rather flee before they have to handle all the monsters under his bed and the shadows outside his window.

The point is, I'm—jeez, you know I'm not good at this—sorry. I'm sorry." The way the words just come tumbling out of his mouth, letters and words rolling off his tongue faster than his brain can even process it.

—ask for it. Regardless, Tony slaps the punching lightly back in his direction and breathes out a terribly unconvincing and non-threatening, "Jerk."

“Mornin’.” He hums quietly, earning a ‘Mmm’ in reply, muffled slightly by the fact that Tony’s face was smooshed into Steve’s shoulder.
“He disobeyed protocol. We had a formation, and he just went off on his own.” Steve vented, his muscles rigid with leftover rage from his earlier encounter with the man in question.
He can hear Tony’s breath stutter, his perfect, suave composure broken for just an instant but Steve takes it as a victory.
“Why?” He asked, as if trying to fathom why a wholesome, straight-edged guy like Steve seemed so desperate for his friendship.
That being said, Steve wasn’t the type of man to avoid something because someone thought he couldn’t handle it. If someone Thought he couldn't do something, even with the best intentions, it always just made him want to do it even more just to prove a point. That sort of attitude got him in trouble more often than not, but hey, he was still here, wasn’t he? Besides, Steve's not one to sit idly when someone needs a hand.
“You disobeyed my command.”
“If I remember correctly, the plan was to keep the Godzilla wannabe away from the main city. Which I did.” Tony pointed out in his usual snarky tone, crossing his arms over his chest.
Steve's body collapsed into the couch cushions, limbs feeling deliciously numb after the release of tension.
“So what, you kidnapped me to give me a performance review?” He shot back.
Peggy looked at him, her smile wide and glowing as if she were reuniting with a long lost lover. “And I thought I’d never see you. I heard stories of the soldier who was found in the ice, but I thought my granddaughter was just being imaginative.” She laughed, a sniffle in her voice as a few tears rolled over her cheeks. “Oh, Steve. It’s so wonderful to see you again. You look exactly like you did 75 years ago.” She reached out and cupped his face, and Steve leaned into her touch. “I wish I could say the same for myself.”
(Please forgive any spelling or grammar errors. I proof read the whole fic but I was eager to post it so I might have missed a few)
Man, he could really use a Hulk right about now…
“Guess I better pay up.”
Steve’s mouth quirked into a tiny smirk as they walked towards the elevator, strolling next to Tony. “Fair enough.”
He heard the voice and scrambled to sit up, slamming the laptop shut as he hastily looked around the room for his discarded jeans.
After witnessing the legendary arguments between Captain America and Iron Man, the rest of the team was just glad that they finally seemed to cool down around one another. Especially Pepper and Rhodey, who had been on the receiving end of many a rant about Tony’s clear distaste for America’s iconic patriot.
The diner was just some hole in the wall nestled between a corner store and a coin wash. Not exactly the nicest establishment, but the food was good, the atmosphere was quiet, and the owners were nice so Steve usually came here when he found some time to himself.
they would do things together.
Their talks on these little trips are fairly surface-level. Plenty of innocuous history and art lessons on top of one too many innuendos, but it’s enjoyable. It just turns out Steve's not much of a personal-feelings type of guy, but Tony gets that. Every time he looks at himself in the mirror, he isn't always happy to see his reflection. And even when he is, he's able to pinpoint all flaws and imperfections that remind him that he's terribly human (

There's a few moments of silence. Tony doesn't find it that uncomfortable, but he gathers that maybe Steve needs a little bit of… time alone? So he starts to offer, “I can leave if you want—”
Royally fucked, actually.
His heartbeat's getting louder, and he's holding his breath (and he doesn't even know he's holding his own breath). Tony asks, "What should you have done a long time ago?"
“You sure gave us a scare there,” he says, leaning back in his chair next to Tony’s bed.

“A man after my heart.”
He can’t say that he necessarily saw this

In a blink of an eye, the lights fade in, and he can finally see Steve’s face properly, and they’re just…

Steve’s arms fall down to his sides, hands sliding into his pockets instead. Tony, on the other hand, hasn’t moved an inch from where he’s been since his ex waltzed into his workshop without notice. This is all a

on him. The numbness stings, but it eventually fades and he rounds the corner, leans his thigh against the end of the infirmary bed. “You alright?”
Thing is, Tony has usually been able to read Steve.
Steve's suddenly so much
He clears his throat before he starts his long-winded attempt at clearing things up. “Long story short, but you've been— there's no way to gently break it to you, as much as I'd like to do that— asleep for seventy years. Or, more specifically, you were frozen… frozen asleep? For seventy years,” Tony explains, waving his hands around vaguely as if that'll visually represent any kind of timeline. “I know this probably sounds crazy—”

—because as far as they've all been aware, Steve is
at you?”
“Why, did he not do that to you?”
The tight smile on her face showed she didn’t appreciate the formality.
The room is fairly large and mostly empty except for the filming equipment and some intimidating gear that Steve has barely any clue what it’s even for. It has something to do with bondage probably, but that’s as far as he can figure out just by looking at it.
Steve nodded and reached a hand out, offering it to Tony. “Steve Rogers.” He said with a charming smile.
He couldn’t believe how quickly his day had gone to shit. First he had to deal with Rumlow, now he had to deal with getting clocked by some guy in his own building? At least his day couldn’t get any fucking worse.
Surprisingly, the woman’s eyes brightened and she lifted a wrinkled hand adorned with several rings on each finger and pointed towards him. “Ah yes, I do know you, the technology man. You must be Howard’s boy. My, you do look just like him.”
Tony ignored that jab and just smiled. Their breakup had really taken its toll on him, and while he was mostly over the heartbreak of having the best and probably only woman he’d ever loved walk out on him, it was nice to see her again.
Sliding his hand over his stomach, Steve tugged the corner of the towel out of it’s knot until it loosened, letting the fabric drop around his ankles, exposing himself fully. He was already fully erect, his shaft flushed a dark shade of pink and straining against his lower belly. He took a seat on the wooden bench, spreading his legs apart and angling his hips up slightly. Steve took himself in hand, stroking a couple times to coax out a little bead of pre-come, then snapped the picture and hit send.
“Not stupid, genius.” Tony shot back moments later as he flew out of the warehouse with a huge box of heavy duty fireworks. “Let’s kill this thing in style.”
“As much as I’d love to keep talking to you, my flight leaves in thirty minutes and Pepper’s gonna kill me if I make her reschedule it. Again.”
“I’m not trying to tease or make fun of you or anything, really, I’m just curious. I mean, what about agent Carter? Everyone thought you two were a thing. The Captain America exhibit even talks about your romance.” Tony inquired with genuine interest.
Taking advantage of her trap, the Kree general gets up, pulling her weapon out of Steve and kicks him to the ground. Just as she's about to finish him off Tony speaks up.
Tony grabs him by the waist and side steps him, flipping them around so that their positions are mirrored and he’s the one pressing Steve against the desk. Tony’s hands are on his waist in a blink of an eye, tugging down the zip of his jeans and pushing them down to his ankles. Steve almost trips as he steps out of his pants, kicking them off to the side along with his shoes.
"I appreciate the concern Sam, but I'm okay. Just a little shaken up, that's all." His voice was a bit raw after nearly getting choked out, but all things considered Steve didn’t feel too distressed.
“Ah, yes. Making all these snuff films must be exhausting.” Stane mocked.
Steve feels the impact against his back when they hit the side of a building, crashing through the tinted glass window at full break-neck speeds.
Brown and blue eyes snapped towards him, Steve looking guilty and Tony feeling both betrayed and suspicious by the sudden bail.
Steve bit his lip, obeying Tony’s every word as he rolled the nub between his fingers, catching it between his thumb and index finger to pinch it. He couldn’t hold back the noises this time and shamelessly let a pitiful cry slip through his lips.
Maybe it was the fact that he was feeling slightly inebriated from the whispering vapors of the rum, but his gaze couldn’t help but drift to the soldier’s backside as he watched Steve’s climb into the driver’s seat.
“I love the enthusiasm but I think that’s enough for today. We'll pick things up tomorrow. Until then go home and try not to jerk off, you’ll need the stamina for tomorrow.” He said with a wink.
Sam snorted, cracking a wide grin. “Uh uh man, this is different. Besides, you’re ditching me for an older, much richer man. Gotta say I’m a bit hurt that I ain’t good enough for you.”
“Hey!” He shouted, holding the base of his arm by his elbow to absorb some of the shock as he fired a repulsor beam from his gauntlet. The energy beam shot Doom right in the back of the head, his body going rigid as he slowly turned to face them with an expression of malice on his metal mug. “Shouldn’t you be bothering Richards or something? I thought he was your greatest nemesis, stealing your girl and all that.”
Fully nude, he leans back, draping one arm along the back of the couch. “Better now?” He said, voice challenging. He still felt apprehensive about this, but Steve could be a sassy little shit when he wanted to. Especially when he wanted go prove someone wrong.
“I have a scene today.” He said a bit dejectedly. He didn’t want to brush Tony off, but he did have a job to do.
“I should be asking
He made a dash towards the front desk area, hoping to deescalate the situation before anyone (mainly Bucky) got arrested. It wouldn’t be the first time one of them had to bail the other out of jail for disorderly conduct. A criminal record was the last thing Bucky needed interfering with his stance in the VA.
“Oh, don’t bother dearie. That lump probably survived the war and changed his name. We could never really stand each other.” She said humorously. Tony liked her. “Well don’t just stand here and chat with an old woman like me. Go on! Enjoy yourselves. There’s plenty of food so don’t hold back.” Agnes said, giving Steve a few hard pats across the stomach, making the blond laugh as she coped a feel at his muscles.
The genius mechanic was tinkering with the circuitry on his gauntlet when ‘Welcome to The Jungle’ was suddenly cut off mid chorus and instead replaced by the charming sound of Jarvis’ voice.
Steve tipped his head back, letting a breathy sigh slip out from his parted lips, twisting his fist around the head of his cock which made him spurt a drizzle of pre-come.
“Ask me nicely.”
Eventually Tony had to pull away for air because he just didn’t have the same lung capacity that the super soldier did and he really didn’t want to ruin the moment by collapsing due to suffocation. Even as Tony sucked in desperate gulps of oxygen Steve refused to give him space, nudging the side of his jaw with his nose.
Tony tackles him, swiping his arm across the desk’s surface to clear some space, sending a bunch of papers and office supplies scattering to the floor. Tony pushes him down until his back is flat against the desk and settles between his spread legs, grinding down against him.
The camera faces him, zooming in on his face, soaking in how raw and red his mouth is from overuse. Steve flicks his eyes up at the lens, staring straight on with the best ‘completely fucked out’ expression that he can muster, and then the video feed cuts.
but the reality of it was…. Honestly a little underwhelming. Not underwhelming in the sense that the sex had been bad, oh no. The sex -- or at least what they’d gotten to before he passed out—had been fantastic. His body still tingled in the places Tony had touched him, echoes of last night’s pleasures. Steve wasn’t a stranger to good sex, especially given his current profession, but last night was something else entirely. Tony Stark was an extremely talented and considerate lover, probably the best Steve had ever experienced.
Rumlow snorts, moving to step around the 6’2 wall of defensive muscle in his way but then stops right beside Steve, turning his head and leaning in slightly. Steve tries not to cringe away at the acrid smell of cigarettes as hot, moist air tickles his ear.
Tony didn’t think much of Steve’s reaction at first, but then it hit him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cleanup was going to be a nightmare, but at least the threat was neutralized.
“You know I wasn’t always Captain America.” He muttered snidely, clearly a bit embarrassed by Tony’s reaction to his lack of sexual prowess. “And ladies weren’t exactly lining up to ‘dance’ with a fella whose 100 lbs soaking wet and suffers from chronic asthma attacks, if you know what I mean.” He said, swiping the flask from Tony to take another drink, even if the only lasting effect of the rum an intense burning in his throat.
Steve swallowed his tongue and quelled his own rising temper. “No, I’m not going yell at you. Your actions yesterday were reckless and impulsive, but your plan did work.” He said, surprising himself with how gentle his words came out. Judging by Tony’s expression, the other was just as shocked.
His ego is so inflated Steve supposes it would be impossible not to be completely enraptured by it .
Steve makes a face as he sees what Bucky’s holding -- two bowls of some chunky looking brownish-orange mush on top of what he imagines is some soggy, overcooked rice.
“You’re not going to change my mind.” Tony tossed back his drink, almost numb to the harsh burn of aged whiskey as it slid down his throat. They’d had this conversation over a dozen times, and he really wasn’t in the mood to argue right now.
Mildly irritated seemed to be Steve’s default expression, so Tony didn’t really make anything of it.
“How about you give me an IOU and I can collect payment in the morning?” Tony chuffed, offering him a lazy kiss.
The bed he was sprawled out across was soft as a cloud and smelled faintly of lavender jasmine detergent mixed with sweat and sex. It took him a good second to realize he wasn’t in his bed, and after the initial moment of panic from waking up in an unfamiliar setting he quickly relaxed, remembering the night before.
Tony didn’t look at him, but Steve could tell that he was listening.
There was a deafening roar from outside and the whole ship rattled as something smashed into the side of it, and suddenly there was a Hulk sized hole in the side of the airship.
“I don’t know, I’m kind of partial to the former.” He said deviously, turning on the Stark charm he was famous for.
No one commented when the two walked in, Steve still practically glued to Tony’s side as the brunet hobbled towards the curved bar for a much needed drink.
Despite his utmost respect for her, Tony didn’t particularly like not being the center of attention, so he cleared his throat.
Tony smiled and clapped his hand on Bruce’s shoulder. “There we go. Come on big guy.”
“Tony, this is Agnes. Her husband was a member of my Howling Commandos.”
The white haired woman twitched as if she’d just been jolted away from deep thought, dull eyes resting on Steve’s face. “Steve?” She breathed out.
Tony gave another shrug, favoring his drink over the complex dish of beets, carrots and some sort of fake, meaty substance.
Steve had never been one for casual relationships in the past. There were a few hook ups here and there, sure, but typically if he liked someone enough to sleep with them he expected more from the relationship. Then again, that was before he'd signed on to be a porn star.
He imagined Tony dressed in his fancy business suit, the one that probably cost more than his rent, getting off on the sound of his voice. The mental image was enough to make Steve bite back a moan, tightening his grip around himself.
If you asked Howard Stark what his greatest accomplishment was it wouldn’t be his multi-billion dollar company, or his incredible technological advances and it sure as hell wouldn’t be his overwhelmingly disappointing son.
“I have been eating.” He muttered, still not looking up from his work as he pointed towards a cluttered table with glasses upon glasses that were covered in a green film.
“Do you have any lube?”
Tony scoffed and flew away from the thrashing beast, hovering above ground. “Yeah, that’s boring. I’m going with my plan.” He said, and propelled himself towards one of the park warehouses in search of explosives.
Steve really didn’t approve of Tony drinking while on medication, but if he just had the one drink than he’d refrain from stirring up the inevitable argument. If anything, hopefully it would just knock him out so that he could catch up on some decent sleep.
Tony gives a guttural moan as Steve’s ass clamps down on him like a vice, holding out just long enough to fuck the blond through his orgasm before he finishes, hips twitching with every pulsing spurt before finally collapsing on top of Steve, spent and exhausted.
“Ya, I don’t think that’s a possibility Cap.” Tony said, eyes darting frantically around the collapsing spacecraft for an escape plan.
“Hey, no hard feelings here. I’m still in the ranks.”
“Look, if you don’t want to I underst-“
“Actually, it sort of is a big deal.” Steve continued, eyes flicking away from him.
So I actually got this chapter out a lot faster than I initially thought. Don't expect the next one to come out that quickly, but I will hopefully try to get it out in no more than a week. I know there wasn't a lot of meat in this chapter, but things will progress a bit more in the next one so stay tuned!
“Just a fancy pace maker, ignore it.” He said, his voice tight but not angry.
Booze probably wasn’t exactly the best thing to put into his system considering he’d just been given a carefully calculated cocktail of ibuprofen, naproxene and a mild derivative of opium, but nothing really dulled the pain quite like a stiff drink.
Who knew that an adult film site could be so swanky.
He was speechless. This was a joke, right? It had to be. Yeah, sure, he’d been camming for the last few months, which was
Side note, for anyone curious about when Rumlow is coming in since he's mentioned in the character list, next chapter is for you!!
of knowing I would get to you in time.”
Steve took in Tony’s response for a moment, like he was savouring the words. There was the briefest flash of disappointment on his features when he mentioned his dad’s thoughts on the matter, and Tony wasn’t really sure how he was supposed to take that.
I know I haven't posted in a while, I've been busy this past week. But this chapter is a lot longer so I hope that makes up for it. I also got rid of chapter titles because it's too frustrating to think of titles.
“Uh oh…!” The boy said, looking at the spilled contents on the floor. “Big mess.”
fired? That piece of shit
As he made his way over Peter lifted his arms up in silent demand. Tony didn’t need to ask, bending over without hesitation to pick up the boy with a low grunt. “Geez squirt, what has Papa been feeding you, lead?”
Tony pulls out his Starkwatch, ready to send out the Assembly Alert when a spear shoots out at him out of nowhere, smashing into his wrist and setting off a spark, nearly slicing off his hand.
“I’m fine.” Bucky hissed, body tense and rigid in defense before his shoulders slumped and he left the spoon sticking up in the ravioli to run a hand through his loose, messy hair. “I’m just…still getting used to this, that’s it. I’ll be okay.” He added in a more reassuring tone.
“Tony!” Cap called to him, cutting the engine and hopped off the bike to kneel beside him. “Hey, you okay?” He asked with a hint of what sounded like actual concern.
“You never heard of a brunch cocktail?” Tony shot back with a little eyebrow wriggle, but couldn’t find anything even remotely alcoholic on the list of drinks so he gave up his search and just set the menu back down.
“Iron Man wait, cease fire!” He shouted, but either Tony didn’t hear him, or as per usual, chose to just disregard his warning because the blast of energy burst from his chest in a concentrated stream towards their enemy.
“I’ll give you a few days to think over what’s more important to you; you’re company or your precious fuck boy.” He laughed.
“You ever done porn before, kid?”
They really shouldn’t have been surprised. At this point after going up against creatures from other universes, immortal magical beings and armies of world domination-obsessed super robots, nothing came as a surprise to these heroes.
The next morning, Tony zombie-walked his way down to the communal kitchen space, his body instinctively heading towards the thick, rich smell of hazelnut dark roast out of habit.
Tony scoffed. “Oh, I bet you’ll try. But the answer’s still no lady. You said you’ve heard of me, right? I bet you’ve also heard about the Avengers then. Little group of indie superheroes commanded by a guy who really doesn’t like bullies.”
Steve frowned. “Well, I suppose I’m just a little old fashioned.”
One of the attendants walked by to pour some fresh lube on the machine's dildo, making sure it was good and slick, and with a quick warning they were filming again.
“You won’t win him over by being Captain America.” She said simply, her lips quirking into a knowing grin.  “You have to earn his respect by being Steve Rogers.”
The two toured the museum, shoulders bumping on occasion from how close they were walking together. The trusty baseball cap and sunglasses glasses disguise was working flawlessly for them once again. Tony had to wonder if New Yorkers were blind, or if seeing earth's mightiest heroes was starting to lose its allure.
Whether it was dealing with evil and destructive monsters, or separating Thor and Clint from fighting over the last Poptart, peace and quiet was hard to come by around here.
Tony could sense the double meaning behind his words, and he smiled reassuringly at the soldier.
Tony Stark is a grown ass man and yet here he is, acting like a love-struck teenager because Captain America likes hanging out with him. Geez, what has he become?
Steve let out another laugh and handed him the bowl of batter and the mixing spoon.
Natasha shrugged, giving him a sly, sideways smile. “Well, you are sort of forcing yourself on him.”
Steve nodded and tightly gripped Bucky’s flesh arm, tugging him off to the side until they were out of ear shot. His tone quickly went from polite to furious once they had some privacy.
Steve hears the sound of a drawer opening, and before he knows it two slick fingers are being pressed up inside his ass. The sudden pressure and the shock of cold lube makes him gasp in surprise, hips lifting up off the desk to grind back down against the digits.
“Okay, who invited Godzilla to the party?” Tony ever so sarcastically remarked, from the co-pilot’s seat of the Avenjet.
Tony made a face, arching an eyebrow. “Breakfast, what breakfast?” He asked, confused when Steve set a plate of perfectly cooked eggs, bacon, and a couple slices of toast in front of him. He was the perfect soldier and an excellent housewife, geez, the serum really did give him everything. “Since when do I get breakfast?”
“You’re fired.”
The sensations coursing through his body right now are intense.
Steve smiled sheepishly. “Yeah, I guess you could say that.” He took a step closer, closing in on the already short distance between the two of them. “Although I was thinking more in a ‘I’d like to take you out on a proper date’ sort of way.”
Hala smiled at him icily. “Life requires sacrifice. One soul for another.”
He should have grabbed a towel, or maybe kept some wet wipes in his office. Then again, he didn’t usually make a habit out of jerking off to his employees. Tony grabbed for some tissues, cleaning himself off as much as he could before tossing them in the trash bin under his desk. The sound of a breathy gasp caught his attention back to the screen.
One by one they shuffled into the Avenjet, taking off in record time while agent Coulson quickly briefed them on the situation at hand.
The brunet gave a laugh, licking the chocolatey goo off of his finger. “Ha. You beat me by one second.”
Tony hummed and shoved another cracker into his mouth.
Steve hadn’t expected Mr. Stark to dive right into it, but he supposed the porn industry wasn’t exactly known for its conventionalisms.
“Where’s Stark going?” He asked, notching another arrow.
The old woman reached both hands out to cup his face, crystal eyes watering. “Steve. Oh, it’s really you. I can’t believe it.” She wept.
Bucky yanked his arm out of Steve’s grasp,
“No, no. I'm fine, just ah, spilled coffee on my lap.” He says quickly, fingers tightly grasping at Steve’s hair.
Steve barely got a breath in before he was back handed, head turning with the force of the blow. His cheek stung from the smack, the skin split where a ring must have cut into the soft flesh. He tasted copper, but he couldn’t really tell at the moment if it was his blood or not. He felt lightheaded, unable to really keep track of the commotion as he focused on getting air in his lungs. Then, a voice broke through the fog.
Tony gave a nod, both shocked and a bit proud of how accepting Steve was. Then he wrinkled his nose, glancing at Steve out of the corner of his eyes.
“Look, I know Rumlow’s not an easy guy to work with, but we've got a deadline here. Can’t you convince the kid to sign back on?”
A few of you were wondering when Rumlow will make an appearance since he's in the tags and well...voila! Not the greatest character introduction, but some actual plot in on its way. Thanks a million for everyone who waited patiently for me to update and left kudos and supportive comments, your feedback really is what pushes me to keep writing the story.
Steve ripped the door off of a car when they opened fire, lunging for Tony’s wrist and pulled him behind the sheet of metal as the bullets ricocheted off of the frame. “Are you sure taunting him is the best idea when you’re armor-less and I don’t have my shield?” He said, holding the car door like he would his shield, but it wasn’t made of vibranium alloy, and these weren’t your run of the mill ammunition.
“Because we’re a team, Tony.” The super soldier answered simply, breaking Tony from his train of thought. “I’m not asking that we become best friends over night, but we should at least stop hating each other. All of this pointless arguing really brings down the morale. I need teammates that I can trust, and who trust me in return.”
Tony gave a mischievous eyebrow waggle. “You know it.” Tony shifted on his elbows and once again turned to Steve. “So you really haven’t had anyone before?”
“I'm sure I can handle it.” Steve shoots back stubbornly.
Tony slid into a seat by the island counter, cradling his face in his hands as he watched Steve fiddle about the kitchen, twirling utensils in his grasp and moving with utmost grace.
Mr. Stark didn’t seem convinced, but he flicked his wrist at Steve either way to signal the go ahead. “Whenever you're ready.”
He pulled up his stream again and went to his inbox, hitting reply on the message.
He reached out a hand to splay his fingers over the flat plane of Tony’s stomach where the two halves of his shirt fell open, feeling smooth, firm skin under his fingers. He moved upwards, trailing his touch along Tony’s flank and under his pectoral, stopping when his fingers brushed up against warm steel. He was about to ask what it was, but Tony grabbed his wrist and moved his hand back down.
When he was gone Tony took a breath to control himself, then promptly said fuck that and reached for his discarded whiskey glass and shattered it against the wall.
Tony coughs a bit, grunting at the ache in his chest from where Steve bulldozed into him like a battering ram. That was going to hurt in the morning, but at least he wasn’t a pile of mangled flesh and bones on the concrete, so there was an upside.
In hindsight, maybe they hadn’t.
The billionaire turned the relic over in his hands. “And if I do somehow manage to get it working, then what? It resurrects people, right? That sort of thing usually comes with a price.”
A low whine was punched put of him as the man inside his ass started fucking him raw, fingers digging into his hips as he pummeled him.
Steve let his head fall back against the cushions with a long sigh when he felt Tony get back to work, rubbing the flat of his tongue along his rim and occasionally letting it prod inside. He’s never let someone eat him out before. The idea of someone’s tongue in his ass always sounded a bit too daring for him, but Tony was quickly changing his stance on that as he worked his magic.
"Why'd you smash the reactor, Cap?"

Steve adjusts… surprisingly well.
"Uh, yeah, did you not hear the very apparent knocking to the rhythm of

You don't have to blame yourself. I sure as hell don't blame you for anything. You did what you could at the time. I think that's more than what anyone could have asked for given what you were going through."
After a while of on and off small talk, Tony figures he has to get into the deep stuff. And by God, is he terrified. He’s not usually the one offering, because he’s bad. He’s fucked up, he’s made terrible mistakes that feel irreconcilable, and he thinks he simply isn’t as

Unfortunately for Tony, he hasn’t slept in… well, a while. Halfway into the movie at 8PM and he’s already dozing off. The dialogue turns into white noise and it doesn’t help that the soundtrack starts to play, all soft and gentle. Everything becomes a blur, and suddenly, it’s silence.

He drops his head back down, chin hitting his chest lightly, eyes raising to meet Steve’s gaze. And it’s not cold steel he meets. It’s fond, familiar warmth, reminding him of what they once were. A clear blue sky. The sight of taking a fresh breath after holding it for so long under the unmerciful waves of the sea. He almost says it, almost says “
