“Sherlock Holmes! Put the cigarettes away. You know how much it hurts John to know you’ve been smoking again. You were doing so well, too.” He tried not to shift guiltily. He knew. He knew goddamn it but his fingers had been twitching since he’d sat down to wait in the waiting room hours ago, and cigarettes were the least harmful thing he could easily obtain.
to do this. He was allowed to touch John, and yet he often found himself yanking his hands away as if he'd been caught doing something he shouldn't.
“Oh darling, it’ll be alright. Have you seen John? They’ll keep him up to date for sure.” Mrs. Hudson cooed at him and Sherlock felt his hackles rise. She was missing his
Down the halls, through the doors, up stairs, ignoring the elevators - tiny moving claustrophobic traps, never use them-, up more stairs, into the hall, check the signs, up more stairs, and enter the loud, echoey cafeteria. He wanted to turn around and leave the moment he’d entered. He wanted to find a hole and bury himself in it. Return to Baker Street, go to bed, and pull the blankets over his head the way he used to when he was small and trying to block out everything that was too much. The smells of food assaulted his nose and his transport almost protested - his stomach lurched and coiled into an even tighter knot at the thought of food- and he suppressed a gag. In and out he reminded himself. He was here for John, he could do this.
“I didn’t mean to wake you,” Sherlock forced his hands to keep running through John’s hair. It still shocked him that he was
“John,” Sherlock said his name quietly and John’s eyes flicked up to his in acknowledgement. Sherlock loved that, there was no unnecessary speaking with John. They could communicate with looks alone when the need struck them. “How aren’t you worried about this? Myocarditis is especially rare in infants and her still developing immune system may not be able to-,”
“They won’t tell me anything about her condition because I’m not related to her. Can you do her paperwork? I tried to pretend I was, but I don’t know your family medical history...” He trailed off, embarrassed, grateful when John silently accepted the forms without any quips that he could just deduce it or about how good of a liar Sherlock normally was. His heart surged knowing that John knew he was in too much of a panic to deduce much of anything, and Sherlock didn’t want attention drawn to it. He despised the lapse in physical contact as he resumed his seat and John took the one beside him, clipboard balanced in his lap.
“When I was in the A&E waiting room I was trying to find a diagnosis for Rosie. John showed up and took me back to his office. He told me to get something to eat in the cafeteria but I’m on the fire escape smoking.” He had to pull the phone slightly away from his ear at Mrs. Hudson’s shriek of his name.
a suggestion, Sherlock. When I come back you better have eaten something.” He disappeared through the door and reappeared just as fast, darting back into the room to press a brief kiss against Sherlock’s forehead.
Her reply came almost instantly and Sherlock...he didn’t know. He wanted John and Rosie and Baker Street back. He hated this stress and change.
“Will I still be watching her?” It was so quiet, and spoken to the floor, that Sherlock wasn’t sure that John would have heard him. When he risked a sideways glance at him, John was staring at him in disbelief.
the person you were in love with? Sherlock had no idea. More data needed?). He squeezed John’s hand, unsure of what else to do to communicate anything that he was feeling and John squeezed back in acknowledgement. He let go then, despite Sherlock’s quiet sound of protest, and took the paperwork up to the receptionist. He had a quiet conversation with her for a moment before returning to his seat beside Sherlock. Their hands found their way back to each other and Sherlock wasn’t sure who had initiated it first this time, or if they had both done it at the same time.
“Sherlock, you need to stop right there. If you keep that up you’re going to play a game of what ifs with yourself until you’re exhausted.” John said sternly, forcing Sherlock to break off and stare at him, fear written across his usually impassive, cold features. He began to rub circles against Sherlock’s hand again hoping it might help to calm the detective down. “Everything that you’re saying might be true, but essentially those are just statistics. In the end, this is all up to her and how well she’s able to fight it. I can’t make any accurate predictions or judgements when I haven’t seen her, or heard confirmation of a diagnosis or her current condition. That doesn’t mean that I’m not worried sick about her, but I am a doctor and a soldier, remember? I’m trained to remain calm, or at least pretend to be calm, in situations like this. Doesn’t mean that I’m not working to not overthink what might happen if she can’t get through this. I’m just pretty good at being able to look like I’m not.” Sherlock’s brain was in overdrive, calmed by John’s steady presence and warm hand in his, while simultaneously whipping through all possible outcomes of the situation at lightning speed. It was dizzying and he leaned his head against John’s as they sat quietly in silence, borrowing strength from the other, just as they always did. He really wanted a cigarette.
A quick glance around the flat told him everything that he needed to know about John’s day. He’d come home and turned on the kitchen light. He hadn’t gone into their bedroom because the door was still open a quarter of an inch just as Sherlock had left it when he exited it this morning. John also had not gone to the bathroom, it’s door still open just halfway as Sherlock had also left it this morning. John was still in his work clothes. His work bag was on the floor beside the front door but he was still wearing his jacket. John had simply come home from work, turned a light on in the darkening flat and immediately laid down on Sherlock. He most likely hadn’t mean to fall asleep waiting for him to exit his mind palace, Sherlock reasoned, but John often slept an average two hours more after a hard day at work. And hard days at work had been all the more frequent once he quit the horrible job at that boring surgery and took a more exciting job in the trauma center at St. Bart's. Not that Sherlock minded, he enjoyed being close to John.
“What if it was my mold cultures?” John raised his head then, an eyebrow quirked upwards in a silent question. “What if they made her sick? I thought I kept her an adequate distance away from them at all times but maybe-,”
“Are you sure you’re alright? You’re only this clingy when there’s a particularly hard death. Do you think that you need to visit Ella again?” Sherlock carefully guided John into their bedroom. He knew John hated the therapist but he wasn't good at feelings. He didn't know how to help this.
, Sherlock loved this man. The room was deadly silent except for the pager that John pulled out of his scrubs pocket, silencing the beeping.  He took Sherlock’s hand, tugged him out of his chair, and led him through the interior doors into the corridors of the A&E. Sherlock couldn’t help replaying John’s little speech on a loop in his mind palace. He would have expected John to immediately latch onto the gay slur that the woman had used. He should have leapt at the chance to chant his mantra of ‘not gay!’ at anyone in the room that would listen. Instead, John had leapt down the woman’s throat at her implied insult that John was not a good doctor, and her hatred of homosexuals in general, and a sense of pride surged through Sherlock’s chest. John was the best doctor he knew and that woman deserved what she’d gotten.
“Of course you will. I don’t trust her with anyone as much as I do with you, even when you take her to crime scenes to investigate murders. You would never intentionally put her in harm’s way and if you did, I know that you’ll keep her safe, especially with Moriarty and his web still out there...” The unspoken mention of Sherlock’s two years away to wipe out the web (Unsuccessful due to numerous kidnappings, sessions of torture, and a slight miscalculation on his affection for one John Watson) hung between them for a moment and Sherlock wished he could grab John and pull him close enough that their persons began to intermix so that John could feel exactly how desperate and alone Sherlock felt without John during those years. (That pattern again. Was it normal to feel such a desperate need to completely
“Myocarditis.” John murmured softly, staring at their hands now too. “Which can come on incredibly suddenly in infants and appear to be flu like symptoms if you aren't looking too closely.” He dropped his head in his hands with a heavy sigh. “Did you really call your mother to ask her about Rosie? You never call your mother voluntarily.” Sherlock could hear the amusement in John’s voice and could almost see the small smirk that would be on John’s lips if he raised his head. He was glad that he caused John enough amusement to still smile through the worry about Rosie.
“John or I will call you,” Sherlock promised before hanging up. He stared at his phone. With a deep breath he opened the messages from his mother. Best to get it all over with at once.
I am so incredibly sorry that it's taken me literally a year to update this. Senior year turned out to be a lot worse than I thought it was and I've taken on a full time job for the summer, and I know those are kind of excuses but I'm here now. I have the next chapter somewhat planned out and a vague idea of what I'd like to happen after that. I'm hoping to get this fic almost finished before I start college. My first day is August 23rd, so we'll see. Again, I'm so sorry that it's taken so long to update this story, but I promise that I haven't abandoned this story and I don't have any plans to.
Obligatory text to his mother taken care of. John should be proud of him. Right. John wasn’t there and because John wasn’t there he had sent him off on a quest for food in the hospital cafeteria. His transport would reject food currently, but he could get a coffee and something that would keep for John, he would be hungry at the end of his shift.
“I’m sorry John. I didn’t know what to do,-” Sherlock started frantically but he cut off as John shook his head against his chest.
John made a quiet snuffling sound against Sherlock’s chest and he watched as John, still completely asleep, burrowed himself more firmly against Sherlock’s body. He lifted his hand and carefully began to thread his fingers through John’s short blonde hair.
“Not now. You know the jist of it, I’m sure, and that’s enough,” He murmured before snuggling back into Sherlock, his face pressed firmly against his chest again. They laid quietly on the couch together as the flat was slowly overtaken by darkness. Sherlock knew he was not a patient person, but this was a scenario that he loved. He was never impatient for John to leave his arms. He’d much prefer if he never left them.
“Isn’t it just as bad for you to try to diagnose your own daughter as it is for me to search the internet for an amateur diagnosis?” One withering look from John wiped the faintest of smiles off of Sherlock’s face and he took a deep breath.
“I want John,” His voice broke and the tears were welling up in his eyes. He really really didn’t want to cry on the phone with Mrs. Hudson but he didn’t know what to do anymore. He always had John to help with the emotional side of things.
“Sir? Were you getting something?” Sherlock jolted back to the present to see the cashier staring at him. He quickly stared at the menu and ordered a coffee and two muffins. He may not have any plans to eat his muffin but pretenses were very important with John Watson. Sherlock collected his purchases and made his way back to John’s office, forcing himself not to make a stop at the door leading to the fire escape again.
“I’ll let you go, but you keep me updated when you get news, young man. I don’t want to be the last one to know something.” Her telling him off felt almost worse than his own mother scolding him.
“You have the ability to care deeply about a complete stranger. Of course you’re going to be worried about her. But you’ve done what you could. She’s still alive and that counts for something. She still has her whole future ahead of her to make something out of it.” Sherlock’s deep voice was quiet in the dark room and John caught his hand to squeeze it.
Suddenly, the brakes of the train screeched so violently that a rain of fiery sparks blew out of them and flew by our window like the meteoric shower. In the next second the train stopped with such a sharp loss of momentum that I was practically ejected out of my seat and ended as the hodgepodge of twitching legs and arms somewhere on the ground. In the corridor outside, a loud thud and a string of juicy French curses were audible, a tell-tale sign that Inspecteur Ganimard fared no better than me out there. Sherlock too staggered dangerously and saved himself from falling only by grasping the door-leaf by both hands.
“The DI has his phone on him. He has me listed as SH among his contacts. When I will be back with the crutch, I’ll call him. You will take him out after that – unhurt – and bind him to the railing outside, leaving him alone there, so that I can glimpse him before I hand you the crutch. If I don’t see him alive and kicking, the crutch will end at the bottom of the Thames… do you accept this deal?”
“Finland Street it is then. But only for a short while, all right? I don’t intend to spend there all night…”
I looked at Sherlock sharply and making sure that I have his full attention, I nodded decidedly. His slanted eyes narrowed into blazing slits and he stopped in his tracks, arresting the impatient movement of Ganimard with the imperial gesture of his arm.
I floored him fair and square. Sherlock was speechless for a while. Still, he noticed my shameless grin and came to his senses just as quickly.
His words slowly faded-away. He remained standing opposite Sherlock in a stiff, challenging pose, his heart on his sleeve, his stomach cold and heavy, fighting the slight bout of anxiety.
“Damned!” Using this uncharacteristically harsh word Sherlock plopped at the seat next to me and shouted at a cabbie: “Take us to the Pont Vieux! Quickly!”
He bowed his head to both of us in greeting and passed us slowly, heading right to Didier and raising both of his hands to him. The young man was at his side in a flash and they embraced amiably. As they separated, they started to walk towards the town almost immediately, never looking back at the huge building which held one of them prisoner a while ago. Vernet intercepted them on their way and engaged them in a boisterous conversation, his ringing laughter reverberating through the place like thunder.
I hesitated, torn between the need to tend to the fainting woman and the wish to assist Sherlock urgently. Then I remembered that the murderer is still supposed to be around and my wish transformed itself into a pressing concern. I rushed out hastily, slipped into the open gate to my right, passed through the archway with the low ceiling and emerged at the courtyard.
The second compartment was quite rambunctious as I approached it. A discreet look into its interior showed me two respectable matrons and the white moustached man caught in a heated debate, laughing five-year old girl engaged in a play with a basket which contained meowing black kitten and the burly baby-boy sitting on the knees of one of the women. The baby emitted the loud shrieks, evidently competing against the adults in this razzle-dazzle tournament. The party was so obviously Italian that I didn't even stop and continued in my course to the third compartment.
It was too late for any festivities and we were all in the dumps a bit, so Vernet didn't even try to propose any night entertainment. He accommodated Didier in the saloon and then he led us upstairs, to the two-bed guest room. Discreet good-night, softly closed door, the subtle sound of the steps descending downwards – and soon, we were left alone.
“But as we already know, the frail protection of the participants that the cubicle offered didn’t last and De Vries killed Murray in anger with his crutch there. The cubicle was booked on Murray’s name so maybe he hoped to run off quickly after landing, before his crime was properly discovered. He didn’t know that Murray brought the vial containing hydrocyanic acid with him. While he was dying, Murray threw the vial to the ground and stepped on it, changing the whole cubicle into the gas chamber in no time.”
Sherlock looked to be taken aback by this suggestion too and he had a decency to protest: “To be honest, I'm a bit tired right now and I'm sure Doctor Watson is in a similar state. We were just going to find some hotel and to take lodgings there for a night…”
One of the huge gorillas held Sherlock by the throat, thick fingers digging into that frail, milky white column with abandon. Yet Sherlock did not fight, merely looked at our captors with contempt. The wrapped up crutch lay on the ground by the tips of his shoes.
“All right,” Sherlock capitulated. “We will try it the other way around. Have you ever heard of Cathars, John?”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “But one thing the conspirators didn't count with was the coal that scattered all around Arnaud at the time of his death. When the weapon was being dragged through it, it pushed some of the blocks aside and it created something like a row of them which was unnatural in that setting. It was this fact that ultimately disclosed the manner in which this crime was committed to me.”
“Well, the steak and kidney pie flavour was already sold out, I’m afraid.” I replied, giggling at his consternated face.
It slowly dawned on him. The relief washed over him like an outpour of the warm geyser. He felt the big grin growing on his face like the big, sunny dandelion.
”Yeah,” agrees John and secretively hands the purse over to Sherlock there under the table, their hands masked by the long tablecloth.
“You know what, Detective? I forgive you. I am not a vengeful kind of guy, you see? I’ll set you and the police officer free, safe and sound, without as much as lifting a finger on you... but only if you comply with another request from me. The last one, I assure you.”
?" He questioned curiously, narrowing his eyes at the man in the brig when he bristled, taking in a restrained breath. "What, don't like being called a noble? You clearly know who I am. I clearly know
The man shouts, "No!" and scrambles across the floor to hide behind Lestrade's desk chair. "No no no-"
"Ooh, and soopaheroes!" Rosie threw her arms up toward the ceiling as if she was flying away, and John chuckled.
"I'm going to get dressed for bed." John said aloud and walked over to the dresser beside Sherlock's armoire in the corner of the room. He started to pull his jumper over his head, and continued once he was pulling his arms out of the sleeves. "And no, before you start whinging, I've not forgotten about our deal."
"Killed who?" John pried, clearly interested, tucking the folded note into his left breast pocket. Sherlock went to protest, watching his hand, but John interrupted firmly with, "You'll get the note later. Answer my question."
When Rosie looked over and saw John and Sherlock on the couch, she beamed. "Dadda!" John smiled warmly as she ran over, wobbling on uncoordinated feet. He reached out and picked her up when she got near, and she dropped her bear in favor of reaching out to grasp at John's jumper.
John glanced at Sherlock with mild disbelief then followed his eyes to his child, who was bringing over a lion toy, and they both watched her throw the toy onto the couch. It bounced against the two other toys, threatening to fall off, but Sherlock reached out and stopped it from falling. John snorted and shook his head a bit.
negatively, his romantic, Three-Continents-Watson confidence was returning. The teasing smile faded from Sherlock's face, and John witnessed something that he'd never seen Sherlock's body do before. Sherlock's pupils flared.
Sherlock heard John finally and stopped talking, mouth open. He slowly looked at John and found that the doctor was smiling at him, warmth and affection in his eyes. John's hand was firmly wrapped around the curve of Sherlock's shoulder - Sherlock's mind immediately supplied,
There was a short pause of silence before Sherlock cautiously asked, "What did you mean when you said 'again'?"
Sherlock studied the Captain closely. He was being truthful and upfront, and Sherlock appreciated the bluntness of the offer. The offer itself wasn't bad, it was rather brilliant; Sherlock could see why any noblemen caught by Captain Watson's ship would readily agree to his terms. It played on the economics of cost and reward perfectly. A bit too perfectly for the average pirate's intelligence to come up with, even if it was a Captain.
"What you don't remember will be equally as helpful, too." Sherlock added, earning a confused look from Oliver. "What's the last memory you remember before running here?"
Sherlock knew that John preferred to work through the aftermath of his nightmares, but last night had seemed particularly difficult for John to cope with and, admittedly, Sherlock was concerned about John's mental state. He didn't want to press too hard, though - that only caused John to frill like an angry hedgehog. He worried that John was now in a similar state because of what Sherlock proposed to him, and when John glanced over at Sherlock because the detective didn't offer any remarks after John's answer, John could see it in Sherlock's eyes. In reality, sometimes Sherlock was just a tall kid and John was the guardian who Sherlock didn't want to disappoint.
Peter cautiously went over to the door and peeked out, looking for the man, then closed the door and jogged back over to John. He sat down next to John at the table, and John raised an eyebrow and adjusted his gambler.
"That's where we store the medicine." Isabelle answered. "If you've got any questions, I'll be upstairs checking on the patients. They're about to leave lunch right now."
He managed to clip and remove a few more stitches before Sherlock came out of his daze. The blank staring at the ceiling made John wonder if he broke the detective, or if the man had retreated to his Mind Palace to process things (which wouldn't have been the first time), but he figured it was a mixture of both when he felt a hand rest on his bent knee, long fingers grazing over his jeans. John smiled, keeping his eyes and hands focused on his task.
"Our families came here on vacation," Sherlock answered, "back when we used to play pretend that we were pirates." John chuckled at the irony. Sherlock glared for a moment then continued to explain, albeit reluctantly, "He died when we were children. If his father made this, knowing I would follow it, or if it was really his son before he..." Sherlock trailed off and John's face settled into its resting expression.
As Peter brought the chair over and sat down a few feet away from Sherlock, Sherlock started. "You said that you thought the man was asleep. Did you see him?"
Sherlock broke the silence, causing John to flinch slightly as he was shaken from his contemplation. It took him a moment to realize what Sherlock said and process it, but even then John was confused.
"Shock is gone." Sherlock replied. "Pain in tolerable, but moving is going to be difficult." John nodded, already knowing this, and looked around, hoping to see a chair. He saw a white table covered in scratch marks - Christ, they look like fingernail scratches - but not much else.
John nodded slowly, starting to understand. "Was?" He repeated. Sherlock nodded, avoiding John's eyes. "So he's dead." Sherlock gritted his teeth and nodded again. Silence filled the air, and John contemplated what to do next. "Any chance you know the island?"
"If you want me to stop, just say so." John murmured, glancing up Sherlock's body at the man's face. The taller man had his eyes closed and his lips parted, a look that John recognized but had never seen on Sherlock. Sherlock shakily hummed an affirmative, hand still buried in John's hair. "'s alright if trousers come off?"
"Q-Questions?" Peter stuttered nervously, glancing over at Sherlock. Sherlock eyed John before he focused on Peter.
Bringing his daughter and the bag of books over to Sherlock and the couch, John sat down and settled Rosie on his lap. Sherlock rested his cheek against the back of the couch, watching John talk to Rosie as he looked at the different children books that Ms. Hudson bought, until slowly the morphine caused Sherlock to fall asleep.
"Interrogation room seems like our only choice." John answered. "He's a danger to himself and possibly others. No sharp objects, edges, and we can keep an eye on him through the window." Lestrade slowly nodded, watching the blank eyes of Oliver as he stared ahead into nothing.
"A couple of people have been down here since Oliver went missing, but that was after we reported it to Scotland Yard." Isabelle told the duo as she led the way down the stairs. Sherlock followed behind her and bringing up the rear was John, preemptively grimacing at the knowledge of his bad leg having to make the climb back up in a little while. When they reached the bottom landing Isabelle swiped her name tag and a small light next to the console turned green. She opened the door, flicked a light switch on the wall, and gestured for the two men to enter.
"I'm not his keeper, Ms. Hudson," Sherlock gave her a sincere look, a promise in his eyes, "but I will not let him be injured, just as I've always strived to do." She gave Sherlock a look of worry, but wisely chose not to continue the conversation. John turned the corner of the stairwell and met Sherlock's eyes, then Ms. Hudson's.
"It appears you've decided on a course of action." Sherlock mused, causing John to remember what he'd said just before Ms. Hudson and Rosie interrupted them.
"Henrik Felix Trevor." Sherlock answered after a moment. "He was found dead right when that street rat-" Sherlock glared in Peter's direction, "-went running off out of Trevor's bookstore."
Sherlock returns home after visiting the emergency room to get stitched up, and he has a heart-to-heart with John on the couch.
"Are you friends with your patients?" Sherlock interrupted John, who looked at him curiously. Isabelle smiled sheepishly.
Peter glanced around the room desperately and looked relieved when he saw his Captain sitting in the corner, just like he promised. "You go run along and play," he'd told Pete as they walked off the ship, "You'll find me at Finny's Tavern, if ya like." Find him Peter did.
Sherlock was so consumed by thought that he mistook John repeating what he said as John asking if he was okay. "Sorry, I never considered the concept of being asked to partake in a serious monogamous relationship before. You caught me off guard." John suddenly understood the odd look on Sherlock's face moments before and let out a breath of relief.
"Then you found him, right?" John narrowed his eyes at her, tilting his head slightly. "W-We called them about two hours ago because we couldn't find him anywhere!"
, to be honest. Usually I was the last thing that someone needed. The time before the storm, before Moriarty... I figured it out, then, because I'd never been happier and I could see the same in you." Sherlock's eyes widened a bit and he hurriedly added, "That's not to say that I'm not happy now, of course. I love Rosie, I can't wait to teach her all about chemistry, and-"
Within a minute two men carrying duffel bags ran down the stairs near where Sherlock was sat, leaning back to take pressure off the blade in his side, and one stopped next to Sherlock. Lestrade led the second down to the basement.
Like a sickness his nightmare came back to the forefront of his mind and he closed his eyes, leaning back against the couch. Before he could stop himself, before he could calm down and try to forget, the words left his lips.
"It's the educated way to say 'what you do for coin', Pete." John answered before Sherlock could reply with a snide remark. Peter breathed 'oh'.
"Breathe, baby." John purred next to Sherlock's ear, smiling against his neck. "You've got to breathe." The detective took a shaky breath, forcing his lungs to cooperate with him, and the heavy weight on his ribs lessened just a bit. "There you go." John grinned devilishly and reached back with one hand to stroke along the outside of Sherlock's thigh as he licked a stripe along Sherlock's exposed neck. Sherlock felt a shiver run up his nerves from the sensations and moaned breathily.
John watched the man eye his cane thoughtfully, and he stared back at the trapped man, almost daring him to make an attempt to take John's cane. When the man scowled slightly, John smirked and lowered his cane to his side once more.
"So demanding," John teased the detective, pressing a kiss to the same spot he had caressed. Gently, John rubbed the tip of a lubed finger against Sherlock's hole and Sherlock let out a little gasp. The sudden cold against his nerves sent a chill up his spine, and he felt something -
"We'll get you another one," Ms. Hudson reassured, wrapping up the shirt into a tight ball so the dried blood was on the inside and hidden from eyesight.
John laughed softly and Sherlock joined him with a soft chuckle, both smiling and looking at each other. John's smile faded slightly, becoming more serious.
"You could always flirt," Sherlock absently suggested, moving further down the alley. "Although the idea of entering the building while you've been shagging the receptionist-"
"You said the rapist wants it easy," John countered, walking over, "paying to have a secret room built before he's even got the job-"
daughter. Reminding himself of that always seemed to help him get control of himself. He took in a deep breath and stood up, hearing Rosie starting to stir in her crib. She was closing in on two, now, and was saying small sentences, walking and running, and was mostly potty trained, save for the occasional nighttime accident. John didn't feel right trying to think that he helped in any way. He placed the praise on Sherlock and Ms. Hudson, the saintly mother figure to Sherlock and John both.
"Who says it's secret?" Sherlock countered. John raised an eyebrow and Sherlock looked away at something. John followed his eyes and realized what Sherlock was referring to.
"What if I want to be close to you?" John asked, moving a couple centimeters closer. Now that he was sure that Sherlock wouldn't react
Had I been just a second late..." John turned his head, hiding his face from Sherlock. "I did everything I could, and when it mattered the most, it still wasn't enough."
"I'd do it again, too." John glared at him, stood up, and tucked the I.D. into his jeans pocket. With a moment to spare he chose to text Lestrade the code word for whenever Sherlock (or John himself) needed medical services that John couldn't handle purely with first aid.
"Really, Oliver, it's fine." John answered for Sherlock, noticing the 'I'm-not-sure-what-to-do' look in his eyes. "You're likely suffering from post-traumatic amnesia. You're going to not remember a lot of what we ask you, and that's completely normal. Whatever you do remember will be helpful, but don't push it."
Sherlock's eyebrows creased just slightly at the tone of Isabelle's voice. He was never good with identifying emotions, but he could swear that before Isabelle spoke he heard Isabelle giggle and whisper 'aw' under hear breath. Did she find John quite literally stitching Sherlock's skin back together
"It's a start if nothing else." Sherlock replied in a hum, watching as John finished writing down the list of first names and whether they were a patient or a carer. "Doctor Watson, would you like to carry out your medical examination?"
Peter rolled his eyes and stood up, and John grabbed his cane that was leaning against the arm of his chair. With a grunt of effort John stood up and limped with Peter back to the ship. Well, after John checked outside to make sure no Yarders were scouting the place for Peter, of course.
judge." After a moment John realized what he said and swallowed slightly. "I mean, you're a healthy weight, and you don't have any bad scarring, you know?"
"Maybe he left you a parting gift." John supplied, standing up slowly and with a grunt of effort. He gestured to Peter, "Fetch the keys, lad."
"When you turn sixteen, let me know." John dismissed, limping to his desk chair to grab his overshirt and coat. It was windy out and the island would provide little safety from the wind chill. "Now get." Peter huffed and closed the door, and John could hear his heavy footfalls as he walked away.
Seeming a bit more relaxed at this, Peter walked past John and into the room. John closed the door and gestured for Sherlock to take a seat at John's desk chair. Sherlock pulled the chair out and turned it to face the rest of the room, and John sat down on the edge of his bed. He groaned softly.
Sherlock moved over to the door and fished something out of his pocket, kneeling down by the padlock around two thick metal loops: one bolted to the door and one bolted to the concrete wall. He tilted the padlock up so he could see the keyhole and stuck a thin piece of metal inside. Within a minute the lock was picked and the padlock slipped off easily.
The scene played out in Sherlock's mind; he remembered the hot, piercing pain of the bullet, the struggle to fight his way back to life inside his Mind Palace, and waking up groggily on the operating table.
"You bastard," The suspect growled when John patted his scrubs and unclipped his I.D. from his uniform. "You shot me!"
"Dreams aren't something to be afraid of, cuppa." John reassured. "For every bad dream you have, you'll have lots of really good dreams to make you forget them."
"Lockie!" Rosie cheered and ran toward Sherlock sitting in his chair. Sherlock twisted and reached out just in time to catch her as she tripped on her blanket.
"Fucking hell, you're gorgeous." John breathed, slowly and carefully rocking his hips against Sherlock's arse while watching the detective's face. Sherlock slid his hands down to John's back and dug his fingers in, eyes tightly closed.
He thought back to the last time John had confessed something so personal - his emotional affair on Mary and the debilitating guilt that came with it. When he had started to cry then, Sherlock pulled him close and hugged him as he sobbed. He was in no state to attempt to recreate the scene for John now, especially since it would be rather illogical to both stand up just for a hug, so Sherlock contemplated what John would do for him in this situation.
"Pwease?" Rosie whined, and John set her sippy cup down, checking the lid to make sure it was on tight. "Dank you."
"White walls," Oliver starts to mumble aimlessly, "white ceiling, white jacket, white white white-" Oliver grips the arm of Lestrade's chair and rocks gently, causing him to slowly turn in place as his speech becomes incoherent. John frowns and watches him for a couple of minutes and wondering where to go from here. With a soft sigh he stands up with a grunt and quietly leaves the room.
." John spat out the term, glaring daggers at the caged detective. "His name is Peter. Use it next time."
"Just because you're doped up doesn't mean you're invincible, Holmes." John chided him as they ascended the stairs. Sherlock wasn't exactly sure when they had started the climb, but judging by their speed and John's nagging it had likely been no more than a minute ago. Their coats were gone as well. How had he not noticed John taking his coat off? Morphine was certainly an annoying, but effective, opiate.
John sighed heavily, breaking Sherlock's concentration, "Thank god - You're going to be okay." John lowered the edge of Sherlock's coat and pressed his hand around the blade where Sherlock's hand had been. "It didn't hit anything important. You're going to be just fine."
"Yes," Sherlock whimpered, watching John's face as he approached his own climax. John's eyes were squeezed closed, his mouth hung open, and it was the most beautiful image Sherlock had ever seen. Sherlock tossed the pillow to the side and whispered, "Kiss me."
"I know, but you've got to focus on mine. I'm going to help you, but you've got to help me, too." John swallows, teeth clenching as he chooses his question and its wording carefully. "Do you remember where you live? Is there anyone we can call for you?"
"When do you have your support group?" Sherlock asked next, and Oliver blinked and looked up at Sherlock.
John thought, but he kept his thoughts to himself. This wasn't the place or the time to share them, and John was already tired of sharing.
Rosie thought for a couple seconds then chose to point at the stitches, instead of reaching again. "Booboo?"
"That's Lestrade." He grinned and looked down at Rosamund, who was now trying to climb off his lap. He helped her down and picked up her blanket as she walked across the flat to her toys on the floor. John had the phone pressed to his ear, greeting the caller with his name.
"I was lookin' at things in a bookstore in Central London," Peter grinned, "and I found this." He dug his fingers underneath his tattered leather coat and fished out a folded piece of parchment.
John offered Sherlock a small, appreciative smile, and Sherlock nodded slightly back at him, reassured that he had done something John deemed 'good'.
"John, you're asking me to understand the incompetence of others," Sherlock reminded John, watching Rosie point to the colored bottles she wanted to mix together. "If you cannot understand it, how do you expect me to?"
John finished the last letter and nodded, clicking his pen and folding his paper pad before tucking them back into his pocket. Sherlock walked toward the door and John looked up, saying abruptly, "Oh, Sherlock?"
"So long as I'm granted the same luxury with you," Sherlock watched John's hand check the tape on the bandage before he brushed his fingers over Sherlock's ribs. The ticklish feeling lasted but a moment because John's palm pressed against the same spot. John could feel Sherlock's thudding heartbeat through his rib cage.
"Consulting Detective, thank you." Sherlock replied with bitter venom. John just smiled and waited. When John didn't get a reply, he looked up and found Sherlock staring at him like he had just realized something groundbreaking. "You've got no idea, do you?" He said plainly, and John raised an eyebrow. "Or are you covering for whoever killed him?"
"I'll go start dinner," Ms. Hudson announced, patting Sherlock's shoulder softly before holding a hand out to take Sherlock's ruined shirt. "Want a cup of tea?"
John remembered waking Rosie up with his night terror and his frown deepened. "Oh, sweetheart, you don't need to worry about that. Daddy has special dreams, dreams that you don't need to worry about having." Rosie tucked her teary face into John's neck, sniffling. "And if you do have a scary dream, just call for me and I'll be right here."
John planted his free hand next to Sherlock's head and leaned down, pressing his lips firmly against Sherlock's to shut him up. The kiss was rough and unlike any of their kisses prior; it held a heat and passion to it that John had been keeping under wraps since the start of their newly-founded relationship. He had been worried to go further than kissing and touching with Sherlock because the detective was inexperienced, which could cause Sherlock to panic if John didn't give him time to adapt. However, it meant that beneath his calm exterior lurked a pool of repressed sexual tension. While expressing this tension could lead to a panicked Sherlock, if it meant that he'd shut up for a few moments and stay still, John was willing to take the risk.
, Cap'n?" A look of horror passed over his face when John tilted his head slightly and gave him a daring look. "I-I mean- I didn't mean it like-"
The silver, almost icy blue, pair of eyes was the man in question. He was tall and lanky, but John could tell just by the way the man held himself that he was by no means weak. He stood straight, confident and with perfect posture - he was definitely a child of nobility, and still prided himself on that, judging by his expensive clothes. Dark brown, curly hair was cut short and looked black in the dim light of the oil lantern that Peter must have brought down with him.
John stepped toward Sherlock, swallowing down nervousness. "A sociopath wouldn't have faked his death to keep his friends alive."
The message directed the reader to a particular latitude and longitude, which meant the hardest part was over with. John found the correct place on the globe, noticing that it was an island about half the size of London. It's shape didn't have many unique features, which proved annoying but not impossible. After studying the shape, the island's location compared to the nearest landmasses, and comparing it all to his map table for a long while, John made an educated guess and circled it with a piece of charcoal.
"I wasn't aware you were a psychologist." Sherlock teased lightly, trying to distract himself from how close John was. He could feel whispers of John's breath on his chest. At his teasing, John seemed to ease somewhat, and his hand on Sherlock's relaxed.
Sherlock smiled softly, watching them disappear into the kitchen, and continued to explain what the doctors had said about his injury to Ms. Hudson. The wound was neat and would heal within a month, so long as he kept it clean and didn't pop any stitches. The morphine tablets he was prescribed would last a week, but he doubted that he would need to take them all.
The doctor worked the button of Sherlock's trousers free then pulled the zipper down. He sat upright and tucked his fingers underneath the waistband of Sherlock's trousers, tugging them down. Sherlock lifted his hips to help, then lowered them once John had the clothing around Sherlock's thighs and helped his partner shimmy them down. John gripped the trouser legs and pulled, dropping them on the floor beside the bed once they were free.
"I could tell there was something you wanted to say," Sherlock said in a soft breath, still a bit in shock at John's confession, "but I didn't realize-"
Sherlock immediately relaxed beneath John, his jaw going slack just enough for John to shove his tongue in Sherlock's mouth. The taller man hummed a pleasant noise and reached up with both hands to cup John's face, returning the favor after the few seconds of surprise faded away. John started to pull back after a long moment but Sherlock tried to follow his lips with his own, refusing to part until John pushed on Sherlock's bare shoulder and put Sherlock flat on his back again.
"I can write a list of names, if you want." Isabelle glanced between John and the unfamiliar figure next to him, wondering why the man was looking her over with darting eyes.
Sherlock hummed thoughtfully, the interaction giving plenty of information both on the case and on Watson's psychological profile. "That's it for now. You can leave."
"Where am I?" The man said in a shaking tone of voice, sitting up and pressing his back against the wall, using his arms to brace himself. "Who are you?"
He rushed over and John lifted his good leg instinctively, letting the young kid dive underneath the table. He rested the heel of his leather boot on the wood floor and, with his good arm, draped the navy blue cloak that covered his bad left shoulder over his right leg, working as a makeshift curtain for the boy and a "blanket" for John. John tilted down the front of his black gambler hat to shield his face and leaned his head back against the wall, pretending to be asleep.
"This is where we keep the patients' belongings that can't stay with them in their room." She gestured to the shelves sticking out from the wall beside the door. "Mostly sharp things, metal, anything they could use to harm themselves or others."
"Right, boy," John prompted, pushing his cape off his good leg. John lifted his leg and the boy crawled out from under it. "Mind explaining what that was all about?"
"Gorgeous..." John exhaled, smiling as he rubbed a hand over Sherlock's arse. His skin was so smooth and soft.
John tells the crew about the arranged deal, Peter tells Sherlock about the scene of the crime, and Sherlock tells John about how obviously military John is.
"I know what you mean." John's pulse jumped, hearing Sherlock shift slightly next to him. He was looking at John, wasn't he? "My nightmare last night... You were in it, too."
"What's scary, love?" John carried his daughter over to his end table and pulled a tissue out of a tissue box, wiping her nose and eyes.
"Thank you, Rosamund." Sherlock smiled down at her, but she was already stumbling off back to the kitchen.
He was surprised to see that Sherlock had moved from his spot on the couch, and was now standing in the kitchen by the dining table. Sherlock turned, hearing John's footsteps. The look that greeted Sherlock made him strangely... happy. John looked concerned, and perhaps he was also a bit mad, but mostly he had a caring look about him.
"But why?" Sherlock hummed, finishing John's thought. John sighed. "Come along, John. We've got somewhere to be."
"Sherlock Holmes." There was a pause. "He's a consulting detective." Another pause. "He solves the crimes that the police can't. I'm his doctor."
"I don't know, love," John teased with a grin, "I think you sound too tough for any bad dreams to get you." Rosie's eyes softened and she smiled.
"There's no shattered window?" John tried. Sherlock grinned at him, something genuine and powerful that made John feel proud of himself.
He stormed off with a huff, and after a moment or so John dared to peek out from under the bill of his black soft gambler. The man was gone.
Sherlock gasped; the pain was gone for the most part, but an uncomfortable feeling was left in its wake. He wondered why this was supposed to be pleasurable, but he trusted John. John knew what he was doing, even if he wasn't as confident in himself as Sherlock was in him. Suddenly, Sherlock felt John's length brush up against something deep inside him and his body convulsed, shaking with the pleasure. John smiled knowingly and pulled back a bit before rocking forward, causing Sherlock to whine softly through parted lips. Now it became very apparent to Sherlock why he wanted this in the first place.
"Oliver?" John attempts to get his attention, leaning forward slightly with his hands in his lap. "Focus on me, okay? Focus on my voice."
Sherlock and John leave New Scotland Yard and head out to follow Oliver's path back to where he escaped from.
Silence hung in the air for a moment as Sherlock processed all the new stimuli he was receiving. John's touch was just as he catalogued it before, but this time it was gentler, giving Sherlock the ability to pull away.
Sherlock let out a yelp when John wrapped his hands under Sherlock's knees, lifted, and shoved, all in one movement, causing Sherlock to fall back onto the mattress and slide toward the center of it. John then twisted and straddled Sherlock's thighs, putting his weight on them, and Sherlock stared up at him wide eyed.
"The rat." The man slowly rises until he can slither into Lestrade's seat, looking at John from over the back of it with his knees planted into the cushioned seat. John cocks his head with interest.
John stared blankly into Sherlock's eyes, conflicting emotions threatening to swallow him whole. His ribs ached with the pressure of them, as if they were expanding outward from his core and filling his chest cavity.
"Sherlock," John started, and the man hummed absently, "As much as I'd love to sit here waiting for you to solve a case several hundred kilometers away-"
"Well, there was Lane and Audrey, of course. Plus Isabelle, Doctor Stone's assistant. Lizzy, the anorexic girl." Oliver leaned back in his plastic chair and stared up at the ceiling. He mumbled through the list of names again and licked his lips in concentration. "Um... I think that's it? There might have been an orderly there, but I'm not sure."
"If you can find any, or if you can find someone who knows where they are, can you get a pillow and a couple blankets for Oliver?" John opened his mouth to continue explaining, but Sherlock cut him off.
"As it seems that your Captain already knows," Sherlock started, "I'm a consulting detective. I solve cases that Scotland Yard cannot-"
John paused. "Touche, I suppose." John leaned down slightly and started to unbutton Sherlock's poor white button up from the top button at his sternum. Sherlock stilled, unsure of how to act in such a situation. His cheeks heated up in mild embarrassment. Why was he having this reaction now when numerable nurses and doctors had unbuttoned his shirt before?
"We?" John repeated. The woman gestured to the door John had been looking at moments before and started to stand.
Sherlock pierced me with a look as sharp as a knife, the paleness of his irises hardening into steel: “Spilling of blood in such a manner would do away with his purity at once and would condemn him to the hardest of damnations. Spiritually, he would never recover from such an incident. Therefore, he would rather be killed himself than to slay somebody else. And so this man, Authié, being Perfect, couldn't murder the victim. He just couldn't!”
I was rendered speechless by that announcement. I caught myself facing Sherlock again, unbelieving and bug-eyed, but now it was him staring out of the window. He observed the lights of the town and continued in a wistful, dreamy tone: “Cathars are the folk which, according to their beliefs, carries within itself the shard of the Divine Light. They are the folk which perceives the human body as a garment of flesh only. The Angelic Soul of an individual is trapped within this garment, forgetting its origin in God and it must incarnate into this world time and time again until it is able to return to that original state. Most individuals therefore go through this long circle of reincarnations.”
"Fu..." John choked out, burying himself into Sherlock's body and clutching onto Sherlock's hip. After a couple seconds his lungs began to work again and he huffed out a heavy pant. Sherlock peppered kisses all over John's face.
"When I lay down, I try to think about things that make me happy." He told her. "I think about things I like or something I look forward to, like what I'm going to write next or the fun I had working with Lockie."
"Earlier I told you my name. Do you remember it?" John watched the man's face closely, looking for some uncertainty or a forgetfulness that might give himself and the two men watching outside some narrowing information.
"I'll call our forensic psychologist and get him to take a look and give a diagnosis as soon as he's in." Greg reassured then frowned, realizing an issue with his plan. "Although it seems like 'Oliver' doesn't seem fond of doctors."
"Focus on that and shut it." John told him sternly, looking into Sherlock's dazed eyes. He shifted and went back to work, pleased to find that Sherlock remained still. He was breathing a bit heavily, but John would rather have a breathless Sherlock than a restless Sherlock.
"I'm clean." Sherlock cut him off, anticipating the question before it was asked. John was a doctor, after all. "Both sexually and literally." He had to hold back a laugh at the odd look that John gave him.
But, as he was putting her in the crib, Rosie started to cry. John frowned and picked her back up; she clung to him like she wouldn't see him again, and it left John more confused than any other emotion. She hadn't thrown a fit at bedtime for weeks.
"You can try and vouch for her aim all you want," John said defensively, "but... you flat-lined, Sherlock.
"Do you remember everyone who was in your group with you?" Sherlock pried, glancing at John. John nodded and pulled out a pad and a pen from his breast pocket of his coat.
"Christ," He muttered, grinning like an idiot. "I didn't realize how badly I've wanted that until today."
"There's no need to be bashful, mate." John continued undoing the last few buttons. "You're in good company. No one is going to judge. Not that there's anything
"Smart man." John praised. He limped over to a wooden stool placed against the wall of the ship's hull and he dragged it closer, back to where he had been standing before.
"God, stop talking." John shuddered and walked off, flustered and disgusted by the mental image in his mind. He missed the mischievous smirk on Sherlock's face, whom was pleased that he got his doctor to finally leave him unattended to search for evidence. Admittedly, Sherlock had to suppress his own disgust at the concept as well.
Sherlock had an odd look settle over his face, and John decided to ignore it. He didn't have time for a bitter back-and-forth to last much longer. Sherlock was mildly surprised that Captain Watson was so protective of the orphaned child.
Sherlock stopped, mouth open and eyes trained on his hand on John's shoulder. His thumb was still smoothing over the soft fabric, but stilled after a second. The touch had turned from friendly to intimate the longer Sherlock's hand remained on John's shoulder, practically caressing the fabric there with his thumb, and John hadn't held it against Sherlock until he saw nervous panic consume Sherlock's facial expression. It became very clear to John that Sherlock was aware of the broken social norm but hadn't realized it until it was too late. His pulse was racing and so was John's. One glimpse into John's eyes told Sherlock that John had figured him out, but Sherlock couldn't tell if the stoic soldier was angry or not.
John's lips tightened into a line. "Yes and no." Isabelle's face sunk somewhat. "He's alive, but..." John paused, took a breath, then explained what had happened when Oliver showed up at Scotland Yard. Isabelle put a hand over her mouth and listened to every word intently. John could tell when he told Isabelle about Oliver's description of how he got to the Yard and John's medical findings that Isabelle was trying not to let a few tears fall.
"He always wants to talk." The man grasps Lestrade's rolling chair at the base and snarls, "Talk talk talk."
"Do you remember if you've slept at all since the meeting?" John asked, a tinge of worry to his voice. Oliver stared blankly at the plain table in front of him for a long moment, then slowly shook his head.
Grinning sinfully, John thrusted into Sherlock harder, slowing his pace down just slightly, and he growled into Sherlock's ear, "I can't wait for the day that no one is home but us. You're gonna be hoarse by the time we're done."
"There was..." Oliver licked his dry lips. "There was a house..? No, wait, it was a halfway house. I've been living there for..." Oliver paused then looked up at John, confessing with mild horror, "Christ, I have no idea what day it is."
"I care about you, John. No one expects you to be the shining example of a father after what you've gone through just to get here. You shouldn't expect it of yourself, either. At least not to the point of degrading your mental health."
"Christ, Sherlock - Knock next time?" John breathed with exasperation, rubbing his eyes with one hand while the other found his waist. Sherlock opened his mouth, paused, then spoke:
"Likewise." Sherlock hummed, blushing a bright pink from his neck to his cheeks. "I was fine with just being physically closer than we had been previously, had it been what you wanted, but I don't think that is an option, now." John chuckled, moving his hand from Sherlock's neck to Sherlock's ribs, both hands now resting on Sherlock's sides.
"Yeah, he came in wielding it." Lestrade rubbed his stubble with one hand, the other on his hip. "Dropped it when his episode passed. It's down in forensics now."
"Coming home." Sherlock answered. "After all that misery for two years, I was ready to come home here, to you, and lounge on this sofa in peaceful silence."
As Ms. Hudson rounded the corner of the kitchen to discard of the shirt and start dinner, John walked into the sitting room and over to Sherlock. Rosie was trailing behind him, carrying a stuffed bunny. As John set down his medical supplies on the couch, Rosie walked over and threw the bunny onto the cushion beside Sherlock. Sherlock watched her grab the bear she discarded on the floor earlier and repeated the same action with it, the bear landing next to the bunny.
incorrectly?" John wondered aloud, remembering the twenty or so reporters standing outside the crime scene tape yesterday. The poor woman's death was deemed a suicide by the media before Sherlock and John had even arrived, and despite John tackling her murderer to the cobblestone street about six hours later, they were still pushing this narrative.
"What's wrong, cuppa?" John soothed, holding her against him and rocking slightly, shifting his balance in a gently sway. "It's just your crib, darling. See?" He patted the railing lightly.
"I'm sure, cuppa." John kissed her forehead. "How about in the morning you tell me what you dreamed about, and we'll see if our little trick helped."
The kiss was sweet and spiked with lust, making for a dangerously addictive combination. As the smile faded from John's preoccupied lips, his hands found Sherlock's thighs and pushed on the back of them, pining them at the detective's chest. John let go of one to grab a pillow and force it underneath Sherlock's hips, pulling away to see what he was doing. The detective watched with hungry eyes, lifting his hips for the doctor. John patted Sherlock's thigh once he was done adjusting the pillow and Sherlock lowered his hips, rocking them to flatten out the pillow a bit. John grabbed the lubricant and poured some onto his palm, coating himself generously and setting the lube off to one side.
"'Ello there my little cuppa," John cooed. Rosie beamed as John walked over - ever since John first called her his "cuppa", she loved it. He didn't know why she did, perhaps it was just the way he said it, but it seemed to calm and soothe her whenever he did. "How did you sleep?"
"It's alright." John said softly in reply. "I'd rather stay here and help. From what Oliver said, I think there's more people that need our help."
