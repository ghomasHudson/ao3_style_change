, I felt worse than ever. Worse than the agony of concealing my emotions, worse than hating myself for having such emotions in the first place, worse because I knew I had
“I believe you heard,” He said in a cruel, bitter tone. “I would rather you didn’t dither and make this more complicated than it ought–”
It had been abominably selfish, to indulge in his calming, gentle friendship for so long. Given, it was nothing but pure, but my heart had morphed it into something immoral, desire and pining ruining it from within. These emotions confounded me. How could I feel such all consuming passion, whilst simultaneously feeling such tender, gentle… love? It made no logical sense, the two should not be able to coexist. What I felt was not just desire, not just deep yearning for him, body and soul, but also, pure and achingly sweet. They were two sides of the same coin. Was this what love was? An exquisite torture? A beautiful agony? Plunging a dagger into one's heart everyday with willingness and vigour? Was this not a complete contradiction of all logic? When I feel such dark desires creep into my mind, I am disgusted with myself. Yet they are evoked by him, by my love for him, and he could never be disgusting. The tender, selfless love I felt for him, could never be anything but pure. I was awash with confusion. He made me feel so much all at once, I could hardly begin to understand it. I am a lover of logic, of reason, and these emotions were so far from where I felt most comfortable. Being with him I felt at sea.
” I ceased pacing and stumbled back into my chair placing my hands over my face, digging in my nails.
Stamford was silent. I didn’t look up, I didn’t want him to see that my speech had left me breathless and tearful. Distantly, I felt a hand on my shoulder squeeze tightly, and then his warm, soothing baritone spoke once more.
He was all that was good in my life, and his presence brought out the best in my abilities. When I was with him, I deduced faster, more efficiently, more effectively, like a well-oiled machine. I was constantly hungry for his approval, his praise, so much so that I was theatrical and dramatic in my deductions, but without ever straying from the core logistical foundations of each one. I performed for him each and every day like a showman would to an auditorium, he was my harbinger of joy, my conductor of light. Without him, I feared that I would rust—fade away.
There was a faraway look in Sherlock’s eyes until they settled on John. If Sherlock had looked lost before, the emotion in his eyes now could only be characterized by relief.
“You don’t need to thank me,” he replies, embarrassed, trying to ignore the tiny wriggle of guilt over the fact that he hasn’t been entirely truthful. John’s messmates will likely ask Molly a heap of questions, including how on earth it is that Sherlock knows a midshipman from another British ship.
As soon as he’s mostly dry, he drapes the towel over the back of the chair for John to use when he’s done, and then crawls up onto the enormous bed.
“I didn’t even get my trousers off, Sherlock. You made me come in my trousers and you weren’t even there.”
He lets go of John’s hand to straighten his waistcoat, looking at John as he does so, watching John smooth that errant lock of hair back into place with his hands, feeling something in his stomach turn over at how unbelievably handsome John is in this moment—the light coming in from the porthole illuminating his broad cheeks, the strong curve of his jaw, the soft line of his mouth.
It takes him a moment to find his way under the beams to the area at the front of the ship where the crew sleeps, but it is easy to locate once he does, the forest of hammocks swinging with the slight sway of the ship is impossible to miss.
Sherlock reaches behind him to pull John’s hands from his back so he can hold them between his own. He needs to show John his gratitude since he knows his words will fail him.
? He won’t leave the flat for any conceivable reason, not now that he’s convinced I’m coming back. We’ve got to convince him, Molly,
However, to Sherlock’s great relief, Lieutenant Lestrade is on duty, standing at the shoulder of the helmsman, looking slightly paler than usual but otherwise no worse for the wear.
He crosses the room back to John’s side, and then taking John’s hand in his he presses the little vial into John’s fingers.
“Good. Really, really—” Sherlock stroked the two fingers inside him and John felt the movement brush his prostate. His hips jerked in response, his mouth falling open. “
Sherlock readjusts himself in John’s lap, settling his long legs so that they curl around behind John’s waist.
He feels a rush of something like shame at the realization that John is the only thing keeping him upright at the moment.
Not bothering to speak, or to even look to make sure the coast is clear, just blindly reaching, seizing hold of John’s arms and pulling, until John is safely over the threshold of the door, warm and firm in the circle of Sherlock’s arms—a living, breathing body—alive and whole and
“You know perfectly well what I’m doing!” Ferguson shouts. His voice has an edge of hysteria. “This boy stole something from me this morning, and now I’m simply taking back what’s mine. I’ll search his room next if I have to—I know he has it!”
Then, just as John reasoned that Sherlock may very well already be asleep, the Sherlock-shaped lump under the duvet rolled over and curled up against John, sliding one leg in between John’s, pressing his chest into John’s side.
He sits up, disoriented, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, his mind full of blue light, body tingling from the feelings in the dream. He briefly considers trying to go back to sleep.
“As I said—no interest. However, you are, as it turns out, quite correct in your assessment that Phillip Anderson is the most incompetent midshipman to ever set foot on board a ship. He’s a disgrace to the uniform he wears, and indeed, it is my belief that our progress on this voyage would be much improved by Mr. Anderson’s prompt removal from this vessel.”
“It’s good to see you again,” Aidan says to Sherlock with a grin, and at the sight of the other man’s smile, genuine and full of joy, Sherlock feels something inside of his chest become suddenly weightless.
Dropping the pen and paper in his hand, Ferguson lunges for Sherlock, grabbing him by the collar of his coat and shoving him up against the railing.
He finds himself thinking longingly back to the bucket of hot water John brought him after his illness—god, what a luxurious experience that had been.
He’s stricken once again by how much more awareness he has of his body since John came into his life—how much more appreciation he has for all its faculties, sexual and otherwise. There is so much that John has showed him, and some part of Sherlock knows in an intuitive way that this is only the beginning.
He pushes the thought down even as he feels it bringing color to his cheeks. After all, he does not know what John is planning, best not to fixate on any one activity in particular.
Sherlock has never felt anything like it—he wants John to do it again, but he can’t find the breath to speak.
Sherlock hurries forward, dropping to his knees to pull open the top of a worn canvas sack, stitched with the initials J.W.
“This… gentleman...”  Sherlock can hear the pointed question in her voice as she says the word. Her eyes move over the arch of Sherlock’s forehead to his hair. He is glad he spent the extra moments it took to wet it and comb it this morning. “He would like to play whist with us, would he?”
,” he said, pointing to the white, star-shaped flowers as his mouth traced the shell of John’s ear. “Responsible for the perfume in the air. And that,” he said, moving his body behind John’s to kiss the nape of his neck, “
Still Sherlock does not move, ignoring the steady drip of rank water down the back of his neck, uncomfortably aware of the fact that one of the rats is currently making its way over the top of his boot.
But no—it’s more wondrous than that, because for all the hardness, for all the unbending strength of John, there is softness there too, not just in the silky quality of his skin over his hips, at the base of his spine, his neck; the pale hair under his arms—there is softness even in the hardest places on his body, when he lowers himself to Sherlock, when he leans in, offering himself—both qualities are there in equal measure. What’s most astonishing of all is when John
John is so close now his lips are skimming Sherlock’s ear, his nose grazing Sherlock’s cheek, and Sherlock realizes with a sharp kick of desire in his belly that John is inhaling as he goes, that John is
John shifts so that his arms are once again around Sherlock’s waist, in an effort to pull Sherlock closer against him, and he succeeds, in spite of the fact that he cannot use his hands, his palms turned awkwardly to prevent them from touching Sherlock’s back.
Sherlock feels a thrill just watching him—the joy he takes in his own body is as bright, as evident as the sunlight on his hair, as the strong lines of his muscles standing out in his arms.
Sherlock’s worried face appeared in the circle of glass between them, but the door was growing hotter by the second, the metal on the handle singeing John’s palms. He watched Sherlock throw his shoulder against the door, again and again, in an attempt to break it open. It was as if John was transfixed where he stood. He couldn’t let go of the door handle, even when he felt the skin on his hands begin to burn.
John reached down and gripped Sherlock by the flanks, pulling him against him. Sherlock gave a low groan, and then began to thrust.
“Oh really?” John replied, still trying to catch his breath. The feeling of Sherlock’s warm, living body between his legs was making it difficult to concentrate on anything Sherlock was saying.
Sherlock didn’t move his forehead from where it was pressed against John’s. John could hear his breathing quickening. “Are we?”
There isn’t much to put away so it doesn’t take him very long—the most time-consuming task is picking up the shards of glass scattered over the floor.
The pleasure building in the center of him as a result was like a light inside himself—John could feel it growing brighter with every flex of Sherlock’s hand, until he was making little keening cries, his spread thighs quivering under Sherlock’s hand.
“Some of us had work that needed finishing down below. It’s not all of us that can go skipping merrily off at the first cry of shore leave.”
“No,” Stamford shakes his head. “No, believe it or not he told me that the first merchant ship he’d signed onto was captured by the French, not two months into his first voyage.”
Emboldened, Sherlock slides his hands up John’s hips, up over his lean muscular sides, fingers rippling over John’s ribs, feeling every muscle, every bone, and he marvels not only at the sight of his pale fingers against John’s darker skin, but also at the feel of John’s warm, living body shifting and breathing underneath his palms.
On the opposite side of the deck, the elderly Mr. and Mrs. Whitehall are taking the air, but they are a fair distance off and unlikely to come where Sherlock and Miss Hooper are standing, partially concealed by the shadow of the mizzenmast.
Sherlock watches the line of John’s mouth shrink again, and feels a prickling wave of dread move through him. He hates it—he hates seeing John look like his heart has been torn out of his chest and then flayed open. It’s all wrong. John should be happy; John should be overjoyed, but instead…
Miss Hooper’s face is grim, but she continues to twirl her parasol slowly at her shoulder, so as to give the impression that she and Sherlock are speaking of trivial matters.
“Thank god you’re here, lad.” Matthews says in a low voice, glancing warily at John. “We’ve been trying to get him to calm down but so far nothing has worked. He’s really worked up this time.”
Based on the rate at which Sherlock was devouring his mouth, Sherlock was just as badly off. He only pulled his mouth away so that he could press a kiss to John’s jaw, then to the skin below his ear. The unsteady staccato of Sherlock’s breath was hot against the side of his neck where he pressed another kiss.
Sherlock opens his mouth to protest but Lestrade goes on speaking before he has a chance to respond.
John is there to catch him though, his hand fastening around Sherlock’s upper arm. “Woah, woah. Easy there.”
John let his head fall back against the carriage wall with a hollow thud of surrender. “Lord have mercy on our souls.”
“Several times over in point of fact!” Sherlock had insisted, in a carrying tone, as paramedics had ushered the distraught passengers out of the line of Sherlock’s wrathful stare.
Sherlock can taste the fury in his kiss, the desperation; he opens his mouth against John’s, offering his tongue, his fingers cupping John’s jawline as he does, as if to say, ‘Here, I am. Take me. Take this as my offering of comfort.’
Sherlock opens his eyes to do as John asks, raising himself off the pillows to give John the room he needs to free him from the garment.
John’s sigh in response sounds almost like an emission of pain but Sherlock knows better, he knows from the way John’s head tips back at the gesture how welcome he finds it, his eyes closing in relief.
The alcohol is strong and Sherlock can feel it almost immediately going to his head, but so what if he gets a little drunk?
“But I remember kissing you.” Sherlock’s eyes returned to John’s and it was like being struck in the chest, there was such intensity in Sherlock’s gaze. “I remember pulling you down against me. I remember you stopped resisting then, and I thought, ‘He wants it, he wants this,’ and the way your mouth felt, the way you fit against me—it confirmed everything I felt. There was only one thought in my mind—my noisy, chaotic, over-stimulated mind—and it was as clear as a bell: this is the way things are meant to be.”
John runs his hands back up over Sherlock’s knees, up this thighs, up, up, until his palms are framing the bulge in Sherlock’s breeches, and he leans in close, his breath hot against Sherlock’s inner thighs, even through the fabric. Sherlock can feel it and he has to close his eyes for fear he will ruin himself before John has even started.
She leans forward in her chair, her face intent. “It’s only rational for you to expect Sherlock to be alive. You had unfinished business with him. Your psyche is conjuring him up because it wants to make it right, to give you the opportunity to say the things you didn’t get to say.”
Sherlock can tell John is trying to be nice but that only makes it worse. John doesn’t understand that people don’t
He’s happy to rejoin the rowdy group of sailors, who have struck up a drinking song that Colonel Jackson is loudly trying to join in (even though he clearly does not know the words), but is distressed to realize that he has lost sight of John in the chaos of the laughing, shouting crowd.
Reaching a hand up to the back of Sherlock’s neck, he dragged Sherlock’s mouth down against his and kissed him with an ache in his chest that was only made better when Sherlock’s lips parted and his tongue came out to meet John’s, warm and slick and deliciously wet.
John took a deep breath and squared his shoulders. Of course, Sherlock was right. They still needed to get what they came for, and even if they wanted to get off, the ship was moving now, so they had little choice in the matter.
Then, through the undercurrent of other voices he hears John’s laugh; that beautiful, full-bellied laugh that Sherlock has heard once before. The sound of it makes Sherlock’s heart beat faster; it is utterly lovely.
Once again, Sherlock was struck with a memory from earlier, from the second time he thought he’d lost John, when after fifteen minutes of frantic searching he had discovered him up on the roof of Baker Street, wearing Sherlock’s checkered dressing gown and a mismatched pair of socks, standing very still with his eyes closed, face turned toward the sky.
He used to nick things from the other students in University when they made him angry. Just small things: papers, keepsakes. In fact, he’d gotten quite good at it in the brief time that he was there. Not once did anyone ever suspect him. He’d always given the items back eventually, secretly returning them to the precise location where he’d found them. It was somehow more satisfying for the lost item to reappear, weeks later, in the place where it should have been all along, the result of which was to make the offending person suspect that they were going mad.
All this time they have been in one another’s company, it’s been like a spell, a dream, some completely different reality—the spark between them—the light—like nothing Sherlock has ever experienced, but he knows things are different at sea. The same rules don’t apply, and he cannot take the risk of
Astute readers may remember a reference in a previous chapter to the fact that Sherlock does not know how to swim. *embarrassed author’s cough* Well, such are the problems created by the work-in-progress. In earlier versions of this story, I imagined that Sherlock had never learned to swim, and when they finally reached the beach in Rio, John would teach him. But somehow that version of events became less exciting/interesting to me than this version, in which Sherlock actually feels very much at home in the water. I'm happy to ramble on more about my reasoning behind this decision- if you're interested in knowing more, feel free to send me a message about it on tumblr, or in the comments.
Sherlock dragged the sponge over the writing on the other side of John's chest and repeated the process, bending his dark head to John’s torso, his mouth chaste at first and then hot and intent, sucking at the skin as though he meant to draw the ink out of John’s body.
But then all words left him, and he was coming, harder than he ever had, his body shuddering in Sherlock’s arms, shaking in the water between them, Sherlock pulling him close, drawing John tighter to him with his legs around his back.
Sherlock didn’t want to leave the place, but Mycroft dragged him home again, too exhausted and numb with grief to put up much of a fight, and helped him up the stairs and into bed.
“Well, I suggest you secure a place for yourself on this boat if you want to get to shore this morning. There won’t be another until the starboard watch gets their leave this evening.”
“They said when the ship reaches port, they’ll bring… women on board for the men.” Sherlock feels bile rising in the back of his throat but he forces himself to keep speaking. He has to know; much better to know now, than be surprised when the time comes. “Will they? And… will you…?”
A man walking past clips John on the shoulder with his umbrella. “Sorry, chap.” As he turns away to continue walking John catches a glimpse of his face—pale skin, sharp cheekbones, high forehead.
They maneuvered Sherlock onto a gurney and John immediately fell into conference with the paramedics. “Laceration on inner thigh. Possible puncture wound. Hasn’t stopped bleeding since impact. Pulse is weak and erratic. Definite hypovolemic shock. He’s past stage two, well on his way to stage three.”
“No, no, it’s best if I return on my own anyway. That way I won’t have to deal with any unnecessary questions.”
Sherlock parted his lips and then—John couldn’t help it, he looked away from Sherlock’s eyes to take in the sight of his gorgeous mouth opening around the head of John’s cock and sliding down.
The fingers of his other hand card gently through the curls at the back of Sherlock’s neck, and Sherlock cries out at the delicate touch, thrusting with abandon against John’s thigh, desperate for friction, for some relief against the aching pressure in his cock.
They lay like that in John's cold room, wrapped around each other, until John's limbs grew stiff and he realized that he was starting to tremble not from exhaustion but from the cold air still seeping in through his shattered window.
The murmur of John’s voice above him makes Sherlock’s pleasure swell within him, and he knows he is close now.
“Maybe,” John says, and there’s something dreamy in his voice, something daring. “When we get to Rio—”
“Stevens, was it?” Anderson’s dark eyes flicker from the broad shouldered man whose arms are crossed in front of his chest to John, standing opposite, to Sherlock still crouching by the bulwark. His gaze travels pointedly over Sherlock’s paint-spattered waistcoat and forearms, and then to John’s rigid stance. “It looks to me like the trouble is stemming from the fact that Mr. Holmes here seems to be fraternizing with the crew.”
The hammering on the door intensified until it sounded as though Sherlock was throwing the whole of his weight against it.
All the breath leaves Sherlock’s lungs at the contact of that warm, soft skin against his palms, at the flex in John’s torso as he shifts forward, mouth sliding into Sherlock’s curls and breathing deeply. There is something possessive in the gesture, something fierce and desperate, as though John needs to claim Sherlock for his own.
John tipped his head forward, placing his forehead against the long line of Sherlock’s neck. He felt sleepy, his movements slowed by the drowsy contentment stealing over his exhausted body. All of his concerns seemed to have receded into the distance, over the edge of the horizon, beyond his view. It was a delicious feeling. If he shut his eyes right now, John felt as though he could sleep for a hundred years.
Clearly audible through the floorboards are the raucous sounds of the men above them, the light filtering down through the cracks blinking in and out as they move about overhead.
“Only when I tell you,” John says, his voice a tendril of heat uncurling between them as his hand begins to speed up again. “You beautiful, beautiful thing.”
Sherlock’s long fingers skimmed up John’s sides, sliding over his chest to his nipples. He dragged the tips of his fingers over the sensitive skin and John gasped again as he felt them tightening under Sherlock’s hands.
He feels John’s grin against him even as he feels the dampness of John’s cheek brush his own, the taste of salt on his lips vivid from the presence of John’s tears.
They could steal a longboat—row to shore—climb up those dense mountains covered in greenery—escape into the jungle and never look back. But even thinking it, Sherlock knows how impossible it would be—even getting off the ship unnoticed would be more than they could manage.
As Sherlock feels shame make his cheeks grow warm, he realizes that his face feels hotter than it normally does—in fact, the whole of his face and neck and forearms are warm to the touch.
They look tired—Sherlock can see that, even from a distance. Their bodies move stiffly and with great difficulty; their faces are haggard with exhaustion.
Hours still remain until the evening meal and suddenly Sherlock cannot stand the prospect of trying to come up with yet another way to while away the time only to spend another long and tedious evening in the company of dull strangers who have
“Typical that a man stupid enough to make his livelihood torturing animals would think he could escape a room with half a dozen guns trained on him.”
This may be Sherlock’s favorite part of sex so far—the moment after he has come and his body feels slow and heavy and sweet, when his brain has disconnected, and he’s finally able to relax. It’s made even better by the fact that the last few times this has happened, Sherlock has been lucky enough to have an incredibly aroused John still against him, his whole body vibrating with tension, just waiting to be uncovered by Sherlock’s hands, his mouth.
It’s amazing how much less frightened he feels now that Stevens’ meaty fist is no longer wrapped around the back of his neck.
Sherlock’s fingers tightened around his, his voice almost a growl but fraught, pitched low with concern.
John leaned back in against Sherlock’s chest and then tipped his head up, his mouth turning up in a self-satisfied smirk. “On the contrary, I would argue my body’s needs are the root cause of our sex life.”
He has not moved that case since the day the porter deposited it at the foot of his bed at the beginning of the journey so Sherlock never noticed this blatant structural anomaly.
The captain is an intelligent man. Even if his intent had been to put Lestrade out of commission for a few days, he would know that someone had intervened to make him well again. And if Anderson had told the captain about seeing Sherlock, he would know John was involved in the matter.
“Sherlock?” John pulled his hand out from between Sherlock’s motionless ones, and reached up to cup his face. “Love?”
“Come now, my love, stop catching flies and come sit!” His face was flushed with life and the heat of cooking.
“How intriguing!” he teased, pulling at the ribbon tying the two halves of the box together. His nimble fingers carefully pried off the lid before stopping dead. With the lid of the watch closed one could not immediately ascertain the unusual nature of its design, and I held my breath as pale fingers reverently extracted the watch from the box. He looked up at me solemnly for a beat, his eyes wide, before returning them to the gift. When he popped open the hinge I heard his sharp intake of breath.
“You don’t mean to tell me you found a translated copy!” I gasped, staring at the volume in Holmes’ hands.
It was in the early evening of what had, thus far, proven to be a very pleasant spring day in 1882. Holmes and I had been lodging together for a little over a year by this point and, as my scribbles for the Strand can attest, I had always been in awe of Sherlock Holmes. I marvelled at his mind, his abilities, his quick-witted and ingenious deductions, but there was more to it than this. I adored him with every fibre of my being. My whole body felt as though it were tied to him. Everything he did, he did with indescribable grace. His body moved with an unprecedented elegance and I was mesmerised from the moment of our first meeting.
“Watson, I think it best if you seek alternative accommodation. Not immediately if you would rather not, it has been a tiresome day, but tomorrow will suffice.” His voice was emotionless, cold. I felt a chill run down my spine and I shivered involuntarily.
“You’re right,” I whispered,voice hoarse. I stood up abruptly, throwing my pipe down on the mantelpiece. I began pacing the hearthrug, gripping my hair tightly and pulling until it hurt.
I took a fortifying sip of whiskey. His hand was warm and it helped to steady me, and so I began to tell him the whole sorry story: how Holmes, quite out of the blue, had turned to me one evening and requested I find alternative accommodation. I told of how I had fallen deeply in love with Holmes some time ago, but had resigned myself to it, how now I feared he knew the truth of my feelings and was repulsed, disgusted, and never wished to see me again. Stamford listened attentively, brushing his thumb over my hand comfortingly when my voice caught and cracked during my tale. His expression, while sympathetic and reassuring, was also contemplative and quite bewildered. When I had confessed all I realised my tears had made a steady journey down my cheeks without my noticing, so I brought out my handkerchief and wiped them away, slightly embarrassed. I needn't have been, as Stamford and I had been through much together and had wept and comforted each other dozens of times.
He raised his glass, and recovering from my astonishment, I raised my own to his. “This looks wonderful, my love! I- I… I don’t know what to say!” His answering smile was so affectionate and so full of undisguised love that it quite took my breath away.
Later that afternoon, I glanced at Holmes from our bedroom window, pottering about in the field with his hives. In my hands, I considered his retirement anniversary present, watching it glitter in the sunlight. I had been rather extravagant in buying him a new watch and chain, as his old and battered timepiece had recently stopped; the old hands finally coming to rest after a weary decade. He had meant to get it fixed, but he felt so disinclined to travel into town these days -
My eyes flew open at that. His face appeared before me, marred with concern, his expressive brows knitted together with anxiety, but, his eyes, his eyes shone with warmth, with affection. I blinked.
, I thought with a cringe. I didn’t have much in the way of money, I had yet to establish a lucrative practice, only allowing the patients to pay what they could afford, however, in that moment, all I could think of was getting away. The cabbie caught it, shouted at a crossing sweep to mind the horses, and with a toothy grin, bounded up the stairs to do as I asked.
me. It couldn’t be true, yet Stamford’s passionate anger was undeniable. To be so convinced, it must be the truth, and if it was the truth—
“Oh, my darling…” Holmes whispered, abandoning the volume in his lap and taking my face in his hands, delicately wiping away my tear. “You deserve the world.” He punctuated this statement by once again capturing my lips in his. Such joy blossomed in my chest at his tender caresses and heartfelt words that I was quite overcome.
If I had thought his previous expression painful to my heart, his next almost broke it. He had been brave, my Watson, in the face of such cruel words from the one he called friend.
“What do you mean, my love?” His brows lifted slightly in subtle challenge. I grinned. He used to be such a good liar when we only shared our flat, finances, and adventures. When we realised the passion we each felt was reciprocated - and came together in what I can only describe as perfect synergy - I had begun slowly but surely to tear down his walls. Now, there is little that I do not know about him. I have studied his every look, his every mood, every minute detail of the man that I adore. He can no longer treat me with the cool indifference he once employed to bury his affection, and has said as much. It hurts him to hide himself from me, and thus, he has not since attempted to - not when we are alone at any event. When he began to be nothing but his authentic self with me, I fell - although I thought such a thing impossible - even more in love with him than ever. Therefore, it is safe to say, I know when my love is hiding something from me.
He pulled back to look at me, mouth a line of mischief. “Knowledge of literature, nil,” he quoted, matter-of-factly, and I scoffed at the memory of my own words. “I decided retirement would be as good a time as any to rectify that rather damning assessment you made decades ago. I have been reading his plays to the bees… they seem to enjoy them. But I have observed an additional benefit to my recent study.” His smile turned coy. “Such romantic words, it would seem, make you glow in a very becoming manner.”
Did so many years of friendship and companionship really come to this? Was he so disgusted by my proclivities that he couldn't even see me off? My mind whispered black thoughts;
“...You really didn’t know.” His eyes became kinder as he looked into my stricken face. “You’re a fool, Holmes.”
Also triple points to those of you that spotted the lines that I have repurposed and are not at all mine!
” Still he did not awaken, jerking his head back and forth on the pillow. I looked about me and saw a chair in one corner of the room, reluctantly I let go of Watson’s hand and dragged it towards the bed. Noticing the unlit candle on the nightstand, I lit it to better see Watson’s face. My fingers were trembling as I struck the match, and my vision blurred. Candle lit, I once again laid a hand upon Watson’s brow, the other I placed over my eyes, trying to clear my head enough to think.
I awoke feeling content, not burning as I had been previously, but pleasantly warmed, cosy. Slowly, as consciousness began to creep back, I recalled scraps of a conversation. I recalled dreaming in my fevered state that I saw Holmes here, speaking to me. ‘
I cast off his shirt wildly, running my hands over his taut muscles. He broke the kiss to devour the skin of my neck and my breaths came out in harsh pants. He moaned when my fingers skimmed his pectorals and he slid his hands up and down my thighs, sending sparks of arousal up through my body and blood to rush south.
“Well, if we are to exchange presents then let me acquire yours!” I said, jumping up and extracting the little box containing his gift from behind some heavy volumes on the bookshelf.
of you." I pleaded, turning my back to him. "I…" Leaving him like this was breaking my heart. I swallowed hard. "Goodbye H-Holmes." I croaked. With pain in my chest I strode towards the door. I would go to my club. Only then, only when I was alone and behind a locked door would I allow myself to mourn the loss of our friendship and my tattered heart.
My eyes fell to the carpet as they filled with tears. I couldn't breathe, his cold, sharp tone hurt. The pain in my chest was excruciating. I had made the one person in the world whom I truly cared for loathe me.
It proved the easiest task imaginable to track John Watson once I had arrived at Edinburgh station. The man is entirely too memorable, not to mention he possesses the ability to immediately charm any soul he encounters, entirely, I believe, unconsciously. It was a matter of minutes before I was being led by a keen-eyed porter to the lodging house he had directed Watson to earlier that day.
He stopped short in the middle of the room, and stared at me with such a piercing gaze that it unnerved me. He seemed to come to some sort of decision in his mind because he stopped frowning and drew himself up to his full height, rolling back his shoulders and lifting his chin high. I knew the expression he had on his face. It was the expression he wore when he was placing that abominable mask on, that cool, unfeeling mask of indifference. My blood ran cold.
In the meantime I decided to read in the garden. The sun was warm and the breeze gentle, and grabbing a novel, I lay down in the hammock and began to read. It was not long before I fell asleep.
“You feared your love,” I said carefully, beginning to understand. “That is why you sent me away…” A darker thought crept into my mind then, “You didn’t… want what you felt to distract you from your work…” I looked down at the bedsheet, suddenly feeling self-conscious, vulnerable. “You said yourself that you abhor the softer emotions-”
“I suppose I had better make some tea and warm my hands if I am to be allowed to kiss my husband again anytime soon!” Smiling cheeky, he turned to fill the kettle from the tap before placing it on the stove.
I felt wretched. But I could not allow myself to wallow. I had done what was best for Watson. We had been sharing rooms together for almost a year when I began to feel for him a deep longing, a yearning of immeasurable passion. At first it was our warm friendship that I most cherished in life, but soon he had come to mean much more, he was the world to me. I would find myself watching him, basking in his look of concentration when writing, his face puzzled as he struggled to remember specifics, before it transformed into excited reminiscence.
“Not here, Stamford. Come up to my room, I am staying here.” I barely had time to register his look of surprise as I turned around and led him from the room.
Confound it all! What I had done was for his sake, I told myself – for what felt like the thousandth time, and thus logic dictated that I should have felt nothing but relief that he was no longer at risk, or in close proximity to my perverse desires, and
My heart soared. I kissed him back, matching his movements, tasting his sweet lips as I had ached to do for so long. He hummed contentedly as I lifted my hands and buried them in his thick hair. I threaded my fingers through his dark locks, gently caressing his scalp whilst I opened my mouth to deepen the kiss. He responded eagerly, his tongue exploring enthusiastically, questing in his usual thorough manner. He shifted off the chair and came to kneel on the bed, looming above me, not once breaking the kiss, simply needing to be closer.
Also for those of you that may have noticed the mild repurposing of part of this scene and can tell me where it is from, we can be friends forever ;)
look at him. If I looked I knew I would break. I hurtled in, entirely too fast, and cringed as I stumbled over to my desk. I could see Holmes out of the corner of my eye by the window.
“I… I didn’t imagine it? You are real, you are here, y-you…” I faltered, not daring to ask the question. But, as ever, Holmes knew precisely what I was thinking, as he so often does. In answer, he shifted forward on the chair, took my face in his long, elegant hands, and he kissed me.
“Darling… What on Earth…?” I said, trying to hold back from laughing at the ridiculous spectacle. Holmes never cooked. Never. We usually have our cleaning lady from the village prepare us some meals which can be reheated or easily put together and the rest of the time I cook our meals. Holmes had always shown a distinct dislike for cooking of any kind. He called it a messy business with too many unpredictable variables.
“Shhhh…” he sighed, nipping at my collarbone, “The door is locked but the walls aren’t overly thick. We may be on the top floor but we must be quiet, my love.”
This was the very reason I had to cast him away. My perverse heart and mind would taint him and our friendship both. Such close proximity to him had become excruciating. He was better off away, far away; I could not risk destroying our friendship completely. If I cast him out, he may eventually forgive me. My own corrupt nature was my burden to bear, and I would not subject him to it. It was not by any way imaginable
I was not expecting, however, to be led to the ramshackle, decaying residence, that I stood before. I hardly heard the porter when he mentioned ‘the gentleman’ had taken the attic room, but paid him for his trouble absently as I stared up at the tall, crumbling building. The upper level of the house looked like it had been a rushed afterthought, installed carelessly and cheaply. The box window loomed ominously out over the rest in an alarmingly slanted fashion. The rest of the windows had been so weathered by the elements that the wooden frames were warped and bent, and, despite the evening darkness, I could see the glass was filthy. Mould clawed it's way up the panes like a cancer, blackening the edges in a grotesquely.
“John captured you perfectly in his stories, I see. Verbatim, even—such a cold, callous machine that you can’t even recall the cruel, heartless way you treated your devoted friend not three days ago!” Stamford’s voice began quiet and cutting, but he shouted the last words with a venom I had never before heard uttered from his lips.
“I suppose you’d better…” I said, eyes narrowing. Where had he been this morning? He must have walked into the village for some reason, although I knew not for what. I sat down at the kitchen table, eyes wandering over my husband’s form. Tomorrow it would be an entire year of having him all to myself in this beautiful cottage, and yet it still hadn’t sunk in. This still felt like some ridiculously idyllic dream, some ludicrous fantasy. I half-expected to wake up some mornings and find myself back at Baker Street, Holmes keeping his distance while I watched him in awe and badly disguised desire. Or worse, wake to find him still dead, lost to me amongst the swirling water of the falls.
John gets into a cab at 10:30 and leaves for the appointment with Mrs. Hudson’s best interests at heart. However, he knows even before he sets foot in the room that he won’t be able to stay.
John couldn’t help himself. His eyes fluttered shut. He’d always been particularly sensitive to hickeys. He found himself tipping his head back to offer Sherlock more of his throat. His hands strained against Sherlock’s grip. He wanted to reach up and pull Sherlock down on top of him.
So I realized that once again, I am posting a new chapter on a holiday weekend- this time for Mother's Day! So please think of this as a special gift for all of you remarkable people out there who are brave enough to be moms. Please take this humble gift of gay sailor love as a salute to all that you do. There will never be enough thanks and appreciation for mothers as far as I'm concerned. I am in endless awe of you. <33
It is with great relief and elation that I can now report that I PASSED MY PHD EXAMS and life has gone back to a more manageable speed, which means much, much more time for writing about these darling petals.
He wouldn’t have heard Sherlock approach but the tiny bell on the shop door gave him away. Sherlock didn’t sit; he walked down several steps and hovered nervously at John’s side. John didn’t look up but he could feel the concern emanating from Sherlock like a faint pulse.
They sent Mycroft a note. “Tell your little brother if he wants his friend to live he should come to us. No more games. We’ll give him 48 hours.”
But just as quickly he realizes that John is standing on the other side of the gunwale by the part of the ship they call the cat’s head, where the anchor is stored.
For one horrible second, Sherlock’s heart stops because it looks as though John has dropped over the side of the ship into the sea.
John tugged on his waistcoat, felt his cheeks heat slightly at the unwavering force of Sherlock’s gaze.
Sherlock watches the emotions on John’s face shift, rippling like the wind through the grass, changing so fast he doesn’t have time to discern one from the other.
“Yes,” he says in a breathless rush, once again overcome with the fear that they’ll run out of time before they can get to it. “Yes,” he says again, pulling his fingers free and groping for the bottle where he dropped it on the bed.
He knows that John’s cock is what needs his attention right now—the feel of it, blood-hot and rigid against his thigh is enough to make Sherlock moan helplessly—he feels John shift against him at the sound, his breathing strained—but he cannot stop himself from reaching down and letting his hands enjoy a thorough exploration of those exquisite hips, the luscious muscles of John’s arse.
“Oh aye, he’ll be along! He was up in the sails, last I seen him. Some bit of business Lieutenant Moore wanted him to attend to before we set off. But I expect he’ll be along shortly.”
“At that point I had only a hypothesis.” Sherlock’s voice was quiet, and John thought he heard the tiniest hint of shame creep in around the words. Sherlock poured water down the right side of John’s back to rinse the soap from his shoulder. “I had to test it to see if I was right.”
John nodded, his head still swimming, suddenly furious with himself for being so frail, but the threat of fire made his throat close up with fear. It was as though Moriarty was with them in the room, living in the flames.
John pulled Sherlock up to his mouth, feeling utterly boneless, barely conscious, his body humming with the aftermath of his orgasm, gasping softly as Sherlock’s tongue met his, overwhelmed for a moment at the taste of himself on Sherlock’s lips.
Needless to say, John was more than a little relieved when the plane touched down in London. He bid an awkward farewell to Sarah in the taxi queue at Heathrow and concluded that if nothing else, the trip had at least made him grateful to return home to the madness of Baker Street.
It’s only because John’s hand is still resting above Sherlock’s elbow that he feels the slight tension in his grip at her question.
“Don’t thank me yet, Deverall. Remember—seven knots by eight bells, or I’ll cut the rum rations instead of doubling them. You have my word on that.”
Sherlock managed to keep himself occupied thanks to a steady stream of communication between him and Lestrade. John wasn’t sure whether he was feeding Sherlock details about potential cases, or if Sherlock was simply nagging him, but whatever it was it kept Sherlock busy.
It isn’t so much the sting of his cut lip, or the ache of his bruised ribs that makes him upset, but the shame that a greasy, weasely good-for-nothing of a man like Anderson can bring him to his knees in a fight.
Through the darkness, not fifty feet from where he stands, he can make out the figures of the men working the pumps. It seems they have not stopped since Sherlock heard them at it earlier and his eyes flicker over the figures bent over their work to see if it is indeed John’s mess.
Just the sight of Sherlock, kneeling in front of him in his three-piece suit, his silk bowtie still hanging around his neck, the dark waves of his smoothed back hair catching the light from the window—it was almost too much for John.
He could feel the hot thump of his own pulse in the base of his throat as he studied the shadows playing over Sherlock’s face.
John wasn’t sure how long he lay there nearly senseless, enjoying the feeling of Sherlock’s fingers rubbing so softly, so meditatively in his hair, but gradually he felt the rumble of Sherlock’s voice under his cheek.
He established a rhythm based on the variations he heard in Sherlock’s breathing, the slight changes in tempo, the hitch in his breath when his hand did something right.
Sherlock lowers his head closer to his plate, determined to ignore the scowling face of the man opposite but Sherlock can feel the force of his glare even without lifting his head. Anderson’s rage is as palpable as a sudden cloud moving over the sun. It feels as though all the warmth has gone out of the room.
But instead of saying any of this aloud, when he finally opens his mouth to speak, Sherlock finds that the question that comes out is of a slightly different nature.
John must sense his hesitation because he’s opening his eyes and hitching himself up on his elbows to look down at Sherlock.
He arched his back to push his chest closer to Sherlock’s, lifting his crossed knees to cradle Sherlock in his lap. He let his lips move over Sherlock’s ear. “Fuck me, Sherlock.
John shakes out the smoking match, sets it on the desk beside the candle, and then comes toward Sherlock, the ghost of a smile of his face.
“It’s only going to make you hotter,” John said, his lips sticking against Sherlock’s neck. “You’re going to be dripping with sweat by the time I’m finished with you. Dripping with sweat and your own come.”
Ferguson re-emerges with the tobacco in hand and he’s just about to hand it off to Sherlock, signaling the end of their brief meeting, when Sherlock opens his mouth, feigning embarrassment.
Sherlock can tell he’s trying to brag about the opportunity, but there’s something in Ferguson’s voice that rings false, that makes Sherlock suspect that Ferguson had no interest in coming to India at all, and it isn’t just the aura of bitterness that Ferguson seems to carry around with him wherever he goes, that resentment that seems to hang around people of Ferguson’s class—like polish worn off a cheap replica of a counterfeit good.
, and Sherlock dives down to take John’s twitching cock back between his lips to catch the next burst of come.
Sherlock studies Deverall’s expression another moment more and he’s impressed in spite of himself by the way the man endures his scrutiny. People usually look away after a few seconds when Sherlock studies them this intently, but Deverall holds his gaze, a crease of concern still visible between his brows, his grey eyes full of some emotion Sherlock cannot place.
He feels John’s calf where it’s lying draped over his leg tighten slightly, drawing him closer, pulling their hips into alignment, and now all chances of forming a coherent thought are lost to Sherlock as he feels the growing hardness of John’s cock against his own.
John pulls his hand out of Sherlock’s grasp and there is anger emanating from him now—fierce and hot as a living flame.
Sherlock is just considering stepping out of his hiding place and appealing to the older sailor. He does not know what to do and he is so desperate for any kind of advice or help that he almost breaks his prohibition not to talk to any of them, further endangering their livelihood, but just before he does, a sound from further down the deck draws Sherlock’s head up like a hare at the sound of a snapping twig.
“He saw me on Blackfriar’s Bridge. He knew it was me.” Sherlock drags his fingers through his wet hair; coupled with the frantic, furious expression on his face, it makes him look mad. “You’re right, Molly. I can’t convince him.”
She beams at him again over the rim of her coffee cup and Sherlock finds himself staring back at her in blank surprise. Miss Hooper’s sudden freedom is so unprecedented Sherlock can scarcely believe it’s true.
The taste of John, the smell of him is like a tonic curing all of Sherlock’s ailments—he cannot get enough.
“Those two weeks when you were away, I… let myself examine how deep it went—my desire for you—as an experiment, just to see. It was…” Sherlock shut his eyes and John watched the slender line reappear between his eyebrows. “Intolerable.”
Something was happening to Sherlock’s face—something about John’s reaction was upsetting him. He looked disturbed.
Sherlock’s dismay must be evident on his face because John’s hand is rubbing his arm in gentle concern.
He no longer needs to think about which action he is going to perform next, his body, for once, is ahead of his brain; it’s making all the decisions for him.
John felt the low burn of want in his belly surge into a ripple of pure flame at the sight of Sherlock’s cock springing free, curving long and deeply flushed against his stomach.
“I will inform Lieutenant Moore of your situation, so you will not be expected back on the ship tomorrow night.”
Lestrade came around and took Sherlock’s other arm. This time he didn’t protest. Between the two of them, they managed to get Sherlock out to the curb. Several hospital attendants passed them on their way with inquisitive looks but John’s expression stopped all of them from offering any kind of assistance.
Sherlock watches the edge of John’s jaw harden, thinks of what he has seen of the ill-tempered captain, and marvels at the daring of John Watson to challenge this man.
He leans down to kiss John’s mouth even while his hand begins to creep down John’s belly and towards the line of his cock.
John mouths his way down to the groove between Sherlock’s collarbones, pulling wide the collar of Sherlock’s linen shirt, his hands slipping around beneath Sherlock’s jacket, over the ivory and gold stripes of his waistcoat to hold his waist.
In spite of his eagerness upon seeing Sherlock, it’s painfully evident how tired the boy must be, judging by his silence as they begin to walk together towards the front of the ship.
As hard as he tries to feel nothing but sheer confidence and self-possession as he walks through the door, Sherlock cannot stop the low hum of nervous tension building in him at the reality that he is at last going to come fact to face with this man.
) is going to have lots of new exciting additions soon... so stay tuned for news of that in the future!
The food was ready not long after, and John set one steaming mug and plate in front of Sherlock who reached gratefully for the tea, his eyes on John as he brought the mug to his lips.
John groans from where his mouth is pressed against the skin of Sherlock’s belly, the warmth of the exhalation sending a frisson of heat over his bare skin.
As if that wasn’t enough, now John’s mouth is back against his ear, his voice like rough silk. “You’re so gorgeous like this—so, so gorgeous. Can I tell you though—how gorgeous you’ll look when it’s me entering you like this? When I’ve got you beneath me—or above me—your legs around my waist?”
“There’s no point repeating it. Unpleasant things.” John ran a hand through his hair and was embarrassed to note that he was shaking, his body wracked with fine tremors. He didn’t want Sherlock to see him like this. He was ashamed by how much it was affecting him, by how much five minutes with a madman had made him come undone. John had always assumed he was made of stronger stuff. “I’m fine now. You don’t have to…” He stopped himself before he said ‘worry.’ Somehow, that didn’t seem like the right thing to say to Sherlock.
Sherlock whips his head up to look toward the very top mast and although he still cannot make out the shape of the man who’s singing, he knows at once, who it is.
Billy on his search below decks, and it suddenly feels crucial that he have an explanation ready on hand, to account for his presence in this part of the ship.
Marty Jones fired two shots into the snarling mass of fur. John heard a yelp of pain, saw the back leg of one dog give out. Despite the obvious gravity of the wound, the dogs continued fighting, locked together, growling.
Sherlock takes it gratefully, lifts the bottle to his mouth to take a long drink, and then almost chokes. The canteen is full of some strong spirit that burns like fire all down his throat and into his stomach. He breaks off, coughing and spluttering.
The realization was staggering. It made the desire in John’s belly unfurl in a long, shuddering sweep of heat.
At first, even the smaller road is full of people, but the longer they walk, the fewer and fewer people they pass, until John directs them onto what could only loosely be described as a path, that seems to lead right into the heart of the jungle.
His grip was strong but John felt rage wake in him at his touch. He twisted his hand free with a snarl and Moriarty stepped back, laughing.
The doctor hesitated and John could tell there was something he wasn’t telling them. He felt concern spike his chest.
Not only was there something wrong with his posture—a stiffness, a restrained quality that seemed to demonstrate an effort to hold himself together through sheer physical fortitude—but there was a darkness, a
“Like that, Johnny boy? Feels good, doesn’t it? Would you like to know how it feels inside you? I’ll bet you do. Open up now, just a little bit more, for Daddy… That’s it. Good.”
John reached out and took hold of Sherlock’s hand where it lay motionless beside his wine glass. He squeezed Sherlock’s fingers between his own, saw the crease between Sherlock’s eyebrows deepen in confusion.
Molly looks at him, startled, and then, seeing the look in Sherlock’s eye, smiles in spite of herself. But then her eyes are darting back to her aunt at her side and she shakes her head.
This realization, coupled with Sherlock’s sudden roughness, his abandon, made John moan with arousal, his own hips rocking against the side of the couch, seeking stimulation.
John saw his tongue dart out and lick his lips. “I’ll even let you taste it, if you’re still alive at that point.” He bent down over John’s mouth, exhaling messily. John smelled spearmint and gagged. “Luckily, I know some tricks to make you laaast.”
“And if you couldn’t tell that simply from being in the same room with me,” Sherlock went on, fingers squeezing lightly, applying the perfect amount of pressure as they began to speed up. “Then you’re a fool, John Watson.”
John holds onto him, his tears trickling hot and wet into Sherlock’s neck, his arms around Sherlock almost squeezing the air from his lungs, but the pain is good because it reminds Sherlock how strong John is, gives him the reassurance that no matter what happens, John will survive this, even if he might not.
“Nothing, sir. I was just explaining to Mr. Ferguson here that it’s in his best interest to stay out of the crew’s way while they’re busy restocking the ship.”
The melody is beautiful but sad, the voice singing it low and full of longing. It makes Sherlock's chest ache, fills him with an indefinable sorrow.
“Those slender white hands of yours—I bet they couldn’t even lift a bucket. You don’t have any idea what real work is like. How could you? You’re a spoiled, aristocratic, little brat.”
He wishes he could hold onto this feeling, keep it with him always. He could take on any challenge, face any enemy, if only he could feel like this all the time.
Sherlock considers creeping out from underneath the longboat to watch John climbing down, but fear keeps him where he is.
“No, I just have an excellent teacher,” Sherlock says and then he recaptures John’s mouth with his fully and doesn’t let him speak for several minutes more.
Sherlock watches his mouth fall open in a soundless cry, the muscles in his abdomen flexing as he pushes up into Sherlock’s hand, hands reaching out blindly to clench in the sheets.
He feels John’s fingers on his temples, tilting his head up a fraction of an inch more, and the warmth in Sherlock’s belly grows at the feeling of John manipulating his body, however minutely, and through the warm haze of his contentment he finds himself thinking,
Something about Sherlock’s tone of voice made it clear that that was the last he would say on the subject. Even if he was lying, John was grateful for the excuse not to press the matter. Any reason to forget it happened was a good reason. He breathed a small internal sigh of relief. Good. Things could go back to normal.
It is a wide, slow, sleepy smile that makes Sherlock think of a lion stretching awake under the savannah sun. John’s grip shifts around Sherlock, tightens pleasantly.
Sherlock looked up at him when he had finished, and although the raw panic had left his eyes, there was still a glimmer of something like unease in the center of each pupil.
He heard Sherlock make a whimpering sound in the back of his throat before opening his mouth against John’s and answering his request, pushing his tongue into John’s mouth to stroke the length of John’s.
John’s mouth is soft against his, coaxing Sherlock’s open with his tongue. Sherlock lets his lips part and John licks into his open mouth, tasting of salt.
It took Sherlock a moment to react. His head jerked up, his hazy eyes opening to look down at John in confusion but before he could open his mouth to question John’s decision John was already putting his new plan into action.
“It’s different with you though…” John says, his hand returning to Sherlock’s neck, sliding up into his hair, his eyes flickering soft over Sherlock’s face, his expression full of awe. “Everything is different.”
“You know…” Anderson drawls, his bored voice full of superiority. “If you pinched this from someone, I can have you whipped for theft. Do you know what they do to thieves at sea, Holmes? They bend you over a cannon and flog you senseless. God, what I wouldn’t give to see that. Your pretty little face all twisted up and covered with tear—”
It’s awful; he does not know what to do, what to say, it feels as though he is paralyzed by the wrongness of the moment. It’s as though because he did not reach for John instinctively he does not have any idea how to act.
Sherlock shifts against him, torn between the desire to listen to John—to just forget everything, to choose to believe that it will be all right—and between the very real fear that, in fact, the problem is much bigger than either of them can guess, that Sherlock has crossed a line that he never should have crossed, and now there’s no turning back.
He freezes with the bottle tipped against his fingers as he realizes that he isn’t sure exactly how to go about the next step (beyond the basic principal, of course).
John waits for the dizziness to pass, his whole body trembling, whether from fatigue or adrenaline he isn’t sure. He goes over to the window and checks the latches. They are all locked, sealed from the inside. No matter. Something about the drama of coming in through the window seems like it would appeal to Sherlock, but he could have just as easily strolled in through the front door.
John sits back to watch him, and it takes all of Sherlock’s concentration not to turn and simply look at John sitting on his haunches, the casual elegance of his strong body in repose—one arm resting on the top of his thigh, the muscles in his upper arm so prominent even when relaxed.
John moans at this, fingers tightening in Sherlock’s curls, and Sherlock sucks harder, working to keep his movements steady, searching for just the right amount of friction that will finally push John over the edge.
What will John do when he finds out? Will he be able to stop himself from beating Stevens to a bloody pulp, as Sherlock knows he will want to do, as soon as he learns what happened?
Sherlock tsked at him. “Nonsense. It really couldn’t be more in our favor that the Briggs woman is so fond of showy displays. You don’t have to put it on until we get in the cab. Now, ready?”
As his eyes catch hers, Miss Hooper drops into a nervous curtsy of acknowledgment before hurrying away toward the stairs.
as soon as I woke up,” Sherlock adds, blushing fiercely. John’s answering grin almost makes Sherlock lose his train of thought. “But when I got up on deck, the captain was on the quarterdeck so I had to wait until he’d gone. When I went back down to my cabin to pass the time, I was returning my evening clothes to my trunk when I found a letter that my brother had given to me before I left England. I had never opened it.”
But Sherlock knows them too well. They won’t feel sorry. The news, Sherlock knows, will bring relief.
“Burying my cock in you and fucking you until you can’t remember your own name?” He smiles against Sherlock’s, slow and sinful. “Yes, that’s what I mean.”
Shifting his weight, Sherlock pulled his hand free from where it was still tucked between them, and curled himself closer against John. His face where it was pressed against John’s neck was damp.
For a moment, John wasn’t sure if Sherlock had heard him but when he glanced over Sherlock nodded his assent.
He does not know how to answer. It seems cruel now to tell Molly that he has no interest in going if he has no hope of seeing John—it seems ungrateful, petty even. But equally cruel is the option of telling her that he might be going when she will be forced to stay onboard—so close to the promise of the bustling port and all the excitement it entails, and yet so far.
There was a question in his eyes, and a longing so deep, John heard himself groan at the sight of it.
Sherlock was so caught up in John’s singing that he only now realizes he’s been painting the same strip of railing for the last three minutes.
Sherlock hesitates, uncertain if he wants to reveal this ugly side of himself to John—John who is full of so much goodness, so much light.
He starts out softly at first, his singing smooth and steady, keeping time perfectly with only the cadence of his own voice.
He looks worse than exhausted; he looks… defeated, somehow, as though the very vitality that usually keeps him going, that source of his continual strength has been savagely cut off.
Sherlock was lying on his back under the sink, brandishing a blowtorch. John could see sparks flaring around Sherlock’s torso. At the sound of John’s voice, he shimmied out into the light. John was at least glad to see he was wearing safety goggles.
John looks at him, his eyes so much darker than the bright sky behind him. He rubs his warm thumb over Sherlock’s palm, making Sherlock shiver in response.
“But you won’t will you? No, because you like it.” He heard the smirk in Moriarty’s voice. “John Watson likes it with a knife between his legs. Don’t tell Sherlock. My, my, what would he think?”
Sherlock watches quietly, with rapt attention, his eyes focused with hawk-like scrutiny as the sailor explains to him how to emulate his movements.
Sherlock nods, breathless, turning to catch John’s mouth with his, desperate to convey how this feels to him but knowing he cannot do so with words. So he kisses John instead, pushing his tongue in past John’s lips, sinking into the heat of John’s mouth, groaning low in his throat as John’s tongue pushes back against his, mimicking the slide of his finger deeper into Sherlock.
But as he moves to take his seat, he looks again, and sees that many of the glances are not accusatory or scandalized at all but rather curious and full of cautious interest.
“Good. I’m glad to hear it.” He can hear the smile in John’s voice even without looking at him. “You look… nice.”
“You’ve got some on your waistcoat too.” There is dismay in John’s voice, and glancing down, Sherlock sees he’s right.
Besides, nothing about the way he related to Sherlock had ever made sense, and it certainly had never been conventional, so why question it now?
He moves to stand on Sherlock’s left side, looping his right arm low around Sherlock’s waist. Sherlock places his left arm around John’s shoulders, mirroring the other dancers, and feels a thrill of sheer electric excitement move through him as he does.
His mouth descends to the skin just below Sherlock’s ear and Sherlock’s sharp intake of breath is as loud as a gunshot in the dark.
He knew the ship would be making stops in a handful of port cities en route to India but he’s been so caught up in the misery of his separation from John that Sherlock has not given a second thought to the ship’s progress. If they are a week out from making port in South America—
The words stick in Sherlock’s throat. But here he must tell John the truth, because on this point in particular it’s in John’s best interest to be fully aware, so that he may protect himself, in case the captain decides to act on the information Sherlock has confided in him. Of that much he is certain, whatever he tries to tell himself.
John opens his mouth to protest but before he can speak Anderson has whirled around to face him. “I would advise that you think very carefully about your choice of words before speaking to me,
Sherlock has asked him about it before and John told him that the feeling of being up there is indescribable. “Nothing but the wind in your hair and the vast blue of the ocean below you, the blue of sky all around you. It’s the most free I’ve ever felt. It’s impossible to explain unless you’ve experienced it. You feel invincible up there. It’s what I imagine flying would feel like—like you become part of the sky.”
“Beautiful…” he mumbled into my skin, and I clawed at his smallclothes, desperate to see all of him. He understood my action perfectly and pulled down his smalls to reveal the most exquisite sight. My breath hitched to see him so exposed and, impossibly, I became even more aroused. We rocked together then, gasping at the pleasure the friction brought to both of us, not needing anymore than this, so overwound as we were. All too soon we found our completion, Holmes keening and sighing above me as he reached his climax. I thought he was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.
Holmes laughed and looked down at the red leather-bound book he had taken from the desk. “You remember you read a short translated monograph by the psychiatrist Sigmund Freud a few months ago and were inspired by his work…” He was looking down, obviously slightly bashful, as he made his way over to the settee where I was perched.
“I cannot find the words…” I murmured as I traced his lips with mine. “I… I don’t deserve you, my love…” My voice shook with emotion as a single traitorous tear slipped down my cheek.
I sighed and lit my pipe. I briefly wondered where he would have gone, after I had cast him out so cruelly.
“H-Holmes?” I stammered, the tears that threatened upon my waking loomed in the wings once more, but this time they were not tears of grief.
The cottage this morning was oddly quiet, and I knew it was too early for Holmes to be visiting his bees (for bees, Holmes informs me, deserve lie-ins too). Just as I was contemplating going in search of my mislaid husband, I heard the door to our cottage open and shut hurriedly before bustling sounds from the kitchen reached my ears. Curiosity thoroughly piqued, I got up and shrugged a dressing gown over my nightshirt. The wooden stairs felt cool but comforting against my toes and they made that distinct, but pleasant sound that bare feet do on flooring, no doubt alerting Holmes to my approach. To my surprise, Holmes didn’t seem to hear my coming in the least. He hurried around the kitchen putting away objects in cupboards and unpacking brown paper bags before screwing them up and stuffing them into a drawer - which was decidedly not where they belonged - in such a flamboyant fashion that I couldn’t help but grin. It reminded me of the haphazard way in which he used to clear away papers in preparation for a client.
I had hardly moved since Watson left. Although I frequently allow myself to be deprived of sustenance, or even basic needs, I felt worse than I ever had. Worse even than the pain of my morphine dependence, and the agony of its withdrawal. But what I felt at that moment as I sat in my chair, staring helplessly at Watson’s empty one, was beyond words. Beyond understanding, beyond comprehension.
“Shh,” John breathes against him. “I know what you need. Don’t worry, love. I’m here. Here you are. I’m right here. You’ve got me.”
I just want to say that I am posting this current chapter from the house of one of my all-time fandom besties, the person who got me into Sherlock in the first place and edited my very first fic,
And then, just when Sherlock is ready to rise from his spot and climb back up the ladder himself—finally—
Molly is still looking at him curiously but mercifully she decides to let the matter rest. She’s quiet as they take the stairs to the upper deck.
To their right stretches the bay, dotted with ships of all sizes—small fishing vessels and trading boats, wooden junkets and coracles with square sails, grand three-masted tall ships like the
There was smoke pouring into the room from the deck outside, the shimmer of raw heat across the threshold a clear indication that they could no longer exit the way they had come in.
The instrument of punishment—a thin rattan cane that Sherlock recognizes from his boyhood school days—although nothing like the dreaded instrument used in flogging the sailors, is still exceedingly painful in its own right, particularly when applied to bare flesh.
He crouches down beside John, unfastening the first few buttons on his waistcoat before he returns to work. He catches John looking over at him.
“You look… you look good,” he stammers, feeling his cheeks flush with embarrassment as his words utterly fail to convey what he’s trying to say. He tries again. “I mean, you look nice, tonight… your—your blue shirt.”
John must have reacted in some visceral way to the memory because all of a sudden Sherlock broke the kiss, and stepped back, one hand coming up to cover his mouth, as though ashamed. “I’m sorry,” he said, breathless, shaking his head. “I’m sorry, that wasn’t—”
He passes the time rehearsing the very stern lecture he plans to give to Sherlock about the social incorrectness of faking your own suicide and tricking your best friend.
He’s holding John’s head in both hands now, his shoulders leaning hard into the wall at his back, hips jutting forward to meet John’s palm. The hand that’s not in Sherlock’s breeches is still in his hair, tilting Sherlock’s mouth up to his, and Sherlock wonders distantly if that is finally what will push him over the edge—the feeling of John’s blunt nails scraping his scalp, his fingers tugging gently now and then at a handful of curls.
“I do,” John repeated, and this time, he couldn’t stop himself from kissing Sherlock. He leaned in and brushed his lips against Sherlock’s parted ones, so softly he could feel that Sherlock’s lips were shaking.
Sherlock gasps at the touch, the necklace falling from his fingers. He lifts up, so John’s hands can continue exploring, tracing the swell of his buttocks down to where they meet his thighs.
John shut his eyes briefly to enjoy the sensation, slightly embarrassed at how much it was affecting him, at the same time he realized that this was the most physical contact he’d had with Sherlock in the past five days.
Molly readjusts her grip on her parasol, her nose wrinkling with distaste. “I’ve seen him more than once being cruel to the younger boys. I can’t abide anyone who picks on someone smaller and weaker than themselves. Absolutely vile behavior.”
, John thought deliriously, blasphemously, his mind tilting into nonsensical fancy as Sherlock worked the vein on the underside of John’s very prominent erection, making shivers erupt down his spine, setting his toes to tingling in the constriction of his boots.
Lestrade looks alarmed—however, something tells Sherlock it’s more from the open display of his emotions than it is for any concern over John’s wellbeing.
Although Sherlock is not certain as to the nature of his profession, he suspects the man is a banker, perhaps a creditor, someone who deals intimately with money in a way that those in the landed gentry would find distasteful.
At this realization, Sherlock is overwhelmed once again by the pitiful nature of his current existence.
But the truth is there’s no telling what John will do; he might very well decide it’s a safer bet just to stay put.
When Sherlock returns to his cabin, he can feel even from below decks, that the sun has reached its pinnacle in the cloudless sky and is sending the force of its baking rays down through the layers of the ship, the heat soaking into the worm-eaten wood until it feels like they are all trapped on a floating oven suspended in the middle of the Atlantic.
Maybe, in order to be certain, he prescribed the Lieutenant a milder dose of what he’d used on Captain Adams, simply to ensure he wouldn’t come meddling in his private affairs.
He ran his hands up Sherlock’s calves, up the backs of his knees until he was gripping him by his thighs. He buried his face in the curve of Sherlock’s hip, dragging his nose into the dark hair between his legs, mouthing at the base of his cock.
“It’s alright,” he gasps, struggling to catch his breath. “The others are keeping watch. Burns said he would send word if there’s any trouble.”
He pauses in the doorway, offers uselessly, “Don’t go anywhere, and don’t let anyone in. I’ll be back with help shortly, I promise.”
John watched Sherlock’s expression momentarily break, before hardening into a mask of stone. If he hadn’t been watching Sherlock’s face he would have missed it.
A young woman with thin brown hair and a nervous, melancholy smile—Miss Hooper is her name—lifts her eyes to Mr. Jackson. Sherlock has never heard her say two words together. Therefore, he assumes he is as startled as everyone else at the table when Miss Hooper asks, in a voice just above a whisper, “Will all the officers be in attendance, sir?”
Sherlock’s head is ringing from where it connected with the wall; he tries to catch his breath to respond but before he can manage Anderson is slamming him back into the wall again.
Sherlock ducks his head, blushing furiously. He fiddles with the edge of his coat, mutters, “It’s nothing.”
“So good to see you get some time on shore. It seems I never see you when you’re not standing over that sweating monster of a stove.”
He should have realized that Deverall was going to come into this tavern based on the conversation he shared with Lieutenant Lestrade outside, but Sherlock had been hopeful that there was another place just around the corner, specifically for officers and higher-ranking members of the ship that the lieutenants would have gravitated towards.
Sherlock’s heart is pounding. He cannot explain the irrational feeling of dread that if John leaves his side everything that happened between them will vanish like a curl of smoke, as if John’s physical presence will take away all traces of the event, and it will be nothing more than a dream—as if John leaving his side means he will never see him again.
At the memory of John, Sherlock feels pain knife through him, churning in a deep sickness in the pit of his belly, but then the ship rolls again—sending the bucket under Sherlock’s bunk sliding back across the floor with another loud thunk—and Sherlock realizes it is not his misery over John that is responsible for the pain in his belly but the violent motion of the heaving ship.
Sherlock considers briefly. He wants to ask Molly if she’d like to take a walk with him up on deck after breakfast. However, he isn’t sure whether it’s even worth asking after what he did last night. The pretense he was working so carefully to uphold, of being courteous and deferential toward Molly’s chaperone in order to stay in her good graces, has surely been completely shattered. He’s certain Ms. Grimsby’s opinion of him is lower than it’s ever been.
As if on cue, there was a loud snapping sound of cables giving way and John saw the lifeboat that was suspended in midair lurch hard to one side.
He pushes his trousers a bit further down his hips before taking himself in hand with his oil-slicked fingers.
He turns to look at her and he can see the excitement shining in her eyes, as clearly as he can see it in the faces of the passengers crowding the decks around them.
Sensing Sherlock’s reluctance, John turns to him with a gleam in his eye. “Whoever reaches the shoreline last owes a kiss to the winner.”
“I suppose it’s just that… getting to see this place was my last chance of any real freedom before we reach India. Once we arrive in Madras, I’ll be ushered immediately into the care of the family I’ll be serving. It’s like Grimsby said—they’re locked within the walls of their estate. As far as I understand, they live very much as any English family does. I’ll be trapped there just as I’ve always been trapped by my life back in England.”
Sherlock can picture him, studying the end of his cane in a disinterested manner, as if checking for any trace of filth.
John’s rich voice is as melodious as ever, somehow more so in the dark. Perhaps it is the presence of the open sky above them, or the ocean at their feet; perhaps it creates a richer canvas on which to experience the sound, or maybe it is just the fact that Sherlock can feel every nuance of John’s breath, every inhale, every exhale of gentle heat as he sings each note, holds it and shapes it with his voice, so that Sherlock is feeling the song as much as he is hearing it.
“Shut up.” John put his hands on Sherlock’s inner thighs and pushed them apart, kneeling between Sherlock’s spread legs. He exhaled at the sight. “Christ, you have a lovely arse.”
Sherlock risks a glance around the corner to see just how far past Ferguson’s room the men are standing. They are about fifty feet further down the corridor, and it’s clear by their position that Ferguson accosted Knott coming out of his room—they are standing just in front of it.
Sherlock rocked back on his heels, his weight shifting again, and with that motion, it was all over. John’s mind went blank with panic. How was Sherlock not noticing? Thankfully, he took that moment to lean forward into his hands, lifting his hips off of John’s.
His hands find Sherlock’s arms, close around them, and he is pulling Sherlock to him with a terrible strength, using his body to communicate what his voice cannot.
Sherlock sees Ferguson curl his lip in derision from the corner of his eye, but he turns to follow Sherlock toward the hatch in the center of the deck.
The realization doubles Sherlock’s urgency and arousal both, and he drops his mouth to John’s, sliding his tongue in between John’s lips without waiting for an invitation, his own stomach pooling with sudden warmth at the low, animalistic sound the gesture pulls from John’s throat.
“Nothing that will harm you permanently. It was only a mild combination of sedatives and hallucinogenics. In my defense, let me just emphasize that the pie was not intended for you to—”
Sherlock feels a stab of disappointment at the remark, but instead of dropping his eyes, he goes on looking at John—recognizes the high color in his cheeks, the deep glitter in his eyes, and realizes that John is teasing him.
His heart gives a little throb as he takes up each garment and is assailed with the memories of the corresponding removal of each item. Each silk stocking causes a pleasant shiver down the backs of his thighs, the discovery of his crumpled waistcoat beside the bed bringing with it the memory of how John tried to neatly fold it, how Sherlock tore it from his hands and threw it aside. Finally, his neck cloth, coiled in a puddle by the door, sets off a reaction in Sherlock so strong at the memory of John’s lips at his throat that he has to sink down on the bed for a moment to recover himself.
Sherlock risks a glance up at her face to gage her reaction, and watches as her cheeks turn pink with pleasure.
“Let that be a lesson to all of you that I will not tolerate the neglect of duty onboard this ship. Do I make myself clear?”
He decides to postpone his quest to speak with the Lieutenant until the captain has left the quarterdeck, and Sherlock heads back toward the staircase leading below decks, careful to keep his head down all the while, and never once let his gaze stray toward the helm of the ship.
How can he face the days at sea without John in them? How can he go back to what life was like before? Thinking back on his life before John is like looking at the sketch an artist makes before a painting. The difference between that life and the one he knows now is like the difference between the monochrome of the initial sketch—everything flat and colorless, shapes and figures just faint suggestions of what is to come—and the brilliant color of the finished painting, executed in hues he didn’t even know existed.
“There’s no need to be sorry, my darling.” John reaches up a hand to push the damp curls out of Sherlock’s eyes with the backs of his fingers. “Please, please don’t be sad on my account. Please. I’m here now—it’s all right.” He offers Sherlock the shadow of a grin. “It will take a lot more than one double shift to break me, don’t you worry.”
Sherlock leans forward as far as he can, straining his eyes. He’s not close enough to make out any of the actual items, if only he could—
. This was one of John’s directives that Sherlock did not follow, and it occurs to him now that he should have known that John was right, as he always is, in matters of the body. It helped; it helped to quiet Sherlock’s overactive brain.
As a last resort, he finds himself turning to the only thing that has a chance of bringing him some comfort. Even holding it in his hands is sometimes enough to quiet the chaos in his mind.
John bends to set the bucket right ways up and then pauses, seems to notice something under the bed.
And then, as if to deliberately make matters worse, John clasps her hand between both of his and leans in to tell her quietly, “Don’t worry. Your secret is safe with me.”
John takes a long drink from the cup of wine on the desk before reaching down to pull off his shoes. When he straightens up to look at Sherlock he is grinning. He offers the cup to Sherlock who takes it and swallows down half the contents without tasting it. He’s too focused on getting John back against him again to notice trivial things like the taste of the wine. Although some distant part of his brain registers that it’s actually quite good. He can feel the effects of it, warm and pleasant, uncurling in his chest.
Everyone at luncheon looks as miserable and hot as ever, but there are more passengers present than Sherlock has seen in several days. He suspects that boredom is the sole motivating factor for driving them out of their cabins; it isn’t as though the dining room is any cooler.
Sherlock is relieved that John seems to sense just how desperate Sherlock. There is nothing teasing or hesitant about his touch. His strokes on Sherlock’s cock are generous and steady, and the direct touch feels so good after so much aroused anticipation that Sherlock cannot keep his eyes open. He lets his eyes drift shut, his open mouth still pressing into John’s.
They seem to have gotten into every crack and corner. He’s almost certain he has found them all but then horrifying visions of John slicing his foot open on an undiscovered shard makes Sherlock shove aside the case that stands at the foot of his bed just to be sure he hasn’t missed a stray fragment.
“Lieutenant Lestrade urges me to remind you that what he said earlier today still stands—all of your duties
“Well, it was pretty grisly stuff—all that.” John gestured vaguely with one hand. “It was upsetting, so I just thought—”
Lestrade shakes his head. “No. No, he made no comment other than to ask whether I had enjoyed myself at the festivities the previous evening.”
Sherlock bends forward to press an open-mouthed kiss to John’s other nipple, exhaling softly against the damp skin before looking up at John.
He must taste different now, feel different, and Sherlock is filled with an animal need to touch him, to kiss him, to learn how he tastes here, now, in this blaze of sunlight and open sky.
John laughs, and Sherlock wishes he could tuck the sound away, keep it in some hidden place so that he could have it always.
with the object of his affections. And for another, Sherlock was Sherlock, who never followed any of the conventional rules about anything. John was rapidly realizing that Sherlock had absolutely no concept of personal space, as was evidenced by almost every interaction they shared. It was impossible to ignore the flare of heat in his stomach whenever Sherlock got close to him.
“Why?” Sherlock whispers, suddenly apprehensive that someone might see them, even though he knows they are safely hidden from view by the bulk of the cannon. He cranes his head back to look up at the man on watch in the foretop, but the white curve of the foresail blocks him from Sherlock’s line of sight. They are hidden from view on all sides, shrouded by the canvas of the sails.
My heart ached at the memory. It twisted and tied itself in ugly knots within my chest. I had no right to feel so wretched, so broken. I had caused this, it was
Hello! As I said I'm posting again this week as last weeks was so short. Hope you enjoy this update and brace yourselves because it only gets more fluffy from here!
At the mention of Watson, I flinched. My heart gave an involuntary lurch and I scowled at Stamford, my own anger rising within me. He didn’t know what he was talking about, he had no
Lowering his hands slowly, he closed the lid with fingers that still trembled, before taking a ragged breath. I was watching him like a hawk, cataloging his every microexpression.
I placed my head in my hands, the panicked thoughts and justifications for my actions spinning about in my consciousness.
“I would never have thought that Holmes… I… Hmm…” He mused and I looked at him, myself now confused.
He pulled out a red leather-bound book from the bottom of one of the drawers, and brought it over to the settee where I sat.
“Oh my John… how will you ever forgive me for causing you such pain?” His voice was so strained, as if he might crack open at any moment.
I had always known it was impossible for Holmes to reciprocate my feelings, but to hear that my presence irritated him–disgusted him even–to the point of his forcing me to leave was enough to break my heart into a thousand shards.
I jerked around on the chair scanning the rest of the room frantically. I leapt up upon seeing the washbasin and poured more water from the jug before bringing the basin to the bedside. I cast about in my coat for a handkerchief and, carefully, I dipped it in the water before wringing it out and placing it upon Watson’s fevered brow. Again he stirred slightly, but did not regain consciousness. There was no fire lit in the hearth, which was probably just as well to reduce Watson’s temperature but the chill of the room seemed to intensify after dipping my handkerchief in the cold water. With one hand on the handkerchief, I let the other take up Watson’s hand again. His fingers were calloused but exquisite. How many times had I longed to feel them in my palms and kiss them? I did so now, brushing my lips across his knuckles and placing tiny kisses upon his palm. He shifted again and made a slight noise that could almost be called a whimper.
“My dear fellow, tell me what on Earth has happened?” His tone was swamped with concern, understanding and empathy, it was too much for my fragile state and tears began to prick my eyes once more. Seeing this he put a hand in his jacket and produced a hip flask, handing it to me while reaching for my hand and giving it a reassuring squeeze. “John… please, in your own time, tell me everything.”
"I'm sorry..." My voice cracked, straining to form words over the heart in my throat. My voice box was being squeezed tightly, my lungs trampled on and my mouth as dry as sandpaper. "I never... Holmes... I..." I bit down hard on my lip. What had caused this sudden change in my dearest friend? Maybe... oh
Tears sprung to my eyes as I surveyed the scene. Holmes was the smartest man I’d ever known, but in the moments he made itself known, it was his thoughtfulness that took my breath away. Before I could recover, Holmes bustled in carrying a large dish and placed it on the table. As he stepped back, I saw it was the most delicious looking pie, the crust was a perfect golden brown. It smelled heavenly. Gobsmacked, all I could do was turn to him with my mouth hanging open in utter astonishment as out he bustled again, returning with potatoes and vegetables. I was still standing there stock still, staring at him, when he finally took notice and laughed at my expression.
However, I decided to play his game. Doubtless, I would learn what he was up to sooner or later, so there was little harm in indulging the mystery while it lasted. I could find
, it was agony, Stamford. To work with him, lodge with him and feel such… emotion. Such a deep longing, knowing I could never have him, not in the way my heart wanted. I imagined him looking at me with utter repugnance, should he ever know. I couldn’t do it! I was an overwound clock, each day it became harder and harder to restrain myself from declaring the truth. So I decided to cast him from me. Then, there was still the possibility of him forgiving me, in time. I was so caught up in my own agony I didn’t even notice. Believe me, I didn’t know,
I looked down at it now, watching the hands work away. I wondered what Holmes had planned. Something was definitely afoot, but I had thought he might have forgotten about the anniversary as he had been spending long hours in his workshop doing experiments. But after all these years, I would never be so foolish as to underestimate him. He does
… However, there is not actually an English translation available… so I… thought… as I speak German… I would purchase the book and translate it for you… you... Uhm…” He coughed shyly, “Did seem utterly fascinated by his work… and...” I cut him off by kissing him so hard he gave a little grunt of surprise, before kissing me back just as passionately.
“I… I had no idea. You see I… I love him, too.” Stamford looked astonished, and I cut him off before he could say anymore. “I thought he would be horrified… I was terrified, panicked, I couldn’t be near him without yearning to touch him.” I spoke quickly now, the words tumbling out in a maladroit confession. “
I threw my clothes into the cases like a madman, hands trembling and fumbling. When I had packed every item, I realised some of my things were in the sitting room and my heart leapt. I couldn't go in there. I couldn't see him again.
