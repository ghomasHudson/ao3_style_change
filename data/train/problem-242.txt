John shrugged, “I didn’t know what you’d want, so I gave you what I’d like to have received from you.”  He looked down at the scarf and smiled, his eyes bright when he looked back up.  “It looks like you had the same idea.”
A Sequel to yesterday's fic "That's Different"
“Shall we?” He offered John his arm.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Everyone is an idiot, some are just less so than others.”  He winked at John and leaned back on his own arms so that they were at eye level.  John blushed.
John nods. “And,” he closes the gap between them, “you were dancing with me in there.” He pokes Sherlock’s forehead.  Sherlock’s face betrays his shock at being caught out.
“No thanks to me. My knowledge went right out the door when it came to my baby girl. I always knew that to be true about doctors but I never thought it’d happen to me. Thought I’d be different. Thanks for being there for me.” John squeezes Sherlock’s wrists.
So now, he stands at the base of the stairs, hoping that Sherlock will allow him to crash at the flat.  At least until he finds a place of his own or maybe reside there permanently again.  John still isn’t sure which he wants.  One thing at a time, he reminds himself.  He adjusts his backpack.  It is then he hears the muffled, quiet music wafting down the stairs.  Sherlock is playing his violin again, but it isn’t a song John’s ever heard.
Today's prompt is Deep Purple and is meant to immediately follow yesterday's 221 Plum ficlet.
“Polite company, my arse. We are no such thing.” John just grins and Diana enthusiastically makes a mess of her share of pureed pasta and sauce.
The cake was supposed to be a surprise for John.  What was he going to do now?  He stared at a bowl of strawberries and was struck with an idea.  He dashed down the stairs hoping Mrs. Hudson still had cream and some of her famous sponge cake.
Sherlock didn’t quite know what to make of John and that fascinated him.  “Um, thanks for that,” Sherlock said once they got their shoes back on and rental skates turned in.  “Do you like hot chocolate?  I’ve got some change left, I could buy you one.  Unless, you’ve got to go.”  Sherlock hoped he didn’t.  He felt like he’d made a friend and he wasn’t quite ready to let him go yet.
to be, in Mrs. Hudson’s cozy and now soundproofed flat. John is hurling angry words back at Sherlock as they climb the stairs into 221B and both of the men miss seeing Mrs. Hudson descending the stairs from the nursery.
***this begins the non sequential 221s.  It does not tie into the previous three***
“You know you do,” Sherlock replied, smirking.  John grinned in acknowledgment and pulled Sherlock in for a kiss.
Hamish squealed with joy when Santa Claus came “Ho-Ho-Ho”ing through the door of the flat.  His blue eyes lit up even brighter than normal and he actually jumped up and down in his excitement.  John beamed, happy that their son was so entranced.  But he could practically feel Sherlock’s scowl from behind him.  He was glad Hamish couldn’t see his father’s face in that moment.
“Can I pretend to be Father when I tell you?” Hamish begged.
“Apparently,” John said gently, “There really is such a thing as Christmas magic.”
“It’s in the medicine cabinet,” John says wearily. Sherlock comes back with the appropriate dosage for Diana. She takes it without any fuss and snuggles back into John’s arms.
“Yes, oh.”
“Sherlock, what are you doing?” John asked in disbelief as he entered the heavenly smelling kitchen.
John looked down at the kids and teenagers skating on the lake and smiled at the laughter that floated up at him.  The smile was tinged with a bit of sadness.  He sat, hands clasped together with his arms resting on his knees.  It was hard to believe he and Sherlock had met here twenty years ago.  He and Sherlock had known each other longer than most of the people on that lake had been alive.  It hadn’t been an easy couple of decades, but usually it was worth it.  Today, was one of those days that made him question if it was.  Another disagreement, more words flung in superior anger by Sherlock, John trying to reason with him, and Sherlock refusing to believe that he had done anything wrong.  John was tired of having the same argument, just changing the names and situations, over and over again.  He’d promised Sherlock early on in their friendship that he’d never try and change him, that he’d let Sherlock be himself.  That friendship that had blossomed into so much more than any of them had ever expected.
“Yup”
<Sherlock>: Dinner?
“I don't need help, but since you're offering so kindly, I could use an extra hand. Come on”, he makes his way back to the kitchen and hears Sherlock groan but follow him anyway, and something about having this much control over Sherlock, The stubborn, odd, high-functioning sociopath Sherlock, made him want to grin, but he suppressed it, thinking of it as silly.

John, you should have seen it! It looked like a scene from some supernatural crime novel. Had I been even a little stupid, I might have actually thought we were dealing with actual witchcraft.
“Merry Christmas, Sherlock”, he whispers, his eyes welling with warm tears as his saddened smile locks onto the grey marble. He steps closer, until it's too much and he sinks down onto the dirt, clutching the gravestone in his arms in a bone-breaking hold.

“Look, Sherlock. I may not be the world's only consulting detective but I know how humans work, okay? And, whether you like it or not, you're human too, and my best friend, so I know something's wrong and you better tell me now before I turn to different methods”
<John>: Okay, see you :)
Writing to you has become somewhat of a daily routine. It feels like keeping a diary, since no one is reading these letters anyway. Though, I do suspect Mrs Hudson reads them while I'm away. Well, it's only so much she gets out of them, declarations of boredom and case-solving. Nothing out of the ordinary.
", or something of the like. I felt as if I was a little child misbehaving, but I could never be mad at Mrs Hudson so I took out all of my anger on Mycroft and his stupid diet. Did you know he got fatter? Seriously, he can pretend all he wants but I can see that morning jogging, or lack thereof, is not doing it for him. Do tell him I said that first chance you get.

), silly, inappropriate gifts, soft violin tunes, and
“I need to think. I can't think if you're standing there trying to make small talk”, he says, raising his eyebrows just like he always does when irritated. John watched him, observed him, since Sherlock so kindly had reminded him how stupid not observing made him, and crossed his arms around his chest. His hair was messy to say the least, oily curls sticking to his slightly dump forehead, eyebrows edged, eyes icy blue and piercing but looking bored as always, cheeks hollowed in and lips tightly shut. His jaw was clenched, neck sweating, and his purple button-up shirt with the first few buttons open. With a peak inside his room, he could see it looking clean and untouched, as if Sherlock hadn't been there all day, and as predicted, the lights were all off.
“You are helping me decide what we'll have for supper”, John explains, and as soon as he sees Sherlock's mouth opening, he gives him the look again as a warning to not say a word.
And he smiles, because
John, I think I may die of boredom. It almost seems as if all the clever criminals have retired after your leave for the war. If that's the case, you better return shortly.
The case is about a woman found dead in the bathroom of her own pub in Yardley Street. Her hair was covered in blood with little injuries and her possessions and jewelery were missing. Scotland Yard is suspecting accidental homicide on theft but Lestrade wants me to take a look too. Good for him, because they are wrong as always. I haven't solved it yet but I know those idiots would rather blame it on simple, investigation-less excuses, than do their jobs properly.
“Oh, brilliant, you are not blind. Was worried there for a second”, the look of pride on John's face immediately fell. Of course, it was Sherlock Holmes we're talking about, Of course he made himself look like an idiot again. Damn him and his perfectly functioning brain and his massive intellect. “The deduction would have been to figure out why I did all of those things, John. Now, would you mind?”, he says and motions down the hallway and away from his room.
' built in red wool.
“Uhm, yes, Sherlock?”
Come home victorious.
I sure hope you put your good brain to work with this one.
“Is there anything else?”, he asks, and his voice is small, unsure, and he sounds and looks so young when he's not abusing his brain with complicated theories and solving crimes, and it makes a string inside John twitch with satisfaction that he's the only one who gets to see him like that.
, John thought. He knew and he wasn't ever going to let him live it down. “I don't know what you're talking about”, he mutters, and gulps down a big spoon of soup. Now, it only tasted like poison, scratching at his neck, choking him, and he was sure Sherlock was definitely convinced now had he not been before. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
When he enters his old flat, provided to him by the post-war fare, he sets his stuff down and collapses on the bed. A moment later, it's as if he had time-traveled, as he now found himself awake from yet another nightmare, jolted out of bed with sweat dripping down his forehead and tears mixing in further down the cheeks, eyes wide with shock. Sure, he'd gotten used to them, but why now of all times? The realisation hits him moments later, after he's brewed a kettle to calm himself down. The realisation that the fact that he was so shocked was not because of the context of the nightmare,
I do apologise for my absence. It was two days ago that I last gripped the pen and talked to you, but you have to understand I've only just finished solving this fascinating new case Gordon brought in. Do not worry your funny little brain, I'll tell you all about it.

Sherlock didn't budge, staring right at John who locked his gaze with that shit-eating patience that irritated him even more. Finally, he looked down at his sweating hands and back up at John. “It's too hot”, he mumbled, and John shook his head.
, even. Maybe he did. At this rate, it was impossible to know the difference between fake and real, wrong and right, death and life. All he knew was that, whether real or not, his best friend, the ever-knowing detective genius, was lying face down and stone cold on some dirty pavement, completely, and utterly,

“I miss you”, he cries, and the already wet grass soaks even further with a sea of his tears. He only then realises the heavy rain that had come replacing the thin snow, but he doesn't care; the ground beneath him is cold and damp and there's mud littering his freshly washed clothes, yet he still does not care. Not when he's half laying there, his beloved, or whatever had remained of him, tightly trapped in his embrace. He pulls at the cold material of the gravestone, as if that will wake Sherlock from the dead and bring him back, but it doesn't, and John is just left there, sobbing loudly and holding onto it for dear life. “

“Go on, then”, says Sherlock, a small, v-shaped smile still evident on his lips. John looks extremely guilty upon noticing it.

John double shifted at Sherlock's witty text. The sun had just set and as far as the frames of the sky went, the previous purple and orange pixels had now turned indigo and black. John knew it was dangerous out this time of the day, but he had remembered to store his
He enabled spectator mode just in time to see Sherlock vacuuming his entire inventory and EXP and killing the fantoms in his name.

It has only been about two weeks now and I already find myself in the unfortunate position of needing to consult my doctor (
Approximately twenty minutes later, he turns the stove off and serves the soup into two bowls. He puts them on the table, arranges them perfectly, and nervously calls for Sherlock. He didn't know why all of a sudden calling him down to have supper is such a big deal, and quite frankly it probably isn't, but it surely feels like it when Sherlock comes down with his hair even messier than before, panting. He looks up at him with his mouth agape, observes how his lips are chapped and parted with heavy breaths coming out of them and how his eyes sparkle, and he has to close his eyes to make sure his sanity is still resting well inside his head and not running off because of Sherlock
“Nope”
A fine Friday morning, Sherlock comes home to a John sitting on the lounge, a cup of tea in hand while the other massages his temple. He allows a smile at the sight, his flatmate's presence proving to be quite reassuring to have around. He approaches John's armchair with a grin only seeming to widen by the second.
<John>: Starving!

tests?”
<John>: I like your skin.
<Sherlock>:
. John considers calling him, and decides against it. He considers calling Lestrade and decides that that is a far worse decision. So he resorts to waiting. When nighttime comes around, he's fairly sure Sherlock has just gone out for the entire day, maybe to visit his family, or a lover. He tells himself that, he lets the reassurance wash over him at the thought of Sherlock tucked in safe spending the night at someone's place, and gets up. If Sherlock is not going to show up, he might as well leave. And he does, he takes his luggage in hand, and with one last look to his flat for a month, shuts the old door close behind him. When he ascends down the stairs, he sets the keys down on Mrs Hudson's coffee table with a frown and leaves for good.
“Where do you think you're going?”
' John, it is from now on. I might consider different terms of affection through my letters, too. How would you fancy '
“Why are you looking at me like that?”
' before '
From the corner of his eye, he can see a lean dark figure with a saddened smile and wild dark curls but when he turns his neck so fast it strains, just to check, all he's met with is the boring beige walls of Molly's living room and he sighs. He knows he's imagining things, it's borderline on impossible not to, at this point, but still deep inside, he wishes for his sick hallucinations to be real and for Sherlock to be there for him to hold his cold hand and ruffle his messy curls and kiss his rosy cheek and trap his lean torso against him. He wishes for Sherlock to be there, share a drink with him and have a laugh for God knows what reason, and maybe follow him outside and play with him in the snow, just like old times. John wishes for one last snowball fight with Sherlock, just the two of them in the world, and for one last chance to hold the madman's flaming cheeks in his hands and snog him with all his might. At the realisation that this will never happen, John curses his foolishness and cowardice to do it before it was too late. He thinks about what would have happened then and if Sherlock's end would have been prevented at all. Even though he knows it wouldn't, how could it, he still selfishly blames himself for not stirring the chance as if it could have saved him.
Last Christmas, John had spent with few of his friends in the domecity of their--

again, so Sherlock looks away without a further word. When they do make it to the kitchen, John sits on one of the chairs and Sherlock looks at him with that Sherlock smile that John feels like punching every single time. Sometimes, he wants to cherish it, take a picture and frame it, but that's rarely. No, John just mostly wants to punch it.
George just brought me a fresh case. I've only just read what it's about. It seems good enough for a couple of hours of work. By the end of the day, I'll be in desperation of another that won't come so keep in mind that I'll be bored again.
“Eat”, simply said Sherlock, and John furrowed his eyebrows, heel of his foot tapping irritatingly against the floor. “Stop doing that. It's distracting”
“So what is it, John? Come on, spit it out. Or don't,
“If it's your trademark then what do you need help with?”
“Sorry, mind palace. And no”, he says, and turns on his heel to bolt up to his room for the rest of the night and possibly the next day, and the day after that, and maybe even the rest of the week, if John did not force him out. He stops for a brief moment, turning his head to the side slightly, but not daring to look at John in the eye. “Since the day I met you”, he says softly, and runs upstairs. John almost misses the sound of Sherlock banging his door shut over his obnoxious thoughts. He could not comprehend the fact that he had managed to humanise Sherlock Holmes in what little short period of time he was in his life. It sparked an oddly satisfying wave of pleasure inside John that he could not explain. Maybe it was self-centered pride, maybe admiration, maybe something more than that. Whichever it was, John had decided, he would not dream of less. A small smile tugs at his lips at the thought, then turns into a toothy grin when he notices the CD Mary had left to Sherlock in case the worst happened to her. He recalled her message, and though the reminder of her death made him sad, he knew deep inside that she was right. Ms. Hudson, too.
“Also,” he said huskily, “Less idiots are generally better kissers.”
“Well you always do when you want to get your way,” Hamish pouted a bit, “And I wanted to see Santa.  Uncle Mycroft in a Santa Costume was even better!”  He grinned again at his parents.
“I don’t know what I want to do,” Sherlock shrugged, “I’m taking Chemistry courses, but my professors are all idiots.”
And then John surprised him again, “Don’t worry, I know you know.  You’re too smart not to have figured that one out.”  He bumped his knee against Sherlock, “Why do you think I’m here, living with the party animal instead of there?”
“You know,” John said to the boy he knew was just as stubborn as he was, “you’re supposed to tell me your name now.  And you didn’t ask me for help, so I’m not helping you.”  He grinned at the shocked look in the ice blue eyes that stared back at him.  “So, let’s try this again.  Hi, I’m John.”  He held out his mittened hand in greeting.
So, John rolled up his sleeves and asked, “What can I do?”
As a child he’d been captivated by the magical display.  The flame-bright orb casting its final rays of the day.  A prism of colors as night began to fall.  Twilight hues of pinks, purples, and blues.  The waves crashing in like amethyst jewels.  Dusky pink petal clouds scudding across the horizon.  Cliffs, stark, stone monoliths during the day turn into smooth, deep blue sentinels as the sun set.  The night rolling in behind him cool and calm.
“I’m Sherlock.”  Sherlock suppressed a smile at the look on John’s face as he walked by, and out the door.
The next time they were called to a crime scene there was some confusion, followed by smug smiles as John appeared wearing Sherlock’s scarf and Sherlock had John’s dog tags on display for everyone to see and John humming  “
“Give me a moment, I’m admiring the gift wrap,” John replied, his own voice seductive.  He smiled as Sherlock shivered, and gave himself a full minute to enjoy the sight.
“John! John!” Sherlock shouted from the bathroom. “Come here immediately! It’s an emergency!”
Sherlock heaved a sigh.  “For a doctor, you’re surprisingly obtuse sometimes.”
Revelation number two:  Maybe there was more to him leaving Mary than just the never-ending fights.  Maybe some of the unwelcome jabs she took at him had some weight.  Because he feels more, in this moment, for Sherlock Holmes than he does anyone else, except for Diana.  He is drawn to this tall man, waltzing alone in his flat, to a song that he had written about the two of them.  He finds himself wanting to dance with Sherlock.  He suddenly wants to hold him, find out what it feels like to dance with him when it wasn’t just practice, wrap him in his arms and keep the world at bay.  Because looking at Sherlock now, with his masks down, eyes closed, obviously imagining himself dancing with John, this was a Sherlock who no one ever saw and was hurting, was lonely, was different, who wouldn’t allow anyone to see him this way.  And in that moment, John decides that Sherlock shouldn’t have to feel like he has to keep his masks up always.  If there was one person he should be able to let his masks down around, it is John.
down on his side of the table. “I don’t know, John, they have just about everything.”
“But that doesn’t change my point, Sherlock. They’re your parents, you should pick out their wreath.”
The morning snow was falling lightly on Baker Street as John opened his eyes a sliver and visually processed his surroundings. Not half a second passed by before his husband snaked an arm around his middle and hugged him close. John grinned and snuggled closer to the detective. What a beautiful Christmas Eve morning.
John smiled, appearing to completely ignore his own arousal.  “A ploy to get you to wake up. Did I succeed?”
Sherlock shook his head and made his way over to his clothes drawers, led by his triumphantly erect-again member. John suppressed a laugh, loving seeing the usually dominant, forceful, and arrogant detective so vulnerable to him. It was worth ignoring his own budding cock just to tease him like that
Sherlock nodded curtly, nervously side-eyeing his husband. John noticed and grinned. “You’re thinking about White Winter Berries, aren’t you.”
John nodded. “You’ve done your homework, detective Holmes.”
John scoffed, still entertained by his husbands social quirks. “All right, I’ll bite. What did you tell her and how do you know it’s right?”
“Well, he has a dog and two cats. The dog is his best friend and the cats are relatively new and don’t quite like him yet gathering by the barely healed cat scratches on his arms. Usually when a dog man gets cats it’s because of a woman or girlfriend living with him, so one day I kept tabs on his breaktime habits.”
John handed him his clothes with an unyielding look on his face. “You’ll have to wait.”
Sherlock grumbled as John stroked his husbands hair. “Sherlock, we need to finish Christmas shopping before we go over to your parents’ place for Christmas dinner tomorrow.”
Sherlock stopped moving and John recognized the look on his face as his bullshit-devising look. Sherlock was going to try and get out of making a domestic decision, especially one regarding his family, no matter what.
Johns eyebrows raised in surprise. “I didn’t know you talked to him much. I knew you’ve been in a lot, but you’re not one for small talk, my dear.”
John, now fully clothed, strode over to Sherlock, fully aware of what he wanted and fully prepared to keep it from him. “Yes, Sherlock?”
“Sherlock” he whispered with a smile, trying to coax his husband awake. “It’s Christmas Eve morning, Sherlock. I don’t have work and you don’t have a case.”
“Eachother,” Sherlock said bluntly.
“Certainly this was a more niche study, what with it being Christmas and all.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, John. I bought a cup of coffee and sat at one of the tables and read. There’s a fascinating set of articles out on the importance of a specific type of urban bees and their pollination habits.” He could sense his husband looking at him like he wasn’t quite telling the entire truth. Sherlock sighed. “And yes, I bought a croissant.”
“But you do, Sherlock. You did that study on English winter foliage and their tensile strengths.”
“We’re never going to get these damned gifts, are we?” Sherlock looked into his husbands eyes, trying to read him and hoping against hope that he’d be taken to the bedroom and all of these clothes on him would be thrown across the room.
John was kissing a line down Sherlock’s body, and his lips had just reached the spot below his bellybutton. He smiled, ever thankful that his husband slept in the nude. He lightly palmed Sherlock’s erection and received a low huff of arousal in return. John beamed. He had Sherlock exactly where he wanted him.
Now, they were battling Sherlock’s boredom, something that he’d previously used drugs to get rid of. Now he used sleep which medically was better, but John was still investigating better alternatives.
“You like it when I’m spontaneous, dear.” He got close to his husband and whispered in his ear, trailing his fingers down Sherlock’s alabaster torso. “And I like to be in control just as much as you do.”
“This is the first Christmas we’re spending together as a married couple, Sherlock, should we give them an ornament or something?” He bit into his strawberry jam covered breakfast. “Doubtful that their other son is going to get married anytime soon.”
Sherlock hissed as he pulled his pants on over his raging erection. “Damnit, John.”
Sherlock opened his eyes and locked gaze with his husband. “I didn’t.”
Once their clothes were on, they made their way downstairs, despite Sherlock’s grumbling about his blue balls. They had a routine for every common morning, and this day (a day they both had free) wasn’t any different.
How is it up there? I hope you spend Christmas somewhere warm with friends. Don't miss my melodies too much, will you?

“Hey, Sherlock!”, he calls. “Will you wash the dishes?”
”, and Ms. Hudson was also right. Who would he have if it wasn't for Sherlock? As much as he did not want to admit it, had it not been Sherlock, he wouldn't have had such amazing life experiences through their adventures, he wouldn't have met Mary or had Rosie, but most importantly, he wouldn't have his best friend. His companion through life. He would be lost and in depth without him, maybe he'd have wound up dead, too. Maybe he would have been another victim passing by Sherlock Holmes every day. One of his many cases. No, he thought, he couldn't have done this without him. The one person that John both hated and loved the most; Sherlock bloody Holmes.
David Howard and Arthur Allerton, two college students, were found bound and gagged inside their shared apartment, which had been sprayed with accelerant and put on fire by their killer. The remainings of their bodies showed deep wounds all over the burnt skin, with more than two hundred stabs found on each man. The forensics team said the stabbing were prior to the fire, which indicates strong motives for the double murder since it would take a considerable amount of time and effort to torture the two of them to death. While there were no leads as to who could have done it, I managed to trace the murder's footprints through the pool of blood on the floor. Turns out, the murderer was Howard's ex-boyfriend, who very falsely believed the two flatmates were together. Predictable, really. Love really is a vicious criminal motive.
“Language, John, language!” Sherlock tsks at him with a gleam in his eye, “She’s going to be talking any day now. Do you really want her first word to be one you wouldn’t utter in polite company?”
John just shakes his head, walking into the kitchen and taking the tongs to remove the flask, setting it on the hot pad to cool. He turns back to ask Sherlock if there’s anything else he needs from him, only to find another one of his favorite scenes, Sherlock sleeping soundly with his arms wrapped protectively around Diana. The first time he’d seen that John had been terrified Diana might roll out of his arms, but the minute she began to wiggle in her sleep, Sherlock had instinctively adjusted his arms to her movement so that she stayed comfortable and safe in her sleep. Diana had never slept as well in her crib the short time he and Mary had stayed together after she had been born as she does when she falls asleep in Sherlock’s arms and the bedtime transfers to the new crib in John’s old room are much smoother. John smiles and turns his attention back to the groceries and kitchen. Someone has to take care of keeping the food from spoiling and cleaning the disaster Sherlock left if they’re going to have anything decent for dinner.
John did his best not to give Sherlock an “I-told-you-so” look as Sherlock knelt there, his mouth agape. “How did you know it was Uncle Mycroft?” John asked.
Sherlock didn’t like to sleep much, but this, this he loved and would make sure to take the time to enjoy it when he could.  Sentiment be damned.
John smiled at him.  “Now how about we show those kids down there how a couple of old pros go about falling on the ice?”
“Ohhh!” John smiled as he realized what Sherlock meant.  He walked up to Sherlock and pulled something out of the pocket of Sherlock’s dressing gown.
Hamish sighed in frustration at his parents and ran off upstairs to his room. He came back down with an album the perfect size for a child.  Inside were various pictures from Mycroft and Sherlock’s childhood.  Pictures of Mycroft reading to Sherlock, Sherlock covering a sleeping Mycroft with his favorite blanket, Mycroft playing a game of hide and seek with Sherlock, on and on.  Sherlock turned and looked at John, disbelief evident on his face.
“Now, tell Santa about the gifts you want, that you
forgetful.”
“Well, leftover in terms of cookies, but not other experiments,” Sherlock looked at him impishly.
“Oh really? What makes a person, “less of an idiot” than others?”   John grinned, his smile bright against the dark.
“You’re very precise in your experiments, Sherlock,” John looked at him curiously, “It's not like you to have leftover chocolate.”
“Well,” Santa struggled to find an appropriate response, “Well, Hamish, that will be up to you.  After all, some Christmas magic can only happen because of children.”  He sounded a bit choked up as he leaned into give the small boy a hug goodbye, “You know don’t you,” he whispered into Hamish’s ear.  Hamish gave a slight nod.  “Thank you,” said Santa, “Ho ho ho!  Happy Christmas all!” he exclaimed as he headed out the door after placing a few gifts under the tree.
Some nights their coupling is frantic and wanton, quick moments stolen before the light of day can lay claim on them.  Tonight John takes his time, tracing each tiny drop, following its path with his tongue.  Down and over Sherlock’s bare chest, flicking the taut nipple as he goes, catching up with another rivulet and following it to the nest of dark curls below Sherlock’s waist.  His lips ghost over them and he leans back admiring the way the rain falls, glistening and creating new paths for him to follow down Sherlock’s hard cock.  The cool, crispness of the water contrasts perfectly with the heat and taste of Sherlock’s skin as John’s tongue follows each drop down the shaft, waiting patiently for the plea he knew was coming.
John opened up the refrigerator and blinked.  He’d become accustomed to finding various body parts, rank experiments, even the odd amphibian in stasis.  He was not accustomed to actually finding fridge that contained nothing but food items.  But that wasn’t the most shocking thing.  Everything in it was either orange or green.
When John got home, he was greeted with the most delicious looking strawberry shortcake he’d ever seen, a single candle lit on it.
“Watch me. Don’t break eye contact,” John said before he slowly sucked down the full length of Sherlock’s cock.  Sherlock gasped and fought not to close his eyes, but kept them locked with John’s.
For Teaforthaila on tumblr, who's prompt was Orange.
“Is there anoth-?” Sherlock’s question dropped as John shook his head.
“Babies sleep better with human contact and hearing a heartbeat. It reminds them of being in utero. Besides, I’m not complaining. But you will be if she wakes up. So kindly, remove that flask from the flame before it combusts.” Sherlock retorts, equally quiet.
Sherlock ducked behind the bushes, doing his best to step in the footprints already in the snow.  Mycroft had insisted they take an outing to the park for “the purpose of observation” but Sherlock was more interested in getting away from his older brother.  It was a game to him, to see how long it would take Mycroft to find him among the other children playing and shrieking in the park.  Mycroft, for some reason, always thought he would be hiding in trees, the gazebos, or bushes.  You’d have thought Mycroft would know by now to look in plain sight.  Sherlock decided that today he’d head to the lake, he’d always wanted to try ice skating.  More specifically, he’d wanted to try and figure out how frozen water could hold so many people on it without it breaking.  He pulled out the blue hat and scarf he’d borrowed from one of the boys whose mother worked in the city house, and put them on.  He tucked his dark curls in the stocking cap and wrapped the scarf around his mouth and nose in an effort to hide his face.  He then made his way down to the lake.
“That is the most ludicrous excuse for a tub I have ever seen!”
“Happy Christmas.”
“Really?” John waves an arm in the direction of the stove top. “I’m making dinner right now. If I stop to change her nappy the sauce will burn. Plus it’s unsanitary!”
The lights are all off in the flat except for the twinkling of the fairy lights and lights on the tree that they had decorated the flat with for Christmas. It’s still early but as he stands in the middle of the living room he realizes he had forgotten what the date had changed over into in all the fuss. Sherlock walks up behind him, wrapping his arms around John’s waist and rests his chin on John’s shoulder. John rests his hands over Sherlock’s closed ones and heaves a heavy sigh, “Well that was a lovely Christmas present.”
They tried. They really did. Both John and Sherlock agreed to not fight in front of Diana. Raised voices, anger, and the occasional projectile -- whether kicked or thrown -- fell severely in the “bit not good” category. Most days they succeeded and even when they didn’t one of them noticed her quick enough to utter a quick “Diana’s listening” and John or Sherlock would go to comfort her while the other took a walk to calm down. It usually helped them come back to the “discussion” after she had gone to bed or to visit Mrs. Hudson in a much better frame of mind. Who knew a baby would help them better express themselves?
The next day, and the day after that, and every single day leading up to the sad present, there wasn't one time that John had smiled genuinely. No, after the brightest grins and longest, most hearty laughs that Sherlock had gifted him in the span of those beautiful, bitter two years, there was nothing just merely as beautiful or funny or smart as the man he had lost forever. No one could compete with him, and if anyone even
He sighed at the lack of response from his flatmate. He had locked himself in his room again, and if John was to guess, he'd say that he hadn't opened the lights at all, or eaten anything all day, or communicated with anyone in any way. He himself was sat on the living room, browsing through their emails to check for potential cases and spend his time so as not to feel bored (
When he feels his lungs squeeze and his breaths can only come ragged, he excuses himself and leaves the place with steps heavier than hard rocks. He dashes out onto the busy streets of London and runs until his knees almost give out as he reaches his destination. And with slow, tentative steps towards it, he comes to a halt.
But that wasn't just it; he knew Sherlock loved the snow. He'd always denied it, said it was just ordinary bulky water, that it was common, basic, that it didn't excite him. But John knew so much better, oh, John knew so so much better, because he always saw -- always noticed the glint of bliss in the mad genius's icy blue orbs whenever small flakes danced around the London sky, or the tiny, breathy giggle of delight at the feel of cold whiteness against his black dress shoes as he walked around Central London, audible to only those who dared to listen for it. But, nevertheless, no matter how hard John pressed, Sherlock would always deny it, for some odd reason. And after specs of fluffy ice tinted the windowsills, all John could do was smile fondly at him and drag him outside anyway, despite his protests. Sherlock would proceed putting up his facade until John squashed a snowball onto his long, heavy coat, and then he'd fake an overdramatic gasp, and that would be it -- John would fall into an endless pit of laughter, and the detective would prepare a remarkably bigger snowball aimed his away as he did the same. Whenever they'd finished their little break, usually hours later, Sherlock would be out of breath, with chapped pink lips and a beautiful flush across his cheeks and nose, curls ruffled and crazy with white spots covering most of their maroon mess. It truly was unbelievable, and impossibly endearing, how a good snowball fight could reduce the stone-cold detective to a flushed giggling child. John loved the sight more than he ever admitted he did.

On rather happier notes, Gerard came by earlier and dropped off a small stack. I was so excited to tell you about Mrs Hudson's lecture that I haven't checked it yet so I better get to it. Do take care where you are, I would prefer you returned with a blood-pumping pulse.

, he would in fact figure him out like he always did. He allows himself a bittersweet smile at the thought.
John proceeds with carrying both their bowls to the sink and cleans them up, noticing how Sherlock was fidgeting with his fingers at the exact spot he last saw him. He peers at him for a short while, trying to figure him out, but to no avail. “Tea?”, he asks, snapping him out of his trace. Sherlock flinches and blinks at him twice.

John scoffed. “Oh, I'm distracting you, am I”, he muttered, not interested in picking a fight at this hour. “Sherlock, have you eaten anything today?”, he asks instead, knowing fully well the answer but still feeling the need to express his concern. He can hear something shuffling from the inside, and after a few moments it stops, as if it never happened.
<Sherlock>:
Today Mrs Hudson finally admitted to snooping around my things and reading the letters. It wasn't much of a surprise since I already knew but there was something she said that intrigued me. She said that going through some of them, she found it quite odd that I addressed them only by your name. When I asked her to elaborate on that, she laughed and explained that '
“John, you're an idiot. You need to stop with the deductions, clearly you're not made for them”

From the dark corners where the bushes trim, there's a soft crinkling of leaves but John pays it no mind. It's possible that John hasn't even heard it over the pained sounds he's making himself. But it's there, always there, unseen but there. Through thick and thin (

. A final lock of his beautiful grey blues with his own and then nothing. Just pure nothingness. Just a body, pliant and dead, pale silky skin littered with dark blood and icy blues now lifeless and gone. His wrist held no pulse, his dark curls planted on a head with a non-functioning brain inside. John had looked at him and his own heart had stopped. His eyes were wide and his hands flied everywhere, trying to get a hold of him, anything that's him, even a cold, lifeless finger, and after a tight grip of his left hand he was dragged back and away from the man he so dearly loved. The man who had saved him. The man who was now rotting away in the sharp clean morgue of St. Bart's. He felt like screaming. He wanted to scream.
, no one elses. That was just the way it was and nothing or no one could change that. It was simple, he recalled, but so heart-warming, with Sherlock playing his violin oh-so-perfectly, as he always was, right next to the overly-decorated fireplace, and with Sherlock making the whole room awkwardly stare within each other, because of his deductions, those damn, correct,
I have decided not to sign the dates on each of these. If you asked me why, I would most probably say I do not know. Since you won't be reading these, I might as well tell you that that is a lie. I don't want to keep track because I don't want to be reminded of the endless supply of letters that I will definitely have written until you finally come back. Inside my head, despite me knowing the truth, I still like to think that you'll be back soon. Until then...
I can only imagine how dull it is there, without me. Who solves the cases in the war? I bet it takes Scotland Yard days to get them wrong. This is precisely why I decided to give you the chance to solve the case yourself, to keep your mind warm. Here it is:

Instead he runs, as fast as he can, crossing the road carelessly, the drivers' and pedestrians' screams of horror as he's almost hit by a bus muffled from the volume of his mind deleting John Watson from its hard drive. Except he can't, he can't delete John Watson no matter how hard he tries. John is like a virus, stuck in his mind and contaminating it with thoughts and daydreams about situations that would never happen, because John is about to leave and nothing is stopping him. Sherlock runs a little faster when his mind corrects him, telling him that John is not a virus, but rather a lifeline, his salvation, there to clear his mind off toxic thoughts and harmful intentions. He almost stumbles when it tells him that he needs John Watson to keep him right, or else he'll fall into a dark venomous pit with no way to climb out of.
“Just, whatever you do, do not open the freezer!”, he hears him call then, and out of pure curiosity moves to do exactly what he was told not to do. He opens the freezer, only to see--
, don't say anything, I have to figure it out myself”
“Of course, yeah, everything alright, soup is great”, he quickly says and gulps more of it down. His sweating gets even worse then, and he finds himself mingling with the buttons of his shirt, eager to open even more of them up in order to cool down. John observes how his smooth pale chest is glistening with sweat, how droplets dribble down from it and disappear under the the fabric that covers the lower part of his stomach, and John wishes he could follow it with his eyes even further down, or better, wishes Sherlock would just abandon the shirt and sit there shirtless, like an invitation, a promise. John wishes Sherlock was a promise he could keep.

”, John agrees, and he doesn't understand why he does that, not when all he wants is to stop Sherlock from leaving in an attempt to hold himself back from leaving, too, but he does anyway. He forces a fake smile with a hard swallow of the bulk in his throat and holds his gaze steady against Sherlock's piercing icy blues. “I'll be packed and out of here before you're back, don't wanna bother you any longer.”
“Wow, wow, wow,
! I thought you said you'd stop with the random body parts in the fridge!”
. He shrugs the thoughts off, deciding that he'd better prepare the soup.

However, I do hope you're less miserable than me up there. Don't think of home too much or you might get a bullet though your head.
“To my room”, he simply says and marches up the stairs.

“Is this necessary?”, he asks with a sigh, and John gives him a look that says Shut up, Sherlock. “Where are you taking me?”
“I'm sorry?”
. Why keep eating it if it bothers you?”, John smiles, features soft and hand extended towards Sherlock's bowl. He takes a good look at him, and he thinks--
“Alright, what's going on”, he asks, but it comes out more like a statement than anything. Like a request, he thought, a demand. That's it,
Do not worry, I am not ill.
“Really?”

John's throat fills with spikes at the thought.
With a bit of research, I also found that said ex-boyfriend was dumped by Howard because of his extreme jealousy towards all of Howard's acquaintances, regardless of whether they were of romantic approach or not. The murderer was identified to be 23-year-old Jack Thorton, who, in fact, has a whole criminal background all to himself, masked by obvious schizophrenic behaviour. I'm afraid a prison cell awaits him, and this time, there's no getting out of it.
But he doesn't.
Gabrel came rushing to 221B today to show me one of the most interesting cases I've ever encountered. The body of a little boy was found lying on the wooden floor of some abandoned workshop near Brixton. The forensics team said he was about five to seven years old and was only recently reported missing. All around it where smeared glittery liquids and ground herbs, and,  you won't believe this, right around the boy's damaged head, was a messy circle of blood-drawn pentagrams.
<John>: Omg Sherlock u crackhead!!!

“Sherlock?”, but he received no response, so he spoke up again. “Are you planning on staying there for the rest of the day?”, again, no response. He sighed as he imagined what Sherlock would be thinking,
I know I said I won't sign the dates but Christmas is soon and Lestrade just invited me to spend New Year's with him. He said Molly and Mrs Hudson will be there. Anderson and Sally too, he didn't say but I know they'll be there. All the more reason not to go. If you're not spending the holidays here at home, I won't either.
It's Sherlock's turn to be startled then. “
“What was that?”
In all honesty, I've been bored. And I do not know why I'd need to swear my honesty when saying this, since I'm sure you know me so much so as to believe me. Cases have never been more dull, John. I think I can feel my brain vaporise.

. He may not have deducted it from his appearance or the very specific way he combs his hair or blows his nose, but he knows him long enough to understand that he is treating himself poorly and needs help in doing so. “I reckon soup”, he says, knowing fully well that Sherlock wasn't going to suggest anything, no matter how hard he tried.
He sits down himself and smiles at Sherlock for a brief moment, before picking his own spoon up and testing his creation. It seemed fine for him, it was warm, salty and strong, just how John makes it, and even though it's not Sherlock's favorite, he still doesn't mind it. He thinks, he can't possibly mind if John is the one to have made it, especially if it was intended for him. A couple of minutes and a few spoons later, John looks over at Sherlock only to see him sweating alarmingly lot, shirt clinging tighter to his chest and curls glued on his forehead.
Sherlock raised his left eyebrow at that, challenging him. “Different methods, as in?”
<Sherlock>: So this is Angelo's
Even though John was planning to go straight home and finish his redstone-powered elevator, he found he could never
John looks out the foggy window of Molly's little home. It's dark outside, but despite the clock striking close to 12, the dark clouds of the night are still visible. It had rained before, for hours on end it had seemed, and John had just watched, watched as the sky cried raindrops until his own cheeks strained with drained tears and he had to close his eyes and force them away in order to stop their flow. By now, he was already used to this. It had rained so much this year in London, as if the weather was grieving with him over the loss of a great man. There was no sunshine, no clear skies, no warmth. Just the dead cold of winter, the pooling rain and occasionally, the heavy snow. There was not one day that John looked outside and there were warm hues and calm and peace. But then again, that was London for you. All rain and snow and damp pavements and frosted windows. It was always cool blues and greys and blacks, loss and grief. And it was all the same now of all days; Christmas, the most beautiful holiday of all and John's personal favourite. Or, at least, what used to be his favourite, before the recent events of the so-called Reichenbach Fall.
“Kitchen”, only replies John and Sherlock makes a sound.
“You were a doctor”
Terms of endearment have proved greatly endearing, indeed. I confess to taking a slight liking to them. Make sure to think up as many as you can while you're away.
“What do I need to do?”, Sherlock reluctantly asks, and the spark of amusement in John's eyes makes him regret being pulled down there for the absolutely useless reason of
Holmes. He clears his throat and gestures at the table, and Sherlock immediately occupies the seat John wanted for himself, but he doesn't mind. No, with Sherlock sitting there, eyeing the food he'd prepared and scooping some of it up with his spoon, he can't possibly mind.
“Please come home. Please come back to me.”, he finally says, and the depression of it all, and the endless tears, and the alcohol burning in his vains, it's finally all too much and he eventually passes out on the frost of the cemetery. There's another brushing of leaves somewhere near but it goes unnoticed once more. So when a tall figure approaches, when there's a shuffling and then there's a long, warm coat draped over John in a protective manner, the army doctor is once again, completely oblivious.
He tries not to think about how John is still in 221B right this moment, that he still hasn't packed, that he still hasn't burst their little bubble of flat-sharing and crime-solving, except he had. The moment he announced his moving out, Sherlock decided he hated him and wanted him out of the house so he could go back to living alone in the flat and doing whatever the fuck he wanted in it. He tries not to think about how easy it would be to turn around and run back to Baker Street, tell John what an influence he's had on him in just the span of a month, beg him to stay, make Mycroft pay him to stay,
I keep finding myself writing these funny little things at the oddest hours. I usually do it when it's too late to play the violin or when I'm feeling particularly bored. It has come to be some form of entertainment, I suppose. And I do have to confess that addressing these to you make me feel like you are closer to 221B than you actually are. It's like talking to my skull, or the cold spot of your chair, or that silly balloon you left for me, but less idiotic and much more sentimental. I should probably reconsider.
“Do not forget, Sherlock, I served in the military. I know how to name every single bone of your body while breaking them”

“You better be” -- like he doesn't care, like he could do without a flatmate and partner in crime, like what they had for a month now meant nothing. Sherlock supposes it didn't seeing as John is leaving.
“I, uh, actually wanted to talk to you about something”
, Sherlock, I miss you. I miss you

Sherlock lets his gaze linger a little longer than should have, but nods anyway, turning back to his soup. A few gulps later, he starts sweating dangerously again, and John's eyes narrow as he sets his spoon down on the wooden table.

). There were times when he thought the famous detective might actually be a phantom of sorts. All these impossible deductions, the genius epiphanies, all seems almost too good to be true. These times, were almost every night this year.
Did you figure it out yourself? I'd like to know what you thought. Make sure to tell me when you get back.
“-- come on, we have a crime scene to investigate!”
Sherlock nodded and turned around, making his way back to his room. John quickly stood up and went after him.
, a chair put there for him and him only, and now it will be there for no one, or maybe it won't be there at all. Maybe Sherlock will get rid of it so he doesn't have to be reminded of him every time he enters the lounge -- and waits. He waits and waits, minutes, hours pass by, and Sherlock is still not back to 221B and he's getting fairly worried. What if Sherlock's had an accident? What if he's in danger? John knows he shouldn't care but damn him, he does. He cares for this peculiar curly-haired mad detective of a roomate.
“Very interesting choice of place, I must admit”, and cue

Sherlock sighs and stands up. “You wanted me to eat. I did not want to hurt your feelings”
. The flat was filled with all sorts of people; shy and awkward Molly Hooper, amazing-as-always Mrs Hudson, tired but thankful Lestrade, quite-frankly-annoying Jane or whatever-her-name-was that was John's girlfriend at the time, cliché-loving John, and then there was Sherlock, most important Sherlock, beautiful, beautiful Sherlock, sulky, witty Sherlock, soft and

, always on his way. “No, I--- I get it, you think I'm too weird, you want to live a normal civilian life without having to watch over me and my peculiarities. I get it.”
<Sherlock>: We'll name it Redbeard
Plenty of them, including Mrs Hudson, Lestrade and Molly, had come up to him to say hello and have a friendly chat. The only response they ever got was a tight-lipped, forced smile and a promise that he's okay and they were off to celebrate carelessly once again. John had picked up a cup of gin from the kitchen, had downed it in one go, had swallowed thoughts of Sherlock down with another, and was now sporting his third of the night with his back to the party and his front facing the snow-painted window. This way, it was easier to let his emotions overwhelm him into tears, without being noticed. He supposed the gin was also a great hiding place for the salty droplets falling from his tired eyes. No one but him could tell, as he would be able to taste them on the strong alcohol and distinguish them. He wonders if Sherlock would be able to tell and settles with the thought that
, he'd say. Thinking about it, however, he figured the peculiar detective had most probably occupied his mind with some kind of case or conspiracy theory  instead, and would not have space in his memory palace for a proper response to give to John. Knowing well enough he wasn't to respond any time soon, he knocked again.
I've decided to keep John away for the war for an entire year in this fic, so obviously Sherlock's letters will be a lot. For this reason, not all of them will be posted individually for now, and skipped letters will most probably appear later on in the story.
. He was demanding Sherlock Holmes of answers. John did not know whether he should feel proud of his braveness or disappointed of his stupidity. After all, braveness was the perfect nice word to describe stupidity, as Mycroft so kindly had reminded him when he first met Sherlock years ago.
, little flat at 221B Baker Street, he had to remind himself.
<Sherlock>: Enjoying your food?
John had only agreed to come to Molly's to celebrate because he didn't want to see another disappointed look on any of his friends' faces. He was so sick and tired of those, their pity, and even though they were all Sherlock's friends too, John knew they were somewhat over it already. They'd celebrated like nothing was wrong and John felt his empty stomach clench at their insincerity.

So, '
“Well, first of all, grab a pot, fill approximately three fourths of it with water and put it on the stove”, John instructs. “Then you can turn up the heat to full”
It's been a month but still no interesting cases. Lestrade brings in small ones once in a while, a burglary, a kidnapping, an over-dramatic death from an overly ambitious amateur. There is nothing to keep me on my feet, so I don't get up at all. I think I've been eating a few meals the week due to the lack of need to use my brain intricately. It was oddly alright at first but now I'm as bored as I'll ever be. I've also been playing the violin a lot, composing at the weirdest of hours, as Mrs Hudson suggests. I don't understand why she'd say that, I usually play before the sun comes up.
“Sherlock!”, John called. “Sherlock!”
loudly. About me, specifically”, he explains, eyebrows raised and gaze piercing against John's own. The blond felt shivers run down his entire body at that, terrified that Sherlock was disapproving of his idiotic, Sherlock-induced thoughts, when he spoke up again. “Something is bothering you. Is it me? Of course it's me, the way you've been looking at me since I stepped foot out of my cave--”
John maneuvered his block-head to look at the square beige building in the middle of the woods. At the very top stood '
