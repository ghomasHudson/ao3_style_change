The doctor nodded and offered to walk Dean out to the front. Dean accepted and they talked amicably about nothing in particular, exchanged a few comments about Summer and how she would be alright in the hospital, and the doctor ended the conversation with his personal promise that he would make sure Dean’s baby girl really would be alright before leaving Dean at the front entrance.
“Back then he was in the early stages of ‘turning feral’. Which was the term given to him by one of the kinder foster parents we stayed with. Of course, that was just their way of saying that Dean had ‘too much Street’ in him to live in a ‘proper home with normal people’. Others weren’t so kind, calling him an animal that could and would never be tamed. He’s been called a Waste Of Space, Good for Nothing and even some vile names that I’m not going to repeat. He’s endured a lot of shit. Took the worst of the abuse, the harshest of the beatings.” Sam told them at one point, trying to make them all understand that Dean had truly suffered quite a lot to make him the way he was.
Finally, Cass heaved a deep sigh and nodded, accepting another kiss from his husband before turning to hug and say goodnight to his daughter. She smiled at him comfortingly and he left the room with Dean, who was talking on the phone, ordering Cass the Uber he mentioned.
“We have to go. And so does he. The bell is about to go, and with his limited speed on those crutches, if he doesn’t go now, he’s going to be late to class.”
And, just like that, as if reading his mind, Bobby did say something… but not what Dean, or even Sam, had been expecting.
"Anyway. Oh, here, I almost forgot, my wife told me to give you this for your little girl." He said, handing Castiel a small stuffed bear with a fire fighter's jacket on. "To remind her that we all have her back. Family doesn't end in blood, right?"
On the street, you learn quickly; sleep with one eye open, back to the wall, and always be prepared to defend what little scraps you can scrape together. They’d earned their reputation, him and Sam, both. That to mess with one Winchester, you messed with both of them. They talk big and they back up their talk with a well-stocked arsenal of weapons, which they carry with them in the car; blades, guns, even bats.
Sam merely shook his head. Dean still wasn’t used to having a fridge full of food and the habit of eating as much as he could while he could was set deep into his psyche.
Cas nodded and followed his brother back up the stairs. Dean tracked him with his eyes glued to Castiel’s ass.
“Now, I’m willing to go easy on you, since I assume that you are unaware of what happened to the last guy who picked on Castiel. But I did say that I would protect him like I protect my brother. And the last time I had to act to protect Sam, the other guy did not survive his injuries. Nod if you understand me.”
Dean’s eyes narrowed, about to let rip with an angry tirade, until he realised Castiel was teasing him. He growled softly and leaned down to snatch the lawyer’s mouth with his. Their tongues battled for dominance inside of Castiel’s mouth, though Dean won, obviously.
And with that indecipherable jumble of random words, Jo turned to Gabriel to translate his brother’s verbal up-chuck.
When they got Cass out the door Dean was leaning against the hood of the car with his ankles crossed in front of him and his hands tucked into the pockets of his jeans. He didn’t move to help them, and he didn’t open the door for them either. He was stewing. Sam could tell.
And if Summer hadn’t decided to wake up at that moment he probably wouldn’t have realised until Dean had come back, that the food run had been intended for Castiel.
“Ah, to tell them why we’re going to be late home? Or maybe just to tell them that Castiel is in the hospital?”
“Hmm, I’m gonna need a bigger mouth.” He muttered before snickering to himself. “Yo! Sammy, you hungry?” he yelled out.
“No, it was basketball. She was having a fit about the boys on the team not letting her play. For some reason she didn’t like it when I told her that I would happily break some noses.”
“Mum fainted. And Dad blew a fuse. I swear I saw it explode in his head.” Gabe went on, either ignoring or not noticing Sam’s lack of interest. Just because Sam was crushing on this guy, didn’t mean he wanted to hear about his homophobic parents. He’d had to deal with that shit his whole life he did not want to deal with it any more.
But Charlie’s interest was piqued and she pushed her way between Castiel and Jo across from him and sat down. “You LARP? Seriously? I’d have had you pegged as some mechanical enthusiastic asshole.”
True to their word the Impala was in the carpark at the end of the day when Jo and the Novak twins walked out of the school building. Unfortunately, Dean was alone, which meant that when he spotted the cut above Castiel’s eye and the swelling on his cheek, which told Dean that his cheek bone was likely broken, he had no buffer for his temper. He got out of his car and strode forward, sweeping Cas into his embrace with one strong arm while the other went up to gently stroke the injured cheek and lightly touch the cut.
“Deep laceration to the eye. Six stitches. And a borderline fracture in my ankle. It’ll take six weeks to heal. Just have to wait for them to bring out a pair of crutches and then we can go.” Cass reported.
He was kind, and nurturing and gentle. He doted on her. And he worshipped her daddy. And he’d taught her that ‘real men’ don’t abuse their position over other people, no matter what the circumstances were. Her daddy Dean was her hero, and not just because he was a firefighter and had literally pulled her out of a burning building a few days ago.
This got Dean and Cass talking about their plans to go to the house once Chuck Novak showed up. Cass assured him that he wouldn’t need much in the way of a removalist vehicle and Gabe added that with both their rooms to pack up it would probably take a simple load in a Ute. Maybe a few things thrown into the back of Dean’s impala.
“Agreed. Though, I am removing her driving privileges for the duration of her community service. She will either have to get a lift with her brother, or catch the bus.”
“Like always, brother.” Sam finished. He held up his fist and Dean met it with his own. They bumped twice before parting to walk up either side of their car. This time Sam drove.
“It’s your fault my son has been corrupted.” The woman in the room behind him sneered. He didn’t deign to give her the satisfaction of turning to look at her. She wasn’t worth that much effort, much less that much attention.
“He’ll hate me. He’s going to look at me different.” He said, pulling into a space and then killing the motor.
“Hmm. One of these days you’ll give up on that. Its like you forget who I am. They’re inside. He got back an hour ago. She left for about fifteen minutes but she got home just before you showed up.” Sam reported.
Cas came to the door, hobbling on his crutches, and smiled shyly at Dean, who returned it with a lazy lopsided smirk. “What’s up fuck toy?” Dean said loudly enough for Castiel’s parent’s to hear.
"We'd rather she stayed here, under your watch. Dean's a paramedic, of course so he has medical training, but we don't want to risk anything happening while her leg is broken." Cas decided. Dean nodded.
“Well, we will still monitor you here for a few days, watch for signs of asthma and such. But so far your lungs are beginning to look better, which was why we’d decided that we could wake you up today. If all goes well, there should be no permanent effects. You may not have asthma now, but don’t be alarmed if you do develop it later. But, sadly, my time with you ends here. In a moment I’ll leave and bring in the man who will be working his magic on your leg, now that you’re awake. I just want to listen to your lungs first.”
Dean smirked and nodded. “That’s my brother. I was just telling you, to warn you, it’s not going to be easy. If you decide you want to date the kid it’s going to take a lot of work. Especially for us. We don’t trust anyone and it’s going against everything we’ve learned in our lives. But hey. If its what you want, I got your back.”
And Dean? What must he be thinking, to be the firefighter to take the call? Had he been the one to find their injured child? Not only was Dean a firefighter, he also pulled double duty as a paramedic, and Cas knew his husband would fight to the bitter end to save their daughter's life. But, despite his efforts to be more, Dean was still only human and he couldn't save every one he pulled from a burning building or met inside his ambulance.
It had always been his brother’s wish to be taken in by a family that they could trust and learn to love and who could love them. But Sam would never do that and risk being split up from Dean; too much of their lives had depended on them staying together. It was too well set into their beings for either of them to just walk away from each other. So, Dean had always known that if the day ever came where they were presented those papers it would be up to him to decide their fate, for better or for worse.
They walked hand in hand down to the front to wait for Cass’s ride, and when they got here Dean said he would walk Ellen and Jo up to see Summer.
Dean was frantic. Dean was never a frantic type of person and it gave Castiel pause. He stopped mid stride and shifted from, 'Can't talk now', to, 'you have my undivided attention'. "Dean, baby, calm down. Breathe. In, hold, out. Now tell me, calmly. What's wrong?"
“Cas go home did he?” She asked. She’d known them for a lot of years, had even had a hand in raising them after Bobby had adopted them. And if there was one thing she knew about Dean, it was that it wasn’t easy sneaking up on him…
Which was why it was such a shock when there was sudden movement and Sam’s fist connected with Dean’s jaw, and then with his nose – which broke with a shower of blood, arcing across the space between the brothers to splash on Sam’s shirt and face.
Dean groaned and his foot reflexively stepped onto the gas a little harder, even though there really was no reason for him to want to go faster; not like he was going home to fuck anyone. Then, if he was honest with himself, he was perfectly aware of the fact that they were going to end up in a bed at some point before the night was over. So, maybe, on that note, there was a reason to want to get there all the sooner, wasn’t there?
Sam shrugged, never one to be intimidated by his brother’s temper; they were twins, as angry as Dean got with him, he was always going to be immune to his brother’s true temper.
Castiel nodded, tossed the file meant for their meeting onto the desk and turned around to run out of the office, Sam's voice chasing him as he called, "take care of my brother and my niece."
Sam stood up out of his crouch so that he could turn to Dean and hold out his hand. Dean smirked and the switch blade he’d tried to give to Castiel earlier that morning appeared in his hand. Sam nodded, and, just before he turned to use the knife he lashed out with his leg, stomping sideways down on Uriel’s ankle.
When they pulled into the school parking lot Dean jumped out and ran around to help Castiel out. Gabe and Sam stood to the side, waiting to be of assistance if needed, though Sam knew his brother well enough that he knew Dean would have it covered. He’d managed a lot worse than getting someone with a broken leg out of the car.
The Group finally manage to get Gabe and Castiel's stuff from their parents, and Castiel is VERY grateful to Dean.
Cass snickered and slid off Dean’s lap but stayed close. “Can I call you my boyfriend?” He asked nervously.
He planted his keister in the chair opposite his twin, lounging back into his chair, one arm slung over the top of his back rest, one leg propped up on the edge of the seat beside him, and pointed to the bench where the pile of pancakes still sat. “Bobby left some pancakes on the bench for you guys. How’s your leg, Cas?” he asked, hoping to ward off any conversation between them and his brother for a little bit longer.
“She was, huh? Well, then, I guess I should correct my mistake. C’mere…” Dean reached over and had Castiel trapped with their lips locked before the other teen could even move. Cas moaned and fidgeted with Dean’s hand, trying to get it into his pants.
“Like I just had my lungs burned out of my chest and my leg crushed under a burning support beam.” The teenager replied.
“And yes, I let them drink because they’re not like other kids your age. They’ve been drinking for more years then I care to find out. And Dean, I have something for you to read.”
No one ever saw when Cass kissed her goodnight and drew little hearts on her hand if he came home from work after she’d fallen asleep, their own little Secret Code that told her she’d been kissed by an angel that night. Even at almost eighteen, he still drew that heart on her hand.
“And we start fights to get food into our stomachs and clean clothes on our backs.” Sam added, speaking over the top of his brother, shooting the driver a bitchface.
“I want us to be safe. I want to go to school and make something of my life so that I don’t have to live on the streets and die in a cardboard box in a rat infested alley. But if living the way I want to means that I lose you…”
As for the Novak Twins, (Sam had to revert back to the formal term, because he just couldn’t face the feelings that swelled in his chest when he realised Castiel and Gabriel had seen Dean lose the plot, and must now be judging him - just like everyone else that didn’t know Dean like Sam did.)
Of course, getting him and their father to the hospital had meant that Dean had been unable to avoid the authorities, which had led them to being placed in separate foster homes for the first time in their lives. Dean swore up and down that he’d felt the abuse Sam had endured at the hands of the man he’d been placed with once he’d left the hospital, claiming, twin connection. Sam had doubted it, having known his brother the way he did, he’d put everything that had happened in the days following their separation down to the fact that Dean was protective, mistrustful and had absolutely refused to be parted from his brother.
He was her hero because, despite being overbearingly protective, he was everything she wanted in a husband. He was the kind of man every man on earth should be.
Twenty minutes later, another doctor walked in. He greeted the family, introduced himself to Summer, but before he spoke to her about her leg he explained that he wanted to just take a peek at Dean’s hands. He followed Dean across the room to the bed he and Castiel had been sharing and then quickly set about the routine of inspecting the burned hands.
“Thank you, your honour, opposing counsel. See. I was honestly on my way home. I truly did go and see that movie with Alex. I can even give you a rundown of it if you insist. But afterward, I’d heard about another friend of mine who’s boyfriend had taken her mother’s car and had taken it to the race. She was scared her mother was going to find out and she’d be grounded ‘for the rest of my natural born life’. So, I went with her to try and get it back. I kinda had this dumb thought that I could use my connections to you guys as leverage. But just as we got there, the cops showed up to bust it open. Before I knew it, I was in that car. I don’t know how. It wasn’t even Makayla’s mother’s car. I actually don’t even know what happened to it, in all the chaos I lost track of her and the car. But when the police showed up, everyone was screaming and scrambling to make a run for it. I don’t even remember making the conscious decision to get in the car.”
Their mouths broke apart, but Dean’s didn’t leave Castiel’s skin; he trailed a wet path down Castiel’s neck and formed a suction right where he knew would get Castiel squealing – the tender spot just below the right ear.
“You never fucking do, Charlie. You never do. And the thing is, no one ever calls you out on it. But look what you’ve done,” Benny snapped.
With both his parents in agreement, Jack was left no other option but to retreat and go back to bed.
Dean, to his credit, lifted him out of the car like he was a rag doll, despite the awkward position he’d gotten into, and carried him into the house.
Cass gave him a sad look and Dean hoped Cass would drop it. He didn’t want to go into the whole sordid story right now. He was still struggling with his trust issue when it came to accepting Bobby’s offer of adoption. Now Cass wanted him to spill his guts and tell him every nasty detail of his life on the streets?
So far, nothing, but the day was coming. Dean knew it. One day this ‘uncle’ of theirs, if he even really was their uncle, was going to drop the other shoe and reveal his real motivation for taking two strange teenagers in off the street. Literally.
“Yes, and? He got under my back tyre. How was I supposed to know?” Dean was remorseless. Sam simply shook his head; he knew Dean would keep protesting his innocence, besides, it really had been an accident, and his twin really had been upset about it at the time.
“Don’t fuck with our friends again. Leave Castiel Novak the fuck alone. Leave Gabriel and Jo alone. Leave Benny and Charlie alone and leave Crowley alone. Or we’ll be back.” Sam growled.
But before Dean or Cas could set him straight, Jo did it for them. "Think. Very carefully. About what you say to me next, Greg. Dean loves Castiel to the point of insanity. They've been together since high school. And not only is Dean a paramedic and fire fighter, he was also a sniper. His father trained him from a young age on every manner of weapon available. When his father died he was adopted by Bobby, the man you call battalion chief, and who I call dad. That makes the fire fighter over there my brother. Now, are you sure you want to continue with your line of thought processes?"
Before anyone knew any different Dean had whisked the blade from Sam’s hand and hidden it from sight once more.
That was why when Summer woke up three days later Castiel was alone in the room. Dean had left to get some food from the cafeteria when it happened.
OK so I know you're all gonna hate me but I feel like this chapter needed to be done. It gives a bit of insight into Dean's behaviour. It is also the first time we see Bobby's point of view.
It took Dean a moment to realise that Cass hadn’t said anything. He stopped and turned to look at his husband, like, ‘well, aren’t you going to say something?’.
“What else do we need to sign?” Sam took over while Dean stepped back to stew over having to let another person dictate his and his brother’s life.
Good thing too, because Sam caught Dean’s hand reach for his blade and in a crazy premonition mental flash he saw Dean jump the desk and stick the leather bound blade hilt deep into her chest. He manhandled his brother out the door and shoved him down the hall to the closest bathroom. He checked the stalls to make sure they were alone before rounding on his brother and smacking the back of his head. “Are you fucking insane? You nearly lost your shit and knifed a fucking teacher you crazy asshole!”
“No. But it is the first time it’s been questioned by a fucking bitch in front of twenty other witnesses! Man, Sammy, I, I can’t fucking go through that shit every day. I’ll fucking snap.”
“Dean, baby, they’re right. We can’t do this. Not here. I swear, the moment you get us home, I’m all yours. But not here, ok?”
With that Dean turned in his seat to see Castiel. “The reason I lost it yesterday, was because when Charlie hinted that Sam had told you all ‘everything’ I thought she meant Sam had mentioned a very bad thing.”
“You’ll never know, Gabe, you will never know. You’re going to die an old man, unsatisfied and alone, forever knowing that I know something you do not.” Castiel taunted.
Only Sam could tell Dean was blushing furiously and knew the kind of thoughts that were going through his head; probably berating himself for not thinking like a ‘normal’ person. Of course Castiel would want to get the stitiches done at the hospital; he wasn’t a ‘street rat’.
He stepped on the gas a little harder and screeched into the parking lot behind a fire truck. He was out and screaming for Dean before he'd even put the brake on.
“So, yeah. That’s the story. It, ahh, it messed him up. We took off and hooked up with dad for a bit, until he was killed.”
“Make the family proud, huh? Meaning you. You’re my only family, Dean. Your use of the term ‘our’ is opposed to the proper term you should have used which is ‘my’.”
Sam shooed him out to the car and then turned to smile nervously at Gabe. “This goes well, it could be the first step to being here permanently.” He muttered to no one in particular.
But Cass shook his head. “No. It was agreed that it was best that we stay at school as we are so close to finishing. He will find a house here in town for us to share with him. He says he spoke to mother and father and they have agreed that they want nothing to do with us anymore so he’s ‘free to do with us as he pleases’ and they won’t fight him on it. Even said to pass on the message not to call them mum or dad any more. ‘It was Satan’s work that sent those boys to us and we must repent by disowning all knowledge of them’. Apparently it was a direct quote from my former mother.”
“First of all, dumbass. Apologise for calling him stupid.” Both teens turned in surprise. Gabe was standing in the doorway of the kitchen, leaning against the frame with his arms crossed over his chest.
Even Benny, although he'd called in sick - and he looked it - made an appearance. He tried to stay and be there for his long time friend, but Dean practically threatened to put a restraining order against him if he didn't go home and rest, even calling Benny's wife at work to tell her what he was doing. When she got there to haul his ass home to bed she was carrying a bunch of flowers and a get well soon balloon, saying she just knew in her heart that Summer was going to wake up and find them. Cas hugged her and then she dragged her husband back to bed.
And this time it was Bobby and Ellen that walked in as Sam was leaving. “Dean got breakfast done, but don’t expect us to be eating this morning. Dean and I will find something else.” He told them.
"The beam, it fell on her legs. It had her pinned. She was conscious when I found her, that's how I found her at all, actually. She was screaming for me. She was so scared, Cas. So damn scared. The beam was too heavy for me to lift. She kept begging me to save her, to get her out. 'My leg hurts, daddy, help me, daddy. I don’t want to die here.' No matter how hard I tried, l couldn't, I, I couldn't... And then it burst into flames and she started shrieking, 'help me daddy, it's burning, help me' ..."
It was Dean’s whole DNA makeup that made him feel this way about anyone he cared about, but Sam hadn’t seen his brother treat anyone like that since they were kids when he still trusted the outside world. There was no reasoning with him. Once he got it in his head that he was at fault for someone’s ‘bad juju’ there was no telling him otherwise.
“Then, I guess they’ll just have to deal with staring at the bulge in my jeans for the rest of the afternoon.” Dean remarked.
The doctor relaxed a little. "Great. I'm glad you agreed to keep her here. I will take good care of her. My hope is that we can get that burn cleared enough to cast it and send her home."
Dean reached down and grabbed hold of Alistair’s ankle and gave one almighty tug, pulling him to within reaching distance so that Dean could grab hold of his shirt and pull him to his feet. With Alistair on his feet, Dean shifted his grip to the back of his neck and he turned to shove the kid in front of Castiel. Alistair stumbled with the force of Dean’s action and he fell to his knees in front of Castiel. He felt Dean move in behind him and suddenly his head was reefed back so violently that his neck popped a little bit. He hissed in pain, but he was ignored.
And then suddenly he was being kissed. It was possessive and greedy and Castiel gasped at the intensity. Dean moaned and pressed his advantage. Castiel didn’t understand how Dean could be so tender and yet so aggressively possessive all at the same time. But then, he certainly wasn’t going to complain, not when he was being lifted by two strong arms at his ass and placed carefully on the hood of the Impala. He hooked his ankles together behind Dean’s back and pressed their bodies together like he never intended to let the other teen go.
“Scars? You think that’s my biggest worry, Doc? Scars are nothing compared to the feeling I get when I look across the room to see my daughter look back at me and smile.”
When he said as much to Bobby the old man simply sighed and turned sad. He pulled his adopted son into his body and hugged him tightly.
“No, but my back is covered by the one person who hates anyone calling me Sammy more than I do.” Sam answered, pointedly looking at Dean, who smirked again.
"Jesus. Is the woman alright. I'd like to speak to her if we can." Cas asked, tucked under Dean's arm and held tightly to his side. Dean turned them and wrapped his other arm around him and kissed the top of Cas's head.
"Her airways weren't so lucky. They were scorched. Her lungs have been cleared, yes, but she is in a great deal of pain. As such I've put her into a small coma for a couple of days, hopefully it will help to begin to repair some of the damage and make it easier for her to breathe again. She will have a tube in her nose and down her throat for at least that long. Once she is out of the coma she will probably experience asthma-like symptoms. Possibly for the rest of her life."
“CASS! Jesus man. She’s our daughter. There are certain things she shouldn’t know about our sex lives.”
“No. No, she’s fine. I’m not calling about her. I told you because while I was questioning her on what happened, I found out some thing you need to know about Alex. Or the guy she’s been seeing, actually.”
“Hey! I’m in here!” the voice behind the shower curtain took a moment to register inside Dean’s head.
After the kitchen was cleaned the twin traipsed upstairs and Sam closed the door behind himself, shutting out the world so he and his brother could process what had happened down stairs.
"In all this drama, we've been so concerned with Summer, I didn't put it together until just now. Her father tried to lift a burning wooden beam off of her. With his bare hands."
Dean let it go. If he argued with his brother on the subject Sam would only share more details with the group. Details which Dean didn’t want being shared. He’d done a lot of things he wasn’t proud of in the name of survival, and it had stayed with him – messed with his mind on a daily basis – that didn’t mean he wanted people to know about it.
It was clear that Dean and Cas were unable to process any thing more, so while Sam led them over to the seats, Bobby took over speaking to the doctor, introducing himself as Summer's grandfather.
“No, you just said you liked having food, shelter, a place to sleep and hot showers. You didn’t say you liked having those things here, with Uncle Bobby, Ellen and Jo.”
Right before he lashed out and threw Castiel’s crutch, tripping both boys, he’d noticed they’d both been trying hide a limp; so someone had gotten to them first. He had to find out who and why. As he stepped forward, he tossed his phone to Castiel. “Call Sammy. Tell him where we are and to get his ass here.”
“Dean. He’s not worth the jail time. And I mean, seriously? Do you really want to knife your boyfriend’s twin, in front of him?”
“Wait, what? What did you find out?” Gabe asked. He’d been tucked into the car, getting the crutches out for his brother, so he’d only heard the tail end of Cass and Jo’s conversation. Cass scowled at his twin and bumped him on the top of his head with the bottom of his fist.
"Well. It isn't as bad as we'd feared. Not quite into third degree territory but outside of the second degree spectrum. That means treatment isn't as complicated as it could have been. What does complicate matters is that the beam broke her leg. The doctor treating the break can't do much until that burn clears.”
“Shh. Shh, baby, I know. I know. It hurts. The first time always does. But, I promise, I will make you feel so good.” Dean mumbled, thrusting in further.
The doctor looked like he wanted to argue and tell them the burn was actually as serious as they get, but the look on Dean’s face told him that he knew perfectly well how bad his hands were. That he was just trying to reassure his husband.
Whatever Sam had been waiting to hear, that wasn’t it, judging by the long indrawn breath. He sat down on the bench seat and leaned back, his elbows resting on the table. He looked out over the school lawn for a moment. The dream Dean mentioned was a recurring memory that had intensified over the years until it haunted Dean constantly.
“You think that’s going to be enough to get us through the night? It might be a bit late to go in to pick up some more after we get done here.” Castiel added after a moment.
“Yeah, even more reason for you to stick around and prove him wrong. He really does like you, Dean. I know you can’t trust anyone. But you do trust me. So keep trusting me. He slipped up in there. But I truly believe he didn’t mean to be cruel about it. Talk to him, let him explain.”
“Fine. We gotta meet Sam anyway. Get in. Cass you’re in front.” Dean instructed, pulling away from Cas and then helping him steady himself when he slid off the car and back onto his feet. He opened the front passenger door for Cass before striding over to his side. By the time he got in behind the wheel and had the key in the ignition, Jo and Gabe were in the back talking happily about something that must have happened during lunch.
“How about you not be such a giant dick and help me up the stairs, find out which room our brothers have absconded to and make ourselves comfortable in the other one.”
“He is.” Sam answered, pointing at Dean with the forefinger of the hand resting on the top of the table. Like he couldn’t even make the effort to fully extend the hand towards his brother. And something in the gesture had an air of ‘I’m down playing my own level of bad ass-ness, but I can kick ass too’ that made Benny take notice. “I leave the fighting to him.”
“We’re all a little broken, Bobby. We just have to show them that we’re not going to walk away from them.”
"Oh, Dean." He wanted to cry. His husband had been suffering in absolute silence for hours. Of course, he got it. He understood why Dean would keep his mouth shut about it. He wanted his daughter to be looked after first. She'd been his number one priority this whole time. Any parent would be the same way.
The doctor nodded. “We took that out this morning when we were discussing plans to begin waking you up.”
Jo and Gabe stood to the side, blocking their display from anyone walking by. They’d been worried all day how Dean would react when he saw Castiel’s face, but this was the furthest from their minds when they’d imagined how he’d react.
While they were gone Bobby and Ellen made a run to McDonald's, so for a while it was just Dean and Cas and they were sent in to sit with their daughter.
“Actually, our mother was raped and killed thirteen years ago and our father was too busy getting drunk every night to remember our existence. So, while you’re right, we haven’t had an education in the last four years, you’ll do well to remember that we’re far from the village idiots.” Dean shot back at her, going for shock value; which seemed to work on some of the smirking teens, who looked down and away in shame when he mentioned the way his mother died. But the fact that he didn’t back down from the teacher, and even took a step up, getting in her face in clear challenge, enraged the woman.
When the bell had finally signaled the release of the ‘prisoners’ for the day Dean and Sam walked casually to the Impala, in no particular hurry to get home for anything. Despite the events in math class their day had gone well. Benny had joined the boys for their final two classes and he and Crowley stuck to Dean, while Sam had gravitated over to Castiel and Gabriel. It had been a new experience, not having each other within reaching distance, but they’d survived.
As if Dean had predicted it he turned and pulled Cass into his arms just as his legs gave out and Dean was left to hold them both up. After a moment where he took the opportunity to give his husband a supportive hug, Dean helped Cass sit on the couch before addressing the officer with one last question, “Are there any charges being laid against her for the traffic offenses?” Dean asked.
“On the contrary. You were my instinct. Hmm, that sounded better in my head. Let me try that again. I let him go because you gave me this look. I don’t know if you were aware of it. But you looked at me like you were offering me a choice; expecting me to drag the blade across his throat but hoping I wouldn’t. I knew I had to make sure he didn’t attack anyone I cared about again, but I didn’t think it would win me any points with you. I've had enough people in my life call me an animal, I didn't want you to be on of them.”
Summer smiled at the old nickname and handed the phone back to her father. Dean kissed her head as he took it back and then Castiel stepped in to start fussing over Summer’s blankets again.
“I think I’m gonna be sick.” Cass said at last. He opened his door and threw his upper body out of it just in time to hurl.
That left Dean to turn back to Castiel and help him to his feet. “Can you stand on your own?” he asked.
They turned and kept walking like nothing had just happened and miraculously made it to the class on time.
If they were a straight couple her father Castiel would be the soft hearted mama bear, emptying box after box after box of tissues while he drowned in tears at the bedside of his critically ill child. Her papa Dean would more than likely be the strong Alpha Male type who stood, stoic and silent, in the corner, not an ounce of emotion on his face, while he was truly dying on the inside.
The ambulance stopped and the paramedics in the front got out, prompting Dean to wipe his face of his emotions, if not his tears and soot, and stood up just as the doors opened, "Yeah, well..." He didn't finish as he strode forward and jumped down to the ground, helping the station's full time paramedic, Jo, to pull the stretcher out to wheel inside.
Sometime around the third and fourth upheaval of his insides a pair of boots appeared just to the side of his growing puddle of vomit, and Dean spoke. “Sammy must have gone into great detail.” Dean’s words suggested an attempt at snide sarcasm and aloofness, but his tone hinted at a newfound shyness that Cas had never seen or heard from him before.
“Cool. I’m a street rat, with no parents and an uncle I’ve just met.” Dean retorted, feeling a bit defensive with this kid’s apparent glamorous home life.
“Are you sure? A moon boot might be easier at school. It’ll keep the ankle more stable, too.” the nurse added.
Dean heaved a deep put upon sigh and then dragged himself off Castiel and got out. Castiel wriggled into a position that wouldn’t let him fall out when Dean opened the door, but that was as far as he managed to get.
Despite the fact that Bobby had only just gotten them to start school again this week, the twins had been with them for a few months. And in that time, they’d kind of let Jo in behind their walls a little bit. The rejection from Dean just now reminded her of when they’d first gotten there. Dean was open and friendly and outgoing now, compared to back then.
“I’m gonna say this and I know I’m going to get away with it because I am your brother, and I know you better than he does. But seriously dude, you are a dummy. Don’t look at me like that, you know I don’t mean it in the way they do. You’re a dummy because you didn’t stop to let him explain himself. Oh believe me, I ripped into him for using that word but I also stuck around to see the look on his face after you left. He didn’t say it with the knowledge of your past experience, Dean. And because of that, you were a little unfair on him.”
“But I like him, Sammy. What if he doesn’t think I can protect him enough? I couldn’t even protect myself.” Dean answered, looking down at his hands as they rested in his lap.
Dean nodded and turned, first to Cass and then to Gabe in the back. “Alrighty, we said we’d help you get your stuff. We’ll have two hours. Sam and I will go in first and make sure your parents don’t interfere. Since Cas is on crutches anything he can’t do, let me know I’ll get it done.” That said, he got out and followed his brother up the path to the front door where Sam lifted his fist and banged on the wooden door. There was no mistaking his heavy handed knocks as anything that could be implied friendly visitors either. Nope, they were two, quick, perfunctory boom-boom smacks with the bottom of his fists.
Castiel always let him win. He didn’t want to be dominant over Dean for any reason, even for just a kiss; he was the submissive one and he liked that. Dean took such good care of him, in every aspect of their lives, so why would he even want to dominate?
After that, she targeted him and Sam for every question she asked. For the most part Sam answered, correctly, thank you very much, to save Dean from getting up and ‘breaking her fucking face on the fucking desk’.
That Castiel had gotten hurt was his fault because he hadn’t pulled Alistair off of him sooner. That Castiel was thrown out of his parents’ house was Dean’s fault because he wasn’t there to protect him. That Castiel had had to suffer yesterday while walking home was Dean’s fault because he’d lost his shit and threw a temper tantrum.
Inside, Dean raided the fridge for a feed and Sam went up to their room to start on their homework. Dean wasn’t as book smart as Sam, in fact, he’d always struggled with school as a child because he lacked the attention span for it. ADHD, they called it. But Sammy thrived in the classroom. He drank the lessons in like a sponge and between the two of them, they got by.
“You’d have also probably told me to walk it off rather than carry my sorry ass to the car.” Sam quipped as he approached and leaned against the side of the car.
He was about to ask Castiel what was wrong when he saw them. Lucas and Uriel were walking towards them and neither of them had noticed Dean or Castiel yet.
“I do not have a crush… right, ok, so maybe I do have a bit of a small crush. But don’t even try to tell me you’re not into his brother. I’ve seen the way you look at him.” Sam argued.
This was a man who had been on the scene the moment his only child had almost died. A man who had watched the whole thing unfold, from beginning to end.
"So; when you left this morning. You know I was supposed to be rostered off. Well they needed me to come in and cover Benny's shift. Our truck answered the call for a building fire. At the school. Baby. Our little girl was caught in the building. I can't leave while the fire is still so out of control. But they need a parent to go with her in the Ambulance."
“Thank you. We appreciate you bringing her home, and I apologise for holding my gun to your face.” Dean said as he walked the man to the door.
Sam and Dean both felt like they were walking to the gallows as they took their seats in the back; backs to the walls, eyes to the front, visual on every movement made by the other people in the room, Dean’s hand always just within reach of his knife hilt.
“Dean, it means the same thing, sort of. At least, it kind of does. It means that you care about him.”
Suddenly reminded of her father’s role in her rescue, she looked up at the man still at the end of her bed, and just like that, his behaviour when he came in made sense. It had nothing to do with being a parent whose child was in hospital. This was a man who’d been there to see exactly what had caused his child’s pain, had dragged her away from it.
Dean shrugged a shoulder. “Never said I was the one who would do it. Just said that it could be done, especially once those friends of yours found out what you’re like behind closed doors. But, then, no one actually knows how much value you hold towards that slice of lawn, so, I doubt they’d know how much that act alone could hurt you.” Dean hesitated, like he thought that was the end of it, but then, as if in after thought he looked up at her and asked, “Do they?”
As the bell signalled the beginning of classes Dean got out and Sam moved around to the other side to help his boyfriend get Castiel and his crutches out. Dean glanced over the roof to make sure Castiel was ok as he walked to the back of the car and opened the boot. He dug around inside for a few seconds and then closed the lid and joined the group at the front, slinging an arm around Castiel’s shoulder.
“In other words, you know you’re tired, but you don’t want to leave Summer in case she needs something. Baby, look at me. Summer’s fine. Ok? Look at her, she’s alive. She’s going to make it. She’s out of the danger zone now. I will call an Uber and you will go home and rest. You’ve been here for three days. And now that she is awake and talking, you can finally get some sleep.”
Dean hit the brakes so sharply that the car jumped forward on the front tires, throwing everyone against the backs of the seats in front of them, causing Jo to smack her face into the headrest of Sam’s seat.
"What are her injuries?" Cas asked, knowing that Dean had to do this, for himself, that he had to handle this like a professional with any patient to keep himself together.
Sam made Dean wait and watch until the other twin pair were inside the house before he allowed his brother drive away. And not long after that Sam had his brother talking.
But it wasn’t Dean that answered; just as the older twin raised his finger above his head with a smirk, the bell went off, signalling the start of class.
Dean jumped and then smacked himself mentally. It was just Crowley, but still, someone had gotten close to him without him seeing. “Oh, yeah? And what’s their damage?”
So, instead he said, “I’ve had all the paperwork written up, so I’ll just go check in at the nurse’s station and inform them of the situation. I’ll leave you to get settled.”
Jo knew most of the story from what Bobby and Ellen had discussed with the boys when they’d first come to stay, so her reaction wasn’t so shocked. However, what she didn’t know was that Dean and Sam had more to hide that not even Bobby knew about.
Dean laughed and stepped back, raising his hands in a show of ‘I surrender’. “Go. Gabe has a point; I’d like to get this over and done with as soon as possible.”
“Course I like having those things. I just don’t trust that it’s going to last. It never does for us. Better to keep a distance. That means not making ties that are gonna hurt when it does go to shit. So, bang him then cut him loose.”
“That is the label you gave it yesterday, is it not?” Dean asked, turning into the carpark of the school.
It wasn’t a question. They both knew without even saying a word that Cass would never leave the hospital as long as both his daughter and husband were in it.
“Sup!” Dean answered, looking for his brother, first down the hall, then up the stairs as the other Winchester twin appeared at the top.
“Your father and I have discussed your punishment for that, by the way.” Castiel told her, slapping a plate of pancakes down in front of her before handing a plate of bacon to Dean.
“Why? It’s not like he wants me to kiss him or anything, what could I possibly do or say that would keep him here?”
The women lapsed into a quite conversation and Dean silently moved off to the side to wait for the doctor to come back with his discharge papers. He had to wipe away a few stray tears watching them laugh and joke and tease Jo over her new Mystery Man, but those tears had earned their journey down his cheeks so he wasn’t going to feel embarrassed about them when the doctor did finally come back and hand him the paperwork.
“Police broke up a gang of teens street racing out by the old Dairy factory. The car your daughter was in crashed trying to evade officers in pursuit. She has been examined by paramedics but she chose to be brought home rather than go to the hospital for further examination.”
Lost in the kiss, Dean found a tight grip on Castiel’s hips and tugged him against his hard packed body. Castiel grunted; either Dean was so skinny from his neglected life or he was just one of the lucky ones who was all muscle. One way or the other, it felt like he’d been slammed up against a block of cement. But, he didn’t have time to dwell on that right now, because in the next instant after being pulled into Dean’s body, Dean twisted and shoved him against the back door of the car and it wasn’t his hard body that Cass could feel against his thigh.
Dean scowled and punched the other teen in the arm, hard. “And you’re an ass. I did not fuck Cass last night.”
It was then that Uriel noticed what had caught Lucas’s eye. He visibly gulped. They turned and tried to scurry away, but they weren’t quick enough. Dean tried to hide a smirk, but didn’t quiet succeed.
After the last time they were caught unaware on the street, Dean had vowed never to let that happen again. He’d nearly lost his brother that night. The night from The Dream.
He sat down, but not before standing up to her for a moment longer to ensure she knew he would face up to her if she pushed him to it, and only then, he did it because his twin sat down first, which probably pissed her off even more, knowing that he did only as his brother told him to do.
“Fire. I was at school. There was a fire.” The girl finally answered, looking back up at her father. Cas nodded.
Sure enough, Castiel came hobbling into the room wearing his boot and balancing on his crutches. He was fully dressed and prepared for school.
Fergus, however, had only been adopted into the family after Summer was born. He'd been a friend of Dean's before hand, but the circumstances surrounding his sister's abuse and Summer's conception and birth had cemented him as family.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake! You three are such fucking babies!” Cas snapped, he appeared over Sam’s shoulder from a room further down the hall just as Gabe stepped out of the door way at the top of the stairs.
"Oh, my baby. My poor girl. You look so banged up. But, you're in good hands here. Your doctor sounds pretty competent. And aunty Jess says she will check in on you occasionally. Grandpa and grandma, well you know them. They'd give your dad a real run for his money in terms of fretting over you here. They're all going to be impossible to live with. You know that, right?" Castiel sighed, fidgeting with the hospital blankets covering his daughter's body.
He and his brother sat in conference with the nurse while Dean moved to the other side of the room, as far away as he could get from ‘more society’. Damn, it was just coming at him from every angle lately. He felt claustrophobic in here.
After a moment he shrugged and looked over at Charlie, adding, “But. Even as kind as those ones were, Dean’s favourite one is Scrapper. A woman named Mosely gave him the nickname when she read his file. The agency branded him a Fighter, because he always got into fights with the other kids and the foster families always sent us away again. It was meant to be a brand. A tarnish. Something bad and demeaning. But she took it and gave it new meaning, for both of us. She told us we could let it define us as something negative. Or we could turn it around. Make it mean that we get the shit beat out of us, and we still get back up. We have literally been fighting to survive our whole lives. And that’s not a bad thing. We are fighters. We are survivors. Thing is, it’s hardened Dean. And, some times, I feel like its hardened me, too.”
Castiel hung his head shyly and fidgeted with his jean clad thigh. “Do I make you nervous?” Dean asked him. Beside him his twin struck up an easier conversation with his own crush; Gabriel was more than happy to receive the attention.
But, his daughter was the patient this time. He hadn’t been thinking like a firefighter rescuing a child. He’d been thinking like the parent whose little girl had been screaming at him not to let her die there; his precious baby who he’d longed for probably even longer than his husband had been begging him for one (of course, that bit was hard to tell, since he and Cass had been together since high school and had, even back then, talked about having kids together).
Rowena had been a close friend of Sam's during college. She was also, technically, Summer's other parent. She'd been forcibly impregnated by her abusive husband, who may or not have been 'disappeared' afterward - Crowley and Dean would never talk about it, even if they did know something. Giving these circumstances and the fragility of her mental state following this abuse Dean and Cas had stepped up and offered to take the child.
“Oh. Daddy. I’m so sorry. You saved me. You never left my side.” She held out her arms, needing her father to scoop her up in his strong arms, like he used to do when she was very young.
By now, even Sam realized that Dean was shit stirring him. He sighed in annoyance, which turned into a real bitchface when Dean found the nearest person and got their attention, she was blonde with green eyes and a dusting of freckles. But neither twin noticed much else; not much to notice – ‘seen one girl, seen’em all’, as Dean would point out. “Hey, this is my twin, Princess Sam and I’m Dean, can you tell us where the admin building is to sign in.”
"I'm sorry. I was a total mess back there. I just... I keep hearing her screams in my head. Ya know? As a firefighter I see it all the time. But I never thought I would ever answer the call to save my own child."
It had been her tenth birthday and he’d forgotten to pick up her favourite birthday breakfast on his way home from work that morning. She’d told him she would never forgive him, even though they both knew she already had, so he crawled to her like a puppy dog and whine at her until she doubled over with laughter and said, ‘alright, fine, you’re forgiven, but don’t do it again’.
She was a right royal bitch. She looked down her nose at the twins as they approached her to get the sheet signed, and it just went downhill from there.
The person at the door knocked again and Dean grumbled to himself, “I’m bloody well coming. Keep your hair on.”
Just as he’d plated up for himself and his brother, and poured out two cups of coffee for them, Jo and the Novak twins walked in.
This time it was Dean’s turn to snort in response to the comment. “In other words, steer the fuck clear of those two. Shouldn’t be too hard. They don’t do it for me.” Across the room Castiel made some kind of movement that pulled Dean’s attention over to him as he spoke, and it was something in that look that made Crowley understand what Dean was referring to.
Cass slid over and pressed himself into Dean’s side as he attached himself by mouth to Dean’s neck, licking and sucking.
"Let's just say, that we only have family over during Christmas lunch. And everyone on shift today attends, every year, without fail. Plus a few extras that were not in attendance today."
“What am I supposed to do? What more could I possibly do? I told him I could do his head! I even said I’d help him get around.”
The thoughts of his brother’s unsung achievements distracted Sam to the point of madness. He had to do something for his brother. But that was easier said than done.
"You did not fail her, Dean. She is going to pull through. I promise. She is a fighter. Just like you. She's a Winchester. She'll pull through."
Dean had Castiel tucked under his arm, pulled tightly into his side, on their way to meet Sam and the others at the cafeteria. Dean wasn’t really paying much attention so when Castiel stopped walking and shifted uncomfortably at his side, Dean looked up in confusion.
Shocked, Castiel pulled away from Dean and looked down, and then back up. Dean’s eyes were hooded but the smirk on his mouth said it all. “I didn’t even realise you were…”
“You know, when I found them in that drop in centre, I was so glad they were ok. They looked so well fed, looked after. I mean I had no idea, just to look at them, seeing how clean and happy they were, that they’d been through so much. I thought I was looking at a couple of kids who had lived in a good home all their lives; well adjusted, reliable parents. As cared for as Jo. I almost turned around and walked out, so sure I’d made a mistake and that they weren’t Mary’s boys after all. And then their social worker began reading from their file. I almost laughed him out of the room. I even called him a liar. He warned me they were ‘broken’.”
“That bad, huh?” Cass asked softly, taking a sip from his own coffee, leaning back against the sink.
Sam would have told his brother to go fuck himself, but at that moment a car door shut and then the front door did as well. “Sam! Dean! Are you boys home?”
But then, the next time he’d felt like he’d been stabbed in the stomach he knew before he’d even looked down at his own torso that the pain he felt was Dean’s.
“DEAN! For fucks sake! Stop being a fucking tease! Either get off me and help me out, or damn well fuck me now!”
“Dude, he doesn’t trust Bobby. And you’ve seen how much respect he has for Bobby. Respect and trust are two entirely different things. Just because he respects you, doesn’t mean he trusts you. If you want him to trust you, prove to him that he can. He wants to trust you. He wants to trust everyone here. But our lives have taught us, him especially, that no one can be trusted.”
Sam went in and got it while Dean stayed out by the car, leaning against the hood, peeling an orange and eating it in segments. A red Porsche pulled up beside him and Lisa Braeden got out, sashaying her mini skirted hips as she passed him. He spared her a glance, just one to tell him who it was before he returned his attention back to his fruit. He was vaguely aware that she went into Bobby’s shop, but he was more aware of the man riding shot gun in the Porsche.
“Dean? Dean, before you go any further, we’re in the parking lot at school, everyone is watching.” Jo warned him, seeing his hand slip between his and Castiel’s bodies, headed for Castiel’s zipper.
“Sammy was… hurt, just before our dad died. It was just me and him. It was a matter of life or death. Anyway, I just… I’ve been protective ever since. But, just know that Sam and I have had it rough, alright? Your parents suck, but they were in the running for parent of the year compared to my father.”
“Cass. Babe. Why don’t you go on home and get some rest, hmm? You still need to meet with Sammy about that trial you’ve been working on.” Dean told him.
"You're talking to them now." Dean answered, gesturing to where Cas now sat, next to Summer's bed with his hands over hers, staring up at the monitor, quietly beeping away.
Reminded of his other patient in the room the doctor proceeded to rewrap Dean’s hands and then turned to address the teen.
"Shut up, idjit. You are not fine. Look at your bloody hands, Dean. Wait til I tell dad. Idjit." Cas retorted as a nurse came into answer the call button.
He turned to kiss his husband's cheek and asked, quietly. "So, come on, talk to me." When Dean didn't respond Cas tapped his cheek and ducked to make eye contact. "Dean. I need to know, what’s wrong with her?"
Dean was alone again, but not for long when Gabe appeared. “Cass is in being stitched up. Thank you for saving my brother’s life back there, Dean.”
“Dean, we’re not in this alone anymore, remember? Just let it go. Face facts; Bobby has to be our next of kin here.” Sam reminded him. Dean huffed a deep sigh and his mouth twisted into something akin to a grimace before he nodded.
Dean nodded like he was taking her statement into consideration as he looked at his feet, taking three slow steps away from the bench and giving himself this time to speak. It wasn’t that he didn’t know how to answer her snotty remark, it was more that it made her think he didn’t know how to answer her snotty remark. Finally he looked back up at her, and by now he was right in front of her, so he wedged himself between her and the wall, eyeing her coolly as he reached over his shoulder and calmly dislodged his blade. “Ahh huh. Pillar, you say? So, you must have a lot of social groups that you spend time with, clubs and whatnot?”
“No, sir. He’s a guy that Alex has been dating behind Aunt Jody’s back. Aunt Jody doesn’t like him, apparently. Says he’s trouble. And, yeah, I guess he is a bit of a jerk. Treated Alex like a piece of garbage at the movie last night. And I kinda think he’s been hitting her. But, no, he’s not the same guy from the Race.”
“Nothing. Just wanted to show you that family don’t end with blood, boy. It don’t have to run in my veins for you to be my nephews, Dean. Family is family and you’re mine. Now read the next two pages.”
The next morning Castiel's ass was tender and raw, but he was happy... and then his wayward daughter made an appearance at the table for breakfast. He eyed her up and down like only an angry parent could. “Nice of you to show up to breakfast.” He snarked.
“Now, look what you made me do. You made me wake Cas up, bitch.” Dean taunted, but Sam was already walking up the path to the house with Gabe and the only reaction he gave was a finger thrown up over his shoulder.
Jo leaned forward and tapped her cousin on the shoulder, leaving her hand in place, hoping to show him a tiny bit of affection that he might return. “Hey, thanks for the ride to school. The bus was a bitch yesterday.”
"Hey, baby, don't cry, please. She's going to be alright. I promise." Dean whispered into his husband's ear.
Dean followed right behind his brother, kicking the door closed behind him. Immediately inside the door was a hallway to the back of the house, to his right was a dining room with a fancy schmancy wooden table with ten places set up, from the royally obnoxious chairs to the even worse china place settings. They even had three of everything in terms of cutlery; knives, spoons, and even the forks. Dean’s lip curled in disgust. Such pretentious assholes.
Gabe groaned and rolled his eyes as he handed the crutches over and then huffed away. When Cas didn’t immediately follow he turned to look back at his brother, who was limping around the car to get to Dean’s side.
“I’ll fucking kill the fucking bastard. How dare he lay his hands on my little girl! I’m gonna kill him. And then I’m gonna ground her for the rest of her life! How dare she lie to my face! To my face! She lied! Jesus. I knew there was something off about that kid. He was in my house, Dean! He’s eaten at my dinner table! He looked me in the face and promised he would treat my daughter like a princess! I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt for Alex’s sake! But I knew. I just knew he was bad news.”
“I can stand, but not on my own. I don’t think anything is broken, but I might have sprained my ankle. He shoved me pretty hard and I landed awkwardly on my side.”
Gabriel showed up then, out of breath and panicked. “Someone told me Alistair was trying to kill my brother!”
After lunch the boys had metal work. This time Dean took notice of the other kids, specifically, Castiel and his brother Gabriel and the other kid from lunch, Crowley. By now the novelty of Dean and Sam’s arrival at the school had worn off, and only a few of them were still snickering quietly to their friends. Dean had heard a few of them whisper about the twins’ good looks. One girl in particular had hinted to her friend that she’d have Dean in her bed by the end of the week, her friend had responded that she’d have Sam.
“So, your solution is to just never be naked around him? He’s going to see and then what?” This time Sam spoke in the language they’d developed between themselves, the same one Bobby had noticed earlier, at breakfast. The vowels and consonants slipping and writhing together until they were unintelligible to anyone but each other.
Castiel simply nodded, his lips pressed into a thin hard line. Dean could feel it in the way his boyfriend was tense and refused to walk forward; he was waiting for an attack.
They were at the car now and Dean opened the back door for Castiel to sit down. Once the other teen was seated Dean crouched down in front of him and lifted the injured leg to his knee so he could remove his shoe and the sock. Cass hissed in pain and then sucked in a deep breath around another one, biting at his knuckles as Dean poked and prodded the foot.
But he lowered it a moment later when he realised the person on the other side of the door was wearing a Police uniform and that he had company in the form of Dean’s daughter. Dean’s seventeen year old Daughter. The daughter who should have been in bed asleep. He swore and tucked the gun away.
Even Jo had said, “Dean’s just trying to pick a fight, you gotta know that, right? Seriously. Think about it. He’s in your parents house helping to pack up your stuff because they don’t want a gay son. How else do you think he’d behave?”
Worse. Jody had sniper training. She was “Family” with Robert Singer, Rufus Turner and Donna Hanscum. All with the same type of background. They’d all taught Dean everything he knew.
“Yo, Jo, who’s this?” It was the deep southern accented baritone of another teen who had appeared over Jo’s right shoulder.
Sam had placed himself directly in front of Lucas when he’d squatted, so he had to shift and hobble around on his haunches in order for his friends to be seen. He pointed at each one, naming them and labelling them as friends, brothers, sisters, cousins; family.
“Take your time, Dean. Get your words together before you speak. You know how much it helps.” Sam said gently. Dean was about to reveal his biggest secret, the one thing that could get him so worked up that he stuttered, badly. So, to do that, he had to overcome the stutter before he said anything. “And when it gets too bad, I’ll take over.” He added.
One of Dean's crew members was by the truck and saw him and waved him over. "He's with Summer in the Ambulance. He found her under a beam that had fallen from the ceiling. He won't leave her side." Cas was pretty sure this guy's name was Ben. He was fresh out of the academy and Cas had only met him once at a fundraising event a few months ago, which was why it surprised him so much that the kid recognised him.
“Were what? What’re you gossiping about, Samantha?” Dean asked, appearing out of thin air at his twin’s side. He swatted Sam’s hair and then sat down beside him, regardless of the fact that Gabe was already sitting there, even ignoring Gabe’s protest when he was forced to make room.
“Have you kids eaten?” Ellen asked, this time sounding much closer. And sure enough, she appeared in the door way a short time later and smiled. Dean scowled back.
“I like it here, Dean. Roof over our heads. Food in our stomachs. Fresh, food. Food we haven’t had to scrounge out of a bin. It’s right there, downstairs. A pantry full, and a fridge overloaded. Not to mention the hot showers and proper beds.”
Dean nodded. "Yeah. I could have told you in a better way. I didn't handle that too well. I'm sorry."
But, Cass was too horny for that thought to occur to him in that moment. So instead he responded with, “Good. I don’t like topping. Unless its to ride your dick from above.” In a sexy, husky voice.
No one brought up what had happened in the hall, but Sam and Dean were both very aware of the looks they were getting. Neither Sam, nor Dean, had any remorse over any of it, because in their mind, they’d restrained themselves. But maybe it did seem a bit extreme to the others who hadn’t ever needed to use extreme measures to survive.
Sam was an optimist like that; he still believed he and Dean were able to be saved. He believed that there was still time for him and Dean to be taken off the streets and ‘rehabilitated’ into ‘well-adjusted model citizens’.
“What was that all about?” Sam asked him as they drove away. By now, Lisa had reappeared and was staring after them as she tried to help her passenger to his feet. Not an easy feat in the hooker heels she was wearing. The heels on those things were longer than Dean’s prick!
“DEAN!” Sam shouted in alarm when he saw his brother standing up to some random guy he’d never seen before. But then, duh, this was his brother he was talking about, “Are you ok?” he asked, less concerned, though he was definitely very alert as he walked back to the car, wondering if his brother needed him at his side.
Dean grunted but only spoke to Sam; “You gonna have a coffee? You wanna get me one too? Thanks, Sammy.”
“The one where you killed the guy hovering over me?” it wasn’t a question. Only one nightmare haunted him so much that ‘the dream’ had officially becomes its name.
“So stricken. Very well, how about this sentence, community service. One month’s grounding, as opposed to the two we originally discussed, and two of those four weeks is to be done at the office as my assistant.”
Dean chuckled, turning to grin broadly at the other teen. “Be careful with that one, dude. You’re propositioning a street rat. You’re in way over your head already.”
As if his question had summoned her, a doctor in blue scrubs came through the door. "I'm looking for Summer Winchester's family?"
A triage nurse came forward, addressing Jo and her partner, a paramedic Cas didn't know, as was, obviously the protocol, - obviously the hospital staff aren't going to ask a fire fighter what they needed to know.
Castiel screamed, his eyes went huge and then rolled into the back of his skull and he seemed to have a seizure. Dean smirked. “And that, my friend, was the Sweet Spot. Feels good, don’t it?”
“Hmm. I don’t that yet, either. But you need to get back into your seat before they come back, I can’t drive with you sitting on my lap.”
All colour drained from his face and he bit out, “Car’s out front.” Before pivoting on his heel. He walked out, leaving Sam and Gabriel to help Cass get the moon boot on when the nurse brought it out for him. She also handed him a pair of crutches in case he chose to use them.
They all sat around the room in various degrees of worry, weariness and anxiousness. Everyone was silent and in some cases, such as Ellen and Rowena, they were sobbing.
It had bugged Dean to no end and eventually he’d just given up and walked away. Sam had finished with the teacher by then anyway. They’d had Biology and then History after that. He’d never gone so long not having his brother at his shoulder, but he’d kept most of his attention directed to Sam’s table and was ready for anything if he had to fight his way to his twin.
“Holy shit. And he’s sarcastic to boot. Be still my beating heart, I think I’m in love!” Dean declared, making Castiel blush as red as a tomato and hung his head again.
He placed a hand over Dean’s, which currently had the knife held out for Castiel to take. “Dean, give me the knife. He doesn’t need it. He’s safe. He has you watching his back, are you saying that’s not enough?”
“Dean!” Sam called back. But when Dean didn’t stop or turn around he faced Cass in the wheelchair. He’d have asked his friend what had happened but the look on his face suggested Cass was just as confused as he was. He did ask, “What’s happening?” to the other twins thinking they were ready to go.
“Ahh, yeah, my leg’s doing fine today, despite the fact that I had to walk home yesterday. Jo and Gabe almost had to carry me.” Sam winced and shot a quick look at his brother, aware of the fact that Dean held himself accountable for Castiel already, and he knew that Dean would take that as a personal dig at him bailing on the others yesterday.
They obviously hadn’t moved the entire time, because they were still sitting on the end of the bench, as far away as they could get. Gabe was staring in open horror at Sam and then at Dean, who was still on his back with his arm thrown over his face like he was trying to hide. And Castiel shared the same look of horror, only he’d had the presence of mind to try and cover it behind his hands cupped over his mouth and nose.
“We’ll get him to school. He’ll be alright. We’ll even wait in the carpark to make sure you guys get there ok and so that Cas isn’t alone.” Sam assured him.
Cass nodded, “She’s been very good to you.” He told her as he approached the bed and kissed her hair. “How do you feel, baby?”
“Yeah, right. Sure thing. Bobby’s next of kin then. Whatever.” Dean muttered. He didn’t think he would ever get used to having to put his, or, more importantly, his brother’s, life in the hands of some outsider wannabe with nothing to lose and everything to gain by having Dean and Sam under their control.
Cas levelled him with a serious look that told Dean he knew exactly what had happened, even before Dean ever said anything. It was usually a look he saw on his lawyer husband’s face when they were thrown a case and they knew; shit was about to hit the fan. It was a look that said, he got it, he’d been there before, they both had, and they got through it then, they will get through it together this time too.
“OW!” she snapped. She shot Dean a sharp death glare, but it died on her face before it could settle into place when she saw the look Dean was giving Gabriel.
The dig took the wind out of Summer’s teasing tone and her grin slid off her face like water off of granite. “I’m sorry, daddy. I was just teasing.”
Dean didn’t have to look at his brother to know the kind of look he was being given right now. Sam was sad that Dean could never truly be comfortable being confined to society’s restrictions. He was ‘born free’; never meant to be tamed. But Sam was different. He was the one who deserved to be happy and to live a real life.
“I have to disagree with my brother. He wasn’t truly pissed off just before. He was angry, annoyed mostly, and definitely wanted to hit something – preferably a couple of homophobic parents, in the face, with a brick – but he wasn’t truly pissed off. I’ve seen him pissed off and that wasn’t it.” Sam argued.
“Everyone around here knows that Sammy and I may be on our own but we watch out for each other. Everyone knows that. They know that to mess with one brother, you mess with both. It’s quite simple, really; don’t touch my pie, don’t touch my car, and most importantly, don’t EVER touch my Sammy.” On the last word Dean swung the baseball bat and struck the man in the stomach with the end of it. The man doubled over and coughed up a spurt of blood.
Behind him came Ellen, Jo's mother and Dean's adopted mum. She spotted them and raced over, immediately pulling them both into her embrace. She owned the local bar, so she must have gotten the call about Summer after the fire. After all, if grandma Ellen found out her grandbaby was in the hospital and no one told her, there'd be hell to pay.
“There’s a fine line between using toys to bring you satisfaction, and having a professional take it up a notch or three thousand.”
Summer groaned. “You mean he’s going to be more overbearing and protective than he already was? I didn’t even think that was possible.” She grumbled good naturedly. Her cheeky grin giving her away. Dean saw it and chuckled at Castiel’s expense.
Dean stared at him, mouth hanging like a tire swing on a sagging branch. “Mother fucker say what!” he suddenly blew up. Sam nodded like he agreed with the statement but didn’t add anything to it.
“So, what’s gotten into you today? No. Wait. I’ve seen that look. I’ve seen it before. That fight with Alistair at school. That woke something in you. I know it did. You carried Castiel to the car afterward. And wanted to stitch him up. There is only one person in this world you would try to take care of like that. And I’m sitting right here with you.”
Dean took the time to recycle the entire scene. Bobby had done what he thought was right, but Dean was still on the fence about whether the man could be trusted. Not even Sam, the one who wanted a family so badly that he was willing to stay here past the time frame they’d agreed upon when they got here, knew how to process this.
Cass looked down at the mess and grimaced. “Yeah. I guess I’ll just have to get out the other side. And yeah, your brother painted a very vivid picture.”
“Alright, so that’s being dealt with ASAP. But, we’re getting off track. You got pulled into this car against your own free will. Is that what you’re saying?” Dean asked, shooting off a text to his friend Jody that she needed to call him as soon as she got his message as he spoke.
“Sweet. You and I are going to be good friends. Here, have my fruit squeeze, mum threw it at me as I was leaving this morning, said she wants me to start eating healthy. Please, burgers are my life. You’re not gonna catch me shoveling healthy shit into this mouth.”
Cas batted at him gently and then he finally registered something; Dean was still in all his gear, still soot and tear stained, still smelling like a burning building. And that reminded him, Dean had tried to lift a burning hunk of wood. His brows turned down and knotted together in the middle. "Dean, show me your hands?"
“No. She has cooperated with the officers on the scene and insists she begged the driver to stop. The rest of the passengers also verified this. The only questions we have, are about her involvement in the street racing. She says she was just there to watch, but our inquiries are on going. Until we can determine whether she was more than a spectator we have nothing.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Gabe asked. “How much worse could it get? Feral? They were labelled feral, Jo. What the hell happens in a kid’s life that the term ‘feral’ is used?”
“Thank you, Doc. We appreciate everything you’ve done for Summer.” Dean told her, holding his hand for her to shake. She smiled and shook it. And that was when Summer noticed his hands. They were both heavily bandaged and it made their handshake awkward and suddenly, Summer understood. He’d pulled that beam from her leg. He’d taken his fire gloves off to pick up that burning beam.
“And as if they’d believe a scum bag like you. I am a pillar of this community.” She retorted haughtily, stiffening her shoulders, and raising her head like only a snobby entitled bitch could.
And then, suddenly, after spending thirteen years believing he had no other family, Bobby showed up out of nowhere and said, ‘hey, I’m your mother’s brother, I have a place for you to live’. Yeah, sure he did. And what did he want in return?
Finally, Dean went limp under his brother, who sat back on his haunches the moment he saw the fight leave him. “Damn it, brother. How could you think so little of me? Huh? I knew you didn’t trust the world, but fuck me, I never thought I’d ever see the day that you didn’t trust me.”
Dean hesitated for a moment longer, but Sam pushed his hand down and finally Dean nodded and the blade disappeared.
Sam’s heart shattered and he was pretty sure Dean heard it. Dean shot him a look and then pushed down from the table.
“Big deal! We shared the same womb together, and everything since then. We are twins. It’s about time you start treating me like it.”
He was taller than Crowley and dressed more casually in blue jeans and a grey sweater. His hair was dark and his eyes were full of laughter – mocking or otherwise, Dean couldn’t decide, but they didn’t make him want to run away from an ambush.
Dean growled a bit and Sam knew Dean would listen to his warning and not do anything stupid. It was his ‘aww man, you party pooper, Sammy,’ growl. And right there, Sam thought he knew how to get his brother to stay. Dean was a protective being, if he thought someone needed saving he was the first one to jump in.
Castiel nodded. “I can’t say that I understand, but I’m a patient man, I can wait until you’re ready to talk. But just so we’re on the same page. None of what you and Sam told me will ever leave my mouth. And it doesn’t change the way I feel about you. I will always be there to listen and to be as supportive as you need me to be.”
After a while, when the pancakes were gone and the boys had lapsed into silence, the driver’s side back door opened and Castiel let out a small grunt-huff sound as he wrestled his leg and the crutches into the car. Gabe got in behind Sam and slid over so Jo could get in too.
But Dean nodded and looked up to find that his brother was watching the Novak brothers on the other side of the courtyard, both sitting at another outdoor table – on the bench seat like proper people do. Sam was really into Gabe. It had only been a couple of days, but Dean could tell when his brother was interested in a guy for more than just ‘a fuck’.
“She presented a valiant defence. I’m inclined to believe her.” Dean decided once they were sequestered away in the kitchen.
“Dean, let her go, you’re hurting her. Come on babe. We almost lost her to a fire, don’t let her gravestone read ‘survived a fire and a broken leg, only to be crushed to death by my father’s bear hug’. Come on.” Cass teased, gripping Dean’s upper bicep to begin prying his husband away from their injured daughter.
Dean chuckled darkly and reached behind Castiel to open his door. Pressing his lips to the shell of Castiel’s ear he murmured, “If you get there before me, I’ll let you ride me and give you as many orgasms as your pert little ass can handle. But if I get there before you, I’m gonna tie you to the headboard and fuck you until you can’t see straight and make you come untouched.” And as if to emphasize his point he thrust his straining cock against Castiel’s thigh.
Cass shuddered. That was Dean’s Bedroom Voice. The one he used when Cass was about to be kept up all night. The voice that had convinced Cass a long time ago that their bed is sturdier than it looked, but even still, it was going to break one day, and Dean would still be fucking him even in the ruins. He gulped and then nodded, message received, loud and clear.
“WHAT! Are you serious? You were in a police chase? Jesus, Claire! Haven’t I always told you never to run from the police? Did you seriously think I wouldn’t find out about it? Where’s your bloody brother? Did he go with you?”
Dean shrugged, once to dismiss her, then again to dislodge her hand, and when that didn’t work he wiped it off, shooting her a look that, even though he didn’t say it out loud, told her not to touch him. She swallowed a lump of disappointment and sat back, hanging her head to watch her fingers twist and twine together.
“His name’s Castiel Novak. He was beaten up at school. He sprained his ankle and cut his head.” Gabriel told her.
"I heard that Joanna Beth." Dean retorted, but there was no emotion behind it. He wasn't just tired, he was drained. And it was barely past noon.
“Hmm, your husband let us in.” Dean waved dismissively, “I’m distracting myself. It’s easier for everyone involved that my brother handles the lecture your husband is getting right now. He’s the one with the brain, you know? Me? I’m more of the ‘muscle’. He thinks, I act.”
What he was not aware of was the drive it took to meet up with his brother until he pulled up along the kerb, smirking through the windshield at said brother, who stared back at him. His arms were folded across his chest and his feet were planted firmly… despite the fact that Dean deliberately nosed the car to a stop, just inches from hitting him. Anyone else would have thought Sam was made of nerves of steel to be able to simply stand there without reacting to a potential threat to his life.
Meanwhile, his father had never asked to see him or Sam again, even when his former marine buddy stepped in and filed for adoption.
Cas reached for them, already knowing what he was going to find. Didn't prepare him for actually seeing it though. He swore, viciously. Dean's hands were so badly burned Cas didn't know if they were even hands any more. They were red and blistered and obviously caused his husband a great deal of pain.
Around the time the canteen staff were bringing food around to the patients, the doctor in charge of treating Dean’s hands came in to speak to them. “I’ve had a discussion with the doctor taking care of your daughter. And we’ve agreed that given the condition of your hands, while it isn't very likely, there is a chance of infection, which is why we’re going to admit you. And under the circumstances, we’ll have you in here so that you can stay together."
Silence fell over them again as Castiel, kneeling beside Dean's  seat, his arms thrown around Deans shoulders in a death grip, Summer's hand still gripped tightly in both of Dean's. He let his head fall against Dean's jacketed chest again and Dean's dropped onto the top of his.
“Enough talk about our brothers.” Dean murmured as he climbed on over Castiel, forcing the other teen to let himself fall backwards. They kissed and Castiel moaned. His hands slipped down Dean’s chest and reached for the hemline of Dean’s shirt.
“You say that like we’re giving you a choice.” Dean noted, his eyebrow up in the middle of his forehead.
As had been their way of handling disciplinary actions within the family since the twins had been young.
So, as Dean pushed his way through the crowd, Sam stayed on him and then turned to pace the perimeter of the crowd while Dean marched forward. He reached out and secured a firm grip into the head of hair hovering over the kid on the ground and then reefed backwards; jerking the teen back and off balance to land on his ass behind Dean.
“Fine. This guy was just telling me about his piece of shit Porsche.” Dean answered. His blade was gone in the blink of an eye, and as Sam opened the car door, Dean lifted his hands, palm out, and shoved the wannabe thug back and away from him and smirked as the weirdo stumbled back and fell on his ass.
