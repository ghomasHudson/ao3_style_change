“Hey, all I mean is I’m happy for you. If this bloke is good for you, I say carry on. You deserve some fun.”
Charlie had left by the time Linda dropped Rosie off. She said ‘thank you’, and headed to her room to drop things off. Sherlock made tea, black for him, lemongrass for Watson. She came back downstairs and attached like an octopus.
“He said 'That was awesome!'”
They held each other, skin against skin, for a long time. When John was about to turn the lamp off, Sherlock pushed him belly up and raised his head on his hand. “May I touch you?” John nodded his consent, and watched Sherlock touch his arm, his chest, making circles with his index finger through John’s chest hair. He got on his knees and drew the contour of John’s body, trying to temper his feelings by collecting plain and rational data. “You’ve lost fat. These muscles are newly defined.” He touched John’s legs, rubbing his hands against the body hair. He touched both feet, enveloping each one in his hands, pressing on the soles as he did when he gave massages. He then went back up to the shoulders, the left one, with the old scar. Sherlock followed the outlines with his finger, the lines around his eyes spoke of longing. The slight tremor in his hand of suppressed desires, “How I have missed you,” he sighed.
“Why on earth would you even ask? Wasn’t it obvious? To the whole neighborhood?”
Rosie knew these were supposed to be menacing, but she had tried investigating her mom’s name, and there were thousands of Mary Elizabeth Watsons. She found the right one, in a newspaper, an announcement of her wedding with dad, who was called “Sherlock Holmes’ former live-in private assistant”, but there was not a lot of information, other than she was a nurse. There was a picture of her still in the archive, on the site of the Royal Free Hospital, where she was listed as an RN, which she knew was a registered nurse. Her dads didn’t let her use the computer freely, so she didn’t really know how to look up more details. Dad had said she had worked as a special agent before nursing, but she couldn’t find anything about that. She was confused and frustrated.
John took off his shirt, his trousers, his socks. He intended to undress Sherlock, but he was looking at him blinking and one hand had gone to his curls, tugging at his own hair. Overwhelmed?, thought John, so he opened the covers and lay on the bed, inviting Sherlock to lay down next to him and John let him look, let him touch. The first thing Sherlock touched was John’s scar. Delicately traced it with his fingers, then came closer to observe it, catalog it and place it on the John in his brain; the Mind Palace he had talked with him about. Even closer, he looked at John’s face. “May I?” he asked, and John said yes because that was his answer to most of Sherlock’s questions;: “Yes, I’ll get it. Yes, I’ll find it, Yes, I’ll make tea, Yes, I’ll patch you up. Yes, I’ll go with you.”
To John’s surprise, Sherlock took him into a very nice Italian restaurant. Even more surprising, the owner welcomed them in, hugging Sherlock tightly, dirty, smelly and bloody as he was. Angelo skipped the menu, brought them a bread basket and salad, a bottle of wine. Sherlock poured for John, but not for himself. The waiter brought them an enormous plate of lasagna and another of seafood and pasta in vodka sauce. At the look in John’s eyes, Sherlock explained he had saved the man’s life by proving he had been betting on underground fight matches at the time he was accused of killing a man. In reality he was the promoter of the illegal fight club, and Sherlock fought there, when his overactive mind and restless body needed an outlet.
“He really meant it, that we were coming back, you see? He says he doesn’t want our visits to change. I stropped and had a fit, and was really nasty on the way there. The attendant came and she took me to the front of the train. She talked about how she was divorced and her children spent days with her and days with their dad. She was nice and gave me a fizzy drink.”
“Hey Sherlock, I wanted to show you this comparative I did. See in this paper, researchers from University were conducting translational research on autoimmune diseases. They were at the clinical trial, the earliest stages. I believe someone got cocky and is trying to introduce some of their very own experiment, on live subjects, of the homeless variety. So I got to thinking, what if they were just looking for sick people, cause they wanted a cover for what they were doing?’
John’s voice broke when he kissed Sherlock’s wrist, “This is for when your were laying on the street, and I wanted desperately to bring you back to life.”
(I just HAD to include this song for them!!)
“I’m… I don’t think I can. I need you to hold me, not...”
“No. I just couldn’t. I mean, I do have eyes, I’ve seen quite a few attractive blokes. I was asked out by a couple of them, too. Everytime, it was like I saw Sherlock in my head.”
“Gentlemen, we must go. Harris this is not about who takes me to the ball. I work with John. I called him because of his expertise with the victims. Please let us get to this meeting in time. Stewart is a perfect representative of the Yard. He is more than able to ensure our safety and our respect for due process. John…”
John took a deep breath and continued; “... fine, five times a year, sending out donation reports, asking for more, and such. It got so I only scanned the titles. I missed James’ first actual email. I only responded two weeks later, after looking up a receipt for something and actually seeing the headline addressed to me from him. There he had been letting me know he and Milton had separated. There had been some nasty fights and he begged me to keep things private. I answered him right then, as best I could and in my hurry, I only addressed things he wrote to me. There was one more personal email, and that was to inform me that he was coming back home to England. The fights with Milton had continued as they had to work together and he was feeling dangerously depressed.
John did the night shift in a daze. Sherlock had a bloke. His Sherlock. He went through different scenarios in his head. He imagined Sherlock with a gorgeous, dashing man, his own heart breaking, despair announcing itself already. Even so, when he made it back to his flat, he fell into an exhausted sleep. He woke up, remembering the night he and Sherlock had after Greg’s Retirement Party, how Sherlock had looked at him, how perfect it had been, and resolved to not give-up. He knew Sherlock better than anyone else. He knew how to win him back.
“No. I think he might have had too much to drink and left me an angry voicemail. I erased it. The texts were just my name…”
, that you weren’t over him. I know how that feels…”
Harry picked up the mood in an instant when her niece, sunny and chatty on skype, was sulking more than the git himself. Rosie did say hello. They liked each other. When they got in the car, as John put their things in the back, she asked for Harry’s phone. She wrote a quick text message and gave the phone back. Harry needed to have a long detailed chat with her brother.
The next day, after morning conferences, had John again looking for Sherlock all over the resort. He wasn’t answering his mobile, his messages. John had looked in the buffet, at the pool, now he was looking along the shore. He saw a man raise a hand and walked towards him. It was Wilson. He crouched down, his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders. Something had happened. John started running.  Sherlock was crouching on the sand next to Wilson. He failed to acknowledge John in any way. Wilson put his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and said. “You can call me if you want that ride, alright Sherlock? Just, you’ll have to give me directions as we go.”  Sherlock hummed in response.
Sherlock gave an exasperated sigh. “We were broken up! I even checked with you before engaging in any kind of physical congress with Luther. He and I were not a couple, not in love. I just wanted to test whether someone else could possibly want to be with me in an intimate manner.”
is behind that door, with Detective Inspector Lestrade.”
“Nah, just been busy, with Rosie out for the summer and the private cases plus the ones for Yard. You remember how it is.”
John knew better, though. He, Meghan, Charlie, the Stamfords and the Holmes parents, went all in to make the little wedding happen. Meghan, who had a more flexible schedule than Harry, would come down on Friday afternoon and stay the weekend to help at first Charlie, going to Sussex Downs with her, choosing a catering that also rented tents and chairs and tables, securing a landscaper to make the outdoor beautiful, hiring a gardener that would plant the flowers. John called the “River Boys” group from Mycroft’s wedding, and the singer was very happy to participate, refusing to have John pay for the airfare. He also went to Goldings and had a new suit bespoke for the occasion, unbeknownst to his intended.
It felt very good to be out and about with Watson again. “Sure, Little Bee, We’ll go to the place next to the bakery, that way we can get some pastries to share with Nana.”
Greg tilted his head and stared at him with a smile, “How’s that going. Himself satisfied with your participation?” eyes twinkling.
Sherlock then pulled back almost all the way out. Then forcefully back in. He did that for a couple of times, then changed the rhythm to a more shallow penetration, then back to the deep ones.
You can find all the music I listened to on repeat while writing this fic + a couple of Luther's pieces, here
“I have always made time for Watson. She learned three  languages, how to use the scientific method, read maps, and so much more  in the time we have spent together. She knows how much she means to me. I know the name of each and every one of her best friends, and crushes...did you know, by the way that her current crush is Jackson? I know her favorite foods by heart, I know her favorite music, books, movies. I KNOW HER!! Sherlock was yelling and pacing, his arms and hands all over the place.
“It must be a mistake, show me!” All Sherlock wanted was to take Watson home.
“Sherlock…,” Mike said patiently, “...I do not go around the underworld interviewing homeless people. I just don’t. You’re more than welcome to bring them to my office. Aren’t they in your network though? Wouldn’t they talk to you?”
*********
The cases described in this story, will always be secondary to the men's story. Cases are only to highlight what they are to each other. For a story with a great case (There are many in this talented fandom), may I direct you to,
“A month or so, yes. I was working on the case of Donovan’s niece. It helped me focus on getting that little girl out of the bad home conditions, into a good school. I was alright if I was busy. It was much harder coming back home.”
on YouTube.
Instead of an answer, Sherlock said goodbye, took his hand and yanked him with him. Down the corridor and up a flight of stairs they went, behind the busy cubicles and offices. They entered a little file room, and Sherlock took out a key and closed the door. There was that little smile again. “Well?”
by the incomparable 72reasons.
Now here he was, unable to breathe, eyes filling up on the edge of a panic attack. Not good. He could see Sherlock talking to him, gloves on, concerned. He could see the blood running down his nose, the split lip the blood filled eye….
Then they went on to work the topic with which John still had work to on.
“That he did, being that his mama is my oldest girl. You however, you can call me Daddy.” Luther winked.
“I almost left.”
When she was asleep, he went back downstairs, to find a welcome, familiar scene; John on the couch, watching his favorite tattoo show. Two whiskys sat on the table. Sherlock took his seat and played his role, fighting with the telly, but mostly sneaking glances at John. Their eyes met once and John took the drink: “A toast for being back home!” They touched the glasses. “I missed this.” John said, his eyes shining. Sherlock's heart warmed. John touched the bandage on Sherlock’s arm. “Is it hurting?”
*******
“Hey, what’s the hurry? You’re still drunk, shouldn’t be alone on the streets. Stay, Rosie is at Mike’s, you can sleep in the room. I sleep on the couch anyway.”
“Hmmm. See, there’s the thing. I’ve been consulting with this hospital in Cheltenham. They are opening a new wing that will be dedicated to service veterans of all armed forces. They’ve been on my case offering me a full time position, given my work with the homeless here. What they’re doing is exciting and innovative and I would like to check it out, but the presentation tour would be the week of your wedding.” John explained
-Are you alright?
“Oh, sorry, was that my cue to pretend to be scared. Alright then, my mouth is making an O and my hands are at either side of my face. ‘Agggh’," he gasped.
The school year began, and they both attended the parent-teacher conferences. John continued working on the Veteran’s Health Project at Barts. Bill and Molly announced they were in fact expecting twins.
“Sherlock, this is amazing! Aren’t you going to eat? I swear you look thinner than I left you. You are still not talking. You were texting up a storm about the case. It’s done isn’t it? How did it go down?”
Moriarty and Moran may be away and in hiding, but they are still having an impact in John and Sherlock’s life. All this dedication to the case means no time for more important things! John has been trying to support and help Sherlock, but the constant meetings, and planning, and searching is draining Sherlock. John decides to go to Big Brother for help, and given some much needed intervention, Sherlock will remember which things in life are worth slowing down for! Here comes the happy ending!
A Birthday Party!! There will be bubbles! there will be a rock wall to climb! Ice cream! Face painting! a jumpy house! The whole nine yards! Who is this little boy? Also; "5 Ways to Kill Your Chances With Your EX!" and "Does Whisky go well with Pizza?" Also, "Somebody Would Benefit From a Mute Button". Yaay!! Rosie's Friend turned 10! and he has a Pirate costume complete with hook hand and toy cutlass...
The TD-12  induced waking hallucinations and a quasi hypnotic submissive state. Each of us had different experiences with the drug. John had vivid dreams of having an affair with a woman he saw on his commute. He thought Ella was working against him. Mary told him I was conspiring with Mycroft against them. Convinced him I was in love with Molly, that she had replaced him on the cases and that I wanted to imprison him to keep him from helping Mary. That’s why later he believed I had called him and Mary to the aquarium and got her shot in a confrontation with the ‘real’ villain.
-You too, love. Good night.
“Touch me, Sherlock, start with my face.” For a minute, there was that sad look, but he kneeled up straddling John’s legs, and started touching his face, both hands on his cheeks, his neck.
“As I said, If she will be happi...wait. What did you say, Holmes? You slept with her?-” Lizbeth took two steps towards where the consulting detective sat, and John stood up to block her. Sherlock was draped in the armchair, legs crossed, elbow on the armrest, hand covering a smirk.
“John!!” Was what Sherlock could say, when he remembered to breathe.
“I’m perfectly capable of noticing if my voice changes. I can take the antibiotics myself! I’m not staying here!”
-Calm down, I’m home. SH
If you have not visited Dovahlock221's YouTube page, BakerEdits , do yourself a favor and do so now! You will experience her extraordinary talent for pairing the most precise lyrics to the scenes, making stories so vivid, you must be prepared with tissues, and chocolate and a teddy bear, for all the feelings they evoke!
“All children do. Anything else you would like to share?” Beverly asked.
-Yes. I need some help with the perp’s motives. We could have dinner. SH
“Earth to Sherlock?” John asked, and Sherlock actually gasped for air, he looked up at John. There was such longing in his eyes, John kneeled next to him, took his friend's face in his hands, and kissed him, oh so gently. It was glorious. The bolt of excitement, his lips, so supple, so male, the smell of evergreen from his soap was dizzying. His eyes, looking at him as if he were the lucky one. Sherlock was looking at a worn out, insignificant, useless soldier, as if John were a prize. Though he knew that if he wasn’t those things anymore, it was thanks to Sherlock.
‘Why what, Sherlock?”
Oh the git, didn’t he know that where he went, John would follow?
*******
“During a mission before Serbia, I lived in Sydney for a while. Distances were long, and public transportation wasn’t available to all the places I needed to go. A bike was a necessity. I grew quite fond of mine.”
Sherlock held up four fingers making sure John saw. He made his call, then came back to get in the cab with them.
“Sherlock?! Do those say… Adoption? Are they adoption papers?’’ her voice growing alarmingly higher and louder.
“No, coming back from a short business trip.” Sherlock answered, popping the last “p”.
Sherlock arrived, breathing harder than he would have liked, thinking he would have to work his lower body some more. John was cocky and full of himself from the win. “So, how does the posh boy feel when the army doctor can beat him up the hill, even being 5 years older than him?”
“Lt. Vasquez gave me the victims' clothes. Mendez may have disappeared a couple of weeks ago, but he said the personal belongings have not been touched by anyone other than himself.”
John couldn’t contain his smile. “Coming, your Highness, keep your shirt on!”
Then, the long awaited wedding. Everything finally comes together. The place, the clothes, the music, the officiant! John is truly the Conductor of Light and completely dazzles Sherlock! Mycroft has only one word to add. What Sherlock feared would be a dumb ceremony that would jinx the new relationship he and John have forged together turned out to be The Most Important Day In His Life, after all, thanks to his husband, Doctor John Watson- Holmes.
Sherlock said it with such drama and flair, Rosie couldn’t help herself, spit out some pastry and laughed her head off at the idea of her dads physically pushing and pulling Mycroft around, wearing a crown. The absolute best part was that her dads looked at her in surprise, then looked at each other and burst out laughing, too. For a moment there, they were themselves, like it had been before The. Cold. War.
“Why? Did your ‘date’ cancel on you?”  Sherlock’s brow was scrunched.
“So, Sherlock. What’s new?” Harry smirked, looking pointedly at their joined hands.
“That’s alright. I’ll text you later. Bye.”
Sherlock was smiling already at his enthusiasm. “Sure, I can always use an assistant.”
“Dylan, Lidia, you are doing well. You're working together, something artistic.w”
Beverly smiled, relieved. “That is a good step, John. Let’s hope he can acquire some skills to help him participate in a discussion without having a meltdown.”
Rosie itched to see Sherlock. She wanted to tell him all about Cardiff and Harry. She wanted him to see her hair. Pepsi and Nyla had gone crazy, Pepsi begging her parents to let her get a matching cut, too. To her disappointment, Sherlock didn’t come to pick her up, but Greg. Not that she didn’t like him: his sparkly expression at her hair was satisfying, just as was the stop for a milkshake and some playtime in the park; Jackson and Millie had been there. Once in the car again, Greg told her Sherlock wasn’t actually at Baker Street, but at Mycroft’s. He was feeling a little under the weather. Did she need something from home before going to Mycroft’s? They stopped by to get her sketchbook, as Mycroft always liked to see her new drawings. They said hello to Nana Hudson.
When John brooded a bit, Sherlock continued. “What do you like best about this location, dearest?”
*********
“Yes you were, a little. But so was I. EMS?”
********
John was horrified because Harry was right. And it was a bit of a revelation, wasn’t it. Made him think over the fight they just had. Sherlock had always had difficulty with irony and sarcasm. He could have difficulty finding words when put on the spot. He took things at face value, and in the end, John had been just flat out mean.  Sherlock had said John couldn’t tolerate him. If he wasn’t saying it as a tool for manipulating him, it had to mean that was how Sherlock had felt, and that had been the reason why he had thrown himself into cases. He had also said that John had withheld the physical part of their intimacy he had gotten so used to. It was true, John had been one of Sherlock’s few experiences with massages, cuddles, sleeping with a partner. John had cut everything off when he felt wronged. Sherlock had tried time and time again to reach out physically. God, what an idiot he had been!
They ran beyond the light filled avenue, the boy pulling him along as if he had forgotten about his existence, until they were clearly in a better area.
“I do now. I see I took him for granted, I ignored his need to feel secure in the relationship. And I punished him by withholding affection and sex.”
John groaned. He had known there would be an issue with those, though he had dared to hope she would forget them. They had been a present from Sherlock, her last birthday they were still together.
“I used to be, not sure about now…,” said John, with a grin.
“It’s John. He’s panicking. I’m still thinking about what happened. About what should I do?”
This chapter begins and ends with a concerned Big Brother. Mycroft knows Sherlock can be a pain, but he is his Little Brother. He may be the Ice Man, but the one constant in his life has been caring for Sherlock. He will not sit down idle and watch him be hurt. Meanwhile, John takes advantage of the location. They are after all, away from home, they are young and in love and, this story is and "E" one. Moriarty might have made an agreement of sorts with The English Government, but still has some things to say. Will it be enough to send Sherlock on a solo mission to stop him?
“We talked about my father being deeply homophobic, always saying that gay men aren’t “real men”. I had said I noticed that I have issues acting on my romantic feelings towards men. I deny them, I minimise them, and I can even project my insecurities on them and lash out at them.”
“More like testing me! She said yes there were renovations. The two of them slept on Mrs. Hudson’s sofa for months. She likes her bigger room, and she has a room for her friends to stay over. Oh, and Sherlock doesn’t have to go out to do her clothes. Rosie said he does the laundry himself and I know that’s a lie, because he’s a lazy berk who couldn’t be arsed to move a finger. That child didn’t say a word about it to me until I realised what I was looking at and asked her if that was how  221B looked like now.” John took a breath. “Sherlock never told you, Molly?”
“Seriously dearest, you are a doctor. Her roots are showing. She was happily being blonde. She had chamomile tea, instead of the coffee she loves. Her eyes have dark circles around them and her cheeks are slightly hollowed in, signs of gastric distress, yet she is at work, instead of staying home…,” he made a sign with his hand that John should finish his thought.
“Yes. We usually look up recipes online. If it comes out a winner, we’ll add it to our menu.”
“Only when Molly’s jaw dropped to the floor. Quite naughty of you to invite her and not tell her he was there.”
John looked pleased. “Such as?”
“Captain John H Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. Invalidated with honours. Originally from Westminster, graduated from Saint Bartholomew with High Honors. Mastered as a surgeon, currently working as a locum GP.”
“Yes, Luther. Nice young man, he is. He met Sherlock at a club where he is a DJ, he told me. Sherlock goes dancing there to meet up with him. Good old fashioned manners. A gentleman. One can tell he is very well educated.”
Though John had continued to date Gianna, it was just dating. He had told her he wasn’t ready for a new relationship and she said she understood. So when Greg invited him to his retirement party, he accepted, and called Molly to come with him. He was happy he did. They went to the ceremony and found the whole gang present, including Anderson. Greg’s three children were there, the boys with their significant others. Sherlock was there too, looking perfect in a bespoke light gray suit and a verdigris shirt, alone.
On a night like tonight, Luther almost wanted to throw caution to the wind and tell Sherlock he did want a relationship, that what they had could be so much better if they took one more step. It could be great, but  Iyana’s face kept coming up; both how she had been when she was just a girl and she told him she loved him for the first time, and when she told him he was free to go, to have his midlife crisis looking for men, since she was no longer enough. Luther knew he was not the only one with conflicted feelings towards his ex. That did not stop him from drying Sherlock’s tears, taking him home, in spite of his weak protests that he had to go back to Baker Street. They came together gently, softly, trying to erase the hurt his ex had left behind, like open wounds.
“How fucking progressive of them.” Sherlock didn’t have to deduce much. John had his little rage smile on and when he put the clothes aside, his hands went into fists, his eyes glaring at him from under bent eyebrows.
“An emergency of sorts” what did that mean? Had Harry been in danger, he would have said. Was this how it would be from now on? John would get to decide when he would allow Rosie to come to him? He had been right. He made John mad, now consequences. Rosie, coming home less and less, until it was home no more. He heard the front door
Later on, John took the miniature version of Sherlock, sulky and sighing her discontent, back to the flat, where he presented her with Risotto for dinner. “Ugh! This is gooey sticky rice with no flavor in it. I’m not hungry.” John thought of reasoning, then said “Suit yourself. I’ll leave it in the pot if you change your mind.”
This incredible story is definitely my favorite non-Johnlock one, to the point that I would be happy if Sherlock chose this relationship:
“Sherlock, this is us. I’m bi, 'obviously'. You are the first man I’ve ever had feelings for.”
“Oh Mrs. Hudson. Why? Why did it come to this?” John was about to cry. Mrs. Hudson then took pity on him and hugged him tight. “I don’t know, child. I can’t say where you two went so wrong. We will talk soon, but it’s better you head home now, I have my sweethearts to take care of.”
“Move along with the proceedings!”
Those eyes would haunt him, stare at him from a broken, fallen Sherlock. John hadn’t dreamt about the fall in years. Now he thought about the dead years. Sherlock had given John a  basic version about what he must have gone through. John’s dreams were now filling in the blanks, as he saw Sherlock suffering every kind of torture he could imagine. John would wake up, desperately searching for his other, and find himself alone in his flat, with Rosie in the bedroom. Being so alone would drive him crazy. He had to do something. As soon as was polite, he made a call.
he murmured in Spanish, his tongue roamed around its star like geography. “
“But you haven’t refused it either,” and he struggled again in John’s arms. But, John noticed, not strong enough to break free.
A beautiful woman turned and gave him a scorching once over. “Dr Watson?”
“What was it like when she returned? Was there a rekindling of their relationship? Your friendship?’
********
“I’m quite sure you could have just said something to her. She will undoubtedly appreciate your change of style. Sarah has always wanted you back, John.”
And that's all she wrote! My deepest thanks to all my readers! I hope the story entertained you or kept you company. Please know that your comments and kudos have lifted my spirits and made the experience of sharing this story of mine an unforgettable one.  I have been honoring the stories that have meant so much to me, and so many have not been featured. So I will add a few more, of those that I read on repeat, when I need a friend.
“Well I did come to the beach with some Uni boys. My roommate and his friends. I got badly sunburned while looking for seashell samples. Also, I had been 4 months sober, unfortunately, a friend of my flatmate thought I needed chemical assistance and slipped me an ecstasy pill. I did not have a good reaction to it.”
So John stayed back for a while, giving Sherlock space to pick up his things, and watching Dr. Sternbach come to take him to the tube. Then he wandered out again, and sat at the seaside, in shock, unable to put his thoughts in order. Sherlock was right, he had not deserved to be told any part of this by someone else. John had been afraid of him taking it badly and look at the results. He should have told Sherlock the whole truth when he was first offered the job. He had not intended to accept it, but to bring it to London. Now, he most probably had undone months of work.
“Good morning! “ He greeted.
Harry started the conversation in a bull by the horns kind of way. She recounted John and Rosie’s arrival to Cardiff and how upset Rosie had been. They talked about John and their fight over the school papers and how it had escalated. Sherlock told her a sanitized, though not much, account of the night he ended up at Mycroft’s, the depression and the therapy with Dr. Quentin. He also confessed he hadn’t told any of this to John.
“What does that have to do with anything! My name is on the paper! This is some stupid mistake…”
"My foot? It’s fine…? Ah, a patient.”
“Yes, love?” he said
“Have you broken up?” Not good. That came out sounding more eager than expected.
-Yes, Sherlock a date. Cycling through the park. Then crepes, with strawberries and cream. 8:30 because Mike picks Rosie up at 7:30 that day.
“It seems the two of you should have an open dialogue about these last months, talk about things you have learned, things you are doing, where you are in terms of each other.”
“He changed the game when he threatened you John. I have talked to Mycroft. He didn’t like it, but he will assemble contingency plans, should there be the need to go against Moriarty. He is anticipating the man is much more powerful than we thought. Moriarty certainly has connections in the United States and probably in Eastern Europe…”
by your posture, your italian suit, your attitude, and your ‘concern’ for Sherlock, that you are his brother Mycroft. Everything you said about me is correct. What happened today was not Sherlock’s fault. We were packing up our things from my bedsit, to take to Baker Street, when Sherlock was taken. The particulars about it are for Sherlock to disclose to you. Now if you would allow me, I would like to find out how he’s doing.”
John turned around and hugged him. “I hate all the times I told you we were broken up. I told you that the very day you started up with him, didn’t I?”
John and I needed a stay in hospital. I had a psychotic break, precipitated by the drugs in my system. I believed Culverton Smith’s daughter was my sociopathic sister, and thought the hospital Mycroft took me to was a mental ward created specifically for me by her. I thought I pulled a gun on my brother, when I was really waving a scalpel around. I was sedated, and when I woke up alone, I managed to sneak out of my room and into John’s, thinking I had to rescue him from my “sister”. His condition was similar to mine. Only he had hallucinated Mary taking a bullet for me at the aquarium.  When I broke into his room, he got up from his bed and beat me up thoroughly. I had to be taken to the ICU. I was there for three days, when Culverton Smith came to try to kill me, and John, who had been discharged had come to visit, saw him sneaking in my room, and saved my life. Smith’s crimes were discovered, he went into custody. I believe he still gave interviews confessing to his crimes for many years after he was imprisoned, until the inmates got tired of listening to him gloat, and killed him.
“A pity, but to be expected. ‘I’m Gonna Be”
The thought of Sherlock watching gay porn, and opening himself up in the shower, made most of his blood rush south, and he had to breath against the dizziness. “How should we do it then love?” John asked, and Sherlock turned around, lay on his back. John sat between Sherlock’s open legs and kissed his thigh, making Sherlock tremble. He slicked his hands with lube, blew on his hands to warm it up. Then he engaged one hand in caressing Sherlock’s perineal area, rubbing with just the right pressure. The other hand gently introduced a finger through the rim of flesh that he indeed found had been opened somewhat.
********
“Yes, he texted me to bring them down, because you were coming with.”
********
“Yes, pending interviews. I will appreciate your company, John. The investigated person will not take well to me.”
“Your husband looks very much like my father, when he was forty-something. Your boy is adorable. I have a little girl, Rosalie. Here she is with John, my… um, doctor?, ex-partner?, boyfriend?” Even Sherlock looked confused with the explanation, but Wilson only smiled.  “Sometimes us doctors are complicated to live with. I went through three marriages, Howard one, before we got together.”
Sherlock went to bed with a man other than John, for the first time in 9 years. They stood in the room next to the bed. Luther was big. And gentle, and kind. When Luther took off his shirt, and exposed that toned, gorgeous chest and those strong arms, Sherlock remembered what desire felt like. Just plain
John was also furious; with himself for having thought this would be easy and with the git for being well impossible. “Am I to understand you do not desire to continue being my partner? Are we back to co-parents?" He asked in the calmest voice he could muster.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sorry, what was that sweetheart?” John smiled
They talked for a while about different possibilities, but Sherlock was, after all, hurt and exhausted, and had just had sex with John for the first time. That thought made John smile. Greg noticed. He also saw Sherlock falling asleep on the sofa. During a case. Unprecedented.
“Mmhn, ok…,” Rosie said, coming to him anyway to kiss him and put her small hand on his shoulder. “...sorry you are so confused.”
“I know. We don’t have to. I’m not a virginal girl scared by sex with my ex-lover of years!! Furthermore, I do not appreciate you bringing this up in the street. Manners, John.”  Sherlock hissed.
by darcylindbergh. Please have tissue at hand. Oh the pain! However this story is a thing of beauty! I have read it repeatedly and its well worth the tears.
“John!!”
Oh what a night!! It’s Rosie’s night! Not only does Sherlock get to see Rosie sing at school! He also gets a dinner with friends and family at Angelo’s and a surprise.  Then there is a night, a lovely night. Then some not so lovely days. The men finally talk and they revisit “The Fight” that started it all. There is hope here!
Sherlock looked up, with such an expression of confusion, apparently unable to talk. John got up, and fluffled the pillows. He pulled the covers back, turned on the small lamp and turned off the lights. Then he invited Sherlock in and he went, on the bed, into his arms.
Sherlock was stunned into silence. Then, “Had she been a true professional, she could have handled the situation better. That said, I never submitted any formal complaint. About my more personal life, that has noth…”
“Did, but I came back, boss.”  Sherlock’s eyebrow moved minimally at that last word.
Sherlock sighed. John was prone to accuse him of oversharing with outsiders. “The evidence proved there were no valid reasons to continue my involvement.”
That night, a soak in the jacuzzi along with some bubbly champagne was in store, along with some footsie. That lead to John confessing to Sherlock he had thought he had looked stunning at breakfast. “I was actually jealous there for a bit, you know.”
Molly gasped. “He calls Sherlock - baby?” she asked.
An eternity went by and silence on the phone. John could picture Sherlock blinking in his “error” mode.
“I’m yours Sherlock. I’m always thinking about you, always wanting to be with you, always wanting you.  We can do this now? Please Sherlock.”
John sighed. They had been doing so well. “Sherlock, yes there has been an offer…,” Sherlock stood up, to start walking. John caught up to pull him by the arm and Sherlock pulled it away, John got in front of him to try to stop him, Sherlock tried to push him aside. ‘He. Can’t. Leave. I. Will. Lose. Him.’  John’s frantic mind screamed. In desperation, he put his heel to Sherlock’s knee, bringing them both to the sandy ground. John tried to hold him down. Sherlock grappled.
“John, why aren’t we there yet? It’s taking too long.”
Then John received a text from Sherlock and lost further interest in being out, as he wondered why Sherlock had chosen today of all days to finally communicate, even if only for a case and ask what he had, but Angie wanted to go to a club for drinks, after, so they went to one close to the theater, that didn’t have too long a queue. The bar was on a tier, so if they wanted they could see the dancers and the DJ.
-Would you consider takeaway and one of those ridiculous movies? SH
********
Sherlock then slipped on him, aligning their cocks and they rubbed together until the friction was driving John crazy “you-your hand, Sherlock”
“Well, I don’t have actual cravings anymore. They only came upon due to what I thought I wanted at the time. Now that Watson and I can still have our days together, I don’t really want to...I want to be here for her.”  He said. “I do still think about it, that an end might have been easier for all involved, but I will not do that to my girl. My thought processes are still off. I’m always tired. But how talking about it in a cold office with a pompous stranger can possibly help, eludes me.” Sherlock sighed
“Aha! So it was intentional! I didn’t know you were a matchmaker. Sneaky.”
Not good, not good, what had happened? John had been smiling, happy when he wrapped his hands and they practiced with the teardrop bags. He had been laughing while the trainer talked about Sherlock’s mixed martial arts sneak attacks. Now, when they were in the ring for sparing, he looked about to faint. When Sherlock approached him, John’s eyes were unfocused, scaring him badly, but he came to, pale and unsteady. Sherlock took him off the ring, got water and they sat down. John was looking at his face. It clicked. That had been so long ago.
The Curly One responded; “Well, since we did have quite a repertoire of activities built up, you might want to narrow it down, John."
********
“Talk to him, be very specific about what a relationship means for you. See what you are both willing to do for it to work. If this is the person you want to be with, that you can’t stop thinking about, then take that step. Better that you know you gave it your all, than to think ‘I should have’ further on.” Sherlock said, surprising himself.
Also I must include a marvelous series which I go back to again and again! it includes the only Mary (Well here Maryam Murstini, which is who Mary only wishes she was)
“So, you avoided getting in a car with John, and went with Luther and had sex instead. In avoiding your feelings for John, are you escalating your relationship with Luther?”
Three hours later, Rosie was dozing at Mrs. Hudson’s. Sherlock had told her everything, because with one look she had known something was terribly wrong. He had taken Watson’s temperature, checked her throat, which was not inflamed or red. Looked into her ears with his small light and was pretty sure he found the culprit. He gave her paracetamol and texted his findings to John telling him to bring antibiotics. Watson confessed she hadn’t felt well since the day before last, but hadn’t wanted to tell John in fear he wouldn’t let her come to Sherlock.
“What is ‘it’?”
The HAPPYs are here!! There will be birthday celebrations, when John will have a long held dream come true!! It is a surprise for Sherlock and Rosie and they will both be so excited! There will be lovely family fun.
John moved his head no, and Rosie cried; “He’s taking me away from my father!!...”
Sherlock reacted by getting into John’s personal space. His face flushed with anger and breathing harshly. He might have looked menacing to anyone else, but John knew him too well. The genius was out of rude comebacks. “Answer please.” John asked.
They did make it in time, to the relief of the cab driver. Sherlock needed help up the stairs, and unerringly made it to the loo, as John turned on the telly, and put on tea. Rosie was safe and sound at Mike’s, with Mel and Pepsi. Sherlock made it out of the bathroom, still drunk, a little green, but more himself.
“Come sweetheart, let’s have some liquid courage.” Daddy prepared two double whisky neats. Sherlock downed his immediately and dad gave him another. “Now that should do it, no need to get plastered. I don’t think your John would like that. Now, Sherlock, If I survived almost 50 years of marriage to your mother, you will be fine with Dr. Watson. He loves you. I never doubted that.”
A deathly low voice, barely above a whisper: “A form without my name on it? Why? When were you going to tell me, when I’d made a complete arse of myself at her school? Will you at least tell them now that I can take her home? If you will allow it, that is.” The absolute worst was that Rosie had been able to hear most of it, and what she didn’t hear, she filled in with her imagination. It had been a quiet ride to Bakers Street, with Rosie feverish and Sherlock agonizing.
“Well no. He’s the one who left.”
Sherlock was looking at the floor, and his fingers were drum, drum, drumming on his thigh. He took a deep breath, “Incidentally John, I have a couple of questions for you: First, why did you hit him? You know I’m used to being called all sorts of epithets, it never bothers me. Second, why did you call me your ‘partner’? You broke up with me. Besides, you never called me that to begin with. I was always your ‘best friend’.”
John looked alarmed for a moment, then took in what this looked like. He laughed, pulled a chair next to Sherlock, and put a hand on his back. “This is Rosie’s night. This has to do strictly with her. She doesn’t know about this bit yet. Please, look at this. I would like you to fill this out. If you want to. If you don't, nothing will change. Just…” John took the papers out of the envelope and presented them to Sherlock.
“Sweetheart, why don’t you just ask him to stay? You have a beautiful home waiting for him.” she said to Sherlock.
Trying to keep it together, John said: “Oh, so you are the one who makes things happen, aren’t you? I wasn’t aware we had a song.”
“Yes, Mrs Hudson. I have to believe. He has changed the way he reacts to our relationship. He’s proud of us now. He told all of his army friends, his remaining family. He published it on the blog. He has gone back to being admiring, and supportive. He wants to spend the rest of his life with me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Coming,” Harris said and they heard the sirens.
Something was wrong. He felt it. Just one more hour and he could pick Watson up from school. His skin itched, his arms, his scalp. The lights were too bright. He could hear Mrs. Hudson clinking the spoon on the rim of her teacup downstairs. He had trouble staying still.
“I don’t ...yet. I want to. Stop me. I want to overdose. Mycroft. But she said don’t do something stupid.”

any longer” and moved himself and Watson out.
John had done the check in, so all they had to do was go to the room.
“Sherlock, you should be dressed honey, are you alright?” Daddy, the last person he had expected. “All the ladies retired to get beautiful. They kind of forgot us, I think.”
“Doing just fine without me. I have missed way too many dances with you.”
“I should have known Mike would think of you first. Nice to see you still do cases for the new D.I’s.” Sherlock doggedly refused to look directly at him.
“Ah ah - no time for that now. Go get him, tiger!!”
John screamed his name. Too late.
He would have cried, but apparently his emotions were off. He finally found  John’s texts.
“John!" Sherlock called from where he was crouched down “assembling” his team during practice time. John came to him, having just left an enchanted Rosie with the instructor.
John nodded, still upset. Sherlock and his trainer, Art, gave him a good show. John could tell Sherlock had made the best of his training, he had a powerful punch and a knack for connecting the hits effectively. He was great at defense, even applying what Art had said, illegal mixed martial art moves. Never one for following the rules, his Sherlock. After the sparring match John did feel better. He punched a full body bag, while Sherlock kicked at a banana one.
John asked around until he knew where to find him. A bunch of doctors drinking mimosas and looking at the pool. John approached them. One of the Coswell doctors was standing next to the man. At one point, he might have mattered, but not now. “John!” Dr. Peters said. “Let me introduce you to Dr. Colin Fazel; one of our researchers…”
“I will get myself into a more comfortable position for a good pounding, if you are so inclined,” Sherlock said.
Rosie had long decided that experiments were better done at 221B. John was just too fussy. Sherlock, on the other hand, reminded her of proper scientific method, and let her be. He was handy helping with the clean up, even if John didn’t believe it. So on Thursday, after school she and Sherlock were heading to the stores to find some of the things for the experiment. Nyla was coming for a sleepover the next night. A first in the new flat! Once at the store, they found Nyla, and her mom, Charlie. Rosie nudged Sherlock, who reluctantly went to say hello
“It’s me John…” said Sherlock and his voice was all wrong. It immediately made John’s heart heavy and he felt chilled.
“Are you dense? Come to bed…”
“Baby, how much do you remember about last night?”
A thank you to my dearest
So Daddy Holmes let Sherlock take his arm, and he walked him outside, to the back, filled with flowers, happy people and fairy lights. Where Mike Stamford stood, with fairy lights behind him, making him look as if he had a halo. Mycroft stood at the right, smiling for once, with Greg next to him, so happy. On the other side were Mrs Hudson and Meghan, looking especially gorgeous. Mummy came up to kiss Sherlock and then try to wipe the lipstick away, causing Sherlock to close his eyes and breathe deeply.
“John doesn’t think so. He keeps cringing in the mornings when he sees me.” she said smiling. “But Sherlock. Are you sick? You look tired.”
“Never again. This time we will always say what we need. And we listen to the other.” John held Sherlock’s face in his hand now.
“No love. I got you.”
The rest of the day was happy, with the girls, and Mummy heating up the leftovers from the evening before for lunch. Mrs Hudson stepped aside with Sherlock. “Young man, is there anything you feel you want to tell me?”
-Quite a lot yesterday, then.
“As I said a friendship born of similar circumstances. She is quite done with London, and with what she considers is you giving in to your family’s every whim. She doesn’t know you have a son.” At this, John wrinkled his brow, and Lizbeth buried her face in her hands.
“Are you ‘friends’ with Dad, too?”
“Is that what you and John are doing? Renovating?’ asked the therapist.
“Oh I got the itches, real bad. The doctors just said it was the life. What with me smoking and that but I knew it wan’t just that. My arms looked like it had scales on em.”
“Funny that, since it’s exactly how I feel”
“Hey stranger! Long time no see! Where are you coming from? Couldn’t get through to you these last few days. Weren’t you supposed to be boxing?” Greg was just full of questions
Here are some of the articles I based the case on:
John took him in his hand, and stroke as he thrust. Sherlock came, his face a portrait of pleasure, arching his body up, almost knocking John off. The Captain was done for when he saw his partner, his face a portrait of pleasure and debauchery , and felt the muscles contract and squeeze him, and came hard, his mind wiping out. He came back to Sherlock pulling him towards his body desperately, his breath hitching, trying to roll into himself. John disengaged and Sherlock curled into a ball, breath shallow and too fast. His face in John’s chest. He was trembling.
“Sherlock worked too?” Said John “I thought you girls were supposed to do it alone.”
John didn’t hear from him for the next two weeks. In his spare, non Rosie nights, he had taken to drawing his comics. He had one of him and Sherlock eating indian food. He also made one of Rosie and Nyla, curling the dolls’ hair. His favorite was one of Sherlock, with a small smile on his face, telling a distraught Rosie she had been brave. He also made a ‘serious’ sketch of Sherlock, his face while John had been talking about his mistakes. Sherlock’s expression of disbelief. John wanted it as a reminder of just how much work he had to do. He compared it to the picture he had taken of Sherlock covered in bubbles, smiling happily. That’s how he wanted to make Sherlock feel. Safe and happy.
“You’ve come back to me John. You are sure?” His voice was low and rough.
As Sherlock looked over his shoulder at Rosie jumping enthusiastically with her friends, John saw a big man’s face illuminate with a smile. This was Jackson’s grandfather, a very tall, buff man. Dark skin, black hair cut very short, with some gray woven in it. Shiny eyes brimming with happiness. '‘Do I know him?’’ crossed his mind, thinking maybe he had seen him at school.
********
“Oi, you git! It could have been Rosie I was talking to! Go get dressed!” John snickered.
Mike was being unreasonable, though Sherlock had expected as much when he called. “Mike I’m not asking you to run around chasing anybody! I would just like you to come and interview a couple of individuals from my homeless network! I haven’t gotten any new leads in this case, and Donovan will close it if I don’t find something for her to work with!
“I see. Bit not good to insinuate you slept with her, though.”
“Sherlock when did this happen? It’s not looking good at all! Was this that brawl you got into with the art robbery accomplices last week?”
“Cocaine, John. Lestrade won’t let me work cases unless I’m clean, and Mrs Hudson prefers tenants that are not junkies.”

is the best and funniest Wilson/Sherlock crossover!
“Ready, baby?”  Sherlock nodded, closing his eyes and his hand over Luther’s.
“So loyal of you to say that,” he singsonged, and then his voice changed. “Wake up. I will kill you and I will skin you. John Watson I will burn the heart out of you! And then I will take Sherlock and keep him for my own. He will be happier with me than he ever was with you.”
“Maybe. Think about it John. Did you know someone with a tiger tattoo?” Sherlock asked John.
******
Sherlock had to admit this had been one of the better meetings he had ever had with his brother as adults. Gavin must be rubbing off on him. Then a thought. How did Mycroft know Rosie dreamed of changing her name to ‘Rosalie’? Oh, of course, they were friends.
Both men got dressed in a hurry. Sherlock was not successful in taming his hair, but they managed to be presentable in a short time. They came out the door and Lestrade was sitting in Sherlock’s chair, looking like the cat who caught the cream. As soon as Sherlock saw him he said, “Shut up!”
“He did say he was willing to follow me anywhere, but I declined.” Joaquin looked miserable.
Rosie had gotten a couple more of those notes. They now totaled five. All of them found at school. Some of them were in paper, some on her school computer account. They had something to do about her- about Mary. At first she had thought some kid was doing it, she was well aware some of her peers thought she was the teacher’s pet, and queer for having two dads. But the notes “sounded" too much for just one of the idiot kids. There had been one with “What job did your good ole mum have before she married your Da? Do you know?” The latest one read “What kind of mother leaves her newborn with an alcoholic and a junkie?”
“Your clothes are dark and edgy, but pricey. Your shoes are high end, Dylan. Your arms have sleeve tattoos. Your haircut is grown-up and very modern. You have higher education, sat at a graphic design class. Lidia, you have tattoos on your forearms, your shoulders and your wrist, which would make it difficult to cover up for a job such as a teacher, a nurse or an office assistant. Your hair and nails are professionally cared for, and you have opted to colour your modern cut with blue tips. It suits you well. You are comfortable around each other and are over the early stage of need to touch in your relationship, and I distinctly remember how artistically talented you are. You have done very well for yourselves.”
Sherlock was in awe. He retrieved the suit, and really looked at it for the first time. Molly had helped him pick the off white jacket and the white shirt. Light grey trousers. There was a deep blue green bow tie, and matching blue green socks, and a pair of gray shoes. He held the shoes in his hands, surprised; Dad just smiled and said “Mycroft”. He put the clothes on, with Daddy helping him with the cuffs, placing some of his own cuff links on them. He helped Sherlock put the bow tie on. Then Daddy looked at him, and his eyes filled with moisture. “You look so handsome, my boy.”

“It was good watching you in action after so long.” said John, aware that Sherlock looked at him with his eyebrow raised. “You want to go somewhere? I’m rather peckish.” said John, taking a chance.
John was rewarded by Sherlock bringing his whole body closer, plastering himself on John, sniffing, kissing and then probing John’s scar with his tongue. This was so unexpected, so sensual, that John groaned, and Sherlock stopped, got up and looked at him in alarm. “Am I doing it wrong? Am hurting you?”
“John, what is this? You are not gay, you…”
“Oh baby, that was so good, you are beautiful baby, so gorgeous, so good.” The man’s evident happiness, his praise and the way he looked at him made Sherlock feel good about the experience. He could feel himself smiling. Luther got up to the loo to wash himself up and brought wipes for Sherlock. “You can stay, alright?  Nobody is going to bother us here.” Sherlock was quite overwhelmed by his first John free orgasm in so long, that he surprised himself by falling asleep in Luther’s big, strong arms. It had been so long since he was held like this, since someone stroked his hair and made sure he was under the covers. The big man woke him up in the morning by stroking a different part of him, slipping a condom on him and taking him in his mouth, fitting all of him and sucking just right, then sucking just at the tip, and it had been so long since he had been on the receiving end of this particular act that it was almost over way too soon. The last time John had...Nope. Shut that thought down. It was certainly mind blowing, his head blanking out of everything. Later, Sherlock took a shower and shared a coffee and toast breakfast with Luther. He asked Sherlock for his phone and put his number in it.
John rubbed his eyes before looking up.
“...But it doesn’t work like that!! You know it, you have to come to the Yard and fill out that paperwork!! Or at least let me bring it here, and dictate your answers!!!” Greg was exasperated. Sherlock had been impossible all week.
John’s senses were suddenly all awake. “Excuse me what? Breakfast?”
“Why are you texting me comments about your day? We haven’t done that in a long time.”
John went to the loo, to get flannel to clean them up with, and a towel. Sherlock was already falling asleep. John thought the day must have been exhausting for him, with all the people and the ceremony and the dancing. He had done so well! John’s mind went through the wedding as he held his sleeping husband. Harry had been and looked superb. Meg had been a rock, helping him every step of the way. Mrs Hudson had been thrilled to be a witness, and Sherlock’s first dance. She had told him how Daddy Holmes had helped Sherlock calm down and make it to the wedding. Mycroft had found a way to pay for most of the arrangements, and John knew he had donated to the causes the River Boys supported. He and Greg had danced and entertained Mummy. Donovan looked happy for once, looking very beautiful, with her date, DI Rodriguez. He looked totally besotted. Dr Quentin and Dr Gates, had come together, arm in arm and danced, and drank, and at the end of the evening, Beverly’s head had been on Ian’s shoulder. That made John ridiculously happy. Everything made him ridiculously happy. The look on his husband’s eyes when he and the girls had danced down the aisle! Sherlock had danced. With everyone apparently!
******
He poured out two cups of coffee, making hers the way she liked it. “Is that what girlfriends do? Feed you up?”*
John tackled him and started to tickle him. Sherlock laughed out loud, sending the wolves back into the security of their den. Sherlock got up and escaped John, running towards the road. He held out his hand and made signs to John, yelling “The bus is coming John, hurry up!”
“Not talking anymore, schatz?” said the man. “You don’t like me to share you with my friends?”
on YouTube. Thank you all for reading!!
John walked through the park, looking for Rosie. This was good. He could at least take over the socialising part for Sherlock. Already he had greeted half a dozen parents who knew him by name. He saw Rosie, laughing, chasing bubbles. As he walked towards her, he looked around for Sherlock. He really shouldn’t be too far away. Rosie turned and yelled something to someone behind her and a multitude of bubbles surrounded her. John finally saw Sherlock and his heart jump started. He was holding a giant bubble machine, making hordes of bubbles go up and over the children. Sherlock was looking at the bubbles, and enveloped in a cloud of them, smiling faintly. John let go the breath he had been holding, the vision was all the truth he needed. He loved this beautiful, impossible, intolerable man. He would never be able to stop. They had to talk. Maybe the party could be their opportunity.
He felt his heart restart when he heard “Sh-Sherlock? Is it really you?”. Now he saw the fluff of her curls, and her eyes, looking at him from the small top shelf of the closet, hidden behind the Styrofoam peanuts and the crepe paper. He had to get a chair to stand on to help her down. Rosie clung to him, as Ms. Ruiz came running in to see what was going on in her art room.
That was then, this was now. Sherlock was the smartest, most extraordinary man in the world, and he wanted John. Sherlock could find a lover closer to himself in class, or fortune, or intelligence. John may not have too much time to share his feelings. So he would show his detective he most definitely could make a man feel loved.
“Classic tell! And pleased to meet you,” said the man. He pointed at the coffee machines at the breakfast buffet. “Are you heading for coffee? I’m starving, but nothing in the buffet looks appetizing at all. Any suggestions?”
Sherlock thought Charlie made sense, though he recognized it was what he wanted to hear.
“Yes, Molly, the bloke currently shagging my ex is bloody gorgeous! Happy? Want a picture? Because I’m pretty sure “baby” can show you one!!” Drink down.
-John, there has been another suicide. Come immediately to Covent Gardens Conference Center. SH
“Cheeky git.” mumbled John, as he kissed his way down Sherlock’s chest and belly, finally taking his love’s length in his mouth and rendering him breathless. John teased, kissing the tip, licking the length, sucking softly, until Sherlock was writhing on the bed, holding on to the pillow and the sheet, moaning and talking incoherently. John’s slick hand took over, playing with the pressure and friction, as his mouth released him, after a nice long suck, smiling at the affronted look he got from the detective. “I said I wanted to do everything.” John smiled.
Sherlock looked up at him, red rimmed eyes. “Oh nothing new. My brother came to visit, and remind me that he is the one constant in my life, constant pain in the arse. Mother has given up on me, for leaving University, didn’t even ask how I was when he told her he found me. Mycroft said I’ll inevitably end up in rehab, or worse, if I insist on ‘playing around at that detective thing.’”
“It wouldn’t have been fair of him to ask me to thin my caseload while he accepts a position for a program in a town three hours away.”
-John. Your daughter has your mouth. This kind of vocabulary may not be conducive to a harmonic interaction. I will attempt to defuse the situation. In the future, please refrain from trashing Rosie’s objects without her knowledge, especially those with the apis mellifera on them. SH
Mike laughed and then said, “Listen, I was thinking about what you said; that you would need a flatmate, to make ends meet. I know a bloke who has his sights on a sweet place in Marylebone. He’s something of an eccentric genius, bit of a scientist, and maybe a bit anti-social, but I consider him a good lad. He also needs a flatmate. Too bad I’ve been having trouble finding him lately.”
“Who gave you the right to take my name off Rosie’s list! What in bloody hell John!” Sherlock had walked straight towards John and was currently screaming in his face.
“Over to Loughborough Park, some old blokes living close by are willing to talk to you. A couple of agents investigating the scene found some clothes, but not much more. We have a specialist going over some of the victim’s belongings.”
The boy deflected the older one’s punch, and hit him on the kidney instead. Before the big man could take a breath, the boy clapped the man’s face, pulling his ears, punched his jaw, and delivered two hard punches to his solar plexus. As the man wobbled trying to catch his breath, the boy hit his jaw again, dislocating it. Then he took a step back, raised both his arms, almost like a dancer, getting ready to twirl, and brought them down forcefully, while delivering a powerful kick to the man’s lower chest, rendering him unconscious.
“Not the most romantic of starts, but it still got you to be a couple. Still an upgrade from ‘best friends’. You were happy, right?” Harry sat on the carpet, legs crossed, holding her bottle of ginger beer.
John used the cane as a baton, having hit the first man on the head hard enough to knock him out, now he was fighting the two other men. The boy came out of the shadows. Free of his attackers, he tapped the man he had been talking with on the shoulders, threw what looked like a small baggie at his face, surprising him, and connected a good right to his jaw.
Sherlock muttered something, gave Luther a quick kiss goodbye and left, without being able to thank him, for picking him, for being kind and understanding, for not expecting what Sherlock couldn’t offer. And he had understood. Yes, it was John. He couldn’t carry on with Luther when he had been calling John out loud and in his mind all along. John who now seemed intent on texting him and waiting around at Mrs. Hudson when he dropped Rosie off so Sherlock had to see him. Sherlock would not falter, though. He had no intention to be John’s fallback when he was in between girlfriends.
“Well done, Watson. That was truly brilliant, how you hid in a safe place and managed to call me! You are so brave, little bee.” Rosie took a watery breath and hid her face in his neck. When she had calmed down some, Sherlock talked to her in a gentle voice, “Little Bee, could you please show me the notes you have received? They must be in your school bag.”

“Oh, I understand that, baby, though it would have been nice to see you.”
“What about the anger. No violent incidents? You told me you had beaten up Sherlock in the past.”
“I love you. You are my dad. I don’t remember mother. She is dead. I just want you and John, if you could hurry up and get back together, I would be most thankful.” she stated.
-You’ll be Mycroft’s best man. Will you dress like him? Bet you you’ll wear it better.
“Listen. Tell that man that he better stop flirting with my boyfriend, or I will give him broken phalanges for his brazenry…”
John quietly thanked his therapists, present and past, and any guiding spirit that might have allowed him to be calm and patient at this moment. He quietly stepped in front of Sherlock, placed his hand firmly around the wrist at Sherlock’s hip and the other around Sherlock’s wrist close to his eyes, bringing them together. “Breathe with me,” he directed, and Sherlock, despite an epic eye roll, did.
“You would be alright with me staying? I don’t want to impose.”
“Um no. I thought you were going to do it. Why?’
Sherlock stared at him for a moment: “It wasn’t an option John, after…”
John said he knew a couple of men, but he couldn’t remember why any of them would have something against him.
Rosie and Mrs Hudson came back on the same day, both overjoyed with the news, both so happy to see them back together and resume being the Baker Street family they were meant to be.
“No hospital,” said Sherlock in a small voice. “John, please”.
To you who read this story, who kudoed, commented, bookmarked it, know that you are thanked, for looking at these characters, getting to know this story, maybe thinking about how much longer they can be idiots, or being happy for them as they get it together. You have made this experience so much better, and you have helped me soldier on. Thank you.
Today's inspiring story is
“How could I? He didn’t want the people we worked with to know and put each other in more danger. Our friends, they knew” John had thought back to this part over and over again.
“Oh, my God! Of course! You are that John Watson! Sorry doctor, I have a mate back home with your same name. It’s pretty common over there. I did hear about your blog when he came back from his “time away”. Let’s go say ‘hello’.”
“Although I personally think running away is an idiotic way to resolve problems, I understand how your average intellect may believe it a comforting solution. I will differ with you in that I do not neglect Watson and I consider her of the utmost importance. I will also sustain I have attempted to show you affection multiple times, only to be rejected once and again. Therefore, John Watson, you are free to do whatever you please. Far be it from me to hold you to a person who can’t perform to your liking and whom you are uncomfortable to be around.”
*At some point he must have fallen asleep because Sherlock woke him up, minty breathed, kissing him, his lips, his face, his scar.
Rosie had a box at 221B somewhere, with pictures from their wedding, an invitation, a swan napkin and pictures of mother with baby. Some other stuff, more than certain. Mary had rarely been a topic of conversation in her home with two dads. They took up all the space in her heart and in her mind. If she wanted a mother on mother’s day, she had Nana Hudson and Grandma Violet. She remembered being very little and asking Dad about how he met mom, and how they fell in love. That had eventually changed into her asking about Sherlock. It was only now, with this stupid little white notes, that she got to thinking about her jean mother, no genetic mother. Why would she have to worry about being like her?
“Yep!! She stayed over, because it was her day with Nyla…” She looked at John’s startled face and added hurriedly, ”...Sherlock was so good! We heard them talking and laughing when we were..um...falling asleep!”
***********
“We have some talking that should have been done a long time ago. Only never, in my wildest dreams, did I ever think it would be me listening to you, and not the other way around.”
After their climb, they left Luther and Jackson in favor of searching for ice cream.  They each got a cone, and Rosie took hers and went to join Pepsi on a queue for face painting. Sherlock realised John had not known about his meltdown and the real reasons for his stay at Mycroft’s. He had thought either Mike or Lestrade would have told John. He was grateful neither had. He did not want his ex partner to pity him. Left by themselves, John quickly brought up the Yard and DI Donovan. Sherlock told him some stories about Hoyt, the newest Anderson. The two ended up laughing at the unbelievable antics Donovan had to put up with. It was almost like old times.
“While I must admit I have by force gotten used to lower cases and cold cases. I still can’t see myself retired, waiting for John to go back and forth from Coswell."
“You talk about the Yard?”
He moved cautiously, took down Sherlock’s pyjamas and his pants. Sherlock stirred, but didn’t wake. Perfect. He only had experience on the receiving end of this particular act, and he had taken some time to figure out his plan. Now, he carried it out, having a much easier time than he had imagined, happy in making Sherlock wake up and squeal, “John!” and try to tell him he didn’t have to do that, just to lose his words again. John acted out the things that he liked, the playing with the bollocks, stroking, fondling and taking them into his mouth one by one, the helping hand, the varied tempo. In no time, John had Sherlock begging, trying so hard not to thrust, not to grab him by the hair. One powerful suck at the end, had Sherlock coming without being aware he had been so close, so John swallowed, then realised he himself was so hard, pulling his pants down almost did him in. Sherlock gave him four hard strokes, and John was done for.
