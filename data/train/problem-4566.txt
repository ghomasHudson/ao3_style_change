“When am I not?!” Dean looked back at him as he put his jacket on.
“Dean. Thank you.” Cas smiles up at Dean and puts down the stitches he was about to use so he could hold Dean’s hand again. So much for hygiene and contamination.
“Need I remind you the number of times you’ve died Dean?” Dean sighs
“You’ll be safe?”
“How bad is it, and how did you make it back by yourself?” he finds it in one of their kitchen cabinets and brings it over to Dean. As he opens it Dean contemplates telling Cas how he made it back without passing out. It was him, it was always Cas. Dean knew he had Cas at home, waiting for him with open arms and soft touches. He couldn’t pass out at the wheel, he had to get back to his Cas. Castiel begins wiping off the dried blood and some of the fresher blood still seeping out of the cuts on Dean. He had a large cut on his left cheek and gashes all over his chest. Cas makes a note for later to not let Dean fight werewolves without his supervision. He hated seeing Dean like this.
Then Jo drags Sam over by the shoulder and they're both hanging off of each other's shoulders to stay upright (How does that work?) and snickering like the annoying kid siblings they were.
“But I’m a man,” and Dean really wants to have not just said that because… reasons.
He feels bad when he pushes Cas away by the shoulders. (Cas doesn't resist the push, he
he wants to. He wants to be cared for, and Cas is right here and Cas is looking at him like
"Alright, you can keep it, just don't let me catch you glued to the screen." she teased, pointing a finger at him in accusation. He pocketed the phone.
, especially one from this long ago.
. Then he’s back at the thing that started all of this: Cas’s neck. Licking and pressing wet, open-mouthed kisses just under his ear then down the column of his throat. Pushing the stupid trench coat and shirt and blazer down and to the side so he can continue across Cas’s collarbone. Cas holds him tight by the shoulders, flexing his fingers into and out of his flannel and shirt underneath, a strange, unskilled parody of a massage. (Not that Dean’s ever had a real massage.)
Anything for that kid though, Dean knew, logically, that Jack understood that he was not big enough or mature enough to take care of a snake or other reptile, despite his being possibly the most powerful entity in the universe besides Chuck and Auntie Amara (which was a title and phrase that both got weirder and more normal every time he said it).
He was staring. Great. Sam, of course, noticed and elbowed him in the ribs, making a suggestion that Dean could not refuse, especially not with Jo cheering him on, Ellen and Bobby pacing themselves in the corner with twin looks of amusement. (And it wasn’t like he didn’t want to do it). So, what the hell? It was probably their last night on Earth, why not do something stupid and fun?
. So, shut up Sammy).
"Thank you," Dean responded, not trusting himself to repeat the words, it'd been 13 years since John died and he still hadn't gotten through half of that bullshit.
And yes, Dean remembers, he remembers vividly. He remembers being fifteen and more than a little tipsy. He remembers the room swimming and looking at Lee just a little too much, and touching him just a little too much. He remembers drunk sloppy teenage kisses. And most of all he remembers John coming in, tearing them apart, dragging his out to the impala. He remembers the cold ice of fear in his heart sitting in the passenger seat, he remembers the choice words Dad had given him that day, about what made a
"If you want," he chuckled, glad that they'd gotten those oatmeal squares that Jack seemed to like as much as cookie crunch (which Sam hated with a passion), with less sugar and more of the vitamins and mineral things that Jack needed as a growing boy. He was a sweet and wonderful kid, but toddlers did not need that much sugar for breakfast unless the idea was to kill the toddler's parents.
Lee could have done all this for himself without the freaky fish-man looking monster in the basement, it was possible. But he'd taken the frickin' easy awful way out. He chose to become another monster by frickin' proximity than actually work for the life he wanted. He acted like the world frickin' owed him the damn bar and the nice life, and maybe it did at some point, but not when it cost people their blood, their lives.
"What about the birds?" he asked trying to distract himself from the subject of
Tonight he slept.
"Sorry, Cas, I know I promised but, I got a bit tied up, literally here and-" he cut himself off, wanting to wash off again. Even though that creature and Lee's blood were both gone from his hands and his face and his sleeves.
It was a nice bar. One that Dean would've been happy to spend all night in when he was younger (and no, that did not mean he was old).
"Would you like me to tell you it now?" he asked.
"Not yet, but two for Tuesday, it's only a matter of time," she said. And given what everyone seemed to say about Sally, that tracked.
One of the perks of driving in the middle of the night was that there was basically never anyone else on the road, besides truckers maybe, if you were on one of those big trucking routes.
, it really has been a long frickin' time. He can feel his mouth pulling one of those cut-your-face-in-half grins that Jack has mastered.
"Nice place," he said, taking a glance around the bar for added effect.
Cas hasn't moved his stare from Dean's mouth, and while his face is flushed he doesn't look like he gives a damn that they have an audience. He's like laser-focused. And that's what decides it. Last night on Earth and all. Dean's already gotten kissed by this angel, he might as well continue and see where this goes, before he goes chicken shit and loses his nerve.
him.)
And there was no damn way he would make the kid leave unless there was some drastic life or death (or bathroom) emergency going on.
“Good morning,” he chokes out, blinking like a frickin’ moron. (They might’ve worked out some of their communication and feelings issues but it would still take a while for Dean to get used to this.) (To get used to someone caring about him.) (Someone who he didn’t raise or save or fix-up cars for.) (But,
It took him sixteen minutes to kill the monster. Seven more to corner and kill Lee.
And Jack... John Winchester never would have let a nephil, much less the biological son of the frickin' devil himself live to be anything more than a minute old... if even that. And as much as Dean loves his Dad, he knew that most of the shit he'd been put through as a kid was not in any way alright.
. He and Lee slapped their hands together in that half clap, half handshake half high-five thing they always did. (And he only briefly thought about how Cas would frown and tell him
"I'll be damned, Man, come in here!" Lee pulled him in and he came. A fast, tight hug with a few slaps on the back, like when they were teenagers or twenty-somethings. And
“Friends don’t really
Dean looks to his watch, cusses.
"Still hunting, huh?" He had this look of awe about him, and Dean was pretty sure he didn't look too different. But damn, the last time they saw each other they'd both assumed they'd be dead in ten years... or less.
, Cas follows without question. (And Dean is
"Hey, I'll have you know that's against the House rules!" Lee joked, not any real anger behind it.
"Eleven years?" Lee let out an impressed laugh, "Good for you," he clapped Dean on the back.
Cas picks up on the first ring with a concerned and borderline angry;
"Are you serious?"
"Sally Anderson, you seen her?"
"I know, I'm sorry Jack, but I promise I'll be back for breakfast," he soothed, trying to distract from the disappointing news by the mention of Jack's favorite meal of the day. The kid was absolutely nuts about breakfast.
After a few kisses more chaste and significantly less tongue than the night before, Dean pulls Cas out into the morning air and towards Bobby’s kitchen where they can get aspirin, breakfast, and hopefully find Cas’s tie.
It’s the way Cas looks at him when he’s happy or being endearing. And then it hits Dean. Cas didn’t just want to kiss him. Cas really had liked him. (Which seems like a very stupid discovery, since Cas and several other angels had outright told him
"Heya, Cas, tell the little tyke I'm gonna miss dinner and I might not be back for bedtime,"
"I could flag down Lorna to get your phone,"
"Dean! We looked snakes and tigers!" Jack exclaimed, all the energy of a comet and then some all condensed into a barely waist-height little boy. Dean wasn't sure if that was a nephil thing or just a kid thing.
Sam has had three beers and he’s laughing at them from the corner.
"Cas, just stay with Jack, I've got it covered," he sighed, and after a second; "And I'm fine."
For all he knew, that was a weird or very personal thing to ask. Or Cas's wings were a sort spot, and since his year as a human and all they'd been a sore spot for a while. Dean didn't know much but the last he'd known they'd been half broken and misshapen and missing lots of feathers.
Then Jo finds the tequila and whiskey Bobby was trying to hide from them and the party really starts. And by party, Dean means a series of bad decisions made around people that will either A: join in on, or B: laugh at you and hand you another drink.
Cas tilts his head and does that squinty-scowl thing, “You are… important to me, Dean.” And as nice as that sounds and makes his throat close up, it’s not an answer and Cas can’t possibly mean… (Why couldn’t he mean that?) (Because Anna said he was just like the other angels, he wasn’t capable of feeling like a human.) (Because if he did… what would Dean do?) (Because if he did then Dean had dirtied this pure, holy creature).
"When will you be back?"
Dean wakes up to find himself leaning back against a warm chest, fingers gently petting through his hair. He’s somehow got himself sitting half-sideways inbetween Cas’s legs, with his head against the angel’s shoulder. He doesn't quite remember how he got in that position and is not surprised to find his flannel thrown on the front bench seat with Cas’s trench coat. Cas’s blazer is still on, though it’s wrinkled to all hell and his shirt is still very much unbuttoned and pulled to the side to display the hickeys Dean had given him. Cas’s eyes are lidded with a softness that makes Dean’s heart stutter and his stomach roll.
Dean move him). (And he is not gonna think about that because he’d only just got up the courage to act on this thing with Cas
But actual, human on human murder? That didn't make sense.
, and it’s frickin’ wild how Cas just
"Sure you will handsome. But first," she said, leaning in conspiratorially, "-hand it over."
"Not as much anymore but a few every now and again,"
"Son of a bitch," he said. Lee looked up, scanned his face, though it didn't take long for the recognition to come.
, and Dean catches one of Cas’s wrists and pushes his arm down. (With hardly any force but Cas
It was a good morning, he was glad for everything he'd done and everything done to him, for having led him to this.
feels back for hook-ups, what is happening to him?)
look just as the angel in question answers.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says like it’s his favorite thing in the world. (And maybe it is.)
"Birds?" He asked, leaning against Baby's hood.
(He feels bad for hooking up with Cas’s ex-boss.) (He
“Not teasing,” Dean says, raising his hands in a show of peace. (And he was definitely thinking about how awesome it is that no one else got to kiss Cas, to know what it felt like.) (And maybe that makes Dean really selfish and narcissistic, but he can’t help it, now that he’s had
“Dean is helping me with my ‘sexual awakening’,” Cas says with a straight face and frickin’
Lee's face fell.
). The lighting in the bar was nice too, blues and pinks on the stage making for a fun atmosphere where they cast the shadows in purples. The rest was typical lighting, a classic wood bar, and natural floors.
"Yes," Cas breathes, the word barely even a whisper on his stupidly kissable lips. The whisper is reverant and Dean pushes that to the back burner, he can think about it later. Right now he has something more important to do.
Cas’s eyes are dark. Narrowed with a dangerous intensity. In moments like these, you could tell that he was larger than life, larger than the kinda scrawny human body he inhabited. Dean had half a mind to run, surely he would be smited (smitten?
"No, man you can't just not tell me about her,"
"Dean Winchester, a family man!" Lee laughed, mockery thankfully absent from his tone. He was happy for him. And Dean was happy to get that approval, they'd both come so far, and gained so much. Even if they probably lost a whole lot along the way.
"Your brother had to third wheel all that!?" Lee doubled over now, wheezing with laughter.
"I'll be here, Dean," the quiet seriousness and surety of the seraph's tone is like warm water on aching muscles, pulling the tension out of him. After what he just did, a lot of him feels like he doesn't deserve that. But the rest of him is so relieved from the comfort Cas provides.
"Funny, two-and-a-half years ago I woulda handed it over easy, but-" He pulled his phone from its pocket, turning it on to pull up one of the photos Cas sent a few hours ago, smiling to himself at the ridiculous string of emoticons in the texts attached. He turned it to show her Jack's little sunshine smiling face, the gap in his front teeth just as endearing as it was when they first came in. He was pointing at a snake, and as much as Dean hated those slithery leather death noodles, Jack's bright smile was always going to win him over.
far; “I wanted her to have a good night because she was gonna die in the morning,” he breathes, making sure his gaze is steady and that Cas can see his honesty, “I want you to have a good night
, and he wouldn’t get to see all that pretty skin). (And no, he was not gonna think about how he shouldn’t be thinking that about Cas’s skin). (And he was not gonna think about it because Cas was a dude… maybe). (Correction, he wasn’t gonna think of it because Cas
Like stone isn't a good description. Cuz stone, for all its hardness and not-movingness, is cold. And Cas sure as shit ain't cold. His skin is firm and soft in that weird way that living flesh is when somebody goes tense and he's warm as… well he's
"Huh," he filed that away for future, non-phone conversations. Because he was getting really damn curious about this.
?) (Did that mean-)
It was not the life he'd thought he would get to lead, and it was so much better than he could have ever hoped for.
not Cas because she didn't know about Cas.
"That's good..." he replied, "So, Jack can see them?" he continued, awkward like a damn teenager with his foot in his mouth because he had never been great at genuine communication... even with Sammy.
(he hopes it isn't the window-sill salt) before his tongue is back on Cas’s throat and he's realizing just how still Cas has become.
Pushing Cas off is harder the second time around, now that Cas knows kissing is okay. But he gets the request and pulls back with a bit of a frickin' pout. (Ain't that adorable?)
Dean gives his brother a
“I rebelled
John had made so many comments about what a good, obedient son Lee probably was to his folks, about how he probably didn't cause trouble for trouble's sake. It didn't matter that Lee had been kissing him too, it mattered that Dean was kissing a boy and 'poisoning' both himself and Lee.
Some folks snicker behind them, Dean is pretty sure it was Sam and Jo. (At this point Joanna Beth was no doubt recruited to the annoying younger sibling cause).
He just licked an angel on the neck. He licked Castiel; 'I raised you from perdition' angel of the lord on the neck. And worse yet, he did it
And one of the lovely benefits of having the road to yourself is that the speed limit was even more flexible than usual.
“Get in,” Dean pants with a purpose, knocking on the glass of Baby’s backseat window. Within a blink and the swooshing sound of wings Cas is gone. Dean opens the door to find the angel seated inside, leaning towards the open door. Dean can’t help the stupid grin beaking across his face, he climbs in, happy to be pulled by the flannel into yet another hungry kiss. Sadly, Dean has to cut it short. (But there’ll be plenty of that later.) He shuts the door behind him.
Dean raises his other hand to the side of Cas’s neck. The skin there is smooth and almost soft, not like the prickly stubble of the angel's jaw against his other palm. The difference is really really interesting and important for reasons he can't explain even if he wanted to. He moves the hand on Cas’s neck to hold at his nape, his gaze locked and roaming up and down the column of his throat and following the lines of his jaw and the curves of his lips. (Lips that are at least a little swollen and pinker than ever, shiny with wetness.)
. Cas feels right against him.
"Uh-huh!" Dean could hear the waver in Jack's voice that came from bobbing his head in a nod, his dirty blond hair likely flopping everywhere.
"I am damn serious, and when this finally comes out it's 'cause Cas told me he'd been frickin' in love with me the whole damn time!"
), is a quick learner. He follows the unspoken hints and the kiss gets a whole lot better (not that it was ever bad to begin with).
"Green and red and yellow and blue and green and they're so pretty!"
"Last night story?" the little boy asked as Cas (the blessing that he was) handed him a full cup of coffee over Jack's head.
Jack went on to ramble about birds and then back to snakes again 'cause the kid was strongly cemented in that snake phase. He listened with his head tilted back looking to the sky. The stars had come out and speckled the dark sky. The moon looked like a cookie with a bite out of it, and he could not remember if it was smaller than the night before or bigger.
"Don't drive inebriated," Cas cautioned, knowing that when Dean Winchester said catching up, it meant drinking with whoever. He almost rolled his eyes, Cas was such a worry-wart sometimes. He was worse than Sam.
Somehow Cas loses his tie, this is after god knows how many shots of hard liquor (anyone else would’a been dead an hour ago). And his shirt is unbuttoned at least three or four down from the collar. The line of Cas’s throat, and all the skin… it sure was something pretty to look at. Angelic skin normally covered up by Cas’s holy tax-accountant get-up. Dean was hungry or maybe he was thirsty and that skin looked fucking delicious. (Damn he needed a good fuck, but the idea of going to get some was unthinkable, then he’d have to
Maybe this is damnation, that they’re committing in the backseat of Baby. But Dean doesn’t fucking care. Because it’s Cas, because Cas has always been special, honest, trustworthy, loyal. He doesn’t fucking care because Heaven is a bunch of corrupt beaurocrats anyway and who knows if God even fucking cares that the world is ending? Dean doesn’t fucking care because Cas is gonna help them save the fucking world from everybody. (And that makes this holy in his books, regardless of what anyone else says.)
He'd left the bar at six-thirty and broke into the junkyard and found the missing girl's car in less than forty minutes. Only to get hit over the head with something that felt an awful lot like one of those big, heavy flashlights people kept under their sinks.
gonna think about how hot that is). (Or maybe he
Sammy walks in with a serious bedhead, bleary eyed and by the looks of it a little hungover. Dean catches the exact second Sam realizes the red and purple spots on Cas aren’t his eyes playing tricks on him. Jo has sat up and is rubbing the sleep from her eyes.
The same brunette woman as before, with the basket fulla phones came around.
"Why couldn't you just drop it?" Lee asked, sounding tired and betrayed. And that was awfully frickin' funny 'cause he was the one kidnapping people to feed to his ugly pet.
Jack hummed with a smile, almost purring like a little kitten from the contact. Dean chuckled under his breath, taking a sip of the hot coffee, the kid was darn cute.
"In fact, he said he'd never seen anybody handle themself so well in a fight, and that's high praise coming from him."
. But it's a different skin taste than Dean's, not that Dean has licked himself outside of getting wing sauce and fry seasoning off his fingers and lips. He drags his tongue up the column of Cas’s throat, quickly dumps the thing of salt Sam gave him from fucking
Cas’s ridiculous lips are ridiculously plush and still wet from where he’d licked them. This kiss is sweet, but not in flavor. It’s intensely warm and the fire in his chest is so much more than lust. That feeling is Cas. It’s warmth and fondness and comradery. It’s the smell of the grass after a thunderstorm and it’s the warm summer wind that carried the storm. And it’s Cas,
Tomorrow would bring things that he never dreamed he'd get to have when he was fifteen or even twenty-three.
There are words mixed in with Cas’s gasps,
to know how Cas knows. And
And since Dean’s done (maybe) (probably) being a coward, he lets his tongue into the equation, slipping it out against the seam of Cas’s ridiculous lips. Then his tongue is in Cas’s mouth and he didn’t think he’d get this far. Cas’s mouth tastes like hard liquor and like any other human mouth, but it’s also better because it’s Cas’s mouth. (And as much as it doesn’t make sense, it also
“I’m not sure,” Cas starts with a thoughtful frown, “Maybe since I saw you kiss Anna,” and
“You guys look like feds.” She observed.
“Is this how you dress for a first date?” Sam blurted out with a wide grin plastered on his face.
“Hello, Castiel. I’m Naomi.” The blue eyed angel smiled warmly and stretched out her hand for Castiel to take. He hesitantly wrapped the tapering fingers of his own vessel around her palm and gave a firm shake.
“That cunning skank!” Crowley bellowed after pacing the room for some time and tiredly peering at Dean’s mannequin. Muttering under his breath he once again vacated the room.
“I know this place wouldn’t be in your ideal Heaven but for some reason, I think somehow we both have grown strangely fond of this place.”
Castiel tried. Every single time, to redeem himself. To earn back his trust. What did Dean do? He broke him, made him choose him over his family, and got him killed. And Castiel forgave him, every single time. Dean made him feel worthless and used, drove him away, and all he did was just hug it out later.
“It is, although I don’t understand why you sent him back. What I meant was, what did you do to him?”
The more Dean tried to convince himself that thongs can’t be with boxer-briefs and that Cas was not worth pissing off Lisa, he only came to realize that no one makes him feel special and beautiful more than Cas does. Other underwears would only praise Lisa and her stuck up diamonds and peridot and only question why Dean never had any. But Cas only had eyes for Dean and he wanted it to be the same for Cas.
“A crime scene?”
"What is that?" Castiel didn't recognize it but Dean did. He knew what they were and what Chevy having them on him meant. "Well, if this isn't proof enough, then here goes nothing." he shoved those back into the pocket of his black jeans and lifted the left side of his shirt up. Both the brother and the angel gaped at the scar along his ribs. It was the boys' initials they had etched on the car when they were kids. He dropped the shirt and stared coldly and Castiel considered Dean, who flashed Chevy an apologetic look.
“Castiel!”
Jody and Sam were ready at home, safe and sound by the time Alex and Dean got back.
Castiel pointed out.
“How’s he holding up, Sam?”
If Dean had not yet noticed that his wing was missing, he would soon and all this worry and concern will be no more, because now he was just plain cloth. Dean was definitely going to ignore him now. If before he had no reason to do so, now he does. Cas is almost worthless now. Worthless and plain. Dean was so special and he was nothing before him. He did not want to bring embarrassment to Dean by being with him.
“I’m telling you, bampots, It’s not me. You don’t even have anything to hold against me. On what grounds are you ejecting me?” She winced as she was dragged into the airlock.
“Is anyone uh… Is anyone sus?” Sam swallowed and looked around. Everyone other than Donna was there. Dean and his family, Crowley, Rowena, Bobby, Charlie, and Jody. But they all seemed like themselves. From the looks he received at the question, he realized that no one knew. Well, no one except the killer.
“Why not?” Dean threw his arms up and she squealed in joy.
“You’ve hunted with much less, I’ve heard.”
Just as she got to Security, the tiny red light atop the doorway into the room started blinking and a faint siren blared in the ship. Mumbling prayers, she started back to the cafeteria, and Claire, who stood frozen still in front of Communications, joined her midway.
Suddenly, Crowley’s voice booms. “All those in favor of ejecting Purple here, keep your silence.” And so they all did. “It’s decided then. Purple out.” Crowley’s lips quirked up as Rowena started hissing curses.
“What about your brothers, Gertie? Daddy told you to look after them, didn’t he?” she kept her voice stern but eyes soft as she looked down at the frail girl.
“I was out of practice.” Dean felt Cas shrug against him.
“Don’t talk to me like I don’t care, man. I do. Let me show you. I just need a chance. Give me that.” He begged right back.
“As long as you don’t run away with my baby, sure.” Bess humored, and with a grunt, Dean was on his feet striding for the door. He almost bumped into Sam as the giant made his way in, and he raised his eyebrows in question.
"Oh please. What do you want me to say? That Ishim will be punished? Demoted?"
Sam grabbed the water on the bedside table and splashed some on her face. Emma jerked awake gasping and she shrank against the headboard of the bed as she saw the two tall men looming over her. The brothers backed away with their hands held up as she scrambled off her bed and dashed to the washroom, almost wobbling.
“Alli permutat anima kimota. Alli permutat anima kimota. Alli permutat anima kimota.”
Dean’s eyes met his, hollow and empty if not for the glint of familiarity and resentment in them.
Castiel’s brow furrows in sadness and anger and he turns back to glower at Bobby.
She nodded innocently. “Uh uh. And the flow,” she shook her head. “You’d wish you were in hell.”
“You have broken our most sacred oath. And the penalty is,” He paused as the flash of silver dug into the base of Acabel’s chest and the grace in him flared through his vessel’s eyes and mouth. “Death” he completed, emotionless.
"I miss him too, you know. John. He wasn't a darling, sure. But he took care of me. Not that you don't. You're really good at it too. But I miss him just the same." a smile tugged at the corner of his lips and he looked away.
"Hey, I think I got us something.”
Dean’s physical form was now complete. Now came the hardest part. Restoring his memories. His grace once again made its way to his soul and this time, Dean pulled harder at it, almost as if wanting to devour the divine energy.
“New case around, huh? Anything I should be worried about?” Garth asked, almost whispering.
“But until then,” Naomi broke in, sighing heavily, trying to regain the confidence that she lost as she picked up hopelessness from Castiel’s tone. “The gates of heaven are closed.”
Without answering him, Castiel slams the emergency meeting button, nearly breaking it, and then meets Sam’s eyes. Only this time, he lets his worry and fear show.
“Can I take him upstairs with me?” She asked clutching onto the frill of her skirt, scared of being denied.
"Well, would you look at that?" Garth beamed at them as he walked his way up to them. "Ain't he the cutest little thing?”
Dean caught Castiel’s attention. The depth in his voice might have caught him off guard, but as odd as it may seem, it fit his looks.
His eyes then bored into Dean’s to make sure he heard his next words loud and clear. “Everybody knows Winchester love brings death.”
"Ha! I'm bisexual. So jokes on you short bus,"
Out of nowhere, Dean blurted out, “You know what, Sammy? I can’t do this anymore. I’m too old for this.” Dean shook his head and stood up.
By the time Dean got to him, Sam was almost done hacking at the side of the crate, carefully enough not to damage whatever was inside.
“Shut up and tell me how to walk like a girl.” He snapped.
When she did not snap back with a witty retort, both he and Sam turned around and studied her.
“I know this is a stupid question but, are you okay?” Sam asked, leaning forward and reaching out for her arm.
He realized that Chevy had caught him staring and was now smirking at him. It didn't seem like a smirk anymore. His face seemed to be stuck that way. Maybe that's just how his smile was. He slowly walked over to Chevy and leaned on the map table beside him. Before Dean could ask anything he suddenly started nodding.
“So…” Emma breathed in deep as the door clicked close and Dean jumped off the couch and practically leaped to her.
“Hey!” He snapped lightly, throwing a glare, trying to keep it respectful. Returning an amused yet cocky smirk, Nick resumed walking.
She cut him off.
“Oh!” She frowned. “She must have gotten the wrong number or something. We’re not planning to leave anytime soon. We’ll be here when she gets back.” Rita smiled warmly up at Emma.
Dean himself was surprised that he wasn’t squealing. Of everything that could happen, he never thought he’d get to meet his brother again.
Dean groaned and Castiel narrowed his eyes. For some reason, this guy bothered him. Especially when he introduced himself as Dean's baby. They both squint challengingly at each other with clenched jaws for a while. Castiel was towering over Chevy, feeling tall for once in a long time. Castiel moved back and held out his two fingers before Chevy. He sighed, releasing the built-up irritation inside of him, and tried to play nice.
With Nick so close to Dean’s ear, the growl that escaped his throat and the sickening sound of his fangs descending tensed Dean. He had been stalling. With the death grip Nick had on him, there was no way he could have got out of this mess alive. All he could do was hold Nick off until Sam got on his feet and freed Nick’s body from his neck.
“One of you can.”
“Y-you’re too old… for reading...” Sam raised his eyebrows and swallowed. “Bobby wasn’t.” He mumbled with a hint of a smile on his face.
“This, dear mother, is the Winchester 67 Lingerie.” Crowley marveled, and the woman gasped.
Castiel was impressed by how calm and collected he was while conversing with Dean. Stammering and stuttering is what he had expected to come out.
“Thanks for the info, Sammy. I had no idea at all.” Dean narrowed his eyes and sassed at Sam, chewing the fries aggressively.
And it shattered.
“What?” Sam laughed. “It’s just Garth.”
“Sadly, that is not true. And now once again,” She pushed herself off the table and came to rested a hand on his shoulder and gave it a squeeze. “I will have to swim around in that mess of a mind of yours and nip all those flaws in the bud before you start having feelings of all things.”
Sam was with Emma in her room when she opened her eyes. The brothers have been taking turns staying with an unconscious Emma for four days now. Her concussion required them to put her in an induced coma. The doctors weren't sure when she'd wake up but they kept on saying that it wouldn't take long.
And then he prayed. He prayed for him to come back. He doubted himself and went over their last conversation multiple times until he realized what he was doing. He was spiraling and following the same damned cycle he did after Castiel died. Or he thought he had died. Coming to the conclusion that Castiel wants nothing more to do with Dean or Sam and that he’s probably shacking it up with his precious little God of a son, Dean tells himself that he’s letting Cas go.
And so he corrected himself. “He chose to be here with me and save me. He loved me.” The weight that lifted off his heart punched a breath out of him. He had never said those words aloud ever, and saying it out loud was exhilarating.
“I didn’t do it, boys” Rowena sucked in a breath dramatically, her eyelashes fluttering. “You have to trust me.”
“No, you’re not. Send him away so that he can run back to his
The Sun was up by the time Sam got back, and he hoped that both Dean and the girl would be awake and fine since most sleeping spells break at dawn. And maybe he was right because when he opened the door to the room, he met with Dean and the girl gaping at each other, their jaws hitting the floor.
“Yeah uh… no. Nuh uh” He shook his head, as Bess strode over to take Castiel from his arms. “I’d rather have the kid puke all over me than… this.” He grimaces at the table and Gertie narrowed yer eyes, hands at her hips.
Jody chuckles and so does Castiel but softly as he felt the laces press up to him.
When they reached the door, Sam pulled out something from the pocket inside his suit's jacket and started working on the lock. Emma couldn’t understand why she was so surprised. Of course, they picked locks. She secured her sweaty grip on the gun as many scenarios where she’d have to take this giant of a man down, played in her mind. Fortunately, Sam didn’t see her jump a little when the door clicked open. Just as they stepped in, Sam went rigid before her. When she stepped around him to see what had him glued to the ground, all she saw was a neatly kept living room.
“That depends on what you saw. And they’re dreams. So you could have seen anything.”
Rowena’s hunched shoulders relaxed and she sighed as she watched him walk away wearily. Even she could see how much Dean was hurting. Even after all this time, he still couldn’t talk about it without throwing a fit.
"Hey, we didn't get to meet officially. I'm Dean's Baby." Chevy held out a hand.
“But, today, for the first time in a long time.” He smiled, meeting Garth’s eyes. “He laughed for real. And I don’t know, I… I’m so fucking relieved. I think it was Cas junior. I heard him saying some stuff to him. I don’t really know what he said. Been giving him a lot of space these days, you know? But today, after that, he got more words out at lunch than he does in a week.”
“We stay here, and the killer kills us all,” Crowley spoke for the first time that day.
Castiel wondered out loud.
“I mean, yeah. He wasn’t all perfect or anything. Did so many stupid shi- uhm... stupid things. Messed up real bad. Even left me behind so many times. He’d just friggin’ take off and not check in for days. But he always came back. Always. Hell, I don’t get to be angry. It’s not like he was the one who messed up all of those times. At least he’d try to make it right. When did I ever try?” Dean swallowed as he slowly let it dawn on him.
“Sam, everything looks normal here. Are you sure you killed her?” Emma asked after tapping his shoulder from behind with the tip of her gun as Sam frantically yet carefully scoped the living room again.
“No.”
“Easy with the minors, Sammy.” Dean chuckled as he peered over Sam’s shoulder. “Oh dang. It’s Thumbelina.”
“Castiel,” The blue eyes that stared down on him from across the table flitted as the unfamiliar name slipped off the angel’s lips. “I don’t think we’ve met before.”
“The child was human,” Castiel explained, just in case Ishim hadn’t noticed it when he drove the blade into the child.
Castiel couldn’t help but feel a little proud of his little gold wing.
“He said loved me and I… I just stood there like an idiot. I didn’t know what to say. I thought he…” He trailed off, eyes flicking wildly as a few faint smiles and gummy laughs flashed behind his eyes, and his skin tried recalling the feel of those touches on his shoulder that said so much more than words, and huffed out a laugh. “Now that I think of it, I was an idiot all along.”
“Take care of the sword, Uriel. Castiel has to answer for his action up in heaven.” A quick nod over her shoulder and Uriel advanced as Castiel very obediently lay Dean on the ground, with as much care as he can. A look of resentment lingered in those stoic brown eyes before it went impassive and fell on Dean.
After a few laughs and some fine tea, Bess called out to them to be at the dining table for lunch and Dean who was genuinely having fun but would never tell another soul about it reluctantly left the tiny table. But the delicious smell of pot roast wafted from the kitchen and he forgot all about tea parties and was the first at the table.
“I don’t like this. I mean, this is weird, man. Witches, demons, and shifters all in one small town? All popping into our radar at once? I sense trouble.” Dean sighed as he drove down the road.
“Why not?” Dean threw his arms up and she squealed in joy.
"I went to our garage and found this guy lying flat on his back on the floor just staring at the ceiling. He called me Sammy and then sat up apologizing for turning out to look like a human. Our whole arsenal was scattered outside and there was no sign of the car. He was just there. And the garage was locked."

“Dean, what the hell do you think-”
Castiel finally responded and Dean laughed heartily.
Dean’s attention quickly jumped to the bras eyeing him and he flirted left and right with them ignoring Lisa’s forced laughs and hushed awkward pleas to stop. The usual warmth that radiated from Dean was diminished now. Maybe Castiel shouldn’t have acted that cold.
She drawled.
"I'm gonna try though. I swear, I'm gonna. Until I… until I can think about you... and smile instead of…" He cleared his throat as he trailed off.
Dean is looking at him expectantly when Sam gets off the phone.
She was softly massaging the redness on her left wrist, and her shoulders rise and fall as she breathes somewhat unevenly. She’d blink once in a few seconds but that was about it. So Sam dragged the chair he was sitting on earlier, closer to her bed. That earns him a slight flinch. Sam notices how much weight she had lost since she left them behind, as he thinks about how to strike up a conversation that could make her acknowledge his presence. Her cheeks were sticking to her face, and her skin was hugging her bones tight. If they thought she was skinny before, they could call her a noodle now.
His voice was so damn low. Dean did not want to call that light growl in his voice sexy but that's what it was and he knew it. He gave Sam a panicked glance and Sam stepped forward and pulled Dean away again.
“Bullshit. How come our bullets didn’t kill you?” Dean snapped.
He saw a blur of skin and immediately felt the crunch of a fist to his jaw. But he didn’t fall back. Spitting out the blood that welled inside his lips, he smiled bloodily at Dean. He was almost done cutting the rope.
“Naked? With no swimming trunks?”
“Yeah?” Dean asked coarsely but with such slyness that a shiver ran down his spine. “I taste even better.”
“Uh… No. I just needed a break from all the… nerdiness.” It came out less snarky and more quiet than intended. To Dean’s relief, Sam made no more efforts to make him spill all the feels and walked into the array of shelves to go get another book to devour.
So he used the very energy emanating from their blinding bond to rebuild Dean’s body. Oddly enough, he remembered even the minutest details of the man’s frame. Even those Dean wouldn’t be comfortable of anyone knowing, but Castiel did not know that. He started from the rip of his toes and worked his way up, restoring the tiniest of imperfections of his skin, and even the exact angle of his bow legs that to his surprise and remorse he seemed to have grown fond of. He carefully worked on every inch of his body, and every drop of his blood, and most importantly every single freckle on his skin, until the tip of his slightly crooked nose.
Dean groaned as he tried to distract himself from the bras' yammering, including Lisa's.
“Stefan. I’m Stefan O’Connell. I’ll be supervising your inspection.” He stood stiffer, giving Nick a slight nod.
“Freakin’ libraries, man. I thought these days were long gone.”
Claire pulled it out and the silver flashed lightly before Charlie's eyes. “It’s called a screwdriver. You generally find those in tool kits.” She waved it before her emotionless face, voice heavy with sarcasm. Claire rarely showed any emotions. And if she did, it was mostly smugness, and that’s just what this was. Or so Charlie hoped.
Dean cleared his throat to find his voice. “Alex was formal” Huh. Not bad. He was a little proud of himself for not sounding too stunned.
The clever bastards had only shot him with enough dead man’s blood to temporarily paralyze him. He could only watch as the men, as they tied him up with a thick and abrasive rope, tighter than he’d have preferred, and threw him roughly against the van.
Just when he thought that things couldn’t get any worse, Alex introduces him to a ginger blonde man with caramel blonde hair, unsettling blue eyes, and… red lips? Dean blinked a couple of times as he unconsciously took the man’s hand that had been held out with unwavering confidence until Dean took it. And damn, was that skin smooth. But the lips. The guy had to be wearing lipstick. He’s been all over the country and never before had he seen lips of that color on someone unless they were wearing lipstick of course. So the guy has to be wearing lipstick, right?
she cut him off again and this time Dean lost it.
Naomi held his stare as she measured him.
“Holy shit! Holy fucking shit!!!” She breathed out running her fingers through her short red locks and eyes blown wide. She looked around panicking and wasted no time in trying to get herself together. She hurried out and practically ran into Castiel's arms.
“Great!” She skipped towards the twins and scooped them up and stumbled her way over to the brothers, and splayed the toddlers before them. “So the one wearing blue is Cas, and the one wearing orange is Sam.” She said pointing at the blue-clad baby at first and then the orange. “Now don’t get them crying”, she warned them and then hesitated for a second.
Chevy rolled his eyes again as he fished out the small army man out of his pocket along with a red piece of Lego.
And with that, Gabriel was gone
“Shit!” He cursed under his breath as he realized that he was doing it again. Bad habits die hard. After all, he had been beating himself over every bad thing that happened to him and his family. He had been blaming himself for every damn thing. He had been buying into John gaslighting him and to make it even worse, he’d been twisting John’s already harsh words, making them worse, and for what? Nothing good at all. If it had gotten him anywhere, then it’s here, in this mess. Helpless again, as he has always felt.
“Oh. I was just um… fixing some wires,” she awkwardly waved her hand around the handle of the wiring board in the room.
Castiel’s words echoed in her mind.
“Ever since we boarded, I guess.”
"That would be true."
"What's up, buttercup?" Chevy asked, slightly raising his voice so that both of them wouldn't miss out his tone and stood a bit too close to Dean. He didn't like that at all. Neither did the angel by the look on his face.
Castiel could feel the fakeness of her encouragement as she spoke. His bands twitched in anger that only Dean caught.
“We can?” Dean inquired.
Ishim slowly made his way to Castiel and glowered at him. “You saw nothing. And you will speak of nothing.” He growled only for Castiel to hear, voice heavily laden with anger and threat although his face held neither, as he backed away to gather the other angels.
When he saw the blue and red neon sign that read “Olive or Twist” he couldn’t help but bore holes through the side of Dean’s head. He couldn’t believe that after everything he had been through over the past couple of months, he’d try to get laid and pick up the most obvious of all choices. The blonde hair, short, brown eyes, and perkiness. What better way to contrast Castiel? Sam said nothing. He had no idea what Dean was going through, and he was no expert in dealing healthily with lost love. But he knew that this was wrong. An insult to Castiel’s memory even.
“Oh. Thanks, man, but you don’t have to-”
Sam, however, could not sleep that night. For different reasons though. Eileen laid at the center of the bed, relaxed and snoring softly and there at the farthest corner lay Sam. Awake. Mortified. Curled up and almost shrunken against the headboard as Dean’s bedroom walls failed to keep the noises from within the room. Yeah, he’s happy for them. But he'd definitely pick the eye sex and over this.
Cas's wings... Did that mean the kid could see Cas's true form? Or at least the bits of it that peaked out from his human body?
"I got enough,"
Dean pulls away, admiring the pink flush and red marks that he’s left, he decides Cas’s neck is so much prettier with them. Then he dives back in, licking a stripe from the hollow of his throat up the center over the most recent mark and his adam’s apple, ending it where Cas’s throat meets his chin. He doesn’t get to admire his work as long this time.
"You sure I can't persuade you to give it up?" she asked again, giving a hopeful gesture to the basket.
"Dean friggin' Winchester," Lee said, face a mirror of his own fake scowl.
that had been much longer than Dean ever thought. He’d thought that sad look Cas had given him had something to do with the fact he’d been sent there to kill his former boss. And to hell with that stupid cowardice, last night on Earth and all. Dean does what he should’ve done on Cas's first last night on Earth; he gets close and kisses the angel for all he’s worth. (And it’s crazy how Cas lets himself be pulled and kissed and how he frickin’
"Yeah, me too," he breathed, pressing the heel of his palm into his eyes until spots danced behind his eyes.
"How is the hunt going?" Cas asked softly. Letting them both escape the path of that conversation.
Cas’s eyes do the happy squint thing and the corners of his lips turn upward. And the amount of sappy thoughts that come to Dean’s mind is far too many. (And it feels like his heart is doing some sort of happy song and dance, as stupid as that sounds.) (Goddamn feelings.)
"What the hell are you doing here?"
He uses every trick he knows, using his tongue to do wicked things to the pure being, twisting his fingers in the short hair at his nape and tugging. He feels hungry and depraved and he can feel the lecherous corrupting effect he’s having on Cas. (And part of him, the selfish part, is so satisfied that it can twist an angel to desire him… to plant carnal desires in him.) (Another part of him wants to push him away, keep from corrupting Cas, because is good and he’s-)
Dean push him, because they both frickin' know just how immovable Cas actually is). Cas licks his lips, lips which Dean has had a borderline shameful obsession with since they met, because they're really fucking plump and really frickin' pink. Cas’s gaze is on his mouth, like all he wants to do is kiss Dean
He missed bedtime by almost an hour and a half now. He had a voicemail from Cas. Which he would listen to later.
He presses a kiss over the mark and revels in the shudder of Cas in his hands and the racing pulse against his lips. He kisses the hollow of Cas’s throat, feeling the angel’s breaths and swallows against his nose. Then he does something absolutely wicked; he sucks a mark, above that last kiss, just below the angel’s adam’s apple. Cas chokes out a moan or maybe a whine that sounds distinctly like his name. And it’s the most beautiful thing he’s heard that night.
Small town sheriffs were usually a little on the kooky side, (at least in comparison to the big city folks) but nothing quite this apathetically optimistic. But Dean had a funny feeling about this, it looked like a case, and he'd be damned if he didn't at least look at the abduction site and interview the only witness himself. Especially since it seemed that the sheriff just didn't care.
Not that he could ever change that schedule up, 'cause that kid had baby blues that could rival Cas's, and being that he was two, he was intrinsically blessed with the gift of the best puppy pout in the world.
"Cereal?!"
Sam and Jo are giggling like hyenas or whatever those laughing Australian birds are called. Dean has also helpfully forgotten that Cas agreed to the neck-licking in the first place.
“I’m okay, I’m okay,” he chokes out, “
He cleaned the blood from the bar first, then he took Lee's body to the middle of nowhere and burned it. Until the bones were crumbling and snapping from the heat. Then he buried those.
Cas is kissing him. Cas is
"Always liked that crusty son of a bitch," the Lee really broke into a smile, "Remember that time he caught us wasted on a Hunt?"
Jack woke him up in the morning, despite the gentle shushing noises and gestures Cas had made to try and let him sleep in a bit longer.
"What am I d- I own this joint! What are you doing here?" Lee shouted back at him, face split wide in his own grin.
"Dean!" a little voice shouted, and Cas muffled the microphone, speaking to Jack.
Hell, Sam probably would've been dead by Dad's hand if he knew about all the drinking demon blood and accidentally letting the devil out to play.
, especially when the other guy was an awkward and weird angel who hoisted his sorry ass outta hell and did not ask for any sort of sexual perversion).
Interviewing Sally hadn't been as helpful as he thought, besides highlighting just how quickly the girl and her car had vanished.
Everything in the world sounded better when described in the limited words of an excited two-and-a-half-year-old nephil, even snakes.
"Yeah, well, Lorna said I had a good enough reason to keep it,"
Cas, a lot less drunk than he should’ve been but decidedly tipsy, listens intently to Sam’s instructions. Dean is only 60% sure that Cas is listening. But Cas agrees to their stupid idea with a face pink from the amount of allcolhol --
"Lorna, can you get a couple of beers for me and my boy here?"
At some point during the kiss Dean had brought his hand up to cup Cas’s jaw. And despite everything-- despite being a force of reckoning and a bomb’s worth of angel mojo and being older than Dean even wants to begin to understand-- Cas leans into it, like a dopey little nerd.
"Wow, sounds like you guys made some friends,"
"I was wondering when one of you idjits would do something," Bobby says, "Been getting sick of this 'just friends' bullshit,"
(and boy, did he not want to think about how old that made him).
Of the hunger he had for any sort of knowledge of what they looked like, what Cas's true form looked like. All he really knew before was that Cas was like twelve-hundred feet tall. And now that Cas's wings were like rainbows with black... whatever that meant, it had to be beautiful. And Dean once again was bitter that he wasn't one of those people that could see and hear angels in their true forms and voices.
doesn't want to fuck up whatever it is they have now.)
At least the monster's body disintegrated to ash. Lee burned that poor girl's body, to keep her from haunting him. That only leaves him to deal with.
for you Dean, I care about you, Dean, you are my-” Dean wonders if Cas would be so honest if he wasn’t tipsy. (He would be, Cas doesn’t really do anything except brutal honesty.) (And Cas doesn’t lie to him, Dean knows that but doesn’t wanna think about how he knows it.)
Ellen is sitting at the table with Bobby and some coffee. Jo is facedown on the couch, groaning about sunlight.
He hummed and voiced some reactions when Jack paused in his verbal onslaught of what they did that day. Occasionally, Cas would remind Jack to tell him about a specific animal or thing they had done. Dean really liked phone calls like this, even then they were not as great as having these conversations in-person.
he could see straight through Dean. Through all the layers of B.S. Cas became more human and he became more of who he actually wanted to be and less of the layered violence and obedience John had taught him.
"To John Winchester," Lee raised his beer.
. Cas’s hand on his left shoulder is vice-like and he can feel a pulsing in the handprint Cas left there before they officially met. Cas is holding onto him like he’s the only thing keeping him on Earth. (And Dean can be that, he can be an anchor and weigh him down, keep him from drifting and soaring too far.)
"Go, family man!" Lee called after him waving him towards the door, Dean chuckled, pushing through, out into the darkness. According to his lock screen display, it was now 5:07 pm. He unlocked and pressed the call button from the text screen.
He felt really weird.
Cas: I’ll organise something, and send you the details later.
“Do you think it was Cas?” New voice, still safe. But different? Good, safe, home, but not in the same way the other voice was. He was too tired to figure out what it meant, his vessel distantly aching. His name was Cas, they were talking about him, he just needed to- his eyes stayed closed, his voice refused to make any noise.
talk.
"Alright," Dean was amazed that he'd managed to keep his voice steady, but he supposed he'd had a few years of practice by now. He was a tattoo artist after all, seeing cute guys shirtless was literally his job and fuck, now he was thinking about this guy with his shirt off and—he needed to stop that thought right there. He was a professional. He was going to stay that way. "Do you want to come on through, and we'll discuss what you're here for?"
“Maybe, but he seemed pretty busy. Maybe he sent one of his underlings.” The voice sounded unhappy, bitter. Betrayed? It hurt Cas’ heart, he didn’t know who it was, but he needed them to be safe, to be happy. He didn’t want them to think he’d betrayed them, and even though he couldn’t even remember who they were, he had the sinking feeling that he had betrayed them before, hurt them in the worst ways possible. He hated that feeling.
He cracked his fingers, shaking the aches out of them as he leant against the front desk, chatting to Benny. Cas was due any moment, and Dean was thankful for the moment to try and sort his hands out.
“It’s probably better if he doesn’t come back.” Dean’s voice was shaking, a few stray tears starting to slip down his face. His entire body started trembling soon afterwards, an arm reaching up to cover his eyes while the other hand continued running through Cas’ fur. “I’m poison, and I’ve hurt him so many times,” there was hate in every single one of Dean’s words. Hate directed straight at himself, with more intensity than Cas had ever heard from his human before. Sure, Dean hated things. He hated so much, but never this strongly. Never this deeply. “It doesn’t matter what I feel, because if he comes back, then I’m just going to hurt him all over again.”
If it would ever wear off.
"I know," Cas murmured, pulling him into a hug.
“That’s amazing, you’re getting better already!” It was John, cheering Cas on as he carefully waved his hands. Dean could feel the pull of Cas’ magic, as even at the slight distance it was channelled through Dean due to their bond, though it took him a moment to figure out what Cas was doing.
He tried to yell, but all that came out was a slightly panicked "mew." Well… that wasn't supposed to happen.
I did a skim edit, but if you see any mistakes, please point them out so I can fix them!
Have an awesome week, and I'll see you next time!!
"Dean," Cas said gently, slipping out of the tree and sinking down next to him, grabbing onto Dean's hands.
Hope you enjoy!!
I hope you enjoyed!!!
But. I didn't.
Kudos and comments mean the world to me, and definitely encourage writing!!
I've put it in the tags, but I'll also mention it here, this chapter has a TW for disordered eating. It's not an eating disorder, but if they trigger you then you probably shouldn't read this chapter, though it'll be all sorted next chapter. I'll put a summary in the end notes for anyone who has to skip this, and if you think you might have to skip it you can always check that to get an idea.
And I'm back! I've missed this story (and you guys) so I'm glad to be back to posting.
He couldn't think what else it could be.
Thanks to the people who have been leaving comments! You guys are pretty much the only thing keeping me going by this point in the year! (What do you mean it's the *start* of the year??) Bu seriously, comments mean a lot, so thanks for that!!
He was about half a second away from leaping to his feet and possibly trying to find whatever weapon he could, when his tired brain caught up with his eyes, figuring out the dimensions and placement of the orbs.
Castiel reached her just as she finished speaking, his grace reaching her at the same time her pale yellow magic reached him. Nothing happened to him, not straight away anyway, but the second his grace reached the witch she started screaming, his grace burning through her magic and destroying her. He momentarily felt bad for what he did, even after all this time he hated taking the lives of the creatures he had sworn to protect for most his long life, but she had wanted to hurt the Winchesters, and Cas wouldn’t—he couldn't—let her hurt either of them. They were his family, and family was more important than orders.
“I want to apologise,” Mary said, her eyes shining with truthfulness as she gazed at her oldest son.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I don't sleep," Cas replied, talking like it was the most normal thing in the world.
They didn't know about the golden ring hanging on a chain around Dean's neck, so no one even suggested that the hickey could have possibly been given to Dean by someone like Castiel, a premium fashion designer who had flown out for the weekend to deliver Jo's dress—and to leave Dean that little parting gift—before he’d had to fly home for a meeting with a distributor. Dean kept his wedding ring hidden because he wasn't out and everyone thought he was straight. No one assumes that a straight man will be dating another man.
for almost two weeks now, and it was amazing. They were using some really interesting urban legends which he got to research and incorporate into his designs, he was meeting new people—some of whom were admittedly not amazing, but many who Cas could tell he would stay friends with—and most importantly of all, he was with Dean.
“I don't get a crush on every cute guy that walks in here!” Dean argued, though he knew Charlie wouldn’t listen. Okay, guys were cute, but he didn’t want to date most of them! Or ever sleep with most of them! This was all because of that one time Dean had told Charlie that he had a crush on one of their cute regulars. He hadn't done anything, and the guy he had a crush on had stopped coming one day. But ever since then… well to put it this way, this wasn't the first time Charlie had done this.
"Not like you did," Cas replied, and Dean could tell he would have been laughing if he hadn't known not to move under the needle.
The sound of Cas' low chuckle came from the darkness, along with the sound of rustling, like someone was shifting in bed, which Dean assumed was exactly what was happening. "Yes, I was aware of that," Cas said in a gentle voice, "I take it you weren't?"
Without a word, Dean pulled the ring off his right hand, switching it to his left ring finger. The correct finger.
It wasn’t the most comfortable position, the floor was hard and cold, even through the hay, and the wall wasn’t much more comfortable; but he didn’t think his legs would be able to support him while he talked. Also, he admitted privately to himself, sitting here, in Baby’s stall with her large form standing over him when he knew she wouldn’t hurt him,  made him feel small and safe in a way nothing else could. And right now, that was what he needed to feel.
I am back!! And I've gotta say... y'all are gonna enjoy this chapter...
"Yeah, looks like it. I wonder if it was the witch's? You know what they are like with animal sacrifices, and black cats are supposed to be unlucky, I wouldn’t be surprised if some ritual required one." Cas could tell from the tone that the voice was not fond of witches, something Cas felt like he had always known, while still feeling like he was only finding out about it now.
; the next moment, his husband's lips were pressed against his and he was kissing back without a care for where they were.
Dean had been looking excited about something for the last couple of weeks. He’d had long phone calls with his new agent—calls which went very quiet whenever Cas tried to listen—and Cas was certain Dean and Charlie had been plotting something the last time they met up. Cas wasn’t concerned, he’d asked Dean about it after one of those very long agent phone calls, and Dean had told him that it was a surprise, but had promised that everything was okay and that it was nothing bad. He’d been skeptical at first, but Dean had convinced him, and he was only a tiny bit worried about what this could all possibly be leading to.
