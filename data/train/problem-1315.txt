"A game-changer, a key that could break into anywhere, and it was sitting in our flat," Sherlock murmured. He knew he had to say it, but he didn't mean the 'computer code'. He meant John. "Moriarty gave clues, he gave clues when he broke into those places. He meant for the people to see one thing and me to see another. Moriarty knew what would get me in the end."
"What the bloody hell 'other appointment' do I have?! I want to go back to my office and drink until I forget this whole thing ever happened, and sod anyone that tries to get in my way," Mycroft said angrily, having let his façade go before he could stop it. "I broke my little brother's heart,
Sherlock and Harry waited on the couch for John to finish, Harry because she was hungry, and Sherlock because he liked having John's attention on him. It was entirely irrational, but then, this whole emotions business was. He hadn't expected John to agree to the proposition of being boyfriends so easily. Maybe it had something to do with the...no, never mind, there was no logical reason why John would ever want to date someone like Sherlock. He pondered it for a while, but Harry broke his concentration with a wave of her hand.
Soon the press of lips upon lips overtook all of Sherlock's outer senses. His mind palace stored no recollections or even formed memories of what he saw in the dilating of John's pupils, the erratic beat of his heart, the heat that spread through both their skins, but this emblazoned itself in every corner, making itself unable to be deleted. Sherlock could keep that forever.
"Of course. I do things if people ask me nicely." A small grin spread over John's face. "I should probably know your name if we're going to be fake boyfriends."
Sherlock paced in the sitting room, violin case in hand. He never thought John would make the relationship so real. The kisses and the touching and how on earth did that man do it? Sherlock didn't think it would get this far. He meant the experiment to be temporary, until John got tired of him, but that hadn't happened. John
"Are you sure he has?" John asked, feeling a wrenching sensation in his chest that reminded him of his limp: existing, but with no reason. A phantom ache. It didn't make sense.
John sat back. If Sherlock used a swear word, things were serious. "I won't care. We've done enough dangerous, stupid things that nothing you do can scare me away. Even breaking into Baskerville again."
"Now that we've started our day," John winked, "with a very interesting conversation no less, what do you say about breakfast?"
John just smiled. "What a happy coincidence. I'll be in the bathroom brushing my teeth." He left the room.
Clara took the mobile back. "From what I've seen, John loves and wants to marry you just as much as you do. And if you're so worried about it, ask him yourself! We can only give advice; he can give you answers. Please, don't make the mistake of thinking you aren't loved. Harry and I did, and the only reason we're together now is because we talked it out."
After those three awful days, John was eerily calm. When Harry mentioned the name Sherlock Holmes, it was like the man never existed in the first place. Harry threw the most painful memories Johnny had told her right back at him, but he responded with nothing more than a cold "I don't know what you're talking about".
Sherlock didn't get it for a moment, but once he did, his face flushed deeply. "I have never been in a relationship, much less a sexual one."
"Yes, that works," he whispered to Sherlock, feeling the adrenaline begin to rush through his body. They walked backward a few steps. "So what do we do now?"
"But you have to." Mycroft had turned away from Sherlock, unable to look at him. "There is nothing you can do to stop it, besides killing him, which I know no one on this earth can do."
"I..." Clara ran a finger over Harry's cheekbone, "...want..." and tapped her nose, "...to..." and traced that finger over Harry's bottom lip. "...kiss you."
Both men blushed, but Sherlock's was more invisible than John's. "It is amazing that she can shout even though she should be getting a hangover sometime soon," John remarked. Sherlock nodded, neither of them moving their hands.
"Who knew you could throw down drinks like that?" a rough, masculine voice that Mycroft wished many times he'd forgotten remarked.
Sherlock knew that there was a good chance John would leave him for a while after this. It was one of the reasons he'd formulated the experiment after all, so that he would be free of the hurt his actions caused the doctor that in turn hurt himself. Apparently, that plan had gone up in flames. He tapped his fingers restlessly on the kitchen counter-top, waiting for John to come back. Clara was right, he had to confront John about his perceived observations.
Molly put a look that resembled the motion of shoulder shrugging on her face. "I gave you your opportunity. I wanted to be on your side, remember?"
The doctor in John's head began to do some nasty calculating. The Bridge was around nine meters above the river, and Sherlock had jumped from it, accelerating 9.8 meters per second. Sherlock had fallen for only a couple seconds, crashing into hypothermic water, having been going pretty fast before. "SHITE." John awkwardly shuffled forward, reaching out with one hand to feel around for a body.
Clara smiled back and smoothly went back to the break room. It was nice feeling like Kate cared more about her than the work. Refreshing. The door to the room was still ajar, Clara not having closed it when she left the first time. Harry hadn't moved a muscle, it felt like, not a joint shifted nor a hair out of place. She carefully tiptoed forward, making sure her shoes didn't squeak on the floor. When Clara finally reached Harry's side, she knelt next to the sleeping woman. Harry looked more like a girl while asleep, though. Clara remembered that.
"Oh yes, it is. Plus, you owe me for dragging her out of here. I don't think you could accomplish it with your stature."
"You're welcome." Harry hung up the phone, and Clara put her own mobile back down on the bedside table. Harry still loved her back. She actually fell asleep that night, and didn't wake up until ten am. Maybe it wasn't a person sleeping beside her she needed. Maybe it was just Harry.
It’s hard to put into words. Eventually, he says “You’re my best friend,” and it doesn’t even begin to cover it.
“Sh-” John’s voice is loud, and he bites his fist to quiet himself. “Cheeky. Pass me the lube and come here.”
John blinks. "Al...right. Well, how often can I expect these invites? I don't mind, of course. Just want to know how many Sherlock's skipped out on in the last few years."
Still hesitant, Sherlock nodded and turned away. Keeping sure to limit his touch to bare professionalism, John treated the wound and dabbed cream over it. He did also take the time to visually examine Sherlock’s back - he’d been given the opportunity, after all, and it would be stupid to waste it.
about it, sure, but not with any expectation it would actually happen. When he comes home from work and Sherlock isn't in the kitchen or lounge, John assumes he's out on some sort of case. Trudging up the second flight of stairs, he doesn't notice the things that, in retrospect, told him quite clearly where Sherlock is.
sign. Sherlock dips his chin slightly and continues closer as John's admirer refuses to be dissuaded.
. I love you.” Sherlock's face lit up, and he continued, buoyed on by the relief and joy written in his mouth and eyes.  “I love you so much, can I kiss you forever? I
“I was quite unable to stretch the skin of my back at all without splitting something open again. There were only a couple lines that cut deep, but Mycroft of course ensured London’s best practicing doctors were available to assist me.”
The kettle boils right as I hear the shower shut off. His cup of tea stays on the table, and I take my own and sit in my chair.
"S'nice. Sends a shiver right up my spine. I guess that's why it gets so linked to sex, you know? It's
Sherlock is lying expectantly on the mattress when he returns, tracing a finger in meandering swirls over his lower stomach and upper thighs. He sits up when John approaches the bed.
When he pushes open his bedroom door, the image of Sherlock lying on his bed, pushing fingers into himself as he strokes his cock sears itself behind his eyelids before he slams the door.
Sherlock staggers up to rifle through a cupboard and argues quietly with the VHS player for a few moments. He returns with the remote control, and a second of static clears into what John briefly thinks is Sherlock holding an infant, until he realises it is of course Will holding a tiny Sherlock.
“I know. I want to.” He rocked into him, mouthing at all the skin he could reach, running his hands over and over everywhere his lips couldn't.  Reaching around and under Sherlock, he followed Sherlock’s hand as he stroked himself.
Sherlock responded only by pressing closer against him until he had to lie back and let him wedge a knee between his hip and the back of the couch. He stayed where he was on hands and knees over John’s body, and after a long moment of enthusiastic but stationary kissing, John slipped a hand between them to stroke Sherlock’s chest.
“Are you kidding me, Sherlock?” John inched the chair closer again, leaned in to stare at Sherlock. “You’re gorgeous.”
John had thought he had plans, but Sherlock is devious, and after a time he finds himself desperately trying not to collapse onto Sherlock as he straddles him, an exquisitely long finger driving him mad with its caresses inside him.
“Oh, fuck off with the marriage counsellor stuff, Sherlock. Having a fake relationship with Janine for a month does not make you an expert.”
“Well. We could… I mean if you want to, I’d like to try perhaps, penetrative -” he cut himself off and took a deep breath. “Come with me to my room, and then come with me. In me?” High points of colour spread on his cheeks.
John moved away enough for Sherlock to sit up and throw off his t-shirt, wriggle out of his pyjama pants. Then he was pulled on top of John, mouths and torsos and erections and thighs pressing together.
“Okay, it’s alright, I’ve got you.” Leaning back, he watched as Sherlock’s body accepted more of him into itself, and bit his cheek against his impulses.
On evenings when he was like this, he begged Sherlock to let him stay at Baker St, telling Mary he was helping on a case, not wanting to bring her into his grief. He supposed that probably had some part to play in their marriage dissolving before the summer.  When the final card was played, he found himself knocking on the doorframe to 221B, leaning in to the loungeroom.
“That was-” Grabbing Sherlock at the shoulders, he kissed him soundly. “That was bloody lovely. Can I… ? ” he snuck a hand under Sherlock’s t-shirt and trailed it down to the band of his pyjama pants.
He finds himself burying his hands further under the blanket to knead gently around knees and further, working carefully on thighs. It’s
“That was satisfying, wasn't it.” His eyes sharpened. “Wasn't it? Of course it was, you’d say something if - but I need to be sure.”
, if you sod off to play ‘catch the murderer’ all by yourself, obviously I can’t fucking stop you. But I swear to
He just - stops, and I’m reminded of the day I asked him to be my best man, and kick myself again for not asking him to be much more that day. For not asking earlier than that, even. Pushing myself out of my chair puts me in front of him. “I’m sorry.” The words erupt from my mouth, and I cannot stop them. “That’s not fair, I never said either, I’m sorry, I love you, I’m an idiot. Stand - please stand up? I need to kiss you.”
Sherlock bit back an unexpected sobbing gasp and buried his head in the pillow beside John's ear even as his hips ground down. In a moment he had control of himself again, and kissed John's neck. He kissed John's scar, and his sternum. He ghosted breaths over the tight nubs of John's nipples, and nosed towards the musky scent of his underarms. John pushed him away but did not stop smiling.
When he felt his orgasm start to approach, a fantastical notion of coming inside Sherlock - of coming bare inside him, pushing anything that leaked out back inside with a finger - overtook him, and though he tried to stave it off he was lost, grinding hard into him with a bitten-off sound. Whether it would have been a warning or an apology, John wasn’t even sure, although he feared it could have been a confession.
"I'd very much prefer to be left alone, thanks." A deceptively soft hand catches his, and John glances at a forced grin before tearing his gaze and hand away. He can catch a glimpse of Sherlock weaving towards him, eyes flickering over the two of them at the table. Under the table, John flicks his fingers in their
“He’s not my boyfriend,” he starts unenthusiastically, before giving up entirely. Sherlock had swanned off just a moment ago - for another drink, a toilet stop, a cigarette, or a scuffle with a criminal - anything was possible. All John knows is that he is stranded at this pub table until Himself reappears, and the only explanation or instruction he had received was “I need to find out whether this case is worth taking. Don’t draw attention to yourself.” He supposes that last bit is about to become more difficult, as an oily grin spreads across leonine features and the stranger helps himself to a seat.
The corpse told Sherlock as much as they always did, and John grumbled good-naturedly and kept a lookout while Sherlock broke into the victim’s boyfriend’s house.
“You said we’d have to pretend one of us is not who we are, for the case. You said I could play Alpha. But you’re not attracted to Alphas, which ruins the pretence somewhat if we say we are married. You’re not a very good actor, you know.”
on… three conditions. We are not taking any cases until it’s fixed. If it doesn’t work we go to your mother immediately. If you damage yourself again like this you tell me
"It suits you," John mumbles. He uses his foot to rub Sherlock's leg, turning back to the television to watch little Liam/Sherlock show off silently with Redbeard. Marie had clearly taken charge of the camera, as Will begins joining in, roughhousing with Redbeard and laughing with his son.
"Like you can talk," John snaps. After a brief period in his early twenties where he looked into surgery to remove his reproductive system, he’s mostly come to terms with what he is. He’s not comfortable with people fetishising his gender, though, and tries (fairly successfully) to keep it under wraps. His flatmate, on the other hand, makes the most of people’s assumptions, not for his own comfort, but merely for convenience.
“Yes,” Sherlock answered, and adjusted his unfastened dressing gown, inviting John to admire his form. He blinked slowly, and moved closer.
John moves back in and they don't waste any more time on that not-tearing-each-other's-clothes-off business.
Soon Sherlock twisted in place and leaned back into the cushions, John following closely after. He thrust his hips into Sherlock’s, kissed him sweetly as he shifted, and thrust again.
Sherlock grabbed his wrist, jamming John’s hand under his hips so he could feel his satin cock, stiffer than he expected. “I am, and you may.”
“Yes, but-” John cannot hear what he says next, as he has buried his head in the pillow by John’s shoulder. There are things he wants to say, things he needs to make sure Sherlock knows too, but he is
‘Happy’ doesn’t even begin to describe how John feels, but as they climb the steps to their flat, nerves start to creep and nibble at the edges. Sherlock is well inside before John’s finished climbing the stairs, and is curled up on their couch.
Sherlock lost all track of time, of the entire world beyond his body and the sensations John was eliciting. The kiss was drugging, and although the stroking touch on his side was technically fairly chaste, he was steadily becoming more erect. But John did not touch his penis. He bucked his hips.
Much of the night was spent on her violin, first as an accompaniment to filing the case in her mind, and later to soothe John as she tossed and turned in her bedroom above, occasionally crying out in her nightmare. She continued as John abruptly went silent, probably awake. Minutes later, she pretended not to notice John pad into the room and nestle into her chair.
"You can't tell me we aren't a bit cramped, here. What if I laid you out on your mattress, and undressed you bit by bit? I could kiss you from head to toe. I could lie beside you, or between your beautiful legs, or-"
Hands slide over his cheeks, and he opens his eyes in surprise. Sherlock is on the floor in front of him, his face close.
As it's Mum's birthday, Will has cooked, and a simple but delicious-smelling selection of plates and dishes weigh down the table. John finds himself sitting opposite Mycroft, who is, as it turns out, rather personable. His leg is going to be bruised from Sherlock jabbing him under the table whenever he speaks to Mycroft, but on the whole he can't say he minds overmuch, because Sherlock is actually eating.
“I don’t know if- I don’t know what you want, John.” Despite his flushed skin and kiss-swollen lips, he looked nervous.
Sherlock drew himself up into his most imposing pose, looking down his nose at John. John cocked a hand on his hip and pointed, unmoved.
“Turned out half true,” John murmurs, and receives a poke to the arch of his foot. An unbelievably young Mycroft strides onto screen, and on the couch, Sherlock hits the button to fast-forward. When the video plays again, it shows Sherlock a little older than in the photograph, running around a yard, chasing and being chased by Redbeard.
Sherlock set his mobile down on the table. John was in the shower, having stated immediately when they got back to the flat that he needed to get clean at all costs. Sherlock didn't blame him; his fiance (?) wasn't as used to getting dirty on cases as he was. He smirked when he remembered the pig's blood all over him before the Baskerville case. The trident was fun as well.
"Thank you, boys," she said. John grabbed a spoon from the silverware drawer and handed it to her. She served herself, and Sherlock served her a slice of cake after that. He had always had a fondness for Mrs. Hudson. She never called him a Freak, she never threatened to kick him out of the building, she even accepted the severed limbs, which was quite novel. Plus, Mrs. Hudson took care of him a lot more than he took care of himself. He owed her for that, and for keeping John alive until the memory-loss serum kicked in. She helped John and himself, and if she left Baker Street, London would fall.
Sherlock was struck by how similar everything seemed. Not just the words and the players of parts, but the
"Sherlock, are you okay?" John's feet dug into the strange sand of the banks, walking down and away from him.
A little later, John received a phone call that woke him up. Sherlock was rolling and bouncing a blue rubber bouncy ball with one hand and catching it with the other. John thought, in that split second before he answered his phone, that the moment felt ominous, like he was about to get bad news. But Sherlock knew it too.
"Now dig in, both of you." John had come back with a yellow bag in his hands. Harry had three pancakes on her plate, while Sherlock had one, but once he had a hold of the chocolate chips, the two were about even.
Sherlock came down first, his sheet not having moved at all. John wondered if he had a clip that he used to hold it in place. Harry looked far more chipper than she usually would be. She was not at all a morning person. "Mornin', Johnny," she said cheerfully, practically skipping to the table.
Sherlock noted the words 'used to'. It was true; he hadn't thought of himself as a sociopath since...a long time ago. And he was finding he didn't miss the term. Everything made more sense without the explanation of sociopathic tendencies. Sociopaths didn't understand nor want to be a part of human interaction, but Sherlock
Sherlock ran a hand through his hair, but forgot that John was asleep beside him. John shifted on the bed, turning more towards Sherlock. He didn't move until he was sure John was still asleep.
And the blush was back, in full force. "We...er...engaged each other sexually...and I woke up on the couch. Um..."
"Would you please just do as I ask?!" He hated sounding desperate. Desperate was boring, desperate was normal. Everyone was desperate, and he used to be the cool and calm one. Moriarty had accused him of being ordinary, and this was why. Desperate and in love. Who would have thought it? "Stand right there and look up," Sherlock continued. "I'm on the bridge."
The detective looked down at the bundle of human beauty in his arms. There was nothing he could do now but put him to bed, and wait. Wait for all the memories to come back, wait for the fear to come back. Because it would.
"Y'all make a cute couple. Nice to see more of us around London, especially as close as you two look."
"You are exactly correct, John. She was prying," Sherlock said, face shifting slightly. He looked much happier now that John was back, but that couldn't have been the reason. John was imagining things. "I haven't had pancakes in a long time. Do you have any chocolate chips?" he continued eagerly.
He looked up. "Yeah, you can head out now." Harry gave him a worried glance before heading out the door to 221B.
John realized how easily this could become his life. Crime-solving, Harry living with them until she had some spot of luck, being with Sherlock all the time. Mostly that. He could fall into this, and never come back. He wouldn't care at all if this was everything he knew for the rest of his life.
"Gave you my number," an Irish-accented, sing-song voice said. "Thought you would call." Mycroft immediately slid his phone open and speed-dialed four.
"I didn't know that," Harry protested wetly. "I had this crazy idea that we'd get better, but I ended up a shit-faced drunk on the side of the road, and you...you obviously weren't okay. I checked on you with Kate every time I came to Tesco, before I wanted to take you back, and she said you'd picked up a bunch of shifts, and couldn't sleep, and was just functioning, not living. I was so convinced..." She broke off, covering her face to wipe off tears. Clara hadn't seen Harry wear mascara very often, so to see it running in black streaks down her cheeks really sucked.
"But you are." He looked up to Sherlock's face in surprise. Darkness shrouded the walls, but a single beam of streetlamp light threw his features into a sort of impressionist relief. Still beautiful, John thought.
"So, how long have you known Sherlock?" he asked. Mrs. Hudson had put a plate of biscuits on the kitchen and was nibbling on one when he sat down.
"Neither do I." Nobody spoke for a while, Sherlock and John both trying not to slip under the influence completely.
"That was John from a different time. He was sent back to that time and place, as you could probably tell from the Buckingham Palace idea. He's getting his memories back, memories of the time I was a part of his life."
Harry was going to say she was so glad he was happy, since she worried about him, but then she was hit with a thought. Her 'magic power' hadn't disappeared with Clara. Johnny was in love with Sherlock.
Angelo went back to the kitchen and returned with two takeaway boxes in his large hand. "Enjoy, and tell Sherlock hello from me!"
"Sherlock," John said. "You better explain this, because I'm not getting it." Why did Sherlock look so heartbroken? He had been wrong since the Yarders showed up and John could see the signs. What was happening that John didn't know about? Hell would freeze over before he let this go.
Sherlock sighed. "Of course, you see but do not observe. No smell of alcohol on me, and I just told you something I've never said to a single other person. Please believe me."
"Yep." Harry longingly kissed her wife. "But we should get dressed first. We don't want to scare my big bro or his almost-virgin boyfriend."
"That's all Moriarty needs. The screaming and then a photograph of me being taken in for questioning. He wants to destroy me," Sherlock breathed. "Inch by inch. It is a
Many people had been in the flat, his tired mind thought. Many different women, one with a snarky tone, a man that had been infernally nasty to both John and...someone else. A kind man, one that had only come in for business and once for a...drugs bust? No, that couldn't have been it. Another man with a posh voice, who'd had intelligent yet very childish arguments with...that someone. It wasn't John, he knew that much. But the drugs bust, where had that come from?
Lestrade shook his head. "It doesn't matter. I made a mistake sometime during that year, and obviously Sally didn't. End of story. Next question, where were you during the last
"Okay. Thanks for letting me use your break room," she said, slipping off the blanket and standing up.
Sherlock looked at the clock next to John's bed. Perfect. This time of morning would be best to get the information from Harriet. He carefully shifted out of his partner's arms and tiptoed to the closed door. John just barely moved, letting out a breath of air, and then going back to sleep. Sherlock smiled; he wanted John to get at least some sleep. He'd learned that although he didn't really need it, people like John did, so he tried to not disturb him.
John's body swayed a little, his legs wanting to give out. Freezing numbness could only last so long without hurting someone. "Sherlock," he called weakly. "Now would be a good time. Imissyou. I...miss you." The Thames kept flowing, but Sherlock was nowhere in sight. "I LOVE YOU!"
John knew something wasn't right when he woke up in the middle of the night without a warm body curled up against him. Namely, a thin, pale as marble body that was surprisingly angled. Sherlock wasn't there.
Her shift, well, her extra shift, would be over in a few minutes, and then she could meet Irene and see what she wanted to talk about.
John shook his head. What the hell was that? He went into the main part of the flat to greet his sister, who was groaning and moaning. "Johnny, I need ibuprofen, now!"
"Yes, thank you." She smiled at Clara. "One of my...one of the people..." She looked confused. "I'm not really sure what to call him, but he needs some hydrogen peroxide for an experiment, and he refuses to go out and get it for himself." The woman sighed. "It's complicated. Anyway, the stuff seems to have disappeared."
While John wandered into the sitting room, contemplating what the gestures meant, Sherlock banged his head once on the cupboards. He wasn't sure how long he could last like this, hiding from old John, hiding from new John. He'd learned lying to the army doctor was always worse than telling the truth.
." John smiled. Sherlock was like a child, a little bit. He didn't know things that most people did, and knew things that most people would never know. A paradox. A very handsome paradox.
Within this silence and stillness suddenly rang a song. "Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive. Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive."
Well, no use worrying about it, Sherlock would definitely say something about what happened when he came out of his (their) room for breakfast.
John hadn't really been in love since his girlfriend Grace. She was beautiful and perfect in every way, and John had been utterly smitten. Of course, that was before she cheated on him, and asked for expensive things, and took his virginity. He didn't stay with girlfriends much after that.
The doctor knew about loss. It brushed the corners of his mind sometimes, but he had pushed it so far away that he wondered what he was mourning. All the dreams John had with the mysterious pain faded as soon as he woke, so he never remembered them. He still felt a part of himself missing.
He was fully dressed, in a shirt Sherlock had seen many times, but the combination of the jeans and shirt was the same as...some other night. Well, day. John didn't look at Sherlock awkwardly, like he thought he would, but with a sort of laughter in his eyes. Childlike. Sherlock blandly noticed he'd left a pile of his clothing on the coffee table, a black . He grinned slightly, looked Sherlock over, down and up, and down again, where the grin widened slightly.
"Hey, baby," a familiar voice answered. "I'm drunk, and exhausted, and my brother screwed up, and screwed his boyfriend, and I'm not sure this isn't a dream since you probably changed your phone number, but I wanted to hear your voice, so yeah." Harry sounded so beat-down. Clara couldn't help but talk to her.
A knock sounded at the door. "Aren't you going to open the door, dear Clara?" Irene asked, raising a perfectly plucked eyebrow.
"Moriarty's been playing with you, can't you see what's going on?" His voice had a note of pleading to it.
John put his face in his hands, thinking. This was very important, but he had no clue why or how. Something about him and Sherlock made the detective uncomfortable, but he didn't know whether that was the closeness, or how close they had yet to get. John knew Sherlock was 'married to his work', John knew he'd had a huge number of girlfriends, John knew he was the closest thing Sherlock had to a friend. But, the common frustration, what the hell was it supposed to mean?!
Her mood swung back and forth like a pendulum during those final days, ecstatically happy one minute, furious later, and depressed another minute. Harry kept asking if she loved her, and Clara kept answering yes. The bottles disappeared, and the bottles came back. Harry would cry for hours, drunk off her arse, and Clara would cry for hours, perfectly sober. Sleep was out of reach, and Clara had never wanted it more.
"Why are you leaving? I love you and I will always love you!" Clara's voice was cracking, and God, did it break Harry's alcohol-sullied heart, but it had to happen.
John smiled, or rather, smiled more. He didn't seem to stop smiling these days, especially when Sherlock was involved. "Good." He somehow unwove himself from the detective's grip and stood up, still connected to his boyfriend by one hand. "Now, come on. You might be able to convince me to put the chocolate in the pancake batter."
Sherlock was getting pretty caught up in all of this. He just wanted his violin earlier, he didn't know that John would do
Somehow, he knew what he'd answer the not-familiar, yet beautiful stranger. It made absolutely no sense, but the sentence came out all the same. "I'll do it."
"I don't know any such 'magic words'," Sherlock said, voice vibrating into John's shoulder. "I was just asking a question."
Of course, John had to pick this time to cry. "John, John, John," his fiancé whispered. "I love you."
"For God's sake, this man was on trial!" John gestured wildly to 'Moriarty', who hadn't moved a muscle since the exchange began.
In a way, both of them were right. It was a connection, a bond, a don't-let-go-of-me-even-if-you-want-to. Sherlock knew that kind of feeling too painfully, and John did also, but it stayed below the surface.
"I need to take this, boys." Moriarty slid his phone from his pocket. "Hello?" He paused, listening to the person on the other end. "
Irene could hear them crying below, and it got her very interested in a probably inappropriate way considering the circumstances, but it was worth it.
, living in 221B until eternity catches up with you. But I know and I've accepted that will not happen. And believe me, I wish the memories won't come back as well."
"This next one is from early November. He talked about not being able to find a job, and there's a weird sentence in there about the gun he hid in his bedside table." Sherlock took the paper from her. The writing was even more structured, John was trying to stay in control more. It almost hurt to deduce this letter.
Sherlock walked a few steps toward Jim, a little, dangerous smirk on his face. "Don't touch me!" Jim shouted. "Don't lay a finger on me!"
"No, my love." John dropped a kiss into Sherlock's hair. "It's okay. I had nightmares like this for months after I came back from the war. They stop eventually."
Sherlock laughed, and God in heaven was that the most brilliant, loveable, sexy, (etc. etc.) thing John Watson had ever heard. "I would have married you without a ring, and with Anderson and Mycroft as our witnesses in a dirty courthouse." He leaned down to brush John's lips with his own. "Yes. Yes, yes and yes
Sherlock felt like laughing. It wasn't funny at all, but he felt like laughing. Perhaps it had to do with aftereffects of the vision (he refused to think of it as a prediction. "Look at me, John. I'm afraid. I'm so afraid of something that isn't real. He would think I was going soft."
Kate rolled her eyes. "Darling, she's worried, and slightly drunk. You should help her, even just this once."
John laughed. "I'll be right back." He stood up and went into their bedroom. John did actually have a ring, but he'd been saving it for a very long time, too long. It used to be his grandmother's, before she died, and she'd left it to him in her will. John had been waiting years to give it to someone, to
John smiled. "Glad we're in agreement then." He made a move to slip off Sherlock, but the detective pulled him back down.
When Harry left, things got better and worse at the same time. Sleep was still out of reach, Clara pulling all-nighters every other night, but the alcohol was gone, and the mood swings went away. And Harry, the one person Clara was absolutely certain she loved, was gone. It almost didn't matter what she'd done (Clara still hadn't forgiven her, for the record), but life without Harry was much worse than life with her.
"Your guess is as good as mine, dear. Sherlock's always been a sort of mystery man. Always alone, always solving murders. If he had someone, just one person, I wouldn't worry about him so much."
"I may be drunk, but I'm not stupid. I mean, I'll probably forget I made this phone call, but it doesn't change the fact that my life is nothing without you. I'm sorry it took me so long to tell you."
"Harry, did you have any luck finding Clara?" John asked, having decided not to think about his boyfriend and the way his back curved as he reached up to put some biscuits in a high place.
John stared at him, angrily and in disbelief. "What evidence is there to prove my sister lived here? You've never even met her!"
"Well, right now, you should be focusing your attention on the food your lovely boyfriend just made you." He pecked Sherlock on the cheek.
Sherlock cocked his head to the side, which looked kind of difficult to accomplish on the sand. "I'm selfish for not considering your feelings? Is that all this was about?" The detective flushed slightly. "You called me names because you still love me?"
"I was going to just ask you to peek your head in, but I'm finding this view much better," the doctor whispered, running his hands over Sherlock's sides and hips. That t-shirt was thinner but just as revealing as glass, accentuating all the scars John had kissed, all the past injuries John had catalogued, all the things that differentiated this man from everyone else. Sherlock's normally curly hair was plastered to his skull, and his eyes were glowing brightly. His jeans were darkening with water, his feet were bare, and his hands were just as careful. Beautiful. "I want to kiss you, Sherlock."
As soon as he put the cup in the sink, rinsing it out, as he was sure someone would appreciate, Sherlock walked slowly to the thankfully vacated couch and sat down, rearranging the sheet around himself. His and John's relationship was surely never going back to the way it used to be. Now that
person. But to have had none? It was so much better to have loved and lost than never loved at all, and Sherlock didn't. Before John could apologize for that, even though it wasn't at all his fault, Sherlock spoke again.
"You want something from me specifically. I see the way you've been staring at me lately, like I have something you crave but can't reach. It's maddening, it infuriates you, but you're scared. Why would you be scared of me?"
Everything burned: his legs, his hands, his head. Moriarty was an sadistic, psychotic ass, but he was so hatefully right about the burning. "That man had NO IDEA I would burn with you, did he? Moriarty NEVER knew that." John's voice hadn't gotten any quieter since he first yelled Sherlock's name. He knew he would scream his lungs out if it got the detective back to him.
Harry let out a short burst of laughter. "Liar, liar, pants on fire. Johnny and Locky kissing in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G! First comes love, then comes death!"
I'm digging out my HTML skills to post here and they're really dusty. If you see any inconsistencies I would love to know so I can get better. Thanks guys!
Sherlock put his violin down on the small table next to him, and turned in John's arms. He looked John straight in the eyes, entrancing him with his ever-changing orbs. "No. But now that you're here, the numbers on the inscription have been going up every day."
Mycroft could have laughed right then, laughed long and loud even when he was dying inside. He needed a drink, quite badly. "Yes, I am here for the good news."
His brother smiled, smiled so wide the corners of his eyes crinkled. "Amazing." He turned to the doctor, who was sitting on the couch. "John, this is my brother Mycroft, who appears to be doing very well on his diet, contrary to popular belief."
The first kiss happened three dates later. Harry was determined to take things slow, especially since she was completely in the dark about the whole
The silence was getting a bit old, but John knew better than to say anything. The situation was delicate. Knowing Sherlock, it was more than delicate, it was probably destructive.
"Alright, let's get out of here." Sherlock and John started to walk towards the exit, and Mycroft noticed the breathing from the other device getting faster and faster.
Sleep became difficult again, Harry staying up in the living room for hours into the night. She smelled like alcohol all the time, and Clara tried to make her stop. She tried the rehab places, she tried hiding the liquor, she tried threatening to leave once, she tried and tried and tried. But she failed. Harry and Clara, once so easy, were now hard, and Clara didn't know what more she could do.
"Why is no one's first love happy? Why can no one be happy with their first chance?" Sherlock wondered.
Sherlock leaned over John and wrapped his arms around the shorter man. "Is something wrong, Sherlock?" John asked worriedly.
John hugged him close. "It's okay. I'm here to help you this time." God, why was John being so nice about this? Sherlock messed up his birthday once, and jumped off a roof before he could set it right. Not that his lovely boyfriend remembered, but Sherlock knew too well.
"You've got to get me out of here, you've got to get me out. The big lab, the first lab that we saw." Sherlock pulled his mobile away from his mouth and growled, louder this time.
"John doesn't love Sherlock right now, and made some pretty clear signs he didn't in front of Holmes. And he did it after having sex with him,
Sherlock didn't look convinced, but he said it anyway. "I'm in love with John Watson. You know him, don't you?"
Inside, John saw Sherlock's tall figure stooped over the stove. It smelled like sweetness in the kitchen. "What're you making that you need milk?" John asked, standing behind him and trying (read: failing) to look over his shoulder to see what was in the pan.
The detective's mask fell far, farther than John had ever seen it go. "Your memories were gone, and in order to get them back, I had to recreate them. It was the easiest way to do it, but not for me." Sherlock paused. "The mind isn't as stable as everyone thinks it is, and yours is no different. Your mind had to begin and remain intact, and so, I fixed it the way it was made."
"I've loved you since...I don't know. Maybe the first time I saw you, or the crime scene," Sherlock murmured. He was telling the truth. He'd loved John since the lab, when they first met, or the pink lady's murder, or Angelo's restaurant, or when he realized John killed a man to save his life. Sherlock didn't even remember, because it was so sudden. "I love you, John Watson, more than anything."
"That would be lovely." John walked in, remembering suddenly that the first time he'd come in here, he'd relied on his cane to move anywhere. He didn't even know where his cane was anymore. Sherlock had probably stolen and used it for an experiment. The genius loved experiments, John had discovered over the couple of weeks they'd been...fake boyfriends? Real boyfriends? Rebounders? He shook his head, trying to clear it. He had questions.
"He's playing sad music," John called into the empty space. "Won't eat, won't sleep. If this were anyone else, he'd be in mourning, but since he's Sherlock, I don't know what to think. He's your brother, tell me-" And here entered The Woman.
The warehouse at the very end of the line was closed, unlike the others that were all open. "Can this kidnapper get any more stupid?" Sherlock asked with a giddy laugh, pulling John over to it. John decided he really really liked this version of the detective: the crazy mad deductions master with eyes glowing silver. "You know how to kick down doors, and here's a marvelous opportunity."
"Because I already fucked it up once, and you were kind enough to provide fake reassurance concerning my lack of birthday aptitude," Sherlock answered blankly. He was past the point where swearing was undignified. Sherlock was so stupidly confused about the signals John sent that he could barely process the situation.
When John opened his eyes, he looked at the clock on his mobile. Not long after a dinner of sorts, if the takeaway boxes were any sort of evidence. His boyfriend had loud classical music on in the kitchen, since he couldn't play the violin and clean at the same time. Wait, Sherlock was cleaning?
Of course, being kidnapped was the most interesting thing that had happened to her in a long time. Especially since her brother came to save her.
Really, there was no reason for hesitation. Mycroft had important information that Sherlock had to receive. But he couldn't knock on the door any more than he could watch his brother bleed. The elder Holmes steeled himself, and raised his hand to rap on the acid-burned, badly painted, exceptionally damaged and yet still standing door that was the difference between Sherlock's perfectly intact heart and the crying mess that Mycroft comforted through the night.
"Ah, no. Harry, I'm going to confiscate all the other bottles of beer. You're going cold turkey, as is Sherlock." John stomped into the kitchen to take the remaining two glass bottles from the refrigerator.
you. So I can't let you go again. Even if you want to fix things by leaving again, it won't work. I will stay with you."
Harry took the beer bottles from their hands once she was sure both were out like lights. She finished them off with a sigh. How did her brother get into such a mess?
"Because you're amazing," she heard a man's deep voice say when she bothered to pay attention. Johnny said something in reply to that, but Harry ignored it, because she knew that voice. Sherlock Holmes was back! Her brother was going to be happy again!
Sherlock gave him a small but genuine smile. "Thank you." The Yarders nearby gaped at their exchange, but John ignored them.
Harriet had left for her room a few minutes earlier, saying something about leaving them to more pleasurable activities than talking to her. Mrs. Hudson had winked at them before leaving, taking the leftover cake. Now, Sherlock and John were alone, and Sherlock had no idea what to say.
Harry did, nearly melted at the name, but John shook his head. "The name sounds familiar, but I don't know it. Why?" Harry was in far too much of a daze to hear what happened next, something about Johnny wondering if Sherlock had gone nuts, but she did hear the last part.
One night, the night Mycroft saw Sherlock for the first time after he eradicated Moriarty's web, the dam broke.
John stared at his mobile. Who was this person, and what had he done with Sherlock Holmes? It was nice, him caring about John like that, but seriously, something wasn't right. He began to pack up his things to go home early, telling Sarah on the way out that he would make up the extra hour tomorrow. She gave him a funny look, but he didn't catch it.
John was something completely different, something he'd never seen before. Didn't it make sense to find out what the doctor felt about him?
Kate sighed. "Sometimes you remind me of a man I met once. Tall, dark, handsome. I can give you a blanket and a chair, but I don't really have anything else for you." She lifted Harry up by the armpits and attempted to carry her.
Both men made up their minds, and went back to sleep, neither one of them realizing the other had woken.
Sherlock mentally berated himself. That couldn't be what John really meant, they were both lying to get Mrs. Hudson into the flat without suspicion on her part. Of course, his logical thought process had no line to how red his cheeks were turning. Damn John! Stupid..
John pressed his lips against the detective's, slowly slipping his tongue in. Sherlock met him, movement for movement, fingers winding through John's short hair, and pulling their heads closer together. John's hands were laced behind Sherlock's neck, reaching up after a little while to twirl one of the detective's curls around his finger. They didn't take it any further. Besides, neither one of them wanted to do
"Yes, 'oh'. You told me all sorts of things, mainly that you were sorry and your brother and his boyfriend were doing exactly what we are doing, with the feelings avoidance and things like that. And you...you called me beautiful and amazing and smart about these kinds of feelings." Clara's face reddened, but it felt normal. When she was married to Harry, the brunette called her all sorts of wonderful things and it elicited the same reaction. The thing was that you never got used to being called beautiful.
But knowing and doing something about it were two different things. And Harry was hit with that difference every time she took a swig.
Sherlock heard a very separate part of Harriet's conversation. "Sherlock has been in love with him since the beginning, I'm sure of it, and John used to be in love with Sherlock before the weird crap with Sherlock's suicide started..." Wait. John loved
"One of the things you should know as my boyfriend is that I have no patience at all. Apologies, but I have none to give," Sherlock huffed curtly. "Harriet, we will drug you. My brother has ways and means that I have no wish to think about to knock you out for several days."
John huffed. "You fucking scared me. And pissed me off. And made me find your body in a disgusting river during wintertime. And yes," John said, "I'm aware it's not technically winter yet." He leaned down to whisper in Sherlock's ear. "But through all of that, and by all of that I mean
As John ate, he watched the detective. John had weaknesses for dark hair, and curly or wavy hair, so having someone with both traits, especially one like Sherlock, with his brilliant mind and a face like a fallen angel's, had a great possibility of making this relationship go very far very fast. But that wasn't the aim of the relationship, John reminded himself. The point was for Sherlock to move on, and find someone else once John bored him.
Sherlock rustled his coat for a few seconds, but John didn't know why until the shower curtain opened, the detective stepping fully clothed into the stream of water. He was wearing the t-shirt and jeans again, John couldn't believe he hadn't noticed before, and the water quickly suctioned the shirt to his skin. John licked his lips as he stared at his fiancé. Damn, that man had him wrapped around his little finger.
The journal had one entry, dated the day before. John had never seen the journal in his life, but there was an entry, in his handwriting, with his signature. It had Sherlock in it, with a case. A case that Sebastian Moran was in. Had The Great Game pieces, and The Blind Banker, and one line that John didn't recognize.
The doctor laughed almost hysterically. "Why can you not understand when someone cares very much for you?"
When she was younger, it wasn't a problem. She was an only child with a single mother, and her mom never minded company. The two of them would plan and dream about life ahead before crashing in the bed that could still hold one more person. It wasn't a big deal when she was a child, and her mother was still there.
Clara shook her head. "You never change, do you? The whole self-hating, 'the world doesn't like me' crap because of alcoholism and a general lack of love concerning yourself. You gave me a speech like this a few nights ago." Of course, Harry said she probably wouldn't remember that phone call, but Clara had to bring it up anyway.
He turned his attention away from their chest, shifting to the two's position. John didn't have to open his eyes to feel how entwined their legs were, John's head buried in the spot where the neck met the shoulder, the other's arm encircling his back protectively. He felt loved.
Sherlock looked up at him. "You did?" As John nodded, he shook his head. "Of course you did. PTSD, psychosomatic limp, intermittent tremor in your left hand. Nightmares are common." He immediately regretted saying that, looking at John's quizzical expression. "Who stopped them for you?"
Sherlock didn't do anything John could hear for a few seconds, and then he felt the genius' hand brush his hair away from his forehead. "It'll be alright soon," he nearly inaudibly whispered. "You'll be mine again when the game is won. Nothing else will keep you away from me." Sherlock leaned down to press a gentle kiss to John's forehead. "I promise I'll fix this."
"Alright. I'll have to go next door, however, to fetch clothing," Sherlock replied smoothly. John really didn't want him to go, Sherlock was warm and smelled like spice and lab chemicals and he liked it too much, but saying that aloud was another matter. He let him go, stalking quickly into his own bedroom to put on a nicer shirt and pants. Somehow, he didn't think Sherlock would care, which was completely true, but he had habits that were difficult to break.
"Stop looking at me like that. I'm not a nice person like you. You help people and I hurt them for my own purposes." Mycroft leaned back on the bar, swinging his legs around the barstool and waving his umbrella around Greg's form. "I even hurt you, and my little brother, and my brother's fiancé. So no, you're going to stop looking at me like you used to and find another pub to be nice to men in."
John stood up, straightening his clothing and walking into the kitchen. A pot of very cold tea sat on the counter, but John had no idea how it had gotten there. He dumped it out into the sink and filled it with new water, setting the teapot on the stove to heat up. Heat. Bad thing to think about. John shook his head like a dog, trying to clear it. Damn, this was a lot harder than he thought. Hard.
"Harriet Watson...!" Clara broke off, moving to wipe the teardrops from her cheeks. "You...are...notgoing! No! You can't!"
God, how could he have been so stupid? This exceeded even Anderson's level of idiocy! What if...John didn't love him back? It was possible; Sherlock had come up with this whole experiment (wince) and dragged him into it, there was no reason why John would feel anything for him other than perhaps friendship, and even that was a 'long shot' as people said. John had no reason to love a consulting detective who had hurt the one thing that mattered.
"I think so. I guess I just spaced out." He paused, trying to reorient himself. "Now, what do you two want for breakfast?"
When the cab pulled up to the door, John stepped out, tipping Liz a bit more than he did most cabbies. She was pretty nice, and wouldn't try to flirt with him like most women over the age of thirty. Geez, he should hang out with lesbians more often. Being hit on got kind of old, especially since Sherlock would scare the women off after maybe three dates.
It was like Sherlock had laid all the puzzle pieces in front of him, muddled up and in the wrong spots, and asked John to put them together three-dimensionally. Something was going on in Sherlock's mind, and John would try his damnedest to figure it out.
Sherlock decided then that he would do anything to solve this puzzle. He wanted the one person he'd ever loved back in his life the way he used to be. Sherlock knew it was selfish, somewhere in a forgotten corner of his mind palace, but chose to ignore it. This was all he had, and he was going to get it back.
The pathologist smiled. "You're welcome, Clara." Molly picked up her groceries, including the hydrogen peroxide, and went to check out. Clara headed into the break room to apologize to Kate. She wasn't doing her job, and although she was infinitely better now, that didn't enable her to break contracts.
John had a suspicion that Sherlock wasn't telling the truth, contrary to what the genius thought. Sherlock always got a tiny line dented into his forehead when he lied. But why would he lie about something like that? It confused John, and he furrowed his brow, thinking. Sherlock saw that, and kissed him gently on the spot. He wasn't used to being able to kiss John whenever he wanted, so it still felt a little bit awkward.
As soon as John saw the sapphire ring again, the situation fell on him like a brick wall. He was going to marry his boyfriend, Sherlock Holmes, a beautiful madman that had never meant to stay in the first place. But he did, and John loved him.
The other man didn't answer for a moment. "It has to do with you, your letters you sent to her updating Harriet on your life. Clara loved her and would never hurt her, and your parents are dead, so you are the only thing of importance that she has left. And you, John, are very important." John knew his face was heating up.
John woke up on the couch, fully clothed, with a terrible feeling in his chest. This wasn't where he fell asleep.
"It doesn't matter yet." Sherlock ran a finger over John's wrist. "How about we shop around some jewelry stores and find you a ring, and then tell Angelo the amazing news when we eat dinner there?"
Catching his breath, since Sherlock had drawn it out of him, John replied, "Those aren't the magic words."
Harry smacked him upside the head. "Idiot. You could have started with that. What's the problem? It obviously has to do with John."
Harry waited until he looked up at her. "So, I won't have to lose him again?" And God, didn't that make her little alcohol-poisoned heart pitter-patter. He loved her brother so much it made her want to hug him.
"I'm a natural cynic, in addition, I caused a great deal of trouble." Sherlock shrugged. "People don't come back for me on principle."
Clara melted at the name. Why did Harry have to use it? It didn't exactly help the Stay-Strong Clara mode. "It's okay, really. Do you need any advice?"
He walked up the stairs to his room, knowing he left his cake recipe in a notebook somewhere. When he dug through his drawers, he noticed a journal on his dresser. John sighed, flipping the thing open. "It has to be here somewhere," he muttered.
"Alright, John." He stepped to the front of the little group, striding into the kitchen. Mrs. Hudson followed, arms crossed, but when she entered the kitchen, her face softened.
"His office is on the other side of the building. He's a Sergeant, but he's not let on many cases. I can show you, if you like." The young man gestured down the hallway.
Clara arrived at the flat with a couple of minutes to spare. She quickly looked at her reflection in the cab window and then went inside.
"Congratulations on 'The Truth About Sherlock Holmes'. The scoop that everybody wanted and you got it," Sherlock started.
She smiled. "He got me out of a tough spot about three years ago. My husband was on trial for murder, and was going to be put in prison for life."
Clara didn't sleep well most of the time. It was her fault, but she didn't have insomnia, or sleep apnea, or anything like that. She was used to having another person sleep next to her, and it was usually a bit not good if she didn't.
John knocked on the door of 221A. It smelled very good in there, like biscuits. A kind-looking older woman in an apron greeted him. "Hello, dear. John, was it?"
When Mycroft turned the monitors back on for 221B Baker Street, he saw Sherlock standing in front of John's door at 5 am. Sherlock was going to try to fix his heart. And Mycroft wasn't going to interfere again. He turned the monitor back off and left the room.
John had lost the memories of the past two years, and he was Sherlock's boyfriend, and Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, Donovan, and Anderson had a similar pattern. Harriet hadn't directly known him, and her memories were perfectly intact. So this had to do with
"You'll find her, I know it," John said firmly. Sherlock knew subconsciously that John really thought so.
John reached a hand out to wrap around Sherlock's tapping fingers. The man looked up like he hadn't seen John coming. "Why are you doing that?" he asked quietly.
Now whenever Mycroft checked on the two of them, living separate lives, John having forgotten Sherlock, and Sherlock remembering everything, he wondered if he shouldn't have just let Sherlock jump. Yes, he loved his brother, in a sort of way that could be analyzed extensively and controlled, and he believed the world needed Sherlock, but his brother was dead now. His mind worked beautifully, but the person behind his mind was gone. Mycroft didn't know if he could ever get it back. Because John had been ripped from Sherlock in such a way, Sherlock's
The first thing she became aware of when she woke was something tickling her temple and cheek, and she smiled. Opening her eyes she could see John nestled into her bed, reaching a hand out from under the duvet to touch her skin. Sherlock was struck by the notion that this could be her future, many mornings starting like this. She pulled John’s hand to her mouth and kissed her fingertips.
“Even after all the - everything? You don’t want to get away from the, you know, history, the heartache?”
Kettle, toaster, cupboard, fridge. Kisses and tea and jammy toast to start the day. Life was good; he hummed tunelessly to himself as he pottered.
," he repeated. "It's already half ten, Sherlock, and this isn't like patching on your ear. I need to open up a bit of your spinal seam to attach it securely, so I want to be well rested before I start."
John felt his legs shake, and sat hard next to him. For Sherlock, he would make that leap into the unknown.
Sherlock (when he unfreezes) is a flurry of motion, wearing the snuggie like a dressing gown as he straddles John’s lap.
“I know,” Sherlock mumbled, turning his face away to bury it in the pillow. “I love you too, of course.
“There is nothing ‘perfect’ about this timing,” replied Sherlock, scowling as he climbed off the mattress. “It’s Mycroft.” His scowl deepened.
“Your tail was twitching.” Sherlock paused. “It’s twitching now. That’s… I’m not hurting you, am I?” He tried to move back, but John’s hands flew to Sherlock’s hips to keep them together.
Fawnlock "borrows" a pretty dress and wrestles it on to show off for Nymphjohn after seeing a human man being very appreciative of it on his lover. Nymphjohn has never really seen the point of clothes, but this
John chuckled and slipped his fingers from Sherlock, tracing the pink rim with a single fingertip. “It’s my pleasure, believe me.”
He wakes some time later to Sherlock gently manipulating his arm to kiss a path from wrist to shoulder. After a press of lips to the centre of his old scar on his shoulder, he leans heavily on John with an air of expectation.
Sherlock’s face is a masterpiece of expression and I realise immediately I have said the wrong thing when he looks hurt and then blank.
"My little dove. Let me just mix this damned formula together, love, and then you can have a nice drink. Maybe I can have a nice drink later."
With a moan Sherlock nods. John licks the sound out of his mouth. He kisses him back, sloppily, unable to focus. A thrust rocking into him throws his head back, and John resumes his decoration of Sherlock’s neck, sucking, biting, licking. His fingers tease the delicate skin around the head of his cock, and it is agony.
“It's difficult to read implications in text messages," he berates John, collecting up Abigael's clothing he and Mary had amassed. "It's not unreasonable to ask for assistance; stop feeling guilty."
The first press of lips is hesitant, almost disbelieving. John is, embarrassingly, still concerned about crying, although now for different reasons altogether. Sherlock places delicate kisses all over John's face, then shifts, insinuating himself in his usual manner to lie half atop John. With the television flickering light over them, John captures Sherlock's mouth with his own, glorying in Sherlock melting against him.
“No pain, right?” A traitorous finger reached out to touch his entrance, which was soft and pink. Sherlock tipped his hips up, just a fraction, and his finger slipped in, just to the first knuckle.
John squirmed and tried to bite back his laughter, but when Sherlock wiggled his fingers into his sides, he giggled and yelled.
John bit her lip and ducked her head, but when she looked up through her lashes at Sherlock she was smiling.
Running a hand over Sherlock’s lithe torso, John managed to stammer out an enquiry as to how he felt.
“He won’t mind us chatting. He’s not your boyfriend, so it’s not really any of his business, is it? I’ll get you a drink.”
"Nope," John ruled, setting down the newly completed tail. Sherlock pouted as prettily as he could, drooping his ears dejectedly.
John stumbled over the threshold into Sherlock’s room, Sherlock’s hand encircling his wrist. He tried to keep his breathing even when he was pulled onto the bed, onto Sherlock.
"That's just biology. Of course you want that then. But truly, in your head - and that's where attraction and arousal starts - you're not interested."
he wants to say, but he’s never been particularly eloquent for a minute either side of orgasm. He can feel John pulsing hot inside him. He drags in air. John releases his sensitive cock, holds his hip. Smoothing back his curls, he giggles.
John brushes water off Sherlock’s brow, for what it’s worth. Sherlock’s eyes smile up at him. Sherlock’s hands urge his hips to thrust forward with a little more force.
“Baker Street is the best home I’ve ever had, and there’s plenty of people I care about here. Best of luck with the interview, Molls, but we’ll both miss you if you get it.”
When Sherlock beams up at him, John’s breath hitches in his chest. Flushing red, he clambers over Sherlock into position.
a virgin, or that she could lie when John had a hand on her bare thigh. Her thumb swiped over the skin, reassuring.
“Probably not my strongest skill, but I’m going to kiss you here now, okay?” He cupped and stroked Sherlock’s cock.
"I had it pretty well down in university, but on these meds... I don't know. I usually get about four or five day's notice, with the cramps and things. I should have four heats a year, give or take a week."
Sherlock nodded, his hair wild, and curled into himself somewhat, curving his back invitingly for John to mold himself to. He pressed innumerable kisses into his skin as he worked his hips and started really fucking into him.
Her back arched, and jerkily she got herself propped up on her elbows. Sherlock reveled in the wetness against her face; it was smeared everywhere. John stiffened, falling still apart from her chest hitching as she gulped in air and her sex contracting around Sherlock’s fingers. When she collapsed back against the mattress, Sherlock gentled her movements, continuing to kiss her, but no longer so mercilessly. John’s gasps curled into breathless chuckles, and she caressed Sherlock’s arm. Sherlock meandered up John’s body as she combed her hair away from Sherlock’s face.
“Mmh.” With the duvet bunched under his chin, John wiggled his shoulder, settling into the mattress and stretching a hand onto Sherlock's side. “G’night. Love you.” He sighed happily as he gave himself over to sleep.
“Which is precisely the conversation I had to enjoy with Sherlock while you ate breakfast. Now. This is not something you’re doing lightly?”
The boyfriend, it turned out once they got inside and snogged against the front door a little, was innocent, but his flatmate was not. He proved slightly elusive, but ended up face-down in Debenhams’ Christmas display, one arm pinned behind his back by John. She glowed with satisfaction, and Sherlock had to compose herself before alerting Lestrade to their whereabouts.
Mrs Hudson has the kettle on and Abigael cradled in one arm, and he can't begrudge her the time for a cuppa.
“Go on,” John encouraged. “I’ve got you. Fuck my hand, Sherlock, come on, you can come for me, can’t you?”
One evening while Sherlock is riding John, he pauses to ask, "Do you love me?" He's pretty sure he knows the answer, but John's never
"That is more difficult to discern," Sherlock concedes. "You should ask yourself, though, do you want to be a beta, or do you want a relationship with one?"
“You've got a headache and the hint of a sniffle,” John snipes, and wonders if he’s wearing anything under that damn
how soft and gentle he could be, if only they were the type of people who took each other's clothes off with reverent fingers and deep kisses.
John sighs heavily, but his toes when they stroke and rest against the side of Sherlock’s foot are light.
“So. Are you going to… go, or join me, or…?” and that seems to completely stupefy him. So John waits a little, and when he gets no answer, he says “Well, if it’s all the same to you, I might. You know. Continue.”
Soon after John set down a toasted sandwich by Sherlock, he heard him breathe deeply and turned in time to see him open his eyes.
,” he insists. “Moriarty is a… a title, a job, a position that can be passed on from master to student.”
John sighed, long and slow. “Don’t worry, a trip to Ann Summers and I’ll be right. I’m not leaving you, Sherlock. You’re stuck with me.”
“I know. Come on, a cup of tea and some toast and jam, and I’ll kiss you until your mind palace falls down.”
, Mr Glare. And you hid this from me all that time, why? That’s what’s weird. I only want to help; I wouldn’t judge-”
John grinned, propping himself up enough to kiss his mouth, pushing fabric to bare his hip, pressing against his skin.
“I.” Sherlock flutters his hands between them. “I couldn’t trust myself. My own desires may have been clouding my observations.”
Nipping at his lip, he asked, “this alright?”, and used the opportunity when Sherlock breathed a “yes” in reply to deepen the kiss. He slipped an arm around Sherlock’s waist, rested his hand at the beginning of the delightful swell of arse. Sherlock had one hand fisted in John’s jumper but brought the other behind his shoulder, pulling John closer as he inexpertly kissed back.
meet someone while you’re off being dead swanning around God-knows-where chasing henchmen, you strut back in with your - your eyelashes and your collarbones and now he says he
“Soon,” he assured Sherlock. “I’ll kiss you here ‘til you are so ready for me, Sherlock, ready and begging -”
“He said something that upset you enough to finally break it off with him. Judging by how you’re speaking to me, it had something to do with me. Are further details really necessary?”
"Hang on, there's no hurry," John soothed, and although Sherlock valiantly tried to answer, he only managed a throaty noise.
It took an age for even the head of his cock to press inside, and John curled over to press a kiss to Sherlock’s spine. “How are you going, there,” he asked, whispering without meaning to.
“Like I said. You were busy being infatuated. Once you made that quite clear, I didn't want to… impose.”
"I've had explosives and a microphone strapped to me, Sherlock," he starts mildly. "My w-" he swallows hard. "My wife used conversations I had with her like bargaining chips with the same man. I do
“Can I kiss you?” He starts nodding again before I can finish speaking. My fingers trace over his face, and he leans into my touch. Holding the back of his neck, I stretch up and press my lips to his.
"Mm. So she was back to teaching. I couldn't not chase after her, and for some reason she let me. And Mike, bless him, he knew what was up. He was already four when I met him, and before he was six he asked to speak with me, very proper, and wanted to know when I would stop wasting time and marry his Mummy."
“Yeah, I know, muppet.” John glances back from the stove to where Sherlock is trying to feed Abigael a variety of soft food. “He’s just like that. You learn to go with it.”
"No, to... us." Gripping his hand firmly, John closes his eyes, swallows hard and forces himself to say it. "Sherlock, I think we're practically married."
“Well. Last time, you had it cut just so around your jaw? I wanted to pin you up against the wall and kiss you there until your knees gave out.” She pressed a finger gently against Sherlock’s lips, pulled the lower down a little. “Want to kiss you now, actually.”
“Mm.” Sipping the coffee, Sherlock regards John. “The timing of the waves of a heat is rather fascinating. I’d like to study it further.”
Harry suggested they call in takeaway for dinner. John, who was already starting to investigate what she had in that he could cook with, turned to her, his expression slipping towards real annoyance.
Still warm from their chase, they decided to walk the mile or so back to Baker Street. John bought a kebab for dinner that Sherlock stole large bites of, and when she got sauce on her mouth John kissed it away. When they finally finished eating and their hands were free, Sherlock pulled John against her and tried to get her fingers on John’s skin.
Trying to focus on pleasuring Sherlock only slightly lessens the intensity of feeling of what Sherlock is doing to him. It’s been months, now, and still every time John is terrified of being overwhelmed.
He does. It’s not a - it’s not a show, really; John leaves the duvet up, and he tries to look at Sherlock - without staring relentlessly at him - and when he comes, quietly but obviously, he stares at the ceiling a bit before looking back at his flatmate. Sherlock has his hand across his face, biting his thumb.
John waited, but he did not finish his sentence. “I don’t know what you mean,” he said gently. “Can you tell me?”
He hovers, offering tea, calmly assuring the tea is not drugged, putting the telly on, changing the channel to something John prefers, calling to order dinner.
He smiles fondly at them, smoothing a hand over Sherlock’s temple then Abigael’s. Then he drags himself back upstairs.
He lies on his makeshift bed, letting himself be deceived by the immediate comfort, and mumbles a ‘g’night’ to Sherlock. Sherlock neither replies nor moves.
Sherlock produces a box of mints, shaking one out into his hand and throwing it into his mouth. He shakes out another, this time pushing it against John’s lips.
he had changed what he was saying to be contrary, but if Sherlock honestly thought John hadn’t considered both fucking and being fucked
"Until I was about eight, yes. I'm named after Dad, but Mum wanted to call me something that sounded different enough that we wouldn't get mixed up."
“Idiot,” John berated, smiling. “I like you too. I mean, what do you like in bed. How do I make you come?”
Shaking his head as best he could with half of his face planted in the mattress, Sherlock bowed and arched his back, an unending motion both sinuous and tense. Little noises escaped him, and John watched fondly as he bit into a pillow to muffle them.
. They get to the house he and Mary had rented. Kate peers out her front window, urges Isaac to join her in assisting John bring everything in. It’s remarkable how much
“You’re not actually attracted to Alphas, though,” Sherlock announces conversationally into the silence of their living room. John snorts.
“No, I – John.” John does not seem too invested in hearing an answer, as he is already undoing Sherlock’s flies. He wants to tell him, though.
Recognising she should be more involved, she pressed forward, and John smiled against her and pulled away.
Sherlock had to reply; John would expect him to say something. His mind was seared blank but for the feeling of lips against his skin and the sound of those precious words from last night.
"Oh." His hands were a little dry, catching on cloth when he dropped one to caress him. The fingers on his other hand danced and slid through fur, hopefully creating pleasurable sensations. "Can - May I - Are you - ?"
“Mm. Me too.” His finger slid part-way in. When Sherlock involuntarily clenched his muscles then very deliberately relaxed again, John pushed further in and pulled back in increments. ”Good?”
Eventually, though, Sherlock eased his fingers from John and binned the glove. John took a moment to think about standing upright.
He brought in the tail, his Mending kit, and a laptop - there was no denoting 'John's' or 'Sherlock's' any more for any of their possessions, be it clean socks or laptops or bank cards. He thought for a moment and dragged over a chair.
“Would you like me to do this for you,” John asked, chest heaving. “We could do it with mouths, or hands, or, or even just rubbing on each oth-”
“So I’ll let my heat happen, hope it comes in soon. Wasn't there something you wanted to talk about this morning, to do with the case? For when we do get on it."
“Yes, I know.” He greets a waitress, and they make their way to a table. “You talk and make friends; you’re good at that. It distracts people from my investigating.”
Sherlock seemed subdued in the morning when John stumbled down the stairs for a shower. He was still wearing John's jumper over his pyjamas, and fondled his violin affectionately.
“She’s horrifically inconsistent,” Sherlock complains one evening between cases. They’ve been taking plenty, and John is happy with Sherlock’s decision to solve more of the boring ones. He agrees they’re not as riveting as murder mysteries, but they pay well enough that he hasn’t had to go back to the surgery.
True to his word, John kisses Sherlock at length, pressing him into the mattress. Sherlock murmurs into his mouth.
“You’re doing so well, just let go. Come on, beautiful.” Sherlock’s gaze was still holding him in place, and John reached out with his free hand to push and hold riotous sweaty curls out of the way. At the sustained contact Sherlock’s back arched and his mouth opened wider, and John could only stare back at him as he came silently. He was distantly aware of Peter releasing Sherlock’s spent cock and slowing his motions.
John was unable to make good on her promise, as Greg texted while they ate breakfast. She read the message, frowned, and spun the phone across the table to Sherlock.
“Well.” John tried to take a deep breath, but his chest was tight. “Christ, Sherlock. Yes, it is. I mean. I-” he swallowed and fell silent. Sherlock’s fingers gripped his chin and tipped his head to look him in the eye.
Lestrade called as it was getting dark - there hadn’t been a murder, precisely, but he sounded defeated as he told John Sherlock would probably enjoy it. John hummed in agreement and threw Sherlock’s coat at him.
“So, what’s the plan for tomorrow, then? Do I get to know it, or will it be a surprise to me as well as the Liverpudlian police and criminals?”
“You’re a bloody idiot, Sherlock Holmes. Nothing could stop me wanting y-” Sherlock cut him off, pressing a firm closed-mouth kiss to his lips.
as Sherlock manipulated his head to ghost kisses over both his eyelids. They shifted to something more side-by-side, though legs and arms kept pulling their bodies closer.
– I thought his network too extensive, even for him. We did a little research and there was no-one by that name at the same school as Carl Powers, or even of the same generation in his area. His successor seems to have been picking up some of the pieces. The new Moriarty is about to introduce themselves. That’s what the video was telling us – and telling anyone in the market for a consulting criminal, I suppose.”
“Poet,” Sherlock murmured in accusation. John’s fingers circled her chin and traced down her throat. They skated over her breasts to her stomach, but at Sherlock’s bitten-off whine John grinned widely, returning to tease her nipples. When Sherlock could no longer keep her breathing even, John kissed her shoulder and continued mapping Sherlock’s body with her fingertips. She tugged the duvet back in increments and Sherlock watched John notice a wave of gooseflesh ripple across Sherlock’s skin.
John softens his mouth and lets Sherlock’s finger press inside. He sucks hard against Sherlock’s flesh and writhes his tongue against it. Feeling him twitch and growl deep within his chest is extremely satisfying. Eventually Sherlock pulls his hand back, his eyes bright.
Sherlock garbled a reply as he shifted, and John kissed him again. They lost time there, steadily getting less steady and more desperate. When Sherlock pulled away to speak, John cradled his face in his hands, shifting to comb fingers through his hair.
He storms up to bed soon after. He thinks about - apologising? Or at least discussing what they had been talking about - the next day, but couldn't work up the nerve. It’s easy to put it off when Sherlock is in full research mode. The day after that, he wakes up rutting into the mattress with slickness between his cheeks.
He traced a finger over the hole and then obliged, burying his face against Sherlock’s arse and writhing his tongue in. Sherlock keened. John kissed and licked into him long after the tight muscle began to stretch and relax, until he was concerned for his jaw cramping.
“Please, John,” he begged, and John pushed himself up with one arm to take in the vision under him. His free hand cupped Sherlock's flushed cheek, and Sherlock clasped that hand in his own, holding it there.
“I was gonna use that tomorrow,” she pointed out as he pulled things from the fridge and turned to the pantry.
He leaned in, tugging at Sherlock’s sleeves until he stooped to a more reasonable height. As soon as his lips brushed against Sherlock’s infuriating mouth, John knew what a terrible mistake he had made. This would ruin him, but in truth John could admit he had been spoiled for anyone else long ago. He could make the most of it. Sherlock wanted to know, and by God, John would show him.
It’s not until after he’s made himself come twice, laying gasping in the almost-satisfied reprieve between orgasm and repeated need, that he realises Sherlock might have been trying to offer to… John’s not sure. Sit in and observe his heat, if nothing else. Does he know John would be physically incapable of refraining from begging Sherlock to fuck him?
John was not unfamiliar at leaning up into a taller person’s space to take their mouth with his own. He pulled Sherlock along with him as he stepped back towards the bed, hands clutching his pyjama shirt like he wouldn’t follow John and his kisses anywhere.
“Sorry. Sorry, Sherlock. I thought - I must have been imagining. I thought you said -” John turned away to select clothes for the day, clutching them to his chest. He was still wearing only the boxers he slept in, and clearly felt too vulnerable.
“I mean,” he amended, clearing his throat, “I love you.” Then he pursed his lips and stood at attention, waiting for Sherlock to respond.
, if Sherlock knew John loved him and loved him back. This was all he was allowed, and as it was he felt guilty, like he was taking more than he was giving - like he was taking more than
"Yes, well, I've had all the surgery I plan on having, but -" he shook his head and began fumbling with the button, but John took his hand and pressed a kiss to the knuckles.
“Go back to bed,” ordered, his face stern. “You weren’t supposed to wake up for another ten minutes; I was going to bring this up.”
He had looked away as he forced the words out, but when he looked back to his friend Sherlock had his fingertips against his lower lip.
He can't think of anything else, but at the same time he seems unable to comprehend what he saw this afternoon, and
Standing amidst the blank bleached walls that reeked off misery and gut-wrenching anticipation, he really, really hoped it was all just a nightmare. Countless times, he’d been here, such that he practically know the place like the back of his hand. He knew the morgue the best, like an old friend. It would be ‘Christmas’ every time he’d walk through those doors on a case. Sherlock never felt anything navigating through the hallways and thought little of the grief-stricken faces he’d see. But this time it was very different.
He withdrew his hands and marched swiftly out of the double doors of the pub before he let a tear escape. He thought he heard something.
No, he was no Sherlock. The man’s name made his heart stir in ways he couldn’t understand, yet his heart understood perfectly. He tried to move on and found himself not able to, despite feigning it. The more he tried to move farther away, the closer he got.
“Well, I should be going then.” Sherlock stood up. His lower lip gave a quiver of its own. He gazed down at the shorter man and saw tears dropping to his trousers as he clenched his face in his hands. He reached out to touch John’s shoulders, but stopped. His eyes suddenly left glassy and blood rushed to his face.
“I missed her terribly in the years when she wasn't working, so I found all her papers and studied them. Wrote her asking to explain them to me, like a lovesick fool. But I realised what I was doing, and eventually we stopped."
“If you’ve just said anything, Mycroft, I will let you know now I haven’t heard a word of it. John’s trying to propose to me so this had
Pressing his face to Sherlock’s skin, John snapped his hips a few more times, letting his orgasm burst through him like a wave of lightning. He kissed and kissed again everywhere his lips could reach, loving clear and marred skin alike. When he could breathe again, he shifted to carefully pull out of Sherlock, and excused himself to the bathroom for a moment.
“All good?” His friend looked at him and smiled, looking dazed. Small panting sounds escaped his mouth rhythmically.
“You’re b-” his nose nudged Sherlock’s ear and it twitched, making John jump back, startled and flustered.
After that, he has no words, because Sherlock tips up his hips for a better angle and John can't help but push a little faster, a little harder. They crush their mouths together as he comes, pulsing into Sherlock's body.
"Come now, John, I thought we weren't going to do this again this year. I don't do Christmas gifts."
“It’s beautiful,” John whispered. Sherlock’s response was a breathy noise. He shifted a fraction more towards Sherlock.
“Oi! Where are you going? You sod, you’re meant to stay and answer questions,” Lestrade yells after him.
Spreading her knees, Sherlock canted her hips up. With a giggle, John put her mouth on her again, nipping and sucking her inner folds between firm wriggles of her tongue against her clit. When she replaced her mouth with her hand, she turned her head to place a sweet kiss to Sherlock’s thigh.
"I do still listen," John replied, trying to focus on Sherlock’s clear enjoyment of the volume instead of his claim that John's relationship with Mary was best described as 'infatuation'.
There had been a drawn-out moment as he slid deeper into him, when Sherlock moaned like it was being squeezed out of him and John couldn't breathe at all. When he felt the cheeks of Sherlock’s arse against his hips, he let out a ragged sigh, and it felt like Sherlock
“I love you,” he repeated as he lifted his hand, placed it on the jut of Sherlock’s hip. “This alright?”
John has watched him open himself up before – they have tried many things in the last few months. He strips as quickly as he can and lies in the middle of his bed. John sits on the edge of the mattress, absently playing with his cock as it hardens.
“Obviously. You never date them. I suspect you never have, except when you were closing in on a heat.”
"Well, what choice do I have, John? It can wait or I can abandon it to the incompetence of the Yard."
“I love you?” John’s throat went tight, forcing his voice up into a question. The tongs in Sherlock’s hand clattered to the floor.
Sherlock turned back to the girls. “Thanks for the information,” he nodded briefly before striding out the door, Lestrade and John following closely. They struggled to keep up as Sherlock glided ahead like a hawk.
He heard a small noise of assent from Sherlock, who then rolled over to allow John to stroke his lower back and arse, just like he promised, just the way John liked.
“No. Do you? Want me to leave?” He stares him down, ready to go upstairs and begin packing if Sherlock prevaricates again.
"Alright.” He thinks about asking if Sherlock would like to help him out with his next heat, Alpha knot or no. He is probably curious - surely he knows Hollywood sanitised what a heat involved.
, John. I want - I - I’ve very little partnered experience. I want, but I don’t know. What do you want?”
Understanding what he has said happens gradually. The air between us is still but for our breathing. My hands tingle as they grip the chair, and I can feel my heart beat.
“John.” His voice was already husky and broken. John rose up enough to lick another kiss into Sherlock’s eager lips, ignoring the creaking in his joints. Then he crouched down and took the head into his mouth, his tongue soft against the glans still half-hidden in foreskin. When he sank down further and sucked, Sherlock made a strangled noise. With a little practice he remembered how to undulate his tongue on the underside, enjoying the subtle feeling of power from hearing - feeling - Sherlock’s reactions. He pulled away as Sherlock’s breathing became more ragged and pressed a kiss onto his belly then pulled him down to take his mouth once more.
"To each other?" Sherlock turns his hand over, like an invitation, and John traces his fingertips around his palm. He does not look at Sherlock, not yet.
John pottered around the kitchen, picking up dishes and various bits of rubbish. He was only going to be gone for three days, but if the kitchen was clean when he left, surely it wouldn't be
When he woke, there was residual warmth on the mattress beside him, but no body. John groaned and rubbed his eyes. He wondered if morning-after etiquette even occurred to Sherlock.
When he knew that, John thought he could pick up the inconsistencies in Sherlock’s voice that indicated he could not hear himself properly. He faced Sherlock to make sure he could read his lips clearly, pushing his own ears to hang behind his shoulders.
“Something like that. Get some sleep.” Nodding, John turns up the stairs to his room, but stops to look at his friend.
“I wonder what he'll think of me... I guess he'll call me 'the old man'. I guess he'll think I can lick every other fella's father - well I can! I bet that he'll turn out to be the spittin' image of his dad, but he'll have more common sense than his puddin' headed father ever had… My boy Bill; I will see that he's named after me, I will. My boy Bill, he'll be tall and as tough as a tree, will Bill!”
would be straight-up taking him to bed and shagging him silly. I promise I’ll come to your wedding when you marry the right bloody person.”
“Whatever works,” Sherlock replies, and takes a deep breath, bearing down a little to allow John to breach him.
The kitchen stays relatively tidy and always clean, Abigael often wants far more formula than specified in guides, and John feels he has successfully navigated the talking-about-Mary waters with his larger social sphere.
handcuffs, that you stole from Greg?” John produces them. “Course I do.” He’s enjoying this, Sherlock knows. That will make him angrier about what Sherlock is about to do, and Sherlock truly does hate making John angry, but he’s nearing forty, himself. Time to grow up; time to think ahead and plan for the future. He’s not a pouting child any more, nor is he a junkie student.
“Lunch, for you,” he croaked, his voice rough with emotion and disuse. Sherlock did not respond, but ten minutes later the plate was empty. The silence was crisp in the air as John collected it and an assortment of mugs from around the room. Although they didn't always make small talk, John could usually find something to say. Somehow
The following day, as most days after a successful case, was a blissful reprieve from mania. Sherlock continued his (fourth or fifth) perusal of his beekeeping book, and John caught up on emails and bills. After dinner, John bullied Sherlock into letting him change the dressing on his back, with less difficulty than the day before. Sherlock began unbuttoning his shirt as he sat in the lounge room, and John tore his gaze away long enough to collect the first aid kit. This time after he smoothed cream over the fresh wound, he traced a finger lightly over a particularly silvered line.
Expecting Sherlock to investigate the wound through his shoulder, John jerked in a little surprise at the lips pressed to his sternum.
“Be sure to keep her warm, Dr Watson,” the nurse cautions, tucking yet another blanket around Abigael in her carrier.
The words come easier than he had expected, and clearly Sherlock had read his signing, as he doesn't react to this announcement at all, pulling up a chair to sit beside John and lean into him. "Everything alright, dear?" he rumbles.
Greg opened and shut his mouth only a few times when they arrived at the scene, John’s fingers tangled decisively around Sherlock’s.
John slept, snoring quietly as she sprawled on Sherlock’s mattress, but Sherlock spent most of the night watching her, awed. She let herself drift, torn between curling into John’s side, soft in relaxed repose, and cataloguing her breathing rate and REM.
"No," Sherlock says, moving to sit at the edge of the bed. He squints in the half-light struggling into the room. "You masturbated in here this evening. You normally confine that to morning showers, except when you've got a girlfriend who's... frustrating you."
“Okay.” She inched a hand out, touched John’s shoulder. Then John leaned in closer, touched Sherlock’s mouth with her own. When their lips slid against each other, Sherlock wondered if she shouldn’t be as fascinated as she was with the sensation.
He smeared his lips against Sherlock’s throat as he thumbed the band of his pants. Receiving a tight nod, he shifted back enough to throw off his own robe and pants, and remove Sherlock’s underwear. A lone freckle on his hip begged to be kissed. John obliged.
“God, Sherlock, I thought I didn’t have a chance with you, so yeah, I was making do. But it’s you, really. You’re it, for me. No-one else comes close.”
"Different prescription, though, and regs said we could only suppress every other heat. A week's leave every six months didn't go astray. You could choose an alpha to apply to accompany you, as well. So, I don't know."
Through the kitchen - which was, in fact, awful after just two days - he continued. “I should have told you before she shot you. I should’ve told you before I got married, really, or even before you left. Sherlock,” he said, louder now, opening his bedroom door, “you need to know that I -”
“You can’t deduce it?” She flexed her fingers and grabbed for their bottle of whisky. Sherlock watched her, guessing at the amount of alcohol left in the bottle, and chose not to comment on it.
With a dressing gown wrapped around him that doesn’t do a damn thing to hide his erection, he stomps down the stairs. In the kitchen, Sherlock sat with a bare piece of toast and a mug of coffee in front of him, while John’s side of the table boasts a glass of orange juice, muesli, a muffin, sausage, beans, eggs, bacon, a croissant with tomato and cheese, and a banana, in addition to his own toast and tea. John blinks.
"Oh. Just that, um, that I'm home. So you don't, I don't know, burn the house down with me in it or wander the kitchen nude in the morning."
“Sure. Yeah. Come on, your room again?” Sherlock followed quietly, and when John reached the bed and turned to face him, he had already undone half the buttons on his shirt.
, you know the one, and he said 'Yes, William is a good name for the baby, but he needs a Mycroft name too.' So of course he finds this book of awful old names and chooses one for me."
“No, no, it’s fine, don’t want to kick Himself out of his own room. Honestly, Dad, I can do that. I’ll let you two get some rest and we’ll be out of your hair in the morning, promise.” They say their goodnights and Marie kisses his cheek on her way out. John’s hardly finished tucking a sheet around the seat cushions and arranging and plumping blankets and pillows when his friend reappears, loitering in the doorway.
“Oh my God,” Sherlock slurred in reply. He shuffled his knees to lift his hips higher, and shoved a hand under himself to stroke his cock, now well and truly hard again. John tutted at him, pulling his arm away.
when he got back. “Sherlock? I was supposed to leave at two and it’s a quarter past already. I need you to tell me
Peter turned to look at him, and the combination of disbelief and omniscience was alarmingly Mycroft-ish.
It takes a while, but after a few more well-placed insinuations, and a new habit of leaving his door ajar, John has Sherlock appearing in his doorway while he lays in bed, teasing his foreskin down and back. He doesn’t cross the threshold, and John takes one more stroke before stopping his motion, hidden as it is under the duvet.
Mrs Hudson is all too happy to help, of course. When the car is empty, Sherlock slips into the driver's seat.
He glares at me, and I wonder if I was not meant to acknowledge anything that happened while he was high.
“Mycroft should never have told you that. Anyway, it’s irrelevant. Clearly you are unaware that the stitchspell for my hearing is
Sherlock huffs as he stands from where he knelt on the killer, and there’s a brief struggle as they try to evade the grasp of the assisting police officers. He strides out to the curb and hails a taxi.
When Sherlock nods, John climbs out of bed, leaning back down to press another kiss to his upturned face.
“Thanks,” was all he said, and Sherlock mumbled a “thank you, John,” as well. With no idea how to respond, John stammered something about cloths to clean up, and fled. In the bathroom he grabbed a handful of tissues, shoved his jeans down and came almost immediately. A deep breath steadied him. He ran hot water over some flannels and squeezed them out, and marched back to the bedroom.
“Gorgeous,” he said firmly. “Maybe you should sit down?” Sherlock nodded silently and perched on the edge of his bed, flushing red as John encouraged him to spread his legs. Delicate kisses trailed in from Sherlock’s thighs.
“Alright,” he declared eventually. “That’s on. Don’t get up yet, I haven’t closed the gap in your spine. Can you - can you feel it?” Holding the tail near the end, he tickled the fur at the very tip. Sherlock jolted.
“Well,” John hemmed, uncomfortable. “You could tell me what you think? I mean, if it’s unwelcome, you needn’t worry, it’s as good as forgotten.”
Sherlock’s hips squirmed, his face reddened, and he nodded. Pulling up the skin around his cock revealed more of it, and John beamed up at Sherlock.
“You-” he had to pause. “Your back was raw with these when you climbed into that bloody bonfire to pull me out.”
Days passed in a flurry of kisses and cases. After they staggered home sometime around 3am after chasing down a poisoner, they fumbled their way through agreeing to share Sherlock’s bed. John was hoping for some company in bed in the morning, although he wasn’t actually surprised to wake up alone.
"Dinner?" he asks, to break the tension. "Mycroft took a call a minute ago, but he said to start without him."
Their fingers entwine as they enter, although he isn’t sure whose hand reaches out first. The man who created the need for this ruse glances their way, and John looks away.
“I know,” came the reply, although it sounded quite muffled. Rolling his eyes, John paced towards Sherlock’s bedroom.
It was clear that particular admission surprised John almost as much as it did Sherlock, and he knew John would back away from this direction of conversation if he could.
It’s like a breaking dam, John finds. The long-awaited leak leads to the collapse of the whole structure, and he feels drunk on the truths he presses into Sherlock’s skin. He’s soft, and gentle, but Sherlock is a violin string under his hands, taut and singing with each stroke. John would happily drown himself in this moment.
“You never said that,” John teases. “I’m on my stomach, aren’t I?” He rolls his hips, presses his groin against Sherlock’s.
Sherlock hovered over John until John pulled her down, forehead to forehead. They breathed each other’s air, smiles stealing across their faces.
“You’ll tell me if it’s not good, okay,” he said, then gently covered the head of it with his mouth, keeping his tongue soft as he rolled it against him.
“Don’t go away, don’t go anywhere,” Sherlock repeated as he lowered himself, not at all gracefully, to lie on the mattress.
In the car on the way home, his phone rings with a call from Mycroft. Sherlock sighs loudly but does not deny him answering.
“Moriarty is dead, no question. But more importantly,” he pauses and looks off, clearly planning. “I know
He didn’t want to ask if Sherlock had condoms - just in case they got that far - so he coaxed him up the stairs to his own bedroom. Falling back onto his mattress, he pulled Sherlock on top of him and kissed him languidly.
Sherlock likes to nuzzle and lick and suck John when he's soft. He tries to avoid talking specifically about it with John, but eventually, sometimes, making John come is only the first step, enjoyable as it is, to settling in between his legs and taking him in his mouth and just - relaxing.
“Go home, you big idiot.” She said it softly, and touched his arm as she did. “Thanks for trying so hard to do the whole ‘Christmas with the family’ thing.”
Col. Potter. John was short, even in primary, and Sherman? Short bloke, hell of a temper kept tightly reined, heart of gold, Army doctor,
They are grinning at each other, and John cannot let on what that does to his chest. He collects his jacket.
He shifted to lie in the centre of the bed, head propped up on pillows, and almost before he was settled John was climbing over him.
His body is hot and tight around John, his face utterly guileless. He tries to roll his hips, to stroke himself, but John holds him still and pets his side until he calms.
“Hold up, what’s the rush?” He put his hands on Sherlock’s arms as he asked, and Sherlock fell still. “Are you ready?”
Dragging his thumb down over it drew a full-body shudder from Sherlock, so John reversed direction and traced the centre seam back up from right behind his balls to the base of his tail, then tickling around the seam of the new appendage. Sherlock keened.
He begins by kissing little kitten-licks over the backs of John’s thighs. John breathes deeply,  relaxing his legs. Flexing his hands, he clenches them in the sheets when Sherlock nuzzles in to press his tongue against his hole.
“On your stomach, please,” he says, patting the mattress, but John pushes him back and spreads himself over his body, coaxing his mouth into a filthy kiss.
“What, ‘I love you’?” He shifts Sherlock so he can settle over him, and pushes in as he nods. Long limbs close around him.
“Very good.” John petted his thighs and kissed him again, testing the rim with his tongue. He didn’t let himself smile at Sherlock’s words. Sherlock pushed back against him, even though the muscle did not give.
“It’s more than that, though, isn’t it?” Sherlock said. “It’s the… sentiment. It’s how the best parts weren’t even when you-” he went beet red and mumbled for a while before taking a shuddering breath and continuing. “It meant more to me than the excuses we made. I think… I hope it was the same for you.”
“Would you mind if I joined you?” While he has given no indication that he is awake, he’s not surprised that Sherlock knows he is.
Sherlock asks him about it later, even revealing he has something of a collection of jobs he think would suit John, if he desired.
In the morning light, Sherlock is soft and delicate as they work around each other to make tea and toast. He sets the spreads on the table and catches John’s eye, blushing even as he smiles. John loves all of it.
“What does it matter to you, anyway, what I think about them,” he mused. Sherlock stiffened under his hands as he pressed on a bandage.
John was looking at her with her brow crinkled up, and eventually circled her fingers around Sherlock’s wrist, bringing her hand the last few inches to rest against her cheek, vibrating with disbelief.
He spends the day catching up on housework, making food and editing his next blog posts. Fretting also takes a significant portion of time. Before he goes up to bed, he sends a
“Can I…” John trailed off, rubbing fingers meaningfully over her entrance. Chest heaving, Sherlock nodded. She could feel herself blush harder as John smeared her slickness around, before easing a single finger into her. Then she (gently, devastatingly) took Sherlock apart.
"Are my suppressants not working properly, or what," John scowls as he potters around getting breakfast. "I don't usually get ID'ed as Omega by strangers."
With a few nudges, he got Sherlock to spread his legs a little further, allowing John to position himself between them. He knew what he wanted to do. Folding himself over, his ears tickled Sherlock’s cloth before he pushed his face into that cleft, licking around and into Sherlock’s arse. Thankfully it seemed as sensitive to Sherlock as John hoped, given his reactions. He scrabbled at the sheets to find something to grip, before clutching his pillow with one hand and hooking a couple fingers of his other around John’s fingers as they held him tight. It seemed like he was speaking, except he only managed half the phonemes. There was a few words he managed, though, and he repeated them over and over.
Peter exhaled loudly and fucked into Sherlock in fast and increasingly uneven thrusts, chasing his own climax. It didn’t take long, and after a long moment buried deep inside, he gingerly pulled out, both of them becoming oversensitive. He slumped onto the bed mostly beside and only a little on top of Sherlock, but reached over to touch John on the shoulder.
“Yeah,” John repeats. But he levers himself up to perch on the worktop, and this time he does manage to kiss Sherlock properly.
“I'll do it properly next time, love.” John planned on making every fantasy he'd had about them come true. Starting with: “I'll look after you right and kiss you a million times.”
