“You have nothing to worry about, Mr. Novak,” Kevin said while looking into his eyes. “The favors are in your side of the court.”
Dean, holding back a full body shudder from Mr. Novak’s intensity, didn’t break the eye contact. He really did have the most intense blue eyes. There, in the depths of them, Dean could see the heat. The lust. The fire…
“Thanks,” Dean said as he turned his attention back to his phone. Few minutes later he got a new message from Lisa asking how he was doing and how he liked Spain after one day. Dean replied with a positive message. After speaking to each other, for several minutes, he got an image of Natalie with a kissy face and a sign in her hands that said,
Their movements didn’t gain more rhythm to them, even when they got close to coming. Mr. Novak’s hips were moving in and out of him, in slow moves. His hands were touching every available surface of Dean’s body. Grunting, and moaning, his hands squeezing and caressing his body… and Dean was feeling close. So close. And the way that Mr. Novak’s moves were starting to get a bit shorter and a bit faster, Dean knew he was close too.
the kid. Nor did he know if it was a boy or a girl, or what the name was. He didn’t know what Sam was up to these days, either…
is actually an escort,” one of them said. Dean swallowed around the knot in his throat.
“Thank you, sir,” this seemed to make Dean relax a bit more. The tension seemed to seep away from his shoulders.
“I was a teenager when I got into the scene.”
Castiel hesitated, but he stood up with a nod. Before he left Dean on the couch, he turned and asked, "Are you sure?"
Dean couldn't think of any other word than beautiful to describe this house. The lanterns were huge in the hallways. The walls were white and had big paintings on them. Dean would bet his Baby that they were original works. Mr. Novak led him down the hallway and opened up the double doors to the dining room.
“I want you,” Castiel said and he cornered Dean by the counter, from behind. His skin smelled amazing. A mix of sweat and the morning’s soap that clung to his skin. Castiel nosed at the back of his neck and Dean leaned up on his hands on the counter. Castiel kissed his spine, just as Dean let out a sigh through his nose. Castiel moved his hips around his neck and kissed underneath Dean’s earlobe. Dean tilted his head to the side to give more access to Castiel.
They stared at one another for a moment., but neither of them said anything. Dean was the first one to avert his gaze and turned to walk to the couch. “Why aren’t you taking off your coat?” Dean asked, as he sat down and sipped at his coco. Castiel moved to place the mug on the coffee table, close to the couch, and took off his coat. He folded it and draped it over the head of an armchair, which was closer to the window. He sat down on that armchair, and took the mug from the table. This way, he was sitting close, but not really, to Dean.
’s next from the bag and checked to see if they were full. He breathed it out in relief to notice that.
Gabriel chuckled and shook his head. “Man, I know I can hook you up in no time. But if we are talking about long term-”
No messages.
Dean’s face heated up at the words, but he rolled his eyes, gave her a look and left to help out Sam.
The man’s eyes went wide with fear and he started to struggle to get his hands free, but it was impossible. The sound of the familiar car making its way to the warehouse filled the air and the man started to cry like a little girl. Balthazar gave him one disgusted look, rolled his eyes and went out to meet his boss.
better. He knew Dean wasn’t asleep, not the way he was breathing, or in the way he started to caress Castiel’s arm that was draped over Dean’s torso.
“Will you?” Mr. Novak asked him, his eyes wide open and probably staring right into Dean’s soul, because of how intense that stare was.
Dean threw his head back and lowered his body down the couch, hands not leaving Jessica’s feet. He closed his eyes and conjured up an image of Mr. Novak. He licked his lips as he imagined him; looking down at the papers, the sunlight streaming through the windows in his office, illuminating him in a bright light. He has a white button down shirt in Dean’s mind’s eyes, and his hair was wind swept. He has one hand in his hair, the other one holding up a piece of paper. His blue eyes were thoughtful, and his usually bright blue eyes were in a darker shade. As if he was deep in his thoughts and he wouldn’t want to be disturbed. But then Dean called out his name, and he looked up. It only took him a heartbeat to realize that it was Dean who called out to him, his eyes cleared and the wrinkling at the corners of his eyes were a tale tell sign of him smiling. His full lips stretched open over his white teeth, his cheeks moving up his face, his eyes getting that amused glittering to them, and his hand going through his hair once again.
“Yeah?”
She took the pen from the table and started to place
“Afternoon,” she replied, “Thank you for agreeing to see me.”
“Thank you, Dean,” Anna said with a proud smile on her face. “It's my grandma's recipe.”
make them pay. We
Castiel sighed and pushed away from the bed. He walked to the window on the right side of the room to look outside. His men were spread out and keeping a close eye on the street and the building surrounding the area. "You do know I'm going to revenge this whole incident, right?"
His thoughts were interrupted when Castiel’s phone rang. He ignored it, just as he would whenever it would do at first, and then he’d check who it was from and continue ignore it. But this time the call was pretty insistent. He frowned when the door to the office knocked with loud thumping. Whoever was waiting from the other side didn’t wait for Castiel to call them in.
So he walked to the living room to see Castiel standing at the end of a dinner table, Lora sitting on the right side of the table, some men that Dean didn’t recognize around the table, and at the far end of the table was a man called, if Dean remembered him right, Balthazar. He was deep in his phone, typing away something, but then he looked up and Dean was at a receiving end of a gun. Good thing he didn’t pull the trigger, yet.
Castiel snorted and shook his head. “It doesn’t matter.”
“Hello, Mr. Novak,” she said, her voice shaking slightly. Her eyes were red and puffy. She had been crying. “What can I get you?”
“How long has it been since you last heard from him?” she had asked, while murmuring encouragement to her five-year-old twin girls. It made Castiel smile a little as he heard her speak to them. He had met them this summer when he went to Spain to close a deal with one of the families there. He loved the girls with everything he had, and the girls loved him back equally. They always loved it when uncle Castiel came to visit them. And just now, before they had to eat, they had spoken to him on the phone. They spoke in Spanish more, than they did in English, but it didn’t bother Castiel much since he was fluent in the language.
“Without asking me first.”
Castiel hesitated for a second. He pursed his lips, while he thought about it, but then… he had no other choice but to agree to this, right? “Okay. I’ll stay. But if she asks some stuff that I don’t know how to answer, you’re going to have to help me out.”
The room went silent. Castiel not only could hear the monitors whirring around Dean’s bed, he could also probably hear Dean’s heartbeat, outside of the machine. His was drumming away in his ears. It wasn’t a pleasant thing, since it was way too erratic for his liking.
“I need Balthazar for this,” he said as they left from the front door. Crowley nodded and took out his phone, calling Balthazar as they made their way to the cars out front. “You're with me today.” Castiel raised his finger up and twirled it around in a round motion. His men made their ways to their cars, and Castiel got into his car, with Crowley sitting beside him, in the passenger seat. Usually, Castiel didn't like it when people rode with him, but today, he needed the distraction.
“Oh yes.”
Castiel stared at the far wall of his conference room. His men had quieted down considerably, waiting for him to voice his opinion. He didn’t know what to do. Was he going to attack back and potentially lose more people? Or was he going to have a word with Lucifer since he was the one that gave him this wrong information? And even if he would decide to have that word with Lucifer, how heavy was it going to be?
After sweet talking his way into the kitchen, Dean got out the ingredients he needed from the fridge and the cabinets and set up to work. First he was going to make cheesy garlic bread meatball ring, and cheese sticks, and then for the desert, his famous apple pie that he learned to make from his mother. Anna was hovering over his shoulder as he set into work and Dean tried to ignore her, respectfully, but he couldn’t carry it much longer. In the end, he ended up setting her to work with him.
“I’m fine,” Dean said, moving his hands forward and staggering to stand up. Castiel helped him up, and Dean squeezed his hand. “Really,” he said as he turned to look at Castiel. “I’m fine. This is nothing.”
Dean paused and slowly placed the chips down on the counter. He turned around, with wide eyes, mouth hanging open. Jessica looked at him with a confused expression. “What?” she asked, tilting her head to the side.
“I need to leave. Sam just called. Jess is going to have her baby. I need to go now. Is that okay? I hope it’s okay because I need to be with my brother now,” he spoke loudly, and fast, his eyes widening by every second. He looked so happy that it warmed something deep in Castiel’s chest.
Castiel took another step forward and another, and soon, he was standing in front of Dean. They were in public and he couldn't just lean in and kiss Dean, as much as he wanted to, so he just stared into Dean's eyes.
!” He was dragged back onto Mr. Novak’s lap again. “You’re going to complain about your legs when it’ll be time to leave.”
In this chapter we get to see some other sides of Castiel. This is the only heads up I can give without giving away stuff.
Castiel was sitting on the high end of the dining table, with his glasses perched on his nose, as he looked down at the map on the table. He looked up at her and frowned. He wasn't expecting anything. "Thank you," he said, grabbing the box from her. Lora stayed by his side as he looked at it. It was a black box, with a blue bow on top. The card on it only said, "To Castiel." And nothing else. His men probably checked the box and they deemed it to be safe to let it be placed on the doorstep. Not thinking more of it, he opened the lid and after a split second, he closed his eyes and dropped the lid on top of the box. Lora's sharp intake of breath and the way she moved back from the table indicated that she had seen what was inside.
“You just reminded me of someone. I recently lost him.”
They were almost halfway done with everything when Castiel asked, “Do you wanna talk about it?”
Dean shook his head and smiled at him, before he leaned in again and placed a kiss on his lips. “You never told me what you wanted to do with me tonight.”
They left the bedroom holding hands.
“You're so good to me, Dean,” Mr. Novak growled. Dean felt a small kiss being placed at the base of his spine, but it was so light that Dean could’ve imagined it. Dean opened his eyes just as he felt Novak's hand pushing him up straight. The feeling changed and the plug moved up in his ass. He gave another shudder and Mr. Novak smirked at him.
Balthazar told him to relax tonight and they would come up with a plan tomorrow. They would have to take care of this mess, or they would be marked as weak. Castiel had saw the look in Balthazar’s eyes as he said this and he knew that Balthazar was right. Castiel had neglected his duty as a Don and he had gotten weak in time, and more relaxed… of course, he still had that respect and people were still terrified of him, but because of one person, he had turned into a weak person in his enemy’s eyes. And because of that, people were going to get hurt.
“Good boy.”
“What’s wrong?” Castiel asked. There was that sharp feeling in his chest again and he struggled to breath. “I thought he just didn’t want to come back. We had a fight. And I didn’t want to call him.” He said as truthfully as he could. “What do you mean
(See the end of the chapter for
And I've a writer's block. Hurray!
Castiel could hear how Balthazar talked to her as if she were a spooked up animal, but Castiel paid them no attention. His eyes were drawn to his phone on the ground as he turned around the counter. He bent down and grabbed it with his free hand. He cleaned some of the soot from the screen and he unlocked it. He saw that he had 1 message. The message he got before all of this happened.
“Don’t-Don’t touch me.”
Castiel swallowed around the lump in his throat. He grabbed the bottle of whiskey from the neck and simply took a gulp from it. The alcohol burnt down his throat and he gasped out a bit from it. He didn’t want to get drunk tonight, well, morning already, since he had to have a meeting in a couple of hours. He didn’t know what he was going to do. Everything was a mess in his head.
Castiel mouthed at Lora, who could only nod, her eyes still wide. Castiel managed to quickly attach the bullets to the gun before he stood up and aimed it at the intruder. The intruder wasn’t one of Castiel’s so he was quick to shot the guy in the chest and then head. The man went down with a grunt, the squeak that Lora let out, from being this close to Castiel, was drowned as another man barreled through the same opening, and tried to shoot Castiel, but he was quick again.
“Your Impala’s been a project for you since you were a teenager, yes?” Dean turned his eyes to look at Mr. Novak, and some more tension bled out of him. He was a silent supporter for Dean right now, and he appreciated it immensely.
Dean groaned and covered his face with his free hand. “Sir, I’d love to get into this at any given time, but I had an extremely trying day. And I needed to talk to you about something that happened today.”
Dean didn't reply to him. His head was whirling with the ideas, on how to do it, and only one stood up. One that he had buried deep, deep inside his mind and in the past. But it was something that he could do. And he could do it well enough to be able to demand that much from his...boss. Dean wasn’t mentally present for the final verdict, he didn’t hear what they said about him. He had taken out his phone and texted the right person for this job.
That was the reason why Dean was feeling this way, wasn’t it? That they didn’t find anyone in the house… maybe he got burnt to dust that’s why they couldn’t find him. The thought that maybe Castiel wasn’t in the house; that maybe he got the message on time and left the house unattended; that maybe he wasn’t in the house when the bitch decided to attack; was overwhelming.
Mr. Thompson shook his head, looking sad. “No. I've been using the same garden for years now. I've been producing the same fruit and vegetables in my own garden. I think that the supermarket across from me has a better advantage in this case.”
“Ah,” Castiel said. “I didn’t realize we were walking this way to your apartment.”
“Leave as many men here, as you can. I need 24 hours watch on him. Any out of place activity happens, you take care of it. No casualties, whatsoever. As much as I know and trust the doc, make sure he has a clear history to take care of Samandriel,” he turned around and looked at Gabriel. “If anything happens to him...” he left it at that, but Gabriel shook his head.
It was getting out of hand, and fast, and he needed to take care of it before it was too late. Before they’d destroy his family and what he had built over the years. He needed to take care of the Italians as soon as he could. Crowley promised him, again, that he’d get a hold of Lucifer as soon as he could.
“No, sir. Well, not right now sir.”
Castiel was doing some more planning with his men. Dean didn’t need to be there with them for this, so he was relaxing. He had immersed himself in a new TV show, when his phone pinged with a new message. At first, he ignored it, but when it started to ring again, Dean, groaning and feeling annoyed for being interrupted, dug out his phone from his pocket. He unlocked the screen to see who was bothering him at this hour of the day.
. “Touch my shoulders and my arms. But anything below that, I…”
Dean frowned but still looked at Novak. He had a bad feeling in his belly. Was he worried...?
“What would you like me to wear, sir?” and this was something that Dean knew how to do. He knew how to slip into his submissive side and be a good boy for his dom. And he wanted nothing more than to please Mr. Novak. He needed the job and the good money from it, but he also, somehow, liked Mr. Novak. It wasn't that they knew each other well, but Dean felt a slight pull to him. He'd think about it later, for now, he had to impress Mr. Novak.
"Alright," Castiel left Dean sitting on the couch.
“You have!” Balthazar exploded. “Are you out of your mind?” he demanded. “He is not supposed to be here. Not right now, anyway! What if she’ll come right now, at this very second?”
“How did you…” she shook her head. “I’m not even gonna ask. Fine. I will text you tomorrow when I calculate everything.”
“Are you uncomfortable like this?” Mr. Novak asked, with a raised eyebrow.
Castiel got another phone call from Crowley, stating that he didn’t have any news on the matter as to what was happening. Castiel instructed Crowley to get a hold of Lucifer, since Castiel wouldn’t be able to do it himself, unless he wanted to sell out Lucifer’s position in their world.
There was a small pause between them where they stared at each other. Castiel knew that Dean was thinking about his daughter, since he was thinking of her too. This was going to cross some boundaries that they placed between them. Castiel wasn’t sure if this was going to be a wise choice to make, and he would leave in a second if Dean told him so, but then Dean tugged at his arm and pulled him inside. He quietly shut the door after Castiel and he turned on the lamp on the small table. The apartment was a small one. The living room and the kitchen were joined and there were cereal boxes and dirty dishes in the sink. He didn’t have much stuff here, but Castiel started to feel at ease and at home in a matter of seconds.
She gave him a small apologetic smile, which Dean returned with an easy smile of his own. His eyes landed on more paintings on the walls. “Are all of these paintings originals?”
“Safe? From what?”
“Uh… Can we go to uncle Sam’s office?” she asked, looking up at Dean with round eyes.
“I just came in to grab some comfy clothes to change into. And then I’ll just leave you alone,” Dean said as he moved further in the bedroom and went for the closet.
“No? I thought perhaps you were since I have lost just as many men as you have,” Alastair said. He placed his cutlery down and drank his wine in one gulp. He snapped his fingers and a waiter materialized out of thin air to refill his glass again. “I know for a fact, that you are going to lose more men. And another one in just about-“ he looked down at his watch, and nodded, “Yeah, in just about ten minutes.”
Castiel needed more though. It has been a week, after all, and Dean had a glorious body that Castiel loved to touch and explore. Castiel moved his hands down Dean’s body, and moved them to Dean’s ass. He groped at the meat there and moved his hand away from it, to land right back on it with a loud smack. Dean’s breath hitched. He turned his head into Castiel’s neck and started to suck on his neck. “Don’t mark,” Castiel said absentmindedly and Dean eased on the pressure. Castiel let him have a go at it to his heart’s content, but he didn’t ease his spanking. Their hips were still grinding up against one another and Castiel couldn’t take it anymore.
“I’m in my office,” Castiel said in a casual voice.
“I killed someone tonight,” Castiel whispered. His head was on Dean’s chest, and he could hear the steady beating of Dean’s heart underneath his cheek. Dean didn’t say anything, didn’t even stop moving his hand. He was here to listen.
Castiel was waiting for the green light to leave for whichever warehouse they kept the bastard at this moment. He wasn’t even going to speak to him. He was just going to end that miserable piece of shit’s life like he was just a fly on the wall.
“What’s the plan?”
Mr. Novak leaned in and nosed Dean’s head to the side, and buried his face in Dean’s neck. He kissed Dean’s neck, but it wasn’t a soft one. It was hot open mouthed, which placed Dean’s body aflame. Dean shuddered and he turned his head to the side and gave more access to Mr. Novak, who took it with a renewed intensity. “Mmm…” he growled right into Dean’s ear. He nibbled at Dean’s earlobe, electing a soft moan from Dean, and then whispered, “How should I punish you for taking, rather than asking?”
Dean indicated to their stuff by the door and Castiel glanced at them, once, and then back at Dean. He was staring at him with something his eyes that Castiel couldn’t really pin point, but it vanished as he looked away. “Anyway, we better get dressed. You gotta take a shower and go to your sister’s place, right?”
Mr. Novak grabbed his hand and made his way up the stairs, dragging Dean behind him. Dean really hated flying. He did it once, when he was younger, with his family. And that was it for him. They got to their destination alright, but for Dean it felt like he had been in the air for more than three hours. And he’d been sick afterward. They had to go to the hospital and yeah, Dean didn’t wanna go back to the hospital ever again.
“Hmm…” Dean hummed, still staring at Natalie. Still having that itch of unease at the back of his head.
“Bedroom?”
“Dean. I don't really care what type of job you want to have. But this... this is not something I can condone. Not something I'm willing to take a step back and watch how some-some low-life takes advantage of you and beats you up just for shits and giggles.”
But Dean turned his back to Castiel, and shook his head. Without looking at him, he said, “Please don’t. Don’t touch me. I can’t handle it. If you do touch me I can’t handle it.” His voice shook with the restrain to hold back the emotions that wanted to spill out him. “I’m tired.”
There's only 1 chapter ready (aka 10) after this one, and I'm still working on 11... The delay and slight time frame gap between me writing and posting the chapters is BECAUSE of how busy I am. I honestly hate reading WIPs for this exact reason :(
“May I heal you?” Cas asked, eyeing Dean’s bruised cheek like it offended him personally.
“No Dean. I don’t do drunk sex,” Cas said after a heavy pause. He tried to keep his voice as calm as possible but there was no stopping the film of rage that bled through. What father would kick out a son in the middle of the night and in the dead of winter? How could he leave Dean feeling like he had no other option except to whore himself out to a stranger for a place to sleep? And the ease with which he did it made Cas certain this wasn’t the first time.
He knew rationally that Dean probably didn’t consider him a friend, hell, he probably didn’t think of Cas as anything more than a stranger he had brushed lives with a couple times, but Cas couldn’t help but feel a connection with the man.
“So now that you know my life story, what’s yours?” The man asked with a sudden bitter laugh.
When runnerfiveisacat gave me the ‘goes to Cas instead of Lisa” prompt, I really thought this would turn into a happy ending sort of chapter, but in a weird way I’m not ready for this to end, and also I’m way too cooped up and angsty to write a happy ending just yet.
“I discovered this place with Han and Bal… a long time ago. We don’t come here together very often anymore, but I find it peaceful. I thought maybe it’s a good spot to get away from everything and just… slow down?” His eyes were huge and hopeful, like he was looking for approval. For acceptance. To be told that his idea of a first date was in fact not lame.
“Charlie,” she answered, holding out a pale freckled hand, which he shook.
Cas rolled his eyes and sighed. “Birthday?”
“You’re awfully brave calling out such an open welcome in a seedy area like this,” Benny’s voice drifted in from the living room.
“You’re telling me Dean. The actual Dean Winchester is going on two dates in a row with the same person?”
“I have one!” Balthazar quipped, lifting a knee out of the water to reveal a small dark splotch that looked like a scrape.
It was far too early in the morning for the sky to have any colour, and even the weak clouds reflected only grey from the water. Everything felt empty and hopeless, but Dean didn’t allow himself to really dwell on that. He knew his sleep deprived brain was just playing tricks on him, twisting things around to seem as horrible as possible.
“Well load er’up,” Gabriel gestured again with the spatula, thankfully now pancake free. Dean picked a plate off the pile and began doing just that.
They waded out and made a pit stop by the abandoned court to grab their shirts before heading over to the fire pits. The sun was starting to set, but someone had already lit two of the fires and a group was huddled close to the wood and was lighting the third.
Dean fidgeted in his seat. A partner project? What a great class. What a perfect opportunity! He glanced over to Castiel and was pleasantly surprised to find he was already looking in his direction. They both nodded in silent agreement.
Dean cracked his back and sighed. He and Sam had been looking at the lore for who knows how many hours. Their initial scan of the town and interviews with the sheriff and pet owners had been unusually useless.
The dark purple blooms on the angel’s chest vanished under Dean’s hands and Cas sighed.
This time he smirked before Cas could look away. His stomach
“Ah shut up,” came a rough voice. Cas couldn’t see who it was because the pool of light didn’t reach very far, but he could hear that it sounded different from the man that had first spoken to him. Overall it wasn’t a good sign, it meant there were more of them.
“Wanna join me?”
Sam paused for a long moment and it was in that moment that Dean realized he had never told his brother about dating any guys before. There had never been a reason to because none of them were real dates, and honestly, they had never made a habit of discussing his sex life.
The next moments were messy, maybe somewhat frantic. Dean licked into Cas’s open mouth, completely dominating it. One of Cas’s hands grazed across the naked expanse of his back and came to rest on his ass, squeezing the muscle. The other fumbled for the lube and there was the quiet click of the cap being flicked open.
“Got it. Two sandwiches coming right up.” Gabriel gave them both a thumbs up. “You may resume holding hands,” he said, ducking out of the room and shutting the door.
Dean slowed to a stop and leaned heavily with his hands on his knees, panting. They were up by one point, but the other team was fighting tooth and nail to even things out again. Cole gave him a slap on the shoulder as he jogged by, and just like that the action was on again.
.” He pushed Bal back towards the door.
Dean followed his gaze to their joined hands, then looked up to lock eyes with Cas.
“I love you,” Cas said in explanation, flipping them over so he towered over Dean, wings and all.
He drowned the pancakes in maple syrup, then covered the mess in whipped cream until the pancakes disappeared.
Dean lifted a hand and dropped it over the angel’s knee before slipping into a dreamland of black feathers and tanned skin.
Dean looked down at his open jacket and bare feet and suddenly felt ridiculous. He gave Benny a helpless look.
him.”
“Well, thank fuck,” Dean muttered under his breath, pulling the car in park beside his brother’s. He stepped out and Cas followed, eyes shifting around for signs of danger. He knew the monster was technically
The sun was starting to set by the time they parked on the stamped down grass. Cas followed Dean out of the car and past some stacked hay bales where some of the team members were loosely gathered.
He plopped down into a seat near the front, and turned to smile at the redheaded girl who was already seated beside him.
With forensics, you never knew quite what you would encounter, so you had to know a bit of everything.
I spent some time mapping out where I want this story to go, and then I realized something; this isn't just about me anymore, there are my lovely readers along for the ride as well. I have scenes planned that fulfill all of my university AU desires, but I'd love to fulfill yours too! If there are scenes you are burning to see, or others you've seen before but are dying to read a million versions of, let me know and I'll work it in at some point. Love you all!
“Yes,” he interrupted, because whatever it was, the answer was yes. This was something beyond raging teenage hormones. This was a sense of safety so deep and complete that Dean trusted Cas with anything and everything, despite barely knowing him. The realization made Dean’s heart squeeze, a feeling between excitement and that moment right before you hurl.
Once they stepped outside, Dean sighed heavily into the warmth of the late September sunlight. From the corner of his eye, he saw Benny watching him again.
“You can sleep here. Or you can take the bedroom if you want, it’s a little messy though,” Cas said, gesturing to the open door that led to his room. It was overflowing with books crammed on every imaginable surface.
“Sorry, sir,” Dean said immediately. He didn’t mention how Sam was thirteen now, and tough as nails. Dean had no doubt he could outsmart a vampire if he had to. He sat stiffly on the bench beside John, waiting for him to continue. To lecture him. To yell. Something,
seven.
And maybe it’s because they were suddenly out of sight that Cas could speak again. His words came tumbling out, hitched and warped between his spastic inhales.
“Go shower, love. I can heat up some stew if you’re hungry.”
”Can we go fast?” Sam asked, white knuckling the metal wheel between them
“Then don’t,” Dean answered simply. “I could stay like this for years.”
Benny nodded in confirmation, then picked up Dean’s bag and tossed it at him from across the room. “Go move in with your boyfriend.”
For a while, the only sounds in the room were the quiet clinks of cutlery on cheap ceramic plates, but eventually, Cas couldn’t take it any longer.
“Sorry Cas,” Dean answered. “We’re staying at the Grand Point if you wanna come straight there though. Benny and I are in room 208, you could hang out while we get ready.”
“Dinner is served,” he said with a dramatic sweeping bow. Hazel laughed, delighted, and Gabriel kissed her cheek before claiming the last open chair.
Cas gently scraped his teeth over the nipple and this time Dean gasped out for real. His hands flew to Cas’s hair and gripped it almost painfully tight, and Cas tried to lift his head, wondering if what he was doing was still okay. Dean immediately pushed him back down and Cas smiled against his skin, switching to the other side to even things out.
After several minutes, Dean gently added a third finger. Cas was mumbling nonsense at this point and his hands in Dean’s hair were by turn running through it, then controlling Dean’s head. They didn’t seem to know what they wanted. Dean popped off his cock to look at him but Cas was gone, completely absorbed in pushing back into Dean’s fingers.
“No.”
“Dude you’re going to get stung.”
jagged and imperfect. “I don’t know what was going on that night, but… I’m glad you stopped. It… would have destroyed me.”
“I’m going to get a towel to clean us up,” Cas explained as he swung off of Dean, who immediately missed his weight. He turned to the side to watch Cas walk though an open door to a large bathroom he hadn’t noticed before. Cas flicked on a light and Dean’s eyes were immediately drawn to the large tub in the middle of the room.
He, Bal, Hannah, and Charlie had an epic night of pizza and Mario Kart planned, and he was itching to get to Charlie’s and let loose a little. Not that he was uptight at home, but he missed his friends. It was weird to go an entire day without seeing at least one of them.
“You’re strong for an art student,” he laughed. Cas’s eyes were gleaming with pride.
He glared at his reflection in the mirror, marvelling at the unfairness of it all. It was the worst kind of anticipation, being physically reminded that you had a person you were destined to be with, but only when that person got injured.
9. Cas’s first official hunt
got mixed up in it somehow.
“Its amazing,” Dean said around a mouthful. He swallowed and took another large bite.
Dean laughed and pounded lightly on his back, so Cas dropped him back to the ground.
“I’m good, dad,” Dean answered, making an effort to turn his head and smile. John seemed satisfied with that, so he turned the music up and let the loud thrum of rock thump through the car.
“I have to find Sammy,” He said, scanning the room quickly before seeming to realize he had brought nothing with him.
They walked along the beach until the sand soaked the last droplets of the lake off their feet. When they got back to their shoes, Cas slid his feet back into his sandals and Dean brushed off the dry sand before putting his shoes back on.
“Hm,” Hannah said, only half satisfied. “You look like you just stumbled out of bed.”
If this was all he ever got, he would be more than satisfied. Dean had lived off scraps of Cas for so long that this felt like an entire feast.
“It was fine, I taught a class and then had a couple one on one clients.”
“I love you,” Dean said simply in response.
Dean shrugged and Bobby nodded in understanding, disappearing back into the kitchen again.
When they pulled away, Dean didn’t let Cas get very far. He shifted on the couch, tugged and pushed until Cas was more or less sprawled over the cushions with him. He didn’t ask for permission, didn’t give himself time to hesitate, just pulled the blanket back up over them both and tucked his head against Castiel’s shoulder.
“Hello Dean.”
“Nuh uh. You know perfectly well we wouldn’t have gotten a thing done.”
Cas adjusted his backpack and allowed himself a small smile. “Dean. Winchester.”
Cas held Dean’s gaze for a long moment before his resolve broke. He reached out, and to Dean’s surprise, he placed a hand on his shoulder, right where the scar of a handprint was.
A blur of black and blue. Another blur. The thing was running at alarming speed, and out of nowhere, before he could even get a single hit in, Dean was thrown, landing HARD against a fallen tree.
“Hey Sammy, how are you doing?”
“You won’t,” Cas promised, planting another kiss lower still. Dean arched upwards, silently demanding more, but Cas kept on, down over his collarbones, back up to the curve of his shoulders, slowly, achingly slowly over each arm, the firm curve of each bicep, the soft crook of each elbow. Cas kissed Dean’s palms, then the backs of his hands, all the while aware that he was being watched with dark, hooded eyes.
Cas tilts his head subconsciously, exposing his neck further. Dean plants a slow kiss on the throbbing pulse point, making Cas shiver. He does it again, just because he can, and Cas lifts his head to look at him with dark hooded eyes.
Dean crawled back on top of Cas and took his hands, sliding them to rest back on his ass again, as if to prove this was still okay. He could still go through with this.
Dean hesitated for a long moment before speaking. “You were pretty clear about not wanting to see me Cas.”
“Please,” Cas interrupted Dean’s protest. The protests wilted out of him. Who cares if this went slightly beyond the line of friendship and into some unknown territory? Dean didn’t think he could be alone right now anyways. He belatedly realized Cas probably already knew and understood that as he followed him into the darkness of the room and into the still warm bed.
“The feathers have grown in extremely quickly. I believe that can be attributed to our…contact again last night. Thank you.”
“Good morning Dean,” Cas said with a bright smile. That was another thing that had changed. His expressions were clear as day now, more varied than they had ever been. When Cas was an angel, he didn’t quite know how to maneuver his face to show what he was thinking. Now that he was human, he didn’t know how to shield his face to hide it.
Castiel’s heart was in his throat all morning. He didn’t want Dean to hate him, but he also didn’t want to get in trouble for ditching tutoring. He decided that he would do what was asked of him, but not mention a single thing about the soulmate situation.
“Okay. Let’s go.” Benny answered, rising from his perch on the barstool.
“I’ll leave you to your book then.”
Had the creature somehow figured it out? Lured him here, to distract Dean?
Castiel squinted at him, and Dean tried to keep his wince internal. There were about a million things the other boy could have said to him in that moment – a million ways he could have dug under his armour and called him out. Dean tensed, waiting for the inevitable questions, but Cas surprised him. He picked lightly at the grass and exhaled.
“So sensitive sis,” Gabriel teased. “How’s the pottery going?”
“So what part are you at?” Cas asked, curiously leaning over to see what page Dean had opened up to.
“I feel you man,” Dean said to the gull, which was silly but the sound of a voice, even his own, made him feel a little less like the last person on earth.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut and tried to think of something else, anything else, but the memory of his father was too loud and too violent. He stood on shaky legs and cupped some water from the sink to rinse out his mouth. The water he spit back out was tinged red and he realized with some disgust that he must have bitten his cheek while clenching his teeth in his sleep.
“I have a test tomorrow,” Dean tried again weakly. John turned to him, a glint of fury barely held back.
Cas shuddered as Dean’s hand pressed once more onto the small gland.
“You can’t lie to me,” Cas whispered, suddenly more hurt by Dean’s distance than ever. “You don’t know what it’s like, going to bed, waking up
Dean shrugged, “I’ll have to coordinate with soccer games and practices but Wednesdays after class I’m generally free if you’d like to work on this. We can meet at my place sometimes too. I don’t want to bug your brothers if we’re here all the time.”
Ben. You still love her?”
“I can walk out and walk back in again if you’d like,” he suggested cheekily.
“Stop,” Dean breathed, so softly it may have just been a thought.
In the end, they needed a shower after the bath, and by the time they crawled into the bed it was well past midnight, but Dean wouldn’t trade that evening for the entire world.
The weapon dropped to the floor with a thud. Dean watched the blood appear, sudden and red and familiar as an old friend. The wild rat race of his thoughts stilled, like someone pressed pause during the
Castiel counted in his head, six, then seven seconds. From beside him, a whole bunch of air bubbles burbled up, making him laugh, exhaling his own air supply quite suddenly. He lasted two whole seconds more before his lungs were burning so badly that he absolutely
“Mmm. Feisty baby. Let me buy you another drink huh?” Dick gestured to the bartender, who cracked open another beer and slid it over the counter.
“So. How do I do this?”
“Dean,” Benny trailed off.
He had come to the conclusion that he had some sort of feelings for Cas, and if Cas ever made a move on him, he would be completely open to exploring those feelings. The attraction to a man probably could have been startling, since he had never felt this way about a dude, but he found that he just didn’t really care.
“He’s his last one,” Sam bit out. “Alastair. He’s been his last dom.”
He knew that he had to go to her soon when the sun would come out. He needed to know what the next step was, right? Because he was still part of her… family, if you’d call it that. Dean needed to pull himself-
“Maybe you are not, but for them, you provide safety,” Balthazar said, with an amount of seriousness that made Castiel realize that he was right.
Thinking back to the night when his father had to take out a family members’ life… It was something that stayed in Castiel’s head for years. The man was his cousin, twice removed. And at the end, his father turned around, his face covered in splatters of his cousin’s blood, had said in Russian, “
“What was this for?” asked Castiel, his hands lifting up and holding Dean’s face. His thumbs caressing his cheeks.
The next picture was of a boy, who was seven years old. His blond hair was coated in blood. His eyes were open. His icy blue eyes unseeing. His school uniform was dirty and bloody. He was laying down on the ground in the similar fashion as his mother. A white rose underneath his hands.
The two men didn’t pay her attention. They were too busy staring at one another. There was a silent conversation going between them that Castiel had to put down the bowl in front of her. He made his way to Dean, his hands up in a placating way.
“What.”
Dean sighed in frustration and got up from the bed. He looked around the office, taking notice of the books and the shelves around the room. There was a small bar by the corner that had whiskey on it and some glasses. He walked towards it, poured him and Castiel 2 fingers, and looked for the ice. There was a small refrigerator and he squatted down to get it. Once done with that, he walked back to Castiel and gave him his glass. He clicked their glasses together and lifted the glass to his mouth, “Let’s get this going.”
Castiel took another small step forward, but he stopped as he saw Alastair’s hand tightening on her thigh. Castiel looked up into Alastair’s eyes and the man gave him a quirk of an eyebrow. “You actually wanted to take that risk… Oh, Castiel, I love how naïve you can be some times. No, really.” Alastair stepped forward, crossing over Crowley’s dead body. Natalie was now hiccupping, her hair was all over her face and her eyes looked red-rimmed from crying so much. Castiel’s hands itched from wanting to go to her and take her away from Alastair’s dirty hands.
As if he was burnt, Castiel pulled back from the kiss. He snatched his hands out of Dean’s ass and closed his eyes. He could feel Dean’s confusion and worry, coming at him in waves. But he couldn’t allow himself to look at Dean. He didn’t want to see it written all over Dean’s face. He just needed… He just needed to compose himself and try not to have a breakdown in front of Dean.
The floor was covered in carpet and there were comfortable looking couches. But they were unoccupied. Sighing, Dean walked further more into the room and peaking over one of the shelves, he saw Mr. Novak sitting by the desk. A lamp was on by the edge of it, illuminating on some of the books that were scattered over the desk. He was in casual clothes. From where Dean was standing he could only see that he was wearing a black T-shirt, so he didn’t know what he had underneath the table. He was pouring over a heavy looking book, one of his hand was twirling around a pencil, while the other hand was perching his head up. His fingers were inside his hair, and when he’d wiggle his fingers to play with his hair, his biceps would tense up and relax by the movement. Dean tilted his head to the side, and noticed that Mr. Novak was wearing reading glasses.
Mr. Novak moved the toy in and out of him for couple of time, and then it was settled in. Dean squeezed his muscles down on it and gave a full body shudder. He went on to do it again when suddenly the toy started to vibrate. Dean felt his body jerk up and he let out a cry of pleasure. He kept mumbling something but he didn’t know what it was. He was too far gone, but Mr. Novak promised him more than once orgasm, and well.
“I think it’s an excellent decision.”
,” Bobby replied and everyone froze. Castiel really didn’t want to be in the middle of this. He’d rather wait for Dean by the car, then stand here and inevitably be at the end of the Winchesters hatred just because of who he was, or what he’d done. Using one of his nicknames that people gave to him, was not something he wanted to hear from the people that meant so much to Dean. These were good people, he wasn’t going to hurt them. And he hoped that Dean was going to at least try and make him look like a good person too.
“Oh.”
Dean walked to him and butted his forehead by Castiel’s temple. His arms wrapped around Castiel’s waist and he was pulled in for a hug. “What are you doing here? I’ve been waiting for you.”
, sir. Tell me I can touch you
Dean panicked. His body screamed in protest, he felt like his ass was going to be ripped open. He was surprised to feel how lubricated Alastair’s dick was, and it eased his soreness a bit, but it still didn’t feel pleasurable. It was painful, and Dean wasn’t aroused by it at all. His dick hung limp and shrunken into itself on his belly.
“It’s been… hard. The past few years, it’s been hard,” Dean said, and Castiel sort of froze. He remained silent as Dean struggled to find word to say what was on his mind. “I’d been going over this whole thing, back and forth, for the last couple of months… or maybe a lot longer, I don’t really know.”
Dean’s hands uncurled and curled on the chains, as he waited for the next move. Mr. Novak’s hands left his body for only a second, before one of his hands was grabbing on to his nipple and another one was applying the clamp. Dean’s whole body started to buzz from it. His chest arched from it and he let out a low moan from the back of his neck. Mr. Novak applied the second clamp on his other nipple. The cold chain that was connecting them together rested on Dean’s chest, a welcome coldness settled on his heated chest. Dean felt like he was about to die from pleasure, and they haven’t even started doing much.
“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do,” Dean hissed at him, angrily. His whole frame shaking from the rage that was close to the surface. One thing from Castiel, and it would explode. Dean would explode and Castiel would lose him. “You can’t tell me this. Not after what you told me at last night.”
“Hey, it’s okay,” Dean said. “May I?” He pointed to Castiel’s shirt sleeves, which had been rolled up for the scene. Castiel nodded, and Dean started to unroll for Castiel. “You don’t have to cancel anything for me. I will be fine.”
“Why?”
“I’m sorry, I should’ve approached you first, but she noticed me and she wanted to walk with me and show me everything there.”
“Well, always a pleasure to meet a fan.”
I'm really sorry that it's taking me to update the chapters.
His reply was a smile and a tightening of Mr. Novak’s hands on his thighs. Next thing he knew, he was being thrown on the bed and a lean body following up. Dean grabbed on to Mr. Novak and pulled him down on top of him. Spreading his legs wide, Mr. Novak situated himself in between Dean’s legs.
He didn't even pause by the living room, where he could hear voices, talking to one another. He walked right out of the house and down to his garage. There was no one around, so he walked to his car, got in and rode out as fast as he could. With one hand, he texted;
Castiel didn't say that this man's life would be in danger the minute he agreed to do so. He didn't want to scare him off. Not when he was already planning all the things that they were going to get up to, hopefully by tomorrow.
“Really? You wanna know what my boss is like?” Dean asked and he peaked at her from the corner of his eyes.
"Hm?" Castiel asked, looking around himself, searching...
Dean opened his mouth to ask him another question again, probably, but Castiel’s phone rang again and this time it was because of an email. Crowley had sent him an email which held a video. Feeling a bit unsettled, Castiel opened it up and waited for it to download so he could play it.
Dean had sent him the blank message to give him a warning.
“Dude, chill,” Dean told them both. Castiel was slowly making his way to the corner of the table, to stand in the way of the gun; had Balthazar thought that it’d be a better idea to shoot Dean.
Especially when he was spending it with his daughter.
Castiel shook his head as his lips twitched up into a smile. “Alright, missy. I’ve never done this before, and I don’t know how to make pancakes.”
So it made him angry and irritated. Dean was avoiding him; which meant that he would be at the other end of the apartment. He would silently glare at Castiel and his men as they tried to come up with plans on what to do and how to approach this situation. Castiel knew that their final plan would have to be the penthouse, where she lived, but Castiel didn't want to touch that yet.
“He made it perfectly clear where he stood regarding this whole…thing.”
"No?"
“I want to. I want to, sir, please. Please,” Dean was practically begging Castiel. And it was a beautiful sight. Castiel caressed Dean’s face, down his cheek to his chin, to his neck. Dean kept repeating
No! Christ, Anna. No. We’re fine. Great. He’s… he’s at home. Sleeping, or whatever,” he knew his answers were short and clipped, but he was feeling rattled. As if his sister asking about Dean was something that he didn’t think was going to happen. He shook his head and dropped the crumpled napkins on the table. “We’re fine.”
He didn’t walk further in the bedroom. He stopped by the door and waited for Mr. Novak to acknowledge him. He licked his lips and crossed his arms over his chest. He leaned back against the door, looked as Mr. Novak drove a hole on the carpet as he paced, and waited.
Mr. Novak shook his head and said, “You don’t have to apologize. I understand why you’re afraid to meet the pack,” Dean tensed at the mention of them, but Mr. Novak’s thumb caressing his cheeks made him relax enough to listen to what Mr. Novak had to say. “But we have to do this. Because you’re slowly, but surely becoming part of my pack and I want them to get to know you, so there won’t be any mishaps.”
He needed to think. But at the same time, he couldn’t.
. He looked good. Well put together. His hair combed and his suit as a second skin to his body. He has filled up a bit more on the shoulders, but there was a hollow look to his face that Castiel didn’t like seeing. He knew what that usually meant but he ignored that nagging voice from the back of his head. His left hand twitched slightly as Dean looked around the table and his eyes didn’t even linger on Castiel. There was nothing in his eyes that indicated Dean knew Castiel in any way.
“Hng?”
“Dean, don’t be difficult,” Mr. Novak said, his voice was firm, but his eyes were twinkling with amusement.
Thank you for your patience.
“And also, we went to the park the other day and there were so many dogs, daddy. I petted all of them. And even one of them licked my cheek. How great is that?” she was blabbing away a mile in a minute, and Dean felt his heart soar. How was he going to live for the rest of his life, being unable to be around her so much? To see her play in the park all the time… go from a girl into a lovely lady, and… as Dean stared into her green eyes, her face round with full lips and button nose, her black hair long and moving around her frame as she animatedly talked about her adventures (some of them were something that never happened before), Dean realized that she was going to have boys run after her, to try to get her attention as they did so.
The amount of pain his body was going through right now was blinding. Dean clenched his jaw and squeezed his eyes shut as she relentlessly whipped at his back. He knew that she has broken the skin by now but he couldn’t do anything, but stay where he was at.
"I got a package today, which held a severed finger inside of it. We all know whose finger it is, correct?" Castiel looked at them indifferently. They kept quiet. "Now, we all know why we are all stressed out these days, and why I am the way I am these days… We don't need to go over those points, I assume." Nobody said anything to that. "What bothers me the most, isn't the stress that I put all of us under. What bothers me the most is the blatant negligence of endangering everyone's lives on this apartment, yours as well, for the box to cross that threshold without being thoroughly investigated by you." At this, he pointed at everyone in the room.
He got his black shoes on and went inside. He went through the kitchen and noticed how his staff sort of froze as he walked through it. Somewhere in his chest, he felt a discomfort to know that for the last couple of months he had been unbearable to deal with. He clenched his jaw as he walked down the hallway and to the living room. The doors stood ajar, and Castiel had to clench his hands into fists. He took a deep steadying breath, and then walked inside.
Anna was pointing this out to Dean, while they were inside the house. It was extremely hot outside and they didn’t feel like going out and getting in the way of the people working there. Dean was nodding his head along to what Anna was saying to him. She was wearing a white dress today, with sandals, and her hair was up in a ponytail. Dean was wearing jeans with a white t-shirt. His hands were inside his pockets as he looked on the scene before him. It was going to be a beautiful day for them, he could see it in his head already. Anna had a great taste, that was already a given, seeing as she was going to marry Emilio who was extremely gorgeous.
Jessica looked at him for a moment, before she placed her hand over his cheek and said, “You big softie. Let’s go. We have about an hour to eat that chips and have our drinks before Natalie wakes up and Sam comes home.”
He placed the cap on his head, grabbed his phone, and walked out of his bedroom. He went down the stairs where Crowley was waiting for him. “Going somewhere?” he asked, and Castiel walked by him.
Castiel took a steadying breath and pulled back from his brother. His heart was beating fast in his chest. His gun was loose in his hand as it dropped down on the floor. He took couple of steps back from the desk and looked down at his hands; there was so much blood on his hands. His shirt was worse for wear.
“I couldn’t sleep,” she replied, hesitating. Castiel lifted an eyebrow, and she sighed and added, “I can’t go to sleep while you’re not home.” She shrugged again, and flipped a hand. As if to say it wasn’t a big deal. But it was. It was a very big deal.
“So, Mr. Novak. To what do I owe this pleasure?” Kevin asked as he took a sip of his tea.
Dean:
Castiel stared at Balthazar's profile, and then peered at the two men, who barely kept their heads high. “He has secretly started a war against me. So I'm going to, publicly, accept his... advances.”
“Wait, what are you-“
“No,” Dean was quick to answer. His hand curled into a fist behind Castiel’s back, his fingers clutching at the fabric. His other hand curling around Castiel’s forearm on his chest. “I would never do that to you.”
Castiel left the diner and Crowley was quick to greet him. His eyes were full of concern, but he didn’t say anything as he took Castiel’s appearance. “Had fun?” he asked. “I think you didn’t need any sort of assistance there.”
And then one day, Balthazar burst through the doors and fast-walked to Castiel, looking wide-eyed with excitement. "We got him!" he said, and Castiel stood up, his heart beating fast in his ribcage. "We found the Winchester brother."
“You can’t do that.”
Castiel said so, and it looked like Dean wanted to press the issue, but Castiel was quick to say, “I’m tired. I want to sleep.”
Dean nodded at him. After a moment, Dean licked his lips and said, “Do you know…”
“He is still a human being.
“How old are these pack members exactly? Are they big or, what? I need details. For all I know, I’m going to die here.”
Once there, Castiel helped Charlie on her chair, and soon the lights dimmed and there was a small set up on a low stage. An elegant looking woman, with a low cut black dress, walked on the stage. She greeted them all with a humbleness that only a woman her age and pose could handle. Her greetings were met by clapping from some people around the room. She smiled at them, nonetheless, and continued her speech.
Hey lovely people.
Mr. Novak’s armed snaked around his lower back, with no hesitation, as he pulled him flush to his body. Dean sucked in a breath as he felt their belts clank together. Then Mr. Novak’s other hand moved down his shoulder, to his bicep, to his elbow, to his forearm, and grabbed his hand. Dean’s heart rate increased, his lips parted and a breath left them as electric shock passed through his arm through the gesture. They moved slowly to the beat of the music. Swaying from side to side…
Castiel chuckled, his voice gruff, and full of lust. Dean didn’t realize he was saying words out loud. And then he felt empty, but not cold. Castiel had moved back and he was getting himself out of his jeans, and two seconds later, there was the blunt force of Castiel’s dick on his opening, and Dean sat up on his elbows.
“Are you going to punish me for that Mr. Winchester?”
Castiel turned around and stared at Dean, as if he grew another head, “What are you talking about?”
“I get it now,” she said with a slight eye roll. They were quiet for a moment, Charlie sniffling and rubbing her hand over her eyes, and Castiel staring at her thoughtfully. And then;
TW for scars on Dean's body.
“You. Sadistic bastard,” Castiel gritted out through his clenched teeth. He balled his hands up into fists and turned on Alastair. “His family were innocent people. Those children are never going to grow up now, because of you. Who the fuck are you to decide who gets to live and who doesn’t?”
“Why haven’t you?”
, Mr. Novak,” Dean couldn’t keep out the bite from his voice. He shrugged his shoulders, and said bluntly; “That’s selfish of you, just FYI.”
Castiel didn’t let him take another breath; he simply wrapped his hand around his neck again, grabbed Gabriel’s hair. He lifted his head up and hit the desk with the back of his head. Castiel released Gabriel, and he started to struggle for breath.
It was sweet and warm, and everything that Castiel wasn’t familiar with, but he had secretly yearned for.
The call ended and Castiel could breathe easily. His phone chimed with a message, it was Crowley reminding him of his meeting. He also said that he got rid of the people that were waiting to see him. Castiel sighed at that, but he had no other choice but to do just that. Few seconds later, he got up, grabbed his black suit jacket from the sofa by the door, pulled it on, and walked down the hallway. He was in all black today. Black button down, black pressed pants, black suit jacket. He had to meet important people today, so he had to look his best.
Dean frowned. “Yeah. Definitely. Why? Should I be worried?”
“Of course, Mr. Novak,” she replied with a smile on her face.
“Dean, this is Borya,” Mr. Novak said. At his name, Borya nodded at Dean and gave him a smile. Dean returned his smile. “He lives in the forest with the pack. He trains them as much as he can. Considering that wolves can’t be tamed. He’s like a wolf whisperer.”
Castiel pointed his gun at the man’s head and shot. “Wrong answer.”
"Duly noted," Castiel mumbled.
Beside the chair, there were two of his men standing. “Clean up his face,” Castiel said as he sat on the stairs. Crowley handed him his gun, and he checked to see that there was only one bullet inside. “Don’t expect me to miss?” he asked clocking his gun, holding it in his hand.
In blind rage, he clutched her to his chest, and aimed his gun at Alastair. The man in question, lifted his arm to shoot, but Castiel was faster. He pulled the trigger, more than once. He shot at Alastair’s head, shoulder, chest, arm, legs, and more and more places. He made sure to aim to kill, his arm unwavering. He simply poured his bullets in that body of the man that killed a child, that killed his brother, and his family. The man who was so heartless that he simply never thought about any of the consequences of his actions.
Dean wrenched himself away from Castiel and breathed through his nose. He was… he didn’t know what he was feeling. Sadness, yes. Anger, heartache, oh yes. He ran a hand over his face and sighed. This was so fucked up. It was Christmas and this fucker was here, getting drunk and shooting people, and threatening to shoot a girl just because, what?
“No, sir. You-“
“Not every old person knows how to do things.”
and Castiel had no other choice, but sigh and go to the small bathroom. He quickly shed his ruined clothes, and got the water running. He hissed as the first drops of warm water cascaded down his body.
“Hello, Dean.”
In the morning when they woke up, both of them went to the kitchen and Dean had decided to make something for them both. He had asked Castiel to help him out, and poor Anna had to stand back and observe the cluster fuck that was Castiel in the kitchen. They were going to make the
He wouldn’t put it past the man. And wasn’t that thought a pleasant one?
“I may have some ideas on who may be at fault in here,” said Crowley, after staring at Castiel for a bit.
“I’m alright. What brings you here?”
” Castiel whispered into Dean’s ear, trying to keep his voice and noises down.
Alice’s pictures were gruesome. She was almost unrecognizable in them, but she did have her maid outfit on, and there was the Novak family’s crest, as a tattoo, on her thigh. It was her. Castiel felt sad, but he didn’t let it to consume him enough to feel bad about her demise. He just felt sad that after everything that he had done for her, to get out of a bad relationship with her boyfriend who beat her up at every given chance, to leave her house that was a toxic environment for her… she turned out to be a spy for Alastair.
“Do tell me more about your man. What’s he like? Who’s he?”
“Of course,” the doctor said, clapping him on his shoulder and walking away.
He paid for them and stepped close to Mr. Novak. “Mika will take them from you,” Mr. Novak said as one of his men, who materialized out of nowhere, took the bags from his hands.
“Oh?”
“Yes. Everything is okay,” he replied and his hand started to rub Dean’s back.
“Mr. Novak, I need to get you in clear clothes. You’ve whiskey spilled on you. And you’ve been laying in whiskey for a long time,” said Dean, his voice serious, his face unreadable. “You stink, basically.”
“Some of them can,” Mr. Novak replied with a defensive tone to his voice. Dean snorted, and he heard a huff of air in his ear. And then Mr. Novak said, “I only know the things that you will, personally, share with me.”
“She said-“
Dean hopped out of bed and went to the bathroom to take a quick shower. Once he was thoroughly cleaned up and done, he dried himself up with a towel and went in search for something light to wear. It was a hot night. He finally decided on jeans and a white loose shirt, with the couple of buttons on his chest open, and the sleeves rolled up. He styled up his hair quickly, grabbed his phone and left the house in record time. The car was already waiting for him. Another car was right behind his. Dean sort of felt weird for being treated this way, and he had a half a mind to tell Mr. Novak to cut this out, but then he remembered the way he looked today when they were arguing and just sighed. He shook his head and got in the car. As soon as he was seated, his chauffer drove the car into the city.
“Which is what?”
“True,” she replied softly, her eyes filling with relief. They walked down the hallway a bit more. Dean felt like they'd been walking forever. And it looked like it was part of a hotel hallway. What caught Dean’s attention was the glass ceilings. It was a clear sky full of stars. Finally they stopped before a double door and Lora took a step forward and opened up the doors.
“Oh, Mr. Novak. You're such a flatterer,” she said with a chuckle and started to serve their food. “The main course is beef steak. I hope you like it, Dean?” Dean nodded. “This one here enjoys them a lot, but he'll never admit to it.”
He moved up again, his hands still touching Dean's body. Once he was standing up, Mr. Novak's hands moved back to his ass and he knead them in his hands, which only pulled Dean closer to his still clothed body. Dean knew better than to ask him to get undressed right now. It was Mr. Novak's right to get to know his body.
“It hurts,” Castiel repeated. And he really didn’t have any control over his mouth, he just blurted out. “It hurts just how much I love you.”
“Grandpa,” Dean muttered, finishing his drink. Castiel only laughed at him.
Before he could say anything ridiculous, Dean leaned forward and captured Mr. Novak’s lips into a kiss. It was a soft one; lips pressed up together, no tongue. Just their lips moving together in a soft embrace. Mr. Novak slid his hand to the back of Dean’s neck and grabbed onto his hair, and Dean did the same as well. Mr. Novak’s hair was soft in his hands. Dean’s hair was soft as well, but he used gel in them, from time to time if he wanted to style it, but Mr. Novak left his hair just the way it was, which made him look really good.
Enjoy~
Castiel stood up, feeling heavy. He felt hopeless. Maybe Dean wasn’t even behind those doors. Maybe he wasn’t even here anymore. Maybe he was already gone, just like his… Castiel didn’t finish that thought. Castiel made his way to the doors. He wasn’t armed. He didn’t care if they were going to kill him. Maybe that would be the best outcome for him from this mess.
Castiel walked to his bedroom where he changed his clothes to his favorite and probably the most expensive suit he owned. It was an Armani suit, and completely in black. The fabric felt amazing to the touch. The sims of it clean cut. The tailor had done an amazing job on it, since it fit him like a glove and he loved how it made him feel confident. Castiel walked to his dresser where he kept his ties and watches. He had a small black box at the far back of the drawer where he reached for it and pulled it out. The box held a ring that he hadn’t used for a very long time.
“Out,” Castiel said to the girls, his voice a low growl. The sloppy sound that the girl made as she retracted herself from his lap was lewd. She wasn’t wearing anything. Both of the girls grabbed their robes and quickly left the office. The elevator doors hissed shut after them.
Dean dropped his towel down and knelt down on his knees, and bent over Castiel’s thigh. Castiel grabbed onto his hands and held them in a grip. He rubbed Dean’s ass cheeks with his free hand and then started to spank.
“Yes,” Castiel replied.
“Hey, hey, it’s okay. I got you,” Mr. Novak whispered to him. His voice low, and warm, and awfully soft. It helped Dean to take more steadying breaths. “Sshhh… I got you. It’s okay…” He kept making shushing noises and kept saying reassuring stuff to Dean. It took him several minutes to realize that he was letting out broken noises.
(See the end of the chapter for
She stood up from her seat and glided over to him. Her dress kissed the floor as she made her way to him. Dean looked at her, and his heart jumped, not in fear when he saw the way she was looking at him, but with excitement that she was going to touch him in
“Yes.”
“Yes.”
Castiel ignored his remarks. He continued to walk to one of the cars. “I know where they are. I’m going after Dean. You,” Castiel said pointing at Crowley. “Take some men with you and go after Gordon.”
Dean moaned as he breathed out through open mouth.
Once in his bedroom, Castiel went to take a shower. He let the warm water cascade over his body as he hung his head forward and squeezed his eyes shut. He wasn’t going to break down here. That would seem incredibly cliché and a B-rated movie where the main character always ended up crying over hurt feelings in the shower. He wasn’t going to be that character.
“You stupid, stubborn man.”
his sub since he wasn’t around anymore. And it was for a good reason.
Don’t be a coward.
“Gordon was mine, and not yours to take.”
Dean sighed and shut his phone, without reading her messages. He threw his phone down on the couch and walked to where Castiel was standing at. He hesitated for only a moment, and then said, “Cas?”
“What do I get in return?” Castiel asked. “Aside from you.”
I hope you'll enjoy it~
Dean shook his head, swallowed and said. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to make so much noise.”
“Yes, sir,” Dean replied just as Mr. Novak started to kiss him again.
There was something happening outside these walls. There were shouts and grunts and screaming. There were guns being shot and just a general ruckus that didn’t sound good at all. Dean’s eyes fluttered as he tried to open them, but he couldn’t keep them open for too long. He was dehydrated, and tired. So, so tired, it would be great if he could just close his eyes and sleep, but he couldn’t even do that. His whole body felt like it was on fire. He was so tired that he couldn’t even make himself go to sleep.
“Castiel,” Anna said again, suddenly sounding a lot older than she actually was. “I’m positive that he would talk to you. I’m positive, if you were to call him, and just talk to him, he would listen. It’s been… how long has it been, Castiel?”
“I work with my uncle Bobby at his garage,” replied Dean swallowing his food down quickly.
Castiel stood back up as Dean sat up and started to get his phone out of his pocket. His breathing was uneven and his cheeks were warm with an aroused blush. As he looked down at the ID, Castiel saw him swallow before he looked up at Castiel. His pupils were blown wide and he seemed to be having some sort of internalized struggle with answering the phone.
And as for Mr. Novak; he was a sight for the sore eye. Dean wanted nothing more than to go back to the house and have their way, but alas, it wouldn’t happen until late to the night.
“What was your name again?” Natalie asked as she wiggled in her seat.
“Sir, where are you-? What should I do with the guests?”
They all meant something, but Castiel paid no attention to any of his nicknames. He did what was required of him. And he took care of everything and anything that was brave enough to go against him.
Dean just nodded at him.
“Bobby-“ Sam started but Bobby held out his hand to silence him.
“This isn’t what you want, though, is it?” Mr. Novak asked. Dean felt that small tug on his heart, which he quickly dismissed.
“It's as I said, I needed the money. And I was good at what I would do,” Dean replied with a shrug.
“And the man that handed it to me, who was he?”
There was also the question of Natalie missing. The sweet little kid who still had to learn of the way in life, and to learn what it was like to be a teenager, and fall in love, and have a boyfriend, or a girlfriend, and just… live her life.
“Oh, it's on the first floor. I apologize, I forgot to mention where everything was,” she said. Her voice held a nervous edge to it, that Dean didn't like hearing. He shook his head and said.
The questions swirled around Castiel’s head throughout the day. They sat for dinner, and everyone was there to enjoy it. Balthazar sat at the end of the table, opposite Castiel. On Castiel’s right was Alfie, and on his left; Dean. And Lora sat beside Dean, and then everyone was sitting around the table. At first, Castiel could feel the tense air surrounding the table and he was, mentally, preparing for the barrage of words being thrown at one another. But, nothing came out.
Castiel breathed through his nose, and slowly opened his eyes. His heart stopped beating; he was all alone.
The big, oak table was already set and Dean noted that the plates were close to each other; one at the head and the other on the right.
“He can protect himself, Dean. He has a big support from different families. They’d die for him in a second, then let anything happen to him,” Anna said, her voice filled with conviction and firmness. “He will protect you, as well. I really do hope that nothing will ever happen to you, because I know how he will react to it. And Dean?” Dean looked up at her, seeing her face open and full of support for this whole thing. “He will kill everyone that will ever lay a hand on you, or has ever laid a hand on you.”
“Mr. Novak?” It was Dean's voice. Castiel straightened up as Dean approached him. He looked good. All greased up, covered in sweat and his hair looked as if he had a rough sex. Castiel's hand curled into a fist by his side, as to not grab it. “How can I help you?” he had a dirty rag in his hands with which he was trying to clean his hands, but Castiel wasn't sure if it was helping the matter. Castiel was tempted to grab Dean's hands and clean them up himself, but he held himself back.
“My brother’s been undressing you all night long with his eyes,” she whispered to him, leaning forward.
Dean’s shoulders moved up and down as he breathed in and out, trying to calm down. In the end, he asked in a small voice, “How?”
and his sub, to take care of him as he was a little baby.
Soon, with lots of kisses and promises of play time together from Sam to Natalie, Dean and Natalie left the office, walking hand in hand. Couple of the ladies who worked there looked at them with adoring eyes. Some of them gave the sultry glances at Dean. But he didn’t pay any mind to them. He wasn’t interested in any of them.
“Come here, baby,” Natalie went to her willingly and she even hugged her mom extra, and promised to be good and listen to her dad.
“I want pancakes.”
Dean seemed to hesitate, but he nodded nevertheless. Castiel leaned in and kissed him on his forehead. “Yeah?” he answered his phone, and watched as Dean moved out of bed and walked to the wardrobe to get changed again.
Dean’s hand twitched as he caught a glimpse of Mr. Novak through the window. He grabbed the door’s handle to go out, but it was locked. “I need to get out here,” Dean said as he looked at the rearview mirror. His chauffer looked right back at him, and shook his head.
Another thought came to him as he continued to look at Mr. Novak; was he supposed to tell him about it? Was he supposed to let Mr. Novak know about how much of an animal Alastair was? That he was the one that marked Dean so severely that he would never be able to see a clear skin on his body? Was he supposed to share everything that he knew of the man with Mr. Novak? Would that help, or would that endanger their lives even more?
Reaching up to the sky, he felt the muscles stretch on his sides. He breathed out slowly through his nose. And then took a deep breath as he bent forward and touched his toes. He closed his eyes, as he let his arms feel loose. He took another breath as he straightened up once again; this time feeling as his spine went through the motion of rearranging itself into an upright position.
“The person who told me this was unsure himself,” Balthazar said. “Why care if he’s still going to be there and you’ll get to see him yourself.”
It’s been a week since Dean had un-officially moved in with Castiel. The first night Dean had slept in Castiel’s bed was just that. The next day, Castiel made a room available for him and since then he’d been sleeping there. The nights weren’t easy to go by, since Dean felt on edge and sort of scared for his wellbeing. He was, of course, concerned about the people in the house as well. So he was going through more sleepless nights than it was healthy.
Dean took a steadying breath and looked around his bedroom. Most of his clothes were packed in a small carry on. He wasn't going to give up this apartment. Even though it looked like a bomb had went off, most of the time, Dean still liked this place. So he was going to keep it.
They played with them for couple of minutes more, when a man walked out of the forest. He was an old man, with plaid shirt, and jeans. He was wearing a cap and he looked like Uncle Bobby. He had a leash in his hand. He approached them and nodded at Mr. Novak. They started to speak in a language that Dean didn’t understand. It was probably Russian. The man had green eyes, and for a moment Dean thought that they might be relatives.
“Ah, thank you,” Dean said. Mika only nodded and then left for their cars. And they continued walking down the street.
“Cleaning up the city.”
“Oh, hello,” he seemed surprised to see Dean here. “I think I know you from somewhere.”
“Because I can’t stay here for long,” he replied with a shrug. “She’ll know that I’m not at home soon, and she’ll send out a search party for me. Which, I know for a fact, will end in blood.”
“Dean,” Sam said. “I don’t want to say it again, because I know the reason why you’re doing it, is, but… you can’t keep your personal life private from them. If this-this Gordon man knows about you, about Natalie, it… it’s not good.”
“Let’s talk about someone you care about,” Alastair said completely ignoring what Castiel said. “Dean Winchester. Did you know that he was mine before he left to have a
“I wasn’t really thinking, Dean,” Castiel said, already starting to feel worse than he had before. He looked down at Dean’s chest and then closed his eyes. He pursed his lips and ran a hand over his mouth. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have come. I’ll just leave.”
PPS: if you'll see any mistakes, kindly let me know so I can take care of it later on.
“Come here,” he whispered. He knew that Mr. Novak heard him because he turned his body towards Dean, but didn’t acknowledge him. Dean was thankful for that. The puppy wobbled his way towards Dean and right away started to nibble on Dean’s fingers. “Easy, easy,” Dean said with a laugh. He pulled the puppy closer to him and started to pet him.
Castiel went to his bedroom, grabbed his suit jacket, and left the apartment. Balthazar and his men were waiting for him as he got down to the ground floor. Balthazar indicated his men to go to their cars, while he opened the door for Castiel to get in. Alfie was his chauffeur for the trip. He was quiet all the way to his doctor's house. Castiel made a mental note to have a word with him.
Confessing this, though, left him vulnerable. It was only Sam, his little brother, yes, but he didn't... it wasn't fair for Dean's emotions and feelings. Knowing that someone out there knew about what they enjoyed doing, what gave them pleasure.
Dean was quiet all this time, while the thoughts swirled around in his head. They were silent. Castiel still had his hands wrapped around Dean’s wrists. He stared down at their hands together, noticing how different they looked; Dean’s hands were calloused, hard worked, a scar here and there from working on cars. Castiel’s hands looked bloody to him; murderers. Taking people’s lives just because they displeased him.
A couple of days later, Sam and Eileen’s place was packed. They were having a pre-Christmas party with their friends. Dean knew of this, but sometimes a lot of people at one place, at once, was too much for him. But it didn’t stop him from socializing with people. It was nice to talk to his brother’s friends. Even though some of them were too uptight and too lawyer-ish, they were still cool people.
“Hello, Samandriel,” Castiel said, and at this moment Samandriel did look like a kid.
“Right...” There was a slight pause in their conversation. “I never told you where I worked, though,” Dean continued, his eyes looking suspiciously at Castiel.
Dean shook his head, “No, not yet.”
Mr. Novak let out a grunt and he breathed out heavily as he pulled back and sat beside Dean. He took deep steadying breaths. Once he regained it, Dean felt him leave the bed. For a panicked moment he thought he was being left behind like this, but then Mr. Novak said, “I’m putting some clothes back on. I’m right here, by the bed. I’m not going anywhere.”
Dean lifted his hand to Silver’s snout and waited for him to sniff, or do whatever he was trained to do. It took Silver only a second and then he was licking at Dean’s fingers. Mr. Novak chuckled and looked up at Dean. “I’m not even surprised,” he said. “He likes you.” Dean looked away from Silver to look at Mr. Novak. The warmth in his eyes made Dean shudder.
It was going to be just a talk. There wasn’t anything that would go wrong from just talking, right? Then why was he so nervous?
He looked even better in person. He stopped right in the middle of the room and stared at the man who was relaxing on the sofa, with his eyes closed. It wasn't late into the night, but it didn't look like he was sleeping either. He certainly didn't open his eyes as he heard the elevator doors slid open and shut, so Castiel cleared his throat.
"Presumably, yes."
Castiel licked his lower lip as he thought about it some more, before he stood up from his chair. Crowley gave him a look that was full of satisfaction. Castiel rolled his eyes as he made his way out. “Get the cars ready. We leave in ten.”
“Why are you studying this, though?” Dean asked fiddling with the old yellowed pages on the desk. He was leaning up against his elbow on the table. Trying to act casual, while his heart beat frantically in his chest.
His face was the best thing Castiel had ever seen for a long-long while. He had the best “O” face and Castiel was needy. He needed to see it again, and again, and make Dean come all over his body again. His breathing got quicker as he continued to stare at Dean’s sweaty face. What he’d give to bury his hands in Dean’s hair and just grab at it and pull and fuck into Dean’s body without a care in the world.
He got dressed in a t-shirt and jeans from the bag he brought with him. Getting his socks on his feet he padded out of the bedroom and made his way to the living room; remembering the way from yesterday. He could hear voices talking to one another. It was easy to pick out Castiel’s deep and heavy voice from the bunch. His was engraved in his head for some reason.
Dean could feel a tear sliding down his cheek as he felt the pain he felt when he walked away. The love he felt for Castiel. The brightness that that man had lit up in his heart. And now, all of those emotions were being glossed over with this realization; he didn’t want Castiel to die.
She's based off of my niece, and trust me, she's almost 5 now, and she's too much to handle.
“They can give you about thirty minutes. Tops,” Crowley growled into his ear.
Mr. Novak nipped at his lower lip, and then moved his kisses down to his neck, sucking and biting on the skin. Dean tipped his head to the side and exposed more of his neck to Mr. Novak. His hands clutched at Mr.  Novak tightly, grinding his hips up to move this whole thing faster. Good thing Mr. Novak was in the same boat as him because he licked and nipped his way down his body. Dean still had his shirt on, they both did, but their jeans were unzipped and unbuttoned and when Mr. Novak made his way down his body, he simply dragged down Dean’s underwear and took him into his mouth.
“Okay,” Dean said nodding, understanding. “Okay.” He stood up and started to take off his clothes. Castiel frowned in confusion and stared at him.
There was a shuffle and a click as the door closed. Castiel continued showering and soon he was done. He grabbed a towel from the rack, and wrapped it around his waist. And a smaller one to run through his hair. He stood in front of the mirror and wiped away the steam from the mirror.
Dean touched his lips as they started to walk down the street. Mr. Novak was wearing khaki beige pants, and a white shirt as well, with the sleeves rolled up and couple of buttons loose. He was at ease, and even if the meeting was an important one, it wasn’t one that required for him to wear a suit and be presentable.
“Huh?”
“How would you like for your meat to be cooked, sir?”
Another one came in, “Three.” Dean's lips fell open in a desperate cry. “Four.”
Dean Winchester never looked so pale, or broken in his life.
“Sit down, and stop acting like a brat,” Castiel told him. Dean gritted his teeth and stared as Castiel made it to one of the chairs and sat down.
“Sit up,” Mr. Novak said in a husky voice and Dean complied with the request. He sat up and helped Mr. Novak to take his shirt off. Once it was off, they started to kiss again. Their lips danced together in a lustful haze. Dean quickly got desperate for more. For more skin, and touching, and grinding, and his hands moved to Mr. Novak’s shirt when he was stopped. “Don’t.”
was known for its extensive winery. The people who worked here were extremely snobbish. Which Castiel was never a fan of. As the car stopped and most of his men got out of their own vehicles, Castiel looked at the building of the restaurant. He licked his lips as he reached for the car’s door handle.
“Thank you for coming,
Dean had let out this small muffled sound, and frowned into the kiss, as if in surprise. Which only made Castiel hold him tighter and deepen the kiss. It took Dean only a second to kiss him back, his shoulders relaxed once he kissed back. It was rewarding; because the way Dean kissed him made Castiel believe that Dean felt the same way about him.
Castiel didn’t knock on Dean’s door. He simply opened it and walked inside, shutting it behind him. But the bedroom was empty. He walked towards the bathroom, and it was empty too. Castiel walked out of there and walked to their play room, and after going around he found that empty as well. Where could he be? He shut the door after him and stood there for a moment, thinking.
He didn’t have an active sex life, but he knew when he wanted to have a one-night stand with an attractive person. It was weird. It wasn’t as if they were having a sexual conversation, but they continued to talk to each other for the rest of the night, laughing and toasting, and what have you. It was a good night.
Balthazar straightened up and waited for him to come out. Black suited men came out of the big cars, but he had his eyes on the smaller car.
Natalie, his daughter, cried as she learned that she wasn't going to see her daddy all the time. She cried when she was forced to leave the court with only her mom. Dean could never forget her face at that moment. How she begged and threw a tantrum, screaming for him to not go...
“I will,” Castiel replied automatically, because what else was he going to say?
Castiel’s whole body seized up in a panic. His shoulders straightened up and his brain stuttered to a stop. But then his whole body unraveled and he reached for his phone. There was an unfamiliar number on his screen, with about five missed calls. He called back, and on the second ring, a familiar voice answered.
“This is your bedroom,” she said as she stepped to the side and waited for him to move in.
Her hands froze close to his face, and Castiel looked straight ahead at the wall. Not daring to talk. Not daring to look at her face. He wasn’t going to break down in front of a stranger. That was out of the question.
Castiel stared at his own face, and a blurry picture of his house, burnt to a crisp, police cars surrounding it. The headline basically stated that he was dead, or missing from the house. His heart sped up as he kept reading the article. It was…horrible. To say the least. And wrong on some places, but Castiel just skimmed through it. From the outsider, it looked like he was dead… Dean probably thought he was dead. He breathed out through his nose and placed the phone back down on the table. He had to contact Dean and tell him that he was alive. He took a deep breath to say so, when Balthazar cut him off.
And also Natalie!
Lucifer snorted and rolled his eyes, his smirk wiping off of his face in a second. “Right, because our father was so amazing that he not only named me after the devil, but he made sure that I became one as well.”
There was at least five men running at him at full force. Castiel ducked down as the first man tried to punch him. He grabbed the man by his waist and shot him on his side, and then aimed his gun at his chin. The man went down. The others were delivered the same fortune.
Castiel had a feeling. And when he had a feeling, he usually acted on them. And when he acted on them; there was always blood. And if it meant that he was going to get his hands bloody again, for Dean, then he was going to gladly get his hands dirty.
“Yes, sir,” she replied and got to work.
“I see. Wow! You’ve gotten taller.”
“Nothing yet from the day. Sorry, boss,” Balthazar said. He sighed and placed his phone back in his pocket.
But Castiel knew what he was doing. He forced Dean’s hands above his head and grabbed onto them, tightly with one of his hands, the other one titled and held Dean’s head up to kiss him on the lips. Dean wasn’t kissing him back, but it didn’t matter for Castiel. He just needed to have Dean. Have some release.
He closed his eyes and sighed. Suddenly, Castiel felt tired, and weary, from all of this. He just wanted to get back to his slow and boring life. It had never been a slow and a boring life, but in the last couple of years, his life had been exactly that.
“None,” Castiel replied, recognizing him as one of the men who used to be on Dean’s former team. He should have never changed the gang. He should’ve left them as they were before. The other team was dust now. On Castiel’s orders.
He could hear the birds chirping in the distance, soft ruffles of the leaves as the wind blew through them, the dull noise of his boots as he stepped over the branches and the muddy places. There was a crack in the sky as the sun tried to desperately break through them. Castiel looked up a bit and squinted. It was going to rain soon enough again, but Castiel didn’t mind it, not one bit.
“Надо было подумать об этом лучше, не так ли? (
He cried about everything. He was tired and he needed to be held and he needed to feel warm again. And there was the voice in his ear, the voice that knew how to ground him while he was crying about this mess that was his life. How much of a fuck up he was.
He freed one of his hands from underneath her hand, and ran it over his face. He turned the other one to grab her hand in his. He licked his lips and sighed through his mouth. “I don’t… I don’t know what to do. I’ve never been like this with a…client, before. I’ve never… I don’t…” He couldn’t finish the sentence, because he didn’t know what to say. When he tried to come up with something, his phone rang with a new message. “Sorry,” he mumbled and picked up his phone from his pocket.
“So… you want me to stay? So I’ll answer to her questions?”
And Castiel would be damned if he didn't try and have this man for at least a week.
Of course she would learn that from him.
What felt like forever later, but it was probably few minutes, Dean heard Mr. Novak unbuckling his seatbelt and standing up. Dean peaked up at him again and saw him stretch his arms above his head. He moved to the bar and got a big bottle of water from there. He walked back to Dean, placed the water on the floor and started to unbuckle Dean’s seatbelt. Dean’s jaw was clamped shut so hard that he didn’t even have the nerve to tell Mr. Novak to not do it. So he simply sat there, and stared at Mr. Novak’s face.
"In her apartment, I think," Sam said with a frown. "I could hear her a lot on most days, so I guess I was there. I was moved from point to another point a lot when they first captured me, I never knew why. But then one day, I woke up in this… bedroom, I guess. And I stayed there for some time. And then yesterday, or was it today? I don't know. They moved me to this warehouse and that's where your men came for me…" Sam got this faraway look on his face, as he added, "Come think of it, your men are actually good at something. And that's killing other people." Sam closed his eyes and shook his head, as he sighed. "Anyway, the next thing I know I'm being moved again, but this time there was this blond-haired man, with a British accent, telling me that I'm safe now."
“You’re adorable,” Castiel said, his smile still present on his face. “But no, it’s not my phone. I actually brought stuff that I wanted to try. Hang on.”
“Wait,” Dean moved fast to grab onto Castiel’s arm. The warmness that was radiating off of Dean’s skin was grounding for Castiel. He stopped, of course he would stop. There was something warm in his chest that he didn’t feel before. He got here for this. He needed to see Dean for this. To be able to think like a rationale human being. To be able to just be himself again. “Don’t go. Tell me what’s wrong?”
For the first time since they had broken things off, Dean had been nothing but loyal to his bosses after Castiel. Especially to Amara. But right now, he had gone ahead and broke that trust and loyalty. And for what? For making sure that the man who was responsible for the killing of his daughter to know about the oncoming assault?
In the hospital, away from the meeting, a man wearing nurse clothes walked inside a room that held a young looking man, in his early twenties. He was fast asleep, the heart monitor a steady sound in the room. The man approached the bed cautiously and grabbed the IV line. He took out the syringe from his pocket, and pushed the contents into the IV fluid.
The house wasn’t as big as his mansion, but it was still big enough to have four spare bedrooms. This one was in warmer colors; brown, beige, and white. The furniture and the interior design all held an antiqueness to it that Castiel was fond of, so he never got around to changing anything in here. He dragged Dean after him and into his bedroom which was on the second floor to the right. He didn’t pay attention to any of the details. He was too concentrated on Dean and their need right now.
When he stood back up, he took Castiel’s hand in his and they made their way to the shower. Dean made sure that Castiel was the first one in, and the first hit of water on his skin felt amazing. He closed his eyes and let out a small moan. He felt Dean’s body heat behind his back, and he fought down the urge to lean back against Dean’s naked body. He felt the need as a physical pull. The need to touch and let Dean touch him was so much that it felt painful to even have the warm water cascade down on his body.
Dean gave a once over to the way she was strapped in. Feeling confident, he closed the door of his car, and walked around it to get to the driver’s side. He stopped before he went in, because Lisa was standing on the porch of her house.
Leave me your thoughts!
Castiel sat at the head of the dining table as he looked at the map that was covered in red markers. Dean had marked down every single operating offices that Amara had throughout the city. Some of them were known to Castiel, but the majority of them were unknown places for them. Balthazar sat at the other side of the table, his face drown into a scowl. Lora was sitting at the chair close to Dean; and Alfie was sitting across from him. Dean was standing, though. He was concentrating hard on the map as he marked down another place. “This one isn’t visible. It’s underground. It’s a brothel.”
After everything was said and done, and they were free from the Italians, for good, would he want to be with Castiel? Would Castiel want to be with Dean? Was he too hurt from the bitch to be able to be with someone else after the whole thing? Were they ever going to have a normal life, as normal as Castiel’s life was going to get? What was going to happen?
“It was your choice to become that,” Castiel said smoothly. “I didn't ask you here to fight with you over this.”
“Thank you,” said Dean, feeling warm inside. She seemed like a nice lady. She reminded Dean of his mom, and aunt Ellen, uncle Bobby's wife.
He moaned around it and with a surprise, he realized that he couldn’t taste the latex from a condom. It made him moan louder around it, and he started to lick and suck on it from this position, as much as he could. Mr. Novak growled and grabbed on to his hair and tugged his head back in a way he wanted. And then he was fucking into his mouth with hard fast thrusts.
“And you’re way too much of an idiot to come here alone.”
“Nonsense,” she said. “I’m Jessica. These two idiots forgot their manners, it seems.”
And just like that, they started the negotiations. Castiel was more interested in knowing if they had buyers and how many of them were, and what they had planned to do with the merchandise. The most important one for Castiel was the question of the age of the people they were planning on selling these stuff to. When Aaron told him that he wanted to sell them to the people who were at least close to the age of consent that landed him positive points.
“I'm safe,” Dean said and shook his head. “Damn it, Sammy. This is the only way for me.”
“Alastair.”
Castiel looked down, sighing through his nose. He wanted to take a step back but Dean grabbed onto his T-shirt to prevent him from doing so. Castiel looked up and into Dean’s eyes, before he looked down again. “Lucifer’s dead. I saw it happen. And I couldn’t do a damn thing about it. I needed to be here so I could clear my head before I’d go after the son of a bitch who did this.”
“Mr. Novak, stop staring at my ass,” Dean said as he rolled back and shut the hood. He turned around and quirked up a brow at Castiel; to which Castiel answered with a smirk.
“No,” she said. “I’m simply don’t care who my patient is today. Or any other day, for that matter.”
It didn’t go unnoticed by Dean, when Castiel was going to make his way to Dean, he rested his hand over the boy’s shoulder, and he relaxed in his sit.
“Oh, am I allowed now?” Dean fought down the urge to stick out his tongue. But he did role his eyes as he stepped out of the car. “Hello,” he said as he bumped into Mr. Novak. He smelled of smoke and he looked a bit tired, but he still had a smile on his face that looked pleased. So maybe the meeting was successful. Just then, right in the middle of an open street, Mr. Novak leaned forward and kissed him on the lips. Dean closed his eyes and enjoyed the small kiss for a bit, before they pulled back.
A stab went through Castiel’s chest and he let out a shaky breath. He clenched his hands and run through reasons as to why he couldn’t approach him right now and see how he was. If he needed help. If he wanted to talk to Castiel again. If he wanted to…
“What for?” he asked again.
Dean was letting out groans and moans, and he realized that he was starting to get louder so he turned his head into his arm and muffled his noises. Mr. Novak kept working him open with only his fingers. Dean’s eyes rolled back when Mr. Novak used a third finger, and then after a moment of wiggling his fingers inside of him, he added his pinky to the mix and Dean nearly blacked out. The plug wasn’t that big, but maybe Mr. Novak wanted to get him loose and ready for it.
Dean’s stomach growled and he nodded, “Yeah, I’d like to.”
So he kept his mouth shut, and rode along the silent train with Mr. Novak.
Thank you all so much for being patient and reading it.
Dean swallowed and placed down the glass and nodded, “Yeah. Sorry. I'm just slightly-”
Dean’s hands on him, but he couldn’t. Not yet.
Trust. Dean was trusting him again. Or he never stopped trusting Castiel, he wasn’t sure. But it was there. Staring right at him. Castiel swallowed with a click and his hand glided down to Dean’s cheek. He cupped Dean’s cheek and Dean turned his head to lean into his hand; his lips grazing Castiel’s palm. Castiel held back a full body shudder. He caressed his thumb over Dean’s cheekbone and tried to smile down at Dean, but it felt forced. He moved his thumb down and caressed Dean’s lower lip.
“Hello, Dean,” he said. “Ready to go out?”
“Huh?”
“What.”
In his life, that was a slim possibility.
"Of course. Where's he?" Castiel asked as he shook the doctor's hand.
The doctor looked apologetic as he sighed and looked down at the baby in Sam’s arms. “She had a gunshot wound at the back of her skull. It seemed that she had been shot from a distance, but it never left her head. It was still in there when we got her.”
He truly was getting old.
Mr. Novak didn’t push him to end the sentence, instead he just continued to touch him. His hand never made their intentions to be in a sexual way. He simply rubbed his back, to soothe him. And to probably have a way to touch Dean.
Castiel took off his suit jacket and placed it over the rickety chair in the ware house. He rolled up the sleeves of his button down up to his elbows and walked over to the table, where they had their weapons resting. He heard the grunts of the two men, bound to the chairs in the middle of the house. He grabbed his favorite handgun, Kimber, off the table and started to get the bullets in.
,” Mr. Novak shuddered as Dean dragged his teeth down his neck and to his shoulder. His hips bucked down and Dean gasped out, bowing his body down; wanting to feel it again, but not, at the same time. His senses were high wire and he wanted to feel
Dean closed his eyes and turned his head down to bury his face close to Castiel’s neck.
Leave me your thoughts please, so I can actually start working on chapter 9 lol
“She… she got shot.”
Dean blinked couple of times, and brought himself back to the present. He took a shaky breath in and looked back at the man. But before Dean could form words, or think of a response to what the man said, he was already out of the house. Dean swallowed around, what felt like sand paper. He ran a clammy hand over his mouth and he tried to take a steadying breath. His hands were shaking and he felt out of place; he needed to take off everything from him and just scrub himself clean.
Dean hesitated for a second by the door, but then he crossed the floor to where Mr. Novak was sitting at. His jeans weren't the comfiest clothing for kneeling on the ground, but he had no other choice than to do it.
“Morning,” Dean said gruffly. His mouth felt dry. There was a glass of water by the bed on the table and he reached for it. He gulped it down in two and he placed the empty glass back down on the table.
“No offense, Mr. Novak, but we don't know each other that well,” Dean said, his eyes cautious, but his cheeks were flaming.
“I’d like to see you try.”
“You never told me.”
“Okay,” Dean whispered his reply.
The search for the boy continued for a couple of days more. Castiel didn't sleep on those days. He was constantly working hard with his men to locate. Whenever they thought they were close to him, he would get snatched away from them. It was like trying to catch a mist. He just hoped that they wouldn't be too late.
Lora knelt beside him with a cry of her own and she blindly started to shoot at them. They were firing at them also, of course, but Castiel was quick and precise in his shooting. There were at least 7 bodies on the ground by the time the two of them were done shooting.
Castiel pulled back and looked at all the blood on his hands. His face felt wet and he reached up to feel why; it was blood. “Fuck,” he whispered as he got up. He grunted at the sharp pain that he felt around his body. He forgot just how much it actually hurt to be hurt by others, and not in practice. “Fuck.”
“Yeah,” Charlie said, nodding again, her lower lip wobbling. Castiel’s heart clenched at that.
“In the woods?” Castiel asked, frowning. If she was found in the woods, that could only mean one thing. “Crowley, tell me what happened.”
“I don’t really know. I just wanted to go out and just walk around,” Dean said, as he looked around himself. He noticed some people looking at them, but they were just passing glances. Dean didn’t really notice how close they were walking together, when Mr. Novak’s hand brushed by his. He glanced down at his hand and looked up at Mr. Novak’s profile, and then looked forward.
“Done,” Castiel replied with a smile. Dean sat on his lap a bit more comfortably and Castiel hummed. “Did you need anything else?”
“I’m glad you’re here, Dean,” he said, and he actually did sound like he was glad for it.
She slumped down in his arms, not even a sound leaving her lips. “No,” he whispered, his eyes blurring. “No, no, no, no.”
“Yes, please, sir. Okay. Whatever you want,” Dean babbled out.
Castiel had apologized to her about all of this, but she gave him a stern look and told him to “pull yourself together, young man” and to concentrate on more important stuff. Castiel kissed her forehead and went back to the table.
was something that he enjoyed receiving very often. It was so easy to give up his control to her. So easy…
"Love, Dean."
Jessica was a beautiful lady. She had blonde hair, which was up into a messy bun on her head. She didn’t have any make up on, and her eyes looked tired, but it still didn’t stop her from being so pretty. Castiel could see why both of the Winchesters were so smitten by her. She had a nice smile that she flashed at Bobby the moment she saw him, and an even bigger one when she spotted Dean. She received their hugs and kisses, and spoke to them animatedly. Castiel hung back by the door, at a respective distance from the family.
“Mr. Winchester,” Lora straightened up and looked at him with a polite smile on her face. She was putting away dishes. Anna was making a cake.
He grabbed it and hauled it out. Lora tightened her hold in his hand. She was probably scared shitless from seeing so many weapons. He grabbed 3 ammunitions from there and slid back up and sat close to her.
“We attack.”
“One of my men should be here with clothes soon enough,” Castiel cut her off. She nodded and left the room. Minutes passed by, and then she came back in, and she had a purse in her hand.
“I’m sure he would have,” Castiel said, nodding. Even though his mind was another matter right now. If he had kept this a secret from Castiel, what else has he kept from him?
The image was… disturbing. Sam was tied up. Not in a compromising position. He wasn’t naked either. But it looked that the ropes were too tight on his skin and he looked worse for wear. His eyes were red rimmed, his face sweaty and red. He was beaten up and his clothes were a mess. There was blood everywhere.
“Hmm...” hummed Castiel as he looked at the numbers on the papers.
“You can’t… Dean, you can’t.”
Too soon, Castiel felt the soft sheets of his bed and he clung on to Dean’s shirt. “Don’t go,” he whispered frantically. “Please don’t go. I want you here. I need you here.”
Castiel pocketed the picture and nodded in thanks. He sighed and shook his head a bit. “Is that all?”
“Luckily for you, you’re not the one who gives out the orders here,” Castiel rebuked in a soft voice, just as Anna answered. Castiel requested something light, but something filling. She said that she’ll be up in ten.
“How much more do you need?” Castiel asked with a raised eyebrow.
“Please, just listen,” Charlie said, but Castiel couldn’t look at her. “He is not… He is making bad,
“Not mine. I don’t need this anymore,” Dean said. He was avoiding eye contact, staring somewhere around Castiel’s chest.
He held the pen close to Azazel’s eyes and noticed with satisfaction as Azazel’s eyes widened. “You can’t do this! Castiel! You can’t and won’t do this!”
Mr. Novak dragged his hands out of Dean’s jeans and started to take it off. Dean lifted his hips up to help him with the process. Next went his underwear… and then Dean was naked. Blindfolded, gagged, handcuffed to the bed; naked. Unable to move, or see, or utter a single word.
“I’m not supposed to know these things, because I wasn’t allowed in the office and in the meetings,” Dean said, but then he hesitated, before adding, “I wasn’t close to her in the way I was close to you.”
“Yeah.”
“Hey, girl,” he said to her. They pulled back and she smiled up at him.
“It’s pretty obvious isn’t it? Who was the one that didn’t argue with you when you told him to stay at the hospital and keep an eye on everything?”
Which, come to think of it, was taking forever to take care of. He, rather reluctantly, let his eyes fall down to see what’s up when his eyes widened. Mr. Novak not only undid his seatbelt, he was also undoing Dean’s belt. “Uhm… What are you doing?”
“Cas,” Dean said. And Castiel had never heard that voice before. Never heard it from Dean before. It was… This was something that Castiel had been waiting for, but at the same time, actually hearing it… Castiel took a steadying breath because he needed to compose himself. He owed this to Dean.
Castiel understood the minute Dean turned around and walked to him. The bathroom was dark, but the small amount of light coming from the bathroom’s window and the ajar door, provided a little bit of light for moving around and not bumping into things. This way, Dean could help Castiel to shower, without having the risk of exposing himself to Dean’s eyes.
. Which, come to think of it, Dean had already agreed to, but the feeling was at strongest when Mr. Novak looked at him like that. “I don’t think it’s your place to judge my kinks,” Mr. Novak said, sounding defensive.
Balthazar stood back up and walked to the rickety table on the side where he had placed a bowl of ice. He placed his knuckle inside it to cool his burning skin down, lest it started to bruise. The place that they took their victims was an abandoned building that used to be a factory back in the day. It was in a secluded place that gave them the freedom to be as loud as they wanted. The walls had seen better days and most of the windows had been broken due to vulgarism. And okay, some of them had been because of their gun shots, but in all honesty, it was a creepy place to be at. It had a great effect on their victims.
That one came to him in a heartbeat. He had to come up with a plan to attack Alastair. He needed to plan out more than just that. Diversion. Where to go first. How to approach this. Who and where to take out first.
“Hiya, Sammy,” Dean said gruffly and hugged him right back. It hasn’t been that long since they last saw each other, and there were the occasional video calls, but he realized that he had missed his brother terribly.
“Yes,” he replied with a nod and a serious expression. “Of course. Anything you want. However much you want.”
The cars started to drive as soon as Mr. Novak nodded at his driver. He wasn’t feeling nervous; he wasn’t feeling antsy. There was a sense of calmness that he didn’t know he was going to feel as he made his way to where Alastair was. He always thought that he was going to feel anger and hatred about this whole thing, but really, he was feeling calm. Maybe because it was just a dinner between them…?
As much as he didn't want to admit to himself as to why he was here, Dean needed some sort of a reassurance that all was okay, and that Castiel wasn't some creep that just came into his life out of nowhere. “I am going to have a meeting with someone that will help me out with my future plans.”
For the first time today, Dean saw amusement shining in Mr. Novak's eyes. “Stick around and you might.”
Dean chuckled at him and shook his head. “Enjoy the view, then,” he said as he made his way to the dance floor, where the bridesmaids cheered up when they saw him and dragged him into the middle of their small dancing group.
Why would Dean want to love him? He wasn’t anything special. He wasn’t anything. He was a killing machine and that’s it. That was it. He was just a mindless killing machine. And Dean, pure, simple, beautiful Dean wanted to love him. Wanted to prove to him that he was something worthy of having. He wasn’t. Why wouldn’t Dean just leave?
Badass Castiel up ahead though.
“I got you. We can take care of this. I swear, Cas. It’s gonna be okay.”
“Oooh, you sound so sweet, it’s actually breaking my nonexistent heart,” Alastair said, his voice mocking and full of sarcasm. “I actually have tears in my eyes.”
Castiel baked when he was restless. When he came home from the park, he mostly kept himself away from everyone, tucking himself with a good book in the library, in his favorite nook. It started to snow again and the house was warm. Castiel had sat there for hours before his stomach started to rumble with hunger, so he had to go to the kitchen and get something to eat.
Alastair chuckled and dipped the ginger a bit and Dean gasped out. It was set in a way that it was brushing up against his prostate. Figging was something that Dean never liked, but it was Alastair’s favorite form of torture. That, and yep. There it was. Dean pursed his lips together as another shock wave went through his body. He growled as Alastair walked to his front and quirked up an eyebrow.
If they were here to keep an eye on him, didn’t that mean that Mr. Novak was prying into his personal life, without getting Dean’s consent on the matter?
Castiel looked at Dean for a moment longer, before he sighed through his nose and let his body relax on bed. “What about me?”
And then Castiel froze. He stopped moving. His lips stopped moving. His eyes snapped open as he realized what was Dean doing.
