Steve came with Tony to set up before their gig that night, no one seemed to ask any questions. The band was performing at Sharky’s again, so Steve caught up with his co-worker, the girl with the coloured hair (Her name was Alice), catching glimpses of Tony on the drums and talking with his friends, grinning so big they all looked at each other wondering what was wrong with him.
Because that was the first time he’d felt alive in years.
It was fine. It was always fine. He was used to being alone anyway.
“I just like watching you - not, like, you’re good at... Drumming.”
Steve looked at him like he’d said something appalling, although he didn’t mean to. “No? It’s an achievement, right? Like if you won a spelling bee... Or something, I don’t know.”
“Ty isn’t invited.” Bucky repeated as he flipped a page of the book he was reading, something big and wordy for his Philosophy class that Steve had minimal interest in.
She gave him a curious look. “Trying not to make the same mistakes with someone else?”
“I’m not all that interesting.”
“Aaaaand you met Ty.”
Like he usually would, wide, taking up the whole room, bright, and beautiful.
“Hey, that better be water brewski, I’m not hurlin’ you outta here like last time!” Bucky clicked his tongue into a smile back at Steve.
Just like that, that was it.
“Why? Are you dating? Is it a secret? Are they not out yet? Oh, does he have a boyfriend? Or a girlfriend? Or both? Wa-“
It only got worse when he got closer to the door, unrelenting hard slaps and an oppressive
“Was that meant to be a good line? Or a burn? I hope not.”
They did improv in drama class every Wednesday for a whole semester and not to brag but Steves performance was...
“Huh?”
Maybe they didn’t care if other people were uncomfortable, maybe most of their friends weren’t because they were used to it, but Ty and Tony needed a serious lesson PDA - once again it was as if Steve weren’t even there, he was invisible, had wrangled Tony into his arms like he didn’t want him to know that anyone else existed in the universe but him.
“Oh boo hoo Steve. Look I know you’re riding with money bags over there,
“I don’t think there’s any point trying to look sophisticated if you’re drinking out of a paper cup. But okay, sure.”
“Yeah I have enough money. Yeah, I’m eating enough. Mom, I’m 18, I think I know basic survival skills by now…”
“What is it like?” Bucky asked out of nowhere as he opened his beer across a table from Steve. They must’ve moved the dining room table into the kitchen prior to the party, crowding it with ice buckets of beer, a punch bowl and many, many bowls of chips. His tone resembled a very curious child.
“Byeeeee. Thank youuuuuu.”
“Tony. What do you want?”
“Tony?!” Bucky announced to every garbage can and rat in the alleyway. “I- I didn’t even think you too were close, let alone…”
cool he wouldn’t need instructions.
“I’ve never been unsure of anything before. I miss that control, having control over how I feel. It was comforting.”
Thor grunted. “He will not remain still!” He spun around, sweeping a leg and taking Bucky’s legs out from under him. He grinned in satisfaction, offering Bucky a hand up. “You are an excellent warrior, friend Bucky.”
It made Steve think of Tony leaning over to him during one of the many endless post assignment debriefings and whispering, “Which eyebrow do you think is the most dangerous? The left or the right?” Steve had spluttered out a laugh that he’d tried to disguise as a cough, but Natasha’s cool gaze pinned him. She knew. “The left,” Tony had decided. “Definitely the left.”
Tony narrowed his eyes at him. “I locked that.”
Tony blinked and then narrowed his eyes at Clint. Just who were these guys? Google had clearly failed him.
“She didn’t say anything once I shot her husband.” Bucky looked down at his hands. “She spat at me.”
“Those. Are. Ours.” Dean replied.
“I’m afraid Mr. Stark has given instructions that I’m not to let you in, Captain Rogers.” F.R.I.D.A.Y.’s calm voice infuriated him.
Steve turned his gaze back to Thor. Tony was right, they needed to be ready. Whatever was happening in Asgard tended to spill over to Earth at some point.
“This isn’t right,” Tony said, swallowing hard over the giant baseball that seemed lodged in his throat. “This is just not right.”
“I kept secrets from everyone, Tony,” Steve said.
Natasha shrugged. “I signed the first draft of the Accords. I expect that Tony has put extra protection in for us in the revision. I’ll sign that as well.”
“When was he supposed to tell you his plans?” Natasha rolled her shoulders. “When you ran after Bucky the moment he escaped? Or when you deserted Rhodes in a heap on an airport runway? Or when you caved in the Iron Man suit and left Tony to find a way out of Siberia alone and incapacitated?” She was merciless in her questions.
“Do what?” Loki asked, all innocent evil. Steve didn’t trust the dickhead as far as he could throw him. And he could throw him helluva far.
Pepper rubbed at her eyes. “You are a constant trial, Anthony Edward Stark.” Her shoulders slumped. “Dammit.”
It's been two years. OMG. I am
Steve shook his head. “You’re so smart and help so many people. How the fuck do you not see who the real Tony Stark is?” He met Sam’s gaze. “He’s Earth’s best defender. He’s laid on the wire more times than you know.”
“No you don’t,” Pepper said. “I asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. to send it back to the mansion.” One high-heeled stiletto tapped on the tiles. “Will I hear any more arguments from you?”
Bucky nudged him. “Told you we’re the same.” His mouth tilted a little.
Clint looked back over his shoulder from the controls. “I mean how much trouble is Tony in?”
Even if it made him feel like screaming.
“I put him down first,” Bucky said. “He promised me money, a new arm, a chance to start again. He recognized me. I wasn’t wearing the mask yet.”
Coulson nodded. “I’m not going to ask,” he said. “It’s better that I don’t know.” He looked at Tony carefully. “Who else knows?”
fine, Tony!”
okay.”
“I’m glad you approve,” Steve muttered into his skin. “I’m not going to be able to stop. I don't
“Of course.” Thor gathered Steve’s body in his arms and stood. “Heimdall.” Tony watched as the brightly lit column of the Bifröst punched down through the skies.
“Stick around, Winchester,” Bucky said. “When Banner and Tony get their geek on, it’s a whole other level of what the fuck.”
“If we get out of here, it’s on,” Tony agreed. He kept his eyes peeled, but there was no movement in the trees, not a leaf or branch shifted. Not even the ground beneath them crackled under their feet. “I seriously don’t like this place,” he told Dean.
“Everything,” Bucky said into the nape of Tony’s neck. “You’re both everything.”
“Then what was it?” Rhodey demanded. He was flying on his own steam, but the comms kept him in contact with the team.
“Well, that’s not frightening at all,” Bruce said, tone desert dry. “Why are we doing this again?”
“Thank you for getting us home,” Steve said, ignoring the hostile words. “Thank you for giving us a home to come back to.”
“We will never defeat Thanos if he gets all of the stones.” Strange didn’t mince words. “As long as one of the stones is destroyed and I have the Time Stone, he can do nothing more.”
Bucky huffed out an irritated breath. “Steve and I want to get Tony alone so we can say hello properly.” He waited while the information sank in.
Laura shrugged. “I first have to decide if you’re worth taking back.” She walked out of the kitchen, stopping at the door. “Follow me.”
“Tony?” Yup, Steve Rogers was still standing in front of him, blue eyes fixed to his face.
She disappeared a second later.
Steve grinned. “Like this?” A third finger made Tony feel like he was going to split apart. In the best possible way.
“We wouldn't do that,” Steve assured her. “It came up already and we dismissed it.” He kept his voice steady and his eyes on her. She was still so volatile, so young, so powerful.
“Really? You’d help me too?” Peter’s eyes got even bigger. “That would be so awesome!”
Bucky patted his shoulder. “You wanted Stark,” he reminded Steve. “Don’t be surprised that your life is a circus.”
“Thinking again,” Bucky complained as he lifted his head. “Stop.”
“This one isn’t mine to tell,” Tony said. “I’ll talk to you later.” He ended the call abruptly.
He watched the flowers drift away, Tony’s arc reactor its centre point. Everyone had tears in their eyes. Steve didn’t have any more tears to cry.
Steve’s first thought was Bruce. The Hulk never responded well to threats, whether perceived as direct or indirect. He spun to look over to where Bruce had been. Natasha was sprawled over him, hands on his face and kissing him.
She nodded. “I talked to Clint this morning.”
Steve frowned at him. Thor was a pretty happy-go-lucky guy despite the fact that his entire race had been destroyed by the Wraith. As long as he had enemies to kill, food to eat and booze to drink, Thor had no issues.
It was, of course, entirely apparent what they had been doing, what with the red lips, rapid breathing and misshapen pants.
“Yeah.” Tony rubbed the back of his neck. “I’m really going to have to think of another acronym.” He grinned at Bruce. “We need to get on that.”
He’d never felt more ashamed.
“Yeah, that’s not exactly encouraging us to trust you,” Clint said, sending a sour look Loki’s way.
“Hey!” Tony propped his fists on his hips and glared. “My home is a thing of fucking beauty!”
Steve paused while putting a piece of bacon in his mouth. “Shit.” He wanted to race back down to the lab.
“Wait!” He panicked, trying to stop her from patching Steve through. He wasn’t ready for
Laura made a skeptical sound. “He’s not on my Christmas card list yet,” she said. “We’ll see.”
“What does he call himself?” Bucky asked Steve. “Genius?” He slid laughing eyes over Tony’s astounded face. “You look pretty stupid right now, genius. Close your mouth.”
Jörmungandr stared at him. “
Pepper was wheezing with laughter. “Your face.”
“I can help with that,” Natasha said. “I know exactly what Tony stocks in his bar.”  Rhodey gave her grateful eyes. She just laughed as she headed to the bar. “Anyone else for something while I’m up here?” Several of them put their hands up.
“Indeed he did, Sir. And something that I have observed about the Captain over the years he has been in residence here at the Tower, he does nothing without purpose.” JARVIS knew exactly how to deliver that one-two punch to the gut that rendered Tony defenseless.
“You okay, buddy?” Rhodey’s voice was softer now, eyes very worried. “You haven’t had one of those for a long time.”
“Perhaps I used the incorrect expression,” Peggy said with a frown. “I meant that your physical heart cannot function any longer due to the poison from the Jotun shape-shifter. I can make some repairs that will keep you alive and with our captain, if you wish?”
Steve couldn’t breathe. “Are you…do you….will….?” He couldn’t seem to form the words.
Tony tinkered for a while after he’d sent Steve and Bucky away. Bruce worked quietly alongside him, almost telepathically knowing what he needed before he asked for it.
“Yeah,” Tony said. “It may not seem like it right now, but I swear to god, Pep, you’ll be happier without me.”
He was asleep between one breath and the next.
“Yeah, that doesn’t sound good,” Rhodey said. “I’m guessing that’s why he’s creating this army of followers here.”
T’Challa sighed. “It is beyond much of our expertise,” he admitted. “It would help if we could access the files that Zemo and Zola kept on him.”
Tony pressed a gloved finger to the fading ring of bruises on Steve’s neck. “Sure you don’t.”
“He is the greatest magician in the world.” Natasha moved to Clint’s side. “And in the past, he hasn’t exactly been the most trustworthy person.”
Bucky stood at Tony’s back. “Whatever you’re freaking the fuck out about, I bet what I’m seeing tops it,” he yelled.
He chuckled while Fury was led around the dance floor by a beaming Hill. That way lay nightmares for sure.
Thor hugged him. “We shall search high and low, over land and sea to search out a cure for our friend,” he vowed.
“I can open the door,” Thor said. “I think that we should keep your large green friend leashed until we really need him.” He lifted Mjolnir and smashed the door to smithereens.
Tony chuckled. “You are probably right,” he admitted. He suddenly felt a whole lot lighter. “You know, in the future, you and I are best buds.”
“You okay there, sir?” Tony looked over at the President, faceplate slipping up. The nod he got in reply wasn’t exactly a ringing affirmation.
Tony pointed a finger at her. “I will get you, my pretty.” She grinned, clearly terrified.
“Indeed there was, boss.” Perky needed reprogramming Tony thought viciously. “Or he’d tell Mrs. B about that time with the eggs and the fireworks and you know that would get back to Mr. B.”
eventually anyway. “Only Bruce.”
“Why, your Majesty, that was almost kind.” Tony’s reply was met with a flat look.
Steve slouched on the sofa in the corner of the workshop, ignoring DUM-E's attempts to foist a no-doubt poisonous glass of what-the-fuck-ever on him. He looked edible. It was completely unfair. “Hi there,” Steve said. “Thought I'd better bring you something to eat.”
Rhodes followed Natasha, carefully closing the door behind him. “Tony asked me to take you all back to the mansion.” He didn’t appear too happy about it. “I wanted Vision to do it but he has to bring Bruce back and well…” He turned, heading for the roof where they’d left the jet. Steve winced every time he heard the soft swish-snick of the hydraulic braces.
“We have returned!” Thor's voice arrived before he did. It was one of his less endearing qualities.
He paused at the open doorway to the living room, taking a moment to scan the room.
“Maybe.” Tony folded his arms across his chest. Dignity while hunched under a workbench was hard to achieve.
Tony hedged.
“It’s a job, Stevie.” Bucky patted Steve’s cheek. “I’m a big boy.”
Tony beamed at him. “We’re going to space!”
Steve stepped between them. It was clearly brewing up to a fight. “And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us,” he pointed out.
Tony hooted a laugh. “That’s why you’re my favorite, Thorpedo!”
Wanda stayed seated, gaze curiously remote as she stared between Steve and the television.
Liar, Tony thought again. “No, you don’t.”
“Sounds hopeful,” Tony mused. “I guess it’s the end of all things right now as Armageddon has already happened. It’s not like lightning will strike us if we don’t stick to our promises.” He held out a hand. “I need you to haul me back if I go too far,” he said, voice serious. “My brain sometimes works faster than my mouth and I say things I don’t mean.”
going to have to role-play the Soldier and the Prisoner one day.”
Sam’s dimples flashed briefly. “Been trying all my life,” he admitted. “Not the best track record for either of us.”
Natasha kicked him in the shin. “Dumbass,” she told him again, and the fond smile told them all that she meant it.
“This is most disturbing,” Thor declared, jostling Loki from his slouch against his shoulder. “It explains so much of your unfortunate history.”
“Shurrup,” Bucky mumbled into Tony’s neck. “Sleeping.”
Tony looked over at Bruce. “Did you crack the chaotic inflation code?”
Bucky sighed. “Dean said he was a dick. Didn’t warn us enough.”
All very mature
Pepper waved to him, grinning as Happy bulldozed his way through the dancers, all effort and no execution.
There was a brief pause and Steve knew that it was because she was debating on whether to tell him or not. “Dr. Banner is in the communal kitchen,” she said eventually. “He puts the coffee on for the boss, and has tea before his day starts.”
Xavier waved a hand. “I’d prefer not to rummage around in his head,” he admitted. “It is very tiring on someone who is intent on keeping me out.”
“On my mark,” Tony said as the inside of Ultron’s flying bomb lit up. “Now!” he yelled as he blasted the core with everything he had, and the world went white with lightning.
Tony pulled away from Steve, making it clear to Pepper that he was doing so under great sufferance. “You are a horrible human being,” he told her.
Steve looked wary. As well he should. “Bet about what?”
Tony watched the monitor. He’d been called back about two hours ago. He jiggled his leg impatiently, wanting to burst into the chamber and demand a response. It had been two damn days already. He wanted this done.
Steve wasn’t coping well. Somehow, Bruce had figured out an antidote to the venom from Matilda. But something had gone wrong. The Tony that had opened his eyes in the infirmary after a week in the stasis pod wasn’t the Tony that they all knew. The Tony that
Steve wrapped an arm around Tony, pulling him in tightly. “We bring out the best in each other, love.” He watched Tony duck his head at the endearment he secretly loved. “You’re too reckless, I’m too careful. You’re brain smart, I’m people smart.” He ignored Tony’s indignant snort. “I may be the head of the team, but you, Tony, you’re the heart. If anything ever happened to you, I don’t think we’d survive.”
“I don’t need someone to make me happy,” Tony mumbled.
“Ah, so they've sent the metal man to negotiate with me.” Loki's voice was like silk. “How lovely.”
“Like fungus on a tree,” Coulson said, but he smiled. “Now, how about you stop hiding away and go up and apologize to the friends who have no idea what you had a conniption about.”
“There appears to be a large animal...person...thing heading towards us, sir. Really quickly.” F.R.I.D.A.Y. sounded a little shaken. As shaken as an AI could sound. Which was apparently quite a lot if you were built by the genius known as Tony Sta....
“Nope!” Tony skipped away from his reach. “I don’t. I hate you with the fire of a thousand su…mmmf.”
Tony sighed. “I was dragged away from my
Bucky cupped Tony’s face in his hands. “You need to feel more,” he said, pressing his lips to Tony’s. His mouth tasted of toothpaste and something else, something sweet that Tony wanted to bottle and keep forever.
Tony gave a startled laugh. “And Clint says that
“Why don’t I just take you to him?” Strange sat on the huge table, legs folded like some uber guru. Steve
“Tony.” Steve’s voice was a rasp in his ear. “You’re so fucking gorgeous like this.” He reached down to Tony’s cock, pushing Bucky’s fingers away. Bucky glared up at Steve for a moment and then shrugged. He continued fucking into Tony with his finger and his tongue, stripping him of every illusion of restraint.
Pepper married Happy. Steve had a moment of regret, for taking Tony from her. But then he thought of what she, a human, had been through, and rationalized that he’d made the right choices. Happy was safe. And he wasn’t Tony.
“So did you,” Steve insisted, his thumb rubbing a lazy pattern on Tony’s cheek.
“Shut up, Stark,” she told him, mouth curving. “Your ego doesn't need any more stroking.”
*throws hands up in the air*
Tony turned to look at him. “You, right here, right now, were exactly what I needed, Bucky.” He gave in then and reached for Bucky’s hand. “Thank you.”
“I’m not doing this for you,” Billie said, eyes flashing. “Lucifer can’t be allowed to get out again.”
Mama’s lived up to the hype as usual, and they stumbled into the tower about an hour later, sated and sleepy.
Tony sighed. “I need to ask him about someone,” he said. “And that’s all I’m going to say about it.”
“Bucky is fine,” Bucky said. He looked over at Tony. “You sure you’re okay with this?”
And there was that little matter of time travel. He wasn’t supposed to be here. He’d been dropped into a life that wasn’t truly his own, that he didn’t deserve to claim as his own. Even if that previous life, where he’d been responsible for the death of one of his best friends, faded with every breath.
Tony started laughing. “These two are going to fit in just fine,” he told Clint.
“I won’t be a coward,” Tony told him, his mouth tasting like dust and ash. “We owe him to watch his end as much as we brought about his beginning.”
“Tony’s had a heart attack.” Pepper didn’t bother with mincing words. “F.RI.D.A.Y. grabbed him, bundled him into an Iron Man suit and took him to the nearest hospital. Vision took Bruce with him, following the suit, but we need something a little faster than Tony’s Bugatti.”
He watched the muscle take up a position on either side of the door. Clearly covering the exits.
He was going to die tonight, but it was a helluva way to go.
“Oh fuck you very much.” Tony glared at him. The gleam in Vision’s eyes had him pause. “Oh lord. He’s discovered his funny bone.”
Bucky curled on his side and leaned in to kiss Tony. “Hi.”
“Tony?” Stane frowned, trying to peer around the width of Steve’s shoulders.
Scott shook Sam’s hand. “That’s for the adventure, man.”
“It will hurt.” Loki looked almost apologetically at Vision. “It’s basically removing a limb.”
Thor nodded. “I thank you, Steve. But it means that I am, for now, banished from Asgard while Loki pretends to be king.” His mouth twisted. “It concerns me much that the rest of my brethren have not uncovered his mischief as yet.”
They all stared at him. “Agent?” Tony said.
“You’re a dumbass,” Natasha informed him.
“To be fair, Pep, I didn’t exactly try all that hard to get through to them. Maybe that was my fault.” Tony had no idea why he was defending them.
Tony refused to admit the thrill, hearing Bucky call his house home, gave him. He straightened up and barely controlled his jump when Bucky dropped his head onto his shoulder. Bucky was out a second later. It was half terrifying, half gratifying to have this trust from him.
“Thank fuck,” Tony groaned. “Only you would make a big deal out of tying a bow tie, Rogers.”
~~~O~~~~
“Not without me, you’re not,” Tony said. Steve’s eyes narrowed and Tony narrowed his own back. “Don’t even fucking try it, Capuchin.”
“You don’t swing that way, my dearest heart, or has something changed?’ Tony fluttered his eyelashes at Rhodey while he tugged at the hydraulic lock that held the braces together.
Tony desperately wanted to ask more questions, but he could feel Uatu’s presence retreating.
He could hear Tony breathing hard as the AI opened the channel. “Stark! Colonel! Can you both please stop this juvenile crap right now!” Steve hated losing his temper, but it honestly felt like he was dealing with a bunch of kindergartners.
“How come he didn’t get you then?” Bruce asked. “I mean, if Lucifer got Sam?”
Bucky kept looking towards the elevators. Steve knew what he wanted to do. “We need to let them get on with their work,” Steve told him. “No distractions.”
Tony smiled softly.
Tony suddenly found that his vocal chords were working again. “As you can see, I am
miss you, Tony.” Steve agreed, and didn’t that make his heart give a stupid little giddy leap?
“Perhaps you would care to see my quarters in this fine establishment, brother?” Thor looked like a giant puppy hoping for approval, Steve thought.
“Thank you, Mr. Stark.” She grinned back at him. “I live for your compliments.”
Almost as much as the leopard print onsie that Steve had given him last year.
“Now, Not Moose, is that any way to talk about your former boss?” Crowley purred.
Not quite the Stony meeting yet....I'm not entirely sure I'm happy with this but eh....
Tony hummed.
Steve smirked down at him. “Good.” He bent down and kissed Tony, kept it soft and slow, the small moans at the back of Tony’s throat going straight to his dick.
“You’re doing a great job,” Steve reassured him.
Bucky discovers them kissing. Awkward! And then a surprising confession. Tony has a heart to heart. The Avengers assemble for one of their own.
I did.”
Bucky & Tony talk about stuff. yeah. that's it.
Steve was still, suddenly serious. “This isn’t a game,” he said. “It’s not something I take lightly.”
Tony made flailing hands at him, dislodging those lovely, big, warm hands from his shoulders. “Exactly!” He poked a finger in Steve’s rather firm chest. “And not once has there ever been any indication that you are interested in men, let alone
“Uh in English please?” Sam raised his hand.
Steve watched Bucky’s face soften as he looked at Tony.
Scott ran back in. “Come
He blew out a breath. “I perfected it all before the shit hit the fan. Got my goodbye. It didn’t change anything. What happened, happened and I never saw them again.” This confession session was getting maudlin and Tony shook himself. “So, I decided that the technology could be adjusted and used to help people like me.” He glanced at Bruce. “Like Bruce.”
Steve sighed. “I’m sorry, Tony. I should have been there for you?”
Tony sent a suspicious glance Loki’s way. “Not my doing. At least, not this time,” Loki said, holding his hands up.
Tony groaned as he lifted his head to look at Bucky. “Tha’ you can’t get shitfached,” Tony said, patting Bucky’s stomach. It was a very firm stomach. Tony patted it again. “Your shtomach ish firm,” he announced.
Bucky let Bruce shine the light into his eyes. “I still haven’t met him,” he said.
Bucky’s face turned murderous. “You don’t get to ask me crap like that,” he snarled.
Sam’s eyes slid to his brother and Tony saw the fondness in his gaze. “Dean was determined not to keep you waiting.”
“Think of what I've done,” Bucky said. “Who I've been.” He laughed and it sounded like glass scraping in his throat. “I’m not even sure how long I've been awake. I can’t remember all of the awful things I’ve done. The internet isn’t a happy place for me.” He walked to the edge of the wall, looking down. “I'm terrified that those memories are also in here, waiting to leap out at me.” He tapped his head.
Pepper and Laura didn’t smile back. “What are you doing, Tony?” Pepper asked.
“What’s happening in Asgard now?” Steve asked. He watched Loki even though he was asking Thor. Again, the almost imperceptible flinch spoke volumes.
...?”
Tony narrowed his gaze. Well, that was just a red flag to a bull, wasn’t it? Time to bring out the big guns. “Bucky Barnes turned up at my place two weeks ago.”
“Oh, fuck that shit!” Tony yelled. “You’re not a thing. You have thoughts, feelings, emotions. You’re more human than many actual flesh and blood people I know!”
Steve dropped back down to the floor, holding his pounding head together with his shaking hands. His team was a mess, he was disgustingly hung-over and his best friend slash boyfriend was off saving the universe.
Rhodes patted his shoulder. “Then we’ll be okay,” he said with a smirk. “Good talk, Captain.”
“So do you.” It wasn’t a question either.
“I like people,” Steve corrected. “The skin they are in doesn’t matter."
Tony thought about that for a second. “You’re probably right,” he admitted. “I’d settle for the father of the bride.” He beamed at Steve.
Steve’s eyes flew open, only to see Bucky looking up at the camera in the road before riding away. “Yeah,” he grated, “That’s Buck.”
Steve glared at him. “I would think it would be from Odin, as he is the giver!”
Steve immediately spotted the difference in War Machine’s gait.
“Hey.” Natasha's face gave nothing away. Steve readied himself for bloodshed.
“Is there any reason that you didn’t get rid of all my Dolce and Gabana suits? I distinctly remember asking for that about a year back.” He hadn’t been at the Malibu home in a while it seemed.
“I’d support Steve, no matter what the politicians wanted.” He knew he was sleeping now. Knew that he was talking to someone while he was sleeping.
“Nope, nope, all of the nope forever.” Tony shook his head, trying to bleach his disgusting brain.
“Radiation.” Bruce did a fine impersonation of a desert. “You irradiated a …what?”
“I have left him in your living area,” she said, turning and leaving as abruptly as she’d arrived.
“Atlantis has indicated that you are not all that you seem,” Pepper said, giving the book to Steve. “That there is more to you than meets the eye.”
“Oh, I’ll take that bet and double it, Barnes,” Tony said as he blasted the nightmare. “Mine has ten legs.”
“How about you let me be the judge?” Rhodey asked, every inch the military man he was.
Bruce came out with two pots of coffee, with a scowling Natasha and Wanda carrying coffee mugs and sugar. “If Tony hasn’t managed to do it yet, then it’s too late.”
“Does he believe it will work?” Steve rasped, trying to get his mind around this
Rhodey hastily hid a chuckle in his fist behind him as the General Assembly stared at him in confusion.
“We’re not friends, Rogers,” Tony said with a sigh. “Not anymore. We’re colleagues. I’m going to fix your frosty buddy over there and then maybe we can work out a way to be a team again.”
to be trusted.”
“What the fuck do you want, Winchester?” The snarl from behind him had Tony spinning. The woman glaring at Dean was gorgeous in a very Natasha way. She looked like she could eviscerate you with her mind.
“J, tell Captain Nanny, that I am a goddamn genius, and am fully capable of winning this fucking fight!” Tony glowered at Steve; the effect somewhat weakened by the dark bruise flaring up on his cheekbone.
looked at him. “I rather think you would,” he mused. “Well, you’d
Steve found his voice then. “What was it?” Wanda turned those strange eyes on him. “What was he afraid of?”
“Not possible,” Tony said.
“Mr. Stark and Sergeant Barnes have been talking.” The AI seemed hesitant.
He stopped. “F.R.I.D.A.Y.”
“Actual hate,” Rhodey assured him.
The guy who followed Clint was tall. Like Thor tall. Tony did a quick scan, taking in watchful eyes, shaggy hair and legs that didn’t quit. The second guy was shorter, but not by much. He was also almost ridiculously gorgeous. Steve Rogers levels of gorgeous. Tony didn’t know what it said about him that all his ideals of beauty were somehow on the various faces and bodies of his teammates.
“Well, that sounds perfectly wonderful,” Bruce drawled. “We have to save the world.”
Lee shook his head. “Apart from some food and beer, no, sir.”
“No.” Steve’s voice was hoarse. “No, Buck, he wasn’t.”
Tony was apparently offended that none of them approved of his awesome plan. They all had identical expressions on their faces. It would have been funny, Steve thought if it wasn’t the actual end of the world.
Tony shrugged. “I guess they were a possible reality,” he admitted. “We didn’t really talk about that too much.” He was getting uncomfortable again, wanting to run for his workshop and not come out.
Since Steve had moved out and into the new Avengers HQ.
“Yeah, Buck?” He tried not to breathe the words into Bucky's skin. He’d been rejected. He respected that.
“Friend Furious, you must feast with us and celebrate our victory,” Thor announced, clapping Fury hard enough on his shoulder that he stumbled a few steps forward.
“That went well,” Tony said.
Tony shrugged, slumping a little more against Rhodey. “Wasn’t sure it would happen,” he confessed. “Our giant avocado tends to avoid people when there’s no need for avenging.”
Steve turned to look at Bucky when the doors closed behind them. “I lost you seventy plus years ago, Buck.” He needed for Bucky to understand. “And then again in Washington. I’m not prepared to let anything more happen to you.”
“So, you got a god to pluck us from Hell and transport us somewhere and desert our friends in the bowels of Purgatory?” Put like that, Tony could understand a little of Steve’s anger. He decided that silence was the better part of valor in this case.
hated his life sometimes. “Sure,” he said, shaking his head. “It’s not like it isn’t true.”
Tony wasn’t used to blind obedience, but he was so far out of his own element right now that he obeyed Dean without question, the suit flowing over his skin in an instantly comforting shield from whatever the hell it was approaching.
“Is that true?” Steve asked when Tony stayed silent.
Tony was sure that he was hearing things. Had Steve Rogers, Captain Tightass himself, just come out and told him that he wanted to be Tony’s boyfriend?
“Bruce said you wanted to talk,” Rhodes said, pouring himself a cup of coffee.
“They are in Mr. Stark’s laboratory, Captain Rogers.” Tony’s AI was either a mind-reader or he was really obvious in his panic.
Tony shoved his pants and boxers down, stepping out of them and into the shower. “Nope,” he declared and then nearly brained himself on the shower control column. Only Bucky’s arm flashing out to grab him prevented another concussion. He looked at Bucky with a grin. “Thanksh.”
“You mentioned Norse mythology.” Steve ignored everyone else and focused on Thor. “Why?”
Tony sipped slowly on the single shot of whiskey that Steve had allowed him. He wasn’t sulking. He listened to the conversations washing over him; mind on the equations on his screen several floors below.
Tony thought about it. “You’re right,” he acknowledged.
There was a pause. “That’s…surprisingly mature, Tone. I didn’t expect that from you.” Rhodey sounded surprised.
?” He sounded incredulous.
“Haha! Yeah!” Tony punched the air. “What? Wait! What?” He stared at Rhodey. “Seriously, Rhodes. What?” Steve refused to meet his gaze and Bucky went an interesting shade of pink.
And they lived (mostly) happily ever after.
Tony shook his head. “You’re still mad at me two years later, Buttercup. It’s important.”
“No sex on furniture that any of us may use,” Clint said.
“Oh it most definitely did!”  Tony was indignant. “That piece of Hydra crap had to go with the wind.”
Tony kept his arms around Bucky as Clint landed the jet. One hand was still holding onto Steve. It felt slightly surreal and completely natural.
Steve nodded. “That explains where Wanda went.” Tony tried hard not to think about what that meant.
“Boss?” Steve frowned. “That doesn’t make any sense.”
“So when I passed out?” Bucky asked, focused on the information at hand. He was clearly trying not to freak out. It showed in the trembling of his hands.
Everyone turned to stare at him.
Tony nodded. “I get that, I do.” He sighed. “Just remember that Bucky was brainwashed. So is Rumlow. You’ve known him longer than I have and he was a good man.”
He scowled at the gauntlet in his hand, frustrated with the lack of technology that was so freely available two years into the future.
“Well crap,” Tony said, spinning around. “I hated that when Loki did it, I hate it even more now.”
Bruce just stared at him.
“And how did you respond, brother? What did you do?” Thor whispered the questions, his eyes dark with sorrow.
He shook his head. “Your mouth on my cock will do very nicely thank you, Sergeant Barnes.” Tony paused. “We are
Tony couldn’t take his eyes off the center of Vision’s forehead where the Mind Stone shone gold and bright. Loki frowned, muttered something under his breath. The room shook. Vision screamed, falling to his knees as his forehead bulged.
“That fucking wily asshole,” Clint said admiringly. “He just flipped the game on everyone.”
“I don’t think we should do this.” Tony’s cock actually whimpered at his own words. But Tony was trying to be a better person here, to take his time and not jump into things. Not that he had impulse control issues or anything.
“And?” Sam wasn't any kind of help. He was another asshole to add to the stable of assholes that made up the Avengers Initiative.
“She’s a kid. Ross trussed her up in a shock collar and straitjacket that would have taken her about a second to break out of. And she didn’t.”
So we're at Infinity War - some of the dialogue has been attributed to different characters because reasons.
It wasn't his finest moment. Not quite the dramatic exit he'd invisaged.
And then it stopped.
“What did you do to him?” Steve turned his head at Natasha’s venomous hiss. She was glaring at Wanda as though she could drag answers out of her with her mind.
“Rhodey’s being mean to me, Pep.” Tony wasn’t above cheating. “Plus, he’s just confessed his love for you and we decided to work out who gets you by settling it like men.”
“You should maybe read that?” Steve suggested. His smile was indulgent though.
The door to his suite slid open a minute later, and Steve rushed in, with Bucky at his heels. “Tony!” Steve dropped to his knees beside him. “F.R.I.D.A.Y. said that you were acting weird and that you said I was dead?”
“Always,” Bucky whispered. “Punk.”
Tony pulled out a tablet and started with some calculations. “Vision, can you…?”
“Laura.” Clint held the phone up to show her. “He’s got her number in this phone.”
“I was a cocky little shit before the serum,” Steve confessed. “My mouth got me in trouble a lot. Buck had to rescue me too many times.”
Laura stuck her tongue out at him and patted Steve’s arm on the way out. “Ooh,” she crooned. “Firm. I see why he wants to keep you.”
Tony sighed and plopped down into the waiting wheelchair, trying to hide the momentary grimace of pain. “Fine.” He gave a jaunty salute to NurseZilla and pointed at the door. “Right, Potts. Mush!”
Her eyes narrowed. “Maybe we’ll all get lucky and you’ll die down there. Then nobody has to make an effort.”
Bucky just glared at him. It was pretty effective. Clearly the evil eye was all part of the army boy makeup, Tony thought. Steve did that really well too.
“They’re cancelled,” Tony announced, putting his drink down. “You up for being my new best friend?”
“Well, that went a little better than expected,” Sam said.
“I’m going to spend the rest of my life showing him.” Tony sounded determined now. He turned then, draping his arms over Steve’s shoulders. “Just like I’m going to show you.” He leaned up to kiss Steve. It was a thing of purity. A touch of innocence. It tore something open in Steve.
He leaned his forehead against the glass. “God, Steve. What do I say to them? How do I get through this? How do we do this without you?”
Steve frowned down at Tony who was waving Bruce away with an impatient hand. “Something bit him,” he said with a sigh.
He looked back at Pepper. “If I don’t find an answer, what then?” he asked.
“And?” Tony grinned back at him.
“I’m giving you a solemn oath, nothing, only death, will prevent me from letting you down again.” Steve straightened, at full height. “You’ve been the most important person in my life since I woke up in this crazy world, and I will never forget it.”
how you do it.”
“You took your time getting back to him though.” Sam wasn’t shy about pointing out Steve’s shortcomings.
Tony looked at the crown. “Demon?” he squeaked. “We have absolutely zero knowledge of how to deal with a demon.”
“What’s his angle?” Bucky asked, echoing Steve thoughts as he sat beside. The cryogenic chamber had been destroyed by Wanda’s magic so there was no other option other than keeping an eye on Bucky. Steve had been ‘volunteered’ for the job.
“In our day, boys liking boys meant jail time,” Bucky explained. “It meant Auschwitz if you lived in Germany.”
he called.
“Uh, one,” Tony said. The lights came on suddenly and they turned in circles, looking at the slaughter in front of them. Tony didn’t miss the miniscule flinch as Barnes walked past a couple of the pods where bodies lay with bullet holes punched through the glass into their foreheads.
“You have
“But I’m comfortable,” Bucky said, a put-on whine in his voice.
He hadn't wanted, or needed it, but Dean Winchester had merely shrugged and told him he'd scrap it if nobody bought it. Tony couldn't let that happen. This baby had been too well-loved to desert in her hour of need.
“How do you propose to do this, Dr. Stark?” the American representative leaned forward. “You, yourself have said that he’s been brain-washed for so long.”
Tony frowned. “Why?” he asked. “There’s not much out there.” He glared at Steve. “In fact, I think it may make you feel even worse about what happened.”
Wanda’s face had grown increasingly worried. “Please, do not blame Vision. I was the one who…” Vision’s gentle hand on hers shut her up.
Bucky nodded, his gaze considering as he stared down at Tony. “When the fear gets too much, I try to find a way to release it,” he said, apropos of nothing.
. No-one is fucking flying anywhere alone. Understood?” Steve pointed at the jet.
Steve propped his fists on his hips. “Are you aware that you’ve been down here for over eight hours straight?” Tony had flashbacks to before, when Steve had bitched at him for working too long. It made something warm and fuzzy ooze up in his chest.
and not on the line.
Tony ran a hand through his hair. “I’ve been a terrible boyfriend.” He frowned. “That sounds so high school.”
“It means they’re discussing it with Tony,” Natasha explained. “It means that there’s a chance the ratified Accords may make it through.”
“I would probably still have fucked up with Ultron,” Tony said. “And the Accords would have happened no matter what we did.”
“Then who?” Tony asked.
“What did you do to Tony?” Natasha had less hesitation than he did. She’d heard what T’Challa had told Steve and her loyalty had ultimately always been to Tony.
“Hey!” Steve protested, blushing a little. “Standing right here, assholes.” Tony noticed that he didn’t move away though. Baby steps, he thought.
This was the moment, Tony thought. Since that cave in Afghanistan, he’d always known that there was a reason he’d made it out alive. This is it...” he murmured.  He started pacing around the room. “What's our timeline?”
“Gah!” he yelped. “No thinking about Bruce’s balls!”
Steve met his gaze. “If you wanted to, we’d be very happy.” His eyes were clear. “But if you don’t then we’d understand and there would be no hard feelings.” He sounded as though he choked on the words.
against me, Ms. Potts?”
“Going to lose your flower?” Pepper asked in that dry and extremely mean-spirited way she had when she was totally jealous of Tony’s awesome.
“Another interesting development,” Loki noted with that ridiculously annoying smirk. “I’d forgotten just how entertaining you mortals are.”
“Hello!” he called. “Anyone home?”
Ross was furious. “I’ll make you regret this,” he swore.
Dean blinked.
died at the Avengers’ hands in Sokovia.” Her eyes gleamed scarlet. “And you expected me to be your friend?”
Crowley turned in the air, standing on nothing. “You’ll have to use the bridge,” he told them. “We didn’t cater much for actual humans visiting us.” He spun around once more, striding across the tear in the earth, heading for the other side of the gorge.
The words reminded Tony of what Thor had done
“The look that tells me the shit is about to hit the proverbial fan,” Rhodey replied.
Nick Fury tells us?” she sneered.
“The place where we found Matilda is no longer there,” Natasha said, eyes moving between Steve and Clint. “It is as though it was a figment of our imagination.”
~~~~~~
Bucky put a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “I’d prefer it be the both of you, but if I had to choose, right now, Tony would be the one I’d turn to.”
For an awful moment, Tony thought he meant Bruce.
“That's...” Bruce looked ill. “That's sick.”
“SRA?” Reed frowned. “I don’t believe I’ve heard of it.”
None of the team had left. Natasha and Pepper rested against each other on the sofa in the corner of the infirmary. Clint had commandeered another bed and was sitting cross-legged, sleeping with his eyes open, a talent that Tony refused to admit he was envious of. Thor and a slender stranger were talking quietly to each other. Every now and then Thor would reach out to touch him as though he wanted to ensure he wasn’t seeing things. His companion was skittish, often dodging the big hand, but allowing it occasionally with a put-upon air that told Tony he was just as eager to reaffirm Thor’s presence.
“An Infinity Gem is needed to power the equation that Tony Stark and the monster’s human form have designed.” Wanda’s even tone had Steve staring at her. “The Space Stone is on Asgard, and the Mind Stone gives Vision life. Therefore, we need another.”
“Tony…” He heard the plea in his voice.
Tony knew that was important. “So you can be an evil fucker all your life and then one act of redemption cancels it all out?” Bucky sounded furious. And so very, very damaged.
Tony’s ears pricked up. “Pleasures?” he asked.
“I’m willing to try, if you are sure, my friend.” Thor walked over to Vision. “But this does not feel right.”
“That’s never ended well for any of us,” Natasha said. “Chitauri, anyone?” She sauntered over to Bruce, leaned against him a little, just enough, Steve noted, that Bruce leaned back.
“As I said, some of the older demons aren’t too happy with my method of rule,” Crowley explained. “The road to the Cage is monitored by several of them. And because it’s a path not often chosen, they’ll be very aware of my bringing three humans into Hell.”
He stepped off the elevator and headed into the lab. “No admittance, F.R.I.D.A.Y.” He paused as the bulletproof glass doors eased closed. “And that includes Ms. Potts and Captain Rogers. Is that understood?”
“Clint, the last time you followed me almost cost you your marriage, your children,” Steve said. “I won’t do that to them again.”
Tony threw up his hands. “As productive as this has been, I think I’m going to go back to my lab and try to figure out if Asgard is the center of a black hole or if it’s our universe that has that particular privilege.”
“He's never shown any kind of interest before,” Tony pointed out.
“You’re being serious?” Bruce asked. “Is
“He’s worth it,” Bucky gritted again, jaw tight. His arm tugged Tony closer.
“What, huh?” Steve demanded.
“He has one?” Bruce asked. Tony snickered.
“Why don’t we get the stone first? We can always deal with the Collector once we’ve done what we need to do.” Tony’s practical suggestion took Steve by surprise.
Bucky sucked in a breath and stalked towards Steve, pulling off his clothes as he walked. “Fuckin’ tease,” he growled.
changing his friends.
I'm getting into the groove here. Starting over with these 3 is harder than I thought. Thanks for the love.
“Tony.” Pepper sounded angry now. “Grow a fucking pair, you big baby,” she snapped.
The shouting started again.
“I hear you, man,’ Sam said with a sympathetic smile.
“I wanted to take you up on your offer,” Steve said. “With a proviso.”
Tony felt hot and flushed. And it wasn’t the sex. “Shut up.”
“What’s up?” Tony asked once Nate was settled against his chest.
He fell into his chair. “So Bucky Barnes is alive,” he mused. “No wonder Cap went off the reservation.”
Tony collapsed on a chair. He forgot sometimes just how much work these guys were.
Sam shook his head. “No, the other one.”
“Yeah,” Steve said. “And then I met Tony Stark. The guy who, in so many ways, reminded me of Howard and yet was so very different.”
Tony swallowed hard. He couldn’t talk over the lump in his throat.
“Stop what?” Tony asked as he buckled under the pressure of her gaze.
Steve shook his head and handed Tony a plate. “Eat.” It wasn’t a request.
dreamed they came true.”
Matilda moved down the chair, leaving space for him to sit. He obeyed the silent command and she padded up his body to sit on his chest. “Oh, so that’s how it is,” he said.
Bucky took pity on him. “I came to Tony for help. He gave me a new arm.” He waved the new arm around. “Then Steve showed up. The end.”
handy.”
Thanks again for the positive comments & feedback. This is truly fun for me.
Sam clasped his shoulder. “Get some sleep, man. The world is always a little clearer after some rest.”
Steve’s flat look spoke volumes. Bruce hid his laugh in his hand, the traitor. Coulson’s dry, “Please,” didn’t help either.
“What is on your mind, my metal friend?” Thor swept into the kitchen as only Thor could do. Even without his cloak and armor, the Crown Prince of Asgard had a way of commanding a room as very few others did.
“Then we can just lie here for a bit,” Bucky said. “I’m kinda tired too.”
“Was it something about me?” Bucky’s question had him spinning to look at him.
“Protection?” Steve spat the word. “Is that how you see this? This is protection? It's internment, Tony.”
“Good luck with that,” Tony snarled back. “I’ve got the Winchesters in my corner. You’re not going to win this one.”
Steve sighed. “Agent Coulson.” He shook Coulson’s hand. “I’m not going to ask, just damn glad to see you.”
“Don't.” It was one word but it conveyed the absolute end of Steve's considerably long rope. “Not. One. Word.”
“Yeah,” Tony said. “I mean, he slaughtered Laura and the kids. I’m surprised Clint didn’t ask earlier.” Clint had never asked. Not in Tony’s timeline. And perhaps that had been the tipping point for the Avengers. Why they’d fallen apart so easily when the SRA had come up.
“’Kay.” Steve flapped a hand at him in a pathetic attempt at a wave. “G’luck.”
Dean scratched his ear. “If we told you how many times we’ve died, you wouldn’t believe us.”
Loki sighed dramatically. “I never intended to hurt him or his minions.”
Someone cleared their throat behind Barnes. “Uh, is it okay if we come in?” Steve’s soft question had Barnes spinning and grabbing onto him in an awkward one-armed hug that Steve returned ten-fold. “You’re such a jerk, Buck. You shoulda told me you what you were planning on doing.”
“Eh.” Tony wasn’t sure. “He’s not the sort who hides from a fight. He’s up to something.”
Tony, being the leery bastard his father had raised, googled them, and was horrified to see them show up on several FBI Most Wanted sites. And then be listed as ‘deceased’.
“No,” Bruce agreed, slightly apologetic.
Bruce looked between them. “So, that's why Steve’s got a bug up his ass. You two are busy flirting with each other?”
scars. That’ll shut them up.”
Steve’s eyes went flinty. “Because apart from me and Bucky, you’re the only two enlisted men and the Secret Service has cleared you.”
“Well, that sounds horrible.” Bruce stood at the entrance to the living room, watching them. “Anything that sounds a little less like the book of Revelation?”
“It’s the only currency I understand.” Bucky was still as a statue.
“Oh for…” Natasha huffed impatiently. “I’m not some wilting flower who’s going to get the vapors if you mention the one who got away.” She propped her hands on her hips. “Get over yourselves.”
Apologies for the late update. I hope you enjoy. Thank you again for sticking with me.
Everyone made a pained noise, including Bruce.
Tony tapped his palm and the armor slid back into its new and shiny carry-on. “You’re just jealous,” he told Coulson, manfully avoiding sticking his tongue out.
It keeps the fire burning.
The bathroom door cracked open. “You need me to come in?” Rhodey sounded like he was hoping for a negative reply.
“And just what is it that you are feeling, Steven Grant Rogers?” Tony felt like he’d been put in a tumble-drier and spun out dry and hot. This wasn’t supposed to happen. He was supposed to keep his distance. Not let them back in. Be aloof and yet kind. This wasn’t aloof, kind or distant. His body was on fire as Steve picked him up and carried him the few feet to his bed.
“How do you know?” Bucky asked.
Kissing Steve was
“Together.”
He stood, staggering a little without the weight of his captain in his arms.
And Clint was making like Fu-Manchu and refusing to answer anything until Thor got back. Pepper looked as though she wanted to throttle him. Steve had decided to leave that to Natasha at their next sparring session. Watching her beat the tar out of every person that took her on was inspirational.
“Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork,” Steve said, his sly humor creeping in. Fucking finally, he lowered his shield. “It's good to see you, Tony.”
“What?” Tony’s eyes went wide. “No! God, Bruce, it’s what
“I know where Thanos is.” They all looked up to see two women walk in. One was a leggy blonde in a skin-tight outfit that Tony admired chastely. The other, the one who’d spoken, looked like a blue and silver Frankenstein’s monster of bits and pieces of metal patch-worked together to form something vaguely human.
The metal gloves unwrapped from Tony’s arm when he reached out to touch Bruce’s shoulder. “I think that the two finest minds on earth can figure out a way to control the Other Guy.”
Thor perked up. “I have the powers of a god,” he announced proudly.
Still saying nothing, they walked through what Tony was privately calling the abattoir. Surprisingly, at one point, Barnes took his place at Tony’s shoulder and Steve took the rear.
“J.A.R.V.I.S. will always be with you, Tony.” Vision stood in front of Tony, looking more human, more real, than he could bear. “I have transferred his matrix to your mainframe. He and F.R.I.D.A.Y. are busy getting to know each other.”
~o0o~
Tony sucked in a breath. “Wow, that hurt,” he marveled.
“First of all,” Bruce growled, “That's horrible...”
Tony grinned, sending another beastie over the edge of the gorge to its doom. “Lucifer locked down for another millennium,” he declared. “We just need to make sure we don’t have any kids.”
“You know that denial ain’t no river in Egypt, right?” Rhodey shook his head. “I think you might have become revirginated. I’m worried about you not getting any while you pine away for the boy who ran.”
“Tony….” Bruce shoved a hand through his hair. It looked like it hadn’t been washed for days.
“No!” Bruce looked offended. “I just thought that any UST was between
“I think perhaps it would be good to have Iron Man with you,” Coulson said, cool and calm. Tony gaped at him. “He’s the only one of us here with the ability to fly, and it may come in handy down….there.” He waved a hand at the floor.
Sam nodded. “Looks like the Set of Egyptian origin actually had its roots way back.” He read from the text, “
“Bucky likes you. He needs someone like you in his life.” Well, that wasn’t what Tony had been expecting. He could feel the confusion sliding across his face at Steve’s words.
Liar.
Tony grabbed at Clint as he was towed out of the workshop. “I’m not going down alone!” he declared as Barton tried to wriggle out of his grip. “We are a team and we shall die together!”
Steve started salivating when he saw the stacks of pancakes, bacon and syrup. “”He?” He was too focused on the food to pay much attention.
“Vision said that he’d managed to upload your matrix onto the mainframe,” Tony said. “How did he manage to separate your synapses from his?”
Vision stared at Pepper for a moment. “Symmetrically she is pleasing to the eye, both hair and eye color are desirable. Her form is exceptional and her skin tone is smooth and hydrated. So, yes, I would agree that Ms. Potts is a most excellent specimen of the feminine gender.”
“You lied to me!” Steve wasn’t going to let them turn this on him. “You found Bucky and you never said a word!” He couldn’t stop the pain coming through on every word.
“So, Crowley,” Sam tried again.
Even though Bucky had said no, the memory of Bucky’s lips against his wasn’t something Steve had been able to forget. Now had had something else to think about. He wondered if Tony tasted like coffee and machine oil. He was dying to find out.
Bucky moved away from Tony, coming to sit next to Steve. “So,” he said. Tony narrowed his eyes at them for a moment and then turned back to whatever Bruce was saying.
Rhodey dropped an arm around her. “It’s Tony, hon. Honestly. What did you expect?”
And he’d never meant it more.
Tony’s arms came up around him, holding on just as tightly. “Your girl had other plans,” he said, pressing a kiss to Steve’s sweaty hair. “She decided to use her initiative.”
“I was just getting started.” Bucky bit Tony’s lower lip, holding it between his teeth. Steve tried to remember the things Bucky had told him about when he was with a girl. If Bucky had learned this before…or if he’d been taught after…
“Now you’ve hurt
The undignified snort behind him made Steve grin.
“It’s been almost an entire day!” Thor protested.
Steve woke up with a start, alert in a heartbeat as only those who had spent time sleeping under fire were able to wake.
Bucky’s mouth tilted up a little in the corner. “Steve once told me that for someone who talked so much, you sure didn’t say anything relevant.”
“Tasha.” Clint held out his hand. “Please, I just want to talk to my wife.” He spoke softly, carefully.
Steve kissed him hard then, lifted him so that his feet dangled a little off the floor. He pressed Tony against the reinforced glass, moving one hand down to Tony’s ass. He urged Tony to put his legs around his waist, moved in closer so that his cock was pressed hard against Tony’s ass. “God, you make me crazy.”
“My prime directive is to ensure your safety and happiness as you well know, Sir,” JARVIS said. “If I may, it appears as though the attentions of Captain Rogers are not unwelcome to you.”
“Because, no matter how much you try to pretend, you live a very boring life.” Pepper was a cruel, cruel woman. She was just lucky that he liked her enough to let her live in his amazing house.
Steve sat down with a relieved sigh. “Thanks Vision, I’ll feel better knowing what he’s doing. Maybe tell him and Bruce to come up for some food?”
Tony pulled her into a hug. “I’m so grateful for you, Pep,” he whispered into her hair.
“Take advantage, please,” Tony begged, rocking himself on the hot length of Steve’s dick. “Fuck me.”
“And dumplings,” Clint added.
“Stop what?” Tony asked, widening his eyes innocently.
“I adore you.” Tony put his hands on Bucky’s cheeks, leaning forward as he said, “Nothing you do is going to make me hate you. Nothing you say. The only way I’d hate you is if you left.”
doing?” Steve couldn’t believe it. “I thought you cared about Tony!”
Tony leaves his bed & goes to science. Steve leaves his bed & goes to deal with Thor & Loki having a breakdown. Reality bites.
Bruce gave an exasperated sigh. “Then by all means, feel free to leave and I’ll get back to you when I have some answers.”
Steve clenched his fists. “Then why the hell did you let Tony go?” he demanded. “If it was a suicide mission, why did you act like it was going to work?” He wanted to put a fist through something. Right now, Bruce’s big green Hulk face was an appealing prospect.
Steve scratched the back of his neck. “I wanted to clear the air with him a little,” he said, going back to his own coffee. “I guess Bruce thought that you and I needed to talk too.”
“I’m fine.” Tony flapped a hand at Steve. “Stop looming over me, dammit. I’m fine.”
Billie looked at Steve. “You’ve cheated me as well,” she noted. “But I like you so I’m not mad.” Dean mumbled something under his breath that had Sam chuckle. “What?” she asked.
So this is short & sweet because let's be real, the boys are going to be dysfunctional forever. I have some ideas of a Loki rescue but that will have to come after I cure my brain of my Civil War feelings.
Tony knew they were being manipulated, but even the smallest chance of the Other Guy showing up ensured his cooperation.
“Sir?” Steve didn’t understand.
They'd stopped at the new Avengers HQ, and picked Wanda up on the way to wherever the hell they were going. Vision had vanished and had been refusing all calls. It was suddenly much clearer to Steve as to why.
Bucky, Natasha and Clint formed a line behind Steve. They were silent but clear. The Avengers were a team.
~o0o~
“Ugh.” Clint made a face. “I really don’t need those kind of visuals, Buchanan.”
He opened his eyes a moment later when he realized he’d not smashed his face against bark. “What the…?” He looked around, heart thundering. There was alien, (hello Chitauri), and then there was this. He watched as Skurge and Strange appeared to pop out from thin air.
“I needed….” Steve struggled to put words to his feelings.
Tony wasn't convinced this was the smartest move. “Steve, I really think...”
Bucky hadn’t come to him.
“You can’t blame yourself,” Tony insisted. He tugged at Bucky so that he dropped down, tucking his face into Tony’s neck. “My company created arms that have killed thousands. If I think about it too hard, I’d never get out of bed.”
“Oh my god! You were fifteen when you had your first kiss?” Tony was beyond thrilled to hear this. “You were a total cradle snatcher, you dog!”
“Start what?” Bruce asked, coming up beside him.
“Nat?” Steve stepped towards her. “You can’t call Bruce.”
“I asked whether you, Bruce and Vision could give us an update,” Steve said. “Do you have something to share?”
“Stupid-ass super assassin here fucked up my gorgeous arm.” He jabbed a finger into the meat of Bucky’s thigh. “I couldn’t stand seeing my creation suffer.”
Tony couldn't help himself. “So, Cap, now that we're all together. All, meaning you and me and the Buckster over here, how do you feel about a threesome?”
“Don’t listen to him,” Adam said, pulling away from Lucifer. “He’s a liar.”
Tony pulled back with a reluctant pop of lips. “You know how much it pisses me off that you call my incredibly high-tech artificial intelligence a robot butler, don’t you?”
Natasha’s expression was enough to shrivel a lesser man to ash. Barton was obviously made of something indestructible, Steve thought. He was still standing.
“Do that again and I’ll feed your lips to you,” Natasha said pleasantly.
Lila frowned. “Who changed it to Bucky?”
Fury looked past Steve to where Thor was standing, poking at a mobile phone. “It’s actually more
“About what?” Bruce asked. Steve stumbled into Tony as he reached him. “Steve?” Bruce raised an eyebrow. “You look…flushed.” The little smirk left no doubt that F.R.I.D.A.Y. had been tattling on them.
Thor nodded. “The last time our father slept the Odinsleep, it was several millennia before he woke.” He grimaced. “I would be happier if he were to awaken in his own home.”
Tony had to literally put his hands over his mouth as he followed Skurge. Being silent was entirely anti-Tony so he was having a tough time keeping his mouth shut. He could actually
“No.” Tony met Bruce’s calm gaze. “The Science Bros have tapped out of the superhero business for good this time.”
Steve saw the slow wink. “Hey babe.” Tony leaned up and kissed him. “Did you miss me?”
“I thought she was
I hate math & science. So of course I had to research quantum mechanics, string theory, multiverses & cosmology. I broke my brain.
Steve stifled a laugh. It wouldn’t be appreciated just then. Bucky nudged his knee with his own, smiling a little. Steve still got a thrill each time he looked over and saw
“Oh no,” Tony wagged the same finger. “You do not get to act like you’re judging me.” He looked over at Bucky. “How long?” He knew that he’d get the bald truth from Bucky.
Clint crouched down, careful as a wrangler with a twitchy colt. “I’m sorry I left without saying good bye, Coop. I made your mom a promise a very long time ago that we’d never go to bed angry with each other. I let her down, I let you and Lila and Nate down. I just hope that you can trust me again someday.”
“Yours,” he whispered, kissing Bucky’s shoulder. “Always yours.”
“Neither could I,” Steve whispered into his hair, his heart breaking at the thought of how awfully, completely, utterly they’d failed. Even though they’d stood together, it hadn’t been enough.
"Because I'm a curious soul," Tony drawled, filing away the information Loki was giving him on his intentions.
"Yeah, but he doesn't wear a heart monitor anymore," Natasha pointed out. "It might not be a problem anymore. And Phil," but she trailed off, no words coming.
“Both,” Tony said, already rising to relieve Rhodey of the doughnut box.
"Well, I'll change my viewing selection tonight then," her lips quirked upward.  "I had been considering
Clint let out another breath and his smile was no easier than it had been earlier but it was warmer. "I think I need to go shoot some things. Work some stuff out you know?"
“Wait, no, I did watch one Star Wars,” Tony said after a moment. “There was something with Clones—”
“Nope,” Clint chirped, perching himself on a stool an narrowing his eyes at the device Tony was working on, trying to figure out what it’s function might possibly be. “Bruce needs to be educated not only on how to relax properly but spaceships. You need to relax too.”
“Yes,
"Okay," Clint said and inched closer again. "I'm not okay and I'm still wearing my grief like a fucking funeral shroud but—but if we get some ground rules I think... we could try. Sometime."
Charles turned on his charming smile, leaning against the bar, "And you.  It's quite an honor.  Tony's told me so much about you."
"I'm hoping to," Steve answered, bringing the saucer with tuna and a small bowl with water in it and set them down near the kitten.
After a second he glanced down at his chest and tapped the top of the arc reactor. “Glad you got us through another year,” he said and then looked around quickly to make sure no one had noticed.
"Look, I—" Clint paused, realizing he had no idea what Bruce was talking about before continuing. "I realize that Stark needs to come with an instruction manual, and that you're worse off than the rest of us that have been seeing him in the media for the past thirty and some years but still, could you hit less of his triggers in a given conversation? You might as well be punching him." He said it casually, as if that would help at all.
He offered a faint smile, “Yes, something I wanted to do alone. I, for now I think I’ve visited the graves that I needed to. Besides Howard's anyway, I couldn't get it in this trip.”
Natasha unfolded from where she had pulled one leg up to rest her forearm across it, "Well, you all heard the man, let's open gifts."
Steve's free hand moved to cup Tony's cheek as he leaned down into the kiss.  The arm around the inventor's waist was loose enough that he could pull away, but Steve curled his hand around Tony's side automatically, conveying a desire for the other man to stay. Moments later, Tony jerked away, the rest of the room silent. He forced a laugh and quickly stepped out from under the plant in question. Steve took a step back himself, putting space between them, a blush coloring his cheekbones.  Natasha's eyebrows had risen sharply and Bruce finally cleared his throat, shifting further into his chair.
Steve watched him, carefully taking a step forward, "And that's the only reason?"
Tony gave him a sideways look, dropping the packages on his work table that was off to one side of living room. It wasn't the same as his full lab but he still liked it. "I'm sorry, did you expect Stone Age decor?"
Steve looked hesitant at that, but Bruce cut in, "I'm not big on cats, but my guess is that he'll decide whose kitten he is. I'm sure it could be set up as a rotation if people want to share him."
"No, it's for the best," Bruce replied, shaking his head.  "I wouldn't be able to handle it if something happened to her because of the Other Guy.  She doesn't get that I don't have any control when he's loose."
"It has been too long," he agreed. He'd stopped by briefly when he returned to Earth looking for Loki but they had not had much time. "Come, I would like to show you the tower, if of course, you do not mind Anthony."
Steve gaped at both of them, "I'm not sure how them firing on you makes this better."
"Are we keeping it?" Clint asked, face opening up.
"No, but they're hard to miss when one walks past a newsstand," the other answered dismissively.  "How long do you think that you and said national icon will last?"
"Who else are you looking for?" Thor asked, wandering over to where he saw the history books.
"There's decaf," Darcy said, already bounding back in from the kitchen and going straight for the door. Touching Jane's shoulder, Thor followed.
"I was under the impression you were..." he trailed off.
"It's a lot of ornaments is all," Steve answered.
“That good, huh?” Bruce asked, voice a bit creaky and at least they were back at the tower. He hated waking up confused and hurting on the battlefield even more.
“Well, maybe he’ll leave before it becomes a problem,” Steve said, already getting distracted by Tony’s mouth again, eyes drifting down.
"I have to admit I was surprised when you said you remembered any gifts this year," Charles mused, watching the other man.
“And sentimental,” Thor said and Loki shook his head, leaning up to kiss Thor again, soft and quick.
“Please tell me you are joking,” Thor said, shaking his head.
"What do you even want me to say?" Tony asked, hands clenching and opening.
"No, I thought I'd just invite four guys and a girl to live with me without thinking about it at all," Tony replied snidely. "Yes, I'm sure. I have five floors above me that aren't seeing any use really because I need only two of them for living space and frankly, we're a team now, right? Might as well be team mates of a sort. Avengers tower and all that." He glanced over at Clint. "You can have the top floor with your freaky predilection to anything high."
“Sometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth,” Tony snarled. He reined his rage in. “But I don't want to see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center… instead of a Wakandan prison.” He hated that he sounded like he was begging.
Bucky sighed. “I’m guessing it will eventually fade, but I’m conditioned to take orders. And when I don’t have them, I’m lost.”
“It appears that I am restored.” His voice was hoarse as he rolled off Steve, unconcerned with his nakedness. “I owe you a debt of gratitude, sir.”
Tony wanted to protest, but in that room, with these people, it seemed unnecessary. He plopped down beside Pepper. “I’m pooped.”
Tony reached out, touched Bucky’s hands. “It wasn’t you.” As he was saying it, he realized that he meant it. “That person, that weapon, it’s been destroyed, decommissioned.”
Tony licked Steve’s palm. Steve let him go with a grimace, wiping his hand on Tony’s pants.
“I bet you’re trolling me,” Tony mumbled, snuggling up to Bruce. “Aren’t we inviting Rhodey to this little soiree?”
.” She pointed at Peter. “Out.”
“Nope, still happily hetero,” Rhodey said, keeping a firmly positive expression on his face. Tony could see the fear lurking beneath.
“How did we forget that he is our friend?” Clint asked. “Nat, we fucked up.”
He banged on the glass. “Let me in!”
Steve pressed Tony’s lips together with two fingers. “Shut. Up.”
Loki shrugged. “I told him nothing, merely that we needed his magic to save the universes.”
“Did who do what?” Tony asked, striving for an innocent expression.
“I’m sorry.” Bruce’s quiet apology seemed to punch the anger out of Thor’s body.
Steve reached over, letting his hand stroke across Bucky’s skin. “Buck?”
Tony met Clint’s gaze with horrified glee. When they started howling with laughter, everyone else stared in confusion.
Steve flushed when Natasha looked up at him with a raised eyebrow. “She doesn’t ‘talk’ like that to me,” he said, feeling his cheeks heat up. “I just get emotions from her.”
When Bruce came to discussing Johannesburg, he swallowed hard but continued, talking in shorter, sharper sentences that spoke volumes as to his grip on the Hulk.
“Fair enough.” Steve had finally found his voice. “Are you the package that the king mentioned?” He didn’t feel like dancing around the topic today.
“Do you need help?” Steve asked.
Tony just knew that Crowley being happy was a very,
“Tony.” Natasha clearly wasn’t happy with that.
~o0o~
“Use my toothbrush,” Tony said, clambering to his feet.
Getting better! yay! Thanks for all the kudos & comments. I'm not too proud to admit they make my day :D
“We’ll have to compare notes, honeybunch,” Tony told Rhodey as they walked. “Oh! I’ll ask Pep who does it best!” He gave a mental jig as he watched Rhodey’s brain shut down.
“Whatever keeps the hope alive, Cap,” Clint said, tongue poking out of the one side of his mouth as he wrote. “What the fuck?”
never spoke out and then it was too late.”
Sam looked at Steve, eyes wide and pleading. “Yes,” he sighed. “For god's sake, get out of here and go flying with your war buddy.”
Sam and Clint started a drinking game based on “Never Have I Ever” and it was quickly established that Tony was surrounded by degenerates.
Steve reached out, ran a hand over Bucky’s hair. “This guy here has seen the foulest pieces of humanity and he still finds it in him to trust.” He smiled at Bucky. “You amaze me, Buck.”
Pepper was gone. Happy. Fury. Hill. T’Challa. Shuri. Lang. Pym. Clint’s family. Tony couldn’t even imagine what that had done to Barton. He’d been out. Free. And that purple fucking nightmare had taken them all away without a moment’s remorse.
Tony got the impression that Yggdrasil was laughing her ass off at him. He decided to take her at her word and clambered out of the bucket-basket thing.
Bruce kept them updated as to the deteriorating condition of Tony's heart and every negative report had Steve hunching further and further in on himself. He was the team leader. He'd gotten so used to Tony's genius getting them out of whatever stupid fix they'd got into, most often Tony's fault in the first place, that he had no idea what to do. The man with a plan had no plan. Nothing. Nada. Bupkiss.
~o0o~
Steve pulled back, squaring his shoulders. “I suppose you could call that an apology kiss?” he suggested.
Loki pulled away from Thor, eyes wet and wounded. “Nothing that has been done to me is less than what I deserve for betraying my father.” He seemed intent on self-flagellation.
“What caused the panic attack?” Bruce met his gaze as he forced Tony to go back to the original problem. “I know that Wanda must have shown you something that set you off.”
“Barnes, Sgt. James Buchanan, has a full military pension in the Bank of New York,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. broke in. She was clearly enamored with Bucky. As it seemed, several others were.
“I just wish you could talk to Bucky,” Tony said. “He’s got as big a guilt complex as you have.”
He heard Thor ask, “Is this the last of them.”
Clint laughed. “Did you just quote Yoda at us?”
“I’d be delighted, Shellhead.” Steve took his hand and got up, mouth red and slightly swollen. It was
Steve breathed an almost helpless laugh. “Fury, you son of a bitch.”
“What’s going on?” Her voice held that quaver that Tony knew was the onset of tears. There was nothing he hated more than seeing Pepper cry. “I don’t understand…”
Tony gestured towards it. “Steve, meet Wind Witherer.”
“We all do,” Rhodey came onto the balcony looking pretty pale.
Vision turned that merciless gaze to him then. “I would not betray my friend’s confidence to you just as I would not betray yours to him.”
“Tony…” Steve began.
“Purpose.”
“Let’s get moving then.” Steve got to his feet, dragging Tony with him. “I reckon there will be a fair amount of clean-up to be done once the brain-washed people start coming back to themselves.”
Tony collapsed on top of Steve, entirely rattled. “Move over,” he ordered, shoving at Steve’s thigh. Again with the stroking temptation. Goddamit, Tony thought, he really had to get his mind on the game and off the sex.
Thor sighed. “I understand the idiom, Lady Natasha, but it is indeed as though someone has died.” He dropped his chin onto his fist. “My brother refuses to even discuss the possibility of not handing himself over to the Collector.”
“I know.” Steve’s reply was surprisingly placid. “Bucky told me.”
” A gentle shove sent Tony stumbling forward into the tree.
“Oh, you knew your name,” Bucky told him. “You shouted it at people when they wouldn’t bring you more booze.”
“You don’t,” she whispered. “You make me crazy but you don’t make me miserable.” Her fingers twisted in his.
“How about giving me the fucking benefit of the doubt,” Tony snapped back. “If the meeting doesn’t go well, then believe me, I will fill you all in.”
Tony tries not to make choices for others. Steve gets a few home truths from the king. Family isn't always blood. Trust isn't always rewarded. Betrayal can sometimes blind-side you.
“What do you want, Stark and how much is it going to cost?” Fury didn’t bother with a greeting.
“That is not your decision to make, Tony.” Vision’s calm eyes met Tony’s as he dropped his arm. “I am not human, my absence will not be felt.”
Steve wasn’t sure what had prompted this, but he’d grown to like Wanda a lot. She was direct and honest. He appreciated that in the business they were in. “What are you getting at, Wanda?” Steve asked.
“Not anymore.” Pepper’s soft agreement made Tony look at her.
“He’s a speed-reader,” Tony explained to the room at large. “He’ll tell me the juicy bits.”
Tony knew that drinking vodka with Natasha was a bad idea. Saying no to Natasha, however, was a
And started laughing when Coulson went white with shock, and then pink with delighted recognition. “Captain America?”
Tony remembered the name, it was the clearest memory he still had apart from Steve’s body on the courthouse steps.
Bucky waited.
Tony knew his smile was smug. “Definitely door number one,” he said. And scowled. “Not that we’ve actually managed to get any further than some kissing.” He glared at Bucky. “You need to fix that,” he said.
“Steve, if you say anything other than my name for the next ten minutes, I will end you,” Tony warned.
Tony nodded. “I had a … difficult relationship with my dad,” he said. “He wanted me to be perfect and I wanted to disappoint him.” He’d grown easier with talking about his problems. Rhodey and Pepper had both squeezed it out of him and Bruce “I’m not that kind of doctor, Tony”, had been a sounding board he’d used many a night.
“We should probably work out our limits before we hare off into battle with Thanos,” Tony said.
“I lost an eye, Captain,” Fury replied. “Not my soul.” He ended the call without another word.
“Don’t be a chicken-shit, Stark.” Bucky’s teeth gleamed white in the fading light. “Put on your big-girl pants.”
“The one that’s showing up on people?” Sam asked.
“Promises, promises,” Bucky grinned. “You talk a good game.”
Bucky reached out, put one big hand on Steve’s belly. Tony was fascinated at the quiver of muscle.
Tony felt his eyeballs do a three-sixty. “Well, of course it
Bruce looked over at Clint, determination to ignore them all shining in his eyes. “Alright, Clint. We're going in 3... 2... 1.”
“Crossing dimensions, traveling through time, destroying worlds,” Tony said off-handedly as he poked at his tablet. “We need to get back to our labs at the Tower.” Steve had never felt less necessary.
Tony met his gaze. “I am. It was never going to be a permanent gig once you all came back,” he said. “I’m too old for the superhero business now.”
“I’m not a casual guy.” Steve met Tony’s dark eyes. “I can’t be casual about this.” He swallowed hard. “You and Bucky, you’re set up differently to me.”
thinking about Steve Rogers coming. No sirree Bob!
“About what?” Tony could play dumb with the best of them.
“That’s going to have to wait until he gets back,” Steve said. He tapped his earpiece. “Pepper, you hear me?”
Tony dug his thumb into his eye. “Lord, Pepper is going to want
On the screen, Bruce was discussing how the creation of the Abomination had come about and everyone was gasping. None of the politicians had known just what an obsessed lunatic Ross had become. Nat hadn’t trusted him, apparently, neither had Tony, not really. But Tony had tried to take Ross on alone and that had led to the splinter of the Avengers.
“I don’t understand,” Tony said. “I thought you said he loves me.”
Bruce stared down at him. “You met Natasha, right?” At Tony’s nod he continued, “She has qualifications in most martial arts and several fighting styles that I’ve never heard of. Plus she’s exceptionally good with weapons.”
“Don’t forget genius, philanthropist,” Tony reminded him.
“The peach cobbler is killer,” Bruce added.
Tony looked sharply at him. “To the end of the line?” he quipped.
“Tony mentioned that he’d been blasting you with radiation and most of the nanites had disintegrated,” Bruce noted.
And Steve knew that no matter who they called the leader of the Avengers, the glue, the heart of them, was Tony.
Steve hated that Bucky knew that. “He left. I didn't kick him out.” He had to point that out.
Bucky’s mouth was tight. “You need to think before you say shit, Steve.” He stepped close, tilting Steve’s chin up. “I didn’t break the skin.”
Yggdrasil told him.
Steve and Tony sat at the conference table back at the compound. It was twenty-three days later, and there was a hush over the world as everyone struggled to take in what had happened.
Tony nodded at him. “Well, Secretary, then General, Ross decided to try to develop it for the purpose of using it on American soldiers a few years ago.” There was a sort of hum of muttering around the room. “Bruce Banner was on that project.”
She raised one perfectly sculpted eyebrow.
Tony shook his head. “Doubtful. Thanos kicked our asses. We stood together, and he still won.”
F.R.I.D.A.Y. swung the double doors open obediently. The man standing in front of Tony wasn’t the same guy who’d been laughing with Steve in his dad’s photos of the Howling Commandos. This man was damaged in a way that made Tony’s heart break.
Bucky pulled his hand away from Steve’s. “It’s okay, Doc. I
Steve stared at Tony, certain he’d misheard. “What?”
I'm so not sure about this one. Tony's refusal to deal with his shit is entirely based on my own. Be gentle on me with this chapter.
I'm with you....to the end of the line.
Please excuse any glaring errors.
“How quickly is Jörmungandr moving?” Tony asked with his head bent over his tablet, Bruce hovering over his shoulder.
Skurge shook his head. “
“And the Accords that you signed have him that power?” Steve asked.
Thor sighed. “It too, has disappeared.”
Tony jumped, edging away from her. “Don’t touch the merchandise.”
Tony narrowed his gaze. “I believe you said he was adopted?” Thor flinched.
Jörmungandr sat down, resting his back against the bark of the enormous root. “
“All you have to do is reverse whatever you did to poison my friend,” Steve said as the transporter shuddered to a stop. Peggy had brought them right to the infirmary.
Tony rubbed the sleep from his eyes. “Why didn’t you wake me earlier?” he asked Steve, noting that a pool of drool adorned Steve’ shoulder. He wiped it off with a grimace. “That must have been attractive.
“Peggy said I should tell you this,” Tony said, grabbing Steve's face between his hands and kissing him until his head swam. “She's tired of us pretending that we're not crazy about each other.”
“We’ll have to try, Nat,” he whispered. “I can’t imagine a world where Tony could hate us.”
She wiped at her eyes. “We will be,” she said, standing up and smoothing her skirt. “I think we should perhaps stay on separate sides of the country for the next little while though,” she suggested.
May shrugged. “Eh, I squash ‘em all.” Scott went a little pale. Steve caught the slightest curve of May’s lips as she climbed on board.
Clint was up a second later. “No
Apologies for the late chapter. I've had the mother of all gastro - plus side I'm down about 3kg/7lb so silver linings.
“It’s nothing you need to be sorry for,” Loki spat. “I’m the mass murderer here.”
“And Reed,” Tony added for good measure. “Because you. Are a dick.”
“I know that you just turned Earth into a black hole,” Bruce scoffed. “You’re responsible for the death of billions.”
“Sir,” JARVIS couldn't have sounded more apologetic. “Ms. Potts is insisting on speaking to you.”
Skurge nodded. “
Steve scrutinized him carefully. It seemed as though he’d come to some sort of conclusion as he stepped out of the shower, Tony still in his arms. The feeling of Steve’s cock pushing against him with every step had Tony making noises he was sure he’d be embarrassed about if he actually gave a shit.
Tony stared at him. “How do you figure that?” He was genuinely curious.
FRIDAY interrupted him. “Boss, power levels are way below opt...”
“Quit the pussyfooting,” Fury griped.
With an almost giddy sense of relief Tony said, “You too, Cap.” He looked back up to Barnes again. “Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here. You can drop…” He saw Steve sign to Barnes without a word and he lowered his gun. Tony ignored the slightly sick panic roiling in his belly.
Bruce sighed. “It looks like it.”
Tony, Pepper and Rhodey stared at each other. “Who was that masked
Tony scowled. “Get out of my lab, you traitors.” The pointed finger and foot stomp weren’t exactly mature but he was being attacked dammit. “Just because I haven’t asked Steve out already, doesn’t mean I don’t have the fucking guts to do it!”
“Maybe we should let one of them in to explain?” Rhodey said, exchanging glances with Pepper.
“I have loved two people in my entire life,” Steve said, staring down at his hands. “Peggy Carter was the girl of my dreams and if things had been different then maybe we would have grown old together. But I landed in the ocean and woke up seventy years later in a world I struggled to keep up with.”
“Tony?” Bucky waved a hand in front of Tony’s face. “You in there?”
Suddenly Steve could move again and he jerked forward, grabbing onto Tony. “You don’t have to do this alone,” he said, keeping his voice low.
” As back-handed compliments went, that was a doozy, Tony thought.
Steve just smiled to himself. “I can see that,” he murmured. He ignored Tony’s petty sneer. “Agent Coulson will be bringing some folks over in about hour,” he said instead.
“Anything I can help with? You two were a real asset on this one.” Tony offered. “I have the resources of the multiverse at my fingertips.” He wiggled said fingertips.
“I know,” Tony replied. “It does make me forget it for a while, though.”
“That doesn’t sound like much of a prize,” Tony grumbled.
“Where are you going?” Bucky asked.
Tony.
“Buck, that was a mistake.” Steve said. “At least until we could be there to protect you from him.”
Tony slipped a hand around Bucky’s fist. “It’s not quite the same, babe.” Bucky’s fingers relaxed, allowing Tony to link their hands. “But I understand why you feel that way.”
“C’mon, dude, tell them what you told me,” Dean urged.
Tony almost fell over. “A compliment?” He held one hand to his chest. “I do declare, suh…” with his best southern belle imitation.
mission. He wasn't running, he thought. He was just making a strategic retreat. He'd
“So I see.” Laura’s voice gave nothing away. “Coop, Lila, go and say hello to your dad.” Tony watched the expressions on the kid’s faces, torn between joy at seeing their father and wanting to support their mother.
“You aren’t.” Steve’s voice was fierce. Tony stared into his eyes. “If I have to choose between you and the rest of the world, I will
Tony enjoyed the rest of the ride with Rhodey at his shoulder, and the earth far below his feet. They chatted about inconsequential things as they approached Washington.
“Is he in his workshop?” Steve started walking towards the stairs.
Dean muscled his way past them to stand beside Sam. “This it?” he asked, looking up at the mountain of granite. The smell of sulphur hung in the air, a tangible thing that felt like a blanket dropping down over them.
Tony wanted to make a stupid comment about handling him, but he remembered the friendship he’d formed with Phil in the future. “I hated you,” he said conversationally, watching as the minutest of tics at the side of Coulson’s mouth was the only indication that he’d struck a nerve.
“It is what I deserve.” Loki's face set. “Please, let us move beyond this and consider what our options are, should your Man of Iron fail.”
“The Frost Giants are large and terrible,” Thor said. “You must have suffered greatly.” His huge arms went around Loki in an embrace that was both loving and comforting.
,” he said. “You and me.”
“There’s nowhere else for us to go.” Bucky looked at Steve. “Right, Stevie?”
“Exactly.” Tony propped his elbows on his knees. “Now, imagine having done that,
” He looked over at Skurge. “
Steve didn't want Bucky to stop talking to him, but talking about Tony was just painful right now. “Really?”
Coulson blinked. “What?”
Natasha’s eyes gleamed. “Oh, please, let’s go and work out in the gym,” she begged.
Sam was beside him in an instant, murmuring reassurances that meant nothing with that circle of metal in his view.
“What the hell?” Barnes’ voice was a gravelly rasp of pain. Tony felt sympathy surge through him. Having spent some time combing through the Winter Soldier archives, thanks to Fury and Natasha’s revenge on HYDRA, he had some idea of what these poor bastards had been put through.
“And where did
Tony shut up.
“That’s why he kept wanting to use that CAT scan thingy on me,” Bucky exclaimed.
Tony met his gaze, allowed him to see the simmering rage in his eyes. “Secretary Ross, there is nothing in the world that spurs me on harder than someone telling me I can’t do something.” He leaned forward, hands clasped loosely between his knees. “Trust me when I say, I would rather use every penny I have to stop you, than allow the SRA to happen.”
Tony helps Ross to see the light. Xavier suspects something. Just one more stop, Steve....
of them are yours.”
“Don't do anything stupid 'till I get back.”
Steve patted him, trying to breathe. Sometimes Thor forgot that he had the strength of about … well, about a hundred Steves. “Thanks, buddy,’ he wheezed.
“Seriously, Cap. I’m good. No trauma, just relaxing in my workshop, tinkering on things.” Tony wanted to get off the phone and find a corner to rock and cry in. He hadn’t realized just how
Bucky grinned and it transformed his entire face. Tony stared at him. Bucky was fucking beautiful.
Tony refrained from a manful yelp.
“Aw,  Pookie, you jealous?” Tony crooned as Bucky handed him over to Rhodey with a grin.
Tony tapped his shoulder, gasping for air. “Oxygen!”
“You’re getting on my last nerve, Nat,” Tony said, but there was a sparkle in his eyes that had been missing for months.
” Skurge didn’t appear intimidated.
“She was worried about you,” Steve told him. “And listening to how shaky you sound, I’m worried too.”
Pepper stopped in front of him. “Well, your
He stared at Steve. “What the fuck?” he mouthed. Steve shook his head.
“Tony Stark.” The voice that emerged from the blackness was less satanic than what he’d been thinking.
“Well,
“Yeah?” Tony croaked, aroused all over again at the thought. “How old were you?” He didn’t think that Steve was even aware of his nudity, or that his hand was idly drawing circles on Tony’s thigh.
“Did you mean it?” Rhodes asked.
Bruce nodded. “Just remember what happens when you push me too hard.” His tone was mild but pointed.
Tony held his nose, closed his eyes and downed the poison. He gagged, but managed to keep it down. “That is disgusting!” he wheezed.
“Perhaps you could suggest to our good doctor that he tells us where to locate his armor so that we may bring it to him.” Natasha’s lip curled.
Clint flipped him off.
“You’ll love him almost as much as you loved me the first time you met me,” Tony assured her. “Stephen Strange is a dick.”
The Winchesters start figuring things out. Lots of talking. LOTS. There's a curveball nobody was expecting - especially Tony. And now he needs to start telling the truth.....well some of it anyway
Thor’s inelegant snort spoke volumes. “I cannot trust you, brother, not when you took on our father’s form and managed to trick me.” He shook his head. “I am afraid that I must add my insistence to this.”
Unbeta'd so excuse the errors.
“A friend,” T’Challa replied. “My friend says that you should shortly receive a package that will assist in melting your ice-block.”
His words were barely out of his mouth before Steve was on him. Steve kissed him like he did everything in his life. Carefully, considering all angles and conquering.
“Between you and Bruce, you’ve got the whole world fooled into believing that you’re nice guys.” Tony shook his head and took over the knotting of his tie.
Bucky’s smile widened. It was a preferred expression on his gorgeous face to the devastation of earlier. “Aw, babe, is that Tony-speak for ‘take me, I’m yours’?”
“We’re the Avengers.” It was as simple as that to Steve. And it was one of the myriad reasons that Tony adored him. “If we don’t do it, then who will?”
Waving goodbye to the others, the Winchesters headed outside to the barn with Tony and Clint. The Impala was parked inside, gleaming in the sunlight that shoved through the wooden panels of the barn. Tony sighed wistfully. “She’s a beauty.”
you, Tony.”
. “Morning,” Dean drawled. “Looks like someone had a good night.”
“I’m going to do some work?” He assumed that was the incorrect answer when Pepper frowned at him.
They were practically shouting in each other’s faces now. “She’s a kid!”
Jörmungandr flinched. “
“That sounds….bleak,” Natasha said.
“Thank you, Doctors Barnes and Rogers, I appreciate the concern.” Tony could see the skeptical expression on Bruce’s face and smiled. “It’s completely curable and the two of you have the remedy!”
Talking telepathically had become a lot easier while he’d been working in the Most Holy.
“So our gravity affects the other universes?” Tony asked, tapping his mouth as he did a slow walk around the model.
Sam popped up on the landing pad. “Sorry to break up the party.” He looked around. “Not dissing you, Stark, but this doesn’t look like much of a party.”
~o0o~
“You offering us a job?” Bucky shook his head. “Already got one, thanks.”
Tony propped his fists on his hips. “But I told you that I did!” He didn’t like the idea of his creation doubting him.
“Why so serious?” Bucky poked at Steve’s side, unerringly finding that single spot that made Steve’s skin crawl with giddy laughter.
Natasha stalked towards him, growling under her breath in Russian. Thor gave a high-pitched shriek when she grabbed his balls in her hand, twisting viciously. “Я тебе яйца оторву!”
Apologies for the late update - I've spent the past week in preparation for fire evacuation as well as helping those who lost everything. Writing was the very last thing I was thinking about.
“No, that’s me,” Tony said, tongue firmly in cheek.
“Okay, so I’m going to ask you to see if you know anything about this animal,” he said, picturing Matilda in his mind.
Tony watched him leave, putting his friend above everything. Above the Avengers, above the rule of law, above reason.
Tony watched as Jörmungandr frowned. “
I appreciate the discussion in the comments section - it shows that y'all are thinking about what I write which is truly appreciated. Note I have not added tags for specific reasons. Yes, trigger issues like PTSD & anxiety attacks for sure, but I think I've been pretty clear from chapter 1 that I am on Team Iron Man. Don't like? Don't read.
Thanks for hanging in here with me.
“Always,” Steve agreed.
“Creeping up on the guy with a weapon of fiery death is never the best choice, Steven,” he said as he turned around.
Since Natasha had stared at him with dead eyes when he told her that his stealth technology had worked a little
Rhodey stalked back to them. “I have to go,” he said, mouth tight.
“I don’t mind sharing,” Tony refuted. “It’s just that I can’t trust you spy types to not try to reverse engineer everything I lend to you.” He’d had enough of making weapons that ended up in the hands of monsters.
Tony realized suddenly that the day was almost over while they’d been at S.H.I.E.L.D. “Anyone hungry?” he asked.
“You’re a better man than most,” Steve told him.
“When I was a kid, before you and I got to be friends,” Steve swallowed hard. “I didn’t have anyone who gave a damn about me except for my mom.” He remembered feeling weak and so very afraid. “So one day, after I’d been whaled on, Mom was fixing me up. Patching the worst of what the bigger kids had done.”
Steve stood at a window, staring out at the forest that stretched as far as the eye could see.
“I will give up the Mind Stone,” Vision stepped up beside Tony, touching his shoulder. “That would solve the issue, correct?”
“Sorry about that,” Steve said, sounding not sorry at all. “Guess you’ll have to make do with one of us if you need us for something.” Tony totally heard the quotation marks in that one.
Tony turned to look at Strange. “Go,” he urged. “I cannot come with you.”
“Bucky, we’ve not spent much time together and you don't actually know me, but I’d really appreciate it if you could get Tony a glass of that whiskey over there.” Bruce pointed to the bar.
Tony smirked. “I keep things interesting.”
“Nat….”
“You kiss me with that filthy mouth?” Tony joked, but his eyes were very serious.
“Unhand me!” Loki demanded. “Peasants do not have leave to touch a prince of Asgard.”
“Pfft,” Tony replied. “Agent is not my type.”
He started shaking. How the hell had he forgotten that? He realized quickly that this was what Uatu had meant. He needed to start keeping a record of his memories. Not only so that he didn’t fuck up again.
This had become a routine thing. Once a week, Steve would bring Bucky to see Tony and let him mess around in his best friend’s brain. Sometimes it worked, other times Bucky sank into a silence that he couldn’t penetrate.
“Gentlemen.” Xavier’s quiet remonstration had them flush like chastened children.
“Thor, I need your honest opinion.” Steve folded his arms across his chest. “What are our chances, realistically?”
“More night. Twenty...”
“Lead on, MacDuff,” Tony said. Jörmungandr gave a him a leery look, but turned, heading back into the tunnel he’d come from.
Coulson nodded. “Okay.”
actually going,” Pepper said, and she just looked tired now.
“You never listen to my orders,” Steve pointed out. “We’ve pretty much established that.”
“He never said…” Steve remembered Tony’s attempt to talk to him in Siberia. “I guess I just didn’t listen.”
“Hey!” Tony protested. “I didn’t do anything.”
Steve hid his smile behind his hand.
“She wasn’t who we thought she was,” Sam said, sounding as devastated as Steve felt. “She saw right into our souls and took what she needed to use us to achieve her mission.”
Strange stepped a little closer to Steve. Tony wasn’t too sure how he felt about that. “Well, if we don't do our jobs.” Tony watched Steve lift his jaw, set in the way that only Captain America, the world’s most stubborn asshole could do.
“I’m fi…. Ow!” It was Steve’s turn to be on the receiving end of Tony’s glower. “Seriously, are you trying to break me because I managed to get home in one piece?”
Thor heads back to Heimdall. The Avengers have some drinks. Tony realizes he's got a family.
“What are you smiling at?” Bucky asked. “It’s creepy.”
Tony exchanged a look with Bruce. They’d definitely corner their favorite Norse god later and pry the truth out of him.
“I dabble.” False modesty was obviously not Stephen Strange’s strong suit.
Tony tries to plan. Tony cannot plan. Steve gets a headache. Wanda has an objection.
“Gimme a hug, dickwad,” Clint said.
Rhodey slapped the other side of his head. “Not okay, Tones.” He glared at Tony. “And once more I’m reminding you of the embargo at discussing our sex life with each other.”
A wicked smirk and Bucky slid the tip of his tongue into the slit of Tony’s cock. “Holy fu…” Tony lost the ability to breathe as his balls drew up tight and high. “Buck, I’m gonna…” He tapped Bucky’s shoulder to warn him.
Tony was frankly a bit disappointed.
“We bid you farewell until we meet once more,” Thor said, clasping Tony’s arm and practically crushing his hand.
Bruce grimaced. “Thanks,” he said, sounding anything but.
was that I died,” Steve suggested with a placating smile. “Maybe this is the reality and you just had a bad nightmare.”
“Fuck.” Dean’s nostrils flared. “All I need is that slimy dickhead to make my day perfect.”
Steve looked around. “Where is Vision?” he asked.
“You need a drink?” Happy asked, ignoring his order. “You look like you need a drink.”
“I would never jest about summoning a demon,” Thor told him, all sincerity. Thank god Tony could still see the funny in this increasingly insane situation.
“Never thought I’d find the sight of two men making out sexy, but you and your soldier boy,” Bruce fanned his face with his hand. “Hot, hot, hot!”
“I am not being…cagey.” Steve wondered if Thor knew what that meant. “I’m being honest.” Okay, so maybe he did.
“You hauled me away like a sack of potatoes,” Tony pointed out. “Awesome, sexy, intelligent potatoes, but potatoes nonetheless.”
Steve waited but the silence got to him. “I did what I thought was best,” he said.
“Dear lord.” Steve’s sigh was a prayer. “It’s like herding cats.”
“Tones.” Rhodey waited for him, Bruce rolling his eyes. “This isn’t one of your media conferences where you get to control things.”
“I love you,” Steve replied, eyes very soft as he looked down at Bucky. “Whatever you do will feel wonderful.”
Steve was ravenous. He and Bucky had headed up to the kitchen on strict instructions to eat and leave Tony with his toys. They had both been reluctant to let him out of their sight.
“Why don’t you explain it to us, in small words, so that we can follow?” Tony loved it when Steve got his sass on.
Tony opened his mouth. And closed it again. Something was wrong. “Where am I?” he asked, his voice suddenly very small.
Pepper dropped her head to lean against his shoulder. “Since when did you
“Well, this is so much more entertaining than I thought,” Crowley beamed.
“Me.” Tony’s declaration was met with silence. “Seriously, guys, who better?”
“It’s a little bit funny,” Strange said with a small grin. “Get in your pail, Stark.”
“Home, sweet home,” Clint crowed, bending down to kiss the landing platform. Tony ignored the idiot.
“Tony!” Natasha rushed over to him, eyes wide. “You’re here!” She stopped in front of him, clearly unsure what to do next.
“Only if you say we’re friends,” Tony said, ignoring the tension thrumming through Jim’s body. “When you can tell me what’s waking you up screaming at night,
Steve grabbed Tony’s hand. “That means a lot, Tony. Thank you.” Something heavy lifted off his chest, a weight he hadn’t known he’d been carrying.
Tony turned his face into Steve’s shoulder, scooting up next to him. Bucky moved in behind him, arm tightened a little at Tony’s movement.
Bucky’s eyes narrowed. “I’m fucking serious, Tony.” His mouth went tight. “I nearly lost my mind.”
Tony closed his eyes. He wasn't anywhere
“He’s being Tony,” Bucky shrugged. “If Steve’s worried though, then maybe you should get him to the doc just in case.”
“And you didn’t think that maybe this was information I might need?” Tony could hear the panicked screech in his voice, but the stories he’d heard from Thor and Loki had made him more than a little paranoid where the Giants were concerned.
Tony gave him the middle finger and kissed him wetly on the cheek. “I will get my revenge,” he promised, smacking Rhodey on the butt. “The exoskeleton really shapes the globes of your ass beautifully.”
“You’re also loyal and brave and generous,” Bucky continued right over Tony’s complaint. “I haven’t felt safe in seventy years.
Uatu’s voice was fading.
Steve, not hurt him.
“Lucky,” Tony assured him. “Damn fucking lucky.” He reached Bruce eventually. “You doing okay there, boo?” Bucky peeled off to sit down beside Rhodey and Sam. The team took up both front rows. It was reserved for family after all.
Bruce leveled a flat gaze at him. Tony waved a hand. “Never mind, I have ideas for Hulk-to-Bruce pants.” He paused. “I think that should be Bruce-to-Hulk pants.” They were amazing, incredible, awesome ideas actually. Tony itched to be back in his workshop.
?” Xavier asked Richards.
Tony was lost. “Will one of you please explain just what the fuck is going on?”
Tony wanted to lick him from head to toe.
“Hurry!” Rhodey sounded panicked. “I think I may actually be at Alpha Tau Omega and if they find me I’m a dead man.”
“I killed him.” It wasn’t a question.
“You’re refreshingly different,” Crowley said, moving faster now. He stepped onto the platform just as Tony landed with Steve. “I’ve clearly missed several news items from up there.” He stared at them, one finger tapping against his mouth. “I think perhaps you might just be able to do this.”
“Call up the terrain map of the islands off the coast of Australia,” Tony ordered. He scanned the area that lit up. “StarkTech made you just a little too well,” he murmured. “But as I
Sam put a hand on Bucky’s shoulder. “Cool it, buddy. We can’t afford to get into a fight with each other.” Steve had never appreciated his pragmatic friend more.
Bucky followed them. Tony turned around. “And just where do you think you're going?”
beer.”
Buck sighed. “Booze doesn’t make the problem go away.”
Steve glared at him a little. And sighed, slumping against Tony. “Apparently we're heading up into space to steal one of the Infinity Gems from a person called the Collector.” He looked at Rhodey and the others. “And we thought things were crazy when we had to deal with a sentient robot lifting a city out of the ground?”
much better.”
Pepper raised her right eyebrow. Natasha raised her left. “Do we even want to know?” Pepper sighed.
“Mm.” Bucky bent down again, pushing his tongue in next to his finger.
"You can win it eventually," Tony said. "By staying alive long enough."
"I'm not asking you to," Steve said.  "I'm asking for your side of this.  I haven't seen Clint that angry since we set up here."
Watching him, Clint returned to sorting through Coulson's ties, trying to think about them as abstract colors and patterns rather than specific memories tied to buying them or pulling on the tie to drag Phil closer after a particularly bad day, with mud and rain water still in his hair.
Steve paused, blinking before looking up and mentally cursing when he saw the mistletoe there. "Oh," Tony managed. "Who the fuck bought mistletoe?"
"Most people don't think I need anything else going to my head," Tony said, sitting back and touching the side of his own head.
"I was thinking a belated Christmas gift to our friends and allies," Bruce said, pulling his reading glasses off and setting them to the side.  "Charles Xavier might enjoy them."
"How could I say no?  It's been, well, quite a while," he offered her another smile as they sat down.
Pepper looked at the plane before bursting out laughing, "Oh, but Rhodey it's a perfect model.  And look, it flies too."
“Good is pretty relative,” Clint said, rolling one shoulder.
"It is," Bruce agreed, tracing a thumb over Clint's cheekbone.
"You mean to help people out of the goodness in our hearts? Please," Tony shook his head.
Loki's jaw tensed and he nodded once, "Among other things."
“Are you honestly doubting it?” Thor asked, sounding exhausted.
Thor trailed after him, looking around the store with interest, still amazed at what humans decided to invent.
She shrugged, "You never plan to do anything. You just do it. You wake up one morning and find you're in process on something you didn't realize you were doing and JARVIS and I will have a long conversation about it approximately three days before you realize it too. Unless it's science and then we'll have the conversation about three days after."
"You'll have to fight for it," Natasha answered, softly.
"Yes?" he asked, still distracted before shaking his head and looking back at her. "Sorry, Jane, did you ask something?"
“Tony, it doesn’t matter how many times you’ve seen Star Wars, it’s Star Wars and always worth a rewatch,” Clint declared, pushing him from the lab toward the elevator.
"What will you do when you do find him?"
"Or himself," Clint said. He hesitated for a second before looking over at Bruce. “How are you feeling, anyway?”
Steve sighed and shook his head, "I disagree. I'm not sure what would make you think that, but hating you isn’t ever going to be better for me."
"Well," Tony shrugged. "He wasn't doing anything?" It felt weak to his own ears. "No, no, scratch that one."
"A couple?" Tony asked, propping himself up on his elbows and cocking his head at Steve. They hadn't talked much at all yet. "Which are...?"
“Is that not what you want?” Loki asked, eyes dark in the low light.
Charles waved a hand at that, affecting a falsely wounded tone. "Yes, yes, be on your way then. You've never listened to me in the past, why start now?"
"What?  He was doing what?"  He paused, "Is Clint alright?"
“You’re just in time. Clint was planning on showing us some films,” Bruce remarked.
“I happen to quite like you all,” Steve muttered.
Steve shook his head, "It was a variety of things.  Some before," he glanced at Tony and then away. "Some before Iron Man, Monte Carlo, a senate hearing. Some press conferences."
"I would almost be offended that you chose Clint first," Fury rumbled, but he wasn't.
"So you're what, just making this decision and breaking up with me over dinner?"  Betty offered sharply.
“Including you, right?” Tony asked, looking over at him.
Waving a hand Tony inched back toward his work bench and goggles. “Well, you guys have fun—“
“You do remember of the two of us which got into more fights, right?” Tony asked, smacking his chest. “Like one of us used to taunt bullies and the other spend most of his teenage years building robots.”
Pepper tilted her head at it, "Soothing colors, or muted enough to qualify, not busy, cool underfoot." She nodded, "I think it could work."
Steve and Bruce blinked at that in confusion and Natasha arched an eyebrow. "It's probably not going to be much more than ten pounds.  Mighty warrior might be a steep expectation," Bruce said.
She nodded, her face softening very slightly when it yawned, "It just woke up.  Steve found it."
The next day, Charles Xavier arrived, gaze sweeping around the lobby of Stark Tower.  He shook his head, crossing to the reception desk, his cane under his arm—he only rarely needed it now and mostly carried it for show, the metal on the ends useful to help it double as a weapon.  He offered the receptionist a charming smile, leaning against the desk.  Looking hardly more than thirty helped a great deal and he had been steadily perfecting the way his new body adapted his old expressions, "Hello, I'm here to see Mr. Stark. I'm Professor Xavier."
"I don't want to take that risk," Bruce said quietly.
"Was I planning to date?" he asked, glancing over and stealing another peanut.
"Recently, or does he just always surprise you?" Fury asked and his brows shot up as he turned around the tiny gun she had gifted him, the newest in concealed secret weapons and he carefully did not ask her how she got ahold of it before he did. Damn Stark and whatever connections he still had. "You're here on his orders anyway, aren't you?"
“Odin’s eye, you sound like Fandral.  Of course, you at least have photographic evidence that you’ve performed some of these feats,” Loki set his empty glass aside.
"Cats are always adorable and tolerable," Clint protested, finally depositing the kitten in her hands with reluctance.
Skimming his hands over Steve's shoulders he found himself laughing because he couldn't quite get his arms wrapped all the way around. “You really are shaped like a Dorito.”
“Nothing,” Tony repeated. “Besides, I’m sure you don’t care about my dating schedule anyway,” he added, even if he just meant an interview date.
"Something that doesn't cost money, probably," Clint said. "Or something so cheap it wouldn't even cross his mind. I don't know, you don't happen to have any paintings lying around or something?"
"I can't imagine why," Tony said. An hour or so later, he was getting more desperate though. He'd seen a remote controlled airplane by chance for Rhodey but otherwise he'd made no progress. "People find shopping fun, don't they?" he asked the shelves in front of him, finding nothing useful.
Steve blinked after him, "Tony?"
We tend to toss in random Marvel characters instead of sticking only to the Avengers film, so be on the look out for cameos and various references.
Leaning forward he slid a hand around the back of her neck and kissed her temple. "Say hi to Fury for me next time you see him," he said and almost scampered off after where Bruce had gone.
Natasha picked up her purchases and some of the decorations, "Good, I'll leave as soon as we get back and go get her."
"You mean besides mentioning that he was your first crush when we were growing up?" she asked, sliding over a bit to glance at the floor plans.
"And everything in between," Clint said, pointing his fork at Bruce. "Except possibly sharks. Something about all those teeth freak me out."
"And then they sent her to collect me," Bruce shook his head.
“Least I could do,” Tony said, almost off hand before he stopped himself.
"I was at a bar, he was at a bar, we snarked at each other while circling around for a while and I don't know, it kept happening," Tony shrugged. "I mean, chaos god and insanity and world dominating tendencies aside, he's not
Bruce frowned in confusion before realization dawned, "You mean the Other Guy.  You know we're not the same, right?"
“Not sure that’s a box you want to open,” Tony said though he made a sound like he’d been hit when Steve moved toward him.
"I believe Anthony likes new things, but he invents most of them himself," Thor said. "And for Clint, I am less sure. I know he keeps a distance."
He shook his head, hair starting to static against the pillow. “No. Mood. We are not talking about it right now.”
"Then let's give this a try," Steve said.
"Absolutely not," Tony replied promptly. "Why else do you think we would be in this business to begin with?"
"So after this we're never bringing up my dad again, okay?" Tony said, running his fingers down Steve's sides. "But he did give me one gift once. It was a prototype figure of someone he rather admired. I still have it."
"We did Christmas and everything," Tony said. "Decorations, a tree, and presents." He paused and grinned. "Rhodey and Pepper just about had a heart attack."
"Consider my last trip to your city off limits," Loki replied, leaning back in his chair.
Natasha had rolled smoothly to her feet and had a weapon in hand at the first hint of anyone coming near her floor. She lowered the pistol when she saw Clint, swearing at him in Russian as she holstered it, "Are you trying to get shot?"
Bruce sighed again, "No, it's fine. But she's able to make another life for herself.  She was well on her way to one before Harlem."
“Ah, honeybear,” Tony said. “Didn’t the suit replace the plane? Like, logistically one has been a much bigger help than the other.”
"We're going to need to find gifts, too."
“Are you really going to tell Natasha her significant other isn’t allowed to come?” Steve asked, his other brow going up.
"So what, you're going to just decide things because you're scared?" Clint snapped and drew back, realizing he was projecting his own issues. "I'm sorry. I should... I should not talk anymore."
Steve's eyebrows rose at the stack of ornaments and garlands that were all carefully packaged, "Did you buy out the whole store?"
“You,” Loki gaped at him, struggling to come up with a response. “
Bruce’s eyebrows rose slightly at that, “Neither? I just don’t have much in the way of relaxing material. But, if you want to help, I think you mentioned spaceships?”
So funny story! And by that I mean not funny at all.
"It is heavier, in Jötunheim," Thor shrugged.
Thor frowned, seeing a biography of Howard Stark on the shelf opposite the histories. "Then where else would you like to go?" he asked.
keep it. I promise it is securely and secretly stored away and no one would be able to tell you drew it anyhow."
Steve laughed, turning them in that direction and laying Tony down on the bed moments later. He traced a hand over the thin strip of skin that showed between Tony's shirt and pants as he leaned in and kissed Tony, long and languid. For a while Tony allowed that, exploring Steve’s mouth like that was the only pressing issue before he brought his legs up again, wrapping around Steve’s waist. “Not to hurry this along but I have the horrible feeling some bastard is going to attack and interrupt and I’d rather that not happen.”
"Goddamn the man," Steve muttered.
"And her dropping every piece of her research every time I show up in her life is fair?"
"Tony and I will go get the garlands and ornaments then," Natasha volunteered.
Steve coughed slightly at that comment, "So you found out about the drinks then?"
"It is pretty early to start drinking," Clint agreed, lifting his sandwich in one hand and hefting up the kitten in the other before retreating to the living room.
Tony tried to stifle his next laugh and ended up burying his face in the table. "Okay, okay. Well, I'm sure of all the mares you would be the sharpest, most lethally attractive of them all. With an attitude problem that would never get you laid, of course. But seriously, you have no kids?"
"Something like that," she agreed.
Bruce watched him, quietly, "You could have called for back-up when you realized who it was."
"Hopefully the latter."
Charles' eyes narrowed very slightly, "No, you've taken that point to an extreme that I doubt Hank would appreciate."  He glanced toward the kitten, "Though it is rather an adorable creature."
“A what?” Steve asked, from where he had attached his mouth to Tony's neck.
"Now will you get out?" Tony asked and Fury sighed.
The corner of the scientist's lips quirked up, "Explosions and New York City and I tend not to get along all together."
Tony's mouth thinned. "Whatever do you mean?"
Jane blinked at him, "Does the last one happen much?"
"First of all, the other guy comes out because of heart rate, right? You told me that," Clint said, still not looking up. "And secondly, fuck, how could I even try? A little while ago I actually tried to shop for him and realized I can't anymore."
"We could have fetched you," Thor said, looking sideways at her and Darcy scoffed.
She arched an eyebrow, “You’re sure? I can finish this up if you would rather take the evening off from them.”
"It's still not exactly what I intended," Tony said and was trying as hard not to look at Clint and Bruce as he was Steve.
“Violently,” Tony said. “I seem to have finally discovered people with as many if not more daddy issues than myself. What a joy to discover.”
“Please don’t use him as an excuse,” Thor said. “Mother would vouch for you, as would I, if you gave us the chance.”
"Male," Clint declared. "We should really get him to the vet."
"Yes, and you gave me the answer I expected," Natasha replied.
“Rest assured Clint will make certain you see,” Natasha replied, rising to find a throw blanket or three.
"Apparently," Natasha replied, moving over to perch near Clint. Thor looked down, taking a deep breath and turning to walk back out of the room.
Lifting the next ornament out of the box, Tony froze, hand stopped where he'd been about to hang it without really looking at the small glass figure of a father and son playing in the snow.
"It is good. It means he's not just destruction. It doesn't make me happier about the blackouts, but it helps a little," Bruce replied, offering Clint a faint smile, though he'd startled at the touch.
"Comes from getting caught in the shower," Steve grabbed another towel, ruffling his hair with it to start drying off, but making sure the one around his waist stayed there.
"I did not," Tony protested. "I was completely not at fault."
"Just call?" Tony asked. "Who am I calling?"
Loki's magic made his spine tingle, he had finally put together in the bar when he stood over Loki and Tony, an ache deep in his chest where the scepter had stabbed him in the chest. Tilting his head up, he glanced at the sky and back down to the street, watching children buying ice cream and hot dogs and men in suits walking by with their bluetooth headsets.
“Clint, it,” she paused, meeting his eyes and saying something she rarely said to anyone. “I am sorry, Clint. You deserved to know and I denied you that. I’m sorry.”
"Honestly, I wasn't looking forward to Calcutta again,” Bruce said and Tony grinned at him.
"Well," he paused, trying to remember what he knew of Steve's childhood. "I guess it will do," he huffed, pulling a box of ornaments closer and considering the selection.
When Tony came back downstairs, Rhodey and Pepper packed him off, saying something about a benefit gala that they had promised to attend. As soon as all three had left, Steve emerged from the kitchen just long enough to wish everyone a good rest of their day and disappear up to his floor.  Jane watched him go from where she was still curled next to Thor, "This might be the strangest Christmas morning I've had."
Tony laughed, trying to shrug it off. “Sure.”
"I can't imagine her coming to NYC without the taser.  Especially after she tested it on the god of thunder himself."
“Certainly sir,” Jarvis replied. “As I enjoy every other product of popular culture you ask me to read or watch so that you do not have to.”
"I am hoping that I am not," Thor said, "But as usual I expect that you shall prove me wrong, though you have done little enough harm now." He took a step back toward Loki. "I am already weary of the scope our lives are taking. I try and find you and we fight and I drag you bloodied to a cell you only escape from. How long do you intend to play that game?"
“What a stirring endorsement,” Clint said, rising to his feet. “Alright, I’ll see what I can set up.”
Bruce fell still at those words for a moment and then nodded, managing a slightly strangled, "Good." Natasha looked between them before she left the kitchen, leaving them to whatever conversation they might have.
"He's probably got it hidden," Eric suggested, leaning against the bar.
"I don't know what you mean," Clint said, crossing his arms and leaning further back on the couch where he had been sitting.
"Agent Phil Coulson," Tony said, voice sounding a little hollow. "You knew him a little, didn't you?"
A-A-A-A
"If you have something to say you might as well," Tony replied, still fiddling with the phone, having brought up the floor plans as he tried to pick out floor tiles for Bruce's bedroom.
"I suppose so," Tony shrugged. "Use that one," he added, pointing to the gold star instead of the snowman or the angel that looked a little too angelic for him to stomach.
"I got better," Tony said. "Discovered a new element, destroyed my entire lab and presto, new arc reactor." Rhodey just made a groaning sound. "And then I saved both your sorry asses, I might add, in the same day. And then blew up an entire expo."
"Only if I get to vet them," Tony huffed. "Your own life has to come with approval from Tony Stark."
“None,” Tony insisted. “We went through all of them last year with a fine-tooth comb and since I didn’t have to buy out any stores this year—”
"That's fascinating, because the card that accompanied the gift wished me a Merry Christmas and has your signature on it." Charles drawled, before covering the phone to call into the kitchen, "That's not an appropriate response to the coffee-pot, separate them, now."
It only took several more weeks for the floor remodels to finish and for the team to move in, though Thor still hadn't returned from Asgard to claim his own. The only other member still missing was Steve, though he at least had had the decency to call ahead to tell Tony when he was expecting to be back in New York.
Steve slid his arms under the pillow, crossing them and letting his head rest on the pillow, "You know? I'm okay with that. The surprises."
"I'm not poking. It was on top and loud," Charles repeated, frowning. "And one kiss or not, it was with Steve Rogers." He shook his head, "You're a brilliant man, Tony Stark, but you might look into the fact that the last two AIs you built fell in love promptly."
"You don't have to come all the way over," Clint said. "I know it freaks most people out."
“Water under the bridge. I can’t change it, it was done.”
"Well, we're all a little fucked up, right?"
Several days later, Clint lay sprawled out on the couch, flicking through channels on Tony's TV, still feeling numb and annoyed from the other day. He paused, blinking at the news bar scrolling at the bottom of the screen and sat up suddenly. "Holy shit!"
“What happened?”
Charles' brow arched almost lazily at that, "I didn't think that possible."
That earned a huff of laughter as Bruce set the kettle on to boil, "I think there's a ground rule that Lehnsherr doesn't get to be near most of this city much less your AIs."
"I was going to set him up in my floor tonight, if no one objects?"  Steve responded, glancing toward Clint to see if the other would prefer to have the kitten for the night.
"Uh, yeah," Tony said. "Just don't fight."
"Ever, Loki," Thor said, shaking him. "And stop trying to get away."
She nodded, "I think he'll like it."
“It’s not,” she started but let him push them over to several couches and she plopped down with no grace. “I’m just feeling overwhelmed.”
"How often does it happen, then?" Clint asked, eyes clear and it was clear he wanted more information and biting back the instinct. "If you don't mind, but the transformation? Are you so scared it could get set off that fast?"
"Do not jest about that," Thor said, shaking his head. "Not about your life. You made your own damned choices here, do not blame those who punish you."
Bruce let his hand rest next to Clint's hand. "I don't remember much, just that I woke up hurting and feel like throwing Logan through a few trees every time I see him."
He was about to call it a night when a slender form sat down in the seat next to him.
"Still," Tony said, not quite able to grasp how long Asgardians lived, unsure if he wanted it or hated the idea of
Pepper looked from Steve to Tony before offering Rhodey a glance and arched an eyebrow, shaking her head ever so slightly, "That was a very well thought gift, Tony."
"Because as much as I'm sure she would have, she wasn't the one who went against orders to find him in the middle of the desert."
Not even when they were fighting, or when Loki insisted he did not need Thor’s bumbling when he was trying to learn magic, they had always seen each other at some point or another. It was pathetic to miss him this much, but somehow Thor had thought even with their new reality of fighting on opposite sides, his brother would at least show up to
"Uh?"
"Just five minutes," Steve assured.
"And team building," Tony said, voice almost desperate. He couldn't think of a single thing to give Steve and the fondue set in front of him still didn't feel right but he was out of other ideas.
"You'd have to go through Thor," Tony reminded him, still underneath the table. "And he wouldn't take kindly to you going after his brother. I'd shelf the revenge gig for now."
"When Clint would kill Loki before looking at him, Bruce shouldn't be around issues, Pepper's left and I'm hung over," Tony replied. "Please Steve? For the poor starving Asgardians?"
Natasha snorted, "Not that you did much to help that along," she said, not having to mention how trunicated Tony's file had been.
"Oh," Tony said, almost preening. "Have you been reading the tabloids then?"
"Well," Clint paused, seriously thinking about his next words, sprawled out over the couch and looking at the bright decorations and not really seeing them. "It might not be a bad idea. If you wanted to. I actually shopped for Phil today. Mentally. Didn't buy anything. Not that pathetic. Yet."
"No worries, why are you even apologizing anyway?" Tony said from behind the couch where he was lying on the floor on his back, working on a tablet. "No one was waiting up, it's cool."
Bruce smiled, shaking his head, "Yes, that's very much a suggestion to not do that."
Anything Tony could think to say was too honest. “You—you weren’t supposed to be,” he said finally and shook his head because that was wrong but his hand finally moved out, hovering over Steve’s skin without quite touching.
"We can try it this time," Tony agreed. "Cheese or chocolate?"
“Teenage fantasies usually don’t come true,” Tony muttered, the words coming out quickly.
Steve offered Tony a crooked smile at that, "It's shaping up to be a good Christmas."
“Who was it?” Thor grit out.
"You're only so-so on this whole friendly talk over drinks thing, aren't you?" Tony sighed. "I thought we'd been doing well."
so much."
“That’s not my point,” Loki said, acid in his voice.
"You came here to ask that, did you not?" he said.
Steve picked up a box of ornaments and started hanging them as Bruce opened another container and pulled out a couple of sprigs of fake mistletoe.  He blinked at them and considered where it would be possible to hang them.
"I," Tony frowned at the glowing app that stood in for his phone down in the lab. "Look, I was on top of this whole gift giving thing this year but I so did not send you anything."
"Would you still have kissed him?" Tony asked.
Rhodey paused when he entered the kitchen, Tony perched on the counter with the sunglasses from the night before already on his nose. "Holy shit, Tony, do you keep a pair in the kitchen now?" Rhodey asked and Tony laughed. "Alright, so I didn't expect this entire thing, but what was that?"
"And so far they keep working out," Steve responded simply.  "I can be a stubborn son of a bitch when there's something I care about or want, and you, Tony Stark, are both.  You're not getting rid of me."
Charles laughed, "We'll try to corral them into my study. I'm sure Erik will be glad to help." He hung up before Tony could respond to that.
"I doubt we're going to find that quality on short notice," he paused for a moment.  "What about you?"
"Yeah?" Rhodey arched a brow. "I'm assuming he refused and for some reason you think taking the same questions to me is going to get you answers. Why not try Pepper?"
"Any other enemies you're casually having drinks with?" Clint snarled.
"You mean the time you got completely crazy, killed one of my friends and tossed me out a window?" Tony asked, eyes going a shade colder. "Sure, why not."
Rhodey just stared at him. "Alright," he said, tone wary. "Show him in."
Jane frowned at that, but Eric cut it, "At least you found someplace that’s not like that.”
Steve reached up to comb his fingers through Tony's dark hair, "Then they're not looking right."
VS reporting for duty, only a year and some weeks later instead of three years.
“Well, I have Jarvis remember,” Tony said.
"And that got you a kiss?"  She paused at that, "And you ran."
Shaking his head again but laughing, Steve went back into his arms and they stood there, long after they should have broken apart.
"Does he mythologically have any?" Tony asked. "Say, can you guys have kids with mortals? What would that look like?"
"But it's a new body and you can walk," Tony pointed out, moving over to the elevator. "So don't
Steve sighed, head poking up out of the covers and pausing when Tony sat down on the bed beside him, dropping the strawberries next to his head. “Where did you even get those?”
"What do you mean?" Clint frowned. "I mean, about tomorrow."
Taking a drink of his tea, Bruce set the mug aside and did his best to ignore the unhappy growl at the back of his mind, "At least I know you can keep yourself alive—even if some of those jumps are farther than a human should fall."
"But, that's such a girly thing for you to like," she protested and he only smiled serenely.
"Well, isn't friendship and companionship what this holiday's technically about?" Jane asked from where she had curled her legs up next to her.
“Quite well,” Tony said, tone dry. “They finally named him.”
Tony groaned. "I signed all of them."
"Not what I meant," Rhodey shot back. "Also, that was a now several years ago."
"Yes," Pepper answered, not even needing to know the question, based on what Steve apparently knew.
"I don't even own a bathrobe," Clint said, spreading his hands out as Tony sank down on the couch, inhaling his second cup of coffee. "So you get nude or dressed. I don't care if I'm fucking with a holiday tradition this is the better option."
Steve simply pushed the untouched cup of coffee toward Tony, rising to pour himself another one. Bruce entered, looking rumpled and with a rather severe case of bed head. He poured himself some juice and settled at the table.
Something flickered in Clint's eyes and he tilted his head. "Has the other guy ever been gentle?" he asked and almost kicked himself for asking but the description of whale sharks had felt too close to something else for him to keep his mouth shut.
"Only for a few years, then Tony took over," Rhodey said. "More or less. He was more focused on creating things that blew up than signing paperwork so it was more of a partnership."
"I probably could," he said and grinned. "It's even for six people." It would just have to do, he decided. "Let's pay and call Steve and Thor to carry all these ornaments back to the tower. I suspect they'll have them packaged by now."
Leaning forward, Tony lifted a hand to say something else and stopped.
Clint slid onto the table in front of Bruce, "Hey."
Steve paused at that, frowning, "You took someone's body?"
Bruce glanced at him, his lips quirking upward, "Something like that."
"Don't think so," Clint said. "He was way too calm."
"You are building it a cat bed, that makes it at least partially your cat," Charles smirked.
"Entirely," the other man agreed.  "I'm gonna head upstairs and get my gifts wrapped.  Have a good night."
Bruce stared at the kitten who was mewing and purring again, Clint's smile throwing him for a loop the way it lit up the other's eyes, "A kitten.  When did we get a kitten?"
"It might not be a bad idea. Set up a gallery and a memorial for Coulson all in one. Not sure what I think of that other collection going into a museum, but it's all old stuff now isn't it?"
Tony tried to shove him back down. “No, don’t and yes.”
"And not alienating our teammates," Natasha suggested, looking at Steve pointedly.
A hand landed on his arm and instead of brushing past like other passersby were, it latched onto his arm and started dragging him to the side. Loki whirled, trying to yank his arm away, a spell already leaping to his lips and his free hand beginning to glow green, "Get your hands off of—" He broke off as he realized it was Thor and he snarled, twisting harder, "Get off of me!"
Steve's body was tense, but he obliged the other and lay back down, "And when he told you that?"
“Sure,” Clint smirked. “We might as well finish, don’t you think? And no, Tony, you can’t have a tablet or your phone, pay attention to the movies.”
Steve knelt down, going through the suggested cupboard, "Aha, here we go.  I'll see about setting up a bed in my room, or something."
"Are..." He cut himself off, changing the question entirely, "How drunk are you both planning to get?"
"Except apparently you," the blond replied, looking over the couch at the scientist.
"Exactly," Clint said. "I—I was sleeping with my superior knowing we could die any day and I still wanted it all—the house, the white picket fence, the animal and the flower gardens. I wanted the happy, normal life while sleeping with—while loving someone who could have killed me the first time we met, who should have killed me and considering everything I expected to be shot first."
Tony decided even if he wasn't going to do the research, Jarvis should. "Does Thor have any kids?"
"Sure," Clint said, shrugging. "The pickings should be slim enough to make it either really exciting or hella depressing and I'm in the mood for either."
Clint frowned at Natasha as she fiddled with a folding knife and then at Fury. "Sir?" he said finally, after using a rubber band and pencil to create a makeshift cross bow. "Where is Agent Coulson?"
"Dead?" Charles offered.
“Your heart monitor, you’re not wearing it anymore.”
Tony let out a breath. “But I wanted to.” He tried not to feel the usual squirm in his stomach when people were impressed that he was actually being decent. Sometimes it always felt worse when it was Steve thanking him for the barest minimum a lover should be doing.
But it never reached him as Loki waved a hand and abruptly disappeared from the street, Clint swearing as his arrow clattered to the street, the civilians in the area shrieking and scattering. Many of them quickly ran away to hide themselves inside the nearest building. case another attack was coming.
Pepper looked over at Tony, focusing on the fact that he was wearing sunglasses in his own home, and frowned but nodded once.  She turned her attention back toward Steve, "You seem to have missed a few crucial things over the last several decades. It doesn't take much to fix that."
"So you did meet," Tony sighed. "I thought so."
"Coming from me this is a laugh, but you could try making things easier on yourself in that area," Charles suggested.
“Alright, so the battle to dates is a bit confusing but I think they’re related because you’re usually way better about spatial awareness and heights except for what today is,” and he pushed the strawberries closer to Steve. “Which is the day you lost Bucky Barnes and I think that’s why you froze up on that rooftop and that’s why strawberries were always part of my plan for today. But they became even more necessary so,” and he shoved the whole package of them a bit closer to Steve.
"You know, we should form a club," he told them.
“See, those are well crafted movies,” Clint agreed, before retreating back to his seat as the opening sequence began to roll. “And ones in which I will accept the expanded editions, and gladly.”
"How do you mean?" he asked, and then shrugged, heading over to the jewelry counter, sure he could figure something out himself.
Only he got the time wrong and Tony found himself jittery, moving up and down the place, sprawling over the couch before hitting the gym and swimming laps and sprawling over the couch again. He really hated waiting.
Natasha sighed, not moving, “I should have, yes. I didn’t, but my reasons for that were perhaps flawed.”
"Art collection?" Steve asked, shifting again and starting to turn before settling back.
"I have no idea why that would be relevant," he replied, tone not sharp but edging towards such.
Tony was suddenly up and moving toward the kitchen, leaving Rhodey and Pepper blinking on the couch. Pepper glanced at Rhodey, "You or me?"
Loki raised his glass at that, "You certainly seem chipper, which I am going to attribute to that shift in your fortunes."
“Well, there’s the Lord of the Rings if you really want to show him a newer level of tech,” Bruce suggested quietly.
Natasha kept her reaction to that locked down, "What do you mean didn't look like himself?"
"I'm glad.  They seem like good people.  Even if they are an odd group."
For several strides, Thor was quiet, hand going to her waist again and looking ahead at where lights were strung up around the street, still early and still in the morning light. "More or less," he said.
Natasha spent more of her time watching her teammates than the screen. Every once and a while she would catch Bruce shaking his head at certain scenes even as his lips tilted upward at C-3PO and his conflicts with Artoo.  Glancing away from him, her eyes landed on Steve who was entranced by the effects used on screen as much as by the story. Last, but certainly not least, she focused on Clint, glancing at him more frequently than any of the others to keep a quiet eye on him.
Moments later, Thor came bounding out of the elevator, several packages of different sizes in his arms. The wrapping on them certainly was not what Bruce bought, instead the boxes were textured in brown and gold. "What?" Tony blinked. "Where did you find that?"
"What are they like?" Bruce asked as they reached a store that he thought might have something for Tony.
Tony groaned. “I was
Steve was at his side in a flash, coffee forgotten. “Buck!” He ran a hand over Bucky’s forehead, pushing the hair back. “How are you feeling?”
“You’re creative, at least,” Bucky pushed him back down. “Sleep.”
“What?” Bruce asked, looking around in alarm. “You see something?”
