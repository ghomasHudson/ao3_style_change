Dean figured he would just ask again at another time. The important thing was that they had Castiel back and there was a higher chance of him and Jack visiting them more in the future. Everything was back the way it should be.
The angel, of course, was wearing his usual suit and tie ensemble. But, this time, on Jack’s request, he ditched the trench coat and left it at home.
Jack shrugged as he shut his locker. “Nothing really. Just hanging out with Cas, Dean, and Sam. What about you?”
“Jack, I know you said you wanted a break and you got it. You were gone for three days. It’s time to return.”
Together, they cross the hospital parking lot to where the other love of his life, his Baby, stood parked and waiting for them, loyal, as always.
He did think about retiring. All the time. Especially nowadays. But, he wasn’t sure yet. He wasn't confident he could completely leave the life. But, it was a nice thought.
“Hi,” the toddler piped.
His phone ringing interrupted Sam’s train of thoughts. Seeing “Eileen” flash on the screen immediately prompted a smile to appear on his face.
Sam’s eyes flickered with hope.
Did someone die? Is there another apocalypse coming their way? Was Sam going vegan?
Dean hummed again. “I’m thankful… that you and Jack are back home with us. I’m thankful… that we survived. I’m thankful…”
“But, I’m glad that this chapter is closed,” continued the boy, oblivious to their concerns as he stared at his hands on his lap. “I think mom would be happy. And they can finally have peace.”
! After weeks of only wearing an itchy hospital gown, it feels a little weird to be wearing real clothes again.
Sighing, Castiel turned around.
Pursing his lips, Sam hesitated to say what he really thought. Dean might not react well. So, he went in a different direction.
“So, uh, you had a good holiday?”
They wasted no time settling into their respective seats and passing the food around. Sam and Eileen had brought a bottle of sparkling cider, which was opened and poured into everyone’s glasses.
“That was weird,” Sam mumbled to himself, staring at the closed door.
“So, on the upside, I get my pick of whatever good stuff is in here,” the kid was saying as he bagged Jack’s things. “On the downside, I don't get paid and my parents get free labor.”
“Principal Chan says she’ll talk to him once they… uh… fix his nose.”
The song had changed while they were talking to one that was slow. The children had broken into pairs. Even Jack had Casey in his arms with a respectable distance between them. And a woman, whom Castiel recognized as one of the teachers, was slowly approaching them, determined eyes on…. Dean.
“Don’t have his number.”
Damn, that was so cheesy. The apple pie life was making Dean soft.
“Cas…”
Oh. Castiel wasn’t well-versed in adolescent dating rituals but, fortunately, he was here with someone who was experienced.
“No way! It’s your first day of high school! You need the energy!” Then, he shot up from his seat again. “Speaking of that, I made your lunch.” He walked over to the counter and picked up the green and white striped lunchbox sitting there. “I made you two BLT sandwiches and there’s a juice box in here, nougat, and a jug of water. For God’s sake… I mean, your sake, Jack, do not forget to drink water, you hear me? We don’t want you coming home dehydrated.”
“I saw Jack come out of here. Everything okay?”
The chairs that surrounded the map table were scattered around while the table, itself, had Jack’s hand turkeys decorating the edges of it. On top of the table were opened bags of chips, bottles of beer, and boxes of board games. Meanwhile, orange and red paper chains that Jack made were strung up on the metal railings above them.
Sam raised an eyebrow. “You wish… what?”
A/N: Hello, everyone! I've returned from vacation! I actually got back about two weeks ago and started working on this chapter immediately, but it took a little time. Hopefully, I'll be back to my normal updating schedule soon.
Guiltily, Jack flashed Dean a look, shaking his head subtly.
“That’s only part of it. And, that was at the beginning. He loves you like you’re his. You know that, right?
With a little skip to his steps that he would deny if anyone asked, Dean led the way to the front doors. Outside, they stood in silence, waiting for Jack.
He turned to Castiel and found the angel looking contemplatively at a rack of shirts. Dean, then, remembered that Sam suggested that Castiel get some things for himself, too.
“And if Jack decides to run?”
He dropped his duffle on a chair on the map table before lifting his arm to rotate it. The pains and aches from the long drive were finally settling.
Dean resisted the urge to facepalm. Instead, he cleared his throat. “So, is that it? Can we take Jack home now?”
With that, Dean perked up in attention. He narrowed his eyes at Sam. “You wouldn’t.”
Eileen broke away from Castiel’s hold to meet Sam’s hug, burying her face into his chest. Sam, in turn, kissed her hair.
“Didn’t you design the robot?”
“Just… after everything that happened last year, his drinking has gotten worse. I mean, it was bad before but it's even worse now. He just keeps drinking until he blacks out. And he’s been reckless at hunts.”
Oblivious to the tension between Dean and his brother, Castiel sighed. “Alright,” he finally agreed. “If you say that you truly need it, then we will go.”
That was true. In the last couple of weeks, they had been providing services and research for other hunters. Dean seemed content but Sam had shown more restlessness. He and Eileen were constantly looking for anything that raised red flags in the area. Quick and easy cases that they could do and still return on time for dinner. There hadn’t been any but they did make the effort.
The hunter visibly swallowed but gave him one last nod before exiting the kitchen, hitting the doorframe with his shoulder by accident.
They did that in silence for a while, the clink of the spoons against the bowls and their munching the only sounds. Jack finished first and his hand hovered for a second or two over the box. Dean just flashed him a smirk, which the kid took to mean permission and poured himself more cereal.
“But, how did you…”
Castiel let out a sigh. “I can’t… promise. But, this is what I’ll do. I’ll talk to your mother and the archangels and explain the situation. I’ll tell them everything you told me.”
He landed just a few feet from the bunker’s entrance. On the horizon, the sun was slowly descending, marking the time of day as late afternoon.
It had been a rare day off, months after they had just gotten back from Apocalypse World. Jack was moping around the bunker, bummed about losing his powers so Mary had pushed Sam and Dean to take him out. They ended up driving to the park and there was a guy there, selling cotton candy that he molded into various shapes, to the delight of the children watching him. Jack had immediately been hooked and begged Sam to get him one that was shaped like a duck. Sam then went on a lecture about the negative effects of sugar in one’s body and that a cotton candy that size would rot his teeth. Before he was even done talking, Dean had already paid the guy and Jack had returned home with his yellow and pink duck-shaped cotton candy. He showed it off to anyone in the bunker he came across before splitting the sugar monstrosity with Maggie and her friends.
She appeared to be in her car, not driving obviously, but clearly prepared to go somewhere.
“I don’t think you need that much-.”
Dean forces his voice out as his lids get heavy. “C-Cas…”
“Um… Castiel left.” Jack finally broke the silence. He wasn’t looking at Dean, his gaze firmly on swirling the cookie bits. “He went back to Heaven to talk to the archangels.”
“You need a hobby, Cas,” he told him. “You can’t spend every school day of this entire year just walking around the bunker like a ghost and watching movies when I ask. You need to do something to occupy your time. Something fun. Think about it.”
Dean’s brows rose. “Yeah? That’s good. Focus on the health of the mom and baby and all that jazz.”
It was a little past six when the rumble of a car outside alerted them to their visitors. The table in the dining room was already set and the warm food arranged neatly by Dean.
So he told himself as he struggled to breathe through his nose as he followed Sam out of the kitchen and back to the war room. His brother threw him a few looks over his shoulder but the glare Dean sent him shut him about offering his help.
Dean’s prediction was pretty spot on. Aside from meals and the occasional run-ins in the bathroom, the brothers barely saw Jack in the next two days. The boy holed up in his room, doing God (Jack?) knows what. Sometimes, though, Miracle would nose at his door and whine until Jack opened the door to let him in.
“Jeez, mom, why not slather him in sunscreen, too?”
“Why are we even considering letting him go?” said Raphael, clearly against the whole thing. “His place is here. He has a responsibility. To us, the angels, Heaven, and Earth. He is God.”
Sam hesitated. He wanted to tell someone about this new thing going on in his life but he was afraid of it getting back to Dean. Jack patiently waited for him to continue, looking genuinely interested. It was easy to talk the kid. He may not comprehend why things were the way they were, sometimes, but he never judged.
The sounds of shuffling reached their ears and they straightened up just as Mrs. Kline returned, followed by her husband.
Well, the next few months would be interesting. Sam just hoped that Dean got his feelings in order before Castiel had to leave again.
Castiel smiled, that bastard. “They really did, Dean. You do it often and their size indicates how angry you are. And although they weren’t quite that large earlier, it was enough to let me know that you were…” He raised his fingers to add air quotes. “Pissed off.”
The beeping sound he has been ignoring grows frantic as he tries to get up.
And, maybe, just maybe… Dean could finally figure out how he really feels. Because the thought of loving Castiel… returning his best friend’s love and devotion… it felt right.
“How about from the moment The Empty took you. Start there.”
She shrugged before letting out a low laugh. “Running away from home is a classic teen rebellion move. I’ve done it. Just goes to show he’s really my son.”
“This image you see me in, Dean, it’s not really me, but I’ve grown comfortable in it. I could have chosen to leave this body at any time and take a female vessel but… I can’t. I won’t. It always felt… wrong. Like cheating in some way. Jimmy sacrificed himself to provide me with a vessel, it felt wrong to just... change. But, I also didn’t want to make you uncomfortable. So, I chose not to say a word about my feelings. It was easier that way. And it worked in our favor.”
Rushing back to the War Room, Dean scrambled through his pockets for his phone and upon finding it, quickly scrolled to Castiel’s name. The other line rang and rang and rang…
“Yes, but…” Jack frowned. “I’m not fond of their strict uniform policy. I read on the internet that it’s important for teenagers to express themselves through clothing.”
“How happy I am.”
On their last hunt together, Sam finally told her of his plans to go back to school. He had been nervous to break the news to her, unsure if she would react, positively. And, at first, Eileen couldn’t seem to comprehend why he would want to go back to school. She was a bit like Dean in that way. But, in the end, she told him she wanted him to be happy. And if he wanted his degree, then she would support him.
“Will you give us some privacy?”
“Dean.”
“This is Claire,” Kaia introduced, smiling fondly at the girl.
Castiel’s heart stuttered. “I’m sorry, Dean, I didn’t mean to insinuate anything.”
He grinned, teeth showing, and it made Castiel grin back. The heart in his vessel fluttered with warmth at the thought of Dean being happy that Castiel was around. He was touched that this man he loved was so considerate of his feelings but he wished Dean didn’t have to make such a sacrifice.
Dean felt his brow raise. “You’re gonna be a nurse?”
“Thanks.” She booted it up and immediately tapped the icon for Facebook.
Jack removed his hand. “Sorry, thought I saw a spider in your hair.”
So, when he awakened from his nightmares, delirious and regretful from watching Jimmy sacrifice his life to save his daughter, the heavy weight of his wings was the first thing he acknowledged. He nearly cried from joy. Next was the fact that he was in his true form and not his vessel. It was strange, at first, as he hadn’t been in this form in so long but it felt good, like stretching muscles that had been stiff for so long. And the last was seeing Jack, his son, welcoming him with a wide smile and open arms. His son whom he didn’t think he would see again. It was, indubitably, a joyous moment.
He watched as a flash of sadness appeared in Castiel’s eyes before they were replaced by a calm indifference.
Across from the two oldest archangels was Gabriel, talking animatedly to Kelly who was seated next to him, about the benefits of adding a giant candy factory in Heaven for the children (though Castiel suspected it was more for the archangel’s sweet tooth than for the children, but you never knew with Gabriel). And, of course, Gabriel kept his old vessel, as he had centuries to form an attachment to it.
They told her and Kaia about Jack’s decision and how they would be around for a while. And since Kaia wanted to see Jack, they volunteered to pick him up from school. Then, Dean decided that he wanted to make a special dinner but they needed to go shopping for groceries. So, he enlisted Castiel’s help. Sam was left at home with firm instructions to prepare a room for the girls. (Castiel felt a little bad that they left him home alone again so he made sure to pick up a fresh bag of salad and Sam’s favorite balsamic dressing.)
“Can’t a man bring his brother coffee without being questioned?”
Later that night Sam left his room to grab some coffee and snacks from the kitchen and found his brother cuddled against Castiel on the couch. Their legs were tangled together, Dean’s head rested on Cas’ chest. Cas was lazily drawing small shapes with their finger onto the soft skin right underneath the hem of Dean’s shirt, eyes focused on the TV. Sam had expected them watching action movies together, but it what was on was very far away from that.
“And that’s where you are wrong. You don’t know any of them, just stereotypes you were taught. I bet there are a lot of ‘manly’”, the asshole did air-quotes,” men who had a difficult relationship with their father and like to drink beer and watch Dr Sexy on Thursday nights. They might have not saved the world multiple times or killed monsters but they know what it’s like to love someone when the whole universe seems to be against it.”
“But we don’t owe you anything. At the end of the day school is our job and we do what we want. I like to support y’all but this is our personal business. Capiche?” he looked at the students with a serious expression. They nodded. Dean was a relaxed teacher, always joked around with the kids, but they also knew not to mess with him.
“Dean could you please, for once, think with your upstairs brain. I’m starving.”, Sam might be a bit dramatic, but it was impossible for him to hide his annoyance. His brother was acting like a horny teenager. Dean got up, mumbled something that sounded like “cockblock” with a frown on his face and walked towards the kitchen.
“You know what I mean. We didn’t want them to know,” he said quietly and wrapped his arms around him. Dean sighed and started to gently brush his fingers through the other’s hair.
“Don’t worry we don’t plan on emotionally scarring you again, Sammy. But if you ever need to improve your grade, just tell me and I dig out that miniskirt and beg them on my knees.”, Dean smirked and wiggled his eyebrows. Sam laughed. He didn’t need that mental image.
They spent the rest of the afternoon, cleaning and talking about Cas and college and the crazy costumers at the garage Dean worked at. Sam could feel the happiness radiating from his brother and it was infectious. He suspected it was the relief of finally telling Sam about his new love- even though that’s not how Dean called it- that made the older Winchester grin and laugh at Sam’s jokes.
“Glad to meet your standards, sweetheart,” he said lighthearted and continued his story, “Anyways, we became best friends. Then in senior year I finally, after a lot of denial and a full-blown sexuality crisis, realized that I was completely gone on the guy. Of course, I couldn’t just tell him, because times were very different and also how do you just tell your best friend you want to have his babies?,” Dean chuckled deeply, running his hands through Jack’s fluffy light brown hair, who was just staring at his dad in adoration. His expressions often reminded Dean of Cas which made him feel warm inside.
Dean sat down next to him, out of the camera frame, Jack staring quietly at his dads, and drank all of Cas’ remaining coffee in one go with a grin plastered on his face. ‘I hate you’, mouthed Cas with a frown. “I love you, too, sweetheart”, he whispered back with a wink.
“I brought you lunch”, he said with a shy smile and placed the coffee and bag on the desk.
“Don’t be ridiculous. They can always hang out here just keep it in the bedroom and keep it quiet.”
“I think I get it, thanks. I think I should leave you two to it. Are you going to stay the night?”, Sam asked casually, trying to not make it awkward now.
Dean blushed and groaned a little at the cheesy compliment. Not many people in his life had ever called him “pretty” and he was not used to it in the slightest.
example, Katya in a bar I would be down for everything.”
“Castiel! Dean! Look she looks so cool!” Jack shouted over the loud music and pointed at a drag queen who waved at them from one of the floats.
“Those are fun, thanks guys,” he smiled at his boyfriend and somewhat son and another swell of happiness overcame him.
Cas’ attention was brought back to the kids when Krissy- a tough girl that was friends with Claire- started talking.
“You know what I mean. We love each other and are both guys but we aren’t gay-gay, you know? We kicked god in the ass, I killed Hitler, we are totally badass.”
“Sweetheart, do you have enough money?” Dean asked steadying him with an arm around his waist.
“What does it look like?”, replied Dean with a grin to hide his discomfort.
“Jesus, Dean, I didn’t know you were that in love with them”, Dean blushed, “Of course I’m okay with it. Will it be awkward? Probably. But I know they are a great person and they will be good for you and I haven’t heard you talk about anyone like this since Benny. I was afraid you lost the last little bit of hopeless romantic in you but here you are talking like a teenage girl about her crush.”
“You know who would’ve loved this trip?” Dean asked in between two bites.
“It is. He can be very cute.”
. It’s the first time I can openly celebrate our love and I can wear as much rainbow as I want.”
“I already feed Sasquatch over here full time, so you can come over for dinner whenever you want, right Sam?”, he looked at his younger brother waiting for his approval.
Truth was Sam felt pretty shitty about getting mad at them. Sure, it was extremely awkward to be in his situation but rationally there was no reason to be pissed. His brother had been taking himself back to care for him his whole life and if he needed to hook up with Sam’s professor to be content, so be it. As he was lying in bed that night he carefully put together an apology for Dean to make things right again.
“She was like a little sister. Kind of like Sam a nerd and way too smart to keep up with. I remember when we first met her in the middle of the leviathan mess, she figured out the supernatural by accident, coped way better than most people would. She helped us with a thing and -looking back- I think she always knew I was bi even before I could admit it to myself,” he laughed “I kind of talked her through the process of hitting on a man and Sam gave her a pep talk about Harry Potter. It was hilarious. A few months later we ran into her on a case in a LARP camp. She was the queen of that medieval fest, because of course she was, and it was amazing- one of the best cases I ever worked- we had to wear costumes and everything. Ha, if I remember correctly, I accidentally cockblocked her from banging a fairy that day. She always kept her head up high no matter what the universe- or we- threw her way. Whenever thinks were not apocalyptic or just a little bit slower, she would come over and bully me into watching TV with her. She was something else truly, always excited and funny and dammit I miss her.”
“Kinda. You can wear the hat afterwards. I want you to actually watch this one”
“What about GSA? It could be fun, right? Like our own little gay cult.”
“Did you get the pie?” He asked as soon as he saw them. Cas rolled his eyes at that. “I wouldn’t dare come home if we hadn’t,” he replied and pressed a quick kiss on Dean’s smiling face.
Sam felt a twist of guilt in his stomach. He never wanted to stand between his brother and a possibly healthy relationship, he never wanted to cause them any trouble. He forced himself to smile.
“He’s so smitten I bet you just have to offer him more and more and he will do anything”
“If you are happy together, I’m happy. Might need some time to get used to it, but you are right. We can make this work.”, he said and he truly meant it. Dean deserved this.
Cas sighed at the question.
“We went to a quieter place to talk and did get a bit numb by the awesome prom spirit, nothing illegal involved,” he had the audacity to wink at the camera and Cas found himself considering murder for a brief moment. He dismissed the idea and glared at him instead.
“Okay go on, then. Don’t get lost.”
“C’mere, buddy, Dadstiel has to work.”, he said in a soft tone and carefully lifted Jack up. The 3-year-old made a protesting little sound but didn’t start crying which is a win. Cas looked at them appreciative and turned his attention back to his class. The few people with their cameras on stared at the scene in surprise and confusion, except Castiel’s niece Claire who watched her classmate’s reaction with excitement. The girl loved chaos.
It was a rather normal Friday evening for Sam, he had spent all his day studying and attending classes and now was more than ready to go to spend his weekend with his girlfriend. He quickly called Jess to tell her that he’s arriving late because he forgot the book on Greek mythology, that he had to read for one of his classes, on his kitchen table. He didn’t plan to drop by the apartment he shared with his brother Dean but he figured it wouldn’t be a problem since all the man did was hang around in bars or watch Scooby Doo and eat fast food. They had a silent agreement to leave each other some space every other night so Sam could study in peace or invite Jess over and Dean could bring over his casual hookups or just have some alone time to watch cheesy TV shows he pretended he didn’t love. “It’s a guilty pleasure!”, he proclaimed the one time Sam caught him watching Doctor Sexy M.D.; of course it was Sam’s responsibility as a younger brother to tease him about it for months.
“Let’s put away the groceries first and when we can show you later,” Cas reasoned and Dean gave him a mock salute and grabbed some of the heavier bags to carry them to the kitchen. Together they sorted through the bags silently despite Cas’ quiet humming of some old Zeppelin song that Dean was pretty sure was on the mix tape he gave him years ago.
“I don’t enjoy it.”, Dean protested, “I said some of them are hot and the fights are funny, that’s it.”
“We’ve been thinking it would be sick to get Castiel wasted tomorrow,” she said with a mischievous grin. Dean perked up at that. “Who’s we?”
,” he replied in this very Cas kind of way that made Dean crack up again.
“You’re right.”
“Of course, you can wear what you want, sweetheart, and I will go to pride with you and the kids, no big deal. I just feel like I won’t have a lot in common with those other queers,” he tried to soothe him and got closer to press a kiss to his temple.
“What are you watching, little spoon?”, he couldn’t help but tease. Dean looked at him, clearly irritated and maybe a bit embarrassed. He tried to sit up at the sight of his brother, but Cas pulled him back into their arms.
With a glance at the time, they wrapped up the lesson, all friendly again and after the call ended, they remained in peaceful silence for a few moments, both processing what just happened.
“I’m just confused. When did all this happen and why did no one know about it? You both had been our teachers for years. I mean obviously Mr. W isn’t straight, but still, what the hell?” she asked directly. Dean started laughing out loud, wrinkles deepening around his eyes and Jack started giggling, too, just because his dad was. Cas kicked him lightly under the table, but smiled at the question.
“I might have overreacted a bit”, he started picking on his nails, suddenly uncomfortable.
His tone was soft and happy as soon as he mentioned Cas and suddenly a lot of tiny puzzle pieces were put together in Sam’s mind and revealed the full picture. Dean’s willingness to drive Sam to school and pick him up lately, Dean’s wide smile and flushed cheeks when he looked at his phone and his awkward attempts to shut Sam up about it when he asked who he was texting. He was flirting less in restaurants and seemed to be generally in a better mood. Sam remembers hearing some girls in his latin class point out their professor’s brighter mood accompanied with an inappropriate comment about them getting laid. Pictures of Indiana Jones on the TV, Dean’s comfy clothes, touching knees, intertwined fingers, silent conversation, Dean told them how Sam was going to react, jealousy, all crossed his mind at once.
“No, Dean. I wouldn’t.”, they said in a serious voice and Sam watched the conversation unfold.
“Alright, gimme a minute.”, he said with a chuckle and went to his bedroom.
“You mean so much to me, Cas.”, he whispered into their ear and pressed a kiss on the skin right underneath. Cas held him close like that for a long time, whispered small praises, lips brushing skin until they both fell asleep. The last thought that crossed Dean’s mind before he drifted of was how goddamn lucky he was.
“I know, sweetheart. I imagined my Thursday morning differently, too. But you know what? I don’t really mind. They will graduate in a few months and I’m so happy to be with you and Jack. So why not talk about it to some stinky teenagers? If any shithead parents want to riot, it’s out of our control now.”
“Claire, you get music rights for an hour. But don’t make me drive my Baby into a wall,” he announced as he pulled on the highway.
A few hours later they took a break and ate greasy burgers in some smalltown diner.
He looked over to the motel and saw Castiel and Jack carry their bags towards him. It would never stop to fascinate him how similar they looked; like father and son.
“We are what you could call ‘Highschool Sweethearts’, have been together forever. We got married two years ago.”
As he reached the door to leave the apartment, he turned to look at them again. They were still sitting there, drinking silently together, with their knees touching. Sam let out a dramatic sigh and said: “We will talk about this on Sunday, Jerk”, he forced himself to smile a little and added, “I’m sorry, Dr Novak”. His professor looked at him, head tilted, obviously thinking about an adequate response. “Don’t worry too much”, they spoke confident but as kind and professional as Sam knew them from class.
“He was alright. Just too cute for his own good,” he corrected and sat down next to Dean again with a fond expression and placed a full coffee mug in front of him. Jack was still sitting relaxed against Dean’s chest looking around curiously yet content. He was usually quiet and clingy in the morning and enjoyed to cuddle and feel the vibration of his dad’s chest as he talked.
“What’s wrong, honey?”, they asked quietly. Dean smiled at the pet name and put his palm on the other’s chest. He swallowed hard, struggling to find the right words. The darkness, the complete silence and his partner’s warm body next to him made it a bit easier.
“Quit the homophobia”, Dean answered coldly, anger slowly starting to boil inside him and poured himself and Cas another drink. His words were making him explode.
Cas took his silence to share something about her as well. “We weren’t nearly as close. But she was very nice. I’m happy you had such an extraordinary friend in her, Dean. I always sort of wondered what you told her about me. Her reaction when we met was a bit strange.”
I know how human money works now.”
“Not for nothing, Cas, but the last person who looked at me like that I got laid”, Dean smiled and shot Cas a wink.
“I wasn’t the downstairs-brain-thinker who started this.”, he said, now smiling, still a bit breathless and put on some Led Zeppelin like he always did when he was cooking. Cas avoided eye contact with Sam, their cheeks flushed, and grabbed a book from his bag that they had placed on the floor next to the couch. They than quickly joined Dean in the kitchen to keep him quiet company and started reading. Dean was peacefully preparing the burgers, humming to the music and every now and then they were both looking at the other at the same time exchanging small happy smiles.
“It’s alright. Just know you have something very special there. If I were you and someone loved me like this, I would worship the ground he walks on.”
A couple of minutes later Dean came out wearing dark sweatpants and his worn out and soft batman shirt. Sam watched him sit down on the couch right next to Cas and give them a soft kiss. This was his signal to leave to his own room and give the couple some privacy. Unfortunately, he didn’t consider his brother’s inability to focus on anything in Castiel’s presence. So when he came back 20 minutes later to check how dinner was going, he found Dean sitting on his partner’s lap, kissing them intensely with his hands under the professor’s shirt. Sam tried to look away and cleared his throat audibly. Both looked at Sam like deers in the headlight and let go from each other.
“There have been some inappropriate offerings in the past if that’s what you are referring to. However, I would never take advantage of my position like that, it’s morally wrong and as I see it these students are just lost. They probably go through hard times, some struggle to fulfill their own academic expectations so they get desperate, many are separated from their parents for the first time and naturally feel drawn to authority. Being with a teacher or professor is not an unusual sexual fantasy, because they barely get to see our flaws and certain people like to be told what to do.”, Cas explained.
Alcohol usually did the trick to put him right back to sleep.
Yes, Kelly should have. She was innocent in all this. A mere victim in Lucifer’s plans. She didn’t deserve to lose her life. Jack didn’t deserve to lose his mother so soon after his birth.
“No,” replied Michael. “We are past keeping secrets from our brothers and sisters. This time, we must be honest.”
“Yeah.”
“I ran away!”
Castiel wondered if Sam was aware of the situation between him and Dean and the deal with the Empty. Surely, Dean had confided in his brother?
“You know, Jack, you also look older than a high schooler,” said Sam. “Since you only got a year, we can enroll you for 12
“So, why are you out here and not in there?”
“Yeah, why do you ask?”
“Jack, don’t you have something you want to ask Cas?” he said.
But, Castiel moves forward to help and Dean lets him.
“Yeah, we got about another 10 hours ‘til we get to Montana. We’ll call you when we’re settled.”
And Dean couldn’t help but think that, in his own way, he had found his own heaven on earth.
“Just told him to hang out in the Dean Cave while we set up his room. Got his stuff?”
Dean appeared at the door, looking casual and bored but his demeanor perked up when he saw Castiel was there, too.
Just hearing that gruff voice sent the heart within Castiel’s vessel to suddenly start beating hard and fast against his chest. Excitement. Anxiety. Longing. All mixed in together like one of Sam’s beloved salads.
“Not-.”
Dean turned the knob and pushed the door open. His finger had already squeezed the trigger before his eyes and his brain fully took in the figure in front of him. Luckily, iron bullets never had an effect on angels.
In it, Jack was raising a half-eaten ice cream cone, smiling toothily. Next to him was Castiel, wearing a small serene smile, his blue eyes sparkling under the sun. And beside him was Dean, beaming with his arm slung over the angel’s shoulder next to him, a smudge of chocolate on the corner of his lip.
It was up to Dean, then.
Dean placed Castiel on pizza sauce duty. Meaning, he was to watch the simmering sauce Dean made and stir it every now and then. The recipe called for two hours of that and the angel was the most patient among them.
“Well, still, we’re not punishing him,” said Dean, firmly.
When Castiel agreed to tell him everything that Jack refused to, Dean had stalked off to the kitchen. He needed alcohol for the incoming conversation.
“Cas,” Dean replied. “He’s talking about germs and bacteria.”
Jack nodded. “Even Uncle Raphael.”
Dean suddenly got up and ambled off to the fridge. When he returned, he had a glass of milk, which he placed next to Jack’s plate.
He sighed. “Jack called me his uncle today.”
Jack finished with his purchases and bid his friend goodbye (his name was Tim, apparently). He spotted Dean lingering behind him and flitted over.
“Yeah, thanks to Jack.” Sam beamed. “Including you. Why didn’t you tell us you were alive?”
The couple was frowning now.
Sam briefly shot them a grin before following the kid to what appeared to be a thrift store. (Dean released a sigh of relief at this. He had nothing against name-brand stores and they could pretty much afford anything now with their limitless credit cards, but it was the principle of the thing!)
Death at their heels. The dark dungeon. A smiling Castiel covered in black goo.
“Dean, are you alright?” He felt Castiel’s hand wrap around his arm and he met the angel’s eyes of concern.
So, he held his tongue and allowed the Winchesters to whisk Jack away to the entertainment room after dinner while he offered to clean up and do the dishes. The chore was always rather calming so he didn’t mind it. Compared to everything he did for Heaven, this was a mundane task and he enjoyed it. Kelly never allowed him to do the dishes when he visited her and Jack in their heaven.
“Sure, I’ll get Sam and Cas. Meet you there.”
And they weren’t the only ones. Now, the Klines could, too.
The next two hours were a flurry of activity in the kitchen. Pasta simmered in the pot. Chicken baked in the oven. And leaves and veggies were chopped for a salad (because Sam would complain if there wasn’t some kind of healthy food on the table).
“I almost killed you, man. I played into Chuck’s games and I almost killed you.” His throat was tightening again and tears came unbidden to his eyes that he quickly wiped away. “You’re our kid… and I almost killed you.”
The two went to the bakery where they picked up an apple pie, went back to the car (they just made it before their time was up), and headed home.
“Say ‘hi’ to the kid for us? And Bobby, too. Mom and Dad. Charlie.”
That was new. It was almost enough to get Dean out of his current headspace.
“Where are Cas and Sam?” the redhead asked, looking behind Dean, as if expecting the two other bunker inhabitants to show up.
Jack decided that he liked it. And he really liked Claire.
But, truth be told, he’s scared. There’s so much he still wants to do. So many monsters to slay. Places to see. New pie flavors he’s yet to try.
“You’re here,” he finally says, his voice much better than it was the last time.
Was either of them even equipped to raise a child? A family?
“Principal Chan, Jack Kline’s guardians are here.”
The blonde, in turn, stuck a tongue out at her.
That got a smile and a soft chuckle from the kid. “Do you remember that time you guys took me to the park and I wanted to try that fancy cotton candy?”
Finally, Castiel lowered the napkin. He held Dean’s chin and gently tilted it to the side, examining him.
Fear appeared on Castiel’s face. “Dean-.”
“Really?” said the blonde, in disbelief. “Why?”
When Dean looked up, Sam was staring at him, eyebrow raised.
In the morning, after a light breakfast of bagels and coffee, Dean and Sam got dressed in their FBI getup.
Finally, Dean spoke. “Nah, you can go back to the others. There’s more beer in the fridge if you want. Juice for the kids, too. Don’t take the grape, though, that’s for Jack’s lunch.”
Jack winced, feeling embarrassed all of a sudden. No one else’s parents around him were taking photos.
True. They couldn’t really take him with them, they had no idea how long this case was gonna take and he still had school.
But, when he leaves the hospital, Castiel also leaves.
“Um, hi.”
And then, finally, gathering everything he needed to summon a demon and driving to the nearest crossroads. Sam managed to stop him, pleading with him not to do it. It was a bad idea, he said, Castiel and Jack wouldn’t want him to do this. Sam would personally call Rowena and put a stop to the deal if he had to.
Miracle was in the corner, playing with a stuffed monkey, not paying him any attention.
“But, Dean, these tomatoes are organic.”
And, then, he feels, hears, and smells it all at once like a giant punch to the gut.
The change in subject was abrupt but it made Sam sit up. “Yeah? What do you got?”
The angel seemed to contemplate this before nodding. “Okay, I will think about it.”
Dean got ready to explain. “That’s because…” He paused. “Huh… I actually have no idea either.”
Dean snorted, almost choking on his ice cream.
That information made Dean grin. He always knew that if given the chance, those two would have been a powerful force. He still regretted their endings but this gave him some comfort. He couldn’t wait to tell Sam.
Dean chuckled as he swiped his card. “Just stating a fact, sweetheart.”
“If you need anything, anything at all, you have all our numbers. Just call or text us, okay?”
“Eat up, kid, you’re gonna have a long day,” he said.
He turned his head to see Castiel looking like he wanted to disagree but a smile was tugging at the angel’s lips.
Fat load that did him, he still stayed in the life as an expert, got caught up in Dean and Sam’s mess, and died, anyway.
“Of course! We’re a local honey farm that just opened up and we raise and cultivate our own hives. A completely family business.”
“I’m gonna grab some stuff from storage.”
Dean looked stiff but Sam noticed that he didn’t deny the husband and dad comment. That was progress.
He may no longer want to be directly involved but, maybe he could still help.
She beamed at him as he handed her phone back, feeling the prick of guilt for using his powers on her.
“Ughhh, I am
“I… kind of miss her,” Jack admitted, deflating a little. “I hope she’s not mad at me.”
The boy was practically sparkling at that idea. “I’d like to have new friends.”
The tension in the hunter’s shoulders eased. “Yeah?”
Dean continued to watch as Castiel walked the girls to the room they were staying at, only a couple of doors from Jack’s. Castiel seemed to hesitate, at first, but then pulled Claire into his arms. He whispered something to her that Dean couldn’t hear and kissed her hair. The blonde returned his hug, burying her face into his shoulder. She must have said something in return because Castiel chuckled as he rubbed her back.
“I’m not hiding, I just-.”
“I guess…” The boy let out a breath before breaking into a smile. “I almost forgot to ask. How is Eileen?”
By the time they arrived in Denver, it was late. They checked in to a motel, pick up some food, and rested to prepare for the harrowing day they were going to have the next day. They rehearsed and went over the details of Jack’s plan one last time before going to bed.
Castiel visibly swallowed. “Why?”
The sudden change in Amara’s expression was subtle but Jack had learned how to look for it. Right now, she seemed rather surprised and he couldn’t blame her. Everyone didn’t understand why he did what he did. Heck, even he didn’t understand his own impulsive decision.
Whenever John dropped them off at Bobby’s, it was the only time Dean and Sam ever got three square meals a day. And, sometimes, Bobby let Dean help. Sure, it was usually just heating up a can of soup or boiling pasta that they slapped some store-bought bottle of sauce over. But, it made Dean proud to have made something that Sam eventually enjoyed eating. And Bobby always complimented him.
Dean flinched at that and cleared his throat. “You’re annoying.”
Jack looked up and stared again in the direction of the teenagers. “The responsibility,” he replied. “Everyone expects so much from me. And if I make a mistake, the whole world will suffer.”
Castiel looked into his eyes. “And what is it that you want, Dean?”
“Oh.”
Satisfied, Dean settled on the seat next to Castiel. They waited in silence, side-by-side, until the door opened and out stepped Jack, looking very pleased with himself. He was wearing a wine red button-down shirt, a black blazer, and black jeans.
“Or I can go with you,” Dean answered.
He flashed a curious look at the blonde again, who was giving him a disturbingly cold gaze. She hadn’t spoken, yet. Her eyes were familiar, though. Where had Jack seen those eyes?
“You were in a Robotics Club?!” Eileen was giggling, trying not to drop her beer bottle.
Subtly, Jack’s expression changed, from looking like a kicked puppy to a confused puppy. His head even slightly tilted to the side, the same way Castiel’s often did. It made Dean smile a little.
“Fine.”
“But, something did change,” said Jack, careful of his words.
At that, Dean quickly sat up, panic clear in his eyes. “You’re coming back, though, right? ‘Cause Cas, buddy… If you don’t come back I… I don’t know if I can…”
Sam shut his laptop down, closed it, and placed it on his bedside table. Then, he waited.
Sam cleared his throat, wondering if he could take it back. But, Eileen was looking at him with an expectant face and he couldn’t lie to her.
So he ate, made merry, and enjoyed himself that Thanksgiving day, surrounded by the people he loved and treasured.
Sam glared at him before turning back to Jack. “As I was saying, if you have a hobby or a subject or sport you’re interested in, most likely, a school will offer it as an activity.”
With Jack sitting across from him and Dean, it felt like nothing had changed in the past year at all, except for the dog sitting at Jack’s feet and the empty space where the fourth member of Team Free Will 2.0 usually sat.
He opened his eyes and turned to face the brothers.
Castiel returned the hug. “You’re welcome. Now, head on to bed. I’ll return as soon as I can.”
He had died. He went to heaven, apparently. And heaven was different.
“We are giving Jack one year to do what he wishes. He can stay on Earth, go to school, whatever he wants. And, after a year, you and he will return here and resume your duties. He will be the Winchesters’ responsibility and you will act as his messenger, Castiel. We expect monthly reports on his health and how he’s coping. If he is, at any point at all, in danger, or his true nature is discovered, you will both return to Heaven, immediately.”
Jack missed this. And he couldn’t wait to have dinner with all three of them again. But, first, there was something he needed to do.
When Dean opens his eyes, he’s holding nothing but air. The room is empty. Castiel is gone.
Dean pulled the handkerchief down to his chin. “Hey, kid, back so soon?”
Jack bit his lip. “It was very tempting.”
Sam’s heart did a little flip. “She’s good. She just texted me, actually. She just finished a case and is on her way home. And… uh…”
Just as Dean was finishing up with the last of the potatoes and Charlie was pouring the cornbread batter into the pan, a new figure into the kitchen.
That silenced Sam. What?! How could the angels not like Jack?! Didn’t they once try to kidnap him so he could do what they wanted?! And, he wasn’t just powerful, he was a sweet and loving kid with a kind heart! What else could they ask for in an almighty leader?
“She’s kidding,” Kaia said, flashing Claire a scolding look.
When he lifts his head, Castiel is watching him in that close and examining way he often does. As if he’s taking a photo of Dean and imprinting it in his memory.
“I assumed with all your renovations, you’d be occupied. I don’t mind. I took a nice road trip to the countryside.” She snapped her fingers and a tan bucket hat appeared in her hands, which she proceeded to plop into Jack’s head. “Your face will get sunburned without proper protection.”
For a moment, Dean was taken back to a cherished memory. Of sitting on a lumpy couch at a random boutique, “Walking On Sunshine” playing through the speakers of an iPhone. And an excited innocent smile greeting him after every sweep of the fitting room curtains, posing and showing off. The cute pout when he turned off the music and the insistence of getting her “montage.”
Man, their life was weird.
“We should hurry,” he muttered, pushing his cart towards the cashiers. “This pizza sauce takes two hours to make and-.”
“It was for a month! And we didn’t really do anything-.”
“Dean…" Castiel's eyes sparkled with mischief. "You are getting better at expressing your feelings.”
“Mr. Kline.” The woman – the principal – tilted her head in acknowledgment. “It’s very nice to meet you, though I wish it were under better circumstances.” She held out a hand for Castiel to shake, who took it. Then, her gaze moved to Dean, curiously. “And, sir, you are…?”
He flashed grateful looks at Gabriel and Kelly.
Sam bought the one with the pulp again. What a bitch.
“That sounds reasonable,” he agreed. “And it will prepare me for when you and Sam return to hunting.”
It was one of Dean’s, Jack realized. He had seen the hunter wear the Pink Floyd shirt to bed before. Now, Castiel was wearing it.
“You’re not useless.”
As if reading his thoughts (maybe he was) Jack continued, “He said he didn’t want to force himself back into your lives... Oh… I think I wasn’t supposed to tell you that.”
“Wait… Rowena? Our Rowena?”
Before Dean could even ask, Jack turned on his heels and left the room.
Dean could hug him… or throttle him. He hadn’t decided, yet.
“He’s there?” Eileen asked and Sam nodded at her.
Both Dean and Jack looked up.
Jack nodded and hurried off to his room. For some reason, his backpack felt heavier. Or maybe that was the air of exhaustion. He still had homework, a test to study for, lines to memorize, and a list of Christmas shopping to finish. So much came with being a human and Jack was sure that if it wasn’t for his God powers and angel grace sustaining him, he’d be burned out.
“Alrighty, everybody out!” Dean barked.
Jack wiped his suddenly sweaty palms on his jeans. “The other day, after Cas and I got back from the movies… you guys talked.”
“Yes. Jack wanted to do something and since you and Sam were not gonna be home for a while, we thought of spending the day out.”
“Merry Christmas.”
The girl who was playing Mary, Angie, huffed. “It sounds weird, Mr. Turner! Can’t we change it to, like, something simpler?”
Did the kid even need permission to leave Heaven? He practically ruled the Earth and cosmos!
Jack swallowed. “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
Casey boo-ed. “Jocks… I’m friends with jocks!” she lamented.
“Where do you wanna do this?” Dean asked as they descended the bunker stairs.
The endearment just came out and instead of the weird, flopping, unpleasant feeling he used to get in his stomach when it slipped, there was only warmth now. Affection. As well as a deep feeling of joy and freedom that he finally allowed himself to have this.
Sam turned the camera back to himself. “Yeah, it’s been a pretty good day. I mean, wow, we rarely get one of those you know. It’s… nice.”
His memories of his brief stint with Harper still haunted him, even if that time was all pretend.
Now that that’s out of the way, there’s another matter that’s niggling in the back of Dean’s mind.
“Yeah, Dean went to a couple of my plays.”
“Wait, you’re leaving tonight?!” Jack sounded panicked.
He heard quick footsteps echoing from the hall and in just a minute, Sam appeared, Jack trailing along behind him.
Sam nodded.
Sam had made a copy of the one he had at home on his side table. Despite how happy he was with his decision to take a break and live a normal life on Earth for a while, he still missed his mother.
They arrived at the school and it took a few minutes to find an empty parking spot. Who knew how many kids actually drove to school? His car looked a bit odd among the last two decades or so’s models.
“It’s very nice,” he concluded before squinting. “I think you should wear a tie."
Castiel still refuses to look at him.
Dean held out his hand in a silent request for Sam to hand his gun over to him. Sam tossed it to him and then retrieved a knife from his back pocket.
So that was how Dean found himself driving up I-25, Metallica playing from the deck and his brother recounting the details of the case in the passenger seat. It felt oddly empty without anyone sitting in the back. Dean caught himself looking into the rearview mirror a few times, expecting to see Castiel looking out the window with a peaceful look and Jack reading or playing on his phone.
Jack immediately recited his backstory. “I was homeschooled. When my mother died, custody was given to my Uncle and I moved here with him.”
A throat clears and Sam comes into view again. “I’m gonna go get a coffee. Cas, you want one?”
So, Dean just shrugged and checked the time on his phone. “We can go after lunch. Cas should be back by then. Sound good?”
He had everything he needed laid out on the map table, arranged in an easy-to-reach-and-grab order. Tomorrow was Christmas Eve and they were all driving down to Sioux Falls to spend it with Jody and the girls. He had cookies all baked and packed in a Tupperware box and ready to go. And, now, he was supposed to clean his guns.
And just like that, the meal began and it was, well, rowdy.
After one last handshake for both of them, the principal escorted them to the door of her office. It closed shut behind them. Castiel led the way to the front desk where he spoke to the woman, Miss Picoult, and signed Jack out for the day.
When everyone was in the kitchen again, they made the pizzas. Dean filled his pizza with so much pepperoni, ham, and sausage that he feared it would be too heavy and take more time to cook. Meanwhile, Sam had used his own low-fat cheese on his (the heathen!) and topped it with mostly vegetables – peppers, mushrooms, and onions. Castiel stuck to just cheese.
Instead, he found himself putting down the box of pasta by the counter and sitting across from his brother.
“Things were hectic,” he carefully answered. “I know that’s not an excuse. But, Claire, he’s happy that you’re here. He insisted on getting like five boxes of those Cosmic Brownies at the store ‘cause he knows how much you like them. And he practically barked at Sam to make sure he only used the cleanest and freshest sheets for your room. Trust me, Claire, he’s ecstatic that you’re here.”
Sam’s eyes flew back to Dean.
It was nice. He hoped Castiel could join them next time. Maybe at those batting cages Dean mentioned. It would be funny to see the angel attempt to play baseball.
Jack didn’t like how sad his two friends (surely, Claire was a friend now, right?) looked and felt an overwhelming need to offer them some comfort.
Dean handed it over without a word and Castiel made his way to the cashier.
Dean caught his eye, looking confused. “It does?”
“I know that! I know… okay? I’m God. I get it. But, I can’t help it, Cas. I want to go to school.”
Principal Chan seemed caught off-guard at the show of remorse. “It’s alright, Jack,” she said, gently.
Sam never thought they’d ever have a day like this. Just him, basking under the sun. Dean and Jack playing catch. Miracle running around.
Nonetheless, he jumped on Kaia to give her a hug. And when she returned it, he realized that he was about her height now instead of taller like he was before.
“Let’s go!” Jack piped, waving at them. “Casey and Zayn are already inside!”
A gentle hand under his chin broke Sam out of his thoughts and he looked down to look at Eileen.
Finally, Jack relaxed under his hand. He nodded. “Okay.”
“She… she told me I was wrong. She said… I had no business being God if that was the way I run things. That I was just a kid who didn’t know anything.” He opened his eyes, his vision blurring from unshed tears. “I think she’s right. I’m just a kid, Amara. I don’t know what I’m doing. I thought I could do this. I thought… I could be God. But… it’s just so hard. And I’m so tired.”
“Something’s going on with that kid,” added Dean.
“Um, I don’t know.” Jack’s fingers played with the end of his fork, his waffle now a sad mess as it drowned in sugar and syrup. “I didn’t really think this far ahead. It was sort of… out of the blue.”
Jack hummed again, but not saying anything more. He was probably worried about accidentally spilling more information he wasn’t mean to say to anyone else.
“Yeah, do good today, kid.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m thankful for that, too, Cas,” said Dean. “I don’t think I ever did. Thank you, that is. I’m a piece of shit, sometimes.”
“Delicious,” Castiel said, immediately.
Why was everyone going back to school? Dean never saw the appeal. He took a second to think if
He cleared his throat and pulled at his shirt collar as he mumbled, “Thanks.”
“You… uh… didn’t tell us he was alive.”
He couldn’t believe that they forgot about him! Whatever!
He trailed off.
Dean snapped his fingers and pointed at the angel, stating, “See?!” He felt validated.
“…. Yes.”
Wait… was Sam a third wheel? Had he been a third wheel this whole time and not even realize it?!
Luckily, the dog was nowhere in sight, probably napping in Jack’s room or in playing with his toys in the Dean Cave.
“Jack! Hey Jack! Over here!”
Dean looked startled at the revelation. “We’re not overstepping, are we? ‘Cause, Cas, that’s not what we were trying to do.”
Now that Dean had gotten that off his chest, he felt a tad bit lighter.
“Is everything alright, Dean? Your voicemail was distressed and you sounded weak on the phone. Did something happen? Do you need-.”
“She’s said that too, didn’t she? Your Charlie?”
Dean managed a small smile, unable to meet her eyes. So he fixed his gaze firmly on the potatoes. “Yeah… yeah, she did.”
“That was sick, dude!” said the boy. “I didn’t know you could punch like that!”
“So… werewolf?” Sam guessed.
Sam felt his mouth drop open. “Dean? What are you doing back so soon?”
“Nah, it’s fine. Let him mingle.”
Castiel and Eileen were watching the game of “Apples to Apples”, babbling babies on their laps.
“Kelly and Jack have no remains,” Sam said, as gently as he could. “But, she left these. It’s only right that we return them to you.”
Then, Dean and Eileen had taken him shopping for school supplies – a new backpack, notebooks, pens and paper, a lunchbox, and new clothes. It was surprisingly fun shopping with them, Jack had never done it before and the experience was memorable. Dean was very good at picking bargains.
“I know that I sometimes leave to do my duties but I always come back.”
“I could have flown, you know.”
Jack blinked at the blonde, who tried to appear nonchalant. “Me?” he asked, thrilled at the fact.
What little blood he had left rushes to his cheeks. He hopes Sam and Castiel don’t notice.
Castiel’s mouth fell slightly open, clearly stunned. “Dean, I…” He trailed off.
“There’s something I need to talk to you and Cas and Sam about.”
“Hey! Look at you all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed!” Dean hollered from the stove.
Dean understood that she may be feeling betrayed, like she wasn’t even important enough to know this important fact. After all, he had felt the same.
Perhaps, Sam had spoken too soon.
With one hand still on Miracle’s fur, Dean lifted the mug to his lips and took a sip, letting out a contented sigh when he tasted the slightly bitter coffee. It warmed him up from his head to the tips of his toes as the caffeine woke his brain up.
He made it to his room, locked the door behind him and Miracle, and walked up to his bed. He settled in the middle, cross-legged. Meanwhile, Miracle took up residency at the end. Jack smiled fondly at the dog before looking straight ahead at the empty wall. Taking a deep breath, he closed his eyes and emptied his mind.
The nearest mall was a strip mall – it wasn’t huge but it had a couple of name-brand clothing stores, mom and pop shops, and some restaurants. Dean and Eileen had taken Jack shopping here for school supplies months ago so the kid already knew where he wanted to go.
“Okay,” he finally relented, meeting Dean’s gaze. “I’ll tell you everything you want to know.”
Dean cleared his throat as he reached for the remote. “Yeah, uh, let’s go back to… uh… What’s the last thing you remember?”
Claire snorted and waved in dismissal with a hand. “Yeah, yeah. Kaia talked about you, like, all the time. She said Cas and the Winchesters adopted you. So, I figured I might as well.”
“I’m telling you now!”
Dean laughed. “Heya, Sammy.”
Behind him, he could hear Sam reassuring Jack that he could stay as long as he liked. Where else would he even go? It wasn’t like the kid had other friends or family to stay with.
Jack definitely had questions for Uncle Gabe.
That wasn’t what Jack was apologizing for but he could only nod.
“I didn’t want this! I didn’t want to be God! But, it was the only way to save everyone! But, I didn’t want this!”
Sam wasn’t certain if Dean was joking or not. His brother often hid behind jokes and sarcasm to hide what he was really thinking and feeling. Feelings and chick flick moments, after all, were not Dean’s forte.
Castiel was nothing if not persistent. When he got his head on about something, he pursued it until he got an answer. Dean should have learned that by now.
Castiel let out an involuntary sigh. “He… let out some of his grievances. It was quite eye-opening.”
“Cas? Jack?”
Yeah, he had been off. In fact, Dean had a lot of thoughts on his mind. Ever since Jack's school dance, and even more so last night with the woman (Kara or Kiara, he wasn’t sure), he couldn’t stop thinking about himself, what he wanted, and what he needed in his life.
Dean seemed like he was in a good mood. He was always in a good mood, nowadays. Maybe it had something to do with him and Castiel always kissing. They didn’t know that Jack knew about that. But, he walked in on them in the kitchen once and Jack felt awkward interrupting their kiss for a snack so he just left and went back hours later.
How did you get out of the Empty? Was there a way all along and they hadn’t known? Why didn't he back come sooner?
He picked up his knife and together with Dean, they led Jack into the kitchen where the food still waited for them.
“Bet that’s not the only thing you missed,” muttered Sam.
But, he would worry about them on another day.
Jack attached a leash to Miracle’s collar and together with Sam, they headed up the stairs. The door closed with a ‘bang’ behind them, leaving Castiel by his lonesome in the map room. He considered looking for Dean but the bunker was huge, he could be anywhere. Castiel could try to use his powers and locate him but he had the feeling that Dean wouldn’t appreciate it.
Smiling, Castiel nodded and walked off to explore. Dean watched him until he disappeared between racks of jeans and jackets. For a second, he considered going after him to help. But, he held himself in place. There was no need to follow after Castiel like a puppy, the angel had a mind of his own.
Sighing and giving in, Dean put his spoon down and managed a smile. “I was in the Wrestling team when I was living at a boys’ home for about two months. And I was also pretty decent at baseball.”
Zayn laughed again. He seemed to laugh a lot but Jack could tell the laughter wasn’t aimed at him. Maybe Jack was amusing him.
Castiel noticed, immediately. “Dean, where are you going?”
“Yes,” he said, breathily, as he pulled on the collar and met Dean’s lips into another kiss.
Instead, he shrugs.
Proudly, Dean heaved the turkey over and set it on the large empty spot in the middle of the table. The whole table clapped and the attention made his cheeks redden, for some reason.
Frozen yogurt did sound nice so Jack agreed. He got into the backseat of the girls’ car. Claire drove and Kaia was in the passenger seat. Kaia asked him questions about school and Jack answered and talked about his day.
He had his Free Will back and he was going to use it to create a new life for himself and Castiel. So, after looking around the area, he got a job as a mechanic at the town garage – he was always pretty good at fixing up cars. The money wasn’t much but at least it was legal this time. No more stealing credit cards and identity theft for him.
Their house was small. Their jobs were mundane. They had an everyday routine.
“You’re a great dad, Cas.”
They didn’t have to wait long. Jack ambled out through the doors, backpack behind him, lunchbox in one hand, and a heavy-looking textbook in the other. He noticed Dean looking pointedly at the book.
And Amara had been there for him ever since.
“I’m curious.”
The drive took a little over ten minutes since there was some traffic but they all made it to school in one piece. There were many cars parked in front of the brick building, including two large yellow buses.
A bitter lump occupied his throat and Dean swallowed it. He looked down at the chocolate-y milk and cereal, no longer in the mood to finish it.
“Yes, Dean.”
“Thanks, Dean!”
Who was now God.
“… So we figured we’d stop here for the night since it was on the way.” Kaia smiled at her. “Claire wanted to meet you so we volunteered to pick you up from school.”
A beat passed. Then two.
“…are a very lovely couple.”
“But, hunting keeps me busy, ya know? Wards off thinking about home.”
Then, Dean turned his back to him and Sam knew the conversation was over.
Amara got to her feet. “That’s your cue.”
“Oh,” the kid said. He raised his eyes, meekly. “What for?”
“I am.”
Very light touches, at first.
Sam wanted to glare at him but he couldn't take his eyes off the boy.
Sam cleared his throat. “Do you want some frozen yogurt?” he asked, before mentally kicking himself.
“What? What is it?” Dean demanded, sounding impatient.
Castiel sighed, not happy about relaying this news, either. “Heaven is still recovering. We can’t afford to have you gone for too long. But, don’t worry, Michael has assigned me to be your guardian. I am to give them monthly reports about your status so I will be making frequent trips to Heaven.”
At the mention of his surrogate daughter, Castiel couldn’t help but smile. He did miss her.
“Yeah. Send him out with Miracle if he’s done eating.”
“I care about you, Dean.”
Dean’s stomach churned.
“I… Thank you… I think?”
There was some ruffling of clothing and an answer, “I’m fine!”
Castiel made his way down the halls to the room that was previously used by whoever was in charge to receive and answer prayers. Jack preferred to listen to prayers outdoors, surrounded by trees, grass, and bees. Even the angels he assigned to hear and answer prayers didn’t like using the room so they had to use it for something else. Now, it served as a sort of board room for important meetings.
“It’s the fact that I scarred Jack so much that he thinks I don’t want to be his dad!”
“I’m fine, I promise,” Jack replied.
As he placed the last plate on the rack, Castiel returned to the kitchen, dressed in a polo shirt, jeans, sneakers, and a tan leather jacket. He had stopped wearing the trench coat a while ago, but the sight of him without it still made Dean pause.
It wasn’t. It was Dean and he had sent a photo.
Silently, the two men ate.
“I’ve never met your parents, Claire. But, I’ve visited their Heaven. And they have some of the purest souls I’ve ever seen. So, I’m certain that if they were here now, they would love you no less than they always have.”
Dean was sprawled on his bed on top of the covers, mouth ajar with drool dripping out of one side, and surrounded by empty beer bottles.
With those last two words, Mrs. Kline wailed and fell into her husband’s arms. The sound pierced Sam’s heart.
“It’s me.”
“Okay, good,” Sam said with a nod. “I’ll go get his stuff, then. You gonna clean up here?”
The angel appeared to hesitate, looking from the stall and to Jack’s back, walking ahead of them.
“Of course, you’re smart, Dean,” said Castiel.
Once again, Dean was alone in the kitchen, watching the timer of the oven slowly ticking. It felt like forever. Finally, the timer ding-ed. Dean donned oven mitts (ugly little orange things with sunflowers on them but Castiel had picked it up during one of their shopping trips one day and fell in love) and carefully pulled the steaming hot turkey out of the oven. He placed it on the counter, fanning the steam away with his hand.
“Alright,” Dean acquiesced. “Well, if you’re not gonna take the dog out for a walk, why don’t you head on over to the Dean Cave and watch a movie, hmm? They added new stuff on Netflix. And that show you like… Juliet and something…”
Castiel had no doubt that Dean would go through with the threat. The hunter was angry, yes, but he had every reason to be. Castiel did hurt him. And he owed Dean answers. He couldn’t ignore the situation between them forever.
She laughed and settled back into his arms again.
“You should visit more often,” Dean quietly said. “I think Jack would like it. He can’t exactly bring friends over, you know. He's probably sick of hanging out with just the three of us. And I know Cas would like to see you more.”
His brother smiled, looking relieved. Did Sam really think Dean was gonna send Jack packing?! Thanks for the vote of confidence, bro.
Castiel shakes his head. “Everything you did… everything you sacrificed… You saved the world. You and Sam. And you both deserve to see the fruits of your labor. You’re still needed here on Earth, Dean.”
“Because… I think it would be… nice.”
Speaking of…
“Jack,” Amara interrupted his attempt to ramble, gently.
Castiel nodded. “Me neither, Dean. But, it’s happened now. And all we can do is try to support him.”
Sam blinked. “Okay, what’s weird about that?”
To his surprise, Dean chuckled, humorlessly. “Nothing happened.”
“Uh huh.”
“Bitch. See you later.”
“Yeah… yeah, you’re right, Sam. I just… I dunno. It just…” Dean’s words trailed off.
"I’m really excited. We’ve never celebrated Thanksgiving as a family before.”
Excitedly, Jack took his hoard to the counter, a skip in his steps. It made Dean smile to see him so happy about something that was just so… normal. Not for the first time, he was glad that Jack got this chance to just be a kid.
“Oh, man, remember that girl I told you about from my Physics class?”
“Jack, why?” added Castiel, shocked.
And, then, Jack offered to release her.
They discussed what they needed to do to prepare a while longer until it was finally time for Dean and Jack to get going. Castiel handed Jack his lunch box, kissed his forehead, and wished him a good day before turning to Dean and asking him to drive safely, to which Dean responded with an, “I always do” before winking at the angel.
A flash of guilt crossed Castiel’s face. Dean wanted the ground to swallow him up. Meanwhile, the kids in the Breakfast Club were having fun smoking weed. He could really use a blunt now, even if he hadn’t smoked since he was 16. It got in the way of his concentration during hunts.
Jack beamed and wrapped him in a hug, the hot bag of Chinese food in his hands bumping against Dean’s back. Dean looked up and caught Castiel’s fond gaze. The angel was holding a similar bag.
But, it was no matter. Castiel would let it go for now. Besides, Dean was already changing the subject to the pizza he was excited to make so Castiel settled in and listened.
Civil.
“He’s here,” Sam said from behind Dean, his knife at his side. He was looking at Castiel like he could see all three of his true form’s heads. “He arrived three days ago. What the hell is going on, Cas?! We thought you were dead! Why did Jack run away?!”
“Jack?” Dean called out as he approached. “Why are you awake at four in the morning?”
“A man after my own heart, Cas!”
Jack looked confused. “Um, I didn’t leave.”
In the War Room. The kitchen. The halls. Everywhere in the bunker. He just paced.
“And can you grab another case of beer, please? Thanks.”
Out front, the Impala sat where it always did, waiting for him. Jack gave Casey one last hug goodbye before making his way to the car. In the driver’s seat, Dean was bopping his head along to the music.
Dean raised an eyebrow, skeptical. God didn’t need food or even sleep. Jack told them that both were merely habits now that he wasn’t keen on breaking – it made him feel normal.
Eileen flashed him a teasing look. “It sounds like you’re not used to your downtime.”
Dean’s eye twitched. “What now?”
Jack nodded. “Okay.”
“Maybe not today,” Jack replied, a little disappointed. “I’ve got a lot of homework.”
Castiel hadn’t even tried to bring it up.
“Sammy.”
But, even with the angel sitting across from him, drinking whiskey and meeting his eyes (a bit ashamed… good!), Dean still thought he was in some kind of fevered dream. For a moment, he even considered the possibility that he was on a Djinn hunt gone wrong and he was now stuck forever unless he took a knife to himself. But, he dismissed that idea fairly quickly, especially when Castiel started talking about… well… everything.
Dean released Miracle from her leash and she immediately padded over to her pillow by the fireplace. Meanwhile, Dean went back upstairs and finally jumped into the shower.
“Detention? Like in ‘The Breakfast Club’?” Castiel asked.
“Great. Great. I’ll go make dinner.”
Reluctantly, Dean pulled away so he could look at the angel’s face but kept his arms around the latter’s waist. He looked into Castiel’s curious blue eyes and felt his heart leap at the sight. He worried that he wouldn’t see those eyes ever again.
The hunter winked at him and Castiel rolled his eyes. “Yes, of course, I expect no less from you.” He scanned the room. “Will you be doing the same tonight? There seem to be plenty of interested women. Though you should be careful that none of them are married or already committed.”
The angel nodded and turned back to the woman then asked for five jars of honey and a jar of apple butter. What they would need five jars of honey for, Dean didn’t know. But, he was perfectly fine handing over a couple of bills to cover the cost.
The hunter’s heart nearly stuttered at the familiar voice. “Y-Yeah?”
“Thanks, Dean. And it’s not like I’m moving out tomorrow.”
“Jack?” he called out.
“Shut, up jerk!”
Castiel’s hands trailed up to the hunter’s collar.
“Dean, I don’t understand,” Castiel said, at some point during the character introductions. “The title implies that they are in a club that eats breakfast. Yet, they are not eating breakfast, at all.”
“I found a really good recipe for homemade pizza ages ago and I’ve been dying to try it,” Dean replied, stopping at a fridge to examine its contents. “Claire and Kaia are visiting us for the first time so I wanna make dinner special. Didn’t you miss Claire?”
God knows he doesn’t belong in heaven. But, then again, if Jack’s in charge now, maybe he’ll get special treatment.
“You shouldn’t be moving this much, yet,” the angel scolds, fondly.
“That’s… that’s really good to know.”
He rummaged through their supply closet to grab a broom, feather duster, some rags, and a box of trash bags. He tied a handkerchief over his nose and mouth and beat the dust out of the mattress with the broom. Then, he cleaned the side tables and the desk, the dust and dirt caking all the rags and creating a mountain of filth on the floor. He was in the middle of gathering these into a trash bag when Jack wandered into the room.
“S-Sometimes,” Jack hiccupped, as he raised his head to look at Castiel with hurt and hardened eyes.
Dean simply hummed in response.
“It helps if you have a copy of your schedule on your locker door,” said Zayn. “They’ll give you your schedule in Homeroom.”
“And that’s why you’re going back to Heaven to talk to the archangels.”
Dean chuckled and shook his head. “Damnit, that should be annoying but you make it so damn cute.”
He didn’t know how long they kissed for but by the time they had pulled apart, Sam couldn’t stop smiling. He reluctantly released her from his hold so he could sign to her.
The three stared at him, as if he had grown a second head. Jack knew angels’ true forms could have up to five heads (Castiel, himself, had three) but since he was half-human, he didn’t have one so he knew they weren’t seeing that.
Castiel glared at the clear plastic bag of non-organic tomatoes in the hunter’s clutches. Why Dean was choosing to be stubborn, he had no clue. The ones Castiel had picked out were clearly the superior breed but Dean balked at the extra dollar in the price tag. It wasn’t like they didn’t have the money, they were still using Charlie’s magic credit cards. So, he wondered if Dean simply fought with him for the sake of arguing. And pride. Definitely pride.
Since all his things were already packed and it was just an excuse to give Jack and Castiel some alone time, they laid on his bed for a while. He held her as they talked about everything and nothing on. They discussed the case, the leads, and the victims in between stolen kisses and shy touches.
Dean raised a brow at her. “And that’s a surprise?”
They worked in silence for maybe a minute or two before Charlie, chatterbox that she was in any version and incarnation, spoke up again.
Pushing open the door of Jack’s old room, Dean took a moment to look around. They hadn’t gone back in this room for a whole year. The mattress was probably dusty, as well as the furniture. It would need some cleaning, vacuuming, and fresh sheets before Jack could settle in. Some of his old stuff were in storage – Jack’s clothes, laptop, books, that creepy talking teddy bear, and Kelly’s picture. Maybe Dean could send Sam down to get them while he cleaned up.
Eileen’s smile grew wider and her signing got excited. “Great! I’ll see you then!” She bit her lip before signing, “I love you.”
“Well… you weren’t in the best place, man.”
As he tried to decide on what to do, he caught Dean’s eye from where the latter was standing at the refreshment table. He was smiling, amused, so at least Dean wasn’t mad.
Dean went back to his cereal and the rest of breakfast went smoothly. After he finished eating, Jack took Miracle out on a walk. Meanwhile, Dean washed the dishes and thought about what they could have for lunch.
Castiel welcomed it, wrapping the tiny woman in a friendly hug. She looked as lovely as she ever was. Her hair was shorter than the last time he had seen her, reaching the tips of her shoulder now.
There was a short pause of just pure silence.
Frowning, Castiel turned to him. “Jack, we have to go home.”
“Of course not, Jack. Maybe a little upset that you didn’t confide in her and left suddenly but she’s happy that you’re making strides towards your education.” He placed a hand on the boy’s shoulder, squeezing it gently. “She only wishes she could be here to be a part of it. But, she placed you in my care so I won’t be leaving you, okay?”
To say that Dean was feeling gloomy was about right. Sure, he had fun during their day out. But, he still couldn’t stop thinking about what Jack said. That he thought Dean didn’t want to be his dad.
“Come here, you’re not going to be able to see from that far. You need to scoot closer.”
The double wooden doors in front of them open slowly revealing a big room with long wooden tables and benches. On the left there’s a long counter where food is served. The ceiling is beautifully painted with images of saints. It almost reminds Castiel of the Sistine Chapel. The light in the room comes from big, tall windows on the wall to the right, as well as from old lamps hanging from the ceiling.
Dean laughs and slaps Castiel on the back. “I knew you could do it. Literally though, I knew you could do it.”
“Alright Winchester. I accept your payment, but next time I want something grand.” Rowena bats her eyelashes at Dean, making Dean grimace under the flirtatious glance. Rowena was a pretty woman, but she was definitely not to Dean’s taste.
Dean snorts and with his tiny voice he winks and says “Yeah, if you try to pick me up I’ll bite you. Now, I need to rest. After I grant a wish it takes a lot out of me. I’m going to probably need about a week.”
“You’re peculiar, Dean Winchester. Alright, take a break. We’ll rendezvous shortly.” Charlie Bradbury orders as she begins to cover up the paints with makeshift lids. “Do not get your outfit dirty. I know how you men can be with that sort of thing. You're all filthy, and I mean that in the kindest way I can possibly say it.”
Castiel laughs playing off that he has no idea what this stranger is talking about. “Oh yeah, I still wasn’t feeling good. Yeah, when I said I pulled a double I meant I pulled a double shift leaning over the toilet puking.” Castiel laughs again as the stranger fixes their face in disgust.
Meg continues to gawk at the passing families and architecture. Meg pulls her seat back up so she can sit right in it. She rests her head back on the soft cushion. It feels like they drive around in circles and reach many dead ends before they finally find the right road they’re looking for. Castiel drives onward through a crosswalk until he reaches a gridiron fence covered in flowers and shrubbery.
“Whatever you want to do, I guess. That was the whole day I had planned. Hopefully, you took something from it and you continue with your music. I’m also hoping I can expect tickets to your next concert.” Castiel blinks back the tears starting to form at the corner of his eyes. He wants to spend more time with Dean. Dean wipes the fog off his window. “We’ll see what happens.”
Dean rolls his eyes before he jogs over to the door and walks in. The place is very cozy. Cozy meaning cramped with tons of people walking around everywhere juggling beers and cups of alcohol. “I hope you don’t expect me to perform here? These people are clearly not my fans. They look more like Kenny Chesney instead of Dean Smith.” Dean gives Castiel an incriminating side eye.
Castiel parks the Murano in front of the tall, intricately designed iron gate and gets out. He walks over to the keypad to punch in the security code the realtor provided them over the phone. He tries and fails several times punching in the code before the gate slowly opens. He walks back over to the car and gets in, shutting the door behind him.
“I’m here because I wanted to go over my tour dates and locations with you. If you’re going to be protecting me you’re going to need to know this stuff, am I right?”
“Great! Shall we?”
“I would love a glass of bourbon doll and for him water will do just fine.”
Castiel yawns again as he tries to follow the conversation. “Yeah hun, that’s neat, but I’m going to hit the hay.”
“Anything for a Winchester. Missouri, would you like to step out of the house for a while. I’m pretty sure you’d be bothered to sit here with the darkness. Especially for a person who only dabbles in light magic.” Rowena whisks the door open with her fingers creating an eerily cool draft.
“You don’t need
Happy reading!
Dean strolls back into the living room dressed and ready for whatever may come. He sits down on the sofa as Castiel arranges some papers on his coffee table. Castiel clears his throat and reaches out for Dean’s shoulder.
Dean looked at the shorter man in the black coat, Crowley, with confusion.
“What about me?”
Another alley, another shelter, another park it was the only constant. He pulled the newspapers up to his chin and laid there. His stomach growled, but he was exhausted. He just needed sleep. It was a routine now. Get up at the crack of dawn, knock on every window, and go in everywhere a now hiring sign was posted. There was always no luck as usual. Every manager or store owner that saw him didn’t think twice before kicking him out. There were no breaks and there were no miracles. This was his life. He had been on the streets for as long as he could remember. Growing up without his family was the toughest part. Everyone he once knew was gone. There were only a few, those special ones that made it out of poverty. Dean was not one of those people. He pulled the newspapers tighter to his chest and scooted closer to the brick wall. He used to have a cardboard box, but the stray cats always pissed on it. What was the use of sleeping in one when it ended up smelling like piss? With there being no showers until there was an opening at a shelter he couldn’t afford to take that risk. He closed his eyes and envisioned a steak, a home cooked meal, his family. All he needed was someone to care. It was even worse in this society. Alphas were supposed to be the top dogs. What kind of alpha was he sitting here wrapped in old newspaper sleeping in an alley? He closed his eyes and finally drifted off to sleep.
The omega rushed towards the back of the restaurant. Crowley continued looking at the menu. He looked up at Dean who was staring out at the neatly dressed restaurant goers.
“This is where you're throwing your next concert. You’ll be performing without pay, and you’ll be connecting up close and personal with people; Instead of thirty feet away from the front row at a big venue. This is where you started and this is where you need to start again.” Castiel saunters up to the building holding the door open for Dean, while screaming at the top of his lungs. “Are you coming or not? We made a promise. I have a day to get you back into music. The day’s not over.”
Meg ducks back into the bathroom again this time staying by the sink to rinse her toothbrush. She smiles at Castiel as she puts the toothbrush back up. “Oh, I called the realtor while you were dozing. I already set the alarm so once you lock the doors it should do its thing. There’s no code to it. She said it was like a silent alarm. Once it trips the police response time is generally around 15-20 minutes unless the owner of the house calls them off. It also only makes noise when someone opens a door or window from the inside. Cool huh?”
Dean speaks up hoping his voice isn't raspy from going a few hours of non use.
“I would like your lasagna and for my company the spaghetti.”
Dean blinks a few times and then looks at Sam.
“I'll be down in the limo. Lock it up before you come down.”
Castiel purses his lips into a smile and turns his head, rolling his eyes as his wife looks away. The drive down the road into the suburb is narrow and long. Soon, they’re met by houses of yellow, green, blue, tan, and red with brick and stone designs on them. They’re gigantic two and three story houses all arranged in a semicircle, making it look like a real cul de sac. Men mow their yards while their wives linger nearby. Kids ride bikes and play with chalk on sidewalks. Castiel can practically smell the chlorine in the air. It’s abnormally pleasant. Castiel pulls into a driveway in front of a tan brick house. It’s hard to think of anything to separate this house from all the others. They all look the same in some way, just with different colors. Maybe a garden or something would fix the uniformity, but where does anyone ever find the time to do that? Castiel turns off the car and exits the vehicle shutting the door with ease. He watches as Meg marches over to the sold sign on the freshly manicured lawn and pulls it out. She throws it into the black garbage can in front of their curb. “This house is officially owned. Yeah baby! Let's celebrate! Let’s say we go inside and christen some rooms and floors until the movers get here?”
Come visit and chat it up with
“Training has done you some good. I'm proud of you.”
“Hey, hey you! You with the newspapers!”
“Took you long enough. I thought I was going to have to come back up to get you.”
Gordon points at the paper making Dean's gaze drop down to the bottom. “Alpha Red is a series of genetic traits that all alphas possessed before it was literally wiped out of existence back in the 30’s. The government felt that it was safer for civilians if it didn’t exist. They created serums and vaccines that were administered at birth that would stop Alpha Red making it dormant. Penicillin and the AX vaccine went hand in hand. Alpha Red occurs when an alpha has an extra Y chromosome. So their genetic makeup would read XYY instead of XY, which make up male betas and alphas that don’t have the Alpha Red traits. It was deemed dangerous because it gave all alphas heightened male specifications along with inhuman abilities. We’re talking extra sperm production, extra speed, extra strength, heightened senses, that sort of thing. There were too many occurrences happening with deranged alphas that couldn’t control it. It would throw them into rages that would kill them or people around them in violent ways.”
“Have you two gentlemen decided what you would like to start with?”
She leads him back through the oak double doors, passing the elevator he came up with. He glances at the sign in front of it and he stops. The arrow under HDU is now pointing to the right. I am seeing things again, like this morning! I must be really stressed out!!
“I get it from your brother's, but you know it's a term of love and endearment.”
“Wow, your smoking Dean. Your going to be dead eye in a matter of days. As long as you keep learning from me, you got this.”
“I think that sounds like a good idea. Speaking of, you’re going to have to tell me if you like how the room’s set up. I tried to make sense of it, but I don’t know.” Meg brushes past him and walks to the bedroom and he follows closely behind her. Castiel observes the set up and gives a slight nod. The king size bed is right below the double window. The purple curtains fixed on them hang from the windows like a canopy. The bed’s garnished with purple and black sheets and a comforter that Meg bought at Bed, Bath, and Beyond a while ago. They’ve been just waiting since Arizona for the right time to be used. Pictures of black pansies hang on the wall. There is definitely space here for an entertainment center. Castiel makes a mental note to make it his first real purchase in Epilson. He puts his hands on Meg’s hips and squeezes. She laughs lazily and taps his hands softly. “Nope, none of that, I’m tired. We have a long day tomorrow and we can’t afford distractions.”
Happy Reading!

“Ouch!”
. Your time at the B-Course was the fastest recorded time. You have Alpha Red. I haven’t seen your eyes to tell if it’s true, but I feel it in my gut that you have it. When they were recruiting for this job I jumped at the chance to see you in action. I had to know if I was on the right track.”
♩ ♫ ♩
Dean growls low under his breath again. He looks the alpha in the eyes and stares. The alpha doesn't back down.
, why am I in danger?”
“They left out a lot of the details actually. Crowley happened to find me in an alley and then he offered me a job. He said I was a babysitter. Now, here I am.”
“Someone’s doing recon on you. There’s a paper trail on you, but not a long one. Someone’s dug into it. When I tried to dig it up half of the information was missing. There are archives, indexes, certificates, but most of them were gone by the time I got there. Someone is watching you, other than me, other than Carver, other than Crowley. I would cross all my T’s and dot all my I’s. You might want to start researching Alpha Red, and digging up some of your history if you want to stay ahead of this person. I can help you out but my help only goes so far. The Treehouse is very constricting. As far as this concert, I wouldn’t worry about it too much. I can handle pretty much anything, and if I’m right about you, so can you. I’ve been doing other research on the side though. Here.” Gordon tosses another set of papers onto the coffee table. “This is on Omega Gold. If you want to protect Castiel then read it. The next time I see you, will be when we ship out. Please, do the homework.”
Dean leans his chair back a little, balancing it on two legs. “Castille, It’s a gift, you take them.”
Dean takes the papers from Gordon’s hands and looks at them intently. “This is just a bunch of letters and numbers. Genomes, gametes, heterosexual, bisexual, what are you trying to get at?”
We can talk about all of the future stuff I got going on.
It’s a fresh start, that's what he keeps telling himself. He keeps repeating the mantra over and over again. They just need a fresh start. A place where they can forget all their troubles and be a unit; especially after years of fighting and infidelity. He blinks away the exhaustion that starts to nestle its way into his eyes as he stares out the foggy window. He draws in the thick sheet of condensation with his finger and sighs, creating more ripples of fog on the window. He finds himself thinking about the life they had back in Arizona. Arizona being the place where the sun never dies. With all things considered, it was a good life. Now, he’s fixating on a tiny spot circled on the makeshift map they bought from a convenience store on their way out of Phoenix. He taps his fingers on the spot over and over again, waiting until his wife comes out of a nearby diner. This is their starting over. He doesn’t know why Meg picked Epilson, New Hampshire. He thinks maybe she just closed her eyes and pointed to a place, and then chose a city in the vicinity of her finger, or maybe it had been a conscious decision. Either way he was going to make the most of it because
Dean stands to his feet even though he knows he shouldn’t give this entity an ounce of respect. The candles that keep the tiny cottage lit go out one by one casting the cottage into darkness. Dean doesn’t know what to expect when a voice is heard and nobody’s seen. Rowena seems to know where it’s coming from since she turns to one of the vacant corners of the room immediately.
Crowley shuts the door behind him and Dean takes his time to look into his bedroom and both of the bathrooms. The apartment is small only having one bedroom, but it's spacious and Dean loves it more than anything. He doesn't hesitate to drop his bag on the large king sized bed and use his cream tiled shower for the first time. He changes into one of his suits and styles his hair. He locks his apartment and makes his way back down to the limo.
“Hello. Mr. Novak I presume? Welcome to your first day here at Saint Christopher Regional Hospital. I’m Chuck Shurley, and I run the HR department here.”
Castiel chews the last little bit of food in his mouth. “I know you said you can’t grant people love, but I have fallen in love with someone and I want them to be with me. Since, I can’t wish for love I wish for….”
“Here are the clothes. It's a bit of everything really. Briefs, socks, shoes, pants, shorts, and shirts. Am I missing anything? I said every article of clothing there is, right? Okay, here.”
“I wish my sister would get her life together. She’s been wasting her life and needs help. I want her to have a job, a house, a family. I wish my sister was more stable.” Castiel closes his eyes and scrunches his forehead.
Dean follows the order and scoots closer to Castiel. Castiel doesn’t move his hand though. Dean starts to sweat with the closeness. He hopes his scent isn’t too overwhelming for the omega. Dean’s nervous and a little turned on and he doesn’t want the first day with the omega to be a train wreck. It could all come to an end because he can’t keep it in his pants. It’s been a long time. Who wants to sleep with a homeless person that’s lucky if he can find a place to bathe each night? Virtually no one, so it’s been years. Dean focuses back in on the conversation when he realizes Castiel has been talking this whole entire time and his hand is back on the coffee table.
“I was not expecting this.” Castiel says as he gestures to the room with his hand.
“I understand perfectly. I'm ready.”
It’s been four hours since Dean, Castiel, and Sam crammed themselves and their belongings into a 1958 Mercedes-Benz 220 sedan. Dean stares in the rearview mirror at a sleeping Castiel. Castiel sighs deeply, and Dean smiles to himself in response. Just yesterday Castiel had been his. Ever since Dean was younger he never thought that he would have anyone that would be interested in him. Foster home to foster home, no time to make lasting relationships, and then being homeless for years. No one paid Dean any mind. Even with him being an Alpha, his designation didn’t cut him any breaks. He has the chance to finally be happy, and he’s not letting any terrorist or spy get in the way of that. Dean focuses back on the road breathing in the air from the open window. They pass a road sign that’s hanging from its hinges, saying 260 miles before Sinj. Dean runs his hands through his hair, trying to distract himself to stay awake. He’s driven 260 miles already and he’s exhausted. Sam taps him on the shoulder to get his attention. Dean turns the music down to a minimum. It wasn’t helping him stay awake anyway since classical is the only thing the radio seems to play. “Yeah?”
He continues to drive down the abandoned dirt road, taking a glance at the scenery every so often. He’s never seen so many pastures and forests before in his life.
“As a matter of fact there is. Why don’t you go towards Gino’s? We would like to eat there.”
Dean agreed tersely, taking out a handkerchief from his pocket. He gently wipes sweat from Sam’s brow and puts the handkerchief back in his pocket. “Should we...should we start making preparations?”
Sam looks at Dean intently.
Naomi looks concerned but answers his question anyway. “Last year, when you and Raphael gave us the keys. You don’t remember?”
Crowley looked at Dean opening his mouth to say something until a limo pulled up beside them. Crowley opened the door and gestured inside.
Castiel turns around and winks at him before he puts his hand on Dean’s cheek. “I’m going home young man. I know you’re trying to do your job, but trust me I can take care of myself here. I’ll only need you on tour. You should get a hold of Crowley to see who’s helping you with Vietnam. It’s good to have a solid working relationship.” Castiel blushes and Dean realizes he’s hit a nerve.
Dean nodded and held out his arms wide. He saw people do this on small screen. He kind of got the gist of it. Charlie moved his limbs every which way until she got the correct measurements. Dean stayed quiet the entire time. He felt used without the penetration part. He hoped this wasn’t some kind of an escort service like job he got himself into. Charlie grinned as she rolled up the tape measure.
“Did your first night go well?”
Crowley slowly peeks around the corner before he walks in.
“I believe I have an extra holster in my room if you want it. Follow me and we can go get it.”
Dean looks away and then touches his chin in deep thought.
Castiel nods as he skims through the file. This job is very different from what he’s used to, but he’ll manage. After all, he’d been doing his residency at a hospital, even if it was years ago.
“It's a good thing that I got word you're leaving today. If you weren't leaving you would be doing house chores for the next week because of that strike. Clean up this mess.”
“It's your last day huh?”
Castiel ignores the whispers and makes his way to the floor that his first surgery is on. Doctors and nurses pass by him in the hallways and nod their heads at him. He nods back even though he has no idea who they are. One doctor stops him and starts talking to him. “Cas, we missed you at the bar last night. Why didn’t you show up?”
Crowley walks away to look over the targets leaving Chuck with Dean. Chuck stands still waiting for the all good from Crowley. The alphas Dean put down are all getting up and vacating the course. Crowley yells across to them that Dean managed to do blunt damage on all the targets. Chuck nods and looks back over to Dean.
Crowley leaned in to the window.
Sam shifted on Dean's bed to make himself more comfortable.
Castiel smiles again patting Dean on his back. “No, but I’d like to know you.”
“It’s simple dummy. You bought the urn, you bought the baggage. You get the wishes.” Dean smacks loudly and wipes his hands on his gold harem pants. “It’s all in the contract, but we’ll get to that.”
The little boy takes the dollar and tries to put it in his pockets. The girl Nat helps him after a while. The boy blinks up at Castiel again. “I don’t like that name. I don’t want to be little.”
Dean nods and walks behind Sam. He looks back at the booths they were just at and then he spots someone staring at him in the corner of his eye. He turns towards the body and see's a man with darker skin staring at him with intense eyes. He wonders what the guys problem is, but the guy looks away again. Dean doesn't think anymore of it as he closes the door behind him. They make it to Sam's room and Sam retrieves the holster from under his bed.
“I didn’t expect to come back so soon, but Raphael and Hannah wanted to call it a trip. They went back to New York, so I flew back home. I had fun though. Everything was perfect.”
“No pressure, but pressure. First things first, the obstacles. We want you to run this as fast as you can. Your time to beat is currently fifteen minutes and twenty seconds. Once your done running the obstacles shoot the moving targets. Come out on the other end and free the dummy. Combat the alphas, do not use your gun this is strictly hand to hand. Carry the dummy out and we'll stop the timer. Understand?”
“So, you will be working on the fourth floor, in the High Dependency Unit. As you may already know most patients here have gone through extensive major surgery, or are experiencing single to multiple organ failures. Make sure to keep that in mind when you're treating each patient. You report to doctor Crowley MacLeod. You’ll see, he is charming!” Chuck laughs out loud. He is obviously being sarcastic. Which makes Castiel nervous to meet the man in question. When Chuck sees the look of dismay on Castiel’s face he sobers up. “Don’t worry, my friend! There are a couple of junior doctors for you to boss around.” Chuck leans forward across the desk like he wants to whisper a secret to Castiel. His face is now deadly serious, as he gestures to him to move closer. “A bit of advice, if I may. Stay away from the nurses. They are already married!” As he finishes the sentence, Chuck falls back onto his chair, laughing hard. “Nuns!” he adds, wiping a tear from his eye. “You get it? They’re all married to God!” Castiel makes an effort to smile, even though the joke isn’t funny at all. What the hell is wrong with this guy?! He thinks to himself.
Castiel nods his head in understanding. “I’ll make sure to put your vase up so now one will knock you over.”
Sam backs away from Dean's face with a look of confusion.
Castiel peeks at the book to figure out what the problem is. The store owner covers the book with his hand. “What’s the problem, and I’m just reading your nametag but is it Bobby?”
Mary looks up and shakes her head as she continues to bite on her fingernails, as she normally does when she’s in a frantic state. Dean sighs heavily before sitting at the edge of the bed. Mary yanks her fingers from her mouth to answer Dean’s question. “The Doctor’s saying it’s getting worse. He won’t make it past the winter. If he’s lucky, he’ll see October.”
Castiel laughs as Meg pokes at his ribs and skips inside the house. He follows her into the empty house and stands in the entrance of the living room. His eyes dart around the room, but remain on the brick fireplace. It’s an odd color, but it matches the outside and inside. “I’ve never seen a black fireplace before. It’s rather nice.”
Castiel clears his throat as he ignores Dean. He doesn’t want to poke the bear with a stick right now. He would rather focus on the positive. “Alright, well no time for cleaning this up. You can do that later,
Crowley jogs away and starts to talk to a taller man that has taken off his protective headgear. He motions towards Dean and they both walk back over.
“You will be handling precious cargo so you will be using firearms. I suggest you learn to use one if you do not know how. There will places and people that will train you as best as we can. Any questions you have report them to me first. I will pass along the information to the upper chain. Do not try to take matters into your own hands. It can get you killed. Now eat up and remember everything I told you. You’re on the clock and your job starts now. This is a trial run though; if you excel at your position your salary will be abundant, and there are plenty of places you can go from here.”
“I know I’m a doctor, but that’s still kind of gross. Well, hopefully you feel better. You must be really recuperating from a bad one because you hardly ever call me by my whole name. You usually just call me Zeke. Have a good one though!” Ezekiel walks in the opposite direction and Castiel stares at him for a little bit before he turns to continue walking. He makes it to his floor and the right room number. He walks in and sees nurses are all around the operating table. He goes around the corner where nurses are washing up. He looks at their attire and realizes he’s severely overdressed. He doesn’t even have on scrubs. He tells a nurse he’s going to go get something really fast and zips out of the room. He finds a gift store downstairs after wandering and looks over the many racks until he finds a rack of scrubs. He purchases a pair of light blue scrubs in his size. He finds a bathroom and changes as fast as possible. He doesn’t have a locker here he doesn’t think so he just throws his suit in the trash. He buries it at the bottom of the bin. He can’t do anything about his shoes so he’ll just try to cover them up as fast as possible. He washes his hands and returns to the surgery room. He’s already wasted so much time, and he’s lucky they haven’t put the patient under yet. It’s surprising he even knows that. He goes over to the washing area and scrubs down. He puts on the surgical gown, mask and glasses, over-shoes, and surgical cap. He pops on a pair of gloves and heads over to the operating table. He watches as a nurse looks at him waiting. He doesn’t realize what to do here. He stares at her back until some part of his brain tells him to nod at her. He nods at her with earnest and she looks down at the patient and administers the necessary drugs. The patient goes under successfully and the nurse next to him waits on his que. He remembers what the clipboard said. This was a supposed gall bladder removal. He clears his throat and says “scalpel”. The nurse reaches for the scalpel from the many instruments and hands it to Castiel. Castiel starts cutting open the patient and he’s even more surprised he knows where to cut.
Dean paces back and forth before a white limo pulls up and Chuck jumps out.
Castiel reaches the hospital and gets out of the car. A couple people he doesn’t even know nod their heads in his direction. Dean didn’t tell him that changing his career would also change his relationships with the people he knew. He starts to wonder now who he knows. Castiel makes his way through the hospital lobby and then to the nurses station. One of the nurses greets him with a “Hello, how are you this morning, Mr. Novak?”
The alpha walks over to Dean's laundry hamper and flings it across the floor.
Sam looks back up at Dean from his stretches with exasperation.
first album in the cd tray. A smooth rock ballad fills his apartment. He turns down the volume so he won't disturb his neighbors, and so he can hear his thoughts. He bobs his head to the music, and closes his eyes. He lets the music take him as he thinks of ideas for Dean. Castiel doesn’t know why Dean feels the way he does. All he knows is that Dean seriously needs to get back in touch with his roots. Castiel clicks next on the stereo and
Castiel picks up the urn and begins to walk out the store. Bobby just grins as he puts the money in the register. “Come back and see me anytime.”
Castiel kicks off his shoes, leaving them in front of the door on the linoleum by Meg’s. He eyes a sticker on the window he didn’t notice before. “Hey Meg, I guess we have an alarm system. Our house is protected by Links.” He makes his way into the spacious open kitchen. “Wow, it’s huge! It even has an island. I don’t think we’ve ever had a kitchen island before.”
Sam looks at Dean and then widens his eyes zeroing in on Dean's face.
Castiel sits on the bed with a gruff.
Dean looks Sam up and down and thinks about it for a minute.
is their starting over.
Dean grabs his jacket and follows Castiel out of the room. “What’s the next thing?”
Dean nods his head in understanding. Castiel watches him walk away toward the bathroom. A few seconds later he hears the shower turn on and singing.
Dean places his guitar beside the small coffee table. “Do you ever wonder if there’s more out there?”
“Hey, Dean. How was your night?”
Castiel loses himself in thought as he thinks about his first day tomorrow on his new job. Going from owning your own practice to working under superiors in a hospital is a little overwhelming. A part of him is telling himself that it’s a necessary change, but he can’t help worrying about having less control over what he can and cannot do. Sure, the hours are better and the responsibility won’t rest solely on his shoulders, but it still feels constricting having to answer to someone again. Castiel brushes the thoughts aside and focuses on Meg. He must have been out of it for longer than he thought because the living room is done and the kitchen is almost finished. The movers will be coming upstairs shortly and he needs to get out of the way before they do. He rises and stretches before making his way to the couch. He should really help Meg with where to place their furniture, but she would probably chew
Castiel smiles at Dean baring all his teeth. “I know I was just excited. I’m going out there now, so you can get this thing started. Break a leg out there, not literally though.” Castiel hugs Dean one handed as he pulls back the curtain with his other hand. He exits off the stage making sure not to walk on it completely. He doesn’t need people rioting because the crowd thinks he’s the proprietor or something. He finds a spot close to the first row and huddles in with everyone else. Jo, Ash, and Sam walk on first and take their positions. They start playing a song when Dean walks out. Castiel doesn’t recognize the song, and he knows every song from
It was an old and battered place. The sign didn’t really help to draw customers in either. Bobby’s Place might as well be empty from the looks on the outside. Castiel didn’t know why he wanted to come in here. Something just told him to come. There was dust clinging onto almost everything in the store. He walks around the shelves touching random objects and occasionally getting the stink eye from the store owner. He sees random paintings leaning against the shelves. He blows the dust off one and touches the canvas gently. It’s a picture of a woman. It looks like it’s from the baroque era. The woman’s dress is practically swallowing her and it has ugly bows strewn throughout it, talk about overkill. He politely moves along and abandons the painting. He skims the shelves again. He doesn’t even know what he’s looking for. This is not how he hoped to spend his Friday night. His job was stressful today and the last thing he wanted to be doing was walking around an antique shop. His job had its kinks like the pay grade, but accounting was always a passion of his because he believed strongly in numbers. Anything could be solved with numbers. Maybe his obsession with numbers was the reason he tried to counteract it with art. Art sometimes couldn’t be explained. It was a nice balance in his predictable life. He made quick work of each shelf until his eyes stumbled on an urn. The urn was unusually placed, sitting beside fancy glass vases. It was kind of beat up and dingy. It was gold in color but the years have turned it bronze. Some of the jewels were missing and Castiel didn’t know if they were real or fake. He guessed that they were probably fake because of the condition the urn was in. The top of the urn had a symbol on it that he didn’t recognize. The urn had character and Castiel knew that with a little work it could be a good conversational piece. Castiel picks up the urn and dusts it off. He carries it to the front where the store owner tries to ring it up. The store owner looks through his books to find a price for the item. “Huh, that’s strange.”
Dean licks his lips again as Castiel tries not to focus on them. “I wasn’t always a genie. I actually got trapped into doing it. I got three wishes once upon a time ago. My third wish was a very bad play on words. I ended up telling the genie that it must be cool to have his job. I blabbered on about him not having any responsibilities and living in a golden palace a.k.a the urn. Then I opened my big mouth to say “I wish I had your job”. Now, here I am. What’s today?”
. Good Luck!” Castiel leaves Dean in the middle of the floor surrounded by tables of patrons. He walks towards the bar and thinks about ordering a drink. Castiel usually doesn’t drink, but this could turn into a disaster. He decides against it as he watches Dean try to haggle with the DJ. Once Dean turns around looking somewhat petrified from nerves,
Dean turns his back to Castiel and looks out the window again. Dean doesn’t say anything for an unnaturally long amount of time. It’s kind of unsettling. “No, not space stuff. I’m talking about life. Do you think that there’s more to life than just working day in and day out, getting nothing back? I perform, I write lyrics, I make hit after hit, and what do I get for it? What do I have to show for it, money, awards, fans, groupies, adoration, who cares about that stuff? After a while it gets repetitive anyway. It’s the same old stuff, the same old luxuries, the same old sex, the same old stalkers. It gets…lonely.”
“A favor of
Castiel hesitates and then slinks back to the living room. Dean takes a minute to compose himself. The compliment from his ma…the omega is endearing. He can’t sink into whatever trap this omega is trying to put him in. Dean has a job to do and he’s going to do it right.
“What the fuck was that? You said to hit you!”
Castiel wakes up and adjusts his eyes to the darkness. He has sweat pooling at his hairline and the dip of his neck. He looks over to his left and sees Meg sleeping peacefully. He swallows a few times, trying to push down the lump in his throat. His gaze darts to the hallway where he thought he saw a quick black shadow dart away. He must be imagining things. He breathes through the panic that's creeping through him like an unsettling wave. His body feels abnormally cold. Castiel scrunches his eyebrows, dropping his head back on his pillow and then he closes his eyes. Hopefully he can find sleep again. Hopefully he can feel some semblance of peace. There’s a tinge of regret in his mind.
Dean followed behind Charlie into a closed off section of the store.
Dean sits down on the frozen ground. “My wishes work a little bit different for everyone. It depends on the persons true intentions. When you wished to become a surgeon, didn’t you notice your house and car didn’t change?”
Meg looks at the back door and then back at Castiel. “I don’t know, I wasn’t in here. I didn’t even hear the alarm system chirp to tell us the back door was opened. Are you okay?”
“Yes, of course.”
Raphael throws his head back with a laugh. “I can only imagine. I actually wanted to discuss something with you. My company wants to invest in some business around your area. What would be a good spot?”
One afternoon, Castiel goes from room to room at the hotel cleaning and replacing sheets. Most of the guests that stay here are usually out, or exploring the shops and leisure’s downstairs. Castiel unloads and watches some television between changing rooms. It’s one of his guilty pleasures to watch soap operas on the hotel televisions. Since he’s hardly ever home it makes no sense to even have a television, so Castiel indulges regularly. He takes his time cleaning and changing the sheets so he doesn’t get complaints, but he can’t help himself when he starts powering through it faster when he’s on Dean’s floor. In a matter of moments he’ll be in Dean Smith’s room. He’s tempted to just smell the sheets, even though it’s the most disturbing thing in the world. Castiel finishes up the other rooms on Dean’s floor quickly. He prepares himself to knock on Dean’s door, but stops when he hears sobbing.
“Lets take you to your apartment shall we?”
Sister Josie shows him the doctor’s room where she leaves him. There are three regular desks and a very big one. Behind each one there’s a locker and a filing cabinet. A young woman is sitting at one of the small desks, the others are empty. She looks up at him. “Hello. I’m doctor Robinson but you can call me Cassie, I’m one of the two juniors here. Doctor Fitzgerald is doing the rounds now. As for the head doctor, he hasn’t come in this morning yet. He likes taking his time! He can afford it, we can’t.” She flashes him a smile. He can’t fail to notice that she is very pretty.
Dean looks taken aback but just nods. He walks behind Chuck back to the limos and climbs in the backseat waiting for Crowley. Crowley talks a bit with Chuck, and then Chuck hands him a key. Chuck walks away and gets back into his limo and then his limo drives off. Crowley climbs in the back with Dean and then fixes himself a glass of bourbon.
Dean puts his lips on Castiel’s. Dean kisses Castiel hungrily but stops when Sam walks up to the door. Castiel grunts in aggravation, but straightens up when he meets Sam’s eyes. “We were just talking.”
Dean slowly climbed into the back of the limo. He looked at his surroundings and gasped. The limo had black leather seats with red carpet. There was a tiny chandelier with Swarovski crystals hanging from the middle. There was an open mini bar stocked with alcohol right behind the driver seat. Crowley climbed inside after Dean and adjusted himself. He sat on the opposite side of Dean and stared like he was trying to put together a puzzle. Dean felt uncomfortable immediately slinking down to avoid the stare. Crowley started pouring himself a glass of bourbon.
Dean closes his eyes taking in the scent of aroused omega. He wants to take him right there and right now job be damned. Castiel knows what he’s doing the touch, the smell, everything he’s baiting Dean and he has him hook, line, and sinker. Dean steps back out of the touch which causes Castiel’s scent to alter a little. He gives Dean A half smile and then saunters out the door. Dean immediately picks up his house phone and dials Crowley. Crowley picks up right away.
“This is Dean and Dean is going to do everything in his power to protect your treasure. He doesn't have any prior training, but he's willing to learn. I found him on the streets, in an alley as a matter of fact. I figured Dean here would rather be at his best here then out there considering his circumstances. Isn't that right Dean?”
“Charlie, you must think I’m a fool. I know how to wear and care for my things.” Dean scratches his nose tenderly as he hobbles off the tiny stool. It was beginning to hurt his backside, and he’s actually glad to be rid of it for an hour or two. He passes by Charlie bidding the talented artist adieu as he saunters into the hallway. His parents should be around here somewhere. He’s hoping they’re not gallivanting with guests since there are always guests around here.
“That’s where you're wrong. No matter who they listen to there is always room for more fans. I booked you for 2:30. That means you have less than fifteen minutes to find a song you want to sing. I chose this specific bar because on Friday’s it’s strictly country, all day long. You can not request anything by
Once he feels the tension gathering in the air Dean leaves the room with trepidation. He doesn’t want to lose Sam, as much as his mother doesn’t want to lose her youngest son.
Castiel gets into bed. “I didn’t know I was a distraction. Thank you for boosting my ego a little bit.” Castiel gestures for Meg to climb into bed with him. Meg turns off the light and climbs into her side of the bed. Castiel moves to adjust the covers over them both. He scoots closer to her, spooning her up against his chest. He breathes in her scent and nibbles along her neck. “You smell good.”
“I’m fine. I mean, I know they’re probably after me, but I’m not the one putting myself on the line. If something happens…” Castiel brushes his arms lightly, looking at the floor in front of him. Dean puts his arms around Castiel and squeezes. “I would do it again. That’s all you need to know.”
Dean heads out of the room memorizing the room number. He heads downstairs with Crowley and they enter a room with blue padding on the ground. There are alphas sparring in the corner.
Castiel stops putting on the buttons. “What do you mean you didn’t put it in the wish?”
“I am sure you know what this place is and what you do here. There is no need for me to explain. I will be taking my leave now, but before I go I want to hand you this.”
Dean shakes his head as if that will make all of this Alpha Red mess go away. “So, if I have this
Dean turns around and tries to hide his blush by pretending he’s digging through his dresser again. His pants are actually in his closet, but Castiel doesn’t need to know. “I think we should go back to the living room and discuss your tour schedule sir.”
Dean picked up his menu and looked it over a few times. He finally decided on the spaghetti pointing it out to Crowley. It had been awhile since he had a full course meal that was appetizing. He wanted something filling and a hamburger or chicken fingers was not going to cut it. The omega came back with the glasses and quickly put them on the table.
“Sure, well after you signed on with the hospital and they gave you that big bonus you wanted to do something nice. You came to me and I matched your bonus. You wanted it to be a surprise to your parents, but you had no idea where they would like to live. We got Hannah involved to ask the nitty gritty questions and she found out they wanted to relocate to Dayton. We scavenged through fifty thousand newspapers and internet listings before we stumbled upon this beauty. When we handed the keys to Naomi and Chuck they were so surprised that we had to practically carry Naomi over here. She had fainted and Chuck was so out of it that he didn’t even realize it.” Raphael laughs and looks over to Naomi and Chuck who smile at him.
Dean hands Castiel a pile of buttons. Castiel starts fixing them to the front of the snowman. “Hannah seemed really happy with Raphael. Her kids are so smart and beautiful. Natalie and Tristan are awesome kids, and I’m happy to be their uncle. My parents are doing great they barely argue anymore. Did you also know Raphael and I bought my parents their house? I had no idea you put that into the wish.”
Dean paces over to the loveseat and sits down. He stares at Castiel for a minute and then remembers to not engage.
The crowd erupts into applause and cheer as Castiel makes his way onstage. The band all give him silent nods and Castiel takes them as thank you’s for talking Dean out of ending it all. Castiel waves at the crowd and smiles shyly. Dean kisses Castiel on the lips, and it catches Castiel off guard. The crowd screams louder. The feeling Castiel has right now is surreal. Dean’s lips leave Castiel’s with a pop. “Fuck, i’ve been wanting to do that. This song is for you Cas!”
Dean nodded his head at Charlie and then ran to catch up to Crowley. They both slid back into the limo and Dean clutched the bag in his hands as he sat down. He placed the bag on the floor once the limo started moving again. Crowley tapped on the tinted window furiously. The window rolled down and Benny spoke up.
Dean nodded his head and then looked at the older man across from him. He hoped he looked determined to do anything. He wanted this chance. The man held his gaze on Dean searching for a mistake in Dean's DNA. Once the man felt satisfied at what he was looking at he nodded at Dean.
“Whatever I say?” The darkness sweeps towards Dean, circling him like prey. Rowena has substituted standing for sitting as she lazes in one of the chairs like a throne. The darkness passes her up as if she's not even there. Dean swallows before nodding. “Anything you say!”
Naomi stops her hovering and turns around in her seat. The rest of the drive to his parents’ home is uneventful. They finally pull up to the house and Castiel has to double gasp. “Wow, it’s big.”
Dean starts unpacking the clothes and putting them away in his dresser.
“I do get that question an awful lot. Let me start by saying that I'm not originally from Chicago. I'm a Texas man. All of my family is from Texas and before you ask, yes everything is bigger in Texas.”
Dean nodded and held on to his gun while they both walked to the shooting booths. They picked booths side by side. Sam handed Dean his protective gear and then put on his own. Sam took out his gun and then pulled the safety.
“I am doctor Castiel Novak. I guess the desk without clutter is mine. No offense.”
Castiel’s mother shakes her head. “Castiel we’ve lived at the same place forever. Matter of fact you came up here last Christmas. Are you feeling alright honey?”
“Invasion of privacy, much? Yeah, I have both. Who doesn’t carry a credit card?” Dean blows on his hands again to warm them up.
Dean nods and looks over to the huge duffel bag in Crowley's hand.
He flees the room quickly, feeling like a fool. He thinks about Meg and their fresh start in this new place. So much for that! The first pretty face and he’s acting like an idiot! He leaves through the main entrance of the hospital. Before heading to his car, he glances across the street. A man is standing on the footpath opposite him. He seems to be looking in his direction, eyes fixed on Castiel. A cold shiver runs down his spine. He rubs a hand over his face, then looks again. The man is gone. What the hell is wrong with me today?! He heads for the car, checking his mirrors once he gets inside.
“Is this him? Is this who you found? He doesn't even look a buck fifty. What is he going to do?”
Crowley extended his arm out toward the busy street. Dean moved slowly out to the street waiting for Crowley to guide him. Crowley walked beside Dean and then stopped at the sidewalk. Dean looked in both directions waiting for something to happen.
“Are you alright doctor Novak?”
Castiel heads out on the plane the next day. His mother is waiting for him at the airport along with his father. His mother hugs him warmly and his father shakes his hand before he pulls him into a hug as well. “Where’s Hannah?”
It would be awkward to knock now. Dean would definitely have a problem with knowing that Castiel heard him cry. Castiel brings his hand to the door again, edging it closer.
? Any normal person would have already been down to their third wish already. You’re a weird human, you know that.”
Crowley stepped closer to Dean until he was at arm’s length. He huffed a sigh of exasperation.
“We’re in Sinj.” Sam turns towards the back seat to look at Dean, and Dean notices that he’s now in the driver's seat. “Castiel pulled over and I volunteered to drive the rest of the way. I decided to pull my weight.”
Crowley stands up draining the rest of the bourbon and setting the glass in the guards hands. He heads towards the door and Dean follows. They pass by the guard who Chuck told to leave. Dean stares him down as the guard lowers each omega cage and escorts the omegas to a back room. They then exit the warehouse where Benny is waiting in the limo. Crowley opens the door and Dean climbs in first. Benny maneuvers around in the front seat trying to pull off that he wasn't sleeping. He rolls down the protective window.
Castiel can’t contain his excitement at being the guest of honor. He’s going to be brought on stage.
“This is to get you started. Once you start making money you will buy your own guns and clothes. Hold on a second will you!”
“It’s not for me, dark one. This one here called upon you.” Rowena pushes Dean into the darkness’ view.
Castiel smiles down on the boy while he situates his things back into his own pocket. “What do you want me to call you then?”
The nurse looks back at him dumbfound. “You forgot already. You have two surgeries lined up for this morning. The first surgery starts in…” The nurse looks at her watch “thirty minutes. Here’s your schedule for today.”
Dean nods again slowly this time.
Castiel goes through the motions as March passes by. His job is easier now since he’s performed almost every surgery that there is. His family is stronger and his bond with his sister is impenetrable. All thanks to the genie that disappeared from his life. Castiel stands in front of the nurse’s station in the waiting room. He’s done all his surgeries for the day, but he likes to hang out in front of the nurse’s station and exchange horror surgery stories. He laughs at one of the nurses going into depth about a man that woke up during surgery. From the sound of it, it wasn’t pretty. The entrance doors slide open and a few distraught men walk in. They’re huddled around a man who’s holding his arm. One of the men excuses himself from the circle and walks up to the nurse’s station. Castiel pretends that he’s not interested in what the man has to say, but he secretly eavesdrops.
“I guess not…” answers Castiel. He is very annoyed by the head doctor’s attitude. He understands now what Chuck meant. But there’s no point making a show on day one, so he lets it pass. Hopefully this guy will stay out of his way as much as possible.
It’s hard to sit still when someone is painting your likeness on a canvas. Dean’s never been the fidgety type, but as soon as someone gathers paints and demands a pose, he’s done for. He’s never scratched his nose so much in his life. His parents paid a small fortune for these paintings, and he’s ruining them. “I do apologize, but I have an itch.”
“Business?” Castiel follows Hannah into the living room. The kids are running in circles chasing each other until Raphael shoos them outside. Hannah smiles and kisses Raphael before she sits down on the couch. Naomi and Chuck are in the dining room working on a crossword puzzle. Raphael sees Castiel and shakes his hand. “Castiel, it’s been awhile. How are things at the hospital?”
“It was good. I actually had a pretty good night's sleep.”
“Alright, I think we've done enough stretching. Hit me!”
“I wish for your freedom.” Castiel closes his eyes and then opens them again forgetting he doesn’t have to close them. Dean stares into Castiel’s eyes before a gold glow washes over Dean’s body. Castiel gasps loudly as he looks at the seat that’s now empty. Castiel jumps up and runs into his bedroom. He opens his closet and reaches for the urn at the top of it. He hopes that he doesn’t find a little Dean lounging inside. When he looks it over the urn is back to its dingy condition. One ruby and one diamond are left on the outside of the bronzed urn. The symbol that sat on top of the lid is gone. He opens the lid and dust poofs into his face. He smiles to himself because he got his wish. Dean’s free, but where is he now?”
“That bathroom was disgusting. I had to make one of the employees clean it before I used it. That’s why it took so long to…..honey?... Honey?... Cas!”
“I want you to call it.”
Dean huffs out a breath and then try's to hit Sam again. Sam counters it and then pushes back hard into Dean's chest. Dean clutches his chest and coughs as he tries to swallow in air. Sam looks at Dean with the most shit eating grin.
Castiel stares at her for a few seconds trying to translate the garbled language before he gives up entirely. “What?”
Castiel puts a hand to his heart. "I heard a noise. I came down here to investigate. The...the back door and the doors to the pool house were open. Where were you?”
Sam laughs a hearty laugh before he pulls and then slides the safety and hands the gun back to Dean.
“Oh quit your whining. That’s what you get for messing with things you shouldn’t.” Rowena adds the blood to the spell, causing a plume of red smoke to rise from the bowl. Dean looks on in curiosity as Rowena whispers in a dead language. The cottage seems to get darker even though there’s no difference made to the lighting. “She’s approaching, dearie.”
“I don't know. It just came to me out of no where.”
♩ ♫ ♩
Castiel walks to the kitchen as he talks with his back turned to Dean. “Technically Crowley has already done his job. He only gets involved if need be, such as if you’re screwing up royally. My father doesn’t give you commands at all. He gives Crowley commands. Face it Dean, you are now under the control of an omega. I hope that little tidbit doesn’t change our working relationship.”
Castiel washes the sweat off his forehead then studies his hand. When did he start sweating? “You say I have three wishes? What are the guidelines of these three wishes?”
Castiel’s lips twitch at his wife before he pretends to love everything about plasticville. “I love it baby! You were right, it's just...wonderful.”
Dean looked out the window at the passing billboards. He sat there as the limo came to a stop. Crowley climbed out the door and Dean followed close behind. They both walked into Monroe’s. Dean had been in here a few times looking for a job opportunity only to be kicked on his ass. He followed behind Crowley who had walked up to the front desk. A bubbly redheaded beta jolted up in shock wrapping her hands around her heart.
“I’m sorry boss. It won’t happen again. The nearest clothing store is Monroe’s right up the street. We’ll be there in a few minutes.”
Castiel laughs before he goes to the kitchen to make lunch. He calls his mother and father after Dean makes the wish. Dean returns to the urn and Castiel puts the urn at the top of his closet. He packs a suitcase with all his essentials. This Thanksgiving his parents want him and his sister to stay a week at their house. Castiel had agreed because he wanted to see what the wish had transformed his sister into.
Dean gets off of Sam helping him up in the process.
“You always say that. Every time someone needs our help you want to con them out of something. Even if what we're doing is mediocre. Nothing is good enough for you, Rowena. I say we help the boy anyway. Whether we gain from him or not. I have a feeling that helping him is going to bring forth things that are unimaginable.” Missouri sets her cup back down on the tray. “Anything you need Dean we will do.”
Castiel doesn’t get an answer so he quickly zips his trousers and laces up his loafers before heading downstairs. It’s eerily quiet and it makes his nerves stand on edge. He makes his way to the kitchen where the back door is open. “Honey, are you outside? I’m coming out!”

Castiel gets up from the snow and then looks at his angel. “I think I’ll call mine Faith.”
. Let’s go!”
“What does that have to do with me though?” Dean sits back on the couch and props his foot on the coffee table.
Charlie smiled big before she rushed off towards the front of the store. Dean put his hoodie back on before he walked back to Crowley. Crowley was talking to a shorter man with a big gut when Dean walked up to him. He cut the conversation short and ushered the man away with a hand shake.
Castiel grabs the half downed drink from Dean’s hands, placing it on the bar. “We’re not finished yet. We still have one more stop to go. How are you feeling about music so far?”
Dean sets the chair he’s sitting in back on four legs. “I guess, since i’m bored it won’t hurt to go along with this.”
“My dad must really like you. The other alphas he employs aren’t so lucky to get nice places like this. Hell, they’re lucky if they even make it out of The Treehouse.”

“Nothing, just how this is going to be a new exciting experience, that’s all.” Castiel bites his lip carefully hoping that his wife doesn’t see past the fake smile and sarcasm. He is excited, but not completely.
