Dean raises an eyebrow although for some reason, Castiel’s lips quirk up in a smile.
He hesitates, stopping in his tracks, eyes trailing up and down but the angel that sits before him – wings small and black, barely peeking over their shoulders – is not an angel he has met before.
But he saw it. The pain in Castiel’s eyes when he mutilated the demon’s corpse, well past dead. When all he wanted was to destroy.
______________________________________
Dean only grins. “I don’t know. Pretty sure Castiel Novak just said yes to a date and, uh, gave me his number.”
Castiel turns on his heels, eyes hopeful and all he has to do is ask him to come sit with him. To come lie with him. So that he can hold him in his arms and pretend that this is not the end – only the beginning.
“Are you even listening?”
Leda narrows her eyes.
"Well, you know now. And I'm sorry I ruined your date with a guy that is no doubt a million times better than me and probably wouldn't act like such a jealous dickhead and--"
“Why are you so good to me? I just dragged you outside and yelled at you like a mad man and here you are making me feel all mushy inside. How did I get so lucky?” Dean asks, curling his arms around Cas’ waist. Cas hums.
When he is done there is only the quiet between them. He feels empty, everything poured out into Elaria’s waiting ears and now there is nothing left to say.
He shakes the thoughts away, knowing what he is here to do and knowing whoever it is well enough that the king is not going to speak for him. He takes a deep breath before he stands from his chair, legs trembling minutely beneath him as he sinks to his knees on the floor before his father, eyes down.
“No, please. Stay,” Emery says quickly, gesturing to the patch of grass beside him.
When Dean meets Charlie’s gaze, she looks sad. She’s always been sympathetic. He supposes it’s because she knows a certain suffering. She lost her parents not three years ago. They had been travelling to Tavill to visit an old friend as Charlie stayed behind to manage the pub. They never made it, crushed under a rockfall in the Farlee Mountains. Only their guide survived, living to tell her of the sad news.
Castiel wakes after dawn, curled towards where Dean lay – now an empty space. He doesn’t remember Dean leaving. He must have left after he fell asleep.
Never gentle.
, he thinks. No. Now that he’s seen his brother, he’s getting back inside his head again. He won’t let it. This isn’t his fault.
He’s wondering if he should leave to find his mother and Sam when Castiel’s hand slips into his. Dean startles, eyes wide and questioning when they meet Castiel’s but the angel only pulls him up and drags him further and further away until they find another empty log to perch on.
But after the game's over, Dean comes over to him and they grab a drink together before sitting in the far corner of the room and chatting for hours on end. Castiel falls asleep that night exhausted and certainly regretting that last drink he had but there's a smile on his lips nonetheless.
Dean swallows, meeting Castiel's sad, tired eyes. "I know. But you're not alone now, remember? I'll be here." He takes Castiel's hands then, interlacing their fingers.
Nothing interesting ever happens in this castle anymore. It’s not his fault if alongside proving his worth that he wants to indulge in figuring this mystery out.
Slowly again, she reaches out and rests the pads of her fingers on his wrist. Castiel stares at where they touch – skin on skin. Her fingers curl around him just below where his skin is red and raw and with her other hand grabs a cloth from her basket. The press of the wet cloth stings but he doesn’t show any pain.
"Don't worry about those." She places them down on her desk before meeting his eyes once more. Her hands tangle together in front of her and Dean can feel the tension in the air. "Why don't you sit?" She pulls out another chair beside hers and after hesitating for a few moments, he relents.
There’s a small beat of silence where Castiel dreads looking up because what if Dean’s over him now and he doesn’t like him any--
Dean snatches his gaze away, turning to find Seb staring at him. “What?” Brady rolls his eyes over his laptop.
______________________________________
His eyes widen, panicked but angry now. “What are you doing? Get out of my--”
Castiel shakes his head, palming a coin onto the long bench dividing them.
But there’s a tickle at the back of his mind, as if he can’t quite recall something from the distant past – something that seems important.
Emery shakes his head quickly. “Don’t. I know how this goes. It only gets worse. And besides they can’t do much harm anyway. Not without having a nice long look at my fists first.”
And no one speaks it, no one dares to. That training is over and if he fails now…
to the plan tomorrow before throwing his phone to the side and lying staring at the ceiling listening to Seb’s snores wishing tomorrow will never come.
Castiel huffs. “It’s not the same as--”
Dean walks right up to him and places his hands on the counter. "So, what you got?"
"No one in the hall. Two guards passed on their patrols a few minutes ago so it should be clear."
The guard’s eye each other and Castiel catches their fear. But this is their duty. They cannot stand down. “Alright, take a partner and we’ll split up. You…” the guard points towards Castiel, the odd one out.
Comment below or leave some kudos if you enjoyed!
Castiel shrugs, trying to feign nonchalance as he attempts to comprehend that Dean has just said yes to going out on a date. With him. “Maybe Saturday night or something.”
"Gross, Dean." Castiel shoves him away, wiping the wetness from his face and adjusting his glasses. "I don't want your slobber all over me." Dean raises his eyebrows.
The carriage comes to a halt. Dean lets his eyes slip shut for just a moment. A moment enough to remember the look in Castiel’s shimmering blue eyes when he told him he loved him.
He doesn’t resist it now, slumping into his arm’s as one of his hands clutches tight to Dean’s clothes. He closes his eyes and breathes and breathes and breathes – even focusing on the foul taste in his mouth – anything to will the tears away.
______________________________________
“Then, I guess you commit treason all the time,” Sam says and laughter bursts out of Dean as he watches his brother’s smile turn smug.
“Oh, they were. Don’t you know the story?” it sneers. “Of how they made the angels fall. All for the love of some mortal!”
“What do you mean how? You go over there, collect a hundred bucks because I said yes and then bet them a hundred more for if I show up to the date. I will. Then more for a kiss and so on. I’ll get half and you’ll get half
Castiel purses his lips. "It's not difficult to get captured." The only other thing he really had to do was find a reason to - and stealing an expensive looking chest from a noble - that's reason enough. Dean huffs beside him, placing his plate down on the floor before running a hand over his stubbled jaw.
Training is brutal. Much to his surprise, Dean takes them out into the fields but only just outside of the training hall itself giving them enough privacy for Dean to try and stare him straight into the underworld but not enough for them to speak freely.
“Dean,” Castiel mutters, and Dean knows what he’s going to say. “It wasn’t your fault.”
Castiel is sitting by the window, breathing in and out as the sun starts to rise. He woke up earlier than usual this morning and is already dressed and ready to head out for training.
“I brushed it all aside, went along with their conversations because they were my friends but never thought anything of it. Until one day, they invited me in secret to witness a ceremony. So, secret I could not even bring my own personal guard. I was sceptical. But also curious. And I trusted them. So, one night, I slipped out and followed them down underneath the castle. And that’s when I saw him.”
Sam smiles, looking back at Castiel and begins to go on about every nook and cranny and book that must be in the place, Mervyn adding something occasionally.
Dean waits, slightly stiff with apprehension for any questions that will be asked of them. It’s all he prepared for on his journey here and yet the fear that he will be caught is still immense.
So, he cannot truly understand how Dean feels. He’s not sure he wants to. He has enough already to deal with.
After almost all the food is prepared, his own dishes complete, he takes it upon himself as he does every year, to set the table on the open deck outside – Mark and Christian finally helping Samuel out with the barbeque. Although perhaps ‘helping’ is being a little too generous.
Dean shivers, stomach curling as those long fingers graze his ribs – light and testing – and despite how he wants to urge him on, press harder into his touch, he doesn’t push. Knows he still needs to take it slow, allow Castiel to explore him at his own pace.
There is something below – something scribbled out that Castiel can’t quite make out but it looks as though it talks of a poem.
He narrows his eyes at the guarded discomfort on Castiel’s face as he takes the reigns in his hands. At least that’s what it looks to be. He didn’t seem uncomfortable with the horses the other day so it might be worry at having to handle the responsibility of the young prince. But he doesn’t strike Dean as the type of person to worry about that. So…
“Dean--” His eyes snap up then and they’re filled with tears that he tries his hardest to blink away – nothing to reflect the hardness in his voice and his grip.
Eve lets out a deep sigh. “I’m just – every year all I ever get asked is whether I have a boyfriend and so, Cas being the nice friend he is, offered to come with me and pretend to be my boyfriend so you would all get off my back, okay? But I have no idea what’s going on with you two--” she says, waving a hand in Dean’s direction, “I swear, all he told me was he knew you in high school, okay? Everybody happy?”
“Dean.” He turns his head to see Emery stepping towards him. “It’s good to see you,” he says, eyes wide, almost disbelieving but quietly joyful all the same.
______________________________________
“I’m so sorry,” Dean says, almost pleading it but Castiel doesn’t hear him.
______________________________________
Dean stares at the floorboards. The spell Castiel spoke of, the one he said allowed him to hide his wings and heal physical wounds – it was the wings. When he said no one else could do the things he did, he was telling the truth. Not because no one else used the spell like he claimed. Because there never was one. Because only one person can wield the power of the wings. One of three powers. The only powers of an angel left in this world.
He hesitates, not sure how to proceed. He supposes the only way he can is with the truth. “No one else. Only me.” But Dean only huffs a forced laugh and shakes his head.
“But what of Adri? Is he not your family now?”
Castiel nods jerkily, shoving his emotions aside. He can save them for later.
Castiel goes numb. There, written in large, black letters is ‘I love you, Dean Winchester.’
“What about you?”
She nods, standing. “Alright, well, did you want to stay now?”
He only has to deflect once, before he uses his own sword to twist the guard’s and knock it out of his hand. A punch is quickly thrown towards him but he’s quicker in moving his head back, watching as it flies past before he grabs it and twists it harshly, hearing an audible cracking noise.
“Leda--”
Dean lets his eyes slip shut. If Castiel can endure this, he can certainly play his part.
Dean swallows. “Nicolaus.”
“What?” Dean lifts his eyes to find Castiel staring at him. Dean shrugs.
The metal clink of the chains sound as Castiel – body tense and aching – pulls them tight again. Pain blossoms in his side. He has absolutely no clue as to what Nicolaus could be talking about. The damage isn’t permanent. Castiel knows that because he’s the one who delivered the damage. It should be sprained at most. Nicolaus kicks and punches – with his left hand, of course – all the while his face twists with anger and he growls and sneers. The other three guards watch on behind him, grim satisfaction on all of their faces.
Many halt to glance at them and Dean flushes, looking away. He’s used to the attention of thousands but not of this kind. Not from angels.
“Now if you cared about him at all you will help us now and answer our questions.” And despite the tears on his cheeks, there’s a certainty to the young boy that Reyne sees.
Orella and Baudet both take their hands, one by one and place a small kiss upon their knuckles for blessings. Dean appears slightly flustered, Sam smiling at the strange sight and Castiel only tensing slightly under their gentles touches. The children and Orella's sister wave them off and then Baudet is leading them out the door of their manor.
Dean nods, mostly to himself before he walks forward.
Castiel rolls his eyes at the attempt to divert his attention. “
"Oh, thank you," Castiel responds, closing the door behind him. Dean walks straight over to the bookshelf.
Had he though? Had he wanted to dance with Dean?
Dean's already standing outside, looking up and smiling when he sees Castiel. "Hey," he starts, Castiel smiling in response. "Ah - did you want to sit inside or outside?"
"No, I am," Castiel says, cutting him off. "Very gay." Dean breathes out a laugh but if anything, now he looks more confused. Honestly, Castiel doesn't blame him. "I just don't do casual sort of…things." And he doesn't. But he also doesn't do fuck boys. And he doesn’t mean it in a mean way. Sometimes he wishes he could just go around and do whatever or
Reyne swallows. “There is other news. Of your mother.”
Emery swallows. “Because you’re the kindest man I’ve ever met. You could have seen me like all the other men did. But you didn’t. You saw
“Alright,” Castiel says, words coming from thin air. “Let’s walk.”
side. Dimarus waves a dismissive hand and decides to move on.
From behind the tree somewhere, Dean shouts, “Cas! I’ve sent for a doctor and some maids. They’ll be here shortly.”
He reaches for one of Castiel's hands and grips it in his own, thumb smoothing up and down his skin. Castiel's hand stays limp, not reacting.
“But how--”
“Go look. No, just you.
Now Dean’s eyes turn curious and for the first time since he’s been here, the prince doesn’t try to hide it.
A hand slips into his and Dean jerks to a halt, staring down at it. He opens his mouth, not sure what to say.
Only mourning. Quiet and private as they bury their own and burn the enemy in large bonfires.
He exhales against Dean, melting into his lips - his chest - his hands. Castiel's hands trail up Dean's chest and find themselves playing with the hairs at the back of his neck. Dean hums and pulls Castiel impossibly closer. He rests their foreheads together lightly when they part. Dean's eyes are bright in the dark.
Dean reaches across to fetch it and when he turns back to offer Sam the knife, his brother says, "I think he loves you too."
Dean’s mouth gapes before he laughs himself. “You cheated!”
Dean wades out first, most likely to give Castiel his own privacy and Castiel glares at the ground in front of him, walking quickly to his clothes. He pulls on his undergarments without even bothering to dry himself. However, a few moments later Dean is tapping him on the shoulder and holding out a towel, Castiel quickly turning his left arm inwards. He came prepared. Perhaps he had planned to come here today.
After packing the canoes back into Donna’s truck, it’s time to trek back to the main camp. And despite the fact that the day isn’t over, Dean feels a slight tug of disappointment in his chest. Because he doesn’t cross paths all that much with Castiel at school – what with them being in different departments.
They disperse quickly, without even so much as a bow.
Not that he has much helped himself – what with how he’s been mostly closed up inside his own cabin, training with Reyne out in the far fields and only making his way towards the camp’s centre when necessary.
Castiel’s hands ball into fists at his sides, frustration flashing over his features. “Since when do you care about me anyway?”
Castiel’s heart is like a stampede in his chest and he watches closely as Dean’s eyes flick to his as if asking for confirmation. Castiel’s own eyes falling to his lips is apparently confirmation enough because Dean leans in then, lips finally meeting his.
So he does his best to work up a smile. "Now, perhaps," he says.
“So good to see you again,” the prisoner holding the bucket says, and only now do Castiel’s eyes adjust in the dark and he sees the man’s face. Val. The man who tried to grab him through the cell bars the first time he was here. He jumps to his feet just as another prisoner swings his fist at him. Castiel dodges easily and tries to move into the open space of the cell when the sharp metal of his chain digs into his neck and pulls him stumbling backwards. Val throws the bucket – and with nowhere to go – Castiel raises his shackled hands to block it. It’s then that one prisoner tackles his legs out from under him and he hits the ground with a heavy thud, his head knocking against the stone floor.
“Do you want to dance now?” he asks, but he sounds unsure. Castiel meets his eyes and a small smile tugs at his lips.
Dean’s eyes slip to the floor. He feels the disappointment sit in his stomach. Not disappointment at his father but at himself. “I should have known.”
So, as his runners file into the stands, he does up his own runners properly and makes the decision to join them.
“I don’t know, Cas. I just don’t like seeing...ya know, other people touching you like that.” Dean mumbles, looking down and kicking the grass beneath his feet.
______________________________________
Emery slowly drops the grate back down and slumps against the back of the stables with a sigh. He wipes his dirty hands on his trousers before leaning his head back.
Dean nods his head, eyes flashing with understanding. “Are you desperate for money or are you just a thief?”
After a long while, she speaks again. “He had the same look in his eyes that I saw in my sister.” Dean lifts his head, turns to meet her gaze but she still looks towards Michael. “That look that said he would do anything for Castiel. Anything to protect him. To keep him safe from the world.” Finally, her gaze slides away from Michael and meets Dean’s own. “You’re right. I didn’t notice it at first but I don’t think I can see it in his eyes anymore. That look.”
He’s never seen anything like this before. The walls are furnished with intricate wallpaper designs made of rich colours; shades of red, white and gold. The rich red carpet covers the entire of the floor but Castiel can see the stone peeking out from underneath it at the edges. The ceiling is high above – large, glass chandeliers hanging down every twenty yards or so. Tall, glass windows and open doors let the sunlight in through the castle, a few small lanterns on the wall sitting unlit – not necessary. Castiel marvels at it all. A place like this has never been so vibrant. It must have taken years.
“The fallen angel…” He shakes his head, nausea washing over him. The fallen angel wasn’t an angel at all. It was a God. It was the God of Light. This whole time… How could they have it so wrong? But the fallen angel is--
Castiel narrows his eyes. In fact, the vessel looks strangely like him.
Castiel smiles against his mouth. “Do you like it?” he asks softly, almost sheepish.
He can’t let Dean in. He can’t get involved. He can’t know.
Dean breathes heavily, staring at the corpse below him.
But he tells her as much as he can. Of how they loathed each other, of how they hurt each other, of how they came together and how it almost tore them apart. Of Castiel revealing everything to him and how he thought Dean had betrayed him, worst of all.
“Well, Your Highness. You have to hit the middle three times in a row. But for you, Prince Sam, the prize is for free,” the man says but Sam shakes his head.
And now after a short, lukewarm bath, Castiel lies on his back in bed, staring at the ceiling. His chest still aches from letting everything out but his mind hurts the most with the amount of thoughts that churn through it. What happens now? Do they go back to pretending everything is normal? Do they continue with whatever it is between them while Castiel continues with the mission? Surely Dean will ask questions, more questions with answers that Castiel can’t give. And not only because it could put the mission at risk but also because his answers might be too absurd for Dean too handle.
He can feel the captain’s eyes on him too, switching between Dean and himself. The walls are decorated with red and gold wallpaper and a chandelier hangs from the ceiling. It’s simple but still rich and Castiel feels strangely like his dirty boots are tainting the carpet.
When he pulled the power from his own body by accident.
Dean’s chest rises and falls quickly against him and Castiel breathes in all of him.
"They're coming," he says, stepping back beside Dean. Sam's eyes fill with tears and Dean grits his teeth hard.
Dean puffs out a breath. “Lucky.”
All he knows is if he doesn’t do something soon he might never get the chance to. So, this is it.
Mr Crowley rolls his eyes. “You’re lucky you’re good at math.” Thankfully though, his teacher continues on with the lesson without humiliating him further.
“Here,” Dean says, throwing the swords to the ground. “Let’s start hand to hand.”
It’s already dark outside, the last of the sun vanished below the horizon. Dinner will be here soon. He’s already had the maids come and clean up Castiel’s bile. He wonders if he should call for Castiel or not. Surely, he’s hungry. But he might be asleep and Dean doesn’t want to wake him.
The air shifts around them as those few words slip quietly between them in the dark. Castiel takes a deep breath. Because it's time. Time for them to know the truth.
“Yes, well…” Catharlo says, clearing his throat, and finally,
“No thank you’s from you, young man. Eat up. As much as you can.”
Dean’s mind turns, the woman looking as though she is almost curious to hear his response. “Waiting for a demon to guide them to the underworld or an angel to guide them to paradise…”
“Um, yes, I just...I don’t know how to dance.” Castiel mumbles, looking towards the floor.
Castiel doesn’t respond, walking back out of the room and closing the door softly with a click. The four guards stare at him. Castiel glares back until their eyes drop away one by one.
It’s startling lonely without him. Even if it’s only been one night and one day. It’s strange, however. For he hadn’t even realised that for a little while, he wasn’t alone.
Frustration weighing on him heavily, he hides the book back under the bed before slipping out into the halls and back down a side passage.
Reyne wipes his sweaty brow. “What is it?”
"Only the chosen can wield the Three," Charlie says, finding Castiel's eyes.
“What do you want?” she says, and her voice shakes. She always thought if faced with something like this – a threat to her life – that she’d put up a mighty fight. Kyra would have. But she can do nothing but quake, fear rising in her throat and
He’s not sure how Castiel himself feels about it. He probably doesn’t care considering the amount of people he’s hooked up with.
He shrugs instead. "I don't know. I just... I don't know. And I tried not to, believe me, Sam." Sam’s eyes slip to the ground, lips turned down. "But I just couldn't stop it." He pauses, hesitating. "He makes me happy."
“Yeah, I’m free,” he says, just as his eyes widen and his hands slip out of his pockets to hang awkwardly in the air. “Uh, shit, sorry, I actually have to go. Gotta pick my brother up from a rehearsal at his school.” He grimaces, clearly embarrassed and Castiel offers him a sheepish smile.
And yet, they were terrifying. It’s something he never really thought about. It was a given that he hated the angels. But he’d never really thought about what would happen if he ever saw one. He never acknowledged that he not only felt hatred towards them but fear.
And from the bare skin he can see – she’s littered in scars. It’s only when he looks closer he realises they’re not scars. They’re wounds. He would assume then if he looked at his own stomach he’d have something similar looking there too.
When their laughter finally dissolves, they descend into silence and Dean’s unsure where to go from here. But Cillian’s already ahead of him.
Dean swallows around his food, focusing on the taste in his mouth and whatever it is that Sam’s saying. What is it that Sam is saying? He doesn’t even know. He barely even caught Hermana’s words when she came with the food and stumbled out a half-hearted thanks in response.
"We have sources that say the demon was witnessed inside the royal castle of Torrin.” He pauses. “Before the invasion."
He actually finds himself listening to Castiel’s words instead of focusing on the warmth of his arm pressed against his own. But eventually they fall into a lull, their breathing the only sounds in the night and Dean can’t resist it now. He cranes his neck, observing for any stray guards that might be able to see them but finds none. He turns his head to the side, facing Castiel and Castiel eventually does the same until they are merely inches apart.
Castiel nods. The Southern Continent has many religions to choose from. “Now you see there? Those three stars that form the head of an arrow?”
“But what are the odds that the one who did take the wings would end up in our castle? How do we know it did not just perish in Iowan with the angels?”
Castiel must sense the impending question because he continues with, “It was only after the fallen’s angel death, that they all heard the voice of their god speaking to them, telling them of the prophecy. Now that the fallen angel, their saviour was gone, a new one would take its place and be able to wield the fallen angel’s Three and save the world from darkness.”
“If that’s true, why would Leuric make the sacrifice in the first place?”
And his eyes are so determined, as if he could make Castiel believe his words with just one look. And something releases inside of him. The words are slipping from his lips before he can stop himself.
The two guards grind the door open and the scent of blood stings Dean’s nostrils. He takes a deep breath before following the guards and his father in, the generals waiting outside the closed door.
“No.” They both turn to find Reyne trailing along with Nyree towards them. “I believe it might be much worse than that.” Reyne nods to them both before continuing, voice cold. “When we took the castle, the soldiers that surrendered here were outnumbered quite significantly. But as we learned, quite a number of soldiers had fled after hearing the king had fallen and the battle was lost.”
He almost rolls his eyes. "You've always got some girl you're hanging around with."
When his breathing has calmed, he stares up at the stars as though they will tell him everything he needs to know, give him all the answers.
There’s a litany of curses from the both of them – from Castiel as he scrambles over Dean’s lap to grab a cloth to wipe the mess with – and from Dean as he plucks the glass from spilling anymore and most likely wonders what just happened.
But a world free. A world now completely and utterly alone. No higher power to watch over them.
Dean glances up at him and shoots him a quick smile as the horses pick up the pace and they get on their way. Castiel looks out the small window, praying instead to Leuric for more strength than his god can probably give.
He knows this night is only supposed to be another thing for the bet, but that doesn’t mean he can’t keep trying to get to know Castiel.
The next chapter will be posted on the 15th at ~8/9pm AEST time!
“Here’s to you,” Dean says.
Sam, meanwhile, was tasked with the unfortunate job of driving half an hour up the coast to fetch Adam from where he’s been staying for university and will be late as well.
A few more people shuffle in seemingly doing the exact same thing. By the time his classroom is full, the whole room, well, mainly the girls, are watching something on their mobile devices and chatting - or what Castiel might call squealing - with their friends.
Castiel’s father smiles. “Ah, I see,” he says, more than slightly amused now. “So, this is the boy you’ve been blowing me off for the past however many weeks.”
"No. Our human friends would have been told to spread the rumour around. To get the king's attention, in the hopes that I could go on the mission and meet with the angels to inform them of what I’d learned since entering the castle."
Castiel shakes his head. “A celebration? But I failed. I didn’t find the halo nor the location of the grace and I--”
Castiel’s eyes fall to his beer before he says, “I’m vegetarian.”
Castiel swears that his mind is playing tricks on him. But when he looks up and to the left, Dean is sitting there with a smile on his face that seems to reach all the way up to his eyes. Everything suddenly stops. The laughter and chatter that filled the room just seconds ago has been replaced with complete silence and shocked faces. Just like Castiel's own.
Castiel doesn't respond for a moment, eyes shining in the light of dawn. Shining with something better than what lay there before. Hope, perhaps.
“So, Castiel,” he says, “Have you been keeping in touch with your friends since going to Sydney?”
He wants to go home.
And to know it’s fresh.
Castiel supposes it doesn’t matter. The purpose is to bring them all together and hope to re-establish connections.
So, they had to pass the duty down to another.
Throughout the rest of the week, Dean hasn’t made any attempt to begin searching, knowing he should at least wait for his wounds to heal. He’s passed by Joren in the hall once, the man nodding slightly in his direction, and seen Emery a few times – one of which was when he was picking his new guard – something that makes him feel a little more reassured.
He almost gives up looking for Emery when he finds him, quite a few men down. Finds him already looking back at Catharlo. Those brown eyes filled with…worry?
“You people. You won’t get away with this forever. You will all fall!” He charges again and Castiel only has to move to the side and let him charge right into Castiel’s waiting foot. He trips over it, falling into the floor, face first.
Sam’s huddled into Reyne’s side, the captain’s arm around him.
“But don’t worry because the next week he apologised and said it would never happen again, even told me he loved me, and I settled because everyone else had already made up their mind about me in this stupid fucking town so with my reputation I was lucky he even wanted to spend time with me.”
Castiel’s mind races. The second sacrifice? What could it be? It’s linked to the balancing of souls and Leuric could not go through with it because perhaps it had to do with killing Patrus? But Castiel doesn’t know how to do that.
Castiel stares at him, unwavering.
There are three angels waiting outside after all. He won’t live to see tomorrow if he kills Sam now. So, he can either come with them and live.
Because Dean Winchester was an honourable king. An example to everyone. Castiel of course, can barely hold in his pride for his husband thinking back on all he has done.
Dean stares at the words, something tugging inside of him. The dark and light he assumes refers to the angel's gods. And wings and halo – of course what he heard from his father. But grace, which he himself remembers reading of – his father never mentioned that.
“Yeah,” he breathes. “I was. I was terrified.”
Until he's not. Because someone has opened the closet door and Dean's pushed away from him to glance up at their friends, all crowding around to peer in, none other than mischief maker Lisa Braeden at the front.
Castiel stands where he is. Dean can feel his gaze on him but he doesn’t care. He leans back in his chair, running a hand over his face.
Dean’s face is blank before his lips twist up into the smallest of smirks. “Right. Of course. Well, let me just get a few more winks of sleep and I’ll be right up.” He shuffles around, trying to get more comfortable.
So, he speaks of that night and of his own parent’s demise and Queen Mary saving him. And when he speaks of all the angels finding each other and building a camp together, he speeds past, not wanting to look her in the eyes as he speaks those words.
He doesn’t mean to – okay, perhaps he does – but he finds himself listening in on Dean’s conversation with his friends while he waits for the rest of the students to show up for training.
About an hour ago Dean had been excited to go to Benny’s off campus Christmas party. Now, not so much.
“As it is so lovely for me to see you again.” The musicians start up and couples flock to the floor. Dean holds out his hand for Leda who takes it in her own.
Emery strides to the door and swings it open only to find a young woman standing in the hall, facing down a guard almost twice the size of her. From the way he takes a step back, however, it's clear that she is not someone to be trifled with.
“I don’t know. I think I just need to rest.”
When he looks to Patrus’, their eyes are cruel and hateful. The god grips the one sword they have left, angling forwards towards Castiel.
Castiel grins. “Isn’t that how it’s said these days?”
✧ ✧ ✧
Castiel feels like his heart might beat right out of his chest. He was probably never going to even give Dean the note anyway. It was just something to keep his hopes of actually going to prom alive.
And then, Castiel sees the shining tip of a sword piercing out through Dean’s stomach.
He curls his hands in the fabric of Dean’s clothes, their noses brushing and foreheads grazing as they press impossibly closer. There’s a lightness in his chest – something he hasn’t felt in a very long time and he knows what this is.
“But the prophecy says--”
And with everything he has, he throws himself towards Patrus, rage bottled inside of him like a storm.
ride separate. Are we clear?”
“Every soul that has passed into here since the spell that made the angels fall and the gates to paradise and the underworld shut have been left waiting,” she says, her tone solemn now.
Dean's chest heaves as he sobs, thankful for the walls between him and the guards standing outside his door. And with them there, he cannot slip out for his mother's chambers just yet. But he will. Because if it can in anyway help Castiel – help Dean understand what his father is talking about, he has to try. And in the meantime, he must wait more hours in which more suffering will be inflicted on Castiel.
They move on, heading towards a wide clearing filled with nothing but angels engaging in combat training.
Dean’s heart is in his throat and he’s about to step forward when his father waves a hand.
Green eyes twinkle. “I think you already know the answer.”
be happening. How did this happen?
“Michael?” he says, confusion and terror shooting through him.
Or is this just two broken people finding comfort in the other?
His head's still fuzzy and the light still seems too bright but eventually it clears up and he looks out through the side of the crate to see where he is. The lavish buildings and well-dressed women and men are distinctive.
He turns on his heels as swiftly as possible then, nearly tripping over his own feet as he runs out of the room. He moves down the hall, past servants and guards, and throughout all the commotion no other guard thinks to follow him. All the while his heart beats out of his chest and he has to fight for every breath of air.
"Where have you been?" The smile quickly fades.
He looks himself over far too many times whilst he tucks it in and rolls then unrolls then rolls up his sleeves. Better.
They spend their afternoon at the inn they are staying at until an informant comes to tell them the mayor of Lithos is here and waiting for them at the mayor of Narla’s office. Dean is actually grateful that they finally have something to do.
"So, what’s happening with the search?" Charlie asks.
“I will speak to Dimarus about fixing it up tomorrow, then. Again, thank you.”
“It is this place. It helps keep all the souls calm whilst we wait.”
Castiel blinks. And it’s almost as though they’re right back at Anathee, training just outside the castle.
“Thanks, Sammy. Real kind of you,” he says, as Sam yelps beneath him.
Remember to check my AO3 profile page if you are ever interested in updates on how the writing/editing is coming along! Much love ♥
His chest tightens, emotion clawing up his throat and a stupid, naïve part of him wonders,
“Oh, you have to see inside Cas, it’s so big and filled with thousands of books.” Sam turns to Dean sharply. “Dean, you have to take him to the library.”
Castiel clenches his jaw, hating the fear that creeps into his chest. He lifts his eyes and faces his brother as he speaks. “After we escaped the castle, royal guards were sent to search the entire city. They eventually came upon the inn of one of our spies. The inn we were hiding in. I was readying myself to fight them but just as they came upon us, I… I disappeared. And Dean who was holding onto me at the time, Sam holding onto Dean… Well, they disappeared too. Just as it is with my wings.”
Castiel raises his eyebrows. “Um, yes. I do.”
“You’re dismissed,” Dean says again, this time with more weight. “You can wait outside.” He eyes both of them until they cave, nodding and exiting the room along with the guards who escorted Castiel in.
Castiel stands frozen in the grass as Dean disappears into the trees. He doesn’t know what to do. Should he follow or stay behind? If he follows will it just incite more rage? But if he stays behind – in the state Dean’s in, he fears for his safety.
This time nothing happens.
Castiel doesn’t react. He’s bluffing. He has to be. Whoever the king is, both would know of the wings and halo power but despite that, no one but Dean could possibly know for certain he’s an angel. No one else has seen his wings. Right? But he supposes the king might as well throw all his cards in because there’s nothing to lose. Because it doesn’t matter if they prove it or not. Castiel will die here anyway. Which means he really does have to play the part. To last as long as he can before someone can rescue him. And while it might be much more difficult, he can still continue with his mission from the outside.
He sighs beneath her touch but her words are ominous to his ears. This place.
Castiel's hand is still tight in his own as he steps over the threshold and Dean smiles to himself, knowing in his heart that this is the start of something beautiful. And he thinks maybe he’s been too hard on himself. That perhaps going through with that awful bet was the best worst idea he’s ever had.
He thrashes and kicks, attempts to push the large trough with his manacle wrists, anything for relief. But the guards hold him secure, never letting him up to breathe until they decide. He doesn’t know how many times he goes under but his lungs feel flayed inside of him and his head throbs so terribly he feels the impending blackness reaching for him now, almost consuming him whole.
No. No, no, no. Michael left him alone after he found him. Michael left him alone for so long. And he always resented him for it. He couldn’t have been… He couldn’t have…
He sits at his desk now, well past midnight and stares into the dark. He’s not sure it’s all caught up to him yet. It’s as if he still hasn’t accepted what happened. What he dreamt. What he, in his own dreams, had wanted.
“And no one did anything to stop you.” His voice breaks as he speaks, a choked off sob sounding from his lips. He can barely see through his tears but he looks around anyway, meeting every eye he can. “No one did anything,” he says hoarsely. “You look to me like I’m some saviour and yet you all stood by and let me suffer.”
He shrugs and Castiel’s heart sinks but then, “Of course. I mean, I got to spend more time with you, so.” And Castiel must be blushing so obviously because Dean’s lips curve up into a bright smile.
Castiel blinks. “To me?”
“I know a way. A way that we can get to him. I saw it with my own eyes. He has a weakness.” His father doesn’t need to say the words. Dean already knows. He’s the weakness. His father will use him against Castiel.
His father sits on the rickety, wooden chair in front of Castiel, Dean standing close behind as the two guards make their way around the posts behind Castiel.
Dean leans forward, the tugging sensation becoming stronger.
But the king doesn’t appear to take in his answer, firing off the next question. “How many rebels are you working with and what are they planning?”
Dean nods. “Right.” He pauses, chewing on his bottom lip. “But how did you… Do you think I would ever be able to do something like that?”
Castiel grabs Dean’s hand before it can slip from his own. He tries to pull away, not meeting Castiel’s eye but Castiel holds it tight.
And he lies there, his chest rising and falling gently with every breath. Castiel’s own breathing steadies and he finds his mind clear, his eyes slipping shut as he basks in this feeling.
"Well, he was a good fighter. It's a disappointing loss." Dean nods jerkily.
“Alright, alright, I’ll get on inside but don’t be too long out here or else the food will go cold and I would like to catch up before I pass out.”
The meeting is adjourned after discussing a few less important matters and Dean is up and out of his seat before any of the other men in the room. Castiel closes his eyes, still processing the information he’s just received before following the prince.
Unfortunately, I was unable to post this chapter on the Saturday, however, I was able to get it up in the normal weekly schedule and so I'm still pretty happy with that since this week was pretty awful. I have to say the posting might be a bit bumpy in the next little while as I've frustratingly just been given new medications to try for my depression and that never goes smoothly lol so I'll keep updating you all here if I don't get the next chapter up by the usual Saturday ~8/9pm AEST and letting you know but you'll just have to bear with me. Apologies for that and thank you all for your lovely comments! They really mean a lot <3

He turns, slowly beginning to make his way out.

“Alissande,” Dean calls before she can leave. She turns, eyes bright. “You’ll be needed here again tomorrow. Castiel will need your help.” Realisation dawns on her face, her lips pulling into a frown. She nods again and slips out the door.
Dean steps backwards, panic spiking in his veins before he composes himself. He can’t show his father that he is afraid. Even if he is standing in front of him, running his finger down the blade of his dagger.
“Sure.”
He didn't have to leave him behind. Just like he thought he would.
Dean’s head drops and he leans heavily back against the table as if it’s the only thing holding him up. “I’m sorry I couldn’t do more,” Dimarus says.
“Seb, this is Cas. Cas, this is my mate, Seb.”
"What about you? Are you okay?" Castiel asks. Dean shakes his head.
______________________________________
“Castiel,” Michael says, voice laced with that all too familiar rage once more. “What are you--"
“It has an army,” Nyree says, words airy.
“My duty is to keep you safe and letting you wander alone in the gardens is--”
He lost Dean. The demon wasn’t possessing the king. He lost Dean.
All this time. All this time Cas…
Comment below or leave some kudos if you enjoyed! Thanks so much for reading ♥
"Getting comfy," Dean says, as if this is any other conversation and he hasn't just planted his head on Castiel's crotch.
Emery grins, patting him on the arm as he strolls into Dimarus’ office. “See you then.”
______________________________________
“It’s probably best that you wait out here.” Castiel nods, stepping aside as Dean enters. His father is standing beside the throne in deep conversation with a guard but he notices Dean immediately, ushering him forward.
Castiel hesitates, afraid to move closer so instead he walks backwards, eyes still on the corpse before him.
“However, not all went as you hoped, did it?” Castiel holds his eyes, unflinching. “No matter, you got there nonetheless. Now,” Michael says, taking a step closer, eyes glinting in the light. “Tell me everything.”
Castiel voices his thoughts for him, anxiety growing. “What happens now?” He tries not to think too hard about what Dean’s answer might be. Because he knows deep down that one answer will hurt him more than he’d like to admit. Even though it shouldn’t.
Michael slides into his stance, sword raised, mouth parting to form around cruel words he’s sure when Castiel drops his wooden sword to the ground. Michael pauses, lowering his own.
to a casual place or a fancy place – without even consulting him because they know he’s too nice and will cave in eventually without them even having to beg.
“I actually had a few things I needed to speak to you about.” The ‘in private’ doesn’t need to be said for it’s clear that Charlie can see the apprehension in his eyes.
“Your brother on the other hand. Well, I will say it wasn’t with complete ease that he told us the truth. But as soon as he heard his brother’s predicament – that he was to be tortured until he broke – he gave in instantly. Told us everything we needed to know to save you from that pain.”
But as suddenly as it comes, his smile falls.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You. I demand to speak to the Captain right this instant as apparently no one else in the gods damned castle will answer--"
“If I was a worse man, I would slit your throat. Let you drown in your own blood.”
They don’t ride with anywhere in mind. Nor do they ride very far. Their horses trot them over to the fields, spreading towards the treeline and the cliffs further beyond in the east.
“I am calm,” Dean grits out, pushing himself back up to his feet. The hall is getting dark, the sun moving lower on the horizon and casting the castle in intricate shadows. It’s a blessing for it means they will be done here very soon.
If only he’d known. Then perhaps he wouldn’t have opened his mouth. Then perhaps Castiel wouldn’t have struck him and with that same blind anger, he’d struck back. Maybe Michael wouldn’t have thought he had to save him and dragged him away causing him to remember--
Castiel’s on his feet in the blink of an eye, heart pounding in his chest.
“You’re Prince Winchester!” one of the ladies cuts him off. “Oh, Your Highness, it is such a pleasure to finally speak to you in person,” she says, and all of the ladies bow as one.
He even found himself strangely nervous when he woke this morning, knowing he would see him tonight. It got to the point where he even tried to brush himself up a little bit, putting on an outfit that he reckons makes him look ruggedly handsome, if he says so himself.
He flinches when there is a knock on the outside door. This is it. All of this gone. And Castiel is already pulling away, ready to head out into the dining hall. But Dean grabs for him before he can leave his chambers, pulling him roughly towards him and kissing him hard, a hand clutching at the side of Castiel’s face as if holding on tight enough might mean he can keep him here – might mean he can keep him safe.
“You’re damn right,” Brady says, Seb agreeing.
His smile must have faded for Dean’s eyebrows pull together in concern.
Castiel on the other hand, only tries enough to parry Dean’s heavy blows and occasionally strike himself.
The group decided on Wednesday to see some cheesy looking comedy flick and despite the fact that it genuinely looks like an atrocity they choose to see it anyway. Once inside the cinema, Castiel glances around to find there aren’t that many people there as Dean practically shoves him all the way up to the back row.
Their wings hang low and he realises that they are the last ones left of their immediate family. Elaria still has Adri of course but her own parents and sister are gone.
“Sounds like a nice guy,” Dean says, huffing a laugh. Castiel narrows his eyes.
Once again, he doesn’t want to scream. This time he only wants to cry.
Castiel grunts, almost rolling his eyes at the statement.
He lets his eyes slip shut, breathing through his nose to keep the panic at bay. Not only is he trying to figure out what any of this could mean, he’s also dealing with the revelation that he’s the only one who can save Castiel.
Castiel meets her eyes once more, hesitant but she only holds his gaze, tells him something through it. Perhaps, that he doesn’t have to be ashamed. For Castiel untenses slightly and allows himself to be taken to the baths. A room awaits them, the bath already full, steam rising from it, another angel outside telling them to fetch for them if they need any more hot water.
Dean turns to find Castiel dressed in grey sweatpants and a loose shirt, socks still clinging to his feet and for some reason, it makes him smile – even if it’s just a small one.
"Where are you coming from?" Castiel asks, wrapping up his headphones and shoving them inside his pocket.
______________________________________
But there is something wrong here. Something he can’t shake.
He doesn’t resist. He hangs his head and now does he pray. Pray that this stupid, broken part of him hasn’t ruined everything.
He doesn’t know what to do. He remembers back to when Castiel was first dragged in that day, eyes challenging and dark. He wishes he’d just let them throw him in the dungeons. He wishes he never had to gaze into those eyes long enough to get lost in them.
After a moment, he lets out a deep breath. “Okay.”
Nyree’s eyes soften then and she pushes herself to her feet. She holds her head high and Castiel can see the crown that once sat there. Her black wings are spread wide and powerful. Castiel remembers thinking his wings were ugly as a child, no one else in the family having black wings of their own. When Elaria and Kyra tumbled into his room that fateful day, he realised there was nothing ugly about him at all.
All those nights after the invasion. All those homeless nights, where he slept in the cold shivering, his own fingers turning purple. All those months. All those years making do with what they had. Putting himself last. No, Michael putting him last. Because he was too selfish to do it himself.
Castiel stares at the grave, hearing the shrieking in his head all over again. “It doesn’t matter,” he says, and his chest aches. “It would have been killed sooner or later.”
warning: mention of offscreen misgendering (not intended with malice)
He squeezes his eyes shut. He can barely breathe.
And honestly Castiel doesn’t know what to think. Except that his lips appear to pull into the smallest of smiles when Dean and his friends laugh and trade jokes at each other. So, when Dean finishes their assigned laps with the rest of the group and bends over, hands on his knees, panting hard, Castiel says, chiming in for the first time, “You can run some extra laps if you want to impress me some more.”
"How many angels live?" he asks, suddenly remembering her earlier words that they are to travel to find them.
“It’s okay, Dean.” He swallows around the lump in his throat. “I understand.”
Castiel gasps, chest constricting and there’s blood on his face and his hands, on his knees and his boots and he can’t breathe, can’t breathe as his mind breaks, tearing itself back to the past.
Castiel is impressed. Dean is a decent fighter, beating the guard in only a few strikes. He’s quick on his feet with good balance but still, he has a lot to improve. Dean looks to Castiel when they’re finished, waiting for instruction and Castiel definitely doesn’t give him the satisfaction of telling him he’s a good fighter or even hinting at it with his own face.
They sit there for a while, Dean on his knees beside Castiel, pulling him to his chest until the muffled sobs fade completely. Dean had called for Castiel after his lesson had ended, having only seen him wander off a few minutes earlier. With no response he had gone looking and found Castiel’s swords and daggers on the floor.
A man parts the line of soldiers, taking to the front.
Castiel laughs along with the others, but he’s vaguely aware of Dean’s leg brushing his under the table.
“Do you think all of it is true? With the fallen angel and the righteous man? Do you believe that’s really why the angels fell?”
It’s hard to see in the dark so with a few deep breaths, Dean plunges his hand down into the small carved out space. His fingers brush old leather, wrinkled and covered in dust and cobwebs. Dean pulls it out, holding it up in the moonlight.
Dean clutches his shield tight. This is it. There’s no turning back now. Despite the urge to turn and run as far away as he can. To sink to his knees here and now and give in.
“It’s getting dark. We should head back now.” Dean runs a hand over his face and when he opens his eyes there’s a hand extended out in front of him. Dean stares at it before blinking. Castiel’s face is once again blank but Dean notices the slight heave of his chest. He doesn’t think about it. He goes for it, grabbing Castiel’s hand with his own.
Dean’s gut twists at the thought of Castiel’s brother. He’d observed him in the distance as he held Castiel in the dirt. Observed as his brother looked upon them, eyes too hard to read from so far away. Until Dean had gathered Castiel up and taken him away – only then, the crowd beginning to disperse.
“Everything they did to me,” Castiel says, and he wishes he could go back, kill Patrus all over again, “Everything I went through. It’s all gone. They took everything from me. Everything.”
And then Castiel grabs him by the front of his shirt and leans up to kiss him. And Dean’s chest floods with warmth because Castiel chose to kiss him instead. Castiel
Dean stands before him, and even though he can’t get mad at Cillian, it doesn’t mean he’s exactly thrilled about what’s to come.
“Woah, alright. Okay. I’m not mocking you. I’m just...trying to understand.”
______________________________________
When he opens his eyes, the memories almost don’t seem real.
Dean’s eyes are bright in the dark. “I need you too.” They gaze at each other, Castiel calming the rate of his heart until Dean’s eyes flick down to his lips once more.
"Then what?" Dean asks, and it's clear in his voice now. How overwhelmed he is. Just like Sam. But he's trying hard not to show it.
And it’s not enough.
Dean tugs his hand from Castiel’s grasp and his stomach twists. “He was taken by a
Until they can’t be used against him. And he is left with nothing but the roaring power that flows through him and the will to fight until his very last breath.
Until now. For everything is back in focus.
“No, that’s quite alright. My friend here would like to try.” Dean’s not the only one caught off by the word friend – Castiel jerking his head towards his younger brother, mouth slightly parted, searching for words.
But he doesn’t say anything and for that, Castiel is grateful.
A warm hand is suddenly grazing above his brow, smoothing the hair out of his face and Castiel lets his eyes slip shut.
“Yes, you’re right. But something should still be done. If it be to apologise at the least, to have those redeem themselves--”
Michael is the first to nod before his eyes lock on Dean. “Don’t make me regret it.” Dean doesn’t respond, only holding his eyes before Michael finally looks away. Reyne shoots Castiel a slight sympathic look before nodding himself. Nyree has the same sympathy in her eyes when he looks to her.
Someone moving amongst the dead layed carefully on the wagons.
“About how to kill it?” Castiel asks quietly and slowly. Dean holds his eyes for a few moments, time stretching on forever before he nods.
Dean softens. “I know. It’s just…”
Dean is here, Dean is here, Dean is--
"You dick!"
“I said,” his father punctuates slowly, “what evidence do you have of that?”
Castiel’s heart aches as he shakes his head. “I’m sorry, Sam but I need you to stay here. For your own safety.” Sam’s face crumples again and Castiel almost can’t bear to look at it. “Nyree will make sure you’re looked after, I promise. And if you head for camp Mary will be waiting.”
He can’t think of anything more embarrassing. But by the time they finish and make their way back to him, ready to start the session, no one says a word – not even a whistle or a strange look – and it leaves Castiel wondering if Dean’s even told his friends. Perhaps, he’s doing the same as Castiel. Waiting to see if it’s a hit or not before he spills.
For their lover was to descend into torture and pain for the rest of their life for something they had not done, the angel made a sacrifice. It couldn’t defeat the God of Darkness and their own god would never make the sacrifice themselves, so it drew all the essence that made them something holy. That made them something not human.
“You can’t leave,” Dean rasps, the emotion overwhelming him. He still has a hand on Castiel’s arm and if he wasn’t out in the open with so many people watching he would clutch his face and hold it to his.
William appears at the door of the carriage, helping both Sam and Castiel down the steps, Dean following closely behind and straight into the open door to the small inn waiting for them. The warm smell of freshly baked bread hits his nostrils as soon as he steps foot over the threshold. It's enough to have his mouth watering.
"I've never hated you."
Suddenly, a hand is on his shoulder.
“Dean.” Dean stops, letting his mouth shut. “It’s fine. Really.” And he wants to say more but finds that he can’t. The words just won’t come to him. Or more like the courage. He’s never been good at this.
There are plenty of animals too. He now understands why the angels don’t eat them. Because long ago, they would have guided their souls too.
“Despite what we have said or not said in the past, Emery is not our only spy in the castle,” she says.
“Alright, enough of this!” Nyree snaps, finally lifting Castiel’s head and there’s something fierce in her eyes. “Michael, go to your cabin. Now.” Michael doesn’t even bother fighting her, merely turning and leaving without another glance in their direction. “Dean, get Castiel inside the cabin and keep him warm until the tub and water arrives. I will have no more training until we all meet again and speak of what is going on here.”
Dean lets out a rough breath, popping the top of the vial off with his teeth before dripping it over his fingers.
Sam’s cries immediately stop and his head lifts, eyes wide with fear and hope.
None of them know everything has already shattered. That the end has already come.
“You know, you don’t have to call me ‘sir’ all the time.”
And he doesn’t say anything, only staring back at him.
A hard thumping, over and over and as he gets closer, the added sound of rough breathing. He steps around a large tree to see Michael’s back slightly turned towards him as he, in perfect form, punches the body of a tall, thick tree over and over.
“Where?” A small, sad smile pulls at Dean’s lips.
A small, “Oh,” falls from his lips as Dean takes the seat opposite his desk. “And?”
He hears William behind him tell the boy to take the carriage around back before closing the door to the inn behind him. Flicking his eyes around, the first thing he sees are their hosts. A man and a woman looking roughly ten years further along than his own father gesturing for Sam and then Castiel to come into the back.
Emery had also helped him with tonight. He’d told Dean to come to the library late and tell Catharlo he wanted to browse. He’d said he could easily distract the big man for as long as he needed.
“…he was caught attempting to…” Nicolaus’ voice goes quieter and Castiel slumps. The dull throb in his head aches more now. He hears footsteps approach, not bothering to twist his body to look again, and suddenly there’s a banging on the side of the crate. Castiel squeezes his eyes shut and turns his head away, his head throbbing at the loud noise.
And to suddenly be expected after all of it to turn around and save them all.
"Thank you. We couldn't have asked for more," Castiel says, guilt festering even as he speaks. Because no one would have to go to this trouble if he hadn't gotten himself into this mess.
They breathe together. Just like that. In the light of day locked away in Dean’s chambers.
But then he sees Dean sleeping soundly beside him and he curls closer, laying his head back down to fall asleep.
The tree line stands empty.
When he doesn’t join in, Dean meets his eyes once more, the half smile gone – replaced with something that looks like fear. “Cas?” His name falls from Dean’s lips so quietly, it’s almost a whisper. His eyes don’t hide the vulnerability that lingers there. “Cas, please. What are you…” He can’t even bring himself to finish the sentence. Castiel does it for him.
He crosses his legs underneath him and lets his hands lie limply in his lap. His eyes softly close and he chooses to focus on the feeling of his feet, where they rest on the cold, stone floor. Anything to keep him from focusing on the shouts of the prisoners and the smell of the piss, shit, blood and whatever else hangs in the air – the pain that seems to finds its way into every nook and cranny of his body, his head throbbing too hard for him to focus on healing just yet – and the fact that he’s sitting in the dungeon of the royal castle of Torrin. The castle, in which also sits a king. The same one who started a war ten years ago to wipe out Castiel’s entire species – the angels.
“We should name him,” Sam says, breaking Dean out of his reverie. Castiel tilts his head to the side in thought. It reminds him of a bird.
But Castiel is glazed over, staring at the wound as the blood dribbles down his palm.
“So for the lucky fifty thousand viewers who are watching this live - most of which seem to be in this hallway,” Dean smirks, earning himself a collective laugh from the students, “you guys get to see my partner of two years now, first hand! And brace yourselves because they are somehow the hottest and most adorable person I have ever seen.”
Despite his own beliefs when alive – although recent – her words ripple up his spine.
Nothing, of course, is different. It appears no one has entered the chambers in a while, dust spreading across the desk and bookshelves. When Dean opens the balcony doors a much-needed gust of fresh air sweeps in.
His chest aches at the mere thought of it. Because even after his betrayal – after everything, what he feels for him…it won’t go away. No matter how hard he tries.
“Well,” Dean says, finally taking a seat, “I apologise, then, for not coming to you.”
If the angels have been in hiding this entire time, they clearly aren’t trying to hurt anyone. And as for corrupting Dean after kidnapping him… Dean didn’t appear corrupted at all. Only determined. Determined to do something. He doesn’t know what.
He makes it to his chambers, locking both doors behind him.
“Best school camp yet?” she says, raising a fist.
Patrus stands beside the portal, blood still smeared across it. But Patrus’ chest is healed completely.
Because not only is Castiel completely and utterly gay but they didn’t just ‘know each other’ in high school, they were as close as any two friends could be.
It’s only half full but it doesn’t take long for someone to notice him as he makes his way to the kitchens to stand in line to collect his morning bowl. He keeps his eyes ahead of him as he hears the quiet chatter quiet even further throughout the building and he can certainly feel it when eyes start finding him, one by one.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t be ignorant. The king has other everyday affairs to attend to. In three days, is the closest he could arrange. And do not misinterpret this. He spoke to me personally that it was of the utmost importance.”
“So, as all of you know the spring equinox ball was pushed back as matters were brought to us and they need to be given the upmost attention,” a general begins, face grim. “For those of you who haven’t heard, word came from Lithos that travellers passing through had claimed sightings of angels near the Ellwood Forest.” Castiel’s eyes widen minutely before he’s able to clear his features of any emotion. But inside, his chest squeezes tight.
______________________________________
“What?” Castiel shakes his head.
All he needs to do is last until midnight. Only a few hours to go. He can get through this.
“That night. It was the same night. It was the same gods
It’s why he still can’t understand it. For he’s been filled with love since as long as he can remember. And his love for Dean is great – greater than any emotion he’s felt before.
“You do?” He doesn’t respond, eyes pointedly resting on the musicians. Suddenly, the thought comes to him that Castiel is ashamed of his desire as he cannot fully commit to the suggestion with his fear of intimacy. “It’s nothing to be ashamed of,” Dean says softly and Castiel eyes are sharply on him. “If I tell Leda--”
He doesn't feel particularly refreshed after a mostly dreamless sleep but he does feel better than he has in the last half moon when he finally wakes. He washes his face in his personal bathing chambers and pulls his clothes on before slipping quietly out of his room and padding his way downstairs, not wanting to disturb Sam and Dean.
At some other point, Castiel’s knees start to ache from the hard wood underneath them. But he can’t move into another position – his arms shackled too tightly to allow any upper body movement or allow him to sit comfortably cross legged on the floor.
It’s a hot day, the sun beating down on them as they paddle down the river, girls on either side chatting away idly and at some point, even bursting into song. Castiel seems to be enjoying himself and even more so when the girls coax Dean into singing along with them.
Just outside the royal castle of Iowan.
“Good thing you have such a big head, Sammy, or else this wouldn’t have fit a boy,” he says, earning a hard punch in the arm.
Why would he…
suffering?”
He screeches to a halt when he gets there and quickly runs down it – night is drawing over now but he can still easily make out the six figures lying in different places down the alley.
“See you on Monday, Dean,” he says softly, and before he loses the courage he somehow plucked from within, he turns and walks towards his own car.
When Reyne tears his eyes away from the sky and looks at her, the curve of her cheek, the softness of her hands, the warmth of her brown eyes, he thinks that if they live tomorrow, if they somehow manage to survive, that he will speak to her again.
Castiel's eyes flutter shut, the feel of Dean's lips is completely overwhelming but he wants more. Before he can get any further though, Dean is pulling away to the sound of students whistling and Mr Crowley telling them to 'get each other's tongues out of their mouths and get back to work'.
Castiel’s eyes sting with tears at his hatred. “Yes. I’m one of them. And you still fell for me.” He doesn’t know where it comes from but he knows it now more than ever. Dean wouldn’t have kissed him or touched him like that if he hadn’t fallen for him. Why else would he risk it? If anyone found out, it could only end in shame and humiliation. And if he wasn’t a prince, possibly death. There’s no denying it now.
His heart thuds in his chest.
“No, you don’t have to apologise. It’s my fault. I can make it up to you, I promise,” he says, tears brimming again as he forces himself to be the brave man he should be.
Castiel huffs. “Yes, probably. I don’t really know. I mean, we sort of broke up a quite a few months ago. Didn’t you know?” he finishes, watching the smile on his Grandma’s face turn into a frown.
Dean daydreams about that smile for the rest of the day.
Dean laughs until he cries into her neck and thinks perhaps there are still some good things waiting to surprise him in this world.
Emery’s eyes soften. And he knows Catharlo knows now. It doesn’t make speaking it aloud any harder.
But he hasn’t yet mastered it. He doesn’t have enough in him to hold the ability for long. So, he’s decided he will save it until he has found the demon on the battlefield. Then perhaps it will give him the upper hand.
he thinks.
He pauses, takes a breath.
“Dean,” he says, in way of greeting.
She holds his eyes for a moment and Dean wonders how bad it is. How many there are. She swallows, speaking quietly. “They were everywhere. Some small.” She pauses. “Some not so small.” Dean tries to conjure an image in his head but finds he can’t. “He didn’t like to be touched,” she whispers and Dean nods.
Castiel and Dean lie on a picnic rug they brought. Castiel's reading his book with Dean lying beside him, eyes closed and one arm slung over Castiel's waist.
“So…” Dean starts, clearing his throat loudly. “I was just wondering if maybe you’d like to, you know, go out again sometime?”
“No, it’s fine. I…” Dean glances up to meet Castiel’s eyes, open and free of judgement. He’s never spoken to anyone about this. Dimarus and Heymon and many of the generals know – they were there to witness his father’s rage after that night. “It was a little while after we found out the angel’s plan to invade us. My father, mother, Sam and myself were moved into a more secure chambers all together in the centre of the castle.” He pauses, inhaling deeply.
He kneels on the hard, wooden floor, eyes on the king’s immaculate boots.
He’s not sure how he’s supposed to feel. After all he’s discovered in such a short time. After his mother…
Castiel turns towards the rockface and scrutinises all of the dents and marks as he starts to move his arms and legs so not to freeze in place. Other than the blistering cold, it’s a beautiful day. He wouldn’t mind coming back here again. If Dean would allow it.
They work mostly in silence for the next little while but Dean certainly doesn’t miss the few times Castiel looks at his phone, seemingly at the texts he keeps receiving and the way his whole face seems to fall and even though he clearly tries to hide it, Dean knows he’s upset. At what though, he's not sure. At least it’s not because of him. Or at least he hopes so.
Catharlo stares at him for a moment before he takes a step closer and suddenly, his lips are on Emery’s, softer than he remembered, brighter in his chest than he remembered.
He sniffs, wiping his free hand over his face. “He was always so kind when I was younger,” Castiel whispers, voice soft and broken. “But the war changed him and after, he wasn’t so kind.” Dean rests his cheek on Castiel’s shoulder, squeezing his hand. So, he was right. It was his brother. All along.
“Hey,” Dean says, voice somehow soothing him to his core. How can the sound of one man’s voice be so calming? “Let me.”
“I promise.”
Comment below or leave some kudos if you enjoyed!
Something snaps inside of Castiel at his words and he feels his own emotions welling up in his throat. “What about what you did?”
He clears his throat awkwardly, not knowing how to respond. Sam saves him luckily, appearing out of the hallway, hair damp but fully dressed once more.
Castiel blinks. Eternal peace for all souls? Does that mean Leuric wanted all souls to go to paradise? That can’t be right.
Castiel does and the weight of them in his hands is reassuring. “Thank you, Your Highness,” he says, and this time it’s sincere. Because Leuric truly must be watching over him.
He still can't stop the tears from falling when he whispers, "I have to."
He peruses the bound books, not necessarily looking for anything, more using it as excuse to have a moment alone – Catharlo thankfully allowing him the luxury.
Dean curses under his breath, pushing his seat back and kneeling down beside him. "Hey, Sammy, it's alright. Don't worry, I'm here." He rubs a hand up and down his back and takes a hold of one of Sam's hands with his free one. "Don't worry. It's all gonna be okay. We'll be there soon and then we'll finally get to settle in for good, yeah?" Dean ducks his head, trying to catch Sam's eyes. And he hates this, hates how this feels like someone is digging inside his chest and squeezing it tight. But what other choice did he have?
He dresses and eats and does feel slightly better, slightly less foggy. Stepping outside is the hardest part because he can’t relish the fresh air that fills his lungs and caresses his skin with angels everywhere going about their day. Not after what he did.
Victor’s mouth drops open and Michael laughs loudly as Castiel watches bewildered as he continues to run his hardest around the bend. He didn’t mean it literally.
He leaves swiftly and Dean is left alone, his hands still warm from cradling his jaw. He releases a shuddering breath. What is happening to him? He didn’t even get a chance to apologise. He hopes his touch said enough. Deep down though he knows it’s not enough. He stands from the chair and finishes dressing, trying to think about what he might have to face back at the castle.
Elaria departs then, tells them she has to get back to Adri but that she will speak to them later.
“Oh c’mon, Cas. You need to get the full experience! And dancing is definitely part of the experience.” Dean says, before standing up and hold out his hand.
As if reading his mind, Castiel says, "It's not deep. We can both get down easily, and you'll be able to drag the grate back across."
Dinner is quiet. Well, not exactly quiet. Sam rattles on to Mervyn next to them and some of the guards and generals around them are obnoxiously loud but…Dean is quiet. Castiel is quiet too – although that’s not unusual.
The door creaking open has him glancing over to find Castiel peeking through once more. “Would you like your dinner, Your Highness?” he asks and Dean exhales roughly before nodding. Castiel opens the door wide ushering in Alissande who holds another bowl of soup on a platter. She nods towards him as she places it down on the table by his bedside and he swings his legs over the side, sitting up straight.
And as if he wasn’t already insufferable, now he has powers of an angel. Michael’s restrictions on them so far have appeared useless. It doesn’t matter that Castiel can only use one power and only as many times as Michael tells him, Castiel always gets them.
And Dean wants to fucking punch them. Wants to sock all three of them in their stupid faces. And everyone who fucking laughed at him.
“And we could help paint him as a victim, lessen some of the suspicion off of him,” Reyne says, quiet and reserved, speaking for the first time. “We could form a plan for that. Involve you, Castiel, as well. But I have to say, for you,” his eyes find Dean’s, “you would have to take your brother with you. It would be too suspicious otherwise.”
With the swords, it is easier. Dean is out of range and their touches only ever last a few moments. But Dean’s gaze is still heavy on him and he can’t seem to rid himself of the heat that sends colour up the back of his neck and paints his cheeks at the image of Dean above him, breath hot and eyes dark.
Castiel looks to the ground for a moment before taking a breath and closing his eyes once more. But after a while, nothing happens and Castiel opens his eyes, fists clenched.
"I know you're not hungry. But just eat a little bit. For me." Castiel's eyes sting all of a sudden and he nods, taking the bread and keeping his head down as he begins to eat, little by little, forcing the food around the lump in his throat. Dean glances around the room, not saying anything, only passing him another small piece of bread and fruit after he’s finished until the food is gone and no sounds of chewing and swallowing can interrupt the silence.
Thankfully, the book of poems is still there, the one filled with more memories of his mother than anything else he ever had.
Surprised laughter to his right has him spying Emery standing alongside another bigger guard. They stand up straight, hands behind their back but they smile back at each other, eyes sincere.
“I don’t care about whatever is next!” Castiel shouts, turning on his brother and the rest of the camp. “You allowed this to happen, you encouraged him to do this. Neither of them would be in danger if any of you had listened to me!”
“--you know that, right?” Dean is saying once he can finally hear. The distinct crack of a fist hitting someone’s face echoes through the warehouse.
“So, this is it, then? The jig is up?” Dean says, as he steps down beside Castiel, close enough that their arms brush.
It’s dark now but this far out of the city, the moon and stars are as clear as ever.
Because the moment his fingers brush his shoulder, Dean whirls, taking Nicolaus’ wrist in one hand, placing his palm on his chest and forcing him down, sticking his foot out to trip him.
But before he can do anything, voices echo through the spiralling hall. Servants. He swears under his breath before gritting his teeth, legs still on either side of the walls holding him up as he secures his hands on the outside of the window.
“Michael,” Dean shouts, causing him to stop. He strides up beside him, raising his own sword now. Nicolaus sneers at him when they meet each other’s eyes. “This one was a royal guard at the castle. Sworn to serve and protect those of the royal family.” Dean steps forward, some of that darkness in Michael rising up in him. “This one’s mine.”
Castiel doesn’t even bother glancing at what’s laid out before him, instead staring into those sparkling, green eyes.
“Oh,” he says, because it dawns on him now that Dean’s never seen him laugh before. Perhaps through anger or incredulity or on an exhaled breath. But not like that. Loud and free. Castiel’s never really had a reason to. Nor smile as wide or as freely either.
Despite the commotion, both servants and guards are still far enough away that Castiel can speak freely.
He stumbles all the way back to where the healers are set up, so many wounded, crying and screaming and he’s barely aware of it but he can’t just stand by so as he runs, he presses his hands to the worst wounds he can find, his power flowing through him, the healing a little easier now and he sees sharp gazes filled with gratefulness as he goes but he can’t hear anything but the pounding in his head and in his heart and Dean’s name over and over again and--
Something flickers in Patrus’ gaze, something amused and cruel. “It would make sense that you would think that way. You are Leuric’s blood after all. Because you know the story, don’t you? Leuric fell in love with a mortal man. Mortal man’s brother’s heart was poisoned by one of my demons. Mortal man sold their soul in exchange for their place in the underworld. And of course, when Leuric found out, when Leuric found out I’d done it to more humans than just that one, they weren’t forgiving.”
"Dean. You're alright?" Dimarus asks, but there's already astounding relief in his voice and Dean knows his friend thought he would be long dead by now.
Castiel’s chest caves like the waves breaking against the cliff and his shoulders shake as he begins to cry – loud sobs that wrack his body.
"Really?" he says quickly, feigning nonchalance.
And there is nothing to say. Goodbyes have already been said.
Someone screams beside him and suddenly another woman is crashing down beside him, encircling the angel in her arms.
“What do you have to say for yourself?” he asks, eyes dark – always dark when he’s speaking to Dean.
Castiel doesn’t blink. Doesn’t glance down at where he grips the training sword. He knows it’s not. Because he knows Michael is trying to goad him on. Make him slip.
Castiel nods. "Well, I'm gay. Loud and proud too, I guess." Dean's brain short circuits for a moment and he's left staring at Castiel with his mouth slightly open, not knowing what on earth he should say because holy shit, Castiel is gay.
Kalapell is not a poor town but it's not the richest either. The carriage is pulled by two brown horses, groomed to perfection and the carriage itself is made of rich, lacquered wood with silver latches that appear as though they may have been polished for hours on end for Castiel can practically see the bridge in their reflection. The two men sitting at the front, reins in hands, are guards. With the help of the carriage’s lanterns bobbling overheard, Castiel can further see the emblem sewn onto their right breasts. It's the house of a noble – he's not sure which one, although it’s most certainly real – but what he is sure of is that it belongs to a noble family in Anathee, the capital of Torrin.
The Saviour of the Fallen. The Guider of the Souls.
He hates that it’s the last thing he thinks. Dean is nothing to him. He is just another human.
Sam shakes his head. “No, it’s not. That was something you chose. And I’ll forever be grateful.” Dean’s eyes sting, throat suddenly dry. “You followed your heart. And though I’m still coming to terms with everything we’ve been through – and part of me thinks I always will be – I can see it, Dean. You set us on the right path. You led us to the right people. You led us to where we are supposed to be.”
She sits them down once more and begins from where she left off. Saving Castiel. Finding the rest of the angels and heading further into the Ellwood together.
“Just give me--”
“So, how was your morning, Cas?” Sam asks, raising his voice above the noise of other men, before Castiel has barely taken his seat at the table.
And they’re beautiful. The stars, bright and shining. Old and new.
“You should drink,” Castiel says bluntly, face blank. Dean takes it, cradling it in both hands and gulps it all down in one go. Castiel takes the glass back and Dean sags into his pillow, raising his hands to run them over his face.
The night after, Castiel had finally spoken when Catharlo had asked Emery again why they were heading to Terrowin.
Castiel sighs, eyes slipping closed as if he’s shaken himself out of the grief that he’s reliving. “I wasn’t granted the halo right away. They wanted me to take my time getting used to the wings first. It was sensible. For it took me many years to completely take control of my physical healing ability and that of which to hide my wings. Something that clearly I have still not entirely figured out.” Castiel frowns, pausing a moment before sighing. “Unfortunately, it wasn’t for the best. Restricting the halo from me. For now, it’s been taken. By you father. Possibly by the demon.”
She doesn’t speak so he continues on. He tells her how it was all revealed to him, the truth of the angels, the mission and the demon. He tells her how they thought the demon was possessing the king.
“We’ll never work out.”
God of Light in mortal form.”
“Put the blade down, Nicolaus,” he says, voice soft.
Sam nods slowly as Dean shoots him a small smile. He looks at his boots, thinking of something else to say when Sam speaks, “Why did he disagree with you?”
Sam turns back to catch both their eyes. Dean nods. And without another word, he begins to walk forward, Castiel guiding Dean after his brother, merely a few paces behind.
A moment later, and the light was gone, in a swirl above him. Before it too burst and vanished. Castiel wings reappeared in full, black and beautiful and Castiel’s wound, healed.
Dean frowns. “Nearly?”
And Castiel doesn’t want him to. He wants to stay here forever. Through all his pain and misery, at least he has someone to hold him.
Dean stares at the words, phone gripped tightly in his hand, until his screen darkens.
Dean sighs, nodding and leads the way inside the inn.
When he pulls himself onto the top, he finds no soldiers waiting for him outside. There are more coming but there being slain by angels coming from behind.
“Hey, I’m sorry about earlier. I swear I wasn’t being a fuckin’ perv or anything,” he says, rubbing the back of his neck, cheeks tinged pink. “My friends are just fucking assholes and wanted to embarrass me.”
Castiel and the demon will be there.
His hands don’t find Dean, staying clenched in between them, as if still guarding himself from whatever might come. Dean pulls a mere few inches away, Castiel’s breath shuddering out of him.
Could Dean know anything? It’s unlikely considering the relationship with his father and so far, Dean’s knowledge of the invasion has been minimal. Just like everyone else. Does that mean that nothing could be in here? Because if so, would Dean have found it? But Castiel has never seen him come here before. Perhaps this is the first time. Or perhaps he doesn’t do it often. That could mean that he doesn’t know anything – that he hasn’t found anything.
But now…now he doesn’t know what to believe. Were the angels really planning to wipe them out? Or was his father jealous of Mary spending her time their so often – trusting them and even becoming friends with them? Did he kill her in cold blood to blame them – to give the rest of Torrin a reason to want to slaughter the angels for their crimes?
. And there it is. The disappointment. Because obviously Cas would just do the exact same thing as the couple are doing on the example pictures. Smiling in the first one, head rested on the shoulder in the second one, a kiss in the cheek in the third one, and a kiss on the lips in the last one.
______________________________________
Castiel’s feet have him up and are carrying him out of the room before Dean can finish, slamming the door closed behind him. He leans back against the wall of the bedroom, wondering for a moment if he should leave and find somewhere else to spend until the evening comes around.
______________________________________
"Yes. Something happened. It's Cas."
But Dean knows, he never really swore to do anything but become powerful. Hold power. Wield power.
me?” he asks, voice hard with accusation and Castiel has to take a moment to even realise what he’s talking about. But when he does, his heart sinks. And now it’s his turn to let out a strangled laugh.
“No, you’re not.” Dean glances up to find that smile on Castiel’s lips.
Dean’s eyes soften. “It was barely another hour before I made my leave. But you don’t have to worry about that.”
Castiel doesn’t look to him though, hand to his bloodied nose, eyes on the cement in front of him, glazed over in shock. Dean falls to his knees beside him, one hand falling to his back, the other grabbing the hand that’s bloodied from his nose.
It's a long day. Castiel sees Dean and Sam on occassion. They mostly spend their time outside, Dean no doubt still trying to distract his younger brother - the other children, most of which are around Sam's age, helping out as well. Despite both Baudet and Orella telling him more than once that he should stay inside and relax, he insists on helping around the farm – something to get his own mind off it all.
“Um…” the professor starts, as everyone continues to stare in their direction. “Well, if everyone
“Gods, when will you learn to knock?” Dean says, pulling his undershirt over his head and buckling up his belt. He doesn’t seem in the slightest fazed by being seen half-naked in front of Castiel – only that he stormed in.
And his heart pounds. Because is that what Leuric intended. If one god can have the powers of both, was that the sacrifice? Did Leuric plan to kill Patrus and take both powers becoming one god? But then why make the angels fall? Because the angels can’t come back. No soul can ever be guided to paradise again, if Patrus speaks true.
The Fletcher's manor holds two floors and is almost as wide as the Ardernes. They pass through a large paddock, all different kinds of animals grazing as they make their way to the front door and from what Castiel can see in the dark, the paddock continues on behind the manor as well.
,” she whispers in his ears with her phantom mouth. “
Castiel’s chest tightens. He glances towards the four guards waiting just inside the closed door and towards Dean who sits at the table, idly picking at his sleeves. He feigns disinterest but Castiel can see it there. He must know.
And suddenly, Castiel’s vanished and before he can turn more than an inch, wooden swords are up around his throat, warm breath on his neck. Dean gasps.
Dean’s eyes are soft and Castiel knows his answer before he’s even spoken. “Sam will wait with the healers. But I will fight tomorrow. By your side. And you cannot do anything to stop me.”
But across from him, Castiel shakes his head. “I don’t think they were actually going to hurt you. I think they knew that if they hurt you, the king would retaliate with a greater force than they could’ve handled. They were probably going to keep you captive until he gave up the gold.”
“I didn’t realise you would come so soon or I would have put on something nicer to wear,” she teases, face glowing as Dean laughs. She spots Castiel out of the corner of her eye and her smile turns softer. “Castiel, right? It’s so nice to meet you again.”
-----
"Please. I'm asking you as a friend," he begs, and after trading looks back and forth, Dimarus sighs.
He’s jotting down a few last things on his clipboard when Dean plops down beside him in the stands, his bag half slung over his shoulder.
Castiel steps forward and takes his own seat when he realises Dean’s not going to meet his eyes. But he doesn’t reach for any food. They sit in the quiet on either side of the table, Castiel observing Dean but Dean only focused on the knife he twirls in his hand.
“Dean--” He’s shoved hard against the wall, Dean’s arm on his chest as he flicks his eyes quickly around the room for anything out of place – for any trace of dust scraped, a loose floorboard or panel in the wall before focusing back on Dean.
Dean stands frozen for a moment, embarrassingly flustered before following after him.
There’s only a soft wind tonight and the moonlight is shielded by heavy, grey clouds. So, he has to blink a few times before he sees it. When he does, his heart spikes. A window outside the meeting room that’s been nudged open for air.
Castiel chews at his bottom lip before asking, “Why does your father resent you so much?” Dean startles at the question. He didn’t expect it. And his throat constricts as his eyes fall to the water. But something inside of him releases. “You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to, Dean, I understand,” he adds quietly.
Dean smiles against his lips. “I’ve been wondering. Back at the first ball we went to together…did you want to dance with me?” Castiel pulls back at his words, taking a moment to remember and when he does – because how could he not – he blushes, ears burning.
But it is not meant for a god.
A big woman with red hair pulled back into bun strides over to the table after the servants are done. She has stains on her fingers and chubby cheeks, her apron practically a painter’s palette with the different colours that smear it.
“This isn’t just your fight, Cas,” Dean says, and everything about him is firm and unrelenting. “This is my kingdom. My soldiers that slaughtered your people.”
He is a short and slim, looking ripe even in his older age – his brown hair short and cropped close to his head.
The truth hasn’t been told for ten years, since the war. It died with the angels. Or, it was supposed to. Because of course, not all angels are dead.
Castiel turns to head back into the classroom but before he can he’s whipped back around to face the complete silence and slack jawed students in the hallway.
And the pain in Michael’s eyes is too much and Castiel has to swallow the sobs that threaten to rise. His wings curl around his brother, Michael’s own struggling to hold themselves up.
Castiel shoves him hard in the back until the prince stumbles forward, eyes suddenly back on him.
Dean sighs in relief, a smile lighting up his face once more as he shakes his head and lifts his hand to cradle Castiel’s cheek.
He’s ruined this. He’s ruined everything. He pushes Dean away, tucking himself back into his trousers and grabs his belt and swords from the floor, the panic flooding through him.
“I’ve heard of it.”
“He wanted some time for himself.”
Castiel frowns. “Is there something wrong?”
But despite the horror of it all, he’s never been more grateful the man is beside him.
Castiel bites his lips, glancing down. “It was a spell,” he responds, and for this he is telling the truth.
The angels have begun working on Iowan. They are in the planning phases now but the physical work should start soon. Plenty of people have come far and wide at the prospect of work. And possibly the prospect of being apart of something so huge. Some have said others merely want to come to the sight of where a god was slaughtered.
“He told me about you too. Said you were a good man. And an excellent fighter just like your father.” Catharlo shoots him a small smile but Emery just continues to stare at him, eyes narrowed as though trying to figure out if he really can be trusted.
“Did I impress you, sir?” And when Castiel’s eyes meet Dean’s hopeful, green ones, it’s only then that he understands Dean’s acting like a goof to cheer him up.
He looks out through the slits in the wood to see the prince still talking to the captain. The prince never meets his eyes, although he does look in the crates direction once or twice. Before Castiel can even attempt to listen, the crate lurches forward along the path.
Dean's fingers flick the pages faster, eyes skimming words after words.
. All for some stupid fucking boy.” Michael’s hand only grazes his shoulder before Castiel whirls on him.
He brushes the back of his fingers over Castiel's cheek, thumb grazing a small scar that rests just under his eye.
He rubs his thumb over his knuckles, bruised a dark purple.
“It can’t touch you.”
“No, it’s not!” And there’s a scream in his throat, waiting to be let out-- “You need to stop moving so I can--” Castiel stops, focusing everything he can on healing him, on stitching him back up again.
"But…" Dean swallows, not liking the way it sounds like an excuse, because there should be none, "you never wanted to call."
Castiel turns to him, his eyes brighter than they have been in a while. Dean smiles.
Dean glances up just in time to watch Castiel bite his lip, eyes falling to the curve of his mouth and because his body’s a goddamn traitor, a blush stains his cheeks and yeah, maybe he’s a massive dick but what would it feel like to kiss those lips?
“I said shut up!”
“I bet he won’t show up. Probably gonna do what he did to that poor kid,” Brady says, a smugness about him now.
-----
After a while, they delve into silence, simply gazing up at the cloudless night. Although, Dean finds his eyes drawn to Castiel, observing the soft lines of his face and the relaxed shape of his mouth. It’s enough for Dean to drag Castiel out the night after that and pull him down onto the grass – another beautiful night.
His lower lip trembles and he has to bite down hard on it before Dean can see. But Dean glances up then and he allows it to anyway.
Castiel locks the door behind him, Dean still standing completely flustered awkwardly in the middle of the dark entranceway. Castiel turns, sees Dean and chuckles.
“Your Highness!” one of the guard’s exclaims. “Permission to—”
He sighs, letting his eyes slip shut. Even though it’s been merely over one week, Dean feels as though it’s been much longer. The waiting, the exhaustion of keeping his façade – something he wonders if Castiel struggled with when he was here – and the constant underlying fear that simmers with his every breath.
Dean smiles, grasping Castiel’s hand in his own. “Take me everywhere, then.”
Castiel grips him by the front of his shirt, then, pulling him in for another bruising kiss, before dragging him over to the door, Dean’s hands sadly falling away from him as he searches for they key in his pockets.
The guard’s face pales slightly. “No, that – you don’t need to do that. Just make sure that you are with him at all times.”

Dean takes a step forward. “Cas--”
“I know,” he says. “But Nyree said it should be any day now. As soon as they are done with the barrier and confirming there has been no possession inside, Reyne will escort Sam here to be with us.”
Emery lets out a deep breath. “Let me just put this away.” He points to the rake before quickly dashing back into the stable and out again.
Castiel sighs, closing his eyes as he lets out a shuddering breath. "I told Dean I was an angel." Silence falls over the room. For all her talk, it's clear that Charlie doesn't know what to say. "We... I... We were together," he continues, emphasising the last word and while Sam doesn't appear to piece it together, a flash of understanding passes over Charlie and William's face. He suspected they already knew after that day they came here - after the look Charlie gave him. "As it goes, apparently Dean's father saw us and threatened Dean to turn me in for who I was or he would..." Castiel trails off, eyeing Sam quickly before glancing towards Dean.
Dean glances back up at the man he loves and smiles.
Sebastian balks, hand still hovering in the air as Dean tries unsuccessfully to cover a surprised laugh that escapes him.
Until none of it was a miracle. Until all of it was a curse.
They have a long way to go but here and now is a moment Castiel never thought he’d have.
“So,” he starts, acting totally nonchalant, “What brings you here, Cas? It’s been so long since we’ve seen you.”
Dean grins. "Great. When did you…"
______________________________________
“Emery, yes. How is he?”
“Is any of it true?”
And he knows he’s tricking himself now – convincing himself that there is something there when there isn’t.
“Of course,” he responds, not quite returning a smile back. Mary doesn’t seem to mind.
"I didn't know you caught this bus," Dean replies.
Even Castiel's mother and father caught on, teasing him when he finally gave in and told them he'd been going to lunch with another boy from the neighbourhood.
Castiel raises an eyebrow. “Uh huh, yes, I totally believe that.”
“Well, I don’t know. I like the animals. Don’t you?”
He brushes a hand over the sheathes, clearing off any dirt before securing the belt around his waist. He rests his hands on the sword handles for a moment, closing his eyes.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean says, breaking into a run, his sword swinging back and forth against his side. Somehow along the way, he finds himself smiling. Not a big smile. Just a small one. Because he likes this.
The quiet is oppressive as everyone stares at her in confusion.
Finally,
Castiel flicks through the next few pages but finds them empty and when they resume again, it’s half a moon later, speaking of the victory in Iowan and Mary isn’t even mentioned at all.
Castiel feels sluggish after yesterday. After draining himself of all his emotions. But he still parries Dean’s every blow and move. His mind wanders as he does though, drifting all the way back to when he first was dragged through those castle gates and pushed to his knees in front of Dean.
“Thank you, Dean,” Dimarus says, voice sincere.
He tries to steady his voice as he asks, “Was Michael coming?”
Castiel bites his lower lip as his face crumples, trying his best to hold back the emotion.
Their morning training is cut short when Dimarus sends someone for him. It’s only then when he remembers that he’s supposed to be reporting to Dimarus at the end of each day about Castiel and yet, the last two days he has completely forgotten and his friend must have been too busy to call for him yesterday.
“Excuse me? Can I just whisk him away for a sec?” Dean asks, slipping a hand around Castiel’s waist.
Nyree silences him with a look. “Castiel.”
But this one’s filled with a certain tension too. Because Castiel overheard Dean on Wednesday talking to his friends about how he’s sticking around town for the break and not going anywhere like a few of the others. And of course, Castiel’s not going anywhere either since he’s not a university student – he does have a job to get to.
Every morning and every evening he sits inside his cabin for hours, legs crossed beneath him, eyes focused on a stain on one of the wooden walls, focusing all he can on allowing his entire body to disappear. But he can’t clear his mind and it’s only all the more frustrating when he knows he is capable of it – that he can do it without thought for his wings – and yet for his entire body it is so increasingly difficult.
“And I suppose, if you don’t mind, I feel I should get to know you a little better. You are my eldest son’s lover after all.”
Castiel jerks back all of a sudden, hitting Dean’s hands away with his own. “That’s enough,” he says, voice strained. Dean notices the way his chest is rising and falling quickly and when he goes to stand, he nearly trips over the stool he was sitting on before righting himself.
He stared numbly as Castiel screamed and came to Michael, hopeless and destroyed.
She nods, eyes pained. “I believe that poor wolf we just saw might have been here for a while now.”
“Dean,” he says, eyes soft, holding all of his attention now.
Dean steps into his personal space carefully, eyes down as his hands rest on Castiel’s stomach. He peers up under his eyeslashes, green eyes meeting blue. Castiel breathes, glancing down and beginning to undo his own jerkin but his fingers tremble slightly and he can’t seem to pull the buttons through.
He hears it first. The tell tale sounds of people going about their day. There’s chattering, people calling out in the distance, the sounds of labour. Dean’s heart races, palms sweating. He sees through small gaps in the dense trees a large clearing – spreading perhaps the width that of five royal castles combined, maybe more. But aside from that, it is too difficult to make out many details of the camp over the heads of hundreds and hundreds of people – angels – more of which are seemingly abandoning their work and flocking to crowd together to assumedly watch them approach.
After a long silence, Dean finally shifts, lifting himself from the bed and Castiel’s heart lurches in his chest. He reaches out to grab him – to secure a hand around his wrist. “Stay,” he whispers, not even trying to hide the desperation. Dean’s eyes are almost…relieved. “Just for a little while.”
And the exhausted, completely insane part of Castiel’s brain thinks,
“So, how was Dean?” Jess asks, once they’re standing beside the Impala, waiting for Dean to finish up in the men’s room.
"Yeah, cause they all look fucking weird."
They cheer and high-five all round, Benny even shaking Castiel’s shoulders and enveloping him in a sweaty hug.
“Because I don’t!” Castiel shouts, stepping forward into his space, staring hard at Dean now, hands shaking. “I don’t have a choice. Maybe you have the luxury of looking at it from the outside but I don’t! All I have is my duty and I’ve made my peace with it, and if you--” he cuts himself off, the words drying up in his mouth because he can’t, he can’t— “if you cared for me at all, you should too.”
The unknown reaches for him and he turns beginning to run.
Castiel takes his hand and shakes it. "Castiel."
Dean blinks. “What?” It’s like someone’s doused him with a cold bucket of water and the answer’s out so quick, he’s not even certain if he heard it right or not. Castiel raises his eyebrows.
A long minute later and he hears Castiel diving out beside him. The water slides over his skin and as he finds his feet in the sand, Dean gazes at the way the droplets stick to the smooth column of his neck and the slim beginning of his chest.
Laiba and Usman are more than happy to help cook the three of them a meal whilst Emery and Catharlo take a seat at their table, the young boy Adri seating himself beside them and firing question after question at them, some relevant to their quest, others not. It seems only rumours have spread this far to the bottom of the continent of angels appearing in great numbers but it’s as far as the rumours go.
Castiel’s already at the library by the time Dean gets there. He’s in his usual attire, head down over a book, one earbud in his ear. And strangely, he looks…peaceful. Dean almost doesn’t want to ruin the moment.
He’d run through the stalls on Kyra and Elaria’s heels. They’d never been able to win any of the games but it was always fun to try.
“Okay, well who do you trust the most?”
While her voice is gentle, her eyes are just as pressing as Nyree asks, “Why?”
“Not yet. Hold on, I’ll text Benny real quick.” He pulls out his phone and starts typing when Castiel’s phone buzzes in his pocket. He’s pulling it out when Dean’s mouth falls open. “These fuckers.”
And the terror and shock for a moment slips away for all he can focus on is that,
Castiel closes his eyes, breathing through his nose, in an out before opening them once more.
.” Castiel’s face crumples slightly as he tries to hold back the sobs that sit heavy inside of him. And he’s exhausted now. Can feel it in the way his body aches to let him fall.
He averts his eyes, picking at the label on his beer instead as he imagines sinking into the floor. But of course, no one will let Dean breathe today because suddenly the chair directly across from him is pulled out and he glances up to see Castiel, Eve perching down in the chair beside him.
______________________________________
“Michael had beaten and abused me almost every day in those past two years. I thought for a long time I’d get used to it. And a part of me did. But another part of me, a quieter part of me, never did. I’m not sure if anyone ever really can. But that wasn’t all. As I broke my bones and split my skin all to become a better fighter, the greatest fighter – I grew to understand the weight of my role in all of this. That if I failed, all those that we’d lost and all those that we would lose, would be left in the hands of darkness, their souls carried into the underworld to suffer forever.”
Dean’s breath is hot on his skin and his hips jerk up, back arching slightly as his lips graze Dean’s ear and
He also knows, however, that Emery hasn’t told him everything. He didn’t even tell him at first what they were doing fleeing to Terrowin.
Blood begins to ooze from a gash between Dean's eyebrows, trickling down his nose as he holds a hand to it. Castiel's own head hurts but at least it distracts him from the pain in his chest.
Dean’s walking towards him, eyes still mostly drawn to his mother in shock and Castiel can see there’s still a slight tremor in his hands.
“It was beautiful,” Catharlo says.
They both come to a halt, Castiel standing slightly behind him but still in his line of vision.
“Lady Alia,” Dean starts, voice hard now. “It’s very kind of you to attempt to look out for me and my pleasure but I can assure you that my dear husband and I are in a proper married relationship and it is far more pleasurable than anything you or someone else could give me. So, if you may kindly step aside, that would be most
okay.
And he feels the power inside of him, raw and devouring.
“Why not?” Dean asks, eyes wide and mouth agape. “You’ve been telling me for years how you’ve always dreamed about going to prom!”
“May I join you?” she asks quietly. Dark bags ring her eyes as they usually do these days – although he wonders if perhaps it’s been worse since Sam and Dean left for the castle.
Let alone…
The Fletcher's exchange a look before glancing at Castiel. "Well, the angels had ordered, and rightly so, for an extra man to be inside the castle for when Castiel arrived. And usually, many allies would have stepped forward to take on the responsibility but this order was for someone to be stationed there as swiftly as possible," Baudet answers. "Since going into hiding, many allies of the angels had trained to become royal guards but as you probably know yourself, training takes years and working up through the ranks to become a royal guard years longer. With my connections, I was the only one that was able to get someone into the castle at such short notice. Emery of course, happily agreed."
He’s never been so thankful for tripping over his own feet on a cold, rainy morning.
“Yes. Him. Dean. What was it about him that made you fall so terribly in love?”
Dean clears his throat, glancing out towards the glimmering water. “That’s good.” There’s a few beats of awkward silence and Dean curses himself for not knowing what else to say when he instead settles for, “So…”
“Your lucky though. Because I’m a better man. Even though you deserve it. So, I’ll spare you that.”
Patrus’ eyes narrow, their lips quirking. “If it’s how you’d like to buy yourself time, then I will grant it.” Castiel pushes himself to his feet, slight relief washing over him. “Because it doesn’t matter if it’s now or later, you will come as easily to me as ever. And because,” Patrus smiles, “I love a good story.”
In his father’s eyes, he’d failed at that too. And now he can’t do anything. Can’t even find the prisoners who hurt Castiel and punish them for what they did.
Castiel blinks, taken aback. He’d tried not to think about since he heard he would have to face the demon on the battlefield. And it’s only because--
“And what of the guards already inside?” Dean pauses on the polished wooden floor and twists around to face Castiel, the tiniest hint of a smile at the corner of his mouth.
The only thing is that he’s not sure if Castiel actually
Dean exhales deeply. “We’re still figuring things out,” he mutters softly. He can feel Sam’s gaze sympathetic on the side of his face. “But for the most part things are fine. Okay?”
And there, staring right back at him is a map. A map to a place in Terrowin across Karlon’s Pass. And beside it, words scribbled in Enochian.
But standing before the castle, spread across the grassy plain is an army. The demon’s own. But he recognises those at the front immediately.
Hearts free, beating in time with each other, they trudge on to the battlefield.
“Oh, ever the romantic, Prince Dean.” Dean rolls his eyes. Leda smiles, her eyes falling on Castiel. “It
"And why are you here, Winchester?"
Castiel hisses as he sits back down. It’s even more uncomfortable sitting now, with extra bruises littering his front. His body and mind are weary and he knows he needs to rest to recover his strength not only to heal but because he’s not sure what lies ahead. He needs to be prepared.
Dean shakes his head before heading to Sam’s rooms.
While fancy-casual is confusing, it’s not the real reason he’s stressed. Because he’s never cared this much about his appearance since he was a teenager.
And his heart swells in his chest, a blush striking up to the tips of his ears and gods--
And even though his birthday is on Saturday, it just makes so much sense to go out and celebrate on Friday night. Beginning at six o’clock.
“Then, why didn’t you?” Dean says, voiced raised.
He eventually pulls away, placing the soap back in the basket. “I’ll step out for a moment. Let you have some privacy. And then I’ll help you with your wounds. Is that okay?”
“What was that?” Castiel mumbles out, his brain going into overload. Did Dean really just sound relieved about being allowed to take Castiel to prom?
Dean grits his teeth in front of him before turning on Michael.
And the words come so quickly, so naturally that he can’t stop himself.
Castiel swallows, gazing at the side of his brother’s face. “Among other things.”
Dean's eyes are uncertain when they find Castiel's. "Go. You should clean yourself up and get some rest," Castiel says.
"At first, we thought it was because of your father's hatred of the angels and because of..." Castiel pauses, not knowing how much to say. "Your mother's disappearance - something you know he blamed the angels for. But after we had time to think," he continues quickly, not wanting Sam or Dean to ask questions of their mother just yet. "We believed that perhaps the demon found out that we held the wings and halo and orchestrated the attack to find them. You see, ever since the leaders of the angels gained the first power it was kept in the crypts below Iowan, warded from the very demon that was searching."
“You foolish boy,” Patrus spits and Castiel watches the muscles of their back move with their every harsh breath. Dean turns towards them, eyes narrowed. “You have taken what is mine.”
“How… It didn’t even touch the floor. It’s almost as if it sensed it. How could that…” Catharlo starts.
He caught them only a few days walk from camp. They weren’t hard to miss. There were thousands of them, soldiers and healers, walking side by side through the forest, finding the best pathways to pull through their supply wagons.
His fingers quiver where they are clenched into fists on his knees. The boots in front of him do not shift from their position. Dean swallows, snatching up any courage he has and looks up to meet his father’s eyes.
And it takes Dean a moment before his hands, hesitant and gentle come to rest at the dip of his back pulling him ever closer before he kisses him back.
He hears his name being called behind him – Bela – and walks faster, not wanting to deal with anyone else tonight.
Mary’s eyes flick towards him, narrowed before they widen. There’s a glimmer in her eyes, a flash of something.
Castiel huffs, trying to think of something to say that isn’t just him being an absolute blushing mess. “Dean, I --”
Castiel holds his gaze, makes sure this is what he truly wants and not something he feels he’s being forced into.
Castiel spots the mayor of Lithos speaking excitedly to a pair of angels and notices with a smile, Elaria and Adri with his grandparents, having finally visited from Terrowin to see how they are doing.
He can see it all falling into place. All the doubt and all the questions. Could his father have killed her, buried her and blamed it all on the angels for her betraying him for them?
“I don’t dance,” Castiel responds, eyes narrowed.
But he came with Emery before the battle. He must have some heart in him if he didn’t turn away when Emery revealed all. Although, from the looks he’s noticed between them, the stilted tension, he understands Catharlo might have come for other reasons.
Ironically, the higher rates of pillaging and general violence were what Castiel and his company of servants and guards had been sent to Raaken to speak about with Lord Villiers. Not only does he already feel the humiliation deeper since it was he that was captured but this too?
And when he does get there, Emery will be his main lookout, along with at least one other guard they hope to transfer into the castle in time. And if Dean somehow, is able to locate the halo and the whereabouts of the grace through his careful searching, he will signal to Emery and be pulled out immediately.
Castiel signed up because of him. To be with him. Because Castiel likes him. Has liked him before he even came on this camp.
Dean flicks his eyes towards Castiel's concerned ones and when he glances back up the figure is gone. Shit. If that was a guard, they need to move. But that same dread fills his chest at the thought that it might be something else.
The sky is dark but he can imagine them so easily now, up there, waiting. He knows in the very depths of his soul how proud they would be that he finally found his way to exactly where he needed to be.
The night, however, sadly comes to an end and soon they find themselves leaving the restaurant side by side as they stroll towards the parking lot – approaching increasingly slower with each step as if they want to drag this out as long as possible. And Castiel does. He doesn’t want this to end but suddenly he’s standing by Dean’s car and Dean himself, hands shoved in the pockets of his jeans is saying, “Well…I had a really,
Dean closes his eyes, fists clench into his sides. “You think I don’t know that?” Castiel stares at the floor. Dean swallows, pulling him inside his chambers and shutting the door behind him. Castiel doesn’t resist but the distance between them is greater now and it hurts. “Cas, just listen to me, okay, we can--”
Dean huffs a small laugh, careful to keep quiet. “I thought for someone so graceful, you would be a fine dancer. Have you ever danced with someone before?” Dean asks, raising a curious eyebrow.
“What announcement?” he asks, words a little more forceful.
And then it all hits him and a few stray tears finally spill over the edge as he trembles quietly. Dean leans up on his elbows, fingers brushing away the tears as he shushes him.
Castiel shakes his head, one hand raising to curl around Dean's wrist. "No, it's not your fault. You didn't know."
“Geez, look at you, Cas. I swear I could never see what was under all those layers that you wear but now...” Dean whistles and grins even more when Castiel ducks his head, trying to hide the burn of his cheeks.
"Dude, he's been looking at you all night. How can anyone resist those big, blue eyes?" Dean says teasingly, and Castiel laughs awkwardly to cover up the way his whole body warms.
He even remembers thinking he would kill the person who had, when Castiel had turned his arm away, a memory too raw to share that morning.
But soon enough, dinner is over and they are leaving for their chambers.
“I will, Gran.“ he replies, his smile falling at the thought of the last time Dean had called him. It was Castiel’s birthday. And Castiel didn’t pick up the phone. He just sat beside it and listened to Dean’s voice cracking and tried not to let his tears spill over. Suddenly there is a hand under his chin and he’s being lightly pulled around to see his Gran with a soft look on her face.
Opening the door, he immediately notices that Dean isn’t at his desk as he usually is. And a glance at his bed shows that he isn’t there either, although his bed isn’t made as normal, the sheets thrown back hastily.
They kiss, slow and languid until Dean’s leg moves and lines up in between his own. Heat pools in the bottom of his stomach, a rough exhale leaving his lips. Dean pulls back slightly, eyes glazed over with desire but the apprehension remains. Castiel nods and Dean steps back, taking his hand and dragging him into his chambers, Castiel closing the door behind him.
“I have to face them. To take a stand for what’s right.” And Castiel sees something in Dean’s eyes – a passion that he doesn’t think he’s seen before. “And that is by your side. Fighting for you and all your kin.”
"So, I'm gathering you liked the first one." Castiel peeks up through his glasses as he scans the book through.
Castiel stops in his thoughts as he sees the expression on Dean’s face. It’s barely there but he can see it clearly now. Dean is testing him. Of course he is. Castiel grinds his teeth.
Castiel purses his lips. "That's the hope."
“No, I…” Catharlo stops for a moment, wondering if he should tell. But then he remembers how close Dimarus and Emery are and gives in. Or maybe it’s those big, brown eyes pleading that makes him give in. “The crown prince wants me to check in on his personal guard, Castiel.” Emery’s eyes soften. The news spread quickly around the castle about what happened in Narla. About how the prince was kidnapped by men from Lithos but Castiel had saved him.
“Well, you’re not really the romantic type.” Because he’s not. He’s heard the stories. Castiel’s the furthest thing from it, what with all the one-night stands and blowing people off. But he doesn’t dare say that with the icy look Castiel’s now giving him.
“Did you know,” they say, taking a step forwards towards where Castiel was standing mere moments ago, “that with the Three now, your senses are heightened? You might not have noticed. You have only been
The slightest wave of relief washes over him. He’s not leaving for good. Unless…unless as soon as he leaves this castle, he’ll run far away from Dean and his stupid fucking desires that he can’t control.
They watch the sun set over the farm in their shared silence and it may not hold the soft purple and orange hues unique to his home, but in this moment, it's all he needs.
He looks out at the street for a moment, listening to the distant chatter of his family out the back before he finally speaks.
The forest is suddenly very quiet. A few moments pass and then another, longer inconsistent tune sounds back. Goosebumps ripple up Dean's arms.
Dean looks up to find the two holding hands on the table. When he looks to Castiel, his face is blank, eyes dead as they stare at the wooden table. And he can tell that stories like these, they aren’t rare.
But someone did. And he knows if there’s any hope left in the world and Dean is brought back into his arms, he will not let him go again.
“What do you mean ‘why’?” Castiel looks at him as though it’s the most obvious thing in the world. “I haven’t seen my best friend in three years. I miss you.”
She looks upon Castiel, smile sad. “What I would have given for that gift,” she says, quietly. Dean’s brows crease. She glances up, then. “We wouldn’t have had to run so far, Kyra and I. We could have found where our people were. Where he was. Our only family left.”
Reyne narrows his eyes, something itching under his skin.
After another few moments, he begins again, Dean keeping his hands moving, itching to know it all.
It still doesn’t make sense. Or perhaps he’s thinking too much because perhaps he doesn’t believe that Castiel would possibly stay for him.
He has to.
Castiel is staring upwards, brow furrowed when Dean turns to gaze at him.
