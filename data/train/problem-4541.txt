“Cas,” relief in his voice, Dean moved the blade away, tucking it into his belt before keeping Cas upright. “Yeah, I’m sorry about that,”
“Fuck,” Dean moaned out, leaning forward to kiss a trail along Cas’ neck as he started his slow pace.
“Enough!” Dean commanded, silencing both of them. His head spun. This was familiar. This whole scenario. It’s happened before.
He had turned the corner in time to see Sam falling to the floor, a man before him with a crowbar in his hand.
His own dick straining as he watched Dean undo the tie, forcibly tugging it off to toss to the side as he began his work the buttons of his shirt.
“Black Coffee,” a feminine voice announced, a familiar cardboard cup was placed before him. He looked at the pale hand, delicate and sharp nails, up the arm to a familiar redhead.
Shuddering at the thought, he crept in, past the room with all the robes and churchly items. He found another door, which upon opening it, lead into the room with the altar and pews.
Castiel was careful to keep his expression neutral. The revelation was a little surprising but they’ve touched on this topic a handful of times. Dean had dismissed the notion of him bottoming in general.
Smiling and waving half-heartedly to the crowd, Dean turned his attention back to the man as Michael picked up the rope to begin pulling his betrothed to him.
His eyes traveled to the corner of the frame where two Bee’s holding hands with the quote “We’re meant to Bee,” underneath them.
But none are more regular than Mr. Dean Winchester. Coming into the establishment at least five days out of the week.
As much as Castiel would have loved to have taken this slow and easy like usual, the reason he came here...time was not on his side. He started his bruising pace, surprising the man based on his gasp as he continued. Enjoying the mixture of gasps and moans he earned from hitting at just the right angle. One hand on Dean’s hip and the other on his shoulder, he dug deep for the energy to thrust while closing his eyes to focus on that tight hole.
Even though Castel thought Christmas wasn’t as joyous of an occasion, he wasn’t one to dismiss giving presents to the ones he cared about. They only had Dean’s parents and Gabriel to buy for, he also took the opportunity to check the order status of other packages they were expecting, smiling when they all said delivered.
He slumped in his chair at his desk, a hand over his eyes as he breathed out. He had one more client. It shouldn’t be too bad but he knew he knew he was gonna need a beer or two the day.
He knew Cas was good. Probably the best. But to be booked up to 2 months in advance, that's just downright insane. Who has dates that far in advance for Ass Stretching?!
“Nah, you go ahead. I’ll see you Thursday.” Inias gave him a reassuring smile, turning to head towards his car that was parked on the side of the building.
“Simple misdirection spell, he’s aware of magic and creatures. But something as dark as an Alpha Vampire living trapped within his kingdom would not have gone over well.” Hands shaking, Dean let go of the man’s shirt to stand. The outrage sparked within him again, but before he could plan his next move Bobby continued talking. “Your Mother wanted to protect this kingdom. Just like her ancestors.”
"This isn't Starbucks but I'll see what I can do," with the amount of sarcasm in Sam's voice, Dean had to cover his mouth with his free hand in order not to laugh. Once his brother turned around to fetch the order, Rachel, that’s her name Dean remembered, turned and moved closer into his space.
He looked behind but there was nothing. A deep chuckle echoed off the tiled walls, floor, and around the bathing room.
“You do belong to me,” His voice sending a chill through him despite the pain. His stubbled chin brushing along Dean’s, humming low in approval. He didn’t know what to do, his breath was coming out in short pants, his left hand coming up to hold onto Castiel’s wrist.
The line was out the door and he managed to squeeze into the place and snag a seat at one of the furthest booths. He nodded to the employees, those he’s come to recognize during his time. They didn’t talk much with them aside from general greetings, order taking, and thank you’s. He’d occasionally send a wink to one of the pretty girls that would be working, some were brave enough to smile and wink back.
“I told you, from that day on I would protect you in return. I would take care of you and your family. Have I not done just that? I helped pay for your brother’s University tuition. I helped your parents get out of debt. I made sure that you were well taken care of.” He felt lips pressing just below his ear and again along his jawline, eyes closing. “I’ve taken very good care of you.” He felt lips press to his.
.” he choked at the last part, closing his eyes, a hand coming up to grip Dean’s. “And I was craving sex. It sensed you were still near but I wouldn’t let it.
Yes, Castiel may have been a few years older, but this rich, spoiled, billionaire is all Castiel could think about while he was learning to take his father’s place. But when the time came, he buried those feelings down deep.
Dean looked around, his heart beating so hard that he feared it might burst from his chest. He looked back at his family, their faces stunned.
A silence fell over them like a thick fog. Castiel taking note of the index shifting between yellow and green, down to red and back to green.
The people of his village stood at the edge of the water, cheering while throwing petals and rice into the air in celebration. He smiled while looking around, dressed in his family’s traditional attire for the ceremony.
His eyes narrowed, Meg may be the commander of his ever-growing army and he did admire her bluntness, but he will not let his efforts go to waste.
He felt his forearm move to his right, followed by a hissing noise coming from somewhere sending a cold chill throughout his body right as the arm dropped again.
"I know about the boat." Castiel interrupted. Not wanting to hear what Dean had to say. "I know why you didn't want to stay in the pit: you wanted to escape."
Humming at the feel of Dean’s hard cock against the cleft of his ass. His hands roaming his body, finding themselves on Castiel's hips, gripping the materiel to pull them down, underwear included.
Magic? Seriously? Yes, he’s seen some crazy-ass things the last couple of days, but he chalked it up to lack of sleep. A true excuse.
“Yes, about an hour ago. I’m all clean, took a shower and everything,” Nodding his head, Castiel walked over to the bed to place his black bag on it.
He let out a small squeak when he was suddenly lifted off the chair, his leg institutionally wrapping around the man’s frame.
“Shield of God,” He walked slowly over to the hole, to the rock that ‘cut’ off their ties to one another.
"Fuck…" he panted out, running a hand through his hair and sitting up straighter. That's when something caught his attention from the corner of his eye.
He doesn’t think he’s ever gotten home so fast as he jumped off his bike, not caring that he left in the middle of his yard. He unlocked the door without his keys and entered his home.
"Dean! Are you kidding me," Sam exclaimed, sitting up straighter to give his brother an incredulous look. Dean glanced over his shoulder and shrugged.
Looking around, the sun was setting, casting the place in what Dean dubbed ‘Zombie Apocolypse’ setting. He drove his car along the main road, searching for any signs of life.
“Well, what did you have in mind for today?” At that, Dean pulled out a bunch of cassettes tapes with a colorful cover of bells and cheer.
“How are we today,” Castiel glanced up from his notebook to see Dean on the couch, lounging out in a slouched seated position, left hand draped across his leg with the left arm lying along the backrest. He moved his gaze back down at the notes from the last session. Jotting down on today’s fresh piece of paper where Dean’s scale lay.
“If you wait a moment, I was going to give you a ride,” Looking back, Dean was smiling as he pulled on his jacket, keys in hand. “My cars this way,” indicating to the sleek looking car next to Castiel.
The car slowed to a stop, Dean informed his men that he got this after opening the door for himself. The two looked at each other and shrugged. As Dean approached the coffee shop he looked in to see the place filled with college students and other people looking to get their fix for a Wednesday morning.
“You’ve had this planned out already,” watching Dean pause in his unpacking of the box, a string of lights in his hand.
Having gotten to know him well enough to allow himself to be called "Cas", he decided to walk over and ask if everything was alright.
It was enough of a distraction that he didn’t feel the finger slip in. A kiss to his shoulder surprised him when another finger slipped in.
Until the day a woman was sacrificed and her lover decided to track the creature down to kill it and find her.
He watched Dean’s arms move, hands finding Castiel’s chest as he smoothed over one nipple to the next, rubbing over his cock. Sighing into the man’s touch, feeling the goosebumps as he let the man’s cock caress the side of his face.
The man watched everything unfold way into the night, watching as each person left till there was no one left.
Overall, Dean didn’t want to do anything except lay in bed all day. He could do some training inside with some of the men in the royal court but that would require pants.
“You’re a damn mind reader,” Dean’s voice interrupted the silence between them, the words were whispered under his breath but Castiel managed to hear it.
“Save the games for when you go on break or after work,” Michael commented, propping the door open for Castiel to get through.
“Working a minimum wage job while going through college, I figured a generous tip would help.” Castiel went to speak, coming up short with a remark at the mention of him being in school. “I came in a while back, saw you studying.” Dean pointed out before taking a sip of his drink.
“We’ll talk later,” he muttered to the women before following Alastair out. Down countless halls, making lefts and rights, they finally came to a door.
Dean turned them, keeping himself still sheathed in Castiel’s warm heat, before pushing against the nearest piece of furniture.
This was Originally a Prompt that I made, and I couldn't think fo anything for a chapter story, so if anyone wants to continue it, just make sure to tag me.
Wracking his brain, would it be too obvious to do it in the bedroom again? Or would the couch throw off the scent? Even though the bedroom had been really comfortable. But the couch would give the perfect angle if this went any further.
“If he isn't coming…You know what that means.” Castiel turned his full attention to Dean, his face looking off into the distance with a look Castiel couldn't figure out.
“Bedroom,” Dean asked or stated, either way, Castiel was lost in the sensation of the man’s lips as they traveled from his lips to his neck to answer.
“I only work for you, Castiel James Novak, and only you. No one else. I pledged and gave myself over wholly to serve you and you alone.”
his only thought when they came to him in the first place. The meter above was a clear indication that neither one was satisfied with the relationship.
She stared at him expectantly as he got his breathing under control. He hasn’t run this much since Sam demanded he participate in that charity. He couldn’t feel his legs after that.
Before either could say anything, Dean was on his knees between Cas’ legs, sucking the tip between his lips. Hissing at the sensation, Castiel restrained from bucking into the man’s mouth. Instead, opting to hold the back on the man’s neck to guide him up and down.
Contemplating whether he wanted to go back to the throne room, he paused mid-step at the familiar feeling.
He pulled out the cards from his pocket and his phone to google map where he was supposed to be exactly.
“Give it a day or two,” she started, ignoring the groan from the Alpha. “His body is fine. All those years training in the kingdom. But the mind is fragile. Being bound and sealed within off since the curse, with no accidental slips. Forcing him to come out too soon could leave significant damage to his psyche,”
"Maim him, if you end up killing him, you'll suffer a worse death then what hell could do for you," blondie called out to the black-haired man.
Cas stared transfixed at the man above, his heart thumping in his chest at the fact that Dean still wanted him,
"Well. Now then." The cold barrel pushed further into his throat, choking at the lack of oxygen. "You see, Dean, finding out that you had been seeing little Castiel here...I was angry at first. But then, I saw it as a chance. To finally put this boy to use as a perfect bargaining chip… you know, instead of just sucking dick on his days off."
Dean looked in confusion, trying to interrupt what he was saying before the light bulb went off. Feeling his face heat up, he reached for the man’s hand, pulling so Castiel would lean forward till their foreheads were touching.
Dean’s eyes widened at the information, wiping his hand along his pant leg. He was trying to figure out what to say, Castiel thought to himself.
The coffee shop was buzzing, it would make sense since it is now the week before final exams. Everyone was cramming into quiet places to study, hoping time would fly so that everyone could go on vacation before the summer semester began.
Nodding, Castiel started unloading his books, his hand brushing his phone as it buzzed. A flash of irritation went through his mind as he grabbed the thing, looking a the screen to see multiple notifications saying:
“My Liege, it’s in regards to the prisoner,” the man spoked out before Castiel could continue his prior discussion. He watched the Alpha lean forward in his seat, his interest perked. “He says he’s ready to talk,”
Shifting onto his front, he didn't get very far when his left arm was stopped by something cold around the wrist, the sound of something scraping along the floor after he did so. Testing the restraint, he came to the conclusion that he was handcuffed. He sat up, awkwardly slouched over from not being able to sit up properly.
He heard screams around him, peeking behind him, he gaped in horror as he watched the men on the ground being contorted into weird positions, their gasps and screams sending a cold chill through his body.
Just before he walked out of the room, he glanced in the mirror and had to do a double-take. He grabbed the closest jacket before opening the door and leaving.
He shook his head, not quite over the fact. Last week when he met up with Gabriel it was green, all the way to the right. He shouldn’t have confided in the man because he does it on purpose now.
One of the tavern wenches with her brown hair tied up, revealing her pointed ears. A fairy, based on the magic flowing from her. He wasn’t overly fond of them. The elves were easy to coherence to his side but the fairies were stubborn. Of course, vampires and fairies never did get along.
Castiel thought as he opened his bag that was next to Dean to pull out the lube and black latex gloves.
"If I could land a hit, this man is freaking squirrely as hell. Mage, do something," the blade thrower called out, glancing at the fourth person stilled perched by the fire.
The wind started picking up around him, he brought his arms up to shield his face from the dirt and any scattered debris flying around him.
The pale hand slipped through the hole to grasp Dean’s hand in a soft grip. His hands were softer than Dean expected. He relished the contact, the man’s hands were warm.
“Beige,” He watched Dean turn to look for the vehicle in question. But little did he know, Castiel had actually walked here. The keys in his pocket were just his house keys. He also wasn’t expecting the hot bartender to assist him. He figured he’d be stumbling home, hoping he would get to the right apartment and crash for the night.
“How are you feeling, sweetheart,” his mother, Queen Mary asked, placing a hand on top of his with a small smile after he took his seat across from her.
The man’s breathing became ragged, whimpering from the assault, as he got up on his hands so that he was on all fours, again, so that he could start pushing back into the toy and forward into Castiel’s hand.
He had to resist the urge to run, but walking fast was close enough as he made his way towards his bedroom.
"What the fuck?!" Dean grunted, irritated that he had to stop for that. "I was almost there!" He complained.
Dean had to hold in the chuckle at the disarray that was Sam’s hair. His normal straight brown locks that were always pulled back into a low ponytail. Now it was a mess, sticking up in random places.
He truly loved the girl, but after a one night stand, they realized they were just better off as friends. With a mutual booty call every now and then of course.
“Y-yes,” Castiel whimpered out just as Dean decided to pull out, pausing when just the tip was left. “P-please,” He begged, turning his head to meet Dean’s gaze.
Turned out to be Cas, because Dean was not gonna move. He felt Cas slowly pull out, whimpering in a manly way, when he felt that dick slide out completely, followed by a satisfied groan from the man above him.
“Well let’s get started. When are you meeting this guy?” Castiel asked as he watched Dean crawl onto the bed. He moved back on his hands and knees so his knees were inches away from the edge, before dropping to his forearms to present his ass towards Castiel.
With his left hand on the man's head, to keep him occupied while his right searched for that puckering hole.
His bed was so soft and warm that spending the day wrapped in his comforter wasn’t a bad idea. He rolled over to his right side, adjusting his position so he could lull himself back to dreamland.
“Here's my decision: we turn back,” his voice hard, spitting the words out like venom. Through the light of the lanterns, he could see the bags under his eyes from lack of sleep.
Looking around the screen, he noticed a space to the right wasn’t outlined in brown. Castiel has played plenty of old school games to know that it’s an entranceway.
The image of Senator Roan flashed through Dean's mind. The hanging. The body. "Purge" carved into her.
There were stands placed in a semi-circle, one selling hot chocolate, another was selling cookies, and so on.
"He isn't property, Eldon." Words clipped. "Second, if you are unwilling to change venues for this negotiation then can I have my men evacuate the cafe?"
“Don’t delete the game,” the first words he was able to get out, turning his attention to look around the semi-empty restaurant.
Growling in frustration, Castiel licked up the remnants of blood off the body kneeling in front of him before tossing it to the side. Lifeless.
The way Castiel stroked him in tandem with the thrusts of the toy to leaving his hand still, making Dean thrust forward and back for the friction while impaling himself with the toy.
There is also MINOR MINISCULE Character Death. I assure you, you will agree with this person's death.
Meg was ‘sweeping’ with her back turned as the suited man walked to the counter, those green eyes pinning Castiel in place as he placed both hands on the counter.
Cas glanced down at his watch as he rode the elevator up to the top floor always dressed casually in his jeans and a loose t-shirt with his mandatory black bag in one hand.
She smiled, her painted lips and dramatic makeup giving her a wicked look as she brought her hand up to her chin to think about it.
“I-I don’t know, I sneezed and before I knew it, I bumped into the shelf,” he tried, putting on an apologetic face. His mother quickly crossed the room to comfort him.
He watched the man look from the door to him, contemplating. Castiel kept the man’s hand on his cheek with his own, turning to kiss the palm to gain Dean’s attention.
He watched his brother as he finally regained his composure, slowly rising to his feet. One hand on his neck as he massaged the abuse while his other began emitting a soft orange color. Eyes narrowing when his eyes landed on Dean.
Met but a lot backlash, with the head of his special operatives, known as the Hunter’s, lead by his husband, Dean, they were able to overcome the Demons enough to put an end to the purge indefinitely.
“There’s nothing to be embarrassed about,” Castiel consoled after picking up his notebook to write down this new breakthrough. That and to hide the slight discomfort in his lap.
“But we have to leave now, Dean. There won’t be a fair trial for either of us. I know you hate it here and I thou-” his words stopped, he was so focused on his ramblings that a pair of lips crashing into his silenced anything else he was going to say.
It was quiet, the air around them slightly tense as Meg fixed her gaze on him. Her neatly trimmed eyebrow raised in curiosity at the comment. Taking in Castiel’s haggard appearance, his coat that was usually crisp and clean was now crinkled. His suit that he always seemed to wear, the shirt was untucked and his tie was somehow now backward.
Thrusting again right before speeding himself up to a bruising pace. Dean felt the man gripped his hips tightly, pushing Dean into the cushions with every thrust.
“I love the dragon!” the declaration echoing throughout the now silent village, everyone staring in astonishment. It didn’t take long for the whispering to start, Michaels men began to murmur behind him at the scandalous admission.
He shoved the man onto the altar, keeping his grip, using his body to hold the man in place, the angel blade poised above him.
“Dean, I have a question,” Castiel murmured after inhaling, smoke escaping from his lips after he pulled the cigarette away.
Dean kept his eyes sweeping left and right, searching for anyone that could pop out or a possible trap.
He could smell the stale blood ways back, but being near the door, it was pungent. Alastair opened the door, Castiel walking down the flight of stairs first.
"Eventually...we were able to slowly take over the bodies of key leaders, creating the 'Founding Fathers,'" Lucifer smirked, which turned into a couple of chuckles of laughter.
The room was dark when he entered. He had made sure to shut the door as quietly as possible, but the rustling of sheets behind him signaled that he wasn’t as quiet as he’d hoped.
“Quiet, all of you!” Gabriel demanded, silencing the soldiers at once while making his way to stand beside the man.
"D-Dean! What is this!" Castiel's eyes wide, frantically looking down at the now ring of fire and the man before him.
"You had a plan…' I'll teach you to live like a human.' To get a hold of materials and maps, to learn to send signals to the ships. There was only one thing left…' Will you teach me to see the wind? To overcome the curse of the island preventing you from sailing away."
Turning his eyes suspiciously around the place, his hand reaching for a cloth to settle over his privates. He was met with a tsking sound.
A screeching noise woke Dean from that memory, feeling a tear slip from his eyes as he tried to move.
"He'll be fine, he's tougher than he looks," Dean gave his brother a pat on the opposite arm that was holding ice up.
Dean shook his head, not able to comprehend the thought of being possessed. Much less Lucifer or a Demon.
All the memories of him and Sam...Dean tried to recall moments where Sam could have used Magic, but all he could remember were blurred instances. He didn’t dwell on the thoughts when the sound of coughing brought him back. Fresh blood had begun leaking from Bobby’s lips as he gave a half-hearted smile.
“You adjusted quickly. Besides, we’re already ten minutes in,” Castiel replied, uncapping the lube again, squirting a generous amount onto the metal plug. “And you always have trouble with this part,” he rubbed his gloved hand over it, trying to warm it the best he could.
She didn’t say anything as he sucked his next meal down, tossing the body. Raising a brow at him when he slumped back in his seat, one hand covering his eyes, the other wiping his face.
“He hasn’t done a thing to me. If anything, he’s helped me see clearer than what you’ve kept from me my entire life. Thanks to breaking that vase, I’ve never felt better.” Dean could feel the anger now boiling within him, rolling off him in waves.
“Black coffee?” a voice asked, bringing Dean from his thoughts and turned toward the source. The familiar barista boy with shaggy black hair and crazy blue eyes leaned out from the door with the steaming cup of joe in his hand.
Castiel nodded, they had brushed on a lot today and if Dean wanted to leave, he wasn’t going to charge him for the remainder of the time.
He turned back around to face the open street and walkway, contemplating what to do. That's when Sam’s words echoed in the back of his head about who this guy was. Internally rolling his eyes at the bitch face he imagined his brother giving him if Dean returned stating the doors were locked and nobody was home. He walked down the steps to head around the building.
Castiel groaned deep in his throat, praising Dean at being such a fast learner. The hum in response and the way Dean moved his tongue as he sucked nearly finished Cas. Luckily he pulled away in time, ignoring the look of disappointment.
“What’s going on,” he questioned, feeling something glide along his cheek, down his neck. He felt a strike of fear when whatever was touching him, ghosted over his bare chest.
He got the best education until he was pulled out at fifteen, homeschooled, and graduating the following year.
The first thing he saw was Castiel standing in the middle of the room, hand wrapped around his brother’s throat, and holding the man in the air. If Dean wasn’t so freaked about the whole scene, he’d have been engrossed in Castiel’s sheer strength to lift someone taller than him. Shaking his head, he stepped further into the room. Off to the right, he discovered his parents. John was sitting on the floor, leaning against one of the pillars with Mary’s head in his lap. She looked like she’d been knocked out. Judging by both of their appearances, they looked like they had put up a fight based on the broken pillars and damaged floors surrounding the place. Bloodied and covered in dirt.
“Ah-” Castiel gasped out, feeling the slight pinch to his nipple before smoothing over his chest. Feeling lips to his neck as the hands traveled farther south, his heart beating rapidly at the attention. When his hands found Castiel’s fully erect need, he nearly came at the firm grip.
This was originally going to be a story based on a picture on Tumblr, which I will post the link at the bottom. But Instead of letting it sit in my folder, never to be published as a stand-alone. I'm just gonna post what I have written and hope someone might be inspired to finish :D
Castiel felt his heart flutter at the gift once the paper was removed. It was a simple wooden frame with a picture of him and Dean on the 4th of July. Dean hugging Castiel right as the camera went off. Castiel was giving Dean a weird look while Dean had a big smile on his face.|
“Dean,” green eyes shifted towards the source, his head a little woozy from the hits, to find Bobby right next to him.
“What about Sam,” Dean managed out between clenched teeth, eyes looking firmly at the man as he took in the information.
His eyes looking down, realizing the creature wasn’t there but a noise to his left alerted him that he was not alone. It sounded like a cross between a human crying and a creature in pain.
“I’m not going in there without any answers first,” Dean all but growled out, not caring if he’s acting like a child, but this was ridiculous! He had no clue what was going on.
a voice whispered in the back of his mind, Dean snapping out of it by shaking his head. Where did that come from?
“And it’s none of your business,” he added, leaning forward, his eyes glowing as he disregarded her.
“Did he fuck you like this,” Castiel managed out, thrusting sharply to elicit a long moan from the man.
He grunted in pain when a pulse radiated through him, grunting as the hot flare started to spread from his neck to the rest of his body.
The deep, throaty groan sent goosebumps throughout Dean’s body, that and the pulsing sensation in his ass as the man came.
“Doc, I’ll be honest,” Dean’s voice was nervous as if hesitating to say anything. Castiel just wanted to move his hand away and forget any of this. He could lose his job. “I didn’t think sex therapy would work,”
“It’s okay. I’ll bike...” Castiel responded, trying to keep the disappointment from his voice. He hung up after quietly saying ‘see you later'. He looked around the vast bedroom, sighing under his breath as he began to shift out of the king-size bed. Hissing from the pain as he stood, he tried to make quick work of showering and getting dressed while limping around.
The feel of icy hands and a solid form pressed against his back must've been due to the pain, a feverish illusion if anything.
And Castiel did. Slowly pulling the plug out and pushing it back in. Dean’s head lifted, followed by the rest of his torso so that he was on all fours.
table during your breaks,” he rambled on and on, each thing he said made Castiel’s heart drop further and further into his stomach.
He felt hands on his ass, gripping, squeezing and spreading him just as he felt something wet tracing around the rim of his hole. Pushing just past the muscle, repeating the motion over and over, Castiel feeling the hum from the man as he lapped around his hole a couple of times.
He smiled when a hand popped out from the heap. Castiel walked across the room to the outstretched limb. Lacing his fingers with the hand, he knelt so that he could kiss the back of the hand.
“I came here because I-” the words stuck in his throat. Green eyes looked at him curiously as he attempted to figure out what he was saying. He took a long inhale from his cigarette before dropping it on the concrete, putting out with his shoe. “I-I love you,” he said it. It’s out in the open. “I came here because I wanted to take you out of this place. Go to New York where people like you and I are flourishing,” Dean’s eyes widened. Screams could be heard in the other room now as the officers busted up the party.
It was pitch black, to say the least. He could vaguely make out shapes here and there, enough to tell that he was in a bedroom.
Reaching down for the lube, he uncapped it and squirt a generous amount into his hand. Tossing the bottle back into his bag, he took the mans’ length in his left hand, swiping his thumb over the slit to smear the precum there and moved his hand around the length to smear the lube.
“That was too easy,” one of the men laughed out from his sprawled position against the tree. Dean would bet anything that he was drinking by the pouch in his hand.
It's not entirely his job to be placed at one particular table, but Dean seemed to enjoy the fact that he's got the Maître D attending him at the most luxurious restaurant here in Lawrence. Even more impressive to the dates or business meetings.
Dean's heart was racing, his body trembling at the story. Everyone from the village figured they were killed or eaten, this...this was much worse. He turned, eyes downcast as Castiel continued.
“That means goodbye for the night,” Dean answered, smiling. Castiel looked down as he tried to understand, a small smile on his own when he finally got it.
Nodding his head even though no one was there to see it, he dragged the unconscious body under a tarp, pulling the flap over the hiding spot before making his way back to the entrance of the bunker.
He burst onto the illuminated streets like a bat out of hell, where he kept running until he found his way to another set of alleyways. Slumping against the nearest wall, he keeled over in exhaustion.
“I have a confession,” he started, eyes shifting between Dean and the wall behind him. Dean inclined his head, indicating for him to continue. “I have… never…” gesturing weakly between them.
“S-stop!” he cried out, trying to get the men to stop their chant as they continued to pull him closer. A cold pang of fear in the pit of his stomach.
A flurry of butterflies in his stomach as they made the deserted, rugged, island into a cozy getaway.
He had just managed to get the person loose, a freaking teenager of all things, and moving the body into hiding when an ear-splitting scream cut through the air. On instinct alone, Dean dropped the body to swing his rifle around aiming towards the source. The hand that’s not on the trigger reaching up to press the call button on the walkie.
Breath hitching at the intrusion, Cas’ hand on his shoulder while the other easily guided the plug, he tried to relax his breathing as he felt it inch its way inside.
"Fix it!" he nearly shouted, slamming his hand on the armrest, silencing the witch before she could continue. “I’ve waited,” his voice was shaky. “Stuck in that prison.
“And I honestly don’t care what people would think.” Hearing the man’s clothes shuffling a bit. Must be straightening his suit or something, Castiel told himself. “Since I was a kid, I admired you. That was until I realized it wasn’t admiration. I, uh, really like you.”
The kid relaxed, only slightly, as one hand tucked itself into the same pocket where the cash was while the other waved goodbye, thanking Dean before turning and walking away.
Stuff like this does happen. The easiest way is to either help them relax or stop until the problem relieves itself.
“On your back,” Dean commanded softly, “Head off the bed,” And Cas did as he was told, rolling onto his back, looking up at the man as he towered over him. The man’s stature towering over him, his dominating appearance causing his own need to stand at full attention.
“Shut up!” Dean spat back as he attempted to lift his brother off of him, struggling against the weight. But it was no use, the man was taller and despite his size, trained just alongside Dean while growing up.
He glanced down at his left hand, the bandages had just been changed before he left. He still mentally scolded himself for not paying attention to what he had been doing since he was old enough to walk. Bobby was concerned, more so annoyed that Dean was gonna get blood on the shop floor.
“But I’ll admit, you are much smarter than I am,” Dean turned and perched himself to sit on the ledge, taking in his brother’s suspicious look. “You always beat me in chess and other book smart stuff.”
“Nothing,” he said simply, standing up and reaching a hand to pat Sam on the shoulder but recoiling it when he felt the static cling.
“Hello, Meg.” he greeted politely, watching as she nodded her head in response before taking a long sip from her iced coffee.
"Anyways, after I woke up, I ran. When I managed to get the doors open, I recognized what day it was and I ran."
“I’m just glad you’re here,” Dean murmured after pulling himself away, foreheads touching. “I know I should be mad, but I’m just relieved you’re here. Right now. And I’m not letting you go,” leaning in to kiss Cas again, hands traveling to wrap around Cas’ to help him up.
Eventually, they both fell to the floor, exhausted and grossed out at the feeling of icing in their nooks and crannies.
"Let it be the way you want, just don't leave me now. I can't be without you," he trailed off, heart sinking when the creature turned away. His gaze dropped to the floor, staring down at his knees, legs dangling off the alter he was thrown on, the rejection creeping in. Was this was going to be all for nothing?
He slowly walked forwards, the warmth guiding him like gentle hands towards it. Stepping into the darkness, eyes adjusting enough to notice a figure leaning against the wall. Arms crossed, the only thing Dean could make out was the glowing blue eyes before falling unconscious.
“Castiel,” words like silk, familiar. A shudder through his body when the memories of his name being whispered into his ear in that same tone. Deep, full of lust as they lay together in the throws of passion.
"You know I'm not good at "verbal affirmations," he started, taking a deep breath in. "But I show how I feel a lot easier,"
“You don’t mind, do you,” He was about to answer, having suddenly become distracted by the sound of the cap opening and the dildo being placed near his hole.
“Cas! We’re gonna be late!” Dean shouted up the stairs as he checked his watch for the 6th time that evening. He managed to get off work early so that he could shower and get ready in a timely manner.
"This… This is what dragons do to the men and women of your village. They don't just kill them. They burn them alive. They fill them with fire and hold them in their claws while they scream in agony as the fire consumes them from within. Until all that's left is smoldering ashes...and a new dragon
'Michael' Castiel thought, the tone more familiar as he froze so as not to draw attention to himself.
He had brought a hand to touch his forehead, pulling it away to see blood when his name was called out again. Looking up, he saw in time to see the creature coming straight at him again, its claws primed and ready.
He did it a couple more times, each thrust becoming quicker and harder before releasing the man's head.
“How about this. If you’re still feeling ‘concern’ over my welfare and extracurricular activities, then we can talk it over a tankard at Charlie’s.”
Hearing the hum of satisfaction once the plug was all the way in, Dean yelped when those hands gripped his body to manhandle in to lay long ways on the couch.
Then it was quiet. Meg isn’t usually the type to stay that way for long, but if Castiel could keep his eyes focused away from her face maybe she won’t say anything. There’s something in the air that just smells like she has a comment coming and he isn’t sure he wants to know what that’s going to be.
Hello Everyone! I am posting this chapter early because I can't wait til the end of April and because I haven't updated this story in a while and I apologize!!
In a blink of an eye, Dean was upright and leaning against one of the trees as he watched the man walk across the campsite. Over to where he first appeared and...picking up the intact vase. What the hell?!
Taking his seat, Castiel shifted inside the booth so that he was closer to the wall. Eldon plopped himself next to him, having no trouble closing the gap between them, resting an arm along with the backrest and across Castiel’s shoulders once again.
“My love,” he whispered. “We only just began to get reacquainted,” irritation clear as he began to stand. He looked in the direction of the cavalry, waving his hand in Dean’s direction.
He kept his eyes closed, breathing a sigh of relief, taking in the silence and the weight that was keeping him pinned had now vanished.
“On your knees,” he heard him murmur into his ear, disrupting his thoughts, the hands disappearing from his body. He obediently did as he was asked.
"Cas, let's go, wake up!" Slapping his cheeks a couple of times. When he got no response, Dean let out an irritated sigh. There's no way he's gonna be able to carry this guy back to the bunker.
Watching the character bounce up and down, pausing before turning to the opening and gliding across.
"I told you, this a better position," taking the distraction to tie the other arm. "What? Has no one done this to you?” Castiel questioned. “Please tell me you haven’t been doing doggy style this entire time?”
Shaking his head, Castiel let the man continue guessing. He doesn’t know why, but he just didn’t want to come out and say what this game was about. On one hand, he thought that if he told anyone about a game that was suddenly talking to him like it was a real human being, he might be called crazy. Possibly get dragged to the looney bin.
Dean’s head fell back, resting against Castiel’s shoulder as the man continued his assault. Kissing, nipping, squeezing and letting go of the grip around his throat intermittently after his hips began it’s bruising pace again.
Dean stayed silently, allowing his fingertips to graze the top of the stone, noticing intricate carvings within it.
On the television, the count from the presidential election is happening, and it’s close. They show that Cas has won Florida, the nail-bitter state of all elections. But Cas won!
The Dragon’s red eyes burned in his mind as he fought against the restraints, wanting to be free, to take his prize.
Being able to tell when a person was hitting on him was a relief. He was able to turn them down when he didn’t feel the same. He was always too oblivious when someone was flirting. But when he felt equally attracted to the person, it made moments like this hard.
They were off in a matter of seconds, their leader pleased with his decision to come down for that bit of news.
He and Dean had just started getting to know one another, talking to the point where Castiel now joins the man during his coffee breaks. Dean usually came in maybe twice or three times a week, or sent people in his stead, based on the card they would hand over with Dean’s name printed on the back.
“Good night, Castiel,” the man stopped at the entrance, turning with his eyes squinted at the phrase.
“And if it's crossed, I can not be your therapist anymore,” Castiel stated, squashing the feeling in his stomach and focusing his mind elsewhere to prevent the blood flow from running south. He pulled his hand free, stepping back and turning so that he was facing the man.
“W-wow. Is that a yes to taking a ride in the Impala? Because, I have other things I’d like you to say yes to if that’s the answer,” Dean commented, a little dreamily and a goofy smile that Castiel has come to love.
When Dean woke, through his blurry vision, he could see the flickering lights of candles in the darkened room.
Castiel watched as Dean answered all the questions, feeling a sense of pride at how well he was doing. There was a stutter here and there, but that’s to be expected with the shock, the officer told Castiel.
The person stood from their spot, holding the vase close, pulling the hood down revealing...a woman!?
“Please,” Dean voiced shuddered, moving his head away from the kiss. Castiel taking the moment to leave a trail of nips and biting along his neck to his shoulder.
There was that unspoken question of ‘Why’ left hanging in the air, Castiel clenching his jaw as he looked from his watch to his lap, back to his cup, and repeat.
“Don’t beat yourself up about it,” Sammy’s voice pipped up, Dean opening his eyes to look at his brother. “Benny fights at 205, the Light Heavy Weight division. You usually fight at the Middle Weight division-”
rude," the voice right in his ear. Castiel grinned over his shoulder at the assailant which only irritated the man more, pressing his body further onto Cas.
“Y-yes sir,” Dean responded shakily, the anticipation killing him as he moved his hips slightly, the need clear on his face. Castiel smiled up, one hand on Dean’s hip, the other reaching up to pull at the tie to bring the man down for a sloppy kiss.
“When there’s a truly wicked soul causing havoc on mankind they pounce on the opportunity to rip that person to...shreds” a small chuckle, the air tickling his ear.
“You sure?” Green eyes asked, concern in his voice as he watched Castiel get up from his seat, stumbling a bit as he went. He was grateful for having paid off his tab before his last drink. He might have encouraged himself to have another if he didn’t.
“Hey, I know this is completely off topic...but I-uh..brought the impala.” Castiel looked up, not saying a word. His entire body filling with an emotion he hadn’t felt in a really long time. Was it love?
He could die, right then and there, instead of having to sit through this. Dean was going to die at Eldon’s hands and everything would become much worse for him. He’ll be taken out of school, he’ll be forced to leave this job, just when he was feeling somewhat independent from the Frankstein family.
"Cherry Pie a la mode. You said, "what a way to a man's heart, through the stomach." Dean's corner lip lifted, a huff that could've been a chuckle. Raising a hand to run through his hair, he brought it back to cover his mouth as Dean’s smile widened.
“Well...Sometimes it's something I'm scared of, sometimes it's something I long for…” Dean trailed off, his head dropping to his knees, mumbling out the next phrase. “I'm really scared of the dragon, Castiel.” A shaky exhale before continuing, the images of the Dragon flashing through his mind. Dean was standing before the beast, his hand had just reached out to the touch the scales. It was peaceful for a moment before the thing reared its head to drown him in flames. “All this time I've been…preparing to…”
"I-well-I wanted to know what other services do you…" letting the question hang as Dean's eyes drifted towards Castiel crotch.
“D-Dean,” Castiel tried again with a shuddering breath when his hands went for his belt. “I-we can’t do this,”
It took a while, but Dean found himself back in the same cafe after a couple of weeks. He found the atmosphere peaceful and the smell of coffee helped ease his rampant thoughts. After the transition of power, dealing with the staff and other members, establishing himself as the new boss did take a toll on his sleep schedule. He had more meetings later on and he couldn't afford to take a nap in the middle of the day.
Through the brush, he could make out uniforms of black and purple, a banner with the same colors and a pair of glowing red eyes placed right in the middle.
“You are him, but the seal is still intact,” He leaned back, a hand on his chin. Eyes closing, as if in thought. Dean, urging any part of him to move.
"Not tonight," he mumbled. "You're more than welcome to go by yourself but I have a meeting to attend to." She pouted and Dean thanked whoever lived above when Sam arrived.
“A Senator," Dean began, waving his arms in exaggeration after Sam brought his image up on the screen to confirm it. The man looks exactly like his picture, except for the hair. Usually, it's combed over and neat, now it looks like he just rolled out of bed, no pun intended.
The words hung in the air, Dean could feel his heart begin to race. He felt like he couldn't breathe. It’s like he could feel the tension between the voices.
Embarrassed because he wasn't able to hold back, cumming quicker than when he was first discovering his body.
“Oh, what kind of car?” She enthused. Castiel’s eyes were going to fall out of his head with the number of times he’s rolled his eyes. Meg was not a car enthusiast.
It wasn’t until he got to the front door, Castiel’s hand keeping it open so he could lock it behind him, as he was grateful that Dean hadn’t seen the bulge that Castiel was sporting from the noises and the beautiful view of the man cumming had done to him.
to myself, I'm gonna make you feel how I did during those moments," Castiels smile widened at the equal part lust and horror as he pulled his pants on.
Castiel shook his head in response, lifting the mop into the bucket to wring it out with the handle. Their conversations aren’t long, minimal at most, nothing to brag or compensate with money for.
A small piece of him blamed himself for not believing when he was told these stories from when he was a kid. The tales about magic and creatures alike. But Dean didn’t believe any of it. He couldn’t see any of it.
He stared down at the bubble. It’s been almost a week of having this game on his phone. He’s searched for all he could on food and weapons...he felt pretty good. He was laying in bed, the sun hadn’t quite made itself known.
He honestly wanted to call everything she was saying as ridiculous and stay until his shift ended. But there was another part of him wanting to leave. To go to Dean.
He was taught by his parents from a young age that he would take over as a personal servant to the Winchester family once they were able to retire.
Dean inched them both backward until Castiel's knees hit the bed, taking that opportunity to turn the man around, dropping to his knees.
He took a deep breath of the night air, his men stood before him with his carriage at the ready, his right hand walking up to let him know they are ready to leave when he is.
“Dean?” a familiar voice calling out from the hallway, a moment later Sam’s head popped around the corner. “Hey, I got more snacks and beer.” Hauling an armful of bags to emphasize his point.
Dean always keeping the situation light between them with jokes and entertaining stories. But this was different.
“Please,” Dean’s voice pleaded. “I know,” he struggled to continue, his voice sounding desperate. “That’s there’s a line that can not be crossed,”
Giving the lightly tanned ass a good firm squeeze that earned him the sound he wanted, adding to high.
That only seemed to encourage Cas to go faster, his hips stuttering not too long after. Feeling that dick throb in his ass would make Dean cum again if the pain from his ass wasn’t settling in.
Glancing up from his phone, the map indicating that he should turn the whole car around, that’s when a flicker of light caught his eye in his rearview mirror. Turning in his seat, sure enough, there was a store with neon signs lit up stating “we’re open”.
“Hello,” a sweet-sounding voice called over the music. Dean turned around and was met with a girl standing there in a very see-through outfit, knee-length dress. Her hair was done up in pigtails and a crazy amount of makeup on her face. If he wasn’t so out of breath, he’d have been turned on by her body alone. But the makeup, yeah, that's a no go for him.
“There’s not much to tell,” he started. “Dad happened to find Mom while he was coming back from a meeting at another kingdom, she was outside tending the farm she lived on. He fell in love at first sight,” looking up to meet his brother’s gaze, a story they’ve both been told a thousand times.
Just shoot him now. Please. He could feel his entire being just shut down at the confession. Everything he had managed to build, the trust and friendship he had built with Dean…. He can feel it all shattering. He was so careful. About all of it. Not to let anything slip about himself. Just school and this job. Dean was so open about his life, his family, his little brother… Now that the whole truth about either one was out there….
He glanced at his phone, relieved that he had the forethought to turn the screen off. Rubbing his temples, he grabbed the cellular device, pocketing it before leaving.
“Michael! Tell them to stop!” he shouted, his betrothed just smiled at him, allowing everything to continue.
“Open up,” and Cas did, allowing him to slowly ease himself farther into Cas’ mouth. He breathed in and out of his nose as he slipped further in.
He hadn't noticed the man had knelt in front of him, but the gaze from those blue eyes made him forget everything.
Castiel’s own having hit his chest and bed sheets. He shuddered when he felt Dean slide out, already missing the feeling of being full.
“You took almost a two-month break...did something happen with that office client?” Was that concern and irritation in Cas’ voice? Dean was hesitant at first, reluctantly revealing what had happened from the time Castiel left to now.
Dean stared up at the dark ceiling, watching the dark outline of the ceiling blade fans as his current date curled against his side with one leg hooked around his. She was becoming a new regular, hiring him for parties at work, events, and just recently her 10-year high school reunion. That one had been interesting.
"It is quite alright, this wasn't even my favorite suit," the man with blue eyes and just walked out of bed hair stated, gladly accepting the napkins from the now nervous man.
The burglar was taken away on a gurney later on due to still being unconscious. And thankfully Castiel had the forethought to grab a beanie for Dean to cover up the flowers on his head.
“I know” was all Dean said as he decided to layout on the couch, his attention focused on the ceiling.
Dean smiled, reaching forward for the pitcher and chalice to pour himself a glass of wine, wishing someone had brought ale instead.
“Then come get me,” and with that Castiel made a beeline for the door while hearing Dean’s shouts of protest.
Dean hummed, not paying attention, giving a particularly loud suck to Cas' neck causing the man below him to grip tighter right as he started convulsing.
“Dean, this can’t happen,” Castiel managed to say after reining himself in, glad he was able to at least keep his voice firm.
"Course, there’s nothing more dangerous than some a-hole who thinks he’s on a holy mission for himself." The smile disappeared, a hard frown on Lucifer's lips.
He stared at those words for a while. Castiel didn’t know how to respond to that. But he did know what could say,
“What I mean is, Escorts are supposed to keep people company. They are selected for their warmth, appearance, intelligence, humor, and charm,” Dean could feel his cheeks heating up at the compliment. “I believe sex is just a bonus because when you find someone you can make a connection with, sometimes it feels right and sometimes it’s not.”
“How is a King kept from such a huge part of history,” Dean demanded, grabbing hold of Bobby’s shirt. An anchor to keep him grounded from doing something stupid. He needed to know.
“You’re damn right you didn’t listen! You were reckless and selfish and arrogant! Now we got a stranger that we need to throw out of here as soon as possible.”
Castiel could feel the tug of the plug, sighing in relief when it was pulled out, but was short-lived when he felt the tip of Dean's tongue pushing past the wall of muscle.
Rubbing at his forehead trying to disperse the pain he was feeling, the pounding behind his eyes as he shuffled through the castle to ease his restlessness.
“I’m not mad Dean. Just…disappointed.” Emphasizing his point by pushing deeper into the wound causing the man below him to cry out, hand dropping from Cas’ wrist. Dean opened his eyes, catching Castiel’s gaze as he starring down at him. “If you had come directly to me when this happened, I would have told you everything had been taken care of.”
“Help!” the voice through the door called out, causing Dean to jump slightly, followed by pounding on the door. Feeling his blood turn cold, he was frozen in place. They’ve never had this happen before. Usually, the person would get caught in their traps, preventing any entry onto the grounds.
He breathed in, held it for the count of ten before letting it out. At least this last one was going to be fairly easy.
He did as he was told, after watching Cas remove the latex gloves, his knees spread apart with his arms and head resting on the backrest.
“Like hell,” Dean interrupted, gesturing to the groupings of men scattered around the throne room, some stopping their conversation at the sudden shout. “You can’t expect me to go back to bed with something going on-”
Dean's read all kinds of stories that have happened. With easy access to the internet, you can see the deeds being done across the state. Amazed and sickened by how creative these people could get and how far they’ve come since the beginning.
One hand gripping Dean's left shoulder, the other holding onto his forearm for dear life as Dean continued the rocking motion.
“Let's switch to rowing - we might find the island then,” he waited. Michael hadn’t said a word when he turned to look at him. “We have to make a decision.”
This chant...why are they singing this chant? He looked around when he noticed everyone in the village had stopped their celebrating.
Dean thought for a moment, his attention moving to Castiel who was just now standing. Whipping his pants off and walking away, Gabriel calling out about being rude. Castiel ignored him, instead, he turned to look at Dean, a smile gracing his lips.
“We're happy you're safe, but we need to get to the island,” the helmsman intervened, bowing to pardon the interruption. “I know it's hard, but we must make sure the dragon is dead,” Michael glared over his shoulder at the man, the moment ruined.
“Stay,” he whispered just before Dean could turn away, realizing he was leaving. If the pants he was wearing were any indication.
Pulling himself together, Dean stood up to follow, all the while roughly pulling his tie off, stripping his suit, and meeting Castiel in the middle of the room for a rough kiss.
“This is not my home,” he started, curling his fists when the man just stood there. Unperturbed at the comment.
“An artifact was stolen,” John spoke, cutting off his son mid tangent. “And not just any artifact,” just then, Bobby appeared by John’s side, a grim look on his face that Dean hadn’t seen since the passing of his wife.
"Wait!" Dean cried out, sitting up better, trying to stop the Dragon from backing away. His heart beating rapidly, hands reaching out for the creature.
Castiel’s eyes narrowed when Dean approached, arms extended as he rattled off his reasons as to why they should give it a try.
He felt the blindfold lift from his face, his eyes adjusting to the dim glow of his table side lamp; hearing the sound of light switch flicking on.
"H-hold on," Castiel managed to get out, one hand reaching back to stop the man from continuing. Dean gave one last thrust, keeping himself inside the man as he waited.
Maybe Sam was going to compensate for the slack? Which is why he’d be his advisor and confidant? Or what if he becomes mad and Sam was to take over from the start?
Dean smiled to himself, they had stayed in this position since Castiel had dropped him on the altar. The man had changed back into a human not to long ago. His head on his lap with his arms wrapped around Dean’s body.
“Start with your tongue,” Castiel began, holding himself at the base. “When you feel comfortable, you use your mouth,”
“Oh, Dean.” Meg purred. Castiel rolled his eyes, turning back to the machine to assemble and start a fresh cup. He could hear the conversation between the two, the entirety making his skin crawl.
The thieves couldn’t have gotten far… but Dean wasn’t told of anything about who or where the people hailed from.
Dean raised his arms as it came closer, allowing the creature to wrap its claws around him. Lifting him easily off the boat and into the sky.
“Fine,” Dean quipped back, putting on a smile for his younger brother who gave a concerned look in return.
Dean has only seen drawings of the item in question, the books didn’t do the item justice as it shined in the beam of moonlight.
"Another?" He questioned once he got close enough, his hand already reaching under the table to grab the necessary bottle.
This wasn’t real. It had to be a dream. In those nights where Castiel couldn’t sleep, the nights those green eyes haunting him, as his hands would slip under the band of his underwear. Imagining the man and things he would do to Dean. Kissing, biting, sucking.
“What’s wrong,” Concern in his voice, mentally tallying all the possible situations running through his mind of what could have his brother looking this way. “How’s Bobby doing?” before the other could say anything.
“Oh, that’s ok, sir. Tipping is not necessary.” Castiel explained, holding both hands out to wave away to money.
“Dean,” he felt a hand on his cheek after what felt like an eternity, the cool touch snapping him from the pain, abruptly dispersing it when he opened his eyes to find familiar blues looking at him in concern.
They were “alone” in his limo, he didn’t have to contain the moan when the wet heat enveloped him. Just the tip at first, slowly easing his way down until the man had taken the whole length into his mouth and down his throat.
No matter how many times he asked, Dean’s face always had a blush on his face. Dean can talk about everything under the sun, which is how he was open about his life in general but his sexual encounters make him a little more hesitant.
The man staring at him with lust blown eyes, cheeks flushed, his suit rumpled from being manhandled, his cock fully erect and resting against said suit.
“How long have you worn those?” Dean questioned, leaning back into his previous position, his eyes lifting to almost meet Castiels’, stopping just short of making eye contact. Castiel didn’t respond. “I know you have a boyfriend, but did he give you those hickeys as well as that limp?”
a silvery voice said through the fog. Dean attempted to move his head to see what was going on, but alas, he couldn’t move. Like he was paralyzed.
Blue eyes, messy black hair, the aristocratic coat with the silver and black tapestry that looked expensive. Even for him. Black boots and pants completed the outfit, that and the curious expression looking up at him. One leg up with one arm draped over it, his other hand perching him up as he watched Dean carefully.
He relished the cool air conditioning after he finally made it to work, looking around at the less than crowded coffee shop. Nodding to Inias, who was currently taking a customer’s order, before hobbling to the back to put his apron on and put his helmet somewhere.
He risked a glance at Dean, surprised that the man was still as calm and composed as he had had first sat down. His crisp black suit, dark green tie, and white undershirt had Cas turning his face away again. Dean looked...so good. His normal jeans and t-shirt were gone. The usually combed hair was smoothed over with some kind of gel or hairspray, a huge contrast to the grease monkey he led Castiel to believe.
Dean shuddered at the name. At least they weren’t descendants of Frankenstein's monster. The whole family just radiated creepiness.
“I-uh...huh, wow,” Dean cleared his throat, sitting up straighter and fixing his shirt before reaching across the table to clasp Castiel’s in his own. “My name is Dean Winchester. I am an Aquarius. I enjoy sunsets, long walks on the beach, and I own an auto shop.”
He couldn’t keep the smile off his face, urging his horse to ride faster after clearing the first gate. The guards looking on in question at his passing, but not daring to halt the Prince.
“How did the royal family manage to come up with a spell to trap me?” He placed the pointed end of the pin to Uriel’s temple, slowly pushing in. At first, the man tried to hold in the noise, breathing ragged, eventually succumbing to the pain, cursing and shouting.
“Now that you have a name, let's get acquainted. When people get acquainted, they shake hands. Nice to meet you, Castiel. I'm Dean.”
He sat up, realization smacking Castiel in the face as he watched Eldon winding up for the first hit.
“Second," Dean continued, grabbing Eldon's attention by adjusting his tie and leaning forward on his elbows, his hands folded together on top of the table. "Before anything goes down, let's move this somewhere else."
Dean gave him a cocky smile, almost posing with his dick standing at attention with the condom on before grabbing Cas’ legs, pulling him to the edge of the bed. He pushed one Cas’ legs up to his chest while the other was wrapped loosely around Dean’s left leg.
“How dare you compare Cake and Pie. It’s like you don’t even know me!” Dean would throw a temper tantrum if he wasn’t a freaking adult, Sam always forgets the pie. How does Sam expect Dean to last the night with sandwiches, chips, and beer alone? He needs that sweetness to balance out all that salt. And watch his cholesterol go...up.
“Are you ok?” he questioned, even though the answer was obvious after shifting out of the booth to help remove the access weight from Castiel’s lower legs. Honestly, Castiel felt relief more than anything. So much so that he had no control over his actions as he threw himself into Dean’s arms. “Woah,” was all the man said, his arms wrapping around Castiel. Hesitant at first, but once they were around Castiel’s waist, they held him firmer. “I got you,” Dean murmured into Castiel’s ear.
"Alright," taking a long swig of his beer, almost draining it, before slamming it on the table. "You got any idea on where they could have taken him?" Crossing his arms and leaning against the table.
Dean’s cock straining with precum, Castiel purposefully neglected it as his hands touched everywhere but there.
“You’re much tighter than usual,” Good thing Cas couldn’t see Dean’s face, it’s probably as red as a tomato. “When was the last time you had any prepping done?”
The first thing he realized was that he was laying out on a stretcher, standing around him was Bobby, Garth, Sam, and one other person who wore the Medic uniform. A blue shirt with the emblems sewn on with the stethoscope around his neck, wearing gloves that were holding the railing of the stretcher he was on.
“No, that’s not it, I came-” he was interrupted by a distant crashing sound from above. They both looked up in time as dust clouds shook from the boards above.
When questioned by his father, who was angry with his disobedience, and Bobby, he told them there wasn’t much that he remembered aside from getting knocked out from being thrown against a tree by one of the thieves.
Hands freezing in place as the man before him slowly dropped to his elbows, Castiel could see the man’s torso expanding and collapsing as Dean tried to regain his breathing.
For a man of Dean’s tastes and lifestyle, as Castiel took in the black suit, black-tie with red laced stripes with matching cufflinks, handkerchief, and a white button-up shirt. An outfit Castiel had picked out this morning due to the business meetings he was going to have...and...not because Castiel thought it would make the man look ridiculously good.
He leaned back in his seat, staring off into the night, admiring the glow of the moon as he relished in the utter bliss of his freedom.
the creature thing started, hearing it tut as its hand moved back down and across his chest. Opening his eyes, all Dean could see from his point of view was a shadowed hand. The darkness surrounding them, keeping Dean from seeing anything else in the room.
Castiel didn't say anything, removing his hands to undo the man's loose knot keeping his pants up. Hearing the faint sound of material as it dropped around Dean's ankles. He took this cue to remove his shirt as Castiel stood there watching. Drinking up the smooth, evenly toned, freckled skin of this man.
It was a big tub and could fit two people in total. Three if Dean counted that one time with the princess and her lady in waiting.
Dean lay there, ass still in the air. Not a care in the world as he revealed in post-orgasmic bliss. He didn’t hear the noise in the kitchen or ruffling through drawers. He did hear the light footfalls coming closer and that deep gravelly voice telling him he should move to the bigger couch.
It happened in a blink of an eye. But Dean had learned to just react to the tingling in the back of his mind. His body moved before he could comprehend what had happened. Sam had been standing in the middle of the room, ways away, and the next he was a mere inches from him. Dean’s hands were raised, his brother’s wrists held in his own before they could do anything. His hands a bright green color as he watched Sam wince.
Dean thought to himself, groaning at the feeling, trying to push back at the sensation. Two strong hands on either side of his ass kept him still, kneading the meat there just before he felt that tongue push past the ring of muscle.
Dean hadn't realized he'd closed his eyes as he swirled his tongue around the slit or when he felt a hand on the back of his head.
"Silence," the third man demanded after throwing something at the second man from his standing position by the fire. His hood was still up but Dean was able to make out short blond hair with bright green eyes under the cover of darkness.
"Is there anything I can get you, a new coffee or maybe one of the pastries..." rambling off everything he could do to make the man forgive him as he got down on his hands and knees to clean up the spill. "I noticed you were drinking tea, we have a huge s-" he was silenced when he felt a finger under his chin, guiding him to look up.
There’s something in the air or maybe a full moon? But after the incident with the mysterious man, three more incidents occurred during the rest of Dean’s shift.
Pain. Running rampant from the point of entry, sending shockwaves throughout his body. Stumbling backward until his back hit the wall, he falls to his knees, left hand out to catch himself from face-planting while his right grabs at the wound on the left shoulder. Heartbeat thudding in his ears, breathing becoming ragged he sat back on his heels to better grip his shoulder to apply pressure.
Now that he was fully coherent, he gestured to the door on the other side of the room as Dean continued his assault on Cas’ neck.
It felt like a rock had settled in Dean's stomach at the story. Held captive before the purge even started? These must have been some sick sons of bitches. Must've been some kind of ritual they were planning to perform during this disgusting night.
Like a good servant, he doesn't say anything. He still brings Dean his coffee in the morning and lays out his outfits in the morning.
“Oomph!” Dean grunted, not having seen the man move, he was suddenly knocked to the ground, those intense blue eyes staring down at him. He heard the man… purr...before leaning down to capture his lips.
“Where're the herbs he was carrying?” Castiel asked out loud, clicking yes. The screen blanked for a second, the image of his character rising and falling slowly, his health bar really low.
The elevator dinged before opening and leading him into a long hallway. The room he was looking for was at the end.
"Hold him still," Juac told Boris, feeling the man's burly hands grab Dean's upper arms, keeping them tight to his body.
Placing the glass on the table, he poured a generous amount for the man. He had just placed the bottle away when he heard a bit of laughter.
“You have no ruling over what I can do,” the fourth snipped back, holding the vase up, gazing at it as it glistened in the moonlight.
Castiel's own personal rule after watching all of his friends, family, and even random strangers get their hearts broken. Declaring how they were in "Love". Which is why Castiel decided to stick to his own devices by focusing on passing his college courses. So how in the hell does this man walk into Castiel's life, introducing himself as "Hi, I'm Dean Winchester" Son of Lucifer, Castiel thought after telling the man he wasn't interested.
Opening his mouth and relaxing his jaw, he kept his head still as he felt the Cas' dick slowly slide past his lips, his teeth, his tongue till it hit the back of his throat.
They’ve talked in-depth about everything Dean has ever done after he managed to get him to talk but this hesitation meant that Castiel has managed to step into an unknown area.
He watched Cas make his way back to the desk, putting his jacket back on and fixing his tie once again before turning around to give Dean a small smile.
Looking up, past the ground of people, came a dark silhouette from the sky. It’s massive wingspan beating as it came closer.
Cas’s hand reached out for the buttons of the shirt, undoing each one until he was able to run his hands over the man’s front. Loving the gasp when he pinched one of Dean’s nipples.
Whiskey then. Since it was the first bottle he grabbed. Now Castiel was not drunk, he was just on the cusp of clumsy and tipsy. If he had gotten another drink, this would have been a whole different story.
The only reason Castiel helped jerk Dean off was that Dean had asked him and it was part of his job to help ease the process.
the voice singsonged, happiness evident in their voice when the hand traveled back up and into his hair.
After Dean thanked her, after recovering from his shock, she walked away. He mentally tallied just how much coffee he bought from here.
One of the things he’s learned while being trained is to not intermingle with the clients. It’s not what they were there for.
“What are you doing,” Cas asked, his voice shakey when Dean started guiding him to the bed. His answer was Dean kissing him again, turning him in the process so the back of his legs touched the bed.
“He will,” his voice firm, turning his attention away from the woman to show that he was done with the conversation.
After he woke up four days later after the incident in the woods, everything did not feel the same. Off putting would be the word.
Dean kept his eyes shut, hoping if he kept them closed long enough, the creature would go away. He felt two hands on his chest, pinching either nipple eliciting a small moan from Dean, before roaming up to grasp either side of his face.
“He was made to believe that you were “special”. That not only were you human but couldn’t perceive magic.” Dean felt like the wind had been knocked out of him as he tried to comprehend this new detail. “It didn’t stop him from trying to show you everything, despite Mary forbidding him.”
He continued with his female clientele, only meeting with the male clients if they were the ones that just wanted companionship.
“First off,” Dean’s voice filled the space between them, keeping his tone even and low so as to not bring any unwanted attention. “Gross. You and your family are disgusting.”
“I might feel a little sympathy if you answer my question,” He looked at her, both of them locked in an intense gaze. He knows he can last longer than her when they have moments like this. He can count on one hand how many times she’s won and this was something she wasn’t going to win.
Dean watched, his vision clearing after he was able to control his breathing, to recognize that it was Cas standing there. Arms crossed, eyes closed, biting his lip as he hummed a nonsensical tune.
In the distance he could make out the dragon skull standing tall out of the ocean, the sun setting behind it, illuminating where the eye socket would be, giving Dean an uneasy feeling. What if this doesn’t work?
He wasn’t anticipating Dean to sit up, wrapping his arms around Castiel’s neck to kiss him, leaning back and bringing the other with him.
His last appointment was a single guy in his late twenties. This would be their third session together.
He was by the man in an instant, lacing his fingers with the outstretched hand. What he wasn’t expecting was to be pulled down, lips on his in a sloppy kiss. Body pressed greedily into his.
“D-Dean,” Cas muttered out when Dean broke the kiss to leave a trail of licks and nips down his chest, arching his back off the mattress when Dean took him into his mouth.
“Dresser,” he said with a sad sigh when the hands disappeared. The sound of a drawer opening, a pause then the sound of some shuffling.
“Up,” Castiel's hands going straight for Dean’s belt and zipper. Shoving the pants and underwear down right as Dean hopped up to sit on the edge.
An awkward silence fell between the two as Dean finished his drink and Castiel sat there staring at his hands.
Castiel allowed himself to be pushed down as he watched the man before him strip off his suit, piece by piece.
Grabbing his coat and satchel from the post, he quietly closed the door to the garage behind him. He was glad at this moment that there was a side door in which he could walk his bike through without having to open the big metal door.
"Where did you find that," the voice low in a growl. Looking over, Lucifer's whole demeanor changed from relaxed to downright tense and dangerous.
He felt the familiar pang of guilt when he remembered the last time he fucked up. His left shoulder gave a ghostly ache as images of his brother bloody and unconscious on the ground drifted through his mind. They still haunt him in his dreams to this day.
“No, this is exactly what I needed.” He took a tentative sip, enjoying the smooth bitter taste and how the temperature was perfect to sip. Reaching in his jacket pocket, he pulled out his wallet, intending to pay until Anna held up both hands.
“Yes, sir,” He wanted to cry in happiness when he was rewarded with Dean’s cock at his entrance, slowly pushing through the ringed muscle. The stretch only burned slightly as he adjusted to the man’s size. Biting his lips, a moan escaping as his body accepted inch after inch of Dean's length and girth. He let out a strangled gasp when he could feel the man fully sheathed within him
Also, I went back to chapter 1 and 2, I edited/updated them. Fixed little nuggets of mistakes and added a little more if you want to go back and read :D
He didn’t hear the exchange of words behind him, nor the footsteps, but he felt the body brush against his. Later he’ll blame it on his drunken self, but looking into those green eyes...every dirty thought came bursting forward.
“This is not a job for a Prince to lose his life over,” John continued. Was that concern in his eyes? Dean observed, noticing his mother grip tightening on his father’s arm.
“Kill him already,” Castiel called out, Dean noticing the man’s smirk from the corner of his eye as he shifted closer to one of the pillars. He brought his attention back to Sam, closing his eyes as he took a deep breath in.
He heard the shuffling of Michael’s men as they scrambled to figure out how to get Dean from the middle of the lake when something caught his eye.
“I love you, Dean. I always have. But I couldn’t come to you like this.” Cas continued, more tears falling, Dean wiping them away with his thumbs, his chest aching at the whole thing. “Please leave, I can-” he was stopped when a pair of lips closed over his.
In all his time with people talking about their sexual fantasies, he’s been able to keep himself relatively neutral during those times.
The man walked out from the shadows, Dean grimacing at the sex dungeon attire, the guy brought his nine tail whip up, using the other hand to run through the leather tails.
“And you also never believed that it was Santa Clause placing presents under the tree. I know. But this year will be different because you have me.”
The man uncrossed his arms to fix the trenchcoat, looking down and examining himself all the way up to his fingernails.
“The dragon is no more,” Dean’s voice said sternly, his fiance turning back to him. “Take me home, Michael. I don't want to go back,” while putting as much conviction into his voice, leaning forward to rest his head on Michael’s shoulder.
The gate closed and locked behind him, spurring the adrenaline inside that this was really happening. His eyes finally landing on his opponent before him when the cheering dulled when the referee stood in the middle, the announcer holding up the microphone.
In all honesty, Castiel has been playing this game for a total of three days. He hasn’t entered the maze, hasn’t looked for a weapon to even start, and he actually was beginning to lose interest.
He sat in the small boat as the men across the lake pulled him closer. His heart beating fast at the realization that the day had come.
“You got a lot of explaining to do, Dean,” Bobby said, breaking the silence, and being the first to get up. Everyone followed suit. Dean wasn’t expecting to be enveloped in a hug by Sam so soon, relaxing into his grip and patting his back. Feeling a pat on his own back, Dean turned to see Bobby.
“Well until he finds me a princess to marry, I am a free man,” with that said, and wanting to get out of the conversation, he hopped over the fence. Patting his brother on the shoulder before dashing towards the servant girls.
"That's how I was born. That's how dragons further their race. That is what's going to happen to you too, Dean,"
“Fuck…” Dean uttered, holding up his gun as he spun the wheel to unlock the door. “I’m opening the door.” He called before pushing the door open.
Cas groaned again, his eyes squinting through the obvious pain in his face, to Dean. Eyes widening, he looked around.
“You’ve been neglecting those duties,” His voice stern, crossing his arms over his chest. His eyes show worry despite what he was saying.
“Now, where is their next meeting?” Dean questioned, guiding the tip of the blade from the bound man's upper cheek, just under their left eye, tracing an imaginary line down to his cheek.
The one positive thing about Castiel’s ability to see someone’s sexual satisfaction meter was that no one else knew about it. Except for the people who trained him and keep people like him protected.
The Dragon roared just before descending, aiming straight for a narrow hole on the side of the bones. Dean clutching for dear life at the increasing speed, the sunlight now gone the farther they went.
Not a minute later Dean joined him, he was straightening out his pants and tie just as the church bells rang.
“Out of the pants,” Cas commanded, pulling his fingers free to let Dean pull his dress pants off, taking the shoes off as well since they were in his way. In the meantime, Cas stroked himself at the display.
He heard a huff of dissatisfaction as the feeling of the man's uncovered ass stopping in its gyrating motion.
The money had already been counted and placed in the safe, everything tidied up and ready for tomorrow, Castiel turned the lock. The thud of it being secured signaled Inias to ask if his ride was on his way.
He didn’t want to move, every fiber said he should run but another whisper inside of him told him to not be afraid. He closed his eyes, feeling a headache coming on. Bringing hands to his head as the pain increased. Sinking to the floor as it became unbearable.
Dean get's Castiel a Burrito Blanket out of the blue, Castiel doesn't understand it's purpose until he realizes how soft it is.
“So beautiful,” he heard Cas utter under his breath, hearing the squirt of the lube bottle. Glancing over his shoulder, Dean groaned at the sight of Cas’ applying a generous amount of lube to his thick cock.
His beloved had finally woken up, teased him, and insisted he knew nothing about where or who Castiel was.
“Your highness,” The voice called again, Dean turned to see a servant standing at the entrance to the library. “Your father has requested your presence,” he said with his head bowed in respect for disturbing the moment.
Not to mention the moans he could hear from behind the door. All he wanted to do is burst in and hold the man. Screw the witch!
He whimpered when Dean pulled away, only to find the man’s thumb before him. He took the digit into his mouth, moaning as he sucked it down. He looked up to the man as he stared down, lust blown eyes, mouth parted as he watched Castiel.
“Ugh!” Dean gasped out, the strokes were fast and confident, Dean panting at the sensation. Despite the cold hands, the contrast on his cock felt amazing.
He walked to the couch with the assistance of Cas' arm on his lower back. Guiding him to lay on his stomach. Dean nearly jumped out of his skin when he felt cold touch his ass.
“I-uh, I don-” he was silenced with a finger to his lips, those green eyes now held mischief as he made a ‘tsking’ sound with his tongue.
“At your own pace,” he reminded as he sat back in his seat, placing his pen and notebook onto the side table to give Dean his full attention.
“When started dating towards the beginning of the year. And as we got to know each other better, when you told me about you not being fond of the holiday, I thought I’d give it a shot to try and convince you.”
“I don’t know Doc, maybe there’s something wrong with me,” Dean admitted while distracting Castiel from finishing his sentence.
Shaking his head, he kept the thought that he at least satisfied the two women, if them being asleep were any indication.
This must all be in his head, he thought as he rubbed his eyes and forehead. Feeling the sweat-soaked skin as he ran his hand over his face.
“Clarence,” her voice soft, blue eyes finally lifting to meet those that were usually sly and mischievous, surprised to find them concerned and warm. Caring, even.
It was as the man predicted, the bell dinging over the entrance. Castiel could feel the blood pumping in his ears at the situation settling at the back of his throat. He wanted to call out for the man to run but the movement beside him seized anything from happening.
The gasps Castiel received was music to his ears as he began his slow pace, enjoying the view of the writhing man before him. Dean’s hands moving everywhere, trying to gain purchase. Muttering Castiel’s name under his breath like a mantra.
“How about you give it a day or two to recover, then we’ll talk.” The man said while pulling something out of his breast pocket.
Reaching around the fabric for the opening, his hands found the split between the two, pushing it to the side just enough to peer out.
“Hey Castiel, you want to go get pizza?” Glancing up, he nodded, taking note of the character on the screen looking almost saddened.
Dean shook his mind of the rest of the night and the ones after as the girl next to him cuddled closer.
“So much for going slow,” Dean commented, glancing over his shoulder and seeing the plug in Castiel’s hand.
Michael looked down at the rope in his hand, anger clear on his face before ordering his helmsman to help him pull. They didn’t get very far as Dean moved forward to yank the rope off the boat, causing Michael to fall backwards from the force he’d been using to pull.
“After you dropped me off with my foster family...something happened. I felt like my body was on fire. And I changed into that
Dean smiled, relieved that he didn't have to sit here and listen to the rest of this hocus pocus anymore. He stood to follow the man, hearing Bobby resume a tale his brother had never heard before, despite all the books he’s read.
He pushed down any hesitance of what could go wrong, like them ganging up on him or even sicking hound dogs on him, he gripped the door handle to open it.”
“We got 2 minutes before the ceremony starts,” Castiel commented as he tucked himself back into his pants, zipping and buckling the belt but paused when he noticed the small trail of cum starting to drip from the man's hole. He smirked to himself, enjoying the view.
"You're paying extra, so why not?" He commented, placing both hands on her hips as she slowly slid herself along his length.
A sick sense of satisfaction crept in, the screams echoing in his mind as he felt lips press to his neck, traveling down to the back of his neck.
"You call us "dragons", but we call ourselves "those born from ash"," Dean turned at the sound of man's voice getting closer, his demeanor cold and impassive. He tossed something onto the slab, Dean turning to see something that resembled a doll, set on fire.
"Possibly," and Dean proceeded to tell them about the betrayal and everything else Castiel had told him.
“So..” drawing out the pause, his eyes looking everywhere but at Dean. His gaze landing somewhere on the ceiling, a small smile gracing his lips before dropping into a firm line, it didn’t last long when a small chuckle came out when he looked to the gun in his hand. “You’ve placed me in quite a situation here, Dean.”
He-lucifer-he was in the bunker. He could have escaped at any time. But it was a setup. To have Sam chase after Castiel. But Dean came instead. Which would be placing Sam in danger.
Castiel had just wanted to just relax and cuddle. Dean did want to start watching Christmas movies. So they met in the middle.
Eldon had waved at Dean with the gun in his hand, indicating for him to join them just before placing the barrel of the gun in Castiel’s lap, the thing cocked which made Castiel freeze.
“I-I don’t know who,” he tried, his hand reaching up to hold the wrist of the hand holding his throat.
"How am I lying? His brother owns the bakery you love. He's always there but you never see him. Given his status, you are quite daft,"
Unlocking the screen he found that the game was still open. The little blobby character was moving up and down slowly, the health bar in the red.
Sam and his mother didn’t exactly tell him they were magical either. He could have started believing then if they’d done it in front of him.
“And do you remember the oath I, myself, gave you in return?” Dean stayed silent, eyes opening wide in slight confusion. From the wound, the blood loss and the fact that Cas had his freaking thumb making worse, he remained quiet.
"And she died. Just like everyone else, Sam," he found a bottle of beer in the bags, no caring if it wasn't cold, popping the top to take a swig. He turned around to see the look of distraught on Sam's face.
Leaning back onto his elbow on the bed, Castiel gazed with lust blown eyes as the man took him deeper and deeper, heading falling back when Dean took him all the way to the hilt, staying there with a small hum.
Castiel bit his tongue. To tell a complete stranger that he just broke up with his boyfriend would be too much information to spill all at once. Besides, this guy is just going to give him a half-hearted apology and continue on his way.
Castiel’s head dropped low as the thrusts became faster, the grip on his hips tightening, the grunting and moaning from the man above sending shivers down his spine. He could feel his own cock straining as it bobbed from the force.
He expected to hear the uncapping of lube, instead, he felt something wet around the rim of his hole.
Dean ran a hand over his face, holding in a groan as he listened to Cas read through his speech. He just finished with the first verse of it and was working his way through the examples.
"I bet you're other partners couldn't have taken that so easily," Castiel mocked, looking over his shoulder with a smirk. He hissed in pain from the smack on his ass.
They were different people who gave them the card. Each one stating to meet at the same location tomorrow night.
As they made there way down the path, “Ramble on” by Led Zepplin blasted over the speakers as his entrance music. The crowd roared around him as he got to the referee halted him to check for his mouthpiece, cup check, and the rest of him for any other things that might break the rules.
“You’re not my mate,” the man uttered, tracing his lips along Dean’s jaw and up towards his ears. “He would have been able to deflect the paralysis,” he felt teeth nibble at his ear, sending tendrils of pleasure throughout his body.
“The concept is still there.” and with that, Cas turned around and walked back to the kitchen to fix up his coffee. It was still too early for this.
Just managing to grip the weapon in his hand when he felt hands on his ankles, pulling him out from his hideout. In the fray, Dean turned and stabbed at the attacker.
“Put that away,” snapped the first, sitting up abruptly, his hood falling back to reveal long red hair, pointy ears peeking through the long locks.
"Dean, this guy is trying to stop the purge. You're just gonna let him get fed to the wolves?" Sam was now standing.
“Dean,” How long has it been since their last session? Probably two weeks ago? Shaking his head, he pulled the item back and then pushing it in a little more. He was met with little resistance after each thrust. He was getting used to it. Good.
“Keep your hands up, Boy. You’re tiring him out with those kicks. Just don’t let him take you down,” The warning bell rang, signaling the cornermen to leave. The ice pack Garth had on Dean’s back disappeared, causing his muscles to ache at the loss.
There really wasn’t much Dean could do to avoid the creature in time as its talons wrapped around him, gripping him tight as it launched itself into the air.
“Don’t jinx us,” snarled the second from across the way, picking something up and tossing it over the fire at the man.
Castiel stumbled in his steps when his eyes settled on the man, who definitely couldn’t be Dean because he wasn’t wearing his usual attire.
“They threatened me, Raphael and Michael. If I did not do as they said-” He was cut off by a loud bang. For a split second, everything was frozen in time, Dean bracing for the pain.
“Great, did you get the pie?” Dean asked as he tried to get a peek inside the bags for that sweet and delicious dessert.
“Yeah,” was all Dean could get out, a slight blush on his cheeks. “His words, his physique...the way he took control,” he let out a huff of air, bringing the pillow back to his face as if unable to believe he admitted all this.
“You have a customer by the way,” his brother called out before disappearing into the kitchen. Glancing over his shoulder as he placed the box on the ground, he saw a tall, solemn-looking man.
But Dean didn’t go anywhere. He placed a hand under his eye, of course, you can’t feel actual bags under your eyes. He may be getting a lot of sleep, but there's a difference in restful sleep and restlessness. He’s been having dreams.
“Why did you leave the pit? I told you not to! That's what he's waiting for.” That when something clicked. When Dean escaped, the area didn’t look like where he was. Which could only mean one thing...
Castiel’s only response was to slam his hands on the table, the noise was loud enough to stop the small talk surrounding the shop, all eyes and attention turning towards him. On top of the anger, Castiel felt his face flush at his loss of control.
“I quit though!” Castiel tried, the booming noise upstairs was a good indication that he needed to get Dean out of there. Now! “I turned in my gun and badge just before I learned they were going to raid this joint. I came here to take you away,”
When he came out from the back, he saw the wide blue eyes of his friend as he stared down at his dropped phone. It buzzed a few more times.
Dean whimpered when the hand suddenly disappeared, those same hands holding his hips as he attempted to gain some kind of friction.
"Ok, fuck it," Dean leaned forward, his hand coming up to move Cas' head to his shoulder before replacing his hand under Cas' knee.
It had been pouring rain this entire week, which benefited the employees at the coffee shop. The days prior had been busy and quite frankly, they needed a break.
“Sure we can,” Dean muttered as he kissed the happy trail before him, nuzzling the hairs with his nose as he began to unzip Cas’ pants.
He paused. His mind raced as he tried to remember. Something. Anything. But all he could come up with was the need to touch the man before him and he didn’t know why.
“Not all my energy has been on training, Sammy,” emphasizing his point when he noticed a couple of the servant girls walking by. The giggled, hands covering their lips when Dean gave them a wink.
Hopefully, the length of this chapter makes up for the neglect I did not mean to give this story T.T
A booming noise had both men looking skyward, tendrils of red filled the sky, breaking the barrier of fog as they descended slowly back to the ground. Michael letting go as they both prepared for whatever it was.
“Don’t you look happy, Castiel” the twang of his commander commented, bringing him back to reality. She sat opposite of him in the small compartment, her lips stained red as they pulled back to reveal her sharp canines.
The first thing he noticed after the blur of sleep faded, was red. The room was doused in red lighting. The blaring noise was the alarm.
To him, he wished that the whole Meg and Dean thing had worked out so he wouldn’t be in this situation.
“No Cas-” Dean paused, bringing a hand up to rub it down his face. “I mean, you have me. And as a Winchester, we go all out for our friends and loved ones this time of year,” he said while pulling out a headband. Upon further inspection, as Dean walked closer to Cas, it was a green headband with little trees dangling off by little green fuzzy wires. Giving the man a confused look as Dean placed the headband on Cas’ head.
“Maybe he’s just a generous tipper in general?” Castiel tried, letting the mop plop on the ground, wondering where that new stain under the table came from.
He felt his heart fluttering at the gaze, unfamiliar with the urges that sprang up when those eyes looked at him with concern.
the amusement in the man’s tone as it trailed off, Dean could feel his face heating in embarrassment.
Pushing the comforter off, he realized that he wasn’t wearing any clothes. He debated on whether or not he should just stay there till someone showed up.
“There was a guy that used to come into the restaurant I worked in at the time. He was hot and I knew he was checking me out. I could always feel his eyes on me. There was a shift where he came in and I was his server. I ended up writing my number on the receipt,” he used his hands to mime how the rest was history.
He helped Castiel sit up, moving away as he sat on the edge of the bed. Watching the man pick up something from the floor, turning towards him with it in his hands. His tie.
He turned around until he was able to sit on his legs, so his ass wasn't touching the couch, in front of the man.
“So you’re having an office fuck. You haven’t had one of those before,” Castiel commented as he pulled the gloves on and moving to place himself directly behind Dean “How are you feeling?” while placing a hand on man’s ass, the other grabbing the lube.
“Well darling, it’ll become quite clear here soon. Please,” She gestured for him to hand the cards over, which he did. With the cards in hand, she placed them on the table in a neat stack.
“If we end up eating as we go, we don’t have to worry about dessert,” Dean joked as he plopped back down next to Castiel.
Castiel liked to believe this meter was a curse. Not so much a gift as it was praised when he first learned of its existence.
His stomach chose that moment to let itself be known. Growling loud enough that Castiel heard laughter in response.
Glaring at the man for bringing up their last session, it quickly vanished when he watched Cas pull out a butt plug. It was bigger than the previous ones he’s used but smaller than Cas’ actual size. Dean watched as he lathered it up before turning in his direction.
“I-I don’t understand,” Feeling the hand ghost it’s way further south, tangling themselves in the coarse happy trail.
Hearing Dean whimper at the contact right as Castiel started his slow strokes along his length, allowed him to use his right to slowly pull the toy out again.
“And what are you supposed to be?” Dean hissed out at the sensation of a hand grasping him through his pants. At least he’s still had his pants on.
“Klutz,” Inias mumbled under his breath. By the tone in his voice, he didn’t believe it, but Castiel shrugged it off as his friend placed an order in front of him. “Your handsome friend is in his usual spot.” Glaring and commenting that Dean wasn’t a friend, he grabbed the cup and made his way to the back booth.
“If you believe that what you did felt right, you should pursue those interests,” he watched the meter about Dean’s head shift between red and yellow. A way Castiel knew he was contemplating everything.
“We didn't have time, Castiel,” Dean looked him right in the eyes, answering honestly. “The dragon appeared,”
Scratching his chin with his free hand while the other adjusted his clothes, he couldn’t shake this feeling.
“Of course, take your time. I’m going to leave the room for a second. I can bring you some water if you want,”
Scooting back into his comforter, wrapping it tightly around his body, he laid on his back, face turned towards the pillow.
an image flashed through his mind, too quick for him to catch, his mind distracted as the coolness glided just below his navel.
“You know, I have seen that pretty green-eyed man come in for a while, the one that comes in those expensive suites.” Meg’s voice teased from somewhere behind him. Castiel didn’t say anything as he sprayed more of the liquid onto the caked grounds. “Do you think he’s single?”
“Not my type? Seriously? A man that comes in wearing a suit is everyone's type. Don’t get me started on those eyes. And boyfriend...you mean the sugar daddy that pays for your schooling.” Castiel paused and glared at his coworker. “Do you even know the suite's name?”
He’s waited for this moment for almost seven months. He can wait a little more. At this moment, this was not
A small smile on Cas’ face at the memory. They were both invited to a 4th of July cookout at the Winchesters family abode. It was also the first time Castiel was being introduced to the family. Thankfully, everyone was so accepting and ended up loving him. Once the fireworks went off across the lake, Castiel was entranced.
Dean took off at a sprint to catch up, managing to catch a glimpse of Bobby and Sam sprawled out on the floor, reaching the doorway in time to see two people shove a tied up Castiel into the trunk of an awaiting car.
Covered in blood and huffing from the exertion, he turned towards Lucifer, who wore a cocky smile bringing his fingers up, ready to snap.
One of the two girls he spent the night with, one of them brought his clean clothes. As she left, Dean turned to watch her leave, but she was suddenly gone. But he could swear he saw a small light flicker away.
A blonde-haired girl had flirted with him, touching his left forearm while handing him a card, saying how they should hang out and get to know each other better.
Still unable to move, Dean watched as he made his way back over as he picked up Dean’s satchel that was lost during his skirmish and a cloth to cover the porcelain vase in hand. Squatting down to his height, Dean felt the item being pushed into his own arms as he leaned close to whisper something into his ear.
"Hey Big Boy," a daunting voice called out, Dean raised a gun in the direction of the sound. The voice tutted at the display. "Someone came packing,"
“Somewhere in the Castle, I'd imagine.” She spoke nonchalantly, gesturing with one hand towards the place in question. “You weren’t knocked out for very long.”
Dean didn’t care. The close proximity. He wanted it. He leaned a little into the man, his hand touching Cas’, eyes closed when the side of his head rested on the man’s cheek.
Castiel couldn't wipe the smile off his face as he wandered down the hall, hand tracing along the wall. Not caring that his pants are open for the world to see. Or staff.
So that’s where Castiel finds himself, sitting in Dean’s car. Which was now parked outside his apartment complex.
He doesn’t know how long time passed until the creature decided to give up, bringing his arms down from covering his face, he looked up to see the coast was clear.
An all-white robe decorated with equal parts silk and lace, red ribbons, and flowers placed here and there. A vine shape crowned adorned his head. Little silver ornate trinkets decorating his wrists and neck.
He took a deep breath in, held it for a few seconds before releasing it. His back leaning against the door, he slowly slid down till he was sitting, his head resting against the door.
"Enough! Tomorrow at sunrise you'll get into the boat and hoist the sail. The east wind will take you to the open sea, where the ships sail." His words were final, letting his arm go limp by his side as he turned around.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas said abruptly, the finger starting its slow thrusts again. “If it makes you feel any better, I don’t see you as a ‘high-end prostitute’”
“So letting the girl take control did not work. How did she react?” He watched Dean bite his lip as he tried to remember. Originally he ‘homework’ Castiel gave him was to find a guy and do the same thing, this could still work with a female.
The woman turned, hand raising to deflect the dagger, the sound of glass smashing into the ground stopping everyone in their tracks.
His white shirt was rumpled, hair messy more so than normal. But that wasn’t what stood out, aside from the bike helmet under his arm, it was the purpled bruise along the side of his face that started just under his left eye and extended to his chin. Dean watched him walk towards Anna who was standing at the counter, her hand gingerly touching his face. He noticed the flinch from Castiel and felt his heart sink.
He quickly tucked his gun into the waistband of his jeans, having had it in a death grip the entire dead sprint.
The next time he visited the cafe it was a few days later. He was flagged by his brother and a girl, who he forgot the name of already, and they sat at one of the booths.
“Look, I’m not sorry for pulling you from the danger but the bad news is we can’t keep you here. Once those people that were chasing clears out, you’re gone.” He watched as the man’s shoulders relax slightly, his gaze turning towards the concrete floor.
Without another word, Castiel easily slid inside the warm heat, moaning low in his throat. The tightness gripped him as he began his bruising pace. Dean a panting mess below him, his body pushing into the backrest of the seat.
At the site of the man, Dean could feel a small ache in his chest. He was a mix of wanting to run into the man's arms or running like hell.
“I’m not gonna be killed, Sammy,” Dean casually walked up to the window of his room. “We both know you don’t have the stomach to be King,” Unlatching the window, he looked out to the vast surroundings that belonged to the Winchester Castle. The moon glowing brightly above him, lighting everything for him to see.
Without a word, Castiel grabbed the hilt of the toy and slowly pulled it out. Dean grunting at the feeling, groaning once it was completely out.
“The one with the evil entity locked away,” Bobby filled in, his voice rough like he’d been pulled away from his nightly drinking. “The one capable of bringing all life as we know it to its knees, darken the skies and bring about the enslavement of the human race. And more than likely the extinction if it holds a grudge for what our ancestors did to it,”
"Only the dragon needs you here!" Pulling his arm out of Dean's reach before the man could do anything. "Go away!"
“You know we’re supposed to be leaving for the party, right?” Dean asked, taking in the sweatpants and oversized t-shirt.
If Dean wasn’t back by six, Sam was to assume he had failed. Sam had gotten all teary-eyed, arguing that he’ll be back and that Dean was being ridiculous. Of course, Dean’s rebuttal that he may be Batman, but even he was Human and can’t fight all the bad guys at once.
"Yes, I know. But. This is different. You said no proposals. So the one way around it is to make a promise," Dean said while opening the box, a simple silver band standing amongst the blue velvet. "This is a promise. One that will tell you, every time you look down at it, that I care for you, very much,"
“Would you..." Sam started, keeping his attention on the brothers. Castiel had just managed to tackle Gabriel who was laughing hysterically. "Would you want one?"
“I can teach you,” Castiel said, smirking over his cup of tea Dean had made him. He was starting to enjoy this pampering.
Swinging his satchel over his head and onto his shoulder, he made his way downstairs, and out the door. He felt the vague vibration of his phone through the material, he ignored it as he got on his bike and rode to the library.
The green-eyed man smiled, letting his head drop to his forearms as he let out a laugh. Castiel stared at him until he was able to calm himself enough to look back at him.
Castiel looked around the path, trying to find the right colors. The words Dean spoke within the first couple of days being here floating through his mind. picking flowers at the same time. Dean was nowhere to be seen, even though he knew where the man was exactly.
Over the last couple of weeks, Dean’s visits to the coffee shop have been few and far between, sometimes he would ask one of his men to grab him and whoever else wants coffee. How else are people supposed to function without it?
“Great,” he managed out, smiling back as to not worry her. The servant placed his breakfast in front of him at the same time Sam came in. He smiled at them before taking his seat across from Dean.
*****************tags will be updated, but just FYI, there is NO MAIN/MAJOR CHARACTER DEATH****************
“Go back to bed,” was all he said in between the conversation after noticing their presence. His face a mix of exhaustion from being woken in the middle of the night and stress from whatever is going on. Brow furrowed as he spoke to his men as if his sons weren’t there. Some of those men bowing before dismissing themselves to carry on whatever task they were assigned.
‘What the hell…’ the distant thought floated in his mind, his body felt like it was weightless in the darkness surrounding him.
Rubbing at the discomfort, he stopped just short of entering the dining hall. His mother and father are probably inside already. Bobby was more than likely looking for Sam to drag him away from his books. Like every morning.
Sam and Dean figured the kidnappers had brought Cas back to the Church where he originally woke up. To finish that ritual they've been waiting to do.
“Cas. Oh my god. I love you, but please. I can’t poop with you outside the stall door!” Dean exploded, feeling his insides turning from having to hold it for so long.
One night he had brought one of his latest conquests, a supermodel, home from some big charity event.
"I know, and there's nothing we can do about," Dean called out, walking over to the bag of goodies on the table across the room.
He remembers lying in utter bliss on his bed after having just finished his stretch session with Cas. Dean was equal parts happy and embarrassed about what happened.
Looking around to make sure the coast was clear, there was no one, before taking a tentative step forward from his hiding spot across the street.
Fist clenched hard enough that his knuckles were turning white, Castiel sat up. Eldon reaching out to grab Castiel, pinching his cheeks together to force him back. Without thinking, or any thoughts at all, Castiel continued forward and used the momentum to smash his forehead into Eldon's. The loud crack and overwhelming dizzy feeling surrounded Castiel as he faltered backward.
“But 3 losses, mind you,” The younger brother stared at him with a stern face before a smile broken through. “I’ll try my hardest with this one. A catchweight at 190”
Moving his hand to the back of the man's head to keep it steady, he jerked his hips up, earning the noise he was craving.
One of the few times he was able to be ready before Castiel. When he got home, Cas had been hustling around, cleaning the house, already home from work.
Running a hand along the length, eliciting a breathy moan from the man into the kiss, his hands reaching up to grasp Dean’s shoulders. Hanging on for dear life when the hand moved faster.
When his mother placed her hand on top of his during dinner one night, he nearly pulled his hand away at the feel of some kind of energy vibrating above his.
The loud bang would always wake Dean from those nightmares. Sweating and panting as he tried to blink away the imaginary blood staining his hands.
Glancing down at Bobby’s body, the man’s chest slowly rising and falling, Dean walked to the doors, pushing them open.
“The cliffs again...Calm down, we passed it,” Gabriel soothed, a hand on Michael’s shoulder only to be thrown off a moment later, Michael shouting his frustration into the night.
“You're scared of dragons but you play with them.” Castiel snapped out, standing up straighter to stare hard at the man. Dean had chosen a dark red robe, a color that looked so astonishing on him. “Why isn't Michael coming for you?” he finally got out, tearing his attention away from the man.
What really piqued his interest was during the meals with his family. Something was going on between his Mother and Sam that had him completely unsure of everything in his life.
It might have been the alcohol. Of course, the adrenaline and hormones could be affecting him enough to make him nod.
“I guess the better question would be what the make is?” Dean smiled, heat filling Cas’ cheeks again at the way Dean was looking at him.
"You may have the Angel Blade, but you're still human," snapping his fingers to emphasize. Dean paused in his advance towards the man, internally sighing in relief when nothing happens. He kept moving, Lucifer continuing to snap his fingers until Dean grabbed his shirt collar and punching him in the face.
Castiel leaned into the touch, the hand was warm and it made his heartache for more contact. He simply shook his head in response, not realizing it would cause Dean to stand with a smile on his face.
He dried his hands of the blood, a fresh cloth was provided once the deed was done. He got his answer.
“Do you have any preferences?” Castiel asked from the kitchen, standing in front of his self-titled  “booze cabinet.”
“So you have a plan?” Castiel questioned, stepping forward, across the room to get closer to the man, whose face was slightly red from embarrassment.
“I haven’t been feeling all that great,” Dean commented offhandedly, leaning against the bedpost with his arms crossed as well, a brief image of his brother making things float in the library drifted into his mind. He avoided eye contact with the man to sit on the edge of the bed to put his boots on.
After shutting the door, Castiel took in the familiar settings of the apartment. A kitchen set right next to the doorway, the spacious living room before him with a dining room off to the left. The hallway next to the kitchen leading down to the bedroom and bathroom.
“Good-ish,” Dean’s tone was casual. Much different than their first session. At first, Dean came in all nervous and shy, not really wanting to talk about his problems. After Castiel had a breakthrough during their first session, Dean was now an open book.
This is where he finds himself now, watching the servants around him finish their last-minute touch-ups to make sure the mansion was up to par before Mr. Winchester came home. The house was immaculate already, but knowing the Master of the house was coming back, there was no room for error.
He slowed his pace when he saw the housekeeper, Meg, walking towards him, an arm full of towels while giving him a knowing look.
He doesn't know what woke him, something like a trombone or some kind of horn, blaring loud enough to wake him from a peaceful slumber.
At that, Sam slumped onto the cot with an exhausted sigh, not even bothering to cover himself with the paper-thin blanket they had laying across it. Smirk turning into a smile, Dean grabbed a rifle and slinging it over his shoulder before shutting the cabinet doors and tucking his 9mm into the waistband of his jeans.
"You’re a freaking child, you know that? Just because you can do what you want, doesn’t mean you get to do whatever you want." At that, he pulled out his gun, firing it into the man's skull beside him, shoving the oncoming attacker to dark towards the pews.
"That's...that was a good date. You weren't fond of the different temperatures of the pie versus the ice cream," Dean watched Castiel breathe a sigh of relief, standing up straighter as he adjusted his tie. "You kept mumbling stuff like, "molecules" and "overly sweet"."
His heart nearly stopped when his alarm went off, signaling that he should be getting dressed for work.
“First, music. Gotta set the mood,” he moved away from Cas to the cassette player under the TV, turning to volume up and the sound of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” playing on the speakers. “And-” he came back, reaching inside the box. “Mistletoe,” Castiel watching him pull out what looked like a bunch of leaves with fake berries, tied together by a red ribbon and holding over the two of them.
When he looked up to meet Cas’s eyes once again, something caught his attention to the left of him. Embedded into the floor was a bullet hole. The wisps of dust and dirt were just settling when Dean turned his attention back to the man before him. A small sigh escaped his lips as he stood, the chair giving a slight squeak, before walking around the table. He adjusted his black pinstriped jacket before loosening his blue tie as Castiel leaned against the front of the desk, the gun still in hand pointing towards its intended target.
“Look here pretty boy, I’m gonna save you a whole lot of trouble,” she started. “You need to go home and kiss the man,”
Heartbeat in their ears, the two sprinted across the way. Their aim is the sturdy steel door at the end.
“We live in a world full of mystical beings and you don’t believe something could be contained inside a simple vase?” Sam questioned, completely appalled at his brother’s flawed logic.
“He’s straight and has a girlfriend.” Blue eyes glaring at his friend from across the cafe. It was closing time and they were taking sections of the store to mop. “Besides, I have a boyfriend. And he’s not my type”
“Can we do it again?” the words catching the Therapist off guard. When Castiel looked up from buttoning his shirt, he was met with hopeful eyes that made his heart skip.
Taking that as his cue, he crawled onto the loveseat to present his ass. It didn’t take too long to feel that firm, callused hand hold his hip as he felt a finger slowly push in.
He stumbled in his step, lost in his thoughts, the realization of where he was going becoming clearer as he passed the familiar family portrait. The statue of a knight he accidentally knocked over as a kid, the one with a piece of the stone missing from the helmet, was right next to the throne room.
"Cas," Dean breathed out, quickly rushing around the Altar to Cas' unconscious body. "Hey buddy, wake up," while checking his pulse, relieved to feel a heartbeat. A really low one at that.
He sighed, one arm wrapped around the girl, her head nestled on his bicep. His other hand moving to rest behind his head.
Of course, Cas yelped a moment later when he felt a smack on his ass, followed by Dean calling out ‘Now that’s what I call Customer Service’ on his way to the bathroom, whistling a random tune as he went to clean up.
The first two muttered an apology as the third rubbed his hands together, the shroud of his hood blocking Dean’s view of his face.
“We...let’s start over.” He sighed out under his breath. Castiel put his hand out with a small smile. “I’m Castiel Novak, I’m twenty-four and I’m majoring in Urban Sociology/Rural Sociology with a minor in Humanistic Sociology. Oh, and I'm also working on my Associate in Arts degree.” Castiel used his other hand to cover his mouth, smothering the laugh at the incredulous look on Dean’s face.
Slowly inching his way into the room, he was almost fully in the room before he felt a force pushing him back outside, the door pulling from his grasp as it quietly shut behind him.
He kept his attention on the gun but he could hear the footsteps as they got closer, the embarrassing squeak of the seats as the newcomer slid into the spot before them.
Dean never believed in all the “tales of olde” or the “fairy tales” that were told to him and his brother by their parents when they were younger. To him, it was a load of crap. The only explanation as to why creatures aren’t alive today is after a dark force was locked away, all magical creatures cut themselves off from all mankind.
“I read it somewhere and thought I’d give it a try,” brows pinching together in confusion, trying to understand how twirling your dick would cheer someone up.
After all the elements tried to bring him back, Frigga was able to do so with a kiss. Her tears turned into the pearly white berries on the mistletoe plant. From that day on, Frigga decreed that whoever should ever stand under the mistletoe, no harm should befall them, only a kiss, a token of love,”
Dean, gripping the armrest for dear life, stuck in the position. Not that he was complaining. Moaning loudly when he hit a particular spot over and over.
He was met with silence, something he should be concerned with but Dean needed a moment alone and Cas was happy to oblige.
Castiel read on different sites that morning about how the odds of winning weren’t fair. The characters were stupid and wouldn’t listen. There were pages of other reviews but none of them mentioned anything about anyone winning.
Dean really can't imagine anything better than this, including heaven. How could anyone think that somewhere else is better than right now, in this room, with the person they love?
“Castiel freaking Novak!” Dean all but shouted at the two men. Bobby had a bored look on his face while Sam just looked just as amazed as Dean.
Dean chalked it up to the good luck he always seemed to have. As for this jitteriness? He couldn’t quite put a nail in that one.
“We know,” everyone except Sam commented. She gave everyone a dirty look before smiling. Everyone else joined in before they set up their next round.
He pushed the two fingers in, all the way to his knuckles, keeping them there to allow Dean to adjust.
The decorating started off easy enough, getting a couple of cookies done before attempting the gingerbread house.
“Dean, please.” His brother interrupted. His attention moved to the man who was currently hanging on Dean. “This-this isn’t you.”
“Fighting out of the blue corner, weighing in at 195, all the way from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, a winning streak of 6 and 2, Bennnnnnnt Lafitte!” the man across from him raised his arms, turning around to acknowledge the crowd.
He'd been secretly crushing on this guy since the first day they met. Sure that's a loaded statement, considering he's been using the Professional Stretchers shortly after he decided to open himself up to male clients.
‘It was just a dream,’ he kept telling himself over and over as he wiped his face from the sweat soaking his skin. As he evened out his breathing, his gaze wandered around the room he was in.
Rachel was close, her face right next to his ear. Her fingers inching up his suit to his tie, her fingers fixing it before lifting a hand to adjust his collar.
“May God have mercy on our souls,” Bobby muttered under his breath right as the alarms started to blare.
“That was amazing,” the words were breathy as Dean tried to compose himself. Castiel nodded, not sure the man even saw the movement before he turned to find his clothes. He was lucky they weren’t caught.
After changing out of his formal wear, the two made themselves comfortable on the couch, shuffling through Netflix for something to watch.
“Making me the best man didn’t exactly put you in the best position,” Dean bit out as he brushed past Cas, stopping only when he felt a hand on his wrist holding him back.
He yelped when he felt a grip on his cock, eyes opening to find nothing there. But through the water and the cloth, he can see himself reacting to the touch.
"I'm not surprised. You of all people would have a long clientele list," a compliment that went straight to Dean's heart. "Who's the special client today?"
He looked up for a second to see the upper torso of his brother peering down at him. Even though it was dark out, he could still see the worry on his face.
Accepting the proffered napkins, dabbing at the spill. Meg looked on, commenting how he could just clean himself up with magic.
“H-hold on a second!” The moose of a man called out, racing after his brother, entering Dean’s room to see him at his dresser, pulling on a white cotton shirt and brown trousers before walking to the corner to pick up his satchel.
He heard something 'clink' by his feet. Dean's heart sunk when he saw that it was the ocarina. Looking up, he was nearly blinded by fire erupting from within a small narrow passage. Dean staring in horror and sadness at the realization that it was over, a tear slid down his cheek.
The room was simple, a queen size bed with a comfortable-looking blue comforter. A lot of fluffy pillows at one end. One nightstand, a dresser, a closest off to the right with an attached bathroom next to it. Pretty plain based on the rooms Castiel has seen since working for the company.
He glanced down at the peaceful look, his mind going back to the way Castiel had gripped him, not too hard, but enough to give that feeling of tightness to help him along.
Taking the opportunity to swing his legs around to quickly scale down the vines below his window. He heard his name shouted above, but it would be too late. Dean has snuck down these plants too many times to know what ones were thicker and sturdier to grab than the rest.
Whooping in success as he cleared the final gate, he was exposed to the great planes that lay beyond his kingdom. The moon shined on, full and bright as it hung in the sky, illuminating everything it touched.
Twenty minutes later found the two in Dean’s car, the impala purring down the street as they made their way to their destination.
The creature spoke in a smoky voice, full of want and desire as it rubbed Dean through his pants. Dean trying hard to resist, willing to the blood to fly south at the sensation.
He blew into the Ocarina, his fingers slowly moving to the notes, his eyes closing as he fought with all his might.
He almost groaned when the man slid out just before he reached his throat, sliding in and out, just out of reach of where Castiel wanted him to go.
Turning towards the source, his breath caught in his throat at the sight of Dean in the doorway. His bare chest sweaty from being outside, he was wearing soft grey sweats and he was covered in dirt.
It was when Cas' tongue disappeared and a very manly whimper escaped Dean's lips did he look over his shoulder.
Someone in an all-white dress was standing across the street, in the middle of the park, directly across from Dean.
“What are you doing?!” Dean cried out a second later when that grip tightened, pulling Dean’s arm through the hole to his side.
“Oh,” Castiel managed out, this story was new, his gaze catching how the memory Dean was remembering managed to move the indicator of his meter over the line into yellow by just a hair.
Grasping the doorknob, he peered inside the darkroom. The sound of moaning, sheets moving as the body on them writhed around.
Specialized meaning he had the ability to see someone's sexual satisfaction meter. It was quite disturbing, especially after he was told what it was. It pretty much scared him when he thought about all his older siblings at different points in his life coming home, the little arrow would be all the way to the right in the green.
“Ok,” he said, almost reluctantly, with a small smile. But Sam wasn’t, Dean knew that. He could read his little brother like a book. The brooding pensive shoulders were his give away, that and the bitchface he liked to use on Dean when he did or said something stupid.
“Dean...you’re not getting it. When it comes back, I won’t be able to control it. You’ll be it’s prisoner until it sucks you dry,”
“So let’s play a game. It’s fairly simple. I ask a question. You answer it truthfully. If I don’t like the answer…” He trailed off, making a gunshot noise and using the gun to mock shoot the man before him. Letting his gaze drift to finally making eye contact with his Boss, he gave the slightest nod before moving his attention back to where it was.
Rolling his eyes, Dean glanced over at his brother who watched, engrossed by the story their Uncle Bobby was telling them.
"Nope, nope!"  Taking off faster than he’s ever done before, the back of his mind wishing he could have taken the impala.
The ride in the Dragon’s claws uncomfortable as Dean was carried away, the familiar tugging after each beat of its wings.
Garth stepped in the apply the vaseline to his face as one of the officials went over the rules they already briefed him on in the waiting area. Once all that was done he was allowed to enter the cage, the crowd cheered louder.
Panting, he kept moving through the alcove, following the path to a wider area. Every sense told him to keep running. But to where?!
Which is why he finds himself in the hallway, leaning against the door to his bedroom. His mate inside. He can feel the stress and lust mixing into the air and it was driving him crazy.
“There you are, Castiel. Look at what I made,” Castiel glanced from his hunched position, the fire finally receding as he took back control. “It looks like a dragon, but it won't fly. Will you teach me to see the wind?”
“Ah,” Dean half cried out half whined when a light blasted through the darkness. He moved his head away, closing his eyes away from the blinding light. Only to groan at the pain pulsing through his head.
He listened to his father converse with some of his advisors, glancing up at his mother as she spoke about taking a stroll through the garden later with his brother, the weather being beautiful out.
“Shut up!” Dean said stubbornly, crossing his arms, glaring at the man before him who was laughing hysterically.
Now, Castiel knew very well that wandless magic could remedy the problem. But any kind of slip up of the hand, especially to his crotch area, would end in disaster.
Dean’s hand froze on Castiel’s crotch, blue eyes locking with green as he lapped at the digit, giving it a hard suck. Taking the momentary pause from the man, Castiel brought his hands up to curl them into the lapels of Dean’s suit, receiving a yelp in surprise when Castiel turned the man so that was pressed against the table.
After dismissing his underlings, he looked up the stairwell, excitement swelling in his chest as he climbed the steps two at a time.
I don't know what this is, but I couldn't sleep until I wrote it. It's based on this song: https://youtu.be/gNarAFhOw1I
Lucifer continued talking, Dean forming his plan. Yes, he was trying to get over the fact that the supernatural exists, but like hell, he was gonna sit back and let something happen to his home.
“No need, this one is on the house.” Dean gave her a confused look. “I’m the manager and the owner has noticed how much patronage you’ve put into their business. This is a token of their appreciation.”
Later, he was definitely gonna have to make it up to Cas for yelling at him. But they’ve been dating for a while now. And the guy should know that Dean can’t do his business when someone was talking to him. Maybe a dinner date? Or flowers? Maybe chocolates? A blowjob always solves things.
Dean shook his head at the comment. Everything was supposed to be running smoothly, but there were people resisting his leadership. That comment had Bobby smacking him across the back of the head.
“I’m happy for him then,” Castiel managed out, feeling as if it was becoming harder to breathe. Even though they were outside. The streets were becoming filled with passersby, people and children off to wherever they were going. Glancing at his watch, the hands showed seven forty-five.
Making his way inside the small, poorly lit room lay a single bed pushed into the corner, he sat down and waited for his order. He'd just pulled out his own watch when the doorknob turned. His heartbeat began to race as the door opened. He breathed a sigh of relief when his order arrived.
Dean rose from his seat, letting go of Castiel's wrist in the process and turning towards his trusted servant. Those green eyes looking anywhere but at the man before him.
He couldn’t contain the tears as they fell. This building was his responsibility. His flock. He failed them. All because he couldn’t bring himself to follow a direct order.
“That’s ok. You’ve become quite the regular and consistent with what you get. Unless today is the day you do change it?”
A married couple that was averaging out after a couple of sessions with him, they were just seeking ways to expand their horizon.
And a walk he had. Outside the castle. The knights posted at the gate gave him a look, murmuring to one another as he went.
Castiel was brought back by the feeling of a weak pull of his hand, Dean was trying to pull him into bed.
A hand on his neck snapped Castiel from his thoughts, opening his eyes to see just how close Mr. Winche-Dean had gotten. Enough to where Castiel could close the small gap between them, to make this dream a reality.
He was going to the place and politely decline them all. The thought of four people knowing where he works and not responding to them did not settle well with him.
An image of Castiel flashed through his mind, smiling widely as they splashed in the ocean together. The memory spurring a small sense of guilt of what he’d done to ruin it.
“Wake up,” Castiel called out, unable to do anything to help the man. Dean sat up quickly at his voice, panting as he tried to regain his senses. “Easy, hush now. I heard you scream, so I came running. What's wrong?” he said clearly, his hands up to show he wasn’t going to harm Dean when he flinched away.
"He's new, some big corporate bigwig needing some stress relief," Castiel nodded along in understanding. Those secretly gay types. Probably has that apple pie life with a wife, 2.5 kids, white picket fence and dog to boot.
“His body was found,” he breathed out after chugging the ale. “Burnt to a crisp along the main road,” Everyone gasped in horror. “He looked to have been protecting someone. An elderly couple, by the looks of the two bodies behind ‘em,” the man sobbed out.
“Drop your pants and lay over the armrest,” Castiel told him after regaining his composure. This was only Dean’s second time being dominated. He knows better than to rush as he watched Dean do as he said.
“I’m seeing pretty clearly on my end.” He spoke nonchalantly. Dean could feel the anger slowly broil beneath his skin at his predicament. But he wasn’t going to let that show, instead, he shrugged his shoulders as best as he could in his position. It was a slight movement but Sam noticed, his brow furrowing at the remark.
Hands began to unbutton his shirt, muttering words to soothe that slowly spread throughout his body.
Castiel couldn’t help himself, feeling the man’s throbbing cock as it rubbed against his stomach. He brought a hand up, wrapping his fingers around the thickness as the tip dripped with precum.
“Dean!” he turned at his name, to his brother who was standing at the balcony, fear clear in his eyes.
“I can feel his energy, seeping under the doors and throughout the halls. He’s not aware of his actions. Memories of back then and present are now mixing. I believe it’ll be best if you stay away from him, at least until he's fully aware of who he is.” she added, noticing the dangerous look in the Alpha’s eyes.
He figured there was no one going to call him since his family knew where he was and could easily contact Hannah or Meg if it’s an emergency. He held the power button until the network logo flashed before going blank.
Over his chest, down to his hips, grabbing at his ass before moving to the front to give Dean’s fully erect cock a stroke or two. Precum dripping down the length.
He felt something warm and wet fitting itself against his neck, trailing down to his collar bone and back.
“And why’s that? I’m paralyzed and you could have your way with me if you want. What’s holding you back.”
"The economy was on the verge of collapse. We told them we could help solve this problem by allowing us to feed one night a year."
Time seemed to freeze, the pounding of his heartbeat to the very air he breathed. Castiel gave a small smile, leaning down to place another kiss to Dean’s lips.
His lips were soft, slightly chapped, a hand on his side of his face, ghosting along and down towards his chest.
As he was munching his way through the second half of the sandwich, he noticed that Dean had knocked the plate of bacon. A piece looking like it was about to fall off.
The small gasp from moving, the tightness in his pants rubbing along the cloth, had the man turning his head. Sharp blue eyes glued Dean to the spot, noticing the man’s lips pulling up to reveal sharp canines beneath.
Trailing kisses down to the juncture between his neck and shoulder. He felt him nuzzle the spot, feeling something sharp scrap the skin.
“Oh, you know. When you have nothing to say or to give us, we just make you disappear. That old chestnut.” He reached for the scalpel, a little slice and dice would get better answers when you decided to peel the skin away from the muscle.
“Don’t be blaming my little brother,” Eldon interrupted his corner lip lifting. Swallowing the gasp when he felt the man's hand lightly grazing his cheek, moving lower to grab at his throat, Eldon’s face inches away from his face as he whispered harshly into Castiel’s ear. “Enough.”
The pressure was light as Castiel brought his lips along the man’s neck, dragging his teeth lazily across the skin as he repeated the question. He enjoyed the breathy gasp he received at the display.
Sam watched his brother take off, his heart hammering in his chest as he turned to run out of the room to find his father.
Unfortunately for Dean, it led to Bobby grilling him about what was going on inside that ‘noggin’ of his.
He thought it could have been adrenaline, which is where he found himself almost every morning, training on the sword with the royal army. Pushing himself harder with every parry and thrust.
Piles of Bacon, Boston Lettuce, Fried Green Tomato, Horseradish Cream and an Over Easy Egg Stacked High atop Fresh Thick Cut Challah Bread from what Castiel read after Dean ordered it. With a side of bacon of course.
He somehow woke up one day and everything was just there. Out in the open. Everyone greeted him as if it was a normal day.
He nearly jumped when a low chuckle sounded right next to his ear. Bolting upright, eyes wide open, he looked around the room.
Dean paused for a moment to glance over his shoulder towards the wall where the other man stood on the other side.
Castiel was calming his racing heart, his gaze admiring the man’s physique as he waited for the other to say something else. Eyes drifting upward, taking note of the arrow that was all the way into the green. The farthest it would go.
His Father gave him a long lecture about walking out of such an important meeting and how a king, no matter what ales him, must sit and listen to the entire conversation.
“Would you like me to assist you with that, your highness?” the girl inquired humorously, breaking Dean’s gaze at her body to look down at the problem in question.
He was the last to stand, putting on a charming smile when he walked up the girl. Her cheeks had a tint of red as he leaned in close.
long. Think green eyes would be interested?” Castiel shrugged his shoulders, crouching so he could get a better view of the cleaning supplies. “What about that Sugar Daddy of yours. He must be giving it to you
His hand running along the man's back, slipping a hand under the waistband of his pants, grabbing a handful of that plump ass. Enjoying the moan around his cock that it earned him.
Bringing two hands up, Castiel placing them firmly on Mr. Winchester’s chest, giving a hard push until their lips separated and Dean was staring at him in shock.
Looking at the guy now…and he’s being ridiculous for even thinking this, he looked familiar. Ruffled black hair, stunning blue eyes and that unnecessary tan trench coat he was wearing over a suit of all things.
He had to bite his tongue when he watched the bookshelf shift before jerking upwards. The item moved in tandem with Sam’s hand as it placed itself upright.
“What can I say? You have gentle hands,” Castiel looked down at the man, the tip of the plug already placed at the puckering hole, slowly pushing it in. "Except for that" Dean ground out, head falling back between his arms.
“You should rest,” jumping when he felt a hand on his bare shoulder, he forgot that he was naked. For just a second.
His younger brother had teased him relentlessly about this fake “Love at first sight” ordeal. But he didn’t care. He was 18 and his fiance was all he could think about. They would live happily over at Michael’s village, the trade between the two will grow stronger. The villages merging to become one over time.
Dean ran a hand through his hair, thinking absently that he needed a haircut. The fear of having hair like Sam’s freaked him out.His father, after he was able to recover, had been banned from leaving the castle grounds.
of his finger, scanning the pages. Not thinking about the distant laugh, how it didn’t quite sound like Dean’s, maybe a little higher than the man’s deeper one. How it seemed that over the course of his one semester that Dean was sitting closer. Their hands brushing every now and then when they’d reach for their drinks. Dean’s knee brushing against his leg, the man apologizing. Castiel brushing it off with a small, nervous laugh.
“Castiel? Where are you?!” Dean cried out, the grip disappearing, followed by the rumbling of the rocks around him. The deafening roar of the Dragon was loud with the thunderous boom of his body as it moved about the area above. He followed the sound in time to look up, frozen in fear when he looked up into the face of the Dragon set high above him. It gave out a roar which snapped Dean out of his paralyzed state, ducking for cover as the creature moved around the hole above, trying to reach for its prize.
A marriage set by his grandparents to further strengthen the alliance between the two against a common enemy.
Through the long pleasure (torture) of just his tongue, Cas added a finger then two, all the while lavishing Dean's hole with that sinful tongue.
Why was he so distracted? Castiel shifted his eyes away from the world outside to the lone coffee cup across from him. He was already finished with his own and he distantly wondered if the other coffee was cold by now.
Turning off the water when it reached just below the edge, he sat in silence, head leaning on the ledge as he let his body float there.
Glancing down in time, the Dragon had turned around, to see Michael being tackled by his helmsmen. The spear falling from his grasp. He noticed Gabriel stand, looking in a certain direction with a smile on his face.
"C'mon Cas, you love me," Dean answered, pulling the blankets back just enough to meet Cas' sleepy blues.
Shaking his head, he stood with the book in hand as he read the contents. He just finished the biography about Samuel Campbell, his maternal grandfather, before slamming the book close.
When his vision finally cleared, Dean was able to sit up straighter to take in his surroundings. Bodies. Everywhere. Gouged, bloodied, and scattered across the courtyard. He turned to Meg, surprised to see her with smudges of blood covering her face and clothes.
Castiel remained quiet, eyes flickering between Dean’s and towards the ceiling. Trying to think about anything other than the warmth in his hand when the man nuzzled into his hand.
“My Liege,” a voice interrupted whatever he was going to say, turning his attention to the new arrival standing at the door to the throne room.
“Dean,” his name pulling him from the “finishing” blow to his opponent. The man on the ground with his right arm held by Dean’s left, sword above his head to deliver the final strike. He glanced over his shoulder at the sound.
Those green eyes staring happily up at him after their first encounter. The color took his breath away whenever he was pinned with them. Every time the man spoke directly at him he was rendered speechless.
"The real question is why was he being chased," Sam interrupted. "Ranking 10 and over aren't supposed to be harmed during the Purge,"
“So beautiful,” he heard Dean’s voice praise in awe when Castiel felt the toy slip in easily, taking the length deeper and deeper.
“My my, Four cards? I don’t think I’ve seen that happen in quite some time,” She started while indicating with her hand to come closer.
As he stood there, the dried coffee making itself known on his once-white shirt, now stained brown, the smell more potent than when it was in the cup.
“How can I? I’ve wanted this for so long,” he responded, pulling both his pants and underwear down in one go. “I don’t care what you are regardless,” cupping the man’s face again. “I knew after meeting you that I was going to love you, faults and all,” with that, he leaned in to capture those lips again, pressing forward til Cas was laying on the bed, Dean hovering on top to reach a hand to grasp to man’s hardened cock.
Castiel starred. He’s done this before. Both professionally and to the other men, he’s been with personally. But this was Dean.
He heard Lucifer call out to him, taunting him to come out to play. Dean's adrenaline was pumping, he looking around, discovering a silver blade. One he's never seen before.
The man he was here for was not exactly a regular but he calls often enough that he may just become one.
"Get closer." He demanded. Dean silently obeyed, moving close enough that he could extend a hand to touch it with his fingertips.
The note of sadness at the end caused Dean to look over his shoulder at the man who happened to look up from what he was doing. Their eyes locked. Such an intense gaze.
“Let’s wrap them since we have time,” Castiel commented after Dean placed the boxes on the coffee table.
He heard a sharp gasp before the sound of the rope snapping. Opening his eyes, Dean watched the kite drift off with the wind.
"I don't think I am following you," he watched Dean push his hands into his coat a little deeper as he fidgeted in place.
Was the first bubble to pop up, catching Castiel off guard. Wasn’t he “Speaking” to his character earlier.
“Anyways, if you were kidnapped while you were asleep, how the hell are you wearing a suit under that ugly ass trench coat?”
Surprisingly, Meg was quiet. When he stood, he realized why. In the doorway stood the familiar green-eyed man. He was holding the door open, a man stood on the outside with an umbrella opened above him, now that’s some fancy shit.
Followed by Dean shifting forward to stand between Castiel’s legs to deepen the kiss at the same time Castiel wrapped his arms around his neck.
“Why do you even care? You’re straight and last I checked, you were getting pretty cozy with my coworker.
The crowd screaming in terror as the Dragon descended upon the village as it searched for its prize.
When Dean pulled away he was met with a hand on the back of his neck, pulling him in for a slower, longer, and far more passionate kiss he’s ever felt.
“And what you did to your own brother was much worse,” Castiel retorted, a hand sneaking around Dean’s torso possessively. “But I freed him.” Dean could feel the Alphas lips pressing to his neck followed by the wet feeling of his tongue tracing from the junction in his neck to his ear.
‘Sammy,’ he tried to say, but his mouth felt like it had been stuffed with cotton. The sound of feet hitting the ground made him groan as it irritated his headache.
“We shouldn’t stay here for long,” the third announced, standing up from his spot. He rubbed his hands together to rid the dirt. “We don’t know if the King will send men to retrieve his lost treasure,”
Without a second thought, he tugged open the heavily vaulted door, slipping in quickly and slamming it shut behind him. Spinning the handle to set all the locks in place is when Dean finally let out a breath.
Before Castiel could continue, he noticed a slight movement above Dean’s head. The meter flickered again.
followed by the sound of the door slamming shut. But neither person in the small room was paying attention.
She wasn’t scared of him, knowing she was far too powerful of a witch that could put him in his place if need be. She stood before him with her arms crossed, casual as she took in the vampires disgruntled appearance.
“What do you want, Sam,” His tone neutral, shifting his gaze just off to the right of his brother’s shoulder.
He got to the door right at the third knock, opening it in time to see Castiel's hand still in the air.
Despite his eyes adjusting to the darkness, he could only make out a dresser and a chair sitting next to the bed.
He felt the heat on his back as the Dragon attempted to catch him which spurred him to climb in the direction of the hole across from him.
He’s heard stories. How this song was used to sacrifice the young women of the village during dark times when his village was just starting out.
Sam huffed at Dean’s remark, the man didn’t care for things that couldn’t be explained, ever since they were kids. He was also stubborn and if it didn’t make sense, then he would walk away without listening to reason.
Dean stared at him as he slowly loaded the chamber with a single bullet before spinning it, snapping it shut. The man before him gazed down at the revolver, a sigh escaping his lips, elbow resting lazily on the armrest while lifting the gun aiming the barrel directly at Dean's chest. His eyes didn't rise, instead, he kept them down as he used his other hand to scratch at the gruff of his neck.
Instinct alone had his body moving before his mind was able to comprehend anything. The roar was deafening, the thumps of the massive body shaking the cave as Dean dove into a small alcove in time to miss being swiped by the enormous wings.
Cas stared at him for a second, his eyes squinting a bit as his head cocked to the side. Like he was analyzing Dean.
Usually, he loves the thrill of the fight, the struggle from his prey, but he wasn’t in the mood. Hearing their moan after sinking his fangs did irk him. Just an absent reminder of his mate upstairs.
“Yer Majesty” her accent thick as she gave an overdramatic bow in her dress, hair swept up with clips, away from her face.
“What is he doing, Michael?” Gabriel questioned after catching the man in time before he hit the ground. All eyes turned to Dean who was now looking towards the sky.
Shaking his head, he continued down the hall, stopping once he got to his destination. He had his hand on the handle but was suddenly pushed up against the door, a body firmly pressing against him.
A screech silenced everything around him, the grips on him ceased, causing him to fall to his knees. Huffing in exhaustion fighting so much, and let his head hang as he tried to catch his breath.
Gripping the sheets as Dean continued to toy with him, changing speeds from fast to an agonizingly slow speed that made him whine in the back of his throat, his body pushing back to meet the thrusts faster. He received a smack to his cheek in retaliation.
“C-Cas...I’m sorry-” he was silenced when Castiel raised a hand to silence him. Taking deep breaths to calm himself. Looking around the room, his eyes settling on the two servants standing by the kitchen door on the other side of the room, down a ways from them. Seemingly unaware of what was going on, their gazes unwavering as they stared into space. Acting like they were not even there. As they were trained to be.
It wasn’t until he had unlocked the door when he turned around. Squinting into the night, off in the distance a vague shape could be seen.
“Cas…it’s true. He told me you didn’t deserve to inherit the main branch of the family! That the right was Michael’s by birth.” Panic ringing in his ears as Dean tried to get as much of the information out without fumbling over his words, knowing his chances are narrowing by knowing there’s a 1 out 3 chance the bullet could be next.
“Was there someone who did something to you,” Castiel tried, his mind already expanding on the thought. Their first two sessions were just scratching the surface, gaining trust with one another, and overall a way for Castiel to get a feel for the man.
It wasn't that big but it looked like a storage room for the tables and chairs for the place. Stacks of chairs to one side and three tables, one stacked on top of the other while the latter was free of anything and shoved against the wall.
"Let's talk about the elephant in the room," Dean looked up. Cas or Lucifer wasn't looking at him. Instead, he was looking at the people who brought him up.
“Castiel,” the voice catching the man off guard. He blinked up to find his brother Michael glaring at him.
Their crops were burned and homes destroyed when they refused. A young maiden was brave enough to place herself before the creature with the song she sang to lure it away.
Removing the gloves, turning them inside out, he walked into the attached bathroom to dispose of them into the trash. When he walked out, Dean was completely stretched out flat on his bed, his head buried into his pillow.
“Why is it ‘good-ish’,” Castiel asked while standing from his desk chair to walk across the room to sit in his seat in front of Dean.
