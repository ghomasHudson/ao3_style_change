His breath hitched, and he had to grab onto Dean's arms because that felt so good, he was about to double over.
Cas gasped when Dean thumbed his slit roughly, dick twitching and jumping in Dean's far too skilled hand/
"You mean, your first time doing... anything?" He asked, unbelieving. When Cas nodded, he just scoffed. "You guys have been inseparable since birth," Cas rolled his eyes at the exaggeration, "I thought you guys had been doing it since you decided to make it official. Sorry to burst your bubble, but mom and dad think so too."
And soon enough, they were in Dean's car, driving to his place. Dean had insisted on Cas staying the night and Cas was hopeless to do anything but agree when it came to Dean.
His alpha wanted to just nuzzle up to the omega's scent gland, mark him as his. But Dean wasn't a knothead, and even if he was, scenting is an intimate act that should really be consented to. He certainly wouldn't want some strange omega getting all cozy with his scent gland.
Cas signed with passion; purpose. And Gabriel idly wondered if he’d ever love someone half as much as Cas loves Dean.
The rumor that pissed him off the most, though, was that Cas was faking being a mute. Dean has known the boy since the eighth grade after he skipped sixth and seventh grade, joining Dean’s algebra and English class. All of these years later, Dean has never seen or heard Cas speak.
Dean slowly maneuvered Cas -who went along without protest- so his head was in Dean's lap, eyes focused on his face.
Cas blushed, looking at the floor. Did Dean really see that when he looked at Cas? How could anyone see anything besides a weird nerd?
It was so loud he was surprised the lockers weren't shaking with it, and that his ears weren't sore.
? It's not like he's ever kissed anyone before. He didn't know the mechanics of it, and without any prior warning, he didn't have time to research and prepare.
“Okay,” he whispers because there’s still tears dripping down his face and his voice won’t hold. “Okay.”
“No offense, Cas, I know you believe in the system and all, but I don’t think a restraining order is going to do jackshit against her.”
“I’ll be right here, Dean. Literally. I’ll be no more than ten steps away.” Cas squeezes his arm for a moment. “You can do this.”
Cas doesn’t react to the breaking up part and it’s an out and Dean knows it. But he’s already gotten over himself and asked so he might as well get an actual answer. “Alright,” he amends, “so you’re drunk texting me frikkin’ bees as an intro to breaking up with me? What the hell, man?”
Castiel looks at him thoughtfully for a moment, then he shrugs. “I promise nothing. For the kittens, anyway. I’ll try to keep Dean from a repeat performance.”
“Means I’m playing for both teams, in case you’re not up to speed on terminology. What with you not being around diversity much and all.”
Castiel swiftly moves over to the driver side and starts the car. Once they’re out of the alley and on the relatively brighter main road, Dean can make out Castiel’s features a little better. He’s not really looked him over apart from noticing the expensive clothes. Well, expensive in comparison to what Dean tends to wear. But the little spark in his stomach that the authority in Cas’ voice lit makes him take a second look at the guy helping him out.
Charlie listens to them bitch at each other for all of three minutes before she takes over, dragging them bodily over to her own car and ending the argument by climbing into the driver’s seat. Dean huffs an annoyed breath and gets in behind her, so that he can at least sulk and be anxious in peace.
“Yeah, Cas, I know,” Sam pats the angel on the arm awkwardly. “But I’m sure you two can figure it out.” He hopes like hell they can, anyway, because living in the bunker with the permanent tension between these two has become impossible. “I’ll hit the books and send you anything relevant, okay?”
“I’m sorry,” Cas apologizes again. “There will also be documents showing that you’ve tried to follow the trail and find the killer. You’ll need to touch them before I take them home to ‘find them’. Your fingerprints need to be on them. I thought it better to warn you.”
Cas carefully takes one of them from the carton. “It seems very delicate,” he wonders while he turns it in his hand.
But even a limited choice is still a choice. And if the only thing he could control was that his mother didn’t get the chance to hurt someone else he loved, then so be it. He’d take that bit of control and run with it. It had been too late for him anyway. He’d already been broken.
From this close, Dean can see that he’s wearing a suit and a trench coat. Rich, then. And not a mugger. That’s good. He feels relieved until the man’s words catch up to him. “Ambulance? No way, man, don’t!” It comes out more frantic than he intends.
There’s a moment of silence, no one sure how to follow this up. Bucky himself stares at Steve like he can’t believe a word he’s just heard.
“If I murder you, that will hardly become an issue, will it? And now get in the car.” Despite the bossy tone, Castiel’s hands are gentle when they help Dean fold himself into the passenger seat. And damn him if Dean’s breath doesn’t hitch at the combination of authority and gentle hands, whether he’s still in pain or not.
“I don’t fulfill the conditions to be a Guardian. You’ve said it yourself, I know nothing about love and soulmates.”
“Uhh,” Dean is at a loss of what to say. The only thing he knows is that this is getting uncomfortably close.
Dean stares into the fire as he eats, chewing slowly and without tasting any of his food, Cas would bet.
“Yes, Dean,” Cas answers, drawing out the answer like he’s already exasperated by this whole deal. “I think them nice. It was very considerate of Steve to bring us lemonade.”
Dean’s known that Cas doesn’t always trust himself. That he keeps a tight leash on his emotions. He hadn’t known any of this.
“Loyal sidekick, that’s me,” Bucky grins and ignores Steve’s immediate protests. “Nice meeting you.” He holds out his hand.
The head tilt disappears as Cas’ smile grows the longer Dean is talking about pie, and well, yes, Dean has thought a lot about pie over the years, sue him. He breaks off with a frown because really Cas shouldn’t be making fun of him for what is a brilliant idea.
“Well…” And suddenly Dean’s not all that opposed to going back to the topic at hand. “So, what do I do now? About angelheart I mean.”
But then, assuming everything goes right, that won’t always be the case. They’ll start a new life and they’ll start it together. And they’ve both said that they want to give this a shot. So Dean owes Cas an actual answer.
That’s all they need in input from Dean so he tunes them out and instead tries to get the shaking under control. He hates this. Hates the panic attacks. He’s useless when they happen. Can’t defend himself, can’t listen to orders, can’t make things right.
So Steve stretches so that he can put a hand on Bucky’s knee. “Hey,” he says quietly. “Don’t. Till the end of the line, remember?”
Cas averts his eyes. “Some Alphas like it,” he whispers. “To have their Omega cry at their hand and still have them come back begging for more because their need is so strong and that Alpha is the only option they have.”
“What do you say, Cas? Let’s make a big breakfast as gallows’ meal? Cause I doubt that I’ll be able to keep anything down tonight.”
“Cause that would be another thing that’s not cool, you know? Coming back into her life just to disappear again. All she’s gonna show you is how tough she is. And it’s not a lie. Claire is
"I mean... yeah..." Cas looked down, rubbing the back of his neck, trying to stave off yet another blush. Seriously, this was bullshit. "No one's really piqued my interest, unless you count Ryan Reynolds."
"You and me both." He said, and Cas smiled widely, feeling like he was doing good, and he silently preened under that smile.
He reminded himself, looking back at the clothes and taking a deep breath. He could do this. Clothes would not get the best of him.
did not. That's what you get for keeping secrets from me!" Cas just rolled his eyes, but the wide grin on his face was speaking for him.
Cas didn't know, he was barely paying attention. He was sitting in Dean's lap, with Dean's arms around his waist, and he couldn't help but squirming a little, which in turn made Dean's dick twitch in his pants.
Unlike himself, Sam was happy to be up early, so Dean wasn't worried about him as he quickly dressed before going down to make them breakfast. Mom was still sleeping off her night shift, and dad had left an hour ago, so food was up to him. At least in most mornings.
This sweet, gorgeous omega who's been through so much shit, but is still here and able to smile. He was so quickly falling in love with the boy, and though he knew Cas might not ever feel the same, he was still so happy when around him. He just wanted to be with the omega 24/7, which gave him a
"So goddamn needy, too." Dean tsked, and Cas felt his face flush a darker shade of red, but he just nodded, trying to pull Dean closer.
“Well… what about sweetheart?” He asked, trying not to tear up. Alistair was always like this. Castiel knows the only reason they’re together is because he looks like Jimmy.
Dean got the door unlocked, opening it for Cas to go in first. And as soon as he did, his knees buckled, and he felt like he was going to be sick.
Gods help him, Dean was perfect and Cas wanted him so much. He nodded enthusiastically, earning a chuckle from Dean that did
So Castiel was left sitting in the bleachers, full of nervous energy. He still wasn't completely convinced that he hadn't just dreamed it all, couldn't believe Dean actually liked him.
When he looked back up, his eyes landed on Dean, and Dean actually started laughing when his face immediately turned a bright red.
The crowd was loud as they cheered, but Cas really couldn't say much, because he was probably the loudest in the crowd as he screamed and clapped for Dean.
He learned that Dean’s family did indeed come, they just didn’t stay to wait for him to change. He preferred to take his baby -Cas smiled when he heard Dean’s fond nickname of the car- anyway, and Sam -Cas loved the proud tone in Dean’s voice whenever he talked about his brother- always said that Dean was ‘as slow as a girl’. Cas wasn’t sure he knew what that meant.
Once the other alpha was out of sight, Dean cursed under his breath and made his way over to the frightened omega.
Dean's breath hitched, and then he was wrapping his arms around the omega, pulling him closer before holding on tight. Cas sighed, eyes closing. Yet they soon snapped open when he heard a noise and
Dean noticed him first, and he automatically stood up, making his way over before stopping himself, clearly unsure if he could.
Just like the rest of him, it was absolutely perfect. The shaft was thick and flushed a pretty red, a vein on the bottom that bulged out and Cas just wanted to lick at it. His head was on full display, foreskin rolled down in arousal. It was an angry purple that glistened due to copious amounts of precum.
"I, uh, had a few. What do you think about the domestication of dogs? We could do our project on how that process happened, comparing old age dogs to the ones we keep as pets today," Dean knew he had an awe-struck look on his face, which in turn caused Cas to fidget and avert his eyes.
"The best I ever have," And then he was pulling Cas onto his chest, and Cas was content to just lay there with him.
His nose was just acting up. It was the only logical explanation for why he suddenly felt warm and protected.
Dean's breath hitched, but he didn't address Cas. With a grin, the teen moved so he was straddling Dean.
Dean eventually slipped Cas' shirt off, looking at him with a heated gaze, never breaking eye contact as he leaned down to tongue and suck at Cas' nipples. Cas' breath caught in his throat from the absolute love that burned in Dean's eyes paired up with the corporeal feeling on his chest, and Cas really never even stood a chance. Dean has ruined him for anyone else. And Cas wouldn't have it any other way.
It wasn’t a life-changing realisation like portrayed in books and movies. In fact, Castiel was sure he, on some level, already knew.
"You're so damn beautiful, Cas. I'm so in awe of you," He mumbled against Cas' skin, breath tickling him slightly, and Castiel absolutely loved the contrast in the two sensations, throwing his head back and letting slip a drawn-out moan. Dean knew the best ways to get Cas to sing for him.
But as nervous as he looked -and sounded- his candy apple green eyes betrayed him, looking bright and eager as Dean patiently waited for a response.
He was surprised when they were already pulling into Dean's driveway, which led to a nice, suburban-looking house. It wasn't small, but it wasn't overly big either.
"You're a bully. Can't believe my first date is with someone so mean." That caused Dean to sober quickly, and Cas was confused with the sudden change in emotion.
Castiel's sense and logic started to come back soon after he was in his room, the comforting voice of his father and the soft touch of his mother pulling him back from the harsh grip of his memories.
Ever since Cas had told Dean about his past experiences a little over two weeks ago, Dean has been trying to act as non-threatening as possible.
"Not yet. I have more self-control than that," Dean teased, and if Cas wasn't still riding his high, he would have scowled at that. "Later. We have to get you to class. Don't want to miss the entire thing, do you?"
So, if Dean was just going to use him, why not get something out of it? Such as finally talking about how he felt.
"All right, where's your brother?" Dean asked, voice raised slightly so he would be heard over the smooth purr of the beast beneath them.
He had just gotten the potatoes out when the doorbell rang. Quickly throwing his apron and oven mitts to the side, he made his way to the front door, opening it with a slight blush.
And then Dean was pushing their erections together, and Cas felt a surge of want so strong pass through him, he would have collapsed into a gooey mess on the floor if Dean weren't holding him up.
Clearing his throat, he tried again. "I was thirteen and he, the alpha, was sixteen, lived next door. He would start sneaking into my bedroom and he- he-" He had to take a moment before forcing the words, "He did stuff to me." Out in one big breath.
speak.” Alistair glared at him, eyes filled with pure hatred as a slow grin formed on his face. Cas looked away, tears stung at his eyes and blurred his vision.
"So beautiful, sweetheart. Can't believe you're giving this to me. Can't believe you're letting me do this." God, Dean sounded so awed and Cas wanted to cry from the overwhelming love he felt for this man.
with him on his bedroom floor, held his hand when he was nervous, tried to do everything possible to make him feel comfortable. And not once did he try to make Cas feel like his omega status made him willing to advances. He told him the exact opposite, in fact. Told him he deserved to be loved, deserved to be happy, didn't deserve being taken advantage of.
I'm bad at responding to you guys, but I read all of your comments (usually more than once) and they never fail to make me smile! So, if you please, go ahead and leave me a comment, I cherish them. And who knows, maybe one day I'll finally know what to respond with!!
Dean always fantasized about what Cas’ voice sounded like, but he would still be happy with Cas even if he never got to hear him speak.
Last year some guy in homeroom had been convinced that Cas had been staring at him and spread a rumor that Cas was gay. While that statement was the truth, he wasn’t ready to come out. To this day, he still hasn’t confirmed the rumor. The thing that pissed him off the most though, was the fact that Cas hadn’t been staring at the douche. He was just spaced out.
"Make sure to get your homework done, Sam. Don't just mess around." Okay, it wasn't necessary to tell
"How about music? What kind of music do you like? For me, it's classic rock all the way. Nothing compares to some Metallica and Led Zeppelin."
"Yes, please, that. Do that." He pleaded breathlessly, and Dean let out this sexy chuckle that had a shudder racking its way through Cas' body.
"Dean, please," Cas' head was thrown back, eyes squeezed shut. He had no idea what he was begging for, only knew he needed it desperately.
After getting over his initial shock, Cas texted his mom about spending the weekend with the Winchesters. Anna ultimately said yes, obviously happy Castiel had a friend he could spend time with. As sad as it was, that was rare.
"Hmm, that does sound like an amazing boyfriend," Cas hummed, leaning up to kiss Dean before shutting off his car and getting out.
"What d'you want, Gabe?" He asked, slightly out of breath from the arousal that was still thrumming under his skin in anticipation, even through the humiliation he felt.
He jumped, yelping a bit when there was a knock on his car window. Looking up revealed Dean, leaning down with a confused smile on his face.
baby, you're first and foremost, of course." Dean said with an easy smile when they reached a beauty of a car. Cas felt warmth spread through him as his stomach fluttered. He was Dean's baby. He was
type way, but I noticed you. More importantly, I noticed you noticing me. And I thought that I might have a chance, and then I saw you start coming to practices and I just waited for the perfect opportunity to have you."
Gabriel came running, but Sam was nowhere to be found. Rolling his eyes, Dean turned off the car. "Gimme a minute, Cas. Gotta find my pain in the ass little brother."
He gasped when Dean used a finger to lift his head, smiling way too adorably. "Come back. I miss you." And then Dean kissed his forehead before walking away, and Cas was convinced he actually had died.
He and Charlie waited until everyone left before daring to come out of their hiding spot, walking towards Charlie's small car.
Dean wanted to talk to him, start some kind of conversation, but what would he even say? Anything he had sounded creepy, pervy, or both.
Dean finally calmed down, wiping tears from his eyes, which Cas thought was an over-exaggeration, but cute nonetheless.
Even if telling Dean didn't mean anything and may be turned against him, he needed someone else to know.
But if Dean were trying to manipulate Cas, get Cas to willingly let Dean use him, he would have already acted on it, right?
"W-well-" Cas cut himself off with a moan, "I wanted you to say yes," He grinned, though it soon turned into a face of pleasure.
Dean was the one to finally break the silence, pulling Cas into him as he said, "We're definitely doing this again. But maybe next time we should use a bed. And not have Benedict watching."
Cas beamed, standing up to the pull his slightly taller brother into a big hug. “Hi, Jimmy.” He mumbled into his shoulder. He could practically feel Alistair’s jealous glare on the back of his neck.
"Okay, okay, I'm sorry. It's not very gentlemanly of me to make you blush so much, is it? Even if you are far too adorable with brightly coloured cheeks highlighting those perfect eyes and that perfect face." Dean smirked, knowing exactly what he was doing to the boy.
Castiel slowly slid down to the floor, eyes still watery. He roughly wiped them away with the back of his hand, chest tightening as he felt the throbbing bruise on his back. He picked his glasses off the floor, wiping them off before putting them back on his face. He knew as soon as Gabriel -his adopted brother- found out, he’d be pissed.
"Well, well, well, looks like I just walked into a porno," He said cheerfully, and Cas let out an inhuman screech, bucking so hard he threw Dean right off the bed. His poor boyfriend fell on the floor with a loud thump, followed by a pained groan.
"You gonna tell your little boyfriend about your new alpha status?" He teased as he ate his own food at a more reasonable pace.
Without thinking about it, he tilted his head, exposing his neck and shivering when a pair of lips traveled against the length of it.
Dean was bright red, though, and he didn't look like he was ready to jump Cas' bones, so maybe this was okay?
"Get to class before I keep you here forever." And as much as Cas wanted that, he seriously needed to leave. So, he stepped on his tippy-toes and pressed a shy kiss to Dean's cheek before unlocking the door and heading to class.
He shoved it down, because he's never done that before, and didn't totally feel safe anyway. He had to still be on guard because any moment could be the moment Dean drops the charade.
‘He’s a popular jock and I’m just a low-life nerd. Plus, I don’t even know if he likes guys. And with all of the rumours going around, I really don’t see why he’d want to date me.’
Halfway through lunch, Amelia had to leave after she got a call from work. And then Alistair basically ignored him to talk to Jimmy.
Castiel was extraordinarily happy the rest of the day, so much so, Charlie started pestering him about what was up.
voice, rolling his eyes. Jo stuck her tongue out before walking away, leaving Dean and Cas alone once more, except this time, without the shield of a menu, Cas felt awkward.
"You told me to come here...?" Cas was confused, but he got the sense that he had said something weird when Dean looked at him in amusement.
Hey, guys!! Back again with another update. I've unofficially kinda made Wednesdays my updating days, but I was gone for so long that I figured you guys deserve this surprise chapter! My other project is finished and updated if you guys wanna go give it some love. As always, warnings at the bottom
Dean, of course, knew about all the rumors spread about Cas. The most well-known one was that Castiel was ay. Dean could only hope that it was true. Crushing on a straight guy was always heartbreaking. But even if it is or is not true, Dean is pretty pissed at people for starting the rumors in the first place. It wouldn’t take a genius to look at Cas and notice they bother him.
So, after they finished, he figured he could just sit in peace, no longer having to socialise with him.
"You gonna cum?" Dean asked, like the mind reader he was. When Cas could do nothing but nod, gripping Dean's back tightly, his boyfriend grinned.
"What, I can't just be happy?" Cas asked, food untouched beside him as he stared at Dean, who was across the room and laughing at something one of his friends said. Gods, he was so gorgeous it physically hurt. He finally understood what Taylor Swift meant.
I wrote most of this at work lmao, I hoped you enjoyed! Who knows, maybe soon they'll be together and it'll be a different kind of slow burn, if you know what I mean *wink wonk*
“Meaning that I tried to back-up some of this code to analyze it later, but they did a complete sweep. I lost all the info. Fuck.”
It’s not because he wants to see Cas. Not because he wants to get hugged hello. No, it’s just because the area Cas lives in isn’t the safest. Yeah, that’s it. Right. His phone chimes with the answering text.
“Her name is Charlie. I think the two of you will get along. I’ll ask her about taking you on when I see her at work today. I have the day off tomorrow, so if she has a free spot then, I can introduce you.”
“Personal opinion? Start by acknowledging he existed. Tell your mystery man about him. Write it on a postcard if you have to. But let Gabe be a part of your life. He deserves to be.“
Cas doesn’t say anything, just gently digs his fingers into the tight muscles of Dean’s neck. It helps. Dean doesn’t really want to admit it, not even to himself, because anything that helps is also dangerous. Anything that helps is something that he’s going to miss when he doesn’t have it anymore. Providing he’s still alive to miss it. Without permission, a giggle makes it out of his mouth. They’re gonna kill him. That’s the best plan they could come up with. Killing him. It’s so absurd it seems funny.
Cas smiles at the thought even though he doesn’t look forward to that time of year. He smiles because Dean knows that the furs are the ones that Cas found in his chest up in Angels’ Nest, but he doesn’t know that the vest that they will be made into will be a gift for him. It might be a small way in which Cas can help to keep Dean safe, but it is still something he can do for Dean and he looks forward to it.
Someone is clearing their throat loudly behind them and when Steve turns, he’s looking into three faces with similar expressions of displeasure.
“Cas, I - I won’t lie. I look at you sometimes and - like when I cooked you dinner and you wore those jeans and you looked like -,” that dinner already feels like an eternity ago but he can still feel himself blush when he thinks the words
“Thanks, Charlie,” Dean nods and picks up Kaz’ reins from the ground. It doesn’t take more than one well-practiced motion and Dean is in the saddle as well. “Off we go.” Dean clicks his tongue and both horses fall into a leisurely pace.
Bucky looks at him confused. “No, it’s fine.” He experimentally sits down on the bed. “This feels right.”
Because deep down, he knows it’s better this way. He’s got his Dad as an example of what happens when a bottle of Jack is your best friend. And cigarette smoke tastes vile, he can’t really deny that, even if he gave that one up for Cas and right now he’s in the mood to be stubborn about anything that Cas brought into his life.
Slowly, he drags himself into the kitchen, but he stops before he actually enters. Because Cas is sitting at the table, a cup of coffee in front of him and reading the newspaper while he hums - wait - is this Highway to Hell? Dean can’t help smiling, even though the sadness tugs immediately at his heart again, too. Because the last time someone was humming in a suburban kitchen when he woke up, it was Lisa. It was Lisa and he’d woken up in their bed and not on the couch. And yet this, including his aching joints and Cas’ ridiculous bedhead, this feels more solid than that life had ever felt. This feels like he belongs in this picture. Something he’d never felt with Lisa.
Cas is no help, either, he just watches from the armchair that he’s currently occupying. Keeping himself neatly out of reach until Dean makes good on his promise and tells Sam about them.
“Oh, that’s okay then,” Dean says and feels somewhat silly that that is all he’s got to say to this. He’s just agreed to go home with a stranger, after all. Not that that isn’t something that he does every so often. But usually it’s with a girl. And he picks them up at the bar and there’s at least someone who knows who he is with. “Mind if I use your phone to text Jo where I am? That’s my little sister. The one who the guys were bothering. Just so she doesn’t worry in the morning.”
“Good,” Dean answers gruffly, opting to acknowledge his emotions and then fleeing before they can become overwhelming. “I’m gonna go change. I’ll be right back.”
And he’d been right. Because Cas wasn’t dead. Because Cas had lost his memories. And came back to Dean when he regained them. Only this time, Cas’ memories were intact. This time, his memories showed him the same thing that every nightmare showed Dean. An angel-blade sparkling in Dean’s hand. A kill that had been avoided by a hand-span.
“Uh, I’ll just,” he waves vaguely and retreats back into the safety of the house. Into the safety of the bedroom, actually, because he’s got a door he can close behind him there.
“You got a pretty big bed.” Dean sits down on one side of the bed and looks over the expense of sheets and blankets. “I don’t need it to be all mine.”
“No, as a matter of fact, it is not,” Cas shakes his head and comes close enough to put a hand on Dean’s arm. Dean lets him, too. “Shit happens, Dean.”
“Uhh,” the guy looks down at himself as if it’s the first time he’s even noticed that he’s still wearing a pair of slacks and a white button-up. Well, it had been white at one point. He sighs. “I don’t think I have a good explanation for this. I was distracted.”
He lets the sentence stand and Cas has no idea what to answer. Seems to him that it isn’t a particularly great piece of luck to meet someone you like and then have them commit suicide not even half a year later.
“Oh, come on, Dean, don’t be like that. Also, I am pretty sure that if one of your neighbors was an Incubus or Siren, Cas would have picked up on it,” Sam gives in.
It takes hours for Dean to fall asleep. Disadvantages to actually having your own bed. With memory foam. Couches don’t do the trick anymore. Or maybe he is just getting old. Of course than it might also be that his mind keeps going in circles, repeating everything that has happened today. They’ve made no fucking progress on the case at all but instead his mind keeps bringing up the way Cas’ hand had felt in his, all warm and firm and
He’s clutzier than usual, his nerves getting to him and his hands not steady. “Sorry,” he apologizes though he doesn’t look at Charlie. “Do you want something to drink?”
“I’m not yours. And I never will be. I want an Unsealing!” He shouts it at her because that’s the only way his voice will cooperate.
Cas shakes his head in one decisive shake. His mouth is tight when he says. “No, Dean. I’m saying that you’re beautiful.”
“Dean, it’s not – it’s not that simple. You bring me food. You do simple tasks for me. You’re helping me with everything!” Cas accuses, because even someone as stubborn as Dean must see how insane that will look to the outside world. Even their own pack is a little leery, judging by the way they have started doing their own dishes again, refusing Cas’ attempts to try to do the task once they noticed that there was a risk Dean would be the one actually doing the cleaning.
He breathes a silent sigh of relief when Cas’ arm comes up around him, drawing him closer. Seems like his Jinn dream is still going well.
That makes Cas smile again, if only a little. “You have a very unique way of showing affection to each other.”
Cas jumps like he’s only noticed it now that he’d still been holding on to Dean. Gabriel cackles while Cas quickly folds his hands in his own lap. Charlie looks even more thoughtful than before.
He shoves his way through the tight assembly of humans and wagons, for once not caring that he isn’t gentle. That he is drawing attention. But then he doesn’t know where to go. There is no place to be alone in a pack like this, not when they’re on the move. And he can’t fall back, he knows that, too.
There’s a lot of blushing going on then, and if Dean wasn’t still so uncomfortable from the call with Sam, he’d be smirking as well. As it is, he nods curtly. “I’m sorry we’ll have to cut this short, but we got to get back.” He really is sorry, too, if mainly because they haven’t found a single piece of useful information. He’s not even had a chance to excuse himself to go to the bathroom and maybe check out that notebook in the living-room. But it’s too late now.
is still not a word he likes to think about himself, even though it’s kind of started to sink in that Charlie might have had a point when she pointed it out. And if he’s honest with himself, it’s not like the thought that he might end up like Anna - killed by his own soulmate - hadn’t come up when he’d tried to imagine a future with Amara.
There’s nothing Dean can do. He can’t say No to this. Not without spawning a barrage of questions. “Yes, Sammy. Course. Nothing I would want more than to morally compromise your offspring.”
“Dean.” And just like that Cas is in his space again, catching his sleeve and holding onto it. “Please don’t do this, Dean.”
“Cas,” Dean takes his hands. He won’t have much time before Amara will miss him and come looking for him. “Remember what I told you about Sammy and me? About when we were kids?”
She doesn’t ask him whether that sounds like a good plan. She doesn’t need to. He’s got no idea how she is doing it but he is keenly aware that she already knows what’s in his heart. That he’ll do what she says.
“About everything.” Cas suddenly looks very small. “About church. About God. Even about the military and what it means to fight for our country. Nothing made sense to me anymore. I tried to talk to my wife and she sent me to our priest, but…” He shakes his head. “It didn’t help. All the answers they had was to believe that their way was the right way. And I couldn’t.”
“I lost my faith back then. Both in the law and in the universe,” Cas whispers. “And I’ve spent all the years since trying to atone for my failure.”
Dean’s face heats up and he’s glad that the ping of the microwave saves him from having to explain himself. Because yeah, that was kind of what he had wanted to know. “And they - they don’t feel like, like it’s less than what they have with you?” He talks to the microwave because there’s no way he’s going to get these words out while looking at Charlie.
“You, too, Cas.” Dean wiggles a little more, maximising the warmth spreading through him, and when he closes his eyes, the exhaustion of the emotional day hits him like a freight train and it’s surprisingly easy to fall asleep.
Sam laughs a little self-consciously, because yeah, on the surface it makes no sense at all that dorky Angel of the Lord Castiel should be the one who’s better at human interaction, but the point stands. “Dean’s good with playing a role for a day, be it the efficient FBI agent or the friendly counselor. But he ain’t good at relationships. You got to help him with that, Cas.”
He nods back at them but he hardens his face, makes sure that he looks aloof and unapproachable. He doesn’t want to spill his story. Not to strangers, not to friends. Not to himself, either, if he’s totally honest with himself. There is a reason why Dean isn’t even aware that Cas has a brother.
“So you don’t want to be around me at all,” Dean deducts, voice flat, heart sinking somewhere towards the floor.
"I'm not - exactly military anymore. But it is much easier to find a job in the vicinity of what you know how to do."
given Cas the money for an out-of-state college. Where she couldn’t control what he was doing - or more to the point, who he was doing. He guesses it’s the most remorse anyone had ever gotten from her.
Steve sends him a hard look, but then he suddenly blushes and runs a hand through his hair. “Gosh, look at us,” he chuckles self-consciously, “not even wanting to let them out of our sight for a few minutes, when they’re both warriors. It’s a bit ridiculous really.”
“That is not what I meant,“ Hannah shakes her head and starts over. “Look, you were my best friend and you vanished. I’m glad to see you but it would be nice to hear your story. The whole story. If you want to tell me about it, that is.“
“Yeah… Our bed is - kingsized? I think. It’s pretty big,” Dean says and tries to desperately remember whether someone has ever mentioned that.
“We can at least get something out of them before Sam gets here,” Dean adds impatiently. “Come on, Cas.”
Steve’s carrying the stack of empty glasses and Bucky’s carrying the tray. This way they don’t have to balance anything and they don’t have to let go of each other, either. Until they get to their porch that is, where Steve wants to free himself from Bucky’s hold to dig for his keys.
“You didn’t fight back, Cas. When I tried to kill you, you didn’t fight back,” Dean answers bluntly.
“Oh Dean…” Her gaze is bordering on pity again before she suddenly chuckles. “I’d say you’re whipped but… you know… he’d have to be physically here for that...”
It’s a thought that Dean has had before. Which is why he has to know. “Cas,” Dean asks hesitantly, “this, us, is that atonement, too?”
That had shut up both the woman and Cas. Long enough for Dean to drag Cas away anyway, before he had freed himself from Dean’s grasp with an indignant huff and said death glare.
“You’re safe now, Dean, you’re safe,” Cas murmurs against Dean’s lips and Dean nods, because yes, he feels safe buried under Cas’ body.
He can’t let that happen. He can’t allow his judgement to be clouded by want. By hope. Maybe they’d have had a chance, had Amara not shown up. Or maybe, they’d never have found the courage to talk about any of this and would have stayed friends forever. Dean would be okay with that, really. With anything that doesn’t make him end up in a life of which Cas is not a part.
Dean rubs a hand over his face. “I still don’t know what exactly happened. But I guess we should prepare for Sam.
“You knew each other before, though. We never did. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I believe in fighting for what’s right. In kicking the monsters in the ass. But sometimes, sometimes I wish… Never mind,” Dean shakes his head. He’s got no idea why he’s telling Steve all of this anyway. Must be that goddamn trustworthy face.
Rowena’s expression borders on pity when she looks at Cas. “You didn’t think this completely through dear, did you?”
“I’m clean, though,” Dean goes on because that’s the second thing that comes to mind. “Not dirt-wise, obviously, but, you know, health-wise.” Because he’s reasonably sure you’re not supposed to touch someone who’s bleeding without gloves.
“It’s not,” Dean shakes his head. “Or it wasn’t. Believe me, I’ve almost lost Sam more times than I can count.”
And okay, in terms of wheedling information out of Cas, that is probably anything but subtle. Cas seems to actually think about it for a moment, though, because he does the head tilt before he answers. “Well, if you must know, I find Chris Evans quite aesthetically pleasing.”
“Yeah, that would be us,” the other redhead pipes up from where she’s patiently been waiting at the door with Steve and Bucky. “Hi. You can still call me Natasha, no need to call me agent,” she smirks.
So when it breaks, he puts his forehead against Cas’, not ready to let go completely. “Okay?” he asks quietly.
And okay, that feels like they’ve stumbled onto a private conversation, and Dean’s got to avert his eyes because the two are looking at each other with such concern and softness that it makes him want to puke. Or possibly makes him extremely jealous. Either or.
“Sam,” the tall guy nods, “and I mean the whole two guys moving in together thing. Still a bit of a novelty in suburbia, isn’t it?”
“Well, maybe not. But Bobby’s wife died, with all the consequences you’d expect. And the people we are going to now, the people we are going to ask for shelter through the winter – they were Bobby’s friends.”
Cas’ eyes flicker up to Dean’s. They stay there for a long moment, like Cas is weighing carefully what he wants to say. “I’m real, Dean,” is what he finally settles on. “This is real.”
He nods at Bucky, Bucky nods back, and easy as that they understand each other. They have muscle memory for this as well, for creeping through shadowy hallways in the middle of the night, not knowing what or who awaits them on the other side.
It feels like a private moment, so Steve averts his eyes. And looks right into Bucky looking up at him. Bucky’s got his lower lip caught between his teeth, absentmindedly chewing on it. Steve can’t help that his eyes are drawn to it before they flicker back up to meet Bucky’s eyes.
Cas tilts his head at him, and yeah, there really isn’t much to be seen on the property, all Dean wants is to get out of earshot of the others.
They both clear their throats awkwardly, thoughts apparently going to the same place, but neither of them wanting to admit it.
“But ready for what, Dean? Why are you doing this?” Cas asks and it is as honest a question as he’s ever asked. Dean’s already got him, what is he
Dean thinks his heart might beat right out of his chest. “Yeah, Cas. Definitely. Something more definitely means that.”
Nat watches him silently and slightly disapprovingly for a moment, then she shrugs. “Well, you would’ve been on the bottom of the ocean still, so I guess you might be forgiven for not knowing that there was an apocalypse centered around them. It was quite the buzz. Not SHIELD’s proudest moment.”
“One day you won’t,” Cas says. There’s still no particular inflection, like Cas has already resigned himself to the fact.
Especially not since the blonde guy immediately takes him up on it. “That’s a great idea,” he nods. “We’d love to come by.”
“But you’ve been hurt. The obvious choice is to call an ambulance so that you can get checked out at the hospital.”
Which yeah, Dean had meant it, and he also hadn’t. He’d been drunk and his Dad’s voice had been louder than his own. And yeah, he can’t guarantee that that won’t happen again. He’s trying, though. Noticeable if by nothing else then by how he’s nursing his coke and not even freaking out about Charlie figuring it out.
“She’s not on board. Amara. My soulmate.” Dean scrunches up his face. Even saying it feels wrong. Like a stain on his soul that won’t come off no matter how hard he scrubs at it.
“Hey! Take some stuff inside!” Dean shouts after them before turning back to Cas. “So, this is Singer Auto Salvage. Looks like a junkyard, pretty much is one. ‘S also the only place that Sam and I ever sort of called home. After the age of four, anyway.”
“I gotta get some air. I’ll be back.” He stands up abruptly, snatching his coke bottle from the table because it’s at least something to hold on to, seeing how he’s given up on all his vices. For a moment, he resents Cas for that, then his Dad, then himself. Then he lets it go.
“What are you doing here, Nat?” Steve asks, because yeah, he’s been missing her, but he’s also kind of decided to get them away from the Avengers’ Tower for a reason.
“Puppies, mostly. About how Sam wants one but it’s difficult to fit into our schedules. She knows this breeder, who also runs a doggie daycare, and…”
The only one who knows he won’t call back is - He sighs. At least he had it on mute. At least he wasn’t there to take any of the calls. At least he never got around to set up his voice mail. So there will only be text. Thank the Lord for small mercies.
Before Dean can find the words to answer, Cas looks back up. “I apologize. You are in a time of crisis. It is not the right time for jokes.”
Cas’ lips draw into a tight line. “I know that you mean that sarcastically, but, Dean, a soulmate is not all there is to life. You are a whole person on your own.”
Only this time, this time it would be forever. With Dad, Dean could tell himself that it would only be until Sam was grown up. Try not to make him angry while you’re still healing up and get through another few years.
“Mmh,” she flashes him a smile. “I getcha. Wouldn’t want to keep him waiting for too long. What with it being summer and all, he’s probably all hot and bothered…”
And really, this is as good as going with Amara. In fact, this is better. Because Dean’s got a feeling that his friends and family would try to keep contact with him, even if he asks them not to. They’d try to keep him safe even when it brings them into the path of danger. If he’s dead, Amara has no reason to go after them. She won’t harm them. All Dean has to do is to stay far away. And he can discuss that with Cas when they’re alone. Make him see reason. Make him see that Dean’s not worth giving your whole life up for.
“For a while anyway,” Cas nods. “I’m leaving early tomorrow. I’m going to visit my granny for the summer. I don’t know how long I’ll be away.”
That transforms Steve’s whole face. He goes from embarrassed and open to worried and calculating. “What kind of bad things?” he asks.
“Oh, you gotta bring the two of them by then,” Natasha says from where she’s suddenly showed up in the doorway, “my boys have just said this morning how much they’d like a dog.”
good,” Balthazar grins. But when he sees Cas’ face, he relents. “Missouri told me you were in town. Told me it was a good idea to keep an eye out for you around the cemetery. Said something about you being a stubborn idiot for not calling her to come with you.”
He makes a face at his phone but he he also makes the effort and tries to sort his thoughts. “I’m not his. Not right now, anyway. Don’t think it is what he needs, either. He’s got enough trouble keeping himself from falling apart. So I’m going to see whether I can help with that. Not as his…”
Dean opens his folder and looks through the documents. Birth certificate, driver’s license, SAT scores, credit card…
Cas looks at him a little bit like Dean is an exotic exhibit at the zoo or like he just spoke Martian, so Dean decides to shoo him out for now. “I’ll explain later, I promise. Now go, get out of your work clothes and find something with a loose fitting belt line. Between the burgers and the pie you’ll need it.”
Cas’ face does something complicated at that statement, but Dean’s got no time to figure it out because he has to navigate his way into the steady stream of cars off the highway. “Why is everyone out today? Don’t they have family to be with?” he grumbles.
For a heartbeat, Steve wishes Bucky would just take what he wants. But then he notices that this is what Bucky wants and he’s making it clear that he wants it and Steve’s got the ability to give it to him. So he lets his hands glide further back on Bucky’s head, draws him closer and closes the last few inches between them.
Gabriel’s eyes find Dean who stares blankly for a moment. He has no idea where Amara knows that from. Receipts that he didn’t throw out and that she found when she was at his place? “Coffee is fine,” he says weakly. What else did she find when she was there? Does she have Sammy’s address? Cas’? He should have warned them. Or never have brought them into this.
He searches for the right word but before he finds it, Cas continues for him, “Profound. Our bond is much more profound.”
Steve is content learning to read Bucky instead of trying to figure out what Nat is doing, but he guesses you can only stare so long before you count as a creep. So he mobilizes his technical knowledge and manages to snap a picture of Nat and Bucky hunched over the computer. And that would probably still be kind of creepy if it wasn’t for the fact that his two favorite spies and assassins of course completely notice that he’s snapping a picture.
He thinks of Cas’ bedhead while he slices apples for the pie. Of the way Cas’ hair sticks up in all directions, whether he’s fresh out of the shower or coming in from work. While making the crust, he thinks of how the crease in his forehead seems to be a permanent feature sometimes, but then they’ll watch a funny movie and Dean will laugh himself silly only to notice that Cas is looking at him with a soft smile, all the tension having bled out of him, if only for a short unguarded moment. Maybe it’s those moments, Dean thinks. Maybe those moments make up for all the other shit Dean brings with him. He’s got to hope anyway, because he hasn’t got all that much else to offer.
He has to bite his lips to keep the sounds in that want to escape when he imagines Cas’ fingers on his skin, moving with purpose instead of just holding him up. Would he be demanding immediately, forcing Dean to accommodate him, or would he take it slow, stretching out chaste touches until Dean is begging him for more?
And Cas has said that to him before. After Purgatory. And Dean had conveniently suppressed the memory and never mentioned it again. God, Dean’s not just a shitty friend, he’s a shitty excuse for a human being. He clears his throat and stutters a few helpless words. “Glad you - didn’t. Don’t know what I’d… I… Glad you’re still here, man. On this planet, I mean. Because I’d understand, you know. If after that whole thing in the bunker – If you want nothing to do with me anymore. I get it, okay? No need to break it to me gently or feel bad about it.”
Ellen frowns at him. “It’s not forbidden, you know. To pursue something that makes you happy. I mean, look at Sam.”
“Thank you.” Castiel takes the mug carefully. Claire has given him the one with rainbow lightsabers on it that usually is Charlie's go-to when they're playing D&D. “And yes, if I had - chickened out,” he confirms.
“Maybe you could consider the thought that this is as inconvenient for me as it is for you! I didn’t want this! I didn’t want to FUCKING FALL IN LOVE!!!”
“I’m not hiding. Not anymore, Cas... What we did... it was... it’s never been like that for me. Part of me has always been disgusted by sex.  I’ve always felt like something was wrong with me. Hell, Lisa is a beautiful woman and a yoga-teacher to boot and half the time I can hardly get it up for her! But ever since I met you... I couldn’t ignore THAT side of me anymore. God, I’ve done that for so long... to long. I kept trying to be dad’s perfect son, kept pushing everything down... You learn to love the pain you feel, ya know? It becomes a part of you. With me, it just fed my anger...and the anger was an outlet for everything I couldn’t say... couldn't have... But now... it’s a brave new world.”
That stops Dean right in his tracks. They are still standing nose to nose, breathing heavily. Cas eyes slide down to Deans lips... their foreheads touch...
She just LEFT! Instead of taking his side, like a good wife is supposed to, she told him they’re done. Just like that. Cupid be damned.
“Again, perfectly normal. I will now proceed with the prostate stimulation, if that’s ok with you? I’m not hurting you, am I?”
Everyone got their happy ending except for John who’s still muted in the Empty listening to the angel Jasmin’s chronicles of Destiel for all eternity :D
His voice is neutral, but he can see heat in his eyes.  Dean keeps describing how it went, what they did and Cas is conflicted. On one hand he turned on by the thought of Dean fucking his wife, pretending it’s him... on the other hand, he’s insanely jealous that he fucked his wife after telling him he’d end it, no matter what. He tries not to show his disappointment.
Dean’s torn. He knows he has this...urge, buried deep inside. It’s something he thought he’d never act on. His dad put the fear of God in him to never do THAT. But other-Dean... Fuck it, he has to ask.
He gets up and reaches inside his coat for a moment. Once he’s found what he’s looking for, he gets back in position, briefly thrusting his cock against Deans. He makes quick work of putting lube on his fingers and starts prepping himself. Dean is looking at him like he’s seen divinity... He cautiously touches Cas, twisting his hand on the upstroke, making his eyes roll back. He’s finally ready, and positions himself over his lover. They are locked in a bruising kiss as he lowers himself on Dean’s cock. They both moan, temporarily overwhelmed by the sensations. It only takes Cas a minute to recover and he starts riding Dean at a gallop. This isn’t going to take long... Dean quickly gets with the plan and starts stroking him again, matching his own rhythm. His thighs are burning and quivering, he’s about to come... And he doesn’t know of it’s the clench of his hole around him, the almost animalistic cry he lets out or the come landing on his chest, but Dean’s back arches and what he sees in his eye is so incredibly vulnerable it breaks his heart a little. His eye fall shut and he let’s go. It’s beautiful.
The laugh John let’s out chill’s Sam to the bone. Let’s see how he takes this: “Ah no... no waitress. And look, I know you’re not a fan of interspecies relationships, but bear with me. See, Jack, he’s not all human. He’s a nephilim. That’s half-angel/half-human. But he’s such a good kid and they raised him so well! He actually became the new God when we killed the first one. All the more reason to be proud... Dad?”
John’s sitting outside the roadhouse. He can’t go in, can’t face THEM again... He takes a deep breath and looks up at the stars. Heaven sure isn’t what he imagined it’d be.
“I had the same idea, you know... After you were gone and we had no idea how to beat Chuck... I was desperate for... I don’t know... something. Anything. Took the jacket with your handprint on it to a local tattoo artist.” He quickly pulls of his own shirt and reveals a handprint tattoo on his left shoulder. “Looks just like the mark you gave me. Made me feel like you were still with me.”
The more Dean tries not to think about him, the more his hand accelerates its movements. He wonders... maybe he could use his own fingers? He could do this himself, right? Right. He’s never had anyone go near his ass, ever. Well, except Cas the other day... It’s one thing to admit to yourself you’re bi, but he hadn’t really been on board with acting on it.  For fucks sake, he’s 37, he can do this and shouldn’t be ashamed to want it!
“Sensitive huh? Quite normal I believe. No deviations detected. Your testicles feel very heavy though...”
“Dean...Lisa... I hope you enjoyed the sermon? I know I do things a bit differently than my predecessor, but I hope it’s a good change at least?”
The wink he sends Johns way makes him run for the hills. The laughter of everyone present at ‘Harvelles’ following him out.
Cas hasn’t stopped his ministrations, in fact, the closeness, his smell, the new angle and extra friction make it even better. His lips keep moving over the skin of Cas’ neck, nose pressing against his jaw, breathing him in. Before long, Dean’s moaning like he’s being paid for it, uninhibited and LOUD. He’s moving against the angel, oblivious of the way said angel has started panting and biting his lip.
The cocky grin he gives Dean, brings back all sorts of memories. Not bad per se... but... not exactly the kind Cas would like to hear about either.
He can’t take it anymore... he gets up and takes the angel in a crushing embrace, burying his face in his neck. Audience be damned!
Later, when Dean’s driving and gradually starts feeling better, he allows himself to think about what Cas did. How it felt. Fuck...it felt...good. Really good. And he wasn’t even doing that much. Imagine if he’d... NO! No, no, no... Cas is his best friend, he can’t be thinking about him like THAT!
“Forgive me Father, I have sinned. I committed adultery. My wife is a really good person. Honest, loyal, caring, an amazing mother... and I broke our vows. Actually... I broke our vow before we even made them. I lied to her. I told her I loved her...and I do... but as a friend. I have never had romantic feelings for her. I’ve never even been sexually attracted to her. How could I be? I... I’m... I’m gay. She doesn’t know that either. Both of us are just...caught in a web of lies and I...”
He's behind the desk this time, the couple sitting on the other side. Professional. As it is supposed to be.
Her eyebrows shoot up, but her naughty smile remains. Yeah... he knew she’d be up for a quick rough&tumble. Lady in the streets, freak in the sheets, right?
“So ah, Cas is it? The angel who rescued Dean from Hell? Funny...I thought angels would be all ethereal and flowy gowns an harps... you seem very...not that.”
Sam isn't happy, Dean sees the error in his ways, Cas returns... My, oh, my, whatever could be next?????
He ends up leaving the shop at noon. The guys know their job, they can do without him for a day. A few hours on the road, just him and baby, that’ll clear his mind right up!
They walk into Father Zachariah's office and suddenly his world shifts.  Blue. All he sees is blue. The strangers’ eyes fixed on his like there’s some sort of magnetism between them.
“You know what... let’s introduce Jack to John... I’ll make his brain rot with the weird stuff I’ll plant in there...”
When he gets back to the land of the living, he takes a deep breath and looks at him with a devious smile. He reaches out his right hand and dips his index and middle finger into their combined cum, cooling on Dean’s chest. He gathers some on those fingers, daintily licks at them and then he leans forward, touching them to Dean’s forehead, sternum and both shoulders.
He presses their foreheads together for a brief moment, squeezing his eyes shut... and flees for real this time.
When they’ve recovered, John is nowhere to be seen. Dean is still inside him, not all the way soft yet and he starts grinding down on him again... teasing him...
Wooh, boy! If only he knew what he really needed... Cas is looking at him with a frown on his face, obviously worried. Right, time to get this show on the road!
Dean’s angry now. His right hand has been his only relief lately... he hasn’t gotten laid in ages. And now even that’s faltering. Oh, there has been occasion for meaningless sex with the random stranger, but something’s stopping him. Someone...
Mary taps out after the Chocolate Habanero. But Cas and John are not ready to let the other win just yet. The Ghost Pepper makes John go so red in the face, he’s almost purple. Cas just keeps on smiling his I’m-better-than-you-smile to egg him on.
Cas was still feeling embarrassed, but it was fading quickly as Dean held him in his arms, some Star Wars movie playing on the tv.
That sure as hell got Cas' attention, and he was shaking his head vehemently. He didn't need to bother Michael just because he was dumb enough to stick his ass out. He was practically
Gnawing on his lower lip, he looked over at Cas doing homework on his bed. Fuck, the sight of Cas looking so damn comfortable and relaxed in Dean's nest really did something to his libido.
"This looks great, mom," Dean said happily, digging in as his younger brother made a noise of agreement, already shoveling food into his mouth.
‘Why don’t you ask him out then?’ Cas seemed to think about it for a minute before answering, signing a bit slow.
Jo came back a few minutes later, setting down their respective drinks. "You ready, love?" She asked, looking at Cas with a grin.
"You're very clumsy." A husky voice whispered in his ear from behind him, and suddenly there was a body plastered against his back. The light was flicked on, showing the back of the janitor's closet.
There were so many times Dean could have tried something, but he never did. Never seemed to want to.
"Fine. We'll sit under the bleachers. No one will see us, including Dean." Cas bit his lip, because that actually sounded kind of tempting.
"I want it. Whatever you're willing to give to me, I want it." Dean smiled, hands travelling under Cas' -well, technically his- shirt.
Castiel put his phone down with a heavy heart, and that night, he fell asleep with a sense of uneasiness filling his body and one thought in his mind.
“Stay with Amelia and I. We already discussed this. We have a guest bedroom you can stay in. I have a buddy who owns a restaurant, you could get a job. And, we’d love to have you. I miss you. The real you. And I know Claire will be beyond happy to see you more often.” He smiled, as if Cas staying there would be the best thing to ever happen.
"Where were you?" Charlie asked as Cas sat down at their table. He had stood in the hallway for almost ten minutes, looking like an idiot as he tried to grasp what had happened. Did Dean actually talk to him? Say he missed him?
"Hey, hey," Dean soothed, and Cas didn't even flinch when he used his big thumbs to wipe away the tears. "It's okay.
"Can I hug you?" Dean asked as soon as Gabriel was out of sight, and Cas nodded, trying to hide his excitement. This was their first hug, and while it most likely meant nothing to Dean, it meant everything to Cas.
"Where do you want me?" He asked quietly, wanting to hurry up so they'd have time to actually work on their project.
"I-I don't know what you mean." He mumbled, looking down at his food. He forgot to pack a lunch this morning, so he was stuck with what the school had to offer, and so far he's barely touched it.
Instead, he protected him from alphas with wondering hands, he held Cas and let him talk about his past, he wiped his tears away when he was sad. And then he laughed with him, played
'The whiteboard and privacy with Dean, please.' Gabriel nodded, getting him the hand-held whiteboard and marker before going up the stairs.
He wanted to ask if everything was okay, but they weren't exactly friends, so Cas would most likely not tell him anyways.
Dean, unexpectedly, took Cas in his mouth, and in his pleasure-filled surprise, he bucked up, the head of his dick popping past the tight confines of Dean's throat. To Cas' immense surprise, though, Dean didn't gag. He took it like a fucking champ and swallowed around him, and Cas had definitely just lost his mind. Or better yet, Dean had just squeezed it out of his dick, because the only thing he could think of was how badly he wanted to come, and how good it felt when Dean bobbed his head, curling his tongue
“I’m sorry if you think it’s unprofessional calling him by name. But he’s not a HYDRA agent, he’s our neighbor and we’re invited to dinner at their place, so it hardly seems appropriate to call him
Charlie keeps her wide-eyed look of innocence though the smirk that plays around the corners of her mouth betrays her. “If all goes well, you’ll never find out.” Then the mirth disappears from her voice. “I’ll keep an eye on Amara, too. Can’t promise you that I’ll catch everything she does but I’ll do my best. If just to give you a warning, should she make a move in your direction.”
He brings up the photo he took of the picture of Cas and Gabriel, looks at it again, this time trying to figure out whether there’s anything similar between Gabriel’s expression and the way Dean looks when he has a bad day.
"Ah. Mass is done at the LGBT friendly church two towns over. That's their choir. I guess that's it for quiet time." Dean is actually disappointed by that, even though he's not gonna snub the Christmas profit. “Decide what you want to eat and I’ll be right back.”
That finally is enough to make Cas get up and stalk over to Dean. He stabs a finger at Dean’s ribs. “You want to leave me behind, do it. I can’t stop you. But don’t go ahead and think you can make me
anymore?” Cas actually fumbles with the sentence before it finally comes out, like he’s terrified to even say the words.
“Gabriel talked of this,” Cas says quietly. “That he had met someone once, who had lost a – mate.” He can’t be sure of course, that Dean’s mom was that to Dean’s dad. But everything he’s told him about them so far seems to indicate it. “He said there was hardly anything left but grief.”
“Dean,” Cas counters sternly. “Don’t hate on the name. I chose it for myself when I was human, remember?”
“As well as could be expected,” Dean answers. “They won’t counter it anyway. They have no better ideas.”
And yeah, if he keeps going like this, angelheart is definitely on the fast track to Dean’s heart. Still, he can at least pretend to keep his cool about this.
“Yeah, Dean, I’m not so sure. I mean, she was very good, I’ll grant her that. Very casual. I’m not sure this was a coincidence, though.”
Dean doesn’t know why he is so focused on their neighbors and why it is so important for him to mark them as evil, but he just feels it in his gut. And if Cas doesn’t want to see it, Dean has to show him.
Steve nods mutely. They already knew that Charlie knows the Winchesters. It stands to reason that she likes them if she doesn’t interfere with them using her code.
“So am I getting this right that we’re six people this year?” Sam, being his sensible self, brings them back on point before they can spiral any further.
There isn’t too much to say to that. It’s Dean’s fault and he knows it. Cas had been a good angel before Dean came along and wrecked it all. “Anything I can do to help you get your wings back?” That might atone for at least a part of his sins.
Dean could of course be riding his stallion but he steadfastly trots next to Cas. Until, that is, Charlie leads her dun-colored mare up to them one morning when they’re setting out for the day.
“No. No, he wasn’t. He and my dad, they -,” he breaks off. “My dad wasn’t – after my mom’s death he –“, but that sentence finds no continuation, either.
It makes something change in Cas’ eyes. But Dean is not sure it’s a good thing because Cas’ voice is utterly toneless when he whispers, “But I will. If she gets her way, I will. And I can’t do it again. I can’t.”
“But Cas – why?” Dean asks because he’s pretty sure he’s done more than one thing that should be unforgivable.
“Why? What do you have to be sorry about? You’re the good guy here, the Guardian who’s propping me up. I’m the sorry asshole, who can’t even manage what everyone else in the fucking world can do.”
Dean turns his palm up in invitation and Cas hesitantly slides his hand over Dean’s. It makes Dean shudder. Noticeably enough, actually, that Cas cringes and tries to take his hand back.
“Dean, my falling is not your responsibility. It never was. I made my own choices.” And dammit if Cas doesn’t sound forgiving and gentle and everything that Dean doesn’t deserve.
Lara Croft and she’s not from a spy movie, either. In fact, I’ve tried to keep her somewhat close to the original. Cause, you know, learning your lines is all good and well, and I’m sure it’ll work for Cas, but when you’re grieving the truth tends to spill out.”
“I don’t. Or didn’t. But she introduced herself. I don’t fathom there’s that many Amaras running around who have a complementary soulmate mark to yours.”
“I’m aware,” Sam nods. “Now look at this. This is from the website of the Smithsonian. Remind you of someone?”
And Dean’s pretty sure his own voice is not up to any actual words right now, so all he does is nod. Because yeah, the warmth feels good. Grounding. Like that anchor he was desperately searching for earlier.
“Shoot me now,” Claire lets herself fall back dramatically in her chair and almost keels over, chair and all.
It makes Dean’s stomach queasy, dragging it out into the open like that. “Do you think…” But he breaks off.
"You're shitting me. You're driving down here every weekend just to -" Dean gestures vaguely around them.
If you’d asked Dean an hour ago, he’d have had a lot of ideas of how he’d like a Christmas evening with Cas to go if a djinn granted him a few free wishes. It’s definitely not this.“So what do you - what do you want to do now?” he asks a little helplessly.
Cas raises an eyebrow at him. He doesn’t take Dean’s hand, doesn’t hug him. Keeps his distance because they aren’t soulmates. They have no right to be touching. Also because Sam doesn’t know about any of the new developments. And because it’s all so interwoven, Dean can’t explain it to him, either. Can’t say, ‘Yeah, Cas and I kiss now, and he’s got stubble even when he shaved just a few hours ago. I kind of dig it.’
“Okay,” Dean nods and because he’s a masochist who leaves himself open to rejection, he adds, ”So, want to help me with the burgers maybe?”
He’s not doing this for Dean. He’s doing this for himself. He needs to deal with this. He owes it to himself.
Cas blinks, processing without moving much at all. But he doesn’t flinch away and there’s no sudden spark in his eyes that flashes with lust. That’s a start.
“Cas, I - I don’t want you to bear my attentions because you have to.” He trails off for a moment, his voice unsure. But when he starts back up again his tone is determined. He touches a hand to Cas’ hip, or not to his hip, to the carving knife that’s still in its sheath at Cas’ side. “I know I gave this to you for a different reason but I’m glad that you wear it. Use it if you have to. If anyone touches you against your will. Even if that anyone is me.”
And indeed, she reaches over to touch his hand lightly. “So you are here for both your brother and for yourself. I’m glad.”
Dean takes a couple of unconscious steps towards Cas before he catches himself. “And?” he asks anxiously.
For the past eight weeks anyway, every Friday and Saturday, but who is counting? Well, Dean is apparently. But then, having Castiel sit at the bar always brightens his night. And it’s not just because it’s rare that good-looking strangers stumble into his bar and stay. Dean enjoys a good view as much as anyone, but he’s come to appreciate Castiel’s dry humor and friendly banter as well.
Amara regards him like he is a maggot, so far beneath her that she has to think about whether she wants to spend the energy to crush it. “This is between me and my soulmate. Get out of my way before I forcibly remove you.”
“My, how very generous of you. And such fancy words. But what can you really do, Cas? What can you really do to help? Charlie may have lost her soulmate, but at least she found them first. You? You’ve never even had a fling. What do you know of bonds and of love?”
"I love you," Cas said, barely aware of what was coming out of his mouth until it was too late. And then he froze right alongside Dean, the both of them staring with wide eyes, and Cas barely dared to breathe lest that be the thing that set Dean off, that left Cas Dean-less. But then he smiled, so bright and blinding that the sun was probably watching on in envy.
And that was how, two hours later, he found himself hiding from the rest of the audience underneath the bleachers, Charlie grinning smugly beside him.
Dean collected the precum, aligning their dicks together to start stroking them together, hand slicking the way.
confused. Why would Dean care? Or pretend to care? He understood that Dean was trying to groom him, but still. This seemed like a small thing, even then.
‘He’s sweet,’ Cas got this far away look on his face and Gabriel anxiously waited for him to continue.
Cas looked up at that, and another wave of hurt came when Alistair obediently listened. He never listened to Cas. About anything.
"No, Cas. They aren't right. And if they just gave you a chance, they'll see what I see. A kind, smart, brilliant person who deserves the world."
And then that spit-slick hand was wrapping around him, making Cas arch up into the ouch as much as he could.
"Fee-els so good, Dean. Faster, please, please, Dean." He was gasping and moaning out these soft little sounds, trying his best to keep it down.
“Don’t kiss me. It’s gross.” Cas looked away, trying to keep the hurt from his voice as he continued on.
He seriously needed to get a grip on reality and then- holy shit, when did they cross the field into the parking lot?
Spurred on by the reaction, he suckled at Dean's head, eyes closing in contentment because he liked this, it was calming in a way.
"What? Why not?" Cas stopped moving for the moment, though his breathing was harder to get under control.
Once it was just him there, leaning against the door, Dean long gone, he realised just how truly in love he was.
Taking the seat on Cas' right, the one he has claimed as his, he beamed even brighter. That delicious smell he has associated with the omega wafted up in his nose, and he delightfully inhaled, though in a,
When he felt safe enough to look at Dean again, the idiot was still smiling, but there was a hint of fondness in it that made Cas melt into a sappy puddle.
"My room. Come on," Dean started towards the staircase, and Cas stood stock-still for a moment, willing his legs to follow.
"Of course. I trust you more than anyone, I know you'd never hurt me." And he was not prepared for the kiss that Dean gave, so full of emotions, he thought his chest would burst with them.
Dean gave the girl an apologetic shrug before following Sam back to the car, taking some mercy out on him and not mentioning what just happened.
"How about I walk you to the office so you can get someone to come pick you up?" Dean asked kindly, teeth back to normal.
‘When he teases me, his eyes get this mischevious glint in them, always ratting him out. Speaking of his eyes, they are so green, so beautiful. They have these little specks of gold and brown near the irises. When he talks about his brother, Sam, his eyes fill with adoration and love, voice full of pride. He even puffs his chest out a bit. When something’s on his mind, he bites his lip and jiggles his left leg. But when he’s excited, he jiggles his right. When he’s annoyed, he runs his fingers through his hair, pulling at the strands slightly. When he wakes up, he drinks two cups of coffee before even thinking about people. He sings quietly when he thinks nobody is listening. He originally joined football because he thought it would make his dad proud, but found he loved the sport.’
“By being badass,” Dean answers and this time his smile is real. “You see now why I don’t believe we have to be worried about how she treats you?”
Still no answer. Dean’s heart starts pounding as he looks around. No signs of a struggle or someone breaking and entering while he was away. That’s good at least.
“Dean, I think that gash needs stitches. I mean it’s right up in your hairline and I can’t see it that well but it looks deep.”
He swallows his feelings about that down because if he thinks too much about it, he’s pretty sure he’s going to break down and that’s the last thing he wants. Gabriel has confirmed that their timeline is to get this done at the new moon, so Dean won’t have to get through too many days of this. He takes what courage he has and texts Sam to ask whether they can meet up, timing it so that his last supper will be with his brother. At least that’ll hopefully keep him from going out of his mind on that last night before he’s going to die.
She’s still smiling sweetly, even as she rips a hole open in Dean’s chest with her words. He’s thought it before, after all, how there’s nothing here for Sam. Apart from Dean. How there isn’t really any other reason for Sam to stay here. Apart from that he worries about Dean. Is Dean no more than a burden for him? Holding him back?
Dean looks at her puzzled because she already knows that he’s following Cas around like a lovesick puppy, so there’s really not that much new information there.
is a word that maybe describes him well. So Cas should be the one who sets the speed. Who is in control.
Freaking angel doesn’t want to see what Dean is trying to do here. An idea forms in his mind and he tries to be as casual as he can when he finally says, “Okay, you know what… let’s flip a coin. Heads, you get the bed - tails, I get the bed. There is a 50 - 50 chance for both of us, Cas. It is only fair.”
The next morning, the space beside him isn’t empty as usual. Steve stretches, his joints creaking after the night on the hardwoods. “How long have you been up?” he asks.
. How for one second he had almost forgotten that he isn’t allowed to feel this way. That this is not supposed to make him feel good. If anything, it should make him feel more guilty. Should remind him how much Cas has lost for him. How many angels are dead because of Dean. How many friends. It should remind him that all Cas got as a reward for helping them, for trying to save the world over and over again, is being half-broken, half-human and stuck in suburbia with Dean.
“You got to give it to SHIELD, their info is good,” Bucky remarks once they’re safely back inside their own house. “Didn’t actually think the guys would show.”
God, why is everything so messed up. Dean runs a hand down his face, glad to find no wetness. Crying over spilled milk is not something he does. He just wishes he knew. Whether it was a fluke, a onetime thing. Or whether he actually doesn’t have it in him to kill Cas. He had wanted to kill him during that fight. Had wanted to be rid of him. Of his concern. Of his love. It had all weighed him down, held him back. Kept him sane, he sees that now, but he didn’t back then. Only, he hadn’t killed him. He’d tried to scare him off. And now he was scared that that had worked.
“I’m sorry,” Dean mumbles because staring is rude and staring at a wristband is even worse. But he still sees the afterimage as if it’s burned into his retinas.
“If you can do stitches on a hamster, you can do stitches on a human,” Castiel frowns and drags Dean with him when he pushes past Chuck and into the house. “Where should I put him?”
Balthazar’s arms sink as he observes Cas with a new attention. “Okay, so Missouri was right, you are in a bad place right now. Any particular reasons for this one? Or at least something else I can call you? I’m not going to go and call you Castiel every time I want to talk to you.”
The tiles of the kitchen floor suddenly feel freezing so Dean heaves himself up. He goes to find his phone, ignoring the notifications and mechanically searching for Charlie’s number.
Because these days, Dean’s actually kind of proud of his life, pathetic lovesickness aside. He’s got a job that he doesn’t hate, he’s got great friends, and back when he thought Cas was
Suddenly, Dean’s knees are weak. Cause he’s expected a lot but not that. He didn’t even think - do angels fall in love? But then, how much angel is Cas really these days? He’s more human than anything. And that’s because of Dean. So what happens if they - do this? Not just as a cover for a case. What if they give it a real shot? Does it mean that Cas will fall the rest of the way? Cut off from the heavenly host forever?
Cas himself would like to sink into the ground and be forgotten. Or walk in the middle of their trek with Missouri. Anything but be here.
Bucky nods. “Yeah. It showed up among the HYDRA bits and pieces a few days ago.” He bites his lip. “When you said it, it felt - significant. Made me stop. But I couldn’t - I can’t remember why. Why is it significant, Steve?” His voice is small and Steve’s not sure his is going to be any better.
“You said you’re doing that at your family’s, not here,” Cas reminds him gently. “There’s no need to change your traditions for me. Not any more than you already have.”
Dean huffs and for a moment he is tempted to deflect. But then, he kind of actually needs to know this. Or at least get a ballpark number. “Just thinking about what you want with me.”
Steve takes a deep breath. “We’re still within mission parameters,” he says determinedly, having found that wording this drily is the only way how he can get through it without breaking down. “You haven’t done anything wrong. There is no change to our orders.”
Dean nods because he does, even though it means that their time together will be cut short by another ten minutes or however long ago it was that Sam had placed the order.
Only, there’s this cold ball of dread in Dean’s stomach and while the words are not enough to dissolve it, it’s like a ray of sunshine hitting the ice, warming its surface and making it shrink. So he knocks his knee against Cas’ under the table. “Yeah, Cas, I want that, too,” he admits.
She doesn’t wait for an answer, just grabs her bag that was parked next to the couch and saunters out of the room.
“Goodness, Cas, stow the melodrama. There’s other ways to get around than wings.” If Cas can’t come to him, Dean will come to him. And he can’t wait another day or even a minute. So he gets up from his bed and goes to search for a pair of jeans and a flannel while he asks, “So where are you, man? And don’t say in a motel room. Where is that motel?”
“Oh oh. What’s wrong?” Claire comes over to lean against the kitchen counter. “You never make cocoa unless something is wrong.”
“You led me into it.” Maybe it’s stating the obvious, but it baffles Dean to no end. Why Cas would do something like that for him.
“I’m working on it, Dean, just give me a sec.” There is furious typing on the other end of the line. “I’ll try to counter-hack them. Maybe I can find out more about them.”
The silence that follows it is deafening. Dean crosses his arms over his chest and keeps his eyes on his brother, the challenge clear in his stance.
Cas knows nothing to answer to that. Dean has told him that it isn’t his fault that they’re not making it South, but it still feels in his heart like it is.
“If he finds out from The National Enquirer, that’s gonna derail shit that much harder,” Bobby points out, not unreasonably.
For a long moment, there is utter silence. Dean seems to have stopped breathing. Then he lets his breath out in a rush. “I’ve always thought that that tea - that it is dangerous.”
But the reason was either that they already had had sex before, that they were playing and Cas wouldn’t allow sex, or that they’d been to a party and were too tired and drunk to have sex. Because they haven’t ever lived together. So when Dean stayed over, sex was usually on the menu.
“It’s okay, Cas. Oh, and I made sure that your papers stayed exactly as they were sorted. I put them on the shelf in the living room for the time being.”
He’d almost forgotten that. Buried under his guilt, the only way he’d seen was to run. To get away so that he could not hurt Dean anymore. But he has no doubt that Dean felt their connection in these moments, too. In fact, Dean has told him as much. Has told him that he was always committed.
Dean’s throat suddenly feels tight, and okay, his emotions are on a rollercoaster today. “You wanna stop with the deep talks for a while and, I don’t know, eat the sandwiches and watch a movie or something?”
Dean stares at the message on his screen. He clicks out of the website and back in. The message is still there.
“You really love each other,” Cas’ voice is soft and Dean looks over to him. There is a small smile on his face and Dean’s heart aches.
“You’re kinda the one who has to tell me that. But he says he’s your dad and that he’s here to get back in contact with you. I told him I’d ask whether you’re interested in talking to him.” He gets the pot and puts it on the stove, giving Claire some time to process.
Cas’ eyes blink open again at the gesture, and this time they turn wide as apparently the world crashes back in on him as well. “It’s today,” he says like it’s a surprise.
“Well, our regulars are all dudes apart from Gilda and me!” Charlie defends. “And it’s highly doubtful that Gilda would intentionally flirt with you.”
So all Dean does is shake his head and volunteer some information after all. "For the record, both her grandma and social services are well aware that she’s living with me. I made sure of that." Dean shakes his head. "There’s nothing nefarious going on, man.”
“Yeah, no shit, man,” Dean mutters while he tries to get a grip on the situation. It’s so dark in the alley and his vision is still blurry. He goes taut when the man crosses the final few steps between them, ready to attack, but the man just squats down next to him and squints at him, head tilted to the side.
And maybe if he tells himself that another few thousand times it will stop feeling as horrible as it does.
“Hmm,” Balthazar gives a noncommittal grunt. “Maybe that should be your place to start. Honesty. I mean, I get the casual thing and all, but the way your eyes and your face do this thing when you’re talking about him, I’m getting the feeling that it isn’t all that casual.”
messed up. Still, thinking about Cas is better than anything else he’s been thinking about so far today, so Dean decides that as long as he can keep his mind out of the gutter, thinking about Cas is a small vacation from the world of shit he’s stuck in, and that since he can’t do anything about any of that right now anyway, small vacations are allowed.
The question is a little more aggressive than is called for, so Dean raises his eyebrows again. “Dude, you can ask about my life but I’m not sure I should be telling you her stories.”
Cas’ gaze falls down to their hands and even though the bruise is covered Dean knows that it’s what Cas is looking for.
He goes back to staring at the ceiling, because if he’s going to try to make sense of this, then it’s easier when he’s not looking at her.
“If you haven't, I will have it for you until you find it again. You used to be so faithful, I don't think it vanished completely,” Hannah says.
Still, Dean nods his thanks at Castiel. The apology will not stay the only one, not if Cas wants Claire to forgive him, but it's a start.
Cas shakes his head ever so slightly before he mumbles. “I wish you could have met her. I think you would have liked her. She was - less obnoxious than Gabriel.”
“Dean, this is a bad idea.” But Cas turns around and drops the heap of blankets on the bed. On his side of the bed, to be precise.
Dean snorts and lets his horse’s reins fall to the ground, a sign for the stallion to stay where he is.
“Love wins,” Steve says warmly, and finally Dean averts his eyes from Cas to look at Steve, though he leaves his hand on Cas’. “I mean, being accepted for who we are… that was not something we always had. It still feels very new,” Steve continues.
“Tell her yourself. You’re still coming over for family night, right, boy?” Bobby asks, concern clear in his voice.
“I didn’t say that I was considering suicide,” Dean says. As far as attempts to calm his family go, it’s unsuccessful, because suddenly he has Cas holding onto his one arm while Sam is holding onto the other. “Jesus Christ. Guys! Will you let go of me!”
“What did you think?” Nat shakes her head. “Captain America’s best friend and side-kick. Also, skinny-dipping.” She smirks and Bucky grins back at her.
“No.. I guess?” Dean says unsure. It’s been a while since he last used the notebook. “Cas, have you used the laptop and left it on?”
By the end of it, they are hungry, though, for something more substantial than sandwiches, so Cas produces a few take out menus and they order some fried rice from an Asian place and settle back in for a rewatch of Rogue One.
It’s a relief when the door to the gents’ falls closed behind him. He leans against it for a moment, breathing heavily and trying to regain his bearing. Then someone tries to come in. His heart hammers in his chest immediately, but he moves to the side. It’s not Amara, who comes in, though, it’s Cas.
Dean’s pretty sure sugar is not going to do anything for him, but he’s got a feeling that if he opens a whiskey bottle instead, he’s not going to stop drinking until the bottle is empty and he’s unconscious. So this is probably for the better.
“No, I… I just always thought you were a nice person, who likes making people feel better. Now I’m thinking it might be a little more personal than that.”
Cas @Dean: I haven’t made it to the cemetery yet. I can’t seem to get past the gates. I think I could do it if you were here.
That makes Cas close the distance between them in two large steps. “You have to survive your death, too,” he says and wraps his arms around Dean again.
“You’ve always had a weakness for Harrison Ford.” Cas smiles and it’s almost not awkward when he sits back down next to Dean.
Dean lets it slide for now, there is no point in pressing the topic and making Steve even more defensive. Not if they still want more information from their neighbors. “Okay,” Dean says flatly.
“Peanuts, huh?” Dean grins and goes over to the driver’s side. “Tell me more.” When Cas looks at him with little understanding, Dean shrugs. “Sam has told her all of my embarrassing childhood stories, but I’ve never had anyone to tell me all of hers.”
But Cas is unperturbed. He cups Dean’s cheek, stroking the skin softly. He brings his other hand up, too, following the same paths on the other side of Dean’s face, trailing carefully around where Dean’s face is busted up, mapping out the unhurt parts more deftly. It’s just sensation, good, but not meant to be more than that. An exploration of a world unknown. Cas lets his thumb trail over Dean’s lips but when Dean lets his mouth go pliant so that Cas can push in, Cas shakes his head. “Not yet.”
Cas’ face scrunches up guiltily. "No. I haven’t. At first I - I wanted to make sure. That it was her. I didn't, umm, I didn't go through the official channels to find her. I wasn't ready to -, umm," he breaks off and starts anew. "And then I wanted to see - who she is. Where she lives. How she lives. With whom she lives. What kind of person, umm, you are."
“I like him well enough, he doesn’t seem to be a bad guy,” and then it catches up with Steve that that’s not actually what Bucky is asking. With a sigh, he lets himself sink down next to his friend, nudging his shoulder in the process because he needs some physical contact. But of course the gesture is too impersonal, too much like macho camaraderie, and he cringes at himself. “Thought it was supposed to be me who got too much into the role of the jealous boyfriend.”
“You - what?” Dean is stumbling over the words. Has Cas heard him? Because he’s pretty sure he’s never said that out loud.
“Yeah,” Cas closes his eyes for a long moment. “Your life plans. That was what we were talking about.” When he opens his eyes again the smile on his face is obviously fake. “We’ll get them in order somehow. It’s not unheard of that people develop a second mark after their partner died. Maybe this is how it’s going to work for you. Maybe the second time will bring the person you want.”
“I know,” Cas nods. “That’s also why,” he clears his throat. “I guess it seemed a good day today. To tell you. Because it’s Christmas and we’re alone and…” He tapers off.
“Not making it any better, Cas,” Dean says because Dean will never stop feeling guilty for making Cas fall. At the same time, he can’t help smiling a little as well when he sees Cas’ smile. It’s like it’s physically impossible for him not to do everything in his power to keep that smile on Cas’ face.
Only, that’s not what happens. “This? This is what you’re basing your argument on?” She points at her wristband and laughs a half-hysterical laugh. Then she furiously unties the strings of the band and rips it off. “This, this
The heat creeps up Dean’s neck again. Of course Cas would notice. He’s always been attuned to Dean, inside and outside of their playtime. Dean fiddles with the leather band around his wrist.
Cas flinches at being addressed in the middle of a fight, though not as much as he flinches at being asked to take sides. Even if he guesses that technically it is his fault that they won’t make it far enough South. The snow had caught them three days out from Angels’ Nest and hasn’t stopped since. “I wasn’t with you last winter,” he says softly. “I wouldn’t know.” He can still hardly believe that he is with them this year. That he is welcome in this pack and in Dean’s life.
By the sympathetic look Charlie gives him, all his anguish he feels about his brother was splayed open in that. “I promise I’ll do my best,” she nods, before she hesitantly adds. “But please be aware - I was your Guardian, Dean.”
Dean sighs and lets go of him, holding his hands up in a peaceful gesture. “I’m sorry, Cas. I shouldn’t have joked like that.”
Suddenly, there are tears in Claire’s eyes. She wipes at them angrily. Of course her answer is an aggressive “Yeah, whatever”, but Dean knows her too well to buy it. He puts his hand over hers. She lets him hold it for a moment, lets him comfort her before she pulls away with a huff. It’s more than Dean expected. If there’s one thing Claire despises it’s when someone notices when she’s vulnerable.
“Yeah,” Dean grins, never one to be shy when the compliments are about food he makes. “I come with perks.” He wiggles his eyebrows.
“Don’t want to lose you, either,” Dean whispers and suddenly he’s got his hands fisted into Cas’ dirty shirt to cling on to him and then Cas draws him into a tight hug. It’s the kind of hug where you feel like you’re drowning and holding on is the only way you can get a tiny bit of air and maybe, just maybe survive long enough to come back to the surface.
For a moment, Claire looks at the photo blankly. Then her eyes widen. She stares at it like she’s seeing a ghost.
“Yeah, I thought so,” Dean chuckles. He rolls to his side, holding the covers up in invitation. “You gonna come over and protect me from all the evil nightmares?”
There is a long silence on the other end of the line. Long enough, actually, that Dean checks angelheart’s online status. But yeah, the little green dot is still there. This is getting a little ominous.
It still sounds like bravado, so Dean squeezes her shoulder before they separate to go to their own rooms.
“Nah, I am good,” Dean stutters. He doesn’t feel comfortable with anyone out here, and wait, if Bucky is here, then Steve and Cas are inside on their own, and no, that’s not okay. That’s very not okay. He might need that beer after all.
Dean groans and lets himself drop back down on his chair. That was not the part of his little speech that Dean had wanted Cas to focus on.
He never knew his son could move so well. Dance moves... on top of everything else... he’s got fucking dance moves. John huffs and looks away.
“Well, its been a very long time since my dad was actually present. Maybe for the best... being a good straight Christian man and all, the gay vibe might not have sat well with him. Ugh, you should have SEEN the staring! I swear, if I had made it to Heaven and saw those idiots STILL dancing around each other... I mean, ok, is it weird that Dean is banging my dead dad’s corpse? Yeah... but hey, it doesn’t even hit the top 10 of weird shit we’ve had to deal with. I mean, Kaia and me, we’ve been hunting since our teens. Not many things faze us these days...”
Dean had been waiting for Cas to come to him, to talk about what he said before the Empty took him (he refuses to call it dying, Cas simply isn’t allowed to die!). He hasn’t. And Dean being... well... Dean... he hasn’t got a clue as to how he’s supposed to start that conversation. Who knows, maybe Cas has had a change of heart? Maybe he’s already regretting his decision to be human?
They spend the rest of the day at the youth centre. And the homeless shelter. And the soup kitchen. Castiel is there for everyone, off course, but Dean quickly sees why this work is so important to him. Young people keep swarming around Cas. He listens to them all. Some of them cry... he gives them their smile back.
Nice try, Cas... He won’t walk away. He will let him do his thing, hell, he’ll even help him! Loyalty is one of Dean’s best qualities, after all. Cas just needs a little push.
He sits down on the edge of the bed, elbows on his knees, head in his hands. “I’m sorry, Cas”, he says as he feels his eyes get wet.
As he’s about to come, one of those hands starts wandering. Deans taken by surprise when suddenly there’s a finger drawing circles around his hole. He reacts by thrusting in even deeper, making Cas moan... the vibration proves to much and his orgasm rips through him, more forceful than he’s ever experienced. Cas takes it like a pro and swallows all Dean has to give. *HOW is this man a priest?!*
John is being a very naughty boy! Luckily, Cas knows how to handle naughty boys... bit smuttier than usual.
Dean has to get out of there and ravish his man. Right the fuck NOW. They get up en leave John sitting there looking absolutely gobsmacked.
His collection had started the moment they moved into the bunker. He’d been thinking about it for years, but with no place to hide them from Sam, buying them was a no-go. And then suddenly he had a room of his own. Privacy. He still keeps them in a black box under his bed though... Sam may suspect that Dean’s bi, but he doesn’t want to talk about it. Doesn’t want the teasing. It’s a part of himself he always felt he had to hide. Gaining their freedom and Cas’ “last words” have made him come to terms with who he really is, but he’s not quite there yet.
Claire looks at Kaia like she hung the moon and that’s when he first sees it... They’re holding hands. And wearing matching wedding bands. Well, shit!
Suddenly strong arms encircle him and even though all his instincts scream at him to fight back, he stills.
That’s it, time to take a load of... John decides to go to “Harvelle’s” and drink himself into a stupor.
He’s pulled from his train of thought by the feeling of hands caressing his hips. One hand slides down and starts fondling his dick. Ok, yeah... that’ll work! Cas seems to have a clear grasp of what he’s doing, pun intended. Within seconds Dean is fully erect and practically begging for more. Cas’ other hand starts playing with his balls, caresses them, cradles them, tugs al little... and then he goes further south. He's not even going slow anymore, none of this careful one-finger-bullshit, but straight up pushes 2 fingers in and hits his prostate dead-on.
The surge of jealousy surprises Cas. This man is not his, no matter how much he desires him, he has no right to feel betrayed. And yet...
“Uhm... it’s... been good so far. Easier than expected, I guess? There is indeed more to a relationship than just, ah, the physical side. I feel like we’ve definitely talked more.”
Even though he’s trying to hold off both their orgasms, he starts moving faster. His animalistic nature quickly overcoming his rational thinking, as Deans cock keeps hitting his prostate. Moans and cries of pleasure fill the air as the chair starts creaking, its legs scratching the hardwood floor...
Cas gives a sermon and couples therapy takes an interesting turn. Warning to the sensitive hearts: adulterous smut at the end.
Dean has been quiet this whole time. No comments, no questions, no comebacks. He hears him get up and suddenly he’s wrapped in his arms.
The song starts with a wailing guitar and he turns to John with a knowing smile, “I love Billy Idol and he knows it.”
“Well, you sure jumped on the opportunity with me, didn’t ya?! Literally! What am I supposed to think?!”
Dean is in a damn good mood. Granted, these days that’s mostly the case... He’s got his angel and his family by his side, nothing to fight, nothing to worry about, the best food he’s ever had and tonight... a visit from Hell. But in a good way.
I went with him to get tested immediately and, after finding out I was a match, I donated Stem Cells. He made a full recovery and his gratitude made me feel a warmth I had never gotten from my ‘real’ family. The loving parents I thought I had... They turned out to be hypocrites. When I confronted them and my siblings, they turned on me. Suddenly I was considered a traitor. A sinner even, since I was helping ‘the bastard’.  They washed their hands of me... And to top it all of, I suddenly found myself demoted. Forced by my superiors to ‘take a break’.
“I get it, Cas, I do. I just wish you saw how much you deserve to be happy too. I’ll do this with you. If it means hiding, then we’ll hide. If it means I can never kiss you in public...well... I’ll just have to make up for that in private then. But I'll never leave you. I'll wait. I can do that for you.”
The old man's voice had long become a background noise in Dean’s mind. On the outside he was the perfect, devout catholic everyone perceived him to be. On the inside however... he was listening to Led Zeppelin. He’d learned how to drown out the weekly redundant chatter while he was still a kid in Sunday school. Has to keep up appearances though, if he wants his business to keep thriving in this town.
“You do realise John’s homophobic right? And interspecies relationships? Bet he won’t be too keen on that either. Cas, I don’t want to hide anymore...”
The longer Dean sings, the greyer Johns face gets. He thought he’d go into a rage, but apparently, he’s still stuck in disbelief.
A hand slowly moves down the back of his upper left leg. They maintain eye contact as that hand slides lower, as fingers lightly touch uncharted territory. Dean gasps.
She bats her eyelashes at him, gives him a challenging look. He wouldn’t normally go for someone like her. Too posh. Too slick. She looks like the type that eats ‘boytoys’ alive. Beautiful though... and man, has it been a while. Time for that Winchester-charm to make an appearance.
They end up having a very short talk about Dean’s experience with Cas’ take on couple’s therapy and then Lisa’s gushing about this online course she’s started yesterday. A course Cas recommended her. On building self-confidence and being independent. She’s so excited. He hasn’t seen her like that in a long while. He decides not to have The Talk yet. Not when they both still have a long day ahead of them. Ben’s still home too, maybe he ought to ask his mom if she could take him for the weekend... Yeah... that sounds about right. Gives him a bit more time to figure out how to tell her he’s... well... whatever.
“Still sore I had your boy first, Feathers? Still wondering which one of his talents he learned from me?” He’s enjoying this. Cas... not so much.
“I never meant for anyone to find that. I needed money... back when I was human the first time around. Nudity means nothing to me, so... I just... yeah...”
“Heaven ain’t just relivin’ your golden oldies anymore. It’s what it always should have been: everyone happy, everyone together. Rufus lives about 5miles that way with Aretha. I thought she’d have better taste... And your mom and dad? They got a place over yonder. It ain’t just Heaven, Dean, it’s the Heaven you deserve and we been waitin’ for ya.”
How did this feel good when Cas did it? Oh, wait... lube! He needs lube! Activities are briefly paused as Dean searches his bedside table...Bingo! Time to get this show on the road again!
His tongue flicks out, he licks and sucks until Dean feels like a live wire. If only he’d known about THIS before! Total gamechanger... He actually let’s out the most disappointed noise, when Cas stops his ministrations to go fetch some lube. God, if it were up to him, he’d spend all afternoon on his back with Cas’ face buried between his cheeks. Any reservations he might have had about what they’re about to do, have vanished like dawn to the daylight.
But John’s not giving in... “Really son, that’s just being rude. Why don’t you just hop into the house, help them out and let the men have their drinks in peace huh?”
“Hm... that was Dean’s reaction too. Remember? You sent him to bed without diner, wet pants and all, threw away the pie and fell asleep on the couch while your wife was crying in the kitchen. Do you know that the only reason she didn’t leave you that night was because she was pregnant? Scary enough being a single mom, but a single mom with 2 kids... she didn’t see a way out. But she wanted one. Prayed for one.”
He wastes no time and attacks his mouth once more, puts his hands on Deans for a moment and starts sliding them down his arm, down his sides, dips them down over his hips and settles them on his glorious ass. Releasing his mouth, Cas pulls his hips up and guides his cock into Deans hole. There’s a little more resistance than there was with his fingers, but judging by the sounds, there is no pain. In fact, Dean is practically radiating waves of pleasure once Cas starts moving more vigorously, legs wrapped around his waist and back arching. Soon the room is filled with moans, pants, the slap of flesh on flesh... Remembering their time on the map table, he pulls Dean up. Deans arms wrap around his neck, one hand going into his hair and pulling...hard. He loves it, thrusts even harder and starts whispering in Deans ear: “Your mine now... mine to touch, mine to kiss, mine to fuck...”
The lights are dimmed and the crowd disperses. A familiar tune starts playing and Cas leads Dean to the dancefloor.
He reaches a grassy field and sees a flurry of activity. His whole family is there, putting up tents and tables and decorations... there even appears to be a dancefloor.
They toned down the innuendos, but still acted like a normal couple... touches, kisses, nicknames... just being “disgustingly cute” as Charlie says. And John just seems to allow it. He doesn’t look away, he doesn’t flee the scene... Cas feels weary. It’s the eye of the storm, he’s certain about it. And the shit is about to hit the fan...
“Do I look ok to you? I came here to drink and now I gotta do it surrounded by people who are apparently sooooo much better than me... That sound fun to you?!”
Dean let’s out a most delicious cry. Not in pain, no... he loves this. This show of strength. This domination.
“Aaaah yessss... the start of Dean’s functioning-alcoholic-thing...You guys parted ways a few days later. Never saw them again. Well... Dean did saw Lee again later. Had to kill him for feeding people to a monster in return for wealth.”
He forgets about Lisa, he forgets about his father, he forgets about the lie he’s lived all his life... There is only Cas’ mouth on his cock, his large hands placed on his ass and the man’s eyes locked on his... begging for more.
“What?! No nononono we both completely agreed! Hell, I may have been baiting him to do it, but he’s the one that pushed ME onto the table and we BOTH...”
There’s a laugh coming from behind him. John turns and finds the rest of the family standing there, smiling.
Dean is blushing and suddenly seems very interested in his shoes, while Cas look like the cat that ate the canary.
“No Dean, nothing like that. I don’t require lube for this because my grace makes my vessel vibrate slightly. Hardly detectable, but enough to make your skin and muscles relax. Temperature’s fine by the way. Now let’s see if I can find...”
She’s touching herself now. Starts out slow, teasing... speeding up her movements to follow Dean’s rhythm.
“Well... I’ve been thinking... since you diagnosed me smiting-sickness... is it...can you... canyoufindotherdiseases?”
Cas looks down onto HIS righteous man... even after all these years, still beautiful, still THE Dean Winchester. He loves the way he submits to him. He’s got his arms locked together behind his back with one hand and 2 fingers up his ass and yet, Dean doesn’t move an inch. He’s such a skilled fighter, but makes no move whatsoever. Amazing.
Cas is sitting completely still. Paralysed with rage and desperately trying to keep from hitting John. He glances at Dean and sees he’s turned to his side in a fetal position. The love of his life is trembling and silently crying into the sand.
“Ooooh... that’s what REALLY gets to you huh... Oh my Jack! I have such a great idea! Let’s just live and relive all their crazy sex-capades! Would you like that?!”
And right before he complies, Dean notices a hardness against his thigh. As he spurts all over Cas’ hand, the angel tenses and lets out a low groan, almost a growl.
He always imagined himself having a mayor gay-panic-moment, followed by rage and denial and going back to his normal life, repressing EVERYTHING for the rest of his life. But... is it normal? His everyday life? The white-picket-fence-life with Lisa? Normal for the spider is chaos for the fly...Is it truly normal for a gay man to be married to a woman, pretending to love her?
“Well... hah...” Lisa is smiling timidly and bites her lip, “I’ve been working on improving our sex life. I was so glad we could stop following Father Zachariah’s advice... I mean, no offence, but how was that ever going to help? And after we both had a session alone with you, I felt like I understood our situation so much better. And then Dean arranges for a Saturday where it’s just the 2 of us and he says he has something to tell me... I was so happy that he finally trusted me enough to tell me about his sexuality and I saw an opportunity...and I took it.”
“Huh... afraid of this itty-bitty blade? Surely not... Anyway, no need to worry. Since you endured 100+ years being tortured in Hell without giving in to Alistair’s proposal, I figured physical torment just wouldn’t do.”
“I’m sorry, Lis...” His voice is quiet, just above a whisper. Lisa reaches out and puts her hand on his.
“Well... been a while since I fell for a line like that... you’re not my usual type. Your sort usually doesn’t have the... finesse... to satisfy a woman like me, sweetie.”
The church is packed. Their eyes meet and he knows. Cas is the one he wants. And he’s the one he’ll get.
Things have been tense since he came back. After Jack absorbed Chuck’s powers he brought everyone back and now being more powerful than Chuck ever was, he put the Empty to sleep. Dean jumped on the opportunity to sneak in and “raise him from perdition”. Cas was then presented with a choice: he could go with Jack and reorganise Heaven or he could stay on earth as a human. He gave up his grace without a second thought.
Deans hands are roaming all over his chest, back, ass, thighs... biting his lip, a blush high on his cheeks. He’s never looked more beautiful.
Ok, so... I'm not a good torturer. Not in the tradional sense of the word anyway. Maybe that's why it took me MONTHS to write this chapter... Melly so sorry and deserving of your wrath for that...
Cas surprises him once more, by not using his fingers on his virgin hole, instead placing another one of those soft, wet kisses... right there.
Cas pulls back for a moment. He looks down on the man he’s currently straddling, notices his shiver of lust as Cas’ eyes devour him.
There’s silence for a moment, then Dean clears his throat and says: “Ok look... there’s something I’ve never told you and I have no idea how you’re gonna react, but here goes... I’m bi. Also, Cas and I are very much in love and living together.”
He looks up and sees a young woman standing next to him. She looks... different. Ethereal even. Long flowing hair, all the colours of the rainbow in it...
He manages to smile at her and convince her that he is in fact alright. Bit hot in all those layers... *thank God for all those layers...*
“He was so glad when Sam came back to the fold and it hurt him at the same time. Sam losing the girl he loved the same way they lost their mother... he felt so guilty about that.”
He says it all very quickly, like he just needs to get it out as fast as possible. Sam takes a moment to process. Wow... his ship is canon!!!
After the whole sleepover debacle, John has some grovelling to do... Mary can hardly look at him, let alone talk to him and that just won’t do. Time to dial up that Winchester-charm and sweep her of her feet. Just like the good old days...
Soon, the head-priest noticed and I was called to his office. He asked me all these questions... Was I not interested in girls? Did I ever look at boys instead? Had I defiled myself? I told him no. He then proceeded to explain the physical side of love, what happens between a man and a woman. It made my stomach turn. The mere thought of having someone touch me like that repulsed me and I told him that. He sent me back to class after that.
