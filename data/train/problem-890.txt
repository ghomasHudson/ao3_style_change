“You’ll get used to the sensation,” she explained conversationally, as if she helped men into corsets on a daily basis. Perhaps she did.
Sherlock was still staring at the floor, adjusting himself and breathing shallowly, when John entered the room, clearing his throat.
“This is a date, and I asked you, and so I want to pay. You gave me the gift of your charming and undistracted company all night, not a murder to distract you in sight” John explained with a grin, “and I think someone deserves an award.”
“Strip,” Captain Watson commanded, and Sherlock began shedding his beautiful layers, the suit falling away to reveal his blushing alabaster skin resting beneath.
“Do you want to get up Sherlock?” John asked, receiving a groan in reply, and a practically unintelligible “no” from the petulant younger man. John, in his endless patience, merely rolled his eyes and settled down to doze for a bit longer.
“By the way” Sherlock spoke softly after a while; drawing John’s eyes from the fire back to the young man, “thank you, for saving my life.”
Sherlock, as usual, proved to be a distraction however, with his curls falling in his eyes and an absent-minded hand pushing the curls away as he sorted the texts, his lean muscles flexing as he moved the heavy tomes back and forth across the library, and his joyful expression when he discovered a new novel to read about bees.
“Oh, J-John, I didn’t mean to fall asleep,” Sherlock stammered, his voice somewhat laden from sleep, and John watched in fascination as Sherlock began to sit up and fell back on his stomach immediately, gasping at the confining corset around him and at John’s lust-filled stare. Blushing, he glanced down at himself, tracing one long fingered hand down his side with a timid expression donning on his youthful visage.
Sherlock, unsuspecting of this new type of torment, practically leapt off the bed, and John reached forward to settle his hands against Sherlock's hips and gripping them hard enough to leave bruises. With that, he buried his face back into Sherlock's plush arse, and kept blowing cold air between Sherlock's jiggling bum.
“Shh, we have to make this last,” John remarked lightly, rolling off of the detective to root under the bed, ignoring Sherlock petulant pout and grumbling about John leaving him “in such a state.”
But, like all good things, the day finally came to an end. The two men were exhausted, but utterly and completely happy at the same time. Content.
“Show me Sherlock,” he commanded, and all of a sudden he saw a picture of the young man, wearing new clothing and giggling at Rosie who was bathing in a soapy tub in the kitchen while Mrs. Hudson admonished her for splashing everywhere.
After a while of this, their abilities to control their baser instincts faded away and the two men kissed, nipped, and tugged their way to completion in a messy and hurried pace.
For a moment, John thought Sherlock had fallen asleep, but the younger man moved his head from John’s jumper to meet his eyes for a brief moment, one side of his lips quirking into a small smile.
“Sir yes sir,” Sherlock mumbled with a smile, and John rolled his eyes, the tender moment passing as the two men watched one another in the confines of their home.
“Yes Rosie?” He asked, feeling ridiculous talking to a teacup, but doing so anyways because he didn’t want to hurt the little girl’s feelings.
John adopted a condescending tone and chided, “now, Sherlock, everyone knows that taking temperature anally is best,” biting back a smile at Sherlock’s shocked gasp.
of you, well, that was an entirely new experience. And John seemed to be reveling in it, his hands tangled in the sheets, his legs splayed wide and trembling lightly in pleasure and Sherlock began to scissor his fingers, working John open. As Sherlock leaned down to watch his fingers disappearing inside of his husband, he was struck by the fact that John; noble, war-hardened, masculine John was allowing Sherlock to see him like this, completely lost to his pleasure. Completely trusting.
Sherlock flushed lightly at the memory of his desire to touch the beast, “yes Mrs. Hudson, I have a few pressing questions that cannot wait until morning.”
Sherlock walked dazedly over to the mantle, ignoring his skull in favor of focusing on steading his breathing. Even after the many intimate adventure’s he and John had explored, each time still possessed the thrill of the first touch.
Sherlock thought in retaliation, the sheer humiliation of John walking in to see Sherlock, naked and flushed, no hands on his aching prick but one teasing his pink, hardened nipple and one thrusting a light blue vibrator in and out of his ravenous hole, begging to be taken by a man, well, John might come marching over to wretch Sherlock's hand away, pulling out the wicked, pulsing object himself and-
Gooseflesh had risen on his pale body, and his cheeks suffused with color as John continued to pace towards him in his usual unremarkable manner, wearing a hideous cream jumper.
"Am I going insane? I've only been here one day!" Sherlock exclaimed in confusion, and the teapot and candelabra laughed.
“Who dares enter my castle?” The creature growled from the doorway, his presence masked in shadows, but the imposing figure was not lost to Sherlock’s eyes and he gulped in fear.
John smirked, an idea coming to her mind. Sherlock, with her overactive mind, needed words of encouragement along with tangible action.
“That’s enough out of you, young man. You didn’t eat at all yesterday” Mrs. Hudson reprimanded Sherlock, but he just sighed in response.
John watched Sherlock shadow behind the screen unbutton his shirt in a demure fashion, and he smirked, laying back and watching the slightly obscured strip show with his erection laying high against his black trousers in anticipation for his innocent Sherlock. John palmed slightly at his erection, biting his lip to keep from actually stroking his manhood.
She would sing at parties, and dance with eligible bachelors, and mind her manners at the table. The only rumor John had ever heard was that the princess was not allowed to leave the castle, especially during the time of unrest with the Valwald. No commoner had ever seen her face, or if they had, they had been silenced about it. No one even knew what she looked like.
“No talking. If you need something, you will say one of your colors, and we will slow down or stop. Regardless of that, I don’t want you to talk,” John commanded lowly, steel in his tone, and Sherlock bowed his head without conscious thought to look away from John’s hardened gaze, unused to so much ire from John.
Meanwhile, Sherlock was still panting harshly, his eyes glazed over with pleasure and his spent cock lying wet and used against his shivering thigh.
“I marked three pages of poems that I want you to read aloud, once I give you permission,” John said gently, pressing a firm hand against Sherlock’s back to settle the tensed detective. Sherlock nodded his assent, and John began to pepper tickling kisses up and down the back of Sherlock’s neck and arms.
Mrs. Hudson’s voice seemed very far away as John and Sherlock locked gazes, pale blue meeting stormy grey.
," Sherlock protested between giggles as John tickled his oversensitive body, attacking John with a few well placed jabs of his own until both of the men were breathless from laughing and genuine joy, lying in their bed and overwhelmed in love.
"Where is he? He couldn't have gotten far," Sherlock growled in frustration, tugging lightly at his curls, his mind whirling at the possibilities of where the murder could have gone.
Sherlock slammed the door to 221B behind him, and walked quickly away, trying to stem to prickling in his eyes and the rapid breathing in his chest.
Sherlock saw a flash of scanty lace in her hand, and felt a rosiness growing on his cheeks, cursing his pale skin when she turned around and cooed at his obvious embarrassment.
Always a keen mate, Lestrade nodded with a smile of congratulations on his face, and turned back to Sherlock, refocusing on the issue at hand.
John nodded to himself as he clutched his detective closer, leaning down to place a kiss on his recalcitrant curls; a lesson was in order.
“I’ll just leave this door a bit cracked, shall I?” John asked, ignoring Sherlock’s panicked cries behind the gag, smirking lightly, “and let’s hope our guest isn’t too curious to go looking.”
Sherlock watched the man fall with a quaking body and shuttered eyes before turning to look at John, who had saved him from his own stupidity yet again. He watched to John with a lost expression, his graceful arms limp at his sides, the trembling look on his face sending John running.
Before the transformation, before he was stabbed in the war, an old army mate of his Lord Anderson had come to him with his bastard child in tow, asking John to take her on as his ward, to educate and love her as a father would. John reluctantly agreed, and Anderson left without ever looking back. Rosie, only two at the time, had instantly wrapped John around her finger, and for the Prince, going back to war after meeting Rosie was hard.
-torture for a while longer, sucking slowly, achingly slowly, as they savored the morning in bed. John’s stubble scrapped against Sherlock’s balls rhythmically once, twice, and that was it.
The fervent emotions John held for his young lover were glistening in his softening eyes, expressed in his powerful thrusts and rocks into Sherlock’s vulnerable flesh.
The palace was surrounded with ancient willow trees and sprawling green fields; the nature beauty of the grey structure was starling, and John felt her chest pounding as they rode towards the intimidating edifice. It was a remarkable piece of architecture, and John had never seen such a sight, gulping when Lestrade shot her a “you see?” look, raising his eyebrows.
“Sherlock? What is in the box?” John asked, watching his flatmate’s face in confusion as it warred between excitement and- is that embarrassment?
Closing the door to the lavish suite with a click, John hunched against the door with a quiet groan. That has not gone well at all. Perhaps John had overanalyzed Sherlock’s original reaction when she had kissed her hand.
Once the pathway was clear, the beast glanced up blearily to look at Sherlock, staring at the man in confusion for a moment before his eyes rolled back and he passed out, unconscious on the forest floor.
John felt dawning awareness coming over him the next morning, a strange sensation emanating from his chest. Blinking his eyes blearily, he looked around for the reason he was being awoken.
John was going to have a marvelous time drawing out his arousal until Sherlock was utterly quaking and crying with need.
As John watched his lover fidget under his stare, a slow grin rose to his face as an inescapable plan entered his mind.
He paced over to Sherlock, and with a grin, plucked the detective up from his resting place, smiling at his surprised yelp, and placed him over his knee, his arse propped up in a very reminiscent position.
“I can prove it,” Sherlock yelled in desperation over the mounting volume of the dissatisfied crowd, “show me the beast!”
Sherlock, however, was sitting completely frozen, his eyes wide and his breathing shallow:and after a few moments, John became concerned.
And the hand kiss reminded Sherlock so much of his dream; the beast acted exactly like the man, charming and completely flummoxing Sherlock.
“You know, when I was a girl, my mother had grand dreams of me growing up and marrying to have a family of my own,” John supplied, apropos of nothing.
A niggling feeling of guilt was present, but John shoved it away, rolling over to take a nap and trying to forget Sherlock’s sweet expression.
And so there they sat, in the candle lit room in the romantic setting of Baker Street, with Sherlock squirming on his vibrating dildo, his skin perspiring and his lips pink and plumped from his teething.
,” Sherlock refused to finish his statement, stomping his foot like a child, and John would have none of it.
“I-It was the easiest way the distract him. I’m his type…” Sherlock explained, but John’s grip on his forearms only tightened at this.
“There is one treatment that has proven successful in the past, but it is not for the faint of heart,” John explained with a serious expression, but when Sherlock glanced back to look at him, John’s eyes were glinting playfully.
Walking slowly over to the full-length mirror, Sherlock looked at himself in the mirror with widening eyes.
As the sweet, slightly mournful beginning notes began to play, Sherlock stepped into John’s arms, allowing him to take the lead with a mock-annoyed eye roll, his face split in a gorgeous grin that took John’s breath away.
"You're right, the afterglow is for pillow talk and expressions of sentiment" John teased with a small smile between kisses, "and I asked what you mumbled when I was cleaning you off, but you decided to ignore me" John said with a faux-hurt expression on his face.
Sherlock imagined if the waltz had a name, it would be their song, with a tentative beginning, and a rising crescendo of passion, finally settling into something andante and sweeter.
Sherlock lathered himself in a coconut oil lotion from his face and down his legs, enjoying the silky feeling against his skin and knowing that it would make it soft and slightly glowing.
John looked at Sherlock, who was quiet now, most likely tired from the emotional display and the subsequent discussion, and John knew he needed some time to rest before John started laying out boundaries for their new relationship.
“I promise to love, honor, and cherish you always, and may life and death never part us,” both men repeated to one another in the same moment, their voices melding together, and Lestrade gave them both a smile from where he stood beside them, officiating.
Sherlock took the tea with a distracted hum of thanks, blowing on it once, twice, and then sipping gently and sighing as the sweet liquid poured down his throat.
Her thighs were rhythmically flexing together, uncontrolled by her mind-palace, pumping in blood and a pressure was mounting through her cheeks, chest, abdomen, and, oh god, what….
Sherlock stroked his mane to encourage the beast to calm down, but luck was not with him, as the growls grew closer, indicating multiple animals hiding in the darkness. Wolves, most likely, Sherlock thought, remembering the geographical location and different species of predators in that area.
"Yes, you look feminine and beautiful and utterly delicious," John exclaimed with a wide grin stretching her features and highlighting her button nose, "is this all for me?"
“Princess, I can leave as soon as you wash your hair,” John remarked, making 'princess' sound like a fond epithet.
“Dance with me,” he said in lieu of a confession, and Sherlock smiled and pulled him from the dining room and into the ballroom with gusto, a hop in his step at the thought of dancing, which he had always enjoyed as a child.
John glared for a moment before his lips began to quiver and turn up in an amused expression as well in the face of Sherlock's mirth.
John walked over to the bed, throwing his clothes down and began stripping, unbuckling his pants and shoving them down, standing in only his undergarments. Sherlock watched this with wide eyes, taking in John's strong thighs and his battle scar on his shoulder for the first time, seeing his love mainly naked was disconcerting and arousing in equal measure to the inexperienced young man, and just like with the statues, he longed to reach out and touch the golden skin. John looked up, and seeing Sherlock staring at him, seemingly frozen with his fingers twitching, and he winked teasingly.
As he began slipping them back on, Sherlock called from the doorway, his eyes glued to his phone screen with a delighted expression, “I’ll be waiting downstairs. Hurry!”
Seven o’clock came quickly; Sherlock was sitting on his bed twiddling and wringing his hands after finishing donning on his tux, waiting for John to come downstairs so they could leave for the gala.
After a few more minutes, and a few more wicked fingers, Sherlock was practically hyperventilating, his thoughts swarmed with only the thought of John, and he surrendered to the pleasure, going pliant in John’s lap as he prepared him, knowing that he did not want to hide, even this, from John.
He let go of Sherlock's clammy hand briefly, going to make a spot of tea to calm their nerves and to help re-hydrate Sherlock after all his crying.
Shaking his head, knowing he needed to focus, he watched as they turned once more around the room, finally spying Lord Grey among the guests, laughing and mingling, a dark mirth echoing in his eyes.
John reached over, tilting Sherlock’s head up and pressing a kiss against his forehead in the same moment. Sherlock closed his eyes, taking in the sensation of complete safety here with John.
Sherlock felt one finger coated in lube, then two, invading his body and he shuddered at the familiar pleasure filled sensations shivering up his spine. His toes curled against the carpet as he thrust back lightly onto John’s thick digits stretching his hole.
were called, Greg. I’m staying right here,” John looked around at the sullen faces around her, “after all, someone has to bring these people some fun.”
“Come now, master,” Lestrade said with a smile and a flare of his candles in excitement, “It’s time for dinner.”
Sherlock looked blankly at John for a moment before realizing, “you mean, the cabbie case? That was a year ago today?” Sherlock looked surprised, as if he couldn’t believe John had remembered and he had forgotten. John giggled at Sherlock’s expression, feeling oddly calm in the wake of his pending confession.
John closed his eyes, and Sherlock panicked, digging into his side to cause him pain in order to wake him up and crying out to him.
Sherlock lay next to him, still wearing his ripped and bloodied clothes and breathing deeply, his face relaxed in a peaceful expression and his hands clutching a pillow to his chest, nuzzling into it.
He was suckling on the head, running his hand up and down the length and brushing his tongue just inside the slit that was leaking white precome into Sherlock’s mouth.
“John, please,” Sherlock beseeched, and John met his eyes with a tender smile gracing his features, his eyes crinkled in delight as he continued undressing Sherlock, unzipping the blank trousers carefully and pulling them down in one hasty movement, reveling in Sherlock’s keen as his cock was freed.
“Sherlock, no more deducing. Stay with me, please,” John said quietly, with a serious expression adorning on her normally light-hearted face.
Sherlock shook himself from his daydream, heat flushing up his cheeks as he smiled secretly. John seemed to be obsessed with Sherlock’s arse, so Sherlock decided he would acquiesce.
“John, that's-“ John sucked around the rim, darting his tongue in once, twice, fucking Sherlock’s hips in time with his thrusts. Sherlock tasted heavenly, like his lavender soap and something decidedly Sherlockian. John leaned back, feeling hopelessly breathless as he viewed the pink entrance clenching around nothing, opening slightly under John’s ministrations, just
“Go away, John,” Sherlock ordered, her command somewhat weakened by her voice breaking, “I’m perfectly able to wash myself.”
“Hello mate, good to see you,” the candelabra spoke from his shelf on the staircase in a jovial tone, “but what are you doing here? The Master of this place will not be happy,” he finished more carefully.
Towels ran over his body, cleaning it of the excess water and causing his hair to turn shiny and fluffy, and he glared at Lestrade’s poorly covered laughter at the sight of his softened master.
When the two women paused outside of the council chambers, Mrs. Hudson saw Sherlock’s thinly masked sadness and drew the bony woman into her arms for an embrace. Sherlock stood still for a moment before melting into the affection of her nanny.
Struck silent, Sherlock took a step back and nearly toppled over the vanity. John smothered a smile and continued to stand in the doorway at parade rest, a slightly cocky smile twisting her thin lips.
John allowed the beautiful words, words he never believed he would hear, to wash over his senses and the overwhelming feelings of happiness descend. Sherlock loved him. He loved Sherlock. They had their home back, and a life in front of them that could be reclaimed; a life of crime solving, dinner at Angelo’s
Sherlock glanced at an enormous statue of Poseidon and looked away, giggling slightly at the voluptuous rear present on the statue before the fish-tail began to form on his upper thighs, remembering all the stories he had read about Poseidon as a boy, how he was the king of the sea and fearsome to all who crossed his path, his strength written about in great greek poetry and prose.
“We will talk more once you’ve taken time to rest, and I will have Molly come by later so pick up Rosie so you can, well,
John winked flirtatiously at Lestrade and he chuckled, dismounted and grasping John on the shoulder- both of them attempting to ignore her wince.
“Come now, love, let’s go home,” John said quietly, inwardly smirking at Sherlock’s brilliant flush at the endearment, and the younger man nodded, pushing himself up and waiting for John to do the same.
Sherlock shivered at the thought, knowing that he was more than wiling to let John take control, even if he was slightly embarrassed to admit it. John walking into the library, grabbing him and pulling him up, always gently, gently until he shoved Sherlock down over the table in the center of the room, ripping his pants down without so much as a warning and probing at his most secret place, wetting it with the saliva on his thick fingertips, ignoring Sherlock’s cries for more….
“I need to observe the room,” Sherlock murmured, and John watched as he gazed around the room to find a prime spot for finding Lord Grey.
"Oh, God... Yeah Sherlock" John panted, using his free arm to stroke Sherlock's concave hip bone (too thin- needs feeding up) as the two men groaned, reaching orgasm as one.

‘Oh god, look how beautiful she is, she’s all wet and… Oh lord, just a couple more inches and I would’ve see her breasts-‘ John’s thoughts spun out of control as she quickly walked back to the hallway to stand at attention.
In a truly duplicitous fashion, Mary plotted against the Holmes’ brothers in a terrifying game shortly after Sherlock was saved from Eastern Europe by the Moriarty threat, which turned out to be Mary’s doing all along. After revealing her plot, getting close to John after Moriarty’s suicide and using her fake pregnancy to keep him, she attempted to kill Sherlock, Mycroft and John while they plotted her downfall at Baker Street by implanting a grenade in the flat, which was evaded by quick thinking on Sherlock's part, and although the bomb destroyed most of the flat, the men escaped mainly unscathed. She was caught by MI6 shortly after the explosion, and carted off to a mysterious prison off the coast, never to be seen again to the great relief of John, Sherlock, and the British Government.
“Now, go stand in the corner, hands on your head,” John said, waving one hand and sitting back in his chair with an easy smirk.
“I love you, Sherlock. You saved me,” John cried out in abandon, and grasped Sherlock’s neck, leaning forward and touching his lips chastely to Sherlock’s, reveling in the younger man’s gasp and encouraging the kiss to become deeper, a desperate meeting of lips that had too long been denied. He stroked Sherlock’s sharp cheekbones with his thumbs, feeling the heat beneath them and Sherlock’s rapid pulse when his hand slid down to his elegant neck.
“That’s quite right little one. You’re my good boy, aren’t you Sherlock, and do you know what happens to good boys?” He asked tauntingly, absolutely adoring Sherlock's reactions to the perverse language.
Meanwhile, John’s vision went hazy with the focus of an army captain and a doctor accustomed to critical trauma, focusing in on the murder and only him.
John turned to the window, watching the snow fall and wishing, more than ever before, that he had never been turned into a beast.
Sherlock looked up to meet his eyes, a challenge shining in his own changeable irises, “you don’t have a hint of perfume around you, rather cologne.”
Sherlock huffed slightly in annoyance at his questions remaining unanswered, but stood up at her request.
He sat down on the bed, and buried his face in his hands, feeling utterly hopeless as the tears dripped down.
John leaned down unthinkingly to place a single kiss on Sherlock’s sternum, licking once, lightly, before pulling away. Sherlock’s hands clasped John’s strong shoulders at the surprise kiss, feeling overwhelmed but wanting more, more,
“What do you know of the king?” John asked Lestrade once they were settled down a winding path to the palace. John knew the story- the suddenly orphaned prince who became king at the tender age of fifteen after his parents died in a shipwreck, only to prove to be one of the most politically savvy rulers in the realm. John was curious, having heard rumors from her small village in the western cost that the young king was a cold and unfeeling man.
John spun around from her place at the mantle to see the princess peering at her from across the room with a hesitant expression upon her face.
Sherlock felt his manhood begin to harden again against his will, the vibrations emanating from his hole sending the nerve endings throughout his body aflame while he pinched his eyes closed in concentration.
With a swift move, Sherlock flipped them over so John was beneath him. Sherlock flushed at the memories of John beneath him which usually involved him writhing on top of his prick and moaning loudly, but tonight, tonight was going to be different. They had never tried this way, but Sherlock was confident that it was what John secretly wanted tonight, but it was also something a man such as John would never ask for.
I went to my first Pride parade this year, and let me tell you, it was EXTREMELY liberating. I experienced most of these things at my pride parade (but I left out giving money to male strippers and Drag Queens, because our boys are classy, unlike me). Johnlock is about more than just sex to me, they are a representation of my journey to discover who I am, through the original ACD books and the many adaptations, and I wanted to display that in this chapter.
a friend, a companion. If John was Sherlock’s conductor of light, then Sherlock was the light. The light in John’s darkest days, the light that turned his life around, bringing John back to life twice after his discharge from the army and Sherlock’s faked suicide.
'Of course he would be a bloody natural at this' John scoffed inwardly, finding the virginal detective's natural proclivity towards sexual acts both frustrating and unsurprising. After all, if anyone would be a quick study, it was Sherlock Holmes.
The ballroom was brilliantly lit with the summer sun streaming in through the windows and the entire room was covered in roses, with their enchanted rose sitting on a platform between the two soon to be husbands, declaring their love story for all to witness. Sherlock and John’s eyes never parted, two pairs of blue eyes, so different from one another, both shining in the morning light as they were married in front of their family and friends.
Sherlock was tugging on his usual tailored dress pants and shot John and annoyed look, “no, John, this is not ‘just a fundraiser,’ this is a black tie event. You need a tuxedo.”
The fact that he was wearing a black corset, and a pair of lacy black underwear that were digging into the crevice of his bum deliciously was just an added bonus.
“Well I’ve never…. Sherlock Regina Evelyn Holmes, you are not too old for me to put over my knee, and don’t think I wont,” she declared with a fierce glare at her charge. Sherlock paled and her mouth fell open in shock.
“I’m here, bee, I’m right here,” the man said, his voice choked with tears, disbelieving he was holding his son in his arms once more. Sherlock nuzzled further into his chest, the feeling of home washing over him and settling his frayed nerves.
But John, who refused to be called Joan because fuck societal standards about gendered names, John, who went into the army and was promoted despite her small stature and “lesser” gender status, John, who shot a man dead without a blink of remorse but cried watching
Sherlock entered the bedroom, covered in morning sunshine and the smell of both him and John intermingling in the air. The comforting environment settled his racing mind as he began the slow process of stripping off his clothes. Folding them neatly, Sherlock settled on the floor by the foot of the bed, lowing his head and preparing himself to wait.
, oh god!” Sherlock agreed, relaxing back into John’s hold and allowing his lover to grope his body for a few moments more.
The two men finished their meals between nudging each other's feet underneath the table and Sherlock telling an anecdote about a serial killing hairdresser to John's vast amusement. By the time the two men left the restaurant, they were giggling like schoolboys on their way back to Baker Street. John grabbed Sherlock’s hand once again, marveling at how natural it felt with the large, warm hand encasing his own, and they continued their leisurely walk home.
Mrs. Hudson nodded, and watched Sherlock pack the looking glass. He glanced around the room one last time, and picking up his pack and his rose, turned to leave.
“Hello Michael,” John said, sitting down in the chair opposite him and watching as the young man looked up with a small smile, some of the tenseness easing from his shoulders.
The two entered the dining room, and Mrs. Hudson entered from the kitchen entrance riding on a cart with a grin stretching her face.
John came in the next instant, picturing Sherlock’s beautiful face and wild curls in the throws of passion. John's cock continued to pulse as he came down from his orgasmic high, smiling slightly at the thought of Sherlock's body and beautiful mind in his bed, and trying to catch his breath.
Sherlock tried to wiggle free, and John gripped his hip briefly, squeezing sharply in warning as his right hand continued to punish Sherlock in an infantile and embarrassing fashion.
Rolling his eyes at the appalling timing, Sherlock went over and began digging through his discarded dressing gown to find his phone, seeing a text lighting up the small screen.
How Sherlock had never had sex in his twenty five years, John had no idea, but he could admit that he felt unaccountably blessed that he would be the only one to know Sherlock in this way, teach and adore him the way he deserved.
“And maybe you should learn to control your temper,” Sherlock shot back in the same instant, glaring now up at the beast with all his might, his stormy eyes flashing and glowing green in the firelight. John backed down after a moment, realizing that, perhaps just now, Sherlock was right. He sat back in the chair, and stared intently into the fire, pondering over the strange events of the evening.
“You’ve been wounded in battle, recently as they’ve only been allowing women into battle for the past three years due to desperation caused by the Valwald. Your left shoulder was pierced and you most likely suffered from an infection, which caused a long recovery period. The way you hold yourself says battle ready, the way you speak indicates a command of some kind- perhaps a Captain? Either way, it is simple enough to see once you know where to look,” Sherlock dismissed with a wave of her hand, inwardly smug as she took in Mycroft’s tightening jaw and the council members shocked silence.
Mrs. Hudson peaked her head in, carrying freshly laundered clothes, “morning dears! I took Rosie sometime last night, as you were both deeply asleep. But she has been up for hours now and has been asking after you both, and you have to address the staff, master,” she explained, but John was simply staring at her, taking in the sight of his beloved housekeeper, the woman who always treated him like a son, regardless of how cruel he was to her, to everyone who stayed, even after his blood relatives had long left him.
in a way that makes Sherlock heart beat faster and tingles rush down his spine when the beast roars or commands. Ever the prince and the army captain, used to getting his way.
“You don’t speak to him that way, sir, excuse us,” Sherlock said, grabbing John’s arm and walking them towards the exit, ignoring the lord's affronted look and wine stained clothing.
“I bet he or she will love it.” She responded, picking up the chemise and the corset and carrying them out of the dressing room, leaving Sherlock to get dressed.
,” Sherlock huffed out, glancing down to gaze at his erect cock that would be clearly visible if he remained aroused through the day. Which he would, undoubtedly.
While they had played with bondage before, Sherlock felt that this time would somehow be different. More, perhaps, than ever before.
Truthfully, Sherlock wanted a rose because they were beautiful. Their simplicity and deep colors reminded Sherlock of the beautiful aspects of life, like his mother, and his books. He never knew why those particular flowers were so dear to him, only that he had always felt pulled to them in ways he didn't fully comprehend.
Once he was fully seated within his husband, Sherlock looked down to see John’s head to turned to the side, trying to hide from him. Sherlock reached a hand up, grabbing under his chin and moving John’s head softly to face him.
Sherlock hung up the phone, having just ordered John's favorite green curry with spiced chicken and naan for dinner. The detective estimated that the doctor would be home in approximately fifty two minutes, depending on the fluctuation in public transportation that day.
John fucked him in his chair, up and down, rocking his hips in and out of Sherlock’s body. And whenever Sherlock’s moans began to build in mounting pleasure, John would lean forward and bite his earlobe in warning: “do not come until I say.” Sherlock whined but nodded.
Over two stories high, with two floors and armchairs, a fireplace and three ladders, the colors of the faded covers complementing the shining wood of the freshly cleaned room, the library was the most intricate and wonderful room Sherlock had ever seen. His curious virescent eyes poured over the space, half-believing he was in a dream.
“Let me help,” John cried, leaning forward and patting him down, slipping his arm into the man’s jacket while he tried to push John away from his person. He snatched the phone and shoved it up his sleeve as Lord Grey sputtered out his anger.
“Another man, John? I wouldn’t have pegged you for a purple roses type, perhaps he doesn’t know you as well as he thinks,” Sherlock scoffed imperiously, snatching his teacup from John’s outstretched hand and taking a sip despite the scalding temperature that left her tongue aching, still holding the flowers in her left hand in a vice grip.
Truthfully, John was surprised and delighted that Sherlock had managed to avoid coming for such a long period of time. His endurance was growing steadily as they continued to explore their sex life. John smiled as he slide into the cab first, watching Sherlock bite his plump lower lip to hold in a whimper of arousal as he sat on the plug, pushing it further into his already invaded body.
Sherlock thought with a frown, tugging on the riding pants that left almost nothing to the imagination and a purple silk shirt which,  when tucked in, left his arse outlined in the tight trousers, and without the covering of a coat as he had last time. Sighing, and accepting his fate, Sherlock walked out, strolling past a now fully clothed John to grab a comb, sitting down at the armoire to brush out his curls.
"Yes, John, it's always the little things that matter," Sherlock breathed out, leaning forward and pressing his lips lightly against John's, kissing him gently for a moment before John buried his hand in Sherlock's curls and the two men fell back on the bed, kissing all the while.
Lying, covered in his own essence and trying to catch his breath, he heard a knock on the door, "Sherlock? You okay, I thought I heard a shout?" John asked, and once his words registered with Sherlock's unusually slow mind, his cheeks flushed with blood.
The stare off between the residents of 221B was broken by their dinners being delivered, and John gratefully tucked into his meal in order to ignore the anxiety clawing up his throat at Sherlock’s continued silence.
Sherlock glared, knowing that Moriarty was involved with his brother’s disappearance, knowing he was unable to prove it, and knowing he would get nothing more out of the wily man.
Allowing him to lie there for a moment as he calmed down, and stroking over the rosy cheeks, John picked up the detective.
His network of thugs, looters, and murders shouted their approval, going off to find the warden and start the plan in motion.
With that, Sherlock lifted his long legs around the small of John’s back and nudged him forward, the tip slipping in just slightly, and Sherlock groaned from the slight burn and the feeling of having something inside his aching opening.
“Eat some,” John instructed, and when Sherlock opened his mouth to release another groan, John gently pushed the forkful of pasta inside.
Finally, with the jacket off and the fire adverted, Moran clutched at his arm and looked at the pandemonium around him. A dresser was slamming a man’s head in the draws until he was knocked unconscious; a small clock was whipping down the banister with a knife and proceeded to plunge it into a man’s vulnerable neck with a decidedly feminine cry.
for anything to fill up your ravenous hole, even a bit of plastic can drive you mad,” John chuckled darkly as Sherlock whined, his cheeks pinking further from arousal and embarrassment.
“Sherlock, you do know what sort of people who wear those sorts of panties want don't you,” John teased, nipping and licking up and down Sherlock’s neck as he ground his growing erection against that plush, oh so
the curly haired man whimpered, his plump lips forming around John’s name in such a way that John felt his chest tightened in complete adoration at this man who loved him.
The flat was silent except for the sounds of honking cabbies and people chatting down on Baker Street, and John was still looking at Sherlock, trying to decipher if his attentions were welcome by peering into those pale blue eyes.
“Great. I’m going to go make sure it still fits,” John called, already walking up towards his mainly unused bedroom. Sherlock stood, his trousers still unbuttoned as he gaped after John.
"Goodbye Papa" he said quietly, releasing the man and helping him collect his bags and tie them to the horse's saddlebag. Sherlock glanced once more over his father's figure, making sure he was bundled enough for the cold ride through the night. He Sherlock was satisfied, he helped his father up onto the saddle.
"Sorry, darling, you're right," John nodded, making sad eyes at his daughter until she leapt out of her chair and raced over, placing a wet kiss on John's cheek and then Sherlock's.
submissive, being an angel and following directions like a good boy,” John cooed, continuing to stroke Sherlock’s hair in a soothing manner.
The beast, in a final effort, managed to grab one of the wolves by his neck with both paws, and snap it with a sickening crunch. The animal fell, dead, on the forest floor and the other wolves sprinted away, recognizing the alpha species in their fear.
“Shut it, Sherlock” Lestrade commanded, hopping in past the open doorway with his candles flickering in the morning light. Sherlock turned to grin at him, and wasted no time questioning Lestrade about the history of the war paintings in the South Wing.
“J-John, I must-“ but any protest that would be uttered by Sherlock was cut off by his sudden gasp as John swiftly pulled down his trousers to rest just below his bum.
“John let me go,” he said, taking in his father’s confused expression and correcting himself, “the beast, John. He is nothing like he seemed on that first night. He was-“ Sherlock paused, trying to think of a word to describe his enigmatic friend, his face turning up in a bittersweet expression, “understanding.”
Sherlock’s genius could occasionally be overwhelming to the young man, so he used the mind memory technique to sort out his thoughts and memories and then store them away. He can close and open the doors, or memories, at will.
” Moran covered his mouth in the next instant, muffling his protests, and try as Sherlock might, he could not escape Moriarty’s underling.
Unable to walk any further, he leaned against a tree to support his quaking legs. Sherlock panted, throwing his head back and gripping his hair in frustrated arousal, as the sensations around his cock only grew more fervent, wet, and more, more, more. His cockhead was continuing to leak precum steadily into the now chilly air, and he felt both warm from arousal and yet unsettled. He was being pleasured in a forest, by nothing!  Where was John? John, he needs John.
“Tell me what’s wrong, sweetheart,” John commanded softly, brushing Sherlock's hair and causing Sherlock’s entire body to tense at the endearment, before a few more helpless tears escaped, the younger man feeling confused and tired and just wanting John to help him, guide him. He was so tired of always being in control. His mind was still swirling, and the crying had given him a headache.
John is pulled out of his musings when Sherlock begins kicking, rolling back over and sprawling on top of John, his hair like a bird’s nest against John’s mouth and his boney ribs poking into John’s hip in the process.
"I love you too, Sherlock," John chuckled to himself, feeling self-satisfied and unbelievably content..
As John put the kettle on and set two tea cups out- Sherlock’s stark gray mug and John’s RAMC- John turned to peer at the man in the sitting room.
“One day,” he muttered, walking out the door as Siger dropped his head in his hands, looking completely lost while Mycroft stood on, looking murderous but lost as well.
“I-I never thought you would be a-attracted to me, let alone love me the way I had grown to love you” he admitted in a whisper, “But John, you must know that after all this time, you are the only person I have and will ever love. I-I want to be with you, like you said, all that is....good.” Sherlock finished haltingly, peering at John shyly through his thick eyelashes as if waiting to be rebuked.
John’s eyes widened as more alabaster skin came into view until Sherlock slipped his soft white shirt off his shoulders and threw it carelessly behind his chair.
Then John thought of Sherlock, and what he was receptive too. Sherlock was receptive to him, so if John encouraged Sherlock to see the good in himself, he would be encouraged to do so. But how to get Sherlock in a position where he couldn’t deflect or refuse? Hmm….
“I-It’s nothing John,” Sherlock placated unconvincingly, cringing at his own unconvincing lie and turning around before he could look back at John, walking straight into his bedroom and closing the door with a click, leaving John standing in the living room in confusion, before rolling his eyes and going to make a cup of tea and ignore his moody flatmate.
John swallowed, “you’re beautiful,” he whispered lowly, and a tremor ran through Sherlock’s flushed body at John’s praise.
John flipped Sherlock over, nudging him up the bed and leaning back to look at his naked back, his arse framed by green silk, hiding Sherlock’s pink rosebud from his gaze.
Moriarty and his gang of violent minions were known for their ability to cause petty crimes and get away with them, and even though everyone knew it was their fault, there was never any evidence to convict them.
Sherlock slowed his pace, walking with Philip through the wintery night to travel home. The journey would take close to a day walking, but Sherlock was content to take his time and try to regulate his breathing, his mind in chaos.
Sherlock read the sloppily written note in John’s doctorly rushed script three times, and then folded it gently and carried it, along with his bags, into the bedroom.
“It is my great honor to declare you married, under God and this great nation, you may kiss each other,” Lestrade declared, his voice booming with pride, and their few guests erupted with applause. John tilted his head up, moving his hand to stroke through Sherlock’s curls as he captured Sherlock’s pliant lips in his own, moving them gently against one another a handful of times before they pulled away, resting their foreheads against one another and smiling.
John slide down the bed and, before Sherlock could even make a deduction, pressed her lips in a wet, closed mouth kiss against Sherlock’s lower lips. Sherlock’s hips thrust off the bed in shock, but John grabbed her, keeping her face buried in the short curls and laughing gently against Sherlock's cunt from her reaction, causing Sherlock to moan from the vibrations against her most sensitive area.
But after last night, and his feelings of complete heartbreak at the realization that John would date men, but not him, it forced Sherlock to recognize the truth.
But one sculpture, in particular, caught her interest. She slowed to a halt in front of a severe, coldly beautiful marble bust of a young woman. Her beautiful visage was frozen in a scowl, her full lips turned down in displeasure, as if she loathed the fact that she was being sculpted.
Sherlock began to do just that, a quick study as he watched John’s reactions, just a bit clumsy as he was only used to pleasuring his own cock and not someone else’s.
Sherlock glared down at the (warm, gentle, sure) hand clutching her wrist and John let her go after a moment.
“Of course I did, I love you,” Sherlock pronounced decidedly, stating a fact, but his eyes were tearing up once again, looking into the soft blue eyes and small grin on John’s face, and realizing he would never be without him again.
John stood up and went to get ready, curious as to what Sherlock was doing but shaking the thought away, writing him a quick note and then going to grab a quick shower.
John quickly unbuttoned his already wrinkled trousers and pulled them down along with his underwear, leaving Sherlock sitting in the chair completely nude, his glistening back rubbing against the leather of his armchair.
Sherlock flushed slightly at that, huffing to cover up his embarrassment, "come now, John, it was just a couple of cookies."
John moved his hands from Sherlock’s face and hair to his sides, holding him steady as the two men traded whispers of sentiment back and forth in the comfort of their home. A heat began to grow in John's body as he kissed the man he loved, and as much as he wanted to continue kissing the gorgeous man, he knew that he couldn't move to fast.
“Sherlock, dear, it's time for your bath,” Mrs. Hudson announced, clapping her hands together. She looked around the room for a moment before turning to Sherlock, “Sherlock, why is John stationed outside instead of in here with you?”
“Let me down this instant, or I will have you punished for your insubordination!” Sherlock quietly hissed, but John simply brought the princess closer to her body and shushed her as if she was a child.
Wiping himself down, and sighing his relief, he discarded the washcloth and walked back into Sherlock’s room, turning off the light only to be greeted by the sleepy-lidded pair of blue-green eyes staring back at him.
- sitting on the bed, wearing only a thin paper examination gown with cartoon bees littering the practically translucent fabric. John had already checked his vitals; measured his pulse (elevated), peered into his pupils (dilated) and inwardly diagnosed Sherlock as healthy (aroused).
John huffed a put-upon sigh, a smiled fighting at the corners of her lips, “yes, I will attend your meeting with the King, for what good it will do you.”
Moriarty and his right hand man, Moran, came to the door and knocked. Sherlock swung open the door in a fury, his face set in a stony glare, but Moriarty only smiled in delight.
Sherlock's hands reached down to lift her purple skirts up to pool around her knees. Was it always so hot in her bedroom?
John bit down on Sherlock cheeks just as he increased the vibrations, listening to Sherlock fall apart once again, staining the pillow beneath his hips with his release.
He was sat in an armchair in the foyer, in front of a roaring fire with Sherlock’s cloak still covering his torn clothes and wounded body.
Sherlock cried, but it was too late, John was pulling him over to the couch, settling Sherlock over his knees in a swift motion, propping Sherlock's bum high in the air, much to the younger man's dismay.
“People of Sussex, my father was telling the truth,” he shouted, and the townspeople and minions scoffed and laughed in amusement at the idea of a beast in the forest.
Sherlock turned over, ignoring John’s huff as his arms briefly fell away from Sherlock’s body, until he was nose to nose with John, staring into his cerulean eyes that were practically overflowing with happiness, his cheeks rosy from warm sleep. Sherlock leaned in to kiss John’s nose, which crinkled slightly at Sherlock’s surprise intentions.
"Papa, do you have to leave again so soon?" Sherlock asked, sitting at the kitchen table with his beekeeping book and watching sadly as his father repacked the bags that had just been emptied a fortnight before.
Siger’s business dealings in London had gone quite well, and he was headed home with the news of a more secure financial future for his family.
“Huh?” Sherlock tilted his head in curiosity, walking up to the painting of the young man and using his dexterous fingers to run over the painting's torn strips, placing them together to get a look at the young man’s image.
“Sherlock, for a late 21st birthday present, your brother ordered you new clothing from your favorite tailor. It should be here by next week, and it has new fabrics, which you should enjoy-“
John swallowed as he watched Sherlock’s downright pornographic display as he drank his tea, and adjusted himself discreetly in his trousers, coughing and glancing away.
Heading toward the desk, he could feel John’s eyes following him. Watching his every movement as he tossed the papers down on top of the other pile, Sherlock stopped and stared out the window with a heavy sigh, “What? What is it?” He asked and turned around on his heels as he stared back at John.
It hurt Sherlock more to see John like this, he wasn’t good at comforting. He knew that, saying stuff would just make it worse. But this was the best he could do for him, for now. John wasn’t fragile, not in the slightest. But he could tell he was beaten up about it, drained and barely making an effort to visit Sherlock. It hurt him, feeling like John was beginning to give up.
Sherlock’s expression didn’t change but it was softer than before, the late bell rang and John was no longer worried about going to his classes. He stood there, this time it was his turn to let out a heavy sigh, “Achromatopsia...I have Achromatopsia, but...Better know as Monochromacy.” He muttered and clenched his jaw, “This is the only place where I can at least have a part of me be normal.” He said with a slight smile, looking down at Sherlock’s hand that was still on him.
John barely knew the guy but he already felt like he could tell him everything, let it all spill out like they had been friends for years. He looked back at Sherlock and could tell that he was really trying to comfort him. Through everything he was saying, it was just a different way of saying it.
Sherlock stiffened up and he licked over his lips with a nod, “I guess so, considering she is there child.” He said and stopped writing a minute. “Yes, yes of course.” She laughed and went deep in thought for a minute before looking over at Sherlock again, he sighed. He didn’t hate Mrs Hudson, she just...Seemed to pop in at the wrong time.
He could tell that his dad was yelling back for him, he just wanted to head home without his dad talking about stupid rugby games. That’s all his father really cared about anyways, he didn’t really care if he failed a test, but because he was in rugby everything had to revolve around it.
“You’re very odd aren’t you?” He asked as he shoved his hands into his pockets again and stared across at him as he calmed down, “Well, I could say the same about you.” Sherlock responded and John grew embarrassed by that, maybe even a bit flustered by his tone though he would never admit it.
He was into a lot of styles lately, still wanting to see what he looked best in but right now he was hating sweaters since they weren’t really ‘in’ amongst his peers. He sat there staring down at his feet before looking at his bedside table that held his alarm clock and sunglasses. He bit his lip as he stared at them and grabbed them forcefully as he put them on with his eyebrows knitted together. It was a part of the routine he hated.
He heads back into his room to get dressed, needing some fresh air to cleanse his system. Slipping on some worn out jeans and striped brown wool jumper, he wasn’t really into fashion, probably because he was worried about matching wrong and looking like an idiot to everybody. And he definitely didn’t want to ask family for help just so he could look ‘cool’, stomping on his dirty red chucks.
Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes didn't have feelings or friends. Companions. No, it was all just useless stuff. Unwanted stuff that cluttered what he needed to keep his focus on. That was probably another reason why he is excellent at what he does.
“What is it?” John dragged out as he sat upright and adjusted his sunglasses on his face, Sherlock didn’t say anything as he went back to his journal and started to write again for a few minutes before it was both time for them to leave.
John wanted to bring something up, that he genuinely enjoyed instead of joining just to hear his dad congratulate him and have interest in. He rocked on his feet for a second as he thought about something.
“My favorites have to come from Nirvana and Metallica, y’know?” One of them said after a few moments of silence within the group and they all became rowdy again. Talking about bands that John liked but wasn’t really into, that had to count as having something in common, right? He kept silent as he thought about a song he liked and felt that it was comfortable to say.
John furrowed his eyebrows, wondering if Sherlock found something or he was bored and needed to bug him, the image of what happened to Mary crept up in his mind, what if he needed help? John turned his attention away quickly from the bottle, the food he was preparing for Rosamund. Knocking it over as he reached for his phone in a slight panic, the warm water spread on the counter and got on his boxers. Seeing the text that he had gotten, 'When are you going to stop by? Lestrade wants to 'check up' but I think he just wants you for an actual conversation since he bores me. Hurry.'
Stepping until it was dented beyond repair, the lens popping and crunching under his feet. He didn’t realize how tense his body was until he heard someone clear their throat and he stopped, the small voice came back and he finally heard his hard breathing, his heart still thumping hard.
He could still feel the guilt, he had his eyes closed in deep thought, but it crawled up his spine and started to nag at the back of his head again, it was awful. He couldn’t deal with his head being cluttered with useless stuff like this, it was a whole year ago. It was done, he did drugs and got caught by John. John was worried, that was it.
The hardest, the worst things that he knows will be coming soon now that she is already beginning to babble. Will be her first words, her first day at school, her birthday...All of it, just knowing that Mary won’t be there to see any of it. How could he let such a stupid thing happen? He could’ve done so much to try and prevent it. Almost every night after that, he’d get a nightmare.
“You don’t have to pretend you know.” He said with the same heavy sigh from earlier and John scoffed, a bit irritated with the way he was acting. John crossed his arms across his chest, “You think that you’ve got me all figured out don't you?” He snapped back.
Right when he thought he saw the back of his head in a distance he felt someone pull his glasses off his face and he quickly looked to his side to see one of the guys his friends hang around. Who, might John add, is a huge prick but he has to be nice. “What the hell?” He huffed and snatched his glasses out of his hands, the guys hair was sticking up with the amount of hair gel he had put in it and was wearing a leather jacket leaving John to wonder what his label was in this school.
Sherlock let out a heavy sigh and John knew what was coming next, “ A few hours? John, we have...All stuff going on and you just want to sit around?” He huffed back and started going through bits of paper from months ago.
John didn’t know what to say about that until Sherlock cleared his throat and pulled away, “Is that what you wanted to hear?” He stared at him and felt tension growing, “Or did you already know that?” Sherlock shrugged, “It was a mere guess about fitting into school since it is a common thing amongst our age group to try and fit in. It was a guess between that or color blindness but both were likely in this case.”
Blind to the world around him and to himself, he picked up the pace as he neared his house, the bruise on his chest thumped in pain along with another unfamiliar pain in his chest. The intensity of it all was too much, this emotion, he was tired of seeing himself as shades of grey.
“You and that posh twat” here he nodded in the direction that Sherlock had gone, “I know what you’ve been up to.”
“Other than me you mean? No, I don’t mean that. I did love him. I just couldn't live with him any more.” Anthony looked sadly down at his hands resting on the desk. “I can’t think of anyone. People liked James.”
Sherlock looked up at this, slight annoyance tracing his brow. “From the road?” He scoffed “Hardly. Sher-lock Hol-mes” he stretched the syllables of his name out in what John suspected was a sarcastic manner. John folded his arms. Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes. “Your head office called me in. For this.” he gestured towards the skeleton.
“I thought you might like it.” Sherlock suddenly sounded unsure of himself. John looked up and caught a flicker of something sweep across Sherlock’s face, before just as suddenly it was gone and he looked cool and slightly remote again. “I want to get a look at McAlister’s body again. I only had a brief glimpse earlier.”
“This pub was the best place to find out who our dead man was.” Sherlock rubbed his fingers along his forehead, “This is where the road protesters hold their meetings.”
John sighed and let Sherlock take over the questioning. He was brusk and precise. John pulled out a notebook and busied himself with jotting down Anthony’s answers. Unsurprisingly, Sherlock’s deductions in James’ flat turned out to be unerringly correct. Anthony and James had been dating for 4 years and living together for 3. They’d moved to Northlew for Anthony’s work.
John pushed ahead of Sherlock, deciding that he should intervene before more photos of the dead were flashed around. “Morning, we were wondering if we could ask you some questions?” The woman looked up from where she’d been playing some kind of coloured stacking game on her phone.
“Fine. Let’s go then.” John said as he shrugged a jacket on. Sherlock turned and started to lift a leg to the window frame. “Not the window, you madman. We’ll go out the front door. Anyone would think you were trying to evade capture or something, honestly.” Silently, Sherlock followed him out of the bedroom door.
Sherlock straightened back up to his full height, a gleam of triumph in his eyes. “James McAlister. Brilliant. Now, what can you tell me about him?”
John looked around the dim, wood panelled pub, and then back to his pint. “It’s fine I guess, so far. The ale’s good anyway. The work isn’t quite what I was expecting.”
Sherlock leaned across the counter “I’m new in town and don’t know anyone here yet. Have you been here long?” he asked.
The neighbour continued, “In there with that ponce. It ain’t right. I’m going to take it up with the landlord again. I shouldn’t have to put up with deviant orgies. I’ve got kids.”
“John! What are you still doing here? There are too many people around here as it is. You’re not needed. Go and help Tony do the surveying of the site.” He pointed over to where Tony was setting up the surveying equipment.
John didn’t know. He jumped as Sherlock slammed his hand against the pub door in frustration. “It’s closed!”
John shrugged. “No hurry. Maybe we can work out who wrote this by their reaction when they see me wearing it.”
, as John’s mum would have said) had dark hair pulled into a messy bun on top of her head, and a septum piercing, which was probably fairly rare in a small Devon town. She looked as though she was in her early twenties, and desperate to escape.
John glared at the man, and pulled himself up to his full height. “Having children doesn’t give you the right to be an ignorant, bigoted prat,” John said before pushing his way past him and racing down the stairs to catch up with Sherlock.
next to him in the taxi. He was so close that John could smell his cologne. It smelt fancy, expensive. Sherlock was well out of his league. Sometimes, John didn’t even bother putting on deodorant. He trailed his fingers along the bottom edge of his jumper, self conscious. Sherlock directed the taxi driver to pull up outside a pub on the high street called the “Cock and fiddle.” He slid out of the taxi, leaving John to pay the taxi with a hasty tenner that he managed to find in his pocket. There was no change and John grumbled to himself as he stepped onto the pavement and looked up at the pub sign. It showed a disgruntled looking cockerel standing on a violin.
Sarah’s grin grew broader “It means some road building executives are going to be extremely frustrated in the very near future. If the tests show that it is prehistoric then that road won’t be being built for a very long time. And you and I will have a lot of work on our hands. This’ll be a full dig. We’ll probably take over the entire farm.”
John reached for the vest, holding it up so that he could read the back. Some of the team had been writing their names on the back of their vests so that it was clear at a distance who was who, and to stop others stealing them when they lost theirs. On the back of Molly’s was her name written in her own loopy writing, and then underneath someone had added ‘whore’ in capital letters. It looked vicious. John sucked in a breath. “Bloody hell,” he exclaimed.
Philip seemed stunned for a few moments, mouth opening and closing in shock and anger. Then he visibly gathered himself, turning pink in the face with barely restrained rage. “What do you think you’re doing?” he yelled, rushing towards Sherlock once more. He looked for a moment as though he was going to grab Sherlock, but at the last minute he stooped to pick up the papers instead, clutching them to his chest.
“I’m not going to, obviously I know not to contaminate a crime scene. I’m going to smoke this,” at this he waved a cigarette in the air “over there.” He pointed towards the break hut.
Eboracum Archaeology Ltd. was a commercial archaeology company. Commercial archaeology didn’t quite match up to the childish fantasies that lived in John’s head. In EU law any new building project had to have an archaeological survey done to make sure that precious ancient history wasn’t being needlessly destroyed. If the survey showed anything that might be potentially something then an actual archaeological dig had to be conducted to investigate.
“No I didn’t. Doesn’t mean I can’t appreciate it though. Molly’s annoying, always going on about that MSc she did.”
I wrote this whilst sheltering from a colossal thunder and lightening storm in the middle of a French campsite. It was most conducive to my finger-words.
“Jesus!” John spun around, splashing both his hands with the tea. He cursed again. “Where did you come from?”
“Hello girl,” he reached down to stroke her. She waggled even harder and tried to lick as much of his skin as she could reach.
Sherlock paused his pacing to stare at John straight in the face. “It was nice of you to swap vests with Ms. Hooper, but you realise they’re probably just going to deface her new one as well. Pathetic.” And with that he spun away and stalked towards the finds hut, presumably to find Sarah and berate her over the laziness of laboratories that closed over the weekend. John watched him go and then reluctantly turned back to his trowel scraping.
John had only signed a contract for six months work. He wondered to himself if he’d want to stay for longer if that’s the way it went.
John had meant did he want to come over to the cabin, have a cup of tea and talk further there. But Sherlock seemed to have missed this social cue, going instead for the literal meaning of the question. Oh well. John started walking towards the cabin. It was too cold and too early in the morning for this. They didn’t bother locking the break cabin so when John got there he had no problem getting in, filling the kettle with bottled water and flicking it on. Whilst he searched around for some clean mugs he thought back to the strange encounter he’d just had. How had Sherlock known he’d been in the army? No one else had ever looked at him so intensely. He’d felt seen, for the first time in a long time. He made the tea and his thoughts switched to the rest of the team. What would they make of Sherlock? What would Sherlock deduce about them? He grinned to himself as he thought about Philip’s possible reaction. This was going to be great.
“John, you work the wheelbarrow this afternoon. Ines, Olle, you can continue clearing the West corner” Philip said as he started towards the fence marking the edge of the site. “I’m just going to check the paperwork in my car, I’ll be back to check on your progress later.”
The next day dawned bright and sunny, or at least, as bright as Southern England in October ever seemed to be. By 8 am John found himself kneeling by the skeleton with Sarah at his side. “Okay, so what we’re going to do today is finishing clearing the mud from the edges of the bones, and brushing off the loose soil using, well, these brushes.” She grinned at him. John picked up his trowel and started clearing some of the mud carefully from around the fibia. Sarah settled by the skull and began brushing soil from it with a small round brush. She had obviously decided that having gotten him alone now was the perfect chance to quiz him about his life. “So, what brings you to Devon? Have you always had a burning desire to dig around in mud and rain?”
“Oh, it would be wonderful if it was a burial. This is my first dig since leaving uni.” said Molly, looking over at where Philip was digging with a wistful look on her face.
John was feeling slightly out of his depth. “You invented it? It’s not a standard thing? What is it?”
John spent the taxi ride into the centre of town anxiously questioning his decision to follow Sherlock. And rehearsing in his head how to ask him if he wanted to move into his house. He should have been thinking about the dead man, he knew that. But he couldn’t concentrate on that. Not when Sherlock was sitting
As a child he’d had a small obsession with archaeology. He’d eagerly watched Time Team, read archaeological magazines, binged on Indiana Jones, and had dreamt of one day working on a dig, maybe discovering some unknown Egyptian tomb. What he hadn’t expected was a constantly damp English field with no cabin, no toilet and no equipment except one spade and one wheelbarrow. Two pieces of equipment amongst four people. It was ridiculous. Not that anyone was getting to use either at the moment. John risked a glance over at where Philip was sheltering alongside Ines and Olle. If he was a better field supervisor they’d have the proper equipment already. As it was they’d spent a week taking turns with the spade to slowly remove the topsoil from their field. That was when they weren’t sheltering under trees when it rained, which was often. John was damp and fed up.
Sherlock gestured at the flat, “Two people used to live here, but you can see spaces where possessions have been removed. Quite recently too, otherwise the gaps would have been filled. There are condoms in the kitchen drawer, but right at the back. Thrown in there during a tidying spree, probably months, or even years ago. They weren’t needed because of an ongoing committed relationship. McAlister didn’t break it off. He was dumped.”
“Obvious, John. Did you notice his hands? He had flecks of coloured paint and marker on his fingers. As well as a few splinters. Clearly he’d been making signs. And then there was the CND badge he had pinned to his jacket. So, a conscientious man. Clearly cares about the environment if his vegan shoes are anything to go by. And he’s been making signs recently. What events around here might warrant signs? The road protest. Obvious.”
. It’s not that he’d forgotten the mess that his left shoulder is, more of a deliberate attempt to push the knowledge out of the forefront of his mind. It’s an attempt at forgetting, at best. Normally he keeps it covered. This is the first time that someone non-medical has seen his shoulder since the accident. John’s fingers itch with the desire to pick up a blanket, or his t-shirt and cover his body. He ignores the impulse.
John was sheltering under a tree. He tried his best to shuffle further beneath the branches. It was a futile attempt to avoid the downpour. The tree really didn’t offer much protection at all. He sighed, pulled his hood further down over his face and glared at the heavens. The heavens remained indifferent, letting loose their seemingly endless torrent of water. It was better than glaring where he wanted to though. He wanted to glare at Philip. He blamed Philip for the fact that the only shelter they had from the rain was a tree. When John had applied for this job, he’d assumed that it would be organised and fully equipped. At least, at the very least, he thought they’d have some kind of cabin.
He looked up, found John’s eyes and grinned a smile of pure excitement at him. John felt his stomach flip over. “Cannibals! In Devon. Oh it’s delicious” said Sherlock. John giggled. This got Philip’s attention.
“No, I meant no because I have to go to work. It’s bad enough that I took off after you yesterday but at least the site was shut down. It’ll be open again today, so I need to go to work. Aren’t you supposed to be working on the skeleton anyway?”
“Oh yeah, my guys love me.” Mike said it jokingly, but it was true. Mike’s team did love him, because he was a fair supervisor, friendly and just such a nice bloke it was impossible not to like and admire him. Mike looked at John with concern etching lines around his eyes. “Look I’m sorry I couldn’t get you assigned to my team. We were already full. I’m sure things will get better once the project gets going a bit more.”
John was nearly at the end of his second pint when Mike entered the pub. He spotted John and came straight over to join him. “John! What are you drinking?” He bought them each a pint before suggesting they move over to a table. John picked up his drink and joined him.
“John. Don’t fall asleep, come and help me turn him over.” Sherlock waved at McAlister’s head, “I want to have a look at the back of his head.”
“No you’re not” Sherlock replied “Oh, you’ve been working as one. Well, as a site assistant, which is the lowest position, so barely counts at all. But it’s new to you. You’ve been doing this for a month, maybe two.” He paused, looked at John’s left hand, then his left leg. “How long were you in the army?”
“Boring” replied Sherlock, bending down towards the body. He got his phone out from his pocket and started taking photos.
“Oh.” He pulled his t-shirt on. “Wait. Why do you need help? I saw you pick a lock perfectly well earlier.”
“I think so. See the colour of the bone? And how parts are worn away? Philip’s possibly right - I think it could be prehistoric. Which is very very exciting” She grinned at John.
“Amazing” John breathed, his mouth working before his brain could catch up and advise him on the merits of the idea.
She looked up at him, “I don’t know his last name. He works over at the library though. Why, what’s he done?”
John ground his teeth at this unprovoked attack. There was no need for Philip to point out that he was the bottom of the pile. He knew that. Everyone else knew that.
“Yeah, I think she was on Radio 4 a couple of months ago. She worked on the Kosovo mass graves didn’t she?”
When John next woke the room was in darkness. He shifted to his side to look at his digital clock. It read 1 am. He’d been asleep for over ten hours! He was lying on top of his duvet, in only his pants. The room was cold and goosebumps prickled across his skin. It wasn’t this that had woken him though. He had a keen feeling that there’d been a noise, or something. Suddenly there was a scrape in the far corner of his room, the one furthest from the window and therefore the darkest.  He was sure this was what had probably woken him. Heart beating faster John slowly raised himself up on to his elbows, took a breath and looked into the corner. There was a tall, dark outline there. The outline of a man standing at the edge of the bed. Before John could even say anything the outline stepped closer, and into a patch of moonlight coming from the window.
“Good deduction” drawled Sherlock sarcastically. “Do you know who he is? Is it one of the archaeologists on this dig?”
John pushes himself up, so he is fully sitting. He leans over and turns on the bedside light. This won’t do, he’s still lower than Holmes, having to look up to meet his eye. He gets to his feet. With the extra height the bed offers he is now looming above Holmes. John clenches his fists, one after the other. He glares at Holmes. The man clears his throat, and his eyes drop suddenly from John’s face to skitter across the rest of his body. Too late, John remembers that he’s only in his pants. His first impulse is to cover up, but he ignores it, squaring his shoulders instead. It’s his room and he refuses to be cowed. The tension is thick as they both stand staring, but not talking. Eventually the silence gets too much for John, so he breaks it once more.
, thought John to himself. After all his planning, he’d just panicked and blurted it out at a completely random moment. He back-pedalled, “I mean, um, move in with me and Jess. In our room. Our
By the end of the day the possibly-neolithic skeleton had been fully photographed, sketched, measured, and finally carefully removed and bagged. Sarah was arranging a courier for the next day to pick up the evidence bags and take them straight to the office laboratory.
Too late, he realised that they hadn’t arranged where they were going to meet next. And he didn’t even have his number. John thought about chasing after him, but his leg was hurting, so he just turned and re-entered the pub.
John had spent the whole of Monday evening thinking about Dr. Holmes, and how he could connive a way to spend more time with him than he’d managed so far. Sherlock was the most interesting thing to happen to him since he’d arrived in Devon. He needed to speak with him more. But the man didn’t stay still long enough at the site to talk to for long. And who even knew if he’d be returning now that the skeleton was being sent away.
, he thought to himself as he took a long drink from his tea. Jordí snorted and went back to his phone. Molly, again, gave John a sympathetic smile. Somehow, the pity of such a mouse of a woman did not make John feel better. Not for the first time he wondered what the point of every moment in this day was. He’d thought leaving London would solve his problems. He’d thought leaving behind everything about himself would help him forget what he’d lost. But nothing was different. Maybe he hadn’t moved far enough. Maybe he should have left his cursed name behind as well. But, really, wasn’t the problem that he was here at all? Yes, he thought, that was the problem. There was no escaping himself, and his own thoughts. The rain drummed harder on the roof of the cabin.
Sherlock didn’t seem to be listening. He was staring back at the skeleton and rubbing his chin thoughtfully. “And then there are the deliberate markings on some of the bones.” He paused, ran his hands through his hair one more time and then declared “I’m done with this. You can pack it up and send it off now.” He waved his hand vaguely in the air. “I need to think about it.” He turned swiftly and strode off away from the site.
Molly was trying hard not to cry, gasping in breaths, her voice shaky “Why would someone do that? I know no one likes me but…” she trailed off helplessly, looking again at the vicious word scrawled under her name.
indications” he cried, the glee apparent in his voice. At this he spun back round and headed towards the skeleton, nodding to indicate that Sarah should join him. John followed just behind, unable to resist.
“Yes, thank you for that.” John sighed whilst rolling his eyes “I know that, doesn’t make it hurt any less.”
“Dr. Beachman? Please tell me that not everyone here is a complete idiot. I don’t have the time to pick up the slack for all of you. I’m due in Poland next week.”
Sarah huffed out a breath that she’d been holding whilst chewing on her lip. “I don’t like the look of it. Before we bag up the bones I think I’m going to have to call the office for some advice, or maybe the university.”
“This is a morning of drama,” said Jordí, before sipping from his mug. He put the mug on the floor at his feet and then patted John on the shoulder, “Bad luck for you seeing this thing, no?” John winced, Jordí had managed to put pressure right on his shoulder wound. “Oh, sorry” Jordi added.
When they got back to the shop they found it closed. Probably the woman had been so upset to discover one of her customers was dead that she’s shut it up for the day. Sherlock sighed heavily in exasperation. “This is going to take
“Two things. One: my hotel is horrendous. I doubt she can do anything about that, but it’ll make me feel better to get it off my chest. Two: and more importantly, the lab is being too slow getting the bone analysis back to us.”
A detective wearing plain clothes arrived some time later, and popped into the break cabin to tell everyone to stay where they were. The police planned on interviewing everyone before they could go home. Sarah offered the office cabin to them to conduct the interviews in, an offer the detective accepted gratefully.
By the time Tuesday dawned he’d come up with what he felt was a solid idea. John was feeling optimistic, with a bit of a spring in his step. He had a plan. He was going to ask Sherlock if he still hated his hotel. That was his in. The house that he and Jess were renting had a spare bedroom. There was no reason that Sherlock couldn’t stay in it for the duration of his stay. John had decided that he’d ask him today. He would. The day was sunny and crisp again, a perfect day for taking chances.
By late afternoon John had “found” four more tree roots and if possible was feeling even more disillusioned with the job of an archaeologist than he had before. There was something particularly depressing about digging slightly darker mud out of the ground with a spoon only to have the hole taper to a point and reveal itself as a place where a tree once stood. He’d just written “Appears to be an old tree root” into the analysis box on his form when he heard voices coming from over the hill. Eager for any distraction from his endless tree ghosts he stood up to see what was happening. Coming down the hill and stepping over the electric fences bordering the field were four new people in tellingly clean clothes. They must be the newbies thought John, starting to walk towards them. There was a pretty woman with brown hair tied into a pony tail, and three men, all sporting beards in varying lengths.
“A bit, not much” Not as much as I would have liked, John thought. “What does he do exactly? He said he was a consultant forensic archaeologist.”
Breaking into the undertakers had been surprisingly easy. It turned out to only be a 15 minute walk from John’s house and Sherlock had picked the lock in less than 5 minutes. “Easy,” Sherlock scoffed as he led John inside. It was a small undertakers and McAlister was the only body there, laid out in the steel cold storage unit. Sherlock had rolled him out with a dramatic flourish. McAlister lay on the tray, still fully dressed. John watched as Sherlock pulled out a small magnifying glass and started peering closely at the dead mans face.
“You can’t smoke here.” John couldn’t help staring at the way Sherlock’s fingers moved over the packet. He had lovely fingers, long and expressive. His hands looked strong, his skin soft.
Wheelbarrowing the mud away from Ines and Olle was hard work. Especially in the rain. John started to question his life choices. Six years of medical school, he thought, and this is where you ended up, well done Watson. Of course he hadn’t told the company he had a medical degree. He’d thought it likely they would reject him as over-qualified if he had.  He’d mostly stuck to the truth though - had mentioned the army, though not the reasons for his discharge. He thought army training made him sound fit enough for the physical work of an archeological dig. He hadn’t quite expected this level of physical work though. As though underlining his thinking for him, on this last thought his footing slipped on the crude wooden runway to the discard pile. He stumbled, his left foot slipped off the plank, the wheelbarrow tipped. John and wheelbarrow fell sideways into the mud. John just lay there in the mud for a few moments. Neither Ines nor Olle seemed to have noticed, which was a small mercy. Sighing, he rolled over and got to his feet. If possible he was now even wetter than before. Miserable, John got back to work for the rest of the afternoon.
Sherlock shushed him “Keep an eye out for Sarah coming back.” He hummed to himself as he started going through the dead man’s pockets. John started to shift anxiously. This was making him nervous. What was Sherlock doing? Just as he started to think to himself that he should drag Sherlock away from the body before he contaminated it any more, Sherlock stood up.
“Right” said Sherlock as he rolled the tray holding the body back into it’s unit, “That’s us done, let’s go.”
The library was a small, one storey, red brick building in the centre of town. It had large windows, originals from when it had been built in the 19th century, that made the inside bright with the morning sunshine. Shelves lined the walls, with extra bookcases making aisles in the middle of the room. To one side was the children’s library, obvious with the story-time rug and bright drawings stuck over the walls above the shelves. In the adult side were a couple of wooden desks and red leather armchairs. John liked the look of it. He felt regret that he hadn’t thought to explore it sooner. There was no time now to browse the shelves however, as Sherlock strode straight up to the main desk and slammed his weight down onto his hands in front of the startled man who sat there.
When he woke to the shrill beeping of his alarm John’s mouth was dry and his head felt discombobulated. After turning off his alarm it took a couple of minutes for his scattered mind to align into one overwhelming thought -
“I’ll just take some samples”. At this Sherlock pulled out some cotton wool buds and started rubbing them across various parts of the body - in the head wound, under the nails, around the inside of the mouth - before slipping them into individual plastic bags and putting them away into one of the mysterious inner pockets of his coat.
John didn’t know what to make of all this. It was too much. It was too early in the morning to deal with enigmatic strangers who correctly guessed the reasons for the ending of your cherished army career and then asked to borrow your phone. “Um. Sure. Here.” he said handing it over. Honestly, he couldn’t think of anything else to do in the situation but just give in and go with the flow of it. Holmes took the phone with another quick smile in John’s direction. He quickly typed out a message and then gave the phone back to John.
Sherlock got up and went to look at the bell plates next to the front door, “Mr. Pringle. What a very fitting name. Homophobia isn’t very surprising in a town this small. I hope this isn't just a hate crime. How dull that would be.”
John thought about this, remembering the way that Sherlock had looked him up and down and had seen that he’d been invalided out of the army. It was amazing. Had been amazing. He hoped fervently that it would take him more than four hours to work out what had happened to the neolithic skeleton.
“You’d still be seeing her if you found it in any way useful. You only went at all because you were made to. Army injury. Psychosomatic limp, obvious that you’d have a therapist, just as it’s obvious that you’d hate the idea of needing one. So you probably quit as soon as you were cleared to.”
He was facing away from Sherlock and so didn’t see the triumphant smile that crossed the man’s face.
Jordí turned to him and gestured towards the door, “Oh, I was being, how do you say - full of the drama.”
Sighing, John looked at his watch. It was a few minutes before noon. Lacking anything else to do he decided that he might as well get started on his lunch. Olle and Ines had already unpacked the rye bread and cheese slices that they shared every day, and were eating them gloomily whilst muttering in Swedish to each other. Philip was on his phone. John sincerely hoped he was ordering them a cabin, but thought it more likely he was continuing the argument he’d been having the last three days with his girlfriend. John reached into the inner pocket of his coat for his sandwich. It was cheese and tomato, and the tomato had soaked into the bread, making it soggy. Great, just great, thought John to himself, a truly damp day, through and through.
“Ridiculous. If I were closer to London I could have done it myself. Instead I spent the whole weekend being bored out of my skull.”
“This is why you really brought me, isn’t it? So I could do the heavy lifting” John grumbled as he grasped McAlister’s shoulder and arm and pulled him over so he was lying on his front. It was difficult and John shuddered as his hand slipped on McAlister’s jacket and brushed against the cold, dead skin of his neck. Sherlock ignored him and started examining the back of the head with his glass. He poked his gloved fingers at the matted hair.
He found him outside, smoking a cigarette whilst leaning against the small wall separating the front garden from the pavement. He raised a single eyebrow at John in question. John sighed and sat on the wall next to him. “Got distracted by one of McAlister’s neighbours. Charming bloke. Accused us of engaging in an orgy.”
it. He complained about it all the time, in his own head and to other people. But, it still hurt, this confirmation of how unimportant to the work everyone considered him to be. He closed his eyes as he took another sip of coffee and concentrated on keeping his breathing slow and even. Jess didn’t notice, taking her bowl of cereal over to the table and fiddling with her phone. When John opened his eyes again he caught Sherlock staring at him. All of his frantic energy and attention were honed in on John, his blue eyes locked with John’s.
John leaned against the wall and watched as Sherlock started sniffing the corpse. He was very thorough. He started at the head, spent a long while sniffing around the corpse’s lips before moving down the body. John yawned. He could feel his eyes trying to close. It was too early for concentrating.
Sherlock bounced on the heels of his feet impatiently, “You don’t know anything that I haven’t told them already. Do you really want to wait here, with
Sherlock made a vague gesture with his hand, not answering. “There was no sign of a limp earlier, when you ran over to confront me.” He paused, scanning John whilst he fiddled with something in his pocket. “Ah ha!” he suddenly cried, making John jerk and spill the tea over himself again. “Psychosomatic.”
This caused Jordí to look up from his phone. Like Molly he’d also arrived the day before just in time to see the discovery of the bone.
Sherlock ignored John’s question, and just kept going with his complaints. “They claimed it upset the maid. Honestly! She must have seen worse. Especially when you factor in the fact that the man who had my room before me was a sex and porn addict.”
John Watson hated rain. He hadn’t always had such strong opinions about it. In fact, he would go so far to say that until a week ago he’d been rather ambivalent to it. That was until he’d moved to a town that seemed to have been built under a permanent rain cloud. It was Wednesday and it was raining, of course. It was raining hard. It was the thick kind of rain that hit the ground with so much force it bounced back up again. The kind of rain that it was impossible to stay dry in.
When John left the cabin with the two mugs of tea he was surprised to see that Sherlock was no longer near the skeleton. In fact, John couldn’t see him anywhere on the site. He paused, slowly turning in a circle. Nothing. He walked out towards the equipment cabin. Maybe he was looking for some tools?
“Impressive. You see how she’s lying on her front? With her legs twisted?” John nodded again. “That’s unusual for a burial. I don’t think this is a burial. There don’t appear to be any grave objects either, so it’ll be difficult to age the bones until we can get a carbon test done.”
After finding that Sophie had very little information to share John had limped his way up to the library. Only to find that the library was closed on Mondays. He peered through the windows into the darkened room beyond to see if perhaps Sherlock had broken in, but there was no movement. He tried the door, and finding it locked, gave up. He limped home.
Sherlock paused where he was attempting to pick the lock of the door of James McAlister’s flat to stare at John.
Sarah meanwhile had phoned 999 and reported the body. “The police are on their way” she told them “And an ambulance.”
John had some qualms about all this searching through somebody's private stuff. He’d expressed this to Sherlock on the way to the flat, who had instantly dismissed his worries, pointing out that McAlister could hardly mind, being dead as he was. John made his way into the bedroom. The bed was unmade, a jumble of tangled sheets and duvet. There wasn’t space for much else other than the bed, just a smallish wooden wardrobe against the wall. Halfheartedly, John opened the wardrobe and looked inside, still feeling bad about going through a dead man’s things. There was nothing in there but clothes in boring shades of brown and grey. He thought about looking under the bed, but decided his leg wouldn’t be able to take it. Probably wasn’t anything under there anyway. Instead he went back out into the living room. Sherlock was standing in the middle running his gloved hands through his hair. John felt his heart skip a beat.
John shook his head “You’re a dick” he said, going back outside to try and find Molly, picking up his high vis vest on the way.
“Sorry mate,” said John looking to where Sherlock was disappearing down the stairs. The man was blocking his way in the corridor.
Philip had gone, if possible, even redder and was spluttering. John thought he probably didn’t know what to say after such a quick-fire attack from a stranger. A significantly taller stranger. Sarah looked amused. “That’s right” she said, extending out her hand for Sherlock to shake. “Dr. Holmes? The office called me this morning and told me you were on your way. I didn’t expect you to be here already.”
John shrugged. “It’s not so inaccurate. My army mates always called me ‘Three continents Watson’. I’m sure I don’t have to paint you a picture of what they meant by that.”
“So, who did they send? Was it Johnson? Oh, he’s a right laugh. And he’s a great artist, you should see his field sketches. They’re works of art.”
It had taken a very long shower before John managed to wash all the mud out of his hair, and started to feel warm again. He had the beginnings of a bruise forming on his left calf where he’d slipped off the plank, and his ribs felt tender where he’d fallen. Turning off the shower, he stepped out and reached for a towel. He swiped across the mirror to get a look at himself as he towelled his hair. He peered critically at the reflection staring back at him. Looking closer, he traced the deep lines running across his forehead and cheeks with one finger. Not looking his best, he looked old, he thought to himself. But at least all the mud was out of his hair, and it wasn’t completely silver yet, it was still predominately blonde. That was something. Not much, but something. Resigning himself to the ageing process he limped out of the bathroom to get ready for the pub.
They walked together down the high street until they came to a newsagents. Sherlock walked them inside muttering something about small town gossips under his breath. As they approached the counter, behind which a middle aged woman was leaning reading a paper, John was surprised to see a transformation take place over Sherlock. He slouched down a bit to reduce his impressive height and, adjusted his face somehow. Instead of looking superiorly intelligent and curious he now seemed relaxed, open and friendly. Sherlock gave the woman a large smile. It looked genuine, though John was sure that it was nothing but an act. An impressive act though.
“Just go to class, Sherlock.” Those words seemed to surprise him and it just confused John, “I see you remembered my name.” He commented and John was left to felt even more confused with him than before. Wasn’t he just having an episode in the stall moments ago? He didn’t care anymore, he was actually glad that he dropped the whole thing.
John walked into his house quietly, dreading every step since Rosamund was asleep the whole way home. That was usually a rare thing for him, shuffling around slowly as he felt the slow rumble of the wood under his feet and held his breath. Eventually able to lay Rosamund down in her crib and stared down at her for a moment, Mary popping up into his head again. "She is beautiful when she is sleeping, isn't she? I loved watching her over the crib with you." He heard her mutter in the back of his head and he fought the lump in his throat, his hands tightening on the crib slightly and he cleared his throat as he looked straight ahead at the wall.
He was tired of wishing to be something he wasn’t, he stopped at the door, breathing hard and heavy. His lungs stung and he could tell he pulled a muscle when his chest hesitated to rise and fall.
John just sat there and listened to him with a nod, “Well, you’re going to find somebody that you’ll worry about. I don’t think that is unnecessary at all, that is just human nature.” He shrugged and crossed his arms on the table to rest his head, “If anything, that is a necessity. They say two heads work better than one, find someone like you and I think you’ll be able to remember even more.”
The one time, maybe the only time. He did a drug when he knew John would be home in less than thirty minutes. He was on the floor staring up at the ceiling, the table once full of papers and files were all scattered around him on the floor. Newspaper articles cut up and bunched up in his hand, hearing the door click, echoing in his head.
“I might say, those colorful vases almost fooled me too, they seemed pretty intricate. Don’t you think?” John hesitated as he nodded his head, he needed to get out of the conversation before it started up again. What he was trying to get away from, it was nagging at him again and he clenched his jaw, “I better get going.” He sighed out quickly and adjusted his sunglasses as he was getting ready to walk away, “You know, the sun isn’t out enough for you to be wearing sunglasses.” He called out to John as he began to walk, “Why are you always wearing them?” He asked and John’s eyes widened, not turning around as he felt like his heart stopped, like everything around him was going to stop with him and stare at him, he could feel the whole world's eyes on him.
“You’re weak, John. And you know it, it is rather annoying how you put on a little show for everybody like this.” He snapped and his expression was angry, he hadn’t seen Sherlock like this before.
Pushing the doors and walking into one of the stalls, slamming shut. That was something that triggered it, the anger and frustration, today of all days. A Monday, he’s been doing so well with putting up with it. Why now? The anger was burning his skin, pulling off the scarf and  throwing his sunglasses onto the ground. He stepped on them until he heard the loud crack ringing throughout the stall.
He felt a sudden rush of tiredness flow over him like a weighted blanket, as if someone were telling him to just sleep it off and quite honestly he thought it to be the best idea. To just sleep the weekend away; consequently, that would lead to getting yelled at for sleeping too long and constantly having to wake up to eat and do chores.
“Yes, well I am sure you wouldn't be able to tell seeing that you have no experience in caring for antiques such as these let alone tell a fake one from a real one.” He says quickly as he graves it from her hand and looks it over with a heavy sigh, “Italian ceramics are always hand painted, you will be able to see the single stokes that contribute to the beauty and artistry of this piece. But the brush strokes are not visible, the bottom unglazed area is not rough like it should be.”
Sherlock caught John’s appreciative stare and looked down bashfully, “that would be acceptable John,” Sherlock responded, his violinist’s fingers catching on the sleeve of his dress shirt as he nervously straightened his sleeves.
John thought for a moment but quickly realized the futility of arguing with the incensed girl- she bowed lowly and softly said, “yes, princess, of course.”
All of it with her small stature, her fine sword, and her blonde hair swinging in the wind as she smoothed the fine hair that escaped from her face, wiping the sweat and blood from her brow and giving her favor to Sherlock….
John stared at Sherlock’s downtrodden expression, caused from his belief that John would be upset that he had found pleasure in his bed, even if it was only self-pleasure, and decided to take action.
“In fact, later on, I just might,” he whispered into Sherlock ear, biting gently on the lobe. Sherlock felt John’s smug smile of satisfaction when the detective shivered at his threat.
With that parting slot and a final wink, John felt the bedroom, leaving the door slightly opened to into the sitting room to wait for Lestrade.
37 C is the equivalent to 98.6 F (normal/healthy body temperature) for all of us American’s who do not understand how to read Celsius.
Right before she was about to politely correct King Mycroft (and his presumptuous attitude), the doorman announced the Princess of Fairlyn's arrival, and the entire chamber turned to the enormous doorway to see the enigmatic princess arrive.
His eyes flew open. Sherlock sat up on his bed in his darkened bedchambers, looking around the room to see it exactly as it had been when he had gone to sleep- clothes laid on the chair, a now cold cup of tea sitting on his nightstand, the light from the moon illuminating the floor with dancing shadows. But Sherlock could only focus on his dream.
“It’s a type of underwear, but it looks smaller because it doesn’t fully cover your backside. This small section-“ she pointed to the string of silk-“ will settle in the cleft of your backside,” she finished, smiling at him fondly at his naive questions.
Arrogant, obviously a bit public school, and utterly fascinating: deducing John’s military career from his stance, haircut, and slight tan. His family history from a hand me down cell phone.
Around and around the dance floor they moved, Sherlock leading the steps but John very much keeping the two men afloat, their eyes locked intensely, blue meeting changeable grey.
He let out a wet-sounding laugh at his father’s wrinkled face after so many months apart, but soon realized his father’s face was set in one of panic. Then, Sherlock looked to the side of his father and saw none other than Moriarty.
“Oi, you look great! Doesn’t he look great Mrs. Hudson?” Lestrade asked Mrs. Hudson, who hopped up and down in agreement, voicing her agreement.
Sherlock had recently finished his Master’s in Chemistry, and was working as a consulting detective with Scotland Yard. John’s friend Mike Stamford had asked John to seek out Sherlock and find a flatshare with him after coming home from his tour in Afghanistan, and John had agreed.
“Battle of Lochmage or Jucal?” Sherlock asked, her musical voice echoing around the silent chambers as she deduced the short woman who held secrets in her azure gaze.
“Come here John, let me help,” Sherlock begged, and John was helpless against his wish to learn how to pleasure him. Sherlock sat up, moving John to stand between his legs as he pulled the boxers down, looking at John’s erect manhood for the first him and feeling saliva pooling in his mouth at the size; it was above average, and the girth was thick.
Sherlock knew that she wanted to have sex with John, to catalog the many sensations to draw from every inch of John's body, but in order to do so, she knew John, an attentive lover, would demand to pleasure Sherlock in return.
“This castle is amazing!” Sherlock exclaimed as Molly and Lestrade showed him around on his second day in the enchanted castle, taking in the different ballrooms, guest rooms, and paintings that were still in working order. Much of the castle had been destroyed by its master, who seemed to struggle with anger management, but pieces of the castle were left untouched. The history of the place was astounding, predating the Protestant Reformation, it had gorgeous Catholic artwork and classical elements of grandeur such as huge chandeliers in every room and sky high ceilings that had been mainly abandoned due to practicality.
Even lying with John in the comfort of their warm, cozy bed was not enough to assuage his nervousness that Moriarty would come back from the dead, that he would find them and take John away.
“It isn’t the tea, you cock, its you drinking it. Blowing on it and swallowing it down with a moan just like you do with my-“
“What is it, love?” John asked, smirking against the hole and pecking it lightly, allowing saliva to build in his mouth before breaching the rosebud once more with his wriggling tongue, "you asked for a kiss," he murmured against the hole, causing vibrations to race up Sherlock's spine as John continued to kiss and lick just inside Sherlock.
John would happily go down on her knees before the princess; then she would kiss up her bony knees, thighs, and-
“Papa! Papa, you’re home!” Sherlock panted once he reached the iron gate, practically leaping into his Father’s arms, “I missed you! Mycroft wouldn’t conduct any more experiments with me” he sent a short glare to his elder sibling who had just joined their gathering.
“Too true lad,” Lestrade agreed with a hard thump to Sherlock’s back, startling him and causing him to jump back, away from John, in shock. Sherlock turned to glare at the silver haired man when he realized he'd interrupted on purpose, but Lestrade just smirked and shrugged in response, where John just chuckled.
“Leave me Molly. And as long as he stays on the grounds, he may go wherever he wishes, as long as he stays out of the West Wing.” The
There was a beat of silence, before the gang roared in laughter, one man saying, “crazy old Siger, always knew he was a loon. Lost his wife and money, and now he’s lost his mind!” There were hollers and agreements all around, and Mycroft was trying to silence his father, but he would not listen.
John’s mind whispered as Sherlock tucked his head underneath John’s neck once they were settled in the car, and John smiled down at the adorable man beneath him.
Sherlock’s cheeks suffused with color at John forcing him to drink his tea, as if he was an infant, and nudged his hand gently away with his elbow and an embarrassed cough.
With that thought, John pulled out the soft black restraints and watched as Sherlock eyes dilated and his hips gave an unconscious shake at the idea of prolonged, torturous pleasure with himself tied up and completely at John’s mercy.
One step at a time, Sherlock nodded to himself and ignoring the fluttering of arousal in his abdomen, shutting the laptop with a click.
John’s cock from his place in the entranceway of 221B, and John had never seen a more beautiful sight in all his days.
Glancing down at himself once again, he could not see anything around his manhood to stimulate it- yet it still continued to fill with blood, his erection mounting and the head beginning to flush a deep pink with precum beading at the top and slipping down, down, down his cock. Synapses were firing in his mind, deductions and arousal warring for top priority as he was stimulated by an unknown force of nature.
‘Idiot’ swiftly became a term of endearment between Sherlock and John, as they swiftly settled into their abnormal normalcy at 221B. Nights of domesticity where Sherlock was muttering about an experiment involving pig intestine’s and John was reading another crime novel, ‘honestly John, its obvious that the Baker is the murderer, look at the passage about the flour markings.’
As Thrymn nodded once and began to turn away, John impetuously added, “Sir, I have an idea of how I can help protect the family before I leave on the Quest with Lestrade.”
Looking into the mirror now, with her hair down, make-up painted on lightly, and only lacy lingerie to cover her mostly naked body, she knew she looked feminine.
"Sh'lock! Papa!" Rosie yelped, jumping down from the table and running to the two men. John lifted her up with a great swing and held her close, pulling Sherlock in as well, cuddling the two most important people in his life. Rosie then laid sloppy kisses on both of their cheeks, much to the men's amusement, before she allowed herself to be let down and resume eating her breakfast.
John sighed happily into Sherlock’s mouth, “I can’t live without you, ever again,” he murmured against his lips. Sherlock choked off a sob, his heart overflowing, feeling tears welling up in his eyes and trying to blink them away, a few escaping and trailing down his flushed face.
“Glad to hear it,” he answered with a wicked grin, reaching one hand to grasp at Sherlock’s bony hip and the other a finger up and down Sherlock’s crevice, searching for his entrance but in no hurry.
-" Sherlock gasped, arching into the warm, wet mouth that was now suckling the head of his cock. John looked up at him through his short, blonde lashes and allowed his saliva to drip down Sherlock's straining cock, giving it one more lazy suck before releasing it from his mouth with a pop.
He began to grind his erection on John’s clothed thigh, and John looked down at Sherlock with a twinkle in his eye, realizing that Sherlock was not as averse to the spanking as he seemed through his moaning complaints.
John looked down at the curly haired mop of a head on his chest, allowing a few silent tears to fall down his cheeks before sniffling and reaching a hand up to muss the already wild curls.
Whipping his head around, Sherlock peered to the forest path in his wake, seeing nothing in the darkness but wishing that he had a light for his own comfort.
People don’t just destroy things ideally; destruction was fueled by deep emotion, usually hatred. Why would the beast hate the prince…?
The enormous gates were connected to a surrounding wall that stretched as far as John’s eye could see. The granite stones seeming to shine in the glaring afternoon sun as Lestrade and John rode up the winding pathway to the palace stables. Why was such a barrier needed? To keep people out?
Sherlock’s cock, which had gone flaccid during his punishment, began to harden against John’s thigh, and he whimpered at the confusing sensations.
Hello all! I am terribly sorry to have kept you all waiting- life had been hectic between finishing exams, working full time, and some personal difficulties. I'm happy to say I am back and continuing to write this fic, as I have many more ideas and chapters to come. I hope you enjoy this short but sweet interlude. I assure you it will not be the last.
,” Sherlock pleaded as John began to spank down rapidly, his arse swelling and glowing red in the candlelight room.
Suddenly a creak was heard in the corner of the room, as a pale haired man darted forth and through the open doorway.
“Yes John,” Sherlock said in agreement, tugging on his lower lip in nervous expectation, causing it to redden. John watched in fascination before tearing his eyes away.
Said man looked up with a half-hearted smirk, licking his lips momentarily, before reaching up and beginning to undo Sherlock’s shirt buttons one by one, popping them from their holes in a dedicated manner, his eyes never leaving his task and allowing Sherlock to study his new husband’s face. John seemed to be avoiding his eyes, how odd? And he was less demanding than usual, slower, almost more passive...
With that, Mycroft took off towards the ambassador for Nerum, an Eastern Kingdom, while Sherlock glared at his back. James coughed lightly to gain her attention.
Once the door to the flat was blessedly closed and locked, John turned around with a decidedly predatory look on his face to stare at his partner. Sherlock had a lingering blush on his cheeks, and was pretending to be absorbed in his phone as he stood in front of John, briefly glancing upwards to gulp at John’s expression before looking away to maintain an air of nonchalance.
Yes, the blue and white formal jacket please,” she announced, and Sherlock pulled this item out with a grin. He loved the way the coat looked on the hanger, and hoped it would make him appear dashing.
Sherlock reminded him so much of his wife, through his temperament and intelligent wit, often offset by his natural kind tendencies towards others.
John looked first at Sherlock and then at the people around them, who were smiling or nodding their approval, and gave a sigh of relief.
Sherlock panted out, the dual stimulation of John pressing his arousal against the pillows and filling his aching, needy hole causing him to orgasm again, positively soaking the pillow beneath him.
“John, but I didn’t do anything wrong,” Sherlock pouted, not fighting to leave John’s grip (which was telling in and of itself), but John ignored him, grabbing the back of the sheet and ripping it away from Sherlock’s body.
John roused Sherlock from his hiding place under John’s head once they reached Baker Street. John paid the cabbie and grabbed Sherlock’s hand, leading him to the front door and unlocking it swiftly, his mind completely in the zone.
Dismounting Philip, he stared at the horse and then peered back to the castle, “Wait here Philip, but if something happens, run home. Mycroft will discover our whereabouts,” he instructed the horse, knowing that Philip would understand on an instinctual level.
John bristled, watching Sherlock flirt with the distinguished lord, touching him unnecessarily. He clenched his fists and looked away, spotting a half empty wine glass and a wicked idea coming to the forefront of his mind.
“Shh, sweetheart, I’m right here,” John murmured, sliding over to Sherlock’s side and gathering the detective in his arms, ignoring the huff from the cabbie, “we are almost home. Just a little while longer.”
Sherlock began to play a sad tune, the events of the day catching up to him, and despite John cuddling and caring for him on the couch, he still felt a little unwound.
“Well John? Despite my intellectual abilities of which you are well aware, I am not, in fact, a mind reader and you know I find banal conversations utterly abhorrent, so if you could be so kind as to get to the point,” Sherlock demanded in his imperious tone, underscored by the nervous ticking of his fingers on the mug he was holding and the slight pitchiness of his voice.
“Yes, of course. I’m well, thank you,” Sherlock murmured, more subdued, so John shrugged his massive shoulders and went back over to the armchair, picking back up the medical journal he had been reading and tried to restart where he left off about cell research.
“I know,” Mrs. Hudson agreed mournfully, and John cringed as she continued, “John used to be utterly obsessed with running around the castle completely naked, his naked bum and bits on display, interrupting formal dinners and the like. He was such an adorable, mischievous child,” she laughed as she watched John’s face flush up to his ears, matching his beloved’s horrified expression.
John shook his head as he read through his blog, reminiscing about the many ridiculous cases he and Sherlock had partaken in when he first moved to Baker Street. Remembering his first impressions of the enigmatic detective.
“Thank you for your permission, highness,” John teased, pinching Sherlock’s sensitive inner thigh and smiling at his yelp of surprise.
“Well,” Sherlock started, pausing briefly to bite at his lip, thinking for a moment, “I-I feel a little… feverish.”
Settling back down between John’s legs after a moment more, and enjoying John’s rosy cheeks and glistening skin for a moment more, he began teasing John’s cock once more, this time uncorking the slick and pouring it on his fingers while John was busy expressing his rapture.
John watched with a smirk growing, twirling pasta around on his fork and leaning forward to nudge Sherlock’s lips with the forkful of food.
“He’s there John,” Sherlock whispered, and saw John glance briefly at Lord Grey, taking in his fine suit, glass of brandy, and obviously faked chuckles.
John woke up shortly before noon the next day, stretching out his aching muscles and gently nudging Sherlock off of his bad shoulder. The sunlight was shining in the window, indicating an oddly sunny London day.
, what’s wrong?” John cooed gently, his voice gruff with sleep and his eyes crinkling in concern, somehow instinctively knowing that Sherlock needed comfort.
John leaned up, licking the cum staining Sherlock’s abdomen and his neck, cleaning it away with sweet kisses and heated licks, until he finally reached Sherlock’s lips.
Sherlock, in a thoughtless move, raced over the began beating the wolves from the beast’s back and sides, but the wolves simply tore further at Sherlock’s clothing in annoyance and went back to attacking the beast.
When the trousers, socks and shoes were discarded, Sherlock laid on the bed in his tight, black pants; perfectly framing the slender outline of his cock for John’s eyes.
But the hallway was empty. How odd. Still, Sherlock closed the door and enjoyed the brief freedom of walking down the halls of the castle, unsupervised.
“Do you want to play?” John asked lowly, making the request seem more like a demand, and Sherlock gulped before nodding vigorously. Yes, he wanted, so much.
“Right here! And I’ve brought someone else, too,” She said softly, and John turned to the doorway to see Molly and a little girl holding her hand.
Sherlock excited the dressing room a few minutes later, his hair ruffled and cheeks a bit pink but otherwise unruffled, and walked over to where the saleswoman had laid out some more articles of clothing.
Sherlock was his last hope, his last chance to find love. And of course, Sherlock was charming, beautiful, and, worst of all, kind.
“Please,” Sherlock answered instead, digging his fingers into John’s chest as John clutched him closely in the dimness and vulnerability of the morning, “just…. Please.”
looking for a chemistry text, but I am assuming you have something better in mind?” Sherlock said, turning around in John’s arms and allowing himself to be pushed back forcedly against the bookshelf, muffling a simpering moan as a thigh sliding between his parted legs, causing his desire to spiral as he stared longingly at John.
John groaned at the- frankly ridiculous- statement that should be hilarious, but with Sherlock’s genuine and youthful voice, it sounded sincere and bordering on begging.
But now, as Sherlock gazed at these frozen statues and, daringly, let his gaze drop below their waists, he observed in fascination the beauty of the naked human body; the plump and the thin, the small phallus and the large. Women with their breasts and genitalia so gentle, always appearing so soft even etched in stone as they are, and men, with their strong chests and firm-
“You have saved me, so many times and in so many ways,” John admitted, his sweet words seeping into Sherlock’s sex-addled brain, and he smiled, his rosy cheeks deepening in color from John’s unguarded confession.
Sherlock smiled to himself at his sweet husband, so strong and yet so unable to admit when he needed to be taken care of,
Rolling her eyes at nothing, Sherlock sat up and wandered over to her microscope to complete her bacteria-culture experiment from this morning.
Sherlock closed his eyes in mortification; no matter how many times he came in front of John, the pleasure of his body being John’s to manipulate and control so easily irked and humiliated him. Was he really so predicable?
“Well, John, how about a rousing round of gay sex to solidify our pride festivities?” Sherlock asked, half-joking despite his exhaustion, but John merely smiled and shook his head. Sherlock was surprised, as it wasn't like John to refuse sex, but then again the man had experienced quite a life-altering day of acceptance.
After all, they were both weeping for the same reason: relief, overpowering emotions, an all-consuming love that left them both breathless and filled at the same time. Complete.
John’s eyes zeroed on his prominently displayed bum, the corset arching his back and making his creamy cheeks appear more lush were they stood out against the black lace of his panties. Sherlock watched John’s blue eyes take in Sherlock arse and his face flushed anew.
“Shhh, sweetheart, come lie with me,” He whispered, kissing the nape of his neck, and Sherlock nodded silently, some of the tension leaving his lightly muscled shoulders.
Sherlock whimpered from the sensitive touches to her neck and thighs, and felt John grinning against her collarbone, pleased at Sherlock's sensitivity to her touch.
“No one was hurt, Lestrade, but the murder pulled a gun, so I acted in self defense,” John addressed the DI with a hard gaze, and after a moment of sizing each other up, Lestrade conceded with a sigh, rubbing a hand over his tired, lined face and motioning for them both to leave.
No, John decided, the worst part about living with Sherlock was the day he opened the fridge, saw a pair of human eyeballs sitting on top of his leftover Chinese container, and shrugged it off as ordinary. Sherlock had made 221B with its madhouse experiments and explosions and bison skulls normal for John.
“Now Sherlock, there are four bachelor’s that I would like you to pay close attention to tonight. It is imperative that you dance with each of them, no matter how dull,” Mycroft whispered lowly while keeping a pleasant smile on his face as the guests watched the royal siblings descend the staircase with their usual grace.
John strode forward and walking directly towards Lord Grey, stumbling over and bumping Sherlock out of the way, spilling the glass of wine all over Lord Grey’s dress shirt.
“I told you Sherlock, that game is over. Daddy’s had enough now,” he sang with in a twisted voice, “Marriage to
“I’m not going to touch you Sherlock, and you’re not to touch yourself,” he said softly, adoring the confused crinkle between Sherlock’s brow before continuing.
“I wouldn’t have run away if you didn’t try to maul me and scare me half to death!” Sherlock exclaimed in exasperation, still cleaning the wound and glaring at it, as if it was the cause of their problems.
Sherlock ignored the pang in her chest at the thought of John dating yet another vapid man, and turned to confront her, seeing the doctor holding out a cup of tea for Sherlock to take and wearing one of her beautiful smiles that lit up the flat.
Remembering how John was last night, so exposed and vulnerable, trusting Sherlock in that way, it was beautiful.
“Aha! Here it is,” he declared, lifting up a lavender bubble bath to show Sherlock, who merely watched in amazed silence as John poured the sweet, clean smelling bath soap into the hot water, shutting off the taps and beginning to undress.
With an exasperated eye roll, John got up, ignoring Sherlock’s whine, and reached down to pick up the lanky detective, cradling the lightweight young man in his arms as he started towards Sherlock’s bedroom, ignoring Sherlock’s startled gasp at being picked up.
It didn’t take long for him to fall asleep, he let his mind wander a bit longer and it all suddenly took a sharp turn. Heading back the same jaded and dark path it has gone down many times before; therefore, he ignored it. Pushed away all the thoughts as he let his heavy eyelids close, letting the last of his heaviness to escape his mouth and allow him to sink into a deep sleep. Too exhausted to think, to move. Living a double life just added to his stress and exhaustion, he never talks about it because there is nothing to really talk about.
Quietly he walked passed his sisters room, the door still covered in bits of Lisa Frank stickers that they’ve been trying to peel off for years. He walks down the stairs quickly to avoid the creaking noise that echoes around the house. He puts on his dark sunglasses and walks out, locking the door behind him, he takes in a deep breath. Realizing how cold it was becoming out now that they were getting closer to winter, but knows he can’t go back and forth to the house just to get a jacket.
John let out a hum in agreement, Sherlock’s little bursts didn’t startled him like they used to but he is still getting used to them. He uses these to understand more about him, “What language?” He turned his head forward and watched all the people walk around and talk, a part of a world he’ll never be in, not willingly.
John finally got up and grabbed his black backpack before walking away, getting hit with a cold gust of wind right when he opened the door and grabbed a thick grey scarf. He didn’t want a coat because that wasn’t the style he was going for, shivering with face buried in his scarf and hands shoved deep into the pits of his pockets as he walked fast to school. His glasses fogging up pretty bad was not a part of how he wanted his morning to go.
“Hiding yourself, pretending to be someone your not and changing yourself in front of morons is worse than just being you. You’re weak to society and are like the rest of them.” Sherlock was digging deep but John wanted to stand his ground, his fist balled up and he swung right at him.
John shot out a quick apology and his mother sighed out heavily, “Well, breakfast is ready if you’re hungry, and wash up. Your hair is a complete mess.” She said as she walked off and he went back to look at himself in the mirror, now noticing all the cowlicks he had plus the wind from when he was out. He felt his face flush with complete embarrassment as he tried to flatten it, Sherlock and that lady saw him like this? He couldn’t imagine showing his face out there again after he went out looking like this.
John couldn’t help it, he couldn’t hold it in. He just began to laugh, hard enough to make tears well up in his eyes again, his muscles hurting. It has just been an overwhelming moment for John and all it took was Sherlock to confuse him, to distract him. He could’ve sworn that through all the laughter, he saw him smiling back.
Sherlock could see Mary in Rosamund too, all the guilt would flood him again. Even though John had said it wasn’t his fault, he could feel the guilt weighing on him again and it’d make him think back to the time he had hurt John. How he did when Mary died and when he passed out on the ground.
It was rarely ever a problem, he just had to stick his chest out and hold his head high with confidence and pride although wary of others. He just wants to fit alongside Sherlock. He looks up to him in a weird way, not in a sense of wanting to be like him but out of admiration. Wanting to have his confidence and company.
He let out a heavy sigh as he let the tension leave his body and he rubbed his face out of exhaustion, sniffling a few more times. He felt himself getting a cold, he really should’ve worn a coat, he crawled under the covers and began to think about earlier.
John really cared about him, genuinely cared for Sherlock. For him. Since it had happened, John sitting in his usual armchair and Sherlock laid out on the long couch. John, he seemed to act like it was any other day. Like what happened a year ago was something Sherlock had dreamt up himself.
Right away she walked in and looked around, “Oh, Sherlock...All these...These papers and clippings left on the floor.” She said as he started to pick some off the coffee table and stack them up, “Good afternoon to you too Mrs Hudson.” He said sarcastically as he walked back to the desk and plopped down.
“Johnny, why are you wearing sunglasses in school and especially at this time of year?” He asks with a obnoxious laugh that sounded like nails on a chalkboard to John. He immediately went into defensive mode, like a switch has been flipped on and he stood up with better posture, “Because, they were a gift. Why does it concern you?” He asked and he shrugged, “Dunno, just think it’s pretty weird.” He said and it rung like an echo in his ears.
“Nothing, you just seem off today.” He sighed and slowly began to stand up, careful not to wake up Rosamund. He bit his lip as the chair creaked and made Rosamund shift, “But then again...You’re always a little off.” He mumbled and shot a smile at Sherlock before grabbing his coat.
“Yes, that is what I want to do, I want to sit around and spend some time with my child. You forget that I am a parent, I have to care of her. What am I supposed to do? Leave her off with Ms Hudson while we work on a cas- Don’t answer that. You know I can’t just leave her.”
Gritting his teeth, "You need to let go, gradually, just let the pain go. You weren't the cause of what happened to Mary on that night." His therapist said from one of his sessions he had, he put his head in his hands and sat there in the dark. He felt his heart twist and ache, picturing Mary next to him. An arm wrapped around him and staring at him, comforting him silently. He would never imagine something like this happening to him. Slowly he recovered, trying to straighten himself out and push the feelings away even deeper into his heart and lock them there as long as he could until this happened all over again. It had become a normal thing to him, letting it all out in short bursts, it drained him. He was already feeling exhausted once he had laid in bed, staring at the ceiling before he eventually fell asleep.
He rubbed at his knuckles and felt the sting, licking over his busted lip and took a deep breath as felt everything connect together. Piece themselves for him to understand the situation fully, “Sherlock?” He felt the words tumble out, like he hadn’t said the name in years.
The words were for everybody else in his life that knew what he had, feeling bad for him, treating him differently for something so small. Some even talking to him slowly like his brain was so scrambled that he couldn’t even understand words like he couldn’t with color.
He didn't let those type of things get in his way, didn't let it fog up his eyes. Whenever someone brought up having a Mrs or Mr Holmes in the picture (usually always Ms.Hudson was the person that even bothered asking.) He’d respond with, “That would just get in the way of work, pointless mess that would ruin my time in these cases.” But, usually, when there was barely any noise in the flat and he needed to think deeper into the case, he’d resort to his list. Even when he was bored he went to doing his list, even if it was just one or two things he needed to write down. He would still scribble them down on a scrap piece of paper he had lying around.
He shoves his hands in his pockets as they were already getting cold, the wind blowing hard against his face sending shivers down his spine but he walked on. Just needing to wander for a bit before going back home to nagging, he just wanted to walk without thinking, he knew once his parents woke up they’d be furious with him leaving and not asking for permission first.
“Well that doesn’t sound like that bad of an idea and I am sure that Ms Hudson would love to spend some time with her anyways.” He grinned and he could practically feel the signature look he was getting from John, even though their backs were toward each other. He felt a bit of the weight lift off his shoulders as he forgot about it all.
He never tried to show it, especially not around John. John was the one who was heartbroken over it, it was his wife, a person that he loved, the mother of Rosamund. Sherlock stood there in the middle of the kitchen with the papers still in his hands as he stared over at John and Rosamund on the couch.
It all began to irritate him more until he finally made it and found himself looking around for what’s-his-name in school. He can’t believe he already forgot, a name that was so unique that John had to force himself away from it a few times yesterday. Sherlock, that was it, he was looking for Sherlock in the school.
“Go away.” He managed, his voice cracking horribly and he kept staring down at his foot, “I don’t need your damn pity!” He shouted, “I don’t need any of it! Go away!” He was letting the words tumble out without really thinking, the words weren’t for Sherlock.
He groaned as he stretched and looked out the window and saw he woke up before the sun got a chance to, or at least what he thought it would look like. He taught himself to read the shades of outside, even if he wasn’t really accurate, it allowed his conscious to feel more...Normal.
“Well, yes, mostly.” He stepped closer and stood across from John, the bell rang and John didn’t want to talk to another prick. He couldn’t believe what was going on, this whole morning was just a mess. John turned to head out the door shaking his head.
“Of course not! I was...I was just messing with you.” He laughed slightly and shoved his hands deep into his pockets and stared at the ground while they all began to talk to each other again.
Waking up at six in the morning wasn’t his weekend plan but he can’t really find it in himself to just go back to sleep. Instead he gets out of his bed, hearing it creak as the weight from his body is lifted off of it, the shuffling of his feet against the carpeting the only sound in his house besides the constant hum. He heads into the bathroom, the only thing lighting it up is the thin rays of sun shining in through the window, he stares at himself in the mirror, quickly looking away and out the door before he finally decides that he should lock it for privacy.
Weird, weird, weird, so worried about that word. The eyes burned into his body going straight through him, they all know, they can see it written on him. Heart is pounding, pounding, pounding harder, louder. He walks away without saying anything and hurries, his feet slow for a second before they pick up the pace and soon he is running to the farther toilets in the school.
“Dad, I’m old enough to go out now, I don’t need your eyes on me every hour of the day.” He rubbed his hands together and sniffled, his eyes finally wandered to his father’s and he lost his confidence immediately, “I’m sorry, I just...I need to get fresh air, okay.” He slowly walked past his father and headed up the stairs.
God, why did he have to go and say something weird like that? He should’ve just said he liked Metallica or something. He stopped while they all kept walking on without him like he wasn’t even there to begin with.
“He’s just messing with us, Your Song? Are you going to start wearing dresses now like some girl?” One of them asked and John immediately got defensive like a bird puffing out its chest.
“Were you with a girl? Is that it?” His hand tightened on the railing as he felt his face redden and this time it wasn’t because he was cold, he shook his head, “N-No! God…Dad, I just wanted to go out for a little bit.” He said as he headed up the stairs quicker, the steps creaking as he really put his weight into it. Leaving his father to stand there alone as he went into his room and shut the door behind him.
His eyes averted away from him as he clutched at the ice pack in hand, “Do you have any idea how worried you made your mother when she heard you got into a fight?” His father’s gruff voice was all too familiar when he got into trouble, when he almost quit the team.
Rosamund, a baby that was now a part of his life like she was to John, he was responsible for her as well. He felt that he needed to be, if something ever happened to John...He knew almost right away that he wanted to be the one to take care of her. No matter how much it hurt to see the two people he cared about in Rosamund, he wanted it to be him.
“Well, I’m going home. Putting Rosamund to bed and...Taking a break for the day.” He said quietly and tried to slip on his coat, “Just like you should be.” He said before grabbing the rest of his things and heading out. Leaving Sherlock standing there in the room.
It was because of Sherlock, the past few days have been about him. He smiled when he thought back to when he saw him smile in the stalls with him. Maybe, following the one that was paving their own path wasn’t so bad after all.
He did his normal routine, his sister commenting the usual, “You’re such an old man.” She’d say as she walked past and headed out while John was left to grumble as he shuffled his way to his room. Holding onto the towel around his waist so it wouldn’t slip. He pulled on a white shirt with tartan flannel and stonewashed jeans, a pair of socks he had probably already worn a few days ago with his chucks.
John knows his little apology was it going to get him anywhere, he needs to do something more to show just how sincere he is. He wants Sherlock to forgive him, to truly forgive him. But, at the same time. John doesn’t know how bad he had ruined this, not just for himself but for Sherlock to open up more to people.
“John...The case, the case is solved.” He managed to mumble out, John rushing over to him and helping him to sit up. Not quite remembering the words John was shouting at him hurriedly, only remembering the hurt look in John’s eyes. The way he felt the muscles of John’s hands tense up when he grabbed him. His breathing quickening ever so slightly, he was terrified, for him.
“I was just checking in, you seemed awfully quiet for a while and I was just making sure that I didn’t need to-” She picked up a paper that had wet coffee rings on it and grimaced as she tossed it in the trash, “Need to call John.” She said and quickly wiped her hands off on her dress and sat down.
He heard Sherlock’s scribbling stop, which was odd considering the fact that he had been writing in his journal throughout the school day nonstop. He lifted his head to see what was going on, only to see Sherlock staring at him. Again, his face void of anything, he could never tell what he was thinking.
That was back then, merely a year and twenty-two days ago to be exact. Even now he’d do it on occasion, only when he knew John would be out for awhile doing whatever the hell John needed to do outside of a case. Nothing Important, maybe going out to the pub, Sherlock could care less what John did outside their cases.
Sherlock doesn’t eat much, he had learned. Doesn’t much like questions either, he thought when he saw Sherlock’s eyebrows furrow with slight annoyance. “What does it look like? A journal, for now I need a journal to log everything but pretty soon I’ll be able to keep it all in my head rather than on paper.”
He didn't want to risk opening up to another person like that again, even if they really had to pry it out of him instead of him just spilling it out. It would take a lot for him to just tell anybody, even he didn't want to acknowledge all the emotional pain he felt. He took a deep breath and shook the bottle, picking her up again and fed her. Staring off at his phone and sighed, "Guess we're going to see Lestrade today." He mumbled to himself and closed his eyes as he listened to Rosamund's heartbeat. Just needing to know that he still had a piece of Mary still with him. The gentle beat and the small hums from Rosamund as she drank helped him to relax a bit more, he smiled to himself and kissed her forehead. "I love you."
She couldn’t really help it, she didn’t have very many people she could talk to around here. He turned around to face her, “Mrs. Hudson, I really am quite busy at the moment.” He said finally and that got her attention, “Oh, right...I’ll leave you to it then, tell John and Rosamund I said hello.” She said as she walked out and Sherlock hummed in response.
On his way, he thought about everything that Sherlock had said about him. About his ‘friends’, he didn’t really share the same interests, the only thing they had in common was rugby. He didn’t want to believe what Sherlock said about them, maybe he was wrong about this.
“Esse Quam Videri.” Sherlock muttered under his breath, starting John to hesitate in step, “It means to be rather than appear.” He said immediately afterward before John even had the chance to ask, he continued to just stare forward. Taking long strides with his hands in his pockets.
His father finally broke the silent, “What were you doing at this time?” He gestured toward the outdoors with his head, “Is this...Going to be a frequent thing?” He looked genuinely disappointed in John, for some reason, he was upset about him going out.
He hopes that someday, maybe tomorrow, that this film over his ‘true’ vision will peel away and reveal the world he has missed out on. He slowly, very hesitantly, opens his eyes and looks himself over again and again before he accepts that there hasn’t been any change. This game that he plays isn’t fun, completely opposite of that, it hurts him, wringes him dry of a good morning and leaves him bitter. It’s going to be one of those days now.
He felt Sherlock’s hand grip his forearm roughly and he stopped where he was, everything was coming back full circle and he wasn’t going to make him forget. Sherlock’s grip loosened, “I know you’re afraid, you avoid specific conversations about and you hangout with people you don't necessarily want to be around.” It was barely a whisper but to John the words were screaming at him.
“It’s Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes, and I doubt that you’ll see me around. I’m rarely ever there to begin with.” Sherlock sighed and continued walking while John stayed where he was, everything about Sherlock seemed strange, even his name...He hadn’t really heard anyone with a name like that before, he was different and that made John want to chase after him.
John paced around his room and looked out the window a few times, his mother came into his room after a while and watched him as she stood in the doorway. “I can hear you moving around downstairs.” She crossed her arms over her chest and shook her head, John stopped abruptly and tried to conjure up an excuse before she went on.
John walked into class and sat down at his desk, the teacher walked around to set graded work on their desks. John looking away from them, not even paying attention.
All morning he sat there, pins and needles making his legs itch since he hadn’t moved yet. Mrs Hudson came knocking on the door. Not here a big commotion like usual, they always did seem to fuss around a lot like children.
“Really? All of it isn’t getting to you? Well...You are Sherlock, you must know ways of being able to deal with it.” He half laughed and looked down into his lap as he fiddled with his watch, “Have you talked to John at all? About it?” He said as he looked back over at Sherlock. Sherlock was on edge, he was sure Lestrade could see it too, “We’re both adults, John has been coping with Mary’s death and so have I. We’ve...Been on different paths for a while now, yes? I’m not going to treat him like a child.” He snapped back as he looked over at Lestrade, “I don’t quite appreciate you referring to her death as it.” He said and heard a knock at the door, not taking his eyes away from Lestrade as the door opened and he heard the cooing from Rosamund.
He shivered again as he headed down the sidewalk back home, two hours outside without a coat was long enough, he could already feel his nose begin to drip as he walked inside with a sniffle and pressed his hands against his frozen cheeks. His father standing right next to the stairs to greet him with a stern stare and furrowed eyebrows, John standing there to look back at him without saying a word.
Sherlock, he wasn’t lying about going to the same school, he’s felt that he had seen him around before, always alone. He didn’t know what he thought of him, he was different, he knew that. But, he didn’t know what really pulled him in, he never really met anyone like him before. He felt his gut twist just thinking about it and sat back up, already needing some fresh air, his heart raced slightly. He didn’t want to think anymore about it, about him.
Sherlock groaned quietly and rubbed his face with a hand and sat like that a minute, listening to see if she was going to walk away, “Sherlock I know you haven’t left.” She said as she knocked on the door again, he got up and unlocked the door for her.
He knew this was bigger than just a small apology in the office with a few packs of ice, he heard the door freak open, snapping away from his clouded mind and stood up immediately. Hoping it was Sherlock coming back, chest tightening as he was about to blurt out another apology. It was his father, mouth twitched in response to seeing his father in front of the door.
A whole month passed and it barely felt that long, but at the same time felt like years when he was with Sherlock. Sherlock constantly surprised him, the way he expressed things, his jokes, interests, sarcasm. He was always doing something that may have seemed odd to other students, “What is that?” John asked while they sat outside during lunch.
Trying so hard to push Mary to the back of his mind, for now, rubbing the ring on his finger as he walked off to his bed. It was hard, to stop thinking about the one you love. The one you cared so much for, that you imagined the rest of your life with suddenly die right in front of you. Right in your arms with a sad smile, leaving you broken. His whole body tensed up and he could feel the tears coming, he promised himself, ever since she had died that he would be strong for her, for Rosamund. He blinked roughly and cursed under his breath as the tears ran down his face and his body began to shake, the anger bubbling up, the sadness, her face. It was all rushing back like it had happened yesterday, the memories fresh in his mind. He sat at the edge of his bed and wiped off his eyes harshly with the palms of his hands.
Lestrade watched Sherlock a second before moving closer to John so he wouldn’t hear, “Is...Sherlock alright? I know it isn’t my place to be bothering about this but…” He trailed off and glanced back up over at Sherlock, knowing Sherlock wasn’t quite acting like himself. But then again, Lestrade didn’t ever know when Sherlock was acting normal.
“Latin, I can tell you don’t necessarily like being seen with me, John.” He said bluntly and this time John stopped, Sherlock continued a few more steps before he turned around to look back at him. Journal tucked under his shoulder.
John began to shake a bit as he held it all in, once Sherlock had held onto him. He couldn’t help but arm an arm back around him, gripping at the back of shirt and pressed his forehead into Sherlock’s shoulder. He hated feeling this weak, like a child that needed to be comforted. He hated the lingering memories of Mary’s death, the tears started to come out. Taking in deep breaths and grunted as he pulled Sherlock closer. Sherlock closed his eyes, keeping his arms around John tightly, the way he was standing was uncomfortable but he knew John needed it.
It all felt like cotton was being pulled from his ears, every sound he wasn’t listening to before was now surrounding him, “I saw you run in here.” He heard the familiar voice, his foot still firmly planted on his beaten glasses.
you are still there then. i know it won't be the same. but Mary gets to have me in her bed for the rest of our lives.
The men shared a glance. Sherlock pointed with his chin and John nodded affirmation. They shifted and switched places, the taller man edging as close as he dared to the ring of jellies. The short solid soldier followed and grasped his beloved firmly by the waist. Anchoring his hands to the fine leather belt there, its smooth black surface mottled and ruined by the brackish water.
John breathed out with some effort, "Yes. Please." He straightened in the detective's hold and asked a thready question. "Tonight?"
Licking his lips, John tore his eyes from the detective's full, tantalizing mouth. He concentrated and shook his head. "We both could stand to take it in. I'll try to stop being an arse now."
"No more. I can't puzzle things out between us. I can't listen to you play and wonder what you mean. I have so much to tell you, and I want to know what you're thinking, Sherlock. We've let so much silence get between us and steal time we could have had. I can't do it anymore." He shook Sherlock slightly. "You're a wonder, but I need to hear you say what you mean. Please, set that down and just you be here. With me."
Sherlock had said vastly too many words this day. He opened the case and brushed a finger down the hazel belly of his own stately violin.  One more task. It had been the first and would be the last for him in the Herculean labor that John and Mary's wedding had become.
Martha was up on her feet by the time she heard the sound of John's sturdy, measured step upon the treads. When a polite yet insistent knock sounded on her own door she was close enough to open it before the last rap had sounded. Her startled tenant stood there with his adorable daughter strapped to his chest. John Watson withdrew his hand from the air awkwardly. The other held a brightly colored animal-themed baby travel bag Molly had gifted to him.
John held his breath for a second and clenched his jaw, “I...I am unsure, we don’t talk as much so I don’t bother him.” He felt that twist in his heart again, Mary’s face in the back of his mind and he looked away from Lestrade. “You’re right, it’s not your place to be bugging about this.” He shot back, he knew Greg was just trying to help, but right now wasn’t a good time to talk about it. It would probably never be a good time to talk about it, unable to even mention it or hear about it.
Everything was a blur, he didn’t know what he was fighting for or how he even got here in the first place. People were watching, getting a few good swings in before Sherlock fought back.
He walked off into the kitchen and fumbled around looking for a bottle, "I always put them in the left cupboard, remember?" Mary seemed to mumble in his ear and he glanced over at the cupboard, grabbing out a bottle and filled it up with warm water for her, Rosamund calmed down after awhile. Small sniffles coming from her as she squirmed around and rubbed at her eyes sleepily. He bounced her in his arm and hummed. His arm tightened around her protectively as he jumped a bit at the sharp beep of his phone, looking over at the counter and saw that Sherlock was messaging him.
Stumbling over as he got the wind knocked out of him, he pulled Sherlock down with him. His sunglasses falling off his face, he didn’t care if they were damaged he’d buy some new ones anyways. He felt his lip bleed and could see a bruise form underneath Sherlock’s eye.
John finally began to shake as he pressed his face into her and she hugged back, he forced himself to keep in the tear no matter how blurry his vision got. He choked on words he wanted to let out so he stayed silent.
This whole day was just...Off, worse than usual. But, in a good kind of way? He didn’t know what direction he was going in anymore. What path he was taking because he had strayed away so far from the path he was originally taking.
His mind finally wandered back to what Sherlock said and he knew it was his fault, Sherlock’s good at hiding what he is feeling but the outburst showed how he was feeling. Outcasted. His mind void of the physical pain but now it was emotional, he hated the guilt because he knew it was his fault for the outburst and his fault for the fight.
The guy lets out a heavy sigh which startles John when he looks back, “If the bottom were white and smooth then it's not an original Italian ceramic, made with traditional materials and techniques. I am guessing that she is aware that they are fakes but she is just too stubborn to admit it to us.” He hums and John just stares at him, “Incredible.” He comments after a while of just staring and It’s the guys turn to be slightly startled, John cleared his throat and ran a hand through his hair, “I mean...I couldn’t even tell they were fakes, that was fascinating to listen to. But, I didn’t need your help.” He said, irritation obvious in his voice, their eyes meeting.
Sherlock, he was right about this. About them, they don’t understand or care for the things he likes. He took in a deep breath and lifted his head, he didn’t want to be alone, he felt like all eyes were on him now that he wasn’t part of the crowd.
“Apology accepted.” Sherlock said after a moment but didn’t turn to face John, his eyes still on the door as he walked out with the door creaking behind him and snapped shut. John knew that change, it reminded him of his dad when he was upset or angry. He never really chose to show it but was able to tell when his father was like that, he could see the same thing in Sherlock.
“What kind?” Sherlock interrupted and John froze all over again, he felt the nervousness rise, Sherlock wasn’t like them was he? God, he hoped not. “Excuse me?”
He couldn’t seem to focus on any of it, looking out the window and already saw that it was growing dark. He decided that he should sleep, John would come in and bug him about his day and that would help him. He stared at the ceiling as he laid on the couch.
John straightens himself up to look more confident in himself as he felt himself grow nervous, taking off his sunglasses and couldn’t exactly meet his father's eyes. He took them off since the hallway lights weren’t on yet, the light from the window was enough and his mother along with his sister were still asleep since it was early.
Rosamund had John’s expression, her eyebrows knitting together when she didn’t get a bottle or it was taken from her. She had her mother’s smile, she never really stopped smiling and it hurt John. Reminding him so much of Mary and how she’ll never get to see her grow. He knows that, seeing her take her first steps will be hard without Mary with him.
“Wait, where are you going? We have a case to work on.” He said and stayed where he was, frowning at John.
Sherlock took a deep breath, his legs crossed as he sat across from Lestrade with his eyebrows furrowed irritatedly. Looking over Lestrade's posture, he was too relaxed, a little awkward but relaxed nonetheless. It made him grow a bit more irritated since it was John’s chair he was sitting in, he wasn’t about to make a big deal out of it. That would be too irrational, “You don’t really want to talk to John, so just get it out now before he comes over.” He grumbled, just wanting him out of that seat.
It wasn’t him, none of this and yet all of it was, Sherlock was the only one that really knew him and John was the only one that could understand Sherlock. Now John felt like he was on his own, going an entirely different direction than following Sherlock, following what his parents had planned for him. Grey was what he was used to following but now he feels completely blind.
John rested his head on the table, his new sunglasses shifted on his face as he stared at Sherlock with his eyebrows raised, “I know you are smart and all, but, how will you be able to keep journals worth of stuff in your brain?”
He’d find himself waking up with his face on the table and arm still extended out across, limp with his veins still bulging out faint blue. Maybe even wake up with rings under his eyes and spread out on the floor, the room going in and out of focus.
John didn't realize how tense he was until he finally relaxed and saw the mess he had made, spilled clumps of formula mixing with the water on the counter and dripping on the floor, his boxers getting soaked on the side from being pressed up against the counter and Rosamund began to cry again. He sat Rosamund in her chair and put his phone on the table as he rushed to clean everything up and made her a new bottle, he knew it was getting out of control again. But he refused to see another therapist, refused to talk to the one he used to have anyways.
But the way he had looked at him...Like he was afraid that he’d lose Sherlock too, after what had happened. No, he sat up quickly and caused John to jolt a bit, “Jesus, a bit of a warning would be great Dracula.” John huffed out with a slight smile on his face. Sherlock shook his head, “You should be used to it by now after the years you’ve lived with me here.” He muttered back quickly and walked off to the kitchen.
John could feel the tension and Lestrade looked over at him hopefully to say something, John cleared his throat and earned a glance from Sherlock. Waiting for a response from him, he knit his eyebrows together. “Well, hello to you too. You called me, early in the morning to just stand around with you and Greg?” He scoffed and Lestrade moved out of the way as John went to sit in the chair.
It had been a while since he felt like this, since he felt so vulnerable. This was probably a lesson of some sort but he couldn’t quite put his finger on it until he remembered what Sherlock had said to him, Esse Quam Videri.
John didn’t question him, he was just odd in general. As he walked down the halls with Sherlock he avoided the looks he was given for hanging out with him. Even his old friend group avoided him after they’ve seen what he does with Sherlock, he was now fully considered outcasted.
“Sherlock, it has only been a day, wouldn’t...It is nice to have at least a break for a few hours? At least for today?” He rolled his eyes at Sherlock, wanting him to settle down. He knew that he got anxious when he didn’t have something to do. They did have something big on their hands now but they’ve been running into a few dead ends and simply just needed a break for now. After all, he did get to spend some extra time with his baby.
“Excuse me but my Chinese porcelain vases are not fake, they are antiques. This pot right here is an Italian ceramic, I put fake flowers in it to make them look prettier. I sell expensive antiques and the best flowers.” She huffs proudly. John turns to see the guy as she speaks and he seems a bit intimidating in a way, it kind of...Pisses him off. How he doesn’t seem flawed in anyway and he is sticking up for him, the embarrassment he feels only heats up into slight anger.
His vision was foggy and he blinked, hearing the light patter of the tears falling onto the floor. How pathetic, he’s crying? Like some child who fell down, but he’s been falling. Now he’s finally hit the ground hard. He never let any of this come up before, quickly he cleared his throat, regaining his posture and buried it all back down into the pit. Collecting himself and wiping off his face before he cleaned up his mess and opened the stall door.
He stared at them, seeing Rosamund falling asleep in John’s arms comfortably, it was his fault that she wasn’t going to have a mother. John looked back at Sherlock with raised eyebrows, “Well? Aren’t you?” Sherlock snapped out of it and blinked a few times before responding. Unsure of what he had said, “What? No...No time for breaks.” He said finally. Looking away from him quickly and back down at all the papers.
Sherlock was never able to shrug off that pang of...Guilt. What he had done to John, he didn’t think John would care that much. Maybe walk around him or yell at him to get off the floor.
John rose his eyebrows, “How old are you?” He asked with a soft smile and shook his head, “Amazing, it truly is that you can see right through me like that...Can you like...Unfocus on that or turn it off?”
“What kind of shit observation is that?” John huffed defensively and adjusted his sunglasses, he did felt a tug of guilt at his chest. A few people stopped talking and John felt their eyes on them, they were causing a scene.
He swallowed hard, opening his mouth and nothing came out, he heard another heavy sigh and the shifting of feet. “Are...You...Are you fine?” It was a odd way of asking but he understood that he sounded uncomfortable with saying it, like it was something foreign to him.
John wakes up breathing heavily, as if he were trying to escape from something, running for miles and in need of air. His forehead lined with sweat as he snaps open his eyes and tries to readjust to his surroundings. Looking around his room quickly as he sits up and rubs a hand over his face, the remains of his nightmare already faded away from his mind as he sits there, alone in the dark. The dark doesn’t scare him since that is the color he knows best. Black, slightly darker black, grey, and...lighter grey? He doesn’t know or really care. He grabs his alarm clock roughly and pulls it close to his face to see the time.
Sherlock sighed and shook his head, relaxing a bit when he stared at John and Rosamund, “Like I said in the text, Lestrade wanted to check up on us.” He muttered and walked off to the kitchen, “Discuss whatever it is that you need to with John, I’ll be busy in here.” He sighed out, uninterested with whatever he wanted to talk about. Unless it was a case or some clues, he didn’t care. Taking some papers with him to sift through at the counter.
But, right now he just wanted time off from whatever this was. He headed downstairs with his feet now made of stone; body feeling heavier and he slumped in his chair as he let out a heavy sigh. His family looking him over without really saying anything or commenting on his behavior. They put a plate in front of him and let him eat at his own pace before he headed back up the stairs and straight to bed.
“You know what I mean, don’t act like a bloody idiot.” He stepped closer and John could sense the atmosphere change, people were watching and his heart was pounding in his chest. He was feeling fiery, something getting a hold of him on the inside and he swallowed hard as Sherlock spoke again.
“Don’t be, it was merely a test to see how you would work with confrontation.” He said quickly and shoved his journal in his bag, John watched Sherlock seeing a small change in him, “Well, I think there was some truth to your test Sherlock.” He mumbled quietly as Sherlock got up to head out the door, “I am sorry for acting the way I did with my…‘friends’. I’m sorry for annoying you in that way.”
If he admitted it, he did genuinely care for John. The corners of his mouth lifting up slightly and falling every time John would bring up something small that had happened to him on the way back to the flat. Even if he didn't care, he liked hearing him ramble on about small things that Sherlock didn't even bother dealing with.
Sherlock’s journal splayed on the ground and both of their bags somehow torn away from their bodies until a teacher came to separate them from each other. Forcing students to class while John and Sherlock went to the office.
John stayed staring out at the window, Sherlock’s hand stayed gently on his shoulder. He was deep in thought again and couldn’t help but imagine it to be Mary, her gentle touch and the comfort he felt around her. He missed it all, the tears in his eyes were beginning to well up and he held onto Rosamund a little tighter. Sherlock saw the expression, the same one he saw when Mary died, when he faked his death. It hurt him, to see John like this again, he quickly moved in and wrapped his arms around John, keeping his body away slightly so he would be in Rosamund’s way.
“I know you have trouble with telling truth about it in fear or out of anger that people will no longer talk to you.” He stopped to let that sink in for John, he hate to say it but he was right. He wasn’t necessarily angry about it, it just hurt knowing it all described him so closely that he was tired of doing this to himself.
