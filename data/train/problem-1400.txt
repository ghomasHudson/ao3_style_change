This information in and of itself poses no problem for Sherlock; he can take it in his stride—even the captain’s threat that he is surely going to tell Anderson who is responsible for his dramatic change in status isn’t a cause for too much concern (after all, finally stripped of his power, what harm can Anderson possibly do?)—no, what’s bothering Sherlock, if he’s honest with himself, is the feeling that something has been taken from him that he cannot get back.
“Yes, good…” he finds himself whispering to John, encouraging as John did for him, wanting to give John just as much pleasure as he just received.
John looks blankly at Deverall for a moment, as if he cannot understand the other man’s request.
, the nasty little voice replies.
Sherlock lets his head fall back to the sand with an inarticulate sound, and John laughs softly before rolling off Sherlock to alleviate the pressure on his now overly sensitive cock.
Donovan looked over Sherlock’s shoulder to Lestrade, incredulity visible in every line of her face. “You’re not actually letting him go?”
John pulls back slightly to look at Sherlock, his eyes enormous in the low light of the candles. “You may have no experience but I can tell you, as someone who has a great deal of it, you are getting the hang of things very quickly.”
Sherlock tries to take all of this in stride. He supposes this is something he will have to get used to—encountering John’s former lovers scattered across the globe.
“I know,” Sherlock said, and he looked so broken open with remorse John couldn’t stand it.
But as soon as Sherlock has the thought, he realizes with a sharp swoop of horror, that of course John cannot touch his curls—it would cause him too much pain to do so.
Feeling foolish, feeling mad, he shuts his eyes and speaks to the darkness.
It is as though John’s control has slipped—as though whatever it was that was holding him back in the first message has finally snapped and he cannot stop the feelings pouring out of him, raw and enormous, almost incomprehensible to him in their depth.
“Your attempt to seduce me. It worked.”
He rolls over, dragging the sheets up underneath his chin. He squeezes his eyes shut tight, tries valiantly to sleep, because John said so, and John knows what’s best, willing himself not to think about any of it, but when he pushes his face into the pillow he smells John, as sure as if he were there himself.
After a few minutes, however, John comes back. “That was your new friend, Kitty. I told her to fuck off.” John grips his chin. “She didn't sound too happy, hearing you were taken.”
When he's got his breath back, John quickly gets up and takes the bowl from Sherlock's clenched fingers.
They should definitely do that when they meet again.
----------
When John had felt Sherlock starting to tire, he had gently told him to stop. “I got you something.” He had murmured, before reaching under a pillow, presenting Sherlock with the black penis gag he was actually wearing.
A raw scream escapes Mycroft's throat as he slams into Sherlock again and again, until he suddenly goes rigid. He's coming deep inside Sherlock's body, and Sherlock lies perfectly still and receives his load.
His tight pink hole is already twitching in anticipation. His hairless balls hang heavy between his legs.
He yells as he can feel something press inside him.
“Lick his face clean, slut.” John says and Sherlock does, taking his time to lap at Mark's skin until every last trace of John's ejaculate is gone. They stare at each other, and the close proximity allows Sherlock to take in the flush on Mark's face, his stubble, the brown freckles in his green eyes, hooded now from his orgasm, his lascivious smile. He slowly opens his mouth to show the come gathered on his tongue. Mark's grin widens as he lets a thick drop of spit fall from his own lips right into that open mouth beneath. Sherlock swallows.
Tears now openly run down Sherlock’s face. “I don’t know what’s happening either, John.” He gasps.
John decides to ignore him. “Sherlock, what's going on here?”
Sherlock blushes a little and nods, biting down on his lower lip.
He arrives at Leinster Gardens just about ten past eleven. The traffic has been hellish. He knows those empty houses Sherlock proclaims to have won at a card game years ago from some of their stakeouts. They are eerily beautiful by night but rather unassuming and dilapidated during the day.
And Sherlock does, sucking on Greg's swollen hole, spreading his cheeks further apart with his thumbs to reach more of him. He has no idea how long he's been servicing Lestrade like this. His jaw starts to hurt but he knows he's not allowed to stop. He listens to his brother's soft moans over the phone, relishing the feeling to pleasure both men at once.
“That sub he... mutilated?” John avoids Sherlock's gaze and looks over the Piazza instead, watching the passers-by get on with their mundane lives, unperturbed by murder and genius brothers out for revenge.
Sherlock moves and tilts his head a little to look up at John. John gazes into those bright silver eyes that gleam and sparkle once again with life.
“We are out of coffee. And Milk. And almost everything else!” John shouts over into the bedroom from which only emanates a long-suffering sigh in return.
But first John makes him watch as he puts his arm around the man's shoulder and pulls him in for a deep, lazy kiss. He lets his other hand roam down Mark's chest, all in full view of Sherlock, blunt fingers trailing slowly along the waistband of those tight shorts before firmly groping Mark's groin. There's a zip running from the front of those rubber pants all the way to its back, ending just beneath Mark's tailbone. John starts to open it, pulling it down while Mark watches enraptured, his arm slung around John's waist. They stand close together, smiling at each other, and Sherlock feels a sudden pang of something he's not prepared to face or analyse.
“Come on, now play with it.” Mycroft orders as John is finished, and both men watch as Sherlock cups his hands to gather as much piss as possible from the tiles, sipping, wiping it over his face, pouring it over his heaving torso. He knows that he's moaning like a slut but he can't help it, he just loves getting drenched in piss.
“A few hours. We left... a little after midnight?” Sherlock nods in confirmation, despite being unable to remember either the time or how they reached their hotel.
He can feel John untying his legs before he slowly removes the speculum. Sherlock nearly slides off the table, sobbing with gratitude as he is allowed to sit back unto the chair. His anus feels like its been turned inside out, raw and bruised; his insides feel even stranger, squishy and slightly numb. He's exhausted and drained from the overwhelming force of his orgasm, and therefore utterly grateful for the small comfort it gives him when John strokes his hair and wipes his stained face with a kitchen towel, soothing him by whispering reassurances. “Hey, stay with me. You did it. It's nearly over...”
“What happened down there, John?”
Was he really interested in anything to do with Sherlock anymore? Why should he be? After his... demise, his whole live – or what the media had been able to unearth – had been tabloid fodder. It had lasted about a week. John doubted there was anything left he didn't know about Sherlock. It was over. He had to let go and move on.
Sherlock huffs. How is it possible to convey so much scorn with just a little noise?
“To bring you back to your senses?”
Irene takes a long thin cane and goes over to Sherlock's chair while John reclines onto the chaise lounge, Sherlock in full good view in front of him.
Of course, he'd kept tabs on John, especially as he had not attended the funeral, but he'd behaved pretty ordinary. Grieving, yes, but just as expected. John Watson... was... a very ordinary man after all.
“Oh, Sherlock...” John whispers. “You'll ruin your health, your unique mind. You have no idea what you're injecting. The risk of hepatitis, or even HIV...”
But suddenly, the blissful pressure is gone, as John gets up again. He takes a bottle of lube from the bedside cabinet, and Sherlock’s eyes light up in anticipation - that is wiped from his face when he sees what John also grabs: a latex glove.
Sherlock shudders. He's not sure he'll be able to come, not with his nipples and balls stretched painfully and his extremities covered in prickly branches.
-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-
“I know. But these people won't let you near them. They are very suspicious. Paranoid even.” Sherlock sits back up on his heels and holds John's gaze with his gleaming, sea-blue eyes.
“I'd like to watch you while you do it.” John had told him, surprised how steady his voice had been. “Piss yourself.”
John and Sherlock go to Florence. There, they engage in their very own form of gardening...
“It's gone. I had to pull it out to resuscitate you.” John explains. Sherlock nods before he has to clear his throat again, remembering that he can now use his voice.
“Oh, fuck, this is good, so good...,” John sighs before he falls over the edge, spilling deep inside Sherlock's abused, worn hole. He continues to move until he's fully spent, his fingers inside Sherlock smeared with his own come, while Sherlock sobs into his mask in blissful agony. His arse feels on fire, sore, stretched and abused, and he registers with shock that he can't clench his hole. Lube and come ooze out of him, with John's cock still inside him, and he's unable to clench or stop it.
It feels strange and intrusive to go through Sherlock’s old stuff. There are a few books, records, CDs and tapes, note pads, school reports – but nothing personal, no photographs, drawings or toys nor  the typical knick knack one collects as a child and teenager, sentimental keepsakes that one doesn’t need anymore but doesn’t want to throw away either and therefore stores with one’s parents to preserve when moving out. John’s father still has John’s old Action Man as well as snapshots from school trips, drawings, letters he received from Beth Morgan when they both had been in year eight and had exchanged sloppy kisses behind the bikeshed, a box of shells John had collected during a summer holiday in Weston-super-Mare.
Eventually, John takes a few steps into the room, coming to stand in front of Sherlock. He picks up the riding crop, but instead of striking Sherlock with it he puts it aside onto the desk. Sherlock looks up, and even in the dim light his perplexity shows.
“That's a tunnel plug. It leaves you totally open.”
“What?” John barks.
Suddenly, the hand from Sherlock’s hair, holding him in place, is removed, presumably to wrap around Mark's erection. Sherlock can't see it but Mark’s balls hit his chin with every thrust as he hears slapping noises, flesh rubbing flesh.
Only after John has satisfied his need to look and probe for any damage, and has established that Sherlock is still fully functional, once again a plug is shoved up Sherlock's rectum. It's not as big as the one last night, and after this morning's activities, it slides in rather easy. It's flexible, shaped like a cock, but its most striking feature is that it vibrates, controlled by by a remote currently in Mycroft's hand.
“We could bring him down to one of the holding cells some Saturday night.” Greg grunts as he has eventually stilled. “When we have some heavies in. They'd love to fuck the living daylights out of the world's only consulting detective.” He doesn't withdraw his cock, though, but lets it soften inside Sherlock.
But when John removes the weight and twine from Sherlock's balls, his shrill scream breaks the peaceful quiet of the darkened park. An bird flies up nearby, startled. Sherlock whines, tears shooting up into his still blindfolded eyes.
Sherlock can only watch from the corner of his eyes. He's kneeling in front of the couch as both John and Mycroft use his gaping mouth in turns to shove their hard cocks down his throat. They alternate. In between, he has to masturbate them, his gloved fingers slick with lube.
“Remember, no one's to touch you. But you may look your fill.” John's mouth very gently brushes Sherlock's hot cheek.
John kneels in front of Sherlock and gets the ketamine form his bag. He draws up a syringe before swiping a piece of cotton wool drenched in antiseptic over the sensitive skin at the crook of Sherlock’s arm. Sherlock watches, wide-eyed, as the needle sinks into his vein. John can almost immediately see his eyelids droop a little. At least, Sherlock won't remember much of what'll be done to him. The pain perception will be reduced as well.
So must John, because he suddenly removes his hand from Sherlock's cock and just pets his twitching arsehole.
Only, as they reach the pavement outside 221b, Sherlock's arm already in the air to flag down a cab, John feels his own phone vibrate.
The fuse has been lit; it is only a matter of seconds before the explosion follows.
John gave a yelp of surprised laughter and felt some of the tension go out of his body. “I never knew you had such an affinity for champagne.”
He was so busy feeling sorry for himself he’d forgotten the promise he’d made the night before to dedicate all his efforts to uncovering what he could about the captain.
“Before I kiss you,” John says, his voice gone low and dreamy again.
when people tamper with his things.”
He’d never dreamed that John would hear him, he was just so desperate in that moment; he hadn’t thought… well, the truth was he hadn’t been thinking at all.
“You’re right—I’m sorry. God—of course, I don’t regret that. Of course not.”
Sherlock sharpens his quill, uncorks the ink, and then sits staring at the blank page before him.
“There,” Sherlock says with a touch of self-satisfaction.
Sherlock is careful to check the corridor before leaving his room. As soon as he’s ascertained that there is no sign of any belligerent lawyers approaching, he slips out the door, and makes his way to the hatch leading to the lower decks.
By the time he reached the second storey, the darkness was so intense he had to pull his torch out in order to see his own feet. He shone the light through the shadows and saw another row of closed doors lining the corridor, identical to the hallway below. There seemed nothing remarkable about any of the doors on either side of the staircase. John pointed his light directly opposite him and saw at the very end of the hallway, a smaller door, the elaborate ironwork of its lock glinting in the light from his torch.
John, who's been sitting in his chair, sipping a beer and reading the paper, glances over at Sherlock and puts The Guardian aside.
Eventually, John gets up and stands on shaky legs, pulling Sherlock into a sitting position by tugging at the leash. Sherlock's face is red, blotchy, wet with saliva, sweat and John's fluids; his eyes droop beneath heavy lids, his hair is a riot, streaked with precome.
Sherlock tries to move fast, to headbutt that lurking spectre, but he's too woozy and Moriarty not close enough. Instead, an icy hand tightens around Sherlock's throat and squeezes as he's pushed back down.
“Look at this mess...” Acri says, but John doesn't have to be told.
Sherlock's eyes go dark; he hurries to obey John's command.
Only when they reach the footage of Sherlock squirming in agony on the gynaecological chair do they order him to speed up. John grabs Sherlock's hair and pulls him down, fucking his mouth until he gags.
“What are you writing?” Sherlock asks.
He does, though it's strenuous. His head threatens to drop forward as his neck, arms and shoulders start to hurt with the strain they are under.
“John, I'm not a ghost. Please, turn, look at me.” The voice is so soft and pleading that John finally gives in, coming face to face with the tall red-haired woman. She's again wearing her sun-glasses, hiding her eyes, which makes looking at her somehow easier. But that mouth... John can all too vividly remember it wrapped around his cock, moaning beneath him, begging; or distorted in pain, screaming. There are other features, too: Sherlock's mother-of-pearl earlobes, his prominent nose, those high cheek bones one could cut his hand slapping, his slim yet dextrous fingers still holding onto John's arm. Only now, his fingernails are painted in a glossy shade of pink.
Sherlock still refuses as a familiar anticipatory tingle lodges deep in his belly. John grabs his hair as he tries to turn away.
“Ah, of course, that makes a difference.” Mycroft's smile is cutting, bordering on acerbic. “You know, it's been really insightful talking to you, John, thank you for your input. But I think our guests are waiting; and, I'm afraid, they are not very patient men. They’re probably drunk already, too. Therefore, I'd suggest you get Sherlock down immediately, so we can get the party started. I'm afraid their mood won't be improved if their gratification is delayed any further.”
“I think he was. He came all over my face.”
Sherlock nods. John's hands reach around his upper arms and squeeze his biceps. Sherlock has to bite down on his lower lip until he can taste blood, his scream dying in his throat. He rocks slightly back and forth, his body squirming in agony until John starts to suck on his right earlobe. Despite the pain Sherlock can feel himself getting hard again. He calms down a fraction, enjoying the rare tenderness.
But the look fades almost as quickly as it comes as Burns turns to them with a more serious expression. “It’s a good thing you came back when you did—I was just about to send someone down after you. Moore wants us back up on the topsails. Just in case the wind picks back up again. Captain’s orders.”
He holds Sherlock there, hands soft on the curves of his skull, his eyes gentle, full of amazement, before pulling Sherlock in for a kiss.
“Breathe, Sherlock.”
Again, he dreams of the open window—a green scent, like rain and growing things engulfs him, and he turns towards it, aching with a longing that goes deeper than the ache of the fever, and he feels his forehead bathed in cool air.
He wishes now that he hadn’t smoked that pipe with Ferguson earlier; he’s itching for a smoke.
“I wanted to wait until… well, I wanted to wait until we had nicer accommodations… more time, more space. It’s an activity that shouldn’t be rushed. To be honest with you, I was planning to wait until Rio,” John says, his cheeks flushing slightly in a rare display of self-consciousness. “But I realize now it’s silly to wait since we might not have that chance.”
He hears them start up another song and for one long moment he considers standing there all afternoon, leaning against the partition as he listens, as though that will somehow bring him closer to John, but just as he decides that this is a reasonable thing to do, Sherlock hears the sound of footsteps coming down the gangway from above, and he thinks fleetingly of Amesbury—of the questions he will ask if he sees Sherlock standing there with his hands against the wall, as though he is feeling for its pulse—and realizes just as quickly that he cannot face another passenger right now; he cannot be held responsible for what he might say or do.
But also, poisoned lip gloss, Sherlock thought to himself with quiet eagerness. He filed the idea away for later, before pulling John in for another kiss.
This knowledge still doesn’t change the fact that Sherlock knows their lives are all worse off because of him, but he can tell that John will not tolerate another mention of it.
“He also told me that she had become larger than life to him—more of a vision than a real person by then. It happens a lot with lads at sea. You can imagine why. Living through the horrors they do, how could they not idealize the girls they left back home? John told me then he’d never really known her at all—other than a few shy kisses exchanged at country dances, a few brief conversations about what the future might hold. So maybe it was for the best, he said. Nobody could have lived up to the ideal she was in his head. His life with her never would have been all he had dreamed it to be.
John licks his lips then, the corners of his mouth curling up into a wicked smile, his dark eyes settling on Sherlock’s mouth.
John decided he would help him along.
John set the newspaper and the plate of pastries aside.
Sherlock’s eying her now with his terrifying scrutiny. “What?”
Sherlock opens his mouth to protest but stops when he sees the look on John’s face.
Sherlock rubs against it, flexing his fingers.
He pulls the rest of his clothes on with haste, all thoughts of his own hunger forgotten in his eagerness to go up top and find Lieutenant Lestrade and ensure that he’s all right.
Once again, Sherlock’s curiosity overpowers any self-consciousness he might have over his lack of knowledge about something as basic as the physical discomfort caused by heavy labor.
Sherlock doesn’t ask, he simply follows his instincts, climbing up and over John’s legs and then lowering himself down so that he is straddling John’s thighs.
And yet, with no news of the third gunman, Sherlock’s work is stagnant. The hours crawl by. He feels the old itch building in him, the longing for something to quiet his mind. But instead of the drug, his longing is fixated on seeing John. He knows he can’t go back, and yet he is certain that if he does not, he will go mad.
John surged forward and Lestrade let go of his arm.
The one bright spot in the horrifying series of events was that, other than Tim Briggs, there had been no casualties. There were a few minor injuries here and there as a result of the fire, but on the whole, both the staff and guests on board the ship had made it to the lifeboats relatively unscathed.
“Right, and you know I have forgiven you for that right?” Sherlock just stares at his feet, he knows John wants to forgive him for it but he doesn’t think he really has. John’s hand tilts his face up and Sherlock feels every single thought leave his brain when the full weight of John’s gaze bores into his.
Lestrade is waiting on the sidewalk when they pull up, and John can tell this case is taking its toll on DI, if the dark circles under his eyes are anything to go by. The pure relief on his face when he spots them is enough to make John cut Sherlock off before he can even start demanding things.
“I hate this fucking case,” John says as they climb out of the car and Sherlock just nods. They give some quick statements to Lestrade and John suggests ordering in from somewhere which Sherlock is all too eager to accept. He can feel exhaustion down in his bones and he worries that now the case is over he might just fall asleep in his chair as soon as they get home.
“I forgive you, Sherlock.” There is such a sincerity in the statement and in those blue eyes that Sherlock is breathless. Sherlock tries to nod but it’s hard with John’s hand holding his chin in place like he’s worried Sherlock will break away. On the contrary Sherlock is content to stay like this all day. They are starting to lean in closer to each other and Sherlock can feel the thrumming of his heartbeat in his chest. John’s lips are so close and Sherlock finally has enough of the slow approach. He grabs John’s shoulders and pulls him hard. He captures the lips that have been plaguing him for years. The taste of tea, mint, and John floods his senses and he can’t help but groan. John’s tongue is running against the top of his mouth and he knows that he must be mewling at this point, and they are in the middle of a bloody street! It might be a less crowded one but still they must be capturing quite a bit of attention. He thought something like this would be far out of John Watson’s comfort zone but when he tries to pull away those lips just follow him.
“What for, John?”
But we can’t cut if from out these veins, no
Molly greets them cheerfully and seems to notice that John is a little shaken. She brings them tea without a word and Sherlock even manages a small smile at her. She returns it before going back to the blood work she had been studying when they walked in. John has situated himself in one of the chairs near the coolers, he thankfully had the foresight to bring his laptop with him. Sherlock enjoys watching him for a moment as John sets to typing out a new blog post.
“Sorry, not much to tell. It all happened over the phone. There was an ad in the paper for an odd job, the pay was high and the job too easy to pass up. I just called the number and set it up. I never got the guys name or anything.”
“Yes,” and well there really isn’t anything more to be said on it. John is undressed in record time. Sherlock’s tease has both of them practically foaming at the mouth. Sherlock starts by kissing John’s forehead which makes both of them giggle. He licks his left ear, soft moans escape the infuriating mouth that Sherlock moves to next. He starts with just a chaste kiss and lets John chase his lips as he pulls back a little before claiming John’s mouth in a searing kiss. He runs his tongue along the roof of his mouth mimicking the techniques that John did to him. There is a whimper that makes his cock twitch. The kiss has so much teeth that when Sherlock tastes blood he isn’t sure which mouth it came from. He sucks on John’s tongue before roughly pulling away and biting right at his pulse point. John arches into it so beautifully that Sherlock almost wishes he could paint. This is one of those sights that should be forever immortalized on a canvas. He begins sucking because fuck it, if John is truly his then he is going to make sure that everyone knows it. When he finally deems it done, he moves down to John’s chest making sure to slide his body down John’s just to hear him gasp. Sherlock licks at each of the nipples, sucking and pulling. He brings one of his hands up to John’s mouth and looks up to make sure he gets the idea. The first feel of that tongue sucking on his fingers like it’s his… well Sherlock is ready to stop pulling punches and get right down to it. He licks the tip of John’s cock, and the full body shiver that results is quite satisfying to say the least. He pulls his fingers back from John, when he feels a tap on his shoulder.
“Sherlock, I don’t really care for kids, we both know that I am shit at normal life, and most importantly you are my home. Whenever you are that is where I want to be. Alright?”
“Not to mention this boy named Charlie will grow up without his mother and probably be in therapy for the rest of his life.” Sherlock says, shoving his phone in Ed's face, showing him the photo of Charlie. He does not feel sorry for the sick freak, yes he might have been getting rid of other freaks but there is a reason why humans are not meant to play God. Sure maybe this guy didn’t get off on children but he did get off on cutting people into pieces and Sherlock is sure that is almost just as bad. Ed’s face breaks open as he stares at the picture of Charlie. There is a tear running down his face but he doesn’t say anything else.
“What?”
Sherlock is cursing himself loudly and repeatedly at least in his own mind. He knows that while, yes he did just keep John from having a panic attack, he has in a way shown his hand. Sherlock isn’t supposed to know about the panic attacks, about the figure that appears in his rooms on the few nights that he does try to sleep, or the fact that John Watson still wakes up screaming his name as though the fall is happening all over again. Of course he knows though he is Sherlock bloody Holmes and it’s not like John is particularly subtle about it. He has, quite literally, stopped speaking mid sentence just to feel for Sherlock’s pulse. Maybe John thinks him so inadequate at sentiment that he will think John is just being a conscientious doctor/friend. Sherlock is so frustrated with the whole damn thing that he almost wants to call off the rest of the day. However, Charlie’s face swims before his eyes and he forces himself to block out everything that isn’t about the case. He will have plenty of time for their personal issues after the work is over.
“Mary has left with the baby,” John says in a shaky voice, choosing to look at the floor instead of Sherlock’s face. “She’s not mine.”
“I take it this is alright then,” John chuckles. Sherlock looks up at him with wide wild eyes and seems to have a hard time speaking, John takes pity on him and continues. As John licks at Sherlock, he starts whimpering, making John hazy with lust, he starts rubbing himself on the sheets and moans against Sherlock’s opening.
The scene that awaits them is gruesome to say the least and John was a doctor in the damn army for crying out loud. There is a man lying on the ground, or at least what they assume pieces of a man to be. The killer obviously didn’t do the killing here, since there isn’t even one speck of blood anywhere, Sherlock is sure of it. The whole room is covered in plastic wrap and a thrill is washing over his body because this is someone who is clever. John is kneeling next to the body pieces examining them with a cool mask of indifference on his face that would surely fool anyone but Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock continues to take in the room trying to deduce anything about the location that might be of note. It is a small flat in a vacant townhouse, a place so cheap that only a student or someone with a very limited income would even consider living in it. Still it could hold sentimental value to their suspect so while he waits for John to finish his own deductions, he researches the history of the property on his phone. Apparently it used to be one great big Victorian house, complete with a servants staircase, a small ballroom, and no less than ten bedrooms. But it seems that the family that owned it, had no choice but to sell due to the most recent recession. After that it was bought by a rather small company that remodeled it into small flats. They never really took off however, and the property has been vacant for at least six months.
He presses his fingers into his temples with a force almost hard enough to hurt. He is starting to get a headache and the last thing he needs right now is something else to keep him from focusing on the work. And there it is again the reason why he never allowed whatever had almost happened that first night between him and John. The damn work. Oh Sherlock loves it, always has and always will. But at the moment he wishes vehemently that the work could move to another plane existence. Just until he figures out what to do about John, because at the rate they are going one of them is going to end up against a wall. Whether they're being kissed or hit by the other, well that depends on everything else.
“Oh come on John, surely even you noticed him flaring his nostrils like a bloody dragon.”
“I can’t sit on my own floor if I choose?”
“Very well, Dr. Watson.” Mycroft walks towards the door and turns back one last time when he reaches the doorway.
“Do you mean when I said the two people who love you best in the whole world?” John nods and Sherlock sucks in a large breath and he knows there is nothing else to say.
John and Sherlock rush to a squad car with Lestrade. Normally Sherlock would have put up a big fuss about riding in the back, but even he knows now is really not the time. They make it across the city in ten minutes flat, and if John wasn’t so keyed up he would probably be sick from Lestrade’s terrible driving. They have to almost crash at least five times before he starts to feel unwell; in fact he is so distracted that it takes him an embarrassingly long amount of time to realize that Sherlock is holding his hand. He looks down and is hit with such a feeling of… well at this point it would be insulting to call it anything other than love. He lifts his gaze and Sherlock’s eyes are so blue. They have done this exact same stare so many times. Usually they are having a silent conversation before they go out and do something incredibly stupid and reckless. This look though is warming his belly and spreading that heat further down. John’s tongue slips out and runs across his lips and he has a sudden thrill watching Sherlock’s eyes track the movement.
“What the bloody hell, Sherlock? So wait, our serial killer is killing off child abusers. I still want to arrest him but I might just shake his hand first. How in the world did you figure that out?”
“Close, but not quite.”
“How about you explain how you could do that to me Sherlock.”
John has to take dragon breaths when he turns around, once he is sure the water is a good temperature. Sherlock Holmes is naked, and staring at him through heavy lidded eyes that are tracking up and down John’s body in such a way he almost feels like they are touching his skin. He finds his knees have gone weak and is entirely certain that he is about to sprawl out on the floor. Sherlock though, seems calm as he walks up to him and finally, after this long horrid day, claims those lips as though they have belonged to him for years. In a way John guesses they have, that all of him has belonged to Sherlock Holmes since, “Afghanistan or Iraq?” It’s only that his brain took years to catch up, and he tries to convey the feeling as he kisses him back. He wraps his arms around Sherlock’s neck and has the ridiculous urge to climb the man like a tree, he holds back just barely. The kiss seems to last an age and John can feel his lips tingling. Sherlock draws away and checks the water, the grin he sends John’s way can only be described as feral.
“How did he pay you?”
“I do, but for me it doesn’t always work. Charlie is young and seems to have had only one trauma in his life. It will probably work for him, but me… well, most days it seems like my life has been nothing but trauma.”
“John,” he calls out as he cums wringing every drop out of himself considering this is the first sex he has had in sometime it seems his body is giving a rather embarrassing load of it. Finally it stops and he allows his head to fall back against the floor with a thunk. John looks like he might topple over at any moment so Sherlock grabs his hips and manhandles him to lay by his side. Sherlock turns so they are lying face to face, nose to nose. They don’t really say anything for a while just breathe in each other’s existence. John’s left hand moves and caresses his face, Sherlock turns his face into it and that is when he remembers...Mary. John’s gold ring is like a bucket of ice water being doused on him and he finds himself pushing away even as John looks alarmed.
“Okay,” and he looks so heartbroken in that moment that John gives him another quick hug before having Sally come and take the boy downstairs. He runs his fingers through his hair pulling at the very little bit of length he has and groaning in frustration. Sherlock has been watching him in that hyper focused way he does whenever he finds John particularly fascinating.
Once Sally takes the fingerprint, Sherlock finds himself itching to move again. John seems to notice and suggest they take a walk. Sherlock agrees, figuring that this might be when John tells him more about what happened with Mary. They keep pace with each other, and they don’t talk for the first seven minutes and twenty three seconds. Sherlock keeps his tongue firmly between his teeth knowing that John will tell him in his own time.
John takes all of this in, with that awareness he gets when Sherlock is being brilliant, but there is one thing wrong: John has tears in his eyes.
“Yes, John?” Sherlock asks, he doesn’t want to beat around the bush now.
Sherlock breaks away from the boy but they don’t leave until the boy’s father shows up. He looks frantic as though he ran five miles just to get here. Hell, maybe he did. Charlie’s face lights up when he sees him and the two hug for what seems an entirety. Once Charlie and his dad are just a spec in the distance, Sherlock finally looks at John.
“Yes?”
“Stop thinking so loudly,” Sherlock says, but he is still smiling.
Sherlock is pacing the living room floor at three a.m. He keeps walking to the bottom of the stairs and he even gets as far as putting his foot on the first step before he shakes his head and moves away. It is far too early to wake John up and there is nothing case related they can really do until the world wakes up again. His mind helpfully supplies him with an image of John tangled in his sheets; bare chested and his carefully styled hair mussed and sticking out every direction. Sherlock groans and wishes he could scrub out the image, but it stubbornly remains in front of him like a floating hologram.
“Feel free to put your number in there as well, cheekbones.” Sherlock rolls his eyes but he does notice that the color has drained a bit from the guy’s cheeks and he does seem genuinely freaked out. He isn’t bad looking and Sherlock hasn’t been with someone in… well if he can’t even remember then maybe it was time to… Oh, John looks as though he’s point two seconds away from shooting the poor guy. The look on his face is like Captain Watson except harder, almost as if he has gone rogue and only the presence of other people is keeping him in check. Sherlock feels, for one of the first times, truly afraid of John Watson, but even that can’t keep the low thrum of arousal at bay. Hmm. John’s behavior resembles a jealous lover far more than just a concerned best friend. Sherlock knows they need to be focusing on the case and he curses himself inside his head even as he hands the phone back and takes a closer step towards John. He puts an arm around him casually but lets his hand rest on the back of his neck like earlier. He smiles softly at John before looking back at the guy, “Thanks but I think I’m good.”
So I’ll hit the lights and you lock the doors
“Hi Charlie, can you tell me what happened?”
“Hello John, are you well?” Sherlock knows that it is a stupid question to ask but he doesn’t know what else to say and usually a question is safer with John than giving him his deductions, at least the ones that are about John himself.
“Get us a flannel.” John smiles as he gets up and goes to the bathroom to do just that.
“Our killer gets off on cutting his victims into little pieces. He kills them before he does it though which hints that he probably doesn’t want the person to suffer. I’ll have to wait until the cause of death is figured out before I can be certain. It’s frustrating being this in the dark, but I can’t deduce this without a whole body. Actually maybe that is part of the reason, the killer is probably aware of our working relationship with the police. They are cutting up the bodies so that I can’t deduce what has happened to them. Great, we are dealing with another genius.” Sherlock groans so loudly that all the patrons sitting near look over at them. John ignores them, his gaze resolutely on Sherlock.
“John, you know that I am not the type of person to regret my actions. Why should I when I think through every single logical solution and only go for the one that makes the most sense and causes the least amount of pain? But if there is one thing in my life that I truly regret it’s letting you think I was dead. The way you mourned me and the hell it put you through. If there was anything I could do, anyway to take it back, don't think for a single second I wouldn’t do it.” John looks dumbstruck, his eyes are as wide as they can go and his mouth is slightly open. Sherlock has the urge to take a picture, and he would if this wasn’t such a serious moment.
“Let’s not mention what we just saw ever again… well unless it’s to tease Mycroft.”
“But of course you are meant for each other, you mark my words. Don’t screw it up. Mr. Holmes is one of the finest men that I have ever met.”
“I actually was going for ten but well you can see where that ended.”
“Right,” Sherlock says distractedly. They walk back out so soon they end up in the exact same cab that they had on the way there.
“I am so sorry Sherlock,” John manages to say without letting his voice break. Sherlock tilts his head the way he does when he knows he is missing a particular social cue.
“Or we could not talk,” the huskiness in that voice is enough to have Sherlock considering jumping out of the car the moment it slows down and running on foot the rest of the way back to Baker Street, John beside him as always. He reaches for the last bit of his self control and allows himself to place a soft kiss in the place just below John’s ear. There is a soft sound, too soft for Lestrade to hear but the force of it is like someone just shot Sherlock straight in the chest with a cannonball. He pulls back and they desperately try to act like nothing is amiss the rest of the way.
Sherlock arrived at St Barts and began to examine the body. It was boring, mundane work and he would've rather been on a proper, fresh, new case but Lestrade didn't have one so this would have to do.
Beautiful and a genius? Fuck, maybe he should start paying attention to Year 11s. Or maybe just one Year 11.
"Move out?" John’s voice has no humour in it. "Sherlock, you must know, surely you’ve...deduced it by now, I mean. Bloody consulting detective."
"Is his name Mycroft?" Lestrade whispered, looking longingly at his arm on which the name was written.
The lawyer had told him he was so sorry about the loss of Sherlock, and the assumption was there. John swallowed down the denial, the constant
The first time it had happened Sherlock had apologised profusely, staring at the ceiling, his arms and legs now released from their unconscious embrace. But John had chuckled and repeated those words. "It’s all fine."
So John looks up to see the green box highlighting who was speaking and the camera is faced on a Year 11.
John glared at him, Mary by his side blinking as though she knew what was going on but also knew not to intervene. Probably wise. Sherlock did not know what John’s next actions were going to be but he supposed it had something to do with  re connecting his fist with Sherlock’s face.
"Mary, please go home. I...can’t...I need to just," John’s always struggled about talking with his feelings and Sherlock opens his mouth to help him along but Mary, oh, what a surprise that woman, understands. He’s silently concerned that he let someone other than him get close to John. Probably deserved that, though, even if this ice cold dagger hurts far more than any lashings in a basement in Syria.
"What?" Greg's face lit up, "Who?"
John had never been very good at legal documents - especially not keeping them updated. In the entirety of living with Sherlock, for those two years where life was simple and dangerous and
He’d wanted to write Mary out of the will as soon as he learned she was the one who shot his best friend, the one who nearly killed him, but held out for Charles Augustus Magnussen, the case.
John blinks again and says nothing. When Sherlock removes the shirt fully and turns to show his back, he can hear the audible gasp John makes, and the hand over his mouth as he tries to control it. He’s been in the army - he knows not to react too heavily to people’s scars. It’s one reason he’s comfortable showing them to John.
John stares through the legal garbage and realises he’ll have to rewrite the entire thing - it all means nothing now he has a kid. And people to live for.
"Daddy," Rosie pauses to poke her father in the face. Sherlock’s mouth goes mute, means to tell her that she should leave him be because of the day he’s had, but John’s eyes open and he turns his attention to her. The wonders of parenthood.
"We should go and see your parents soon," John murmurs, just to say something, as one of the logs crackle and jolt suddenly. Sherlock prods the fire and says nothing. "Thank them for the picture books."
Okay, that was dull enough. Need not read on. Another one pinged through from his Chemistry teacher.
But Sherlock can still translate what Mycroft is saying, even being significantly older than when he’d made up the language, and it’s basically some kind of repeating signal that the people holding him hostage are idiots without guns or knives or anything and quite clearly have no idea who is surrounding them outside. They might want a medic because he’s fairly sure that they’ve broken his arm but it doesn’t hurt too much so tell Gregory not to worry. And then the message repeats.
"This is an old friend of mine, John Watson," Mike introduced.
If he hadn’t been clear before, John went on to explain to Rosie (after checking there was no plate smashing mess and Sherlock wasn’t injured) that it was “called being bisexual” and it means "I could get married to a woman, like your mum, or a man."

THURSDAY
And so he serves the pasta to the people he cares for most dearly in the world, and decides he needs to put a stop to these thoughts telling him unhelpful things. To just tell John he’s in love with him. Before he gets hurt from the undoubtable repercussions of
So that was it then? Army men. Strong, muscly, brave, sacrificial. That would be John’s type of man, of course. Not the lean, thin detective with curly pompous hair and a tendency to play peekaboo with his daughter.
"And I’m sorry if you aren’t human enough to work out that you’re the most important person in my life-" Sherlock can’t take it anymore. Not one more word, it’s too much for his beaten little heart.
"Mrs Hudson didn’t want to rent it out," John fills the silence. "When I...um...moved out. So you can move back in. Might need a duster. Or a full sweep by Mycroft’s people."
"What?" Sherlock says sheepishly, feeling rather out of the loop.
"I do not know, I can assure you. The information has been kept privy from me." Sherlock has not been told explicitly, but he had deduced it.
He’d been surprised by Mycroft’s kindness, but on reflection it had probably been on Sherlock’s suggestion.
"Of course you made a bloody language." 7, actually, Sherlock thinks, but doesn’t admit aloud. It would just prove to John far more than he would like that Sherlock had spent most of his life being a lonely nerd.
When it all dies down, and Mycroft is batting off a shock blanket in favour of a cup of tea and the return of his umbrella, Sherlock turns to Rosie who is staring at Greg. Fretting around to try and get the medic to come and put Mycroft on a stretcher he will not lie down on, Greg is the epitome of a worried partner.
"I don’t need to go back, Sherlock. When she said goodbye she meant it. I’ve talked about you, you know. To her, and quite a lot of people really. I made it open to the people I dated that there had been someone in my life who I considered my soulmate who had died. That scared some off, some were intrigued. From the way I grieved for you, people perceived that we were a couple. And we could have been, and I realised that I’d wanted it."
“Wrong.” The monosyllabic voice is baritone and melodious, but in the sense that it could turn gentle and soft if it needed to. It’s not one that John recognises, and people barely interrupt Mr Halesworth, let alone to tell him he’s made a mistake.
This was all he wanted. He couldn’t have been a single dad, he’d known that ever since the day after Mary died and Rosie couldn’t,
Sherlock is ready to turn around when a warm finger touches his shoulder, tentatively asking whether it can touch, without words. He nods, speechless himself, and swallows yet again.
too, even if it doesn’t say it yet on her papers.
Of course John wanted to be with Sherlock - more so than he already was, more than "best friends". But he’ll suffice for this - living with him, and their daughter, because Rosie is fiercely
Until it wasn’t.
They sit in front of the fire and John wonders what Sherlock is thinking as he places his tumbler onto the small coffee table as well, loose blue dressing gown swamping him easily. He’s still staring into the fire, and is clearly hesitating on picking up the poker to prod at it again. John does it instead.
Speaking of documents...
"No, no. I mean...oh god, this is going to sound cringy. You’re my best friend, of course, but I meant more like, soulmate." Sherlock’s breath hitches at that word. Soulmate. Sure, yes, you can have a platonic soulmate. Albeit not normal, but whenever have they tried to be normal? But soulmate has romantic connotations. And John used it, so flippantly...
They love each other and soon enough John has to change his will once again, on a night with tumblers of whiskey, to change Sherlock’s status to "Husband"
In the end it’s a subtle change that adds to one of many. No dramatic love confession, no secret boyfriend, no big argument. Sherlock seems to be contemplating with feelings and is all nervous and gangly so John just reached over in bed and kisses him and kisses him and kisses him and that’s the end of it.
John smiles loosely. "You did know what godfather meant when you agreed to the role, right?" Sherlock bites his lip, then slowly nods.
And Sherlock takes Rosie to daycare, comes back home, does some science experiments in 221c, occasionally a small case for Lestrade, and then sometimes picks up their smallest resident from preschool.
And then he was married and they’d had no time then because suddenly Mary was pregnant and then she was an ex-assassin and she’d
Dear John,
But Sherlock Holmes trudges back to Baker Street, a sore back from John’s army tackle and a worry that the man next to him was silent.
that he’d almost giggled alongside him.
As I’m sure you are aware, you are now going to be receiving Zoom calls from all of your teachers. This includes me, naturally, so I look forward to seeing you tomorrow morning at 10am.
Have you got the youngers in your calls as well? Going to clog it up don’t ya think?
God he wishes he could kiss John’s hair like that. It’s just not fucking fair.
"Oh my...oh my god, you two are..you two are..." Mike fangirled.
Sherlock’s parents adored Rosie - there was simply no other word for it. They doted on her endlessly when they had her, and Sherlock often scowled over it. John knew, however, that he was grateful for his parents being there for his new found family however bizarre it had become. The child who wasn’t his, but really, really was. They should make that official, John is sure that Mycroft has a document somewhere.
"I like lots of people. I like Nanna Hudson, I like Grandma and Gramps, I like Uncle Greg-"
"Your name is Greg?" Sherlock asked incredulously and smirked.
This was, the reason, of course, that Scotland Yard hadn’t ploughed into the warehouse yet and arrested the kidnappers. Lestrade was getting antsy and pacing, leaving the man he rather obviously wanted to get together with in a kidnapping situation. But Sherlock had it quite under control.
Mr Halesworth
What if he could have this every day? What if he didn’t have to blearily make his way in at midnight? What if this was their room, not just Sherlock’s?
Sherlock takes a chance and slides the dog tags he’s claimed (stolen) back onto his chest without John seeing. "No. Not a holiday."
The will wasn’t consulted to again until he was serious with Mary. She was shocked to know he hadn’t properly updated it since coming back from the war, furious, really, and demanded he did so immediately. They’d been together for a few months by then and thus he felt no woes about gifting all of his junk that would be left over to her - yet still some things to Harry, out of sentiment and hope that this time rehab would work out. After all, he had been thinking of proposing to Mary, so it made sense.
"It’s 10am," Sherlock mumbles. John raises an eyebrow at Sherlock’s math clock, which has equations for the hours, and realises he’s right.
Sure enough, Mike Stamford came through the door later that afternoon, with a man who was definitely promising as a flat mate. He had blond hair, blue eyes, and stood in a military like position, holding himself straight. He was beautiful. He glanced around, said, "Bit different from my day," and chuckled with Mike.
And the whiskey headache hits properly about five minutes after he wakes up to the sound of Sherlock breathing on his chest and it’s oddly comforting, so he doesn’t move. Just stays there and thinks.
John and Sherlock shouted abuse towards Lestrade, complaining that, "JUST BECAUSE WE ARE SOULMATES DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN COMBINE OUR NAMES TOGETHER!" And Sherlock decided that in retaliation that he would shout after them, "MYSTRADE? HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT, HUH?"
Sherlock but was having John’s baby.
God, A-Level content is going to hit them super fucking hard.
"Oh my god, Mr Holmes, I'm so sorry, it's been a long day and I didn't recognise you, not that I've ever spoken to you before in my life, I'm babbling aren't I? Sorry. My name is Greg Lestrade, you must be-"
"We’re not, just friends." John states, staring ahead of him and not at Sherlock. It’s about 10:30 and Sherlock already feels a bit light headed from the second glass of wine. But he’s got total control of his functions - just feels warm. Comfortable.
Then the camera switches to Mr Halesworth and John bristles with annoyance as though Zoom has personally offended him. He wanted to stare at the Year 11, the blissful pleasing to the eyes that had presented himself and was now whisked away, but instead he gets the teacher’s bushy mustache? Not a fair trade.
John laughs, really laughs, and then looks at Sherlock with that fond smile. "Do I though?"
That isn’t the intention.
“Ah, here we are, more people are arriving. Right, so I haven’t sent the link to the Year 11s yet so I just wanted to remind you that they are joining,” the teacher is explaining and John rolls his eyes off camera. As if they’d have forgotten. “Please be mindful that they might be slightly lost as to what we are doing.”
John comes back to focus on him as Sherlock is staring at the floor. "John, I’m going to take off my shirt now."
Granted, Sherlock had been a bit nervous at first about the prospect of a young child moving in, but she’d been taken with him from the very beginning, back when all she could do was vomit spectacularly and occasionally look cute whilst grabbing his finger. Rosie is, in short, adorable. Sherlock loves her almost as much as John. His heart is bursting, now. Maybe the capacity of it is limited due to his lack of love in the past. Or at least, he would claim that. Sherlock has been, since birth, all in on love. Cuddly toys, cars, even bloody kitchen utensils. His parents fondly mention the time he had a meltdown when they attempted to throw away a broken red spatula.
Sherlock doesn’t mean that to sound mysterious, but it does. Miraculously, this is the first time he’s broken an arm whilst being kidnapped. All the other times that Mycroft has damaged something is not been from dangerous government exploits or James-Bond-like spy missions, but because he continuously believed he could beat Sherlock in a skiing race, 4 years consecutively, and failed miserably each time.
They’d both put Rosie to bed half an hour ago, Sherlock crooning a little song he’d made up (John has extracted the lyric about murder) and John tucking her in. She’d fallen asleep almost as soon as John turned out the lights.
"I sort of...took your violin. Mycroft tried to take it from me about a month after but when he saw the state of me...well I haven’t seen him since, needless to say."
"Greg isn't any easier, Sherlock! There could be millions of Gregs!"
After all, he didn’t have much. The flat wasn’t really his, and he had no serious partner, other than the man he lived with which remained platonic. His money, what little he’d collected from the war, was shoved into a tidy bank account and would have been donated to Harry if he’d died then, which she would most likely have spent on booze.
"He’ll be okay," Sherlock places his hand on John’s arm to stop him approaching the situation to play as doctor. "He’s broken his arm before, many times."
"You said he’s quite calm...but Sherlock, he’s speaking jibberish. Are you sure he hasn’t gone mental?" John wiggles the antennae of the device, checking it has retained function.
Not that they wear shirts often, anymore. Well, Sherlock does. And he used to get them dry cleaned, but, well, it’s better this way. More domestic. But John barely wears formal wear. His new surgery make him wear scrubs when he goes in part time, so when he cycles down it’s normally just with a polo shirt or jumper.
John caresses a scar with care and then sits back, letting Sherlock turn around and put his shirt back on, feeling completely open and vulnerable.
He waits a minute before clicking on the impending Zoom call - that’s a lie, he actually waits two and a half until he’s certain other people have joined and he won’t be alone with Mr Halesworth. He’d learnt the rules of online school, and he wasn’t about to be caught in that trap. Nope, he’d leave that to Mike Stamford, their local suck up who had a knack for getting the seat closest to his favourite teachers and had done since Year 7.
Sherlock’s heart did not commit to something lightly, hence why unsolved cases bothered him so much. He didn’t commit to people lightly either - either hating them or caring deeply. Greg, Molly, Mrs Hudson, his brother. And John and Rosie, of course.
All of this, to find John Watson ready to place his hand in marriage to a woman he’s never met.
Sherlock is busy unpacking the dishwasher when Rosie hits with another question. He’s unpacking John’s load of the dishwasher.
Sherlock. Like Uncle My likes Uncle Geo-Greg, but won’t tell him because he’s too scared. Which is ridiculous, by the way, because Uncle Greg doesn’t the same thing to him."
"Sherlock Holmes," He stuck out his hand, revealing the name that said 'John' on his wrist. John did the same. Written on John's wrist was the name 'Sherlock'.
But this...John being bi, openly admitting it in front of Sherlock, the man he lives with. This is one thing that is entirely new. John must know he’s gay. He’s never explicitly asked, but, surely, even after his failed (successful, in Sherlock’s point of view) exploits with Janine, he can tell that Sherlock is the poster boy for homosexuality, surely. Sherlock Holmes around women is the most awkward scenario ever, unless he helps them get dates or deduces them. Sherlock only gets flustered if it’s a man flirting with him, never a woman. Merely confused, sometimes. John can hardly miss that kind of thing. He must know. He must. So why hadn’t he acted on it?
"John," he croons carefully. The whiskey has gone down nicely and now his eyelids flutter. Sherlock looks unfairly beautiful for someone who’s just clambered out of bed. It must be what? Nearly midnight now? Sherlock repeats his name again in that melodic tone and John says, "Mmm?"
"Oh, no one, you wouldn't know him," Sherlock waved at Lestrade and disappeared from view.
"Soulmates," John and Sherlock finished his sentence, again looking into eachother' eyes.
"My little brother is going to be extremely annoyed."
Mr Halesworth lets out a deep sigh and goes to correct his mistake - sorry, what? The boy gives him attitude, corrections, basically calls him a fucking imbecile of a Chem teacher and all he gets is a sigh?! Who the fuck is this dude and why does he get the free pass on punishment?
“Like Sherlock," Rosie pipes up very helpfully. Sherlock’s heart lurches into his throat suddenly. He tells himself
"Starving." And they both chuckle. This isn’t normal. They both know this isn’t how friends work, but it’s happening and that’s okay. And eventually Sherlock removes his head from John’s chest and they get up wearily and Sherlock wakes Rosie and John starts on the eggs because Sherlock still can’t cook to save his life and the day begins.
“John, can I be inside you?”
John doesn’t seem able to break himself out of whatever flashback the body on the floor triggered until they are in a cab on their way to Barts. Sherlock would have dropped John back off at 221B but with the recent turn of events he isn’t sure that leaving the doctor on his own right now is the best course of action. Besides, Molly is there. Sherlock will deny this to his dying day, but there is something very calming about her presence. He knows that she will be a comfort to John and Sherlock will be able to get some work done without having to worry about him. At least no more than he usually does, and he makes a mental note to wrap the research up by eight at the latest, so that they can get to Angelo's at a decent time. He knows that his appetite has all but deserted him but it won’t do to worry John about something so trivial on the first day of his return.
“Hmm?” He finally brings his eyes to Sherlock’s face and his whole body is snapped back into awareness. Sherlock looks more unsure than John has ever seen him and he finds himself across the room and gripping Sherlock’s arms tightly.
Suddenly Sherlock is incapable of breathing or speaking, the armchair would be something easily explained, it was irrevocably John’s and he probably thought that Sherlock just used it as a stand in for him when he needed to think which while not wrong also isn’t the entire story. He manages to stand up and walk over to the door of his bedroom, he turns his head to look at John who has made his way into the kitchen.
