But on the other hand, Sherlock had said that he had made sure that the vault had not been located in Magnussen’s office and considering the high security of this place, how had he managed to get past all these gates to establish that conclusion with such certainty?
“Because if killing Magnussen was all we needed to do to solve our problem, we would have done so a long time ago. A person with that amount of power and leverage over people naturally has a lot of enemies, and yet he walks around more or less unprotected, conducting his daily business without a care in the world. That’s because he has made proper arrangements for all secrets to be revealed if anything happens to him. Killing him would be like unleashing a booby trap right beneath our own feet.
Sending a text when you eagerly awaited the reply was also a thing Mycroft didn’t like. It kept things hanging in the air with an anticipation he didn’t appreciate, as it made him feel powerless. There was no way he could force anyone to respond, they either did or they didn’t and that was that.  So all he could really do was to wait for something he had no idea if he was ever going to get.
A familiar longing for something he couldn’t quite describe. Maybe it was the house that made him sentimental, these weren’t emotions he normally allowed himself to dwell on.
This had immediately irritated Sherlock and swiftly he pushed himself from his leaning position by the door, cold annoyance evident in his eyes now.
As the trousers fell down to the ankles, Sherlock tried turning around but was immediately pushed back again, facing the wall.
He went quiet and John waited, impatiently looking at him, wondering what kind of nonsense would be coming next.
This idea naturally did nothing to calm his already agitated nerves, as John went back to the kitchen to finish making some breakfast while he continued to seethe with anger for a long time afterwards.
“What are you going to do about the phone situation? Magnussen doesn’t know that all of this was because of a case, he will keep ringing your damn mobile relentlessly if you don’t put an end to it.”
“What are we actually doing....” he began but Sherlock slowly shook his head and put a finger to his lips in a silencing gesture.
A silence settled for a second as they looked at each other. Mycroft had difficulty appreciating the quagmire created between them whenever they were alone, why were people always so insistent on being difficult?
“Remember when he told Rudd his whole life story after no more than a second of staring at him. Still don’t know how he pulled that off.”
Sherlock weighed the poker in his hands, looking at it as if it was far more interesting than the man in front of him. This was all about posing now, and no one outplayed him when pulling off the dramatics. He had honed that talent since childhood, driving his brother to despair with his need to show off at all times, appropriate or not.
He imagined the look on Magnussen’s face as he opened up the parcel that the delivery man had handed him.
buys his clothes, not me,” he heard Sherlock mutter in the background, and John could just picture the sulk on those beautiful lips.
Mycroft was always so ridiculously  rational and sometimes rational was boring when there were other ways to go about things.
“There are hours and hours of footage on those files, you will never be able to go through it all on your own. For the sake of Sherlock’s safety I suggest you focus on assignments where your efforts are more effective. Like continuing to try and trace down someone from Sherlock’s group of ....
He was fairly certain that there hadn’t been one on display, even if the room had been very cluttered and a photo could easily have been hiding amongst all the other items fighting for space in that room.
Mycroft took a tentative bite of his cake, adverting his eyes for a second as if allowing John some peace to come to terms with his own actions, as if Mycroft knew what he done, sending that note to Victor.
In fact, they had never spoken a single word about anything that had to do with this whole situation that now plagued John so much that he, as soon as he reached his destination, in frustration stormed into the barrack with eyes like thunder and pounded his fists against the wall until his knuckles bled, just to vent his rising frustration.
There was a knock on the door and one of his servants brought his phone in on a tray. The phone was buzzing quite incessantly and with a suppressed sigh Magnussen reached out to pick it up.
This knowledge is what helps John through situations like these, when they have not been standing side by side facing an enemy together, the unwavering trust in Sherlock’s ability to always land on his feet somehow, however dire the situation.
There was something in his voice that sounded strange when he said this but as he didn’t elaborate any further John didn’t ask any questions about it.
But then, as if changing his mind, he simply spun his head back to look at his guest and then turned on his heel to indicate that they should leave.
His little brother had always nurtured this hazardous streak of running headfirst into danger and things had hardly improved when John Watson had joined the picture. Therefore, he didn’t react particularly pleased when Sherlock got all starry-eyed and started talking about some new threat on the horizon, instead of the one they already had in front of them.
He really needed to get out and find the other two before they managed to find what he so carelessly had left in his wake, and fuelled by this thought, he delivered the next blow succesfully.
Mere minutes later the front door was slammed shut forcibly in his wake and the sound of his determined footsteps echoed down the stairs as he left.
Normally narcotics caused the pupils to widen but depending on the substance, shrunken ones were also a tell-tale sign of drug abuse and yet the very thought of Sherlock taking anything illicit felt impossible to comprehend.
He always managed to keep his cold façade, to never let anything he truly felt show on his features. And even the company of Victor Trevor and Charles Magnussen was something he had managed to seemingly tolerate as the alternative had been non-existent.
“We decided to meet somewhere else this time. There aren’t that many places safe from prying eyes, but it will have to do. He can’t be seen coming here anymore if we have officially fallen out, and as you say, the barracks are hardly that safe either.”
He certainly didn’t want to lose his hold on Sherlock who had managed to be quite an entertaining distraction, surprising even Magnussen himself who normally grew bored with toys pretty quickly.
conveniently, even if he was a creature of impulse and Mycroft must have ruffled his feathers by lecturing him in the hallway at Baker Street.
Sherlock sighed dramatically and rummaged through his pockets until he found what he was looking for and put a cigarette between his lips.
“I would never even contemplate executing such a threat. If you continue working here it is of no consequence to me, I haven’t the faintest idea who the people working here are.”
John nodded, relieved to hear that no violence had occurred between them at least. He wasn’t sure he would be able to handle the knowledge that Victor had been violent and not rush all the way over to where the bloody hell that bastard was hiding right now, and simply give him a proper trashing.
It was basically based on jealousy and worry that things would one day progress between the doctor and Sherlock.
For a second it lingered there, pressing against the windpipe and he could feel himself trying to inhale a lungful of air without seemingly moving a muscle. It was never appreciated to be seen struggling.
For a second John froze in shock but then he melted into the kiss with ardent fervour as his hands automatically reached out to grab Sherlock’s neck.
He pondered his options for another 30 minutes before he browsed the contacts on his phone until he reached M Holmes and then he pressed dial.
As Mycroft wasn’t comfortable touching people in general, and specifically not people lying about in the bio hazardous den his brother called a home, it felt like the safest option to do it this way. It was after all one of the reasons for carrying his umbrella in the first place whenever dealing with anything related to Sherlock, the risk of contamination being far too great, not to mention unpleasant.
Who these people were and why he had killed them to begin with was still shrouded in mystery and Mycroft dryly noted that it was matted for the police to work with, rather than his own agents. And when he saw the spark of interest in his brother’s eyes, he added that it was not a matter for him to deal with either.
Normally things like that didn’t run smoothly, this was a common self-storage and if people wanted to retrieve anything from there they were supposed to do it themselves, but along with the contact information Mycroft had given him last night, there had also been the name and number to a person assigned to help him procure everything he might need while being in charge of Sherlock’s health and a quick call to this individual assured him that his medical bag would arrive the following evening at the latest.
This forced Mycroft to be the one to make the first move, a role he wasn’t used to playing, being the expert in the art of conquering situations by using the oppressing power of silence, forcing others to be the nervous ones instead. This tactic did not work with Magnussen unfortunately and as Mycroft was the interrupting party here, he simply had to swallow the sour pill of humbleness and begin his excuses for disrupting the other man’s dinner.
However, there is no footage of him from any areas close to the riverbanks and that would have been difficult to avoid even for someone with Sherlock’s expertise, so chances are that he was taken fairly early during the evening. But considering Sherlock’s changeability it cannot be ruled out that he didn’t head straight to the riverbanks or that he simply changed his mind and went somewhere else instead.
Sherlock had stopped walking once again and this time he sighed, drawing a hand through his wind-swept curls as if bracing himself of what was to come.
John thought of the Victor he had been presented with, the unhinged tone to everything he said and did, and he couldn’t help but snort at the image of Victor dealing with a break-up.
Sometimes he just looked at Sherlock as if he couldn’t believe how lucky he was to have found someone like him.
Mycroft would of course never meet Mrs Purcell, he had only seen her briefly at the funeral and they did not know each other. But it would do well for Magnussen to contemplate what wreckage he left behind with his actions. Not that it was likely he would care.
He needed to stop their exit and perhaps, if possible, try to explain what he had found once they were outside. With Magnussen unexpectedly out of the picture now it would be easier to talk more freely with Mycroft and decide what to do next.
Mycroft impatiently sighed as if it was all very obvious, and in that moment he was so similar to Sherlock that it made John wonder who had perfected the art of looking like the only one superior in a room consisting of imbeciles to begin with.
Instead he grimly said: “Why did you come?” swallowing anything else that might try to sneak into his voice and expose everything he still felt for the other man.
“And why did you tell him that?” Mycroft said, because coming here surely didn’t constitute as leaving for a case. A case of what?
“A peck on the cheek? You are deluding yourself, Mycroft. Who settles for that in this day and age? This isn’t the Victorian times anymore, you know. People do more than just get hot and bothered by seeing a naked ankle.”
“And what do you know of it? You're only interest in him is to get him into your bed. You don’t even know him, you have no idea what our life consists of, what we have, who we are. ”
That was only with you. It seems I’m not explaining myself very well. What I meant to say was that I had a plan for every doctor that Mycroft hired to look out for me, different plans for different individuals, and before you do decide to give me one of those forceful slaps you seem to hand out so easily, let me emphasize once again that you were the only one I ever slept with.”
Sherlock could feel his gaze take in every detail of his body and it was a novelty being under such scrutiny from a man he knew was more perceptible than most. He wondered if this was what it felt like when he turned his own investigating scrutiny on others, minus the sexual interest of course.
He was actually happy for once, happy in a way he hadn’t felt for years, if possibly ever and that feeling of elation he experienced whenever he laid eyes on Sherlock meant more to him than anything else.
“I know Mr Holmes seems to be a stickler for protocol but it’s not essential for you to stay on my account, I can very well handle meeting my patient alone,” he tried but despite this, the other man stubbornly remained where he was.
Victor Trevor was clearly as mad as a bat and the realisation that Sherlock might still end up married to him made Mycroft supress a shiver of discomfort ready to run down his spine.
“What’s keeping you up, brother dear? I’m not going to be naïve enough to think that the weather woke you, you’ve clearly not slept at all.”
“I’m sorry to disturb you, Mr Magnussen, but there is a delivery for you, and they need a signature.”
“Good boy” the shadow whispered, and he closed his eyes while he continued to swallow the finger even deeper. He managed to swallow it whole without effort and he could feel the nail scratch against his gag reflex as if to force him to react.
With a last lingering look on the figure on the bed, he turns the feed off and rises from the chair.
He rose from his chair and untied the knot of the dressing gown, allowing it to fall in a heap on the floor before walking out of the room.
“Erm....well,” John began as he couldn’t help but stare at the unblemished smooth skin that stretched over a firm chest and an enviously flat stomach.
“Threats are all fine and good when you have no opposition to really consider. But I for one am not easily intimidated, neither by displays of physical strength or the menace of words. Your speech was quite funny when it comes to entertainment value, I was thoroughly amused. But regarding my continuing pursuit of whatever interest I take in your affairs, it has made no effect.  Kudos for effort though.”
He tried to waive these thoughts away, he could hardly afford to be distracted by sentiment at a time like this, but persistently they stayed at the back of his mind for the duration of the car ride.
Realistically he knew that he had no evidence that anyone besides himself and Sherlock knew what they had been doing for the past two months and yet it felt like everyone around that table knew something he didn’t. The look in Victor’s eyes before he claimed Sherlock’s lips, Magnussen’s speech about Sherlock looking flustered on account of someone seated at the table, even Mycroft asking about him about being distracted enough to forget his medical bag had set alarm bells ringing and he realised that he should just get the bloody hell out of here and remove himself from the board game altogether. This torture wasn’t worth it.
One rather significant detail was that his employee, the pilot of the helicopter, must have seen or at least heard his boss’s screams of terror but stubbornly claimed he had no knowledge of events and had not attempted to aid Magnussen in his plight.
If Sherlock believed him or not was unclear, but at least he didn’t say anything further about the matter. Instead he sat down on the only chair in the room and expectantly looked at John.
Mycroft arched an eyebrow at this ludicrous claim but refrained from uttering the scathing remark that initially came to mind. Even if Magnussen was out on thin ice with his comments, there was a grain of truth to John being far too naïve regarding Sherlock, and look where it had landed him – drugged up and betrayed by his supposed lover, just as clueless about his whereabouts as the rest of them, and utterly humiliated to boot. And whatever he claimed, John Watson had no other wish but to be just where he was right now, looking for Sherlock. It was what he decided to do once he found him that was still uncertain.
John’s nostrils flared and Mycroft decided that unless the imminent threat of a fist flying through the air would become reality, he had to intervene.
Because, as Sherlock had pointed out, tonight had been their final time together before the plan to take Magnussen down would be executed. They had no way of communicating directly, so even if John had wished to include Sherlock on these new plans, he had no way of doing so.
Before John had the opportunity to answer though, Sherlock once again brought attention back to what he found more important than anyone’s sleeping habits.
“Don’t be ridiculous! Why would I be interested in cooperating in whatever it is you believe has happened to your precious flatmate? This isn’t some silly Agatha Christie novel where everyone is a potential murderer in disguise.”
And with that Lestrade taps the front of his pocket with a look of affection on his features before his attention turns once more to the box of old items that’s still in front of them. John silently takes a deep breath to brace himself and then he turn his attention to the box as well, letting the memory linger for as long as it takes for the dull pain to slowly subside.
As he stepped up, he quietly brazed himself for whatever awaited him behind the ordinary looking facade.
Mycroft remained standing by the door staring into the darkness for a long time afterwards, doing his very best to control the slight tremble that made the hand around the door handle shake just a little bit.
John remembers how guilty he had felt at that moment. The kiss still tingling on his lips, thoughts of Sherlock and Mary fighting for dominance in the beehive inside his head.
Naturally Dr Watson had been unable to keep quiet for long once Magnussen had dropped a remark about Sherlock and his mischievous antics.
Once he was gone John turned to his patient, eyes wide in bewilderment. The wish to raise his voice and throw his arm up in the air to vent this frustration for being kept in the dark was for a second overwhelming. Maybe the childish antics of his patient was rubbing off on him as well?
To indulge in sexual activities while plotting against Magnussen hadn’t really crossed his mind in advance when he had borrowed the bicycle to make it here tonight, so he had not thought of bringing anything they could use for sex.
John threw his wet towel on his camp bed and began to get dressed, not bothering about the fact that others were privy to his naked backside. He had nothing to feel ashamed about when it came to his appearance and besides, he was used to living in confined spaces after his time in the army.
Often enough Mycroft allowed Sherlock to simply remain in his room to plotter with his things to his heart’s content but tonight he had topics he wanted to discuss so dinner was not optional.
Looking at Sherlock now was almost too much, it made him want to reach out, to touch all those beloved details that had been accessible mere days ago, slam him to the ground, simultaneously wishing to hurt him to the core while also fucking him until he screamed, and John stepped back as if struck by lightning, because no, it could never be that way between them again.
Mycroft sighed. They had engaged in this topic on numerous occasions but somehow they always ended up at this very same stand point. He was too tired and angry to take the bait this time though so he straightened his features into neutrality instead and prepared himself for this evening’s farewell. He would bring up the reason for his brother intrusion into the research facility tomorrow but he realised that he was not going to get any answers tonight.
It had clearly not occurred to him that Magnussen might not be alone in his flat. Bachelor or not, maybe he still had people who kept him satisfied at all hours Or perhaps the rumour of his bachelor status was simply untrue? Or had it been a business partner? One of his blackmailing targets?
It contained a little note in Sherlock’s own spidery scrawl and he could imagine how Magnussen, after reading the message, would hurry back up to the living room just to see it abandoned and his conquest gone, no trace left behind beyond the note and the curtain billowing in the breeze from the open window.
He had instinctively reacted to her calling him by his professional title. He had not used it for a while now as he no longer practiced medicine and he was fairly sure that he had not mentioned being a doctor when getting hired, and yet her she was, addressing him the way he had been used to be addressed before his injury. It felt equally nice as well as suspicious, because where had she gotten that information from?
He reached his hands out towards the flames, losing himself in thoughts of how gratifying it would feel to put a dent in the glistening career of the man who was The British Government.
Dr Roylott quickly walked over to the window and closed it firmly. He knew better than to run any risks by keeping it open longer than necessary.
Looking at it immediately takes him back to that day and an onslaught of mixed emotions wash over him.
Sherlock appreciated what they had and would never intentionally do anything to jeopardise their relationship.
His voice had gone up a notch now and Sherlock looked somewhat taken aback by this reaction, perhaps even slightly hurt. But John had managed to work himself up into a bit of a state and needed to have this off his chest.
The words got stuck in his throat, unable to formulate what his own mind had secretly been dreading ever since he had learned just how interested Charles Magnussen actually seemed to be in Sherlock. He had suspected that some sort of incentive must have been given but had at the same time stubbornly refused to fully believe it. He knew how jealousy could twist and turn things until it made a person unable to separate reality from distrustful imaginations.
He remembered Sherlock the way he had seen him that last time, chained to Magnussen’s bed on that fateful evening, silent for once, just looking at him. They never exchanged any final words because none of them realised that there would never be any more words to be spoken between them.
It created a vague reminiscence of their sexual activities from the past, with him pinning Sherlock to a piece of furniture while pounding forcefully into him.
But to Sherlock, this was all just a game of course and apparently when playing a game no rules applied, John bitterly realised, thinking about the insistent innuendos Magnussen had been making all night, Mycroft slightly embarrassed demeanour, not making the effort to contradict Magnussen’s words even if he didn’t outright confirm them either.
The black curls danced around the pale face as Sherlock shook his head. When he spoke again his voice was back to normal though, not a trace of that small almost childlike innocent quality.
Besides, he had other plans for Victor that were much more in line with the sort of punishment Mycroft envisioned for a person who had put not only him but also his brother through the ordeal Victor had managed to torture them with.
No news of Sherlock’s condition and the realisation that the situation was beginning to look very grim had hit him hard, feeling like the situation was spiralling uncontrollably out of his hands had caused him to drown his sorrows in a glass or four, not counting the whiskey Mycroft had offered him this morning.
The house squeaked and moaned from the force of the storm outside and Mycroft felt that cold grip of fear close around his heart once more as he listened to Anthea’s voice talking with trepidation and uncertainty, tinged with a bottomless sorrow he had never heard her speak in before, as she told him the news that made him gasp for air as the words developed into a blur of sentences he could no longer grasp the meaning of.
If it was the last thing John ever did right in this wretched mess, he was going to pull that bloody thing down and destroy it. It was the least he could do when everything else seemed so hopeless and utterly ruined.
Sherlock turned to look at him, his face blank. When John realised that Sherlock wasn’t joking, his eyes widened even more.
“I see. Well, I understand your reluctance then, Dr Watson. But it is a pity, as there is a matter I really wanted to address with someone who knows him a little better than a new physician might.”
John assumed it had to be about the drugs but wasn’t completely sure and decided to be as vague as he could in his reply.
Right now Mycroft was not fairing that much better. John could sense some sibling rivalry going on between them, not too far off from the way he and Harry addressed each other occasionally, with the exception that they did it in private, not amongst others.
“Well, it was quite painful,” Sherlock muttered, wanting to reach out to touch the wound, the restraints preventing him from doing so. It pulsated and he could feel how swollen his hand had become.
But now, when he knew more about Sherlock’s background, his failings and insecurities, the body of a real person had solidified the figment of his imagination and turned Sherlock into a real person.
But as he raised his gaze to his nightly visitor he realised that it wasn’t Sherlock who was standing by the door.
Maybe the poker hadn’t always had that shape or form? Maybe it had been forced into that slightly twisted appearance for some reason and was now leaned against the wall because the rack it had previously fitted into, no longer managed that.
Luckily Victor had been away on a business trip at the time or he would have noticed the result of that punishment, and all hell would have broken lose.
He didn’t sign the letter as he realised that Victor would probably doubt the content if it came from him. Instead he kept it as formal and to the point as he possibly could, put it in a plain envelope with no traces of where it came from, wrote Victor’s name and the word urgent on it and then pushed it inside Mr Rudd’s in tray before the man had arrived.
Victor turned and walked over to a locker standing in a darkened corner of the room. He opened the door to it and reached inside for something.
Instead he waived a pointed finger in front of the other man’s face as he let out the angry tirade he had felt building up inside of him ever since Sherlock had opened his mouth and spoken his first words of insolence.
His body had turned tense as his eyes did their best to catch sight of any unusual activity despite the obscured view, while several mixed feelings rushed through his system, his feet treading carefully with every step he took.
Dr Roylott’s coarse voice was preferable to the smooth slithering of Magnussen’s in John’s ears and in an effort to get a control of the feelings threatening to overpower him whenever the thought of Sherlock’s deceit hit him, he closed his eyes against his own reflection and bent his head down, his chin towards his chest, taking a few deep breaths.
As they entered the elevator and she pushed the button to the top floor, she offered a more detailed description than what she had given earlier.
John had yelled at him to do something despite not knowing himself what that something should actually be, the irony not lost on him being the doctor in the  room but still fumbling with what to do. Mycroft always came off as a man in full control of every situation, however difficult it was, and to see him frozen to the spot, completely helpless, just intensified John’s feeling of being lost.
He was taken on a ride through the countryside, a ride which soon lulled him back to sleep. It had ended when he woke the next time, the car parked on a deserted parking lot in front of a tall grey office building that housed no other occupants, merely empty rooms and endless corridors.
Sherlock had after all decided that there was only so much he was willing to do to get the upper hand in this scenario, and having Magnussen take advantage of him while he hanged helplessly in a pair of handcuffs from his wrists, was not something he was going to participate in.
But even before he had reached his destination to accurately confirm it, John saw who the other man was and why the gun in his hand looked so very familiar.
? He bloody drugged me! There will be more than words, I assure you. He’s going to regret ever having been born!”
He looked pale, well paler than usual, and there were signs of him having been put through some slightly rough handling, probably on account of the emergency situation.
“Also information that  will be provided once you let us in. Or you might see for yourself by looking at your security cameras. Your surveillance seems to be lacking if no one has yet alerted you to the fact that we have been standing here a good ten minutes all ready.”
He had spent a lot of his morning, while taking his usual swim in the lake, contemplating the easiest way to go about it and as he didn’t have any way of getting in contact with Victor in person, he had been forced to get inventive.
But seeing how close to comatose the younger man was, maybe it was a good thing that his brother was there to answer some questions on his behalf.
He wasn’t sure he could take a second round of this, to feel his jealousy and resentment tear into him again, make him stay awake at night fretting about what Sherlock was doing with Victor, how the time was ticking away, closing in on the upcoming wedding, and how the situation would change after that. Would Sherlock perhaps try to deceive him again? And would Victor actually put a bullet through his body one of these days?
The hands Dr Roylott had been keeping hidden behind his back now came forth, holding a small burlap sack as well as stick with a noose at the end of it.
“He didn’t introduce himself so I don’t have a name, but they appeared to be in some sort of business arrangement together and just to clarify my interest in him, it wasn’t the kind of business Magnussen runs officially. The man was very irritated over the fact that Magnussen had kept him waiting for so long, so irritated in fact that he didn’t bother to hide his annoyance despite my presence. He caused quite a scene and started waiving his hands about like some overindulged drama queen. At first I thought that he sounded rather ridiculous, but there was something in what he said that actually piqued my interest...”
Well, it isn’t the first time certainly, it’s an occupational hazard when being a consulting detective dealing with a lot of criminals on a regular basis, but there is something about this incident that has Mycroft rattled beyond reason.
It felt extremely domineering but on the other hand, so did the idea that a family member and later a spouse was the one in charge of a person’s medical care when there was absolutely no need for it.
As the cab was pulling up at the desired destination, he watched through the window as they came to a stop, letting his eyes take in the old prominent building that normally housed Magnussen whenever he was in town. Then he steeled himself and payed the driver before he brazenly stepped up front to ring the doorbell.
Hopefully Sherlock had managed to calm his nerves sufficiently to perform as expected, but considering what came out of his impertinent mouth next, proved it was doubtful.
His eyes blinked a few more times before they went completely dark and his body turned limp in the chair, all sounds fading away into the background and soon turning completely mute, as if someone had pressed a button to achieve utter silence.
But just like the issue of fucking on top of Mycroft’s desk had been an obstacle in the beginning, John had soon been persuaded by Sherlock’s tortuous teasing to give in and have sex despite Mycroft’s presence in the house. It was just a matter of being more careful as Sherlock so readily had informed him as they shagged against a wall in the room furthest away from Mycroft’s domain, John stifling his cry as he came by biting into the fabric of a stuffed pillow while Sherlock’s mirthful eyes had looked at him.
“I can’t believe how casual you are about all of this! You just cheated on your fiancé! With your doctor! It’s like a really terrible episode of Corry.”
The doctor was, as expected, a bit worried about the whole thing, especially as he didn’t have the comfort of whatever soothing method Sherlock usually applied to pacify the man. Mycroft sincerely hoped it wasn’t all down to sexual manipulations.
A quick search of the living room revealed nothing resembling a vault though, he would have remembered it of course as that had been his main mission after all and despite what Mycroft claimed, he hadn’t lost focus just because something infinitely more interesting had been presented to him. But this time he had a better opportunity to look closer.
It felt a bit odd to bid Sherlock good bye though, it would have been nicer if they could have continued to spend some time together, but he realised that if they were going to pull this off they needed to be careful and stick to the rules.
John felt his heart rate increase, worry instantly grabbing him when hearing this. And with worry, anger quickly followed, because this situation sounded serious enough to warrant more aid than what his meagre medical bag could possibly provide.
He wasn’t sure how to end that sentence but knew that his point had come across anyway. Mycroft reluctantly allowed him to carry on.
The impact hitting his body made his hand react out of instinct, his finger pulled the trigger and a shot went off.
“I have some mementos from our time together, also a few pictures on my phone. I’ve been meaning to dispose of them, but I haven’t....well there hasn’t really been any time....”
But not just any button. It was pearly white with the remnants of a very particular aubergine thread in the middle and John knew this button very well, having spent several occasions undoing this very button, as well as other ones just like it, while removing the deep purple shirt it belonged to from Sherlock’s slight frame.
It almost felt like Sherlock was aware of this fact and put himself on display and John wasn’t above admitting that temptation surged through him at the sight, despite all his futile promises and attempts to keep things professional.
John realised that however irresistible it was to just wrap his arms around Sherlock and press his lips against his soft plush mouth and allow himself  to succumb to his supressed desire and longing, nothing good could come out of it if he didn’t take this opportunity to address the issues he knew they were still facing.
With those final words John found himself dismissed and out of the room while the door was closed behind his back, leaving Sherlock at the mercy of the other man and whatever disgusting plans Magnussen had in mind for him.
Enter the dragon’s den, he thought as he turned the handle and pushed the door open before stepping inside.
“So it would seem. Unless you are in the habit of sleeping like a new-born while my brother is nowhere to be found.”
The lack of time had not left him with a lot of options to consider how to proceed now that the cards of his opponent were out in the open, he didn’t really know what the evening would bring, but he assumed it would be unpleasant. Especially if Magnussen was going to be present as well.
John snorted to himself and shook his head as he impaled another piece of roasted lamb on his fork. Sherlock Holmes being in love with anyone?
“Spare the intimacies, Dr Watson, if you wouldn’t mind. What was the nature of his mood? Did he tell you something about going anywhere?”
Too preoccupied with hiding his feelings, no doubt, the tension between him and Trevor had been obvious for everyone in the room to witness, including those hired to be there for the sake of pretence and with little insight to the intricacies of the supposed love triangle going on between the doctor, his patient’s and the patients possessive fiancé.
However much he had fantasised about it, it did not fit with the narrative, this was a man about to get to married within only a few months and he was also a man who John had talked to exactly once and on that occasion there had certainly not been any spark of interest in those changeable eyes, however much John might have hoped for it.
“Ok, so if I understand you correctly, Victor came raging into the house, fired two shots to each head but only managed to put his victims to sleep. Did he realise that himself? He seemed quite out of it when I got there.”
A short epilogue will follow that will offer a darker twist to the story, so those who like to leave our couple where they are right now, on a lighter note, should stop reading after this chapter and consider this the end.
The rest of the evening went by with a slow pace and the pointless mingling with people Mycroft had no wish to speak to more than necessary. The food was a small comfort and he began to feel a little lightheaded as the evening progressed and the waiters kept refilling his glass, so eventually he decided that enough was enough and it was time for him to depart.
An hour before the shift was ending someone tapped him on the shoulder and as he turned his head to see who it was he noticed two men standing behind the glass partition a few stories up, overlooking the site, staring at him, one of them pointing him out to the other.
Yet, somehow his omission to answer Mycroft’s question seemed to convey more than he had realised, and Mycroft’s eyes turned hard.
“They are working on him right now," Mycroft said. "I’m here in the back, giving them the room required to do their job. I’ll let you know as soon as anything new happens and when my team arrives, they’ll make sure you are taken safely home, and Dr Roylott will be dealt with. I saw some things in those rooms that will put him away for a very long time, if the attempted murder of my brother wouldn’t manage to do the trick. Added with the dealings he had with Magnussen and probably a lot more as well, I’m surprised if he’ll ever see the light of day.”
“His appearance alone should have told ýou that he wasn’t. And besides, so what if he had been a rent boy? No reason to go blabbing just because you think a prostitute won’t pay attention. I never once told you to go after him.”
It was perhaps the way his face had a look of smugness that gave John the distinct feeling of being nothing but a piece of dirt in the other man’s eyes, and then with the added snide comment about factory work he realised that he strongly disliked this person who knew how to blow himself up to an impressible size but in reality was nothing but a poser who hid behind a fancy way of speaking and an expensive-looking suit.
His main tactic was to blackmail his victims with the threat of publishing delicate information about them if they did not perform certain favours that could gain him further influence and power. Sometimes the influence and the power weren’t even what he craved the most. Occasionally he just thrived on seeing others dance to his tune, be at his complete and utter mercy, defencelessly squirming in his hands before he destroyed them just for the fun of it. Him being a true sadist at heart, it was difficult to know how to survive a confrontation with a man that took such pleasure in seeing others suffer, and for every victim he added to the ever-growing list of people he had ruined, he grew even more brazen.
When Sherlock continued to ignore him, Mycroft picked up a ruler that lay discarded on the table and poked his brother in the ribs with it to get a reaction from him.
. I just think it’s an immature method of reaching results. It’s like something out of a teenage novel or a soap on the telly,” Sherlock complained.
With one hand holding the phone and speaking to the emergency operator as calmly as he could, he leaned in to take a closer look at the mark and suddenly it all became very clear to him what kind of situation he was witnessing.
“How would you know?” Mycroft raised an inquisitive eyebrow while he met his brother’s eyes in the mirror. “Have you actually even seen a soap on the telly, or read a teenage novel for that matter?”
There was also the risk that he would go searching for John who was doing his outmost to look like one of the waiters and circulated the room with a tray of refreshments.  So far he and Sherlock had not acknowledged each other but Mycroft wasn’t naïve enough to believe that they were not fully aware of each other’s presence despite not exchanging glances.  He only hoped John wouldn’t be a hindrance tonight.
Sherlock shrugged his shoulder's as if it was of no consequence to him if chemistry was a lucrative business or not. While doing so, he made sure to turn sideways to reach for a canapé, offering up a glimpse of his backside for Magnussen to feast his eyes on.  Then he put the piece of food delicately to his lips to draw attention to his mouth instead, Magnussens's eyes following his every move like a Pavlovian dog. It was quite baffling in Mycroft's opinion.
“We’re making a stop at my brother’s flat to pick someone up who will be interested in coming along,” he said coolly, secretly wishing that this actually was the case. Considering John Watson’s state of mind when last seeing him, it wasn’t a given that he would be interested in joining them.
Unless, and this was a very creepy theory indeed, the fiancé for some reason did not trust his future husband and needed constant proof of Sherlock’s fidelity.
He remembered Victor pointing his gun on him the other night and the unhinged look in the man’s eyes while doing so.
“Well then, no harm done, and my invitation naturally stands, if you have not taken too much offence from a jealous fiancé’s cautionary words that is.”
As far as Mycroft was concerned, he didn’t know about this either, but he at least would be more displeased than actually shocked, having experienced what Sherlock was actually capable of sometimes.
“What’s happened?” he said as they hurried out of the barrack to the car waiting for them outside, his medical bag in hand and as he climbed into the car she told him what she knew.
His clothes dried and the tentative beams of sunshine peeked from behind a cloud as he passed the familiar surroundings without actually seeing them. His shoes were muddy and his jacket failed to provide him any warmth but he trudged on anyway.
The first day and a half back at the flat passed without much issue. Not even the matter of sleeping arrangement presented itself as an obstacle.
The door was silently pushed open and he swept inside while John followed more hesitantly, as a rising suspicion had begun to form inside of him and was confirmed as he stepped further into the room.
? That’s a rather loose term, especially coming from someone who prides himself with always being very precise. “
“Or were you perhaps exceptionally naughty this time? I believe I heard something about a break-in at your brother’s facility, around the time you acquainted yourself with Dr Watson. A botched-up attempt, but knowing you, as well as what your brother’s facility harbours in form of chemical supplies and illicit substances, there is always the opportunity for a repeat performance, of course.”
After that initial visit to Sherlock Holmes’s bedroom, where he had been given a first taste of what had driven Victor Trevor off the rails, Magnussen had commissioned a painting that quickly become a favourite of his, to be placed in his London residence as a reminder of what he had, a mere phone call away.
“Of course I know who you are talking about, I’m not as hung over as some others that come to mind at the moment. Too many glasses of Champagne to stave of the boredom?”
Weapon or not, he could still refuse to speak, and John could not shoot a hole through his head as long as he still needed him to give information about Sherlock’s whereabouts.
Naturally he did his best not to let any of these emotions show on his features and instead he cleared his throat and did his best to sound distantly polite as he asked the obvious question.
At the same time he was clear-headed enough to realise that no agreements should be accepted on such superficial grounds as him being slightly attracted to someone and here the disadvantages of the arrangement emerged.
In front of him Dr Roylott’s nostrils flared in mounting rage, his eyes threatening to bulge out of his head at any second, the tone of his face growing darker.
On the other hand, they had not known each other that long, maybe it was more noticeable to someone who had spent more time in Sherlock’s presence.
John calmly rose from the sofa and began walking towards the door, in a last effort to force Magnussen to stop playing games.
Around the same time I decided that ending things with Victor might be advisable, so I did that as well.”
Sherlock had most likely not given the nature of his actions so much as a second thought, how they would impact what he and John had in the long run. Sherlock always considered his methods justified if they helped him solve a case. But this, all of it, had been taken too far and John knew that if Sherlock didn’t realise it himself, John would force him to understand or the thing they had between them could no longer go on, however much that thought pained him.
“Yes, they were endlessly entertaining,” Mycroft sardonically replied, his tone indicating that dinner time at the Holmes residence had been anything but fun. “Now, if you would be so kind as to inform me if you’ve managed to do what you set out to achieve tonight. Have you managed to strike a deal with the devil yet?”
A warm feeling spread inside his chest as he pedalled through the cold darkness of the night, a feeling of pure excitement as well as giddiness accompanied him all the way home for a few hours of well deserved rest before events were going to be kicked into action by tomorrow morning.
“Oh, please, I wasn’t dying, I merely miscalculated the dose a little bit, nothing to make a fuss about,” Sherlock weakly tried to wave his hand in a blasé gesture but didn’t quite manage to pull off the nonchalance he wanted to convey, his movements still a bit wobbly.
And in fact, as he seemed determined to constantly lash out towards John in some sort of misplaced act of jealousy, John realised that Victor might actually pose a threat to their plan if he decided to confront John again, bringing the gun with him and this time actually pull the trigger.
He knew he wasn’t going to let Sherlock end up harmed without at least trying to prevent it, however much it chagrined him to admit this.
Hell, what he had been through for the past couple of years, chasing the adrenaline high of a life of danger and peril as if his life depended on it. Because hadn’t there always been that element of adventure that tickled his senses, made him rush head first into action? So why stop now when things were truly turning dark and twisted?
After a sleepless night twisting and turning next to John without finding any piece of mind and the hours had begun to tick away, he could only see one solution to the much-needed leeway he required to be able to sneak out to the car that was picking him up at six.
Chains, condom wrappers, naked skin, Sherlock’s youthful appearance in contrast to Magnussen’s withered older one. The enactment of that ruined painting had never been more evident than in this moment when lying close to each other on that bed, the act of sexual molestation abruptly interrupted by some mysterious event that John for the life of him couldn’t figure out.
Reluctantly Sherlock clammed his mouth shut again, and John gave him a satisfied nod before he continued.
Finally John lost the last vestiges of shock that had kept him more or less in an astonished inability to act, now responding by forcefully punching the door with his fist, reaching for the handle to throw the door open and stop Magnussen from whatever his intentions were.
The cheeks were glowing red and almost glistening from dampness and the eyes were closed, his breathing shallow, indicating that he had trouble filling his lungs with sufficient amount of air and Magnussen stopped a few feet away from the bed to look at the thin form beneath the bedsheets, trying to assess what the cause for this was all about.
He doesn’t like feeling useless but there is nothing for him to do right now, unless he joins the team watching camera feeds and with his eye-sigh beginning to lose focus on account of the lack of sleep, he can’t risk missing anything vital by offering his services.
I remember that even Mycroft reacted with surprise when he found out about Victor, which confirmed my suspicions even further, that wanting to be with me was some sort of abnormality and probably to do with some underlying motive. Mycroft said that I was better off without complicating my life by attaching myself to someone that was bound to cause me pain in the end, but I was so happy that I ignored his advice and decided to enjoy my friendship with Victor whatever the consequences.”
He knew that, despite his own harsh words, mere minutes earlier, he would never leave Sherlock again.
Eventually Sherlock will be allowed to roam more freely, leave this confinement and be let out. The story of him suffering from some sort of illness will not be enough to hold him in Mycroft’s clutches forever.
John swallowed and finally managed to tear his eyes away from Sherlock’s helpless form to look at Magnussen instead.
John felt how bile was beginning to rise in his throat just picturing that disgusting man with the dead eyes behind his spectacles, crawling under the covers to allow his repulsively sweaty hands to travel all over Sherlock’s naked body, inflicting him with harm as well as humiliation, while the younger man had no other option but to allow for it to happen.
Suddenly the door to the barrack was opened and a woman, smartly dressed in a navy-blue suit, her heels clacking against the hard floor as she walked, came striding in his direction.
Even if Mycroft occasionally enjoyed fine dining himself, when his diet permitted it, or rather, when he allowed himself the indulgence, this was not his natural milieu.
Victor gave him a glare of disbelief because Mycroft not descending like a thunderstorm upon everything regarding this unfortunate situation was exceedingly surprising to grasp.
“Bye, Mr Holmes. Enjoy your last hours, by the sweat beginning to break out on your forehead, I see that it has already started to inconvenience you. “
There was now a poignant tone to Mycroft’s voice that John had no desire to acknowledge. Instead he decided to ignore it. There was no proof of anything inappropriate going on between him and Sherlock and he was tired of everyone’s insinuations.
This was supposed to have been a one-time thing, Sherlock batting his lashes at Magnussen so he could gain entrance to his flat and locate that secret vault. Going to lunch with the man the next day had not been a part of the arrangement and it naturally didn't please him to hear about this new development.
John’s eyes fell on Sherlock’s riding crop that was innocently lying among the mess of debris on Sherlock’s desk. He had never touched it before and wondered how it would feel against the palp of his hand. What sort of noises it could elicit out of Sherlock.
“...because when you put into perspective Magnussen’s clear obsession with you, as the increasing number of phone calls made to you clearly indicates, and then this new piece of information you give us where he is supposedly now very eager to invite you to his house, it begs the question what it is that you have done to create such a response. And that, little brother, is the reason why John called for me to come here.”
Even if there was a risk that things had been taken too far with Magnussen already, Sherlock in retaliation mode meant that there was always a next level for him to bring the situation to and inwardly John cursed his own incapability of controlling the other man. It had always been the biggest flaw in their relationship, John’s knowledge that Sherlock was as fickle as mercury and that he was unable to do anything about it.
But there were the other times, when they were not together, the days of waiting, of not being able to communicate at all, that was beginning to tear him down.
So, naturally it hurt, and it tormented him to think about any of it, but luckily work, as it usually did, offered him some well-needed reprieve and his focus could be on what he was doing at the moment, nothing else.
Reminded of that evening and the veritable Bond villain lair in the basement he hoped Sherlock hadn’t decided to invite his brother to join them during the examination. It would not be surprising though, Mycroft seemed liked the type of man who would want to oversee things himself. Or perhaps he had a camera installed somewhere and didn’t need to be in the same room personally to survey anything.
The hint of relief made the brooding features dissipate from Magnussen’s eyes, returning to their usual cool indifference once more.
Without looking at him, Sherlock shrugged, staring out across the lake, making it difficult to tell what he was truly feeling. Not that John had ever been very good at predicting what went on inside his head.
John still felt himself reeling from the onslaught of information he had received and anger was rapidly rising inside of him. Because suddenly Magnussen’s creepiness increased with the force of an avalanche crashing down over him and those sinister paintings he had seen at Magnussen’s flat, the dark shadowy spectre reaching out for a young man’s throat, suddenly held a completely different meaning to him. A part of him also felt anger towards Sherlock who so readily seemed to have come to terms with his fate. '
“I wasn’t sure what to expect walking in here. I heard that something as insignificant as a wasp was almost able to kill you today. I always assumed you would be killed by pirates or from sticking your nose into the business of a gang of highway men. You always were a person suited to die from an utterly outlandish reason.”
Whatever impassiveness Mycroft is displaying at the moment, it will not be John’s course of action. He is more like a badger with his teeth dug deep into a victim’s leg, never letting go, when his mind is set to it, and nothing causes his protectiveness to flare quite like Sherlock under threat.
John contemplated this for a second but found it difficult to wrap his head around it none the less.
“Of course it was all a ruse, doctor. If you really think about it, who would fall that easily for a person they don’t even know without some sort of motive lurking in the background? I must confess that I was quite surprised by how easily persuaded you were to go along with what I was offering; I had expected to be having to work much harder. But you just yielded like putty in my hands, like a dog gagging for whatever bone I was willing to throw you. It was quite remarkable when you think about it. And it also confirmed my suspicions that you were so terribly lonely, so desperate for affection, that you simply refused to see the cracks in the picture you had created for yourself. My methods wouldn’t have worked on just anybody, but you proved to be the perfect candidate.”
Even more surprising was the fact that the man was still wearing the uniform Sherlock had arranged for him to wear to complete the disguise.
It didn’t really come as a surprise when Magnussen insisted on joining Mycroft, given the man’s interest in his brother, and the unexpected turn this whole situation had taken. And as he was the provider of the information necessary to solve the riddle of Sherlock’s likely destination, there was not much Mycroft could do to prevent Magnussen from coming along.
Then he nimbly jumped down from the window, the dressing gown billowing around his ankles and the knot that was holding the garment together looked like it was about to slip loose.
“She’s being trying to force me on this new diet lately, all plant-based food. I know I should probably drop a couple of pounds, but I bloody hate it. I could kill for a couple of beers and a piece of that delicious pork pie they serve at the pub.”
Then he turned his back and left, Sherlock standing where he was in the middle of his chaotic room, abandoned to his own devices once more and John couldn’t help but feel for him, stuck in this house like some locked-up pet, seemingly under his brother’s control, waiting to be married off to a man John knew nothing about but who, if Mycroft was to be believed, would continue to keep his future husband under as much scrutiny as Mycroft did right now.
“....has...done something well beyond duty...,” he tried, and he could see the glimmer of Magnussen’s teeth as his lips parted in a lecherous grin.
“If I can’t rely on your discretion and help in this matter, I have no further use for you, Dr Watson.”
The assignment consisted of getting close to someone that had operated in the periphery for many years and until recently had been nothing but an unpleasant presence Mycroft and his colleagues had grown accustomed to accepting but who didn’t pose a true threat to anyone.
“I had no idea how important that project was. To me at the time, Mycroft was simply a much older, pompous, boring busybody in a suit with an overblown ego who needed to be brought down a peg or two.”
But the handle remained firmly out of reach as the butler had grabbed a firm hold of his arm after the initial blow, preventing him from storming inside and next the ominous sound of a lock being turned was heard, as a final barrier between him and the occupants of the room.
He can understand the sense of regret though. Anderson had felt it for a completely different reason, but the emotion is probably the same as it is for him. The wish for actions once made to become undone. To be given a second chance.
But the hours came and went without any sign of Sherlock’s return and eventually John reluctantly succumbed to sleep.
With those final words he leaned forward and grabbed Sherlock around the waist, pulling him down from the windowsill.
It was just the realisation that this might possibly be the last time he saw Sherlock alive that made it so bloody difficult.
John felt terribly jealous over what they had and it was eating him up inside during the hours of the night when he tried to get some sleep but instead plagued himself by picturing the other two locked in passionate embrace, kissing each other, grinding their bodies against one another, while he lay abandoned and alone in some cot, agonising over what he couldn’t have.
Sherlock had discreetly looked for a second safe of course, discreetly because he didn’t want to endure the ridicule of being called easily duped if it had just been a ploy. But so far he had not managed to find one in his brother’s house, in his office or at the family estate. He was still indecisive if one actually existed. Despite the boring content, the documents he had paged through had been important after all, and with Mycroft you just never knew.
Considering the cheetah and the baboon in the park outside the house, this was likely of a similar category. Exotic and lethal, probably poisonous. And that idea, joint with the fact that he was tied up to a bed with no way of defending himself, was what sent chills down his spine.
“So what is it you suggest that we do with him? If you don’t show up, he’s bound to come looking for you. I don’t want him here, or coming to my house, it’s too intrusive. Neither do I want him coming to look for you at Baker Street and realise that he has a serious contender in Doctor Watson. Nothing puts a dampener on things quite like ending up face to face with a boyfriend. I’m not even sure it’s such a good idea to avoid him the way you suggest. It might aggravate him further, push him into making rash decisions.”
“No matter. It will be a nice little surprise. He likes surprises, doesn’t he? Everyone usually does.”
If they for some reason failed, there would be other plans, other ideas, it could not be the end surely? Not really?
Luckily, Mycroft had already edited a lot of the more compromising bits so the damage was minimal, bit it still annoys him that he had failed to prevent Dr Watson from almost exposing his little secret.
He took a deep breath of the cold night air, filled his lungs with it before slowly exhaling, then headed all the way down to the shore.
John froze for a second, one leg hallway through his trousers as he cast a bewildered look at Sherlock who had now turned very pale.
With his scrutinizing eye he noticed that there was something a little unsettling about the other man as he stepped inside Mycroft’s office.
His biggest concern this moment was not his brother though, but a whole other level of discomfort in the shape of a familiar figure marching towards him in angry strides from the entrance door less than two hours after the hired ambulance had left the premises.
“Come now, Dr Watson. I’m a businessman, trying to make a good deal is what I do for a living, can’t fault me from trying to get my money’s worth.”
“For various reasons he lives with me at the moment and will continue to do so until the wedding. What I expect of you, if you decide to except my proposition, is to come here twice a week to do a health check-up and then give me a written report afterwards. If anything happens to him beyond those two weekly instances that requires medical care you are naturally expected to come and perform your duties, but I suspect those occasions will not be too frequent. It’s more as a precautionary measure. The car will be at your disposal when your presence here is needed but otherwise you are to continue living in your current location and perform your normal duties until this assignment is finished. As I mentioned earlier, the pay will be significantly improved but that will also mean that your loyalties are with me and that your reports after each visit will be accurate and carefully written down before handed over to me. If I need to talk to you in person I expect you to be available and you are officially on duty 24 hours a day even if that will hardly be demanded of you, not even my brother manages to get up to something stupid at every single hour.”
He soon fell asleep again and slipped in and out of a dreamlike state where images of last night had played before his eyes in a never-ending loop in what felt like hours until he had finally woken up properly and felt rested enough to struggle against the desire to succumb yet again to slumber.
So instead, as Tuesday came, he went for his usual morning swim after a sleepless night of twisting and turning, in an effort to clear his head before heading to work with the others at eight. But at around nine he was approached by one of his colleagues with the message that a car was waiting for him outside.
He searched for Sherlock’s lips and kissed them softly. They were cold but when connecting with his, he felt a warmth settling inside his chest and fell even deeper into their kiss. As he finally broke off to get some air he tried looking into the dark bottomless orbs that constituted the younger man’s eyes.
Then, with a forceful blow with the briefcase and a silent prayer that the impact wasn’t going to cause more than a temporary knock-out, John watched the butler go down with a thud on the carpet, at the moment taken out, giving John the opportunity to execute what he had in mind.
It wasn’t a straight-out apology but some sort of olive branch at least and John accepted it for what it was. They hardly knew each other anyway, he had no idea what kind of feelings, if any, Sherlock might be suffering from at the moment, but it did seem reasonable to assume that some sort of regret lingered as an afterthought even if a small part of John hoped that Sherlock’s relationship perhaps wasn’t as solid if he so eagerly jumped in the sack with another man at the first opportunity that presented itself.
“Mycroft is the most powerful man you will ever encounter and yet officially he runs an obscure science lab for the Government outside of London, so you do the math. It’s not meant for normal people to be able to figure out what he does for a living.”
“Are you sure that he knows what it is that you need from him, your precious doctor? It’s quite a lot to ask for. He isn’t, as you already pointed out, a great actor and he’s is too governed by feelings, so for him to deal with a man like Magnussen....”
The only unknown variables were how painful his death was going to be and the duration of time before he drew his last breath. If he hadn’t been so personally involved in the end result it would have been an interesting experiment to conduct. As it was now, it was simply the tragic result of very unexpected circumstances and unfortunately unchangeable. There was nothing he could do to alter any of it.
Then Tuesday came and Tuesdays were usually when he had taken the car over to the Holmes household to tend to his patient, but that was naturally not going to happen now.
Perhaps he had confused his role with that of a butler, or perhaps he was simply trying to ease his way into Mycroft’s favour by being exceedingly accommodating to his little brother.
The sole occupant of the far larger chair behind the desk was no Bond villain but certainly not far off it either, minus the swivelling chair and the white cat.
As he languidly stroked himself to the memory of Sherlock’s tight trousers clinging to his pert behind as he had walked up the stairs, John hoped that he would be able to keep that promise and avoid getting himself involved too much.
“And how did you manage to rid yourself of Charles Magnussen then? I saw your men taking a bunch of photos of him and Sherlock, are those for blackmailing purposes or what?”
The picture of Sherlock running down the street with his shirt open, his coat flapping behind his back away from Magnussen’s flat, was still firmly ingrained in Mycroft’s mind, especially the fact that his brother had seemed almost giddy in his features, like a small boy playing truant on school hours, or having pulled off a really successful prank. It was highly worrisome.
“When I spoke to Victor earlier he was clearly taken by surprise when I told him about my resignation. Why had he not been informed earlier? Would that not have prevented him from coming after me tonight?”
John decided to join them and when a servant opened up he stepped inside, following the couple, after telling his name to the man at the door who gave his uniform a curios look but beyond that was nothing but cordial in his welcome. At least it seemed Victor had not decided to make a fool of him by leaving him standing outside without being allowed entrance.
Because wasn’t it rather strange the way this had all so suddenly unravelled into this unexpected aftermath from a sexual encounter John had certainly fantasized about but never, even in his wildest dreams had thought would become a reality.
Mycroft had always had a childish fear of the powers of nature, despite never having been the victim of anything more dramatic than a bout of hail during a summer holiday they had spent in France when he was 14 and he had not been quick enough to run for cover. It had been a very unpleasant and painful experience but not even remotely dangerous and yet it had scared him enough to fear all dramatic changes in weather for years to come.
That the formidable Mycroft Holmes had a younger brother who was almost as equally brilliant in his own right but completely untameable, looked nothing like a stuffy old bureaucrat but instead worked as some sort of consultant to Scotland Yard, made the rumour mill run wild at the mention of his name.
“Without giving away too much, he came on to me and I was happy to oblige, even if I would never have made the first move myself. I’m a professional doctor after all, engaging sexually with a patient is not something I’ve ever done before and never would do under normal circumstances. I was naïve enough to fall for his seductive skills and I’m afraid that I was too smitten to end it when I should have. It happened pretty early into the arrangement and it didn’t stop until I resigned.”
John lowered his head to suck on one of the hardened nipples, swirling his tongue over it while he heard Sherlock moan in pleasure, his arms stretched out over his head so his ribcage became prominent and John allowed his hands to run up and down over his torso while he bit softly into the taught flesh of Sherlock’s concave stomach, so much flatter and smoother than his own. So utterly perfect, so gorgeous that he could scarcely believe he was the one allowed to enjoy claiming that body.
“And that is the very reason why I’m beginning to hesitate doing business with you, Mr Magnussen. I’m not sure why exactly you’re interested in what I have to offer but from your insinuations I assume you want to stick it to the Holmes brothers. And that’s is fine by me, I have no loyalties towards them. But there is a sentimental aspect to all of this, nonetheless. Sherlock Holmes broke my heart. It can be quite difficult to put a prize on feelings. And as you mentioned, if he, God forbid, should pass away, I’m not sure that I....”
He had kept his gun pointed at the door determinedly with a steady hand while waiting for his arrival, but despite this very obvious, eye-catching gesture, the violent doctor seemed to ignore it completely because he just charged in and ran with full force into John.
Outside the sun is still shining over the roof tops and it has the promise of being an exceptionally fine afternoon.
Without replying, Magnussen leaned over Mycroft to take a proper look at the newcomer. He didn’t extend a hand or greet him, he just gave John a thorough one over, then leaned back in his seat again.
Victor Trevor was still going to marry Sherlock, Magnussen was most likely having his way with the groom-to-be right this minute and then he was going to come after John with all the resources and need for retaliation that such a man had at his disposal. What Mycroft’s fate in all of this was going to be was anyone’s guess, but it didn’t matter, Magnussen was going to ruin them all and most likely enjoy himself immensely while doing so.
Another pause. Magnussen ran his finger along the rim of his cup as he contemplated this piece of news for a second.
“I can’t believe you’re taking advice from Mycroft regarding anything!” John barked, throwing his arms out in frustration.
“I’m calling for my own transport home, so don’t bother coming with us. I have had enough of your company for the evening, Mr  Magnusseb. John! We’re leaving!””
“If you stuff your face with any more canapés, you’re going to ruin your diet,” he whispered tetchily while pressing a finger inside his own collar, as if the bow tie was doing him an injustice by merely existing. Mycroft resisted the urge to push his brother’s fingers away from the collar while he took a deep breath before replying, trying to remain calm.
“You won’t be able to get any fresh air through those, they’re firmly sealed. Another safety precaution, but not mine but my brother’s.”
But the man who is standing in front of John right now seems utterly incapable of being neither patronising nor in control of the situation.
They had gone straight back to Baker Street and fucked each other later that same day and had kept doing it right until the day before the wedding. Afterwards it never happened again, neither the kissing nor the sex.
“Tell you what. Allow me this timeslot, just a little bit of leeway to think it through and I’ll meet you at your house at 22:30 tonight, how’s that? If you won’t give me a full day to think about this, at least grant me this. Otherwise I’m afraid that I’ll be forced to decline your offer. I’m just not comfortable making decisions, especially of this delicate nature, without the option to think them through.”
Normally it would be the other way around, that he longed for his two weekly visits to meet with Sherlock and the days when he had to work his regular job seemed menial and uninspiring.  But now he felt endlessly grateful that he had his old assignments to return to, that he had something to occupy his mind with as the thoughts of Sherlock and his fiancé and his own complicated situation in the middle of it all would have made him go barmy otherwise.
Sherlock sighed again and then cast a quick glance over his shoulder before he lowered his voice into a whisper.
A glint of mischief in his eyes told John that he already had something particular in mind and he couldn’t help but sigh and wonder what the hell he had gotten himself into.
An agent can easily be bribed, but Sherlock’s flatmate is unfortunately of sterner stuff, all honourable and full of principles. How he has managed to live with Sherlock without losing some of that morality is a question that keeps baffling Mycroft from time to time.
As he reached out to turn down the lid of his laptop, he decided that the easiest way of finding out what Sherlock was actually up to was to reach out to the source closest to him and try finding some answers from him.
The cigarette glowed between his fingers like a welcoming beacon and John longed to reach out and take it, pry it from those long slender digits, dispose of it like he had always tended to do. Those glittering eyes looking at him, full of anticipation, peering at him from under raven dark curls with a mischievous smile on his lips.
“Mr Magnussen, this is my younger brother Sherlock. He showed me the curtesy of accompanying me this evening, despite his misgivings about the nature of the event.”
“Oh, I’ll try to take that into consideration as I continue conducting my own life in the very limited way you have allowed me to.”
“So I’ve been told. And yet it’s nothing compared to the agonies you’ll be in, an hour from now, when the venom will begin to paralyse your system from the inside. Of course, your speech will be one of the first things to go, so not much screaming by then.”
John panted from exertion as he looked at the shambles in front of him and the sound of a satisfied snort escaped his lips which was ironic as he simultaneously realised that this was simply a petty revenge that wouldn’t even put a dent in whatever plans Magnussen had in store for all of them.
Sherlock simply shrugged although a satisfied glint in his eyes gave him away. He was clearly pleased about something but apparently wanted to play hard to get for  some reason.
Trying to control himself and not to get ahead of things John kept his calm though and defiantly denied the other man the pleasure of seeing him take offence from his words.
He took a deep breath and collected himself, straightened his back as well as his shoulders in resolution. Enough of the wallowing, eyes on the prize and just get on with it, Captain Watson, he thought, bracing himself for whatever was going to happen as he stepped into Magnussen’s office tonight.
He could feel Sherlock’s fingers gripping frantically at his head, as if trying to stop himself from unravelling, holding on for dear life as John took one of the balls into his mouth, circled his tongue around it before plopping it out of his mouth and rub it between his fingers instead.
He cut himself off before he had uttered the rest of the sentence. “No, don’t answer that. Is this what you use that chemistry set of yours to do? Cooking your own drugs and producing homemade lubricant?”
Sherlock was clearly in a good mood if his eager movements up and down John’s hardening cock was any indication. That probably meant that he had been successful in achieving results with Magnussen last night, and settling with that knowledge for now, happy that Sherlock was back unharmed, John relaxed into the other man’s touch and allowed himself to enjoy the pleasure his flatmate was bestowing upon him. Even if Sherlock often was an eager participant in sexual activities at all hours of the day, this was still a rather unexpected awakening as far as John was concerned, but who was he to complain?
“I know that Mycroft has appointed you to be my doctor, but I rather have you as something else, something of my own choosing. Don’t worry, officially you will still act as my physician and you’ll get whatever reward he has promised you in the end, but meanwhile, why not just play him for the fool that he is right under his nose and do what we want instead? He will be none the wiser, I promise you.”
At first there wasn’t a reply, merely continuous gasps of pain, but then a stressed voice came from the dark:
Just as he was ready to get out of the car before Mycroft would try to persuade him with yet another offer, he paused for a second and then decided to say something that had been nagging on his mind ever since Saturday night.
He looked a bit bored to be honest which was yet another detail John felt was slightly odd. This was in honour of his brother and his future brother in law, surely some expression of interest wouldn’t be too much to ask for?
It was enough for Mycroft to know that what Magnussen subjected his brother to during his nightly visits to his bedroom was probably so horrible it made him sick even thinking about it.
he thought, despite recognising the absurdity of that word, because Sherlock was still chained to Magnussen’s bed and he was bloody
When dressed and suitably groomed, he took a cup of strong coffee to steel himself for the veritable onslaught Sherlock might hurl at him when and if they made contact later that day.
Magnussen seemed more interested in shouting out his dominance and taste for opulence and with that thought in mind, John was greeted at the entrance by a woman in such a strikingly lilac tight-fitting dress and staggeringly high-heeled shoes that John at first didn’t take her for Magnussen’s P.A but a woman stepping out of a fashion spread.
It was taken from right in front of him. From where Magnussen must have stood because Sherlock was looking right into the camera with that alluring glint in his eyes. From that angle it told him that it must have been at the same level as Magnussen’s face.
He stared out into the darkness and the emptiness of the room, well aware that the rest of the house was empty as well, just as it had been when he had entered it this afternoon. He was all alone now.
“That he got a little sneak peak of the entertainment to be had the other night and now I withdraw it, which will result in him becoming increasingly eager to see what it is that he’s missing out on. And a person with his main focus turned in one direction is bound to stop paying attention to all the other diversions that surrounds him. We need to rile him up a little bit.”
“As they should. But keep it that way, no matter what he might try to persuade you into believing. I have known him my whole life and I have yet to learn how to not allow him to get under my skin, he is the only one who can reduce me to a person who occasionally
Of course there was still the expected little white lie between them at times, he succumbed to that habit himself when the situation demanded it or he simply couldn’t stand the other alternative, but engaging in sexual activities with another man did hardly fall into that category. Therefor it was a relief to be told that there was a logical reason behind everything Mycroft had tried convincing him was immoral behaviour from Sherlock.
Mycroft was rarely this outspoken, not prone to outburst of emotions, and the fact that he had actually combined both physical force as well as a passionate speech, told Sherlock that his brother was rattled by the situation.
Freshly shaved and quickly dressed, he cast a look in the mirror that hung above his bed. For the last couple of months he had managed to regain some of the muscle mass he has lost while recuperating in a hospital bed after having been shot in the shoulder. His skin was slightly tanned from spending a lot of time outdoors and his body felt solid and firm again, like it had been before he had been sent down from Kandahar on account of his injury.
Instead he cleared his throat and managed to tear his eyes away from the part where the robe was threatening to fall open and reveal even more than it already did.
“Are you out?” he said the second Mycroft picked up. He could hear noises in the background so at least that must mean that they had managed to put some distance between themselves and the house.
“Cat caught you tongue?” his antagonist purred, his hand straightening his spectacles while looking at John, the satisfaction of victory evident in his features. “Suffice to say, you’ve been caught in a situation far above your meagre level of intelligence and as I mentioned earlier, you and I will have a discussion about actions and consequences soon enough. But as you might realise, my other guest is in dire need of a lesson as well, and he is a rather more pressing matter.... He is so delectably presented for my benefit, it would be rude of me to not favour him above you. Surely you understand my order of priorities....”
“Who cares, I haven’t bothered talking to him. He always comes across as perpetually displeased with us all, he can very well entertain himself if he made the decision to come here. My boss says that he has icicles where his balls should be. I’m just happy I don't have to work directly with him, just imagine what his staff has to suffer through.”
Sherlock really needed to tread lightly with that man or he would risk aggravating the doctor even further than he had done previously and they could hardly afford a second falling-out.
“We wanted to keep your resignation a secret for a little while longer. When he asked Mycroft why you weren’t at the house, tending for me, Mycroft came up with some sort of desperate lie to prevent further questioning.”
Unlikely as a friendship developing under these conditions sounded, it had in fact happened, and for a brief second they had stayed content in that phase, until John’s subconscious started yearning for something more and he developed feelings that in the beginning resembled nothing more than a silly crush he most of the time tried to ignore.
She didn’t seem content by his words though but instead just rambled on about the prick of a man who had scorned her.
But despite his wearisome persona, Magnussen couldn’t deny the lucky circumstances that had caused their paths to cross and how gleeful he had felt that night when the significance of Victor’s story had hit him and the endless possibilities to take advantage of the situation had presented themselves.
Sherlock turned silent for a moment, allowing those words to sink in, looking deeply into John’s eyes before he continued.
As far as it went case-wise, it was a pretty straight forward affair. In fact, calling it a case would actually be stretching the truth a little bit, it was more like a ruse, an under-cover operation that would not require much work at all from any of them.
He can’t deal with her now, not when he is unravelling by the seams. She will simply have to wait or turn to Mycroft if she wants further information.
As he no longer felt his legs he couldn’t tell if the situation was the same down there but his other arm went through the same liberating feeling and he actually managed to raise one of them, the one without the bite, so he could see it in front of him for a few seconds before it limply fell down across his chest.
The biggest question was perhaps who this person actually was and what in God’s name he was doing here? The place had gates as well as surveillance cameras, so it was no easy task to just walk straight in, but he also did not look like a normal intruder, for one he didn’t seem to have any proper equipment with him to help him make a break in.
But Sherlock was not one for playing the submissive part, not even for pretend, and despite considering the occasional power play with John back at home, he wasn’t prepared to adapt a role that would leave him vulnerable in the hands of Magnussen.
He didn’t feel like he was dying, not yet, and that was another strange experience he would gladly have scribbled down if he had had any further use for such knowledge. Seemed pretty pointless right now though.
He was alone and he was slightly exhausted from the lack of sleep last night, as well as the tension from earlier today. There was no harm in indulging in some innocent fantasies, as long as he knew what boundaries to uphold during the times he actually met with Sherlock and remembered that he was hired to do a job, nothing else.
“If you’re only just now asking yourself that question, Dr Watson, I’m going to be terribly disappointed. But assumingly my brother’s silver tongue has managed to beguile yet another man to follow him down the path to destruction, so maybe it shouldn’t surprise me that you don’t know who you’re dealing with. A little late to turn back now, I should think, but of course there is still that option I guess.”
To his displeasure, none of these options gave him any satisfaction though, not even when moving on from theory to action by throwing a few shirts down on his bed as if to pack them in a suitcase, or snatching Sherlock’s very expensive headphones down from the bison skull and dumping them in the bin.
“Walk with me and I’ll try to tell you everything, as far as I’m able to. And try to bear with me, because it’s a long and arduous tale that doesn’t have a happy ending. But maybe you need to hear it to understand why it can not be you and me beyond what we already have, sneaking around behind people’s backs, illicit kisses and sex only when we know that we are alone. But considering circumstances, that’s better than nothing.”
This was bound to assure Sherlock a future invitation to Appledore pretty soon. Magnussen was hardly going to resist speeding up the pace after this latest stunt, and once accomplishing an entrance to Appledore, the possibilities where infinitely greater.
“Well, I don’t know. Seems pretty creepy to me,” John mumbled. “I’m no expert on art but I think it might be a bit too dark for my taste.”
“Why do you even care about this? As you pointed out earlier, it’s been two months already, what’s another two in the larger scheme of things? This whole situation will cease to be your responsibility after the time is up and you won’t have to suffer through any more reports.”
Sherlock had fought their arrangement quite aggressively in the beginning, lashing out at Victor, trying to break him down.
Being more experienced he guided the younger man to different ways of achieving the most pleasurable orgasms but Sherlock was a quick learner who not only took John’s advice but soon also managed to excel at his task by accomplishing sexual performances that made John’s cock hard as rock just thinking about them. It occasionally made him doubt that Sherlock truly was such an innocent ingénue in this field as he presented himself to be, but he chose to not stoke those flames of doubt any further, deciding to just enjoy what he had and not overanalyse things too much.
Even if Mycroft was taller and weighed significantly more, being an intimidating person himself when he chose to be, he wasn’t a fighter the way his brother was and not nearly as unpredictable. He had never bothered with boxing, fencing or martial arts, all of which Sherlock excelled at, and even if he dealt with mind games and stratagems on a regular basis, no one deceived like his little brother, causing him to back away whenever Sherlock stepped up.
Because, after all, it was Magnussen who came off as the true villain in this situation even if Victor certainly had accomplished his fair share of devilry as well.
“I’m not completely sure I know what you are referring to, but it is understandably a tricky situation to be talking about your former patient, especially as you are still working for the same employer who also happens to be his older brother. That cannot be easy for you, Dr Watson.”
There had in fact never even been a question of making a choice, it was always going to end like this and John had been too naïve to have fully grasped that fact despite Sherlock telling him this at the beginning of their sexual relationship.
He had learned not to ask Sherlock about what exactly his experiments consisted of as he never managed to receive a satisfying answer and more often than not did it only cause him to feel alarm over what his brother had chosen to spend his time on. The more absurd the better seemed to be Sherlock’s motto.
He was hurt and angry and all Sherlock was interested in doing was to taunt him even further for some unfathomable reason. But a line had to be drawn at physical violence, he could not allow his anger to get the better of him.
There is a bond between the two flatmates, he saw it already on that first night, even if he tried to tamper down the uneasy feeling he got when seeing them walk away together into the night after having solved the case of  the cab driver turned serial killer.
“Nothing but humiliation and misery....” John muttered, managing to actually tap into the feelings he had initially felt when first falling out with Sherlock, leaving out the detail of genuine heartbreak, both for his own sake but also because he didn’t want Magnussen to get to the true core of his feelings for Sherlock.
He was perfectly capable of acting in the interest of the general public and his country but he had no further interest in participating in their lives beyond that.
“Hm, with your attitude, probably not. You’re one of those who think too highly of yourself, it’s that cockiness of yours that landed you in this mess to begin with. But, hypothetically yes, a warning, if properly accepted, might have sufficed. You chose not to listen, thereby signing your own fate.”
This isn’t the first time Sherlock has been abducted, but none the less, this does indeed sound like a foe above average if Mycroft is anything to go by, and despite trying to remain calm in the face of danger, John hopes for this to be over with soon enough.
He had no idea what sort of dinner party this was going to be beyond that it was to celebrate the upcoming wedding of a couple soon to be married and assumingly that it was going to be a fancy event, but just how fancy or what the dictated dress code for the evening was, went beyond his knowledge.
“While, waiting to hear from them, tell me all you know about my brother’s behaviour from the moment I left yesterday. But please, feel free to exclude all
“But you were a bloody teenager! High on cocaine for God’s sake! Surely that would be considered justifying circumstances?”
And when the moon came out from behind a cloud and exposed both of them with a little bit of light and he was hit with the sight of those familiar features, the dark curls moving in the cool night breeze and that slim frame all dressed in black, he felt as if he had preferred it if he had been spared to look at what had once been so dear to him.
But he had a funny expression on his face while making these denials which made John silently question if he did in fact have some knowledge about the stranger’s identity.
He also remembered seeing his own army weapon hanging loosely from Victor’s hand and then the two lifeless bodies lying inside the room, with Magnussen hunched half-way over the bed, trousers round his ankles, his cock still erect which could have given the sight a somewhat comical touch if not for the severity of the situation.
“We are about to strike up a deal, you and I, and that is what we shall do shortly enough. But first, there is a little matter I need to attend to. The schedule of a man in my position never allows for any pauses, you see. Please feel free to join me, it will be very brief and then we can get down to business.”
“How droll…” Mycroft rolled his eyes and put his glass down. “He was very agitated and adamant that he would never return to this house ever again, that I was somehow to blame for your impending marriage to Victor and that the wedding should immediately be cancelled or it would lead to your untimely death. It was all rather morbid to listen to, like some fortune-teller crowing about all the evil that was going to befall us. That man has some serious anger-management issues if you ask me.”
John couldn’t help but roll his eyes for emphasis, once he had begun allowing jealousy to seep into his words it was surprisingly difficult to stop it seemed. But whatever Mycroft had picked up on regarding any underscoring tones in John’s words he didn’t address them, instead he just crisply replied:
Allowing the sense of relief to settle, he was just about to move forward, passing one of those luscious lilacs that he enjoyed the scent of when passing them on his way to the lake every morning, when he suddenly felt an arm snake its way around his middle and a gust of breath against his neck sent a jolt of fear down his spine despite his best effort to tamper down any sudden movements. His whole body went rigid and he wished he had made the effort to reclaim his gun after all.
“You’re being too modest. That’s not a quality that anyone will thank you for in the end. Sherlock Holmes thrives on getting under his brother’s skin, that’s hardly something that will ever stop as long as they’re both breathing. No, I think it must be down to something else, something that apparently only you can provide. “
“That wasn’t solely because of Magnussen. If the victim hadn’t done something himself, Magnussen wouldn’t have been able to blackmail him in the first place.”
He immediately waived those thoughts away though. That was no longer of any concern to him. It was a normal reaction to become worried about Sherlock’s welfare as he had cared very deeply for him and to an extent still did, but nothing good could come from getting himself involved again.
But however observant Sherlock always claimed himself to be, he either didn’t see John’s darkening eyes or he simply didn’t care, because he continued in the same mocking tone.
“Good boy,” John whispered as he pushed his cock further down Sherlock’s throat while he grabbed a handful of dark curls to dictate the pace himself.
These visits to Sherlock’s bedroom were kept secret from Victor of course, as not even Magnussen was particularly keen to deal with a livid and jealous husband-to-be.
The nervous-looking woman who opened the door had not been present the other night and had no idea who Sherlock was, so with a confused look in her eyes she began to explain that the master of the house was not at home and that she couldn’t let anyone in without his specific order to do so.
As Mycroft had no idea what John and Sherlock were up to, he had no reason to check old camera feeds or time stamps to keep track of John’s coming and goings, but it still felt safer to take the secret pathway today.
Besides, Magnussen had his own hold over Sherlock now, so no matter how this evening progressed, the Magnussen dilemma was very much still an unresolved predicament, just with an unexpected twist to it.
“But I’m not willing to accept your offer,” John angrily cut him off as he turned his head to face him.
Magnussen feigned to ponder this question, as if the idea had never crossed his mind before. It was just ridiculous affectations and it annoyed Mycroft that the other man seemed to be playing a game with all of them, despite his own efforts to remain in control.
And after that, there had been no time to ponder the question further as he had mere minutes later received enough blows and punches to render him both injured as well as unconscious.
This was the first time John had heard any of them mention the Holmes brothers, but he realised that they probably knew a lot more than they had let on during his time working here.
It was almost painful to watch the other man finally come to the realisation of what must have happened to him, his speech coming to a halt as he looked at the cup, his words jogging his memory as he put the situation in context with his own very unexpected session of deep sleep.
There were too many unknown variables to who Dr Grimesby Roylott really was, for Mycroft’s liking, but at least they were headed for his home now, the rest would hopefully fall into place upon arrival.
Mycrofts starts pacing, not unlike Sherlock when deep in thought and John takes a seat in his chair to get out of the way.
“Just don’t forget that you’re not actually offering him any “entertainment” as you so eloquently put it.  He needs to think that you are, but there will of course be none of that on offer. Keep that in mind,” Mycroft said in a warning tone.
“Keep telling yourself that and one day you might believably be able to convince yourself that it’s actually true,” he murmured.
But instead of showing how affected he got by all of this, he kept his tone professional and placed the cold stethoscope between the jutting shoulder blades.
“He’s just envious. The diet he’s just started on isn’t working, that’s bound to annoy him immensely and make him more irritable. Don’t worry about it.”
Satisfied that he had done what he could at the moment, he hoped this would create the desired rift between Victor and Magnussen as well as get himself off Victor’s radar so he could focus on his own dealings with Magnussen.
He had helped bring some life back into John’s empty existence, made it worth living again. Sherlock had made John feel love when he thought he never would, he had made these past couple of months the best as well as the worst in his life and now it had suddenly come to a screeching halt.
The look of surprise in Victor's eyes afterwards could easily have rivalled his own. Who knew that someone who had seemed so indestructible could so easily cease to exist?
“Wasn’t there that incident a while back, when an ambulance actually came here? I just knew it was related to him.”
The room itself was very bleak and spartan, consisting mostly of a large mahogany desk, not unlike the material of the door, a computer on one side and a globe in black and chrome on the other, a painting of the Queen in her younger years, dressed in royal regalia on the wall behind and then a simple chair in front of the desk, most likely put there to make any visitor feel inferior.
health, are we?” he said as he lay with his head against John’s firm shoulder, trailing a finger along his naked torso one afternoon.
John gave him a long hard look but realised that Mycroft most likely meant what he said, it was a matter of solving this situation without causing any further problems and as much as John hated to be bullied into doing anything, he realised that he wasn’t willing to leave either.
As he had gotten this information off his chest he took a deep breath before he finally decided to turn around and face the dark shadow that still stood pointing his gun at him but clearly had lost the will to actively use it as a way of intimidation.
But despite other differences between that situation and this, the two red dots were achingly familiar and however perplexing it sounded, his first though actually was that it looked as if Sherlock had been subjected to a snake bite.
Those last words were uttered with a despicably sweet voice dripping with sarcasm and Mycroft pursed his lips at the obvious dig at his ability to stick to the truth.
“He will remain in hospital tonight  but will arrive here at nine tomorrow morning and I expect you to be here to greet him,” Mycroft continued. “A car will pick you up at a quarter past eight and your meeting will take as long as necessary. I’ll inform your supervisor of your absence and afterwards I’ll be expecting your first rapport before the evening. You will be given access to his medical journal after your meeting and whatever questions you might have I’ll be willing to provide them for you if I can.”
And he kept doing it until the whole painting was lying in ruins in front of him, broken and distorted, the frame hanging in pieces and the motif no longer portraying what it initially had so brazenly showcased to every viewer.
John should have realised that when on the trail of something, Sherlock never did let go and Magnussen wasn’t some lillywhite innocent with his hands clean and no hidden skeletons in his closet. Naturally Sherlock hadn’t just dropped the case. He had simply dropped those around him who would object to his methods.
Behind his back he heard Mycroft tell his assistant to leave and he could sense how the older brother slowly approached from behind and came into his line of vision to observe him as he worked, but he continued to pretend that he was alone in the room with his patient, silently praying for some improvement of his state.
“No, considering your choice of house pet, I think I’m willing to concur. But I don’t fear anything either, Dr Roylott.”
Eventually, after what felt like a never-ending journey through hell, with smell of urine, vomit and deep-frying oil from leftover chips attacking his nostrils as he sat opposite a scantily clad couple making out, leaving nothing to the imagination, he had managed to get a cab to take him the remaining route home and once arrived he had stumbled to bed, clothes still on and slept within minutes.
Magnussen was the first to get out and he ascended the steps to greet the doctor before he turned around and made a vague gesture towards John and Mycroft.
Nonetheless he couldn’t help but ask his friend where he had been all day. Sherlock was still in his half-dressed state and John wondered where he could have spent his time looking like that. Hopefully he hadn’t met with Magnussen looking like he had just stepped out of bed and not bothered with dressing properly. That could easily have sent the wrong kind of signals.
John’s face came closer again and it felt like Sherlock was now being lifted from the bed, the feel of John’s arms around his upper body sending a familiar comfort through him, for a second taking precedence over the pulsating pain.
It had been taken shortly after Victor had rekindled their romance again, a photo of Sherlock taken by their wedding photographer that time when Victor had insisted that they should pay the woman a visit to her studio to take a look at her portfolio before deciding to hire her for the job.
Eventually Mycroft will officially accept defeat in the search for his brother, even if he knows John never truly will accept it, and by then this whole episode will be over and done with.
Thankfully there was food and drinks to occupy him, and even if he detested social gatherings like these, he at least tolerated it better than his brother did.
They were all of Sherlock, his naked torso easily recognisable because of a small scar on his scapula that he had received in his early childhood, caused by Mycroft during one of their very rare physical combats.
“But what makes you think this will be a permanent state? You said that you feared Sherlock would never come back....?”
“Mr Trevor invited me the other day. Came by the facility to give me back my medical bag that I had accidentally misplaced and he took the opportunity to extend an invitation.”
If Victor noticed his hostility though, he ignored it completely. Instead he went on as if not having heard a word.
Just as he felt the nausea beginning to subside, his ear caught a strange sound coming from somewhere above his head and without moving anything else, he turned his eyes to the ceiling trying to locate the source.
“So there you have it – a story that began with a night of thoughtless mischief performed by a teenager high on cocaine that then ended with Mycroft and me trapped in this intricate scheme that we have no way of freeing ourselves from.
John waited for a second, hesitant if he should risk a bullet to his back for replying, but as there was an evident pause to the monologue, he took the opportunity to speak his mind.
“Sounds like a recipe for disaster…” John muttered and crossed his arms over his chest to keep himself warm. He had no idea how long he had been out here, first with Victor and now with Sherlock, but his limbs were beginning to feel the effect of being exposed to the chill outside. Wearing boxers and a T-shirt had clearly been a mistake and if he didn’t end up with a cold on account of it, he would be surprised.
Finally as he managed to rip it off him and throw it away from his body, John’s paralyzed state eased up and he managed to tear his eyes away from the horrific scene in front of him and first follow the movements of the snake, to see where it landed, and then he noticed the remnants of a terrarium in the background that he had failed to notice earlier as his full focus had been on Dr Roylott.
“I realise that but I’m not sure that I’m all that interested in what you’re offering anymore. Seems like you don’t know what you’re willing to pay me and I don’t like hustling around like I’m working some street Bazaar trying to sell dodgy watches to a customer who doesn’t know what he wants.”
“No mystery about it, I just accidentally left it behind. No distractions beyond the usual shenanigans your brother puts me through simply by being himself.”
But perhaps that concept had been wiped away when you started working for a man like Magnussen who had based his whole enterprise on revealing the most private darkest secrets imaginable. That probably messed with the perception of what to share and what to keep to yourself.
As I wasn’t sleeping with anyone such a threat didn’t really bother me, but I kept my eye out for him for a few weeks after that phone call, just in case he was going to show up and cause a scene. He never came though and eventually he faded into the past and I forgot about him.
Initially I wasn’t going to include you in any of my plans, as I told you the other night. I thought it best that I pushed you away instead and I still think it is a lot to ask of you to get involved with someone as dangerous as Magnussen and to some extent Victor as well.  But as you have proven to be so irreplaceable to me, I’ve been forced to change my mind and include you nonetheless. Very selfish of me, I know, but there you have it.
But if John Watson at least had the decency to shut up when noticing Mycroft’s discomfort, Charles Magnussen thought differently.
He did not like the idea of fooling anyone out of their money, or fooling anyone regarding anything for that matter, but so far into this ruse he was equally unwilling to end his arrangement with Sherlock, so he had neglected to think too closely about his betrayal of Mycroft’s trust in him.
Trying to squint made no difference, it was still too dark to tell what it was, but he could clearly see that whatever it was, it was slowly making its way down above his head.
As he stormed into his own flat, still high on the success of recent events, throwing his coat across the nearest available surface, he was disappointed to notice that the atmosphere in the room was not as welcoming as he would have hoped.
Without turning his attention to John Mycroft begins to speak, but his voice sounds distant, he is clearly lost in thought.
Their eyes locked, Mycroft trying to figure out if his brother was having him on or if he had actually gone against his very firm instructions and taken the drug instead of playacting like they had agreed upon.
And yet, here he was, staring at a picture of himself half naked and ready to be used as blackmailing material against him, a prospect he, a mere minute ago had not thought actually possible.
After he had completed the initial round of mouth-to mouth as well as chest compressions, he assessed that the biggest issue was the difficulty breathing and turned the body into the recovery position and then reached for his phone to call for an ambulance.
“Whatever happened to things being comfortable as well as interesting?” John had tried but he had only received a teasing nudge to the ribs.
He positioned himself by the door without turning the light on, his back against the room and waited.
John stared at him for a second to see if he was perhaps having him on, but as Sherlock still looked at the bottle in John’s hand quite expectantly, he realised that this probably wasn’t a joke.
As he finished up his lunch, he left the others to talk amongst themselves for the remaining time as he went outside to catch a well-deserved breath of fresh air while contemplating what Sherlock was up to right now.
“You?” was all he managed before the figure standing by the door detached himself from his immobile position in the shadows and resolutely stepped into the room.
It had contained nothing but utterly boring content of no interest to him and therefor he had not bothered with looking inside it again since first breaking into it. Mycroft was apparently very boring when it came to things like that. Naturally his hidden safe
“Where are you meeting him? I don’t like you sneaking out at night to the barracks, someone could see you.”
An incentive was just another word for a threat in Magnussen’s book. What on earth could it have been about? Was it something to with him?
He isn’t normally a person who cares about the superficial qualities in others, but just like his brother’s intellect is dazzlingly sharp like a diamond, there is something about his appearance that appeals to Mycroft on a solely aesthetic level. So he indulges freely by taking in every specific detail of his younger brother’s form as he lies there unconscious on the bed.
Because even if this was a fair deal that could very well lead to good opportunities in the future if he performed his expected duties well, why did it also feel like he was striking up a deal with the devil?
A small voice inside of him insisted that Sherlock might perhaps reciprocate John’s feelings but was too afraid to express them openly, especially considering the complicated situation regarding his upcoming marriage, Mycroft and his seemingly controlling fiancé. He had certainly always looked very happy during their time together and it had been easy for John to bask in that happiness and believe that there were some sort of feelings involved even if Sherlock had never said anything out loud.
John nodded and put his hands on his knees as if he had made a decision. He hoped to project the image of someone who was ready to do business.
Whenever he next clapped his eyes on Sherlock, he would give him a thorough scolding and do everything in his power to solve the Magnussen dilemma as quickly as possible before something truly damaging occurred.
Granted, he would not have been aware of Magnussen’s blackmailing habit, but he would most likely have been unwilling to discuss anything private regarding himself and Sherlock anyway, whatever monetary rewards Magnussen would be inclined to offer him.
John nodded, his eyes for a second turning away to look out the window instead. Behind the tainted windows the world outside looked dark and grey, not a sign of life anywhere. It felt like he was trapped with a snake charmer inside a small cubicle and if he looked into the other man’s eyes, he would somehow become spellbound into doing something he didn’t want to do.
“I know that there is more to this story than what you’re letting on, Sherlock. You’re forgetting who it was that taught you how to omit the truth in a believable way in the first place, a master can always tell when one of his students is trying to copy his methods.”
Disappearing into a haze of lustful fogginess, John let go of his earlier sleepiness, succumbing completely to pure carnal pleasure as the other man brought him to completion and by that action started the day in the best way imaginable.
“A piece of advice, Doctor. You could be the making of my brother or make him worse than ever. I believe that choice is up to you, make the best of that ability.”
There was that combination of old and new that he, despite his dislike of the country itself, actually appreciated. It reminded him of the endless possibilities he had in a city like London where things like class, reputation and a sullied name still had consequences for a person’s life.
His first attempt had been the well-known sexual diversion technique which had arguably been pleasant, and John had indeed seemed sleepy enough afterwards, as content and satisfied as a person thoroughly fucked could possible be. But apparently it had not been enough, and quite to the contrary it had resulted in John becoming even more clingy, insisting they should cuddle afterwards.
Instead of answering, Mycroft wanted to focus on why Sherlock was up at this hour, and why he was here, in their old family house. Not that it was anything unusual for his brother to be awake at night, Sherlock was more a nocturnal being than a creature of the day, thriving in the solitude of the hours when everyone else was asleep, a time which left the rest of the world for him to play with as he chose.
not as easily replaced, even if I’m sure he wishes he could do it sometimes, and as I would never accept anyone else as my doctor, he had to come in person to ask you to return. Don’t ask me what that favour cost me though, it puts me in a foul mood just thinking about it.  Especially as he failed, despite waiving the offer of a bigger salary in front of you. He clearly doesn’t know you at all. Offering money to do his dirty deed was never your biggest motivation after all, was it?”
“Oh, I’m sorry? We were mistaken then? You were not going to die tonight and we all just overreacted, is that it?” he shouted, his face reddening with rising anger.
How could he had been so careless? And how could he have allowed himself to engage in sexual activities with someone like Magnussen in the first place?
Mycroft clams his mouth shut for a second as he comes to a halt in front of the fireplace. He is staring at his own reflection in the mirror placed above it.
A bedridden Sherlock, deprived of his precious confidant, would make him look exposed in Magnussen’s eyes and while his attention would be on Sherlock’s wavering health, Magnussen would also see the opportunity to continue keeping both Mycroft and Sherlock under his thumb by approaching the person who had just suffered a falling-out with the Holmes brothers and probably had all sorts of information to share with him if offered the right price or the proper threat, whatever would produce the best result.
The two chairs usually reserved for himself and John were now occupied by his brother as well as a flatmate that looked like thunder in the face, and immediately a spark of annoyance flared up inside of Sherlock at the sight. It felt like he had walked straight into an ambush and the feeling of elation that had accompanied him all the way from Magnussen’s flat quickly dissipated at the sight of the stern look his brother was giving him.
“When Victor came by the house tonight and I heard him being denied access to visit me and how agitated he became because of it, I figured that there was at least a 30 % chance of him seeking you out to get some answers. I seized the opportunity and came here shortly after he left the house. And predictably, he did not disappoint. Admittedly that gun he had with him was an unexpected twist of events and I didn’t manage to hear much of what you said to each other, except for that final threat you made, but I’m assuming it was the usual stupid possessive tosh. 30 % is admittedly not a particularly good number, but in this case my gamble payed off. Because whatever you might say about Victor, at least his jealousy came in handy for once and accomplished something that I had failed to achieve on my own. Sending a car or my brother to do my bidding has so far not earned me any success at all.”
With the memory of Mycroft’s hidden cameras still intact, he doesn’t feel comfortable spending any time in the flat, especially as every inch of the place reminds him of Sherlock.
There was a miniscule pause before Mycroft continued, his voice more or less back to normal again. If John hadn't seen the utter shock and despair on his features earlier, he could have sworn Mycroft wasn't affected by any of this. But that little pause told him how shaken he still was.
He had always survived and that had been his strength when struggling through it, the determination that he was going to make it.
He then remembered the track marks on the inside of the arms and wondered if perhaps the treatment of a drug addiction would be part of his job description. They had looked old but who knew with addicts, there were endless possibilities to get the desired substances into their system and no one was as resourceful as a substance abuser in dire need of a fix.
John felt the pulsating cock slowly soften as he withdrew his head, a tingle of anticipation run through his body as he heard Sherlock’s breathing even out and then return to normal before he nimbly slid down to John’s level on the floor and kissed him, the taste of semen and saliva mixing in John’s mouth as Sherlock’s tongue penetrated his mouth with eagerness, as if not just having orgasmed spectacularly into John’s mouth a mere moment ago. Sherlock’s stamina was always a wonder to behold, the dexterity of his movements a true blessing in John’s eyes.
“Why ever would I do that?” Roylott spit out, beginning to work himself up into a temper now. “I have no interest in him. His childish efforts at playing detective is of no concern to me. He doesn’t even really know who I am! And to me, he is only that piece of ass you been running after lately, Magnussen, nothing more.”
It was confirmed less than a second later when Magnussen said, the slightest hint of glee to his voice:
Another silence settled and for a second Mycroft wondered if the departure to his bedroom would be delayed even further than it already had been.
“You’re such a talented little cocksucker, aren’t you?” he said and increased the pace even further, knowing that Sherlock could handle him being a bit rough, despite a small gagging sound coming from the outstretched mouth.
“Dr Watson, welcome once again to my home. Perhaps under better circumstances this time around. The last time you were here I believe you were pining terribly for one of the grooms-to-be and had to endure quite an eyeful of someone else staking his claim on him. How a little time and perspective has managed to change circumstances so drastically...”
But for now, if Mycroft wished for Sherlock to have any success in his venture, he needed to leave him alone with Magnussen. So without further ado Mycroft pretended to catch sight of someone he urgently needed to speak to and excused himself. Smoothly he disappeared into the crowd of guests without turning around to see if he would be missed or if Magnussen only had eyes for treat in front of him.
“So what I said before still stands true. You are not easily replaceable to me, John Watson and I’m sorry that I ever made you believe that you were. I’m also apologizing in advance for the trouble I’m about to drag you into, if you’re still willing to return to me that is. Because the reason why I’m here, is to ask if you would consider continuing what we started and come back to me again?”
Making sure that his facial features settle for the mask he is accustomed to wear when playing the part of government official, he heads out of the room, determined to be back within two hours.
“It doesn’t matter you, idiot!” Magnussen hissed, as if beginning to grow tired of the whole situation. His plans had not turned out to his liking and now he didn’t have anything left of Sherlock but a few measly photos and his own memories. It was frankly difficult to say what stung the most, the loss of Sherlock or the missed opportunity to humiliate Mycroft. To his surprise, it seemed to be Sherlock.
“I have heard quite enough from you about Sherlock Holmes to not want to hear his name mentioned again,” Dr Roylott said coldly. “Besides, if his brother is standing right here, don’t you think it wise to tone down the lechery a little bit?”
Mycroft’s lips purse even tighter in disapproval but at least he doesn’t answer back whatever it is he is probably dying to throw in John’s face.
