“What? But those are movies. How will he join something that isn’t real?”
Something bumping Peter’s side draws his attention away. It’s the roll of gauze. His gaze trails to Tony where he sees the man struggling to wrap his head. Peter sighs and puts his book on the table, before walking over to Tony. Peter leans forward almost in Tony’s lap as he starts to bandage the wound.
“You think Ariel’s a little hottie?”
“Yeah buddy,” he says softly rubbing Peter’s back. “I’ll be back before you know it.”
“Are you being serious right now?” Beverly asks.
The next morning, Steve pads down the hall and into the kitchen filling up his water bottle. He is dressed in joggers and a t-shirt, hoping to get in a run before the rest of the house wakes up. He hears light footsteps coming down the hallway and knows that it’s Peter even before he hears him whine out, “Papa”. He wants attention, he buries his face against Steve’s stomach just as his father turns around. Steve tightens the lid on the bottle before he reaches down to rub the back of his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s just a migraine. Feeling a little dizzy.”
“Are you hungry, Tony? I can order something for lunch. Or I might have something quick I can make us,” Steve starts to ramble as he opens the fridge and digs around for something. “Would you like a sandwich?”
It goes on like this for an hour and Tony starts to accept that he probably isn’t going to get any sleep tonight.
She sits up and glares at him.
Natasha is focused on Peter who is trying to ignore everyone else in the room. She walks over and leans down in front of him. “Whatcha watching?”
He sighs before standing up and heading back inside. He needed to start packing and have the conversation with Tony he had been dreading. They were supposed to be spending Thanksgiving together as a family.
“Playing,” he says softly.
“What’s wrong with me texting Morgan?”
“The black paint. All over my canvas. Every morning this week.”
“I’ll be good Papa. Please let me go,” he begs looking up at Steve.
******
Tony kisses her forehead, “why don’t you go play with your brother and the other kids?”
“You brought our son back in one piece. Thank you,” Tony says to them from his spot on the couch. He was lying on his back looking exhausted.
“No-one ever cooks for me anymore. I’m always cooking for us. Tony tried to cook once—”
Steve storms out of the study and into the living-room. After calming himself down, he starts to look around for Beverly. Tony looks around their condo as Steve starts searching the hallway and the common areas of the building.
Sam starts to check for a pulse.
Tony steps back and both of them start laughing. In doubling the number of children in their life, they had doubled the amount of wild things being said.
“How long until we head out?” Natasha asks changing the subject even though she knows the answer because she came up with the plan.
“Where’s your backpack then? Is your lunch in it?”
*****
Steve walks back with Beverly from a nearby beach. She had been excited to see the ocean and play in the warm sand. She carries a bright yellow bucket full of sea shells and rocks she collected. Steve loads their things onto a table before turning on the water to the outdoor shower.  Beverly goes under the water to rinse all the sand and salt off. Steve helps her rinse her hair.
Peter shuffles over and stops in front of the couch and looks nervously up at him. He lets out a shocked cry as he’s pulled across his father’s lap.
Peter is sleepy, sweet, and excited about gift. Tony holds his hand as they walk into the great room.
“Good morning, Daddy,” she says softly into his neck. He questions if he heard her correctly.
“The doctors want to observe you more before we head home.”
Later that night, the three of them are sitting at the dining table having a very tense conversation. Peter is still in shock and remaining quiet.
He closes his eyes tightly and takes a deep breath. He knew Steve didn’t really think he was a bastard. He knew he didn’t mean the insults he hurled at Tony. It was that hot Irish temper of his. Tony knew how to push all his buttons and seemed to do it without being completely aware. Peter was usually aware of when he was going to lose his temper and he’d try to defuse the situation before he got yelled at or hit. He hears Tony trying to defend himself again. Telling Steve to leave the past in the past.
“Yes, Sir.” Tony’s voice was rough. He loved it. Steve used his nails on Tony’s nipple, dragging downward before soothing it with his warm palm. Tony moaned again, eyes falling shut. He was less afraid this way; “I want it on my—my face.”
“Yeah?” Tony’s voice was hopeful and breathy.
of him. It had been the first time in a long time that someone had gotten that close to Tony.
So how do we feel?
Tony’s eyes openly scanned Steve’s nude, head to toe.
Tony nodded. “Good.”
“In the top drawer there.” Tony jerked his head back towards the dresser by the closet door behind him. The dresser held no clothing, but Tony’s large collection of toys and props. Steve smiled and took the opportunity to run his fingers through Tony’s hair as he stood to fetch the collar.
Tony sighed and circled a worrisome point in the proposal paper. “I don’t want to sell tech that can be weaponized, Pep.” He looked across his cluttered desk to her with tired eyes.
Black Widow responded. “
Dread rose in Tony’s chest, sunk down into his gut with uneasiness and nausea. Steve had
Next chapter will be added eventually, it will be Steve’s POV of the Second Appointment. You can continue to the next part of the series, even if I haven’t posted the 4th chapter here yet
“Are you asking me?”
“You look so beautiful, marked up and filthy like that.” Steve’s voice was a whisper suddenly by Tony’s ear. Tony breathed shakily as Steve pressed kisses to his neck.
Steve was dumbstruck at Tony for just a moment, then happily curled up around Tony’s back. What a little brat, Steve thought fondly. He hooked one leg over Tony’s hip and held him close. “Good?” He asked.
Defeated, Steve debated going back to his floor. He wanted to give Tony space, and to not take advantage of their arrangement. Their arrangement… Well, Tony had paid for company until 9:00am. He could wait until morning.
Tony has never had sex fully naked before and had thought nothing of it until Steve had began unbuttoning Tony’s shirt while they were making out.
Tony coughed and gestured towards the kitchen. “I’ve got a few snacks I hope could catch your stomach’s attention this time around.” He ratted himself out before Steve could tease him later. Steve chuckled.
"S-Steve?"
"Um...How are you?" Steve asked dumbly.
"Tony? Tony.' Steve said, waving his hand in front of my face. I blinked several times, hoping that my tears weren't going to fall. I quickly used my rag to wipe my face, faking that I was wiping my sweat when I was actually wiping the tears.
"Now even that's too much," Clint mumbled under his breath. Natasha nodded and stuffed the ring in her pocket.
"I'm literally asking myself that question right now," Tony sighed, massaging his forehead.
"You're so annoying Stark. I bet Howard is so proud to have you as a son."
Tony stood, somewhat hopeful as he watched the two men smiled lovingly at each other. He was then pulled out of his trance as he flew again, this time ending up in a cold, metal place. He looked outside, snowed covering the place. He turned back around, this time seeing an older version of himself in a scratched up red suit. Steve was standing by a man who had a metal arm.
"Can't you do it tomorrow?" Tony snapped back unintentionally.
"What do you have to say for yourself?!"
"So tell me. I didn't get mad at you when you missed our date. Why should you be mad at me then?"
Tony squeezed his eyes shut, bracing himself for the rejection to follow. I mean, why would someone like Steve want someone like Tony?
I knew that the guilt was consuming him but I didn't want him to be like this. I went behind him and wrapped myself on top of him. I made him let go of the punching bag and he was touching my arms.
"I've seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you."
Steve leant forward, wrapping his arms around Tony's  neck just like when Tony hugged him when they first met. Tony stiffened, arms stuck out, not knowing what to do.
'What happened?' He asked
"Tell me baby, what am I doing wrong?"
"Honey, look at me."
Steve beamed as he caressed Tony's back. He never felt so loved and appreciated and hoped he could continue being the role model that Tony thought he was.
Tony let the bouquet of roses hung in his right arm and turned his back. He started taking some steps away from the plane, planning on throwing the flowers away and forget it ever happened. A light tap touched his shoulder and he only stopped to see who was the person standing behind him.
Sighing, I watched Bucky's unconscious body while I waited for him to wake up.  I thought back to one of the last conversations I had with Tony.
"Really." I replied reassuringly.
"Fuck," Tony angrily spat out, face-palming himself.
"Uh...well hey Cap. This feels a little weird since I just saw you a few minutes ago."
Steve swayed and hugged Tony a little longer than what was deemed acceptable. Tony felt a rumble through Steve's chest and realised that he was chuckling.
"But...yeah," Tony answered awkwardly, "she got mad that I always ditch the date to come help you."
"So was I."
All of a sudden, Steve heard quiet sniffles. He lifted his head to see Tony biting his knuckles and rubbing his eyes. His head were turned away from Steve's.
I squeezed my eyes shut and tears were flowing. I felt Tony's hands tremble under mines and I looked up. He was biting his lip and crying as well. God, his beautiful eyes.
"Mhm, nothing's wrong," Tony mumbled. Silence fell upon them as both men pondered as to what to say next. Steve was worried as Tony had been quiet the entire day except for when they went on a mission earlier.
"T-that's he's your friend. Shit. I'm sorry. I didn't want to -"
Nat strutted into the kitchen where Steve was ferociously concentrating on squirting the icing perfectly onto the vanilla sponge cake. She crossed her arms and coughed a little to catch Steve's attention.
"Good to see you again Mr Stark."
Tony felt a moment of shock from the question. He didn't want Steve to think that! He slowly brought around the bouquet in front of him with shaking hands and looked down at them. He studied the intricate details of the roses instead of facing Steve.
"What the hell is this?! Get this out! And I don't want to see you!"
"Trust me. If teddy bears doesn't work, he has changed. Just try it," Bucky said comfortingly. Tony nodded and thanked for his advice.
Tony's hands were shaking and tears were welling in his eyes. He heard footsteps coming into the doorway and angrily turned his head towards the person. The ring was gripped tightly in Tony's fist.
"Go on a date with me?"
I clenched my teeth and bit my lip. I was having trouble screwing one of the parts into the suit. My hands were trembling and I felt my body shake from hatred and sadness.
"Something's wrong and I need to find out."
"Steve needs my help that's all!"
A few hours later, Steve and Bucky entered the kitchen in a buzzy mood. Their hair was dripping seawater all over the floor and while Bucky was fixing up hot chocolate for them, Steve was ripping the place apart, fear growing in the pit of his stomach.
He sat on his bed, watching as notifications popped up.
"Natasha!"
Natasha signalled the rest of follow her while Steve stayed. Great. now he's just going to say 'don't ever see or talk to me again.'
The woman sighed and bit her lip as she looked at Tony. "Who was that on the phone?"
"What's up?" Clint casually said, placing his hands on his hips.
Eventually, Steve felt super comfortable to the point where he also fell asleep. A few hours later, he woke up and panicked for a few seconds as he couldn't figure out where he was. He then realised that he was in Tony's bed and relaxed back into the bed.
"If you wanted a divorce, you should've just send the papers over."
Back in the lab, Tony opened up instagram to see what Steve had been doing. His first post popped up and Tony almost died of laughing. It was a slightly blurry photo of Steve smiling adorably at the camera while laying in his bed.
"Steve, you're getting too worked-"
"I'm listening now," Steve said softly. Surprised, Tony opened and closed his mouth, seemingly embarrassed.
"Nat please!" Steve pleaded.
"I've been here for the past 2 months. I flew in here the day I heard that you went to hospital." I said bravely. I wanted Tony to know I was there for him the whole time.
"Remember when you were a child and you hugged me after meeting me?"
"Tony...we've missed you!" Bruce cried.
"I love you," Tony whispered, suddenly feeling that maybe everything was going to be okay. At least for now. He felt Steve smile as he basked in the warm silence and for once, his mind was empty.
Tony got snapped out of his thoughts and dragged himself over to where the voice was coming. Steve's smile was bright - brighter than Tony have ever seen before. He wondered if Steve smiled this bright during their wedding.
'_hotredbitch_ started following you.'
voice.
"Do you...by any chance..."
"I know," Steve whispered, tears flowing, "I just never properly said it. And I've been thinking about it these days and I still feel so...so guilty about what happened. You were my boyfriend. I should've protected you."
'In Loving Memory of Tony Stark.'
I packed a light bag and booked the next available flight to New York. Putting my aviators on, I stepped outside the special facility where Bucky was held in and sighed.
"I don't hate you Steve," I said clasping his hands, "Steve...If I hated you, I wouldn't be asking you on a date right?" I smirked.
Tony strained his neck over the crowd but he wanted to leave. He felt like he couldn't face him but after all, the only thing he had to do was to find Steve and ask him on a date.
"I love you 3000," Tony said, leaning up for another kiss.
"Tony?" Steve choked out as he leaned down next to him, "Tony, you're okay. You'll be okay."
"A-are you sure? Wait. This is wrong. I'm supposed to be one who ask you out. Not you."
"I'm sorry too," Tony said, leaning his face into Steve's, "I shouldn't had let my work become the first priority over something that is much more important."
Tony went out and shipped a massive large teddy bear. It was as tall as the ceiling and somehow, he managed to fit it into Steve's bedroom when Steve went out for a run.
I disappeared behind one of my suits to distract me from what happened two months prior.
"I'm not going anywhere Tony," Steve said, trying to reassure him.
"Nat's right Steve. You shouldn't have left it carelessly for Tony to find."
"Stevie always liked teddy bears. Maybe try getting him one?"
"Stark. This is Captain Steve Rogers. Captain. Tony Stark."
"Why did you take off your wedding ring?" Tony said quietly. His voice cracked and it broke Steve's heart.
Shaking his head, he brushed some strands of hair away from Tony's forehead.
"Where were you when I had panic attacks huh?! O-or when I wanted you to sleep with me?! We haven't talked ever since Bucky came. Not once did you try to make it up to me. Did you seriously think that your husband was going to be okay with you hanging with another guy all the time?! I saw you two sleep together as well when you should've been sleeping with me!"
Nat's eyes lighted up and clasped her hands together.
"No shit." Clint said.
"Steve Rogers. Nice to meet you," the blonde-hair man said as he firmly shook. He returned the smile with a sweet gaze. Both men excited for what to come.
"For what?"
"Tony? TONY!" I shouted as I shook his body to wake him up. Grabbing my speaker, I pressed the emergency button and shouted for Bruce to come down to the lab. Within a few seconds, I saw Bruce running towards me and knelt down.
We heard a light knock and I was too busy looking down, letting sadness consume me. I assumed it was the doctor but then I heard a calming, soothing,
Now that Tony had said it, he felt like he could finally understand her point of view. He always did ditch their date to help Steve. But why?
"Why me? Why can't you? O-or Clint! What about Bruce?"
"Thanks Tones! I've been looking forward to this day ever since I've found out he could be alive. What did you want to say?" Steve said, tilting his head slightly. Fuck. He's so cute!
the hospital! You can't do that!" I cried, grabbing my gun to stop him. I pointed at him while glaring.
"About the date you asked..."
"You mean loved right?" Tony said, taking a sip of water.
"What else Nat? I know there's something more."
For once, Tony genuinely smiled back and said,
"I'm sorry Tony! I'm so sorry," Steve cried out, tears streaking down his cheeks. He honestly thought that he was going to lose Tony forever.
But right now, here standing was the great Bucky Barnes who has miraculously survived the impossible - like Steve, and is now being reunited with his long lost best friend. Tony felt a pang of loneliness and emptiness. Would things change now that Bucky is here? Would he lose the love of his life?
"WE'VE FOUND BUCKY!" I heard Steve said excitedly. Tears were pooling within his eyes and as much as I wanted to be happy for him, I couldn't. My heart dropped to the floor and I just stared at him.
"Tony...I'm sorry." Steve choked.
"Steve?"
"Why did you said that?" Tony asked quietly.
"I'll take it."
"Tony," Steve whispered, poking his shoulder slightly. He hated the uncomfortable atmosphere hanging over their heads. Tony said nothing and Steve sighed behind him. He watched as Tony set down his glass and crossed his legs on the couch to get more comfortable.
Natasha stepped forward and picked up the ring delicately in her slender fingers. Clint sighed behind her.
Steve watched as the light fade in Tony's eyes before hugging his body tighter. He kept screaming and screaming before calming down. The real Tony bit his lips, tears threatening from his face. Suddenly his heart dropped as he was sucked back into the room that he started from.
"I-I know it doesn't seem like it but I love you." I said quietly, blushing furiously.
"It's not your fault."
The real Tony Stark got hit with a realisation. He was like a ghost, watching what was going to unfold. He looked at his watch. 3 minutes to go before 10 years past.
I have to admit, I'm kind of excited. But incredibly nervous. How was he going to react? Will he push me away? I wanted to say I'm sorry but I'm scared he's going to go into a heart attack. I mean, he's not
"Tony look at me."
"Look, I bought you this giant teddy bear too. I have to say, I didn't know you still liked teddy bears. But I really hope you like it because clearly the other ones you didn't like."
Steve smiled and after a while he agreed. From there on, Tony took Steve's phone and made an account.
"Stop it Tony," Steve said, chuckling slightly.
"Forget it." Tony started to turn around again but Steve caught hold of his arm.
Tony turned around and glared into Steve's eyes. His eyes were hard and bitter.
Tony pulled away, smiling gently upon the captain. Though no words were exchanged, both men knew the love that was being radiated.
'I LOVE YOU 3000'
"So what do you say hm? Wanna make one?" Tony asked, smiling up at Steve.
Carefully, Steve walked in front of Tony and bent down, looking up into his eyes that bared a lot of pain.
"T-they're not for Bucky. They're for you."
Tony then got swept off his feet again, falling through a matrix. It didn't feel like he was stuck forever as he has soon landed to his next 'destination.' This time, he looked around, amazed. He was standing outside a tower, looking up at a massive 'A' that was overlooking New York City. Tony decided to step inside, whistling at the developments. He decided to take the elevator, glancing at watch again before stepping out into what he thought was the living room. However he frowned at the sight.
"H-hello?" my voice trembled.
Tony relaxed and let out a hearty laugh. He smirked and patted his lap.
Instead I blacked out.
So the very next day, Tony went out to buy some teddy bears. He placed one outside of Steve's bedroom the same night and went to bed, hoping it had worked.
"What do you want your username be?"
Tony stayed quiet, feeling emotional, not from his fear but from the deep love that the Captain had from him. He leaned back into Steve's chest, feeling as kisses were placed upon his head.
"W-where's Tony?"
"No Steve! Why did you take off the ring? Do you not love Tony anymore? He's been so broken in the last few weeks!"
Steve sighed and stood up. Tony thought he was going to leave but then felt all the heat from under the blanket quickly disappeared as he realised that the blanket was being lifted up. Tony felt the bed dipped downwards and another source of heat that was emitting next to him.
"I went swimming with Bucky in the ocean. I didn't want to lose it!" Steve explained desperately.
She handed him the card and left the room to Steve. Steve waved his hand over the card in hope it would start. It does. He watched as an upside-down triangle form with a Tony Stark sitting in a chair. Steve felt his breath gets taken away as Tony came to life.
"Fine."
"Is it because of me?" Steve questioned innocently. This made Tony's eyes shot up, blown-up at the sudden question. He didn't know whether to tell the truth or not.
"Back before the serum, Bucky used to come back from the army and visit me. He would tell me of men spooning each other in order to survive the harsh winter because the body heat would be shared between the two."
"I'm sorry Tony."
"That's perfect! You can go spoon Tony then!"
But more often than not, people also say the best partners are those who are like you.
The next morning, Tony found the teddy bear stabbed on his bedroom door. Horrified, he quickly took it down and went to grab another bear to place outside his door. A couple days went by with the same routine until Tony eventually decided to become extreme.
"Stop calling me that!"
"Tony you don't--"
There was a small shake of the boys head and Tony let out another sigh before he passed the plate over without hesitation.
(See the end of the chapter for
He had enough time to look down at his phone before a loud bang launched the car in the air. Tony was jostled as the car flipped twice and he found himself upside down when it finally stopped. His head was spinning and there was a ringing in his ears, making everything muffled. There was screaming? He was vaguely aware of the muffled groan coming from the driver which meant the man was alive, thankfully. That also meant he had to get the hell away from the car if he wanted his driver to remain alive.
"You have to believe me Buck. I know who you are. I don't want to fight you."
"What? Where?"
They waited until the lights went out a few hours later. He waited for the first passing of the guards before stirring Loki into action.
Still nothing and Steve sighed, moving into an empty chair next to the bed, easing himself down slowly. Crossing his arms, he chose this time to think.
There was another look shared between the spies before they tentatively nodded. The others let out a collective sigh of relief seeing that Natasha and Clint were in and Steve felt better knowing that another part of his plan was in motion. If the five of them worked together (6 once they eventually figured out where Thor was.) they could stop Hydra and still save SHIELD in the process.
The entire drive back from New Jersey to DC, Nat had to drive. Steve couldn't focus or he would start driving too fast and too reckless to get back as soon as he can. Nat switched him and he sat in the passengers seat tapping his foot and checking his phone. Tony wasn't answering his phone and he hadn't heard anything from Sam since he asked the man to go look for him so he had no idea what was going on or if Tony was even okay.
WELL those who guessed Loki were correct! A little too early to introduce Peter and honestly hadn't even thought of Harley. Nope nope. It's a tiny Loki. Another child for Tony to dote on of course, if he stays this way. I'd had this planned since the first part though so finally being able to put it to paper (so to speak) is great.
"If this goes all the way to the top--"
"Are these our presents Stark?" She asked, fixing them both with a calming smile. Tony grinned back just as easily to Steve's amazement.
"Guys. Who the hell is this?" Clint asked and they both turned to Steve.
"That's not for me to say but there's a big blond with a heart of gold that wouldn't forgive me if I left you down here. Don't care if you believe it or not, he does so shut up."
"C'mon Barnes." He muttered, scrambling over to the other man. He grabbed the shield and hooked it onto Bucky's arm before grabbing him under the arms and hauling him up as best as he could. He thought he should feel worried when Bucky let out a pained groan but his sole focus was getting Barnes dragged to the elevator.
"T-Tony?"
"JARVIS?"
"What about Bucky?"
Slowly, tentatively, the boy nodded, tousled hair bouncing with the movement. He watched Tony warily before he scooted a little closer. Tony in turn, carefully moved his hands to the device. He remembered Thor showing it to him before after he slapped it on his brothers face. Turning it on and off with a laugh because he knew it would annoy Loki. At the time Tony thought it was funny but he was glad the Asguardian had showed him. How did Hydra get a piece of Asguardian tech in the first place?
He wheezed, trying to choke out some sort of come back before his world went black.
They locked him in a room.
"Where?"
"We're on our way down. They have Tony with the helicarriers."
"What're you doing? Those are Hydra--"
"Yeah...But at what cost?"
It was days after they'd returned to New York. The team got settled and Steve let Bucky pick a room of his own. He was certain that Tony wouldn't have minded, as it had been the same thing he'd done for all of them. The following day, Nat and the other two left to hit the bases and were nearly done the list. Bruce stayed behind, on call in case they came across trouble while Steve paced.
"We're going to start hitting Hydra bases after we get settled in the tower, starting with any here in the states. We don't think they'd risk taking him out of the country yet, not with everything out in the open and every one on edge. Once you get agents cleared, we'll be happy to have any back up you might want to provide."
"My Roomba."
"I am not a recording. I may not be the man I was when the captain took me prisoner in 1945 but I am." The image to the side flickered to life and Steve stared in disgust at the little weasel shown there.
He almost laughed. His fingers reached out to touch it gently, afraid it would slip out of his grasp. He hadn't deserved it back then and even now, to this day, he didn't deserve it. They were barely on speaking terms and yet Tony's first priority had been to upgrade him. Not just him but the others too. Nat, Clint, Thor, Bruce. All of them.
"Impossible." Clint breathed out. "SHIELD would have stopped you. Starks dad wouldn't have let this happen."
"Alright." He frowned but let him get to work. "Come get one of us if you need us."
The guest room was empty.
"Yeah. Yeah of course she is Steve. JARVIS. Confirm the year and call Romanoff. Set phone to speaker."
"What are you guys up to?" The scientist leaned around Steve's bulkier body to look at the mess they'd made, his curiosity piqued if Steve was to guess. "Tony said that you two were, and I quote,
"You're Loki, right?" It wasn't hard to piece together. The mouth guard was the biggest give away, he'd seen it on Loki the day he escaped with the tesseract from the tower. Given his looks, it was easy to put this child to the older Asguardian. How he ended up like that and where the tesseract was, was another thing altogether. The kid looked at him in surprise but didn't give him an answer.
" Natasha's voice came through the speaker of the phone and Clint hummed in agreement.
"I've heard about the smart mouth of the great Tony Stark. A mouth almost as smart as that brain of yours. A brain that is right now, the only thing keeping you alive. "
This chapter is in Loki's view!
"I thought--"
Now Tony looked nervous and that wasn't right. He was the nervous one. What could Tony possibly tell him about Bucky that he needed to be nervous over?
Steve let out a breath and Tony just patted his leg in return. He could wait a little longer to find Bucky once more. He was sure that they'd call in their asset sooner or later. When Tony started to pack up his laptop, Steve sat up.
"Yeah. Let's go."
The joys of being extremely underestimated.
"What Tony decides to do--"
Tony's gaze flicked to him with an eyebrow raised, looking at him curiously. Right. With everything that had happened, he forgot about his nightmare and about how nice it was to sleep next to Tony and their kiss. As much as he wanted to change the topic and talk about that, he shook his head. This time he wasn't going to take the cowards way out. He wasn't going to avoid telling Tony the truth to protect Bucky or himself. Or to spare Tony's feelings. Which was the lie he told himself the first time, when he didn't tell Tony the truth. His mistake was never trusting Tony with the truth, worried he would react the way he did in Siberia and he wouldn't repeat that mistake.
More files were pulled up. A lot of the information was redacted and blacked out but Steve hyper focused on the words he could see. In particular 'Asset'.
But his mother always called him cunning.
He stumbled after a little while, starting to feel tired, but he had to keep going. There was nothing but an expanse of snow but off in the distance, he could see trees. Trees would give him cover if they started to look for him.
When Natasha, Clint and Sam returned to the tower they brought dinner and the group of them sat around the living eating while the three of them went over the hideouts they checked out. There hadn't been anything left behind in any of them. No technology. No paperwork. Nothing. They were spotless, though some of the cleared SHIELD agents were going to go through and do a second check. It was disheartening to say the least knowing that they were able to get out of the States with Tony in tow and no one even saw them.
"What?"
"I can." Steve and the others turned to look at Clint who joined them, standing in the doorway. "Barnes is sleeping. He'll be ready to go in the morning like we planned. As for Thor, I was there, when he first came to Earth."
Wait.
"Alright. We're going in blind without much information. We'll hit hard, we'll hit fast. We know Tony's still inside so our mission is to get him out. Once we find him, we extract and we leave. We can take care of the ones in charge after we know he's alright."
"What--"
"Wha-- Steve?"
"I never said without anyone noticing. I just said I needed you to get me in. Say you're giving me a tour. "
"I--" He looked down at the laptop where the information was waiting, preparing himself. "I have to get this done."
"Sounds like it. Keep in touch."
"Won't be a problem."
"We'll work on a plan. I just need to talk to Tony about something."
"Hey since we're here and all and we don't want to have to travel all the way back to the hotel SHIELD put us in--"
Why did it look familiar?
"Let's go stop Hydra."
"Right okay. Long story."
"Indeed we do Captain and I must confess, I have been distracting you for quite some time now so our plans can proceed." And like that, Zola's image disappeared, leaving them staring at a blank screen with a bad taste in their mouths.
Simple right?
"Anyway, I just wanted to say...If you're watching this now, I'm probably dead."
"No-one. It was just Steve. I wasn't -"
"U-uh. Steve wow. I can't believe this! I um...I've liked you too."
"oh hey! I was just about to say -" I started.
Putting my chin on his shoulder so our faces were touching I said,
Steve knew that Tony was talking about when he visited him with Ant-Man about their time-travel plan.
I hugged him tighter and without letting go, I whispered,
"Don't worry about it," Tony said, cutting her off. He mentioned he wanted to sleep and gave her the same tight smile that he gave to Bucky. Natasha knew he wasn't okay but decided it was best to leave him be. She bid her 'goodnight' and left Tony to the empty room. Tony slipped himself underneath the cool covers and fell into a dreamless sleep.
WARNING: Timeline not accordingly
"I'm sorry Tony, I thought it wasn't as -"
"Tony!"
Tony tilted his head as he watched the two men perched on the edge of the balcony. It was a quiet night with nightlight all over the city.
Finally. No more missions. I know Steve was busy trying to find Bucky ever since there was notice that he might be alive but maybe if I ask, he'll make time for me?
Steve finally realised the extent of hurt that he had caused to Tony. He wondered how many nights that Tony had woken up from panic attacks and he wasn't there to soothe him. He wondered when was the last time they kissed, or hugged or even had a proper conversation. He wondered if Tony even genuinely smiled at least once in last few weeks. Steve understood that Tony knew it was important for Steve to hang out with Bucky however Steve should've known that Tony would've felt hurt about this.
"Tony I love you. You know that right? Please, don't go."
"Yeah I know man," Bucky responded. Tony watched as his pushed back his hair before answering.
Steve froze, suddenly the warm water becoming icy cold.
"I do not sound like that," Steve said, clutching his stomach. Tony flipped his hair and made his way closer to Steve, standing in front of him.
He flew onto the landing pad and basically ran straight into his room yelling Steve's name.
"You're jealous," Natasha stated bluntly.
"Sorry Tony. I was over-reacting," Steve mumbled in the crook of Tony's neck.
"He's my friend."
Tony leaned against the bar, swirling the glass of whiskey in his hand. He cautiously took a sip while eyeing the man with a metal arm who was currently bear-hugging the love of his life.
'Finally got Instagram! A fan said I should post something so here it is. I'm currently sitting on my bed. Thanks to my boyfriend, Tony, for setting this up! Love you <3"
Steve squinted his eyes, still waiting for Tony's question.
"I...love you," Tony breathed out. Steve sobbed harder, pulling Tony into his body.
Tony cocked his head in frustration as he looked at Steve. His eyes bored into his, both men fighting for the dominance.
"Who are those flowers for?"
"You were family."
"Tony? Tony," Steve whispered, "how are you feeling?"
"I know why Howard liked you," Tony said simply. His voice was eerily calm.
My train of thought was broken when I heard something interesting on the news.
"Just go to sleep. I'll keep you warm."
'I LOVE YOU 3000'
Tony closed his eyes as he two men started to go at each other. When Tony's blast hit the Captain's shield, Tony fell through a hole, somehow ending back in Tony's room. He saw that Steve was cuddling Tony on their shared bed. He smiled at the sight, warmth filling his core.
Tony felt a weird feeling develop in his stomach. Instead of being pulled forward, he now felt like he was falling. Suddenly, he landed on his feet. Breathing heavily, he looked around and saw himself turning around to look at him. He waved but the other Tony didn't respond. All of a sudden, an elevator dinged and out stepped Fury and a tall blonde man standing next to him.
"How long was I out for?"
"Sorry babe, gotta go!" Tony said as he reached into his blazer pocket."I'll make it up next time. Promise."
Steve pulled back and looked down at Tony's face. Tony, completely captured by the slight tilt and smile gestured by the captain, felt his anger dissolve. He rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly, trying to rack something to say.
NOTE: Not set/following any specific timeline.
"Time and time again you keep ignoring my orders!"
"Those flowers are nice," Tony said bitterly, "Bucky will like them."
"You're not happy to see me?"
At some point throughout the night, Tony woke up in cold sweat and felt like he couldn't breathe. After a few minutes, he finally calmed down but didn't want to fall asleep in fear that he would wake up again in the same state. Groggily he walked out of his room and noticed the light to Bucky's room was still on. Tony scoffed and turned around to take the elevator down to the kitchen.
"So was I."
"No. I love you. Before and after Bucky. I still do." I said, clasping my hands around his.
He looked down onto the tiled floor and pondered on who he could replace Tony with, until he felt an intense stare from someone in front of him. He glanced up through his eyelashes and stretched back out.
Steve stared hopelessly at the white wall in front of him, hoping that Tony would just appeared out of nowhere asking for shawarma. He looked down at the floor, remembering the damaged Tony Stark laying on the cold floor of the Siberian Hydra facility. He remembered the look on Tony's face as he realised that Steve Rogers was actually going to kill him until the last second when Steve snapped out of his intense rage.
"I love you too."
He gave me a smile. The one that I fell in love with.
"I saw how you looked before," she started. Tony sighed and leaned against the door frame with his arms crossed. He cocked an eyebrow, waiting for her to continue.
"Tony found it," Natasha said, crossing her arms. She refused to give the ring back until she got answers.
Steve, feeling a bit anxious, decided to take a photo. He opened up his camera and smiled sloppily.
"We almost lost you...Don't scare us like that again." Clint said sadly.
Steve huffed and thought optimistically. Maybe if he shares his body heat with Tony then Tony would get better and then he wouldn't need to face the problem of replacing anyone.
But of course, in reality it was one of the hardest thing to do.
Steve glanced sideways before reluctantly agreeing. He followed Nat to Tony's room and stood outside his doorway. Nat pushed him inside and closed the door. Steve looked at the door behind him hopelessly and then onto the sleeping Tony.
"W-why do you say that?"
"Awwh, that wasn't hard to say was it?"
"Oh I'm sorry Tony. I can explain to the lady that it's all my fault. I should stop relying-"
"You."
Steve looked at me with a shocked expression and cried even harder. I was taken aback. I thought he would've liked it.
"Get out," Steve said, crossing his arms.
Tony and Steve argue probably more than any average couple due to their clashing personalities. But they probably love each other harder than any average couple. They care about one another and are always there for each other no matter what. But Tony can't help but wonder if Steve would've chose Bucky over him if Bucky was standing here a few years earlier.
"I took it off because I went swimming! I didn't want to lose it in the ocean! And what do you mean I don't love Tony anymore? I love him with all my heart," Steve answered sadly.
Steve's shoulders softened at the name of Tony's father. He shifted his weight, crossing his arms tighter.
Steve laughed out loud before standing up and reaching his arm out. Tony looked at his hand before grabbing it to pull himself up. Neither one of them let go and they both stood there, with Steve looking at Tony while Tony looked at the two hands clasped together.
"I'm sorry Tony," Steve said, pulling back, "I remembered you saying I was so cool and that you loved me. I've always wanted to be the hero that you thought I was."
Glancing down, the pair's positioned had changed as they slept. Tony was now facing him, hiding his face in Steve's chest as his arm laid heavily over the captain's ribcage. Steve's leg was draped across Tony's, his foot landing in between the shorter man's ankle. Steve smiled fondly as he lightly ran through his fingers through Tony's hair and realised that he had slept the best in a very long time. Closing his eyes, he resumed back into a dreamless, warm sleep, holding Tony close to his body.
"You're wrong," Tony whispered in his ear, "You've always been the hero that I love. No matter how much we fight, you're still my favourite after all this time. I'm sorry that I compared you to my dad."
"It's one time!"
Tony bit his lip, not knowing what to say anymore. Steve huffed and turned on his heels to enter the elevator.
I watched as Steve turned around and walked out the large glass panel. Sighing, I felt my heart clenched and I knew that the next year is going to be hell for me.
"No Tony!" Steve yelled, turning around to face him in the living room, "I can't believe you missed our date!"
"Just making myself a cup of coffee," Tony said simply. He continued to stirred, not wanting to look at Steve's face. He knew that Steve would've catch onto the fact that Tony had suffered a panic attack in his sleep and would feel bad about it. Of course, Tony didn't want to ruin Steve's moment with Bucky.
"You're the one who emits the most heat Steve!"
"Steve Rogers. Nice to meet you," the blonde-hair man said. He smiled gently and shook hands firmly with the inventor.
"O-oh okay... I hope we're good," Tony continued, patting Steve awkwardly on the back.
"Jarvis! Tell Steve to come up to my room. Now!"
"And to be honest. Tony has every right to feel hurt and...possibly jealous. You have been hanging out with me a lot. Even sleeping in the same bed in the last couple of weeks."
"Tony Stark," the inventor said, sticking out his hand.
"Of course I'll go on a date with you."
"Of course I remember. It's one of my favourite memories."
"Hm? O-oh...well, it didn't work out," Tony whispered, eyes boring into the ground.
Tony emerged from his lab one lunch-time and was fixing himself a sandwich until he noticed a golden band sitting lonely on the dining table. Curious, he picked up the band and rolled it around in his fingers until he closely looked at the inscription.
Tony stayed quiet, rocking his body slightly. Steve bent down and look at him in the eyes.
"He went to the beach with Bucky. What's going on?"
The real Tony watched as Steve hung his head, tears dripping down onto the ground. He saw a gauntlet on Tony's hand  and then looked to stare at himself.
"Umm...well...Bucky woke up... And h-he's been adjusting well to the new world." I mentally slapped myself. The reason we're here in the first place is because of Bucky and I just mentioned his name within the first five minutes of him waking up.
I looked up, wide eyed and stared at him with my mouth slightly opened.
"This teddy bear took me ages to fit into this room too. I had to cut off it's head for it to fit through the door and like I'm really sorry Steve. Really. Please forgive me. I just love you too much to let you go. I'm such a mess right now. Like look at this teddy bear. The messy stitches at the top? That was mine. I don't even know how to sew for god sake!"
There he was, now tapping his right foot onto the tarmac while cradling the bouquet of roses in his arms. He felt his hair fluttered behind him as the plane touched down and skidded towards a stop. His heart thumped loudly in his chest and sweat was forming on his hairline. He brushed his hair back, tightened his tie and straightened his back as the back of the plane opened up and a crowd of soldiers came stomping down. They cheered and all look frantically for their loved ones.
"I don't want to hear it! Why can't you ever just listen? Clint could've been killed!"
Jarvis' sudden voice broke the silence and knocked Tony out of his thought process.
"Do you...like me?"
"Hey Capsicle... What's going on?" I said, sitting down with him.
Steve's heart clenched at the guilt for all the times he had known Tony but yet never gathered the courage to tell him what actually happened with his parents. Tony didn't trust a guy who didn't have a 'dark side,' however Tony wished he had never had found out because the one guy he actually trusted the most turned out to be the one who would betray him in the end.
Steve nodded and ran off to quickly book a flight ticket and to fill his leather duffel bag with necessities. Within an hour, he was checked-in and due to board any minute now. As he sat down in his seat, he rolled his ring around his finger and then slid it off to look at the inscription that he had seen for the millionth time.
"Hi," Tony said whilst nodding. He gave a tight smile, one that doesn't reach his eyes. However, the Captain was too enthralled by the person in front of him to notice that Tony was feeling anything but happy. Tony slipped himself out of the conversation, leaving Bucky and Steve alone together. He strutted back to his bedroom and was in the middle of taking his shirt off when a knock came through.
"Doesn't that sound too...arrogant and cocky?" Steve asked, worried about what his 'followers' would say.
Tony smiled, excited for his future to start.
"Please Tony! I love you...I know I hurt you in the last few weeks but I didn't realise it then. I know now though! Trust me, I never took off the ring with the intention to hurt you. I did it only because I didn't want to lose it. It's too important to be lost..."
I gripped the edge of my desk and thought intensely. Okay. Today's the day. After many years, I'm finally going to ask him out. I'm just going to be confident and cool and -
"I can't do this! I can't! I can't!" Steve sobbed into the palm of his hands. The paper crinkled as his hands fisted together. Still crying, he opened back up the crinkled paper and read the top of the page.
It's been a whole year and so many things had happened. Bucky was with Natasha and Tony was back to his cheeky, sarcastic self. Steve move back with the Avengers and eventually they've all forgave each other. Some days though... the guilt consumes Steve even though he knows they're all best friends now.
"What did I say? Get out! I don't want to see your face."
"W-well the thing is," Tony started while fiddling with his hands, "I was wondering..."
"Am not."
"Sorry doesn't cut it, Steve."
"He turned his tracker off but the last known place was Miami."
"Tony..." Steve breathed out.
Tony sat and slept in the living room for a day, waiting for Steve to come down to the living room. He never did. Eventually, he grew tired of waiting and decided to call Bucky Barnes, Steve's closest friend.
"I need you to find Tony. Now!"
"W-well...there was a nearby building...a-and it was about to fall on top of a crowd so I just...helped them" Tony said awkwardly. He looked out in the corner of his eyes, not wanting to look into Steve's soft blue eyes.
old but with all the stuff he's been through. Definitely aged him up.
Steve walked over and placed himself on top of Tony's lap, watching as Tony grabbed his phone and opened up an app.
Steve blinked at how fast Tony spoke towards the end of the sentence and couldn't quite catch what he was saying.
Steve watched as Tony eyes slowly open, a hint of sadness staring out. His chest rose heavily and sighed out.
Steve smiled at Tony's rambling and stride up to hug him tight.
"Can I come in?" Steve said gently as he looked upon Tony. Tony nodded, pushing himself away from the end of the bathtub to let Steve step in from behind. As Steve slipped himself to sit behind Tony, his arms wrapped around the shorter man's stomach protectively and pulled him closer. Tony sighed, closing his eyes and leaning back against Steve's chest.
"Stevie..." Tony heard the scruffy-hair man say. He watched as the Captain's eyes watered and returned the hug with the same intensity that the metal man had given. Tony knew all about the metal man. His name was Bucky and Tony knew he was someone of upmost importance in Steve's life. Sometimes, Steve would tell Tony stories of Bucky and him when he felt sad. Sometimes, Steve would cry in his sleep and mumble Bucky's name. Sometimes, Steve would get panic attacks and scream for Bucky to help him.
"Why do you think there's something's wrong with me? There's nothing wrong!" Tony raised his voice slightly. Steve, blessed with patient soul, nuzzled his face down in the crook of Tony's neck. He felt as Tony shook his head slightly.
"Okay, look. I'm sorry alright! I just-" Tony took a deep breath in, "I just didn't realise the time and I somehow ended up getting really caught up in my work. I'm...just really sorry Steve. Please."
"Because!" Steve shouted in frustration, "I was at a funeral! It's different!"
"What is it? Just spit it out."
Steve stood, shocked at what Tony had just said.
Tony lifted up his head as he watched Steve barged into his room with a furious look on his face.
Tony stopped and sighed out loud.
"Oh for FUCK SAKE!!"
"O-oh my god. I was looking for that! Thanks Nat, Tony would kill -"
"Have you tried going to his room?"
"Tony -"
I felt my mouth twist into a smile but my eyes weren't.
Steve turned his head at Pepper, shocked by her words.
"What the fuck Tony!" I heard someone shout. I whipped towards the noise and saw Nat crossing her arms as she glared at me.
"Tony! No! Change it right now!"
Steve gulped down his emotions and anxiously waited until the plane landed in Miami.
"What do you mean 'done.' We're not 'done,'" Tony said, shaking his head. The woman scoffed and turned on her heels. She quickly exited the door while Tony followed closely by until he grabbed her arm.
So Tony decided he would ask Steve out to a date once he got back.
"Mr Rogers! You should post a photo."
"You missed our date before," he said simply.
I threw the screwdriver across the room with such force that it stabbed itself into one of my suits. Great. Now I have to fix THAT one.
Both Tony and Steve were trying to hold onto hope that one of them would start a serious conversation. They both miss each other and only wanted to shower each other with love. They must come back to each other before they permanently lose it.
"What's wrong darling?" Steve said, kissing Tony's neck.
"Steve? We need to go now, it's time for your speech."
"No!" Tony yelled, "No. It's fine. You know you can always rely on me."
"Oh-Oh my gosh. I'm so so sorry Nat! Seriously I didn't m-mean it." I choked out the last part as I felt my legs go weak and crumpled to the floor. I covered my face with my hands and started crying my eyes out that I've been holding in for the past 2 months.
Steve frowned and placed his piping bag onto the bench. He leaned back against the counter, supporting himself with his arms.
"No, no! I'm happy to see you. Extremely happy actually! Uhm..."
"Don't lie to yourself Tony. I know you."
"Tony? Tony tell me what's going on inside that head of yours," Steve coaxed, pushing his face forward so he could see Tony better. Tony continue to look sideway, not wanting to look into Steve's blue eyes.
"Tony mentioned that he's cold as well."
"Looking for this?"
"U-um...I don't know how to tell you this..."
'_wintersoldierbarnes_ started following you.'
Tony slowly glanced up at him through his eyelashes. He felt his heart beat fast from the fact that it was only him and Steve standing in a quiet room. He watched as Steve leaned down to kiss him but for a second, Tony panicked and pushed passed Steve, leaving him in shock. Steve watched as Tony scurried off with his coffee and entered into the elevator. He contemplated in following Tony back to his room but decided against it. He sighed and brushed his hair back with his hand, walking himself back to Bucky's room.
"Stevie come on!" Tony coaxed as he followed after Steve.
Tony stayed quiet, pondering at the memory. He suddenly felt like a child and his heart started to race out of love and excitement.
"What's Instagram?" Steve innocently asked.
'I-I don't know. He was crying really hard and then he just blacked out,' I explained.
"Wait what. No! Tony
Tony stood in silence, still facing away from Steve. Tony death-gripped the edge of the marble counter until he spoke up again.
"You're only saying that to make me feel b-better!" Steve shouted into the punching bag and hugging it so tight that it broke. All the contents came spilling out.
Steve choked a laugh out as he watched tears fall hard onto the crinkled paper he was holding. However, very quickly Steve fell into a deeper pit of despair as he remember the painful memories between him and the man who had literally saved the world.
Steve looked at the door through his tear-stricken eyes and stared at Pepper. She softened his eyes at him and sat next to him as Steve continued to cry.
Tony tensed up, not knowing what was going on.
Tony dropped into a ball onto the ground and laid his head on top of his knees. Steve glanced upwards and chuckled before looking down and smiling sweetly.
"I love you! You're so cool. Dad always talks about you. I want to be like you when I grow up! I want to save the world!"
"I was wondering if y-you...wouldwanttogoonadatewithme?"
Steve sighed and ruffled his hair. He wished that Tony still looked at him like he did when he was a kid. Even though he knew Tony was no longer a child, he felt the responsibility to look after him and he really did love him without Tony knowing.
“Another nightmare?” Steve asks.
He whines and leans back into Tony but nods his head.
A smile cracks across Peter’s face. “The little mermaid?”
Steve starts to return the papers to the folders, having enough of revisiting that incident.
“Really you’re going to sleep in a bed someone else sweated in? Probably had sex in. You going to lay down in Ben’s dried jizz?”
I've created a tumblr, please follow me:
“What the hell did you feed my kid?”
“No! I’m not lying,” Peter starts to shout.
“Tony,” Steve says sternly.
“You know what I think? Your mom would want you to open your gifts and enjoy today.”
There was a steep decline down to the water that has risen a couple feet with all the recent rain.  He makes it a few steps  down the muddy incline before his foot slips straight out from under him, slicing the back of his leg on a protruding tree root. Tumbling down until his body hits water, his head hits rock, and his vision goes black.
“That woman was in my room again.”
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry,” she says softly as she wipes futility at her wet cheeks.
“Poor guy? He hit me in the face with his book.”
“Then stop lying! We never kept this stuff from Pete and Bev.”
Steve rubs his face and sighs. “I can turn them into trees maybe. It’s black paint, that’s hard to blend into something else.”
Steve sits on the floor tentatively by them, careful not to get too close and spook Peter again. Peter pulls back from Tony and glances over at Steve. “It’s really Papa and not the creature?”
“I don’t know!”
“It’s bad.”
Steve pats his shoulder even though he wants nothing more than to pull Tony into a hug. Even if it was some weird illusion, he wanted to at least have that. Some comfort to make this day bearable.
“Pops thinks you’re stupid,” he mouths but his sister doesn’t catch it.
“She’s a husky.”
He startles as the woman presses a kiss against his lips.
*****
Tony worries if his next question will only scare the child. “Are you sure it was him?”
“I had the whole ride to think about this. I love you but you’re an idiot, Steve I get that. You have a big heart and you think with it.”
“Again. I only pretend to,” she says glancing up at him before turning on the television. A foreign language fills the air but Natasha seems to understand it. Steve watches for a minute before tuning it out. His thoughts going back to his children. Beverly was more than safe in Tony’s care. No harm would come to her. Peter, his little worrywort, would be just fine.
“You pissed your Papa off?”
“It’s nothing. I’m fine,” Tony says holding his head.
“No, no Peter is back in New York with his aunt and uncle.”
“No you’re not her.”
“She keeps tugging at her ears. Kids do that when their ears hurt. She might have an ear infection.”
“Papa when will it be Christmas?”
“Well where is she? At school?”
“Getting up yet?” he asks.
Tony and Steve are standing in similar stances with their arms crossed over their chests.
“Nevermind. Don’t you have to be at work?”
Steve glances up, tears welling in his eyes. It had been a long night and emotions are swirling through his head. Tony wasn’t an easy man to be married to but he couldn’t help who he loved. They had fallen for each other hard and the relationship progressed quickly. Marriage and moving in together. Soon they were adopting Peter and becoming parents. It was harder and harder to imagine a life without him. Everything was so intertwined together. Tony’s playboy past was hard for him to accept. He trusted that his husband was faithful to him.
It had been years since Uncle Ben’s murder. A robbery gone wrong. They worried about Aunt May and who she had to spend her holidays with.
I’m sad to see this come to a close but all things have an end. Thanks to everyone that stuck around and read this to the end. I hope y’all enjoy it.
The phone unlocks, he opens up the recent calls and scrolls through. He finds Pepper not that far down. It was late, he shouldn’t call but he presses her name and puts the phone against his ear. It rings almost to the point of voicemail picking up when there is a click. Silence before a little girl says hello.
“Do I really have to sleep?” Peter says as he begrudgingly folds his clothes.
“Peter, open your mouth for me.”
“How long have you known?”
“No, this is my place.”
Steve walks over to Peter, and looks disappointedly between the apparent tea party and his son. “What are you doing in the basement? These aren’t our things. You shouldn’t be in them.”
Thanks for reading. It was a hard to write with everyone being in conflict with each other. The weather has become really warm here so that's helping for the summer setting. We even had a thunderstorm last night which is really unusual for December.
“He’s angry.”
The atmosphere becomes tense as Steve realizes he’s alone with Tony. The conversation from that morning running through his head over and over. They needed to talk to each other. Actually listen and talk everything out. It was something neither of them were good at. It wasn’t going to work if it led to another fight. He gets off the couch and stands by Tony’s chair.
Steve paced around the living-room of their Condo in DC. He had come down there a few days ago telling Tony he had business at the SHIELD headquarters. It was a property Tony bought not long after they got married. When it became apparent that Steve still needed to spend a week or two a month in town working at headquarters. Tony was less than impressed with the apartments they toured. After a small argument that Steve easily lost, Tony was on the phone with a real estate agent and setting up an appointment to tour luxury condos.
Peter whines and rests his head in Tony’s neck. Tony throws the jello back onto the tray and wraps both his arms around his son.
Beverly gets in his face when he’s eating and acts like she is a begging dog.
“What? It’s true. So is mine. You can’t see them, stupid.”
*****
The words sting even though Steve knows he doesn’t mean them. It’s just a kid upset he’s not getting his way and lashing out. He pinches the bridge of his nose in frustration and takes a deep breath. “We do not throw things. Get over here and pick up your shoe.”
“Papa, turn on the waterfall.” Peter runs to the far end of the shower and presses his hand against the tile. “And this one too.”
"He doesn't have any memories of being an adult--"
"Do you know Tony? Hello? Are you Steve?"
"Get in loser, we're getting food."
Fury narrowed an eye and his gaze flicked between the two of them suspiciously. Tony met the gaze with unwavering confidence and a grin he knew was probably maddeningly annoying. There was a long silence, just Fury and Tony staring at each other before the Director of SHIELD finally clicked his tongue off the roof of his mouth.
"Apparently"
Huh. Steve hadn't thought about it that way. He and Tony did have that in common, didn't they? It put things into perspective, back during the Accords. Would Tony have done the same thing he did if it were Rhodes put in Bucky's position? And seeing Bucky fall like Rhodey had, would he have been as kind as Tony to come and help in Siberia? He would have been devastated, angry and betrayed. In all honesty, Tony might have been a better man than he was.
"Give it to me J. You have something on Barnes."
"He's fine man, just tinkering with somethin'. Got a bit scuffed up but he's in one piece. I was about to go get him cause I made some dinner."
"No, I'm sorry Steve." Tony's hand moved, leaving his arm to run through his hair and Steve missed the warmth. "JARVIS is running through everything we can find, searching for keywords but it's not turning anything up."
"No. M'not Tony."
So Bucky could remember the incident on the street which meant they hadn't wiped his mind in the time between then and now. It was reassuring to know.
"You're Steve right?" He asked, ignoring the others. "The man with the shield that stopped the hydra?"
"Yeah. Okay. Fine. You're right."
Steve mimicked Tony, sucking in a breath at the sight.
As if on cue, Steve's phone came to life and Jarvis' voice broke through.
He tried not to grip the phone too hard as the phone rang and when it connected, he sucked in a sharp breath.
"Without much process either. Looks like they were hired all on the spot. Seems pretty fishy to me. Why would SHIELD hire people from an organisation tied to human experimentation and kidnapping the President without running them through some sort of screening?"
"From the looks of it, it is. There are a lot of things that aren't adding up."
"Aye--"
So he dressed, packed a bag and caught a ride to SHIELD headquarters. He was supposed to start missions with the strike team and Natasha that week but he was going to tell Fury to give him more time. His reasoning was sound even though he knew it would raise a few eyebrows. Wanting to check on the well being of his teammate should be a good enough reason to let him off for some extra time.
He thought back at what had been included on Tony’s list. Biting, dominance, rope bondage, humiliation… Steve had spent more than a few hours looking at every piece of information V.P. Escorts had provided him with from their Activities database, as well as online from niche websites.The rope usage had definitely been something Steve was interested in and he wanted to do it correctly.
Steve felt heat stir in his gut at the sight of Tony leaning his stinging cheek into his hand, against the tug of Steve’s fingers in his hair. He could do whatever he wanted to this man and that potential was intoxicating. “On your feet,” Steve ordered and withdrew both his hands.
“So…?” Tony repeated.
Steve had bathed him. The man’s hands had been so gentle and delicate, something Tony would not have expected from a man of Steve’s size. He had been so good to Tony. He had dealt with Tony’s crying snit, too. So embarrassing.
“If you don’t know what it is, don’t do it.”
“That’s it, that’s what you want.” Steve whispered, half coo and half taunt, and decided he did not want to wait one more minute to be inside Tony.
He was not seeing anyone. Not anymore. Well, not ever. He and Steve weren’t anything. Tony somehow found a way to derail the one thing that was keeping him grounded. Two things, he supposed, as he rubbed one thumb against his thigh where the slightest bruise was blooming.
“I’m fine.” Tony snapped, his hands clenching into fists on his lap. He took a deep breath before providing a calmer response. “It doesn’t affect my breathing,” He lied. “Just, it—it keeps me alive, more or less. Let’s not talk about it, I’d much rather be sucking your monster cock.”
Tony was guided to sit on the edge of the large bathtub and he did so without complaint, although the porcelain was cold. Steve set about running the bath faucet, plugging the drain and looking through the abundance of bath products before finding a small bottle of bubble bath behind the various body washes. Steve found fresh towels in the second cupboard he tried. Tony had watched, had meant to point out the correct cupboard first, but his arms felt like they were dead weight at his sides.
"Effective?"
"Mhm. Did my father send you? Why did it take so long?"
"That blowhard Pierce was one of the ones trying to get the briefcase and he was
"N-no."
"I'm not your brother. My brother is Thor."
"I feel like a kid on Christmas. Let's go look at our new goodies Nat."
Steve found himself freezing, staring down at Bucky in a moment of shock, a look that was mirrored though it was brief. There was creeping pain in his gut. At first he thought it was the ghost pain from their second fight on the helicarriers, when Bucky shot him from a distance. But it wasn't. He was shot
"Yeah...I just...I wanted to make sure you knew."
"It wasn't a question director. We'll be waiting."
"I told you I'd see you again Stark!"
"Oh I'm fine. Thanks for asking. Despite my car flipping three times. How's my driver?"
"Okay. Okay yeah. Hydra. We think it's Hydra." Tony jumped on the bandwagon, sending a quick look Steve's way before drawing the attention to himself. "They disappeared when Red Skull and Steve did. Shortly after, SHIELD was formed."
"What's that supposed to mean?" Rumlow's expression turned into a sneer and the man made himself look taller by standing straighter and squaring his shoulders, a tactic Steve had seen him do when other agents didn't agree with him. He was trying to intimidate and Tony wasn't flinching.
"Mn?"
"Oh?"
Actually.
"No no nonono"
It took some maneuvering. Steve's bed wasn't very big, barely big enough to fit just himself let alone two full grown men but Tony made it work. Steve seemed set on trying to keep some space between them but Tony once again made the decision for them both by invading Steve's space. He pressed into Steve's side, tucked himself under his arm and used Steve as a pillow, one arm lazily draped across the super soldiers middle. He never noticed how warm Steve was before and it quickly lulled him back into the sweet depths of sleep.
Again, the smallest of smiles from one of the wisest people in the world.
"Why--"
"Steve, come on. You're like twice the size of this little thing."
"Pierce. He's blowing the helicarriers. He's activated some sort of self destruct sequence. Bruce and JARVIS aren't having any luck. You need to get everyone out of there."
Special thanks to Hostbusters, deadgloves, roseandthorns28, pxrplegrxpe, Larrys_Consulting_Avenger and the_writer1988 for all of your comments! You are wonderful!
It looked a little familiar.
"If what you're saying is true, there are a few things I need to make sure are secure." Clint didn't specify but it was another secret Steve was already in the know about. His family. The little family on the farm waiting for him to come home. Of course he had to make sure they were going to be safe. "After that, I'll be back in DC to work with you."
He was scooped up  and held close by another pair of arms. An archer? They had an archer! It was a team of warriors! Like in the stories Thor loved to listen to! He couldn't wait to tell his brother all about this!
"A nice memory but not helpful to the current situation. Do you remember a blue cube at all? Glowed a little?" Another shake of his head and Tony scooted back to sit against the wall. "That's alright too. I'll figure something out. My friends are going to come and get us out of here but they tend to be a little late. I might have to step in and get the ball rolling a little."
The others looked over the plans, nodding at the information before getting geared up. He was already suited up, fixing the gloves of his suit. The suit Tony made for him months ago, before they'd become friends.
" For a second he paused. How close to Siberia was Tony? Was it another base or the one he already knew of?
to see you in DC Stark. I'm sure we'll see each other again
That was the plan. His plan at least. He was sure Steve would be on board.
"I noticed. Followed the sound of gunshots to find you."
He was well aware of the doors sliding open but he didn't stop working. Not when they were yelling at him to stop. Not when they were threatening to shoot him. Because a moment later he heard the now familiar hum of the shield flying through the air. It bounced off the wall and into one of the guards, knocking him down. A second later, Steve barreled into the room and into the next guard, slamming him into the wall.
"A suit of armor for us to use. Like that of your Iron Man. We have plenty of supplies for you to use here."
"It's where I trained for the military before I took the serum. It looks like they turned it into a SHIELD base."
Steve rubbed at his forehead, staring at the papers of his most recent report with disdain. He remembered writing, word for word, this exact mission report and at this point, it was starting to get tiring. Deeming it done, he sent it off to get filed and decided to leave for the day, hands stuffed inside his pockets as he chose to walk back to his place. It took longer, of course it did but it gave him time to clear his head and he could stop to pick up a few things on his way home if he wanted.
"Loki." It was Bruce now, still calm and gentle. "What's the last thing you remember before you woke up in the cell. Think very carefully."
He didn't know what he was expecting but he knew it wasn't the nice yet still somewhat covert black car that was creeping up behind him that had Clint half way hanging out the back seat passenger window. Natasha was sitting up front next to a driver with a hat pulled low over his face, though the very well trimmed and unique styled goatee was a dead give away anyways. Steve grinned.
"And to make sure you were still in one piece. I heard about what happened."
But this man, in the time they shared their cell, he was nice. He didn't talk to Loki like he was a child. He listened to Loki's stories on the second day after he came back later than the first and in turn, shared some of his own. He listened, to be polite because it was a way for Tony to remember what he could but he could still see the fear present there every time it took longer for Tony to remember something or when he forgot a detail in total.
