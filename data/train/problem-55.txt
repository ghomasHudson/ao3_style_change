Well, right now he didn’t. Ivan watched him work in the firelight, his delicate features thrown in high relief. Stepson of the king, so born to his wife from her previous marriage, something dragged along with her, awkward to deal with. Close to the king but with nothing to inherit—he’d save the choicest positions for his own future sons or sons-in-law. And so far the queen had given her current husband only daughters—did that make this boy’s position better or worse? Academic, really, Nico couldn’t found a dynasty of his own, not under this world’s strict rules of biological inheritance.
get expensive. But John had money. It would be ridiculous if he had magic to heal injuries and travel thousands of miles in moments, but not magic to buy things. And clearly this magic thing operated on sensible rules like that. He noticed his mother didn’t refuse the money he put in her account each month.
The stone floor was never cold on his bare feet, and there was always a fire blazing in the fireplace. Bilbo could have hot tea first thing if he’d remembered to put the kettle on the night before. Warmth, his host could provide, but not breakfast in bed. Bilbo washed in a luxurious bathroom where hot water poured over him like rain, and drained out a hole in the floor—marvelous technology. Dragons had a keen sense of smell so cleanliness was appreciated. When Bilbo dressed, he had a dozen fine suits of clothing to choose from, some with slightly odd fits and none with quite as much color as he preferred, but the fabric was silk, fine wool, supple leather, materials he couldn’t even name.
Bilbo’s room was in a niche on the wall of this treasure chamber, with a rock-cut stairway leading down from it for when the didn’t have a dragon to ride. That seemed a rather odd place for the king’s bedchamber to be—there were no others nearby—but whatever. Perhaps if he was a king with this kind of golden hoard he’d want to sleep near it, too.
John sighed and turned back to the map on his phone. “Let’s just get this over with,” he insisted. “Domestics are this way.”
“Aha,” the man replied, as if he’d found what he was looking for. Bay spared little brainpower to figure out what that was. “You’ve suffered a head injury.” Yes, many. “As a very young child,” the man went on. “Someone who was supposed to care for you. A deliberate attack.” Bay only shrugged slightly. He couldn’t remember all the injuries he’d been given as a child. “Well, that explains it,” the man decided, sitting back. The loss of contact between them made him seem less real to Bay, more a fragment of his vivid imagination, through which all manner of delights bobbed.
Bilbo awoke, as always, with a slight sense of disorientation. It had diminished over time but was not yet completely gone. The bedroom he was in was far too grand: soft sheets, blankets wrapped around him like warm clouds, pillows every way he turned. That was just what he could see and feel immediately. Then the intricately carved bedpost or headboard would swim into view, or the rich fabric hanging from the bedframe. By the time he sat up he usually remembered where he was and why, and then without fail a chunk of ice would form in his stomach, heavy with dread. His heart raced, his breath caught, he started to sweat; but then he reminded himself that he wasn’t dead yet, and that was something.
Bay glanced at the phone, which he’d left on the arm of his chair in case Magnus wanted it back. “And what good does texting the murderer do?” he asked, feeling suddenly quite weary.
Nico said nothing, but out of the corner of his eye Ivan saw him finally strip off his jacket and shirt, then his trousers. Studiously Ivan concentrated on cleaning some biological material from the head of his axe. He was going slowly, he reminded himself, and building trust. Well, slowly in a pushy way, granted.
There was a pause, and then Magnus suddenly flipped the pink suitcase shut and shoved it onto the floor off to the side. Bay closed his eyes and braced himself for the first blow, feeling almost relieved that it was finally going to start.
Another tapestry stretched across the entirety of one side of the room, hung on a curtain rod. When Bilbo felt he was ready, and he’d smoothed the bed covers back out and wiped up every bit of spilled water in the bathroom (with thick, soft towels, of course), he pulled the curtain back.
John left them and took Taffy outside, letting the little dog run around the yard while he checked his email on his laptop. London still existed, that was good to know. Magical travel could be a bit disorienting sometimes; he had a vague fear of accidentally time-traveling, and then not being able to get back home. He pretended that was what had happened to his father.
Donovan had called Magnus a psychopath. She and Anderson didn’t like him; there was some history there, something beyond just Magnus exposing their secrets and treating each other with mutual disrespect. On the other hand, Lestrade brought him in to help solve murders—he had professional value to him, at least.
“Hey.” He stroked Aquamarine’s cheek until the slave looked at him. “I do often buy slaves to train, and sell them on. Molly and Irene aren’t going anywhere, though. You can ask them how it works. I promise it will not be a surprise.” John resisted making any remarks about how Aquamarine still had a long way to go in his training, as this might discourage him from trying. “Now put your collar back on.”
Passage of time: a few hours, should be shortly after sunrise. Little sleep had been required. More would be appreciated, the body requisitioned, but was denied; mind needed stimulation more than body needed rest. Why was the air
A high-pitched whine, coupled with a growl of frustration. Aquamarine was not scared for his safety. He was terribly frustrated, even angry, about his inability to understand. “
“No, I suppose not.” Nico sat back, admiring his handiwork, and Ivan flexed his foot experimentally. It was bound tightly enough to contain the injury, but still gave him freedom of movement. “Very good,” he praised. Nico smiled for a moment, then remembered himself and scowled. “Get me some more water so I can wash up,” Ivan ordered, standing.
“To answer your question,” he said. “No, I wasn’t looking at your lips because of this or any other condiment. It’s worse than that, John. It’s—It’s one of
Holmes hums his own agreement in turn, but John can see his thoughts are somewhere else. “Not the owner of the gentlest character your…Sherlock, I gather?”
“I don’t think it’ll be necessary. I was wrong about you. You have Watson’s colourful turn of phrase, only yours is not restricted to your writing. You do write?”
“As I’ve said, 221B Baker Street changes in appearance much as you do, but the location remains fixed and is absolutely essential for this whole process. I am afraid that I was unable to understand everything; some details and explanations, not to mention,”—Mycroft lifts his eyes to the ceiling as if he’s about to quote the exact total of the Government’s budget for the next year—“terms such as ‘decoherence’ seemed abstruse even to someone with my mental faculties. But from what I gather, this location is some sort of a door between the worlds; a ‘portal’ was the word in use. Ah, but I see that at least this is a concept Doctor Watson here is familiar with!”
“I know nothing more than you do, John. It’s more a question of paying attention to what you do know.”
John would give a lot to somehow record the spectacle of a Sherlock Holmes keeping himself in check, out of respect for his brother. Holmes’s eyes are protruding from suppressed energy and impatience. John is sure Sherlock would have come down on Mycroft like a ton of bricks for not being given all the facts as soon as possible, but being spoken at in zigzags, instead. At least Mycroft is reciprocating his brother’s admirable conduct—he hurries to put him out of his misery by continuing his narrative. John’s misery is evidently of little importance. No change there, then.
Sherlock’s eyes go big and round in a most fetching way, but then they look away from John’s, unconsciously drawn to some movement behind John’s back. Sherlock’s mercurial face ripples, the prevailing emotion bewilderment. John just about manages to detect some very Sherlockian intensity of processing mixed with childlike regret, too, when a sound brings him back to reality.
Sherlock passes John the bottle of water he’s picked up from where John left it on the other side of the sofa.
Mycroft’s voice is quiet, too. “A young scientist in the very distant future was working on an experiment; an illegal experiment that resulted in him crossing from his own world into a parallel one. No real damage was done and the fellow was about to return to his home when an incident took place and started a chain of events, of which this situation here is only one of its innumerable consequences.”
They look at each other in silence, then John’s face start splitting into a grin that must be even more revoltingly sappy than his Victorian counterpart’s. Sherlock scans him, unblinking; suddenly his own face does something ludicrous and the most genuine, full-toothed smile lifts his plush lips like curtains in a theatre.
The first taste is bliss. John lifts his eyes to Holmes to find his head has fallen back. He’s now looking at the ceiling, fingers drumming. John bites another bitter-sweet smile and looks at Mycroft Holmes, expectant.
Holmes smile is too brief yet unmissable, like a silver flash across an indigo sky. “I was wrong. Similarities present themselves for those who can see them.”
“Yes,” Mycroft confirms. “Five altogether; this is the sixth. Nothing could be learned from them that I hadn’t learned from the second one—it really was most fortuitous that I was able to communicate with a version of myself from such an advanced point in history. The rest were all from a point in the past. Doctor Watson here is only the second man coming from what we can call ‘the future’. But to answer your question, Sherlock, what good would it have done to try and persuade you to believe in the existence of other worlds, of other versions of you? Those incidents, of which you lacked any recollection, did not harm you in any way. You seem to have it ingrained in you to contact me whenever they occur, and I have kept an eye on you and your home, of course.”
“And he was a savage, Sherlock,” he says heavily. “I shall never forget my shock at the appearance of that poor creature. Here, in this very room! You led him into it as one does a skittish animal; he was clinging to you and looking at me with a gaze where there was barely a flicker of intelligence. Yet as you spoke, both to me and to him, his posture relaxed and his face cleared. I was able to observe a remarkable change come over whatever was visible from his features—he appeared very much a reasoning creature, and one with certain dignity at that.”
“No,” John says, calm. “I know him for real. I always have and I’m telling you again, he would have thought about this.”
“And then,” John says between breaths, “you said the theatres were full of gay people and well, can’t argue with that!” He goes on laughing for a bit longer, encouraged by Holmes’s grin.
Holmes looks sharply at his brother, eyes widening in amused incredulity. He seems poised for a smooth, ironic return, but John has no time for this.
“You told me that Doctor Watson had disappeared and a strange fellow had appeared looking rather out of place and, as you put it then, “simply wild”. At first you had taken him to be an actor, possibly an agent of one of the many forces that would be interested in the ruin of your career. But no logical explanation presented itself as to what end this person should be sent to you. After eliminating all other possibilities, you arrived at the extraordinary conclusion that the man was from another point of history. Moreover, you had deduced that he shared many a trait with your missing companion, together with some similarities in personal circumstances. There were, however, significant differences between the two men.”
He blinks quickly under Mycroft’s discerning gaze, certain that all his thoughts have joined the silent apology on his face. Mycroft says nothing, though, and John gets the feeling he isn’t exactly the man’s priority at the moment. They both cast a quick glance at Holmes, whose flabbergasted status hasn’t changed. With something akin to an eye roll Mycroft returns to his story.
“…must be the truth,” the other Sherlock finishes, making John wonder whether he had been muttering to himself. “I followed the same method to form my own conclusion,” the man adds.
Holmes’s smile makes the briefest appearance on his lips, as John begins to suspect is its habit, but his eyes are unreadable while they scan John’s face.
As if echoing his thoughts, Holmes says, “My apologies…John. I should have given you a moment to wake up. Perhaps my counterpart has more consideration, but I’m afraid I never was very mindful of others when my mind is excited. And you must admit that our current predicament, although trying in many ways, does have certain aspects to provoke the deepest interest.”
“You can say that again,” John murmurs tiredly. The thin figure across from him leans forward with some mild concern. “Is your hearing suffering, my dear sir?”
“Leaving aside your understandable dislike of the deceased—yes?—the deceased James Moriarty, he must have been one of the foremost minds of his generation?”
After his little expedition to familiarize himself with the room—Holmes obligingly replying to the odd enquiry about various objects—John sits himself at the table and looks across.
John forces his gaze to remain calm, open. Holmes turns slowly to the fire. His profile is that of a masterfully carved marble bust.
lost my powers of observation, it would also provide you with an opportunity to nag about my not noticing whether you live or die, or something melodramatic to that effect. Don’t gape. The brown sauce by your mouth makes you look like a calico goldfish out of water.”
He stops abruptly. His gaze softens, as if reluctantly returning from the journey it has already begun.
Bay blinked at him. “Sorry, well what?” Obviously Magnus wanted him to go out as well, but frankly Bay was not interested.
He’d already turned his head to follow the kiosk they were passing. “Lemonade, master,” he clarified, as if he’d been talking about that. “May I have a drink, please?”
“Opinions differ,” Bay replied, and dared to shut the door. It didn’t lock, of course. Quickly he stripped off his shoes and clothes, so filthy he didn’t even want to contemplate them, and chucked the whole bundle into the hall. He followed the instructions on the wall to activate the health scan first, including the finger prick that would reveal the secrets of his DNA. Nothing that hadn’t been done before, and he tried to relax and stand still as the red laser beam washed over him, front then back, detailing all of his injuries for his new master to see. The reading should keep him occupied for a while.
“Don’t try to distract me,” Master panted a moment later, sounding very distracted. He rested his forehead against Aquamarine’s, still cupping his jaw. “Do not leave without my permission again,” he managed to repeat. “Do you understand? If something’s wrong come and tell me about it.”
Lights appeared in the distance, coming towards them. “Slow down,” Master instructed Irene, curious about who they would meet out here at this time of night. Aquamarine popped back up above the seats, watching the oncoming vehicle warily, since his master was. “Pull over more.” It was a big black SUV, magically pristine despite the dusty setting, and Master seemed to recognize it because he rolled his eyes and relaxed—somewhat—when he saw it up close.
The girls came home shortly after lunch and Aquamarine was drafted to help carry the impressive number of bags in from the cab. John knew his mother didn’t like them cluttering up her front parlor. “We’ll take them out to the tent this evening,” he assured her, holding Taffy so the curious little dog couldn’t get into any of the sacks. “Are you sure you got everything?” he deadpanned to Irene. He could afford what she wanted and didn’t like to tease her too much—her former master had delighted in keeping her without material possessions as it suited him—but he couldn’t
“You were thinking. It’s annoying.” Lestrade glanced at Bay and rolled his eyes a little, as if saying, ‘Can you believe this guy?’ Bay made a noncommittal shrug in return.
“—I think she can have another person to talk to if she wants,” John concluded. He stopped before a large cage holding three young people, two women and a man. One woman leaned on the bars, boldly making eye contact with people passing by, while the other two sat on the floor next to each other, gazes dropping when John looked at them.
Bilbo reminded himself that he was lucky to be alive and relatively well-treated, and he shouldn’t antagonize his creator. “Right, that sounds lovely,” he responded, putting some sincerity into it. “I wanted to do some laundry today, also.”
“And I believe you, because I have no idea what we were talking about at all.” John sighs. “It’s that damn way of speaking so fancy, in a sort of roundabout way. It’s catching. Plus, you know…I didn’t want to say anything that’ll make me put my foot in my mouth.” He notices that Holmes’s lips are twitching and his right eyebrow has shot halfway up his forehead.
“Correct,” Mycroft says. “The ‘portal’ opening is something that is not supposed to happen. The fault, however, occurs regularly.”
“I spent most of the night dedicating my not inconsiderable intellectual powers to the issue at hand, with little success. I was able to deduce that you come from a world some hundred, hundred and twenty years ahead of my own. Another fact we can safely count as established is that Watson is now with my future counterpart. I must confess that my concerns about Watson affected whatever limited scope I had for reasoning—one more proof that one should steer clear of emotions. Well, well, nothing can be done about that and frankly, in the case of Watson, I don’t wish to do anything.
“Erm,” John says eloquently, head shaking lightly and mouth corners going down in hesitation. “That time is a linear function? For us, humans, at least. That…what was it? That time travel is possible through wormholes, perhaps. There was something about a paradox…That you can’t go back on your time line, I think, or that you shouldn’t maybe?” John doesn’t want to admit how much of what he’s saying at this point might be coming from
“It was also then that I was able to put these bizarre occurrences into a wider context,” Mycroft is meanwhile saying. “I was given to understand that your humble abode, Sherlock, is ‘replicated’—meaning that there is an indefinite number of its varieties in existence. Just as there are varieties of you and Doctor Watson in different points of time, but always at the same place: here, this exact place. It appears that there are no two worlds containing the exact same versions of you at the exact same point of time.
He turns to the bedroom door abruptly. “You shall have the opportunity to find the answers for yourself. I came to wake you because we shall be visiting Mycroft. I am expecting his reply to my message with instructions. I thought you might like some time to prepare yourself for the meeting. I wasn’t so absorbed as to completely neglect my good manners. Watson has a hearty appetite under all circumstances.” Holmes's nose wrinkles in the most eloquent fashion, leaving John with the impression that said healthy appetite is both endearing and off-putting for Holmes.
Holmes has been called outside by Mrs. Hudson to make arrangements for John’s stay, so John has a few minutes by himself to contemplate his predicament. He knows that millions of people would give an arm and a leg to be in his shoes. John has always had a fanciful side to him—writing a blog about the adventures of a mad genius detective surprised only those who never knew him well in the first place. Okay, that’s not true. It surprised pretty much everybody, because not many people get to know him as well as a person should be known. It’s who he is. Around people, he’s always put forward his sensible, practical side. The dreamer he keeps hidden, but the dreamer is now tingling with excitement at how amazing this whole experience is.
There was a pause, and Bay felt a chill settle in his stomach. Was it going to be now, finally? “What? Why not?” Magnus questioned.
“The man who kidnapped Aquamarine was the killer the police have been looking for,” Master replied, running his hand through Aquamarine’s hair to calm him.
To Bay the atmosphere was very odd, though, and he looked uncertainly between the man and his master. It didn’t seem like Magnus thought an introduction was beneath him, more like it was somehow unnecessary. Unnecessary because they were all acquainted already.
The dragon growled a little, which did not necessarily indicate anger. “My adventures are all alike,” he complained. “Attack, people run screaming, burn everything, take what I want.”
“What?” Bay asked, not keeping his tone as subservient as he ought. He was getting tired of all these games, though—that was not his purpose, he was sure. He was just a slave.
“Did Aquamarine attack someone, Master?” Irene asked innocently. She glanced pointedly back at Molly.
seem to be icy; Nico’s nose was cold to the touch. When Ivan seemed to fall back asleep behind him, he allowed himself to do the same.
idea. He knew perfectly well what a motorized vehicle was, he’d ridden in them before and even knew several ways to disable them. He tried to express this by hopping confidently into the backseat, and then wedging himself between the front two seats for a better view of the road. Master signaled to Irene to go and she navigated out of the cluster of people and vehicles.
Bay did not move to get up. “Sorry, what?” As if he could hope for a sensible explanation for anything from this man.
Bay relaxed as the call ended. “Someone who stole the phone from what they thought was a corpse might panic, too,” he suggested. “Or conversely, someone who was trying to return the phone to its owner.”
,” Master added firmly, glancing between the two of them, “you’re not to touch either of them until I say so. Is that clear, Aquamarine?” He turned his eyes easily from Irene to Master and nodded. “Irene?”
She released him quickly. “Oh, sorry, Master!” He shook his head and offered her a chair. “He’s just very contrary.” John raised an eyebrow at her; if she understood how ironic he found her complaint, she refused to let on.
A chill went down Bay’s spine and he immediately dropped the phone and backed hastily out of the booth. He was not getting caught up in some creepy game—suppose that was the killer the police and Magnus were hunting for, who had seen Bay abandoned at the old house? Okay, that was rather fanciful, Bay told himself soothingly as he limped along as fast as he could. Much more likely it was something totally innocent, a phone call meant for someone else, and Bay glanced back, hoping to see a city worker at the phone, helping to resolve some issue with a sticky security camera. But the phone box was empty.
Molly touched the lashes on the back of his thighs and he made the loudest noise possible, while keeping his mouth shut, his fists clenching the blanket beneath him. “Sorry,” she said again, miserably.
“Why don’t you lie down and take a nap,” Magnus suggested, moving away from the bed, “and you’ll feel better when you wake up.”
“Why isn’t she with the other pleasure slaves?” Sherlock asked challengingly, not looking at the salesman.
This was not a summer camp, Bilbo wanted to point out to him, where he could just play all day free of care. That seemed imprudent, though. “Well, I like to do useful things,” Bilbo told him.
was the one who had spoken, as was Magnus. “Sorry,” he added quickly, dropping his gaze. Maybe… maybe his new master wasn’t exactly
waiting!” Magnus countered, racing further down the stairs. Bay had no hope of keeping up. “Look at her, really
Bilbo was not sure if he was being ironic or not. “It’s a bit difficult to keep stable, when you talk while I’m here,” he responded mildly, giving the larger situation a pass.
“I’m here to see Detective Inspector Lestrade,” Magnus replied brusquely. His body language indicated this was the gauntlet he had to pass through first—unpleasant but necessary.
“Yes, he ripped a man’s throat out,” Master told them matter-of-factly. Molly made a distressed noise and Aquamarine momentarily draped himself across her lap, staring up at her with crystal blue eyes. He wouldn’t hurt
“I’ll carry you to the laundry room,” Magnus offered—well, really it was more of a declaration. “It would be a very long way, with your tiny legs.”
Magnus had pulled a small magnifying lens from his pocket and was examining the woman’s jewelry. After a moment he pulled her wedding ring off her finger and peered at the inside, then replaced it. He sat back, seemingly done.
Bay considered it. “No, I shouldn’t think so.” Magnus clearly wanted him to come; so, Bay would do whatever he needed to for himself, to limit the trauma. He didn’t
“Mrs. Hudson is our housekeeper, she’ll see to your meals and laundry,” Master went on pragmatically. “You’re to do as she says. You can wander around the tent as you like but don’t go into someone’s room without permission.” He gave Irene a slightly pointed look.
John starts laughing. “He’s an arrogant sod who lives to get on the wrong side of people. He’s a terrible flatmate.” His eyes squeeze shut with emphasis, but then he coughs, shocked by the rollercoaster his emotions seem to be undergoing. “He’s also brilliant. He is quite extraordinary.” It’s all he can do not to let his eyes prickle. Thank God he didn’t call
,” Ivan allowed with a smirk. The boy was not amused. “Wash,” Ivan ordered, winging the wet cloth at him. Unconcerned with his own nakedness he dried with another cloth and then pulled on his clean-ish sleeping clothes—on the march he slept in what he wore during the day, so the thin sleep pants and shirt hadn’t been worn since they were last in a city under their control. But, they
Aquamarine stood quickly, the hand on his waistband practically holding the pants up. He hesitated to remove them, curious how his master would react to the refusal. There was no hope of retaining dignity as a slave; he had not been bought as a guard or laborer and his master clearly found him attractive, so the trousers would be coming off sooner or later. Flexing a little he hoped it was later; he wasn’t fully healed
Master was still talking to Lestrade. Aquamarine really wanted to rejoin them, to make sure his master was safe and knew he could count on Aquamarine to protect him—as
Aquamarine contemplated the object. He knew what it meant to sit on a chair-like object—benches, stairs, car seats. He just felt awkward doing so. Molly and Irene were obviously allowed, even expected, to sit on the furniture. He pulled the chair away from the table and, with only a small loss of grace, climbed up to crouch in it.
“If somebody unrelated had the phone, they’d ignore a text like that,” Magnus predicted. “But the murderer…” He paused dramatically, and the phone stopped ringing. “…would panic.”
At first Bilbo had been too nervous to eat much with the dragon staring at him—visions of being fattened up for later consumption persisted in his mind—but gradually he’d gotten more used to it. And the food was very good—steak, bacon, hard-boiled eggs, fried potatoes, flapjacks, muffins, fresh fruit, tea, the likes of which could not be found in Laketown anymore, even by someone who was willing and able to steal it. The secret, Bilbo had decided, was to not
At this Bay took a deep breath and let it out, then stood, wincing as he did so. He’d have a bruise on his leg, he predicted. “No,” he replied firmly, and turned to go.
Bay finished tying his shoes, the whole act of showering and dressing exhausting to him. Magnus had unfolded a bed from the cabin wall and it hung there like a great white elephant, taking up space both physically and mentally.
The yard wasn’t very big—his mother hadn’t wanted too much to take care of—but there were some nice trees, and the hedges prevented the neighbors from seeing
There was a dragon head on the other side of it, his great golden eye as big as Bilbo’s head. It blinked sideways. “Finally!” exclaimed the dragon, his voice deep and rich. “You’re very pokey this morning. I was getting quite bored waiting for you.”
John thought he heard raised voices coming from the upstairs, and growling; he rolled his eyes. He’d warned them. Some people thought John too lenient with his slaves, but he knew Molly and Irene would obey without question when he gave them a true order. Maybe someday Aquamarine would, too; it was too soon to tell. But he didn’t like to micromanage every moment of their lives.
Bilbo automatically glanced up at the ceiling, hazy in the distance, wondering if a dragon kick could bring the whole place down on them. “I hope you didn’t hurt yourself.”
The action shocked Nico, he could see. He picked up the knife suspiciously and examined it, as if Ivan could somehow have blunted it first. Ivan just shook his head like he found the boy hopeless and blew out the candles on his side of the room. “Lights out,” he prompted Nico, getting into bed. After a long moment the boy followed suit.
As Bay limped past a public telephone, it rang. He glanced at it once in surprise but then kept walking, having seen enough crime dramas to realize it was probably meant for a drug dealer or something. He saw a taxi approaching and tried to flag it down—they slowed, saw his collar, and drove on. Another phone rang, this time a payphone inside a fast food place Bay was passing, but it stopped as an employee reached for it.
“That much is obvious.” Holmes’s voice rings clear, out of the blue. During Mycroft’s monologue, he had looked almost catatonic in his immobility. His eyelids are still half-closed but it’s as if an electrical current is humming under his skin. “You enquired if John had left the premises,” Holmes intones, “which was a rather singular enquiry to put forward as a starting point of your assessment of the situation. It had to be of the utmost importance.”
to overwhelm him perhaps, for reasons of John’s own. He doesn’t have the time to pick them apart, but they pick themselves apart in that crafty way the psyche has when it manages to process something faster than any of the super advanced computing systems he just described to Holmes.
Mycroft Holmes takes a last big sip from his tea and places the cup on the small table by the armchair, then shakes his head heavily. “The fright you gave me then, Sherlock. Never have I had my entire life, all my life-long habits and routines, my orderly mind so turned upside down. And in a mere couple of hours! I had to rush and call for Mrs. Hudson to send out for Doctor Perkins immediately. He arrived quickly, thank heavens, and diagnosed you both to be in a state of nervous collapse. He gave you each something for your nerves and sent you directly to bed.”
Head spinning like it never did even back in the days when he first met Sherlock John gets on his feet and turns to the door. A thudding series of slow steps echoes in the entire building. At last they stop outside the door.
“Look,” Holmes says and takes a step to the left. John’s eyes fall to the spot his body was obscuring.
It is obvious that Mycroft has more to add, but he stops to take a couple of sips from his tea, watching his brother over the rim of his cup. Holmes puts the tips of his fingers together and places them to his lips, then proceeds to speak through them.
“Mycroft said,” he begins, uncertain. “He said something about the periods between the incident and your calling him growing shorter? Plural, incidents. He also said that you should know some of what he knows, too. Was it because you expected him to remember?” The last question is addressed to Mycroft.
His eyes go down to his crotch of their own volition, then jump to Sherlock’s mouth and what do you know! Sherlock’s stealing a glance at John’s lips. He was doing that yesterday too as well as the day before so John had stupidly thought he found another common idiosyncrasy that connected their scattered minds.
His protest was not very convincing; Ivan thought he could successfully press his case, for a few more minutes at least. But he had promised he would stop when asked—for tonight, anyway. Tomorrow was a different story.
“No, stay back, I’m still trying to—“ Someone else in the room, young and feminine by scent, nervous. Good. She should be. Pressure on his shoulder, his hips. The man was shorter than him but more muscular, better fed. Westerner playing in the desert among the savages, wealthy of course. “Shh, calm down, I’m not going to hurt you.” Wasn’t that exactly what someone who was going to hurt you would say? “I know you can understand me. You’re injured. I want to help you.” Of course he did; it was no fun playing with a broken toy. He would fix it first, then try to break it in his own way. “Calm down. Can you calm down for me?” His voice was measured, even, his whole weight pressing down the slave’s body. His hand started to run through his hair, filthy though it must me. “Shh, that’s it, calm down. I want to help you.”
Deprived, Aquamarine continued his antics, squirming away from Irene until he was actually upside-down in the chair, his back resting on the seat and his feet waving freely above his head. It did not look very comfortable to John, but he figured this was Aquamarine’s own problem. Gritting her teeth in determination not to be outplayed, Irene stood and went behind the chair, trying to capture a foot for the shoe she carried.
“Mine are the same,” Bilbo deadpanned, “except without the first three, and largely unsuccessful.” Magnus gave him an expectant look. “When I first left the Shire,” he finally began, with some reluctance, “I went to Bree, to an inn called the Prancing Pony. Do you know it?” He did not. “The innkeeper said I wouldn’t be much use to him, but since I’d already eaten three meals with no money to pay for them”—Magnus chuckled—”he had to do something with me, so he set me to picking pockets.

The dragon crunched through the gold coins like snow, his movements sinuous and sure-footed. From this high Bilbo could see none of it clearly, but he still winced slightly at the thought of the valuable objects that were being trampled underfoot. He spent a certain amount of time sorting through the treasure most days and had found so many crushed paintings and shredded tapestries, he’d started a pile of them in an empty room. If it wasn’t gold the dragon didn’t care so much about it. And apparently he wasn’t afraid of splinters, either.
The look he gave her was highly suspicious, and he glanced at John for guidance. With a sigh John just shrugged. “Up to you. You know what she’s like.”
“P—s off,” Magnus revealed succinctly, and for a millisecond Bay smiled involuntarily before he got himself under control. Yes, he could picture that—like with Anderson and Donovan, spouting people’s private failings for all the world to hear, because he was too brilliant to not see them, and too mad to keep them to himself.
, you live in this building! So I was able to rather easily obtain some of your own clothes for you. You’re welcome.”
“Well, you should’ve thought of that,” John replied shortly, and Sherlock fell silent. Technically, Lestrade’s ban applied only to Sherlock; John could leave him, and spend all the time he wanted in London. And the only thing Sherlock could think of that would be worse than being stuck out in the country, was being stuck there without John.
, to solve this drug-related murder of a free woman in pink. How he could hope to contribute anything worthwhile anyway was beyond him.
“Look, I’ll give you a drink when we get on the transport,” Magnus promised. Weak point. “Only I want to get out of here—“
Bay appreciated the positive attention, but now he felt anxious to reconnect with his master. “Was he angry?” he asked her hesitantly.
At least he knew his master’s home address and mobile number, thanks to the tag on his collar; but of course he didn’t have a phone of his own, and Baker Street was a long walk from here, if he could even find it. He knew London, but not at Google Maps level. A cab would be ideal—okay, he didn’t have any money on him, but hopefully once he got to 221B, Mrs. Hudson the housekeeper would be home and could pay.
“I’m here,” he says as clearly as he can. His forehead hits Sherlock’s chest. “I’m here.” It’s nice, so nice...
John’s feet on each step make a dull, scraping sound. Drag, thump, drag, thump—a symphony of tiredness, an ode to the bone deep need for sleep. The flat door moves closer; three final notes, and John pushes the handle down, swaying slightly inward with the motion.
rather than his knowledge of Physics. He’s pretty certain that thing about the paradox was real science, though. Something about meeting yourself…How it can lead to—
Familiarity—that was the fisherman’s bait. Holmes was the spitting image of a character from another story, John’s own story. In it, he met a madman who has now become the single most important thing in his life. The thought of never seeing Sherlock again storms the gates of John’s barely contained consciousness. It’s as bad as that week by the sea two months after Bart’s rooftop, when the shock had finally lifted, letting anguish have its way with John and tear him to pieces. He wants to pause time and let his shoulders drop, let his face find shelter in his palms while he battles tears at the irony that he has finally found the one place he never wants to leave by coming profoundly away from it.
John nods slowly, trying to wrap his head around it. Holmes’s voice doesn’t give him much of a chance.
He made Master uncomfortable, but he was powerful, a social superior, Aquamarine judged. Thus Master tried to remain cordial. “I already gave Lestrade my report,” he said briskly. “And we’re headed home, you can find us there if you need to.”
“Honestly, you need to heal up,” Magnus told him impatiently. “I doubt we’ll have much downtime over the next few days.”
him. Were mothers supposed to be nervous around their children? He’d never understood that sort of thing.
Aquamarine shook his head. “You’re not hurt?” John interpreted. He relaxed his grip to massage the back of his neck instead. “Then what’s wrong? Come on.”
Lunatic. Absolute lunatic. On par with the raving doomsday prophet he’d spent a few nights with at a master’s behest. He’d returned home with rare relief, because while that master had been cruel, he at least resided on planet Earth. Bay was not sure how to handle a lunatic full-time.
John stifled a sigh. “Mum, could you go check on lunch, please?” he asked politely. She was reluctant to leave but finally did, casting nervous glances back over her shoulder. Once she was out of earshot he turned back to Aquamarine with an expectant look. “What’s wrong?” he asked. His neck was starting to get stiff from staring upwards. “Aquamarine, get down now.
Even with the fire in the hearth the room was incredibly dark and increasingly cold. They didn’t even have glass over the narrow windows here, just wooden shutters. Marios was supposed to be a lush land, but the breeze from the sea could be chill and damp this time of year, and the thick stone walls were better suited to a crypt than a bedroom.
, think of the precious time being lost as he tried to help lesser minds reach the same conclusions he had ages ago.
The phones gave Bay an idea at least and he ducked into the next payphone booth, quickly calling Magnus’s mobile number collect. It rang four times, then Bay was cut off—voicemail couldn’t accept his charges, he supposed. He decided to keep walking, and to try calling from each phone he passed—maybe the string of calls would intrigue his master enough that he’d answer at some point.
After a long hesitation Bay limped out of the shower into the hall. Magnus, who had been sitting in the front cabin, jumped up and smiled at him. “There! You look much better,” he claimed. “How do you feel?”
Bilbo wasn’t sure how long he’d been working when he felt a soft breeze and sensed he was no longer alone. He still managed to jump when he saw the dragon at the doorway, however. “Don’t blame
this vaguely sinister confusion, all the hints and assumptions and warnings—but he was finding that he didn’t
“No,” Bay answered. He didn’t get much in the way of current events. It worried him how gleeful his master seemed about this, though.
Aquamarine had rather long legs and was not always careful with them; one flailing foot came a little too close for comfort to John and he decided he had to intervene. “Enough playing,” he told Aquamarine evenly, grabbing his leg. Molly quickly retreated to a safe distance as John pinned the leg against the back of the chair and gave the slave a steady look. “Aquamarine, you have to wear shoes if you want to walk around and see the modern world.” Irene seized the opportunity to shove a Doc Marten onto the trapped foot, and Aquamarine whined. “I’m sure it will be uncomfortable at first,” John acknowledged. “If you don’t want to wear the shoes, you’ll have to crawl around inside all day like a little savage, because the people who get to go out are the ones who can walk in
His blue eyes were so earnest. Could someone fake that kind of sincerity? No, not fake, that wasn’t what mad men did—they believed, fully and completely, in every moment, no matter how much they contradicted each other, or reality.
Both Aquamarine and Irene made noise beside him. They were two of a kind, really, both dramatic and attention-seeking. Obviously John didn’t mind those traits, either—he was looking forward to watching them play together, their competitiveness could be quite combustible. Which was not really something he should be thinking about while holding Molly.
For a long moment they just stared at each other. Bay didn’t get the sense she was trying to torment him, frightening Magnus’s slave because she was angry at Magnus himself. She was too matter-of-fact for that. It was almost like a warning, really—though she had to know there was precious little Bay could do about it.
“Is that what happened?” Bay asked carefully. “You blacked out?” The transport could’ve brought him home automatically—
Passed around a circle of friends? Been there, done that, got the bruises. “I look forward to meeting them.”
“He’s fine, Irene. Could you not—” John indicated the red marks her nails were no doubt leaving on his shoulders.
how it worked, so it seemed like magic to him, and he found that explanation sufficient. But his words suggested a more logical mechanism might be behind it, and if anyone could untangle it and enlighten the rest of them, it would be Aquamarine. He accepted the challenge.
They moved on. “I think she’s more lonely than anything else,” John revealed, wondering how Sherlock would react to that. “It’s only the two of us, and considering you’re
Aquamarine was now racing back and forth across the yard, regaining his natural grace as he got used to the weight of the shoes. John figured he would, as soon as he accepted their necessity. Wildlings were as intelligent as anyone else, though good luck getting people like his mother to believe that; and Aquamarine was exceptional, no matter what his origins. John grimaced as this reminded him of Mycroft Holmes’s comments. That was not a man given to idle chit-chat. He didn’t seem like the sort to be interested in owning a wildling, though, even after John had tamed him. And John was already beginning to wonder if he might not keep Aquamarine permanently, instead of selling him on. He had to see how he got along with the girls better, though. They were John’s first priority.
“These words exactly,” Magnus instructed. “What happened at Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out.” Bay started typing. “Twenty-two Northumberland Street. Please come.”
“Bay? Bay, wake up. Are you asleep?” He blinked his eyes, always slightly shocked to find himself back in reality—and slightly shocked at how he’d been awakened this time, with a gentle touch to his cheek and his name softly called. Usually it was a sharp smack that disrupted his dreams, and made him burrow into them all the more.
Self: stiff, clean, clothed, fed and watered adequately, no bandages, no pain, mind clear. Leather collar around his neck, new, slightly rigid.
every time I touch you!” he ordered angrily, cupping Bay’s cheek. “I’m not going to hit you, I told you that.”
Although, loud motorized vehicles with blinding lights swarming them was another situation entirely, one that Aquamarine didn’t know how to deal with. “It’s okay, it’s okay, come here,” Master said, trying to still his nervous scampering. “You’re alright, calm down.” He kept a firm hand on Aquamarine’s collar so he couldn’t get lost in the chaos.
Safe enough, on the surface, and it was better to be clean than dirty. “Alright,” Bay acknowledged—saying he
“Calm down, boy,” Ivan hissed in his ear. His voice was thick with sleep, grumpy almost; it was humanizing to Nico and he stilled as his mind righted itself. “I’m just keeping you warm. Your chattering teeth woke me.” The air outside the blankets
“What links the deaths?” Bay asked reasonably. As previously established, he wasn’t really up on current events. “Are they all thirtyish Welsh women in pink?”
This made the man roll his eyes. “Sometimes I think he doesn’t even try,” he judged, which seemed rather insulting. “He was supposed to be
“Don’t forget the northwest corner,” Magnus reminded him. “In case I haven’t returned by the time you finish your labors.”
Resolutely he turned and hobbled back onto the sidewalk. If they wanted him, they would have to take him.
“No, he didn’t like them much this morning, either,” John recalled dryly, and Irene laughed. “Don’t stomp, Aquamarine,” he suggested. “You’re doing really well. Try walking around in the grass.”
Magnus moved in for the kill. “So’s Sergeant Donovan.” Anderson’s eyes shifted guiltily to Donovan and Bay pursed his lips, trying not to smirk. Magnus sniffed pointedly. “Ooh, and I think it just vaporized,” he went on cheekily. “May I go in?”
started to seep back in, but slowly; they would give him a broader perspective on his narrow, ignorant life, without him really knowing why. “Then what do
“Three so far, another one almost certain to be reported soon,” Magnus conveyed excitedly. “Poisoned, no signs of struggle, no reason to kill themselves, found in strange parts of town, no apparent connection among them. Oh yes!” he added, texting avidly, “we have a serial killer on the loose in London!” He sounded, in a word, thrilled.
Lestrade huffed and Bay froze, but then the policeman nodded in exasperation and Bay approached the body. Not his usual sort of activity, forensics, but he lowered himself painfully to the floor beside her. He’d been a battlefield surgeon—no shortage of horror, combined with time pressure and often enemy fire as well—so in some ways this coroner thing was downright leisurely. Bay leaned down and sniffed at the woman, checked the skin on her hands, peered into her mouth, pushed an eyelid open.
This man seemed to understand the significance of that, as Lestrade had. “I see.” He did a quick calculation. “Well, this is very lucky for you, Bay,” he claimed. “I think we can be of assistance to each other.”
Sherlock’s lack of response to this was response enough. “Domestics,” he pointed out, and John made a sharp turn down the aisle he’d almost missed.
“Bring me that phone,” Magnus suddenly ordered, gesturing vaguely away from himself, so Bay pushed himself back up and began to look around. It was not his place to question his master about the philosophical conundrums of life, like why so many people seemed to recognize him or why Magnus had an archenemy. It was merely his place to locate and fetch his master’s mobile for him, even when it had tumbled off the edge of his desk into the bin.
“I do get bored,” Magnus admitted readily. “If I were going to play psychological games, I would pick a more powerful mind than yours, though.” He seemed to mean this reassuringly.
“Step-father,” Nico corrected. He finally wrenched the boot off and Ivan hissed with pain. Then they saw what had been sticking: dried blood coated the side of Ivan’s calf.
“Aquamarine,” his master prompted after a moment. “You should be able to speak. Repeat my name so if you get lost, you can tell people who you belong to.” He cocked his head to the side slightly. “Do you remember my name?”
Ivan splashed the fresh water over his skin before the fire, slopping it messily onto the flagstones. Sometimes he wished he
Bay remained standing, pushing the man’s temperament. “I need to get back to my master,” he stated, pointedly.
In hindsight leaving Aquamarine alone in the tent had probably not been a good idea, John decided. “Aquamarine? Aquamarine!” He knelt in the grass by the slave, who was rocking back and forth erratically, and slipped his jacket around his thin shoulders for warmth. “It’s okay, you’re okay, come here.” He pulled the slave into his arms and Aquamarine clung to him, whimpering. John felt hot tears soaking through his shirt and guilt stabbed at him. “Aquamarine, you’re safe,” he tried to assure him. “Yes, we’re someplace different but you’re safe—“
It was the most he had yet said to his new master and he was trembling by the end, frustration and rage and fear all mixed together inside him. A mad man who didn’t know the first thing about owning a slave, not even the parts that were beneficial to him, thus forcing Bay to pick up the keys to his own cell and hand them to his jailer—that went beyond mad to sadistic.
Irene made sympathetic noises, always with an air of amusement and flirtation behind them. She reached out to touch Aquamarine and he snapped at her, as a warning. She was not offended.
Magnus sighed. “Alright, we will take this slowly,” he decided. “I don’t want you to have an emotional breakdown.”
Magnus moved to lean against the bed, across from Bay. “You really don’t, I can see,” he judged. “You wouldn’t let yourself get into this position if you knew your true power.”
“Did I just text a murderer?” Bay sputtered, a chill going down his back. Naturally Magnus wouldn’t think twice about doing something like that.
He said those words with a touch of dismay. The country would not offer enough activity for him. “Whatever you would prefer,” Bay remarked, and Magnus rolled his eyes.
Magnus rose, and Bay braced himself for a well-earned blow. Instead his master caressed his cheek gently. “Perhaps you’re right,” he allowed. There was a slight quirking of his lips into a sad smile. “Perhaps you’re not ready for that yet.” Bay did not know what else to do but nod, eyes downcast. He thought he’d gone past the ability to feel despair long ago, but somehow this new master revived it in him—kind acts, mad talk, dangling the things Bay wanted most in front of him, even though he knew they were impossible. One day at a time, he repeated to himself—his old mantra.
reason that made him think of Nico. Of course, what didn’t; he existence was the sole reason Ivan had pushed this far west, trampling all kingdoms that blocked his path. Empires rose and fell, but love was eternal.
Irene finally returned from the house—naturally she’d changed clothes, to something with a little more sun protection though it could hardly be called modest. “Sunscreen, Master?” she offered innocently, and John let her apply it to his face and neck, enjoying the massage she added in. Suddenly her nails dug into his skin. “Oh, look what he’s doing,” she tattled in annoyance, and John saw Aquamarine trying to climb the oak tree. “He’ll tear his new clothes!”
Aquamarine stared back at him, unsure how to react. He tried and failed to look innocent, or humble. He wasn’t either of those things, but
“No,” Bay sputtered, intemperate and worse, unconvincingly. Other lives, times, and places, yes; when he vanished into his mind, leaving his body to its fate, he cherished such fantasies, so vivid and detailed, and sometimes surprising to him, literally dreams rather than conscious imaginings, he supposed. He was certain he had never pictured this tall stranger, with his cut-glass cheekbones, piercing eyes, full lips. He could never conjure anyone so striking. But maybe there was sometimes a presence lurking in his dreams, just out of focus, magnetic like this man was magnetic, drawing him in like they were halves of the same whole. “No,” Bay repeated reflexively. One
him to be compliant, wildling or not. “Do you want Irene to leave?” he offered reasonably. She made a disappointed noise, not hiding her eagerness to see him naked. Irene had clearly not been bought as a guard or laborer either.
Magnus approached the body slowly, eyes darting everywhere, but systematically. Bay could practically hear his mind clicking like a camera shutter as he took in one detail after another, unfazed by the larger picture. That was the secret, Bay supposed—one of them, anyway. He was still thinking about Jennifer Wilson, the woman in pink, dead in an abandoned house in Lauriston Gardens. Magnus was thinking about something else entirely—he shook his head slightly and then crouched down, running his hand along the back of her coat and studying his gloved fingers. He dug into her coat pocket and pulled out a small folding umbrella (surprisingly not pink) and examined it. Then he checked under the collar of her coat.
The back door opened again and Aquamarine crawled out onto the deck. Mrs. Watson stepped away from him as he approached John’s chair and knelt up. He was wearing dark jeans—rather tight—a button-down shirt that wouldn’t stay tucked in, and a green argyle sweater vest. Since John had only ever seen him in loose, casual clothes, the change was sexier than he would have imagined. “Don’t you look sharp,” he complimented with a grin. He avoided groping Aquamarine in deference to his mother’s presence, even though he quite wanted to.
“Honestly?” Magnus nodded, with great interest. “I guess you could be playing a game,” Bay hypothesized slowly. “Pretend you recognized me, just to mess with my head. All that nonsense with your archenemy acting like a cartoon villain—”
was soft, but it had short sleeves, so it wouldn’t protect his skin from the sun. “The sun isn’t as strong here,” Master assured him, “so you can go outside for a few minutes without worrying about it. But any longer and you need coverings and sunscreen.”
John rolled his eyes. “You, who run through the sewers, socialize with homeless people, and keep eyeballs in the microwave.”
His master shifted his posture slightly, straightening out his legs, and held out his hand to Aquamarine. The command was obvious, Aquamarine just didn’t know if he wanted to follow it. Though he would have to eventually, or face worse. Gingerly, he crawled even closer, then took his master’s hand and straddled his lap.
Bay would really like to know the answer to that question himself. This was the third person who acted like he ought to know who he was, specifically, personally, as if they’d just been on holiday together. It was very unnerving.
Magnus sprang to his feet and threw open the door. “Suitcase!” he shouted as he clattered down the stairs. “Did anyone find a suitcase? Was there a suitcase in this house!”
Molly was kneeling on the floor now, too, peering under the table in concern. Irene must have poked at Aquamarine; John heard him snarl and her squeal, and she sat down hard on the floor in surprise. “Irene, I told you,” he reminded her. He resumed his seat at the table with his coffee. “Just let him get used to things. Come on, Mum, sit down and have some breakfast.” Clearly she wasn’t sure if the table was safe, what with the wildling hiding under it. “He’s over here by me,” John added, feeling Aquamarine against his legs. “He won’t bother you.”
“The country expects them to be defiant, to repel the invaders,” he added, then glanced up cautiously to check Ivan’s reaction before continuing.
“This is not a negotiation,” Ivan interrupted, standing. He set the axe aside first. “Get in bed. Now.” Nico lifted his chin slightly, blue eyes glittering with defiance. He’d been fairly well-behaved up to this point, really, a bit mouthy but done all he was told. This was the key moment then.
After a moment he realized the car had stopped. “This it?” He saw a sandwich shop and a dark blue door.
Master was agitated about something, though. Normally he was very calm and confident, but now he paced slightly around the room, obviously deliberating over something. Petulantly Aquamarine found it boring and wanted to go back to his own room. After a moment Master sighed and sat down in a low chair, cheek resting on his fist as he regarded Aquamarine tiredly. “Come take my books off,” he finally said.
Nor did this anger Master. “Don’t provoke him, Irene,” he said, his voice suggesting she probably wouldn’t listen. “Let him get used to you first. Irene can be very bold, but she means well,” he added to Aquamarine, who had picked up on that easily enough himself. At least about Irene being
If you ignored the fact that dragons were notoriously unpredictable and treacherous, it really wasn’t a bad life, and there was more than a grain of truth in Magnus’s characterization of him as a ‘stray.’ But Bilbo was not fooled; like any pet, he might be novel for a while, but that could eventually wear off.
tempting, but his survival instincts held on a little longer, fingernails on the ledge. “Okay,” Magnus agreed simply, sitting back. “Well, why don’t we just get on with our parts in this world?”
, he tried to convey. Only bad people. “He was defending me,” Master went on. “So well done.” Aquamarine spun back around and barked in acknowledgement. “He can look after you two.”
There was a pause instead of an answer, and Bay looked up to see Magnus giving the man a scoffing look, as if the answer ought to be obvious. It was not, apparently, and the man waited expectantly.
Nico shrugged a little, finally freeing one foot. Ivan sighed, allowing a tinge of the mortal pain to seep through to ground him. Sometimes he truly admired people, for all they accomplished despite the pain they
Then he went for his head, turning it to either side to look at his ears. His master’s touch was firm, clinical, but also gentle, the necessary contact augmented by an extra caress or lingering graze. “Ears fine, jaw, nose, mouth better,” he murmured to himself. “Eyes… can’t even see it now.” His thumb brushed the skin above Aquamarine’s left eye. “Very nice. Is your vision alright?” He nodded. “Not blurred?” He shook his head. “How do your teeth feel? Are any of them loose?” Aquamarine ran his tongue along them experimentally, then shook his head again.
Molly looked ready to comply, but Irene was watching Aquamarine rebag the clothing he’d disturbed—his expression was sullen, and she had a wicked gleam in her eye. That could only mean trouble. “Irene—“ John prompted.
“It’s no use, there’s no other way,” Magnus murmured, more to himself. “We’ll have to risk it.” He held the mobile aloft, but without looking at Bay. “On my desk there’s a number. I want you to send a text.” Bay was already limping over to take the phone. He did not think to himself, why didn’t you tell me this when I was up before, because a slave couldn’t expect that kind of consideration from his master.
In response Ivan reached forward boldly and grabbed him—not the recommended approach in a knife fight, granted, which was why it was so effective. In an instant he had the boy’s back pressed firmly against his chest, one arm holding both of his in place, the other tight across his hips. It was an intimate position and he could practically feel Nico realizing he’d gone from bad to worse. He struggled furiously.
Nico whipped away from him, slender body in a fighting stance—and in his hand was a knife. Okay, Ivan would admit to being pleasantly surprised by that one, and he grinned openly as they circled each other, which he could see discomfited the boy. “Very spirited,” he allowed, “but you’re just delaying the inevitable.”
Bay let his mind wander as they drove—not vanishing entirely, just going over everything that had happened to him in the last few hours. It was more than usually happened to him. Donovan, Anderson, this unnamed man were all his master’s enemies; Lestrade might be more of a friend. Not a great ratio there. On the other hand, who told a slave their new master was a psychopath? Who offered a slave money to, presumably, spy on their master? Well, alright, people
had protected Aquamarine. But he knew he was supposed to stay with Molly and Irene, and look after them on Master’s behalf. This conflict led to a certain restlessness, and he snarled at a uniformed man who wandered a little too close to them.
,” Magnus proclaimed. He was proud of himself, but there was a certain childlike aspect to it, in the way he eagerly presented the information to Bay. It was something about how because the suitcase was pink, the killer would be eager to get rid of it discreetly, so Magnus had found it in a dumpster near the crime scene. Bay nodded along and kept his eyes focused, but he was only half-listening; his thoughts were mainly occupied by Magnus’s earlier revelation. Something inside him wanted to trust that Magnus’s intentions were good, even if he was clearly missing a few connections in his mind. For Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson, perhaps he’d merely showed them Bay’s picture—plenty of time to do that from the transport—and talked him up so much that when he finally appeared in person, they
