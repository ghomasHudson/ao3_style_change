“Come on, Sherlock.. We need to get out and be, I don’t know, normal? Normal isn’t a term I’d use to describe us, but we need to at least go socialize. It won’t kill you to get out of this flat. You promised me you’d go.” John returned the pouting lip and widened eyes causing Sherlock to give in.
“Mummy.. why did I agree to this?” Sherlock flopped down onto the armchair near her desk. She turned and gave him a delighted sigh.
“I’m not really surprised..” John didn’t sound disappointed, he smiled. He laughed. He laughed. “I don’t care anymore. Sherlock, I’ve been too afraid to move, too afraid to act, and now that whatever the hell you put into me is now in my system, I’m not backing down.” John leaned forward. “Kiss me.” Sherlock’s eyes widened.
“My choice had nothing to do with your families or your beauty, in fact it was quite random. I sent a guard to each kingdom and told him to search for a specific flower. If he found it within twenty four hours then he was to go to your ruler with an invitation. If he couldn’t find the flower, then he was to return home. Out of the twenty six guards sent out, only seven found the flower.” Sherlock picked up his cup and took a sip. The women looked at each other in shock.
“Yes, little brother, I’m aware of what the guard said. Mummy made that up to get you back home. She didn’t like the idea of you in Aponi, with all the attacks or something..” Mycroft spoke as he studied his papers. Sherlock glared at the back of his head before relaxing completely.
“I’m sorry, I couldn't risk getting either of you killed.” Johns sudden embarrassment over dragging them like rag dolls was noted by both royal parties.
“and I’ve been so afraid that with your brothers work choice that you would follow his lead and leave me as well! You remember the Andersons and how Martha’s boys left her alone? She died of heartache three months later! The poor sap couldn’t handle her quiet home. Oh, love don’t let me die alone!” She continued her rant and tears.
“Now then, you’ve wasted enough time being coddled by my handmaiden! Our guests will be here shortly.” Mummy’s attitude perked up as she took Sherlock by the arm and led him away.
Sherlock smiled, leaned over him, and captured his mouth with his. A simple kiss, a slow one, but it did its job. “When I return, I intend to- screw you through the mattress- as they say.” And then he was off the bed and out of the room. The object inside him slowly buzzed against his overly sensitive prostate.
“John, you came!” Squeaks the small voice from behind him. John feels himself smiling.
John thought he was going to burst from the vibrator alone, he wasn’t ready when Sherlock leaned down and took him in his mouth.
“It was awful!” She cried out. “He barely talked to me and I offended him! We had to leave early, because there was an attack! I think they made that up, because there wasn’t any chaos or confusion when we left, no blood, no battle! I don’t think he’s even into any of us.” Enola let that last part slip causing many gasps to sound.
“Do you have someone in mind? I can send for Greg if need be. He is around here somewhere.” She waved at the door then returned to her papers. Mycroft glances down at the same paper to point something out to her gaining a pat on the cheek and a “good boy”.
“When did you see him last?”
“Yes, now. I plan on utilizing every hour of this afternoon. If I’m going to do everything I want, we need to start now.” Sherlock shot back as he reached his door.
“Father will be greatly displeased..”
“Kiss me. I won’t get another chance. Please.”
Things are about to take a turn for the worse.
“Mycroft, your men have failed. There was an attack in Aponi. A guard said the walls were-“
“But aren’t all ears listening ears?” Johns eyebrow shot upwards, almost connecting with his hairline.
“Exactly-” John's eyes opened a bit wider. “Excuse me, I didn’t mean to talk so much. Did I answer your question, My Lady?” Johns polite character shone through his blushed features.
“I’m off,” John said once more. “I’m not sure what is happening, but- but I like it. I’ve never felt so,” He looked at his hands as if for the first time, “alive.” His eyes shot back up to pierce through Sherlock’s. “And right now, I feel like I’m going to explode. All this energy is pent up. I don’t know what is going on, but I need- I need something.” John sat frozen on the bed as time slowly ticked by. “You.”
“He was- touched, if you will, by your father’s actions. He thought he was alone in the room, he thought no one would hear his cries, but out of nowhere- this blonde willingly throws himself in harm’s way for his king. Father wrote in this book about it, I’ve read it many times,” Sherlock pushed the red velvet book toward John. The knight stared in disbelief.
“It’s fine, you were only doing your job.” Enola smiled genuinely at him. “Thank you.”
“Wait, you’re leaving? No way, take me down. Sherlock, I swear to god, if you leave me here I’ll kill you!” John knew he wasn’t a threat while tied up, but that didn’t stop him from plotting his revenge for later.
Their ride across the kingdom took some time, more time than expected. Enola attempted to make small talk every few minutes, but the prince didn’t seem to care. His attention was turned to the window by the knights head. John caught him staring at him a few times, but said nothing.
She made her way past the others in the room to find John stuffing his tongue down Sherlock’s throat, and dang was that a sight to see.
“I told you earlier, if you wish to stay downstairs- in my bed, then you will wear your clothing.”
After Sherlock talked one of the blokes into trading his room for a bunk, he made his way into the living room. John’s laughter filled the cabin, but this wasn’t his normal laugh, no, this was his tipsy laugh. Oh, great, this trip has taken a turn for the worst.
“Mum.. Do you think I could have my own protection? You have your handmaiden.. although she isn’t for protection she, follows you around everywhere.” Sherlock began to mumble. Mycroft let out an odd sort of laugh.
“Where are we?” John looked up at the now grey bricks that lined the walls. In the other rooms, they were white. This room in particular, looked much different than the others he’s seen.
“How was it?”
The curtain draws back almost at the same time that he leans against the wall. A hand reaches out, fists his shirt, then pulls him behind the curtain. Next thing John knows, he’s being kissed in a poorly lit, very tight, changing cubby.
He searched the castle, but to no avail. The guards and knights held unique shifts. How was he to know where to go? Instead of wandering around like a lost pup, he decided to search for his mother. She was in her study discussing something Sherlock found boring with Mycroft.
So sorry this took me so long to post! Things have been hectic at my house so i havent Had much free time. I’ll try to do better!
“Goodbye prince!” John called out as they walked off. Sherlock felt his face heat up as he thought of a pair of blue eyes he just met. What had gotten into him?
“Dull..” Sherlock murmured to himself as he averted his gaze to the burnt yellow walls surrounding them. He lost track of time until his mother snapped him back into reality.
“How are you still awake?” Sherlock chuckled as he lifted the blanket and climbed in.
“Hi..” she wanted to shy away, it was obvious, but she stood her ground. With her feet planted, she offered a smile instead of her hand- Sherlock would thank her for this later.
Sherlock let out a sigh against John's lips, unknowingly offering to further the kiss. As soon as he started kissing back, John pushed him down onto the bed. He pulled away to ask “is this okay?” to which Sherlock only nodded. The lump inside his throat grew as John latched onto his exposed neck. His lips grazed the soft skin, his tongue darted out to tease, his teeth made an appearance and bit. He sucked marks into the sensitive skin, claiming. Claiming, why is he claiming?
Seven more minutes.
“I’m not sure what’s gotten into me, but I don’t want to stop. I’ve just now gotten the courage to move, and I’m not going to cower down. Don’t make me.”
So sorry that it’s taken me a long time to post,, I’m going to try to start posting more
“John, I’m sure he didn’t think about that. He wouldn’t have wanted to break your family apart.” The prince felt as if his lungs were caving in on themselves. His purpose of bringing him here, wasn’t to break the man, but to learn more. Clearly, he’s got enough information, now it’s time to go.
Reluctantly, they followed her. Ludovica smirked at the others as they sat down in the room Lady Hudson chose.
“What’s this mess about?” Irene stepped into the room with the most noise. Either someone was fighting or someone was doing dares.
With part of the day gone, they finally made it to the flowery city. Common people stopped in awe as they stride into town. The brick and wood buildings stood tall amongst the people. Small animals scurried around the children that ran with trinkets in their hands. Mothers and fathers ushered the young along as they built their stands.
“Don’t over exaggerate, brother, they aren’t that bad. They all seem to care for you, or your looks.” Mycroft looked up from his papers to stare blankly at the prince. “Get off my bed, you’ve messed with the sheets.”
“No, I’m simply bored. I need something new, different. My routine should change.” The prince hoped his lie would sell.
“I didn’t know you fought in a war. Which one was it?” Enola asked eagerly. Her eyes fixed on his knight with an abundance of surprise. John sat back in an uncomfortable silence.
This is when things get interesting. John let himself be taken by his loves hands. He closed his eyes and just felt. He let his senses be invaded by the younger man, let his body enjoy these practices movements. He was doing fine, up until Sherlock found the spot. He added another finger and kept at his steady pace.
“Watson’s boning that pale bloke on the couch.” Phil supplied her answer. She looked at him with amusement twinkling her eyes that quickly turned to horror for the two.
John wiggled and pulled against the ropes around his wrists. His thighs shook, his stomach tightened. If he could only move the stupid thing off his prostate…
“So what are we doing here? This was supposed to be a high honor, but with the information you just gave us, it doesn’t seem but a lucky coincidence that we are here. If I’m to stay all week, may I at least know our schedule?” Janine spoke with a mixture of intensity and sheer boredom.
Sherlock’s eyes shot up to meet Johns and for a moment he forgot how to speak. When he cleared his throat, he looked down at his father’s desk. “I remember that day. He came back disoriented, he told mummy to kick everyone out. He hid away in here for three nights. Mummy ran about frantically, just trying to put the pieces together. The man that attacked my father almost killed him, if it wasn’t for yours, he would have died at the hands of a common thief. John, he didn’t let your father die, he tried to send whoever he needed to his bedside, but your father refused his services.” Sherlock could remember how tired his father’s face looked, and how broken and defeated his father became after losing such a loyal knight.
“John!” Sherlock flung the covers upwards.
A gasp escaped his lips as he read the next fifteen pages. All of them spoke, in detail, of the man he knew to be his dad. The king seemed to know more about the Watson’s than John ever knew. How was this even possible?
“Yes, well, you wouldn’t have normally said yes to a retreat in the mountains with a bunch of people our age. Now would you? No, didn’t think so. Look at it this way, now you don’t have to get me anything for Christmas, this can be my present.” John beamed at the thought of a getaway gaining another groan from the brunette.
“Uhh, Fine!” Sherlock threw himself back against the cushion. “You tricked me into promising to go. You know I don’t pay attention while in my mind palace. That was a cheat move, John.” Sherlock continued to pout at his circumstances.
“Now? It’s the middle of the-”
“Sherlock, we’ve been over this. It’s the holidays and she invited us. We are going. We’re in uni, you should be living up life, not sulking about a party like a toddler.” John put his hands on his hips and stared down at his overly dramatic boyfriend. This was getting ridiculous.
“Sherlock are you feeling ill?” Greg felt Sherlock’s forehead. “Your cheeks are bright red! Maybe you should sit down.” Greg teased knowing where the blush came from. Sherlock cleared his throat.
“John, stop, you’re not in your right mind-” He couldn’t admit that he quite liked this. He couldn’t admit that this was a possibility he considered beforehand. He couldn’t admit that by proceeding he would be taking advantage. He couldn’t admit that he wanted to. With a reluctant grunt, he pushed the blonde off him.
“I’m aware that your people appreciate natural beauty more than others, but I don't know the extent of your knowledge on my kingdom. Nevertheless, we will be visiting the gardens of Aponi.” Sherlock looked her down before beginning his stride towards the guards and horses. Enola’s eyes lit up as she quickly followed.
“Well, anybody else feel the need to leave? Feel free to go now, if you’d like.” Hudson smiled and motioned to the door.
John felt his face heat up then slowly looked down as his lower half began to twitch. There’s no way he could be excited again and so quickly too. There’s no way, there’s no-
He wishes he could climb onto the stage and pull the boy off, to kiss him multiple times, to smother him with his attention, yet when he thinks of the reality of those wishes, he changes his mind. Privacy would be best.
“I’m afraid, my dear, that I must be excused.” Irene bowed to Lady Hudson before following her friend to another room.
“That’s our golden city. Remember dear boy, your father took you to their gardens when you were younger. Most of our herbs and medicinal plants come from there. We can’t afford to lose Aponi to a bunch of ruffians.” She practically spat her disgust into her last words. Sherlock frowned at the thought.
“As you know, you have all been given the opportunity to personally serve your majesty-“ Greg started. “I want him” Sherlock cut in while pointing to the short blonde knight. Greg regained his composure from his startled state and smiled. “Seems he’s already made his choice. You may all go back to your business.” Greg walked up to the chosen knight. “Hey, what’s your name?” He asked.
The detective pulled out until only his tip was still connected to John, then pushed back in with the determination of a madman. He kept at this until both he and John were red in the face and sweat began to form on their temples.
“Oh, just look at you! My handsome boy..” she pinched Sherlock’s cheek and gushed. “What a shame your brother decided to take part in government and lead a lonesome life. His decision to never supply me with grandbabies to spoil leaves my heart a sorry mess.” Their mother drew out a long sigh as she looked back at her older son.
“Yes, only two or three drinks can turn John into a blubbering lunatic. Molly, he’s going to hate me in the morning.” Sherlock pushed John's face away from his neck.
“Sorry, my lord. I’d hate to of frightened you.” The blonde pushed off the wall and bowed before the prince.
This chapter was longer than the last so yay. Next chapter will introduce Enola and her background. Just to recap, the princesses are: Irene, Molly, Janine, Enola, Ludovica, Alessia, and Artemis.
“Mm” Johns knees bent as his legs threatened to pop up. Sherlock continued to rub over his prostate making him pant as his back arched off the bed.
Enola brushed everyone off and made her way to the couch. After plopping herself, not so gracefully, down onto it, she let out a deep sigh.
John watch in amusement as Sherlock snaked around the castle. He did his best to keep up and stay quiet, but almost lost it when Sherlock tripped over the extravagant rug that led to the dining room.
“I believe you meant to say, how dreadful..” Sherlock corrected him while rolling his eyes. Mycroft opened his mouth to respond, but a woman followed by four men walked in and rushed to Sherlock’s side.
“I know, hush.” It was like John could read his mind. “He knew you wouldn’t respond to him, so he called me.”
When all was done and quiet, they were able to rest. Sherlock laid on his back with John leaning his head on his chest. A hand found its way into the blonde spikes as another found itself rubbing circles into the skin of his back.
“Good, because that was dreadful! I have to court six more of those hateful women!” Sherlock dramatically threw himself onto his brothers bed.
“His name is Greg. Do what you’d like sweetheart. I’m terrible busy with your brother. There’s been word that the Kineks are planning an invasion of a city around our borders. We haven’t figured out which city yet, but Chenoa is a good guess. Many of our resources come through there, so I’m betting they will attack them first.” The queen traced her finger alongside the map. The prince stood to look at it with them.
“I’m glad you did, because when I went out, I forgot to buy some. Come along John.” Sherlock spun around to head back to their room.
“Come for me” and that’s all it took…
No, John couldn’t give his own advice. John wasn’t meant to be a companion. He was meant to be a protector. He was meant to serve, not give advice. Besides, his advice would be biased. John stopped putting his socks into his drawer and thought over what he was implying.
“Sherlock!”
“Are you kidding me? You, Sherlock Holmes, are a ridiculous man. I certainly didn’t see it, and even if I did, it wouldn’t matter. You were amazing. Besides, everyone messes up, no one is perfect.” John offers a smile and lets his wrist go.
“I know it’s fine.” Sherlock shot back. Tension seeped into the atmosphere, causing both men to stand frozen. The pink tip of Johns tongue darted out and slowly dragged across his bottom lip, catching the attention of the prince.
“Stay still young master, this will only take a moment.” Lady Hudson adjusted the collar of Sherlock’s shirt.
“.. I know..” Sherlock breathed out then turned his head to avoid John. “He won’t stop.” Sherlock smirked as John nibbled at his ear. Irene wanted to be disgusted, but was too amused at this side of the blonde. Knowing how John feels about pda, he’d be mortified to know how raunchy he’s acting and that Sherlock hasn’t stopped him.
“Don’t give up on me now, John. You’re almost there.” Sherlock turned the vibrator up another notch, then set the remote down on the nightstand.
“That’s correct, I don’t have friends.” Sherlock sighed as he stood up from the desk. “No one bothers with me.”
John stared in disbelief at the wonderful man before him.
Sherlock bucked his hips a few times, causing John to writhe under him. Johns back arched once more, disconnecting their lips. Sherlock took this chance to bend down and bite a lovemark into his shoulder. John cried out and wrapped his legs around Sherlock’s bottom half.
“Did it work?” He asks and barely leans forward. John’s smirk widens as their lips meet once more. Proud hands come to rest on Johns sides. John lets his own hands find their way around the naked torso, until they stop at the curve of Sherlock’s back.
“I put your clothes away in the closet. You can change later.” Sherlock bent down and laid John onto the bed. When he pulled away, John grabbed his arm to pull him back down.
“Why are you here? You’re new.” Sherlock shot his eyebrow upwards. John folded his arms to his chest and smirked.
“Where is he?” Mrs. Watson turns her head as she searches the room. Her gaze is piercing, purposeful.
John pushed against Sherlock’s chest, pinning him down against the couch. Neither of them were aware of the cameras filming them, or Sherlock would have forced John off his lap. The hell the brunette would have to pay for this one.. even if John started it..
“No, not particularly a lesson. You are free to go, if you’d like.” Hudson responded with the same polite smile from before. Janine stands, excuses herself, then leaves. The remaining women, Molly, Ludovica, Artemis, and Enola feel the need to stay. They can’t explain why, but they want to sit with this older woman whose smile could kill.
When all is done, the lights are raised and all are on their feet as the dancers bow on the stage. John claps enthusiastically as his mother cheers.
“Yes, I have.” John commented, trying to hide his sudden embarrassment.
John tried, oh how he tried, but he couldn’t do it any longer. He needed to move. To get out. He couldn’t do it. He just can’t do it.
“Is that why you bought the rope? You were trying to coax me into this! Get me in a good mood just to ruin it! John, that is emotional manipulation! I can’t believe you!” Sherlock threw his hands around in mock astonishment causing John to chuckle.
“I was trying to grab my shirt, but you stopped me from doing that.” Sherlock continued getting dressed, and John steps out.
“Hurry up, John!” Sherlock raced down the hall. His face lit up from his contained laughter. John ran after him. He was not sure where the prince wanted to go, but that didn’t stop him from tagging along.
“Stop! Don’t touch that!” A man in a robe lifted his mask and grabbed her wrist before she could touch any of the plants. “That’s poison…” he let her go with a worried glance around.
“What?”
“What kind of a man doesn’t eat?” The girl in purple, Janine, asked with a smirk. Sherlock looked her way, but sighed. Only one thing was on his mind.. the end of this awful brunch.
“You really should get dressed now, wouldn’t want anything indecent to happen while anyone could walk in.” John teases as he pulls away.
“Giving birth to spoiled children that can’t appreciate the sacrifices their parents have made? You must remember your family name is what got you your position in the first place. Your brains are one thing, but that wretched attitude of yours is your downfall.” Their mother glared Mycroft down.
“Let’s get this over with..” Sherlock mumbled.
“Irene Adler.. you must be the handsome boy that’s stirred up the nation. All the tribes and kings have talked my ear off about your family… i can see why they’ve taken an interest in you.” The girl smirked. Sherlock didn’t know how to respond, but his mother’s uncomfortable laugh broke his stare. Two more families introduced themselves then the announcements were made.
“My father may not have been a great man, but he served his people. He did his best to keep them in line and share the wealth of our kingdom, that was his downfall. Taking care of others before your own can lead to many weaknesses.” Sherlock commented with no expression, which worried the knight.
Sherlock watched Johns chest rise and fall as he took in a few calming breaths. After making sure to thoroughly slick up himself, he placed his index finger at Johns entrance. Usually he’d ask if John was ready, he’d be gentle, he say something sweet, but tonight was about endurance. Pleasure would inevitably come later, but right now in this moment, he needed to keep focused.
Sherlock slumped until he fell off the bed. He shouldn’t have told his knight to go off and rest. He should go find him..
“Come on guys! Since you guys are late, the others have already arrived and taken most of the bunks. Irene has started passing out drinks, so you may want to get in before they’re all taken.” Molly ushered them inside through the large wooden door.
“I told you I would, Molly. You looked great out there! My mum loved it.” John turns around to give her a proper hug.
“Well, Watson I will see you around then…” Sherlock awkwardly waved then turned to walk away.
“He’s clearly into men! At one point, he completely avoided me just to talk to his tiny knight!” Enola felt drained, you could hear it in her accented voice.
Luckily for Sherlock, he gets to enjoy his holiday doing just that.
John threw his head back against the pillow. Sherlock had left him with that stupid vibrator up his arse for thirty minutes! Thirty minutes of stimulation and no way to stop the constant throb of his erection. Thirty minutes of torture. Thirty minutes of pleasure.
“It’s not my kingdom yet.” The prince corrected her.
“What is?” John looked at him as confusion and concern fought over his features. Sherlock looked to the walls before speaking in a cautious tone.
“I’m certain my troublesome brother will fret over this, but I thought it would be nice to visit something my father built. This city may be small, but it’s history is rich. Do you see the purple vines curling up the side of the pink petaled plant?” The prince pointed towards said plant. “That is what we use to heal those injured in battle. When boiled in a pot of water, the petals release a thick substance which those healers over there,” He points to a group of people in mask and robes. “turn into a paste or something edible before using it to treat our wounded. There are many plants inside these walls which have magnificent healing properties. It’s quite amazing. Some flowers can even turn your face blue or orange.” Sherlock went on about the other plants surrounding them.
“Hi~” Johns lips curled upwards as he leaned over to capture Sherlock’s lips. With his hands twirling the curly locks, and his mouth preoccupied, John ground his lips down onto Sherlock’s lap gaining him a startled groan.
“Going in?”
“Yes, well have you been informed of the uprising? Many leaders were appalled at your choice to only invite seven of our ‘royal’ families.” Ludovica cut in. Her crystal blue eyes hid under her batting eyelashes. Sherlock looked her over once more. Caramel skin, bright eyes, plump lips, long peach dress, chocolate hair, hmm gossip of her kingdom- not to be trusted. The prince faked a smile.
John didn’t have much to do. He thought his job was to watch out for the prince, protect him, but so far all he’s done is keep him company. John was okay with keeping a man like Sherlock company. The prince knew lots of things, facts, and he wasn’t afraid to speak his mind.
“No! I- I can’t” John couldn’t stop himself from bucking his hips. He couldn’t stop himself from letting go. He couldn’t stop Sherlock from taking it all in and swallowing every drop. He couldn’t stop the small bit of pride that came over him when Sherlock smiled up at him, just like he couldn’t stop the large amount of embarrassment that overcame him when he realized he lost control.
“That’s not odd at all. I miss my father. It’s a natural thing to feel when someone has passed.” The knight tried to show him his reasoning, but it seemed to be brushed away.
“Princess, it appears our little adventure is over.” Sherlock watched John’s exchange with her and waited. Enola looked up at them in confusion. “No time, follow me.” John pulled them both out of the room and down a hall. In just a few seconds, they were thrown into the carriage and zooming out of the broken city.
“Excuse my free thoughts, but I could ask you the same thing. You are the center of attention, yet managed to slip away.. Interesting.” John’s eyes pierced through Sherlock’s soul. “Anyway, yes, I’m new. I was transferred here after training.” John finished his thoughts. A loud bell rang throughout the halls catching their attention.
“See you soon, love.” And then John and Molly disappeared down the hall leaving Sherlock to stare wishfully after him.
John took him in his mouth. He took him in his mouth. Everything was too, practiced. John hollowed his cheeks then sucked at his head. With slow teasing movements, he licked his tongue at the tip, causing Sherlock to buck his hips. He pushed the detective down with one hand, then used the other to pump at his base. With the combination of the slick heat of John's mouth around him, and the hand at his base, Sherlock felt himself fall apart. The heat that swirled inside him pooled lower in his body. His groin ached, his highs shook, he wanted to let go. He needed to let go. John pulled away with a pop.
The boy appears on the stage for three more songs, and graces the crowd with his movements each time. A piece of John leaves every time he exits the stage.
A lanky elderly gentleman walked in and cleared his throat. Sherlock sighed as he announced their menu. Fruits from around their country were brought out. Unique shapes and splashes of color sat around the table.
“Stop doing that, worrying does not look good on you.” Sherlock took a step towards his knight. “Come now, there’s something I want to show you.” Sherlock didn’t wait for John to respond. He simply sped off down the hall.
“Tsk, tsk.. I thought it’d take longer.. too bad, I’ve still got this to use…” Sherlock slowly removed his hand causing John to feel empty. The feeling didn’t last long though, because soon a cold object was being pushed inside him. “Let’s see how you handle this, John. Do you think you can make it?”
“Oh, hush, you know perfectly well that they can’t pin this on us. Now, be quiet, and help me.” Irene’s red stained lips formed into a menacing smirk.
John didn’t personally know the prince. He knew things about him, they’ve talked, but of nothing deep and meaningful. It didn’t matter to John that they barely knew each other. This process of finding a partner for the prince wasn’t something he looked forward to, but maybe he could-
Waiting is always the most dreaded part of any experiment. Will it work? What happens if it goes wrong? Common side effects include an improved mood, altered perception, delusional thinking, and relaxation. Negative side effects include vomiting, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, increased heart rate, anxiety, and paranoia. Well, maybe this wasn’t a good idea. He took the bait without any hesitation, what does that tell you? He trusts too easily. He doesn’t realize how dangerous trusting others can be.
“Mycroft! Your men are doing a lousy job of guarding our territory.” Sherlock stormed into his brothers quarters. Mycroft sat at a desk with his head in his hand.
When sentiment and regret broke the pages, John closed the book and returned it to its owner. He didn’t speak, he just stood there. The prince kept a trained eye on him, watched for any sign of a break or even a tear to escape.
“All is well.” Sherlock offered another forced smile.
Sherlock was mortified. Why had he let it get out of hand? Why had he done this to John in the first place? What does this mean about.. them? Would John remember what he did? Would he care? My god, of course he would care! John, the man that yells ‘Not Gay!’ Would be devastated to know what he’d done. That thought alone was enough to send Sherlock running. He gathered himself, then walked to the bathroom. He needed to get rid of the evidence.
“Hey, why’d you do that?” John sat back looking as if he could pounce again.
Not everybody gets to come home for Christmas. Not everyone gets to fall in love. Not everybody has the love of their life waiting at home for them. Not everyone gets to go home and stuff a vibrator up the love of their life’s arse.
“Sherlock dear, don’t you have women to sway?” His mother’s grin portrayed her teasing.
“My father’s old study. He had two, naturally.” Sherlock showed John all the books that lined the walls. There must have been thousands of books in this one tiny room. “Father didn’t tell anyone about this room, except me. He used it when he needed to be excused from the commotion of his daily life. Mummy would go crazy looking for him, but I could never tell her where he was. It’s.. odd.”
“I said, I’m off. I think I’ll just go back to bed then. No use staying down here when my bed is calling my name.” John let out a hollow chuckle. When he attempted to stand, he stumbled backwards. Sherlock stood beside him and held out his hand.
“What did he want?” Sherlock turned his head away from John so he could stare at the wall in defiance.
“What do you mean, he’s not into any of us?” Ludovica asked with great suspicion. Realizing she couldn’t back down from her statement, she gave in.
“You’re not good at this.” Sherlock smirked. John blushed.
“Dear boy, you know carrying through with it will please your mother. It would break her heart if you didn’t, especially with what your brother did.” Lady Hudson frowned. Sherlock mimicked her frown then stepped down from the stool and straightened his suit.
“Molly, why’d you let him drink? You know how he gets.” Sherlock popped up behind her, causing her to jump in surprise.
The doctor's eyes shot up to meet his at the sudden invasion. It took him a minute to relax enough for his body to start adjusting to the feeling. As soon as Johns breathing calmed down, Sherlock started moving. The movements were slow, measured, but not enough to cause much pleasure for John. A grunt from the smaller man told Sherlock he was ready for another one.
“John.” A question. A statement. A praise. A plea. Much more than just a name.
“Sir, what are you doing?” A familiar voice asked him, causing him to stop in his tracks. Sherlock smirked as he turned around to stare at his blonde knight.
“He’s just down there.” Molly points to the last black curtain. John hugs her, congratulates and thanks her, then turns to the curtains. He makes his way to the last one, then leans against the wall beside it. He doesn’t have long to wait.
“Out with it, John.” Sherlock stroked his hand through the blonde spikes. John leaned upwards so he could whisper into Sherlock’s ear.
As Sherlock opens his mouth to interrogate, a guard runs up to him, a frantic look upon his face. Both men turn to stare at the frazzled guard.
When Enola walked into the princesses wing, she was bombarded with questions.
“Boys! Get a room.” Irene tugged on John's arm trying to stop him. He, of course, flipped her off and muttered something about being allowed to kiss his boyfriend whenever he wanted to.
“No, John, we can do that later.” Sherlock couldn’t hide his amused tone. John groaned and shifted so that his head was resting on Sherlock shoulder.
John turns towards his mother with a wide grin plastered across his face. They share a knowing glance.
Hints of peppermint trace the air. Mothers, fathers, siblings, and aunts, bundled in winter coats, take their seats. Cousins scan their tickets and search the rows for their matching numbers. Dresses of red and suits of black fill the open room. All is calm once the lights finally dim.
The large door swung open and a cocky smile appeared on the man’s face as he pranced in. He swung his umbrella around as he walked. The smirk never faded. Sherlock caught sight of him and groaned.
“Sherlock, sleep with me, please.” John whined as Sherlock adjusted his grip.
“John Watson sir.” John straightened himself while responding. Greg looked over to the smiling prince with a knowing hint of satisfaction.
“As long as you keep me alive, then you’re doing fine.” Sherlock smiled giving him leeway. They fell into a comfortable silence until they reached the door leading to the outside. Sherlock paused with a sigh escaping his lips.
“What is that?” Johns eyes widened as he pointed to the object in his loves hands.
“Good morning your majesty” he bowed to Sherlock’s mother gaining an uninterested glare from the prince. He stood tall and proudly showed his daughter off.
“A knight that’s been injured in battle, but still wants to defend his kingdom, odd. You do know injured knights are paid handsomely to go home and stop fighting?” Sherlock snipped a piece of the vibrant magenta flower off its stem while his knight stared at his feet.
“John, I don’t want to go.” Sherlock groaned and slung his limbs off the sides of the couch. John picked up some of his chemistry notes and placed them on the table.
“Maybe she doesn’t know.” Irene purred.
“What have I told you? This is ridiculous! We could get caught!” Alessia ducked from the playful slap headed her way.
Irene and Alessia stood away from the girls as they shared a look. Janine piped up from leaning against the wall.
They walked through the corridor until they reached the dining hall, which Sherlock’s mother decided to be a good time for expressing her sentiments about his marriage. Sherlock watched the tears slip down her cheeks, but felt nothing in regards to their situation.
“I didn’t cry when he died. I didn’t say anything to my family for a month. I wasn’t there when it happened, but given the fact that I was a healer, they called my team to his field. When I saw what had been done to our king and then I saw what my father did to protect him, well- I wasn’t too pleased. He was carried away from me, and later died on a bed from a fever born illness. I wish they would have let me treat him, I hated the king for that. I actually hated the king for a lot of things, but that wasn’t my place to tell him what to do.” John slumped against the wall and let out a sigh.
“My father.. wasn’t a happy man.” John’s face darken as his eyes clouded over with understanding. “My father drank.. he drank everything away. They almost didn’t let him serve his king. Do you think that’s why he saved him? That’s why he did it, to show off, to prove a point.” Johns sullen attitude bubbled into rage as he worked through his father’s actions. “He left us, he left, because he wasn’t happy! He could have been treated, he could have lived a good life at home with mum. He chose to break apart our family.” John quickly jumped to his feet so he could pace.
“You’re better be grateful that I love you, John, because I wouldn’t agree to this if I didn’t.” Sherlock shoved a pillow onto his face.
It didn’t take long for him to get the hint. Sherlock took John into his hand and stroked along with his thrust. Neither of them lasted much longer after that.
“All is well, no need to worry. Most of the war is simply politics. Everyone over exaggerates the mess between our kingdom and others. Don’t worry, we will be safe.” Sherlock smirked then extended his arm out to the carriage in a showing off manner. “After you..” He waited until the princess climbed in to drop his smile. For an instant something worrisome flashed across his features, but it left as quickly as it came.
“That’s wrong, you are.” Sherlock states.
“Today starts the beginning stages of a joyous adventure brother mine! Do cheer up! Mummy dear is awfully excited. She claims to have invited the fairest ladies from every royal family in the surrounding area. How promising.” Mycroft’s teasing tone irritated his brother.
“Hey, excuse yo-“ Sherlock’s protests were cut off by the sight before him. John was in his pajamas, but wore Sherlock’s deep blue robe. He smelt of mints, he must have brushed the alcohol out of his mouth. John saw where his eyes went, and smirked. A second later and John was standing up so he could climb into his lap. With both knees on either side of Sherlock’s thighs, John ran his fingers into the brunettes curls.
“John Watson, don’t worry my prince, no need to introduce yourself, I know your name.” John smiled catching the princes gaze. Sherlock gave him a once over then stood straighter.
Mycroft unconsciously took a step backwards as his mother’s gaze became heavy. “Sorry, Mummy, but I shouldn’t concern myself with such normal simplicities. Ordinary people do ordinary things such as wasting their life-”
“Not another word.” Sherlock glared at John in fake anger, his cheeks tinted crimson. Once he was standing properly again, they were off. He zipped past maids and noblemen, until he came to a darkened part of the castle. The hallway seemed to own a depressing spirit. They walked slowly as they neared a dark oak door. Sherlock crept it open, then found an oil lamp to light.
“I’m not tired. I told you that earlier.” John buried his face into Sherlock’s chest. “Sherlock, I’ve got a secret..” John giggled, giggled.
“Maybe, but I learned those tricks from you~”
“Hmm?” Sherlock looked back to his slides, pretending to ignore the doctors movements. John mumbled something about ‘forget it’ and then he was off to shower. Time, it will only be a matter of time before-
“I’ve heard some are going to revolt against you. Fathers and mothers alike are angered with you and wish to be at the top of command. Sorry darling, but not everyone likes you. I’m sure you will be fine, you have the strongest defense after all.” Irene spoke through a sip of her juice.
“Molls, we missed you!” John hugged her back while stomping on Sherlocks foot.
Sherlock wrapped the beautiful silk rope around Johns wrists before tying him to the bed. The rules were simple. No touching yourself throughout this. It’s a game, of course, to see who can last the longest without giving in.
“No. There is no way she is staying with us, John. John, you don’t understand. She can’t come. No, I refuse. She has to stay with Mycroft.” Sherlock sulked as he drew his arms to his chest.
John looked up from reading yesterday’s papers. His cheeks darkened quickly once he realized what Sherlock had. He cleared his throat, then avoided Sherlock’s gaze. He turned his attention back to the paper that he’d already finished reading.
“Girlfriend.. no, not really my area.” Sherlock stilled himself as the air became thick. Johns eyes darted around the room as his eyebrows knit together.
“Oh, Sherlock, it’s only been a few minutes. He hasn’t had but three or four drinks.” Molly looked around for John, who was talking to a few of his rugby buddies.
“Excuse me?” John only spoke three dialects, he could pick up on her words, but wasn’t sure what she said. Enola stopped for a moment to catch her breath and rephrased her words- this time speaking in the language he could understand.
John stared out his window at all the people. He’s never laid eyes on this variety of humans before. Tall, short, light, dark, curly haired, long-straight haired, mixed, purebred, all types of people raced around him. A young girl stood near a tent with hair white as snow, and skin dark as coal. Her bright green eyes pierced through him, sending shivers down his spine.
The crowd is captivated by his movements, the swift pulls and kicks of his legs, the gentle gliding of his arms. It draws the people in. The care he takes with each step is absolutely stunning. John's mother holds her breath as she watches the boy twirl around the stage.
“You see, food isn’t something I enjoy. I eat enough to survive. My time should be spent elsewhere.” Sherlock poked a fork at the large strawberry near his plate.
“I’ll be back.” He smiles at her, then hurries off.
“I am what?” John doesn’t hesitate to question.
“Kiss me goodnight.” He demanded, how could Sherlock deny him?
“How are we supposed to get through with-“
“You only made it to the fifth setting, John. I’m disappointed, maybe next time I’ll cut the time in half.” Sherlock slipped in the rest of the way, only stopping once fully inside the smaller man.
“Welcome ladies and gentlemen to our home. We would like to make this a pleasant stay for you, so if anyone has a question or request don’t hesitate to ask. Now then, you will receive a key for your rooms shortly, then you are to meet us in the dining hall where we will resume our greetings.” A man called out then everyone shuffled about. Sherlock slipped away from his mother’s grasp and escaped to the hallway.
“Sherlock” he removed his hands from underneath his shirt only to pull it up and off. “Is this okay?” He asked again. Sherlock nodded, John didn’t hesitate to reconnect their bodies. Their exposed chests radiated heat of each other. He leaned down, stole an almost forceful kiss, then ground his hips down into Sherlock’s, sending shocks of pleasure through both their bodies.
Sherlock slumped to the floor in the bathroom. A tear slipped out. Then another, and another. He clutched at his sides as the pain rippled through his chest. His lungs tightened as they beat against his ribs. His head throbbed as he clenched his jaw. What was he going to do? John is going to hate him. John is going to hate him.
Sherlock had always been different, even to his omega core. Unlike the majority of the omega population, his body worked differently in the way that he was very particular with who he let touch him and who he touched. His skin would prickle with unease if a stranger even so tapped him on the shoulder. As time went by, he found only a select few he could tolerate, such as Mrs Hudson, Lestrade, his parents and
“You said to bring in things that smelled good, so I brought you here. Your scent is absolutely divine,” Sherlock purred, taking another whiff. With a gentle hand, he brought John’s face to his neck, letting the dazed omega breathe in his scent. Nuzzling, stroking through hair and light caresses passed between them as an hour quietly went by.
was there in the gesture. Their scents mixed together in harmony, swirling passionately in the air. Warmth blossomed in their hearts as they lay secure and snug in each other’s arms.
He sighed, looking down at his hand. John had asked him to hold his hand before retiring to his bedroom. He remembered grasping the smaller yet thick sturdy hand. How when their hands moulded together, a burst of warmth shot up through his arm to explore the rest of his body. He had felt the other man’s built-up calluses and every tiny nick and scar.
Silence fell between them as John let the words process. “Alright, I’ll try,” he said quietly. God knows how he had mastered pushing down the pain that threatened to bubble up inside him. It was necessary on the battlefield. “It’s hard, Sherlock, but I’ll try.”
He almost shouted
“I miss you,” John whispered, his voice cracking on the last word. He brought a hand up to pet at the dark curls. No reaction as usual. It wasn’t until a few minutes later that John realized he could feel his bottom lip trembling.
“It is abundantly clear that you cannot fit in my clothes,” Sherlock said, looking up and down on John in an exaggerated motion, “With me as a comparison, you are short and—”
“Hush,” murmured Sherlock, tilting his head back to cut off John’s rambling. “Just think about us.” Sherlock let his own omega pheromones of tenderness seep out of him. It seemed to have a calming effect, for John pressed a kiss on his neck.
“Right, I got everything I need,” Sherlock beamed, looking as cheery as he would on a locked-room murder case. John peered at his assortment of purchases.
, ran across the detective’s face before he narrowed his eyes.
So off Sherlock went, predicting he would solve the murder within two days. He had been sorely mistaken, for it turned out this case ended up tying with another case in a different town. The whole incident had turned the cogs in his mind fast with exhilaration, but traveling back and forth from town to town tired him and
John groaned, “You are an omega and you live with one. You must know about nesting. It’s an instinct we have.”
“This is called ‘spooning’ by the way. It’s a cuddle position.” John’s breath tickled the back of his neck as he hummed. No retort came from Sherlock, he was too dazed. His body relaxed and absorbed the warmth all along his back as each second went by. Tight, cozy and
There was a case out of town that had interested Sherlock, so he decided to investigate it. John opted out, saying he needed to stay and work. A huff was Sherlock’s response to that, but he hadn’t pressed further as he knew his flatmate would remain stubborn on the subject.
their bodies to press against each other, John complied with shuffling of his feet and his head bowed to bury into his chest. His flatmate let out a contented sigh, nuzzling with his nose. Sherlock wanted to cry. He could feel John’s low pur vibrate and smell his omega pheromones, now lush with calmness. His arm skated slowly up so his hand could cup the back of John’s neck, thumb nestling into the soft hairs. John’s sweet scent of honey and citrus tea with the underlying dash of gunpowder residue that made him so
Sherlock shook his head and interjected with, “Don’t bother. This outing was surprisingly pleasant and my experience only heightened thanks to you.” A rare genuine smile of Sherlock’s was aimed at him and John positively melted, he could feel his cheeks heating up.
Sherlock said nothing and with an inquiring quirk of his brow motioned John to continue.
“Of course,” replied Sherlock, the assured steady tone of his voice did not match his racing heart. “We’ll be mates.” John’s exhale of relief was audible and he stuffed his face into Sherlock’s neck. The omega scented him, savoring each whiff. He rubbed his cheek into his scent gland with a fervent need. A shiver of delight passed up Sherlock’s spine and a soft mew escaped him.
A flicker of, dare John say,
After they stepped in, John saw the other omega’s newly made nest on his bed. It looked something straight out of a romance drama show; a lot more organized and neat for your average omega’s nest. It was rather lovely, John could see why Sherlock picked the colour scheme. Black and purple contrasted nicely with the beige and light grey. In the mix, he could see a couple of scarves, a lab coat and even the deerstalker.
“No need to say it,” John shook his head, “It’s my fault anyways for taking your shirt. That wasn’t on.”
He bit his bottom lip. Sure, it was common for omega friends to nest together, but John wasn’t sure he could keep doing this. Nest with Sherlock while having feelings for the man. It would break his heart too much.
Rationally, he knew his body could hold out longer before he could get into a critical condition of touch-starvation, but deep inside him he wanted John’s touch
It’s because it was Sherlock that things would never be so easy.
Despite them, touch-starvation symptoms would creep up on him. Strong tremors and dizziness wracked through him unnoticed and he’d find himself in an omega hospital. Mycroft insisted on hiring a professional, but Sherlock sneered in response. In the end, he had succeeded in finding temporary solutions; bathing in hot water for a long period of time, curling himself into warm fuzzy blankets and squishing between two large body pillows. It staved off the madness writhing inside him for the most part, but the desire to be held by a body still resided. Then John came into his life and suffocated him with his warmth.
In their nest, the omegas snuggled deeper into each other feeling safe, protected and loved.
“Typically they’re for heat cycles,” John continued. He didn’t think that Sherlock deleted heats, as he knew his fellow omega was taking suppressants. “But outside of heat it’s common for us to build a nest when we’re stressed out or agitated. The nest allows us to calm down our senses and rest.” Sherlock nodded his head slowly and John could see the detective processing and taking the information in with a focused look in his eyes.
“You’ve got a yellow blanket in there,” John pointed at it. “Doesn’t that mess up your purple-beige-grey-black colour scheme?”
“I’ll buy a new one. Using Mycroft’s money, of course,” a small smile snuck on his face.
With quick strides he was in Sherlock’s space. In seconds, he had his flatmate pressed up against the wall, one arm restrained behind his back by John’s tight grip to the wrist, the other pinned up at the wall beside his head.
Oh, bugger all.
Embarrassed by his primal display, John sputtered, “Oh,” he coughed and could feel his body flush, “Thank you. That’s, uh, very considerate of you.” He pushed Sherlock out of his room and swiftly closed the door on him. Had he imagined Sherlock’s interest in him just now? Either way, he wanted Sherlock more than ever. His gorgeous, thrilling flatmate completed him, but he wasn’t sure what Sherlock felt about him given his disinterest towards romance. He dropped to his knees and buried his nose back into the dress shirt.
Sherlock was enthused when he had returned, but when John had greeted him he only gave him a brief pat on the shoulder and a ‘welcome back’. Sherlock had smelled Greg on him, and judging by his appearance, the two omegas had sat side by side, arms around their shoulders while they watched the telly for some good many hours. This was a common occurrence between his friends so he hadn’t been surprised, but the issue was that it meant John was satisfied physically. He wouldn’t request Sherlock things like hand-holding or hugging until the next day or so.
And then Sherlock Holmes waltzed into his life. Belstaff coat, cheekbones and all. He was danger dangling on a chain in front of him and John chased after him like it was the only thing he ever knew. Sherlock focused his mind on the Game so it wasn’t often he would have his brilliant flatmate’s attention on him, but when he did… bloody
Day 11. Sherlock blinked rapidly and John was by his side in a second.
“It’s not right,” Sherlock’s voice was tinged with displeasure, his hands opened and closed in frustration. With that, John felt a strong hand wrapped around his wrist and led him close to the nest. He felt a firm shove to his back before he tumbled onto bed.
John breathed in sharply, “What, underestimated how needy I am?” He felt frustration boil up in him. “I should be able to handle myself while you’re busy, yet here I am behaving like some kicked puppy,” his face was getting hot with shame, “Christ, Sherlock,
Sherlock felt John nuzzling into his dark curls, the unspoken
Feeling the warmth from Sherlock’s body, his breath on his skin and the scent of him cloaked all around him, John let out a soft mewl.
. He wiggled his body on the cushions.
‘Love’, as John would put it.
This was definitely something he would be telling his omega co-workers; the world’s one and only consulting detective bloody
“Can you hug me?”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock murmured, the vibrations of his voice felt in John’s body. From being held so warmly by his lover, John couldn’t help but bury himself into Sherlock’s neck and let out shaky sobs. Hot tears seared at his eyes blurring his vision while he bunched his hands in the other’s shirt weakly. He breathed in Sherlock’s scent and focused on his soothing touches that told him he was there with him, that he wasn’t going to leave. Baritone mutterings of apologies were pressed into his hair; an ‘I love you’ a whisper of tenderness. John nestled in further to let himself be consumed by Sherlock.
Somewhere along the way Sherlock let his heavy eyelids take over, sleep washing over him. When he woke up, he found he was still comfy against John, the other omega was threading his fingers in his dark curls. Sherlock yawned and pushed himself back deeper into John’s hold.
As if he read his mind, Sherlock leaned forward and suddenly his soft cupid bow lips were pressing gently on John’s. When the feather light kiss broke apart, John dived right back in.
“I am still deciphering why you would do such a thing in the first place,”
, John.”
One whole week, twenty-one hours, seven minutes and fifteen seconds. That’s how long he had been without John.
Sherlock nodded and took a long breath. “I had researched about dating and I discovered that anniversaries are of importance. Our anniversary of when we officially became… boyfriend and boyfriend—” he scrunched his nose a bit, still not used to relating to them in such insipid terms, “—is coming up in one week. I thought we could solve a cold case on our anniversary and go somewhere nice to eat. I had been in my Mind Palace, simulating each option and figuring out which one you would enjoy the most.”
and had the urge to tackle the other to the ground, but he restrained himself. “I’m fine.” John knitted his eyebrows and peered at him closely, eyes flitted all over his body. Ugh, Sherlock thought, he knew that look. That concerned analytical doctor’s look. “I’m
“I…” his partner paused and sucked his lips in. “It has been eleven days, correct?”
He himself never asked John for physical affection. He figured if he did, he would seek the other man’s attention all the time which would make him come off as clingy and drive John away. And for all Sherlock knew, he was just another person that John could snuggle up with. Old army companions, rugby teammates, the countless number of girlfriends, their clients—why would Sherlock be any different?
John started coming back to his senses, the warm buzz he felt in the pit of his stomach was prominent. Sherlock was shifting around and  his eyes fluttered open.
Most times the requests would happen in the private space of their flat, but there were instances where it happened in public. One of Sherlock’s favourite ones was when they were at a crime scene; John would ask Sherlock to hug him from behind and Sherlock would do just that while rattling off his deductions.
“S-Sherlock?!” he squeaked.
“Thank you,” Sherlock’s voice was soft. John untucked his head and shifted so he could press a kiss to the other’s chapped lips. Sherlock deepened the kiss. When they pulled back for air, the corner of Sherlock’s lips were tugged. “You know,” he quirked his eyebrow, “I can’t have you on me like this all day. You’re quite heavy.”
“You don’t understand, John,
“Us,” he repeated in a whisper.
“While I appreciate your greeting,” his deep muffled voice came through, “My breathing is strained in this position.”
Sherlock strolled towards him handling a bunch of blankets, covers and pillows.
It should be thrilling to be back at home, to be back in John’s presence. As he lay on the sofa with his hands steepled under his chin and in the safety of 221B, it wasn’t exactly the case.
“That’s not the point, John,” Sherlock interjected. “It’s no excuse. I went into one of my trances without saying anything to you. I will strive to put an end to that.”
his partner would beam. Sherlock wondered if John ever felt his heartbeat speed up during his praises.
“Nesting,” Sherlock said, trying the word on his tongue. “I see, that explains your hostility. I had harmed your nest. Your territory.”
Sherlock stayed silent. He had that look on his face. Eyebrows twitched together, his eyes looking everywhere but also nowhere at the same time. The look that expressed he didn’t know something and was searching through his Mind Palace.
“Of course,” Sherlock replied. If his voice betrayed the slightest hint of eagerness, it hadn’t seemed to bother John at all. He took strides toward his flatmate, observing how the other was trembling to the tips of his fingers, eyes drooped and tufts of hair sticking out wildly. It was often that after a long day of work, John would want physical affection.
This was not merely a figure of speech.
“Sherlock…” he started, his throat dry, “I-I’m okay now. I’m sorry about…what just happened. I don’t know what came over me.”
They were back at home. John sat on his usual seat reading a novel, his new knitted blanket was wrapped snug around him. He could hear Sherlock shuffling around in his bedroom getting his nest together. John pointed out that it wouldn’t be as effective if he wasn’t feeling distressed, but Sherlock ignored him, seeming very eager to try it out.
“Sherlock? Did something happen?” John questioned, but didn’t get an answer. The taller pulled John insistently from his chair, leaving his blanket behind and herded him to his room.
“Don’t apologize,” came Sherlock’s fond tone. “It’s my fault. I underestimated how you’d feel about this.”
“Hello there,” said John, “You know, I had never asked cuddling from you because I thought it would be pushing your boundaries. It’s clear that you enjoy it though.”
Head shaking, John spoke, “I don’t mind if you don’t tell me beforehand but… please don’t leave for so long.” He sounded so small.
When he looked up, Sherlock was gazing intently on him, eyes wide. His breathing had a baritone pur laced into it. It sent a tingle up John’s spine.
he had spoken and looked at John with a scrutinising gaze. ‘The worst’ weren’t eyeballs in the microwave or the man’s massive arrogance, rather, Sherlock had deduced that the worst for John was in fact him not talking for days on end.
. A doctor. A soldier.”
John tilted his head, “Um, yes.”
A good half hour later and his flatmate trudged out of his room. John looked up from his book. Sherlock’s mouth was pulled in a deep frown and his nose was twitching ever so slightly.
John should have known better, really. He had always sought out companionship whether it was with his rugby mates, his trusted comrades from the army, random blokes at the bar or the various women he had dated. Having someone else’s presence beside him with their attention and smile on him like a spotlight felt good to him. While it sounded self-centered, it was more like he was glad to have reassurance that someone acknowledged his existence, and maybe even cared for him.
John felt his jaw drop. “Are...are you sure?”
“Sher—?” He was cut off by a surge of strength from Sherlock, the lankier man pulling him down on the sofa and shifting until John was lying comfortably on top of his lover. One strong arm was across his back to clutch him tighter. His free hand worked through John’s hair, caressing with long fingers. John’s head was tucked under Sherlock’s chin and the former could feel his soft breathing.
“Brilliant,” John finally said, remembering he had a mouth and could speak. He marveled at the soft texture underneath his fingertips. “Thank you, Sherlock, that’s very kind of you. I don’t know how I can make it up to you, but I will—”
. His boyfriend hadn’t spoken a single word to him and rarely moved other than to grab whatever was on the tray and thoughtfully munch it down or to get up and use the loo. The strange part was that there wasn’t even a case going on—they hadn’t had any cases for a while now. John told himself that there must be a good reason behind it all. Perhaps some top secret mission from Mycroft he couldn’t tell him, or he was thinking of an earlier case they couldn’t solve. No matter what rationalizations he came up with, loneliness still found a way to creep up on him. The times he had gone out for a pint with Greg or chatted up with Mrs. Hudson never satisfied him like the way he ran around London with Sherlock or even the small moments between them like watching crap telly.
“Yeah,” John licked his lips absently. The truth was that a part of him had been happy to see his omega flatmate by his nest. He fancied him a lot and wanted him in his nest, he just hadn’t expected to see him destroying his hard work.
“John?” Sherlock’s voice was groggy as he sat up slowly. When he turned his head to get a proper look at John, his eyebrows furrowed ever so slightly as he took in his appearance. “Your complexion is pale, no color in your cheeks. Eyes red and faintly puffy. Just now your voice quivered…” the detective’s eyes widened, “Oh.” Long arms then wrapped around John’s waist.
With arms that felt heavy, John brought his hands up to grasp at the silky soft fabric, some of his fingers overlapped with Sherlock’s and the touch sent a spark of warmth to his heart. He wanted to never let go and wanted to pull Sherlock into an embrace. The feeling quickly fled when the taller dropped his hands to the side. Saddened by the loss, John moved by reflex and brought the dress shirt up to his face, inhaling and smelling deeply, taking in Sherlock’s sweet omega scent of tea that had an alluring smoky undertone to it. It instantly calmed him down.
With each eager step, he made his way up to his bedroom. Sounds of the telly on or the occasional shuffling above hadn’t registered him, his mind already zoning and getting prepared to kip. He opened the door to his room and—
“Oh, thank god,” John started. “I wasn’t sure if you were interested in me in that way. You seemed to enjoy it when we were physically affectionate with each other—which by the way I started that because I was a greedy bastard and wanted your touch—but it worried me that it was your—”
But then John stepped back and he was reminded that John was not his, nor did he belong to him. That John Watson was an omega, and omegas are of second-genders which require physical affection to sustain the balance of their body. The touches between them were nothing more. Yet Sherlock treasured their moments, and each one stored only made his heart grow heavier with sentiment.
When they had first met, John had wrapped his arms tight around Sherlock who reacted with a jolt. After a few seconds, he had realized he quite liked this snuggly creature clutching onto him; the omega was a bundle of warmth and his scent was an ambrosia he could get drunk off of. He reciprocated, squeezing back with his own lanky arms. When they pulled back (much to Sherlock’s dismay), John had looked up at him with a sheepish smile.
“How are you feeling?” John spoke with an uneven tempo. “Do… do you need anything?”
John sighed. He wanted to smack his arm for being uninformed about something that’s so essential to omegas, but also wanted to beam ‘brilliant’ at him since who the hell can simply ‘delete’ an instinct?
“I…” bugger, he’d figure it all out later. He couldn’t resist the sweet and comforting omega pheromones spilling out of John. “Cuddle with me… please,” his small tone pleaded.
Sherlock couldn’t stop his mewls that slipped past his lips as he was encased with John’s earthy home-sweet scent, his partner’s thumb stroking rhythmically back and forth on his belly.
“That felt soothing in ways even I cannot discern completely,” his flatmate’s mellow voice vibrated. “We shall nest together from now on.”
,” Sherlock insisted with a huff.
John’s mouth hung open. “Bloody hell, I had forgotten all about our anniversary. Well, now I feel like a bastard, you were being thoughtful the whole time while I—”
“You don’t just rip apart an omega’s nest and expect to go unscathed.” In fact, John was tame in comparison. He had heard many stories of people hospitalised for going near an omega’s nest uninvited.
bloody Mycroft.
“Hm. It appears I have deleted it,” Sherlock’s voice held a bored tone, “Most likely with the rest of omega biology along with it.”
He would get through this slump. It was far from the first time Sherlock cooped up in his mind, although nine days was a record time for it. Besides, from their introduction Sherlock had explained himself.
“No, no you’re not,” sighed John, “I hadn’t noticed it before, but with how you’re squirming and have tremors all over, and how you probably hadn’t had close contact while you were away, it’s natural as an omega for you to feel touch-deprived.” Sherlock wanted to shake his head and vehemently deny it all, but when John cupped his cheek with a gentle palm, he melted into the contact. John’s voice came out soft and buttery, “What do you need, Sherlock?”
